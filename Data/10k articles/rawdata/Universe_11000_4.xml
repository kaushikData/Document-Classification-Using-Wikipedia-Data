'''Akaganeite''' is an [[iron(III) oxide-hydroxide]] / [[chloride]] [[mineral]] with formula: Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;O(OH,Cl) e.g.; β-FeO(OH). It is formed by the weathering of [[pyrrhotite]] (Fe&lt;sub&gt;1−''x''&lt;/sub&gt;S). [[Nickel]] also has been reported in the structure. It has a [[monoclinic]] [[crystal structure]], a [[metal]]lic [[Lustre (mineralogy)|luster]] and a brownish yellow [[Mineral#Streak|streak]]. It is named after the Akagane [[mining|mine]] in [[Iwate, Iwate|Iwate]], [[Japan]], in which it was discovered. It has also been found in widely dispersed locations around the world and in rocks from the [[Moon]] that were brought back during the [[Apollo Project]]. The occurrences in [[meteorite]]s and the lunar sample are thought to have been produced by interaction with [[Earth's atmosphere]].  It has been detected on Mars through orbital imaging spectroscopy &lt;ref&gt; [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0019103515000366 Carter et al. 2015 "Orbital detection and implications of akaganéite on Mars" Icarus, 253: 296-310] &lt;/ref&gt;.

'''Ammonium perchlorate composite propellant''' ('''APCP''') is a modern [[solid-propellant rocket]] used in rocket vehicles. It differs from many traditional solid [[rocket propellant]]s such as [[black powder]] or [[Solid-fuel rocket#Zinc–sulfur (ZS) propellants|zinc-sulfur]], not only in chemical composition and overall performance, but also by the nature of how it is processed. APCP is [[Casting|cast]] into shape, as opposed to [[Powder metallurgy#Powder pressing|powder pressing]] as with black powder. This provides manufacturing regularity and repeatability, which are necessary requirements for use in the aerospace industry.

== Uses ==
Ammonium perchlorate composite propellant is typically used in aerospace propulsion applications, where simplicity and reliability are desired and [[specific impulse]]s (depending on the composition and operating [[pressure]]) of 180–260 seconds are adequate. Because of these performance attributes, APCP is regularly implemented in booster applications such as in the [[Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster]]s, aircraft [[ejection seat]]s, and specialty space exploration applications such as NASA's [[Mars Exploration Rover]] descent stage [[retrorocket]]s. In addition, the [[high-power rocketry]] community regularly uses APCP in the form of commercially available propellant "reloads", as well as single-use motors. Experienced experimental and amateur rocketeers also often work with APCP, processing the APCP themselves.

== Composition ==

=== Overview ===
Ammonium perchlorate composite propellant is a composite propellant, meaning that it has both fuel and oxidizer mixed with a rubbery [[binder (material)|binder]], all combined into a homogeneous mixture. The propellant is most often composed of [[ammonium perchlorate]] (AP), an [[elastomer]] binder such as [[hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene]] (HTPB) or [[Polybutadiene acrylonitrile|polybutadiene acrylic acid acrylonitrile prepolymer]] (PBAN), powdered metal (typically [[aluminum]]), and various [[burn rate (chemistry)|burn rate]] [[catalyst]]s. In addition, [[curing (chemistry)|curing]] additives induce [[elastomer]] binder [[cross-link]]ing to solidify the propellant before use. The perchlorate serves as the [[oxidizer]], while the binder and aluminum serve as the [[fuel]]. Burn rate catalysts determine how quickly the mixture burns. The resulting cured propellant is fairly [[:wikt:elastic|elastic]] (rubbery), which also helps limit fracturing during accumulated damage (such as shipping, installing, cutting) and high [[acceleration]] applications such as hobby or military rocketry.

The composition of APCP can vary significantly depending on the application, intended burn characteristics, and constraints such as [[nozzle]] thermal limitations or [[specific impulse]] (Isp). Rough mass proportions (in high performance configurations) tend to be about 70/15/15 AP/HTPB/Al, though fairly high performance "low-smoke" can have compositions of roughly 80/18/2 AP/HTPB/Al. While metal fuel is not required in APCP, most formulations include at least a few percent as a combustion stabilizer, propellant [[opacifier]] (to limit excessive [[infrared]] propellant preheating), and increase the temperature of the combustion gases (increasing Isp).

=== Common species ===
Oxidizers:
* [[Ammonium perchlorate]] as the primary oxidizer
* [[Metal-oxide]] [[catalysts]] as [[thermite]] oxidizers

High energy fuels:
* [[Aluminium]] (high performance, most common)
* [[Magnesium]] (medium performance)
* [[Zinc]] (low performance)

Low energy fuels acting as binders:
* [[Hydroxyl-terminated polybutadiene]] (HTPB)
* Carboxyl-terminated polybutadiene (CTPB)
* [[Polybutadiene acrylonitrile]] (PBAN)

=== Special considerations ===
Though increasing the ratio of metal fuel to oxidizer up to the [[stoichiometric]] point increases the combustion temperature, the presence of an increasing molar fraction of metal oxides, particularly [[aluminum oxide]] (Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) [[Precipitation (chemistry)|precipitating]] from the gaseous solution creates globules of solids or liquids that slow down the flow velocity as the mean molecular mass of the flow increases. In addition, the chemical composition of the gases change, varying the effective [[heat capacity]] of the gas. Because of these phenomena, there exists an optimal non-stoichiometric composition for maximizing Isp of roughly 16% by mass, assuming the combustion reaction goes to completion inside the [[combustion chamber]].

The combustion time of the aluminum particles in the hot combustion gas varies depending on aluminum particle size and shape. In small APCP motors with high aluminum content, the residence time of the combustion gases does not allow for full combustion of the aluminum and thus a substantial fraction of the aluminum is burned outside the combustion chamber, leading to decreased performance. This effect is often mitigated by reducing aluminum particle size, inducing turbulence (and therefore a long characteristic path length and residence time), and/or by reducing the aluminum content to ensure a combustion environment with a higher net oxidizing potential, ensuring more complete aluminum combustion. Aluminum combustion inside the motor is the rate-limiting pathway since the liquid-aluminum droplets (even still liquid at temperatures 3000 K) limit the reaction to a heterogeneous globule interface, making the surface area to volume ratio an important factor in determining the combustion residence time and required combustion chamber size/length.

=== Particle size ===
The propellant particle size distribution has a profound impact on APCP rocket motor performance. Smaller AP and Al particles lead to higher combustion efficiency but also lead to increased linear burn rate. The burn rate is heavily dependent on mean AP particle size as the AP absorbs heat to decompose into a gas before it can oxidize the fuel components. This process may be a rate-limiting step in the overall combustion rate of APCP. The phenomenon can be explained by considering the heat-flux-to-mass ratio: As the particle radius increases the volume (and, therefore, mass and heat capacity) increase as the cube of the radius. However, the surface area increases as the square of the radius, which is roughly proportional to the heat flux into the particle. Therefore, a particle's rate of temperature rise is maximized when the particle size is minimized.

Common APCP formulations call for 30-400&amp;nbsp;µm AP particles (often spherical), as well as 2–50&amp;nbsp;µm Al particles (often spherical). Because of the size discrepancy between the AP and Al, Al will often take an interstitial position in a pseudo-lattice of AP particles.

== Characteristics ==

===Geometric===
APCP [[Deflagration|deflagrates]] from the surface of exposed propellant in the combustion chamber. In this fashion, the geometry of the propellant inside the rocket motor plays an important role in the overall motor performance. As the surface of the propellant burns the shape evolves (a subject of study in internal ballistics), most often changing the propellant surface area exposed to the combustion gases. The [[mass flux]] (kg/s) [and therefore pressure] of combustion gases generated is a function of the [[instantaneous]] [[surface area]] &lt;math&gt;A_s&lt;/math&gt; (m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), propellant [[density]] &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; (kg/m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), and linear [[Burn rate (chemistry)|burn rate]] &lt;math&gt;b_r&lt;/math&gt; (m/s):

&lt;math&gt;\dot{m} = \rho \cdot A_s \cdot b_r&lt;/math&gt;

Several geometric configurations are often used depending on the application and desired [[thrust curve]]:
&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:circ ex.jpg|Circular bore simulation
Image:cslot ex.jpg|C-Slot simulation
Image:moon ex.jpg|Moon burner simulation
Image:fino ex.jpg|5-point finocyl simulation
&lt;/gallery&gt;

* Circular bore: if in [[BATES]] configuration, produces progressive-regressive thrust curve.
* End burner: propellant burns from one axial end to other producing steady long burn, though has thermal difficulties, CG shift.
* C-slot: propellant with large wedge cut out of side (along axial direction), producing fairly long regressive thrust, though has thermal difficulties and asymmetric CG characteristics.
* Moon burner: off-center circular bore produces progressive-regressive long burn though has slight asymmetric CG characteristics.
* Finocyl: usually a 5 or 6 legged star-like shape that can produce very level thrust, with a bit quicker burn than circular bore due to increased surface area.

===Burn rate===
While the surface area can be easily tailored by careful geometric design of the propellant, the [[burn rate (chemistry)|burn rate]] is dependent on several subtle factors:

* Propellant chemical composition.
* AP, Al, additive particle sizes.
* Combustion pressure.
* [[Heat transfer]] characteristics.
* Erosive burning (high velocity flow moving past the propellant).
* Initial temperature of propellant.

In summary, however, most formulations have a burn rate between 1–3&amp;nbsp;mm/s at [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|STP]] and 6–12&amp;nbsp;mm/s at 68 atm. The burn characteristics (such as linear burn rate) are often determined prior to rocket motor firing using a [[strand burner]] test. This test allows the APCP manufacturer to characterize the burn rate as a function of pressure. Empirically, APCP adheres fairly well to the following power-function model:

&lt;math&gt;b_r = a \cdot p^n&lt;/math&gt;

It is worth noting that typically for APCP, 0.3&lt;n&lt;0.5 indicating that APCP is sub-critically pressure sensitive. That is, if surface area were maintained constant during a burn the combustion reaction would not runaway to (theoretically) infinite as the pressure would reach an internal equilibrium. This isn't to say that APCP cannot cause an [[explosion]], but rather that the explosion would be caused by the pressure surpassing the burst pressure of the container (rocket motor).

== Model/high-power rocketry applications ==
[[Image:Rocket.jpg|thumb|A high-power rocket launch using an APCP motor]]
Commercial APCP rocket engines usually come in the form of [[model rocket#Reloadable motors|reloadable motor systems]] (RMS) and fully assembled single-use rocket motors. For RMS, the APCP "[[solid rocket#Grain geometry|grains]]" (cylinders of propellant) are loaded into the reusable motor casing along with a sequence of insulator disks and [[o-ring]]s and a ([[graphite]] or glass-filled [[phenolic resin]]) nozzle. The motor casing and closures are typically bought separately from the motor manufacturer and are often precision-machined from aluminum. The assembled RMS contains both reusable (typically metal) and disposable components.

The major APCP suppliers for hobby use are:
* [[Aerotech Consumer Aerospace]]
* Animal Motor Works
* Cesaroni Technology
* Kosdon (by Aerotech)
* Loki Research

To achieve different visual effects and flight characteristics, hobby APCP suppliers offer a variety of different characteristic propellant types. These can range from fast-burning with little smoke and blue flame to classic white smoke and white flame. In addition, [[pyrotechnic colorant|colored formulations]] are available to display reds, greens, blues, and even black smoke.

In medium- and high-power rocket applications, APCP has largely replaced [[black powder]] as a rocket propellant. Compacted black powder slugs become prone to fracture in larger applications, which can result in [[catastrophic failure]] in rocket vehicles. APCP's elastic material properties make it less vulnerable to fracture from accidental shock or high-acceleration flights. Due to these attributes, widespread adoption of APCP and related propellant types in the hobby has significantly enhanced the safety of rocketry.

== Environmental and other concerns ==
The exhaust from APCP solid rocket motors contains mostly [[water]], [[carbon dioxide]], [[hydrogen chloride]], and a [[metal oxide]] (typically [[aluminium oxide]]). The hydrogen chloride can easily dissolve in water and create corrosive [[hydrochloric acid]]. The environmental fate of the hydrogen chloride is not well documented. The hydrochloric acid component of APCP exhaust leads to the condensation of atmospheric moisture in the plume and this enhances the visible signature of the contrail. This visible signature, among other reasons, led to research in cleaner burning propellants with no visible signatures. Minimum signature propellants contain primarily nitrogen-rich organic molecules (e.g., [[ammonium dinitramide]]) and depending on their oxidizer source can be hotter burning than APCP composite propellants.

== Regulation and legality ==
In the United States, APCP for hobby use is regulated indirectly by two non-government agencies: the [[National Association of Rocketry]] (NAR), and the [[Tripoli Rocketry Association]] (TRA). Both agencies set forth rules regarding the [[Amateur rocket motor classification|impulse classification of rocket motors]] and the level of [[certification]] required by rocketeers in order to purchase certain impulse (size) motors. The NAR and TRA require motor manufactures to certify their motors for distribution to vendors and ultimately hobbyists. The vendor is charged with the responsibility (by the NAR and TRA) to check hobbyists for high power rocket certification before a sale can be made. The amount of APCP that can be purchased (in the form of a rocket motor reload) correlates to the impulse classification, and therefore the quantity of APCP purchasable by hobbyist (in any single reload kit) is regulated by the NAR and TRA.

The overarching legality concerning the implementation of APCP in rocket motors is outlined in NFPA 1125. Use of APCP outside hobby use is regulated by state and municipal fire codes. On March 16, 2009, it was ruled that APCP is not an explosive and that manufacture and use of APCP no longer requires a license or permit from the [[Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives|ATF]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://www.atf.gov/file/60711/download|title= JUL 07 2009 OPEN LETTER TO ALL FEDERAL EXPLOSIVES LICENSEES AND PERMITTEES}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''analytical balance''' (often called a "lab balance") is a class of balance designed to measure small [[mass]] in the sub-milligram range. The measuring pan of an analytical balance (0.1 [[milligram|mg]] or better)  is inside a transparent enclosure with doors so that [[dust]] does not collect and so any air currents in the room do not affect the balance's operation. This enclosure is often called a draft shield. The use of a mechanically [[vented balance safety enclosure]], which has uniquely designed acrylic airfoils, allows a smooth turbulence-free airflow that prevents balance fluctuation and the measure of mass down to 1 μg without fluctuations or loss of product.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} Also, the sample must be at [[room temperature]] to prevent natural [[convection]] from forming air currents inside the enclosure from causing an error in reading.  Single pan mechanical substitution balance maintains consistent response throughout the useful capacity is achieved by maintaining a constant load on the balance beam, thus the fulcrum, by subtracting mass on the same side of the beam to which the sample is added. {{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

Electronic analytical scales measure the force needed to counter the mass being measured rather than using actual masses. As such they must have calibration adjustments made to compensate for gravitational differences.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aandd.jp/support/materials/product_training1_balances.pdf A&amp;D training material]&lt;/ref&gt; They use an electromagnet to generate a force to counter the sample being measured and outputs the result by measuring the force needed to achieve balance. Such measurement device is called electromagnetic force restoration sensor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.sensorsmag.com/articles/0602/27/main.shtml Sensors Mag]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Triple beam balance ==
{{main|Triple beam balance}}

[[Triple beam balance]] is an instrument used to measure mass very precisely. The device has reading error of +/- 0.05 gram. The name refers to the three beams including the middle beam which is the largest size, the front beam which is the medium size, and the far beam which is the smallest size . The difference in size of the beams indicate the difference in weights and reading scale that each beam carry. The reading scale can be enumerated that the middle beam reads in 100 gram increments, the front beam can read from 0 to 10 grams, and the far beam can read in 10 gram increments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = TRIPLE Beam Balance|url = http://genchem.rutgers.edu/balance3b.html|website = genchem.rutgers.edu|access-date = 2016-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The triple beam balance can be used to measure mass directly into
from the objects, find mass by difference for liquid, and measure out a substance. The parts of triple beam balance are identified as the following.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.adamequipment.com/aeblog/an-introduction-to-education-scales-and-balances|title=An Introduction to Education Scales and Balances|last=|first=|date=|website=Adam Equipment USA|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#'''Weighing pan''' - The area in which an object is placed in order to be weighed.
#'''Base''' - The base rests underneath the weighing pan and can usually be customised to fit on a workbench or set up with tripod legs.
#'''Beams''' - The three beams on the balance are used to set the level of precision, with each beam working at different increments (1-10 grams, 10 grams and 100 grams). When using the triple beam balance, it is recommended that your start with the lowest level of precision e.g 100 gram increments and then work your way down. For example, if your object weighs 327 grams the 100 gram pointer will drop below the fixed mark on the 4th notch (400g), you will then need to move this back to the third notch (300g). This process will then need to be repeated for the 10 gram increments (20g) and then single figure units (7g).
#'''Riders''' - The riders are the sliding pointers placed on top of the balance beams to indicate the mass in grams on the pan and beam.
#'''Pointers''' - The scale pointer marks the equal point of the object's mass on the scale and mass on the beam
#'''Zero adjustment knob''' - This is used to manually adjust the triple beam balance to the 'zero' mark (check to ensure that the pointer is at zero before use).
Before using triple beam balance, the scale pointer should be at zero.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title = how to use a triple beam balance|url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Q5G_HVZ8XI|date = 2011-09-14|accessdate = 2016-02-19|last = MisterHager}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The zero adjustment knob can be used to adjust the scale pointer. Place the objects on the pan and adjust the riders. The hundred rider should be initially adjusted and follow by the tens rider. Adjust the ones rider until the scale pointer is at zero again.

The formation and powering of astrophysical jets are highly complex phenomena that are associated with many types of high-energy astronomical sources. They likely arise from dynamic interactions within [[accretion disk]]s, whose active processes are commonly connected with compact central objects such as [[black hole]]s, [[neutron star]]s or [[pulsar]]s. One explanation is that tangled [[magnetic field]]s&lt;ref name="Morabito" /&gt; are organised to aim two diametrically opposing beams away from the central source by angles only several degrees wide {{nowrap|(c. &gt; 1%).&lt;ref name="Kundt"&gt;{{cite journal

Massive central black holes in galaxies have the most powerful jets, but their structure and behaviours are similar to those of smaller galactic [[neutron stars]] and [[black hole]]s. These SMBH systems are often called [[microquasar]]s and show a large range of velocities. [[SS433]] jet, for example, has a velocity of 0.23[[Speed of light|c]].{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} Relativistic jet formation may also explain observed [[gamma-ray burst]]s. Notably, even weaker and less relativistic jets may be associated with many binary systems.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

Mechanisms behind the composition of jets remain uncertain,&lt;ref&gt;

==Rotation as possible energy source==
Because of the enormous amount of energy needed to launch a relativistic jet, some jets are possibly  powered by spinning [[black hole]]s. However, the frequency of high-energy astrophysical sources with jets suggest combination of different mechanisms indirectly identified with the energy within the associated accretion disk and X-ray emissions from the generating source. Two early theories have been used to explain how energy can be transferred from a black hole into an astrophysical jet:

Jets may also be observed from spinning neutron stars. An example is pulsar [[IGR J11014-6103]], which has the largest jet so far observed in the [[Milky Way]] Galaxy whose velocity is estimated at 80% the speed of light. (0.8c.) X-ray observations have been obtained but there is no detected radio signature nor accretion disk.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Bilbao Crystallographic Server''' is an [[open access]] website offering online crystallographic database and programs aimed at analyzing, calculating and visualizing problems of structural and mathematical crystallography, solid state physics and structural chemistry. Initiated in 1997 by the Materials Laboratory of the Department of Condensed Matter Physics at the [[University of the Basque Country]], Bilbao, Spain, the Bilbao Crystallographic Server is developed and maintained by academics.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cryst.ehu.es/html/doc/bcs_about.html About the Bilbao Crystallographic Server and its authors.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Information on contents and an overview of tools hosted==
Focusing on crystallographic data and applications of the group theory in [[solid state physics]], the server is built on a core of databases and contains different shells.

===Space Groups Retrieval Tools===
The set of databases includes data from ''International Tables of Crystallography, Vol. A: Space-Group Symmetry'',&lt;ref name=ITAA&gt;{{cite book
 | last = Wondratchek
 | first = Hans
 | title = International Tables for Crystallography, Vol. A1: Symmetry Relations Between Space Groups
 | publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons
 | year = 2010
 | isbn = 978-0-470-68908-0
}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the data of maximal subgroups of space groups as listed in ''International Tables of Crystallography, Vol. A1: Symmetry relations between space groups''.&lt;ref name=ITAA1&gt;{{cite book
 | last = Hahn
 | first = Theo
 | title = International Tables for Crystallography, Vol. A: Space-Group Symmetry
 | publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons
 | year = 2010
 | isbn = 978-0-470-66079-9
}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Crystal momentum|k-vector]] database with [[Brillouin zone]] figures and classification tables of the k-vectors for space groups is also available via the [http://www.cryst.ehu.es/cryst/get_kvec.html KVEC] tool.

===Magnetic Space Groups===
In 2011, the Magnetic Space Groups data compiled from H.T. Stokes &amp; B.J. Campbell's&lt;ref&gt;http://stokes.byu.edu/magneticspacegroups.html Table of Magnetic Space Groups.&lt;/ref&gt; and D. Litvin's&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bk.psu.edu/faculty/litvin/Download.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111119065722/http://www.bk.psu.edu/faculty/litvin/Download.html |date=2011-11-19 }} Magnetic Groups.&lt;/ref&gt;'s works [[general position]]s/[[symmetry operation]]s and [[Wyckoff positions]] for different settings, along with [[systematic absence]] rules have also been incorporated into the server and a new shell has been dedicated to the related tools ([http://www.cryst.ehu.es/cgi-bin/cryst/programs/magget_gen.pl MGENPOS], [http://www.cryst.ehu.es/cgi-bin/cryst/programs/magget_wp.pl MWYCKPOS], [http://www.cryst.ehu.es/cryst/magnext.html MAGNEXT]).

===Group-Subgroup Relations of Space Groups===
This shell contains applications which are essential for problems involving [[Subgroup|group-subgroup]] relations between space groups. Given the space group types of G and H and their [[Index of a subgroup|index]], the program [http://www.cryst.ehu.es/cryst/subgroupgraph.html SUBGROUPGRAPH] provides graphs of [[maximal subgroup]]s for a group-subgroup pair G &gt; H, all the different subgroups H and their distribution into [[conjugacy class]]es. The Wyckoff position splitting rules for a group-subgroup  pair are calculated by the program [http://www.cryst.ehu.es/cryst/wpsplit.html WYCKSPLIT].

===Representation Theory Applications===
The fourth shell includes programs on [[representation theory]] of [[Space group|space]] and [[point group]]s. [http://www.cryst.ehu.es/rep/repres.html REPRES] constructs [[Little group#Orbits and stabilizers|little group]] and full group [[irreducible representation]]s for a given space group and a k-vector; [http://www.cryst.ehu.es/rep/correl.html CORREL] deals with the correlations between the irreducible representations of group-subgroup related space groups. The program [http://www.cryst.ehu.es/rep/point.html POINT] lists [[character table]]s of crystallographic point groups, [[Kronecker product|Kronecker multiplication]] tables of their irreducible representations and further useful symmetry information.

===Solid State Theory Applications===
This shell is related to [[solid state physics]] and structural chemistry. The program [http://www.cryst.ehu.es/cryst/pseudosymmetry.html PSEUDO] performs an evaluation of the ''pseudosymmetry'' of a given structure with respect to supergroups of its space group. [http://www.cryst.ehu.es/cryst/amplimodes.html AMPLIMODES] performs the symmetry-mode analysis of any distorted structure of displacive type. The analysis consists in decomposing the symmetry-breaking distortion present in the distorted structure into contributions from different symmetry-adapted modes. Given the high and low symmetry structures, the program calculates the amplitudes and polarization vectors of the distortion modes of different symmetry frozen in the structure. The program [http://www.cryst.ehu.es/rep/sam.html SAM] calculates symmetry-adapted modes for the centre of the Brillouin zone and classifies them according to their [[Infrared spectroscopy|infrared]] and [[Raman scattering|Raman activity]]. [http://www.cryst.ehu.es/rep/neutron.html NEUTRON] computes the phonon extinction rules in inelastic [[neutron scattering]]. Its results are also relevant for [[X-ray diffuse scattering|diffuse-scattering]] experiments.

===Structure Utilities===
A set of structure utilities has been included for various applications such as: the transformation of [[unit cell]]s  ([http://www.cryst.ehu.es/cryst/celltran.html CELLTRAN]) or complete structures ([http://www.cryst.ehu.es/cryst/transtru.html TRANSTRU]); [[Strain tensor#Infinitesimal strain tensor|strain tensor]] calculation ([http://www.cryst.ehu.es/cryst/strain.html STRAIN]); assignment of [[Wyckoff positions|Wyckoff Positions]] ([http://www.cryst.ehu.es/cryst/wpassign.html WPASSIGN]); equivalent descriptions of a given structure ([http://www.cryst.ehu.es/cryst/equivstru.html EQUIVSTRU]); comparison of different structures with support for the affine [[normalizer]]s of [[Monoclinic crystal system|monoclinic]] space groups. [http://www.cryst.ehu.es/cryst/rel.html STRUCTURE RELATIONS] calculates the possible [[Transformation matrix|transformation matrices]] for a given pair of group-subgroup related structures.

===Incommensurate Crystal Structures Database===
The Bilbao Crystallographic Server also hosts the [https://web.archive.org/web/20111205170131/http://158.227.21.14/incstrdb/ B-IncStrDB: Bilbao Incommensurate Crystal Structures Database], a database for incommensurately modulated and composite structures.

==Development History and People==
The Bilbao Crystallographic Server came to life in 1997 as a scientific project by the [https://web.archive.org/web/20120127074622/http://lcdx00.wm.lc.ehu.es/lama/ Departments of Condensed Matter Physics and Applied Physics II] of the [[University of the Basque Country]] (EHU) under the supervision of J. Manuel Perez-Mato (EHU) and Mois I. Aroyo (EHU), in coordination with Gotzon Madariaga (EHU) and Hans Wondratschek ([[Karlsruhe Institute of Technology]], Germany) with funding from the Basque government and several ministries of the Spanish government. The initial code was written by then Ph.D. students Eli Kroumova (EHU) and Svet Ivantchev (EHU) and the very first shells related to retrieval tools, group-subgroup relations and space group representations have soon appeared online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kroumova E, Perez-Mato JM, Aroyo MI |title=WYCKSPLIT: a computer program for determination of the relations of Wyckoff positions for a group-subgroup pair|journal=J. Appl.

Afterwards, in collaboration with Harold T. Stokes and Dorian M. Hatch from  [[Brigham Young University]], USA, the server extended its services to include symmetry modes analysis. Asen K. Kirov, a Ph.D. student from [[Sofia University]], Bulgaria contributed to the server, working on programs dedicated to [[Group representation#Reducibility|irreducible representations]] and [[Structure factor#Structure factors for specific lattice types|extinction rules]].

In 2001, Ph.D. student Cesar Capillas began his research on the server and became the main developer and system administrator focusing on structure relations, such as pseudosymmetry and [[phase transition]]s. Danel Orobengoa, also a Ph.D. student, joined the developer team in 2005 and worked mainly on symmetry modes, k-vector classification tables and non-characteristic orbits (in collaboration with Massimo Nespolo of the [[Nancy-Université]], France), writing his Ph.D. thesis on the applications of the server for [[Ferroics|ferroic materials]].

In 2009, Ph.D. student Gemma de la Flor and post-doc Emre S. Tasci were recruited for the development team: de la Flor working mainly on the identification and interpretation of [[symmetry operation]]s, structure comparison and Tasci becoming the new system administrator and main developer, focusing in the structure relations concerning phase transitions. The Bilbao Crystallographic Server team took its current (2012) line-up in 2010 with the addition of Ph.D. student Samuel Vidal Gallego, his main research field being the [[Space group#Magnetic groups and time reversal|magnetic space groups]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cryst.ehu.es/wiki/index.php/About_the_Bilbao_Crystallographic_Server "About the Bilbao Crystallographic Server", Bilbao Crystallographic Server's official wiki entry.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Brokke Power Station ''' is a [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] [[power station]] located in the municipality [[Valle, Norway|Valle]] in [[Aust-Agder]] county, [[Norway]]. It is located on the west shore of the river [[Otra]], about {{convert|4|km}} north of the village of [[Rysstad]].  The [[Norwegian National Road 9]] runs past the station.  The facility operates at an installed capacity of {{convert|330|MW|lk=on}}. The average annual production is {{convert|1416|GWh|lk=on}}.  The power station receives its water from the lake [[Botnsvatnet]] via a {{convert|30|km|adj=on}} long tunnel from the lake high up in the mountains.  The water flowing down through the tunnel is used to produce the hydroelectric power.&lt;ref name=snl&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Brokke |encyclopedia=[[Store norske leksikon]]|editor=Henriksen, Petter |publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget  |location=Oslo|url=http://www.snl.no/Brokke|language=Norwegian|accessdate=15 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[philosophy of thermal and statistical physics]], the '''Brownian ratchet''' or '''Feynman-Smoluchowski ratchet'''  is a [[thought experiment]] about an apparent [[perpetual motion]] machine first analysed in 1912 by Polish physicist [[Marian Smoluchowski]]&lt;ref name="Smoluchowski"&gt;M. von Smoluchowski (1912) Experimentell nachweisbare, der Ublichen Thermodynamik widersprechende Molekularphenomene, ''Phys.

The simple machine, consisting of a tiny [[paddle wheel]] and a [[ratchet (device)|ratchet]], appears to be an example of a [[Maxwell's demon]], able to extract useful work from [[thermal fluctuations|random fluctuations]] (heat) in a system at [[thermal equilibrium]] in violation of the [[second law of thermodynamics]].  Detailed analysis by Feynman and others showed why it cannot actually do this.

==The machine==
The device consists of a gear known as a [[ratchet (device)|ratchet]] that rotates freely in one direction but is prevented from rotating in the opposite direction by a [[pawl]].  The ratchet is connected by an axle to a [[paddle wheel]] that is immersed in a [[fluid]] of [[molecule]]s at [[temperature]] &lt;math&gt;T_1&lt;/math&gt;.  The molecules constitute a [[heat bath]] in that they undergo random [[Brownian motion]] with a mean [[kinetic energy]] that is determined by the [[temperature]].  The device is imagined as being small enough that the impulse from a single molecular collision can turn the paddle.  Although such collisions would tend to turn the rod in either direction with equal probability, the pawl allows the ratchet to rotate in one direction only. The net effect of many such random collisions would seem to be that the ratchet rotates continuously in that direction.  The ratchet's motion then can be used to do [[work (physics)|work]] on other systems, for example lifting a weight (''m'') against gravity.  The energy necessary to do this work apparently would come from the heat bath, without any heat gradient. Were such a machine to work successfully, its operation would violate the [[second law of thermodynamics]], one form of which states: "It is impossible for any device that operates on a cycle to receive heat from a single reservoir and produce a net amount of work."

==Why it fails==
Although at first sight the Brownian ratchet seems to extract useful work from Brownian motion, Feynman demonstrated that if the entire device is at the same temperature, the ratchet will not rotate continuously in one direction but will move randomly back and forth, and therefore will not produce any useful work.  The reason is that since the pawl is at the same temperature as the paddle, it will also undergo Brownian motion, "bouncing" up and down.  It therefore will intermittently fail by allowing a ratchet tooth to slip backward under the pawl while it is up.  Another issue is that when the pawl rests on the sloping face of the tooth, the spring which returns the pawl exerts a sideways force on the tooth which tends to rotate the ratchet in a backwards direction.    Feynman demonstrated that if the temperature &lt;math&gt;T_2&lt;/math&gt; of the ratchet and pawl is the same as the temperature &lt;math&gt;T_1&lt;/math&gt; of the paddle, then the failure rate must equal the rate at which the ratchet ratchets forward, so that no net motion results over long enough periods or in an ensemble averaged sense.&lt;ref name="Feynman" /&gt; A simple but rigorous proof that no net motion occurs no matter what shape the teeth are was given by [[Marcelo Osvaldo Magnasco|Magnasco]].&lt;ref name="forced"&gt;{{cite journal

If, on the other hand, &lt;math&gt;T_2&lt;/math&gt; is smaller than &lt;math&gt;T_1&lt;/math&gt;, the ratchet will indeed move forward, and produce useful work.  In this case, though, the energy is extracted from the temperature gradient between the two thermal reservoirs, and some [[waste heat]] is exhausted into the lower temperature reservoir by the pawl.  In other words, the device functions as a miniature [[heat engine]], in compliance with the second law of thermodynamics. Conversely, if &lt;math&gt;T_2&lt;/math&gt; is greater than &lt;math&gt;T_1&lt;/math&gt;, the device will rotate in the opposite direction.

The Feynman ratchet model led to the similar concept of [[Brownian motor]]s, [[nanomachine]]s which can extract useful work not from thermal noise but from [[chemical potential]]s and other microscopic [[Thermodynamic equilibrium|nonequilibrium]] sources, in compliance with the laws of thermodynamics.&lt;ref name="forced" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

nonvanishing correlation function of odd order greater than one.

==History==
The [[ratchet and pawl]] was first discussed as a Second Law-violating device by [[Gabriel Lippmann]] in 1900.&lt;ref name="Harmer"&gt;

Feynman did the first quantitative analysis of the device in 1962 using the [[Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution]], showing that if the temperature of the paddle ''T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' was greater than the temperature of the ratchet ''T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'', it would function as a [[heat engine]], but if ''T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' there would be no net motion of the paddle.  In 1996, [[Juan Parrondo]] and Pep Español used a variation of the above device in which no ratchet is present, only two paddles, to show that the axle connecting the paddles and ratchet conducts heat between reservoirs; they argued that although Feynman's conclusion was correct, his analysis was flawed because of his erroneous use of the [[Quasistatic process|quasistatic]] approximation, resulting in incorrect equations for efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

[[File:Brillouin-Paradoxon.svg|thumb|Brillouin paradox: an electrical analogue of the Brownian ratchet.]]

[[Léon Brillouin]] in 1950 discussed an electrical circuit analogue that uses a [[rectifier]] (such as a diode) instead of a ratchet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1103/PhysRev.78.627.2| title = Can the Rectifier Become a Thermodynamical Demon?| year = 1950| last1 = Brillouin | first1 = L.| journal = Physical Review| volume = 78| issue = 5| pages = 627-628|bibcode = 1950PhRv...78..627B }}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea was the diode would rectify the [[Johnson noise]] thermal current fluctuations produced by the [[resistor]], generating a [[direct current]]  which could be used to perform work. In the detailed analysis it was shown that the thermal fluctuations within the diode generate an [[electromotive force]] that cancels the voltage from rectified current fluctuations.  Therefore, just as with the ratchet, the circuit will produce no useful energy if all the components are at thermal equilibrium (at the same temperature); a DC current will be produced only when the diode is at a lower temperature than the resistor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1063/1.1652709| title = Spontaneous Reverse Current Due to the Brillouin EMF in a Diode| year = 1969| last1 = Gunn | first1 = J.

==Granular gas==
Researchers from the University of Twente, the University of Patras in Greece, and the Foundation for Fundamental Research on Matter have constructed a Feynman-Smoluchowski engine which, when not in thermal equilibrium, converts pseudo-[[Brownian motion]] into [[work (physics)|work]] by means of a [[Granular material#Granular gases|granular gas]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fom.nl/live/english/news/artikel.pag?objectnumber=120223 "Classical thought experiment brought to life in granular gas"], ''[[Foundation for Fundamental Research on Matter]]'', Utrecht, 18 June 2010. Retrieved on 2010-06-24.&lt;/ref&gt; which is a conglomeration of solid particles vibrated with such vigour that the system assumes a gas-like state.  The constructed engine consisted of four vanes which were allowed to rotate freely in a vibrofluidized granular gas.&lt;ref name="eshuis"&gt;

This seems to contradict Feynman's hypothesis.  However, this system is not in perfect thermal equilibrium: energy is constantly being supplied to maintain the fluid motion of the beads.  Vigorous vibrations on top of a shaking device mimic the nature of a molecular gas.  Unlike an [[ideal gas]], though, in which tiny particles move constantly, stopping the shaking would simply cause the beads to drop.  In the experiment, this necessary out-of-equilibrium environment was thus maintained.  Work was not immediately being done, though; the ratchet effect only commenced beyond a critical shaking strength.  For very strong shaking, the vanes of the paddle wheel interacted with the gas, forming a convection roll, sustaining their rotation.&lt;ref name="eshuis" /&gt;  The experiment was [http://stilton.tnw.utwente.nl/dryquicksand/ratchet/ratchet.html filmed].

The '''chameleon''' is a hypothetical [[scalar particle]] that couples to matter more weakly than gravity,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.sciencemag.org/physics/2015/08/tiny-fountain-atoms-sparks-big-insights-dark-energy  Tiny fountain of atoms sparks big insights into dark energy] by Adrian Cho on August 20, 2015. Published at the "American Association for the Advancement of Science"&lt;/ref&gt; postulated as a [[dark energy]] candidate.&lt;ref&gt;J Khoury and A. Weltman, Phys. Rev. D '''69''', 044026 (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; Due to a non-linear self-interaction, it has a variable effective mass which is an increasing function of the ambient energy density—as a result, the range of the force mediated by the particle is predicted to be very small in regions of high density (for example on Earth, where it is less than 1mm) but much larger in low-density intergalactic regions: out in the cosmos chameleon models permit a range of up to several thousand [[parsecs]]. As a result of this variable mass, the hypothetical [[fifth force]] mediated by the chameleon is able to evade current constraints on [[equivalence principle]] violation derived from terrestrial experiments even if it couples to matter with a strength equal or greater than that of gravity. Although this property would allow the chameleon to drive the currently observed acceleration of the [[cosmic inflation|universe's expansion]], it also makes it very difficult to test for experimentally.

==Hypothetical properties==
Chameleon particles were proposed in 2003 by Khoury and Weltman.

In most theories, chameleons have a mass that scales as some power of the local energy density: &lt;math&gt;m_\text{eff} \sim \rho^\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\alpha \simeq 1&lt;/math&gt;.

Chameleons also couple to photons, allowing photons and chameleons to oscillate between each other in the presence of an external [[magnetic field]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Chameleons can be confined in hollow containers because their mass increases rapidly as they penetrate the container wall, causing them to reflect. One strategy to search experimentally for chameleons is to direct photons into a cavity, confining the chameleons produced, and then to switch off the light source. Chameleons would be indicated by the presence of an afterglow as they decay back into photons.&lt;ref&gt;J.H.

The GammeV experiment&lt;ref&gt;[http://gammev.fnal.gov/ GammeV experiment at Fermilab]&lt;/ref&gt; is a search for axions, but has been used to look for chameleons too. It consists of a cylindrical chamber inserted in a 5 [[Tesla (unit)|T]] magnetic field. The ends of the chamber are glass windows, allowing light from a laser to enter and afterglow to exit.

'''Cyclopropene''' is an [[organic compound]] with the [[chemical formula|formula]] {{carbon}}&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;{{hydrogen}}&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. It is the simplest [[cycloalkene]]. Because the ring is highly [[Ring strain|strained]], cyclopropene is difficult to prepare and highly reactive.  This colorless gas has been the subject for many fundamental studies of bonding and reactivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Carter, F. L. |author2= Frampton, V. L. |title= Review of the Chemistry of Cyclopropene Compounds |journal= Chemical Reviews |year= 1964 |volume= 64 |pages= 497–525 |doi= 10.1021/cr60231a001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It does not occur naturally, but derivatives are known in some fatty acids.  Derivatives of cyclopropene are used commercially to control ripening of some fruit.

==Structure and binding==
The molecule has a [[triangle|triangular]] structure.  The reduced length of the [[alkene|double bond]] compared to a [[alkane|single bond]] causes the angle opposite the double bond to narrow to about 51° from the 60° angle found in [[cyclopropane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Structure of 3-cyanocyclopropene by microwave spectroscopy and ab initio molecular orbital calculations. Evidence for substituent-ring double bond interactions |author= Staley, S. W. |author2= Norden, T. D. |author3= Su, C.-F. |author4= Rall, M. |author5= Harmony, M. D. |journal= J. Am. Chem. Soc. |year= 1987 |volume= 109 |issue= 10 |pages= 2880–2884 |doi= 10.1021/ja00244a004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As with cyclopropane, the carbon–carbon bonding in the ring has increased [[atomic orbital|p character]]: the alkene carbons use sp&lt;sup&gt;2.68&lt;/sup&gt; [[Orbital hybridisation|hybridization]] for the ring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Tetrahedron |volume= 38 |issue= 5 |year= 1982 |pages= 645–655 |doi= 10.1016/0040-4020(82)80206-8 |title= The geometry of small rings: Molecular geometry of cyclopropene and its derivatives |author= Allen, F. H. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synthesis of cyclopropene and derivatives==

===Early syntheses===
The first confirmed synthesis of cyclopropene, carried out by Dem'yanov and Doyarenko, involved the [[thermal decomposition]] of trimethylcyclopropylammonium hydroxide over platinized clay at 320–330&amp;nbsp;°C under a CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; atmosphere. This reaction produces mainly [[trimethylamine]] and dimethylcyclopropyl amine, together with about 5% of cyclopropene. Cyclopropene can also be obtained in about 1% yield by thermolysis of the adduct of [[cycloheptatriene]] and [[dimethyl acetylenedicarboxylate]].

===Modern syntheses from allyl chlorides===
[[Allyl chloride]] undergoes [[dehydrohalogenation]] upon treatment with the base [[sodium amide]] at 80&amp;nbsp;°C to produce cyclopropene in about 10% yield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Closs, G.L. |author2= Krantz, K.D. |title= A Simple Synthesis of Cyclopropene |journal= Journal of Organic Chemistry |year= 1966 |volume= 31 |pages= 638 |doi= 10.1021/jo01340a534 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
::CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=CHCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl  +  NaNH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  →  C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (cyclopropene)  +  NaCl  +  NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
The major byproduct of the reaction is [[allylamine]]. Adding allyl chloride to [[sodium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide]] in boiling [[toluene]] over a period of 45–60&amp;nbsp;minutes produces the targeted compound in about 40% yield with an improvement in purity:&lt;ref name=Binger&gt;{{OrgSynth |author= Binger, P. |author2= Wedermann, P. |author3= Brinker, U. H. |year= 2000 |title= Cyclopropene: A New Simple Synthesis and Its Diels-Alder reaction with Cyclopentadiene |volume= 77 |pages= 254 |collvol= 10 |collvolpages= 231 |prep=v77p0254}}&lt;/ref&gt;
::CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=CHCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl + NaN(TMS)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (cyclopropene)  +  NaCl  +  NH(TMS)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
1-Methylcyclopropene is synthesized similarly but at room temperature from methallylchloride using [[phenyllithium]] as the base:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Clarke, T. C. |author2= Duncan, C. D. |author3= Magid, R. M. |title= An Efficient and Convenient Synthesis of 1-Methylcyclopropene |journal= J. Org. Chem. |year= 1971 |volume= 36 |pages= 1320 |doi= 10.1021/jo00808a041 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
::CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=C(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl  +  LiC&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; → CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (1-methylcyclopropene)  +  LiCl  +  C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;

===Syntheses of derivatives===
Treatment of nitrocyclopropanes with [[sodium methoxide]] eliminates the nitrite, giving the respective cyclopropene derivative. The synthesis of purely aliphatic cyclopropenes was first illustrated by the copper-catalyzed additions of carbenes to alkynes. In the presence of a copper catalyst, [[ethyl diazoacetate]] reacts with acetylenes to give cyclopropenes. 1,2-Dimethylcyclopropene-3-carboxylate arises via this method from [[2-butyne]]. Copper, as copper sulfate and copper dust, are among the more popular forms of copper used to promote such reactions.  [[Rhodium acetate]] has also been used.  The addition of dichlorocarbene to tetrachloroethylene gives [[tetrachlorocyclopropene]].

==Reactions of cyclopropene==
Studies on cyclopropene mainly focus on the consequences of its high ring strain. At 425&amp;nbsp;°C, cyclopropene isomerizes to [[methylacetylene]] (propyne).
:C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;  →  H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CC&amp;equiv;CH

Attempted fractional distillation of cyclopropene at –36&amp;nbsp;°C (its predicted boiling point) results in polymerization.   The mechanism is assumed to be a free-radical chain reaction, and the product, based on NMR spectra, is thought to be polycyclopropane.

Cyclopropene undergoes the [[Diels–Alder reaction]] with [[cyclopentadiene]] to give endo-tricyclo[3.2.1.0&lt;sup&gt;2,4&lt;/sup&gt;]oct-6-ene. This reaction is commonly used to check for the presence of cyclopropene, following its synthesis.&lt;ref name=Binger/&gt;

[[File:Embalse de Vega de Tera (Presa Rota).JPG|thumb|300px|right|Ruins of the dam of [[Ribadelago|Vega de Tera]] (Spain) after breaking in 1959.]]
A [[dam]] is a barrier across flowing water that obstructs, directs or slows down the flow, often creating a [[reservoir]], [[lake]] or impoundments. Most dams have a section called a ''[[spillway]] or [[weir]]'' over or through which water flows, either intermittently or continuously, and some have [[hydroelectricity|hydroelectric power generation]] systems installed.

Dams are considered "installations containing dangerous forces" under [[International humanitarian law]] due to the massive impact of a possible destruction on the civilian population and the environment. Dam failures are comparatively rare, but can cause immense damage and loss of life when they occur. In 1975 the failure of the [[Banqiao Dam|Banqiao Reservoir Dam]] and other dams in [[Henan|Henan Province]], China caused more casualties than any other dam failure in history. The disaster killed an estimated 171,000 people&lt;ref&gt;[[Evan Osnos|Osnos, Evan]]. "Faust, China, and Nuclear Power," ''The New Yorker'', Wednesday October 12, 2011. Retrieved at http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/evanosnos/2011/10/faust-china-and-nuclear-power.html on October 12, 2011. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313134654/http://www.newyorker.com/news/letter-from-china/faust-china-and-nuclear-power|date=March 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 11 million people lost their homes.

==Main causes of dam failure==
[[Image:International special sign for works and installations containing dangerous forces.svg|thumb|160px|right|International special sign for works and installations containing dangerous forces]]

Common causes of dam failure include:
* Sub-standard construction materials/techniques ([[Gleno Dam]])
* [[Spillway]] design error ([[South Fork Dam]], near failure of [[Glen Canyon Dam]])
* Geological instability caused by changes to water levels during filling or poor surveying ([[Malpasset Dam]]).
* Sliding of a mountain into the reservoir ([[Vajont Dam]] – not exactly a dam failure, but caused nearly the entire volume of the reservoir to be displaced and overtop the dam)
* Poor maintenance, especially of outlet pipes ([[Lawn Lake Dam]], [[Val di Stava dam collapse]])
* Extreme inflow ([[Shakidor Dam]])
* Human, computer or design error ([[Buffalo Creek Flood]], [[Dale Dike Reservoir]], [[Taum Sauk pumped storage plant]])
* [[Internal erosion]] or piping, especially in earthen dams ([[Teton Dam]])
* [[Earthquake]]s

===Deliberate dam failure===
A notable case of deliberate dam failure (prior to the Humanitarian Law rulings) was the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Royal Air Force]] [[Operation Chastise|Dambusters]] raid on [[Germany]] in [[World War II]] (codenamed ''"[[Operation Chastise]]"''), in which six German dams were selected to be breached in order to impact on German infrastructure and manufacturing and power capabilities deriving from the [[Ruhr (river)|Ruhr]] and [[Eder]] rivers. This raid later became the basis for several films.

Other cases include the Chinese bombing of multiple dams during [[Typhoon Nina (1975)]] in an attempt to drain them before their reservoirs overflowed. The typhoon produced what is now considered a 1-in-2000 years flood, which few if any of these dams were designed to survive.

'''District heating''' (also known as '''heat networks''' or '''teleheating''') is a system for distributing heat generated in a centralized location through a system of [[insulated pipe]]s for residential and commercial heating requirements such as [[space heating]] and [[water heating]]. The heat is often obtained from a [[cogeneration]] plant burning fossil fuels or [[biomass]], but [[heat-only boiler station]]s, [[geothermal heating]], [[heat pump]]s and [[central solar heating]] are also used, as well as [[nuclear power]]. District heating plants can provide higher efficiencies and better pollution control than localized boilers. According to some research, district heating with combined heat and power (CHPDH) is the cheapest method of cutting carbon emissions, and has one of the lowest carbon footprints of all fossil generation plants.&lt;ref name="claverton-energy.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.claverton-energy.com/carbon-footprints-of-various-sources-of-heat-chpdh-comes-out-lowest.html |title=Carbon footprints of various sources of heat – CHPDH comes out lowest &amp;#124; Claverton Group |publisher=Claverton-energy.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; A combination of CHP and centralized heat pumps are used in the Stockholm multi energy system. This allows the production of heat through electricity when there is an abundance of intermittent power production and cogeneration of electric power and district heating when the availability of intermittent power production is low.&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"&gt;{{cite journal | title = CHP and heat pumps to balance renewable power production: Lessons from the district heating network in Stockholm | journal = Energy | volume = | issue = | pages = | year =2017 | url =http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S036054421730124X | accessdate = 2017-03-15 | DOI=10.1016/j.energy.2017.01.118 | author1 =Levihn, Fabian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
District heating traces its roots to the hot water-heated baths and greenhouses of the ancient [[Roman Empire]]. Usually, a hot water distribution system in [[Chaudes-Aigues]] in France is regarded as the first real district heating system. It used geothermal energy to provide heat for about 30 houses and started operation in the 14th century.&lt;ref name="Mazhar 2018"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mazhar |first1=Abdul Rehman et al. |last2= |first2= |date=2018 |title=a state of art review on district heating systems |url= |journal=[[Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews]] |volume=96 |issue= |pages=420-439 |doi=10.1016/j.rser.2018.08.005 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[U.S. Naval Academy]] in [[Annapolis]] began [[steam]] district heating service in 1853.

Although these and numerous other systems have operated over the centuries, the first commercially successful district heating system was launched in [[Lockport (town), New York|Lockport]], [[New York (state)|New York]], in 1877 by American hydraulic engineer [[Birdsill Holly]], considered the founder of modern district heating.

=== Generations of district heating ===
[[File:Generations of district heating systems EN.svg|thumb|The four different generations of district heating systems and their energy sources]]
Generally, 4 different generations of district heating systems can be distinguished. 

==== First Generation ==== 
The first generation was a steam-based system fueled by [[coal]] and was first introduced in the US in the 1880s and became popular in some European countries, too. It was state of the art until the 1930s and used concrete ducts, operated with very high temperatures and was therefore not very efficient. There were also problems with reliability and safety due to the hot pressurised steam tubes. Nowadays, this generation is technologically outdated. However, some of these systems are still in use, for example in New York or Paris. Other systems originally built have subsequently been converted to later generations.&lt;ref name="Lund 2014"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=[[Henrik Lund (academic)|Lund]] |first1=Henrik et al. |last2= |first2= |date=2014 |title=4th Generation District Heating (4GDH): Integrating smart thermal grids into future sustainable energy systems |url= |journal=[[Energy (journal)|Energy]] |volume=68 |issue= |pages=1-11 |doi=10.1016/j.energy.2014.02.089 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==== Second Generation ====
The second generation was developed in the 1930s and was built until the 1970s. It burned coal and oil, the energy was transmitted through pressurised hot water as heat carrier. The systems usually had supply temperatures above 100 °C, used water pipes in concrete ducts, mostly assembled on site, and heavy equipment. A main reason for these systems were the primary energy savings, which arose from using combined heat and power plants. While also used in other countries, typical systems of this generation were the sovjet-style district heating systems that were built after WW2 in several countries in Eastern Europe.&lt;ref name="Lund 2014" /&gt;  

==== Third Generation ====
In the 1970s the third generation was developed and was subsequently used in most of the following systems all over the world. This generation is also called the “Scandinavian district heating technology”, because a lot of the district heating component manufacturers are based in Scandinavia. The third generation uses prefabricated, pre-insulated pipes, which are directly buried into the ground and operates with lower temperatures, usually below 100°C. A primary motivation for building these systems was security of supply by improving the [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] after the two oil crises led to disruption of the oil supply. Therefore those systems usually used coal, biomass and waste as energy sources, while oil was mostly neglected. In some system also [[geothermal energy]] and [[solar energy]] are used in the energy mix of those systems.&lt;ref name="Lund 2014" /&gt; For example Paris has been using [[geothermal heating]] from a 55-70&amp;nbsp;°C source 1–2&amp;nbsp;km below the surface since the 1970s for domestic heating.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|title=Structure|url=http://www.bbm.me.uk/portsdown/PH_450_Energy.htm|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061218081732/http://www.bbm.me.uk/portsdown/PH_450_Energy.htm|archivedate=2006-12-18|df=}} 080304 bbm.me.uk&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Fourth Generation ====
Currently, the 4th generation is being developed&lt;ref name="Lund 2014" /&gt;, with the transition to 4th generation already in process in [[Denmark]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Yang |first1=Xiaochen et al. |last2= |first2= |date=2016 |title=Energy, economy and exergy evaluations of the solutions for supplying domestic hot water from low-temperature district heating in Denmark |url= |journal=[[Energy Conversion and Management]] |volume=122 |issue= |pages=142-152 |doi=10.1016/j.enconman.2016.05.057 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 4th generation is designed to combat climate change and integrate high shares of variable renewable energy into the district heating by providing high flexibility to the electricity system.&lt;ref name="Lund 2014" /&gt;

According to the review by Lund et al.&lt;ref name="Lund 2014" /&gt; those systems have to have the following abilities:
* "1. Ability to supply low-temperature district heating for space heating and domestic hot water (DHW) to existing buildings, energy-renovated existing buildings and new low-energy buildings."
* "2. Ability to distribute heat in networks with low grid losses."
* "3. Ability to recycle heat from low-temperature sources and integrate renewable heat sources such as solar and geothermal heat."
* "4. Ability to be an integrated part of smart energy systems (i.e. integrated smart electricity, gas, fluid and thermal grids) including being an integrated part of 4th Generation District Cooling systems."
* "5. Ability to ensure suitable planning, cost and motivation structures in relation to the operation as well as to strategic investments related to the transformation into future sustainable energy systems".

Compared to the previous generations the temperature levels have been reduced to increase the energy efficiency of the system, with supply side temperatures of 70°C and lower. Potential heat sources are waste heat from industry, CHP plants burning waste, [[Bioenergy|biomass power plants]], geothermal and solarthermal energy ([[central solar heating]]), large scale [[heat pump]]s, waste heat from cooling purposes and [[data center]]s and other sustainable energy sources. With those energy sources and large scale [[thermal energy storage]], including [[seasonal thermal energy storage]], 4th generation district heating systems are expected to provide flexibility for balancing [[Wind power|wind]] and [[solar power]] generation, for example by using heat pumps to integrate surplus power as heat when there is much wind energy or providing electricity by biomass plants when back-up power is needed.&lt;ref name="Lund 2014" /&gt; Therefore, large scale heat pumps are regarded as a key technology for smart energy systems with high shares of [[renewable energy]] up to 100 % and advanced 4th generation district heating systems.&lt;ref name="David"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=David |first1=Andrei et al |last2= |first2= |date=2018 |title=Heat Roadmap Europe: Large-Scale Electric Heat Pumps in District Heating Systems |url= |journal=[[Energies]] |volume=10 |issue= |pages=578 |doi=10.3390/en10040578 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lund 2014" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sayegh |first1=M.A. et al. |last2= |first2= |date=2018 |title=Heat pump placement, connection and operational modes in European district heating |url= |journal=Energy and Buildings |volume=166 |issue= |pages=122-144 |doi=10.1016/j.enbuild.2018.02.006 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Heat generation==
Heat sources in use for various district heating systems include: power plants designed for [[combined heat and power]] (CHP, also called co-generation), including both combustion and nuclear power plants; and simple combustion of a fossil fuel or biomass; geothermal heat; solar heat; industrial heat pumps which extract heat from seawater, river or lake water, sewage, or waste heat from industrial processes.

===District heat from combined heat and power or simple combustion===
The core element of many district heating systems is a [[heat-only boiler station]]. Additionally a [[cogeneration]] plant (also called [[combined heat and power]], CHP) is often added in parallel with the boilers. Both have in common that they are typically based on combustion of primary energy carriers. The difference between the two systems is that, in a cogeneration plant, heat and electricity are generated simultaneously, whereas in heat-only boiler stations – as the name suggests – only heat is generated.

In the case of a fossil fueled cogeneration plant, the heat output is typically sized to meet half of the peak heat load but over the year will provide 90% of the heat supplied. The boiler capacity will be able to meet the entire heat demand unaided and can cover for breakdowns in the cogeneration plant. It is not economic to size the cogeneration plant alone to be able to meet the full heat load. In the [[New York City steam system]], that is around 2.5 GW.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Newsroom: Steam|publisher=ConEdison| url =http://www.coned.com/newsroom/energysystems_steam.asp| accessdate =2007-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Bevelhymer |first=Carl |title=Steam |publisher=Gotham Gazette |date=2003-11-10 |url=http://www.gothamgazette.com/article/issueoftheweek/20031110/200/674 |accessdate=2007-07-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070813013416/http://www.gothamgazette.com/article/issueoftheweek/20031110/200/674 |archivedate=2007-08-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Germany has the largest amount of CHP in Europe&lt;!--20-30 GW--&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cogeneurope.eu/what-is-cogeneration_19.html What is cogeneration?] ''COGEN Europe'', 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

The combination of cogeneration and district heating is very [[efficient energy use|energy efficient]]. A simple [[thermal power station]] can be 20–35% efficient,&lt;ref name="energy.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fossil.energy.gov/programs/powersystems/turbines/turbines_howitworks.html |title=DOE – Fossil Energy: How Turbine Power Plants Work |publisher=Fossil.energy.gov |date= |accessdate=2011-09-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110812012523/http://fossil.energy.gov/programs/powersystems/turbines/turbines_howitworks.html |archivedate=August 12, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas a more advanced facility with the ability to recover waste heat can reach total energy efficiency of nearly 80%.&lt;ref name="energy.gov"/&gt; Some may exceed 100% based on the [[lower heating value]] by condensing the flue gas as well.&lt;ref name="Amager Bakke"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://stateofgreen.com/en/profiles/ramboll/solutions/waste-to-energy-chp-amager-bakke-copenhagen|title=Waste-to-Energy CHP Amager Bakke Copenhagen|accessdate=2015-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Waste heat from nuclear power plants is sometimes used for district heating. The principles for a conventional combination of cogeneration and district heating applies the same for nuclear as it does for a [[thermal power station]]. Russia has several cogeneration nuclear plants which together provided 11.4 PJ of district heat in 2005. Russian nuclear district heating is planned to nearly triple within a decade as new plants are built.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.world-nuclear.org/info/inf45.html |title=Nuclear Power in Russia |publisher=World-nuclear.org |date=2011-09-21 |accessdate=2011-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other nuclear-powered heating from cogeneration plants are in Ukraine, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Bulgaria, and Switzerland, producing up to about 100&amp;nbsp;MW per power station. One use of nuclear heat generation was with the [[Ågesta Nuclear Power Plant]] in Sweden closed in 1974.

In Switzerland, the [[Beznau Nuclear Power Plant]] provides heat to about 20,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;SUGIYAMA KEN'ICHIRO (Hokkaido Univ.) et al.

===Geothermal-sourced district heat===
{{Expand section|date=May 2013}}
;History
Geothermal district heating was used in [[Pompeii]], and in [[Chaudes-Aigues]] since the 14th Century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |first=R. Gordon |last=Bloomquist |lay-url=https://pangea.stanford.edu/ERE/db/IGAstandard/record_detail.php?id=5313 |title=Geothermal District Energy System Analysis, Design, and Development |publisher=International Geothermal Association |conference=International Summer School |year=2001 |access-date=November 28, 2015 |lay-source=Stanford University |quote=During Roman times, warm water was circulated through open trenches to provide heating for buildings and baths in Pompeii. |url=http://www.geothermal-energy.org/pdf/IGAstandard/ISS/2001Romania/bloomquist_dh.pdf |page=213(1) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''United States'''

Direct use geothermal district heating systems, which tap geothermal reservoirs and distribute the hot water to multiple buildings for a variety of uses, are uncommon in the United States, but have existed in America for over a century.

In 1890, the first wells were drilled to access a hot water resource outside of Boise, Idaho. In 1892, after routing the water to homes and businesses in the area via a wooden pipeline, the first geothermal district heating system was created.

As of a 2007 study,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Thorsteinsson|first1=Hildigunnur|title=U.S. Geothermal District Heating: Barriers and Enablers|url=http://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/42932/251518357.pdf|accessdate=25 July 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140809070925/http://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/42932/251518357.pdf|archivedate=9 August 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; there were 22 geothermal district heating systems (GDHS) in the United States. As of 2010, two of those systems have shut down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lund|first1=John|title=The United States of America Country Update 2010|url=https://pangea.stanford.edu/ERE/pdf/IGAstandard/SGW/2010/lund.pdf|accessdate=25 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The table below describes the 20 GDHS currently operational in America.

===Heat pumps for district heat===
In Stockholm, the first heat pump was installed in 1977 to deliver district heating sourced from IBM servers. Today the installed capacity is about 660 MW heat, utilizing treated sewage water, sea water, district cooling, data centers and grocery stores as heat sources.&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"/&gt; Another example is the [[Drammen Heat Pump|Drammen Fjernvarme District Heating project]] in Norway which produces 14 MW from water at just 8&amp;nbsp;°C, industrial heat pumps are demonstrated heat sources for district heating networks. Among the ways that industrial heat pumps can be utilized are:

# As the primary base load source where water from a low grade source of heat, e.g. a river, fjord, [[data center]], power station outfall, sewage treatment works outfall (all typically between 0&amp;nbsp;˚C and 25&amp;nbsp;˚C), is boosted up to the network temperature of typically 60&amp;nbsp;˚C to 90&amp;nbsp;˚C using [[heat pump]]s. These devices, although consuming electricity, will transfer a heat output three to six times larger than the amount of electricity consumed. An example of a district system using a heat pump to source heat from raw sewage is in Oslo, Norway that has a heat output of 18 MW(thermal).&lt;ref&gt;Pedersen, S. &amp; Stene, J. (2006). [http://www.heatpumpcentre.org/en/newsletter/previous/Documents/HPC-news_4_2006.htm 18 MW heat pump system in Norway utilises untreated sewage as heat source]. IEA Heat Pump Centre Newsletter, 24:4, 37–38.&lt;/ref&gt;
# As a means of recovering heat from the cooling loop of a power plant to increase either the level of flue gas heat recovery (as the district heating plant return pipe is now cooled by the heat pump) or by cooling the closed steam loop and artificially lowering the condensing pressure and thereby increasing the electricity generation efficiency.
# As a means of cooling flue gas scrubbing working fluid (typically water) from 60&amp;nbsp;˚C post-injection to 20&amp;nbsp;˚C pre-injection temperatures. Heat is recovered using a heat pump and can be sold and injected into the network side of the facility at a much higher temperature (e.g. about 80&amp;nbsp;˚C).
# Where the network has reached capacity, large individual load users can be decoupled from the hot feed pipe, say 80&amp;nbsp;˚C and coupled to the return pipe, at e.g. 40&amp;nbsp;˚C. By adding a heat pump locally to this user, the 40&amp;nbsp;˚C pipe is cooled further (the heat being delivered into the heat pump evaporator). The output from the heat pump is then a dedicated loop for the user at 40&amp;nbsp;˚C to 70&amp;nbsp;˚C. Therefore, the overall network capacity has changed as the total temperature difference of the loop has varied from 80–40&amp;nbsp;˚C to 80&amp;nbsp;˚C–x (x being a value lower than 40&amp;nbsp;˚C).

Concerns have existed about the use of hydroflurocarbons as the working fluid (refrigerant) for large heat pumps. Whilst leakage is not usually measured, it is generally reported to be relatively low, such as 1% (compared to 25% for supermarket cooling systems). A 30-megawatt heatpump could therefore leak (annually) around 75&amp;nbsp;kg of R134a or other working fluid.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Given the high [[global warming potential]] of some HFCs, this could equate to over {{convert|800000|km|mi}} of car travel per year.{{Citation needed|date = February 2016|reason = Not in the Norwegian case study report. Maybe in another source?}}

However, recent technical advances allow the use of natural heat pump refrigerants that have very low global warming potential (GWP). CO2 refrigerant (R744, GWP=1) or ammonia (R717, GWP=0) also have the benefit, depending on operating conditions, of resulting in higher heat pump efficiency than conventional refrigerants. An example is a 14 MW(thermal) district heating network in [[Drammen, Norway]] which is supplied by seawater-source heatpumps that use R717 refrigerant, and has been operating since 2011. 90&amp;nbsp;°C water is delivered to the district loop (and returns at 65&amp;nbsp;°C). Heat is extracted from seawater (from {{convert|60|ft|m|adj=on}} depth) that is 8 to 9&amp;nbsp;°C all year round, giving an average coefficient of performance (COP) of about 3.15. In the process the seawater is chilled to 4&amp;nbsp;°C; however, this resource is not utilized. In a district system where the chilled water could be utilized for air conditioning, the effective COP would be considerably higher.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Hoffman, &amp; Pearson, D. 2011. [http://www.ammonia21.com/web/assets/link/Hoffman7thApril2011London%20colour.pdf Ammonia heat pumps for district heating in Norway 7 – a case study] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203054940/http://www.ammonia21.com/web/assets/link/Hoffman7thApril2011London%20colour.pdf |date=2013-12-03 }}. Presented at Institute of Refrigeration, 7 April, London.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the future, industrial [[heat pump]]s will be further de-carbonised by using, on one side, excess renewable electrical energy (otherwise spilled due to meeting of grid demand) from wind, solar, etc. and, on the other side, by making more of renewable heat sources (lake and ocean heat, geothermal, etc.). Furthermore, higher efficiency can be expected through operation on the high voltage network.&lt;ref&gt;http://setis.ec.europa.eu/system/files/JRCDistrictheatingandcooling.pdf Combined Heat and Power and District Heating report. Joint Research Centre, Petten, under contract to European Commission, DG Energy 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

====Excess renewable electrical energy for district heat====
With European countries such as Germany and Denmark moving to very high levels (80% and 100% respectively by 2050) of renewable energy for all energy uses there will be increasing periods of excess production of renewable electrical energy. Storage of this energy as potential electrical energy (e.g. pumped hydro) is very costly and reduces total round-trip efficiency. However, storing it as heat in district heating systems, for use in buildings where there is demand, is significantly less costly. Whilst the quality of the electrical energy is degraded, high voltage grid MW sized heat pumps would maximise efficiency whilst not wasting excess renewable electricity.&lt;ref&gt;DYRELUND Anders, Ramboll, 2010. [http://www.ramboll.com/~/media/Files/RGR/Documents/Documents/Heat-Plan-Denmark-2010-final.ashx Heat Plan Denmark 2010]. .&lt;/ref&gt; Such coupling of the electricity sector with the heating sector ([[Power-to-X]]) is regarded as a key factor for energy systems with high shares of renewable energy, because it allows storage to be used mainly in form of cheap heat storage. Therefore the usage of rather expensive electricity storage can be minimized, as the heat sector balances the variable production of renewable energy sources with flexible loads and heat storage.&lt;ref name="Lund 2017"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=[[Henrik Lund (academic)|Lund]] |first1=Henrik et al. |last2= |first2= |date=2017 |title=Smart energy and smart energy systems |url= |journal=[[Energy (journal)|Energy]] |volume=137 |issue= |pages=556-565 |doi=10.1016/j.energy.2017.05.123 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stockholm at present has about 660 MW of heat pumps connected to its district heating system.&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"/&gt;

==== Cold district heating ====
Heat pumps can also be used at the consumer-side instead of an substation, especially in so called cold district heating systems. These systems operate at very low temperature (about 10 to 25 °C) and can be used both for heating and cooling. Hot water and space heating is provided by heat pumps, which use the cold district heating system as heat source. The system itself can be fed by various (low-temperature) heat sources including ambient heat, ambient water from rivers, lakes, sea or lagoons, and waste heat from industrial or commercial sources.&lt;ref name="Pellegrini"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Pellegrini |first1=Marco |last2=Bianchini |first2=Augusto |date=2018 |title=The Innovative Concept of Cold District Heating Networks: A Literature Review |url= |journal=[[Energies]] |volume=11 |issue= |pages=236pp |doi=10.3390/en11010236 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Heat accumulators and storage==
[[File:Fernwärmespricher Theiss.JPG|thumb|right|District heating accumulation tower from Theiss near [[Krems an der Donau]] in [[Lower Austria]] with a thermal capacity of {{convert|2|GW.h|TJ}}]]
Increasingly large [[Thermal energy storage|heat stores]] are being used with district heating networks to maximise efficiency and financial returns. This allows cogeneration units to be run at times of maximum electrical tariff, the electrical production having much higher rates of return than heat production, whilst storing the excess heat production. It also allows solar heat to be collected in summer and redistributed off season in very large but relatively low-cost in-ground insulated reservoirs or borehole systems. The expected heat loss at the 203,000m³ insulated pond in [[Vojens]] is about 8%.&lt;ref name=ing2015-06-14/&gt;

==Heat distribution==
[[File:Heatpipe tunnel copenhagen 2009.jpg|thumb|Underground tunnel for heat pipes between [[Rigshospitalet]] and [[Amagerværket]] in Denmark]]
[[File:Pre-installation insulated underground pipes for district heating.jpg|thumb|Insulated pipes to connect a new building to [[University of Warwick]]'s campus-wide [[combined heat and power]] system]]

[[File:Waerme Schulung CRC Wn 040.jpg|thumb|upright|[[District heating substation]] with a thermal power of 700 kW which insulates the water circuit of the district heating system and the customer's central heating system]]

After generation, the heat is distributed to the customer via a network of [[insulated pipe]]s. District heating systems consist of feed and return lines. Usually the pipes are installed underground but there are also systems with overground pipes. Within the system [[thermal energy storage|heat storage]] units may be installed to even out peak load demands.

The common medium used for heat distribution is water or [[pressurized hot water]], but [[steam]] is also used. The advantage of steam is that in addition to heating purposes it can be used in [[industrial process]]es due to its higher temperature. The disadvantage of steam is a higher heat loss due to the high temperature. Also, the [[thermal efficiency]] of cogeneration plants is significantly lower if the cooling medium is high-temperature steam, reducing [[electric power]] generation. Heat transfer oils are generally not used for district heating, although they have higher heat capacities than water, as they are expensive and have environmental issues.

At customer level the heat network is usually connected to the [[central heating]] system of the dwellings via [[heat exchanger]]s ([[district heating substation|heat substations]]): the working fluids of both networks (generally water or steam) do not mix. However, direct connection is used in the [[Odense]] system.

Typical annual loss of thermal energy through distribution is around 10%, as seen in Norway's district heating network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nve.no/global/energi/analyser/energi%20i%20norge%20folder/energy%20in%20norway%202009%20edition.pdf |title=Norwegian Water Resources and Energy Directorate |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-09-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110928144652/http://www.nve.no/global/energi/analyser/energi%20i%20norge%20folder/energy%20in%20norway%202009%20edition.pdf |archivedate=2011-09-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Heat metering==
The amount of heat provided to customers is often recorded with a [[heat meter]] to encourage conservation and maximize the number of customers which can be served, but such meters are expensive. Due to the expense of heat metering, an alternative approach is simply to meter the water – water meters are much cheaper than heat meters, and have the advantage of encouraging consumers to extract as much heat as possible, leading to a very low return temperature, which increases the efficiency of power generation.{{Citation needed|date = February 2016}}

Many systems were installed under a [[Socialism|socialist]] economy (such as in the former [[Eastern Bloc]]) which lacked heat metering and means to adjust the heat delivery to each apartment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ft.com/content/02254fda-4966-11e4-8d68-00144feab7de|title=EU warms to the potential efficiencies of district heating|last=Oliver|first=Christian|date=October 22, 2014|work=Financial Times|access-date=2018-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|year=2011|institution=Mikkeli University of Applied Sciences|url=https://www.theseus.fi/bitstream/handle/10024/25777/DISTRICT_HEATING_SYSTEMS_IN_FINLAND_AND_RUSSIA.pdf|title=District Heating Systems in Finland and Russia|author=Kirill Eliseev}}&lt;/ref&gt; This led to great inefficiencies – users had to simply open windows when too hot – wasting energy and minimising the numbers of connectable customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/cities/2015/apr/13/warsaw-district-heating-system-poland-capital-cleaner-krakow|title=How Warsaw's district heating system keeps the capital cleaner than Kraków|last=Warsaw|first=Beth Gardiner in|date=2015-04-13|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Size of systems==
District heating systems can vary in size. Some systems cover entire cities such as [[Stockholm]] or [[Flensburg]], using a network of large 1000&amp;nbsp;mm diameter primary pipes linked to secondary pipes – 200&amp;nbsp;mm diameter perhaps, which in turn link to tertiary pipes of perhaps 25&amp;nbsp;mm diameter which might connect to 10 to 50 houses.

Some district heating schemes might only be sized to meet the needs of a small village or area of a city in which case only the secondary and tertiary pipes will be needed.

Some schemes may be designed to serve only a limited number of dwellings – 20–50 – in which case only tertiary sized pipes are needed.

==Pros and cons==
District heating has various advantages compared to individual heating systems. Usually district heating is more energy efficient, due to simultaneous production of heat and electricity in [[combined heat and power]] generation plants. This has the added benefit of reducing [[carbon emissions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dunne|first=Eimear|title=Infographic explaining District Heating Systems|url=http://frontlineenergy.ie/district-energy-infographic/|work=Frontline Energy &amp; Environmental|accessdate=5 May 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140505123952/http://frontlineenergy.ie/district-energy-infographic/|archivedate=5 May 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The larger combustion units also have a more advanced [[flue gas]] cleaning than single boiler systems. In the case of surplus heat from industries, district heating systems do not use additional fuel because they recover heat which would otherwise be dispersed to the environment.

District heating requires a long-term financial commitment that fits poorly with a focus on short-term returns on investment. Benefits to the community include avoided costs of energy through the use of surplus and wasted heat energy, and reduced investment in individual household or building heating equipment. District heating networks, heat-only boiler stations, and cogeneration plants require high initial capital expenditure and financing. Only if considered as long-term investments will these translate into profitable operations for the owners of district heating systems, or combined heat and power plant operators. District heating is less attractive for areas with low population densities, as the investment per household is considerably higher. Also it is less attractive in areas of many small buildings; e.g. detached houses than in areas with a fewer larger buildings; e.g. blocks of flats, because each connection to a single-family house is quite expensive.

Individual heating systems can be completely shutdown intermittently according to local heating demand which is not the case with a district heating system.

==Ownership, monopoly issues and charging structures==
In many cases large combined heat and power district heating schemes are owned by a single entity. This was typically the case in the old Eastern bloc countries. However, for many schemes, the ownership of the cogeneration plant is separate from the heat using part.

Examples are Warsaw which has such split ownership with PGNiG Termika owning the cogeneration unit, the Dalkia Polska owning 85% of the heat distribution, the rest of the heat distribution is owned by municipality and workers. Similarly all the large CHP/CH schemes in Denmark are of split ownership.

Sweden provides an alternative example where the heating market is deregulated. In Sweden it is most common that the ownership of the district heating network is not separated from the ownership of the cogeneration plants, the district cooling network or the centralized heat pumps. There are also examples where the competition has spawned parallel networks and interconnected networks where multiple utilities cooperate.

In the United Kingdom there have been complaints that district heating companies have too much of a monopoly and are insufficiently regulated,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-39736010 Green heating system accused of causing 'fuel poverty'] ''[[BBC]]''&lt;/ref&gt; an issue the industry is aware of, and has taken steps to improve consumer experience through the use of customer charters as set out by the heat trust. Some customers are taking legal action against the supplier for Misrepresentation &amp; Unfair Trading, claiming district Heating is delivering the savings promised by many heat suppliers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-39736010|title=Green scheme 'causing fuel poverty'|first1=Nicola|last1=Dowling|first2=Adrian|last2=Goldberg|date=30 April 2017|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2018|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==National variation==
Since conditions from city to city differ, every district heating system is unique. In addition, nations have different access to primary energy carriers and so they have a different approach on how to address heating markets within their borders.

===Europe===
Since 1954, district heating has been promoted in Europe by Euroheat &amp; Power. They have compiled an analysis of district heating and cooling markets in Europe within their [[Ecoheatcool]] project supported by the [[European Commission]]. A separate study, entitled Heat Roadmap Europe, has indicated that district heating can reduce the price of energy in the European Union between now and 2050.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vbn.aau.dk/en/publications/heat-roadmap-europe-2050(306a5052-a882-4af9-a5da-87efa36efeaa).html|title=Heat Roadmap Europe 2: Second Pre-Study for the EU27|first1=David|last1=Connolly|first2=Brian Vad|last2=Mathiesen|first3=Poul Alberg|last3=Østergaard|first4=Bernd|last4=Möller|first5=Steffen|last5=Nielsen|first6=Henrik|last6=Lund|first7=Urban|last7=Persson|first8=Sven|last8=Werner|first9=Jan|last9=Grözinger|first10=Thomas|last10=Boermans|first11=Michelle|last11=Bosquet|first12=Daniel|last12=Trier|date=27 May 2013|publisher=Department of Development and Planning, Aalborg University|accessdate=18 March 2018|via=vbn.aau.dk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legal framework in the member states of the [[European Union]] is currently influenced by the EU's [[CHP Directive]].

===Cogeneration in Europe===
The EU has actively incorporated cogeneration into its energy policy via the [[CHP Directive]]. In September 2008 at a hearing of the European Parliament's Urban Lodgment Intergroup, Energy Commissioner Andris Piebalgs is quoted as saying, "security of supply really starts with energy efficiency."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cogeneurope.eu/Downloadables/Publications/230908_Energy_Efficiency_Industrial_Forum_Security_of_Supply.pdf |title=Energy Efficiency Industrial Forum Position Paper: energy efficiency – a vital component of energy security }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Energy efficiency and cogeneration are recognized in the opening paragraphs of the European Union's Cogeneration Directive 2004/08/EC. This directive intends to support cogeneration and establish a method for calculating cogeneration abilities per country. The development of cogeneration has been very uneven over the years and has been dominated throughout the last decades by national circumstances.

As a whole, the European Union currently generates 11% of its electricity using cogeneration, saving Europe an estimated 35 Mtoe per annum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cogeneurope.eu/news.htm |title=COGEN Europe News |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090101121334/http://www.cogeneurope.eu/news.htm |archivedate=2009-01-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are large differences between the member states, with energy savings ranging from 2% to 60%. Europe has the three countries with the world's most intensive cogeneration economies: Denmark, the Netherlands and Finland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cogeneurope.eu/Downloadables/Publications/Cogeneration_Europe_Draft_paper_on_Security_of_Supply_in_EU_energy_policy.pdf |title=COGEN Europe: Cogeneration in the European Union's Energy Supply Security }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other European countries are also making great efforts to increase their efficiency. Germany reports that over 50% of the country's total electricity demand could be provided through cogeneration. Germany set a target to double its electricity cogeneration from 12.5% of the country's electricity to 25% by 2020 and has passed supporting legislation accordingly in "Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology", (BMWi), Germany, August 2007. The UK is also actively supporting district heating. In the light of UK's goal to achieve an 80% reduction in carbon dioxide emissions by 2050, the government had set a target to source at least 15% of government electricity from CHP by 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/climatechange/uk/energy/chp/index.htm |title=DEFRA Action in the UK – Combined Heat and Power |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100612100647/http://www.defra.gov.uk/environment/climatechange/uk/energy/chp/index.htm |archivedate=2010-06-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other UK measures to encourage CHP growth are financial incentives, grant support, a greater regulatory framework, and government leadership and partnership.

According to the IEA 2008 modelling of cogeneration expansion for the G8 countries, expansion of cogeneration in France, Germany, Italy and the UK alone would effectively double the existing primary fuel savings by 2030. This would increase Europe's savings from today's 155 TWh to 465 TWh in 2030. It would also result in a 16% to 29% increase in each country's total cogenerated electricity by 2030.

Governments are being assisted in their CHP endeavors by organizations like [[COGEN Europe]] who serve as an information hub for the most recent updates within Europe's energy policy. COGEN is Europe's umbrella organization representing the interests of the cogeneration industry, users of the technology and promoting its benefits in the EU and the wider Europe. The association is backed by the key players in the industry including gas and electricity companies, ESCOs, equipment suppliers, consultancies, national promotion organisations, financial and other service companies.

A 2016 EU energy strategy suggests increased use of district heating.&lt;ref&gt;https://ec.europa.eu/transparency/regdoc/rep/1/2016/EN/1-2016-51-EN-F1-1.PDF&lt;/ref&gt;

====Austria====
[[File:Biomassekraftwerk mit Lager.jpg|thumb|right|The District Heating Power Plant Steyr is a renewable combined heat and power plant in which wood chips are used to generate power&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fernwaermesteyr.at/waerme_steyr/page/790213410858496064_790686873558106026~790686753835892434_790686753835892434,de.html|title=Bioenergie Steyr|first=Fernwärme|last=Steyr|date=|website=www.fernwaermesteyr.at|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The largest district heating system in Austria is in [[Vienna]] (Fernwärme Wien) – with many smaller systems distributed over the whole country.

District heating in Vienna is run by Wien Energie. In the business year of 2004/2005 a total of 5.163&amp;nbsp;GWh was sold, 1.602&amp;nbsp;GWh to 251.224 private apartments and houses and 3.561&amp;nbsp;GWh to 5211 major customers. The three large municipal waste [[incineration|incinerators]] provide 22% of the total in producing 116&amp;nbsp;GWh electric power and 1.220&amp;nbsp;GWh heat. Waste heat from municipal power plants and large industrial plants account for 72% of the total. The remaining 6% is produced by peak heating boilers from fossil fuel. A biomass-fired power plant has produced heat since 2006.

In the rest of Austria the newer district heating plants are constructed as biomass plants or as CHP-biomass plants like the [[w:de:Biomasseheizkraftwerk Mödling|biomass district heating of Mödling]] or the [[w:de:Biomasseheizkraftwerk Baden|biomass district heating of Baden]].

Most of the older fossil-fired district heating systems have a [[w:de:Fernwärmespeicher|district heating accumulator]], so that it is possible to produce the thermal district heating power only at that time where the electric power price is high.

====Bulgaria====
Bulgaria has district heating in around a dozen towns and cities. The largest system is in the capital [[Sofia]], where there are four power plants (two [[cogeneration|CHP]]s and two [[heat-only boiler station|boiler station]]s) providing heat to the majority of the city. The system dates back to 1949.&lt;sup&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120119073404/http://www.toplo.bg/za_nas/istoria]&lt;/sup&gt;

====Czech Republic====
The largest district heating system in the [[Czech Republic]] is in Prague owned and operated by Pražská teplárenská, serving 265,000 households and selling c. 13 PJ of heat annually. Most of the heat is actually produced as [[waste heat]] in 30&amp;nbsp;km distant [[thermal power station]] in [[Mělník]]. There are many smaller central heating systems spread around the country&lt;ref name=tscr&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tscr.cz|title=Teplárenské sdružení ČR - sdružuje teplárny a podnikatele v teplárenství a energetice|first=Teplárenské sdružení České republiky -|last=www.tscr.cz|date=|website=www.tscr.cz|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; including waste heat usage, [[municipal waste]] [[incineration]] and [[:de:Heizkraftwerk|heat plants]].

====Denmark====
In Denmark district heating covers more than 64% of [[space heating]] and [[water heating]].&lt;ref name=danskfjernvarme_stats /&gt; In 2007, 80.5% of this heat was produced by [[combined heat and power]] plants. Heat recovered from [[incineration|waste incineration]] accounted for 20.4% of the total Danish district heat production.&lt;ref&gt;[https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20110310035158/http://www.ens.dk/graphics/UK_Facts_Figures/Statistics/yearly_statistics/2007/energy%20statistics%202007%20uk.pdf Danish Energy Statistics 2007] by the Danish Ministry of Energy (in Danish).&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Denmark imported 158,000 ton waste for incineration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.danskfjernvarme.dk/nyheder/presseklip/151127klimaraad-affaldsimport-vil-belaste-dansk-co2regnskab Klimaråd: Affaldsimport vil belaste dansk CO2-regnskab] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151128144041/http://www.danskfjernvarme.dk/nyheder/presseklip/151127klimaraad-affaldsimport-vil-belaste-dansk-co2regnskab |date=2015-11-28 }} 27 November 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Most major cities in Denmark have big district heating networks, including transmission networks operating with up to 125&amp;nbsp;°C and 25 bar pressure and distribution networks operating with up to 95&amp;nbsp;°C and between 6 and 10 bar pressure. The largest district heating system in Denmark is in the [[Copenhagen]] area operated by CTR I/S and VEKS I/S. In central Copenhagen, the CTR network serves 275,000 households (90-95% of the area's population) through a network of 54&amp;nbsp;km double district heating distribution pipes providing a peak capacity of 663&amp;nbsp;MW.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ctr.dk/images/publikationer/3folder2006.pdf Environmentally Friendly District Heating to Greater Copenhagen] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071129121423/http://www.ctr.dk/images/publikationer/3folder2006.pdf |date=November 29, 2007 }}, publication by [http://www.ctr.dk CTR I/S] (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; The consumer price of heat from CTR is approximately €49 per&amp;nbsp;MWh plus taxes (2009).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ke.dk/portal/page/portal/Privat/Varme/Prisen_paa_fjernvarme?page=221 Prisen på Fjernvarme]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719131304/http://www.ke.dk/portal/page/portal/Privat/Varme/Prisen_paa_fjernvarme?page=221 |date=July 19, 2011 }}, price list from the Danish homepage of a Copenhagen district heating provider [http://www.ke.dk Københavns Energi]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040611164451/http://www.ke.dk/ |date=June 11, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Danish island of [[Samsø]] has three straw-fueled plants producing district heating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dac.dk/en/dac-cities/sustainable-cities/all-cases/energy/samsoe-a-role-model-in-self-sufficiency/|title=Network - DAC|author=|date=|website=dac.dk|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Finland====
In Finland district heating accounts for about 50% of the total heating market,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energia.fi/en/districtheating/districtheating District heating in Finland] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722000506/http://www.energia.fi/en/districtheating/districtheating |date=July 22, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 80% of which is produced by combined heat and power plants. Over 90% of apartment blocks, more than half of all terraced houses, and the bulk of public buildings and business premises are connected to a district heating network. [[Natural gas]] is mostly used in the south-east gas pipeline network, imported [[coal]] is used in areas close to ports, and [[peat]] is used in northern areas where peat is a natural resource. Other renewables, such as wood chips and other paper industry combustible by-products, are also used, as is the energy recovered by the [[incineration]] of [[municipal solid waste]]. Industrial units which generate heat as an industrial by-product may sell otherwise waste heat to the network rather than release it into the environment. Excess heat and power from [[pulp mill]] [[recovery boiler]]s is a significant source in mill towns. In some towns waste incineration can contribute as much as 8% of the district heating heat requirement. [[Availability]] is 99.98% and disruptions, when they do occur, usually reduce temperatures by only a few degrees.

In Helsinki, an underground [[datacenter]] next to the President's palace releases excess heat into neighboring homes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=data-center-under-helsinki-to-warm-2010-03 |title=In Helsinki |publisher=Scientificamerican.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; producing enough heat to heat approximately 500 large houses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-11128_3-10405955-54.html |title=Underground data center to help heat Helsinki &amp;#124; Green Tech – CNET News |publisher=News.cnet.com |date=2009-11-29 |accessdate=2011-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Germany====
In Germany district heating has a market share of around 14% in the residential buildings sector. The connected heat load is around 52,729&amp;nbsp;MW. The heat comes mainly from cogeneration plants (83%). Heat-only boilers supply 16% and 1% is surplus heat from industry. The cogeneration plants use natural gas (42%), coal (39%), lignite (12%) and waste/others (7%) as fuel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agfw.de/typo3conf/ext/naw_securedl/secure.php?u=0&amp;file=fileadmin/dokumente/wir/Branchenreport_2006/ab2006gesamt_web.pdf&amp;t=1187259422&amp;hash=767cafb4adad1f785f119a86e2ea82c4 AGFW Branchenreport 2006]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927222112/http://www.agfw.de/typo3conf/ext/naw_securedl/secure.php?u=0&amp;file=fileadmin%2Fdokumente%2Fwir%2FBranchenreport_2006%2Fab2006gesamt_web.pdf&amp;t=1187259422&amp;hash=767cafb4adad1f785f119a86e2ea82c4 |date=September 27, 2007 }}, by the German Heat and Power Association [http://www.agfw.de -AGFW-] (in German).&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest district heating network is located in Berlin whereas the highest diffusion of district heating occurs in [[Flensburg]] with around 90% market share. In [[Munich]] about 70% of the electricity produced comes from district heating plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swm.de/english/company/energy-generation/combined-heat-power.html|title=Combined heat and power|author=|date=|website=www.swm.de|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

District heating has rather little legal framework in Germany. There is no law on it as most elements of district heating are regulated in governmental or regional orders. There is no governmental support for district heating networks but a law to support cogeneration plants. As in the European Union the [[CHP Directive]] will come effective, this law probably needs some adjustment.

====Greece====
Greece has district heating mainly in the Province of [[West Macedonia|Western Macedonia]], Central Macedonia and the [[Peloponnese (region)|Peloponnese Province]]. The largest system is the city of [[Ptolemaida]], where there are five power plants ([[thermal power station]]s or TPS in particular) providing heat to the majority of the largest towns and cities of the area and some villages. The first small installation took place in Ptolemaida in 1960, offering heating to [[Proastio, Kozani|Proastio]] village of [[Eordaea]] using the TPS of Ptolemaida. Today District heating installations are also available in [[Kozani]], Ptolemaida, [[Amyntaio]], [[Philotas]], Serres and [[Megalopolis, Greece|Megalopolis]] using nearby power plants. In Serres the power plant is a Hi-Efficiency CHP Plant using natural gas, while coal is the primary fuel for all other district heating networks.

In Italy, district heating is used in some cities ([[Bergamo]], [[Brescia]], [[Cremona]], [[Bolzano]], [[Ferrara]], [[Imola]], [[Reggio Emilia]], [[Terlan]], [[Turin]], [[Lodi, Lombardy|Lodi]], and now [[Milan]]). The district heating of Turin is the biggest of the country and it supplies 550.000 people (62% of the whole city population).

====Norway====
In Norway district heating only constitutes approximately 2% of energy needs for heating. This is a very low number compared to similar countries. One of the main reasons district heating has a low penetration in Norway is access to cheap hydro-based electricity, and 80% of private electricity consumption goes to heat rooms and water. However, there is district heating in the major cities.

====Poland====
In 2009, 40% of Polish households used district heating, most of them in urban areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stat.gov.pl/cps/rde/xbcr/gus/SE_zuzycie_energii_gosp_dom_2009.pdf|title=Zużycie energii w gospodarstwach domowych w 2009 r.|trans-title=Energy consumption in households in 2009|language=Polish|date=2012-05-28|publisher=Główny Urząd Statystyczny|accessdate=2013-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heat is provided primarily by [[combined heat and power]] plants, most of which burn hard coal. The largest district heating system is in Warsaw, owned and operated by Veolia Warszawa, distributing approx. 34 PJ annually.

====Romania====
The largest district heating system in [[Romania]] is in [[Bucharest]]. Owned and operated by [[RADET]], it distributes approximately 24 PJ annually, serving 570 000 households. This corresponds to 68% of Bucharest's total domestic heat requirements (RADET fulfills another 4% through single-building boiler systems, for a total of 72%).

====Russia====
In most Russian cities, district-level [[combined heat and power]] plants ({{lang|ru|ТЭЦ, теплоэлектроцентраль}}) produce more than 50% of the nation's electricity and simultaneously provide hot water for neighbouring city blocks. They mostly use [[coal]] and [[oil]]-powered [[steam turbine]]s for cogeneration of heat. Now, [[gas turbine]]s and [[combined cycle]] designs are beginning to be widely used as well.

====Serbia====
In [[Serbia]], district heating is used throughout the main cities, particularly in the capital, [[Belgrade]]. The first district heating plant was built in 1961 as a means to provide effective heating to the newly built suburbs of [[Novi Beograd]]. Since then, numerous plants have been built to heat the ever-growing city. They use natural gas as fuel, because it has less of an effect on the environment. The district heating system of Belgrade possesses 112 heat sources of 2,454&amp;nbsp;MW capacity, over 500&amp;nbsp;km of pipeline, and 4365 connection stations, providing district heating to 240,000 apartments and 7,500 office/commercial buildings of total floor area exceeding 17,000,000 square meters.{{Citation needed|date = February 2016}}

====Sweden====
Sweden has a long tradition for using district heating in urban areas. In 2015, about 60% of Sweden's houses (private and commercial) were heated by district heating, according to the Swedish association of district heating.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.svenskfjarrvarme.se/Statistik--Pris/] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120418005915/http://www.svenskfjarrvarme.se/Statistik--Pris/ |date=2012-04-18 }} Svensk Fjärrvärme&lt;/ref&gt;
The city of [[Växjö]] reduced its fossil fuel consumption by 30% between 1993 and 2006, and aimed for a 50% reduction by 2010. This was to be achieved largely by way of biomass fired teleheating.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vaxjo.se/Kommun--politik/Om-Vaxjo-/Internationellt/Other-languages/Engelska--English1/Sustainable-development/Fossil-Fuel-Free-Vaxjo/]{{dead link|date=December 2016|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}} Municipality of Växjö&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is the plant of [[Enköping]], combining the use of short rotation plantations both for fuel as well as for phytoremediation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In the United Kingdom, district heating became popular after World War II, but on a restricted scale, to heat the large residential estates that replaced areas devastated by the [[The Blitz|Blitz]]. In 2013 there were 1,765 district heating schemes with 920 based in London alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Summary evidence on District Heating Networks in the UK|url= https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/212565/summary_evidence_district_heating_networks_uk.pdf |publisher=DECC}}&lt;/ref&gt; In total around 210,000 homes and 1,700 businesses are supplied by heat networks in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Future of Heating : Meeting the Challenge|url= https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/190149/16_04-DECC-The_Future_of_Heating_Accessible-10.pdf |publisher=DECC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Pimlico District Heating Undertaking]] (PDHU) first became operational in 1950 and continues to expand to this day. The PDHU once relied on waste heat from the now-disused [[Battersea Power Station]] on the South side of the [[River Thames]]. It is still in operation, the water now being heated locally by a new energy centre which incorporates 3.1&amp;nbsp;MWe / 4.0&amp;nbsp;MWth of gas fired CHP engines and 3 × 8&amp;nbsp;MW gas-fired boilers.

One of the United Kingdom's largest district heating schemes is EnviroEnergy in [[Nottingham]]. The plant initially built by [[Boots Group|Boots]] is now used to heat 4,600 homes, and a wide variety of business premises, including the [[Nottingham Royal Concert Hall|Concert Hall]], the [[Nottingham Arena]], the Victoria Baths, the [[Broadmarsh Shopping Centre]], the [[Victoria Centre]], and others. The heat source is a [[waste-to-energy]] incinerator. Scotland has several district heating systems with the first in the UK being installed at Aviemore and others following at Lochgilphead, Fort William and Forfar.

[[Sheffield]]'s district heating network was established in 1988 and is still expanding today. It saves an equivalent 21,000 plus tonnes of CO2 each year when compared to conventional sources of energy – electricity from the national grid and heat generated by individual boilers. There are currently over 140 buildings connected to the district heating network. These include city landmarks such as the [[Sheffield City Hall]], the [[Lyceum Theatre (Sheffield)|Lyceum Theatre]], [[Sheffield University]], [[Sheffield Hallam University]], hospitals, shops, offices and leisure facilities plus 2,800 homes. More than 44&amp;nbsp;km of underground pipes deliver energy which is generated at [[Sheffield ERF|Sheffield Energy Recovery Facility]]. This converts 225,000 tonnes of waste into energy, producing up to 60 MWe of thermal energy and up to 19 MWe of electrical energy.

The [[Southampton District Energy Scheme]] was originally built to use just [[Geothermal heating|geothermal]] energy, but now also uses the heat from a gas fired CHP generator. It supplies heating and [[district cooling]] to many large premises in the city, including the [[WestQuay]] shopping centre, the De Vere Grand Harbour hotel, the [[Royal South Hants Hospital]], and several housing schemes. In the 1980s [[Southampton]] began utilising combined heat and power district heating, taking advantage of geothermal heat "trapped" in the area. The geothermal heat provided by the well works in conjunction with the Combined Heat and Power scheme. Geothermal energy provides 15-20%, [[fuel oil]] 10%, and [[natural gas]] 70% of the total heat input for this scheme and the combined heat and power generators use conventional fuels to make electricity. "Waste heat" from this process is recovered for distribution through the 11&amp;nbsp;km mains network.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Geothermie district heating scheme Southampton United Kingdom|url=http://www.energie-cites.org/db/southampton_140_en.pdf}} 080304 energie-cites.org&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lerwick District Heating Scheme]] is of note because it is one of the few schemes where a completely new system was added to a previously existing small town.

ADE has an online map of district heating installations in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=District Heating Installation Map|url= http://www.theade.co.uk/district-heating-installation-map_790.html |publisher=ADE}}&lt;/ref&gt; ADE estimates that 54 percent of energy used to produce electricity is being wasted via conventional power production, which relates to £9.5 billion ($US12.5 billion) per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/articles/2017/11/what-a-waste-the-big-problem-of-heat-loss-in-uk-cities.html |title=What a Waste!

====Spain====
The largest district heating system in Spain is located in [[Soria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bioenergyinternational.es/noticias/News/show/el-mayor-district-heating-de-espana-se-construye-en-soria-383 |title=NOTICIAS – Bioenergy International España: revista especializada en bioenergía |publisher=Bioenergyinternational.es |date=2011-01-18 |accessdate=2011-09-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110910155209/http://www.bioenergyinternational.es/noticias/News/show/el-mayor-district-heating-de-espana-se-construye-en-soria-383 |archivedate=2011-09-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is called "Ciudad del Medio Ambiente" (Environmental Town) and will receive 41 MW from a biomass power plant.

===North America===
In North America, district heating systems fall into two general categories. Those that are owned by and serve the buildings of a single entity are considered institutional systems. All others fall into the commercial category.

====Canada====
District Heating is becoming a growing industry in Canadian cities, with many new systems being built in the last ten years. Some of the major systems in Canada include:

* Calgary: [[ENMAX]] currently operates the Calgary Downtown District Energy Centre which provides heating to up to {{convert|10000000|sqft|m2}} of new and existing residential and commercial buildings.

====United States====
The [[Holly Steam Combination Company]] was the first steam heating company to commercially distribute district heating from a central steam heating system. 
* [[Consolidated Edison]] of [[New York (state)|New York]] (Con Ed) operates the [[New York City steam system]], the largest commercial district heating system in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.energy.rochester.edu/us/coned.html |title=Con Ed Steam |publisher=Energy.rochester.edu |date= |accessdate=2011-09-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070921191139/http://www.energy.rochester.edu/us/coned.html |archivedate=2007-09-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The system has operated continuously since March 3, 1882 and serves [[Manhattan Island]] from the Battery through 96th Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.coned.com/history/steam.asp |title=A Brief History of Con Edison |publisher=Con Edison |accessdate=2014-05-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151114152015/http://www.coned.com/history/steam.asp |archivedate=2015-11-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to providing space- and water-heating, steam from the system is used in numerous restaurants for food preparation, for process heat in laundries and dry cleaners, and to power [[absorption chiller]]s for [[air conditioning]].
The city of [[Milwaukee]], [[Wisconsin]] has been using district heating for its [[central business district]] since the [[Valley Power Plant]] commenced operations in 1968.[https://www.we-energies.com/home/projects/vapp.htm] Amazingly, the air quality in the immediate vicinity of the plant, based on the sensor located on [[César Chavez]] Drive, qualifies as the best in Southeastern Wisconsin, at least with regard to [[ozone]] concentration. The recent (2012) conversion of the plant, which changed the fuel input from [[coal]] to [[natural gas]], is expected to further improve air quality at both the local César Chavez sensor as well as [[Antarctic]] sensors [http://www.jsonline.com/business/we-energies-converting-valley-power-plant-j56hi5n-166616006.html]. Interesting to note about Wisconsin power plants is their dual use as breeding grounds for [[peregrines]] [http://we-energies.com/environmental/protect_wildlife.htm].

===Asia===

====Japan====
87 district heating enterprises are operating in Japan, serving 148 districts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jdhc.or.jp/area/area01.html |title=平成21年4月現在支部別熱供給事業者: The Japan Heat Service Utilities Associations 2009 |publisher=Jdhc.or.jp |date= |accessdate=2011-09-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111007151412/http://www.jdhc.or.jp/area/area01.html |archivedate=2011-10-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many companies operate district cogeneration facilities that provide steam and/or hot water to many of the office buildings. Also, most operators in the [[Greater Tokyo]] serve district cooling.

====China====
{{Refimprove|date=December 2014}}
In southern China, there are nearly no district heating systems. In northern China, district heating systems are common. Most district heating system which are just for heating instead of CHP use hard coal. For air pollution in China has become quite serious, many cities gradually are now using natural gas rather than coal in district heating system. There is also some amount of geothermal heating and sea heat pump systems.

==Market penetration==
Penetration of district heating (DH) into the heat market varies by country. Penetration is influenced by different factors, including environmental conditions, availability of heat sources, economics, and economic and legal framework.

In the year 2000 the percentage of houses supplied by district heat in some European countries was as follows:

In Iceland the prevailing positive influence on DH is availability of easily captured [[geothermal heat]]. In most Eastern European countries, energy planning included development of [[cogeneration]] and district heating. Negative influence in the Netherlands and UK can be attributed partially to milder climate, along with competition from [[natural gas]]. The tax on domestic gas prices in the UK is a third of that in France and a fifth of that in Germany.

{{Geodesy}}
'''Earth radius''' is the distance from a selected center of Earth to a point on its surface,  which is often chosen to be sea level, or more commonly, the surface of an idealized ellipsoid representing the shape of Earth. Because Earth is not a perfect sphere, the determination of Earth's radius can have several values, depending on how it is measured; from its equatorial radius of about {{convert|6378|km|mi|abbr=off}} to its polar radius of about {{convert|6357|km|mi|abbr=off}}. 

When only one radius is stated, the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) prefers that it be Earth's equatorial radius.&lt;ref name="IAU XXIX" /&gt;  

The [[International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics]] (IUGG) gives three global average radii, the arithmetic mean of the radii of the ellipsoid (R{{sub|1}}), the radius of a sphere with the same surface area as the ellipsoid or authalic radius (R{{sub|2}}), and the radius of a sphere with the same volume as the ellipsoid (R{{sub|3}}).&lt;ref name="Moritz" /&gt; All three IUGG average radii are about {{convert|6371|km|mi}}. A fourth global average radius not mentioned by the IUGG is the rectifying radius, the radius of a sphere with a circumference equal to the perimeter of the polar cross section of the ellipsoid, about {{convert|6367|km|mi}}. The radius of curvature at any point on the surface of the ellipsoid depends on its coordinates and its azimuth, north-south (meridional), east-west (prime vertical), or somewhere in between. 

==Introduction==
[[File:Earth_oblateness_to_scale.svg|thumb|300px|A scale diagram of the [[Flattening|oblateness]] of the 2003 [[IERS]] [[reference ellipsoid]]. The outer edge of the dark blue line is an [[ellipse]] with the same [[Eccentricity (mathematics)#Ellipses|eccentricity]] as that of Earth, with north at the top. For comparison, the light blue circle within has a diameter equal to the ellipse's [[minor axis]]. The red line represents the [[Karman line]] {{convert|100|km|mi|abbr=on}} above [[sea level]], while the yellow area denotes the [[apsis|altitude]] range of the [[International Space Station|ISS]] in [[low Earth orbit]].]]
{{main|Figure of the Earth|Earth ellipsoid|Reference ellipsoid}}

[[Earth's rotation]], internal density variations, and external [[tidal force]]s cause its shape to deviate systematically from a perfect sphere.&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;For details see [[figure of the Earth]], [[geoid]], and [[Earth tide]].&lt;/ref&gt; Local [[topography]] increases the variance, resulting in a surface of profound complexity. Our descriptions of Earth's surface must be simpler than reality in order to be tractable. Hence, we create models to approximate characteristics of Earth's surface, generally relying on the simplest model that suits the need.

Each of the models in common use involve some notion of the geometric [[radius]]. Strictly speaking, spheres are the only solids to have radii, but broader uses of the term ''radius'' are common in many fields, including those dealing with models of Earth. The following is a partial list of models of Earth's surface, ordered from exact to more approximate:
* The actual surface of Earth
* The [[geoid]], defined by [[mean sea level]] at each point on the real surface&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;There is no single center to the geoid; it varies according to local [[Geodetic system|geodetic]] conditions.&lt;/ref&gt;
* A [[spheroid]], also called an [[ellipsoid]] of revolution, [[Geodetic system#Geodetic versus geocentric latitude|geocentric]] to model the entire Earth, or else [[Geodetic system#Geodetic versus geocentric latitude|geodetic]] for regional work&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;In a geocentric ellipsoid, the center of the ellipsoid coincides with some computed center of Earth, and best models the earth as a whole. Geodetic ellipsoids are better suited to regional idiosyncrasies of the geoid. A partial surface of an ellipsoid gets fitted to the region, in which case the center and orientation of the ellipsoid generally do not coincide with the earth's center of mass or axis of rotation.&lt;/ref&gt;
* A [[sphere]]

In the case of the geoid and ellipsoids, the fixed distance from any point on the model to the specified center is called ''"a radius of the Earth"'' or ''"the radius of the Earth at that point"''.&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;The value of the radius is completely dependent upon the latitude in the case of an ellipsoid model, and nearly so on the geoid.&lt;/ref&gt; It is also common to refer to any ''[[#Mean radii|mean radius]]'' of a spherical model as ''"the radius of the earth"''. When considering the Earth's real surface, on the other hand, it is uncommon to refer to a "radius", since there is generally no practical need. Rather, elevation above or below sea level is useful.

Regardless of the model, any radius falls between the polar minimum of about 6,357&amp;nbsp;km and the equatorial maximum of about 6,378&amp;nbsp;km (3,950 to 3,963&amp;nbsp;mi). Hence, the Earth deviates from a perfect sphere by only a third of a percent, which supports the spherical model in many contexts and justifies the term "radius of the Earth". While specific values differ, the concepts in this article generalize to any major [[planet]].

===Physics of Earth's deformation===
Rotation of a planet causes it to approximate an ''[[spheroid|oblate ellipsoid]]/spheroid'' with a bulge at the [[equator]] and flattening at the [[North Pole|North]] and [[South Pole]]s, so that the ''equatorial radius'' {{mvar|a}} is larger than the ''polar radius'' {{mvar|b}} by approximately {{mvar|aq}}. The ''oblateness constant'' {{mvar|q}} is given by
:&lt;math&gt;q=\frac{a^3 \omega^2}{GM}\,,&lt;/math&gt;
where {{mvar|ω}} is the [[angular frequency]], {{mvar|G}} is the [[gravitational constant]], and {{mvar|M}} is the mass of the planet.{{refn|This follows from the [[International Astronomical Union]] [[2006 definition of planet|definition]] rule (2): a planet assumes a shape due to [[hydrostatic equilibrium]] where [[gravity]] and [[centrifugal force]]s are nearly balanced.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iau2006.org/mirror/www.iau.org/iau0603/index.html IAU 2006 General Assembly: Result of the IAU Resolution votes] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061107022302/http://www.iau2006.org/mirror/www.iau.org/iau0603/index.html |date=2006-11-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=lower-alpha}} For the Earth {{math|{{sfrac|1|''q''}} ≈ 289}}, which is close to the measured inverse [[flattening]] {{math|{{sfrac|1|''f''}} ≈ 298.257}}. Additionally, the bulge at the equator shows slow variations. The bulge had been decreasing, but since 1998 the bulge has increased, possibly due to redistribution of ocean mass via currents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gsfc.nasa.gov/topstory/20020801gravityfield.html Satellites Reveal A Mystery Of Large Change In Earth's Gravity Field ], Aug. 1, 2002, [[Goddard Space Flight Center]]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100428205036/http://www.gsfc.nasa.gov/topstory/20020801gravityfield.html |date=April 28, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Lowresgeoidheight.jpg|400px|right]]
The variation in [[density]] and [[Crust (geology)|crustal]] thickness causes gravity to vary across the surface and in time, so that the mean sea level differs from the ellipsoid. This difference is the ''[[geoid]] height'', positive above or outside the ellipsoid, negative below or inside. The geoid height variation is under {{convert|110|m|ft|abbr=on}} on Earth. The geoid height can change abruptly due to earthquakes (such as the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake|Sumatra-Andaman earthquake]]) or reduction in ice masses (such as [[Greenland]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewpr.html?pid=18567 NASA's Grace Finds Greenland Melting Faster, 'Sees' Sumatra Quake], December 20, 2005, [[Goddard Space Flight Center]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all deformations originate within the Earth. The gravity of the Moon and Sun cause the Earth's surface at a given point to undulate by tenths of meters over a nearly 12-hour period (see [[Earth tide]]).

===Radius and local conditions===
[[File:Abu Reyhan Biruni-Earth Circumference.svg|thumb|[[Al-Biruni#Geodesy and geography|Al-Biruni]]'s (973–1048) method for calculation of the Earth's radius improved accuracy.]]
Given local and transient influences on surface height, the values defined below are based on a "general purpose" model, refined as globally precisely as possible within {{convert|5|m|ft|abbr=on}} of reference ellipsoid height, and to within {{convert|100|m|ft|abbr=on}} of mean sea level (neglecting geoid height).

Additionally, the radius can be estimated from the curvature of the Earth at a point. Like a [[torus]], the curvature at a point will be greatest (tightest) in one direction (north–south on Earth) and smallest (flattest) perpendicularly (east–west). The corresponding [[Radius of curvature (applications)|radius of curvature]] depends on the location and direction of measurement from that point. A consequence is that a distance to the [[horizon|true horizon]] at the equator is slightly shorter in the north/south direction than in the east-west direction.

In summary, local variations in terrain prevent defining a single "precise" radius. One can only adopt an idealized model. Since the estimate by [[Eratosthenes]], many models have been created. Historically, these models were based on regional topography, giving the best [[Figure of the Earth#Historical Earth ellipsoids|reference ellipsoid]] for the area under survey. As satellite remote sensing and especially the [[Global Positioning System]] gained importance, true global models were developed which, while not as accurate for regional work, best approximate the Earth as a whole.

==Fixed radius==
The following radii are fixed and do not include a variable location dependence. They are derived from the [[World Geodetic System]] 1984 ([[WGS-84]]) standard ellipsoid.&lt;ref name=tr8350_2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earth-info.nga.mil/GandG/publications/tr8350.2/wgs84fin.pdf |title=WGS84RPT.tif:Corel PHOTO-PAINT |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2018-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The value for the equatorial radius is defined to the nearest 0.1&amp;nbsp;m in WGS-84. The value for the polar radius in this section has been rounded to the nearest 0.1&amp;nbsp;m, which is expected to be adequate for most uses. Refer to the WGS-84 ellipsoid if a more precise value for its polar radius is needed.

The radii in this section are for an idealized surface. Even the idealized radii have an uncertainty of ±2&amp;nbsp;m.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earth-info.nga.mil/GandG/publications/tr8350.2/tr8350.2-a/Chapter%203.pdf |title=Info |website=earth-info.nga.mil |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discrepancy between the ellipsoid radius and the radius to a physical location may be significant. When identifying the position of an observable location, the use of more precise values for WGS-84 radii may not yield a corresponding improvement in [[accuracy]].

The symbol given for the named radius is used in the formulae found in this article.

===Equatorial radius===
The Earth's equatorial radius {{mvar|a}}, or [[semi-major axis]], is the distance from its center to the [[equator]] and equals {{convert|6378.1370|km|mi|sigfig=8|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://maia.usno.navy.mil/NSFA/NSFA_cbe.html#EarthRadius2009|title=Equatorial Radius of the Earth|last=|first=|date=2012|website=Numerical Standards for Fundamental Astronomy: Astronomical Constants : Current Best Estimates (CBEs)|publisher=IAU Division I Working Group|access-date=2016-08-10|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The equatorial radius is often used to compare Earth with other [[Planet#Attributes|planets]].

===Polar radius===
The Earth's polar radius {{mvar|b}}, or [[semi-minor axis]], is the distance from its center to the North and South Poles, and equals {{convert|6356.7523|km|mi|sigfig=8|abbr=on}}.

==Location-dependent radii{{anchor|Radii with location dependence}}==

===Geocentric radius===
The distance from the Earth's center to a point on the spheroid surface at geodetic latitude {{mvar|φ}} is:

:&lt;math&gt;R(\varphi)=\sqrt{\frac{(a^2\cos\varphi)^2+(b^2\sin\varphi)^2}{(a\cos\varphi)^2+(b\sin\varphi)^2}}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{mvar|a}} and {{mvar|b}} are, respectively, the equatorial radius and the polar radius.

===Radii of curvature{{anchor|Curvature}}===
{{see also|Spheroid#Curvature}}

====Principal sections====
There are two [[Principal curvature|principal radii of curvature]]: along the meridional and prime-vertical [[normal section]]s.

=====Meridional=====
In particular, the Earth's ''radius of curvature in the (north–south) [[meridian (geography)|meridian]]'' at {{mvar|φ}} is:
:&lt;math&gt;M(\varphi)=\frac{(ab)^2}{\big((a\cos\varphi)^2+(b\sin\varphi)^2\big)^\frac32}\,.&lt;/math&gt;
This is the radius that [[Eratosthenes#Measurement of the Earth|Eratosthenes]] measured.

=====Prime vertical=====
If one point had appeared due east of the other, one finds the approximate curvature in the east–west direction.&lt;ref group=lower-alpha name=curvprim&gt;East–west directions can be misleading. Point B, which appears due east from A, will be closer to the equator than A. Thus the curvature found this way is smaller than the curvature of a circle of constant latitude, except at the equator. West can be exchanged for east in this discussion.&lt;/ref&gt;

This ''radius of curvature in the [[prime vertical]]'' which is perpendicular (normal or [[orthogonal]]) to {{mvar|M}} at geodetic latitude {{mvar|φ}} is:&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;{{mvar|N}} is defined as the radius of curvature in the plane that is normal to both the surface of the ellipsoid at, and the meridian passing through, the specific point of interest.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;N(\varphi)=\frac{a^2}{\sqrt{(a\cos\varphi)^2+(b\sin\varphi)^2}}\,.&lt;/math&gt;
This radius is also called the '''transverse radius of curvature'''. At the equator, {{math|''N'' {{=}} ''R''}}.

[[Image:EarthEllipRadii.jpg|445x445px|Three different radii as a function of Earth's latitude. {{mvar|R}} is the geocentric radius; {{mvar|M}} is the meridional radius of curvature; and {{mvar|N}} is the prime vertical radius of curvature.|frame]]

The Earth's meridional radius of curvature at the equator equals the meridian's [[semi-latus rectum]]:

:{{math|{{sfrac|''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;|''a''}}}}{{pad|1em}}={{pad|1em}}6,335.439&amp;nbsp;km

The Earth's polar radius of curvature is:
:{{math|{{sfrac|''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;|''b''}}}}{{pad|1em}}={{pad|1em}}6,399.594&amp;nbsp;km

====Directional====
The Earth's radius of curvature along a course at an [[azimuth]] (measured clockwise from north) {{mvar|α}} at {{mvar|φ}} is derived from [[Euler's theorem (differential geometry)|Euler's curvature formula]] as follows:&lt;ref name=Torge/&gt;{{rp|97}}
:&lt;math&gt;R_\mathrm{c}=\frac{1}{\dfrac{\cos^2\alpha}{M}+\dfrac{\sin^2\alpha}{N}}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

====Combinations====
It is possible to combine the principal radii of curvature above in a non-directional manner.

{{anchor|Gaussian}}{{anchor|Gaussian radius of curvature}}The Earth's [[Gaussian curvature|Gaussian radius of curvature]] at latitude {{mvar|φ}} is:&lt;ref name=Torge&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pFO6VB_czRYC&amp;pg=PA98 |title=Geodesy|work=google.com.br}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;R_\mathrm{a}=\sqrt{MN}=\frac{a^2b}{(a\cos\varphi)^2+(b\sin\varphi)^2}\,.&lt;/math&gt;

{{anchor|Mean radius of curvature}}The Earth's [[Mean curvature|mean radius of curvature]] at latitude {{mvar|φ}} is:&lt;ref name=Torge /&gt;{{rp|97}}
:&lt;math&gt;R_\mathrm{m}=\frac{2}{\dfrac{1}{M}+\dfrac{1}{N}}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;

==Global average radii{{anchor|Mean radii}}==
The Earth can be modeled as a sphere in many ways. This section describes the common ways. The various radii derived here use the notation and dimensions noted above for the Earth as derived from the [[WGS-84]] ellipsoid;&lt;ref name=tr8350_2 /&gt; namely,

:{{mvar|a}} = Equatorial radius ({{val|6378.1370|u=km}})
:{{mvar|b}} = Polar radius ({{val|6356.7523|u=km}})

A sphere being a gross approximation of the spheroid, which itself is an approximation of the geoid, units are given here in kilometers rather than the millimeter resolution appropriate for geodesy.

===Mean radius===
[[File:WGS84_mean_Earth_radius.svg|thumb|Equatorial (''a''), polar (''b'') and mean Earth radii as defined in the 1984 [[World Geodetic System]] revision (not to scale)]]
In geophysics, the [[International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics]] (IUGG) defines the mean radius (denoted {{math|''R''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}}) to be&lt;ref name="Moritz"&gt;Moritz, H. (1980). [ftp://athena.fsv.cvut.cz/ZFG/grs80-Moritz.pdf ''Geodetic Reference System 1980''], by resolution of the XVII General Assembly of the IUGG in Canberra.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;R_1 = \frac{2a+b}{3}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;
For Earth, the mean radius is {{convert|6371.0088|km|mi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="Moritz2000"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Moritz |first=H. |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=March 2000 |title=Geodetic Reference System 1980 |journal=Journal of Geodesy |volume=74 |issue=1 |pages=128–133 |doi=10.1007/s001900050278 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/0bgccvjj5bedgdfu/about/ |accessdate= |quote= |bibcode = 2000JGeod..74..128. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In astronomy, the [[International Astronomical Union]] denotes the ''nominal equatorial Earth radius'' as &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R}^\mathrm N_\mathrm{eE}&lt;/math&gt;, which is defined to be {{convert|6378.1|km|mi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name = "IAU XXIX"/&gt;{{rp|3}} The ''nominal polar Earth radius'' is defined as &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{R}^\mathrm N_\mathrm{pE}&lt;/math&gt; = {{convert|6356.8|km|mi|abbr=on}}. These values correspond to the zero tide radii. Equatorial radius is conventionally used as the nominal value unless the polar radius is explicitly required.&lt;ref name = "IAU XXIX"/&gt;{{rp|4}}

===Authalic radius===
{{see also|Authalic latitude}}
Earth's authalic ("equal area") radius is the radius of a hypothetical perfect sphere that has the same surface area as the [[reference ellipsoid]]. The [[IUGG]] denotes the authalic radius as {{math|''R''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}}.&lt;ref name="Moritz"/&gt;

A closed-form solution exists for a spheroid:&lt;ref name="Snyder manual"&gt;Snyder, J.P. (1987). ''Map Projections – A Working Manual (US Geological Survey Professional Paper 1395)'' p. 16–17. Washington D.C: United States Government Printing Office.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;R_2=\sqrt{\frac{a^2+\frac{ab^2}{\sqrt{a^2-b^2}}\ln{\left(\frac{a+\sqrt{a^2-b^2}}b\right)}}{2}}=\sqrt{\frac{a^2}2+\frac{b^2}2\frac{\tanh^{-1}e}e} =\sqrt{\frac{A}{4\pi}}\,,&lt;/math&gt;
where {{math|''e''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} {{sfrac|''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; − ''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;|''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}}} and {{mvar|A}} is the surface area of the spheroid.

For the Earth, the authalic radius is {{convert|6,371.0072|km|mi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=Moritz2000/&gt;

===Volumetric radius===
Another spherical model is defined by the volumetric radius, which is the radius of a sphere of volume equal to the ellipsoid. The [[IUGG]] denotes the volumetric radius as {{math|''R''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;}}.&lt;ref name="Moritz"/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;R_3=\sqrt[3]{a^2b}\,.&lt;/math&gt;
For Earth, the volumetric radius equals {{convert|6,371.0008|km|mi|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=Moritz2000/&gt;

===Rectifying radius===
{{see also|Meridian arc#Polar distance|Rectifying latitude}}
Another mean radius is the ''rectifying radius'', giving a sphere with circumference equal to the [[circumference|perimeter]] of the ellipse described by any polar cross section of the ellipsoid. This requires an [[Circumference#Ellipse|elliptic integral]] to find, given the polar and equatorial radii:
:&lt;math&gt;M_\mathrm{r}=\frac{2}{\pi}\int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}}\sqrt{{a^2}\cos^2\varphi + {b^2} \sin^2\varphi}\,d\varphi\,.&lt;/math&gt;

The rectifying radius is equivalent to the meridional mean, which is defined as the average value of {{mvar|M}}:&lt;ref name="Snyder manual"/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;M_\mathrm{r}=\frac{2}{\pi}\int_{0}^{\frac{\pi}{2}}\!M(\varphi)\,d\varphi\,.&lt;/math&gt;

For integration limits of [0,{{sfrac|{{pi}}|2}}], the integrals for rectifying radius and mean radius evaluate to the same result, which, for Earth, amounts to {{convert|6,367.4491|km|mi|abbr=on}}.

The meridional mean is well approximated by the semicubic mean of the two axes,
:&lt;math&gt;M_\mathrm{r}\approx\left(\frac{a^\frac32+b^\frac32}{2}\right)^\frac23\,,&lt;/math&gt;

which differs from the exact result by less than {{convert|1|um|sigfig=1|abbr=on}}; the mean of the two axes,
:&lt;math&gt;M_\mathrm{r}\approx\frac{a+b}{2}\,,&lt;/math&gt;

about {{convert|6,367.445|km|mi|abbr=on}}, can also be used.

===Average distance from center to surface===
Most global mean radii are based on the [[reference ellipsoid]], which approximates the geoid. The geoid has no direct relationship with surface topography, however. An alternative calculation averages elevations everywhere, resulting in a mean radius {{val|230|u=m}} larger than the [[Earth radius#Mean radius|IUGG mean radius]], the [[Authalic radius|authalic radius]], or the [[Earth radius#Volumetric radius|volumetric radius]]. This average is {{convert|6371.230|km|mi|abbr=on}} with uncertainty of {{convert|10|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="chambat"&gt;{{cite article

==Osculating sphere==
The best local spherical approximation to the ellipsoid in the vicinity of a given point is the [[osculating circle|osculating]] sphere. Its radius equals the Gaussian radius of curvature as above, and its radial direction coincides with the ellipsoid [[normal direction]]. The center of the osculating sphere is offset from the center of the ellipsoid, but is at the [[center of curvature]] for the given point on the ellipsoid surface. This concept aids the interpretation of terrestrial and planetary [[radio occultation]] [[refraction]] measurements and in some navigation and surveillance applications.{{fact|date=December 2018}}

==History==
{{main|History of geodesy}}
The first published reference to the Earth's size appeared around 350&amp;nbsp;BC, when [[Aristotle]] reported in his book ''[[On the Heavens]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Aristotle|author-link=Aristotle|title=On the Heavens|orig-year=c. 350 BC|volume=Book II 298 B|url=http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/heavens.html|accessdate=5 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; that mathematicians had guessed the circumference of the Earth to be 400,000 [[Stadia (length)|stadia]]. Scholars have interpreted Aristotle's figure to be anywhere from highly accurate&lt;ref&gt;

'''Eddoe''' or '''eddo''' is a tropical vegetable often considered identifiable as the species ''Colocasia antiquorum'',&lt;ref&gt;''Utilisation des aliments tropicaux: racines et tubercules'', FAO, Rome, 1990, p. 35. {{ISBN|92-5-202775-0}}, [https://books.google.fr/books?id=jFRnIx2NRakC&amp;pg=PA35&amp;dq=Eddoe&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1ee7VOb8IcfdaKqngPAB&amp;ved=0CCYQuwUwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Eddoe&amp;f=false google book].&lt;/ref&gt; closely related to [[taro]] (dasheen, ''Colocasia esculenta''), which is primarily used for its thickened stems ([[corm]]s).&lt;ref name=Purseglove&gt;Purseglove, J.W. 1972. ''Tropical crops. Monocotyledons''. Longman &amp; John Wiley, Harlow and New York.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Africancropscience"&gt;R. Tumuhimbise et al (2009) [http://www.bioline.org.br/request?cs09005 Growth and development of wetland-grown taro under different plant populations and seedbed types in Uganda]. ''African Crop Science Journal'', Vol. 17, No. 1, 2009, pp. 49-60&lt;/ref&gt; It has smaller corms than taro, and in most cultivars there is an acrid taste that requires careful cooking.&lt;ref name=Purseglove/&gt; The young leaves can also be cooked and eaten, but (unlike taro) they have a somewhat acrid taste.&lt;ref name=Purseglove/&gt;

Eddoes appear to have been developed as a crop in [[China]] and [[Japan]] and introduced from there to the [[West Indies]] where they are sometimes called "Chinese eddoes".&lt;ref name=Purseglove/&gt; They grow best in rich loam soil with good drainage, but they can be grown in poorer soil, in drier climates, and in cooler temperatures than taro.&lt;ref name=Purseglove/&gt;

Eddoes are also called '''malangas''' in Spanish-speaking areas, but that name is also used for other plants of the Araceae family, including tannia ([[Xanthosoma|''Xanthosoma'' spp.]]).&lt;ref name=Purseglove/&gt;

Eddoes make part of the generic classification '''cará''' or '''inhame''' of the [[Portuguese language]] which, beside taro, also includes root vegetables of the genera ''[[Alocasia]]'' and ''[[Dioscorea]]''. They are the most commonly eaten {{lang|pt|inhames/carás}} in the states of São Paulo, Rio de Janeiro and Espírito Santo, as well as surrounding regions of all.&lt;ref&gt;[http://come-se.blogspot.com.br/2013/08/cara-e-inhame-coluna-nhac-do-caderno.html Eatable: cará and inhame, column Nhac of the Paladar journal] {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are also fairly common in Northeastern Brazil, where they might be called {{lang|pt|batata}} (literally "potato"), but less so than true yams of the genus Colocasia. According to Brazilian folk knowledge, the eddoes most appropriate to be cooked are those that are more deeply pink, or at least pinkish lavender, in the area where the leaves were cut.

The 1889 book ''The Useful Native Plants of Australia'' records that Colocasia antiquorum: {{quote|is cultivated in most tropical countries, Egypt, India, etc., for the sake of its leaves, which when uncooked are acrid, but on boiling, the water being changed, they lose their acridity, and may be eaten as spinach." (Treasury of Botany) Acid fruits are added to assist the removal of the acridity. Hindoos [sic.] and Mahometans [sic.] are very fond of all parts of the plants of this genus." (Dymock.) "When the crop is gathered in Fiji," says Dr. Seemann (Flora Vtliensis), " the tops of the tubers are cut off and at once replanted. The young leaves may be eaten like spinach, but, like the root,they require to be well cooked in order to destroy the acridity peculiar to aroideous plants. The Fijians prefer eating the cooked Taro when cold ; Europeans as a rule like it quite hot, and, if possible, roasted. A considerable number of varieties are known, some better adapted for puddings, some for bread, or simply for boiling or baking. The outer marks of distinction chiefly rest upon the different tinge observable in the corm, leaf, stalks, and ribs of the leaves - white, yellowish, purple."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=J. H.

==Taxonomy==
[[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]] originally described two species which are now known as ''[[Colocasia esculenta]]'' and ''Colocasia antiquorum'' of the cultivated plants that are known by many names including eddoes, dasheen, taro, but many later botanists consider them all to be members of a single, very variable species, the correct name for which is ''Colocasia esculenta''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=The Nomenclature of the Taro and its Varieties |url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/item/31894#page/134/mode/1up |author=Albert F.

==Security of supply==
Turkey meets a quarter of its energy demand from national resources: much of the rest is supplied by imports of oil and gas&lt;ref name="MFA"&gt;{{cite web |title=TURKEY’S ENERGY PROFILE AND STRATEGY |url=http://www.mfa.gov.tr/turkeys-energy-strategy.en.mfa |publisher=[[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Turkey)]] |accessdate=16 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; from Russia, Iraq and Iran; which is a geopolitical vulnerability and the more than $50 billion annually&lt;ref name="US commerce"&gt;{{cite web |title=Turkey - Energy-Prospects-and-Mining Renewables- Smart Grid-Gas-Power Generation |url=https://www.export.gov/article?id=Turkey-Energy-Prospects-and-Mining-Renewables-Smart-Grid-Gas-Power-Generation |publisher=U.S. Commercial Service of the U.S. Department of Commerce |accessdate=16 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  accounts for three quarters of the current account deficit&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Coal Power Plants |url=https://www.coalinturkey.com/coal-power-plants/ |website=Coal in Turkey |accessdate=16 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ,which  is probably the biggest structural vulnerability of the country’s economy;&lt;ref name="TurkStream" /&gt; and contributed to the [[Turkish currency and debt crisis, 2018|debt problems in 2018]].

To secure energy supply the government is building new gas pipelines&lt;ref name="TurkStream" /&gt; and diversifying energy sources. The government aims at meeting the forecast  increase in demand for electricity by building [[nuclear power in Turkey|nuclear power plants]] and more [[solar power in Turkey|solar]], [[wind power in Turkey|wind]], [[hydroelectricity in Turkey|hydro]] and [[coal in Turkey|coal-fired]] power plants.

===Impact of a potential carbon tax===
In the long term a carbon tax would reduce import dependency by speeding development of national solar and wind energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Bavbek |first1=Gökşin |title=Assessing the Potential Efects of a Carbon Tax in Turkey |url=http://edam.org.tr/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/EDAM_CarbonTaxEffects_October2016.pdf |website=EDAM Energy and Climate Change Climate Action Paper Series 2016/6 |accessdate=16 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; page 9

==Fossil fuel subsidies and taxes==
In the 21st century fossil fuel subsidies are around 0.2% of GDP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Fossil fuel subsidies as a lose-lose: Fiscal and environmental burdens in Turkey |url=https://doi.org/10.1017/npt.2018.7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The energy minister Fatih Dönmez suppports coal&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Analysis: New Turkish energy minister bullish for coal -- but lira weakness limits market |url=https://www.spglobal.com/platts/en/market-insights/latest-news/coal/071218-analysis-new-turkish-energy-minister-bullish-for-coal-but-lira-weakness-limits-market |publisher=S &amp; P Global |date=12 Jul 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Court says ‘environment report necessary’ for planned coal mine in western Turkey |url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/court-says-environment-report-necessary-for-planned-new-coal-mine-in-western-turkey-135665 |agency=Demirören News Agency |date=10 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and most [[Energy_subsidies#Turkey|energy subsidies]] are to coal.&lt;ref name=OECD&gt;[http://stats.oecd.org/Index.aspx?DataSetCode=FFS_TUR "Fossil Fuel Support - TUR"], [[OECD]], accessed August 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;
However diesel is taxed at 200TL/tonne CO2 and petrol at over 300TL/tonne CO2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Taxing Energy Use 2018 Turkey |url=https://www.oecd.org/tax/tax-policy/taxing-energy-use-2018-turkey.pdf |publisher=[[OECD]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Natural Gas subsidies===
The purpose of the [[Electricity_market#Capacity_market|capacity market for electricity]] is claimed to be to secure supply: however despite almost all natural gas being imported some gas-fired power plants received capacity payments in 2018 whereas non-fossil [[firm service|firm power]] such as [[demand response]] and Turkey’s many hydro power plants cannot.&lt;ref name=capacitymech&gt;[http://www.resmigazete.gov.tr/eskiler/2018/01/20180120-23.htm "ELEKTRİK PİYASASI KAPASİTE MEKANİZMASI YÖNETMELİĞİ,"] Resmî Gazete Issue:30307 Article 1 and Article 6 clause 2) h), 20 Jan 2018&lt;/ref&gt;
State-owned [[BOTAŞ]] controls 80% of the natural gas market and the household price of natural gas was the cheapest in Europe in 2017&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Turkish households consumed cheapest natural gas in Europe in 2017 |url=https://www.dailysabah.com/energy/2018/08/13/turkish-households-consumed-cheapest-natural-gas-in-europe-in-2017 |work=Daily Sabah |date=12 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Turkey’s long-term contracts with all its current suppliers –Russia, Azerbaijan and Iran– are due to expire in the 2020s.&lt;ref name="TurkStream" /&gt;
Exploration for gas in the Eastern Mediterranean is subsidized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Turkey to continue gas drilling work around Cyprus: Foreign minister |url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/turkey-to-continue-gas-drilling-work-around-cyprus-foreign-minister-137940 |agency=Anadolu Agency |date=16 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OECD" /&gt; and is a cause of geopolitical tension due to the [[Cyprus dispute]].

===Coal subsidies===
[[Coal in Turkey]] is heavily subsidized.&lt;ref&gt;Şahin (2018), p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sources==
===Coal===
"With all of its domestic coal reserves tapped, Turkey plans to reach a total installed capacity of 120,000 MWs in 2023." 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Foreign investors in line for Turkey’s massive coal projects|url=http://www.invest.gov.tr/en-US/infocenter/news/Pages/220114-turkey-massive-coal-projects-drawing-investors.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

However "this focus on coal is a huge burden for the sustainability of Turkey’s energy systems."
&lt;ref name=pol1&gt;{{cite web|title=Coal’s Not Cool: Energy &amp; Turkey’s Reputation, Summer 2015|url=http://turkishpolicy.com/article/761/coals-not-cool-energy-turkeys-reputation-summer-2015|publisher=Turkish Policy Quarterly|accessdate=29 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Environmentalists claim "the environmental impacts of coal power plants are inadequately assessed, while Turkey's viable, clean alternatives to coal are neither being analysed or discussed seriously by senior policy- and decision-makers." &lt;ref&gt;http://bankwatch.org/bwmail/57/new-report-how-turkeys-coal-boom-threatens-local-economies-black-sea&lt;/ref&gt; 

There have been protests against coal power plants. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Protest against coal power at Sirnak (Turkish)|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/turkey/tr/news/sirnaklilardan-enerji-bakanina-mesaj-020214/}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Community power is ending the age of coal in Turkey|url=http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/Blogs/makingwaves/is-the-coal-age-ending-in-turkey/blog/46454/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even in cities where natural gas is available the government supports poor households with free coal.

===Nuclear===
"Current shortcomings in Turkey's regulatory setup and human resources have to be addressed for ensuring a safe and secure transition to nuclear energy."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.edam.org.tr/en/AnaKategori/energy-and-climate-change#&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hydro===
The government appears to be considering further pumped-storage&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=New Pump Storage opportunities in Turkey for Litostroj Power Group |url=http://www.litostrojpower.com/news/2018/02/47-New-Pump-Storage-opportunities-in-Turkey-for-Litostroj-Power-Group |publisher=Litostroj Power Group |accessdate=19 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; possibly [[Pumped-storage_hydroelectricity#Pump-back_hydroelectric_dams|pump-back]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=ÇETİNKAYA |first1=SEMİH |title=CAPACITY DETERMINATION OF PUMPED STORAGE PROJECTS USING MARKET ELECTRICITY PRICES |url=http://etd.lib.metu.edu.tr/upload/12616768/index.pdf |publisher=MIDDLE EAST TECHNICAL UNIVERSITY}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics==
Although the coal industry and the government are said to have a close relationship, [[Turkish currency and debt crisis, 2018|economic downturn]] and the falling cost of wind and solar may increase pressure on coal subsidies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sencan |first1=Gokce |title=Political Reasoning and Mechanisms behind Turkey's Coal-Intensive Energy Policy in the Era of Renewables |journal=University of California, Santa Barbara |date=2017 |doi=10.13140/RG.2.2.24500.86407 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/314827361_Political_Reasoning_and_Mechanisms_behind_Turkey%27s_Coal-Intensive_Energy_Policy_in_the_Era_of_Renewables}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hydroelectric plants, especially new ones, are sometimes controversial in local, international and environmental politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Eren |first1=Ayşen |title=Transformation of the water-energy nexus in Turkey: Re-imagining hydroelectricity infrastructure |journal=Energy Research &amp; Social Science |date=July 2018 |volume=41 |pages=22-31 |url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.erss.2018.04.013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Laws==
There is an Energy Efficiency Law.

==Nuclear power regulation== 
{{See also|Nuclear energy in Turkey}} 
In 2018 a new regulator was set up and  $0.15 per kWh of generated electricity will be set aside for waste management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Turkey sets up new nuclear regulator |url=http://www.neimagazine.com/news/newsturkey-sets-up-new-nuclear-regulator-6244883 |work=Nuclear Engineering International |date=13 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Solar power regulation==
Amending regulations on rooftop solar panels has been suggested to simplify installation on existing buildings and mandate for new buildings.&lt;ref&gt;Aşıcı (2017), page 44&lt;/ref&gt;

==State energy companies==
State energy companies include: Eti Mine, [[Turkish Coal Enterprises]], [[Turkish Hard Coal Enterprises]], the [[Electricity Generation Company (Turkey)|Electricity Generation Company]], BOTAŞ and TEİAŞ - the electricity trading and transmission company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Turkey's state energy companies to invest $1.5B in 2019 |url=https://www.dailysabah.com/energy/2018/10/18/turkeys-state-energy-companies-to-invest-15b-in-2019 |work=Daily Sabah |date=18 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government holds a quarter of total installed electricity supply and often offers prices below market levels.&lt;ref name=Reuters2018&gt;{{cite news |last1=Pamuk |first1=Humeyra |title=Once darling of foreign investors, Turkey's power market struggles |url=https://in.mobile.reuters.com/article/amp/idINKCN1LQ1S3 |accessdate=11 October 2018 |work=[[Reuters]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Air Pollution==
{{see also|Environmental issues in Turkey}}
Although Turkish air pollution limits are above the current EU [[Industrial Emissions Directive]] as of June 2019 large power plants are required to keep to limits in the previous EU standard, the [[Large Combustion Plant Directive]].&lt;ref name="tepav"&gt;{{cite web |title=Turkey’s Compliance with the Industrial Emissions Directive |url=http://www.tepav.org.tr/upload/files/haber/1427475571-5.Turkey___s_Compliance_with_the_Industrial_Emissions_Directive.pdf |publisher=tepav |accessdate=18 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Retrofitting equipment for pollution control such as [[flue-gas desulfurization]] at old plants such as [[Soma power station|Soma]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Our Continuing Investments |url=http://www.konyaseker.com.tr/en/icerik/yatirimlarimiz/6598/Our%20Continuing%20Investments |publisher=Konya Şeker |accessdate=18 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Climate change==
Turkey's greenhouse gas inventory is incomplete.&lt;ref&gt;http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2013/arr/tur.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The energy policy aim of reducing imports (e.g. of gas) conflicts with the climate change policy aim of reducing emission of greenhouse gases as some local resources (e.g. lignite) emit a lot of CO2. In particular considering an emissions trading scheme "any carbon pricing instrument shall be structured in a way that shall not be considered as a barrier for utilization of domestic fossil fuel based sources for electricity generation until decreasing the share of export fuel to a reasonable level, to be determined by policy makers." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Turkey – Market Readiness Proposal – (03.05.13)|url=https://www.thepmr.org/system/files/documents/TUR-FINAL-MRP_2013-05-03%20Final.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12343">'''Filter paper''' is a semi-permeable [[paper]] barrier placed [[perpendicular]] to a liquid or air flow.  It is used to separate fine substances  from liquids or air. It is used in science labs to remove solids from liquids. This can be used to remove sand from water.

==Properties==
Filter paper has various properties. The important parameters are [[wet strength]], porosity, particle retention, [[volumetric flow rate]], compatibility, efficiency and capacity.

There are two mechanisms of filtration with paper; volume and surface. By volume filtration the particles are caught in the bulk of the filter paper. By surface filtration the particles are caught on the paper surface. Filter paper is mostly used because even a small piece of filter paper will absorb a significant volume of liquid

==Manufacture==
{{Main|Paper machine}}
The raw materials are different [[pulp (paper)|paper pulps]]. The pulp may be from [[softwood]], [[hardwood]], [[fiber crops]], [[mineral fibres|mineral fibers]]. For high quality filters,  [[dissolving pulp]] and [[mercerised pulp]] are used. Most filter papers are made on small [[paper machine]]s. For [[laboratory]] filters the machines may be as small as 50&amp;nbsp;cm width. The paper is often [[Crêpe paper|crêped]] to improve porosity. The filter papers may also be treated with [[reagents]] or impregnation to get the right properties.

==Types==

===Air filters===
[[File:Air filter, opel astra(2).JPG|thumb|Air filter paper in an auto engine]]
{{Main|Air filter}}
The main application for air filters are [[combustion air]] to [[engine]]s. The filter papers are transformed into filter cartridges, which then is fitted to a holder. The construction of the cartridges mostly requires that the paper is stiff enough to be self-supporting. A paper for air filters needs to be very porous and have a weight of 100 - 200 g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Normally particularly long fibrous pulp that is mercerised is used to get these properties. The paper is normally impregnated to improve the resistance to [[moisture]].&lt;ref name=engine&gt;{{cite book |last1=Paulapuro |first1=Hannu |authorlink1= |last2= |first2= |editor1-first= |editor1-last= |editor1-link= |others= |title=Paper and Board grades |url= |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= Papermaking Science and Technology |volume= 18 |date= |year= 2000|month= |origyear= |publisher= Fapet Oy|location= Finland|isbn= 952-5216-18-7 |oclc= |doi= |id= |page= 113|pages= |chapter= 5|chapterurl= |quote= |ref= |bibcode= |laysummary= |laydate= |separator= |postscript= |lastauthoramp=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some heavy duty qualities are made to be rinsed and thereby extend the life of the filter.

===Coffee filter===
{{main|Coffee filter}}

Coffee filters of paper are made from about 100 g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; [[crêpe paper|crêped paper]]. The crêping allows the coffee to flow freely between the [[Filtration|filter]] and the filtration [[funnel]]. The raw materials ([[pulp (paper)|pulp]]) for the filter paper are coarse [[softwood|long fiber]], often from fast growing trees. Both [[Bleaching of wood pulp|bleached]] and unbleached qualities are made.&lt;ref name=filterpaper&gt;{{cite book |last1=Paulapuro |first1=Hannu |authorlink1= |last2= |first2= |editor1-first= |editor1-last= |editor1-link= |others= |title=Paper and Board grades |url= |format= |accessdate= |edition= |series= Papermaking Science and Technology |volume= 18 |date= |year= 2000|month= |origyear= |publisher= Fapet Oy|location= Finland|isbn= 952-5216-18-7 |oclc= |doi= |id= |page= 114 |pages= |chapter= 5|chapterurl= |quote= |ref= |bibcode= |laysummary= |laydate= |separator= |postscript= |lastauthoramp=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coffee filters are made in different shapes and sizes to fit into different holders. Important parameters are strength, compatibility, efficiency and capacity.

===Fuel filters===
{{Main|Fuel filter}}
The paper used for fuel filters is a [[crêpe paper|crêped paper]] with controlled porosity, which is pleated and wound to cartridges. The raw material for filter paper used in fuel filters are made of a mixture of hardwood and softwood fibres. The basis weight of the paper is 50 - 80 g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=filterpaper/&gt;

==Laboratory filters==
{{see also|Filtration}}
[[File:Filter paper 840 3x3 copy.jpg#file|thumb|left|A scan of Whatman Filter Paper 4 Qualitative taken at 840 magnifications under a [[scanning electron microscope]].]]

Filter papers are widely used in laboratory experiments across many different fields, from biology to chemistry.  The type of filter used will differ according to the purpose of the procedure and the chemicals involved. Generally, filter papers are used with laboratory techniques such as gravity or vacuum filtration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Filtration Techniques|url=http://faculty.sites.uci.edu/chem1l/files/2013/11/RDGfiltration.pdf|website=Filtration Techniques|accessdate=2015-11-21|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150501090643/http://faculty.sites.uci.edu/chem1l/files/2013/11/RDGfiltration.pdf|archivedate=2015-05-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Qualitative filter paper ===
Qualitative filter paper is used in qualitative analytical techniques to determine materials. There are different grades of qualitative filter paper according to different pore size. There are total 13 different grades of qualitative filter paper. The largest pore size is grade 4; the smallest pore size is grade 602 h; the most commonly used grades are grade 1 to grade 4.&lt;ref name="qualitative"&gt;{{cite web|title=Filter Papers and Membranes|url=http://www.chimica.unipd.it/nicola.tiso/pubblica/_private/Utile/catalogo%20whatman.pdf|website=Filter Papers and Membranes|accessdate=21 November 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151122045201/http://www.chimica.unipd.it/nicola.tiso/pubblica/_private/Utile/catalogo%20whatman.pdf|archivedate=22 November 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Whatman filter paper.jpg|thumb|150mm qualitative filter paper]]

==== Grade 1 ====
Grade 1 qualitative filter paper has the pore size of 11&amp;nbsp;µm. This grade of filter paper is widely used for many different fields in agricultural analysis, air pollution monitoring and other similar experiments.&lt;ref name="qualitative" /&gt;

==== Grade 2 ====
Grade 2 qualitative filter paper has the pore size of 8&amp;nbsp;µm. This grade of filter paper requires more filtration time than Grade 1 filter paper.  This filter paper is used for monitoring specific contaminants in the atmosphere and soil testing.&lt;ref name="qualitative" /&gt;

==== Grade 3 ====
Grade 3 qualitative filter paper has the pore size of 6&amp;nbsp;µm. This grade of filter paper is very suitable for carrying samples after filtration.&lt;ref name="qualitative" /&gt;
==== Grade 4  ====
Grade 4 qualitative filter paper has the pore size of 20~25&amp;nbsp;µm. This grade of filter paper has the largest pore size among all standard qualitative filter papers. It is very useful as rapid filter for cleanup of geological fluids or organic extracts during experiment.&lt;ref name="qualitative" /&gt;

==== Grade 602 h ====
Grade 602 h qualitative filter paper has the pore size of 2&amp;nbsp;µm. This grade of filter paper has the smallest pore size among all standard qualitative filter papers.  It is used for collecting or removing fine particles.&lt;ref name="qualitative" /&gt;

=== Quantitative Filter Paper ===
Quantitative filter paper, also called ash-free filter paper, is used for quantitative and gravimetric analysis. During the manufacturing, producer use acid to make the paper ash-less and achieve high purity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Filter Papers for the Laboratory and Industry|url=https://static.fishersci.com/cmsassets/downloads/segment/Scientific/pdf/filter_papers.pdf|website=Filter Papers for the Laboratory and Industry|publisher=Sartorius Stedim|accessdate=21 November 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151122011251/https://static.fishersci.com/cmsassets/downloads/segment/Scientific/pdf/filter_papers.pdf|archivedate=22 November 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Chromatography paper.jpg|thumb|filter paper uses for paper chromatography]]
=== Chromatography Papers ===
Chromatography is a method chemists use to separate compounds. This type of filter paper has specific water flow rate and absorption speed to maximize the result of paper chromatography. The absorption speed of this type of filter paper is from 6&amp;nbsp;cm to 18&amp;nbsp;cm and the thickness is from 0.17&amp;nbsp;mm from 0.93&amp;nbsp;mm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Laboratory Filter Paper|url=https://www.labtek.com.au/SuppliersData/Advantec/Laboratory%20Filter%20Paper.pdf|website=Laboratory Filter Paper|accessdate=21 November 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160309211418/http://www.labtek.com.au/SuppliersData/Advantec/Laboratory%20Filter%20Paper.pdf|archivedate=9 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Extraction Thimbles ===
Extraction thimbles are rod-shape filter paper often used in [[Soxhlet extractor|Soxhlet extractors]] or atomized extractors. It is ideal for very sensitive detection, the performance it depends on the thickness of inner diameter. Also, it is usually used in areas of food control and environmental monitoring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cellulose extraction thimbles|url=http://www.hahnemuehle.com/en/filtration/lab-filtration/extraction-thimbles/cellulose-extraction-thimbles.html|website=Hahnemuehle|accessdate=2015-11-21|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151122083336/http://www.hahnemuehle.com/en/filtration/lab-filtration/extraction-thimbles/cellulose-extraction-thimbles.html|archivedate=2015-11-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Glass Fiber Filters ===
Glass fiber filter has the pore size of 1&amp;nbsp;µm, it is useful for filtering highly contaminated solutions or difficult-to-filter solution. Also, glass fiber filter has extends filter life, wide range of particulate loads and can prevent sample contamination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Glass Fiber Filters|url=http://www.pall.com/main/laboratory/product.page?id=20027|website=Glass Fiber Filters|publisher=Pall Corporation|accessdate=2015-11-21|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151122000545/http://www.pall.com/main/laboratory/product.page?id=20027|archivedate=2015-11-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, different types of glass fiber filter are suitable for different filtration situation.  There are 7 different types of glass fiber filters and the major difference is thickness.

=== Quartz Fiber Filter ===
Quartz fiber filter paper is high resistance chemical, does not absorb NOx and SOx dioxides, unaffected by humidity and easily sterilized. Thus, it is mostly use for air pollution analysis.&lt;ref name="quartz"&gt;{{cite web|title=Laboratory Filter Paper|url=https://www.labtek.com.au/SuppliersData/Advantec/Laboratory%20Filter%20Paper.pdf|website=Laboratory Filter Paper|accessdate=21 November 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160309211418/http://www.labtek.com.au/SuppliersData/Advantec/Laboratory%20Filter%20Paper.pdf|archivedate=9 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== [[Polytetrafluoroethylene|PTFE]] filter ===
PTFE filter has wide operating temperature (-120&amp;nbsp;°C~260&amp;nbsp;°C) with high [[air permeability]]. The resistance to high temperature makes PTFE filter paper suitable for use in autoclaves. It is often used to filter hot oils, strong solvents and collecting airborne particulates.&lt;ref name="quartz"/&gt;

===Oil filters===
[[File:Engine oil filter cutaway.JPG|thumb|Oil filter cut-away with paper visible inside]]
{{Main|Oil filter}}
[[Engine oil]] is filtered to remove impurities. Filtration of oil is normally done with volume filtration. Filter papers for lubrication oils are impregnated to resist high temperatures.&lt;ref name=engine/&gt;

===Tea bags===
{{Main|Tea bag}}
Tea bags are made from [[Abacá|abacá fibers]], a very thin and long fiber manilla hemp. Often the paper is augmented with a minor portion of [[synthetic fiber]]s. The bag paper is very porous and thin and has high [[wet strength]].&lt;ref name=filterpaper/&gt;

'''''Gran Casino''''' (Alternate title: '''''En el viejo Tampico''''') is a 1947 Mexican film. It was written by Mauricio Magdaleno and Edmundo Baez, based on a story by Michel Weber, and directed by [[Luis Buñuel]].

==Plot==
Gerardo ([[Jorge Negrete]]) and his friend Demetrio (Julio Villarreal) are a pair of footloose cowboys in turn-of-the-century Mexico who are in prison on dubious charges. As Gerardo sings and strums on his [[guitar]], Demetrio saws the bars of their cell, enabling them to escape. They come upon a small oil field operated by José Enrique (Francisco Jambrina), an entrepreneur from [[Argentina]] who is refusing to sell out to evil oil barons who threaten the workers.  Gerardo persuades José to give work to him and his friends, and after he and Demetrio recruit more workers, they're able to rejuvenate the struggling operation.  Just as their fortunes are on the rise, however, the oilman disappears and is feared murdered.   Demetrio takes over the operation next, but, again, the night before the oil is to start pumping, he goes to the [[casino]] and falls for Camelia ([[Meche Barba|Mercedes Barba]]), the same girl José was last seen with before he vanished, and he too disappears.

José's sister Mercedes ([[Libertad Lamarque]]) travels to Mexico to find out what's become of him, and when she learns that Gerardo has taken over as manager, she's convinced that Gerardo and his pals are to blame. Wanting to know more about Gerardo and his cronies, she takes a job as a singer at "Gran Casino," a rowdy nightclub near the oil fields.  In time, she strikes up a romance with the good-hearted roughneck and learns the identity of her brother's real enemy—Don Fabio ([[José Baviera]]), the local front for Big Oil.

==Background==

===Libertad Lamarque===
From the release of the film ''[[Honeysuckle (film)|Honeysuckle]]'' in 1938, Libertad Lamarque was the most popular artist in Argentine cinema.&lt;ref name=Finkielman&gt;{{cite book|last=Finkielman|first=Jorge|title=The Film Industry in Argentina: An Illustrated Cultural History|year=2004|publisher=McFarland|location=Jefferson NC|isbn=978-0786416288|pages=227|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pbhjvdIt6FoC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She had made her name on stage and radio as a [[tango]] singer and she was able to capitalize on that success by combining her singing and acting abilities in pictures that pulled their melodramatic plots straight from the tales told in popular tangos.&lt;ref name=Karush&gt;{{cite book|last=Karush|first=Matthew B.|title="Populism, Melodrama, and the Market", in The New Cultural History of Peronism: Power and Identity in Mid-Twentieth-Century Argentina, ed. by Matthew B.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6658">'''Human-based evolutionary computation''' (HBEC) is a set of [[evolutionary computation]] techniques that rely on human innovation. Human-based evolutionary computation techniques can be classified into three more specific classes analogous to ones in evolutionary computation. There are three basic types of innovation: initialization, mutation, and recombination. Here is a table illustrating which type of human innovation are supported in different classes of HBEC:

All these three classes also have to implement selection, performed either by humans or by computers.

==Examples==
===Human-based selection strategy===

Human-based selection strategy is a simplest human-based evolutionary computation procedure. It is used heavily today by websites outsourcing collection and selection of the content to humans (user-contributed content). Viewed as evolutionary computation, their mechanism supports two operations: initialization (when a user adds a new item) and selection (when a user expresses preference among items). The website software aggregates the preferences to compute the fitness of items so that it can promote the fittest items and discard the worst ones. Several methods of human-based selection were analytically compared in (Kosorukoff, 2000; Gentry, 2005).

Because the concept seems too simple, most of the websites implementing the idea can't avoid the common pitfall: [[informational cascade]] in soliciting human preference. For example, [[digg]]-style implementations, pervasive on the web, heavily bias subsequent human evaluations by prior ones by showing how many votes the items already have. This makes the aggregated evaluation depend on a very small initial sample of rarely independent evaluations. This encourages many people to [[game the system]] that might add to digg's popularity but detract from the quality of the featured results. It is too easy to submit evaluation in digg-style system based only on the content title, without reading the actual content supposed to be evaluated.

A better example of a human-based selection system is [[Stumbleupon]]. In Stumbleupon, users first experience the content (stumble upon it), and can then submit their preference by pressing a thumb-up or thumb-down button. Because the user doesn't see the number of votes given to the site by previous users, Stumbleupon can collect a relatively unbiased set of user preferences, and thus evaluate content much more precisely.

===Human-based evolution strategy===

In this context and maybe generally, the Wikipedia software is the best illustration of a working human-based evolution strategy wherein the (targeted) evolution of any given page comprises the fine tuning of the knowledge base of such information that relates to that page. Traditional [[evolution strategy]] has three operators: initialization, mutation, and selection. In the case of Wikipedia, the initialization operator is page creation, the mutation operator is incremental page editing. The selection operator is less salient. It is provided by the revision history and the ability to select among all previous revisions via a revert operation. If the page is vandalised and no longer a good fit to its title, a reader can easily go to the revision history and select one of the previous revisions that fits best (hopefully, the previous one). This selection feature is crucial to the success of the Wikipedia.

An interesting fact is that the original wiki software was created in 1995, but it took at least another six years for large wiki-based collaborative projects to appear. Why did it take so long? One explanation is that the original wiki software lacked a selection operation and hence couldn't effectively support content evolution. The addition of revision history and the rise of large wiki-supported communities coincide in time. From an evolutionary computation point of view, this is not surprising: without a selection operation the content would undergo an aimless [[genetic drift]] and would unlikely to be useful to anyone. That is what many people expected from Wikipedia at its inception. However, with a selection operation, the utility of content has a tendency to improve over time as beneficial changes accumulate. This is what actually happens on a large scale in Wikipedia.

===Human-based genetic algorithm===
{{main|Human-based genetic algorithm}}

Human-based genetic algorithm (HBGA) provides means for human-based recombination operation (a distinctive feature of [[genetic algorithm]]s). Recombination operator brings together highly fit parts of different solutions that evolved independently. This makes the evolutionary process more efficient.

In [[computational fluid dynamics]], the '''immersed boundary method''' originally referred to an approach developed by [[Charles S. Peskin|Charles Peskin]] in 1972 to simulate fluid-structure (fiber) interactions. Treating the coupling of the structure deformations and the fluid flow poses a number of challenging problems for [[Computer simulation|numerical simulations]] (the elastic boundary changes the flow of the fluid and the fluid moves the elastic boundary simultaneously). In the immersed boundary method the fluid is represented on an [[Lagrangian and Eulerian coordinates|Eulerian coordinate]] and the structure is represented on a [[Lagrangian and Eulerian coordinates|Lagrangian coordinate]]. For [[Newtonian fluids]] governed by the incompressible [[Navier–Stokes equations]], the fluid equations are

:&lt;math&gt;
\rho
\left(\frac{\partial{u}({x},t)}{\partial{t}} + {u}\cdot\nabla{u}\right)
= -\nabla p + \mu\, \Delta u(x,t) + f(x,t) 
&lt;/math&gt;

and in case of incompressible fluids (assuming constant density) we have the condition

:&lt;math&gt;
\nabla \cdot u = 0. \,
&lt;/math&gt;

The immersed structures are typically represented as a collection of one-dimensional fibers, denoted by &lt;math&gt; \Gamma &lt;/math&gt;. Each fiber can be viewed as a parametric curve &lt;math&gt; X(s,t) &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt; s &lt;/math&gt; is the parameter and &lt;math&gt;t  &lt;/math&gt; is time. Physics of the fiber is represented via the fiber force distribution &lt;math&gt; F(s,t) &lt;/math&gt;. Spring forces, bending resistance or any other type of behavior can be built into this term. The force exerted by the structure on the fluid is then interpolated as a source term in the momentum equation using

:&lt;math&gt;
f(x,t) = \int_\Gamma F(s,t) \, \delta\big(x - X(s,t)\big) \, ds,
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \delta &lt;/math&gt; is the [[Dirac delta function|Dirac {{mvar|δ}} function]]. The forcing can be extended to multiple dimensions to model elastic surfaces or three-dimensional solids. Assuming a massless structure, the elastic fiber moves with the local fluid velocity and can be interpolated via the delta function

:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{\partial X(s,t)}{\partial t} = u(X,t) = \int_\Omega u(x,t) \, \delta\big(x - X(s,t)\big)  \, dx,
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \Omega &lt;/math&gt; denotes the entire fluid domain. 
Discretization of these equations can be done by assuming an Eulerian grid on the fluid and a separate Lagrangian grid on the fiber. 
Approximations of the Delta distribution by smoother functions will allow us to interpolate between the two grids. 
Any existing fluid solver can be coupled to a solver for the fiber equations to solve the Immersed Boundary equations.
Variants of this basic approach have been applied to simulate a wide variety of mechanical systems involving elastic structures which interact with fluid flows.

Since the original development of this method by Peskin, a variety of approaches have been developed to simulate flow over complicated immersed bodies on grids that do not conform to the surface of the body. These include methods such as the immersed interface method, the Cartesian grid method, the ghost fluid method and the cut-cell method. Mittal and Iaccarino&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mittal|Iaccarino|2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt; refer to all these (and other related) methods as Immersed Boundary Methods and provide various categorizations of these methods. From the point of view of implementation, they categorize immersed boundary methods into ''continuous forcing'' and ''discrete forcing'' methods. In the former, a force term is added to the continuous Navier-Stokes equations before discretization, whereas in the latter, the forcing is applied (explicitly or implicitly) to the discretized equations. Under this taxonomy, Peskin's original method is a ''continuous forcing'' method whereas Cartesian grid, cut-cell and the ghost-fluid methods are ''discrete forcing'' methods.

The '''Kearny air pump''' is an expedient [[air pump]] used to ventilate a [[Shelter (building)|shelter]].  The design is such that a person with normal mechanical skills can construct and operate one.  It is usually human-powered and designed to be employed during a time of crisis.

{{Infobox lithium}}
'''Lithium''' (from {{lang-el|λίθος|lithos|lit=stone}}) is a [[chemical element]] with symbol '''Li''' and [[atomic number]]&amp;nbsp;3. It is a soft, silvery-white [[alkali metal]]. Under [[standard temperature and pressure|standard conditions]], it is the lightest metal and the lightest solid element. Like all alkali metals, lithium is highly [[reactivity (chemistry)|reactive]] and flammable, and is stored in [[mineral oil]]. When cut, it exhibits a metallic [[luster (mineralogy)|luster]], but moist air [[corrosion|corrodes]] it quickly to a dull silvery gray, then black tarnish. It never occurs freely in nature, but only in (usually ionic) [[chemical compound|compounds]], such as [[pegmatite|pegmatitic]] minerals which were once the main source of lithium. Due to its solubility as an ion, it is present in ocean water and is commonly obtained from [[brine]]s. Lithium metal is isolated [[electrolysis|electrolytically]] from a mixture of [[lithium chloride]] and [[potassium chloride]].

The [[Atomic nucleus|nucleus]] of the lithium atom verges on instability, since the two stable lithium [[isotope]]s found in nature have among the lowest [[Nuclear binding energy|binding energies]] per [[nucleon]] of all stable [[nuclide]]s. Because of its relative nuclear instability, lithium is less common in the solar system than 25 of the first 32 chemical elements even though its nuclei are very light: it is an exception to the trend that heavier nuclei are less common.&lt;ref name="Lodders2003"&gt;Numerical data from: {{cite journal| doi = 10.1086/375492| last = Lodders| first = Katharina| date = 10 July 2003| title = Solar System Abundances and Condensation Temperatures of the Elements| journal = The Astrophysical Journal| publisher = The American Astronomical Society| volume = 591| issue = 2| pages = 1220–1247| url = http://weft.astro.washington.edu/courses/astro557/LODDERS.pdf| format = PDF| bibcode = 2003ApJ...591.1220L| ref = harv| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151107043527/http://weft.astro.washington.edu/courses/astro557/LODDERS.pdf| archivedate = 7 November 2015| df = dmy-all}} Graphed at [[:File:SolarSystemAbundances.jpg]]&lt;/ref&gt; For related reasons, lithium has important uses in [[nuclear physics]]. The [[Nuclear transmutation|transmutation]] of lithium atoms to [[helium]] in 1932 was the first fully man-made [[nuclear reaction]], and [[lithium deuteride]] serves as a [[nuclear fusion|fusion]] fuel in [[Teller-Ulam design|staged thermonuclear weapons]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160604211457/https://fas.org/nuke/intro/nuke/design.htm Nuclear Weapon Design]. Federation of American Scientists (1998-10-21). fas.org&lt;/ref&gt;

Lithium and its compounds have several industrial applications, including heat-resistant glass and [[ceramic]]s, [[lithium grease]] lubricants, flux additives for iron, steel and aluminium production, [[lithium battery|lithium batteries]], and [[lithium-ion battery|lithium-ion batteries]]. These uses consume more than three quarters of lithium production.

Lithium is present in biological systems in trace amounts; its functions are uncertain. Lithium [[salt (chemistry)|salts]] have proven to be useful as a [[mood stabilizer|mood-stabilizing]] drug in the treatment of [[bipolar disorder]] in humans.

==Properties==
===Atomic and physical===
[[File:Limetal.JPG|thumb|upright=0.7|left|Lithium ingots with a thin layer of black nitride tarnish]]
Like the other [[alkali metal]]s, lithium has a single [[valence electron]] that is easily given up to form a [[cation]].&lt;ref name=krebs/&gt; Because of this, lithium is a good conductor of heat and electricity as well as a highly reactive element, though it is the least reactive of the alkali metals. Lithium's low reactivity is due to the proximity of its valence electron to its [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]] (the remaining [[Two-electron atom|two electrons]] are in the [[s-orbital|1s orbital]], much lower in energy, and do not participate in chemical bonds).&lt;ref name=krebs/&gt;

Lithium metal is soft enough to be cut with a knife. When cut, it possesses a silvery-white color that quickly changes to gray as it oxidizes to [[lithium oxide]].&lt;ref name=krebs/&gt; While it has one of the [[List of elements by melting point|lowest melting points]] among all metals (180&amp;nbsp;°C), it has the highest melting and boiling points of the alkali metals.&lt;ref&gt;{{RubberBible86th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lithium has a very low density (0.534&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), comparable with pine wood. It is the least dense of all elements that are solids at room temperature; the next lightest solid element (potassium, at 0.862&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) is more than 60% denser. Furthermore, apart from [[helium]] and [[hydrogen]], it is less dense than any liquid element, being only two thirds as dense as [[liquid nitrogen]] (0.808&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://encyclopedia.airliquide.com/Encyclopedia.asp?LanguageID=11&amp;CountryID=19&amp;Formula=&amp;GasID=5&amp;UNNumber=&amp;EquivGasID=32&amp;VolLiquideBox=&amp;MasseLiquideBox=&amp;VolGasBox=&amp;MasseGasBox=&amp;RD20=29&amp;RD9=8&amp;RD6=64&amp;RD4=2&amp;RD3=22&amp;RD8=27&amp;RD2=20&amp;RD18=41&amp;RD7=18&amp;RD13=71&amp;RD16=35&amp;RD12=31&amp;RD19=34&amp;RD24=62&amp;RD25=77&amp;RD26=78&amp;RD28=81&amp;RD29=82 |title=Nitrogen, N2, Physical properties, safety, MSDS, enthalpy, material compatibility, gas liquid equilibrium, density, viscosity, inflammability, transport properties |publisher=Encyclopedia.airliquide.com |accessdate=29 September 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721162642/http://encyclopedia.airliquide.com/Encyclopedia.asp?LanguageID=11&amp;CountryID=19&amp;Formula=&amp;GasID=5&amp;UNNumber=&amp;EquivGasID=32&amp;VolLiquideBox=&amp;MasseLiquideBox=&amp;VolGasBox=&amp;MasseGasBox=&amp;RD20=29&amp;RD9=8&amp;RD6=64&amp;RD4=2&amp;RD3=22&amp;RD8=27&amp;RD2=20&amp;RD18=41&amp;RD7=18&amp;RD13=71&amp;RD16=35&amp;RD12=31&amp;RD19=34&amp;RD24=62&amp;RD25=77&amp;RD26=78&amp;RD28=81&amp;RD29=82 |archivedate=21 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lithium can float on the lightest hydrocarbon oils and is one of only three metals that can float on water, the other two being [[sodium]] and [[potassium]].

Lithium has a mass [[specific heat capacity]]  of 3.58 kilojoules per kilogram-kelvin, the highest of all solids.&lt;ref name= CRC/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140823211840/http://hilltop.bradley.edu/~spost/THERMO/solidcp.pdf SPECIFIC HEAT OF SOLIDS]. bradley.edu&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, lithium metal is often used in [[coolant]]s for [[heat transfer]] applications.&lt;ref name=CRC/&gt;

===Chemistry and compounds===
Lithium reacts with water easily, but with noticeably less vigor than other alkali metals. The reaction forms [[hydrogen]] gas and [[lithium hydroxide]] in aqueous solution.&lt;ref name=krebs/&gt; Because of its reactivity with water, lithium is usually stored in a hydrocarbon sealant, often [[petroleum jelly]]. Though the heavier alkali metals can be stored in more dense substances, such as [[mineral oil]], lithium is not dense enough to be fully submerged in these liquids.&lt;ref name=emsley/&gt; In moist air, lithium rapidly tarnishes to form a black coating of [[lithium hydroxide]] (LiOH and LiOH·H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O), [[lithium nitride]] (Li&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;N) and [[lithium carbonate]] (Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, the result of a secondary reaction between LiOH and [[carbon dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]).&lt;ref name="kamienski" /&gt;

When placed over a flame, lithium compounds give off a striking crimson color, but when it burns strongly the flame becomes a brilliant silver. Lithium will ignite and burn in oxygen when exposed to water or water vapors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1039/QJ8611300270|title=XXIV.—On chemical analysis by spectrum-observations|date=1861|journal=Quarterly Journal of the Chemical Society of London|volume=13|issue=3|page=270 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lithium is [[flammable]], and it is potentially explosive when exposed to air and especially to water, though less so than the other [[alkali metals]]. The lithium-water reaction at normal temperatures is brisk but nonviolent because the hydrogen produced does not ignite on its own. As with all alkali metals, lithium fires are difficult to extinguish, requiring dry powder fire extinguishers ([[Class D fire extinguisher|Class D]] type). Lithium is one of the few metals that react with [[nitrogen]] under [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|normal conditions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=47|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yb9xTj72vNAC&amp;pg=PA47|title=The history and use of our earth's chemical elements: a reference guide|author=Krebs, Robert E.|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|date=2006|isbn=0-313-33438-2|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160804025424/https://books.google.com/books?id=yb9xTj72vNAC&amp;pg=PA47|archivedate=4 August 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Institute, American Geological|author2=Union, American Geophysical|author3=Society, Geochemical|title=Geochemistry international|volume=31|issue=1–4|page=115|date=1 January 1994|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=77McAQAAIAAJ|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160604195805/https://books.google.com/books?id=77McAQAAIAAJ|archivedate=4 June 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lithium has a [[diagonal relationship]] with [[magnesium]], an element of similar atomic and [[ionic radius]].

Other known [[binary compound]]s include [[halide]]s ([[lithium fluoride|LiF]], [[lithium chloride|LiCl]], [[lithium bromide|LiBr]], [[Lithium iodide|LiI]]), [[sulfide]] ([[lithium sulfide|{{chem|Li|2|S}}]]), [[superoxide]] ([[Lithium superoxide|{{chem|LiO|2}}]]), and [[carbide]] ([[Lithium carbide|{{chem|Li|2|C|2}}]]).

Naturally occurring lithium is composed of two stable [[isotope]]s, &lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;Li and &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;Li, the latter being the more abundant (92.5% [[natural abundance]]).&lt;ref name=krebs/&gt;&lt;ref name=emsley/&gt;&lt;ref name=isotopesproject&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ie.lbl.gov/education/parent/Li_iso.htm|title=Isotopes of Lithium|accessdate=21 April 2008|publisher=Berkeley National Laboratory, The Isotopes Project|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513123152/http://ie.lbl.gov/education/parent/Li_iso.htm|archivedate=13 May 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both natural isotopes have anomalously low [[nuclear binding energy]] per nucleon (compared to the neighboring elements on the [[Periodic chart of the elements|periodic table]], [[helium]] and [[beryllium]]); lithium is the only low numbered element that can produce net energy through [[nuclear fission]]. The two lithium nuclei have lower binding energies per nucleon than any other stable nuclides other than [[deuterium]] and [[helium-3]].&lt;ref name=bind&gt;[[:File:Binding energy curve - common isotopes.svg]] shows binding energies of stable nuclides graphically; the source of the data-set is given in the figure background.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of this, though very light in atomic weight, lithium is less common in the Solar System than 25 of the first 32 chemical elements.&lt;ref name="Lodders2003" /&gt; Seven [[radioisotope]]s have been characterized, the most stable being &lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;Li with a [[half-life]] of 838 [[millisecond|ms]] and &lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;Li with a half-life of 178&amp;nbsp;ms.

Nuclear weapons manufacture and other nuclear physics applications are a major source of artificial lithium fractionation, with the light isotope &lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;Li being retained by industry and military stockpiles to such an extent that it has caused slight but measurable change in the &lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;Li to &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;Li ratios in natural sources, such as rivers.

{{Main|Nucleosynthesis}}
Though it was synthesized in the [[Big Bang]], lithium (together with beryllium and boron), is markedly less abundant in the universe than other elements. This is a result of the comparatively low stellar temperatures necessary to destroy lithium, along with a lack of common processes to produce it.&lt;ref name=wesleyan&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astro.wesleyan.edu/~bill/courses/astr231/wes_only/element_abundances.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060901133923/http://www.astro.wesleyan.edu/~bill/courses/astr231/wes_only/element_abundances.pdf |archivedate=1 September 2006 |title=Element Abundances |accessdate=17 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to modern cosmological theory, lithium—in both stable isotopes (lithium-6 and lithium-7)—was one of the three elements [[nucleosynthesis|synthesized]] in the Big Bang.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | bibcode= 1985ARA&amp;A..23..319B | title= Big bang nucleosynthesis – Theories and observations | last1= Boesgaard | first1=A.

Lithium is also found in [[brown dwarf]] substellar objects and certain anomalous orange stars.

The production and use of lithium underwent several drastic changes in history. The first major application of lithium was in high-temperature [[lithium grease]]s for aircraft engines and similar applications in [[World War II]] and shortly after. This use was supported by the fact that lithium-based soaps have a higher melting point than other alkali soaps, and are less corrosive than calcium based soaps. The small demand for lithium soaps and lubricating greases was supported by several small mining operations, mostly in the US.

The demand for lithium increased dramatically during the [[Cold War]] with the production of [[Nuclear weapon design|nuclear fusion weapons]]. Both lithium-6 and lithium-7 produce [[tritium]] when irradiated by neutrons, and are thus useful for the production of tritium by itself, as well as a form of solid fusion fuel used inside hydrogen bombs in the form of [[lithium deuteride]]. The US became the prime producer of lithium between the late 1950s and the mid 1980s. At the end, the stockpile of lithium was roughly 42,000 tonnes of lithium hydroxide. The stockpiled lithium was depleted in lithium-6 by 75%, which was enough to affect the measured [[atomic weight]] of lithium in many standardized chemicals, and even the atomic weight of lithium in some "natural sources" of lithium ion which had been "contaminated" by lithium salts discharged from isotope separation facilities, which had found its way into ground water.&lt;ref name = "Coplen2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="USGSCR1994"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/lithium/450494.pdf|title = Commodity Report 1994: Lithium|publisher = United States Geological Survey|accessdate = 3 November 2010|date = 1994|first = Joyce A.|last = Ober|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100609113707/http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/lithium/450494.pdf|archivedate = 9 June 2010|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!--With only 7.5% of lithium-6 this makes ca. 2,200 tonnes of lithium-6.--&gt;

After the end of the [[nuclear arms race]], the demand for lithium decreased and the sale of department of energy stockpiles on the open market further reduced prices.&lt;ref name="USGSCR1994"/&gt; In the mid 1990s, several companies started to extract lithium from [[brine]] which proved to be a less expensive option than underground or open-pit mining. Most of the mines closed or shifted their focus to other materials because only the ore from zoned pegmatites could be mined for a competitive price. For example, the US mines near [[Kings Mountain, North Carolina|Kings Mountain]], North Carolina closed before the beginning of the 21st century.

[[File:Lithium world production.svg|thumb|World production trend of lithium]]

Lithium production has greatly increased since the end of [[World War II]]. The metal is separated from other elements in [[igneous rock|igneous minerals]]. The metal is produced through [[electrolysis]] from a mixture of fused 55% [[lithium chloride]] and 45% [[potassium chloride]] at about 450&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw2nd|page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2015, most of the world's lithium production is in South America, where lithium-containing brine is extracted from underground pools and concentrated by solar evaporation.  The standard extraction technique is to evaporate water from brine. Each batch takes from 18 to 24 months.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/538036/quest-to-mine-seawater-for-lithium-advances/|title=Quest to Mine Seawater for Lithium Advances|last=Martin|first=Richard|date=2015-06-08|website=MIT Technology Review|access-date=2016-02-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US, lithium is recovered from brine pools in [[Nevada]].&lt;ref name="CRC"&gt;{{Cite book| author = Hammond, C.

Additional deposits in the same formation were estimated to be as much as 18 million tons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Money Game Contributors |url=http://www.businessinsider.com/new-wyoming-lithium-deposit-could-meet-all-us-demand-2013-4 |title=New Wyoming Lithium Deposit |publisher=Business Insider |date=26 April 2013 |accessdate=1 May 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130503085509/http://www.businessinsider.com/new-wyoming-lithium-deposit-could-meet-all-us-demand-2013-4 |archivedate=3 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opinions differ about potential growth. A 2008 study concluded that "realistically achievable lithium carbonate production will be sufficient for only a small fraction of future [[PHEV]] and [[electric vehicle|EV]] global market requirements", that "demand from the portable electronics sector will absorb much of the planned production increases in the next decade", and that "mass production of lithium carbonate is not environmentally sound, it will cause irreparable ecological damage to ecosystems that should be protected and that [[LiIon]] propulsion is incompatible with the notion of the 'Green Car'".&lt;ref name="meridian" /&gt;

According to a 2011 study by [[Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory]] and the [[University of California, Berkeley]], the currently estimated reserve base of lithium should not be a limiting factor for large-scale battery production for electric vehicles because an estimated 1 billion 40 [[kWh]] Li-based batteries could be built with current reserves&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wadia |first1=Cyrus |last2=Albertus |first2=Paul |last3=Srinivasan |first3=Venkat |title=Resource constraints on the battery energy storage potential for grid and transportation applications |journal=Journal of Power Sources |volume=196 |issue=3 |year=2011 |pages=1593–8 |doi=10.1016/j.jpowsour.2010.08.056 |bibcode=2011JPS...196.1593W }}&lt;/ref&gt; - about 10&amp;nbsp;kg of lithium per car.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anl.gov/energy-systems/publication/lithium-ion-batteries-examining-material-demand-and-recycling-issues|title=Lithium-Ion Batteries: Examining Material Demand and Recycling Issues|author=Gaines, LL.

The study estimated global reserves at 39 million tons, and total demand for lithium during the 90-year period annualized at 12–20 million tons, depending on the scenarios regarding economic growth and recycling rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greencarcongress.com/2011/08/lithium-20110803.html|title=University of Michigan and Ford researchers see plentiful lithium resources for electric vehicles|publisher=[[Green Car Congress]]|date=3 August 2011|accessdate=11 August 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110916075249/http://www.greencarcongress.com/2011/08/lithium-20110803.html|archivedate=16 September 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 June 2014, the ''Financialist'' stated that demand for lithium was growing at more than 12% a year. According to Credit Suisse, this rate exceeds projected availability by 25%. The publication compared the 2014 lithium situation with oil, whereby "higher oil prices spurred investment in expensive deepwater and oil sands production techniques"; that is, the price of lithium will continue to rise until more expensive production methods that can boost total output receive the attention of investors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Precious Mobile Metal|url=http://www.thefinancialist.com/spark/the-precious-mobile-metal/|website=The Financialist|publisher=Credit Suisse|accessdate=19 June 2014|date=9 June 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160223144634/https://www.thefinancialist.com/spark/the-precious-mobile-metal/|archivedate=23 February 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 July 2018 2.5 million tonnes of high-grade lithium resources and 124 million pounds of uranium resources were found in the Falchani hard rock deposit in the region Puno, Peru.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Plateau Energy Metals Peru unit finds large lithium resources|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/peru-lithium/update-1-plateau-energy-metals-peru-unit-finds-large-lithium-resources-idUSL1N1UC0XF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pricing ===
After the [[Financial crisis of 2007–08|2007 financial crisis]], major suppliers, such as [[Sociedad Química y Minera]] (SQM), dropped [[lithium carbonate]] pricing by 20%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sqm-announces-new-lithium-prices-62933122.html |title=SQM Announces New Lithium Prices – SANTIAGO, Chile|agency=PR Newswire |date=30 September 2009 |accessdate=1 May 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130530015745/http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/sqm-announces-new-lithium-prices-62933122.html |archivedate=30 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prices rose in 2012. A 2012 [[Bloomberg Businessweek|Business Week]] article outlined the [[oligopoly]] in the lithium space: "SQM, controlled by billionaire [[Julio Ponce Lerou|Julio Ponce]], is the second-largest, followed by [[Albemarle Corporation#Acquisition of Rockwood Holdings|Rockwood]], which is backed by [[Henry Kravis|Henry Kravis’s]] KKR &amp; Co., and Philadelphia-based FMC", with [[Talison Minerals|Talison]] mentioned as the biggest producer.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Global consumption may jump to 300,000 metric tons a year by 2020 from about 150,000 tons in 2012, to match the demand for lithium batteries that has been growing at about 25% a year, outpacing the 4% to 5% overall gain in lithium production.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Riseborough |first=Jesse |url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-06-19/ipad-boom-strains-lithium-supplies-after-prices-triple |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120622183939/http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-06-19/ipad-boom-strains-lithium-supplies-after-prices-triple |dead-url=yes |archive-date=22 June 2012 |title=IPad Boom Strains Lithium Supplies After Prices Triple |work=Bloomberg BusinessWeek |accessdate=1 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Extraction ===
Lithium salts are extracted from water in [[mineral springs]], [[brine]] pools, and brine deposits. Brine excavation is probably the only lithium extraction technology widely used today, as actual mining of lithium ores is much more expensive and has been priced out of the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wealthdaily.com/articles/lithium-a-long-term-investment/5064|title=Lithium: A Long-Term Investment Buy Lithium!|last=Cafariello|first=Joseph|date=10 March 2014|publisher=wealthdaily.com|accessdate=2015-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-07-16/largest-lithium-deal-triggered-by-smartphones-and-teslas|title=Largest Lithium Deal Triggered by Smartphones and Teslas|last=Kaskey|first=Jack|date=16 July 2014|publisher=[[bloomberg.com]]|accessdate=2015-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lithium is present in seawater, but commercially viable methods of extraction have yet to be developed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Another potential source of lithium is the leachates of [[Geothermal electricity|geothermal wells]], which are carried to the surface.&lt;ref name="bourcier"&gt;Parker, Ann. [https://www.llnl.gov/str/JanFeb05/Bourcier.html Mining Geothermal Resources] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120917035952/https://www.llnl.gov/str/JanFeb05/Bourcier.html |date=17 September 2012 }}.

=== Investment ===
{{main|Lithium as an investment}}
Currently, there are a number of options available in the marketplace to invest in the metal. While buying physical stock of lithium is hardly possible, investors can buy shares of companies engaged in lithium mining and producing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://commodityhq.com/commodity/rare-earthstrategic-metals/lithium-/|title=How to Invest in Lithium|publisher=commodityhq.com|accessdate=2015-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, investors can purchase a dedicated lithium ETF offering exposure to a group of commodity producers.

===Ceramics and glass===
Lithium oxide is widely used as a [[Flux (metallurgy)|flux]] for processing [[silica]], reducing the [[melting point]] and [[viscosity]] of the material and leading to [[ceramic glaze|glazes]] with improved physical properties including low coefficients of thermal expansion. Worldwide, this is one of the largest use for lithium compounds.&lt;ref name="Li-uses-2011"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fmclithium.com/Portals/FMCLithiumFineChemicals/Content/Docs/Worldwide%20Demand%20by%20Sector.pdf Worldwide demand by sector] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140907204758/http://www.fmclithium.com/Portals/FMCLithiumFineChemicals/Content/Docs/Worldwide%20Demand%20by%20Sector.pdf |date=7 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Glazes containing lithium oxides are used for ovenware. [[Lithium carbonate]] (Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) is generally used in this application  because it converts to the oxide upon heating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chemguide.co.uk/inorganic/group1/compounds.html |title=Some Compounds of the Group 1 Elements |last1=Clark |first1=Jim |date=2005 |website=chemguide.co.uk |accessdate=8 August 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130627011258/http://www.chemguide.co.uk/inorganic/group1/compounds.html |archivedate=27 June 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Electrical and electronics===
Late in the 20th century, lithium became an important component of battery electrolytes and electrodes, because of its high [[electrode potential]]. Because of its low [[atomic mass]], it has a high charge- and power-to-weight ratio. A typical [[lithium-ion battery]] can generate approximately 3 [[volt]]s per cell, compared with 2.1 volts for [[lead–acid battery|lead-acid]] and 1.5 volts for [[zinc-carbon cell|zinc-carbon]]. Lithium-ion batteries, which are rechargeable and have a high [[energy density]], differ from [[lithium batteries]], which are [[disposable]] ([[primary cell|primary]]) [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]] with lithium or its compounds as the [[anode]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.batteryreview.org/disposable-batteries.html |title=Disposable Batteries - Choosing between Alkaline and Lithium Disposable Batteries |publisher=Batteryreview.org |accessdate=10 October 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140106031920/http://www.batteryreview.org/disposable-batteries.html |archivedate=6 January 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.emc2.cornell.edu/content/view/battery-anodes.html |title=Battery Anodes &gt; Batteries &amp; Fuel Cells &gt; Research &gt; The Energy Materials Center at Cornell |publisher=Emc2.cornell.edu |accessdate=10 October 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131222234030/http://www.emc2.cornell.edu/content/view/battery-anodes.html |archivedate=22 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other rechargeable batteries that use lithium include the [[lithium-ion polymer battery]], [[lithium iron phosphate battery]], and the [[nanowire battery]].

===Lubricating greases===
{{main|Lithium grease}}
The third most common use of lithium is in greases. Lithium hydroxide is a strong [[base (chemistry)|base]] and, when heated with a fat, produces a soap made of lithium [[stearate]].

[[File:Castle Bravo Blast.jpg|thumb|Lithium deuteride was used as fuel in the [[Castle Bravo]] nuclear device.]]
[[Lithium deuteride]] was the [[nuclear fusion|fusion fuel]] of choice in early versions of the [[Nuclear weapon|hydrogen bomb]]. When bombarded by [[neutron]]s, both &lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;Li and &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;Li produce [[tritium]] — this reaction, which was not fully understood when [[Teller-Ulam design|hydrogen bombs]] were first tested, was responsible for the runaway yield of the [[Castle Bravo]] [[nuclear test]]. Tritium fuses with [[deuterium]] in a [[Nuclear fusion|fusion]] reaction that is relatively easy to achieve. Although details remain secret, lithium-6 deuteride apparently still plays a role in modern [[nuclear weapons]] as a fusion material.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yTIOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA39|page=39|title=How nuclear weapons spread: nuclear-weapon proliferation in the 1990s|author=Barnaby, Frank|publisher=Routledge|date=1993|isbn=0-415-07674-9|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160609210558/https://books.google.com/books?id=yTIOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA39|archivedate=9 June 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lithium fluoride]], when highly enriched in the lithium-7 isotope, forms the basic constituent of the fluoride salt mixture LiF-[[beryllium fluoride|BeF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] used in [[molten salt reactor|liquid fluoride nuclear reactors]]. Lithium fluoride is exceptionally chemically stable and LiF-BeF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; mixtures have low melting points.

In conceptualized (hypothetical) nuclear [[fusion power]] plants, lithium will be used to produce tritium in [[Magnetic confinement fusion|magnetically confined reactors]] using [[deuterium]] and [[tritium]] as the fuel. Naturally occurring tritium is extremely rare, and must be synthetically produced by surrounding the reacting [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] with a 'blanket' containing lithium where neutrons from the deuterium-tritium reaction in the plasma will fission the lithium to produce more tritium:
:&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;Li + n → &lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;He + &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;H.

Lithium is also used as a source for [[alpha particle]]s, or [[helium]] nuclei. When &lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;Li is bombarded by accelerated [[proton]]s &lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;[[beryllium|Be]] is formed, which undergoes fission to form two alpha particles. This feat, called "splitting the atom" at the time, was the first fully man-made [[nuclear reaction]]. It was produced by [[John Douglas Cockcroft|Cockroft]] and [[Ernest Walton|Walton]] in 1932.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XyOBx2R2CxEC&amp;pg=PA139|page=139|title=Nobel Prize Winners in Physics|author=Agarwal, Arun|publisher=APH Publishing|date=2008|isbn=81-7648-743-0|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160629143432/https://books.google.com/books?id=XyOBx2R2CxEC&amp;pg=PA139|archivedate=29 June 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-outreach.phy.cam.ac.uk/camphy/cockcroftwalton/cockcroftwalton9_1.htm "'Splitting the Atom': Cockcroft and Walton, 1932: 9.

In 2013, the US [[Government Accountability Office]] said a shortage of lithium-7 critical to the operation of 65 out of 100 American nuclear reactors “places their ability to continue to provide electricity at some risk”. The problem stems from the decline of US nuclear infrastructure. The equipment needed to separate lithium-6 from lithium-7 is mostly a cold war leftover. The US shut down most of this machinery in 1963, when it had a huge surplus of separated lithium, mostly consumed during the twentieth century. The report said it would take five years and $10 million to $12 million to reestablish the ability to separate lithium-6 from lithium-7.&lt;ref name=nyt1013/&gt;

Reactors that use lithium-7 heat water under high pressure and transfer heat through heat exchangers that are prone to corrosion. The reactors use lithium to counteract the corrosive effects of [[boric acid]], which is added to the water to absorb excess neutrons.&lt;ref name=nyt1013&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/09/business/energy-environment/report-says-a-shortage-of-nuclear-fuel-looms.html |title=Report Says a Shortage of Nuclear Ingredient Looms |author=Wald, Matthew L. |date=8 October 2013 |work=The New York Times |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170701025300/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/09/business/energy-environment/report-says-a-shortage-of-nuclear-fuel-looms.html |archivedate=1 July 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lithium is useful in the treatment of [[bipolar disorder]].&lt;ref name = "kean"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kean|first=Sam|title=The Disappearing Spoon|date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lithium salts may also be helpful for related diagnoses, such as [[schizoaffective disorder]] and cyclic [[major depression]]. The active part of these salts is the lithium ion Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name = "kean"/&gt; They may increase the risk of developing [[Ebstein's anomaly|Ebstein's cardiac anomaly]] in infants born to women who take lithium during the first trimester of pregnancy.&lt;ref name="pmid18982835"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Yacobi S |author2= Ornoy A |title=Is lithium a real teratogen?

Lithium has also been researched as a possible treatment for [[cluster headache]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lieb|first=J.|last2=Zeff|title=Lithium treatment of chronic cluster headaches.|journal=The British Journal of Psychiatry|date=1978|issue=6|pages=556–558|doi=10.1192/bjp.133.6.556|volume=133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biological role==
{{See also|Lithium (medication)}}
Primary food sources of lithium are grains and vegetables, and, in some areas, [[drinking water]] also contains significant amounts.&lt;ref name="schrauzer"&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=11838882|year=2002|author1=Schrauzer|first1=G.

Lithium was first detected in human organs and fetal tissues in the late 19th century. In humans there are no defined lithium deficiency diseases, but low lithium intakes from water supplies were associated with increased rates of suicides, homicides and the arrest rates for drug use and other crimes. The biochemical mechanisms of action of lithium appear to be multifactorial and are intercorrelated with the functions of several enzymes, hormones and vitamins, as well as with growth and transforming factors. Evidence now appears to be sufficient to accept lithium as essential; a provisional RDA of 1,000&amp;nbsp;µg/day is suggested for a 70&amp;nbsp;kg adult.&lt;ref name=schrauzer/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Marshall |first1=Timothy M. |title=Lithium as a Nutrient |journal=Journal of American Physicians and Surgeons |volume=20 |issue=4 |year=2015 |pages=104–9 |url=http://www.jpands.org/vol20no4/marshall.pdf |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170215071419/http://www.jpands.org/vol20no4/marshall.pdf |archivedate=15 February 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lithium is [[corrosive]] and requires special handling to avoid skin contact. Breathing lithium dust or lithium compounds (which are often alkaline) initially [[irritation|irritate]] the [[human nose|nose]] and throat, while higher exposure can cause a buildup of fluid in the [[lung]]s, leading to [[pulmonary edema]]. The metal itself is a handling hazard because contact with moisture produces the [[Corrosive substance|caustic]] lithium hydroxide. Lithium is safely stored in non-reactive compounds such as [[naphtha]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.com/?id=Oo3xAmmMlEwC&amp;pg=PA244|pages = 244–246|isbn = 978-0-8493-2523-6|author = Furr, A.

===Regulation===
Some jurisdictions limit the sale of [[lithium batteries]], which are the most readily available source of lithium for ordinary consumers. Lithium can be used to reduce [[pseudoephedrine]] and [[ephedrine]] to [[methamphetamine]] in the [[Birch reduction]] method, which employs solutions of alkali metals dissolved in anhydrous [[ammonia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.illinoisattorneygeneral.gov/methnet/understandingmeth/basics.html |title=Illinois Attorney General&amp;nbsp;– Basic Understanding Of Meth |publisher=Illinoisattorneygeneral.gov |accessdate=6 October 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100910041147/http://www.illinoisattorneygeneral.gov/methnet/understandingmeth/basics.html |archivedate=10 September 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.ncjolt.org/sites/default/files/7_nc_jl_tech_421.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201171656/http://www.ncjolt.org/sites/default/files/7_nc_jl_tech_421.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2008-12-01|format=PDF|accessdate=5 October 2010|title=Methamphetamine remediation research act of 2005: Just what the doctor ordered for cleaning up methfields—or sugar pill placebo?| journal=North Carolina Journal of Law &amp; Technology|date=2006|volume=7|first=Aaron R.|last= Harmon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carriage and shipment of some kinds of lithium batteries may be prohibited aboard certain types of transportation (particularly aircraft) because of the ability of most types of lithium batteries to fully discharge very rapidly when [[short circuit|short-circuited]], leading to overheating and possible [[explosion]] in a process called [[thermal runaway]]. Most consumer lithium batteries have built-in thermal overload protection to prevent this type of incident, or are otherwise designed to limit short-circuit currents. Internal shorts from manufacturing defect or physical damage can lead to spontaneous thermal runaway.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|isbn = 978-0-306-44758-7|pages = 15–16|url = https://books.google.com/?id=i7U-0IB8tjMC&amp;pg=PA15|author = Bro, Per|author2 = Levy, Samuel C.|last-author-amp = yes|date = 1994|publisher = Plenum Press|location = New York|title = Battery hazards and accident prevention}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tsa.gov/travelers/airtravel/assistant/batteries.shtm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120104141539/http://www.tsa.gov/travelers/airtravel/assistant/batteries.shtm |archivedate=4 January 2012 |title=TSA: Safe Travel with Batteries and Devices |publisher=Tsa.gov |date=1 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Magnetically controlled shunt reactor (MCSR, CSR) represents electrotechnical equipment purposed for compensation of [[reactive power]] and stabilization of voltage level in high voltage (HV) electric networks rated for voltage classes 36 – 750 kV. MCSR is shunt-type static device with smooth regulation by means of [[inductive reactance]].

==Purpose==
Magnetically controlled shunt reactors are intended for automatic control over [[reactive power]] and stabilization of voltage levels; these ensure the following: 

[[File:УШР 25 МВАр 110кВ.JPG|thumb|right|Magnetically controlled shunt reactor 25 MVAr 110 kV]]

* Elimination of daily and seasonal voltage variations in the power network;&lt;ref name="Russia Grids builds new power lines between Krasnoyarsk Krai and Irkutsk Oblast"&gt;[http://www.rosseti.ru/eng/press/news/?ELEMENT_ID=17459 Russia Grids builds new power lines between Krasnoyarsk Krai and Irkutsk Oblast]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Improvement of electric power quality;
* Optimization and automation of power network operating modes;
* Reduction of electric power losses within its [[electric power transmission|transmission]] and [[electric power distribution|distribution]];
* Improvement of power system stability;
* Enhancement of the conditions of operation in tens of times and prolongation of service life of the electric equipment by virtue of dynamic shortcut of switchings of uncontrolled devices for reactive power compensation as well as limitation of operation of less reliable devices – OLTC, [[transformer]]s and autotransformers
* Increasing of transmission line throughput performance and provision of reliable automatic control over voltage levels at power overflows close to limit values as referred to static stability;
* Avoiding of voltage collapse effect at emergency situations in the power network (for example, emergency trip of load, generator, transmission line, etc.;
* Assurance of operating conditions for power plant generators in such reaction power generation range which assist to the most favorable operating modes.

==Field of application==
On the assumption of tasks to be solved by MCSRs, as well as with consideration of existing experience of their operation, application field of controlled reactors covers (but not limited) the following areas of the power networks:
* networks with abrupt-changed load curves ;
* networks with worn-out switching and transformer equipment been used frequently for regulation of voltage levels;
* networks made using long-length transits, which tend to frequent variation of power flows’ value and/or direction;
* networks for power supply of the consumers with enhanced demand of voltage stability;
* networks with increased losses;
* networks having operating mode, which does not allow to provide permissible load of the generators as referred to reactive power.

Ample opportunities of MCSRs ensure expediency of their application for different voltage classes. Furthermore, expected effect could be shown up both at the level of local area consumer’s grids, and at solving the primary tasks of the national power system as a whole.

In the context of building-up of the market relations in the electric energy sector and increase of investments for development of power networks, MCSRs offer the complete series of considerable benefits for all economic entities:
* at the level of feeding and distribution electric networks, MCSRs ensure significant reduction of electric power losses and increase of profits of system operator and distribution companies, respectively;
* as referred to electric power consumers, MCSRs are installed for the purpose of reduction of the charges to be paid for consumed reactive power (maintaining of cos (ɸ)), ensuring the required voltage quality at the point of final customers, as well as in the capacity of required measures for connection of new capacities to the network.

==Operating principle==
Magnetically controlled shunt reactor is the transformer-type device which additionally provides functions of semiconducting key apparatus; this is ensured by means of reactor magnetic system operation in the domain of deep saturation. The basing principle allowed optimal employment of existing designs both in transformer production industry, and in the field of power electronics.Magnetic system of MCSR single phase includes two cores with windings, vertical and horizontal yokes. Control windings with opposite connection and power windings with series (accordant) connection are arranged on CST magnetic system cores. MCSR magnetic system cores are free from nonmagnetic gaps, and owing to this effect in case of the reactor connection to the network it will be in no-load condition. Herewith, the value of [[reactive power]] consumed from the grid will not exceed 3% of nominal magnitude. To increase reactor load as for reactive power, its operating range should be offset to non-linear area of hysteresis characteristic; and this is achieved for the account of additional biasing of magnetic system. At connection of regulated dc voltage source to the control windings, increase of the bias flux is ensured.[[File:УШР2.jpg|thumb|right|Simplified MCSR connection diagram]]

Due to the fact that ac flow of power winding is superimposed on the bias flux, the net flux is offset to the saturation domain of magnetic system cores. Respectively, saturation of the cores is resulted in occurrence of current in the power winding.  In case of energy input to or output from the control circuit, the transient process of increase or decrease of network current and, respectively, of reactive power consumed by reactor is ensured.

[[File:УШР1.png|thumb|left|MCSR processes during power increase/relief]]Reactor power winding current is regulated according to proportional control mode, when control angle of rectified current source thyristors is changed according to proportional mode depending on mismatching between the prescribed voltage setting and the voltage at the point of reactor connection. In case of necessity to implement the rapid transfer of the reactor from one quasi-steady-state mode to another one, the scheme of overexcitation/underexcitation is realized. In such case, time to gain full power starting from no-load condition is reduced up to 0,3 s. Constructively, it is possible to ensure every speed of the reactor power variation. However, based on practical experience of MCSR application, the optimal balance between the reactor operating speed and capacity of biasing system has been determined: speed of power increase/relief within 0,3 – 1,0 s, capacity of biasing system – 1 – 2% of the reactor rated capacity. [[File:MCSR.jpg|thumb|left|Saturation of electrical steel]] Depending upon desired requirements, MCSR is adjusted in such a way that would be possible to realize either voltage level stabilization, or consumed reactive power value, or consumed current magnitude. Controlled reactors, same as their non-controlled analogues, are subdivided into bus reactors and line reactors. Based on this principle, MCSR design would be completed with additional element which ensures pre-biasing of electromagnetic part and subsequent inertialess energizing of the reactor (with power increase time less than one cycle of power frequency). Similar to all transformer equipment, MCSR is able to withstand long-term overload up to 120 – 130% as well as should-term overload up to 200%. Moreover, considering the additional measures and the control algorithms, MCSR realizes all functions of uncontrolled shunt reactor including ability to operate within the interval of single-phase automatic reclosing.

'''Mangalore Electricity Supply Company Limited''' (abbreviated as '''MESCOM''') is an [[India]]n electricity supplier to the districts of [[Karnataka]] namely [[Dakshina Kannada]], [[Udupi district]], [[Chickmagalur]] and [[Shimoga]]. It has its headquarters at [[Mangalore|Mangaluru]].The company was formed on June 2002.

Karnataka Electricity Board (KEB) which was earlier involved in Transmission &amp; Distribution of electricity in state of Karnataka was corporatised into Karnataka Power Transmission Corporation Limited ([[KPTCL]]).

Later distribution wing was carved out of this company &amp; five companies were formed to cater distribution of electricity to different regions of [[Karnataka state]]. Initially four entities were formed first namely MESCOM, [[BESCOM]], HESCOM and GESCOM. Later CESCOM was carved out of MESCOM in 2005  to cater electricity consumers of Mysore region.

Currently KPTCL looks after only Transmission and the Electricity Supply Companies (ESCOM's) look after distribution.The distribution to last mile or end users is done by this Electricity Supply Companies (ESCOM's ) in the state of Karnataka.The electricity generated by Karnataka Power Corporation Limited and other producers is distributed by these ESCOM's.

'''Natural resource economics''' deals with the [[Supply (economics)|supply]], [[Demand (economics)|demand]], and [[Resource allocation|allocation]] of the [[Earth]]'s [[natural resource]]s. One main objective of natural resource economics is to better understand the role of natural resources in the economy in order to develop more [[Sustainability|sustainable]] methods of managing those resources to ensure their availability to future generations. Resource economists study interactions between economic and natural systems, with the goal of developing a sustainable and efficient economy.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uri.edu/cels/enre/ University of Rhode Island Department of Environmental and Natural Resource Economics Retrieved October-22-09&lt;/ref&gt;

==Areas of discussion==
Natural resource economics is a [[transdisciplinary]] field of academic research within [[economics]] that aims to address the connections and interdependence between human economies and natural [[ecosystem]]s. Its focus is how to operate an [[economy]] within the ecological constraints of earth's [[natural resources]].&lt;ref name=EoETopicEcoEcon&gt;Encyclopedia of Earth. [http://www.eoearth.org/by/Topic/Ecological%20economics Article Topic: ecological economics]&lt;/ref&gt; Resource economics brings together and connects different disciplines within the natural and social sciences connected to broad areas of [[earth science]], human [[economics]], and natural ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wordnet.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=earth%20science Wordnet Search: Earth science]{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Economic models must be adapted to accommodate the special features of natural resource inputs. The traditional curriculum of natural resource economics emphasized fisheries models, forestry models, and minerals extraction models (i.e. fish, trees, and ore). In recent years, however, other resources, notably air, water, the global climate, and "environmental resources" in general have become increasingly important to policy-making.

Academic and policy interest has now moved beyond simply the optimal commercial exploitation of the standard trio of resources to encompass management for other objectives. For example, natural resources more broadly defined have recreational, as well as commercial values. They may also contribute to overall social welfare levels, by their mere existence.

The economics and policy area focuses on the human aspects of environmental problems. Traditional areas of environmental and natural resource economics include welfare theory, land/location use, pollution control, resource extraction, and non-market valuation, and also resource exhaustibility,&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Heal (2008). "exhaustible resources," ''[[The New Palgrave Dictionary of Economics]]'', 2nd Edition. [http://www.dictionaryofeconomics.com/article?id=pde2008_E000165&amp;q=Natural%20resources&amp;topicid=&amp;result_number=1 Abstract]&lt;/ref&gt; [[sustainability]], [[environmental management]], and [[environmental policy]]. Research topics could include the environmental impacts of agriculture, transportation and urbanization, land use in poor and industrialized countries, international trade and the environment, [[climate change]], and methodological advances in non-market valuation, to name just a few.

[[Hotelling's rule]] is a 1938 economic model of non-renewable [[resource management]] by [[Harold Hotelling]]. It shows that efficient exploitation of a nonrenewable and nonaugmentable resource would, under otherwise stable economic conditions, lead to a [[resource depletion|depletion]] of the resource. The rule states that this would lead to a net price or "[[Hotelling rent]]" for it that rose annually at a rate equal to the [[rate of interest]], reflecting the increasing scarcity of the resource.  Nonaugmentable resources of inorganic materials (i.e. minerals) are uncommon; most resources can be augmented by recycling and by the existence and use of substitutes for the end-use products (see below).

Vogely has stated that the development of a mineral resource occurs in five stages: (1) The current operating margin (rate of production) governed by the proportion of the reserve (resource) already depleted.  (2) The intensive development margin governed by the trade-off between the rising necessary investment and quicker realization of revenue.  (3) The extensive development margin in which extraction is begun of known but previously uneconomic deposits.  (4) The exploration margin in which the search for new deposits (resources) is conducted and the cost per unit extracted is highly uncertain with the cost of failure having to be balanced against finding usable resources (deposits) that have marginal costs of extraction no higher than in the first three stages above.  (5) The technology margin which interacts with the first four stages.  The Gray-Hotelling (exhaustion) theory is a special case, since it covers only Stages 1–3 and not the far more important Stages 4 and 5.&lt;ref&gt;Vogely, William A. "Nonfuel Minerals and the World Economy", Chapter 15 in "The Global Possible" by Repetto, Robert, World Resources Institute Book Yale University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Simon has stated that the supply of natural resources is infinite (i.e. perpetual) &lt;ref&gt;Simon, Julian. "Can the Supply of Natural Resources Really be Infinite?  Yes!", "The Ultimate Resource" 1981, Chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt;

These conflicting views will be substantially reconciled by considering resource-related topics in  depth in the next section, or at least minimized.

Furthermore, [[Hartwick's rule]] provides insight to the [[sustainability]] of welfare in an economy that uses [[non-renewable resource]]s.

==Perpetual resources vs. exhaustibility==

===Background and introduction===

The perpetual resource concept is a complex one because the concept of resource is complex and changes with the advent of new technology (usually more efficient recovery), new needs, and to a lesser degree with new economics (e.g. changes in prices of the material, changes in energy costs, etc.).  On the one hand, a material (and its resources) can enter a time of shortage and become a [[strategic material|strategic and critical material]] (an immediate exhaustibility crisis), but on the other hand a material can go out of use, its resource can proceed to being perpetual if it was not before, and then the resource can become a paleoresource when the material goes almost completely out of use (e.g. resources of arrowhead-grade flint).  Some of the complexities influencing resources of a material include the extent of recyclability, the availability of suitable substitutes for the material in its end-use products, plus some other less important factors.

The Federal Government suddenly became compellingly interested in resource issues on December 7, 1941, shortly after which Japan cut the U.S. off from [[tin]] and [[rubber]] and made some other materials very difficult to obtain, such as tungsten.  This was the worst case for resource availability, becoming a strategic and critical material.  After the war a government stockpile of strategic and critical materials was set up, having around 100 different materials which were purchased for cash or obtained by trading off U.S. agricultural commodities for them.  In the longer term, scarcity of tin later led to completely substituting [[aluminum]] foil for [[tin]] foil and polymer lined [[steel]] cans and [[aseptic processing|aseptic]] packaging substituting for [[tin can|tin electroplated]] steel cans.

Resources change over time with technology and economics; more efficient recovery leads to a drop in the ore grade needed.  The average grade of the [[copper]] ore processed has dropped from 4.0% copper in 1900 to 1.63% in 1920, 1.20% in 1940, 0.73% in 1960, 0.47% in 1980, and 0.44% in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;"Domestic Reserves vis-a-vis Resources","Congressional Handbook on U.S. Materials Import Dependency" House Committee on Banking, Finance &amp; Urban Affairs, September 1981, pp. 19-21&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cobalt]] had been in an iffy supply status ever since the [[Belgian Congo]] (world's only significant source of cobalt) was given a hasty independence in 1960 and the cobalt-producing province seceded as Katanga, followed by several wars and insurgencies, local government removals, railroads destroyed, and nationalizations.  This was topped off by an invasion of the province by Katangan rebels in 1978 that disrupted supply and transportation and caused the cobalt price to briefly triple.  While the cobalt supply was disrupted and the price shot up, nickel and other substitutes were pressed into service.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Bureau of Mines, 1978-79 Minerals Yearbook, "Cobalt" and "The Mineral Industry of Zaire" chapters, Vol. I pp. 249-258, Vol. III pp. 1061-1066&lt;/ref&gt;

Following this, the idea of a "Resource War" by the Soviets became popular.  Rather than the chaos that resulted from the Zairean cobalt situation, this would be planned, a strategy designed to destroy economic activity outside the Soviet bloc by the acquisition of vital resources by noneconomic means (military?) outside the Soviet bloc (Third World?), then withholding these minerals from the West.&lt;ref&gt;"THE RESOURCES WAR", "Congressional Handbook on U.S. Materials Import Dependency" House Committee on Banking, Finance, and Urban Affairs, September 1981, pp. 160-174&lt;/ref&gt;

An important way of getting around a [[cobalt]] situation or a "Resource War" situation is to use substitutes for a material in its end-uses.  Some criteria for a satisfactory substitute are (1) ready availability domestically in adequate quantities or availability from contiguous nations, or possibly from overseas allies, (2) possessing physical and chemical properties, performance, and longevity comparable to the material of first choice, (3) well-established and known behavior and properties particularly as a component in exotic alloys, and (4) an ability for processing and fabrication with minimal changes in existing technology, capital plant, and processing and fabricating facilities.  Some suggested substitutions were [[alunite]] for bauxite to make [[alumina]], [[molybdenum]] and/or [[nickel]] for cobalt, and aluminum alloy automobile radiators for copper alloy automobile radiators.&lt;ref&gt;"SUBSTITUTION", "Congressional Handbook on U.S. Material Import Dependency" House Committee on Banking, Finance, and Urban Affairs, September 1981, pp. 242-254&lt;/ref&gt;  Materials can be eliminated without material substitutes, for example by using discharges of high tension electricity to shape hard objects that were formerly shaped by mineral abrasives, giving superior performance at lower cost,&lt;ref name="Charles W 1964, pp. 55-59"&gt;Charles W. Merrill "Mineral Obsolescence and Substitution" "Mining Engineering", AIME, Society of Mining Engineers, September 1964, pp. 55-59&lt;/ref&gt; or by using computers/satellites to replace copper wire (land lines).

An important way of replacing a resource is by synthesis, for example, industrial [[diamonds]] and many kinds of [[graphite]], although a certain kind of graphite could be almost replaced by a recycled product. Most graphite is synthetic, for example, graphite electrodes, graphite fiber, graphite shapes (machined or unmachined), and graphite powder.

Another way of replacing or extending a resource is by recycling the material desired from scrap or waste.  This depends on whether or not the material is dissipated or is available as a no longer usable durable product.  Reclamation of the durable product depends on its resistance to chemical and physical breakdown, quantities available, price of availability, and the ease of extraction from the original product.&lt;ref&gt;Peter T. Flawn. "Mineral Resources (Geology, Engineering, Economics, Politics, Law)" Rand McNally, Chicago, 1966, pp. 374-378&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, [[bismuth]] in stomach medicine is hopelessly scattered (dissipated) and therefore impossible to recover, while bismuth alloys can be easily recovered and recycled.  A good example where recycling makes a big difference is the resource availability situation for [[graphite]], where flake graphite can be recovered from a renewable resource called kish, a steelmaking waste created when carbon separates out as graphite within the kish from the molten metal along with slag.  After it is cold, the kish can be processed.&lt;ref&gt;P. D. Laverty, L. J. Nicks, and L. A. Walters "Recovery of Flake Graphite from Steelmaking Kish" , U.S. Bureau of Mines RI9512, 1994, 23 p.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several other kinds of resources need to be introduced.  If strategic and critical materials are the worst case for resources, unless mitigated by substitution and/or recycling, one of the best is an abundant resource.  An abundant resource is one whose material has so far found little use, such as using high-aluminous clays or anorthosite to produce alumina, and magnesium before it was recovered from seawater.  An abundant resource is quite similar to a perpetual resource.&lt;ref&gt;Charles W. Merrill "Introduction" U.S. Bureau of Mines Bulletin 630, 1965, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; The reserve base is the part of an identified resource that has a reasonable potential for becoming economically available at a time beyond when currently proven technology and current economics are in operation.  Identified resources are those whose location, grade, quality, and quantity are known or estimated from specific geologic evidence.  Reserves are that part of the reserve base that can be economically extracted at the time of determination;&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Geological Survey "Mineral Commodity Summary", Appendix C, 2008, p. C1-C3&lt;/ref&gt; reserves should not be used as a surrogate for resources because they are often distorted by taxation or the owning firm's public relations needs.

===Comprehensive natural resource models===

Harrison Brown and associates stated that humanity will process lower and lower grade "ore".  Iron will come from low-grade iron-bearing material such as raw rock from anywhere in an [[iron]] formation, not much different from the input used to make [[taconite]] pellets in North America and elsewhere today.  As coking coal reserves decline, pig iron and [[steel]] production will use non-coke-using processes (i.e. electric steel).  The [[aluminum]] industry could shift from using [[bauxite]] to using anorthosite and [[clay]].  [[Magnesium]] metal and magnesia consumption (i.e. in refractories), currently obtained from seawater, will increase.  Sulfur will be obtained from [[pyrites]], then [[gypsum]] or anhydrite.  Metals such as [[copper]], [[zinc]], [[nickel]], and [[lead]] will be obtained from [[manganese nodules]] or the Phosphoria formation (sic!).  These changes could occur irregularly in different parts of the world.  While Europe and North America might use anorthosite or clay as raw material for aluminum, other parts of the world might use bauxite, and while North America might use taconite, Brazil might use iron ore.  New materials will appear (note: they have), the result of technological advances, some acting as substitutes and some with new properties.  Recycling will become more common and more efficient (note: it has!).  Ultimately, minerals and metals will be obtained by processing "average" rock.  Rock, 100 tonnes of "average" igneous rock, will yield eight tonnes of aluminum, five tonnes of iron, and 0.6 tonnes of titanium.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison Brown. "The Challenge of Man's Future" The Viking Press, New York, 1954, pp. 187-219&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harrison Brown, James Bonner, and John Weir. "The Next Hundred Years" The Viking Press, 1955, pp. 17-26, 33-42, 89-94, and 147-154&lt;/ref&gt;

The USGS model based on crustal abundance data and the reserve-abundance relationship of McKelvey, is applied to several metals in the Earth's crust (worldwide) and in the U.S. crust.  The potential currently recoverable (present technology, economy) resources that come closest to the McKelvey relationship are those that have been sought for the longest time, such as copper, zinc, lead, [[silver]], [[gold]] and [[molybdenum]].  Metals that do not follow the McKelvey relationship are ones that are byproducts (of major metals) or haven't been vital to the economy until recently ([[titanium]], aluminum to a lesser degree).  Bismuth is an example of a byproduct metal that doesn't follow the relationship very well; the 3% lead reserves in the western U.S. would have only 100 ppm bismuth, clearly too low-grade for a bismuth reserve.  The world recoverable resource potential is 2,120 million tonnes for copper, 2,590 million tonnes for nickel, 3,400 million tonnes for zinc, 3,519 BILLION tonnes for aluminum, and 2,035 BILLION tonnes for iron.&lt;ref&gt;R. L. Erickson "Crustal Abundance of Elements, and Mineral Reserves and Resources", "United States Mineral Resources" U.S. Geological Survey Professional Paper 820, 1973, pp. 21-25&lt;/ref&gt;

Diverse authors have further contributions.  Some think the number of substitutes is almost infinite, particularly with the flow of new materials from the chemical industry; identical end products can be made from different materials and starting points.  Plastics can be good electrical conductors.  Since all materials are 100 times weaker than they theoretically should be, it ought to be possible to eliminate areas of dislocations and greatly strengthen them, enabling lesser quantities to be used.  To summarize, "mining" companies will have more and more diverse products, the world economy is moving away from materials towards services, and the population seems to be levelling, all of which implies a lessening of demand growth for materials; much of the materials will be recovered from somewhat uncommon rocks, there will be much more coproducts and byproducts from a given operation, and more trade in minerals and materials.&lt;ref&gt;Harold A. Taylor. "The Future of the Mineral Industry" University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Dept. of Mining Engineering, 1968, 15 p.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trend towards perpetual resources===

As radical new technology impacts the materials and minerals world more and more powerfully, the materials used are more and more likely to have perpetual resources.  There are already more and more materials that have perpetual resources and less and less materials that have nonrenewable resources or are strategic and critical materials.  Some materials that have perpetual resources such as [[salt]],stone, [[magnesium]], and common clay were mentioned previously.  Thanks to new technology, synthetic [[diamonds]] were added to the list of perpetual resources, since they can be easily made from a lump of another form of carbon. Synthetic graphite, is made in large quantities (graphite electrodes, graphite fiber) from carbon precursors such as petroleum coke or a textile fiber.  A firm named Liquidmetal Technologies, Inc. is utilizing the removal of dislocations in a material with a technique that overcomes performance limitations caused by inherent weaknesses in the crystal atomic structure.  It makes [[amorphous metal]] [[alloys]], which retain a random atomic structure when the hot metal solidifies, rather than the crystalline atomic structure (with dislocations) that normally forms when hot metal solidifies.  These amorphous alloys have much better performance properties than usual; for example, their zirconium-titanium [[Liquidmetal]] alloys are 250% stronger than a standard titanium alloy.  The Liquidmetal alloys can supplant many high performance alloys.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Securities and Exchange Comm. Form 10-K "Liquidmetal Technologies, Inc." December 2008, p.3&lt;/ref&gt;

Exploration of the ocean bottom in the last fifty years revealed manganese nodules and [[phosphate nodule]]s in many locations.  More recently, polymetallic sulfide deposits have been discovered and polymetallic sulfide "black muds" are being presently deposited from "black smokers" &lt;ref&gt;F. M. Herzig and M. Hannington "Polymetallic Sulfides at the Modern Seafloor-A Review" Ore Geology Reviews, Vol. 10 (Elsevier) 1995, pp. 95-115&lt;/ref&gt; The cobalt scarcity situation of 1978 has a new option now: recover it from manganese nodules.  A Korean firm plans to start developing a [[manganese nodule]] recovery operation in 2010; the manganese nodules recovered would average 27% to 30% [[manganese]], 1.25% to 1.5% nickel, 1% to 1.4% copper, and 0.2% to 0.25% cobalt (commercial grade) &lt;ref&gt;[|http://minerals.usgs.gov/pubs/commodity/manganese/mangamyb04.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;  Nautilus Minerals Ltd. is planning to recover commercial grade material averaging 29.9% zinc, 2.3% lead, and 0.5% copper from massive ocean-bottom polymetallic sulfide deposits using an underwater vacuum cleaner-like device that combines some current technologies in a new way.  Partnering with Nautilus are Tech Cominco Ltd. and Anglo-American Ltd., world-leading international firms.&lt;ref&gt;Platts Metals Week "Underseas Mining Finds Richer Grades at Lower Cost: Nautilus", "Platts Metals Week", September 22, 2008, p. 14-15&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also other robot mining techniques that could be applied under the ocean.  Rio Tinto is using satellite links to allow workers 1500 kilometers away to operate drilling rigs, load cargo, dig out ore and dump it on conveyor belts, and place explosives to subsequently blast rock and earth.  The firm can keep workers out of danger this way, and also use fewer workers.  Such technology reduces costs and offsets declines in metal content of ore reserves.&lt;ref&gt;Wall Street Journal "Miner Digs for Ore in the Outback With Remote-Controlled Robots", March 2, 2010, pp. D1&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus a variety of minerals and metals are obtainable from unconventional sources with resources available in huge quantities.

Finally, what is a perpetual resource?  The ASTM definition for a perpetual resource is "one that is virtually inexhaustible on a human time-scale".  Examples given include solar energy, tidal energy, and wind energy,&lt;ref&gt;ASTM E60 "E2114-08 Standard Terminology for Sustainability", ASTM, 2008, pp. 615-618 {{ISBN|978-0-8031-5768-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; to which should be added salt, stone, magnesium, diamonds, and other materials mentioned above.  A study on the biogeophysical aspects of sustainability came up with a rule of prudent practice that a resource stock should last 700 years to achieve sustainability or become a perpetual resource, or for a worse case, 350 years.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dieoff.org/page 113.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

If a resource lasting 700 or more years is perpetual, one that lasts 350 to 700 years can be called an abundant resource, and is so defined here.  How long the material can be recovered from its resource depends on human need and changes in technology from extraction through the life cycle of the product to final disposal, plus recyclability of the material and availability of satisfactory substitutes.  Specifically, this shows that exhaustibility does not occur until these factors weaken and play out: the availability of substitutes, the extent of recycling and its feasibility, more efficient manufacturing of the final consumer product, more durable and longer-lasting consumer products, and even a number of other factors.

The most recent resource information and guidance on the kinds of resources that must be considered is covered on the Resource Guide-Update [http://resourceguide-update.blogspot.com]

===Transitioning: perpetual resources to paleoresources===

Perpetual resources can transition to being a paleoresource. A paleoresource is one that has little or no demand for the material extracted from it; an obsolescent material, humans no longer need it. The classic paleoresource is an arrowhead-grade [[flint]] resource; no one makes flint arrowheads or spearheads anymore—making a sharpened piece of scrap steel and using it is much simpler. Obsolescent products include tin cans, tin foil, the schoolhouse [[slate]] blackboard, and [[radium]] in medical technology. Radium has been replaced by much cheaper [[cobalt-60]] and other radioisotopes in radiation treatment. Noncorroding lead as a cable covering has been replaced by plastics.

Pennsylvania [[anthracite]] is another material where the trend towards obsolescence and becoming a paleoresource can be shown statistically.  Production of anthracite was 70.4 million tonnes in 1905, 49.8 million tonnes in 1945, 13.5 million tonnes in 1965, 4.3 million tonnes in 1985, and 1.5 million tonnes in 2005.  The amount used per person was 84&amp;nbsp;kg per person in 1905, 7.1&amp;nbsp;kg in 1965, and 0.8&amp;nbsp;kg in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Bureau of Mines, 1956 Minerals Yearbook, "Coal-Pennsylvania Anthracite" pp. 120-165, and 1971 Minerals Yearbook, "Coal-Pennsylvania Anthracite" pp. 378-404&lt;/ref&gt; [http://www.eia.doe.gov/emeu/aer/coal.html]  Compare this to the USGS anthracite reserves of 18.6 billion tonnes and total resources of 79 billion tonnes;&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Averitt]] "Coal", "United States Mineral Resources" U.S. Geological Survey Professional Paper 820, 1973, p.137&lt;/ref&gt; the anthracite demand has dropped so much that these resources are more than perpetual.

Since anthracite resources are so far into the perpetual resource range and demand for [[anthracite]] has dropped so far, is it possible to see how anthracite might become a paleoresource?  Probably by customers continuing to disappear (i.e. convert to other kinds of energy for space heating), the supply network atrophy as anthracite [[coal]] dealers can't retain enough business to cover costs and close, and mines with too small a volume to cover costs also close.  This is a mutually reinforcing process: customers convert to other forms of cleaner energy that produce less pollution and carbon dioxide, then the coal dealer has to close because of lack of enough sales volume to cover costs.  The coal dealer's other customers are then forced to convert unless they can find another nearby coal dealer.  Finally the anthracite mine closes because it doesn't have enough sales volume to cover its costs.

A '''network protector''' is a type of electric [[Power system protection|protective device]] used in [[electricity distribution]] systems. The network protector automatically disconnect its associated [[distribution transformer]] from the [[secondary network]] when the power starts flowing in reverse direction. Network protectors are used on both [[spot network substation|spot networks]] and [[Low-voltage network#Grid network|grid networks]]. The secondary grid system improves continuity of service for customers, since multiple sources are available to supply the load; a fault with any one supply is automatically isolated by the network protector and does not interrupt service from the other sources.  Secondary grids are often used in downtown areas of cities where there are many customers in a small area.

==Operation==
Typically the network protector is set to close when the voltage difference and phase angle are such that the transformer will supply power to the secondary grid, and is set to open when the secondary grid would back-feed through the transformer and supply power to the primary circuit.

Network protectors typically have three settings, "automatic", "open", and "close". The top side is fed from multiple protectors and is always energized unless all units on a spot network are in the open position. Grid units will always be energized on the top side from the many other units tied into the grid.
A spot network is 2 or more transformers dedicated to a single customer. The grid feeds multiple customers.
A network protector has a [[circuit  breaker]] set of contacts and a controlling protection relay. The components are enclosed in a protective housing; some network protectors are installed on transformers below grade and must be in water-resistant enclosures. The mechanism contains electrical and mechanical parts to switch open and close the secondary contacts. The controlling relay monitors voltage and current in the transformer, and opens or closes the contact mechanism through electrical signals. The relay uses a power/time curve so that small, short term reverse power flow (such as from elevator hoists) are ignored. Spot units will be 277/480 and the grid units will be 125/216.

==Application==
The network protector does not protect the (secondary) network cable from overload. The network protector is installed to protect the stability and reliability of the secondary grid by preventing power flow away from the customers and into the primary feeders. 

If there is a [[Fault (power engineering)|fault]] on the primary feeder, the substation circuit-breaker is meant to open, disconnecting the primary feeder from one side. The problem is that this primary cable is also connected to a network transformer, which is interconnected to other network transformers on its secondary side.  The secondary network will energize the primary feeder through the network transformer. This can be very dangerous, because a fault will continue to be 'fed' from the secondary network side of transformer. Even without a fault, if the electric utility wants to perform maintenance on that primary cable, they must have a way to fully disconnect that primary cable, without worrying about the cable being energized by the secondary network through the network transformer. Thus, the network protector is designed to open its contacts if the relay senses backwards flowing current. 

However, if there is a fault on the secondary grid, the network protector is not designed to open its contacts up. The secondary fault will continue to be fed from the primary side of the system. In some cases, networks are designed with [[cable limiter]]s (like fuses) to melt and disconnect the secondary fault under the right conditions. In other cases, the utility lets cable 'burn clear', in which case the fault is allowed to remain fed until the cables fuse, then the fault is isolated. 

Analysis of the system is required to ensure that the system can, indeed, supply enough current to fuse the cables, wherever the fault is. This method tends to work well at 120 volts, but it is less reliable at higher voltages. The danger in depending on the cable to 'burn clear' is that some conditions will not cause the cable to burn in this manner and instead, the entire section of cable can be damaged from excessive, long-term overloading, causing fires and damage to the secondary network. 

Typically, network protectors are contained inside a submersible enclosure which is bolted to the throat of the network transformer and placed in underground vaults. [[IEEE]] standard C57.12.44 covers network protectors.

The main interest in NMR crystallography is in microcrystalline materials which are amenable to this method but not to [[X-ray diffraction|X-ray]], [[neutron diffraction|neutron]] and [[electron diffraction]]. This is largely because interactions of comparably short range are measured in NMR crystallography.

==Introduction==
When applied to [[organic compound|organic molecules]], NMR crystallography aims at including structural information not only of a single molecule but also on the molecular packing (i.e. crystal structure).&lt;ref name=taulelle&gt;{{cite journal

[[Polymorphism (materials science)|polymorphism]] is an area of interest for NMR crystallography since this is encountered occasionally (and may often be previously undiscovered) in organic compounds. In this case a change in the molecular structure and/or in the molecular packing can lead to polymorphism, and this can be investigated by NMR crystallography.&lt;ref name=harris2006&gt;{{cite journal

==Dipolar couplings-based approach==
The spin interaction that is usually employed for structural analyses via solid state NMR spectroscopy is the [[Magnetic dipole–dipole interaction|magnetic dipolar interaction]].&lt;ref name=schmidtrohr&gt;{{cite book|author=Schmidt-Rohr K.|author2=Spiess H.W.|date=1994|title=Multidimensional Solid-State NMR and Polymers |publisher=[[Academic Press]]|isbn=0-12-626630-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Additional knowledge about other interactions within the studied system like the [[chemical shift]] or the [[Quadrupole|electric quadrupole]] interaction can be helpful as well, and in some cases solely the chemical shift has been employed as e.g. for [[zeolite]]s.&lt;ref name=brouwer&gt;{{cite journal
 |author = Brouwer DH
 |date = 2008
 |doi =10.1021/ja800227f
 |title = NMR Crystallography of Zeolites: Refinement of an NMR-Solved Crystal Structure Using ab Initio Calculations of 29Si Chemical Shift Tensors
 |journal = J. Am. Chem. Soc.
 |volume = 130 |issue =  |pages=6306–6307
 |pmid = 18433131
 |url=
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The “dipole coupling”-based approach parallels [[Protein NMR|protein NMR spectroscopy]] to some extent in that e.g. multiple [[residual dipolar coupling]]s are measured for proteins in solution, and these couplings are used as constraints in the protein structure calculation.

In NMR crystallography the observed spins in case of organic molecules would often be spin-1/2 nuclei of moderate frequency ({{SimpleNuclide|link|Carbon|13}}, {{SimpleNuclide|link|Nitrogen|15}}, {{SimpleNuclide|link|Phosphorus|31}}, etc.). I.e. {{SimpleNuclide|link|Hydrogen|1}} is excluded due to its large magnetogyric ratio and high spin concentration leading to a network of strong homonuclear dipolar couplings. There are two solutions with respect to &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H: {{SimpleNuclide|link|Hydrogen|1}} [[spin diffusion]] experiments (see below) and specific labelling with {{SimpleNuclide|link|Hydrogen|2}} spins ([[spin quantum number|spin]] = 1). The latter is also popular e.g. in NMR spectroscopic investigations of [[hydrogen bond]]s in solution and the solid state.&lt;ref name=kohen&gt;{{cite book|author=Kohen A.|author2=Limbach H.-H.|date=2005|title=Isotope Effects In Chemistry and Biology |publisher=[[CRC Press]]|location=Boca Raton, FL|isbn=0-8247-2449-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Both intra- and intermolecular structural elements can be investigated e.g. via deuterium REDOR (an established solid state NMR pulse sequence to measure dipolar couplings between deuterons and other spins).&lt;ref name=sack&gt;{{cite journal
 |author = Sack I
 |author2 = Goldbourt A
 |author3 = Vega S
 |author4 = Buntkowsky G
 |date = 1999
 |doi = 10.1006/jmre.1999.1710

 |pmid = 10329226
 |url=
|bibcode = 1999JMagR.138...54S }}&lt;/ref&gt;
This can provide an additional constraint for an NMR crystallographic structural investigation in that it can be used to find and characterize e.g. intermolecular hydrogen bonds.

===Dipolar interaction===
The above-mentioned dipolar interaction can be measured directly, e.g. between pairs of heteronuclear spins like &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C/&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N in many organic compounds.&lt;ref name=macholl2004 /&gt; Furthermore, the strength of the dipolar interaction modulates parameters like the longitudinal [[Relaxation (NMR)|relaxation]] time or the spin diffusion rate which therefore can be examined to obtain structural information. E.g. &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H spin diffusion has been measured providing rich structural information.&lt;ref name=elena&gt;{{cite journal|last= Elena |first= Bénédicte |last2 = Pintacuda |first2= Guido |last3 = Mifsud |first3= Nicolas |last4 = Emsley |first4=Lyndon |author-link4= Lyndon Emsley |date = 2006

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chemical shift interaction===
The chemical shift interaction can be used in conjunction with the dipolar interaction to determine the orientation of the dipolar interaction frame (principal axes system) with respect to the molecular frame (dipolar chemical shift spectroscopy). For some cases there are rules for the chemical shift interaction tensor orientation as for the &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C spin in ketones due to symmetry arguments (sp&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; [[Orbital hybridisation|hybridisation]]). If the orientation of a dipolar interaction (between the spin of interest and e.g. another heteronucleus) is measured with respect to the chemical shift interaction coordinate system, these two pieces of information (chemical shift tensor/molecular orientation and the dipole tensor/chemical shift tensor orientation) combined give the orientation of the dipole tensor in the molecular frame.&lt;ref name=mehring&gt;{{cite book|author=Mehring M.|date=1983|title=High Resolution NMR Spectroscopy in Solids |publisher=Springer|location=Berlin, Heidelberg, New York|isbn=0-387-07704-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this method is only suitable for small molecules (or polymers with a small repetition unit like polyglycine) and it provides only selective (and usually intramolecular) structural information.

==Crystal Structure Refinements==
The dipolar interaction yields the most direct information with respect to structure as it makes it possible to measure the distances between the spins.  The sensitivity of this interaction is however lacking and even though dipolar-based NMR crystallography makes the elucidation of structures possible, other methods are necessary to obtain high resolution structures.  For these reasons much work was done to include the use other NMR observables such as chemical shift anisotropy, J-coupling and the quadrupolar interaction.  These anisotropic interactions are highly sensitive to the 3D local environment making it possible to refine the structures of powdered samples to structures rivaling the quality of single crystal X-ray diffraction.  These however rely on adequate methods for predicting these interactions as they do not depend in a straightforward fashion on the structure.&lt;ref name=BrouwerEnright&gt;{{cite journal

==Comparison with diffraction methods==
A drawback of NMR crystallography is that the method is typically more time consuming and more expensive (due to spectrometer costs and isotope labelling) than X-ray crystallography, it often elucidates only part of the structure, and isotope labelling and experiments may have to be tailored to obtain key structural information. Also not always is a molecular structure suitable for a pure NMR-based NMR crystallographic approach, but it can still play an important role in a multimodality (NMR+diffraction) study.&lt;ref name=macholl2007&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike in the case of diffraction methods, it appears that NMR crystallography needs to work on a case by case basis.  This is the case since difference systems will have different spin physics and different observables which can be probed.  The method may therefore not find widespread use as different systems will require qualified individuals to design experiments to study them.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8178">'''Photoelectrochemistry''' is a subfield of study within [[physical chemistry]] concerned with the interaction of light with [[electrochemistry|electrochemical systems]].&lt;ref&gt;IUPAC Compendium of Chemical Terminology&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Electrochemistry Encyclopedia&lt;/ref&gt; It is an active domain of investigation. One of the pioneers of this field of electrochemistry was the German electrochemist [[Heinz Gerischer]]. The interest in this domain is high in the context of development of renewable energy conversion and storage technology.

==Historical approach==
Photoelectrochemistry has been intensively studied in the 70-80s because of the first peak oil crisis. Because fossil fuels are non-renewable, it is necessary to develop processes to obtain renewable resources and use clean energy. Artificial photosynthesis, photoelectrochemical water splitting and regenerative solar cells are of special interest in this context. Discovered by Alexander Edmund Becquerel.

H. Gerischer, H. Tributsch, AJ. Nozik, AJ. Bard, A. Fujishima, K. Honda, PE. Laibinis, K. Rajeshwar, TJ Meyer, PV. Kamat, N.S. Lewis, R. Memming, JOM. Bockris are researchers which have contributed a lot to the field of photoelectrochemistry.

==Semiconductor electrochemistry==

===Introduction===
[[Semiconductor]] materials have energy [[band gap]]s, and will generate a pair of electron and hole for each absorbed [[photon]] if the energy of the photon is higher than the band gap energy of the semiconductor. This property of semiconductor materials has been successfully used to convert solar energy into [[electrical energy]] by [[Solar cell|photovoltaic devices]].

In photocatalysis the electron-hole pair is immediately used to drive a redox reaction. However, the electron-hole pairs suffer from fast recombination. In photoelectrocatalysis, a differential potential is applied to diminish the number of recombinations between the electrons and the holes. This allows an increase in the yield of light's conversion into chemical energy.

===Semiconductor-electrolyte interface===

When a semiconductor comes into contact with a liquid ([[redox]] species), to maintain electrostatic equilibrium, there will be a charge transfer between the semiconductor and liquid phase if [[Redox potential|formal redox potential]] of redox species lies inside semiconductor band gap. At thermodynamic equilibrium, the [[Fermi level]] of semiconductor and the formal redox potential of redox species are aligned at the interface between semiconductor and redox species. This introduces a downward [[band bending]] in a [[n-type semiconductor]] for n-type semiconductor/liquid junction (Figure 1(a)) and an upward band bending in a [[p-type semiconductor]] for a p-type semiconductor/liquid junction (Figure 1(b)). This characteristic of semiconductor/liquid junctions is similar to a rectifying semiconductor/metal junction or [[Metal–semiconductor junction|Schottky junction]]. Ideally to get a good [[p–n junction|rectifying characteristics]] at the semiconductor/liquid interface, the formal redox potential must be close to the valence band of the semiconductor for a [[n-type semiconductor]] and close to the conduction band of the semiconductor for a p-type semiconductor. The semiconductor/liquid junction has one advantage over the rectifying semiconductor/metal junction in that the light is able to travel through to the semiconductor surface without much reflection; whereas most of the light is reflected back from the metal surface at a semiconductor/metal junction. Therefore, semiconductor/liquid junctions can also be used as [[Solar cell|photovoltaic devices]] similar to solid state [[p–n junction]] devices. Both n-type and p-type semiconductor/liquid junctions can be used as photovoltaic devices to convert solar energy into electrical energy and are called [[photoelectrochemical cells]]. In addition, a semiconductor/liquid junction could also be used to directly convert solar energy into [[chemical energy]] by virtue of [[photoelectrolysis]] at the semiconductor/liquid junction.

File:p-type semiconductor and liquid junction.png|Figure 1(b) band diagram of p-type semiconductor/liquid junction
&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Experimental setup===
Semiconductors are usually studied in a [[photoelectrochemical cell]]. Different configurations exist with a three electrode device. The phenomenon to study happens at the working electrode WE while the differential potential is applied between the WE and a reference electrode RE (saturated calomel, Ag/AgCl). The current is measured between the WE and the counter electrode CE (carbon vitreous, platinum gauze). The working electrode is the semiconductor material and the electrolyte is composed of a solvent, an electrolyte and a redox specie.

A UV-vis lamp is usually used to illuminate the working electrode. The photoelectrochemical cell is usually made with a quartz window because it does not absorb the light. A monochromator can be used to control the wavelength sent to the WE.

==Applications==

===Photoelectrochemical splitting of water===

Photoelectrochemistry has been intensively studied in the field of [[hydrogen production]] from water and solar energy. The photoelectrochemical splitting of water was historically discovered by Fujishima and Honda in 1972 onto TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; electrodes. Recently many materials have shown promising properties to split efficiently water but TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; remains cheap, abundant, stable against photo-corrosion. The main problem of TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is its bandgap which is 3 or 3.2 eV according to its crystallinity (anatase or rutile). These values are too high and only the wavelength in the UV region can be absorbed. To increase the performances of this material to split water with solar wavelength, it is necessary to sensitize the TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Currently Quantum Dots sensitization is very promising but more research is needed to find new materials able to absorb the light efficiently.

===Artificial photosynthesis===

[[Photosynthesis]] is the natural process that converts CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; using light to produce hydrocarbon compounds such as sugar. The depletion of fossil fuels encourages scientists to find alternatives to produce hydrocarbon compounds. [[Artificial photosynthesis]] is a promising method  mimicking the natural photosynthesis to produce such compounds. The [[photoelectrochemical reduction of CO2]] is much studied because of its worldwide impact. Many researchers aim to find new semiconductors to develop stable and efficient photo-anodes and photo-cathodes.

===Regenerative cells or Dye-sensitized solar cell (Graetzel cell)===

[[Dye-sensitized solar cells]] or DSSCs use TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and dyes to absorb the light. This absorption induces the formation of electron-hole pairs which are used to oxidize and reduce the same redox couple, usually I&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;/I&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;. Consequently, a differential potential is created which induces a current.

'''''Planet in Peril''''' is a two-part, four-hour documentary on [[CNN]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|page=128|date=November 2008|issn=1548-212X|title=Best life}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=32|isbn=978-0-595-63425-5|title=You Can Avoid Physical Death: Physical Body Ascension to the New Earth}}&lt;/ref&gt; that premiered on October 23, 2007, broadcast in the [[CNN Presents]] format.  It also aired as a special presentation on December 2 and 3, 2007 on [[Animal Planet]] &amp; Animal Planet HD. CNN's [[Anderson Cooper]], [[Sanjay Gupta]] and Animal Planet's [[Jeff Corwin]] investigate the current state of our planet, focusing on four major areas: [[global warming]], [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]], [[deforestation]] and [[species loss]].

They report from a wide variety of locations including Alaska, Brazil, Madagascar, Southeast Asia, and [[Yellowstone National Park]], examining the effects of [[population growth]], rising temperatures, [[poaching]] and illegal [[wildlife trade]], among others, on the global environment.

Specific areas it deals with are the [[conflict in the Niger Delta]] (oil exploitation) and [[La Oroya]], Peru ([[industrial pollution]]).

On December 11, 2008, CNN premiered a sequel to ''Planet in Peril'', called ''[[Planet in Peril: Battle Lines]]''. It featured Anderson Cooper, Sanjay Gupta, and Lisa Ling from National Geographic Explorer.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1866">A '''Removal Unit''' (RMU) is a tradable [[carbon credit]] or 'Kyoto unit' representing an allowance to emit one metric tonne of greenhouse gases absorbed by a removal or [[Carbon sink]] activity in an [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change#Annex I countries|Annex I country]]. 

Removal Units are generated and issued by [[Kyoto Protocol]] Annex I Parties for carbon absorption by [[land use, land-use change, and forestry]] (LULUCF)  activities such as reforestation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://unfccc.int/essential_background/glossary/items/3666.php#R  |title=Glossary of climate change acronyms |publisher=United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change |accessdate=2010-04-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application==
Under Article 3.3 of the [[Kyoto Protocol]], Annex I Parties can recognise the [[biosequestration]], the removal of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere by [[Carbon sink]]s, created by direct human-induced afforestation, reforestation and deforestation since 1990, in determining whether they have met their emission reduction commitments under the Protocol. When sinks have resulted in the net removal of greenhouse gases from the atmosphere, Annex I Parties can issue removal units (RMUs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://unfccc.int/methods_and_science/lulucf/items/4129.php |title=LULUCF under the Kyoto Protocol |publisher=United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change |accessdate=2010-07-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is a white solid [[ionic compound]] consisting of [[sodium]] [[cation]]s {{chem|Na|+}} and [[hydroxide]] [[anion]]s {{chem|OH|−}}.

Sodium hydroxide is a highly [[corrosive|caustic]] [[base (chemistry)|base]] and [[alkali]] that decomposes [[protein]]s at ordinary ambient [[temperature]]s and may cause severe [[chemical burn]]s. It is highly soluble in [[water]], and readily absorbs [[moisture]] and [[carbon dioxide]] from the [[air]]. It forms a series of [[hydrate]]s NaOH·''n''{{chem|H|2|O}}.&lt;ref name=siem/&gt; The monohydrate NaOH·{{chem|H|2|O}} crystallizes from water solutions between 12.3 and 61.8&amp;nbsp;°C. The commercially available "sodium hydroxide" is often this monohydrate, and published data may refer to it instead of the [[anhydrous]] compound. As one of the simplest hydroxides, it is frequently utilized alongside neutral [[water]] and acidic [[hydrochloric acid]] to demonstrate the pH scale to chemistry students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.orf.od.nih.gov/EnvironmentalProtection/WasteDisposal/Pages/Examples+of+Common+Laboratory+ChemicalsandtheirHazardClass.aspx | title=Examples of Common Laboratory Chemicals and their Hazard Class}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sodium hydroxide is used in many industries: in the manufacture of [[wood pulp|pulp]] and [[paper]], [[textile]]s, [[drinking water]], [[soap]]s and [[detergent]]s, and as a [[drain cleaner]]. Worldwide production in 2004 was approximately 60&amp;nbsp;million [[tonne]]s, while demand was 51&amp;nbsp;million tonnes.&lt;ref name = Ullmann/&gt;

==Properties==

===Physical properties===
Pure sodium hydroxide is a colorless crystalline solid that melts at {{convert|318|C|F}} without decomposition, and with a boiling point of {{convert|1388|C|F}}. It is highly soluble in water, with a lower solubility in polar solvents such as [[ethanol]] and [[methanol]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.protank.com/sodium-hydroxide|title=Sodium Hydroxide Storage Tanks &amp; Specifications|date=2018-09-08|work=Protank|access-date=2018-11-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; NaOH is insoluble in ether and other non-polar solvents.

Similar to the hydration of sulfuric acid, [[dissolution (chemistry)|dissolution]] of solid sodium hydroxide in water is a highly [[exothermic reaction]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discoveryexpresskids.com/blog/exothermic-vs-endothermic-chemistrys-give-and-take|title=Exothermic vs. Endothermic: Chemistry's Give and Take|website=Discovery Express}}&lt;/ref&gt; where a large amount of heat is liberated, posing a threat to safety through the possibility of splashing. The resulting solution is usually colorless and odorless. As with other alkaline solutions, it feels slippery with skin contact due to the process of [[saponification]] that occurs between NaOH and natural skin oils.

==== Viscosity ====
Sodium hydroxide, NaOH, as a fluid solution, demonstrates a characteristic [[viscosity]], 78 m[[Pascal (unit)|Pa]]·s that is much greater than water (1.0 mPa·s) and near that of olive oil (85 mPa·s) at room temperature. The viscosity of NaOH, as with any chemical, is inversely related to its service temperature; meaning viscosity decreases as temperature increases, with the opposite being true also. The viscosity of sodium hydroxide plays a direct role in its application as well as its storage.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

====Hydrates====
Sodium hydroxide can form several hydrates NaOH·''n''{{chem|H|2|O}}, which result in a complex [[solubility diagram]] that was described in detail by [[Spencer Umfreville Pickering|S. U. Pickering]] in 1893.&lt;ref name=pick&gt;Spencer Umfreville Pickering (1893): "LXI.—The hydrates of sodium, potassium, and lithium hydroxides". ''Journal of the Chemical Society, Transactions'', volume 63, pages 890-909. {{doi|10.1039/CT8936300890}}&lt;/ref&gt; The known hydrates and the approximate ranges of temperature and concentration (mass percent of NaOH) of their [[Saturation (chemistry)|saturated]] water solutions are:&lt;ref name=siem/&gt;

''Journal of Physical Chemistry'', volume 73, issue 1, pages 149–157. {{doi|10.1021/j100721a024}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Monohydrate, NaOH·{{chem|H|2|O}}: from +12.3&amp;nbsp;°C (51%) to 65.10&amp;nbsp;°C (69%) then to 62.63&amp;nbsp;°C (73.1%).&lt;ref name=pick/&gt;&lt;ref name=murch&gt;L. E. Murch, W. F. Giauque (1962): "The thermodynamic properties of sodium hydroxide and its monohydrate. Heat capacities to low temperatures. Heats of solution". ''Journal of Physical Chemistry'', volume 66, issue 10, pages 2052–2059. {{doi|10.1021/j100816a052}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early reports refer to hydrates with ''n'' = 0.5 or ''n'' = 2/3, but later careful investigations failed to confirm their existence.&lt;ref name=murch/&gt;

The only hydrates with stable melting points are NaOH·{{chem|H|2|O}} (65.10&amp;nbsp;°C) and NaOH·3.5{{chem|H|2|O}} (15.38&amp;nbsp;°C). The other hydrates, except the metastable ones NaOH·3{{chem|H|2|O}} and NaOH·4{{chem|H|2|O}} (β) can be crystallized from solutions of the proper composition, as listed above. However, solutions of NaOH can be easily supercooled by many degrees, which allows the formation of hydrates (including the metastable ones) from solutions with different concentrations.&lt;ref name=siem/&gt;&lt;ref name=murch/&gt;

For example, when a solution of NaOH and water with 1:2 mole ratio (52.6% NaOH by mass) is cooled, the monohydrate normally starts to crystallize (at about 22&amp;nbsp;°C) before the dihydrate. However, the solution can easily be supercooled down to -15&amp;nbsp;°C, at which point it may quickly crystallize as the dihydrate. When heated, the solid dihydrate might melt directly into a solution at 13.35&amp;nbsp;°C; however, once the temperature exceeds 12.58&amp;nbsp;°C. it often decomposes into solid monohydrate and a liquid solution. Even the ''n'' = 3.5 hydrate is difficult to crystallize, because the solution supercools so much that other hydrates become more stable.&lt;ref name=siem/&gt;

A hot water solution containing 73.1% (mass) of NaOH is an [[eutectic]] that solidifies at about 62.63&amp;nbsp;°C as an intimate mix of anhydrous and monohydrate crystals.&lt;ref name=brodale&gt;G. E. Brodale and W. F. Giauque(1962): "The freezing point-solubility curve of aqueous sodium hydroxide in the region near the anhydrous-monohydrate eutectic". ''Journal of Physical Chemistry'', volume 66, issue 10, pages 2051–2051. {{doi|10.1021/j100816a051}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=murch/&gt;

A second stable eutectic composition is 45.4% (mass) of NaOH, that solidifies at about 4.9&amp;nbsp;°C into a mixture of crystals of the dihydrate and of the 3.5-hydrate.&lt;ref name=siem/&gt;

The third stable eutectic has 18.4% (mass) of NaOH. It solidifies at about −28.7&amp;nbsp;°C as a mixture of water ice and the heptahydrate NaOH·7{{chem|H|2|O}}.&lt;ref name=pick/&gt;&lt;ref name=conde&gt;M. Conde Engineering: "[http://www.aldacs.com/DocBase/AqNaOHSLEVLE.pdf Solid-Liquid Equilibrium (SLE) and Vapour-Liquid Equilibrium (VLE) of Aqueous NaOH]". Online report, accessed on 2017-04-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

When solutions with less than 18.4% NaOH are cooled, water [[ice]] crystallizes first, leaving the NaOH in solution.&lt;ref name=pick/&gt;

The α form of the tetrahydrate has density 1.33 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. It melts congruously at 7.55&amp;nbsp;°C into a liquid with 35.7% NaOH and density 1.392 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, and therefore floats on it like ice on water. However, at about 4.9&amp;nbsp;°C it may instead melt incongruously into a mixture of solid NaOH·3.5{{chem|H|2|O}} and a liquid solution.&lt;ref name=mrawIII/&gt;

The β form of the tetrahydrate is metastable, and often transforms spontaneously to the α form when cooled below −20&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=mrawIII/&gt; Once initiated, the exothermic transformation is complete in a few minutes, with a 6.5% increase in volume of the solid. The β form can be crystallized from supercooled solutions at −26&amp;nbsp;°C, and melts partially at −1.83&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name=mrawIII/&gt;

The "sodium hydroxide" of commerce is often the monohydrate (density 1.829 g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;). Physical data in technical literature may refer to this form, rather than the anhydrous compound.

====Crystal structure====
The monohydrate crystallizes in the space group Pbca, with cell dimensions a = 1.1825, b = 0.6213, c = 0.6069 [[nanometer|nm]]. The atoms are arranged in a [[hydrargillite]]-like layer structure /O Na O O Na O/... Each sodium atom is surrounded by six oxygen atoms, three each from hydroxyl anions {{chem|HO|−}} and three from water molecules. The hydrogen atoms of the hydroxyls form strong bonds with oxygen atoms within each O layer. Adjacent O layers are held together by [[hydrogen bond]]s between water molecules.&lt;ref name=jacobs&gt;H. Jacobs and U. Metzner (1991): "Ungewöhnliche H-Brückenbindungen in Natriumhydroxidmonohydrat: Röntgen- und Neutronenbeugung an NaOH·H2O bzw. NaOD·D2O". ''Zeitschrift für anorganische und allgemeine Chemie'', volume 597, issue 1, pages 97-106. {{doi|10.1002/zaac.19915970113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chemical properties===

====Reaction with acids====
Sodium hydroxide reacts with protic acids to produce water and the corresponding salts. For example, when sodium hydroxide reacts with [[hydrochloric acid]], [[sodium chloride]] is formed:

:[[NaOH]]([[Aqueous|aq]]) + [[Hydrochloric acid|HCl]](aq) → [[Sodium chloride|NaCl]](aq) + [[Water (molecule)|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O]]([[Liquid|l]])

In general, such [[neutralization (chemistry)|neutralization]] reactions are represented by one simple net ionic equation:

:[[Hydroxide|OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;]](aq) + [[Proton|H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]](aq) → [[Water|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O]](l)

This type of reaction with a strong acid releases heat, and hence is [[exothermic reaction|exothermic]]. Such [[acid-base reaction]]s can also be used for [[titration]]s. However, sodium hydroxide is not used as a [[primary standard]] because it is [[hygroscopic]] and absorbs [[carbon dioxide]] from air.

====Reaction with acidic oxides====
Sodium hydroxide also reacts with [[acid anhydride|acidic oxides]], such as [[sulfur dioxide]]. Such reactions are often used to "[[Scrubber|scrub]]" harmful acidic gases (like SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S) produced in the burning of coal and thus prevent their release into the atmosphere. For example,

:2 NaOH + [[Sulfur dioxide|SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] → [[Sodium sulfite|Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

====Reaction with amphoteric metals and oxides====
Glass reacts slowly with aqueous sodium hydroxide solutions at ambient temperatures to form soluble [[silicate]]s. Because of this, glass joints and [[stopcock]]s exposed to sodium hydroxide have a tendency to "freeze". [[Laboratory flask|Flask]]s and glass-lined [[chemical reactor]]s are damaged by long exposure to hot sodium hydroxide, which also frosts the glass. Sodium hydroxide does not attack [[iron]] at room temperatures, since iron does not have [[amphoteric]] properties (i.e., it only dissolves in acid, not base). 
Nevertheless at high temperatures (e.g. above 500°C), iron can react [[endothermic]]ally with sodium hydroxide to form [[iron(III) oxide]], [[sodium]] metal, and [[hydrogen]] gas&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation
| last = 祖恩
| first = 许 
| title = 钾素,钾肥溯源[J]
| date = 1992
}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This is due to the lower [[enthalpy of formation]] of iron(III) oxide (-824.2kJ/mol&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iron(III)_oxide | title=Iron(III) oxide}}&lt;/ref&gt;) compared to sodium hydroxide (-427kJ/mol&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium_hydroxide | title=Sodium hydroxide}}&lt;/ref&gt;), thus the reaction is thermodynamically favorable, although its endothermic nature indicates non-spontaneity. Consider the following reaction between molten sodium hydroxide and finely divided iron filings:

: 4 Fe + 6 NaOH → 2 Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 6 Na + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; 

A few [[transition metal]]s, however, may react vigorously with sodium hydroxide.

In 1986, an aluminium [[tank truck|road tanker]] in the UK was mistakenly used to transport 25% sodium hydroxide solution,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

| isbn = 978-1-74125-299-6
}}&lt;/ref&gt; causing pressurization of the contents and damage to the tanker. The pressurization was due to the hydrogen gas which is produced in the reaction between sodium hydroxide and aluminium:

: 2 Al + 2 NaOH + 6 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → 2 NaAl(OH)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

====Precipitant====
Unlike sodium hydroxide, the hydroxides of most transition metals are insoluble, and therefore sodium hydroxide can be used to [[precipitate]] transition metal hydroxides. The following colours are observed: blue-copper, green-iron(II), yellow/brown-iron(III). Zinc and lead salts dissolve in excess sodium hydroxide to give a clear solution of Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ZnO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PbO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

[[Aluminium hydroxide]] is used as a gelatinous [[Flocculation#Flocculants|flocculant]] to filter out particulate matter in [[water treatment]]. Aluminium hydroxide is prepared at the treatment plant from [[aluminium sulfate]] by reacting it with sodium hydroxide or bicarbonate.

:Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 6 NaOH → 2 Al(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 3 Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
:Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 6 NaHCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 Al(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 3 Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 6 CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

====Saponification====
Sodium hydroxide can be used for the base-driven [[hydrolysis]] of [[ester]]s (as in [[saponification]]), [[amide]]s and [[alkyl halide]]s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, the limited solubility of sodium hydroxide in organic solvents means that the more [[soluble]] [[potassium hydroxide]] (KOH) is often preferred. Touching sodium hydroxide solution with the bare hands, while not recommended, produces a slippery feeling. This happens because oils on the skin such as [[sebum]] are converted to soap.
Despite solubility in propylene glycol it is unlikely to replace water in saponificaction due to propylene glycol primary reaction with fat before reaction between sodium hydroxide and fat.

==Production==
Sodium hydroxide is industrially produced as a 50% solution by variations of the electrolytic [[chloralkali process]].&lt;ref name = Du&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1021/acs.est.8b01195 | pmid = 29669210 | title = Sodium hydroxide production from seawater desalination brine: process design and energy efficiency | author = Fengmin Du, David M Warsinger, Tamanna I Urmi, Gregory P Thiel, Amit Kumar, John H Lienhard | journal = Environmental Science &amp; Technology | volume = 52 | issue = 10 | pages = 5949–5958 | date = 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Chlorine gas]] is also produced in this process.&lt;ref name = Du/&gt; Solid sodium hydroxide is obtained from this solution by the evaporation of water. Solid sodium hydroxide is most commonly sold as flakes, [[prill]]s, and cast blocks.&lt;ref name = Ullmann/&gt;

In 2004, world production was estimated at 60 million dry metric tonnes of sodium hydroxide, and demand was estimated at 51 million tonnes.&lt;ref name = Ullmann&gt;{{Ullmann | doi = 10.1002/14356007.a24_345.pub2 | title = Sodium Hydroxide | author = Cetin Kurt, Jürgen Bittner | }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, total world production was around 45&amp;nbsp;million [[tonne]]s. North America and Asia each contributed around 14&amp;nbsp;million tonnes, while Europe produced around 10&amp;nbsp;million tonnes. In the United States, the major producer of sodium hydroxide is the [[Dow Chemical Company]], which has annual production around 3.7&amp;nbsp;million [[tonne]]s from sites at [[Freeport, Texas|Freeport]], Texas, and [[Plaquemine, Louisiana|Plaquemine]], Louisiana. Other major US producers include [[Oxychem]], [[PPG Industries|PPG]], [[Olin Corporation|Olin]], Pioneer Companies, Inc. (PIONA, which was purchased by Olin), and [[Formosa Plastics Group|Formosa]]. All of these companies use the [[chloralkali process]].&lt;ref name="Kirk"&gt;[http://www.mrw.interscience.wiley.com/kirk/kirk_articles_fs.html ''Kirk-Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology''], 5th edition, John Wiley &amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, sodium hydroxide was produced by treating [[sodium carbonate]] with [[calcium hydroxide]] in a [[metathesis reaction]]. (Sodium hydroxide is soluble while calcium carbonate is not.) This process was called causticizing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Deming|first1=Horace G. |title=General Chemistry: An Elementary Survey Emphasizing Industrial Applications of Fundamental Principles |edition=2nd  |year=1925 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. |location=New York  |page=452 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
:Ca(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(aq) + Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(s) → CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ↓ + 2 NaOH(aq)

This process was superseded by the [[Solvay process]] in the late 19th century, which was in turn supplanted by the [[chloralkali process]] which we use today.

Sodium hydroxide is also produced by combining pure sodium metal with water. The byproducts are hydrogen gas and heat, often resulting in a flame, making this a common demonstration of the reactivity of alkali metals in academic environments; however, it is not commercially viable, as the isolation of sodium metal is typically performed by reduction or electrolysis of sodium compounds including sodium hydroxide.

:''For further information in historical production, see [[alkali manufacture]].''

==Uses==
[[File:Lye.jpg|thumb|Canister of sodium hydroxide.]]
Sodium hydroxide is a popular strong [[base (chemistry)|base]] used in industry. Around 56% of sodium hydroxide produced is used by industry, 25% of which is used in the paper industry. Sodium hydroxide is also used in the manufacture of sodium salts and detergents, pH regulation, and organic synthesis. It is used in the [[Bayer process]] of [[aluminium]] production.&lt;ref name = Ullmann/&gt; In bulk, it is most often handled as an [[aqueous]] [[solution]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ppg.com/chemicals/chloralkali/products/Documents/CausticSodamanual2008.pdf |title=Document 2 - CausticSodamanual2008.pdf|year=2013 |accessdate=July 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; since solutions are cheaper and easier to handle.

Sodium hydroxide is used in many scenarios where it is desirable to increase the [[alkalinity]] of a mixture, or to neutralize acids.

For example, in the petroleum industry, sodium hydroxide is used as an additive in [[drilling mud]] to increase [[alkalinity]] in [[bentonite]] mud systems, to increase the mud [[viscosity]], and to neutralize any [[acid gas]] (such as [[hydrogen sulfide]] and [[carbon dioxide]]) which may be encountered in the [[geological formation]] as drilling progresses.

Poor quality [[crude oil]] can be treated with sodium hydroxide to remove [[sulfur]]ous impurities in a process known as ''caustic washing''. As above, sodium hydroxide reacts with weak acids such as hydrogen sulfide and mercaptans to yield non-volatile sodium salts, which can be removed. The waste which is formed is toxic and difficult to deal with, and the process is banned in many countries because of this. In 2006, [[Trafigura]] used the process and then [[2006 Côte d'Ivoire toxic waste dump|dumped the waste in Africa]].&lt;ref name="Guardian"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/sep/16/trafigura-case-toxic-slop|title=Trafigura case: toxic slop left behind by caustic washing|last=Sample|first=Ian|date=16 September 2009 |publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=2009-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/newsnight/8259765.stm|title=Trafigura knew of waste dangers|date=16 September 2009|publisher=BBC Newsnight|accessdate=2009-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{see also|Hydrodesulfurization}}

===Chemical pulping===
{{main article|Pulp (paper)}}
Sodium hydroxide is also widely used in pulping of wood for making paper or regenerated fibers. Along with [[sodium sulfide]], sodium hydroxide is a key component of the white liquor solution used to separate [[lignin]] from [[cellulose]] [[fiber]]s in the [[kraft process]]. It also plays a key role in several later stages of the process of [[Bleaching of wood pulp|bleaching the brown pulp]] resulting from the pulping process. These stages include [[oxygen]] delignification, [[oxidation|oxidative]] extraction, and simple extraction, all of which require a strong alkaline environment with a pH &gt; 10.5 at the end of the stages.

===Tissue digestion===
In a similar fashion, sodium hydroxide is used to digest tissues, as in a process that was used with farm animals at one time. This process involved placing a carcass into a sealed chamber, then adding a mixture of sodium hydroxide and water (which breaks the chemical bonds that keep the flesh intact). This eventually turns the body into a liquid with coffee-like appearance,&lt;ref name="Ayres"&gt;Ayres, Chris (27 February 2010) [http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/world/americas/article2002276.ece Clean green finish that sends a loved one down the drain] Times Online.

''Stiff: The Curious Lives of Human Cadavers'', New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Company. {{ISBN|0-393-32482-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Sodium hydroxide is frequently used in the process of decomposing [[roadkill]] dumped in landfills by animal disposal contractors.&lt;ref name="carcassdisposal"/&gt; Due to its low cost and availability, it has been used to dispose of corpses by criminals. Italian [[serial killer]] [[Leonarda Cianciulli]] used this chemical to turn dead bodies into soap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-27257822 |title= Sodium: Getting rid of dirt – and murder victims |date= 3 May 2014 |publisher= [[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Mexico, a man who worked for drug cartels admitted disposing of over 300 bodies with it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/01/26/AR2009012602190.html | author = William Booth | title = 'Stewmaker' Stirs Horror in Mexico | publisher = ''[[Washington Post]]'' | date = January 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sodium hydroxide is a dangerous chemical due to its ability to hydrolyze protein. If a dilute solution is spilled on the skin, burns may result if the area is not washed thoroughly and for several minutes with running water. Splashes in the eye can be more serious and can lead to blindness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/MMG/MMG.asp?id=246&amp;tid=45|title=ATSDR - Medical Management Guidelines (MMGs): Sodium Hydroxide|website=www.atsdr.cdc.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dissolving amphoteric metals and compounds===
Strong bases attack [[aluminium]]. Sodium hydroxide reacts with aluminium and water to release hydrogen gas. The aluminium takes the oxygen atom from sodium hydroxide, which in turn takes the oxygen atom from the water, and releases the two hydrogen atoms, The reaction thus produces [[hydrogen]] gas and [[sodium aluminate]]. In this reaction, sodium hydroxide acts as an agent to make the solution alkaline, which aluminium can dissolve in. This reaction can be useful in etching, removing anodizing, or converting a polished surface to a satin-like finish, but without further [[Passivation (chemistry)|passivation]] such as [[anodizing]] or [[alodining]] the surface may become degraded, either under normal use or in severe atmospheric conditions.

In the [[Bayer process]], sodium hydroxide is used in the refining of [[alumina]] containing ores ([[bauxite]]) to produce alumina (aluminium oxide) which is the raw material used to produce [[aluminium]] metal via the [[electrolysis|electrolytic]] [[Hall-Héroult process]]. Since the alumina is [[amphoteric]], it dissolves in the sodium hydroxide, leaving impurities less soluble at high pH such as [[iron oxides]] behind in the form of a highly alkaline [[red mud]]. {{see also | Ajka alumina plant accident}}

Other amphoteric metals are zinc and lead which dissolve in concentrated sodium hydroxide solutions to give [[sodium zincate]] and sodium plumbate respectively.

===Esterification and transesterification reagent===
Sodium hydroxide is traditionally used in soap making ([[cold process]] soap, [[saponification]]).&lt;ref name="Morfit"&gt;{{cite book|title =A treatise on chemistry applied to the manufacture of soap and candles|first= Campbell|last=Morfit|authorlink=Campbell Morfit|publisher=Parry and McMillan|year = 1856|url =https://books.google.com/books?id=XVBDAAAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was made in the nineteenth century for a hard surface rather than liquid product because it was easier to store and transport.

For the manufacture of [[biodiesel]], sodium hydroxide is used as a [[catalyst]] for the [[transesterification]] of methanol and triglycerides. This only works with [[anhydrous]] sodium hydroxide, because combined with water the fat would turn into [[soap]], which would be tainted with [[methanol]]. NaOH is used more often than [[potassium hydroxide]] because it is cheaper and a smaller quantity is needed.

===Food preparation===
Food uses of sodium hydroxide include washing or chemical peeling of [[fruits]] and [[vegetables]], [[chocolate]] and [[Cocoa mass|cocoa]] processing, [[caramel coloring]] production, [[poultry]] scalding, [[soft drink]] processing, and thickening [[ice cream]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.rsc.org/chemistryworld/podcast/CIIEcompounds/transcripts/NaOH.asp |title=Sodium Hydroxide |work=rsc.org | year=2014 |accessdate=November 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Olive]]s are often soaked in sodium hydroxide for softening; [[Pretzel]]s and German [[lye roll]]s are glazed with a sodium hydroxide solution before baking to make them crisp. Owing to the difficulty in obtaining food grade sodium hydroxide in small quantities for home use, [[sodium carbonate]] is often used in place of sodium hydroxide.&lt;ref name="Hominy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uga.edu/nchfp/publications/uga/hominy_without_lye.html| title=Hominy without Lye| publisher=National Center for Home Food Preservation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Specific foods processed with sodium hydroxide include:

*German [[pretzel]]s are poached in a boiling [[sodium carbonate]] solution or cold sodium hydroxide solution before baking, which contributes to their unique crust.
*Lye-water is an essential ingredient in the crust of the traditional baked Chinese moon cakes.
*Most yellow coloured [[Chinese noodles]] are made with [[lye]]-water but are commonly mistaken for containing egg.
*Sodium hydroxide is also the chemical that causes gelling of egg whites in the production of [[Century egg]]s.
*Some methods of preparing olives involve subjecting them to a lye-based brine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://ucanr.org/freepubs/docs/8267.pdf |title=Olives: Safe Methods for Home Pickling (application/pdf Object) |work=ucanr.org |year=2010 |accessdate=January 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Filipino dessert (''kakanin'') called ''[[kutsinta]]'' uses a small quantity of lye water to help give the rice flour batter a jelly like consistency. A similar process is also used in the kakanin known as ''[[pitsi-pitsi]]'' or ''pichi-pichi'' except that the mixture uses grated [[cassava]] instead of rice flour.
*The [[Norway|Norwegian]] dish known as [[lutefisk]] (from ''lutfisk'', "lye fish").
*[[Bagel|Bagels]] are often boiled in a lye solution before baking, contributing to their shiny crust. 
*[[Hominy]] is dried [[maize]] (corn) kernels reconstituted by soaking in [[lye]]-water. These expand considerably in size and may be further processed by frying to make [[corn nuts]] or by drying and grinding to make [[grits]]. Hominy is used to create [[Masa]], a popular flour used in Mexican cuisine to make [[Corn tortillas]] and [[tamales]]. [[Nixtamal]] is similar, but uses [[calcium hydroxide]] instead of sodium hydroxide.

===Cleaning agent===
{{Main article|Cleaning agent}}
Sodium hydroxide is frequently used as an industrial [[cleaning agent]] where it is often called "caustic". It is added to water, heated, and then used to clean process equipment, storage tanks, etc. It can dissolve [[grease (lubricant)|grease]], [[oils]], [[fat]]s and [[protein]]-based deposits. It is also used for cleaning waste discharge pipes under sinks and drains in domestic properties. [[Surfactants]] can be added to the sodium hydroxide solution in order to stabilize dissolved substances and thus prevent redeposition. A sodium hydroxide soak solution is used as a powerful degreaser on [[stainless steel]] and glass bakeware. It is also a common ingredient in oven cleaners.

A common use of sodium hydroxide is in the production of [[parts washer]] [[detergent]]s. Parts washer detergents based on sodium hydroxide are some of the most aggressive parts washer cleaning chemicals. The sodium hydroxide-based detergents include surfactants, rust inhibitors and defoamers. A parts washer heats water and the detergent in a closed cabinet and then sprays the heated sodium hydroxide and hot water at pressure against dirty parts for degreasing applications. Sodium hydroxide used in this manner replaced many solvent-based systems in the early 1990s{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} when [[1,1,1-Trichloroethane|trichloroethane]] was outlawed by the [[Montreal Protocol]]. Water and sodium hydroxide detergent-based parts washers are considered to be an environmental improvement over the solvent-based cleaning methods.

[[File:NaOH - drain-cleaner.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Hardware store]]s grade sodium hydroxide to be used as a type of [[drain cleaner#Alkaline drain openers|drain cleaner]].]]
[[File:Paint stripping with caustic soda.jpg|thumb|upright|Paint stripping with caustic soda]]
Sodium hydroxide is used in the home as a type of [[drain cleaner#Alkaline drain openers|drain opener]] to unblock clogged drains, usually in the form of a dry crystal or as a thick liquid gel. The alkali dissolves [[fat|greases]] to produce [[water soluble]] [[product (chemistry)|products]]. It also [[hydrolysis|hydrolyzes]] the [[proteins]] such as those found in [[hair]] which may block water pipes. These reactions are sped by the [[exothermic|heat generated]] when sodium hydroxide and the other chemical components of the cleaner dissolve in water. Such [[drain cleaner#Alkaline drain openers|alkaline drain cleaners]] and their [[drain cleaner#Acidic drain openers|acidic versions]] are highly [[corrosive]] and should be handled with great caution.

Sodium hydroxide is used in some [[relaxer]]s to [[straighten hair]]. However, because of the high incidence and intensity of chemical burns, manufacturers of chemical relaxers use other alkaline chemicals in preparations available to average consumers. Sodium hydroxide relaxers are still available, but they are used mostly by professionals.

A solution of sodium hydroxide in water was traditionally used as the most common paint stripper on wooden objects. Its use has become less common, because it can damage the wood surface, raising the grain and staining the colour.

===Water treatment===
Sodium hydroxide is sometimes used during [[water purification]] to raise the pH of water supplies. Increased pH makes the water less corrosive to plumbing and reduces the amount of lead, copper and other toxic metals that can dissolve into drinking water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://articles.extension.org/pages/32302/drinking-water-treatment-ph-adjustment |title=Drinking Water Treatment - pH Adjustment|year=2011 |accessdate=June 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.water-research.net/index.php/drinking-water-issues-corrosive-water-lead-copper-aluminum-zinc-and-more|author=Brian Oram, PG|title=Drinking Water Issues Corrosive Water (Lead, Copper, Aluminum, Zinc and More)|year=2014|accessdate=June 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical uses===
Sodium hydroxide has been used for detection of [[carbon monoxide poisoning]], with blood samples of such patients turning to a [[vermilion]] color upon the addition of a few drops of sodium hydroxide.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=2df7-uOC8ZwC&amp;pg=PA168 Page 168] in: ''The Detection of poisons and strong drugs''.
Author: Wilhelm Autenrieth.
Publisher: P. Blakiston's son &amp; Company, 1909.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, carbon monoxide poisoning can be detected by [[CO oximetry]].

=== In cement mixes, mortars, concrete, grouts ===
Sodium hydroxide is used in some cement mix plasticisers. This helps homogenise cement mixes, preventing segregation of sands and cement, decreases the amount of water required in a mix and increases workability of the cement product, be it mortar, render or concrete.

=== Experimental ===
====Flavonoids====
See: [[Sodium hydroxide test]] for flavonoids

====Summer-winter heat storage====
[[EMPA]] researchers are experimenting with concentrated sodium hydroxide (NaOH) as the thermal storage or seasonal reservoir medium for domestic [[HVAC|space-heating]].  If water is added to solid or concentrated sodium hydroxide (NaOH), heat is released. The dilution is [[Exothermic process|exothermic]] - chemical energy is released in the form of heat. Conversely, by applying heat energy into a dilute sodium hydroxide solution the water will evaporate so that the solution becomes more concentrated and thus stores the supplied heat as [[Endothermic process|latent chemical energy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.empa.ch/web/s604/naoh-heat-storage|title=Empa - 604 - Communication - NaOH-heat-storage|website=www.empa.ch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Safety==
[[File:Sodium hydroxide burn.png|thumb|right|[[Chemical burn]]s caused by sodium hydroxide solution photographed 44 hours after exposure.]]

Like other [[corrosive]] [[acid]]s and [[alkali]]s, drops of sodium hydroxide solutions can readily decompose [[proteins]] and [[lipids]] in [[Tissue (biology)|living tissues]] via [[Hydrolysis#Esters and amides|amide hydrolysis and ester hydrolysis]], which consequently cause [[chemical burn]]s and may induce permanent [[blindness]] upon contact with eyes.&lt;ref name="msd"/&gt;&lt;ref name="msd2"/&gt; Solid alkali can also express its corrosive nature if there is water, such as water vapor. Thus, [[protective equipment]], like [[rubber gloves]], [[safety clothing]] and [[eye protection]], should always be used when handling this chemical or its solutions. The standard first aid measures for alkali spills on the skin is, as for other corrosives, irrigation with large quantities of water. Washing is continued for at least ten to fifteen minutes.

[[Button cell#Health issues|Lithium battery cells]], if ingested, cause serious injuries, even if not crushed. The damage is caused, not by the contents of the battery, but by the electric current it creates, which causes sodium hydroxide  to build up and burn through the [[oesophagus]] and into major [[blood vessel]]s, which can cause fatal bleeding.

Moreover, [[solvation|dissolution]] of sodium hydroxide is highly [[exothermic]], and the resulting heat may cause heat burns or ignite flammables. It also produces heat when reacted with acids.
 
Sodium hydroxide is also mildly corrosive to [[glass]], which can cause damage to [[glazing (window)|glazing]] or cause [[ground glass joint]]s to bind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/sodium_hydroxide|title=SODIUM HYDROXIDE {{!}} NaOH - PubChem|last=Pubchem|website=pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov|access-date=2016-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sodium hydroxide is corrosive to several metals, like [[aluminium]] which reacts with the alkali to produce flammable [[hydrogen]] gas on contact:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www1.eere.energy.gov/hydrogenandfuelcells/pdfs/aluminium_water_hydrogen.pdf |title=aluminium_water_hydrogen.pdf (application/pdf Object) |work=www1.eere.energy.gov |year=2008 |accessdate=January 15, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120914043825/http://www1.eere.energy.gov/hydrogenandfuelcells/pdfs/aluminium_water_hydrogen.pdf |archivedate=September 14, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Storage ==
Careful storage is needed when handling sodium hydroxide for use, especially bulk volumes. Following proper NaOH storage guidelines and maintaining worker/environment safety is always recommended given the chemical's burn hazard. Sodium hydroxide is often stored in bottles--as in laboratories, small-scale use--within [[Intermediate bulk container|intermediate bulk containers]]--medium volume containers for cargo handling and transport--or within large stationary storage tanks with volumes up to 100,000 gallons--as in manufacturing or waste water plants with extensive NaOH use. Common materials that are compatible with sodium hydroxide and often utilized for NaOH storage include: polyethylene ([[HDPE]], usual, [[Cross-linked polyethylene|XLPE]], less common), [[carbon steel]], [[polyvinyl chloride]] (PVC), [[stainless steel]], and [[fiberglass reinforced plastic]] (FRP, with a resistant liner).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== History ==

Sodium hydroxide was first prepared by soap makers.&lt;ref name=thorpe&gt;Thorpe, Thomas Edward, ed., ''A Dictionary of Applied Chemistry'' (London, England:  Longmans, Green, and Co., 1913), vol. 5, [https://books.google.com/books?id=7tI5AQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA36#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|p45}}  A procedure for making sodium hydroxide appeared as part of a recipe for making soap in an Arab book of the late 13th century:  ''Al-mukhtara` fi funun min al-suna`'' (Inventions from the Various Industrial Arts), which was compiled by al-Muzaffar Yusuf ibn `Umar ibn `Ali ibn Rasul (d. 1295), a king of Yemen.&lt;ref&gt;See:  [http://www.history-science-technology.com/notes/notes5.html History of Science and Technology in Islam:  Description of Soap Making]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The English chemist and archaeologist Henry Ernest Stapleton (1878–1962) presented evidence that the Persian alchemist and physician [[Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi]] (854–925) knew about sodium hydroxide.  See:  Henry Ernest Stapleton; R. F. Azo; M. Hid'yat Ḥusain (1927) "Chemistry in 'Iraq and Persia in the Tenth Century A.D.," ''Memoirs of the Asiatic Society of Bengal'', '''8''' (6) :  317–418 ; see p. 322.&lt;/ref&gt;  The recipe called for passing water repeatedly through a mixture of ''[[alkali]]'' (Arabic:  ''al-qily'', where ''qily'' is ash from [[Glasswort|saltwort]] plants, which are rich in sodium ; hence ''alkali'' was impure [[sodium carbonate]])&lt;ref&gt;Stapleton, H. E. and Azo, R. F. (1905) "Alchemical equipment in the eleventh century, A.D.," ''Memoirs of the Asiatic Society of Bengal'', '''1''' :  47–71 ; [https://books.google.com/books?id=nbobAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA53#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false see footnote 5 on p. 53.]  From p. 53:  "5. Sodium carbonate.  Qily is the ashes of certain plants, e.g. Salsola and Salicornia … , which grow near the sea, or in salty places … "&lt;/ref&gt; and quicklime ([[calcium oxide]], CaO), whereby a solution of sodium hydroxide was obtained.  European soap makers also followed this recipe.  When in 1791 the French chemist and surgeon [[Nicolas Leblanc]] (1742–1806) patented a [[Leblanc process|process for mass-producing sodium carbonate]], natural "soda ash" (impure sodium carbonate that was obtained from the ashes of plants that are rich in sodium)&lt;ref name=thorpe/&gt;{{rp|p36}} was replaced by this artificial version.&lt;ref name=thorpe/&gt;{{rp|p46}}  However, by the 20th century, the [[Chloralkali process|electrolysis of sodium chloride]] had become the primary method for producing sodium hydroxide.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas F. O’Brien, Tilak V. Bommaraju, Fumio Hine, ''Handbook of Chlor-Alkali Technology'', vol. 1 (Berlin, Germany:  Springer Verlag, 2005), Chapter 2:  History of the Chlor-Alkali Industry, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Acetic acid.jpg|thumb|upright|A bottle of [[acetic acid]], a liquid solvent]]
A '''solvent''' (from the [[Latin language|Latin]] ''[[wikt:solvo#Latin|solvō]]'', "loosen, untie, solve") is a substance that dissolves a solute (a chemically distinct liquid, solid or gas), resulting in a [[solution]]. A solvent is usually a liquid but can also be a solid, a gas, or a [[supercritical fluid]]. The quantity of solute that can dissolve in a specific volume of solvent varies with [[temperature]]. Common uses for [[Organic compound|organic]] solvents are in [[dry cleaning]] (e.g. [[tetrachloroethylene]]), as [[paint thinner]]s (e.g. [[toluene]], [[turpentine]]), as nail polish removers and glue solvents ([[acetone]], [[methyl acetate]], [[ethyl acetate]]), in spot removers (e.g. [[hexane]], petrol ether), in detergents ([[D-limonene|citrus terpenes]]) and in [[perfume]]s ([[ethanol]]). Water is a solvent for [[Chemical_polarity#Polarity_of_molecules|polar molecules]] and the most common solvent used by living things; all the ions and proteins in a cell are dissolved in water within a cell. Solvents find various applications in chemical, [[pharmaceutical]], oil, and gas industries, including in [[Chemical synthesis|chemical syntheses]] and purification processes.

==Solutions and solvation==
When one substance is [[Dissolution (chemistry)|dissolved]] into another, a [[solution]] is formed.&lt;ref&gt;Tinoco, Ignacio; Sauer, Kenneth and Wang, James C. (2002) ''Physical Chemistry'' Prentice Hall p. 134 {{ISBN|0-13-026607-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is opposed to the situation when the compounds are [[solubility|insoluble]] like sand in water. In a solution, all of the ingredients are uniformly distributed at a molecular level and no residue remains. A solvent-solute mixture consists of a single [[Phase (matter)|phase]] with all solute molecules occurring as ''solvates'' (solvent-solute [[Coordination complex|complexes]]), as opposed to separate continuous phases as in suspensions, emulsions and other types of non-solution mixtures. The ability of one compound to be dissolved in another is known as [[solubility]]; if this occurs in all proportions, it is called [[miscibility|miscible]].

In addition to mixing, the substances in a solution interact with each other at the molecular level. When something is dissolved, molecules of the solvent arrange around [[molecules]] of the solute. [[Heat transfer]] is involved and [[entropy]] is increased making the solution more [[thermodynamics|thermodynamically]] stable than the solute and solvent separately. This arrangement is mediated by the respective chemical properties of the solvent and solute, such as [[hydrogen bonding]], [[Bond dipole moment|dipole moment]] and [[polarizability]].&lt;ref&gt;Lowery and Richardson, pp. 181–183&lt;/ref&gt; Solvation does not cause a chemical reaction or chemical configuration changes in the solute. However, solvation resembles a [[coordination complex]] formation reaction, often with considerable energetics (heat of solvation and entropy of solvation) and is thus far from a neutral process.

==Solvent classifications==
Solvents can be broadly classified into two categories: ''polar'' and ''non-polar''. A special case is [[mercury (element)|mercury]], whose solutions are known as [[Amalgam (chemistry)|amalgams]]; also, other [[liquid metal|metal solutions]] exist which are liquid at room temperature. Generally, the [[dielectric constant]] of the solvent provides a rough measure of a solvent's polarity. The strong polarity of water is indicated by its high dielectric constant of 88 (at 0&amp;nbsp;°C).&lt;ref name="NIST water"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Malmberg|first1=C. G.|last2=Maryott|first2=A. A.|title=Dielectric Constant of Water from 0° to 100°C|journal=Journal of Research of the National Bureau of Standards|date=January 1956|volume=56|issue=1|page=1|url=http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/jres/56/jresv56n1p1_a1b.pdf|accessdate=27 June 2014|doi=10.6028/jres.056.001|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140819085028/http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/jres/56/jresv56n1p1_a1b.pdf|archivedate=19 August 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Solvents with a dielectric constant of less than 15 are generally considered to be nonpolar.&lt;ref name=p177&gt;Lowery and Richardson, p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt; The dielectric constant measures the solvent's tendency to partly cancel the field strength of the electric field of a [[ion|charged particle]] immersed in it. This reduction is then compared to the [[field strength]] of the charged particle in a vacuum.&lt;ref name=p177/&gt; Heuristically, the dielectric constant of a solvent can be thought of as its ability to reduce the solute's effective [[chemical polarity|internal charge]]. Generally, the dielectric constant of a solvent is an acceptable predictor of the solvent's ability to dissolve common [[ionic compound]]s, such as salts.

===Other polarity scales===
Dielectric constants are not the only measure of polarity. Because solvents are used by chemists to carry out chemical reactions or observe chemical and biological phenomena, more specific measures of polarity are required. Most of these measures are sensitive to chemical structure.

The ''[[Grunwald–Winstein equation|Grunwald–Winstein]] m'''Y''' scale'' measures polarity in terms of solvent influence on buildup of positive charge of a solute during a chemical reaction.

''[[Edward Kosower|Kosower]]'s '''Z''' scale'' measures polarity in terms of the influence of the solvent on [[Ultraviolet|UV]]-absorption maxima of a salt, usually [[pyridinium]] [[iodide]] or the pyridinium [[zwitterion]].&lt;ref&gt;Kosower, E.M. (1969) "An introduction to Physical Organic Chemistry" Wiley: New York, p. 293&lt;/ref&gt;

''Donor number and donor acceptor scale'' measures polarity in terms of how a solvent interacts with specific substances, like a strong [[Lewis acid]] or a strong Lewis base.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author = Gutmann, V.|journal = Coord. Chem. Rev.|year = 1976|volume = 18|issue = 2|page = 225|doi = 10.1016/S0010-8545(00)82045-7|title = Solvent effects on the reactivities of organometallic compounds}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Hildebrand parameter]]'' is the square root of '''cohesive energy density'''. It can be used with nonpolar compounds, but cannot accommodate complex chemistry.

Reichardt's dye, a [[solvatochromic]] dye that changes color in response to polarity, gives a scale of ''E&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;''(30) values. ''E&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the transition energy between the ground state and the lowest excited state in kcal/mol, and (30) identifies the dye. Another, roughly correlated scale (''E&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;''(33)) can be defined with [[Nile red]].

The polarity, dipole moment, polarizability and [[hydrogen bonding]] of a solvent determines what type of [[Chemical compound|compounds]] it is able to dissolve and with what other solvents or liquid compounds it is [[miscible]]. Generally, polar solvents dissolve polar compounds best and non-polar solvents dissolve non-polar compounds best: "like dissolves like". Strongly polar compounds like [[sugars]] (e.g. sucrose) or ionic compounds, like [[Inorganic chemistry|inorganic]] [[Salt_(chemistry)|salt]]s (e.g. [[table salt]]) dissolve only in very polar solvents like water, while strongly non-polar compounds like [[oil]]s or [[wax]]es dissolve only in very non-polar organic solvents like [[hexane]]. Similarly, water and [[hexane]] (or [[vinegar]] and vegetable oil) are not [[miscible]] with each other and will quickly separate into two layers even after being shaken well.

Polarity can be separated to different contributions. For example, the '''Kamlet-Taft parameters''' are dipolarity/polarizability (''π*''), hydrogen-bonding acidity (''α'') and hydrogen-bonding basicity (''β''). These can be calculated from the wavelength shifts of 3–6 different solvatochromic dyes in the solvent, usually including [[Reichardt's dye]], [[nitroaniline]] and [[diethylnitroaniline]]. Another option, Hansen's parameters, separate the cohesive energy density into dispersion, polar and hydrogen bonding contributions.

===Polar protic and polar aprotic===
Solvents with a dielectric constant (more accurately, [[relative static permittivity]]) greater than 15 (i.e. polar or polarizable) can be further divided into [[protic]] and aprotic. Protic solvents solvate [[anion]]s (negatively charged solutes) strongly via [[hydrogen bonding]]. Water is a protic solvent. Aprotic solvents such as [[acetone]] or [[dichloromethane]] tend to have large [[Molecular dipole moment|dipole moments]] (separation of partial positive and partial negative charges within the same molecule) and solvate positively charged species via their negative dipole.&lt;ref&gt;Lowery and Richardson, p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[chemical reaction]]s the use of polar protic solvents favors the [[SN1 reaction|S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;1]] [[reaction mechanism]], while polar aprotic solvents favor the [[SN2 reaction|S&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;2]] reaction mechanism. These polar solvents are capable of forming hydrogen bonds with water to dissolve in water whereas non polar solvents are not capable of strong hydrogen bonds.

===Hansen solubility parameter values===
The Hansen solubility parameter values&lt;ref name=hansen/&gt;&lt;ref name=hansen2/&gt; are based on [[Van der Waals forces|dispersion bonds]] (δD), [[polar bonds]] (δP) and [[hydrogen bonds]] (δH). These contain information about the inter-molecular interactions with other solvents and also with polymers, pigments, nanoparticles, etc. This allows for rational formulations knowing, for example, that there is a good HSP match between a solvent and a polymer. Rational substitutions can also be made for "good" solvents (effective at dissolving the solute) that are "bad" (expensive or hazardous to health or the environment). The following table shows that the intuitions from "non-polar", "polar aprotic" and "polar protic" are put numerically – the "polar" molecules have higher levels of δP and the protic solvents have higher levels of δH. Because numerical values are used, comparisons can be made rationally by comparing numbers. For example, acetonitrile is much more polar than acetone but exhibits slightly less hydrogen bonding.

If, for environmental or other reasons, a solvent or solvent blend is required to replace another of equivalent solvency, the substitution can be made on the basis of the [[Hansen solubility parameters]] of each. The values for mixtures are taken as the [[weighted average]]s of the values for the neat solvents. This can be calculated by [[trial-and-error]], a spreadsheet of values, or HSP software.&lt;ref name=hansen&gt;Abbott, Steven and Hansen, Charles M. (2008) [https://books.google.com/books?id=efMbTvlfc8wC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Hansen Hansen Solubility Parameters in Practice] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160729170951/https://books.google.com/books?id=efMbTvlfc8wC&amp;printsec=frontcover |date=29 July 2016 }}, {{ISBN|0-9551220-2-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hansen2&gt;Hansen, Charles M.

Because of the health hazards associated with toluene itself, other mixtures of solvents may be found using a full [[Hansen solubility parameter|HSP]] dataset.

The boiling point is an important property because it determines the speed of evaporation. Small amounts of low-boiling-point solvents like [[diethyl ether]], [[dichloromethane]], or acetone will evaporate in seconds at room temperature, while high-boiling-point solvents like water or [[dimethyl sulfoxide]] need higher temperatures, an air flow, or the application of [[vacuum]] for fast evaporation.
*Low boilers: boiling point below 100&amp;nbsp;°C (boiling point of water)
*Medium boilers: between 100&amp;nbsp;°C and 150&amp;nbsp;°C
*High boilers: above 150&amp;nbsp;°C

===Density===
Most organic solvents have a lower [[density]] than water, which means they are lighter than and will form a layer on top of water. Important exceptions are most of the [[halogen]]ated solvents like [[dichloromethane]] or [[chloroform]] will sink to the bottom of a container, leaving water as the top layer. This is crucial to remember when [[partition coefficient|partitioning]] compounds between solvents and water in a [[separatory funnel]] during chemical syntheses.

Often, [[specific gravity]] is cited in place of density. Specific gravity is defined as the density of the solvent divided by the density of water at the same temperature. As such, specific gravity is a unitless value. It readily communicates whether a water-insoluble solvent will float (SG &lt; 1.0) or sink (SG &gt; 1.0) when mixed with water.

==Safety==

===Fire===
Most organic solvents are flammable or highly flammable, depending on their volatility. Exceptions are some chlorinated solvents like [[dichloromethane]] and [[chloroform]]. Mixtures of solvent vapors and air can [[explosion|explode]]. Solvent vapors are heavier than air; they will sink to the bottom and can travel large distances nearly undiluted. Solvent vapors can also be found in supposedly empty drums and cans, posing a [[flash fire]] hazard; hence empty containers of volatile solvents should be stored open and upside down.

Both [[diethyl ether]] and [[carbon disulfide]] have exceptionally low [[autoignition temperature]]s which increase greatly the fire risk associated with these solvents. The autoignition temperature of carbon disulfide is below 100&amp;nbsp;°C (212&amp;nbsp;°F), so objects such as [[steam]] pipes, [[light bulb]]s, [[hotplate]]s, and recently-extinguished [[bunsen burner]]s are able to ignite its vapours.

In addition some solvents, such as methanol, can burn with a very hot flame which can be nearly invisible under some lighting conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fanick|first=E. Robert|last2=Smith|first2=Lawrence R.|last3=Baines|first3=Thomas M.|date=1984-10-01|title=Safety Related Additives for Methanol Fuel|url=http://papers.sae.org/841378/|language=English|location=Warrendale, PA|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170812062146/http://papers.sae.org/841378/|archivedate=12 August 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Anderson|first=J. E.|last2=Magyarl|first2=M. W.|last3=Siegl|first3=W. O.|date=1985-07-01|title=Concerning the Luminosity of Methanol-Hydrocarbon Diffusion Flames|journal=Combustion Science and Technology|volume=43|issue=3–4|pages=115–125|doi=10.1080/00102208508947000|issn=0010-2202}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can delay or prevent the timely recognition of a dangerous fire, until flames spread to other materials.

===Explosive peroxide formation===
[[Ether]]s like [[diethyl ether]] and [[tetrahydrofuran]] (THF) can form highly explosive [[organic peroxide]]s upon exposure to oxygen and light. THF is normally more likely to form such peroxides than diethyl ether. One of the most susceptible solvents is [[diisopropyl ether]], but all ethers are considered to be potential peroxide sources.

The heteroatom ([[oxygen]]) stabilizes the formation of a [[free radical]] which is formed by the abstraction of a [[hydrogen]] atom by another free radical.{{clarify|date=March 2017}} The carbon-centred free radical thus formed is able to react with an oxygen molecule to form a peroxide compound. The process of peroxide formation is greatly accelerated by exposure to even low levels of light, but can proceed slowly even in dark conditions. 

Unless a [[desiccant]] is used which can destroy the peroxides, they will concentrate during [[distillation]], due to their higher [[boiling point]]. When sufficient peroxides have formed, they can form a [[crystalline]], shock-sensitive solid [[precipitate]] at the mouth of a container or bottle. Minor mechanical disturbances, such as scraping the inside of a vessel or the dislodging of a deposit, merely twisting the cap may provide sufficient energy for the peroxide to explode or [[detonation|detonate]]. Peroxide formation is not a significant problem when fresh solvents are used up quickly; they are more of a problem in laboratories which may take years to finish a single bottle. Low-volume users should acquire only small amounts of peroxide-prone solvents, and dispose of old solvents on a regular periodic schedule.

To avoid explosive peroxide formation, ethers should be stored in an aritight container, away from light, because both light and air can encourage peroxide formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.uaf.edu/safety/industrial-hygiene/laboratory-safety/chem-gas/chemical-hazards/peroxides-ethers/|title=Peroxides and Ethers {{!}} Environmental Health, Safety and Risk Management|website=www.uaf.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of tests can be used to detect the presence of a peroxide in an ether; one is to use a combination of [[iron(II) sulfate]] and [[potassium thiocyanate]]. The peroxide is able to [[oxidize]] the Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ion to an Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ion, which then forms a deep-red [[coordination complex]] with the [[thiocyanate]].

Peroxides may be removed by washing with acidic iron(II) sulfate, filtering through [[alumina]], or [[distillation|distilling]] from [[sodium]]/[[benzophenone]]. Aluminum does not destroy the peroxides but merely traps them, and must be disposed of properly. The advantage of using sodium/benzophenone is that [[moisture]] and oxygen are removed as well.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

==Health effects==
General health hazards associated with solvent exposure include toxicity to the nervous system, reproductive damage, liver and kidney damage, respiratory impairment, cancer, and [[dermatitis]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/solvents/index.html U.S. Department of Labor &gt; Occupational Safety &amp; Health Administration &gt; Solvents] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160315034707/https://www.osha.gov/SLTC/solvents/index.html |date=15 March 2016 }}. osha.gov&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acute exposure===
Many solvents can lead to a sudden loss of consciousness if [[inhalation|inhaled]] in large amounts. Solvents like [[diethyl ether]] and [[chloroform]] have been used in medicine as [[anesthetics]], [[sedatives]], and [[hypnotics]] for a long time. [[Ethanol]] (grain alcohol) is a widely used and abused [[psychoactive drug]]. Diethyl ether, chloroform, and many other solvents e.g. from [[gasoline]] or glues are abused recreationally in [[Volatile substance abuse|glue sniffing]], often with harmful long term health effects like [[neurotoxicity]] or [[cancer]]. 
Fraudulent substitution of [[1,5-pentanediol]] for the psychoactive [[1,4-butanediol]] by a subcontractor caused the [[Bindeez]] product recall.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theage.com.au/news/national/recall-for-toy-that-turns-into-drug/2007/11/06/1194329225773.html|title=Recall ordered for toy that turns into drug - National - theage.com.au|website=www.theage.com.au|language=en|access-date=2018-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
If ingested, the so called toxic alcohols (other than ethanol) such as [[methanol]], [[propanol]], and [[ethylene glycol]] metabolize into toxic aldehydes and acids, which cause potentially fatal [[metabolic acidosis]].&lt;ref&gt;J.A. Kraut, M.E. Mullins [http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMra1615295?query=TOC Toxic Alcohols - Review] N Engl J Med 2018;378:270-280{{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The commonly available alcohol solvent methanol can cause permanent blindness or death if ingested. The solvent [[2-Butoxyethanol|2-butoxyethanol]], used in [[fracking fluid]]s, can cause [[hypotension]] and metabolic acidosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Fomepizole fails to prevent progression of acidosis in 2-Butoxyethanol and ethanol coingestion|journal=Clinical Toxicology|date=July 2010|volume=48|issue=6|pages=569–571|doi=10.3109/15563650.2010.492350|pmid=20560787|last1=Hung|first1=Tawny|last2=Dewitt|first2=Christopher R.|last3=Martz|first3=Walter|last4=Schreiber|first4=William|last5=Holmes|first5=Daniel Thomas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chronic exposure===
{{main|Chronic solvent-induced encephalopathy}}
Some solvents including [[chloroform]] and [[benzene]] a common ingredient in [[gasoline]] are known to be [[carcinogen]]ic, while many others are considered by the [[World Health Organization]] to be likely carcinogens. Solvents can damage internal organs like the [[liver]], the [[kidney]]s, the [[nervous system]], or the [[Human brain|brain]]. The cumulative effects of long-term or repeated exposure to solvents are called [[chronic solvent-induced encephalopathy]] (CSE).

Chronic exposure to organic solvents in the work environment can produce a range of adverse neuropsychiatric effects. For example, occupational exposure to organic solvents has been associated with higher numbers of painters suffering from [[alcoholism]].&lt;ref name="pmid1606027"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lundberg I, Gustavsson A, Högberg M, Nise G |title= Diagnoses of alcohol abuse and other neuropsychiatric disorders among house painters compared with house carpenters |journal=Br J Ind Med |volume=49 |issue=6 |pages=409–15 |year=1992 |pmid=1606027 |pmc=1012122 |doi=10.1136/oem.49.6.409}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ethanol has a [[synergy|synergistic]] effect when taken in combination with many solvents; for instance, a combination of [[toluene]]/[[benzene]] and ethanol causes greater [[nausea]]/[[vomiting]] than either substance alone.

Many solvents are known or suspected to be cataractogenic, greatly increasing the risk of developing [[cataract]]s in the lens of the eye.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | pmid = 1086605| year = 1976| author1 = Raitta| first1 = C| title = Lens changes in car painters exposed to a mixture of organic solvents| journal = Albrecht von Graefes Archiv für klinische und experimentelle Ophthalmologie| volume = 200| issue = 2| pages = 149–56| last2 = Husman| first2 = K| last3 = Tossavainen| first3 = A | doi=10.1007/bf00414364}}&lt;/ref&gt; Solvent exposure has also been associated with neurotoxic damage causing [[hearing loss]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Campo|first=Pierre|last2=Morata|first2=Thais C.|last3=Hong|first3=OiSaeng|title=Chemical exposure and hearing loss|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0011502913000229|journal=Disease-a-Month|volume=59|issue=4|pages=119–138|doi=10.1016/j.disamonth.2013.01.003|pmc=4693596|pmid=23507352|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171221235729/http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0011502913000229|archivedate=21 December 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johnson AC and Morata,|first=TC|year=2010|title=Occupational exposure to chemicals and hearing impairment.

===Environmental contamination===
A major pathway to induce health effects arises from spills or leaks of solvents that reach the underlying soil. Since solvents readily migrate substantial distances, the creation of widespread [[soil contamination]] is not uncommon; this is particularly a health risk if [[aquifer]]s are affected. [[Vapor intrusion]] can occur from sites with extensive subsurface solvent contamination.{{cn|date=March 2017}}

The '''South East Europe Pipeline''' was a proposal for a [[natural gas]] [[pipeline transport|pipeline]] from eastern [[Turkey]] to [[Baumgarten an der March]] in [[Austria]]. It was seen as an option for diversification of [[natural gas]] potential delivery routes for Europe from [[Azerbaijan]]. The pipeline would allow Azerbaijan to supply Europe with {{convert|10|e9m3|abbr=off}} of natural gas a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.businessweek.com/article.asp?documentKey=1376-LS4NTA6JTSEI01-4JDLA9KIUMAV010HE67BDHCA39 |title=BP to Consider New Pipeline to Transit Caspian Natural Gas to EU |publisher= Bloomberg Business Week |date=2011-09-26 |accessdate=2011-09-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The main source of the gas would be [[Shah Deniz gas field]] when its second stage comes online.&lt;ref name=FT/&gt;

[[File:Holman Projector in action.jpg|thumb|[[Holman Projector]] prototype in action, 1940.]]
A '''steam cannon''' is a [[cannon]] that launches a projectile using only heat and water, or using a ready supply of high-pressure [[steam]] from a [[boiler]]. The first steam cannon was designed by [[Archimedes]] during the [[Siege of Syracuse (214–212 BC)|Siege of Syracuse]]. [[Leonardo Da Vinci]] was also known to have designed one (the ''[[Architonnerre]]'').

The early device would consist of a large metal tube, preferably [[copper]] due to its high [[thermal conductivity]], which would be placed in a furnace. One end of the tube would be capped and the other loaded with a projectile. Once the tube reached a high enough temperature, a small amount of water would be injected in behind the projectile. In theory, Leonardo da Vinci believed, the water would rapidly expand into vapour, blasting the projectile out the front of the barrel.

==Age of Steam==
Various unsuccessful efforts were made during the [[Industrial Revolution|age of steam]] to create working steam [[machine gun]]s and cannons using methods and technology derived from [[steam locomotive]]s.

A successful [[World War II]] steam cannon was the [[Holman Projector]], which was used to launch explosive [[Mills bomb|grenade]]s into the air to create a defensive barrage against low-flying enemy aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

  |pages=81–90
}}&lt;/ref&gt; These later steam cannons were fired by rapidly introducing a burst of highly pressurized steam into the chamber behind the projectile, accelerating the projectile up the barrel at a high rate of speed, much like an air gun, only more powerful. The fundamental function of the device was basically the same as a [[steam engine]], only with a projectile taking place of a piston. The Holman Projector was produced by [[Holman Brothers]] of Cornwall, who specialised in pneumatic equipment for mining. The first Projectors were powered by compressed air, stored in high pressure cylinders. After a successful defence of the {{SS|Highlander}} in August 1940, downing two [[Heinkel He 115|Heinkel floatplane]]s, there was a demand for more projectors to be fitted to small [[naval trawler]]s.{{sfnp|Carter|2001|page=85}} As these vessels were steam-powered but had no compressed air system, the Admiralty requested Holmans to develop a steam-powered version of the Projector. With concerns by Treve Holman over the effects of heat on the Mills bomb projectile, a test was arranged where a borrowed council [[steam roller]] was used to 'cook' the Projector and projectile at 190&amp;nbsp;°C for 20 minutes before the projectile was safely fired to 1,000 feet altitude.{{sfnp|Carter|2001|pages=84–86}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5684">'''Tego film''' is an [[adhesive]] sheet, used in the manufacture of waterproof [[plywood]]. It is applied dry and cured by heat, which allows for high-quality laminates that are free from internal voids and warping. Tego film plywoods were used in aircraft manufacture in Germany during [[World War II]], and the loss of the plant during a 1943 bombing raid was a serious blow to several aircraft projects.

== Development and use for plywood ==
Tego film was developed in Germany around 1930 as a glue for [[waterproof plywood]]. It comprised a paper sheet [[pre-preg|pre-impregnated]] with a [[resole]] [[phenolic resin]].&lt;ref name="Goodman, 1998" &gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; When heated, assembled between [[wood veneer]]s and then compressed, a strong and waterproof laminated plywood was formed. Most plywood at this time used other adhesives, such as [[casein]]. These adhesives were generally applied as aqueous solutions, which caused warping of thin veneers and made it difficult to achieve a solid laminate without risk of voids. As Tego film was used dry, it gave a high integrity result, solid and without risk of hidden weaknesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This became an important factor in time, when it was applied to use in aircraft construction.

This adhesive was unique at its time and was only available as the ''Goldschmidt'' product line from its makers Goldmand AG of [[Wuppertal]]. By 1932 it was being exported worldwide.&lt;ref name="Goodman, 1998" /&gt;

== Use for aircraft ==
[[File:Focke-Wulf Ta 154.jpg|thumb|left|[[Focke-Wulf Ta 154|Focke-Wulf Ta 154 ''Moskito'']]]]
The [[de Havilland Albatross|de Havilland ''Albatross'']] airliner of 1936 had a [[fuselage]] of wooden sandwich construction: wafers of birch [[plywood]] were spaced apart by a [[balsa]] sheet and glued by a [[casein]] adhesive. This same construction, but with [[Aerolite (adhesive)|Aerolite]], a [[urea-formaldehyde]] adhesive, achieved fame with its wartime use in the [[de Havilland Mosquito|DH.98 ''Mosquito'']] fast bomber. As well as being a construction of light weight and high performance, it also avoided the use of aluminium, a [[strategic material]] during wartime, and could use the skills of woodworkers, rather than those of specialised aircraft metalworkers.

When Germany attempted to emulate this aircraft with the [[Focke-Wulf Ta 154|Ta 154 ''Moskito'']], it used Tego film.&lt;ref name="Wood, Hitler's Luftwaffe, Ta154" &gt;{{Cite book

== Modern use ==
The term 'Tego film' remains in use around plywood manufacturing today, although it has become generic. It is now used to refer to the phenolic resins still used for the manufacture of exterior plywood, although no longer indicates manufacture in Germany. Most of the plywood produced of this type is now from [[Indonesia]].

The '''umbric horizon''' (''Latin: umbra, shade'') is a thick, dark coloured, surface [[Soil horizon]] rich in organic matter. It is identified by its dark colour and structure. 
Normally it has a pH of less than 5.5 representing a [[base saturation]] of less than 50 percent. An indication for [[Soil acidification|Soil acidity]] is a rooting pattern whereby the roots tend to be horizontal.&lt;ref name = WDB&gt;[http://www.fao.org/docrep/W8594E/w8594e06.htm#diagnostic%20horizons World Reference Base for Soil Resources]&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar thick, dark coloured, organic-rich, base-desaturated surface horizons occur in [[anthropedogenic horizons]] from human activities such as deep cultivation, kitchen middens and the addition of organic manures etc.  
These horizons can usually be differentiated  by the presence of artifacts, spade marks  or by checking the agricultural history of the area&lt;ref name = WDB/&gt;

The [[World Reference Base for Soil Resources]] diagnostic criteria states that an umbric horizon must have:

*Soil structure sufficiently strong that the horizon is not both [[Crystal habit|massive]] and hard or very hard when dry.
*[[Munsell colours]] with a [[Munsell color system#Chroma|chroma]] value darker than 3.5 when moist and 5.5 when dry, both on broken and crushed samples.
*It is described as [[Cation exchange capacity|base-desaturated]] in that it has a base saturation of less than 50 percent on a weighted average throughout the depth of the horizon; and
*Organic carbon content of 0.6 percent or more throughout the thickness of mixed horizon
*A thickness of 100&amp;nbsp;mm if resting directly on hard rock; at least 200&amp;nbsp;mm/  more than one-third of the [[solum]] where the solum is less than 750&amp;nbsp;mm thick; or more than 250&amp;nbsp;mm where the solum is more than 750&amp;nbsp;mm thick.&lt;ref name = WDB/&gt;

The '''United Kingdom National Renewable Energy Action Plan''' is the [[National Renewable Energy Action Plan]] (NREAP) for the [[United Kingdom]]. The plan was commissioned by the [[Directive 2009/28/EC]] which required [[Member States of the European Union]] to notify the [[European Commission]] with a road map. The report describes how the United Kingdom planned to achieve its legally binding target of a 15% share of energy from renewable sources in gross final consumption of energy by 2020. 

== Main targets in UK ==
The history of energy production in the UK has been based on natural resources of [[fossil fuels]]. This means that UK has not been as active in exploitation of renewable resources. Compared to many other Member States, the UK is starting from a very low level of renewable energy consumption and thus the challenge of meeting the 2020 targets is even greater.

The Renewable Energy Directive (2009) sets a target for the UK to achieve 15% of its energy consumption from renewable sources by 2020. This compares to only 1.5% in 2005. There has been a small increase in renewable energy use in recent years; there must be a much greater level of deployment over the next decade in order to meet the target.

The share of RES heat in 2005 was 0,48 ktoe and will increase up to 6,2 Mtoe. The share will increase from 0,7% to 12%.  Bioenergy in 2020 will still have the biggest share of RES heat and the amount would be 3,6 Mtoe with a seven-fold increase.
The consumption of RES electricity was 2005 1,5 TWh and the share 4,7%.The target for RES electricity for 2020 is 116 TWh. This means a several times increase. The biggest share will come from wind (78 TWh and capacity 2800 MW). The bioelectricity would be 20,6 TWh and from biogas 5,6 TWh. The increase for biomass would be five-fold and for biogas 120%.

The RES in traffic sector was in 2005 0,188 Mtoe and the increase would be really massive, up to 4,5 Mtoe, in 2020. The share would increase from 0,2% to 10,17%. The consumption of ethanol use would be 1,7 Mtoe and biodiesel use would be 2,5 Mtoe.

A '''windpump''' is a type of [[windmill]] which is used for pumping water.

[[File:Molendeolifant.jpg|thumb|[[De Olifant, Burdaard|De Olifant]] at [[Burdaard]], [[Friesland]]]]
Windpumps were used to pump water since at least the 9th century in what is now [[Afghanistan]], [[Iran]] and [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |first=Adam |last=Lucas |year=2006 |title=Wind, Water, Work: Ancient and Medieval Milling Technology |publisher=Brill Publishers |isbn=90-04-14649-0 |page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of wind pumps became widespread across the [[Muslim world]] and later spread to [[China]] and [[Indian subcontinent|India]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Donald Routledge Hill]], "Mechanical Engineering in the Medieval Near East", ''Scientific American'', May 1991, p. 64-69. (cf. [[Donald Routledge Hill]], [http://home.swipnet.se/islam/articles/HistoryofSciences.htm Mechanical Engineering])&lt;/ref&gt; Windmills were later used extensively in Europe, particularly in the [[Netherlands]] and the [[East Anglia]] area of [[Great Britain]], from the late [[Middle Ages]] onwards, to drain land for agricultural or building purposes.

[[Simon Stevin]]'s work in the ''waterstaet'' involved improvements to the [[sluice]]s and [[spillway]]s to control [[flood]]ing. [[Windmill]]s were already in use to pump the water out, but in ''Van de Molens'' (''On mills''), he suggested improvements, including the idea that the wheels should move slowly, and a better system for meshing of the [[gear teeth]]. These improvements increased the efficiency of the windmills used to pump water out of the [[polder]]s by three times.&lt;ref&gt;The Story of Science: Power, Proof &amp; Passion - EP4: Can We Have Unlimited Power?&lt;/ref&gt; He received a [[patent]] on his innovation in 1586.&lt;ref name=isis/&gt;

Eight- to ten-bladed windmills were used in the [[Region of Murcia]], [[Spain]], to raise water for irrigation purposes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.yachtmollymawk.com/2008/11/spanish-water-works/ Water-lifting mills in the [[Region of Murcia]], [[Spain]]&lt;/ref&gt; The drive from the windmill's rotor was led down through the tower and back out through the wall to turn a large wheel known as a ''[[noria]]''. The ''noria'' supported a bucket chain which dangled down into the well. The buckets were traditionally made of wood or clay. These windmills remained in use until the 1950s, and many of the towers are still standing.

Early immigrants to the [[New World]] brought with them the technology of windmills from Europe.&lt;ref name="Brief History"&gt;[http://www.windmillersgazette.com/history.html "Brief History of Windmills in the New World"]&lt;/ref&gt; On US farms, particularly on the [[Great Plains]], wind pumps were used to pump water from farm wells for cattle. In California and some other states, the windmill was part of a self-contained domestic water system, including a hand-dug well and a redwood water tower supporting a redwood tank and enclosed by redwood siding ([[tankhouse]]). The self-regulating farm wind pump was invented by [[Daniel Halladay]] in 1854.&lt;ref name="Brief History" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/it/2003/2/2003_2_56.shtml americanheritage.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fnal.gov/pub/ferminews/ferminews03-02-14/p4.html fnal.gov]&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, steel blades and steel towers replaced wooden construction, and at their peak in 1930, an estimated 600,000 units were in use, with capacity equivalent to 150 megawatts.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Gipe, ''Wind Energy Comes of Age'', John Wiley and Sons, 1995  {{ISBN|0-471-10924-X}}, pages 123-127&lt;/ref&gt; Very large lighter wind pumps in Australia directly crank the pump with the rotor of the windmill. Extra back gearing between small rotors for high wind areas and the pump crank prevents trying to push the pump rods down on the downstroke faster than they can fall by gravity.  Otherwise pumping too fast leads to the pump rods buckling, making the seal of the stuffing box leak and wearing through the wall of the rising main (UK) or the drop-pipe (US) so all output is lost.

The multi-bladed wind pump or wind [[turbine]] atop a lattice tower made of wood or steel hence became, for many years, a fixture of the landscape throughout rural America. These mills, made by a variety of manufacturers, featured a large number of blades so that they would turn slowly with considerable [[torque]] in moderate winds and be self-regulating in high winds.  A tower-top [[Transmission (mechanics)|gearbox]] and [[crankshaft]] converted the rotary motion into reciprocating strokes carried downward through a rod to the pump cylinder below. Today, rising energy costs and improved pumping technology are increasing interest in the use of this once declining technology.

==Worldwide use==
[[File:Wicken Fen Windpump.jpg|thumb|A working wooden windpump on [[The Fens]] in [[Cambridgeshire]], UK]]
The [[Netherlands]] is well known for its windmills.  Most of these iconic structures situated along the edge of [[polders]] are actually windpumps, designed to drain the land.  These are particularly important as much of the country lies below [[sea level]].

In the UK, the term ''windpump'' is rarely used, and they are better known as ''drainage windmills''. Many of these were built in [[The Broads]] and [[The Fens]] of [[East Anglia]] for the draining of land, but most of them have since been replaced by [[diesel fuel|diesel]] or electric powered pumps. Many of the original windmills still stand in a derelict state although some have been restored.

Windpumps are used extensively in [[Southern Africa]], Australia, and on farms and ranches in the central plains and Southwest of the United States. In South Africa and Namibia thousands of windpumps are still operating. These are mostly used to provide water for human use as well as drinking water for large sheep stocks.

[[Kenya]] has also benefited from the African development of windpump technologies. At the end of the 1970s, the UK [[NGO]] [[Intermediate Technology Development Group]] provided engineering support to the Kenyan company Bobs Harries Engineering Ltd for the development of the Kijito windpumps. Bobs Harries Engineering Ltd is still manufacturing the Kijito windpumps, and more than 300 of them are operating in the whole of [[East Africa]].

In many parts of the world, a [[rope pump]] is being used in conjunction with wind turbines. This easy-to- construct pump works by pulling a knotted rope through a pipe (usually a simple PVC pipe) causing the water to be pulled up into the pipe. This type of pump has become common in [[Nicaragua]] and other places.

==Construction==
To construct a windpump, the bladed rotor needs to be matched to the pump. With non-electric windpumps, high [[Blade solidity|solidity]] rotors are best used in conjunction with positive displacement (piston) pumps, because single-acting piston pumps need about three times as much torque to start them as to keep them going. Low solidity rotors, on the other hand, are best used with [[centrifugal pump]]s, [[waterladder pump]]s and chain and washer pumps, where the torque needed by the pump for starting is less than that needed for running at design speed. Low solidity rotors are best used if they are intended to drive an electricity generator; which in turn can drive the pump.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/docrep/010/ah810e/AH810E10.htm Water lifting devices; matching bladed rotors to pumps]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Multi-bladed windpumps==
[[File:Wind-powered-agricultural-pump-1.jpg|thumb|Wind powered water pump on Oak Park Farm, Shedd, Oregon.]]
Multi-bladed wind pumps can be found worldwide and are manufactured in the United States, Argentina, China, New Zealand, and South Africa. A 16&amp;nbsp;ft (4.8&amp;nbsp;m) diameter wind pump can lift up to 1600 US gallons (about 6.4 metric tons) of water per hour to an elevation of 100&amp;nbsp;ft with a 15 to 20&amp;nbsp;mph wind (24–32&amp;nbsp;km/h).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ironmanwindmill.com Iron Man Windmill Website pumping capacity calculator], retrieved January 15, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; However they take a strong wind to start so they turn over the crank of the piston pump. Wind pumps require little maintenance—usually only a change of gear box oil annually.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aermotorwindmill.com/Sales/CommonQuestions.asp Aermotor Web site frequently asked questions], retrieved Sept. 17, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; An estimated 60,000 wind pumps are still in use in the United States. They are particularly attractive for use at remote sites where electric power is not available and maintenance is difficult to provide.

A common multi-bladed windpump usefully pumps with about 4%–8% of the annual windpower passing through the area it sweeps&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy03osti/30361.pdf Argaw, N.,"Renewable Energy for Water Pumping Applications in Rural Villages",2003, NREL Report 30361, page 27]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cprl.ars.usda.gov/REMM%20Pubs/1997%20Performance%20and%20Economic%20Comparison%20of%20a%20Mechanical%20Windmill%20to%20a%20Wind-Electric%20Water%20Pumping%20System.pdf Brian Vick, Nolan Clark "Performance and Economic Comparison of a Mechanical Windmill to Wind-Electric Water Pumping System", 1997, USDA-Agricultural Research Service, see Figure-2]&lt;/ref&gt;  This lower conversion is due to poor load matching between wind rotors and fixed-stroke piston pumps.

==Fundamental problems of multi-bladed windpumps==

===Inefficient rotor===
[[File:Derelict windpump with water tank in the foreground next to the Boorowa railway in Galong NSW Australia.JPG|thumb|Derelict water tank with windmill in the background]]
The main design feature of a multi-bladed rotor is "high starting torque", which is necessary for cranking a piston pump operation. Once started a multi-bladed rotor runs at too high a tipspeed ratio at less than its best efficiency of 30%  .&lt;ref name="Hau 2005, page 101"&gt;Hau, Erich "Wind Turbines", 2005, page 101, Fig.5-10&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, modern wind rotors can operate at an aerodynamic efficiency of more than 40% at higher tipspeed ratio for a smaller swirl added and wasted to the wind.&lt;ref name="Hau 2005, page 101"/&gt; But they would need a highly variable stroke mechanism rather than just a crank to piston pump.

===Poor load matching===

A multi-bladed windmill is a mechanical device with a piston pump. Because a piston pump has a fixed stroke, the energy demand of this type of pump is proportional to pump speed only. On the other hand, the energy supply of a wind rotor is proportional to the cube of wind speed. Because of that, a wind rotor runs at over speed (more speed than needed), yielding a loss of aerodynamic efficiency.

A variable stroke would match the rotor speed according to wind speed, functioning like a "variable-speed generator".  The flow rate of variable stroke windpump can be increased two times, compared to fixed stroke windpumps at the same wind speed.&lt;ref name="ena.com.tr"&gt;[http://www.ena.com.tr/Wind90.pdf Clark, Nolan "Variable Stroke Pumping for Mechanical Windmills", 1990, AWEA Proceedings]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cyclic torque variation===

A piston pump has a very light   suction phase,  but the upstroke is heavy and puts a big backtorque on a starting rotor when the crank is horizontal and ascending.   A counterweight on the crank up in the tower and yawing with the wind direction can at least spread the torque to the crank descent.

==Development of improved windpumps==

Although multi-bladed windpumps are based on proven technology and are widely used, they have the fundamental problems mentioned above and need a practical variable stroke mechanism .

===USDA experiments at Texas===
Between 1988 and 1990, a variable stroke windpump was tested at the USDA-Agriculture Research Center-Texas, based on two patented designs (Don E. Avery Patent #4.392.785, 1983 and Elmo G. Harris Patent #617.877, 1899).&lt;ref name="ena.com.tr"/&gt; Control systems of the variable stroke wind pumps were mechanical and hydraulic; however, those experiments did not attract the attention of any windpump manufacturer. After experiments with this variable stroke windpump, research focused on wind-electric water pumping systems; no commercial variable stroke windpump exists yet.

===Fluttering windpumps===

Fluttering windpumps have been developed in Canada with a  pump stroke varying strongly with amplitude to absorb all the variable power in the wind and to stop the uniblade from swinging too far beyond horizontal from its vertical mean position. They are much lighter and use less material than multiblade windpumps and can pump effectively in lighter wind regimes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.econologica.org&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6zIj7LCtX0U&lt;/ref&gt;

===Turkish experiments===
A Turkish engineer re-designed the variable stroke windpump technology by using modern electronic control equipment. Research began in 2004, with governmental R&amp;D support. The first commercial new generation variable stroke wind pumps have been designed after ten years of R&amp;D. The 30&amp;nbsp;kW variable stroke windpump design includes a Darrieus-type modern wind rotor, counterbalance and regenerative brake technology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ena.com.tr/english.htm ENA Yelkapan Technologies Ltd.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Combinations==

===''Tjasker''===
{{Main article|tjasker}}
[[File:Tjasker Sanpoel 04.JPG|thumb|The ''tjasker'']]
In the [[Netherlands]], the ''tjasker'' is a drainage mill with [[windmill sail#Common sails|common sails]] connected to an [[Archimedean screw]]. This is used for pumping water in areas where only a small lift is required. The windshaft sits on a tripod which allows it to pivot. The Archimedean screw lifts water into a collecting ring, where it is drawn off into a ditch at a higher level, thus draining the land.&lt;ref name=Tjasker&gt;{{cite web|url=http://odur.let.rug.nl/polders/boekje/types.htm|title=The types of windmills|publisher=Odur|accessdate=2008-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thai windpumps===
In Thailand, windpumps are traditionally built on Chinese windpump designs. These pumps are constructed from wire-braced bamboo poles carrying fabric or bamboo-mat sails; a paddle pump or [[waterladder pump]] is fixed to a [[Thai bladed rotor]]. They are mainly used in [[Salt pan (evaporation)|salt pans]] where the water lift required is typically less than 1 meter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smulders|first=P.T.|date=January 1996|title=Wind water pumping: the forgotten option|journal=[[Energy for Sustainable Development]]|volume=11|issue=5|url=http://www.energieautark.at/cms/dmdocuments/WindwaterpumpingAfrica.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Yogo sapphires''' are a variety of [[corundum]] found only in Yogo Gulch, part of the [[Little Belt Mountains]] in [[Judith Basin County, Montana|Judith Basin County]], [[Montana]], [[United States]], on land once inhabited by the [[Piegan Blackfeet]] people. Yogos are typically [[cornflower blue]], a result of trace amounts of [[iron]] and [[titanium]]. They have high uniform clarity and maintain their brilliance under artificial light. Because Yogo sapphires occur within a vertically [[strike and dip|dipping]] [[geological resistance|resistive]] [[igneous]] [[Dike (geology)|dike]], mining efforts have been sporadic and rarely profitable. It is estimated that at least 28&amp;nbsp;million carats ({{convert|5.6|t|abbr=on|disp=or}}) of Yogos are still in the ground. Jewelry containing Yogos was given to First Ladies [[Florence Harding]] and [[Bess Truman]]; in addition, many gems were sold in Europe, though promoters' claims that Yogos are in the [[crown jewels]] of England or the engagement ring of [[Diana, Princess of Wales|Princess Diana]] are dubious. Today, several Yogo sapphires are part of the [[Smithsonian Institution|Smithsonian Institution's]] gem collection.

Yogo sapphires were not initially recognized or valued.  Gold was discovered at Yogo Creek in 1866, and though "blue pebbles" were noticed alongside gold in the stream [[alluvium]] by 1878, it was not until 1894 that the "blue pebbles" were recognized as sapphires. Sapphire mining began in 1895 after a local rancher named Jake Hoover sent a cigar box of gems he had collected to an assay office, which in turn sent them to [[Tiffany's]] in New York, where an appraiser pronounced them "the finest precious gemstones ever found in the United States".{{sfn|Voynick|1985|pp=29–31}} Hoover then purchased the original [[mother lode]] from a sheepherder, later selling it to other investors.  This became the highly profitable "English Mine", which flourished from 1899 until the 1920s. A second operation, the "American Mine", was owned by a series of investors in the western section of the Yogo dike, but was less profitable and bought out by the syndicate that owned the English Mine. In 1984, a third set of claims, known as the Vortex mine, opened.

The term "Yogo sapphire" is the preferred wording for gems found in the Yogo Gulch, whereas "Montana sapphire" generally refers to gems found in other Montana locations. More gem-quality sapphires are produced in Montana than anywhere else in North America. Sapphires were first discovered in Montana in 1865, in alluvium along the [[Missouri River]]. Finds in other locations in the western half of the state occurred in 1889, 1892, and 1894. The Rock Creek location, near [[Phillipsburg, Montana|Phillipsburg]], is the most productive site in Montana, and its gems inspired the name of the nearby [[Sapphire Mountains]]. In 1969, the sapphire was co-designated along with the [[agate]] as Montana's [[state gemstone]]s.

In the early 1980s, Intergem Limited, which controlled most of the Yogo sapphire mining at the time, rocked the gem world by marketing Yogos as the world's only guaranteed "untreated" sapphire, exposing a practice of the time wherein 95 percent of all the world's sapphires were heat-treated to enhance their natural color. Although Intergem went out of business, the gems it mined appeared on the market through the 1990s because the company had paid its salesmen in sapphires during its financial demise. [[Citibank]] had obtained a large stock of Yogos as a result of Intergem's collapse, and after keeping them in a vault for nearly a decade, sold its collection in 1994 to a Montana jeweler. Mining activity today is largely confined to hobby miners in the area; the major mines are currently inactive.

Yogo Gulch and the corresponding natural features of Yogo Peak ({{convert|8625|ft|m}}), Yogo Creek, and the Yogo dike, where the gems are mined, are all in the [[Little Belt Mountains]] within Judith Basin County.{{r|Weed 1900}}{{sfn|Voynick|1985|pp=xii, 116}} The Gulch is located along the lower reaches of Yogo Creek and west of the [[Judith River]].

=== Etymology ===
Because Yogo Gulch lies in a region historically inhabited by the [[Piegan Blackfeet]] people, promoters of Yogo sapphires claim that ''yogo'' may mean "romance" or "blue sky" in the [[Blackfoot language]],{{r|bluesky|russell11}} although there is little evidence to support this claim.{{efn|No word closely resembling "yogo" appears in modern Blackfoot language dictionaries with any meaning close to the popular speculation of Yogo promoters. The Blackfoot word for the concept of courtship or wooing is ''isawaanopaat'', the word for the color blue is ''ótssko'', and the word for skyward is ''sspóóhtsi'' {{harv|Frantz|Russell|2000|pp=304, 286, and 402}}.}} Other meanings for ''yogo'' have been suggested, including "[[AWOL#Absence without leave|Going over the hill]]".{{sfn|Voynick|1985|pp=10–11}} The meaning of the word "Yogo" had been lost by 1878, when [[Placer deposit|placer]] gold was found in Yogo Creek. Thus, its true meaning is uncertain.{{r|bluesky|russell11}}

Sapphires are a color variety of [[corundum]], a crystalline form of [[aluminium oxide]] ({{chem|Al|2|O|3}}).{{sfn|Voynick|1985|pp=ix–xi}} Corundum is one of the hardest minerals, rating&amp;nbsp;9 on the [[Mohs scale of mineral hardness|Mohs scale]].{{r|gemm}} Corundum gems of most colors are called sapphires, except for red ones, which are called [[ruby|rubies]].{{r|utex}} The term "Yogo sapphire" refers only to sapphires from the Yogo Gulch.{{sfn|Voynick|1985|pp=6–8}}  The cornflower blue color of the Yogo results from trace amounts of [[iron]] and [[titanium]].{{r|bluesky}} Yogo sapphires are unique in that they are free of cavities and [[Inclusion (mineral)|inclusions]], have high uniform clarity, lack [[Gemstone#Value|color zoning]], and do not need heat treating because their cornflower blue coloring is uniform and deep.{{r|Kane 2003}} Unlike Asian sapphires, they maintain their brilliance in artificial light.{{sfn|Voynick|1985|pp=31–32}} Yogos present an advantage to gemcutters:{{sfn|Voynick|1985|pp=62–63}} since they are found as primary constituent minerals within an [[igneous]] [[bedrock]] rather than in sedimentary [[alluvium|alluvial]] deposits where most other sapphires are located,{{r|Weed 1900}}{{r|Kane 2003}} they retain a perfect or near perfect crystalline shape, making cutting much easier, as does their lack of inclusions, color zoning, or cloudiness.{{sfn|Voynick|1985|pp=62–63}} Yogos also exhibit a triangular pattern on the basal plane of the flattened crystals,{{r|trigon}} with thin [[Trigonal crystal system|rhombohedral]] crystal faces, a feature absent in sapphires from other parts of Montana.{{r|O'Donoghue 2006|Kunz 1897|Pratt 1897}}
&lt;!-- These rhombohedrons are almost always less than {{convert|1|mm|in|abbr=on|sigfig=1}} in thickness and appear like striations.{{r|Pratt 1897}}&amp;nbsp;... commented out as rather meaningless without detailed crystallographic explanation and illustrations --&gt;

Yogos tend to be beautiful, small, and very expensive.{{r|ethics}} The [[United States Geological Survey]] and many gem experts have stated that Yogos are "among the world's finest sapphires."{{r|usgs}} The roughs tend to be small and flat, so cut Yogo gems heavier than {{convert|2|carat|g}} are rare.{{r|usgs}} Only about 10&amp;nbsp;percent of cut pieces are over {{convert|1|carat|g}}.{{r|Kane 2003}} The largest recorded Yogo rough, found in 1910, weighed {{convert|19|carat|g}} and was cut into an {{convert|8|carat|g|adj=on}} gem.{{r|usgs}} The largest cut Yogo is {{convert|10.2|carat|g|adj=on}}.{{r|bluesky|distinctly}}{{sfn|Voynick|1985|p=204}} Because of the rarity of large rough Yogo sapphires, Yogo gem prices begin rising sharply when they are over {{convert|0.5|carat|g}}, and skyrocket when they are over {{convert|1|carat|g}}.{{r|O'Donoghue 2006|ethics|distinctly}}

Montana sapphires in general come in a variety of colors,{{r|utex|Kane 2003|Kunz 1897}} but Yogos are almost always blue.{{r|distinctly}} About two percent of Yogos are purple,{{r|Kane 2003}} due to trace amounts of [[chromium]].{{r|Gauthier 1995|circa}} A very small number of rubies have been found at Yogo Gulch.{{r|Gauthier 1995}}

Yogo sapphires were first discovered in alluvial streambed sediments during [[gold mining]] operations in Yogo Gulch downstream from the Yogo dike, but were later traced to their source within igneous bedrock.{{r|Harlan}}  Worldwide, other than the Yogo Gulch deposit and one small site in the [[Kashmir]] region, most other corundum is mined from the sand and gravel created by the weathering of [[metamorphic rock]]. Alluvial sapphires are found in the Far East, Australia, and in three other Montana locations—the upper [[Missouri River]], [[Rock Creek (Montana)|Rock Creek]], and [[Dry Cottonwood Creek (Deer Lodge County, Montana)|Dry Cottonwood Creek]].{{sfn|Voynick|1985|pp=19–21}}{{r|gemgallerymtloc}} The location of most Yogo sapphires within igneous rock rather than from alluvial placer deposits requires difficult hard rock mining.{{sfn|Voynick|1985|pp=viii, 2–3}}  Coupled with American labor costs, this makes their extraction fairly expensive.{{r|utex|O'Donoghue 2006|Pirsson 1897}} At least {{convert|28000000|carat|kg}} are estimated to still be in the ground.{{r|utex|usgs1908}} The Yogo dike is "the only known igneous rock from which sapphire is mined".{{r|Meyer}}

The sapphire bearing Yogo dike is a dark gray to green [[intrusive rock]] known as a [[lamprophyre]]. The lamprophyre is an unusual igneous rock that contains a low content of [[silica]]. The rock has a [[porphyritic]] texture with large crystals of [[orthopyroxene]] and [[phlogopite]] set in a fine grained [[Matrix (geology)|matrix]]. The phlogopite crystals have been used to determine the age of the dike and its crystallization temperature (900&amp;nbsp;°C (1,650&amp;nbsp;°F)). The dike also contains fragments of other rock types. These [[xenolith]]s include pieces of limestone, [[clastic]] [[sedimentary rock]]s, and [[gneiss]]. In some locations, due to the abundance of xenoliths, the dike has the appearance of a limestone [[breccia]] in an igneous matrix.{{r|Harlan}} One gneiss fragment found as a xenolith contains corundum. The Yogo sapphires themselves are rimmed with a reaction layer of [[spinel]] and are etched, indicating that the sapphires were not in [[chemical equilibrium]] with their host, the lamprophyre magma. This suggests the sapphire crystals may have originated in an earlier rock, such as a corundum-bearing gneiss, later assimilated by the lamprophyre magma at depth.{{r|Harlan|Meyer}} Earlier investigators had assumed that the sapphire had crystallized from the magma with the necessary high aluminium content provided by assimilation of clay rich [[shale]]s of the [[Proterozoic]] [[Belt Supergroup]] sediments which are known to be present at depth in the region.{{r|Pirsson 1897}}

[[File:PurpleY6Br.jpg|thumb|left|A {{convert|0.37|carat|g|adj=on}} brilliant cut purple Yogo sapphire. Only about two percent of Yogo sapphires are purple.]]
The Yogo dike is a narrow subvertical sheet-like igneous body. It varies from {{convert|2|to|26|ft|m}} thick and extends for {{convert|5|mi|km}}, [[strike and dip|striking]] at an azimuth of 255°. The dike is broken into three offset [[en echelon veins|en echelon]] segments,{{r|Harlan}} and dates to 48.6&amp;nbsp;[[Mya (unit)#Symbols y and yr|mya]] using [[Argon–argon dating|Ar dating]] on phlogopite. The dike intrudes [[Mississippian age]] (360 to 325&amp;nbsp;mya) limestone and other sedimentary rocks of the [[Madison Group|Madison]] and [[Big Snowy Group]]s.{{r|Harlan}}

There has been considerable debate over the years as to the depth of the Yogo dike and how many ounces of rough sapphires per ton it contains. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Delmer L. Brown, a [[geological engineer]] and gemologist, conducted the most thorough scientific exploration up to that time, concluding that the dike was at least {{convert|7000|ft|m}} deep and that the concentration of rough sapphires was not constant throughout the deposit.{{sfn|Voynick|1985|pp=151–158}} Brown found that the dike had intruded into a pre-existing [[Fault (geology)|fault]] that had been a conduit for groundwater circulation. The overlying shale, the [[Kibbey Formation]], was deposited on an [[unconformity]], an ancient Mississippian-age [[karst]] [[erosion surface]],{{r|USGS1979}} and was not intruded by the dike.{{sfn|Voynick|1985|pp=151–158}} This groundwater action produced collapsed zones which were intruded by the dike to form breccia zones. Recent erosion in the area removed the overlying shales and again exposed the limestone to groundwater action which produced collapse breccias which include fragments of the dike rock. He determined that the erosion of the dike in the current erosion cycle was minimal.{{sfn|Voynick|1985|pp=151–158}}

Brown also showed that the unique characteristics of the Yogo sapphires are related to their geological history. Most sapphires are formed under low pressure and temperature over geologically short periods of time, and this is why most non-Yogo sapphires have imperfections and inconsistent coloring.{{sfn|Voynick|1985|pp=151–158}} Yogos show crystalline formation under very high temperatures and pressures corresponding to a great depth, over geologically long periods of time.{{sfn|Voynick|1985|pp=151–158}} &lt;!-- As sapphires are heavier than magma, the smaller roughs rose closer to the surface,{{sfn|Voynick|1985|pp=151–158}} which was later confirmed by subsequent mining at the English Mine. //If you mean that sapphires are denser than magma, they would sink? Is this talking about [[Cumulate texture]]? Statement verfied per Voynick ref, not cumulate texture but likely marginal as near the "top" of the dike, the wording bothered me too, VSmith--&gt; Brown also showed that distribution of gem rough through the dike was not consistent, so using an average "ounces per ton" was misleading. For example, the section which, despite several ownership and name changes over the years, is generally known as the "American Mine," was developed in an area dominated by post-dike breccia with significantly lower ounces per ton than the English Mine.{{sfn|Voynick|1985|pp=151–158}}

== Montana sapphires ==

[[File:LgYellowSapphire.jpg|thumb|right|An uncut/rough yellow sapphire found at the Spokane Sapphire Mine near Helena, Montana]]
"Yogo sapphire" is the preferred term for gems found in the Yogo Gulch, whereas "Montana sapphire" generally refers to gems found in other Montana locations.{{r|Kane 2003}}  More gem-quality sapphires are produced in Montana than anywhere else in North America.{{r|Kane 2003}} Montana sapphires come in a variety of colors, though rubies are rare.{{r|utex|Kane 2003|Kunz 1897}}

The first sapphires found in the United States were discovered on May&amp;nbsp;5, 1865, along the Missouri River, about {{convert|14|mi|km}} east of [[Helena, Montana|Helena]], in [[Lewis and Clark County, Montana|Lewis and Clark County]], by Ed "Sapphire" Collins.{{sfn|Voynick|1985|pp=6–8}}{{r|Kane 2003}} Collins sent the sapphires to [[Tiffany's]] in New York City, and to Amsterdam for evaluation;{{r|Clabaugh bulletin}} however, those sapphires were of poor coloring and low overall quality, garnering little notice and giving Montana sapphires a poor reputation.{{r|edcollins}}  Corundum was also found at Dry Cottonwood Creek near [[Butte, Montana|Butte]] in 1889, Rock Creek near [[Philipsburg, Montana|Philipsburg]] in 1892, and Quartz Gulch near [[Bozeman, Montana|Bozeman]] in 1894.{{r|Kane 2003}}{{sfn|Voynick|1985|pp=19–21}}{{r|mtkids}} By 1890, the English-owned Sapphire and Ruby Mining Company had bought several thousand acres of land where Montana sapphires were found, but the venture failed after a few years because of fraudulent practices by the owners.{{sfn|Voynick|1985|pp=16–19}}

Sapphires from these three sites are routinely heat-treated to enhance color.{{r|Kane 2003}} While millions of carats of sapphires have been mined from the Missouri River deposits, there has been little commercial activity there since the 1990s because of the high cost of recovery and environmental concerns. Production at Dry Cottonwood Creek has been sporadic and low-yielding. The Rock Creek area, also known as Gem Mountain, continues to be the most productive site in Montana, even more so than Yogo Gulch, producing over {{convert|190000000|carat|g}} of sapphires since its inception in 1906.{{r|Kane 2003}} Other than Yogo, Montana sapphire mines have been less successful because they have few blue sapphires and non-blue sapphires have low profit margins.{{r|mtdeq}}{{sfn|Voynick|1985|pp=76–78}}

These gems inspired the names of features: the mountains near Rock Creek are known as the [[Sapphire Mountains]]. [[Garnet]]s are also found at some Montana sapphire sites, inspiring the name of the [[Garnet Range]], which lies to the north of the Sapphire Mountains.{{r|garnet}} In 1969, the sapphire and [[agate]] were jointly declared Montana's two official [[List of U.S. state minerals, rocks, stones and gemstones|state gemstones]].{{r|mtkids|mtlaw}}

[[File:A Quiet Day In Utica - CMRussell.jpg|thumb|''A Quiet Day In Utica'' by [[Charles Marion Russell|C.M. Russell]]|300px]]

Mining of Yogo sapphires was exceptionally difficult and remains sporadic today. Even so, Yogo sapphire mining turned out to be more valuable than several gold strikes.{{sfn|Voynick|1985|pp=viii, 2–3}}  The Yogo area also produced small amounts of silver, copper, and iron.{{r|mtdeq}}

Yogo Gulch lies in a region originally inhabited by the Piegan Blackfeet people.{{r|bluesky|russell11}} Gold was first discovered at Yogo Creek in 1866, but the small numbers of early prospectors were driven off by local [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]].{{sfn|Voynick|1985|pp=10–11}}{{r|mtdeq}} During a [[Gold Rush]] in 1878, about a thousand miners came to Yogo Creek, which was one of the gold-bearing streams in Montana not yet actively mined.  "Blue pebbles" were noted along with small quantities of gold. The mining camp at Yogo City only flourished for roughly three years,{{sfn|Voynick|1985|pp=10–11}} and eventually the population dwindled to only a few people.{{sfn|Voynick|1985|pp=10–11}}

Yogo City was briefly known as Hoover City,{{r|taliaferrohoover}} after Jake Hoover. Hoover was part of a partnership that had been [[placer mining]] for gold and is credited as the discoverer of Yogo Sapphires.{{r|mtdeq}} For several years, he also owned a ranch in nearby Pig-Eye Basin. He later prospected for gold in [[Alaska]] and was a deep-sea fishing guide in [[Seattle]] before eventually returning to the Judith Basin.{{r|mtdeq}}{{sfn|Voynick|1985|pp=109–112}}  Western painter [[Charles Marion Russell|C.M. Russell]] arrived in the area in 1880 as a young cowhand and was hired by Hoover.{{r|artmt}} Russell stated that he learned most of his frontier skills from Hoover,{{r|mtkids}}{{sfn|Voynick|1985|pp=22–30}} and the two men remained lifelong friends.{{r|artmt}} Millie Ringold, a former slave born in 1845,{{sfn|Voynick|1985|p=21}} settled in [[Fort Benton, Montana]] after having worked as a nurse and servant for an army general. When gold was discovered at Yogo Creek, Ringold sold her boarding house in Fort Benton and left for the Yogo gold fields, setting up a hotel, restaurant, and saloon in Yogo City where she sang and played music.{{sfn|Voynick|1985|p=21}} Ringold later cooked for the English mine, but also worked her own gold claims, even after gold mining was on the decline.{{sfn|Voynick|1985|pp=71–73}} She was known as a superb cook and ultimately died in Yogo City in 1906, the last resident of the community.{{sfn|Voynick|1985|p=21}}{{r|millie}}  The nearby town of Utica was featured in Russell's 1907 painting ''A Quiet Day In Utica'',{{sfn|Voynick|1985|pp=27–30, 110–113}}{{r|srm}} which was originally known as ''Tinning a Dog''. Hoover, Ringold, store owner Charles Lehman, and Russell himself are all depicted in the painting, placed between the hitching post and door of the general store.{{r|srm|cmrussell|twm}}

In 1894, the "blue pebbles" were recognized as sapphires.{{sfn|Voynick|1985|pp=31–32}}{{r|Harlan}}  One story credits a local school teacher for recognizing the blue pebbles as sapphires.{{r|Russell Country, Yogo Gulch}} A variation is that the teacher lived in Maine, but was a friend of a local miner, who had mailed her a small box with some gold and a few "blue pebbles" in it.{{r|mtdeq}} Another story credits a miner named S.S. Hobson for surmising that the blue stones might be sapphires, and his guess was confirmed by a jeweler in Helena.{{r|mtdeq}}  Ultimately, in 1895, Jake Hoover sent a cigar box containing those he had collected while mining gold to an assay office, which in turn sent them via regular, uninsured mail to Tiffany's in New York City for appraisal by Dr. [[George Frederick Kunz]],{{r|Kane 2003}} the leading American gemologist of the time.{{sfn|Voynick|1985|pp=3–4, 29–31}} Impressed by their quality and color, Kunz pronounced them "the finest precious gemstones ever found in the United States".{{sfn|Voynick|1985|pp=29–31}} Tiffany's sent Hoover a check for $3,750 (approximately ${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|3750|1895|r=-2}} }} as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}),{{r|bigsky}} along with a letter that described the blue pebbles as "sapphires of unusual quality".{{r|Harlan}}

=== Early mining ===
Yogos were ultimately traced from the alluvium to their source.{{r|Harlan}} In February&amp;nbsp;1896, a sheepherder named Jim Ettien found the sapphire [[mother lode]]: the Yogo dike.{{r|trigon|bigsky}}{{sfn|Voynick|1985|pp=32–35}}  Ettien was prospecting for gold, and found sapphires after washing gravel he found in a fissure within a limestone outcrop.{{r|mtdeq}} Ettien staked two claims. The vein turned out to be {{convert|5|mi|0}} long and several other miners promptly staked claims along it.{{r|mtdeq}} Ettien sold his claims to Hoover;{{r|trigon|bigsky}}{{sfn|Voynick|1985|pp=32–35}} Hoover in turn sold his interest in eight original mining stakes, known as the "New Mine Sapphire Syndicate", to his two partners for $5,000 (approximately ${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|5000|1896|r=-4}}}} as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}).{{r|usgs1908}} This site was {{convert|5|mi|0}} from Yogo City.{{sfn|Voynick|1985|pp=71–73}} In 1899, Johnson, Walker and Tolhurst, Ltd. of London purchased the New Mine Sapphire Syndicate for $100,000 (approximately ${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|0.1|1899|r=1}} }} million as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}). At that point, the operation became unofficially known as the "English Mine".{{sfn|Voynick|1985|pp=36–42}}

On July&amp;nbsp;4, 1896, two other Americans, John Burke and Pat Sweeney, staked six mining claims on the western portion of the Yogo dike—areas Hoover had deemed unfit for mining. These claims were collectively known as the "Fourth of July Claim", and became known as the "American Mine". In 1904, the mine was bought by the American Gem Syndicate, and it sold in 1907 to the American Sapphire Company.{{sfn|Voynick|1985|pp=74–76}}

One of the Englishmen who came to the area was Charles Gadsden of [[Berkhamsted]], [[Hertfordshire]]. By 1902, Gadsden was promoted to resident supervisor of the English Mine, and he quickly turned its focus from gold to sapphires.{{sfn|Voynick|1985|pp=71–73}} Gadsden's security measures were very tight, as weight-for-weight, rough sapphires were and continue to be  worth much more than gold.{{sfn|Voynick|1985|pp=80–81}} The English Mine flourished until the 1920s,{{r|bigsky}}{{sfn|Voynick|1985|pp=36–42}} but floods on July&amp;nbsp;26, 1923, so severely damaged the mines that they never fully recovered.{{sfn|Voynick|1985|pp=102–109}} Between the aftermath of flooding and hard economic times, the English Mine finally failed in 1929.{{sfn|Voynick|1985|pp=102–109}} It had recovered more than {{convert|16|e6carat|t}} of rough sapphires that produced {{convert|2.5|e6carat|kg}} of finished gems valued at $25&amp;nbsp;million in 1929 dollars (approximately ${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|25|1929|r=-1}} }} million as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}).{{r|utex|Kane 2003}} A series of other firms mined sapphires there, but with marginal success.{{r|mtdeq|bigsky}}{{sfn|Voynick|1985|pp=36–42}} For much of the 1930s and 1940s Gadsden worked the mine alone and used his own money to pay its property taxes.{{sfn|Voynick|1985|pp=117–122}}  He remained caretaker of the mines until shortly before his death on March&amp;nbsp;11, 1954.{{sfn|Voynick|1985|pp=122–130}}

The American Mine operations were less profitable than those of the English Mine. While the English Mine used superior mining and management techniques on a richer lode, the American Mine suffered from insufficient space and lack of water for ore weathering. Roughs from the English Mine were shipped to London and sold in Europe, often with claims they were sapphires from the Far East, while the American Mine had difficulty marketing its gems within the United States. The American Sapphire Company, which used local [[gemcutter]]s from [[Great Falls, Montana|Great Falls]], went bankrupt in 1909; a new firm, the Yogo American Sapphire Company, bought the American Mine, but was bankrupt by 1913. Gadsden and his wife had convinced the New Mine Sapphire Syndicate to buy out the Yogo American Sapphire Company in 1914, and in doing so, the English syndicate gained control of all known Yogo deposits.  They quickly recouped the purchase price by washing the [[tailings]] left behind by previous operators of the American Mine.{{sfn|Voynick|1985|pp=57–64}}{{sfn|Voynick|1985|pp=75–77, 95–96}}

=== 1940s–1970s ===
[[File:YogoMine1897P456.jpg|thumb|Mine shaft in Yogo Gulch, 1897]]
Montana sapphires were heavily mined during {{nowrap|[[World War II]]}} for industrial abrasive and cutting purposes. However, because the Yogo mines were still owned by the English, the United States government could not control those operations, so the mines were little affected by the war, even though industrial sapphires were critical to the war effort.{{sfn|Voynick|1985|pp=122–130}} The Yogo Sapphire Mining Corporation of [[Billings, Montana]], was the next company to try to run the English Mine. They made an initial offer in 1946, and reached a deal by 1949. However, the purchase was not complete until 1956 because of legal issues. The sale was finally completed for $65,000 cash and some stock considerations because the company's capital was exhausted, similar to previous Yogo ventures. The Yogo Sapphire Mining Corporation then changed its name to be the same as the former English firm's name: New Mine Sapphire Syndicate. It became informally known as the "American Syndicate" to distinguish it from the previous "English Syndicate". Production was poor and mining ceased in September 1959.{{sfn|Voynick|1985|pp=125–134}} From 1959 to 1963, the mine itself was left unattended and unsecured, resulting in hobbyists, picnickers, and [[Amateur geology|rockhounds]]' coming from all over the US and Canada to gather loose rough sapphires. The American Syndicate took action to stop this in 1963, with fences and threats of prosecution.{{sfn|Voynick|1985|pp=134–135}} The American Syndicate then tried leasing the mine to several operators. One of these was Siskon, Inc. of Nevada, which lost a significant amount of money.{{sfn|Voynick|1985|pp=136–138}} They sued, and in May 1965 the Montana Supreme Court ruled in Siskon's favor.&lt;ref&gt;Siskon Corp v. New Mine Sapphire Syndicate, 145 Mont. 346, 400 P. 2d 867 (1965)&lt;/ref&gt; Siskon bought the mine at a sheriff's sale and in turn leased it to a group headed by Arnold Baron, who had a background in gemcutting and jewelry. Baron organized German and [[Thai people|Thai]] gemcutters and had success in marketing Yogos in America—the first such success in 50 years. However, owing to the difficulty in mining the hard rock site, he did not exercise his option to buy the mine, and Siskon sold it in August 1968 to Herman Yaras of [[Oxnard, California]], for $585,000.{{sfn|Voynick|1985|pp=136–138}}

[[File:YogoDikeP420.jpg|thumb|150px|left|The sapphire-bearing dike on right side of photo, c. 1900]]
In 1969, Yaras' Sapphire Village, Inc. created the Sapphire Village, a nearby homesite development offering buyers limited mining rights to gather their own sapphires with hand tools. Having done no significant mining or marketing, Sapphire Village, Inc. sold in 1973 to one of its investors, Chikara Kunisaki, a celery farmer from Oxnard, California. Kunisaki renamed the business Sapphire International Corporation and attempted to create a commercial mining operation. He built a modern {{convert|3000|ft|m|adj=on}} tunnel at the site of the old American Mine, named the "Kunisaki Tunnel". But operation costs were so high that Sapphire International Corporation shut down in late 1976.{{sfn|Voynick|1985|pp=138–144}} This was the last actual attempt to mine the American Mine section of the Yogo dike, and today, only the locked portal to the tunnel still exists.{{sfn|Voynick|1985|p=207}}

In January 1977, Victor di&amp;nbsp;Suvero and his firm Sapphire-Yogo Mines became the next owner to tackle the Yogo dike. Di&amp;nbsp;Suvero was a native-born Italian who grew up in [[Tientsin, China]], and had been successful with a [[jade]] mine in California. Di&amp;nbsp;Suvero's expertise was in marketing: he formed a company called Sapphire Trading to cut and market the Yogos. He had novel marketing ideas but was not knowledgeable about the mining side of the business. Unable to make payments, his venture folded in late 1979.{{sfn|Voynick|1985|pp=144–150}}

By 1980, only four American owners had been successful at Yogo Gulch, all early in its mining history.{{sfn|Voynick|1985|pp=144–150}} The English syndicate had been the most profitable of any venture, and even that venture was short-lived.{{sfn|Voynick|1985|pp=36–42}}  At least thirteen American-owned Yogo mining efforts had failed. Besides inherent difficulties with financing and the challenges of hard rock mining, the American owners generally did not understand how to effectively market the gems.{{sfn|Voynick|1985|pp=144–150}}

=== 1980s and beyond ===
Kunisaki put his mine up for sale, asking $6&amp;nbsp;million to recoup his expenses. Even though mine profits had been poor over the decades, prices of precious gems were very high at the time due to the worldwide oil crises of the 1970s and early 1980s. Four individuals or groups seriously considered Kunisaki's offer.{{sfn|Voynick|1985|pp=151–154, 158–164}} Relying heavily upon Delmer Brown's expertise, Harry C. Bullock and J. R. Edington formed the limited partnership American Yogo Sapphire Limited, becoming the 14th American company to work the Yogo dike. Bullock and Brown had Yogo mine experience, as they had worked with di&amp;nbsp;Suvero. Bullock's plan included mining, cutting, making jewelry, and marketing—the whole spectrum of the business. They paid the $6&amp;nbsp;million asked by Kunisaki and then raised another $7.2&amp;nbsp;million in funding by October 1981. Brown located quality gemcutters in Thailand, and set up the American Yogo Sapphire Company there. Brown also set up a thorough, computerized security system that tracked gems from the mine to the gemcutters.{{sfn|Voynick|1985|pp=151–154, 158–164}} Bigger roughs were sent to American cutters, specialty cuts were done in Germany, a few cuts were done in Hong Kong, and the vast majority were done in Thailand.{{sfn|Voynick|1985|pp=158–159}} American Yogo Sapphire Limited secured a $5&amp;nbsp;million line of credit with [[Citibank]]. Desiring a more modern name, American Yogo Sapphire Limited changed its name to Intergem Limited in early 1982. Intergem marketed the Yogo as the "Royal American Sapphire." Their first line of jewelry appeared in mid-1982, first marketed regionally in the American west and later at the national level. Intergem also developed a system of authorized dealers,{{sfn|Voynick|1985|pp=151–154, 158–164}} and found success in its first four years, with sales over $3&amp;nbsp;million in 1984 alone.{{sfn|Voynick|1985|pp=181–187}}
[[File:Thai Gem Cutting.jpg|thumb|left|Gemcutting in [[Thailand]]]]

Intergem rocked the gem trade by marketing the Yogo as the world's only guaranteed untreated sapphire. By 1982, the practice of routinely heat treating gems had become a major issue in the industry.{{sfn|Voynick|1985|pp=151–154, 158–164}} At the time, 95&amp;nbsp;percent of all the world's sapphires were being heated to enhance their natural color. Thai traders had even purchased large quantities of naturally colorless Sri Lankan sapphires, known as [[geuda]], and heated them to an artificial blue.{{sfn|Voynick|1985|pp=165–181}} A problem with the practice was that heated gems often fade over time, though trained gemologists can detect a heated gem with 95&amp;nbsp;percent accuracy. Intergem's marketing of guaranteed untreated Yogos set them against many in the gem industry.{{sfn|Voynick|1985|pp=165–181}}{{r|richards}} In 1985 there was a movement in Pennsylvania to require disclosure that a gem had been treated. Intergem's strategy resulted in large numbers of gem professionals visiting Yogo Gulch.{{sfn|Voynick|1985|pp=181–187}}

Intergem began planning to dig even deeper into the Yogo dike, which held more known reserves than all the world's other known sapphire deposits combined, albeit deep underground rather than near the surface in the manner of the other known deposits.{{sfn|Voynick|1985|pp=185–191}}  They also set up a washing plant and maintenance sheds at the site of the former American mine.{{sfn|Voynick|1985|p=207}} Intergem had made a $1.5&amp;nbsp;million down payment and agreed to make semi-annual payments to Kunisaki's Sapphire International Corporation, which had been renamed to Roncor. Intergem also had loan and interest payments on the $7.2&amp;nbsp;million loan to make to Citibank. While the company's sales were steadily increasing, their profits were still too low and in May 1985 they missed a $250,000 payment to Roncor. Simultaneously, their collateral of gems, held by Citibank, declined because the value of their collateral was declining; as a result, Citibank called in its loan. Intergem had over $1&amp;nbsp;million in sales lined up for the 1985 Christmas season, but could only fill a tiny portion because they did not have enough operating capital to manufacture the Yogo jewelry. In mid-1986, Roncor regained full ownership even though Intergem had sold loose gems and jewelry worth millions of dollars.{{sfn|Voynick|1985|pp=185–191}}

Various companies attempted to lease the mine from Roncor, but in the meantime, two local couples, Lanny and Joy Perry and Chuck and Marie Ridgeway, discovered a new site at Yogo Gulch in January 1984 by following a trail to an unused section of the dike that had previously been deemed unsuitable. They began mining the site and named it the "Vortex Mine", forming a company named Vortex Mining. The mine shaft was {{convert|280|ft|m}} deep and contained two Yogo ore-bearing veins.{{sfn|Voynick|1985|pp=193–195}} The portion of the dike they had mined was an extension of the main dike.{{sfn|Voynick|1985|pp=196–198}} The Vortex Mine, renamed Yogo Creek Mining,{{r|Kane 2003}} was successful for years but eventually declined and closed in 2004.{{sfn|Voynick|1985|pp=196–198}}

[[File:Point-19 carat diamond cut blue Yogo sapphireCROP.jpg|thumb|A {{convert|0.19|carat|g|adj=on}} diamond cut cornflower blue Yogo sapphire]]
In 1992, Roncor found an {{convert|11|carat|g|adj=on}} rough.{{sfn|Voynick|1985|pp=196–198}} AMAX Exploration, operating as the Yogo Sapphire Project, signed a 22-month lease with Roncor in March&amp;nbsp;1993 and had some success in the middle and eastern portions of the dike; it decided not to continue after the end of its lease due to the cost of underground mining, depletion of easily accessible Yogos, and the relatively small size of Yogos then easily accessible. During this time, additional dikes were found in the area using [[geophysics|geophysical]] [[magnetometer]] surveys. Low-grade sapphire rough was found in the Eastern Flats Dike, a parallel dike some 500&amp;nbsp;feet northeast of the main dike.{{sfn|Voynick|1985|pp=198–201}} Pacific Cascade Sapphires, a Canadian company, had a mining lease with Roncor in 2000 and 2001 but ran out of funds and their option expired. By this time, most of the easily accessible Yogos had been mined and miners had to dig deeper, further increasing costs.{{r|Kane 2003}}

In 1995, Intergem's stock of gems began to reappear on the market because the company had paid its salesmen in sapphires during its financial demise. After Intergem collapsed, many of its salesmen continued to sell Yogos, especially after AMAX ceased operations. Citibank also had obtained a large stock of Yogos, reputedly worth $3.5&amp;nbsp;million (approximately ${{formatnum:{{inflation|US|3500000|1985|r=-2}} }} as of {{CURRENTYEAR}}), as a result of Intergem's collapse: {{convert|200000|carat|g}} of rough, {{convert|22000|carat|g}} of cut gems, and 2,000 pieces of jewelry, all of which sat in the bank's vaults until 1991 when Sofus Michelsen, director of the Center for Gemstone Evaluation and creator of the ''Michelsen Gemstone Index'', became interested.{{sfn|Voynick|1985|pp=200–203}} In 1992, he and Jim Adair, a [[Missoula, Montana]], jeweler who is the world's largest retailer of Yogos, got together, and by October&amp;nbsp;1994 Adair had purchased Citibank's four sealed bags of Yogo material. However, only one of the bags was truly valuable. Adair and Michelsen designed custom cutting techniques for Yogos.{{sfn|Voynick|1985|pp=201–207}}

A new owner, Michael Duane Roberts, bought the Vortex Mine in 2008. Its operations were designed to be environmentally friendly, using methods such as recycling all water and not using other chemicals.{{r|distinctly}} Roberts died in a mining accident in 2012.{{r|Greatfalls}} {{as of|2011}}, there was also mining activity by individual hobby miners on small parcels at Sapphire Village, but the Roncor mines remained inactive.{{r|usgs}}  In 2017, Vortex Mines was sold to Don Baide who plans to continue operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Higgs|first1=Levi|title=How Montana Gold Rushers Literally Threw Away a Fortune in Sapphires|url=https://www.thedailybeast.com/how-montana-gold-rushers-literally-threw-away-a-fortune-in-sapphires|accessdate=17 January 2018|work=[[The Daily Beast]]|date=12 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several Yogo sapphires are kept at the [[Smithsonian Institution]]. The earliest donations were noted in the museum's annual report on June 30, 1899, when the institution reported that Dr. L. T. Chamberlain gave them two cut Yogos and 21 other sapphires for their Dr. [[Isaac Lea]] gem and mineral collection.{{r|lea}} The record-setting {{convert|10.2|carat|g|adj=on}} cut Yogo is also held by the Smithsonian.{{r|bluesky|distinctly}}{{sfn|Voynick|1985|p=204}} In 2006, gemologist Robert Kane of Fine Gems International in Helena, which has the world's largest selection of Montana sapphires, donated 333 Montana sapphires, weighing a total of {{convert|27.07|carat|g}}, to the [[National Museum of Natural History#Hall of Geology, Gems, and Minerals|Smithsonian's Gem and Mineral Collection]], along with 98.48&amp;nbsp;grams of 18K yellow gold for the creation of a piece of jewelry.{{r|conchita2|conchita3}} A representative of the Smithsonian asked Paula Crevoshay, a jewelry designer from [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]], to create a piece of finished jewelry from these gems.{{r|conchita1|conchita3}} Crevoshay felt that a butterfly motif would best represent America's natural beauty, honor her mother's love of butterflies, and display the wide range of colors found in Montana sapphires. Crevoshay named the brooch "Conchita" in honor of her mother; it is also referred to as the "Sapphire Butterfly Brooch", "Conchita Sapphire Butterfly", and the "Montana Butterfly Brooch". Two of the sapphires used are [[cabochon]] cut and the rest are brilliant cut.{{r|conchita1}} The majority are from the Rock Creek deposit. The largest one, however, is a blue Yogo used for the butterfly's head. Other sapphires used included yellow, purple, pink, and orange gems. Crevoshay completed the brooch in 2007; she and Kane presented the finished brooch to Smithsonian curator Jeffrey Post on May 7, 2007, in Washington, DC.{{r|conchita1}}{{r|conchita4}}

In the earliest years of Yogo sapphire mining, before Yogos achieved their own reputation, Oriental sapphires were sold in Montana with claims they were Yogos, while in Europe, Yogos were sold as Oriental sapphires.{{sfn|Voynick|1985|pp=61–62}} However, Yogos became notable in their own right. [[Paulding Farnham]] (1859–1927) used Yogos in several jewelry pieces he designed for the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|1900 Exposition Universelle]] in Paris,{{r|zapata}} where Yogo sapphires received a silver medal among all gems for color and clarity.{{sfn|Voynick|1985|pp=57–58}} An entry of uncut loose Yogo sapphires also won a bronze medal at the [[Louisiana Purchase Exposition|1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri]].{{sfn|Voynick|1985|p=93}} Farnham was the creator of the most elaborate piece of jewelry ever made with Yogos, the life-size Tiffany Iris Brooch, a brooch ornament, which contains 120 Yogo sapphires set in platinum,{{sfn|Voynick|1985|pp=114–115, 204}} and sold on March 17, 1900, for $6,906.84.{{r|farnham}} In 1923, [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]] [[Florence Harding]] was given an "all Montana" ring made from a Yogo sapphire and Montana gold. In 1952, Gadsden gave cut Yogos to [[Harry Truman|President Harry Truman]], his wife [[Bess Truman|Bess]], and their daughter [[Margaret Truman|Margaret]].{{sfn|Voynick|1985|p=204}} Many Yogos were also sold in Europe, as some Yogo mining was conducted by British interests.{{r|distinctly}} Yogos may have been in the personal collections of some members of the British royal family in the 1910s,{{r|distinctly}} but promotional claims that Yogos are in any of the crown jewels of England cannot be conclusively proven or disproven.{{r|distinctly|mtkids|rockmt}} Claims that the gem in the engagement ring of [[Diana, Princess of Wales|Lady Diana Spencer]] and [[Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge|Kate Middleton]] is a Yogo are dubious; the gem is thought to be of Sri Lankan origin.{{r|crown}} The story that the gem is a Yogo can be traced to a 1984 ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' article that described the ring as a {{convert|9|carat|g|adj=on}} sapphire, and quoted Intergem president Dennis Brown's claim that the gem may have come from a British-owned Yogo mine.{{r|Sanko February 3, 1984}}

The '''Zhoushan Island Overhead Powerline Tie''' is a 220 kV three-phase AC interconnection of the power grid of [[Zhoushan Island]] with that of the Chinese mainland. It runs over several islands and consists of several long distance spans, the longest with a length of {{Convert|2.7|km|mi|1}} south of Damao Island. This span uses two {{Convert|370|m|ft|adj=mid|-tall}} pylons, which are the tallest electricity pylons in the world. The north tower on Damao Island ({{zh|大猫岛}}, ''{{transl|zh|dà māo dǎo}}'') was completed in 2009, and the south tower on Liangmao Island ({{zh|凉帽岛}}, ''{{transl|zh| liángmào dǎo}}'') was completed in 2010.  These pylons resemble those of the [[Pylons of Messina|Messina Strait]], but are steel-tube lattice structures.
