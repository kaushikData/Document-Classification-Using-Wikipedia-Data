The '''Asia Power Sapugaskanda Power Station''' (also sometimes referred to as '''Asia Power Station''') is a {{Nowrap|51 [[Megawatt|MW]]}} thermal [[power station]] in [[Sapugaskanda]], [[Sri Lanka]]. Planning for the [[fuel oil]]-run power station dated back to 1994, when the [[Ceylon Electricity Board]] issued a tender for an [[Independent Power Producer|IPP]] project for 50 megawatts. Construction of the plant began in 1996 and was commissioned in June 1998, with a [[Power purchase agreement|PPA]] of 20-years. The power station utilizes eight {{Nowrap|[[Deutz AG|Deutz]] 16V BVM 640}} generating units.&lt;ref name=BWSC&gt;{{cite web|title=Sapugaskanda Power Plant|url=http://www.bwsc.com/Sapugaskanda-Power-Plant--Sri-Lanka.aspx?ID=214|publisher=BWSC.com|accessdate=7 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Austral Líneas Aéreas Flight 901''' crashed in a river near [[Buenos Aires]] after succumbing to a thunderstorm. All 31 people on the [[BAC 1-11]] were killed in the accident.

==Accident sequence==
The flight took off for [[Buenos Aires]] at 9:11 local time. The flight was uneventful until final approach. At 10:42, the flight was cleared to land at [[Runway]] 13 of [[Aeroparque Jorge Newbery]]. Visibility was reducing, and eventually the pilots lost sight of the runway and aborted the landing. The flight then conducted a [[go-around]] and started its second approach. When approaching the NDB, the flight was cleared to hold at 600 metres due to a [[cumulonimbus cloud]] ahead. They were then cleared for a straight-in approach to Runway 31. Shortly after, the crew lost control of the plane and it crashed into a river. All 26 passengers and five crew were killed in the disaster.&lt;ref name="aviation-safety1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aviation-safety.net/database/record.php?id=19810507-0 |title=ASN Aircraft accident BAC One-Eleven 529FR LV-LOX Buenos Aires-Jorge Newbery Airport, BA (AEP) |publisher=Aviation-safety.net |date=1981-05-07 |accessdate=2013-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dwyer |first=Jeremy |url=http://www.nycaviation.com/2011/05/on-this-day-in-aviation-history-may-7 |title=On This Day in Aviation History: May 7th at NYCAviation |publisher=Nycaviation.com |date=2011-05-07 |accessdate=2013-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigation==
Investigations were hampered by the fact that only 55-65% of wreckage was recovered and after 42 days of searching, the [[cockpit voice recorder]] and the [[flight data recorder]] were not recovered. The final investigation report blamed the pilots for underestimating the intensity of the storm.&lt;ref name="aviation-safety1"/&gt;

'''Beach nourishment''' (also referred to as '''beach renourishment''',&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Supreme Court Case ''[[Stop the Beach Renourishment v. Florida Department of Environmental Protection]]'' refers to the practice as ''beach renourishment'' rather than ''beach nourishment''.&lt;/ref&gt; '''beach replenishment''', or '''sand replenishment''') describes a process by which [[sediment]], usually [[sand]], lost through [[longshore drift]] or [[erosion]] is replaced from other sources. A wider beach can reduce storm damage to coastal structures by dissipating energy across the [[surf zone]], protecting upland structures and [[infrastructure]] from [[storm surge]]s, [[tsunami]]s and unusually high [[tide]]s.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} Beach nourishment is typically part of a larger [[coastal management|coastal defense]] scheme. Nourishment is typically a repetitive process since it does not remove the physical forces that cause erosion but simply mitigates their effects.

The first nourishment project in the United States was at [[Coney Island]], [[New York (state)|New York]] in 1922 and 1923. It is now a common shore protection measure used by public and private entities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Farley |first1=P.P.|last2= |first2= |year=1923 |title=Coney Island public beach and boardwalk improvements.

== Shoreline protection ==
[[File:Beach nourishment slide3 pic1 (USGS).jpg|frame|Before and after photos of beach restoration efforts, [[Florida]] coastline]]

Nourishment is one of three commonly accepted methods for protecting shorelines. The ''structural'' alternative involves constructing a [[seawall]], [[revetment]], [[groyne]] or [[breakwater (structure)|breakwater]]. Alternatively, with ''managed retreat'' the shoreline is left to erode, while relocating buildings and infrastructure further inland. ''Nourishment'' gained popularity because it preserved beach resources and avoided the negative effects of hard structures. Instead, nourishment creates a “soft” (i.e., non-permanent) structure by creating a larger sand reservoir, pushing the shoreline seaward.

==Causes of erosion==
Beaches can erode both naturally and due to human impacts ([[beach theft]]/[[sand mining]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=auU3AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PR319&amp;dq=beaches+can+erode+both+naturally+and+due+to+human+impacts&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjd8uCshYnVAhVD72MKHZYcC88Q6AEIKTAB#v=onepage&amp;q=beaches%20can%20erode%20both%20naturally%20and%20due%20to%20human%20impacts&amp;f=false|title=Central and Western Planning Areas, Gulf of Mexico Sales 147 and 150 [TX, LA, MS, AL]: Environmental Impact Statement|date=1993|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Erosion is a natural response to storm activity. During storms, sand from the visible beach [[Submersion (coastal management)|submerges]] to form sand bars that protect the beach. Submersion is only part of the cycle. During calm weather smaller waves return sand from bars to the visible beach surface in a process called [[Accretion (coastal management)|accretion]].

Some beaches do not have enough sand available to coastal processes to respond naturally to storms. When not enough sand is available, the beach cannot recover following storms.

Many areas of high erosion are due to human activities. Reasons can include: [[seawall]]s locking up [[sand dunes]], coastal structures like ports and harbors that prevent [[longshore transport]], [[dam]]s and other river management structures. Continuous, long-term renourishment efforts, especially in cuspate-cape coastlines, can play a role in longshore transport inhibition and downdrift erosion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ells|first=Kenneth|last2=Murray|first2=A. Brad|date=2012-10-16|title=Long-term, non-local coastline responses to local shoreline stabilization|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2012GL052627/abstract|journal=Geophysical Research Letters|language=en|volume=39|issue=19|pages=L19401|doi=10.1029/2012GL052627|issn=1944-8007|bibcode=2012GeoRL..3919401E}}&lt;/ref&gt; These activities interfere with the natural sediment flows either through [[dam]] construction (thereby reducing riverine sediment sources) or construction of littoral barriers such as [[jetty|jetties]], or by deepening of inlets; thus preventing longshore transport of sediment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Basco, David|author2=Bellomo, Douglas|author3=Hazelton, John|author4=Jones, Bryan|title=The influence of seawalls on subaerial beach volumes with receding shorelines|journal=Coastal Engineering|date=1997|volume=30|pages=203–233|doi=10.1016/S0378-3839(96)00044-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Visible and submerged sand===
The proportion of total sand in a beach that lies below the waterline (submersion fraction) critically impacts beach nourishment. Two beaches with the same amount of visible sand may be much different below the surface. An eroded beach with substantial submerged sand surrounding it may recover without nourishment. Nourishing a beach that has little submerged sand requires understanding of the reason that the submerged sand is missing. The same forces that stripped the submerged sand once are likely to do so again. The amount of submerged sand eroded is typically much greater than the amount of missing sand on shore. Replacing only the visible sand is insufficient unless the submerged sand is also replaced. Otherwise, the beach is unstable and the replenished sand quickly erodes. If human activity is a major cause of the erosion, mitigating that activity may be more cost effective over both short and long term periods than direct nourishment. {{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

==Requirements for effective nourishment==
Sand fill must be compatible with native beach sand.

===Profile Nourishment===
''Beach Profile Nourishment'' describes programs that nourish the full beach profile. In this instance, "profile" means the slope of the uneroded beach from above the water out to sea. The [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]] profile nourishment program placed 75% of its total sand volume below low water level. Some coastal authorities ''overnourish'' the below water beach (aka "nearshore nourishment") so that over time the natural beach increases in size. These approaches do not permanently protect beaches eroded by human activity, which requires that activity to be mitigated.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

===Replenishment material===
The selection of suitable material for a particular project depends upon the design needs, environmental factors and transport costs, considering both short and long-term implications.&lt;ref name=nrc97&gt;{{cite report|author=National Research Council |year=1995 |title=Beach Nourishment and Protection |publisher=National Academy press|location=Washington, D.C. |pp=97-99, Table 4-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important material characteristic is the sediment grain size, which must closely match the native material. Excess silt and clay fraction (mud) versus the natural turbidity in the nourishment area disqualifies some materials. Projects with unmatched grain sizes performed relatively poorly. Nourishment sand that is only slightly smaller than native sand can result in significantly narrower equilibrated dry beach widths compared to sand the same size as (or larger than) native sand. Evaluating material fit requires a sand survey that usually includes geophysical profiles and surface and core samples.&lt;ref name=nrc97/&gt;

Some beaches were nourished using a [[sand|finer sand]] than the original. [[Thermoluminescence]] monitoring reveals that storms can erode such beaches far more quickly. This was observed at a [[Waikiki]] nourishment project in [[Hawaii]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://state.hi.us/dlnr/occl/files/Waikiki/summary.pdf Waikiki replenishment]{{dead link|date=October 2016|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Considerations ==
'''Advantages:'''

*Widens the beach.
*Protects structures behind beach.

'''Disadvantages:'''

*Added sand may erode, because of storms or lack of up-drift sand sources.
*Expensive and requires repeated application.
*Restricted access during nourishment.
*Destroy/bury marine life.
*Difficulty finding sufficiently similar materials.

==Environmental issues==
Beach nourishment has significant impacts on local ecosystems. Nourishment may cause direct mortality to [[sessility (zoology)|sessile]] organisms in the target area by burying them under the new sand. Seafloor habitat in both source and target areas are disrupted, e.g., when sand is deposited on coral reefs or when deposited sand hardens. Imported sand may differ in character (chemical makeup, grain size, non-native species) from that of the target environment. Light availability may be reduced, affecting nearby reefs and [[submerged aquatic vegetation]]. Imported sand may contain material toxic to local species. Removing material from near-shore environments may destabilize the shoreline, in part by steepening its submerged slope. Related attempts to reduce future erosion may provide a false sense of security that increases development pressure.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

===Sea turtles===
Newly deposited sand can harden and complicate nest-digging for turtles. However, nourishment can provide more/better habitat for them, as well as for sea birds and beach flora. Florida addressed the concern that dredge pipes would suck turtles into the pumps by adding a special grill to the dredge pipes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stormingmedia.us/69/6983/A698382.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629153848/http://www.stormingmedia.us/69/6983/A698382.html |archivedate=2011-06-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternatives/complements to nourishment==
Nourishment is not the only technique used to address eroding beaches. Others can be used singly or in combination with nourishment, driven by economic, environmental and political considerations.

Human activities such as dam construction can interfere with natural sediment flows (thereby reducing riverine sediment sources.) Construction of littoral barriers such as jetties and deepening of inlets can prevent longshore sediment transport.

===Structural===
The structural approach attempts to prevent erosion. Armoring involves building  [[revetment]]s, [[seawall]]s, detached [[Breakwater (structure)|breakwaters]], [[groyne|groins]], etc. Structures that run parallel to the shore (seawalls or revetments) prevent [[erosion]]. While this protects structures, it doesn't protect the beach that is outside the wall. The beach generally disappears over a period that ranges from months to decades.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

Groynes and breakwaters that run perpendicular to the shore protect it from erosion. Filling a breakwater with imported sand can stop the breakwater from trapping sand from the [[littoral]] stream (the ocean running along the shore.)  Otherwise the breakwater may deprive downstream beaches of sand and accelerate erosion there.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

Armoring may restrict beach/ocean access, enhance erosion of adjacent shorelines, and requires long-term maintenance.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

===Managed retreat===
[[Managed retreat]] moves structures and other infrastructure inland as the shoreline erodes. Retreat is more often chosen in areas of rapid erosion and in the presence of little or obsolete development.

===Recruitment===
Appropriately constructed and sited fences can capture blowing sand, building/restoring sand dunes, and progressively protecting the beach from the wind, and the shore from blowing sand.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

===Beach dewatering===
All beaches grow and shrink depending on tides, precipitation, wind, waves and current. Wet beaches tend to lose sand. Waves infiltrate dry beaches easily and deposit sandy sediment. Generally a beach is wet during falling tide, because the sea sinks faster than the beach drains. As a result, most erosion happens during falling tide. Beach drainage (beach dewatering) using Pressure Equalizing Modules (PEMs) allow the beach to drain more effectively during falling tide. Fewer hours of wet beach translate to less erosion. [[Permeability (earth sciences)|Permeable]] PEM tubes inserted vertically into the foreshore connect the different layers of [[groundwater]]. The groundwater enters the PEM tube allowing gravity to conduct it to a coarser sand layer, where it can drain more quickly. The PEM modules are placed in a row from the dune to the mean low waterline. Distance between rows is typically {{convert|300|ft|m}} but this is project-specific. PEM systems come in different sizes. Modules connect layers with varying [[hydraulic conductivity]]. Air/water can enter and equalize pressure.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

PEMs are minimially invasive, typically covering approximately 0.00005% of the beach.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} The tubes are below the beach surface, with no visible presence. PEM installations have been installed on beaches in Denmark, Sweden, Malaysia and Florida {{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}. The effectiveness of beach dewatering, however, is debatable and has not been proven convincingly on life-sized beaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pilkey|first=edited by J. Andrew G.

==Costs==
Nourishment is typically a repetitive process, since nourishment mitigates the effects of erosion, but does not remove the causes. A benign environment increases the interval between nourishment projects, reducing costs. Conversely, high erosion rates may render nourishment financially impractical.&lt;ref&gt;''Beach Nourishment and Protection''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.csc.noaa.gov/beachnourishment/html/geo/scitech.htm| title= Beach Nourishment - Coastal Geology - Beach Nourishment: A Guide for Local Government Officials - Beach Nourishment with Emphasis on Geological Characteristics Affecting Project Performance| author= Dean, Robert G.| author2= Davis, Richard A.| author3= Erickson, Karyn M.| last-author-amp= yes| accessdate= 2010-07-04| publisher= [[NOAA Coastal Services Center]]| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100530062257/http://www.csc.noaa.gov/beachnourishment/html/geo/scitech.htm| archivedate= 2010-05-30| deadurl= yes| df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many coastal areas, the economic impacts of a wide beach can be substantial. The {{convert|10|mi|km}}&amp;ndash;long shoreline fronting [[Miami Beach]], Florida was replenished over the period 1976&amp;ndash;1981. The project cost approximately $64,000,000 and revitalized the area's economy. Prior to nourishment, in many places the beach was too narrow to walk along, especially during [[high tide]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

==History==
The first nourishment project in the U.S. was constructed at [[Coney Island]], New York in 1922–1923.&lt;ref&gt;

==Projects==
{{Refimprove section|date=February 2017}}

The setting of a beach nourishment project is key to design and potential performance. Possible settings include a long straight beach, an inlet that may be either natural or modified and a [[pocket beach]]. Rocky or [[seawall]]ed shorelines, that otherwise have no sediment, present unique problems.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

===Cancun, Mexico===
Federal and state governments in [[Mexico]] have invested about $71 million ($957 million pesos) throughout the state of [[Quintana Roo]] in restoring the beaches along [[Cancun]], [[Playa del Carmen]] and [[Cozumel]].

[[Hurricane Wilma]] hit the beaches of Cancun and the [[Riviera Maya]] in 2005. The initial nourishment project was unsuccessful, leading to a second round that began in September 2009 and was scheduled to complete in early 2010. The project designers and the government committed to invest in beach maintenance to address future erosion. Project designers considered factors such as the time of year and sand characteristics such as density. Restoration in Cancun was expected to deliver {{convert|1.3|e9USgal|m3}} of sand to replenish {{convert|450|m|ft|sp=us}} of coastline.

===Northern Gold Coast, Queensland, Australia===
[[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]] beaches in [[Queensland]], [[Australia]] have experienced periods of severe erosion. In 1967 a series of 11 cyclones removed most of the sand from Gold Coast beaches. The Government of Queensland engaged engineers from [[Delft University]] in the Netherlands to advise them. The 1971 Delft Report outlined a series of works for Gold Coast Beaches, including beach nourishment and an artificial reef. By 2005 most of the recommendations had been implemented.

The Northern Gold Coast Beach Protection Strategy (NGCBPS) was an A$10 million investment. NGCBPS was implemented between 1992 and 1999 and the works were completed between 1999 and 2003. The project included dredging {{convert|3,500,000|m3|cuyd}} of compatible sand from the [[Gold Coast Broadwater]] and delivering it through a pipeline to nourish {{convert|5|km|mi|sp=us}} of beach between [[Surfers Paradise]] and [[Main Beach]]. The new sand was stabilized by an [[artificial reef]] constructed at [[Narrowneck, Queensland|Narrowneck]] out of huge [[geotextile]] sand bags. The new reef was designed to improve wave conditions for surfing. A key monitoring program for the NGCBPS is the ARGUS coastal camera system.

The cost/benefit ratio for NGCBPS was conservatively estimated at 75:1 for a A$10 million investment into beach replenishment. The benefits were estimated from a model of lost visitor nights in hotels following previous erosion events. NGCBPS so improved beach health that recovery following minor and moderate storms occurred within weeks. Additional unquantified benefits included lifestyle benefits for residents, additional public open space and improved fishing, diving and surfing conditions.

===Netherlands===
More than one-quarter of the [[Netherlands]] is below sea level and about 81% of the coast consists of [[sand dune]] or beach. The shoreline is closely monitored by yearly recording of the [[Cross section (geometry)|cross section]] at points {{convert|250|m|ft|sp=us}} apart, to ensure adequate protection. Where long-term erosion is identified, beach nourishment using high-capacity suction dredgers is deployed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Offshore breakwaters and shore evolution control |last=Pilarczyk |first=K.

===Hawaii===
====Waikiki====
Hawaii planned to replenish [[Waikiki]] beach in 2010. Budgeted at $2.5 million, the project covered {{convert|1700|ft|m}} in an attempt to return the beach to its 1985 width. Prior opponents supported this project, because the sand was to come from nearby [[shoal]]s, reopening a blocked channel and leaving the overall local sand volume unchanged, while closely matching the "new" sand to existing materials. The project planned to apply up to {{convert|24000|cuyd}} of sand from deposits located {{convert|1500|to|3000|ft}} offshore at a depth of {{convert|10|to|20|ft}}. The project was larger than the prior recycling effort in 2006-07, which moved {{convert|10,000|cuyd}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

====Maui====
[[Maui, Hawaii]] illustrated the complexities of even small-scale nourishment projects. A project at Sugar Cove transported upland sand to the beach. The sand allegedly was finer than the original sand and contained excess silt that enveloped coral, smothering it and killing the small animals that lived in and around it. As in other projects, on-shore sand availability was limited, forcing consideration of more expensive offshore sources.&lt;ref name=maui&gt;{{Cite news|title=Sand replenishment effort runs aground
|date=July 25, 2010

|publisher=Maui News
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A second project, along Stable Road, that attempted to slow rather than halt erosion, was stopped halfway toward its goal of adding {{convert|10,000|cuyd|m3}} of sand. The beaches had been retreating at a "comparatively fast rate" for half a century. The restoration was complicated by the presence of old seawalls, groins, piles of rocks and other structures.&lt;ref name=maui/&gt;

This project used sand-filled geotextile tube groins that were originally to remain in place for up to 3 years. A pipe was to transport sand from deeper water to the beach. The pipe was anchored by concrete blocks attached by fibre straps. A video showed the blocks bouncing off the coral in the current, killing whatever they touched. In places the straps broke, allowing the pipe to move across the reef, "planing it down". Bad weather exacerbated the damaging movement and killed the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4QBkYIt35oY|title=Maui Reef Taking a Pounding From Sand Dredging Project|first=Kamuela|last=Mawae|date=5 June 2010|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; The smooth, cylindrical geotextile tubes could be difficult to climb over before they were covered by sand.&lt;ref name=maui/&gt;

Supporters claimed that 2010's seasonal summer erosion was less than in prior years, although the beach was narrower after the restoration ended than in 2008. Authorities were studying whether to require the project to remove the groins immediately. Potential alternatives to geotextile tubes for moving sand included floating dredges and/or trucking in sand dredged offshore.&lt;ref name=maui/&gt;

A final consideration was sea level rise and that Maui was sinking under its own weight. Both Maui and [[Hawaii (island)|Hawaii Island]] surround massive mountains ([[Haleakala]], [[Mauna Loa]], and [[Mauna Kea]]) and were expanding a giant [[dimple]] in the ocean floor, some {{convert|30000|ft|m}} below the mountain summits.&lt;ref name=maui/&gt;

=== Florida ===
90 PEMs were Installed in February 2008 at [[Hillsboro Beach, Florida|Hillsboro Beac]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;h. After 18 months the beach had expanded significantly. Most of the PEMs were removed in 2011. Beach volume expanded by 38,500 cubic yards over 3 years compared to an average annual loss of 21,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fsbpa.com/2015TechPresentations/Christensen.pdf|title=Passive Dewatering - A soft way to extend the life of beach nourishments|last=Christensen|first=Kenneth W.|last2=Nettles|first2=Sandy|date=February 6, 2015|website=|publisher=fsbpa.com|access-date=December 2016|last3=Gable|first3=Frank J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hong Kong ===
The beach in [[Hong Kong Gold Coast|Gold Coast]] was built as an artificial beach  in the 1990s with HK$60m. Sands are supplied periodically, especially after typhoons, to keep the beach viable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://the-sun.on.cc/cnt/news/20090722/00410_010.html|title=Sun特搜：泳灘「愚公移沙」康文署倒錢落海 - 太陽報|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Measuring project impact==
[[File:Performance Predicability Beach Nourishment.JPG|thumb|250px|Performance Predicability Beach Nourishment]]

Nourishment projects usually involve physical, environmental and economic objectives.

Typical physical measures include dry beach width/height, post-storm sand volume, post-storm damage avoidance assessments and aqueous sand volume.

Environmental measures include marine life distribution, habitat and population counts.

Economic impacts include recreation, tourism, flood and "disaster" prevention.

Many nourishment projects are advocated via economic impact studies that rely on additional tourist expenditure. This approach is however unsatisfactory. First, nothing proves that these expenditures are incremental (they could shift expenditures from other nearby areas). Second, economic impact does not account for costs and benefits for all economic agents, as [[Cost–benefit analysis|cost benefit analysis]] does.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Massiani|first1=Jérôme|title=How to Value the Benefits of a Recreational Area? A Cost-Benefit Analysis of the Conversion of a Brownfield to a Public Beach in Muggia (Italy)|journal=Review of Economic Analysis|date=2013|volume=5|issue=1|pages=86–102|url=http://www.rofea.org/index.php?journal=journal&amp;page=article&amp;op=view&amp;path%5B%5D=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; Techniques for incorporating nourishment projects into [[flood insurance]] costs and disaster assistance remain controversial.&lt;ref name="nrc4"&gt;National Research Council, 1995. Beach Nourishment and Protection.  National Academy Press, Washington, D.C., 334 p.  pg. 4, 94., Figure 4-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The performance of a beach nourishment project is most predictable for a long, straight shoreline without the complications of inlets or engineered structures.  In addition, predictability is better for overall performance, e.g., average shoreline change, rather than shoreline change at a specific location.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

Nourishment can affect eligibility in the U.S. [[National Flood Insurance Program]] and federal disaster assistance.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

Nourishment may have the unintended consequence of promoting [[Coastal development hazards|coastal development]], which increases risk of other coastal hazards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Armstrong|first=Scott B.|last2=Lazarus|first2=Eli D.|last3=Limber|first3=Patrick W.|last4=Goldstein|first4=Evan B.|last5=Thorpe|first5=Curtis|last6=Ballinger|first6=Rhoda C.|date=2016-12-01|title=Indications of a positive feedback between coastal development and beach nourishment|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2016EF000425/abstract|journal=Earth's Future|language=en|pages=n/a–n/a|doi=10.1002/2016EF000425|issn=2328-4277|bibcode=2016EaFut...4..626A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Beyyurdu Dam''' is a [[gravity dam]] under construction on the Bembo River (an eventual tributary of the [[Great Zab]]) in [[Beyyurdu, Şemdinli]] district of [[Hakkâri Province]], southeast [[Turkey]]. 

==Construction==
Under contract from Turkey's [[State Hydraulic Works]], Özdoğan Group began construction on the dam in 2008 and a completion date has not been announced.&lt;ref name=DSIII/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Beyyurdu-Aslandag Dam |url=http://www.ozdogan.com.tr/?inc=gallery&amp;ID=8&amp;CatID=10 |publisher=Ozodgan |accessdate=2 August 2013 |language=Turkish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516130657/http://www.ozdogan.com.tr/?inc=gallery&amp;ID=8&amp;CatID=10 |archivedate=16 May 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2012 and May 2014 suspected [[Kurdistan Workers' Party]] (PKK) militants set fire to equipment at the construction sites of the Beyyurdu Dam and also the [[Aslandağ Dam]] which is located upstream.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The PKK raided the dam sites on|url=http://www.radikal.com.tr/turkiye/pkk_baraj_santiyesini_basti-1094156|publisher=Radikal|accessdate=2 August 2013|language=Turkish|date=14 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Business machines burned in dam construction on the PKK in Hakkari|url=http://gundem.bugun.com.tr/pkk-hakkaride-baraj-insaatina-saldirdi-haberi/1094512|publisher=Bugun|accessdate=17 January 2015|language=Turkish|date=8 May 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141020211355/http://gundem.bugun.com.tr/pkk-hakkaride-baraj-insaatina-saldirdi-haberi/1094512|archivedate=20 October 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Function==
The reported purpose of the dam is water storage and it can also support a [[hydroelectric]] power station in the future.&lt;ref name=DSIII&gt;{{cite web|title=DSI 10 REGIONAL OFFICE - Van|url=http://www2.dsi.gov.tr/bolge/dsi17/hakkari.htm|publisher=State Hydraulic Works|accessdate=1 August 2013|language=Turkish|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131123060852/http://www2.dsi.gov.tr/bolge/dsi17/hakkari.htm|archivedate=23 November 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another purpose of the dam which has been widely reported in the Turkish press is to reduce the freedom of movement of PKK militants. Blocking and flooding valleys in close proximity to the Iraq–Turkey border is expected to help curb cross-border PKK smuggling and deny caves in which ammunition can be stored. A total of 11 dams along the border; seven in [[Şırnak Province]] and four in Hakkâri Province were implemented for this purpose. In Hakkâri are the Gölgeliyamaç (since cancelled) and [[Çocuktepe Dam]]s on the Güzeldere River and the Aslandağ and Beyyurdu Dams on the Bembo River. In Şırnak there is the [[Silopi Dam]] on the [[Hezil River]] and the [[Şırnak Dam|Şırnak]], [[Uludere Dam|Uludere]], [[Balli Dam|Balli]], [[Kavşaktepe Dam|Kavşaktepe]], [[Musatepe Dam|Musatepe]] and [[Çetintepe Dam]]s on the Ortasu River.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Terror Down|url=http://www.posta.com.tr/turkiye/HaberDetay/Teror-bogulacak.htm?ArticleID=136637|publisher=Posta|accessdate=1 August 2013|language=Turkish|date=24 August 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121025003858/http://www.posta.com.tr/turkiye/HaberDetay/Teror-bogulacak.htm?ArticleID=136637|archivedate=25 October 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Planned to be completed in the second dam on the border against the PKK|url=http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/gundem/19088520.asp|publisher=Hurriyet|accessdate=1 August 2013|language=Turkish|date=26 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dams Prevent Smuggling at the Border|url=http://www.aktifhaber.com/sinirdaki-barajlar-kacakciligi-onleyecek-780919h.htm|publisher=Aktif Haber|accessdate=1 August 2013|language=Turkish|date=5 May 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510001959/http://www.aktifhaber.com/sinirdaki-barajlar-kacakciligi-onleyecek-780919h.htm|archivedate=10 May 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Water retention dams began operation against PKK|url=http://www.cnnturk.com/2012/turkiye/08/23/pkkya.karsi.yapilan.barajlarda.su.tutma.islemi.basladi/674002.0/index.html|publisher=CNNTurk|accessdate=2 August 2013|language=Turkish|date=23 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''CS Energy''' is an Australia-based electricity generating company owned by the [[Government of Queensland]] with its head office located in [[Fortitude Valley]], [[Brisbane]]. The company was established in 1997 and employs more than 400 staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.csenergy.com.au/content-(29)-careers.htm|title = CS Energy: Careers|accessdate = 2016-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company's generation portfolio comprises coal-fired and pumped storage hydroelectric power stations. CS Energy has a trading portfolio of more than 4,035 megawatts in Australia's national electricity market. At present, the company owns and operates [[Kogan Creek Power Station]], [[Wivenhoe Power Station]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csenergy.com.au/content-(17)-power-stations.htm |title=CS Energy Power Stations |accessdate=2011-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Callide Power Station|Callide A and Callide B]], and together with InterGen (in a joint venture, managed by Callide Power Management) 50% of Callide C Power Station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csenergy.com.au/userfiles/CS03%20CALLIDE%20OCT%2020095.pdf |title=Callide Power Station |accessdate=2011-11-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426011007/http://www.csenergy.com.au/userfiles/CS03%20CALLIDE%20OCT%2020095.pdf# |archive-date=2012-04-26 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

CS Energy was awarded [[Australian dollar|A$]]32&amp;nbsp;million in 2010 to help construct Australia's first large-scale [[Solar thermal energy|solar thermal]] project at Kogan Creek Power Station.&lt;ref name="cm"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.couriermail.com.au/business/queensland-solar-power-projects-still-awaiting-go-ahead/story-e6freqmx-1225865626555 |title=Queensland solar projects on power plant shortlist |accessdate=12 May 2010 |date=12 May 2010 |work=[[The Courier-Mail]] |publisher=[[Queensland Newspapers]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Funding was provided by the [[First Rudd Government|Rudd Government]] under the Renewable Energy Demonstration Program. However, in March 2016, it was announced that CS Energy would 'pull the plug' on that project,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://reneweconomy.com.au/cs-energy-pulls-plug-on-worlds-largest-solar-booster-project-16737/|title="CS Energy pulls plug on world’s largest "solar booster" project"|accessdate=14 May 2017|work=RenewEconomy}}&lt;/ref&gt; at a loss of $40M to CS Energy and $6M to ARENA.

In 2007, the [[Chief Executive Officer]], Mark Chatfield, was stood down by the board after allegations of inappropriate share dealings were raised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/news/queensland/cs-energy-ceo-stood-down/2007/05/11/1178390529567.html |title=CS Energy CEO stood down |author= |accessdate=23 May 2010 |date=11 May 2008 |work=[[Brisbane Times]] |publisher=[[Fairfax Digital]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''CALorimetric Electron Telescope''' ('''CALET''') is a [[space telescope]] being mainly used to perform high precision observations of electrons and [[gamma-ray astronomy|gamma ray]]s. It tracks the trajectory of [[electron]]s, [[proton]]s, [[Atomic nucleus|nuclei]], and gamma rays and measures their direction, charge and energy, which may help understand the nature of [[dark matter]] or nearby sources of high-energy particle acceleration.&lt;ref name="Dunn CALET"&gt;{{cite news |last=Dunn |first=Andrea |url=https://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/news/calet |title=Dark Matter and Particle Acceleration in Near Space |work=NASA News |date=9 October 2014 |accessdate=2015-11-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mission was developed and sponsored by the [[Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency]] (JAXA), involving teams from Japan, Italy, and the United States. CALET was launched aboard JAXA's H-II Transfer Vehicle [[Kounotori 5]] (HTV-5) on August 19, 2015, and was placed on the [[International Space Station]]'s Japanese [[Kibo (ISS module)|Kibo module]].

==Overview==

[[File:COSMOS 3D dark matter map.jpg|thumb|3D map of the large-scale distribution of dark matter, reconstructed from measurements of [[weak gravitational lensing]] with the Hubble Space Telescope.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press

}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
CALET is an [[astrophysics]] mission that searches for signatures of [[dark matter]] and provides the highest energy direct measurements of the cosmic ray electron spectrum in order to observe discrete sources of high-energy particle acceleration in our local region of the galaxy.&lt;ref name="CALET at NASA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/research/experiments/1074.html |title=CALorimetric Electron Telescope (CALET) - at NASA |work=Japan Aerospace and Exploration Agency (JAXA) |date=27 August 2015 |accessdate=2015-11-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='JAXA release Oct2015'&gt;[http://global.jaxa.jp/press/2015/10/20151022_calet.htm CALET aboard the ISS Kibo Started the First Direct Electron Observation in Tera Electron Volt Region]. ''JAXA'' Press Release- October 22, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;  The mission was developed and sponsored by the [[Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency]] (JAXA), involving teams from Japan, Italy, and the United States. It seeks to understand the mechanisms of particle acceleration and propagation of [[cosmic ray]]s in the [[Milky Way]] galaxy, to identify their sources of acceleration, their elemental composition as a function of energy, and possibly to unveil the nature of [[dark matter]].&lt;ref name="Dunn CALET"/&gt; Such sources seem to be able to accelerate particles to energies far higher than scientists can achieve on Earth using the largest accelerators. Understanding how nature does this is important to space travel and has possible applications here on Earth.&lt;ref name="Dunn CALET"/&gt; The CALET Principal Investigator is Shoji Torii from the [[Waseda University]], Japan; John Wefel is the co-principal investigator for the US team; Pier S. Marrocchesi, is the co-investigator from the Italy team.

Unlike [[optical telescope]]s, CALET operates in a scanning mode. It records each cosmic ray event that enters its field of view and triggers its detectors to take measurements of the cosmic ray in the extremely high energy region of Tera electron volt (TeV, one trillion electron volts).&lt;ref name='JAXA release Oct2015'/&gt;  These measurements are recorded on the space station and sent to a ground station at [[Louisiana State University]] for analyses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://calet.phys.lsu.edu/ CALET USA]. Louisiana State University (2015).&lt;/ref&gt; CALET may also yield evidence of rare interactions between matter and dark matter by working in synergy with the [[Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer]] (AMS) —also aboard the ISS—  that is looking at [[positron]]s and [[antiproton]]s to identify dark matter.&lt;ref name="Dunn CALET"/&gt; Observation will be carried out for 2–5 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://iss.jaxa.jp/en/kiboexp/ef/calet/ |title=CALorimetric Electron Telescope (CALET): Background |work=Japan Aerospace and Exploration Agency (JAXA) |date=April 24, 2014 |accessdate=2015-11-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

CALET contains a subpayload CIRC (Compact Infrared Camera) to observe Earth surface, to detect forest fires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://circgs.tksc.jaxa.jp/index_e.html |title=Compact Infrared Camera(CIRC) |publisher=JAXA |accessdate=November 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objectives==
The objectives are to understand the following:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |url=http://iss.jaxa.jp/en/kiboexp/ef/calet/ |title=CALorimetric Electron Telescope (CALET): Background |work=Japan Aerospace and Exploration Agency (JAXA) |date=April 24, 2014 |accessdate=2015-11-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
#origin and mechanisms of acceleration of high-energy [[cosmic ray]]s and [[gamma ray]]s
#propagation mechanism of cosmic rays throughout the Galaxy
#identity of [[dark matter]]

As a cosmic ray observatory, CALET aims to clarify high energy space phenomena and dark matter from two perspectives; one is particle creation and annihilation in the field of [[particle physics]] (or nuclear physics) and the other is particle acceleration and propagation in the field of space physics.

The '''Canadian Tornado Alley(s)''' is a term describing a tornado-prone region in Canada. In Canada, the word is rarely used when compared to that of the United States where their "Tornado Alley" is largely a media-driven term.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Tornado_alley|title=Tornado alley - AMS Glossary|website=glossary.ametsoc.org|language=en|access-date=2018-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the official boundaries of the Canadian Tornado Alleys are not clearly defined, its core extends from [[Central Alberta]] through [[Saskatchewan]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140118195234/http://www.usask.ca/water/news-and-events/news/news43.php|title=The new tornado alley - University of Saskatchewan|date=2014-01-18|access-date=2018-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Southern Manitoba]] and [[Northwestern Ontario]]. A second tornado alley extends from [[Michigan]] to [[Central Ontario]] and from Central Ontario to [[Quebec|Southwestern Quebec]]. The [[Canadian Prairies]] are often considered part of the [[Tornado Alley|United States tornado alley]].

== Canadian Tornado Alley geographical area ==
Over the years, the location(s) of the Canadian Tornado Alley(s) have been better defined. No complete definition of Canadian Tornado Alley has ever been officially designated and announced by the [[Environment and Climate Change Canada]] (ECCC). 
[[File:Canadian Tornado Alleys.png|alt=Map of Canadian Tornado Alleys|thumb|Map of Canadian Tornado Alleys]]
According to the [[National Severe Storms Laboratory]] (NSSL) FAQ, "Tornado Alley" is a term used by the media as a reference to areas that have higher numbers of tornadoes. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nssl.noaa.gov/education/svrwx101/tornadoes/faq/|title=Tornado FAQ|website=NOAA National Severe Storms Laboratory|language=EN-US|access-date=2018-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Technically speaking, no province or territory is entirely free of tornadoes; however, they occur more frequently in the [[Central Canada]] and [[Southern Canada]], between the [[Rocky Mountains]] and the [[Great Lakes]] and between the Great Lakes and the [[Saint Lawrence River|St. Lawrence River.]] 

[[Ontario]] reports the most tornadoes of any province due to its large population, in addition to its proximity to Canadian Tornado Alley. [[Saskatchewan]], [[Alberta]] and [[Manitoba]] rank in second place behind Ontario but rank before [[Quebec]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2018-05-06|title=List of tornadoes by province (Canada)|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_tornadoes_by_province_(Canada)&amp;oldid=839959107|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Canadian Tornado Alley can also be defined as an area reaching from the [[Rocky Mountains]] to the St. Lawrence River, excepting [[Northeastern Ontario]].

In the Canadian Tornado Alley in Central/Western Canada, warm, humid air from the United States meets cool, dry air from [[Northern Canada]] and the Rocky Mountains. This creates an ideal environment for severe thunderstorms which could produce tornadoes. In the Great Lakes region towards the St. Lawrence River, severe thunderstorms which could produce tornadoes forms from warm, humid air from the United States and cooler air across the Great Lakes, these are triggered alongside lake-breeze fronts. The amount of precipitation in storms around the Great Lakes is normally more than the [[Canadian Prairies|prairies]] as the warm temperatures and Great Lakes fuel the storms with heavy precipitation right from the lakes. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2018-04-28|title=Tornado Alley|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tornado_Alley&amp;oldid=838709423|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Chrysler Voyager''' or '''Chrysler Grand Voyager''' (since 2011 re-badged as '''Lancia Voyager''' in most of Europe) is a luxury [[minivan]] manufactured by [[Chrysler (division)|Chrysler]]. For most of its existence, vehicles bearing the "Chrysler Voyager" nameplate have been sold exclusively outside the United States, primarily in Europe and [[Mexico]].

The Voyager was introduced in Europe in 1988 as a [[badge engineering|rebadged]] version of the [[Dodge Caravan]] and [[Plymouth Voyager]] sold in the United States, and has evolved with the [[Dodge Caravan|Caravan]], [[Plymouth Voyager]], and [[Chrysler Town &amp; Country]] since. Vehicles bearing the Chrysler Voyager nameplate were marketed in the United States from 2001 to 2003 as a rebadged version of the short-wheelbase (SWB) variant of the Plymouth Voyager following the 2001 folding of the [[Plymouth (automobile)|Plymouth]] division of [[Daimler AG|DaimlerChrysler AG]].

Together with its nameplate variants, the Chrysler minivans have ranked as the 13th [[List of bestselling vehicle nameplates|bestselling automotive nameplate]] worldwide, with over 12 million sold.&lt;ref name="autonews"&gt;{{cite web|title= Chrysler LLC Celebrates 25th Anniversary of the Minivan |publisher=Autonew24h.com |url= http://www.autonews24h.com/Auto-Industry/Chrysler/2885.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The European Chrysler Voyager was first released in 1988, nearly identical to its American counterpart, the Plymouth Voyager; the only visual differences between the two were the head/taillights and grille. Besides the slightly different appearance, the European Voyagers were sold with different engines, including [[diesel engine]]s, which are popular in Europe; and the trim was different. They were also available with manual transmission and a foot operated emergency brake.

The last European Chrysler Grand Voyagers are very similar to the 2008 and later [[Chrysler Town &amp; Country]] cars, and were sold only in the long-wheelbase version (as in North America).

Although now produced solely in [[Ontario]], Canada, the Grand Voyagers were still available with diesel engines as standard. These diesel engines are based on a modern double overhead cam common rail design from [[VM Motori]] of [[Italy]].

Following the fifth generation, the Grand Voyager nameplate was discontinued in all markets with the exception of China, where it is used on a [[Rebadging|rebadged]] [[Chrysler Pacifica (RU)|Chrysler Pacifica]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.chrysler.com.cn/grand_voyager/|title = 克莱斯勒大捷龙报价,MPV商务车型-克莱斯勒大捷龙官方网站|publisher = Chrysler (China) Auto Sales Co., Ltd.|accessdate = 26 November 2018|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1988–1990 models sold in Europe were [[Dodge Caravan]]s rebranded as Chryslers. In America, the [[Dodge Caravan|Caravan]] was sold alongside a similar Plymouth Voyager counterpart. Europe's Chrysler Voyager was nearly identical to the American Dodge Caravan except that a turbocharged four-cylinder engine and the 3.3 L Chrysler ''[[Chrysler 3.3 engine#3.3|EGA]]'' V6 were never made available.

Introduced for the 1991 model year, the Chrysler Voyager in Europe continued to be identical to the [[Dodge Caravan]] in the United States except that the 3.8 L V6 was not available for the Chrysler Voyager. This would be the final generation available with a [[manual transmission]]. A 2.5 L turbo diesel four-cylinder engine produced by [[VM Motori]] was made available beginning in 1994.  There were also military modifications available for the Voyager in South Africa, which included large fuel tanks available in 240 and 360 liter capacities.

The 1996–1999 models in [[Mexico]] are rebadged [[Dodge Caravan]]s, although the Caravan was sold alongside the Voyager.  For 2000, the Chrysler Voyager was identical to the [[Plymouth Voyager]] except that the 3.8 L V6 was not available. Base models of the Voyager were offered in most states with either a 2.4&amp;nbsp;L [[Straight-4|four-cylinder]] or a 3.0&amp;nbsp;L Mitsubishi V6 engine, except in California and several northeastern states, where the Mitsubishi V6 didn't meet emissions standards. In those locales, the 3.3&amp;nbsp;L [[Internal combustion engine|engine]] was offered instead.
For the European market, Voyagers continued to be rebadged Caravans. Unique to this market were 2.0 L [[Straight-4]] SOHC and DOHC engines and 2.5 L turbo diesel produced by VM Motori. European market vans also came with manual transmissions and in a six-passenger model with six captains chairs, not available elsewhere.

===Safety===
According to EuroNCAP crash test results, the 1999 model Chrysler Voyager did so badly in the frontal impact that it earned no points,&lt;ref name="euroncap.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euroncap.com/tests/chrysler_voyager_1999/56.aspx|title=Chrysler Voyager 1999|accessdate=2015-08-01|work=euroncap.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it the worst of the group. The body structure became unstable and the steering column was driven back into the driver's chest and head'. The 2007 model Chrysler Voyager fared little better, achieving just 19% in the frontal impact test, with an overall score of 2 stars out of a possible 5.&lt;ref name="www.euroncap.com"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.euroncap.com/tests/chrysler_voyager_2007/277.aspx |title=Chrysler Voyager 2007|accessdate=2015-08-01|work=www.euroncap.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, chest compression measurements on the test dummy 'indicated an unacceptably high risk of serious or fatal injury. As a result, the final star in the adult occupant rating is struck-through'.

Despite the bad results in the Euro NCAP crash tests, statistics from the real world indicate that this is not the whole picture. [[Folksam]] is a Swedish insurance company that in May 2009 published a report on injuries and survivability of 172 car models.  The 88–96 generation got a real world rating of "Average", and the 96-00 generation got a rating called "Safest" (at least 30% safer than the average car.)

From 2001 to 2003, the Voyager was offered in the SWB model only, replacing the SWB Plymouth Voyager. It resembled the [[Chrysler Town and Country|Town and Country]] more than the previous generation, the only major cosmetic difference besides the trim (where the Town and Country's is fancier) was the placement of the Chrysler emblem on the grille. After the 2003 model year, the Voyager was discontinued (United States market) and replaced by the Chrysler Town and Country, SWB model. The SWB Town &amp; Country continued under the Voyager name in the Mexican market.

===Year to year changes===
*'''2000''': The Voyager is sold as a Plymouth and as a Chrysler, with the same options and features, however the Chrysler versions have sticker prices of about US$500 more.
*'''2001''': The Chrysler Voyager was completely redesigned for this year as were the other Chrysler minivans. It was now only sold under the Chrysler [[marque]]; no "Grand" LWB versions are sold. Some new features include side airbags and an optional navigation system.
*'''2002''': Either a [[VCR]] or a DVD-based rear-seat entertainment system was a new option available for dealer installation on all 2002 Voyagers. A high-value entry-level model, the ''eC'' was offered this year along with the base and ''LX'' models. All 2002 Voyagers now used a four-speed [[automatic transmission]].
*'''2003''': Power-adjustable brake and accelerator pedals were available on 2003 Voyagers. [[Anti-lock brakes]] remained optional for the upscale ''LX'', but were no longer available for base Voyagers. The Voyager was discontinued after this year and was replaced by the little-changed SWB Town and Country.

In Europe Chrysler began offering the Voyager with the first generation, followed by the second generation model in 2001, with a new engine range – including larger, more economical diesel engines (2.5 L and for 2005 – the 2.8 L 4 cylinder from [[VM Motori]]) and more fuel-efficient petrol engines (I4 and V6).

The fourth generation Grand Voyager continued production for the Chinese market alongside the [[Dodge Grand Caravan]] until late 2010. Both models were built by [[Soueast]] in China, using a Town &amp; Country production line relocated from Taiwan, and were powered by [[Mitsubishi 6G7x engine|Mitsubishi 6G72]] engines.

Chrysler introduced the new Grand Voyager for 2008 and successfully positioned it in the automotive market as a luxury MPV suited for large families. The Grand Voyager is visually identical to the [[Chrysler Town &amp; Country]] which is sold in the North American and South American markets. In similar fashion to the other large [[multi-purpose vehicle]]s ([[Minivan|MPV]]s) on the market the Grand Voyager is sold with a standard diesel engine in Europe.

However, the seating is arranged in the 2–2–3 (front to rear) layout common in North America, rather than the 2–3–2 layout often seen in SUVs and MPVs in Europe. On right hand drive (RHD) models the gear shift lever is placed on a floor-mounted console between the seats, in contrast to the instrument panel positioning found on LHD models.

All engines are paired with Chrysler's 62TE 6-speed automatic transmission with variable line pressure (VLP) technology (See [[Ultradrive#62TE|Ultradrive]]).

===Lancia Voyager===
All Voyagers sold since October 2011 in continental Europe are sold under the [[Lancia]] brand.

The Chrysler-branded variant continues to be sold in the United Kingdom, Ireland, Russia, Australia, New Zealand, South Korea, Singapore, and China, as Lancia does not have sales operations in those markets. Voyager become the successor to previous unrelated series of minivans produced by Lancia, the last of which is the [[Lancia Phedra|Phedra]].

However, the parent company [[Fiat Chrysler Automobiles]] under the leadership of CEO [[Sergio Marchionne]] has decided to shut down both Chrysler and Lancia brands out of its European market (with the exception of keeping one model of Lancia available for sale in Italy). Therefore, it appears Voyager too is on its way out of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jalopnik.com/lancia-dying-a-slow-painful-death-will-only-sell-yps-1580677716 ''Lancia, Dying A Slow, Painful Death, Will Only Sell Ypsilons in 2016'' --Jalopnik]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Seating features==
The Chrysler Voyager has incorporated various seating systems for their minivans to enhance interior flexibility.

===Integrated child safety seats===
In 1992, Chrysler introduced a second row bench seat integrating two child booster seats. These seats continued as an available option through fifth generation until they were discontinued in 2010.

===Easy Out Roller Seats===
In 1996, Chrysler had introduced a system of seats to simplify installation, removal, and re-positioning— marketed as ''Easy-Out Roller Seats''.  The system remained in use throughout the life of the ''Chrysler Voyager''.

When installed, the seats are latched to floor-mounted strikers. When unlatched, eight rollers lift each seat, allowing it to be rolled fore and aft. Tracks have locator depressions for rollers, thus enabling simple installation. Ergonomic levers at the seatbacks release the floor latches single-handedly without tools and raise the seats onto the rollers in a single motion. Additionally, seatbacks were designed to fold forward.  Seat roller tracks are permanently attached to the floor and seat stanchions are aligned, facilitating the longitiudinal rolling of the seats. Bench seat stanchions were moved inboard to reduce bending stress in the seat frames, allowing them to be lighter.

When configured as two- and three- person benches, the Easy Out Roller Seats could be unwieldy.  Beginning in 2001, second and third row seats became available in a 'quad' configuration – bucket or captain chairs in the second row and a third row three-person 50/50 split "bench" — with each section weighing under {{Convert|50|lb|abbr=on}}.

===Stow'n Go seating===
In 2005, Chrysler introduced a system of second and third row seating that folded completely into under-floor compartments – marketed as ''Stow 'n Go'' seating and exclusively available on long-wheelbase models.

In a development program costing $400 million,&lt;ref name="ameinfo"&gt;{{cite web|title=Chrysler extends leadership in Mideast minivan segment with 'Stow 'n Go' |work=Ameinfo.com |url=http://www.ameinfo.com/53687.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130325175844/http://www.ameinfo.com/53687.html |archivedate=March 25, 2013 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; engineers used an [[erector set]] to initially help visualize the complex interaction of the design&lt;ref name="pressrel1"&gt;{{cite press release|title=Chrysler Group Brings Minivan Segment's Only Stow 'n Go Seating And Storage System to Market in Just 18 Months |publisher=Chrysler Press Release |url= http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&amp;STORY=/www/story/01-05-2004/0002083064&amp;EDATE=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and redesigned underfloor components to accommodate the system — including the spare tire well, fuel tank, exhaust system, parking brake cables, rear climate control lines, and the rear suspension.&lt;ref name="pressrel1"/&gt;  Even so, the new seating system precluded incorporation of an AWD system, effectively ending that option for the Chrysler minivans.

The system in turn creates a combined volume of {{convert|12|cuft|L}} of under floor storage when second row seats are deployed. With both row folded, the vans have a flat load floor and a maximum cargo volume of {{convert|160.7|cuft|L}}.&lt;ref name="ameinfo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Stowngopressrelease"&gt;http://www.media.chrysler.com/newsrelease.do?id=129&lt;/ref&gt;

The Stow 'n Go system received the Popular Science Magazine's "Best of What's New" for 2005 award.&lt;ref name="autointell"&gt;{{cite web|title=Stow 'n Go Minivan Technology Awarded Popular Science Magazine's "Best of What's New" for 2005 |work=Autointell.com |url= http://www.autointell.com/News-2004/November-2004/Nov-2004-3/Nov-17-04-p3.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Stow 'n Go system is not offered on the [[Volkswagen Routan]], a [[badge engineering|rebadged nameplate variant]] of the Chrysler minivans.

===Swivel 'n Go Seating===
Chrysler introduced a seating system in 2008, marketed as ''[[Swivel seat|Swivel'n Go]]''.  In the seating system, two full size second row seats swivel to face the third row. A detachable table can be placed between the second and third row seats.  The Swivel'n Go seating system includes the 3rd row seating from the Stow'n Go system.

These Swivel 'n Go Seats are manufactured by Intier Corp. a division of Magna. The tracks, risers and swivel mechanisms are assembled by Camslide, a division of Intier. The swivel mechanism was designed by and is produced by [[Toyo Seat]] USA Corp.

The system is noted for its high strength.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} The entire load of the seat in the event of a crash is transferred through the swivel mechanism, which is almost twice as strong as the minimum government requirement.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

The swivel mechanism includes bumpers that stabilize the seat while in the lock position. When rotated the seat comes off these bumpers to allow easy rotation.

The seat is not meant to be left in an unlocked position or swiveled with the occupant in it, although this will not damage the swivel mechanism.

==Production worldwide==
[[File:Lancia Voyager 2.8 MultiJet 16v Gold – Frontansicht, 10. März 2012, Düsseldorf.jpg|thumb|European Lancia Voyager in Germany]]
In the early years of its marketing, the Voyagers were produced in North America and were exported to Europe (1988–1991).

In 1991, the first Voyagers were produced in [[Austria]], at the [[Eurostar Automobilwerk|Eurostar]] plant nearby [[Graz]]. Eurostar was a joint venture between [[Chrysler (division)|Chrysler]] and the Austrian company [[Steyr-Daimler-Puch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=diepresse.com article, Austrian newspaper|publisher=|date=December 3, 2007|url=http://diepresse.com/home/wirtschaft/economist/347092/index.do|accessdate=2008-01-22}}. Eurostar was a Joint-Venture&lt;/ref&gt; It was later acquired by [[DaimlerChrysler]] and finally the plant was sold to [[Magna Steyr]] in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=handelsblatt.com article, German newspaper|publisher=|date=February 15, 2002|url=https://www.handelsblatt.com/archiv/chrysler-group-verkauft-eurostar-an-magna-steyr;503202|accessdate=2008-01-22}}. Chrysler is selling Eurostar to Magna Steyr&lt;/ref&gt; The minivan production ended there at the end of 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=diepresse.com article, Austrian newspaper|publisher=|date=June 4, 2008|url=http://diepresse.com/home/wirtschaft/economist/388420/index.do|accessdate=2008-01-22}}. Voyager production ended in 2007 in Austria.&lt;/ref&gt; Units produced in Austria were marketed in Europe, Asia and Africa. They were built with gasoline and [[diesel engine]]s, with [[manual transmission]] version, in short-wheelbase (SWB) and long-wheelbase versions, and in right and left-hand drive versions (all sold as Chrysler Voyager).

From 2008 to 2010, the fourth generation Grand Voyager was produced in China by [[Soueast]] using a relocated Taiwanese Town &amp; Country assembly line.

The fifth generation Voyagers (2008–2011) have been exported to Europe from [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]], Canada, where they are produced. Beginning in October 2011, they were exported and sold as the Lancia Voyager in most European markets, as Chrysler operations were merged with those of Lancia in many European countries. In the United Kingdom, only the Grand Voyager is marketed.

Since 2011, the Voyager is sold under the [[Lancia]] badge in Europe to strengthen the Chrysler-Lancia integration, though it remains branded as the '''Chrysler Voyager''' in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Ireland]]. In March 2015, Fiat Group announced that in 2017, Chrysler would be discontinued in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.whatcar.com/car-news/chrysler-brand-axed-uk-2017/1338450 |title=Chrysler brand to be axed in the UK in 2017 |website=What Car? |date=17 March 2015 |accessdate=12 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was removed from Chrysler UK's website in January 2016.

The [[Coriolis effect]] causes cyclonic rotation to be in a counterclockwise direction in the northern hemisphere, and clockwise in the southern hemisphere.&lt;ref name=about&gt;{{cite web|title=Cyclonic Rotation|url=http://weather.about.com/od/c/g/cyclonic.htm|publisher=About.com|accessdate=5 January 2013|author=Oblack, Rachelle}}&lt;/ref&gt; A closed area of winds rotating cyclonically is known as a [[cyclone]].

'''Digital Weight Indicator''' also commonly called '''Weight Indicator'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Weight indicator |url=http://www.directindustry.com/prod/sartorius-ag/weight-indicators-4963-75066.html |work=Direct Industry |accessdate=19 May 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121001094620/http://www.directindustry.com/prod/sartorius-ag/weight-indicators-4963-75066.html |archivedate=1 October 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a system of indication or recording of the selector type or one that advances intermittently in which all values are presented digitally, or in numbers. In a digital indicating or recording element, or in digital representation, there are no graduations. The [[National Conference on Weights and Measures]] (NWCM) lists these device types as “Indicating Elements” in its certificate databases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Application for Approval to Operate as a Weighing Facility|url=http://gipsa.usda.gov/fgis/forms-fgis/fgis-1001.pdf|work=Grain Inspection, Packers &amp; Stockyards Administration|publisher=United States Department of Agriculture|accessdate=19 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The National Conference on Weights and Measures&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=National Conference on Weights and Measures|url=http://www.ncwm.net|accessdate=19 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; have categorized Digital Weight Indicator as a Verified Conformity Assessment Program (VCAP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is VCAP?|url=http://www.ncwm.net/ntep/conformity/vcap/checklists-faqs#WhatIsVcap|work=National Conference on Weights and Measures|accessdate=19 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A program has been proposed by the [[National Conference on Weights and Measures]] to ensure compliance of certain device types with environmental requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What devices fall under the VCAP?|url=http://www.ncwm.net/ntep/conformity/vcap/checklists-faqs#whatdevices|work=National Conference on Weights and Measures|accessdate=19 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Over the years, it gets more intelligent and complicated than conventional [[weighing scales]]. It can interact with different devices such as a [[load cell]], printer, and [[computer]] via cables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Digital Weight Indicator |url=http://liteindicator.com/info-weight-indicator.php |work=LiteIndicator |accessdate=19 May 2013 |date=24 August 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140327222910/http://liteindicator.com/info-weight-indicator.php |archivedate=27 March 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Interactions==
===With load cell===
[[Load cell]] will produce a small [[electric current]] when [[weight]] is applied. The electric current is sent to Digital Weight Indicator via a normal cable. The Digital Weight Indicator will amplify the electric current and translate it to digital weight. Example: 15.7&amp;nbsp;kg

===With printer===
When attached to a [[Printer (computing)|printer]] via a [[printer cable]], it can print the weight on paper. Usually Weight Indicator come with a basic printing feature. It can be program in the [[firmware]] to print in few basic format. Usually there is a print button on the Digital Weight Indicator for user to press to print.

===With computer===
A computer can be connected to it via a [[serial cable]] to [[RS-232]] port on the computer. Information like weight, unit weight, status (stable, unstable, error) is send to the computer in a particular format. The format is not standard and differs with each brand. A computer interpret the information received and display them on screen and print it on printer. With user interaction, user can enters other information in relation to the weight received and save them to a database. By storing information in a database, many other process can be automated by software application like [[invoicing]], [[quality control]], batch control, warehousing, distribution, and more.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2004">A '''displacement field''' is an assignment of [[displacement (vector)|displacement vectors]] for all points in a region or body that is displaced from one state to another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.brown.edu/Departments/Engineering/Courses/En221/Notes/Kinematics/Kinematics.htm |title=Continuum Mechanics - Kinematics |website=School of Engineering |publisher=[[Brown University]] |access-date=2018-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mechanical-engineering/2-080j-structural-mechanics-fall-2013/course-notes/MIT2_080JF13_Lecture2.pdf |title=2.080 Lecture 3: The Concept of Stress, Generalized Stresses and Equilibrium |website=[[MIT OpenCourseWare]] |access-date=2018-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; A displacement vector specifies the position of a point or a particle in reference to an origin or to a previous position. For example, a displacement field may be used to describe the effects of [[deformation (mechanics)|deformation]] on a solid body.

Before considering displacement, the state before deformation must be defined. It is a state in which the coordinates of all points are known and described by the function:

:&lt;math&gt;\vec{R}_0: \Omega \rightarrow P&lt;/math&gt;

where
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{R}_0&lt;/math&gt; is a placement vector
:&lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; are all the points of the body
:&lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; are all the points in the space in which the body is present

Most often it is a state of the body in which no forces are applied.

Then given any other state of this body in which coordinates of all its points are described as &lt;math&gt;\vec{R}_1&lt;/math&gt; the displacement field is the difference between two body states:

:&lt;math&gt;\vec{u} = \vec{R}_1 - \vec{R}_0&lt;/math&gt;

where
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{u}&lt;/math&gt; is a displacement field, which for each point of the body specifies a [[displacement (vector)|displacement vector]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12698">'''Electronic entropy''' is the [[entropy]] of a system attributable to electrons' probabilistic occupation of states. This entropy can take a number of forms. The first form can be termed a [[density of states]] based entropy. The [[Fermi–Dirac statistics|Fermi–Dirac distribution]] implies that each eigenstate of a system, {{math|''i''}}, is occupied with a certain probability, {{math|''p''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;}}. As the entropy is given by a sum over the probabilities of occupation of those states, there is an entropy associated with the occupation of the various electronic states. In most molecular systems, the energy spacing between the highest occupied molecular orbital and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital is usually large, and thus the probabilities associated with the occupation of the excited states are small. Therefore, the electronic entropy in molecular systems can safely be neglected. Electronic entropy is thus most relevant for the thermodynamics of condensed phases, where the density of states at the [[Fermi level]] can be quite large, and the electronic entropy can thus contribute substantially to thermodynamic behavior.&lt;ref name='Wolverton 1995'&gt;{{cite journal

==From the density of states==

===General Formulation===

The entropy due to a set of states that can be either occupied with probability &lt;math&gt;p_i&lt;/math&gt; or empty with probability &lt;math&gt;1-p_i&lt;/math&gt; can be written as:
:&lt;math&gt;S=-k_{\rm B}\sum_i n_i [ p_i \ln p_i + (1-p_i) \ln( 1 - p_i ) ] &lt;/math&gt;,

where {{math| ''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;}} is [[Boltzmann constant]].

For a continuously distributed set of states as a function of energy, such as the eigenstates in an [[electronic band structure]], the above sum can be written as an integral over the possible energy values, rather than a sum. Switching from summing over individual states to integrating over energy levels, the entropy can be written as:

:&lt;math&gt;S=-k_{\rm B} \int n(E) \left [ p(E) \ln p(E) +(1- p(E)) \ln \left ( 1- p(E)\right )  \right ]dE &lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''n''(''E'')}} is the [[density of states]] of the solid. The probability of occupation of each eigenstate is given by the Fermi function, {{math|''f''}}:

:&lt;math&gt;p(E)=f=\frac{1}{e^{(E-E_{\rm F}) / k_{\rm B} T} + 1}&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''E''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the [[Fermi energy]] and {{math|''T''}} is the absolute temperature. One can then re-write the entropy as:
:&lt;math&gt;S=-k_{\rm B} \int n(E) \left [ f \ln f +(1- f) \ln \left ( 1- f \right )  \right ]dE &lt;/math&gt;
This is the general formulation of the density-of-states based electronic entropy.

===Useful approximation===

It is useful to recognize that the only states within ~{{math|{{plusmn}} ''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T''}} of the Fermi level contribute significantly to the entropy. Other states are either fully occupied, {{math|&lt;var&gt;f&lt;/var&gt; {{=}} 1}}, or completely unoccupied, {{math|&lt;var&gt;f&lt;/var&gt; {{=}} 0}}. In either case, these states do not contribute to the entropy. If one assumes that the density of states is constant within {{math|{{plusmn}} ''k''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''T''}} of the Fermi level, one can derive that the electronic entropy is equal to:&lt;ref name=Nicholson1995 /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;S=\frac{\pi}{3} k_{\rm B}^2 T n(E_{\rm F})&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''n''(''E''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;)}} is the density of states at the Fermi level. Several other approximations can be made, but they all indicate that the electronic entropy should, to first order, be proportional to the temperature and the density of states at the Fermi level. As the density of states at the Fermi level varies widely between systems, this approximation is a reasonable heuristic for inferring when it may be necessary to include electronic entropy in the thermodynamic description of a system; only systems with large densities of states at the Fermi level should exhibit non-negligible electronic entropy (where large may be approximately defined as {{math|''n''(''E''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;) ≥ (''k''{{su|b=B|p=2}}''T'')&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}).

== Application to different materials classes ==
'''Insulators''' have zero density of states at the Fermi level due to their [[band gap]]s. Thus, the density of states-based electronic entropy is essentially zero in these systems.

'''Metals''' have non-zero density of states at the Fermi level. Metals with free-electron-like band structures (e.g. alkali metals, alkaline earth metals, Cu, and Al) generally exhibit relatively low density of states at the Fermi level, and therefore exhibit fairly low electronic entropies. Transition metals, wherein the flat d-bands lie close to the Fermi level, generally exhibit much larger electronic entropies than the free-electron like metals.

'''Oxides''' have particularly flat band structures and thus can exhibit large {{math|''n''(''E''&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;)}}, if the Fermi level intersects these bands. As most oxides are insulators, this is generally not the case. However, when oxides are metallic (i.e. the Fermi level lies within an unfilled, flat set of bands), oxides exhibit some of the largest electronic entropies of any material.

'''Thermoelectric materials''' are specifically engineered to have large electronic entropies. The [[thermoelectric effect]] relies on charge carriers exhibiting large entropies, as the driving force to establish a gradient in electrical potential is driven by the entropy associated with the charge carriers. In the thermoelectric literature, the term ''band structure engineering'' refers to the manipulation of material structure and chemistry to achieve a high density of states near the Fermi level. More specifically, thermoelectric materials are intentionally doped to exhibit only partially filled bands at the Fermi level, resulting in high electronic entropies.&lt;ref name=Pei2012&gt;{{cite journal

==Configurational electronic entropy==
Configurational electronic entropy is usually observed in mixed-valence transition metal oxides, as the charges in these systems are both localized (the system is ionic), and capable of changing (due to the mixed valency). To a first approximation (i.e. assuming that the charges are distributed randomly), the molar configurational electronic entropy is given by:&lt;ref name=Zhou2006 /&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;S \approx n_\text{sites} \left [ x \ln  x + (1-x) \ln (1-x) \right ] &lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''n''&lt;sub&gt;sites&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the fraction of sites on which a localized electron/hole could reside (typically a transition metal site), and {{math|''x''}} is the concentration of localized electrons/holes. Of course, the localized charges are not distributed randomly, as the charges will interact electrostatically with one another, and so the above formula should only be regarded as an approximation to the configurational atomic entropy. More sophisticated approximations have been made in the literature.&lt;ref name=Zhou2006 /&gt;

The speed varies from around 1&amp;nbsp;km/s at the border between the umbra and the penumbra to a maximum of around double this in the middle of the penumbra and falls off to zero at the outer edge of the penumbra.
Evershed first detected this phenomenon in January 1909, whilst working at the [[Kodaikanal Solar Observatory]] in India,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Subramanian |first1=T.S. |date=1999 |title=Centenary of a solar observatory |journal=Frontline |volume=16 |issue=13 |url=http://www.frontlineonnet.com/fl1613/16130880.htm |accessdate=27 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120717181636/http://www.frontlineonnet.com/fl1613/16130880.htm |archivedate=17 July 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; when he found that the [[spectral line]]s of sunspots showed [[doppler shift]].

Afterwards, measurements of the spectral [[emission lines]] emitted in the [[ultraviolet]] wavelengths have shown a systematic red-shift. The Evershed effect is common to every spectral line formed at a temperature below 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;K; this fact would imply a constant downflow from the [[solar transition region|transition region]] towards the [[chromosphere]]. The observed velocity is about 5&amp;nbsp;km/s. Of course, this is impossible, since if it were true, the [[corona]] would disappear in a short time instead of being suspended over the [[Sun]] at temperatures of million degrees over distances much larger than a solar radius.

Many theories have been proposed to explain this redshift in line profiles of the transition region, but the problem is still unsolved, since a coherent theory should take into account all the physical observations: UV line profiles are redshifted ''on average'', but they show back and forth velocity oscillations at the same time.

[[Image:Foam - big.jpg|thumb|right|[[Soap]] foam bubbles]]

'''Foam''' is a object formed by trapping pockets of [[gas]] in a [[liquid]] or [[solid]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/foam Foam | Definition of Foam by Merriam-Webster&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141209213221/http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/foam |date=2014-12-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;D. Weaire, S. Hutzler, "The Physics of Foams", Oxford University Press, 1999, {{ISBN|0198510977}}, {{ISBN|978-0-1985-1097-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;I. Cantat, S. Cohen-Addad, F. Elias, F. Graner, R. Höhler, O. Pitois, F. Rouyer, A. Saint-Jalmes, "Foams: structure and dynamics", Oxford University Press, ed. S.J. Cox, 2013, {{ISBN|9780199662890}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A bath sponge and the head on a glass of beer are examples of foams. In most foams, the volume of [[gas]] is large, with thin films of liquid or solid separating the regions of gas. Soap foams are also known as '''suds'''.

Solid foams can be closed-cell or [[reticulated foam|open-cell]]. In closed-cell foam, the gas forms discrete pockets, each completely surrounded by the solid material. In open-cell foam, gas pockets connect to each other. A bath sponge is an example of an open-cell foam: water easily flows through the entire structure, displacing the air. A [[camping mat]] is an example of a closed-cell foam: gas pockets are sealed from each other so the mat cannot soak up water.

Foams are examples of [[dispersed media]]. In general, gas is present, so it divides into gas bubbles of different sizes (i.e., the material is [[polydisperse]])—separated by liquid regions that may form films, thinner and thinner when the liquid phase drains out of the system [[Interface (chemistry)|films]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lucassen|first1=J. |authorlink1= |last2= |first2= |editor1-first=E.

''Foam'' can also refer to something that is analogous to foam, such as [[quantum foam]], [[polyurethane]] foam ([[foam rubber]]), [[Polystyrene#Extruded polystyrene foam|XPS foam]], [[polystyrene]], [[Phenolic resin|phenolic]], or many other manufactured foams.

== Structure ==

A foam is, in many cases, a multi-scale system.

[[File:Order and Chaos.tif|thumb|Order and disorder of bubbles in a surface foam]]
One scale is the bubble: [[materials science|material]] foams are typically [[randomness|disordered]] and have a variety of bubble sizes. At larger sizes, the study of idealized foams is closely linked to the mathematical problems of [[minimal surface]]s and three-dimensional [[tessellations]], also called [[honeycomb (geometry)|honeycombs]]. The [[Weaire–Phelan structure]] is considered the best possible (optimal) [[unit cell]] of a perfectly ordered foam,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Morgan |first1=F. |title=Existence of Least-perimeter Partitions |url=https://arxiv.org/ftp/arxiv/papers/0711/0711.4228.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Plateau's laws]] describe how soap-films form structures in foams.

At lower scale than the bubble is the thickness of the film for [[metastable]] foams, which can be considered a network of interconnected films called [[Lamella (materials)|lamellae]]. Ideally, the lamellae connect in triads and radiate 120° outward from the connection points, known as [[Plateau's laws|Plateau borders]].

An even lower scale is the liquid–air interface at the surface of the film. Most of the time this interface is stabilized by a layer of [[amphiphilic]] structure, often made of [[surfactant]]s, particles ([[Pickering emulsion]]), or more complex associations.

== Formation ==

Several conditions are needed to produce foam: there must be mechanical work, [[Surfactant|surface active components]] (surfactants) that reduce the [[surface tension]], and the formation of foam faster than its breakdown.
To create foam, [[Work (physics)|work]] (W) is needed to increase the [[surface area]] (ΔA):

:&lt;math&gt; W = \gamma  \Delta A \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

where γ is the surface tension.

One of the ways foam is created is through dispersion, where a large amount of gas is mixed with a liquid. A more specific method of dispersion involves injecting a gas through a hole in a solid into a liquid. If this process is completed very slowly, then one bubble can be emitted from the orifice at a time as shown in the picture below.

One of the theories for determining the separation time is shown below; however, while this theory produces the theoretical data that matches with experimental data, detachment due to capillarity is accepted as a better explanation.
[[File:Rising Bubble from Orifice.png|thumb|Rising bubble from orifice]]

The [[buoyancy]] force acts to raise the bubble, which is

:&lt;math&gt; F_b = Vg(\rho_2-\rho_1)\!&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is the volume of the bubble, &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is the acceleration due to gravity, and ρ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the density of the gas ρ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is the density of the liquid. The force working against the buoyancy force is the [[surface tension]] force, which is

:&lt;math&gt; F_s = 2r \pi\gamma\!&lt;/math&gt;,
where γ is the surface tension, and &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is the radius of the orifice.
As more air is pushed into the bubble, the buoyancy force grows quicker than the surface tension force. Thus, detachment occurs when the buoyancy force is large enough to overcome the surface tension force. 
:&lt;math&gt; Vg(\rho_2-\rho_1)&gt; 2r \pi\gamma\!&lt;/math&gt;
In addition, if the bubble is treated as a sphere with a radius of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; and the volume &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is substituted in to the equation above, separation occurs at the moment when
:&lt;math&gt;  R^3=\frac{3r\gamma}{2g(\rho_2-\rho_1)}\!&lt;/math&gt;

Examining this phenomenon from a capillarity viewpoint for a bubble that is being formed very slowly, it can be assumed that the pressure &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; inside is constant everywhere. The hydrostatic pressure in the liquid is designated by &lt;math&gt;p_0&lt;/math&gt;. The change in pressure across the interface from gas to liquid is equal to the capillary pressure; hence,

:&lt;math&gt; p-p_0=\gamma\left (\frac{1}{R_1}+\frac{1}{R_2}\right)\!&lt;/math&gt;
where R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are the radii of curvature and are set as positive. At the stem of the bubble, R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and R&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; are the radii of curvature also treated as positive.  Here the hydrostatic pressure in the liquid has to take in account z,  the distance from the top to the stem of the bubble. The new hydrostatic pressure at the stem of the bubble is ''p''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(''ρ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''ρ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)''z''.  The hydrostatic pressure balances the capillary pressure, which is shown below:

:&lt;math&gt; p-p_0-(\rho_2-\rho_1)gz=\gamma\left (\frac{1}{R_3}+\frac{1}{R_4}\right)\!&lt;/math&gt;

Finally, the difference in the top and bottom pressure equal the change in hydrostatic pressure:

:&lt;math&gt; (\rho_2-\rho_1)gz=\gamma\left (\frac{1}{R_1}+\frac{1}{R_2}-\frac{1}{R_3}-\frac{1}{R_4}\right)\!&lt;/math&gt;
At the stem of the bubble, the shape of the bubble is nearly cylindrical; consequently,  either R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; or R&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is large while the other radius of curvature is small. As the stem of the bubble grows in length, it becomes more unstable as one of the radius grows and the other shrinks.  At a certain point, the vertical length of the stem exceeds the circumference of the stem and due to the buoyancy forces the bubble separates and the process repeats.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Bikerman, J.J. "Formation and Structure" in ''Foams'' New York, Springer-Verlag, 1973. ch 2. sec 24–25&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stabilization ===

[[File:Marangoni Effect of a Film.png|thumb|Marangoni effect of a film|left]]
[[File:Marangoni Effect of a film (2).png|thumb|Marangoni effect of a film (2)|left]]

The stabilization of a foam is caused by [[van der Waals force]]s between the molecules in the foam, [[electrical double layer]]s created by [[Dipole|dipolar]] surfactants, and the [[Marangoni effect]], which acts as a restoring force to the lamellae.

The Marangoni effect depends on the liquid that is foaming being impure.  Generally, surfactants in the solution decrease the surface tension. The surfactants also clump together on the surface and form a layer as  shown below.

For the Marangoni effect to occur, the foam must be indented as shown in the first picture.  This indentation increases local surface area. Surfactants have a larger diffusion time than the bulk of the solution—so the surfactants are less concentrated in the indentation.

Also, surface stretching makes the surface tension of the indented spot greater than the surrounding area.  Consequentially—since diffusion time for the surfactants is large—the Marangoni effect has time to take place. The difference in surface tension creates a gradient, which instigates fluid flow from areas of lower surface tension to areas of higher surface tension.

=== Destabilization ===

Rybczynski and Hadamar developed an equation to calculate the velocity of bubbles that rise in foam with the assumption that the bubbles are spherical with a radius &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt;.

:&lt;math&gt; u=\frac{2gr^2}{9\eta_2}(\rho_2-\rho_1)\left (\frac{3\eta_1+3\eta_2}{3\eta_1+2\eta_2}\right)\!&lt;/math&gt;

with velocity in units of centimeters per second. ρ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ρ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is the density for a gas and liquid respectively in units of g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and ῃ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ῃ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is the viscosity of the gas and liquid g/cm·s and g is the acceleration in units of cm/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

However, since the density and viscosity of a liquid is much greater than the gas, the density and viscosity of the gas can be neglected, which yields the new equation for velocity of bubbles rising as:
:&lt;math&gt; u=\frac{gr^2}{3\eta_2}(\rho_2)\!&lt;/math&gt;

However, through experiments it has been shown that a more accurate model for bubbles rising is:
:&lt;math&gt; u=\frac{2gr^2}{9\eta_2}(\rho_2-\rho_1)\!&lt;/math&gt;

Deviations are due to the [[Marangoni effect]] and capillary pressure, which affect the assumption that the bubbles are spherical.
For laplace pressure of a curved gas liquid interface, the two principal radii of curvature at a point are R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson, A.J, "Principles of Foam Formation and Stability." ''Foams: Physics, Chemistry, and Structure''. New York, Springer-Verlag, 1989, ch 1&lt;/ref&gt; With a curved interface, the pressure in one phase is greater than the pressure in another phase. The capillary pressure P&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; is given by the equation of:

:&lt;math&gt; P_c=\gamma\left (\frac{1}{R_1}+\frac{1}{R_2}\right)\!&lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is the surface tension. The bubble shown below is a gas (phase 1) in a liquid (phase 2) and point A designates the top of the bubble while point B designates the bottom of the bubble. 
[[File:Bubble for Hydrostatic Pressure.svg|thumb|Bubble for hydrostatic pressure]]
At the top of the bubble at point A, the pressure in the liquid is assumed to be p&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; as well as in the gas.  At the bottom of the bubble at point B, the hydrostatic pressure is:
:&lt;math&gt; P_B,1=p_0+g\rho_1z\!&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; P_B,2=p_0+g\rho_2z\!&lt;/math&gt;
where ρ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ρ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is the density for a gas and liquid respectively.  The difference in hydrostatic pressure at the top of the bubble is 0, while the difference in hydrostatic pressure at the bottom of the bubble across the interface is ''gz''(''ρ''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''ρ''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;).  Assuming that the radii of curvature at point A are equal and denoted by R&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; and that the radii of curvature at point B are equal and denoted by R&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;, then the difference in capillary pressure between point A and point B is:

:&lt;math&gt; P_c=2\gamma\left (\frac{1}{R_A}-\frac{1}{R_B}\right)\!&lt;/math&gt;
At equilibrium, the difference in capillary pressure must be balanced by the difference in hydrostatic pressure.  Hence,
:&lt;math&gt; gz(\rho_2-\rho_1)=2\gamma\left (\frac{1}{R_A}-\frac{1}{R_B}\right)\!&lt;/math&gt;
Since, the density of the gas is less than the density of the liquid the left hand side of the equation is always positive.  Therefore, the inverse of R&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; must be larger than the R&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;. Meaning that from the top of the bubble to the bottom of the bubble the radius of curvature increases. Therefore, without neglecting gravity the bubbles cannot be spherical.  In addition, as z increases, this causes the difference in R&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; and R&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; too, which means the bubble deviates more from its shape the larger it grows.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

Foam destabilization occurs for several reasons. First, [[gravitation]] causes drainage of liquid to the foam base, which Rybczynski and Hadamar include in their theory; however, foam also destabilizes due to [[osmotic pressure]] causes drainage from the lamellas to the Plateau borders due to internal concentration differences in the foam, and [[Laplace pressure]] causes diffusion of gas from small to large bubbles due to pressure difference. In addition, films can break under [[disjoining pressure]], These effects can lead to rearrangement of the foam structure at scales larger than the bubbles, which may be individual ([[T1 process]]) or collective (even of the "avalanche" type).

== Experiments and characterizations ==

Being a multiscale system involving many phenomena, and a versatile medium, foam can be studied using many different techniques. Considering the different scales, experimental techniques are diffraction ones, mainly light scattering techniques ([[Diffusing-wave spectroscopy|DWS]], see below, static and dynamic light scattering, X rays and neutron scattering) at sub-micrometer scales, or microscopic ones. Considering the system as continuous, its ''bulk'' properties can be characterized by light transmittance but also conductimetry. The correlation between structure and bulk is evidenced more accurately by acoustics in particular. The organisation between bubbles has been studied numerically using sequential attempts of evolution of the minimum surface energy either at random (Pott's model) or deterministic way (surface evolver). The evolution with time (i.e., the dynamics) can be simulated using these models, or the ''bubble model'' (Durian), which considers the motion of individual bubbles.

Observations of the small-scale structure can be made by shining the foam with laser light or x-ray beams and measuring the reflectivity of the films between bubbles. Observations of the global structure can be done using neutron scattering.
[[Image:Foam Reflects.png|right|thumb|250px|Reflection of radiation by a foam]]
[[Image:MLS scan.gif|right|thumb|250px|Measurement principle of multiple light scattering coupled with vertical scanning]]
A typical light scattering (or diffusion) optical technique, multiple light scattering coupled with vertical scanning, is the most widely used technique to monitor the dispersion state of a product, hence identifying and quantifying destabilization phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;I.

Texter (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; It works on any concentrated dispersions without dilution, including foams. When light is sent through the sample, it is backscattered by the bubbles. The backscattering intensity is directly proportional to the size and volume fraction of the dispersed phase. Therefore, local changes in concentration (drainage, [[syneresis (chemistry)|syneresis]]) and global changes in size (ripening, coalescence) are detected and monitored.

== Applications ==

=== Liquid foams ===

Liquid foams can be used in [[fire retardant foam]], such as those that are used in extinguishing fires, especially [[oil fire]]s.

In some ways, leavened [[bread]] is a foam, as the [[yeast]] causes the bread to rise by producing tiny bubbles of gas in the dough. The dough has traditionally been understood as a closed-cell foam, in which the [[Pores (bread)|pores]] do not connect with each other. Cutting the dough releases the gas in the bubbles that are cut, but the gas in the rest of the dough cannot escape. When dough is allowed to rise too far, it becomes an open-cell foam, in which the gas pockets are connected. Now, if the dough is cut or the surface otherwise broken, a large volume of gas can escape, and the dough collapses. The open structure of an over-risen dough is easy to observe: instead of consisting of discrete gas bubbles, the dough consists of a gas space filled with threads of the flour-water paste. Recent research has indicated that the pore structure in bread is 99% interconnected into one large vacuole, thus the closed-cell foam of the moist dough is transformed into an open cell solid foam in the bread.&lt;ref&gt;Shuo Wang, Peter Austin, Sumana Chakrabarti-Bell, 2003. [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0733521011000956 It's a maze: The pore structure of bread crumbs.] Journal of Cereal Sciences, 54, 203–210&lt;/ref&gt;

The unique property of gas-liquid foams having very high specific surface area is exploited in the chemical processes of [[froth flotation]] and [[foam fractionation]].

=== Solid foams ===
{{see |Polymeric foam}}
Solid foams are a class of lightweight cellular engineering materials. These foams are typically classified into two types based on their pore structure: open-cell-structured foams (also known as [[reticulated foam]]s) and closed-cell foams. At high enough cell resolutions, any type can be treated as continuous or "continuum" materials and are referred to as [[cellular solid]]s,&lt;ref name=Gibson&gt;{{Cite book|title=Cellular Solids: Structure and Properties|last=Gibson|first=Ashby|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1999|isbn=9781316025420|location=Cambridge, UK|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; with predictable mechanical properties.

Open-cell-structured foams contain pores that are connected to each other and form an interconnected network that is relatively soft. Open-cell foams fill with whatever gas surrounds them. If filled with air, a relatively good insulator results, but, if the open cells fill with water, insulation properties would be reduced. Recent studies have put the focus on studying the properties of open-cell foams as an insulator material. Wheat gluten/TEOS bio-foams have been produced, showing similar insulator properties as for those foams obtained from oil-based resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wu|first1=Qiong|title=Highly porous flame-retardant and sustainable biofoams based on wheat gluten and in situ polymerized silica|url=http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2014/ta/c4ta04787g#!divAbstract|accessdate=19 November 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161120012345/http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2014/ta/c4ta04787g#!divAbstract|archivedate=20 November 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. Mater. Chem. A, 2014, 2, 20996&lt;/ref&gt; Foam rubber is a type of open-cell foam.

Closed-cell foams do not have interconnected pores. The closed-cell foams normally have higher compressive strength due to their structures. However, closed-cell foams are also, in general, a more [https://www.gbfoamdirect.co.uk/high-density-foam-online-uk/ dense foam], require more material, and as a consequence are more expensive to produce. The closed cells can be filled with a specialized gas to provide improved insulation. The closed-cell structure foams have higher dimensional stability, low moisture absorption coefficients, and higher strength compared to open-cell-structured foams. All types of foam are widely used as core material in [[sandwich-structured composite]] materials.

The earliest known engineering use of cellular solids is with wood, which in its dry form is a closed-cell foam composed of lignin, cellulose, and air. From the early 20th century, various types of specially manufactured solid foams came into use. The low [[density]] of these foams makes them excellent as thermal [[thermal insulation|insulators]] and flotation devices and their lightness and compressibility make them ideal as packing materials and stuffings.

An example of the use of azodicarbonamide&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reyes-Labarta|first1=J.A.|last2=Marcilla|first2=A.|title=Kinetic Study of the Decompositions Involved in the Thermal Degradation of Commercial Azodicarbonamide|journal=Journal of Applied Polymer Science|date=2008|volume=107|issue=1|page=339-346|doi=10.1002/app.26922|url=http://hdl.handle.net/10045/24682}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a blowing agent is found in the manufacture of [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl (PVC)]] and [[Ethylene-vinyl acetate|EVA-PE foams]], where it plays a role in the formation of air bubbles by breaking down into gas at high temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reyes-Labarta|first1=J.A.|last2=Marcilla|first2=A.|title=Thermal Treatment and Degradation of Crosslinked Ethylene Vinyl Acetate-Polyethylene-Azodicarbonamide-ZnO Foams.

The random or "stochastic" geometry of these foams makes them good for energy absorption, as well. In the late 20th century to early 21st century, new manufacturing techniques have allowed for geometry that results in excellent strength and stiffness per weight. These new materials are typically referred to as engineered cellular solids.&lt;ref name=Gibson/&gt;

=== Syntactic foam ===

{{Main article|Syntactic foam}}
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2012}}

A special class of closed-cell foams, known as syntactic foam, contains hollow particles embedded in a matrix material. The spheres can be made from several materials, including glass, ceramic, and [[polymer]]s. The advantage of [[syntactic foam]]s is that they have a very high strength-to-weight ratio, making them ideal materials for many applications, including [[deep-sea]] and space applications. One particular syntactic foam employs [[shape memory polymer]] as its matrix, enabling the foam to take on the characteristics of shape memory resins and [[composite materials]]; i.e., it has the ability to be reshaped repeatedly when heated above a certain temperature and cooled. Shape memory foams have many possible applications, such as dynamic structural support, flexible foam core, and expandable foam fill.

=== Integral skin foam ===&lt;!-- [[Self skin]], [[self-skin foam]] and [[integral skin foam]] redirect here --&gt;

''Integral skin foam'', also known as ''self-skin foam'', is a type of foam with a high-density skin and a low-density core. It can be formed in an ''open-mold process'' or a ''closed-mold process''. In the open-mold process, two reactive components are mixed and poured into an open mold. The mold is then closed and the mixture is allowed to expand and cure. Examples of items produced using this process include [[arm rest]]s, [[baby seat]]s, [[shoe sole]]s, and [[mattress]]es. The closed-mold process, more commonly known as ''[[reaction injection molding]]'' (RIM), injects the mixed components into a closed mold under high pressures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Ashida | first = Kaneyoshi | title = Polyurethane and related foams: chemistry and technology | publisher = CRC Press | pages = 79–81 | year = 2006 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=IQUd-3aKSD4C | isbn = 978-1-58716-159-9 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170217110121/https://books.google.com/books?id=IQUd-3aKSD4C | archivedate = 2017-02-17 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Defoaming ==
{{Unreferenced|section|date=June 2017}}
{{Main article|Defoamer}}

Foam, in this case meaning "bubbly liquid", is also produced as an often-unwanted [[by-product]] in the manufacture of various substances. For example, foam is a serious problem in the [[chemical industry]], especially for [[biochemistry|biochemical]] processes. Many biological substances, for example [[protein]]s, easily create foam on [[agitation (action)|agitation]] or [[aeration]]. Foam is a problem because it alters the liquid flow and blocks oxygen transfer from air (thereby preventing microbial respiration in [[aerobic respiration|aerobic]] [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] processes). For this reason, [[anti-foaming agent]]s, like [[silicone]] oils, are added to prevent these problems. Chemical methods of foam control are not always desired with respect to the problems (i.e., [[contamination]], reduction of [[mass transfer]]) they may cause especially in food and pharmaceutical industries, where the product quality is of great importance. Mechanical methods to prevent foam formation are more common than chemical ones.

== Speed of sound ==

{{unreferenced section|date=December 2013}}

The acoustical property of the speed of sound through a foam is of interest when analyzing failures of hydraulic components. The analysis involves calculating total hydraulic cycles to fatigue failure. The speed of sound in a foam is determined by the mechanical properties of the gas creating the foam: oxygen, nitrogen, or combinations.

Assuming that the speed of sound is based on the liquid's fluid properties leads to errors in calculating fatigue cycles and failure of mechanical hydraulic components. Using acoustical transducers and related instrumentation that set low limits (0–50,000&amp;nbsp;Hz with roll-off) causes errors. The low roll-off during measurement of actual frequency of acoustic cycles results in miscalculation due to actual hydraulic cycles in the possible ranges of 1–1000&amp;nbsp;MHz or higher. Instrumentation systems are most revealing when cycle bandwidths exceed the actual measured cycles by a factor of 10 to 100. Associated instrumentation costs also increase by factors of 10 to 100.

Most moving hydro-mechanical components cycle at 0–50&amp;nbsp;Hz, but entrained gas bubbles resulting in a foamy condition of the associated [[hydraulic fluid]] results in actual hydraulic cycles that can exceed 1000&amp;nbsp;MHz even if the moving mechanical components do not cycle at the higher cycle frequency.

[[File:Salarom Sabah Frame-of-a-new-house-01.jpg|upright=1.35|thumb|The erection of a wooden frame in [[Sabah|Sabah, Malaysia]]]]

'''Framing''', in [[construction]], is the fitting together of pieces to give a structure support and shape.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary Second Edition on CD-ROM (v. 4.0) © Oxford University Press 2009. Frame, Framing, Framer, Framework, Frame-house.&lt;/ref&gt; Framing materials are usually [[wood]], [[engineered wood]], or [[structural steel]]. The alternative to framed construction is generally called ''mass wall'' construction, where horizontal layers of stacked materials such as [[log building]], [[masonry]], [[rammed earth]], [[adobe]], etc. are used without framing.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

Building framing is divided into two broad categories,&lt;ref&gt;Townsend, Gilbert. Carpentry and joinery: a practical treatise on simple building construction, including framing, roof construction, general carpentry work, and exterior and interior finish of buildings. Chicago: American Technical Society, 1913. Print. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; '''heavy-frame construction''' (heavy framing) if the vertical supports are few and heavy such as in [[timber framing]], [[pole building framing]], or [[Steel frame|steel framing]]; or '''light-frame construction''' (light-framing) if the supports are more numerous and smaller called '''light-frame construction''', for example balloon, platform and light-steel framing. Light-frame construction using standardized [[dimensional lumber]] has become the dominant construction method in [[North America]] and [[Australia]] due to the economy of the method; use of minimal structural material allows builders to enclose a large area at minimal cost while achieving a wide variety of architectural styles.

Modern light-frame structures usually gain strength from rigid panels ([[plywood]] and other plywood-like composites such as [[oriented strand board]] (OSB) used to form all or part of wall sections), but until recently [[carpenter]]s employed various forms of diagonal bracing to stabilize walls. Diagonal bracing remains a vital interior part of many roof systems, and in-wall wind braces are required by building codes in many municipalities or by individual [[U.S. state|state law]]s in the United States. Special framed [[shear wall]]s are becoming more common to help buildings meet the requirements of [[earthquake engineering]] and [[wind engineering]].

== History ==
Historically, people fitted naturally shaped wooden poles together as framework and then began using joints to connect the timbers, a method today called ''traditional timber framing''' or log framing. In the United states, timber framing was superseded by '''balloon framing''' beginning in the 1830s. Balloon framing makes use of many lightweight wall members called [[Wall stud|studs]] rather than fewer, heavier supports called posts; balloon framing components are nailed together rather than fitted using [[Woodworking joints|joinery]]. The studs in a balloon frame extend two stories from sill to plate. '''Platform framing''' superseded balloon framing and is the standard wooden framing method today. The name comes from each floor level being framed as a separate unit or platform.

Framed construction was rarely used in Scandinavia before the 20th century because of the abundant availability of wood, an abundance of cheap labour, and the superiority of the thermal insulation of logs; hence timber framing took off there first for unheated buildings such as farm buildings, outbuldings and summer villas, and for houses only with the development of wall insulation.&lt;ref&gt;Harri Hautajärvi, "Houses in Finland", Helsinki: Rakennustieto, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Walls ==
Wall framing in house construction includes the vertical and horizontal members of exterior walls and interior partitions, both of [[bearing wall]]s and non-bearing walls. These ''stick members'', referred to as [[Wall stud|stud]]s, [[wall plate]]s and [[lintel]]s (sometimes called ''headers''), serve as a nailing base for all covering material and support the upper floor platforms, which provide the lateral strength along a wall. The platforms may be the boxed structure of a [[ceiling]] and roof, or the ceiling and [[floor]] [[joist]]s of the story above.&lt;ref name = wall&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the building trades, the technique is variously referred to as ''stick and frame'', ''stick and platform'', or ''stick and box'', as the sticks (studs) give the structure its vertical support, and the box-shaped floor sections with joists contained within length-long [[post and lintel]]s (more commonly called ''headers''), support the weight of whatever is above, including the next wall up and the roof above the top story. The platform also provides the lateral support against wind and holds the stick walls true and square. Any lower platform supports the weight of the platforms and walls above the level of its component headers and joists.

Framing [[lumber]] is subject to [[Lumber#Grades and standards|regulated standards]] that require a grade-stamp, and a moisture content not exceeding 19%.&lt;ref name=insu&gt;

There are three historically common methods of framing a house.
* [[Post and Beam|Post and beam]], which is now used predominantly in barn construction.
* Balloon framing using a technique suspending floors from the walls was common until the late 1940s, but since that time, [[platform framing]] has become the predominant form of house construction.&lt;ref name="plat"&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Platform framing often forms wall sections horizontally on the sub-floor prior to erection, easing positioning of studs and increasing accuracy while cutting the necessary manpower. The top and bottom plates are end-nailed to each stud with two nails at least {{convert|3.25|in|mm|abbr=on}} in length (''16d'' or ''16 penny'' nails). Studs are at least doubled (creating posts) at openings, the jack stud being cut to receive the lintels(headers) that are placed and end-nailed through the outer studs.&lt;ref name = plat/&gt;

Wall sheathing, usually a plywood or other laminate, is usually applied to the framing prior to erection, thus eliminating the need to [[scaffolding|scaffold]], and again increasing speed and cutting manpower needs and expenses. Some types of exterior sheathing, such as asphalt-impregnated [[fiberboard]], [[plywood]], [[oriented strand board]] and [[waferboard]], will provide adequate bracing to resist lateral loads and keep the wall square. (Construction codes in most jurisdictions require a stiff plywood sheathing.) Others, such as rigid glass-fiber, asphalt-coated fiberboard, [[polystyrene]] or [[polyurethane]] board, will not.&lt;ref name = wall/&gt; In this latter case, the wall should be reinforced with a diagonal wood or metal bracing inset into the studs.&lt;ref name = wallsec/&gt; In jurisdictions subject to strong wind storms (hurricane countries, [[tornado alley]]s) local codes or state law will generally require both the diagonal [[wind brace]]s and the stiff exterior sheathing regardless of the type and kind of outer weather resistant coverings.

=== Corners ===
A multiple-stud post made up of at least three studs, or the equivalent, is generally used at exterior corners and intersections to secure a good tie between adjoining walls, and to provide nailing support for interior finishes and exterior sheathing. [[wikt:corner|Corner]]s and intersections, however, must be framed with at least two studs.&lt;ref name = load/&gt;

Nailing support for the edges of the ceiling is required at the junction of the wall and ceiling where partitions run parallel to the ceiling joists. This material is commonly referred to as ''dead wood'' or backing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Oide, K. |title= Joining and fixing structure for ceiling boards and paneling|version= |publisher= US Patent 4,057,947 |year= 1977 |url= http://www.google.com/patents?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;vid=USPAT4057947&amp;id=RLsyAAAAEBAJ&amp;oi=fnd |accessdate= March 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Exterior wall studs ===
Wall framing in house [[construction]] includes the vertical and horizontal members of exterior walls and interior partitions. These members, referred to as [[wall stud|stud]]s, wall plates and lintels, serve as a nailing base for all covering material and support the upper floors, ceiling and roof.&lt;ref name = wall/&gt;

Exterior wall studs are the vertical members to which the wall sheathing and [[Cladding (construction)|cladding]] are attached.&lt;ref name = ext&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Kosny, J. |author2=Desjarlais, A.O. |title= Influence of Architectural Details on the Overall Thermal Performance of Residential Wall Systems | work = [[Journal of Building Physics]] |year= 1994 |url= http://jen.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/18/1/53 |accessdate= March 3, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are supported on a bottom plate or foundation sill and in turn support the top plate. Studs usually consist of {{convert|1.5|x|3.5|in}} or {{convert|1.5|x|5.5|in|mm|abbr=on}} lumber and are commonly spaced at {{convert|16|in|mm|abbr=on}} on center. This spacing may be changed to {{convert|12|or|24|in|mm|abbr=on}} on center depending on the [[structural load|load]] and the limitations imposed by the type and thickness of the wall covering used. Wider {{convert|1.5|x|5.5|in|mm|abbr=on}} studs may be used to provide space for more [[building insulation|insulation]]. Insulation beyond that which can be accommodated within a {{convert|3.5|in|mm|abbr=on}} stud space can also be provided by other means, such as rigid or semi-rigid insulation or batts between {{convert|1.5|x|1.5|in|mm|abbr=on}} horizontal [[furring|furring strips]], or rigid or semi-rigid insulation sheathing to the outside of the studs. The studs are attached to horizontal top and bottom wall plates of {{convert|1.5|in|mm|abbr=on}} lumber that are the same width as the studs.&lt;ref name = insu/&gt;

=== Interior partitions ===
Interior partitions supporting [[floor]], ceiling or roof loads are called loadbearing walls; others are called non-loadbearing or simply partitions. Interior loadbearing walls are framed in the same way as exterior walls. Studs are usually {{convert|1.5|x|3.5|in|mm|abbr=on}} lumber spaced at {{convert|16|in|mm|abbr=on}} on center. This spacing may be changed to {{convert|12|or|24|in|mm|abbr=on}} depending on the loads supported and the type and thickness of the wall finish used.&lt;ref name = load&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Sherwood, G. |author2=Moody, R.C. |title= Light-Frame Wall and Floor Systems |version= |publisher= United States Department of Agriculture Forest Service Forest Products|url= http://www.fpl.fs.fed.us/documnts/fplgtr/fplgtr59.pdf |format= PDF |accessdate= March 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Partitions can be built with {{convert|1.5|x|2.5|in|mm|abbr=on}} or {{convert|1.5|x|3.5|in|mm|abbr=on}} studs spaced at {{convert|16|or|24|in|mm|abbr=on}} on center depending on the type and thickness of the wall finish used. Where a partition does not contain a swinging door, {{convert|1.5|x|3.5|in|mm|abbr=on}} studs at {{convert|16|in|mm|abbr=on}} on center are sometimes used with the wide face of the stud [[parallel (geometry)|parallel]] to the wall. This is usually done only for partitions enclosing clothes closets or cupboards to save space. Since there is no vertical load to be supported by partitions, single studs may be used at door openings. The top of the opening may be bridged with a single piece of {{convert|1.5|in|mm|abbr=on}} lumber the same width as the studs. These members provide a nailing support for wall finish, door frames and [[Molding (decorative)|trim]].&lt;ref name = load/&gt;

=== Lintels (headers) ===
Lintels (or, headers) are the horizontal members placed over window, door and other openings to carry loads to the adjoining studs.&lt;ref name = wall/&gt; Lintels are usually constructed of two pieces of 2&amp;nbsp;in (nominal) (38&amp;nbsp;mm) lumber separated with spacers to the width of the studs and nailed together to form a single unit. The preferable spacer material is rigid insulation.&lt;ref name = ext/&gt; The depth of a lintel is determined by the width of the opening and vertical loads supported.

=== Wall sections ===
The complete wall sections are then raised and put in place, temporary braces added and the bottom plates nailed through the subfloor to the floor framing members. The braces should have their larger dimension on the vertical and should permit adjustment of the vertical position of the wall.&lt;ref name = wallsec&gt;{{cite book |author= Anderson, LeRoy Oscar |title= Wood – Frame House Construction |publisher= Books for Business |year= 1992 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=9ZDpdupFBoQC&amp;pg=RA1-PA11#PRA1-PA41,M1 | isbn= 9780894991677 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once the assembled sections are plumbed, they are nailed together at the corners and intersections. A strip of [[polyethylene]] is often placed between the interior walls and the exterior wall, and above the first top plate of interior walls before the second top plate is applied to attain continuity of the [[air barrier]] when polyethylene is serving this function.&lt;ref name = wallsec/&gt;

A second top plate, with joints offset at least one stud space away from the joints in the plate beneath, is then added. This second top plate usually laps the first plate at the corners and partition intersections and, when nailed in place, provides an additional tie to the framed walls. Where the second top plate does not lap the plate immediately underneath at corner and partition intersections, these may be tied with {{convert|0.036|in|mm|abbr=on}} galvanized steel plates at least {{convert|3|in|mm|abbr=on}} wide and {{convert|6|in|mm|abbr=on}} long, nailed with at least three {{convert|2.5|in|mm|abbr=on}} nails to each wall.&lt;ref name = wallsec/&gt;

== Balloon framing ==
[[File:Balloon frame.jpg|right|300px]]
Balloon framing is a method of [[wood]] construction{{spaced ndash}} also known as "Chicago construction" in the 19th century&lt;ref name="McPherson1988"&gt;{{cite book|author=James M. McPherson|page=17|title=Battle Cry of Freedom: The Civil War Era|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a3nX48n4oeIC|date=16 June 1988|publisher=Ballantine Books USA|isbn=978-0-19-503863-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{spaced ndash}} used primarily in areas rich in [[softwood]] forests: [[Scandinavia]], [[Canada]], the [[United States]] up until the mid-1950s, and around [[Thetford Forest]] in [[Norfolk, England]]. It uses long continuous framing members (studs) that run from the  [[sill plate]] to the top plate, with intermediate floor structures let into and nailed to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = A Visual Dictionary of Architecture | first = Francis D. K. | last = Ching | publisher = [[Van Nostrand Reinhold Company]] | year = 1995 | isbn= 0-442-02462-2 | page = 267 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Holske |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fiNGAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA4|first=Louis R. |title= The Specification Desk –  A Department for Specification Writers –  What the Specification Writer Wants to Know |journal= [[Pencil Points]]|volume= II| issue = 6 |date=June 1921 |pages=228–229}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Here the heights of window sills, headers and next floor height would be marked out on the studs with a [[storey pole|story pole]]. Once popular when long lumber was plentiful, balloon framing has been largely replaced by ''platform framing''.

It is not certain who introduced balloon framing in the United States. However, the first building using balloon framing was possibly a warehouse constructed in 1832 in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]], by [[George Washington Snow]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= City of the Century – The Epic of Chicago and the Making of America|last= Miller |first= Donald L.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N0TNXWkIf0wC|year= 1996|publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]]|location= New York City|isbn= 0-684-83138-4|page= 84 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Architectural critic [[Sigfried Giedion]] cited Chicago architect [[John M. Van Osdel]]'s 1880s attribution, as well as A. T. Andreas' 1885 ''History of Chicago,'' to credit Snow as 'inventor of the balloon frame method'.&lt;ref name="Mumford1952"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-first=Lewis|editor1-last= Mumford|title=Roots of contemporary American architecture: a series of thirty-seven essays dating from the mid-nineteenth century to the present|chapter= The Balloon Frame and Industrialization|first=Sigried|last=Gideon|pages=201-205|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=18RPAAAAMAAJ|year=1952|publisher=Reinhold}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1833, Augustine Taylor (1796–1891) constructed St. Mary's Catholic Church in [[Chicago]] using the balloon framing method. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
In the 1830s, [[Hoosier]] Solon Robinson published articles about a revolutionary new framing system, called "balloon framing" by later builders. Robinson's system called for standard 2x4 lumber, nailed together to form a sturdy, light skeleton. Builders were reluctant to adopt the new technology, however, by the 1880s, some form of 2x4 framing was standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Alternatively, a precursor to the balloon frame may have been used by the French in Missouri as much as thirty-one years earlier.&lt;ref name="americanheritage.com"&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.academia.edu/994874/Who_invented_your_house_text_only_|title = Who Invented Your House?|work = Who invented your house (text only) {{!}} Ted Cavanagh - Academia.edu|accessdate = February 23, 2016|date = 1999|publisher = American Heritage of Invention and  Technology Magazine|last = Cavanagh|first = Ted}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name comes from a French Missouri type of construction, ''maison en [[:fr:Boulin (maçonnerie)|boulin]]'',&lt;ref name="americanheritage.com"/&gt; ''boulin'' being a French term for a horizontal scaffolding support. Historians have also fabricated the following story:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Gingerbread Age –  A View of Victorian American|last= Maass |first= John |year= 1957|publisher=[[Crown Publishers]]|location= New York City |isbn= 0-517-01965-5|page= 140 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As Taylor was constructing his first such building, St. Mary's Church, in 1833, skilled carpenters looked on at the comparatively thin framing members, all held together with nails, and declared this method of construction to be no more substantial than a balloon. It would surely blow over in the next wind! Though the criticism proved baseless, the name stuck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Woodward's Country Homes|last= Woodward |first= George Evertson |year= 1865|publisher= Geo. E. Woodward|location= New York City|isbn= 1-112-22157-3&lt;!-- (for the 2009 reprint edition)--&gt;|pages=151–152}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although lumber was plentiful in 19th-century America, skilled labor was not. The advent of cheap machine-made nails, along with water-powered sawmills in the early 19th century made balloon framing highly attractive, because it did not require highly skilled carpenters, as did the [[dovetail joint]]s, [[Mortise and tenon|mortises and tenons]] required by [[post-and-beam construction]]. For the first time, any farmer could build his own buildings without a time-consuming learning curve.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, Salon. "How to Build Balloon Frames". ''Transactions of the American Institute of the City of New York for the year 1854'' no. 144. Albany:C. Van Benthuysen, 1855. 405-408. https://books.google.com/books?id=MyU2AQAAIAAJ&amp;pg accessed January 10, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been said that balloon framing populated the western United States and the western provinces of Canada. Without it, western boomtowns certainly could not have blossomed overnight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Culture and Democracy: The Struggle for Form in Society and Architecture in Chicago and the Middle West during the Life and Times of Louis H.

However, balloon framing did require very long studs and as tall trees were exhausted in the 1920s, platform framing became prevalent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Wagner |first1=Kate |title=The Case for Rooms |url=https://www.citylab.com/design/2018/08/the-case-for-rooms/563216/ |accessdate=13 August 2018 |work=[[The Atlantic#CityLab|CityLab]] |date=6 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Jim Kaney Round Barn, Adeline, IL 01.JPG|thumb|An unusual example of balloon framing: The Jim Kaney Round Barn, Adeline, Illinois, U.S.A.]]
The main difference between platform and balloon framing is at the floor lines. The balloon wall [[Wall stud|studs]] extend from the sill of the first story all the way to the [[top plate]] or [[Rafter|end rafter]] of the second story. The platform-framed wall, on the other hand, is independent for each floor.&lt;ref&gt;Framing floors, walls, and ceilings. Newtown, CT: Taunton Press, 2005. 118. {{ISBN|1561587583}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Materials ==
Light-frame materials are most often wood or rectangular steel, tubes or C-channels. Wood pieces are typically connected with nail fastener nails or screws; steel pieces are connected with nuts and bolts. Preferred species for linear structural members are softwoods such as spruce, pine and fir. Light frame material dimensions range from {{convert|38|by|89|mm|in|abbr=on}}; i.e., a Dimensional number two-by-four to 5&amp;nbsp;cm by 30&amp;nbsp;cm (two-by-twelve inches) at the cross-section, and lengths ranging from {{convert|2.5|m|ft}} for walls to {{convert|7|m|ft}} or more for joists and rafters. Recently, architects have begun experimenting with pre-cut modular aluminum framing to reduce on-site construction costs.

Wall panels built of studs are interrupted by sections that provide rough openings for [[door]]s and [[window]]s. Openings are typically spanned by a header or lintel that bears the weight of structure above the opening. Headers are usually built to rest on [[trimmer (construction)|trimmer]]s, also called jacks. Areas around windows are defined by a sill beneath the window, and cripples, which are shorter studs that span the area from the bottom plate to the sill and sometimes from the top of the window to a header, or from a header to a top plate. Diagonal bracings made of wood or steel provide shear (horizontal strength) as do panels of sheeting nailed to studs, sills and headers. {{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

[[File:Light gage metal framing.JPG|thumb|225px|left|Light-gauge metal stud framing]]

Wall sections usually include a bottom plate which is secured to the structure of a floor, and one, or more often two top plates that tie walls together and provide a bearing for structures above the wall. Wood or steel floor frames usually include a [[rim joist]] around the perimeter of a system of floor joists, and often include bridging material near the center of a span to prevent lateral buckling of the spanning members. In two-story construction, openings are left in the floor system for a stairwell, in which stair risers and treads are most often attached to squared faces cut into sloping stair stringers.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

Interior wall coverings in light-frame construction typically include [[drywall|wallboard]], [[lath and plaster]] or decorative [[frame and panel|wood paneling]].{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

Exterior finishes for walls and ceilings often include plywood or [[composite material|composite]] sheathing, [[brick]] or [[Rock (geology)|stone]] [[Masonry#Veneer masonry|veneer]]s, and various [[stucco]] finishes. Cavities between studs, usually placed {{convert|40|–|60|cm|in|abbr=on}} apart, are usually filled with [[Thermal insulation|insulation]] materials, such as [[fiberglass]] batting, or [[cellulose]] filling sometimes made of [[recycled]] [[newsprint]] treated with [[boron]] additives for [[fire]] prevention and [[vermin]] control. {{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

In [[natural building]], [[straw-bale construction|straw bales]], [[cob (material)|cob]] and [[adobe]] may be used for both exterior and interior walls.

The part of a structural building that goes diagonally across a wall is called a T-bar. It stops the walls from collapsing in gusty winds. {{citation needed|date=September 2011}}{{clear left}}

== Roofs ==
{{main article|Roof}}

[[File:LeBlanc Roofing.jpg|thumb|280px|right|A construction worker roofing a home in [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]], [[Arizona]].]]
[[File:Photography by Victor Albert Grigas (1919-2017) 00139 (23702821578).jpg|thumb|right|200px|A roof being framed in the United States circa 1955]]

[[Roof]]s are usually built to provide a sloping surface intended to shed rain or snow, with slopes ranging from 1:15 (less than an inch per linear foot of horizontal span), to steep slopes of more than 2:1. A light-frame structure built mostly inside sloping walls which also serve as a roof is called an [[A-frame house|A-frame]].

Roofs are most often &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Common Roofing Materials|url=http://www.arcbac.org/i4a/pages/index.cfm?pageid=3347 |work=Associated Roofing Contractors of the Bay Area Counties|publisher=arcbac.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; covered with [[roof shingle|shingle]]s made of asphalt, fiberglass and small gravel coating, but a wide range of materials are used. Molten [[tar]] is often used to waterproof flatter roofs, but newer materials include rubber and synthetic materials. [[Steel]] panels are popular roof coverings in some areas, preferred for their durability. [[Slate]] or [[tile]] roofs offer more historic coverings for light-frame roofs.

Light-frame methods allow easy construction of unique roof designs; hip roofs, for example, slope toward walls on all sides and are joined at hip rafters that span from corners to a ridge. Valleys are formed when two sloping roof sections drain toward each other. [[Dormer]]s are small areas in which vertical walls interrupt a roof line, and which are topped off by slopes at usually [[right angle]]s to a main roof section. [[Gable]]s are formed when a length-wise section of sloping roof ends to form a triangular wall section. [[Clerestory|Clerestories]] are formed by an interruption along the slope of a roof where a short vertical wall connects it to another roof section. Flat roofs, which usually include at least a nominal slope to shed water, are often surrounded by parapet walls with openings (called [[scupper]]s) to allow water to drain out. Sloping [[Cricket (roofing)|crickets]] are built into roofs to direct water away from areas of poor drainage, such as behind a chimney at the bottom of a sloping section.

== Structure ==
Light-frame buildings are often erected on [[Monolithic architecture|monolithic]] concrete-slab foundations that serve both as a floor and as a support for the structure. Other light-frame buildings are built over a crawlspace or a [[basement]], with wood or steel joists used to span between foundation walls, usually constructed of poured concrete or [[Concrete masonry unit|concrete block]]s.

Engineered components are commonly used to form floor, ceiling and roof structures in place of solid wood. [[I-joist]]s (closed-web trusses) are often made from laminated woods, most often chipped [[populus|poplar]] wood, in panels as thin as {{convert|1|cm|in|abbr=on}}, glued between horizontally laminated members of less than 4&amp;nbsp;cm by 4&amp;nbsp;cm (''two-by-twos''), to span distances of as much as {{convert|9|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Open web trussed joists and rafters are often formed of 4&amp;nbsp;cm by 9&amp;nbsp;cm (''two-by-four'') wood members to provide support for floors, roofing systems and ceiling finishes.

Platform framing was traditionally limited to four floors but some jurisdictions have modified their building codes to allow up to six floors with added fire protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lewington|first1=Jennifer|title=Six-storey wood buildings ‘a game-changer’|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/industry-news/property-report/six-storey-wood-buildings-a-game-changer/article21850652/|accessdate=May 2, 2016|work=[[The Globe and Mail]]|date=December 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Blown Fuse Cutout 640.jpg|thumb|250 px|right| A set of pole top cutouts protecting a transformer on a 12.47 kV distribution line. One fuse is blown and the white tube is hanging down]]
In [[electrical distribution]], a '''fuse cutout''' or '''cut-out fuse''' is a combination of a [[Fuse (electrical)|fuse]] and a switch, used in primary overhead feeder lines and taps to protect [[distribution transformer]]s from [[Electric current|current]] surges and overloads.  An overcurrent caused by a fault in the transformer or customer circuit will cause the fuse to melt, disconnecting the transformer from the line.  It can also be opened manually by [[Lineman (technician)|utility linemen]] standing on the ground and using a long insulating stick called a "[[hot stick]]".

==Components==
A cutout consists of three major components:

*The '''cutout body''', an open "C"-shaped frame that supports the fuse holder and a ribbed porcelain or polymer insulator that electrically isolates the conductive portions of the assembly from the support to which the insulator is fastened.
*The '''fuse holder''', also called the "fuse tube" or "door", an insulating tube which contains the replaceable fuse element.  When the contained fuse melts ("blows"), it opens the circuit, and the fuse holder drops out of the upper contact and hangs from a hinge on its lower end.  This hanging fuse holder provides a visible indication that the fuse has operated and assurance that the circuit is open. The circuit can also be opened manually by pulling out the fuse holder using a hot stick.
*The '''fuse element''', or "fuse link", is the replaceable portion of the assembly that melts and breaks the circuit when the electric current through it exceeds its rated current value.

The fuse holder may be replaced by a solid blade, which would allow the fuse holder assembly to be used as a switch only.

==Construction==
The fuse elements used in most distribution cutouts are [[tin]] or silver alloy wires that melt when subjected to high enough current.   Ampere ratings of fuse elements vary from 1 ampere to 200 amperes.

Cutouts are typically mounted about 20 degrees off vertical so that the center of gravity of the fuse holder is displaced and the fuse holder will rotate and fall open under its own weight when the fuse blows.  Mechanical tension on the fuse link normally holds an ejector spring in a stable position.  When the fuse blows, the released spring pulls the stub of the fuse link out of the fuse holder tube to reduce surge duration and damage to the transformer and fuse holder.  This quenches any [[Electrical arc|arc]] in the fuse holder.

Each fuse holder typically has an attached pull ring that can be engaged by a hook at the end of a fiberglass hot stick operated by a lineworker standing on the ground or from a [[bucket truck]], to manually open the switch.  While often used for switching, the standard cutout shown is not designed to be manually opened under load.  For applications where the switch is likely to be used to interrupt power manually, a "load break" version is available that has an attachment to quench the arc.

==Standards==
Up until the mid-1990s each manufacturer used their own dimensional standards for cutout design; by the late 1990s most cutouts were of an "interchangeable design". This design allows for the interchangeable use of cutout bodies and fuse holders manufactured by different vendors.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2334">'''Greenpeace Foundation''' is an environmental organization based in [[Hawaii]]. It was officially founded in 1976 as an independent offshoot of the Canadian Greenpeace Foundation and was the first Greenpeace in the [[United States]]. When the original Vancouver-based Greenpeace Foundation later evolved to [[Greenpeace International]] the Hawaii-based Greenpeace Foundation declined to join them, and remains an unaffiliated organisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenpeacefoundation.org/about/gpfaq.cfm|publisher=Greenpeace Foundation|title=GPFDN Frequently Asked Questions|year=2010|accessdate=2012-11-16|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130414205907/http://www.greenpeacefoundation.org/about/gpfaq.cfm|archivedate=2013-04-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenpeacefoundation.org/about/gpMovement.cfm|publisher=Greenpeace Foundation|title=The Greenpeace Movement|year=2010|accessdate=2012-11-16|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615041919/http://www.greenpeacefoundation.org/about/gpmovement.cfm|archivedate=2011-06-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The greenpeace movement grew out of the "peace" and "environmental" movements in the early 1970s. Back then, it looked likely that the planet was going to be subjected to a nuclear war. The Canadian "Don't Make a Wave" committee formed to protest US tectonic nuclear testing at Amchitka in the Aleutian Islands and later the French atmospheric testing at Mururoa in French Polynesia. The phrase "green peace" was used as a slogan to describe the ideals of those activists, who envisioned a healthy (green) and peaceful (peace) planet as a good thing. By about 1973, the phrase had been shortened to a word, Greenpeace, and an organization called "Greenpeace Foundation" was established in Vancouver, Canada. It was this ragtag group of idealists and visionaries who first did an at-sea protest of whaling in 1975 and conducted the high-profile campaign against the clubbing of baby harp seals off Newfoundland beginning in 1976.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4391">{{Other uses|Helmholtz theorem (disambiguation)}}
In [[fluid mechanics]], '''Helmholtz's theorems''', named after [[Hermann von Helmholtz]], describe the three-dimensional motion of fluid in the vicinity of [[vortex]] filaments. These theorems apply to [[inviscid flow]]s and flows where the influence of [[viscosity|viscous forces]] are small and can be ignored.

Helmholtz’s three theorems are as follows:&lt;ref&gt;Kuethe and Schetzer, ''Foundations of Aerodynamics'', Section 2.14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
'''Helmholtz’s first theorem:'''&lt;br /&gt;
:''The strength of a vortex filament is constant along its length.''
'''Helmholtz’s second theorem:'''&lt;br /&gt;
:''A vortex filament cannot end in a fluid; it must extend to the boundaries of the fluid or form a closed path.''
'''Helmholtz’s third theorem:'''&lt;br /&gt;
:''In the absence of rotational external forces, a fluid that is initially irrotational remains irrotational.''

Helmholtz’s theorems apply to inviscid flows.  In observations of vortices in real fluids the strength of the vortices always decays gradually due to the dissipative effect of [[Viscosity|viscous forces]].

Alternative expressions of the three theorems are as follows:&lt;br /&gt;
1. The strength of a vortex tube does not vary with time.&lt;ref&gt;
The strength of a vortex tube ([[Circulation (fluid dynamics)|circulation]]), is defined as:
: &lt;math&gt;\Gamma = \int_{A} \vec{\omega} \cdot \vec{n} dA = \oint_{c} \vec{u} \cdot d\vec{s} &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\Gamma&lt;/math&gt; is also the circulation, &lt;math&gt;\vec{\omega}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[vorticity]] [[Vector (geometric)|vector]], &lt;math&gt;\vec{n}&lt;/math&gt; is the normal vector to a surface '''A''', formed by taking a cross-section of the vortex-tube with elemental area '''dA''', &lt;math&gt;\vec{u}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[velocity]] vector on the closed curve '''C''', which bounds the surface '''A'''. The convention for defining the sense of circulation and the normal to the surface '''A''' is given by the [[right-hand rule|right-hand screw rule]]. The third theorem states that this strength is the same for all cross-sections A of the tube and is independent of time. This is equivalent to saying
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{D \Gamma}{Dt} = 0&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
2. Fluid elements lying on a vortex line at some instant continue to lie on that vortex line. More simply, vortex lines move with the fluid.  Also vortex lines and tubes must appear as a closed loop, extend to infinity or start/end at solid boundaries.&lt;br /&gt;
3. Fluid elements initially free of vorticity remain free of vorticity.

'''Helmholtz’s theorems''' have application in understanding:
:[[Lift (force)#Stages of lift production|Generation of lift]] on an [[airfoil]]
:[[Starting vortex]]
:[[Horseshoe vortex]]
:[[Wingtip vortices]].

'''Helmholtz’s theorems''' are now generally proven with reference to [[Kelvin's circulation theorem]].  However the Helmholtz's theorems were published in 1858,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Helmholtz|first=H.|title=Über Integrale der hydrodynamischen Gleichungen, welche den Wirbelbewegungen entsprechen.|url=https://eudml.org/doc/147720|journal=Journal für die reine und angewandte Mathematik|language=en|volume=55|issn=0075-4102}}&lt;/ref&gt; nine years before the 1867 publication of Kelvin's theorem. There was much communication between the two men on the subject of vortex lines, with many references to the application of their theorems to the study of [[smoke ring]]s.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6474">'''IGNITOR''' is the Italian name for a nuclear research project of [[magnetic confinement fusion]], developed by [[ENEA (Italy)|ENEA]] Laboratories in [[Frascati]]. Construction (in Russia) is not complete.

The project theory is based on ignited plasma in [[tokamak]]. Started in 1977 by Prof. [[Bruno Coppi]] of [[MIT]], IGNITOR is based on the 1970s [[Alcator]] machine at MIT which pioneered the high magnetic field approach to plasma magnetic confinement, continued with the [[Alcator C-Mod|Alcator C/C-Mod]] at MIT and the [[FT/FTU]] series of experiments.  

Compared to the [[ITER]] international project, IGNITOR would be much smaller and cheaper: the ITER reactor is 19,000 tons{{vague|which tons?|date=January 2010}} in weight while the IGNITOR is only 500 tons in weight. IGNITOR is designed to produce approximately 100 [[Megawatt|MW]] of fusion power (and ITER to produce ~500 MW fusion power).

==Development==
At a meeting with the scientific attachés of the European embassies in Moscow in early February 2010 [[Mikhail Kovalchuk]], Director of the [[Kurchatov Institute]],  announced that an initiative aimed at developing a fast paced joint research programme in nuclear fusion research was strongly supported by the Governments of Russia and Italy.

The original proposal had been initiated earlier by [[Evgeny Velikhov]] (President of the Kurchatov Institute) and Bruno Coppi (Head of the High Energy Plasmas Undertaking, MIT) during the early developments of the [[Alcator C-Mod]] programme at MIT, where well known scientists of the Kurchatov Institute made key contributions to experiments that identified the unique confinement and purity properties of the high density plasmas produced by the high field Alcator machine. In effects this investigated, for the first time, physical processes leading to attain self-sustained fusion burning plasmas.

The collaboration with the Kurchatov Institute is directed at the construction of the Ignitor machine, the first experiment proposed to achieve ignition conditions by nuclear fusion reactions on the basis of existing knowledge of plasma physics and available technologies. Ignitor is part of the line of research on high magnetic field, experiments producing high density plasmas that began with the Alcator and the Frascati Torus programs at MIT and in Italy, respectively. It remains, at the world level, the only experiment capable of reaching ignition by the magnetic field confinement approach. However, several fusion scientists have contested the claim made for IGNITOR that it is a bigger step towards fusion power than the international [[ITER]] project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal
 | doi = 10.1038/news.2010.214
| title = Fusion reactor aims to rival ITER
| journal = Nature
| date = 2010
| last1 = Feresin | first1 = Emiliano 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to existing plans, Ignitor will be installed at the Triniti site at [[Troitsk, Moscow Oblast|Troitsk]] near Moscow that has facilities which can be upgraded to house and operate the machine. This site will become open and made to be easily accessible to scientists of all nations. The management of the relevant research programme will involve Italy and Russia only to facilitate the success of the enterprise. The proponents have suggested that the [[United States|US]] become an Associate Member of this effort with a similar arrangement to that made with [[CERN]] for its participation in the [[Large Hadron Collider|LHC]] (Large Hadron Collider) Programme.

The goal to produce meaningful fusion reactors in a reasonable time leads to pursuing the achievement of ignition conditions in the near term in order to understand the plasma physical regimes needed for a net power producing reactor. In addition, an objective other than ignition that can be envisioned for the relatively near term is that of high flux neutron sources for material testing involving compact, high density fusion machines. This has been one of the incentives that have led the Ignitor Project to adopt [[magnesium diboride]] (MgB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) superconducting cables in the machine design, a first in fusion research. Accordingly, the largest coils (about 5 m diameter) of the machine will be made entirely of MgB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cables.

In the context of the Italy-Russia summit meeting held in Milan on 26 April 2010&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legnostorto.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=28544&amp;Itemid=46&lt;/ref&gt; the agreement to proceed with the proposed joint Ignitor program has been signed. The participants, from the Russian side, have included the Prime Minister [[Vladimir Putin]], the Deputy Prime Minister [[Igor Sechin]], the Energy Minister [[Sergei Shmatko]], and the Vice Minister of Education and Research Sergey Mazurenko. Participants from the Italian side have included Prime Minister [[Silvio Berlusconi]], the Foreign Affairs Advisor to the Prime Minister Valentino Valentini (who had a key role in forging the agreement on the Ignitor program), and the Minister of Education and Research [[Mariastella Gelmini]] who, together with Sergey Mazurenko, signed the agreement in the presence of the two Prime Ministers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://banchedati.camera.it/sindacatoispettivo_16/showXhtml.Asp?idAtto=1684&amp;stile=6&amp;highLight=1 Dati Camera dei Deputati]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.corriere.it/esteri/10_aprile_26/putin-berlusconi-incontro-nucleare_d26240c2-5113-11df-884e-00144f02aabe.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2201">The '''isoionic point''' is the [[pH]] value at which a [[zwitterion]] [[molecule]] has an equal number of [[Ion|positive and negative charges]] and no adherent ionic species. It was first defined by [[S.P.L. Sørensen]], [[Kaj Ulrik Linderstrøm-Lang]] and [[Ellen Lund]] in 1926 &lt;ref&gt;Sørensen S.P.L., Linderstrøm-Lang K., and Lund E (1926). 'The influence of salt concentration on the acid-binding capacity of egg-albuminin'.  J. Gen. Physiol., Mar 1927; 8: 543 - 599&lt;/ref&gt; and is mainly a term used in [[protein]] sciences.

It is different from the [[isoelectric point]] (p''I'') in that p''I'' is the pH value at which the net charge of the molecule, ''including'' bound ions is zero. Whereas the isoionic point is at net charge zero in a deionized solution. Thus, the isoelectric and isoionic points are equal when the concentration of charged species is zero.

For a diprotic acid, the hydrogen ion concentration can be found at the isoionic point using the following equation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0307-4412(78)90164-4 | volume=6 | title=The isoionic point of amino acids and proteins | journal=Biochemical Education | pages=14–15 | last1 = Bryan | first1 = William P.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;[H^+]=\sqrt{{K_1 K_2 C + K_1 K_w} \over {K_1 + C}}&lt;/math&gt;

* &lt;math&gt;[H^+]=&lt;/math&gt;hydrogen ion concentration
* &lt;math&gt;K_1=&lt;/math&gt;first acid dissociation constant
* &lt;math&gt;K_2=&lt;/math&gt;second acid dissociation constant
* &lt;math&gt;K_w=&lt;/math&gt;dissociation constant for water
* &lt;math&gt;C=&lt;/math&gt;concentration of the acid

Note that if &lt;math&gt;K_1 K_2 C \gg K_1 K_w&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;K_1 K_2 C + K_1 K_w \approx K_1 K_2 C&lt;/math&gt; and if &lt;math&gt;C \gg K_1&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;K_1 + C \approx C&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, under these conditions, the equation simplifies to

&lt;math&gt;[H^+]=\sqrt{{K_1 K_2 C + K_1 K_w} \over {K_1 + C}} \approx \sqrt{{K_1 K_2 C} \over {C}} \approx \sqrt{K_1 K_2}&lt;/math&gt;

The equation can be further simplified to calculate the pH by taking the negative logarithm of both sides to yield

&lt;math&gt;pH = {{pK_1 + pK_2} \over {2}}&lt;/math&gt;

which shows that under certain conditions, the isoionic and [[isoelectric point]] are similar.

The '''January 1992 nor'easter''' was the second in a series of [[nor'easter]]s in a 14-month period that produced strong winds, high tides, and flooding along the [[East Coast of the United States]]. It was a small, short-lived storm that was poorly forecast, intensifying rapidly on January&amp;nbsp;4 before striking the [[Eastern Shore of Virginia]]. The strongest quadrant of the storm moved over Delaware, and winds in the state reached {{convert|58|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}. The nor'easter weakened as it moved westward, and it dissipated over Virginia before the energy reformed and redeveloped offshore.

In North Carolina, the storm flooded the main highway connecting the [[Outer Banks]]. The nor'easter struck shortly during a new moon, producing high tides that resulted in significant beach erosion along the [[Delmarva Peninsula]]. The highest wind gust was {{convert|89|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}, reported in [[Chincoteague, Virginia]]. The cost of the lost beach near [[Ocean City, Maryland]] was estimated at over $10&amp;nbsp;million (1992&amp;nbsp;[[United States dollar|USD]]). In the city, the storm destroyed the tidal gauge, although the [[storm surge]] was estimated at {{convert|6.6|ft|m|abbr=on}}. The strongest quadrant of the storm moved over Delaware; in the state, strong easterly winds produced significant tidal flooding, and 500&amp;nbsp;houses were damaged. A high tide of {{convert|9.02|ft|m|abbr=on}} at [[Dewey Beach, Delaware|Dewey Beach]] was the second highest tide on record in the entire state. Flooding also affected [[South Jersey]] in many areas that experienced flooding from the [[1991 Perfect Storm]] in the previous October. Damage was estimated at $45&amp;nbsp;million (1992&amp;nbsp;USD). Strong winds reached as far north as [[New York (state)|New York]], where a fallen tree seriously injured a person driving a car. Freezing rain associated with the storm caused a traffic fatality in New York, as well as several accidents in Maine.

==Meteorological history==
On January&amp;nbsp;2, a small [[low pressure area]] developed along the [[East Coast of the United States]]. Due to its small size, the storm was [[weather forecasting|poorly forecast]].&lt;ref name="chl"/&gt; A strong [[cold-core low|upper-level low]] moving through Georgia and South Carolina caused the low to move to the west, perpendicular to the Mid-Atlantic coast.&lt;ref name="dgs"&gt;{{cite report|author=Kelvin W.

Between 0500 and 0700&amp;nbsp;[[Coordinated Universal Time|UTC]] on January&amp;nbsp;4, the storm moved ashore along the [[Eastern Shore of Virginia]],&lt;ref name="dgs"/&gt; about 25&amp;nbsp;mi (40&amp;nbsp;km) south of [[Ocean City, Maryland]].&lt;ref name="dtic"/&gt; It quickly weakened while moving across the [[Delmarva Peninsula]] and it emerged into the [[Chesapeake Bay]] by 1000&amp;nbsp;UTC that day. Three hours later, the storm was stalled over northern Virginia. A secondary low pressure area developed within the overall system further out to sea later on January&amp;nbsp;4.&lt;ref name="dgs"/&gt;

The stronger northeast quadrant moved directly over Delaware for one tidal cycle, producing strong east-northeasterly wind gusts that peaked at {{convert|83|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} at a station along the [[Indian River (Delaware)|Indian River]].&lt;ref name="dgs"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ncdc"/&gt; The highest tides and flooding along the Delaware coastline were between [[Bowers, Delaware|Bowers]] and [[Prime Hook National Wildlife Refuge]], where high waves built momentum from the Atlantic Ocean through the Delaware Bay.&lt;ref name="dgs"/&gt; In Bowers, the tide reached {{convert|8.76|ft|m|abbr=on}} along the [[Murderkill River]]; the reading was only {{convert|2|in|mm|abbr=on}} less than the record set during the [[Ash Wednesday Storm of 1962]]. The high tides flooded marsh vegetation in the town. In [[Lewes, Delaware|Lewes]], the highest tide was {{convert|7.40|ft|m|abbr=on}}, which was the second highest on record; only the 1962 storm was higher, which produced a tide of {{convert|8.05|ft|m|abbr=on}}. The storm caused significant flooding in [[Dewey Beach, Delaware|Dewey Beach]],&lt;ref name="dgs2"/&gt; where a high tide of {{convert|9.02|ft|m|abbr=on}} marked the second-highest tide in Delaware history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Town Dewey Beach, Delaware|title=Storms of the Past|accessdate=2012-03-18|url=http://www.townofdeweybeach.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=trees.pageDetails&amp;p=264-18-359}}&lt;/ref&gt; The saltwater contaminated the town's water supply.&lt;ref name="deseret"&gt;{{cite news|agency=Reuters|newspaper=The Deseret News|date=1992-01-05|title=Coastal storm pummels 2 states|accessdate=2012-03-19|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=wywhAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=xHoFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2542,1267048&amp;dq=storm&amp;hl=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ocean washed over dunes in several locations along Delaware Bay, including in [[Fowler Beach, Delaware|Fowler Beach]] where flooding reached {{convert|20|ft|m|abbr=on}} inland. Near [[Mispillion Light]], the high tides damaged the marina and several nearby buildings.&lt;ref name="dgs"/&gt; The high tides flooded marshes and low-lying areas throughout the state, which briefly closed portions of state highways [[Delaware Route 54|54]], [[Delaware Route 26|26]], and [[Delaware Route 1|1]].&lt;ref name="dgs"/&gt; High tides destroyed 11&amp;nbsp;blocks of the boardwalk in [[Rehoboth Beach, Delaware|Rehoboth Beach]] and half of the promenade at [[Bethany Beach, Delaware|Bethany Beach]].&lt;ref name="book"/&gt;&lt;ref name="deseret"/&gt; At nearby [[South Bethany, Delaware|South Bethany]], high waves destroyed three houses.&lt;ref name="ap15"/&gt; Along the coast, the storm destroyed 15&amp;nbsp;houses and damaged 500&amp;nbsp;others, amounting to over $5&amp;nbsp;million (1992&amp;nbsp;USD) in property damage.&lt;ref name="ncdc"/&gt; In addition to the strong winds and high tides, the nor'easter produced light rainfall that did not cause any flooding. The highest total in the state was {{convert|1.06|in|mm|abbr=on}} in [[Georgetown, Delaware|Georgetown]].&lt;ref name="dgs"/&gt; Due to the damage, [[Kent County, Delaware|Kent]] and [[Sussex County, Delaware|Sussex]] counties were declared federal disaster areas on February&amp;nbsp;6; this allocated federal funding for repairing storm damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Federal Emergency Management Agency |date=2004-10-18 |title=Delaware Severe Coastal Storm: Major Disaster Declared February 6, 1992 (DR-933) |accessdate=2012-03-18 |url=http://www.fema.gov/news/eventcounties.fema?id=2133 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120103143947/http://www.fema.gov/news/eventcounties.fema?id=2133 |archivedate=January 3, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Then-governor [[Michael Castle]] activated the state's [[United States National Guard|National Guard]] to assist clearing highways and prevent civilian access to damaged areas.&lt;ref name="ap15"/&gt; Due to storm damage, access to Dewey Beach and Rehoboth Beach were restricted to residents.&lt;ref name="deseret"/&gt;

Further northeast, the nor'easter produced wind gusts of {{convert|60|mph|km/h|abbr=on}},&lt;ref name="book"/&gt; along with high tides; [[Steel Pier]] in [[Atlantic City, New Jersey|Atlantic City]] reported a peak tide of about {{convert|8|ft|m|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="great"/&gt; The ocean flooded under the boardwalk onto adjacent streets,&lt;ref name="ap15"/&gt; and to the west of the city, flooding closed portions of the [[White Horse Pike]].&lt;ref name="ny15"/&gt; In [[Cape May Point, New Jersey|Cape May Point]], the storm breached dunes that withstood the Perfect Storm, which flooded half of the borough.

==Annex I==

In total, Annex I Parties managed a cut of 3.3% in [[greenhouse gas]] (GHG) emissions between 1990 and 2004 (UNFCCC, 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;11).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

|accessdate=17 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, projections indicated rising emissions of 4.2% between 1990 and 2010. This projection assumed that no further mitigation action would be taken. The reduction in the 1990s was driven significantly by economic restructuring in the economies-in-transition (EITs. See the main [[Kyoto Protocol#Change in greenhouse gas emission since 1990|Kyoto Protocol]] article for the list of EITs). Emission reductions in the EITs had little to do with climate change policy (Carbon Trust, 2009, p.&amp;nbsp;24).&lt;ref name=carbont/&gt; Some reductions in Annex I emissions have occurred due to policy measures, such as promoting energy efficiency (UNFCCC, 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;11).

When he was in the [[Opposition (Australia)|opposition]], Rudd commissioned [[Ross Garnaut]] to [[Garnaut Report|report]] on the economic effects of reducing greenhouse gas emissions. The report was submitted to the [[Australian government]] on 30 September 2008.

The policy of the Rudd government contrasts with that of the [[Howard Government|former Australian government]], which refused to ratify the agreement on the ground that following the protocol would be costly.&lt;ref name="bbc-aus"&gt;{{cite news

====Policy====

Australia's position, under Prime Minister [[John Howard]], was that it did not intend to ratify the treaty (IEA, 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;51).&lt;ref name=ieaaus/&gt; The justification for this was that:
*the treaty did not cover 70% of global emissions;
*developing countries are excluded from emission limitations;
*and the-then largest GHG emitter, the US, had not ratified the treaty.
The Howard government did intend to meet its Kyoto target, but without ratification (IEA, 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;51).

As part of the 2004 budget, A$1.8&amp;nbsp;billion was committed towards its climate change strategy. A$700&amp;nbsp;million was directed towards low-emission technologies (IEA, 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;56). The Howard government, along with the United States, agreed to sign the [[Asia Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate]] at the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations|ASEAN]] regional forum on 28 July 2005. Furthermore, the state of [[New South Wales]] (NSW) commenced the NSW greenhouse gas abatement scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.greenhousegas.nsw.gov.au/
|title=Greenhouse Gas Abatement Scheme
|publisher=NSW Greenhouse Gas Abatement Scheme
|accessdate=31 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; This mandatory scheme of greenhouse gas emissions trading commenced on 1 January 2003 and is currently in trial by the state government in NSW alone. Notably, this scheme allows accredited certificate providers to trade emissions from households in the state. As of 2006, the scheme is still in place despite the outgoing [[John Howard|Prime Minister]]'s clear dismissal of emissions trading as a credible solution to climate change.

Following the example of NSW, the national emissions trading scheme (NETS) has been established as an initiative of state and territory governments of Australia, all of which have Labor Party governments, except Western Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In the later years of the Howard administration (1996–2007), the states governed by the Labor took steps to establish a NETS (a) to take action in a field where there were few mandatory federal steps and (b) as a means of facilitating ratification of the Kyoto Protocol by the incoming Labor government.

In May 2009, Kevin Rudd delayed and changed the carbon pollution reduction scheme:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.climatechange.gov.au/whitepaper/measures/index.html |title=Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme – New measures |publisher=Climatechange.gov.au |date=6 May 2009 |accessdate=21 May 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090517023136/http://www.climatechange.gov.au/whitepaper/measures/index.html |archivedate=17 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the scheme would begin in 2011/2012, a year later than initially scheduled (it had been scheduled to begin on 1 July 2010);
* there would be one-year fixed price of A$10 per permit in 2011/2012 (previously, price was to under the price cap of $40);
* there would be an unlimited amount of permits available from the government in the first year (previously, estimated 300 million tons of [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) was to be auctioned off);
* a higher percentage of permits would be handed out, rather than auctioned off (previously, 60% or 90% of permits were to be handed out);
* compensation would be canceled in 2010/2011 and reduced in 2011/2012;
* households can reduce their carbon footprint by buying and retiring permits into an Australian carbon trust (previously, no such scheme was included);
* subject to an international agreement, Australia would commit to a reduction of 25% from the 2000 level by 2020 (previously, there was to be a reduction of 15%);
* 5% out of the 25% reduction could be achieved by the government purchase of international off-sets (previously, no such scheme was included).

'''Greenpeace'''

[[Greenpeace]] has called clause 3.7 of the Kyoto Protocol the ''"Australia clause"'' on the ground that it unfairly made Australia a major beneficiary. The clause allows annex 1 countries with a high rate of land clearing in 1990 to set the level in that year as a base. Greenpeace argues that since Australia had an extremely high level of land clearing in 1990, Australia's "baseline" was unusually high compared to other countries.&lt;ref name="aust clause"&gt;"[http://www.greenpeace.org/australia/issues/climate-change/solutions/political/kyoto-protocol/Australia Australia and the Kyoto Protocol]", Greenpeace Asia Pacific, accessed 18 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Emissions====

In 2002, Australia represented about 1.5% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (IEA, 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;51).&lt;ref name=ieaaus/&gt; Over the 1990–2002 period, Australia's gross emissions rose by 22%, which was surpassed by only four other [[International Energy Agency]] (IEA) members (IEA, 2005, p.&amp;nbsp;54). This was in large part due to economic growth. Net emissions (including changes in land-use and forestry) increased by 1.3% over this period. In 2005, Australia's GHG emissions&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt; made up 1.2% of the global total (MNP, 2007).&lt;ref name=mnp&gt;{{cite web

{{See also|Canada and the Kyoto Protocol}}

On 17 December 2002, Canada ratified the treaty that came into force in February 2005, requiring it to reduce emissions to 6% below 1990 levels during the 2008–2012 commitment period (IEA, 2004, p.&amp;nbsp;52).&lt;ref name=ieacan&gt;{{cite web

====Emissions====

In 2001, Canadian emissions had grown by more than 20% above their 1990 level (IEA, 2004, p.&amp;nbsp;49).&lt;ref name=ieacan/&gt; High population and economic growth, added to the expansion of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions-intensive sectors, such as [[oil sand]] production, were responsible for this growth in emissions. By 2004, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions had risen to 27% above the level in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In 2005, Canada's GHG emissions&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt; made up 2% of the global total (MNP, 2007).&lt;ref name=mnp/&gt; Per capita emissions in Canada were 23.2 tons per capita.

'''Projections'''

In 2004, Canada's emission projections under a business-as-usual scenario (i.e., predicted emissions should policy not be changed) indicated a rise of 33% on the 1990 level by 2010 (IEA, 2004, p.&amp;nbsp;52).&lt;ref name=ieacan/&gt; This is a gap of approximately 240&amp;nbsp;Mt between its target and projected emissions.

====Politics====

When the treaty was ratified in 2002, numerous polls showed support for the Kyoto protocol at around 70%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release

'''Environmental groups'''

Environmental groups in Canada are working together to demand that Canadian politicians take the threat of climate change seriously and make the necessary changes to ensure the safety and health of future generations. Participating groups have created a petition called [[KYOTOplus]], on which signatories commit to the following acts:
&lt;br /&gt;• set a national target to cut greenhouse gas emissions at least 25 per cent from 1990 levels by 2020;
&lt;br /&gt;• implement an effective national plan to reach this target and help developing countries adapt and build low-carbon economies; and
&lt;br /&gt;• adopt a strengthened second phase of the Kyoto Protocol at the United Nations climate change conference at Copenhagen, Denmark in December 2009.

[[KYOTOplus]] is a national, non-partisan, petition-centered campaign for urgent federal government action on climate change. There are over fifty partner organizations, including: [[Climate Action Network Canada]], [[Sierra Club Canada]], [[Sierra Youth Coalition]], [[Oxfam Canada]], the [[Canadian Youth Climate Coalition]], [[Greenpeace Canada]], KAIROS: Canadian Ecumenical Justice Initiatives and the David Suzuki Foundation.

[[Christiana Figueres]], Executive Secretary of the UNFCCC, said that she regretted Canada's decision to withdraw from the Kyoto treaty, and that "[whether] or not Canada is a Party to the Kyoto Protocol, it has a legal obligation under the [UNFCCC] to reduce its emissions, and a moral obligation to itself and future generations to lead in the global effort."&lt;ref&gt;

Canada's decision received a mostly negative response from representatives of other ratifying countries.&lt;ref name="bbc canada withdrawal"/&gt; A spokesman for France's foreign ministry called the move "bad news for the fight against climate change."&lt;ref name="bbc canada withdrawal"/&gt; Japan's own environment minister, Goshi Hosono, urged Canada to stay in the protocol.&lt;ref name="bbc canada withdrawal"/&gt; Some countries, including India, were worried that Canada's decision might jeopardise future conferences.&lt;ref name="bbc canada withdrawal"/&gt;

A spokesperson for the island nation of Tuvalu, significantly threatened by rising sea levels, accused Canada of an "act of sabotage" against his country.&lt;ref name="bbc canada withdrawal"/&gt; Australian government minister [[Greg Combet]], however, defended the decision, saying that it did not mean Canada would not continue to "play its part in global efforts to tackle climate change".&lt;ref name="bbc canada withdrawal"/&gt; China called Canada's decision to withdraw from the Kyoto Protocol "regrettable" and said that it went against the efforts of the international community.

On 31 May 2002, all fifteen then-members of the [[European Union]] deposited the relevant ratification paperwork at the UN. Under the Kyoto Protocol, the 15 member countries that were Member States of the EU when the Protocol was agreed (EU-15) are committed to reducing their collective GHG emissions in the period 2008–12 to 8% below levels in 1990 (EEA, 2009, p.&amp;nbsp;9).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=1 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; All but one EU Member State (Austria) anticipate that they will meet their commitments under the Kyoto Protocol (EEA, 2009, pp.&amp;nbsp;11–12).

Denmark has committed itself to reducing its emissions by 21%. On 10 January 2007, the [[European Commission]] announced plans for a [[Energy policy of the European Union|European Union energy policy]] that included a unilateral 20% reduction in GHG emissions by 2020.

The EU has consistently been one of the major nominal supporters of the Kyoto Protocol, negotiating hard to get wavering countries on board.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

In December 2002, the EU created an [[European Union Emission Trading Scheme|emissions trading system]] (EU ETS) in an effort to meet these tough targets. Quotas were introduced in six key industries: energy, steel, cement, glass, brick making, and paper/cardboard. There are also fines for member nations that fail to meet their obligations, starting at €40/ton of carbon dioxide in 2005, and rising to €100/ton in 2008.

The position of the EU is not without controversy in Protocol negotiations, however.{{According to whom|date=May 2010}} One criticism is that, rather than reducing 8%, all the EU member countries should cut 15% as the EU insisted a uniform target of 15% for other developed countries during the negotiation while allowing itself to share a big reduction in the former East Germany to meet the 15% goal for the entire EU.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} According to Aldy ''et al''. (2003, p.&amp;nbsp;7), the "hot air" in German and UK targets allows the EU to meet its Kyoto target at low cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Both the EU (as the [[European Community]]) and its member states are signatories to the Kyoto treaty. Greece, however was excluded from the Kyoto Protocol on Earth Day (22 April 2008) due to unfulfilled commitment of creating the adequate mechanisms of monitoring and reporting emissions, which is the minimum obligation, and delivering false reports by having no other data to report. A United Nations committee has decided to reinstate Greece in the emissions-trading system of the Kyoto Protocol after a seven-month suspension (on 15 November).

The two main approaches Germany has used to meet its Kyoto target are reductions from the EU ETS, and reductions from the transport, household, and [[small business]] sectors (p.&amp;nbsp;51).

|accessdate=7 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Estimates for 2005 showed that Japan's emissions were 7.8% higher than in the base year.

To meet its Kyoto target, the government aims for a 0.6% reduction in domestic GHG emissions compared with the base year. It also aims to meet part of its target through a forest sink of 13&amp;nbsp;million tonnes of carbon, which is equivalent to a 3.8% cut. Another reduction of 1.6% is aimed for using the Kyoto [[flexible mechanisms]].

According to IEA (2008, p.&amp;nbsp;45), Japan is a world leader in the field of [[sustainable energy]] policies. The legislation guiding Japan's efforts to reduce emissions is the Kyoto Protocol Target Achievement Plan, passed in 2005 and later amended (p.&amp;nbsp;47). This Plan includes about 60 policies and measures. Most of these policies and measures are related to improved energy efficiency.

When measured using market exchange rates, Japan's energy intensity in terms of total primary energy supply per unit of GDP is the lowest among IEA countries (p.&amp;nbsp;53). Measured in terms of [[purchasing power parity]], its energy intensity is one of the lowest.

In 2005, Japan's energy-related CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; per capita emissions were 9.5 metric tons per head of population (World Bank, 2010, p.&amp;nbsp;362).&lt;ref name=wdr/&gt; Japan's total energy-related CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions made up 4.57% of global emissions in this year. Over the period 1850–2005, Japan's cumulative energy-related CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions were 46.1&amp;nbsp;billion metric tons.

New Zealand signed the [[Kyoto Protocol]] to the UNFCCC on 22 May 1998 and ratified it on 19 December 2002. New Zealand's target is to limit '''net''' greenhouse gas emissions for the five-year 2008–2012 commitment period to five times the 1990 '''gross''' volume of GHG emissions. New Zealand may meet this target by '''either''' reducing emissions '''or''' by obtaining carbon credits from the international market or from domestic carbon sinks.&lt;ref name="mfatkp"&gt;{{cite web

{{See also|Energy policy of Russia}}

Under the Kyoto Protocol, the Russian Federation committed itself to keeping its GHG emissions at the base year level during the first Kyoto commitment period from 2008–2012 (UNFCCC, 2009, p.&amp;nbsp;3).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

|accessdate=3 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; UNFCCC (2009, p.&amp;nbsp;11) reported that Russian GHG emissions were projected to decline by 28% relative to base year level by 2010.

The process of economic transition in the Russian Federation was accompanied by a sharp decline in its GDP in the 1990s (p.&amp;nbsp;4). Since 1998, the Russian Federation has experienced strong economic growth. In the period 1990–2006, emissions decreased by 33%. The difference between GDP and emissions was mainly driven by:
*shifts in the structure of the economy;
*reduced share of oil and coal in the primary energy supply and an increase in the share of natural gas and [[nuclear power]];
*a decline in the transport and agriculture sectors;
*a decrease in population;
*an increase in [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]].

Russia accounts for about two-thirds of the expected emission savings from [[Joint Implementation]] (JI) projects by 2012 (Carbon Trust, 2009, p.&amp;nbsp;21).&lt;ref name=carbont/&gt; These savings are projected to amount to 190&amp;nbsp;megatonnes of [[carbon dioxide equivalent]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-eq) over the 2008–2012 period (p.&amp;nbsp;23).

'''Politics'''

[[Vladimir Putin]] approved the treaty on 4 November 2004, and Russia officially notified the United Nations of its ratification on 18 November 2004. The issue of Russian ratification was particularly closely watched in the international community, as the accord was brought into force 90 days after Russian ratification (16 February 2005).

President Putin had earlier decided in favor of the protocol in September 2004, along with the Russian cabinet,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

In 2002, the US government set a goal to reduce the GHG emissions of the US economy per unit of economic output (the emissions intensity of the economy) (IEA, 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;87).&lt;ref name=ieaus/&gt; The set goal is to reduce the GHG intensity of the US economy by 18% by 2012.

====Emissions====
Between 2001–2007, growth in US CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions was only 3%, comparable with to that of IEA Europe, and lower than that of a number of other countries, some of which are parties to the Kyoto Protocol (IEA, 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;90).&lt;ref name=ieaus/&gt; In 2005, the US made up 16% of global GHG emissions,&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt; and had per capita emissions of 24.1 tons of GHG per capita (MNP, 2007).&lt;ref name=mnp/&gt;

====Politics====
The United States (US), although a signatory to the Kyoto Protocol, has neither ratified nor withdrawn from the Protocol. The signature alone is merely symbolic, as the Kyoto Protocol is non-binding on the United States unless ratified.

=====Clinton administration=====
On 25 July 1997, before the Kyoto Protocol was finalized (although it had been fully negotiated, and a penultimate draft was finished), the US Senate unanimously passed by a 95–0 vote the [[Byrd–Hagel Resolution]] (S. Res. 98),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]] Administration released an economic analysis in July 1998, prepared by the [[Council of Economic Advisors]], which concluded that with emissions trading among the annex B/annex I countries, and participation of key developing countries in the "[[Clean Development Mechanism]]"—which grants the latter business-as-usual emissions rates through 2012—the costs of implementing the Kyoto Protocol could be reduced as much as 60% from many estimates. Estimates of the cost of achieving the Kyoto Protocol carbon reduction targets in the United States, as compared by the [[Energy Information Administration]] (EIA), predicted losses to GDP of between 1.0% and 4.2% by 2010, reducing to between 0.5% and 2.0% by 2020. Some of these estimates assumed that action had been taken by 1998, and would be increased by delays in starting action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

=====Bush administration=====
Under the [[Presidency of George W. Bush]], the US government recognized climate change as a serious environmental challenge (IEA, 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;87).&lt;ref name=ieaus/&gt; The policy of the Bush administration was to reduce the GHG emissions of the US economy per unit of economic output (the emissions intensity of the economy). This policy allowed for absolute increases in emissions. The Bush administration viewed a policy to reduce absolute emissions as incompatible with continued economic growth. A number of states set state-level GHG targets, despite the absence of a federal level target.

President [[George W. Bush]] did not submit the treaty for Senate ratification based on the exemption granted to China (now the world's largest gross emitter of carbon dioxide, although emission is low per capita&lt;ref&gt;Roger Harrabin, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7347638.stm China 'now top carbon polluter'] BBC News, 2008-04-14, retrieved 2009-10-01. Archived ar [https://www.webcitation.org/5kBaRDKRh?url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/7347638.stm WebCite]&lt;/ref&gt;). Bush opposed the treaty because of the strain he believed the treaty would put on the economy; he emphasized the [[Scientific opinion on climate change|uncertainties]] that he believed were present in the scientific evidence. Furthermore, the U.S. was concerned with broader exemptions of the treaty. For example, the U.S. did not support the split between annex I countries and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release

At the [[G8]] meeting in June 2005 administration officials expressed a desire for "practical commitments industrialized countries can meet without damaging their economies".

=====States and local governments=====
The Framework Convention on Climate Change is a treaty negotiated between countries at the UN; thus individual states are not free to participate independently within this Protocol to the treaty.
Nonetheless, several separate initiatives have started at the level of state or city.
Eight Northeastern US states created the [[Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative]] (RGGI),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.rggi.org/ |title=Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative| accessdate=7 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; a state level emissions capping and trading program, using their own independently-developed mechanisms. Their first allowances were auctioned in November 2008.
*'''Participating states''': [[Maine]], [[New Hampshire]], [[Vermont]], [[Connecticut]], New York, [[New Jersey]], [[Delaware]], [[Massachusetts]], and [[Maryland]] (these states represent over 46 million people, 20% of the US population).
*'''Observer states and regions''': [[Pennsylvania]], [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]], [[Rhode Island]].

On 27 September 2006, California Governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] signed into law the [[Bill (proposed law)|bill]] AB 32, also known as the [[Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006|Global Warming Solutions Act]], establishing a timetable to reduce the state's greenhouse-gas emissions, which rank at 12th-largest in the world, by 25% by the year 2020. This law effectively puts California in line with the Kyoto limitations, but at a date later than the 2008–2012 Kyoto commitment period. Many of the features of the Californian system are similar to the Kyoto mechanisms, although the scope and targets are different. The parties in the [[Western Climate Initiative]] expect to be compatible with some or all of the Californian model.

Sustainable development priorities mentioned by non-Annex I Parties included poverty alleviation and access to basic education and health care (p.&amp;nbsp;6). Many non-Annex I Parties are making efforts to amend and update their [[environmental legislation]] to include global concerns such as climate change (p.&amp;nbsp;7).

A few Parties, e.g., South Africa and Iran, stated their concern over how efforts to reduce emissions could affect their economies. The economies of these countries are highly dependent on income generated from the production, processing, and export of [[fossil fuel]]s.

'''Emissions'''

GHG emissions, excluding land use change and forestry (LUCF), reported by 122 non-Annex I Parties for the year 1994 or the closest year reported, totalled 11.7&amp;nbsp;billion tonnes (billion&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1,000,000,000) of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-eq. CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; was the largest proportion of emissions (63%), followed by [[methane]] (26%) and [[nitrous oxide]] (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) (11%).

The [[energy sector]] was the largest source of emissions for 70 Parties, whereas for 45 Parties the agriculture sector was the largest. Per capita emissions (in tonnes of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-eq, excluding LUCF) averaged 2.8&amp;nbsp;tonnes for the 122 non-Annex I Parties.
*The Africa region's [[aggregate data|aggregate]] emissions were 1.6&amp;nbsp;billion&amp;nbsp;tonnes, with per capita emissions of 2.4&amp;nbsp;tonnes.
*The Asia and Pacific region's aggregate emissions were 7.9&amp;nbsp;billion&amp;nbsp;tonnes, with per capita emissions of 2.6&amp;nbsp;tonnes.
*The Latin America and [[Caribbean]] region's aggregate emissions were 2&amp;nbsp;billion&amp;nbsp;tonnes, with per capita emissions of 4.6&amp;nbsp;tonnes.
*The "other" region includes Albania, Armenia, Azerbaijan, Georgia, Malta, [[Republic of Moldova|Moldova]], and Macedonia. Their aggregate emissions were 0.1&amp;nbsp;billion&amp;nbsp;tonnes, with per capita emissions of 5.1&amp;nbsp;tonnes.

Parties reported a high level of uncertainty in LUCF emissions, but in aggregate, there appeared to only be a small difference of 1.7% with and without LUCF. With LUCF, emissions were 11.9&amp;nbsp;billion&amp;nbsp;tonnes, without LUCF, total aggregate emissions were 11.7&amp;nbsp;billion&amp;nbsp;tonnes.

===Brazil===

Brazil has a national objective to increase the share of alternative renewable energy sources (biomass, wind and small hydropower) to 10% by 2030. It also has programmes to protect public forests from deforestation (Stern, 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;456).&lt;ref name=stern/&gt;

===People's Republic of China===

China has a number of domestic policy measures that affect its GHG emissions (Jones ''et al.'', 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;26).&lt;ref name=jones&gt;{{Cite web

China plans to expand renewable energy generation to 15% of total capacity by 2020 (Wang ''et al.'', p.&amp;nbsp;86).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

*support for research and development;
*reduced indirect taxation on renewable electricity generation;
*investment subsidies, energy efficiency standards, and the closure of the most energy-inefficient state-owned enterprises.

From 1995–2004, China energy efficiency efforts reduced its energy intensity by 30% (Wang ''et al.'', 2010, p.&amp;nbsp;87). From 2006–09, China achieved a 14.4% reduction in energy intensity. Renewables account for 8% of China's energy and 17% of its electricity. In response to the financial crisis, China implemented one of the world's largest stimulus's in efficient and clean energy (p.&amp;nbsp;85).

'''Emissions'''

In 2005, China made up 17% of global GHG emissions,&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt; with per capita emissions of 5.8&amp;nbsp;tons of GHG per head (MNP, 2007).&lt;ref name=mnp/&gt; Another way of measuring GHG emissions is to measure the cumulative emissions that a country has emitted over time (IEA, 2007b, p.&amp;nbsp;199).&lt;ref name=weo&gt;{{cite web
|year=2007b

|accessdate=4 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over a long time period, cumulative emissions provide an indication of a country's total contribution to GHG concentrations in the atmosphere. Measured over the time period 1900–2005, China's cumulative energy-related CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions made up 8% of the global total (IEA, 2007b, p.&amp;nbsp;201).

====Clean Development Mechanism (CDM)====

A report by the Carbon Trust (2009) assessed the use of [[Clean development mechanism|CDM]] in China.&lt;ref name=carbont&gt;{{cite web
|date=March 2009
|title=Global Carbon Mechanisms: Emerging lessons and implications (CTC748)
|url=http://www.carbontrust.com/resources/reports/advice/global-carbon-mechanisms
|publisher=Carbon Trust website
|accessdate=31 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CDM has been used to finance projects in China for renewable energy and HFC-23 reductions (HFC's are powerful greenhouse gases). For renewables, the CDM was judged to have helped to stimulate wind and small hydro power projects. Critics have argued that these policies would generally have taken place without the CDM (Carbon Trust, 2009, p.&amp;nbsp;56).

===India===

{{See also|Energy policy of India}}

India signed and ratified the Protocol in August 2002. Since India is exempted from the framework of the treaty, it is expected to gain from the protocol in terms of transfer of technology and related foreign investments. At the [[G8]] meeting in June 2005, Indian Prime Minister [[Manmohan Singh]] pointed out that the per-capita emission rates of the developing countries are a tiny fraction of those in the developed world. Following the principle of ''common but differentiated responsibility'', India maintains that the major responsibility of curbing emission rests with the developed countries, which have accumulated emissions over a long period of time. However, the U.S. and other Western nations assert that India, along with China, will account for most of the emissions in the coming decades, owing to their rapid industrialization and economic growth.

Policies in India related to greenhouse gas emissions have included (Stern, 2007, p.&amp;nbsp;456;&lt;ref name=stern/&gt; Jones ''et al.'', 2008, p.&amp;nbsp;26):&lt;ref name=jones/&gt;
*the 11th Five Year Plan, which contains mandatory and voluntary measures to increase efficiency in power generation and distribution
*increased use of nuclear power and renewable energy
*a target to increase energy efficiency by 20% by 2016–17
*expanded electricity supply to villages
*policies designed to increase tree and forest cover
*building codes designed to reduce energy consumption

'''Emissions'''

In 2005, India accounted for 5% of global GHG emissions,&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt; with per capita emissions of 2.1 tons of GHG per head of population (MNP, 2007).&lt;ref name=mnp/&gt; Over the time period 1900–2005, India's contribution to the global total of cumulative energy-related CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions was 2% (IEA, 2007b, p.&amp;nbsp;201).&lt;ref name=weo/&gt;

===Pakistan===

Although the Minister of State for environment Malik Min Aslam was at first not very receptive, he subsequently convinced the Shoukat Aziz cabinet to ratify the Protocol.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} The decision was taken in 2001 but due to international circumstances, it was announced in Argentina in 2004 and accepted in 2005, opening the way for the creation of a policy framework. On 11 January 2005, Pakistan submitted its instruments of accession to the Kyoto Protocol. The Ministry of Environment assigned the task to work as designated national authority (DNA). According to a news story by Khan (2009), it was expected that the Protocol would help Pakistan lower dependence on fossil fuels through renewable energy projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

'''CDM'''

In February 2006, the national CDM operational strategy was approved, and on 27 April 2006, the first CDM project was approved by DNA.{{citation needed|date=May 2010}} It was reduction of large N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O from nitric acid production (investor: Mitsubishi, Japan), with an estimated annual production of 1 million CERs. Finally, in November 2006, the first CDM project was registered with the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC).

'''Emissions'''

Over the period from July 1993 to June 1994, Pakistan's energy sector was by far the highest contributor to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions, with a share of 81% of total CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions (Pakistan government, 2003, pp.&amp;nbsp;16).&lt;ref name=pakistan/&gt; Pakistan's energy-related CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions rose by 94.1% between 1990 and 2005 (World Bank, 2010, p.&amp;nbsp;362).&lt;ref name=wdr&gt;{{cite book

Pakistan's per capita emissions in 2005 were 0.8&amp;nbsp;tCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; per head (p.&amp;nbsp;362). In 2005, Pakistan contributed 0.45% of the global total in energy-related CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions. Pakistan's cumulative emissions over the period 1850–2005 was 2.4&amp;nbsp;billion metric tons. Cumulative emissions before 1971 are based on data for East and West Pakistan.

==Asia Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate==

==Footnotes==

&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt; Estimates by MNP (2007) are for the GHG emissions from [[fossil fuel]] use and cement production.&lt;ref name=mnp/&gt; Calculations are for [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), [[methane]] (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), [[nitrous oxide]] (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) and fluor containing gases (the F-gases HFCs, PFCs and SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;). These estimates are subject to large uncertainties regarding CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions from [[deforestation]]; and the per country emissions of other GHGs (e.g., methane). There are also other large uncertainties that mean that small differences between countries are not significant. CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions from the decay of remaining [[biomass]] after biomass burning/deforestation are not included.

The '''liquidus temperature''', T&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; or T&lt;sub&gt;liq&lt;/sub&gt; specifies the temperature above which a material is completely liquid,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Askeland |first1=Donald R. |last2=Wright |first2=Wendelin J. |title=Essentials of Materials Science and Engineering |publisher=Cengage Learning |date=January 14, 2014 |origyear=1st.

It is mostly used for impure substances (mixtures) such as  [[glass]]es, [[alloy]]s and [[rock (geology)|rock]]s.

Above the liquidus temperature the material is [[Homogeneous (chemistry)|homogeneous]] and liquid at equilibrium. Below the liquidus temperature, more and more [[crystal]]s will form in the melt if one waits a sufficiently long time, depending on the material. Alternately, [[Homogeneous (chemistry)|homogeneous]] glasses can be obtained through sufficiently fast cooling, i.e., through kinetic inhibition of the [[crystallization]] process.

The crystal phase that crystallizes first on cooling a substance to its liquidus temperature is termed '''primary crystalline phase''' or '''primary phase'''. The composition range within which the primary phase remains constant is known as '''primary crystalline phase field'''.

The liquidus temperature is important in the glass industry because crystallization can cause severe problems during the glass melting and forming processes, and it also may lead to product failure.

The liquidus temperature can be contrasted to the [[solidus (chemistry)|solidus temperature]]. The solidus temperature quantifies the point at which a material completely solidifies (crystallizes). The liquidus and solidus temperatures do not necessarily coincide; if a gap exists between the liquidus and solidus temperatures, then within that gap, the material consists of solid and liquid phases simultaneously (like a [[slurry]]).

For pure substances, e.g. pure metal, pure water, etc. the liquidus and solidus are at the same temperature, and the term "melting point" may be used. For impure substances, e.g. alloys, tap water, Coca-Cola, ice cream, etc. the melting point broadens into a melting interval instead. If the temperature is within the melting interval, one may see "slurries" at equilibrium, i.e. the slurry will neither fully solidify nor melt. This is why new snow of high purity either melts or stays solid, while dirty snow on the ground tends to become slushy at certain temperatures. Weld melt pools containing high levels of sulfur, either from melted impurities of the base metal or from the welding electrode, typically have very broad melting intervals, which leads to increased risk of hot cracking.

This field of endeavor is not limited to some traditional understandings of the relationship between materials and information. Some more narrow interpretations include [[combinatorial chemistry]], [[Process Modeling]], materials property databases, [[materials data management]] and [[product life cycle management]]. Materials informatics is at the convergence of these concepts, but also transcends them and has the potential to achieve greater insights and deeper understanding by applying lessons learned from data gathered on one type of material to others. By gathering appropriate [[meta]] data, the value of each individual data point can be greatly expanded.

==Beyond computational methods?==
The concept of materials informatics is addressed by the ''Materials Research Society''. For example, materials informatics is the theme of the December 2006 issue of the ''MRS Bulletin''. The issue was guest-edited by John Rodgers of Innovative Materials, Inc., and David Cebon of [[Cambridge University]], who describe the "high payoff for developing methodologies that will accelerate the insertion of materials, thereby saving millions of investment dollars."

The editors focus on a limited definition of materials informatics, "the application of computational methodologies to processing and interpreting scientific and engineering data concerning materials."  They state that "specialized informatics tools for data capture, management, analysis, and dissemination" and "advances in computing power, coupled with computational modeling and simulation and materials properties databases" will enable such accelerated insertion of materials.

This view is not universally held. A broader definition goes beyond the use of computational methods to carry out the same experimentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.informaticsresearch.net/17.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-03-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070429194941/http://www.informaticsresearch.net/17.html |archivedate=2007-04-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; An evolved view of informatics creates a framework in which a measurement or computation is not simply a data point but a step in an information-based learning process that uses the power of a collective to achieve greater efficiency in exploration. When properly organized, this framework crosses materials boundaries to uncover fundamental knowledge of the basis of physical, mechanical, and engineering properties.

==Challenges==
While there are many that believe in the future of informatics in the materials development and scaling process, many challenges remain. Hill, et. al., write that  "Today, the materials community faces serious challenges to bringing about this data-accelerated research paradigm, including diversity of research areas within materials, lack of data standards, and missing incentives for sharing, among others. Nonetheless, the landscape is rapidly changing in ways that should benefit the entire materials research enterprise."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

This remaining tension between traditional materials development methodologies and the use of more computationally, machine learning, and analytics approaches will likely exist for some time as the materials industry overcomes some of the cultural barriers necessary to fully embrace such new ways of thinking.

==Analogy from Biology==
The overarching goals of bioinformatics and systems biology may provide a useful analogy. Andrew Murray of [[Harvard University]] expresses the hope that such an approach "will save us from the era of "one graduate student, one gene, one PhD".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.100md.com/html/DirDu/2007/02/17/37/06/78.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the goal of materials informatics is to save us from one graduate student, one alloy, one PhD. Such goals will require more sophisticated strategies and research paradigms than applying computational methods to the same tasks set currently undertaken by students.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9511">'''Metals in medicine''' are used in organic systems for diagnostic and treatment purposes. Inorganic elements are also essential for organic life as cofactors in enzymes called [[metalloprotein]]s. When metals are scarce or high quantities, equilibrium is set out of balance and must be returned to its natural state via interventional and natural methods.

== Toxic metals ==

Metals can be toxic in high quantities. Either ingestion or faulty metabolic pathways can lead to metal poisoning. Sources of toxic metals include [[cadmium]] from tobacco, [[arsenic]] from agriculture and [[mercury (element)|mercury]] from volcanoes and forest fires. Nature, in the form of trees and plants, is able to trap many toxins and can bring abnormally high levels back into equilibrium. Toxic metal poisoning is usually treated with some type of [[chelating agent]].&lt;ref&gt;Nash, Robert A. “Metals in Medicine.” Alternative Therapies II.4 (2005):18-25.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="L"&gt;Lippard, Stephen J. “Metals in Medicine.” Bioinorganic Chemistry. Mill City: University Science Books, 1994. 505-583.&lt;/ref&gt; Heavy metal poisoning, e.g., Hg, Cd, Pb, are particularly pernicious.

Examples of specific types of toxic metals include:
* [[Copper]]: copper toxicity usually presents itself as a side effect of low levels of the protein [[ceruloplasmin]], which normally is involved in copper storage. This is referred to as [[Wilson’s disease]]. Wilson's disease is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder whose mutation causes the [[ATPase]] that transports copper into bile and ultimately incorporates it into ceruloplasmin to malfunction.   
* [[Plutonium]]: ever since the nuclear age, plutonium poisoning is a potential danger, especially among nuclear reactor employees; inhalation of Pu dust is particularly dangerous due to its intense alpha particle emission. There have been very few cases of plutonium poisoning. 
* [[Mercury (element)|Mercury]]: mercury is usually ingested from agricultural sources or other environmental sources. Mercury poisoning can lead to neurological disease and kidney failure if left untreated.
* [[Iron]]: iron toxicity, [[iron poisoning]], or [[iron overload]] is well known. Iron does test only very weakly positive for the [[Ames test]] for cancer, however, since it is such a strong catalyst and essential for the production of [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] and consequently DNA production, any excess soluble iron is toxic especially over time. Too much  iron deposited in tissues or high levels in the blood stream has been successfully linked to a vast majority of  human diseases from Alzheimer's to Malaria. In Botany, iron is a severe problem for the irrigation of plants like rice, maize, or wheat in Sub-Saharan Africa whose subterranean water contains excessive amounts of iron which then poisons these crops.
* [[Lead]] and [[cadmium]]: lead and cadmium poisoning can lead to gastrointestinal, kidney, and neurological dysfunction. The use of unleaded paints and gas has successfully decreased the number of cases of lead heavy metal poisoning.
* [[Nickel]], [[chromium]], and [[cadmium]]: via metal-DNA interactions, these metals can be carcinogenic.&lt;ref name="L"/&gt;
* [[Nickel]]: allergies to nickel, particularly from skin to metal contact via jewelry, are common. 
* [[Zinc]], [[cadmium]], [[magnesium]], [[chromium]]: [[metal fume fever]] can be caused by ingestion of the fumes of these metals and leads to fume like symptoms.

== Metal anemia ==

Humans need a certain amount of certain metals to function normally. Most metals are used as cofactors or prosthetics in enzymes, catalyzing specific reactions and serving essential roles. The essential metals for humans are: [[Sodium]], [[Potassium]], [[Magnesium]], [[Copper]], [[Vanadium]], [[Chromium]], [[Manganese]], [[Iron]], [[Cobalt]], [[Nickel]], [[Zinc]], [[Molybdenum]], and [[Cadmium]]. Anemia symptoms are caused by lack of a certain essential metal. Anemia can be associated with malnourishment or faulty metabolic processes, usually caused by a genetic defect.&lt;ref name="L"/&gt;

Examples of specific types of metal anemia include:
* [[Iron]]: common simple anemia (iron deficiency), results in the loss of functional heme proteins ([[hemoglobin]], [[myoglobin]], etc.), which are responsible for oxygen transport or utilization of oxygen. [[Pernicious anemia]] comes from a lack of vitamin B-12 (which contains a cobalt complex called cobalamin), which then in turn interferes with the function of red blood cells.  
* [[Zinc]]: Zinc anemia is mostly due to diet can result in growth retardation. 
* [[Copper]]: Copper anemia in infants results from infants with a poor diet and can cause heart disease.&lt;ref name="L"/&gt;

== Metals in diagnosis ==

Metal ions are often used for diagnostic medical imaging. Metal complexes can be used either for radioisotope imaging (from their emitted radiation) or as contrast agents, for example, in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Such imaging can be enhanced by manipulation of the ligands in a complex to create specificity so that the complex will be taken up by a certain cell or organ type.&lt;ref name="L"/&gt;&lt;ref name="D"&gt;Dabrowiak, James C. “Metals in Medicine.” Inorganic Chemica Acta. (2012). Preface.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Bleomycin A2.svg|thumb|Bleomycin|Figure 1. Structure of [[Bleomycin]] A2]]

Examples of metals used for diagnosis include:
* [[Technetium]].  &lt;sup&gt;99m&lt;/sup&gt;Tc is the most commonly used radioisotope agent for imaging purposes. It has a short half-life, emits only gamma ray photons, and does not emit beta or alpha particles (which are more damaging to surrounding cells), and thus is particularly suitable as an imaging radioisotope.   
* [[Gadolinium]](III), [[Iron]](III), [[Manganese]](II):  For MRI imaging paramagnetic metals are needed for contrast imaging. Gadolinium(III), Iron(III), and Manganese(II) are all paramagnetic metals that are able to alter the tissue relaxation times and produce a contrast image. 
* [[Cobalt]](III): &lt;sup&gt;57&lt;/sup&gt;Cobalt(III) is used with the compound [[bleomycin]] (BLM) (Figure 1), which is an antibiotic, to selectively be taken up by tumor cells. The use of cobalt results in the best blood-to-tumor distribution ratio, but its half-life is too long to be conducive for imaging purposes. A solution has been proposed to attach an [[Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid|EDTA]] moiety to the terminal [[thiazole]] ring of bleomycin, radiolabeled so that the entire complex can then be traceable. This system could provide tumor locations accurately, leading to earlier detection and more non-invasive procedures in the future.&lt;ref name="L"/&gt;

== Metals in treatment ==

Metals have been used in treatments since ancient times. The Ebers Papyrus from 1500BC is the first written account of the use of metals for treatment and describes the use of Copper to reduce inflammation and the use of iron to treat anemia. Sodium vanadate has been used since the early 20th century to treat rheumatoid arthritis. Recently metals have been used to treat cancer, by specifically attacking cancer cells and interacting directly with DNA. The positive charge on most metals can interact with the negative charge of the phosphate backbone of DNA. Some drugs developed that include metals interact directly with other metals already present in protein active sites, while other drugs can use metals to interact with amino acids with the highest reduction potential.&lt;ref name="D"/&gt;
[[File:Cisplatin-stereo.svg|thumb|Cisplatin-stereo|Figure 2. Structure of [[Cisplatin]], a platinum coordination complex.]]

Examples of Metals used in treatment include:
* [[Platinum]]: Platinum based compounds have been shown to specifically effect head and neck tumors. These coordination complexes are thought to act to cross-link DNA in tumor cells (Figure 2).
* [[Gold]]: Gold salt complexes have been used to treat [[rheumatoid arthritis]] (Figure 3). The gold salts are believed to interact with albumin and eventually be taken up by immune cells, triggering anti-mitochondrial effects and eventually cell apoptosis. This is an indirect treatment of arthritis, mitigating the immune response. 
* [[Lithium]]: Li&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; can be used to treat prophylaxis of manic-depression behavior. 
* [[Zinc]]: Zinc can be used topically to heal wounds. Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; can be used to treat the herpes virus.
* Silver: Silver has been used to prevent infection at the burn site for burn wound patients.
* Platinum, Titanium, Vanadium, Iron: cis DDP (cis-diaminedichoroplatinum), titanium, vanadium, and iron have been shown to react with DNA specifically in tumor cells to treat patients with cancer. 
* [[Gold]], [[Silver]], [[Copper]]: Phosphine ligand compounds containing gold, silver, and copper have anti-cancer properties.&lt;ref name="L"/&gt;
* [[Lanthanum]]: [[Lanthanum carbonate|Lanthanum Carbonate]] often used under the trade-name Fosrenol is used as a phosphate binder in patients suffering from Chronic Kidney disease.
* [[Bismuth]]: [[Bismuth subsalicylate]] is used as an [[antacid]].

The '''Musatepe Dam''' is a [[gravity dam]] under construction on the [[Ortasu River]] (a tributary of the [[Hezil River]]) in [[Uludere]] district of [[Şırnak Province]], southeast [[Turkey]]. Under contract from Turkey's [[State Hydraulic Works]], Ozerka Insaat began construction on the dam in 2008 and a completion date has not been announced.&lt;ref name=DSIII/&gt;

The reported purpose of the dam is water storage and it can also support a 9 MW [[hydroelectric]] power station in the future.&lt;ref name=DSIII&gt;{{cite web|title=DSI 10 REGIONAL OFFICE - Diyarbakir|url=http://www2.dsi.gov.tr/bolge/dsi10/sirnak.htm|publisher=State Hydraulic Works|accessdate=1 August 2013|language=Turkish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another purpose of the dam which has been widely reported in the Turkish press is to reduce the freedom of movement of [[Kurdistan Workers' Party]] (PKK) militants. Blocking and flooding valleys in close proximity to the Iraq–Turkey border is expected to help curb cross-border PKK smuggling and deny caves in which ammunition can be stored. A total of 11 dams along the border; seven in Şırnak Province and four in [[Hakkâri Province]] were implemented for this purpose. In Şırnak they are the [[Silopi Dam|Silopi]], [[Şırnak Dam|Şırnak]], [[Uludere Dam|Uludere]], [[Balli Dam|Balli]] and [[Kavşaktepe Dam]]s downstream of the Musatepe Dam and the [[Çetintepe Dam]] upstream on the Ortasu River. In Hakkari are the Gölgeliyamaç (since cancelled) and [[Çocuktepe Dam]]s on the Güzeldere River and the [[Aslandağ Dam|Aslandağ]] and [[Beyyurdu Dam]]s on the Bembo River.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Terror Down|url=http://www.posta.com.tr/turkiye/HaberDetay/Teror-bogulacak.htm?ArticleID=136637|publisher=Posta|accessdate=1 August 2013|language=Turkish|date=24 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Planned to be completed in the second dam on the border against the PKK|url=http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/gundem/19088520.asp|publisher=Hurriyet|accessdate=1 August 2013|language=Turkish|date=26 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dams Prevent Smuggling at the Border|url=http://www.aktifhaber.com/sinirdaki-barajlar-kacakciligi-onleyecek-780919h.htm|publisher=Aktif Haber|accessdate=1 August 2013|language=Turkish|date=5 May 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510001959/http://www.aktifhaber.com/sinirdaki-barajlar-kacakciligi-onleyecek-780919h.htm|archivedate=10 May 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Water retention dams began operation against PKK|url=http://www.cnnturk.com/2012/turkiye/08/23/pkkya.karsi.yapilan.barajlarda.su.tutma.islemi.basladi/674002.0/index.html|publisher=CNNTurk|accessdate=2 August 2013|language=Turkish|date=23 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The Nereid Monument. From Xanthos (Lycia), modern-day Antalya Province, Turkey. 390-380 BCE. Room 17, the British Museum, London.jpg|thumb|The [[Nereid Monument]]. From [[Xanthos]] (Lycia), modern-day [[Antalya Province]], Turkey. 390–380 BCE. Room 17, the [[British Museum]], London]]
In [[Greek mythology]], the '''Nereids''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|n|ɪər|i|ɪ|d|z}} {{respell|NEER|ee-idz}}; {{lang-grc-gre|Νηρηΐδες}} ''Nereides'', sg. {{lang|grc|Νηρηΐς}} ''Nereis'') are sea [[nymph]]s (female spirits of sea waters), the 50 daughters of [[Nereus]] and [[Doris (mythology)|Doris]], sisters to [[Nerites (mythology)|Nerites]].&lt;ref name="Theoi Project" /&gt; They often accompany [[Poseidon]], the god of the sea, and can be friendly and helpful to sailors, like the [[Argonauts]] in their search for the [[Golden Fleece]].

==Mythology==

[[File:Sea thiasos Nereis Glyptothek Munich 239 front n1.jpg|thumb|300px|Nereid riding a sea-bull (latter 2nd century BC)|left]]
Nereids are particularly associated with the [[Aegean Sea]], where they dwelt with their father Nereus in the depths within a golden palace.&lt;ref name="Theoi Project"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Atsma|first1=Aaron J.|title=Nereides|url=http://www.theoi.com/Pontios/Nereides.html|website=Theoi Project Greek Mythology|accessdate=7 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most notable of them are [[Thetis]], wife of [[Peleus]] and mother of [[Achilles]]; [[Amphitrite]], wife of [[Poseidon]]; and [[Acis and Galatea (mythology)|Galatea]], the vain love interest of the [[Cyclops]] [[Polyphemus]].{{Greek myth (aquatic nymphs)}}They symbolized everything that is beautiful and kind about the sea. Their melodious voices sang as they danced around their father. They are represented as very beautiful girls, crowned with branches of red coral and dressed in white silk robes trimmed with gold, but who went barefoot. They were part of Poseidon's entourage and carried his trident.

In Homer's ''[[Iliad]]'' XVIII, when Thetis cries out in sympathy for the grief of [[Achilles]] for the slain [[Patroclus]], her sisters appear. The Nereid Opis is mentioned in [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]''. She is called by the goddess [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]] to avenge the death of the [[Amazons|Amazon]]-like female warrior [[Camilla (mythology)|Camilla]]. Diana gives Opis magical weapons for revenge on Camilla's killer, the Etruscan [[Arruns (Etruscan)|Arruns]]. Opis sees and laments Camilla's death and shoots Arruns in revenge as directed by Diana.&lt;ref&gt;''Virgil: His life and times'' by Peter Levi, Duckworth, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern use==
In modern Greek [[folklore]], the term "nereid" ({{lang|el|νεράιδα}}, ''neráida'') has come to be used for all [[nymph]]s, [[fairy|fairies]], or mermaids, not merely nymphs of the sea.

[[Nereid (moon)|Nereid]], a moon of the planet [[Neptune]], is named after the Nereids.

After the war, a heavy reconstruction and expansion was done under the communist regime. Since then, most of the industry has been privatized.

Possessing substantial oil refining capacities, Romania is particularly interested in the Central Asia-Europe pipelines and seeks to strengthen its relations with some [[Arab States of the Persian Gulf]]. With 10 refineries and an overall refining capacity of approximately {{convert|504000|oilbbl/d|m3/d|abbr=on}}, Romania has the largest refining industry in the region. Romania's refining capacity far exceeds domestic demand for refined petroleum products, allowing the country to export a wide range of oil products and petrochemicals — such as lubricants, bitumen, and fertilizers — throughout the region.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gasandoil.com/goc/news/nte30277.htm Romania has the largest power sector in south-eastern Europe&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Porta-Color.png|thumb|A Porta-Color [[Television set|television receiver]] in use]]
[[General Electric]]'s '''Porta-Color''' was the first "portable" [[color television]] introduced in the [[United States]] in 1966.

The Porta-Color set introduced a new variation of the [[shadow mask]] display tube. It had the [[electron gun]]s arranged in an in-line configuration, rather than [[RCA]]'s delta arrangement. The main benefit of the in-line gun arrangement is that it simplified the convergence process, and did not become easily misaligned when moved, thus making true portability possible.  There were many variations of this set produced from its introduction in 1966 until 1978, all using GE's Compactron vacuum tubes (valves).

The name has been variously written, even in GE's literature, as "Porta Color", "Porta-Color" and "Porta-color". The name may also refer to the specific television model, or less commonly, the style of television tube it used.

==History==

===Basic television===

A conventional black and white television (B&amp;W) uses a tube that is uniformly coated with a [[phosphor]] on the inside face. When excited by high-speed [[electron]]s, the phosphor gives off light, typically white but other colors are also used in certain circumstances. An [[electron gun]] at the back of the tube provides a beam of high-speed electrons, and a set of [[electromagnets]] arranged near the gun allow the beam to be moved around the display. [[Time base generator]]s are used to produce a scanning motion. The television signal is sent as a series of stripes, each one of which is displayed as a separate line on the display. The strength of the signal increases or decreases the current in the beam, producing bright or dark points on the display as the beam sweeps across the tube.

In a color display the uniform coating of white phosphor is replaced by dots or lines of three colored phosphors, producing red, green or blue light ([[RGB color model]]) when excited. When excited in the same fashion as a B&amp;W tube, the three phosphors produce different amount of these [[primary color]]s, which mix in the human eye to produce an apparent color. To produce the same resolution as the B&amp;W display, a color screen must have three times the resolution. This presents a problem for conventional electron guns, which cannot be focused or positioned accurately enough to hit these much smaller individual patterns.

===Shadow mask===

The conventional solution to this problem was introduced by [[RCA]] in 1950, with their [[shadow mask]] system. The shadow mask is a thin steel sheet with small round holes cut into it, positioned so the holes lie directly above one triplet of colored phosphor dots. Three separate electron guns are individually focussed on the mask, sweeping the screen as normal. When the beams pass over one of the holes, they travel through it, and since the guns are separated by a small distance from each other at the back of the tube, each beam has a slight angle as it travels through the hole. The phosphor dots are arranged on the screen such that the beams hit only their correct phosphor.

The primary problem with the shadow mask system is that the vast majority of the beam energy, typically 85%, is lost 'lighting up' the mask as the beam passes over the opaque sections between the holes. This means that the beams must be greatly increased in power to produce acceptable brightness when they do pass through the holes.

=== The General Electric Porta-Color===
Paul Pelczynski was the project leader in the conception and production of the General Electric Porta Color in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Television|first1=Early Electronic|title=General Electric Porta Color|url=http://www.earlytelevision.org/ge_portacolor.html|website=Early Television Museum|publisher=Early Television Museum|accessdate=2015-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[File:Schlitzmaske.jpg|thumb|Close-up of a slot mask]]
General Electric (GE) had been working on a variety of systems that would allow them to introduce color sets that did not rely on the shadow mask patents. Through the 1950s they had put considerable effort into the [[Penetron]] concept, but were never able to make it work as a basic color television, and started looking for alternate arrangements. GE eventually improved on the basic shadow mask system with a simple change to layout.

Instead of arranging the guns, and phosphors, in a triangle, their system arranged them side-by-side. This meant that the phosphors did not have to be displaced from each other in two directions, only one, which allowed much-simplified convergence adjustments of the three beams, compared to the conventional delta shadow mask tube.  This differed sufficiently from RCA's design to allow GE to circumvent the patents.  It is important to realize that the GE 11" tube still had round mask holes and phosphor dots, not rectangular ones as in the later slot-mask tubes.  The innovation here was with the in-line guns as opposed to the triad arrangement.

This change, which allowed vastly simpler convergence measures, together with the use of GE's own Compactron multi-function vacuum tubes led to reductions in size of the entire chassis. GE used the small size of their system as the primary selling feature. The original 28 pound set used a 11" tube and sold for $249, which was very inexpensive for a color set at that time. Introduced in 1966, the Porta-Color was extremely successful and led to a rush by other companies to introduce similar systems. GE continued refining this system, up until 1978, which marked the end of production of vacuum tube type television receivers.

GE produced the basic Porta-Color design well into the 1970s, even after most companies had moved to [[solid state (electronics)|solid state]] designs when [[transistor]]s with the required power capabilities were introduced. The Porta Color II was their attempt at a solid state version, but did not see widespread sales. The basic technology, however, was copied into GE's entire lineup as product refresh cycles allowed. By the early 1970s most companies had introduced the "slot-mask" designs, including RCA.&lt;ref&gt;''New TV''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:GEpicturetube.png|thumb|Labelled sketch of in-line gun and slot mask in a color picture tube.]]
[[File:DeltaGun.png|thumb|Labelled sketch of delta gun and shadow mask in a color picture tube.]]
In a conventional [[shadow mask]] television design the [[electron gun]]s at the back of the tube are arranged in a triangle. They are individually focused, with some difficulty, so that the three beams meet at a spot when they reach the shadow mask. The mask cuts off any unfocussed portions of the beams, which then continue through the holes towards the screen. Since the beams approach the mask at an angle, they separate again on the far side of the mask. This allows the beams to address the individual phosphor spots on the back of the screen.

GE's design modified this layout by arranging the electron guns in a side-by-side line (the "in-line gun") instead of a triangle (the "delta gun"). This meant that after they passed through the mask they separated horizontally only, hitting phosphors that were also arranged side-by-side. Otherwise, the GE design retained the round dot structure.  

Later, Sony changed the whole game, replacing the shadow mask with an aperture grille and the phosphor dots with vertical phosphor stripes.  They cleverly implemented a single electron gun with three independent cathodes, later branded [[Trinitron]], all of which greatly simplified convergence.

Toshiba then countered this with their slot-mask system, which was somewhat in-between the Trinitron and the original delta-mask systems.
Sony attempted to stop Toshiba from producing their in-line gun system, citing patent violations, but Toshiba won this battle, and the Toshiba tube eventually became the standard in most domestic television receivers.{{cn|date=December 2017}}

== Collecting General Electric Porta Color Televisions ==

Over the years, the Porta Color has attracted interest as an old (dead) technology to be rescued. Once considered throw-away items, the Porta Color has become a collectible item, being the last all-vacuum tube color television made in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kuhn|first1=Martin|title=In Living Porta Color|url=http://www.rwhirled.com/portacolor/|website=In Living Porta Color|publisher=Martin Kuhn|accessdate=2015-10-17|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150913100926/http://www.rwhirled.com/portacolor/|archivedate=2015-09-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Puntukas''' is the second-largest [[boulder]] in [[Lithuania]]. It is situated some {{convert|5|km}} south of [[Anykščiai]] on the left bank of the [[Šventoji River]]. It was believed to be the largest stone in Lithuania until the discovery of Barstyčiai stone in the [[Skuodas district]] in 1957.

Puntukas is a [[glacial erratic]]—it was brought by glaciers during the [[last glacial period]] (18th–12th millennium BC) probably from [[Finland]].&lt;ref name=gaiga/&gt; It measures {{convert|6.9|m}} in length, {{convert|6.7|m|abbr=on}} in width, and {{convert|5.7|m|abbr=on}} in depth (including {{convert|1.5|m|abbr=on}} underground). It weighs about 265 tons. It is made of [[Rapakivi granite]]. Its reddish mass includes large crystals of [[potassium]] [[feldspar]] surrounded by green rings of [[oligoclase]].&lt;ref name=gaiga/&gt;

In 1943, sculptor Bronius Pundzius engraved portraits and quotes from last wills of Lithuanian pilots [[Steponas Darius]] and [[Stasys Girėnas]] for the 10th anniversary of their deaths during the transatlantic flight with ''[[Lituanica]]''. A local legend has it that [[velnias]] (a devil in the [[Lithuanian mythology]]) carried the stone to destroy the [[Anykščiai Church]], however a [[rooster]] crowed. The devil disappeared back into the underworld, leaving only Puntukas behind.&lt;ref name=laur/&gt; The legend was featured in the famous poem ''[[Anykščių šilelis]]'' by [[Antanas Baranauskas]].&lt;ref name=bara/&gt; According to another story, a brave Lithuanian warrior Puntukas was killed and was burned (a usual pagan custom) on the stone; since then it is known as Puntukas stone. Other legends claim that the stone was a pagan shrine and that oaks growing around are relics of the sacred groves.&lt;ref name=sema/&gt;

'''Radioactive contamination''', also called '''radiological contamination''', is the deposition of, or presence of [[Radioactive decay|radioactive]] substances on surfaces or within solids, liquids or gases (including the human body), where their presence is unintended or undesirable (from the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] - IAEA - definition).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=IAEA Safety Glossary: Terminology Used in Nuclear Safety and Radiation Protection |last1=International Atomic Energy Agency |authorlink= |year=2007 |publisher=IAEA |location=Vienna |isbn=92-0-100707-8 |pages= |url=http://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/publications/PDF/Pub1290_web.pdf |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such contamination presents a hazard because of the [[radioactive decay]] of the contaminants, which emit harmful [[ionising radiation]] such as [[alpha particle]]s or [[beta particle]]s, [[gamma ray]]s or [[neutron]]s. The degree of hazard is determined by the concentration of the contaminants, the energy of the radiation being emitted, the type of radiation, and the proximity of the contamination to organs of the body. It is important to be clear that the contamination gives rise to the radiation hazard, and the terms "radiation" and "contamination" are not interchangeable.

Contamination may affect a person, a place, an animal, or an object such as clothing. Following an atmospheric nuclear weapon discharge or a nuclear reactor [[Containment building|containment]] breach, the air, soil, people, plants, and animals in the vicinity will become contaminated by [[nuclear fuel]] and [[fission product]]s. A spilled vial of [[radioactive material]] like [[uranyl nitrate]] may contaminate the floor and any rags used to wipe up the spill. Cases of widespread radioactive contamination include the [[Bikini Atoll]], the [[Radioactive contamination from the Rocky Flats Plant|Rocky Flats Plant]] in Colorado, the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster]], the [[Chernobyl disaster]], and the area around the [[Mayak]] facility in Russia.

Radioactive contamination can be due to a variety of causes. It may occur due to release of radioactive gases, liquids or particles. For example, if a radionuclide used in [[nuclear medicine]] is spilled (accidentally or, as in the case of the [[Goiânia accident]], through ignorance), the material could be spread by people as they walk around. 

Radioactive contamination may also be an inevitable result of certain processes, such as the release of radioactive [[xenon]] in [[nuclear reprocessing|nuclear fuel reprocessing]]. In cases that radioactive material cannot be contained, it may be diluted to safe concentrations. For a discussion of environmental contamination by [[alpha particle|alpha]] emitters please see [[actinides in the environment]].

[[Nuclear fallout]] is the distribution of radioactive contamination by the 520 atmospheric [[nuclear explosion]]s that took place from the 1950s to the 1980s. 

In nuclear accidents, a measure of the type and amount of radioactivity released,such as from a reactor containment failure, is known as the source term. The [[United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission]] defines this as "Types and amounts of radioactive or hazardous material released to the environment following an accident."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=USNRC|first1=United States Regulatory Commission|title=Glossary|URL=https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/basic-ref/glossary.html|accessdate=14 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contamination does not include residual [[radioactive material]] remaining at a site after the completion of [[Nuclear decommissioning|decommissioning]]. Therefore, radioactive material in sealed and designated containers is not properly referred to as contamination, although the units of measurement might be the same.

===Containment===
[[File:NNSA-NSO-58.jpg|thumb|Large industrial glovebox in the nuclear industry]]
Containment is the primary way of preventing contamination being released into the environment or coming into contact or being ingested by humans.

Being within the intended Containment differentiates radioactive ''material'' from radioactive ''contamination''. When radioactive materials are concentrated to a detectable level outside a containment, the area affected is generally referred to as "contaminated".

There are a large number of techniques for containing radioactive materials so that it does not spread beyond the containment and become contamination. In the case of liquids this is by the use of high integrity tanks or containers, usually with a sump system so that leakage can be detected by radiometric or conventional instrumentation.

Where material is likely to become airborne, then extensive use is made of the [[glovebox]], which is a common technique in hazardous laboratory and process operations in many industries. The gloveboxes are kept under a slight negative pressure and the vent gas is filtered in high efficiency filters, which are monitored by radiological instrumentation to ensure they are functioning correctly.

===Naturally occurring radioactivity===
{{main|Environmental radioactivity}}
A variety of [[radionuclide]]s occur naturally in the environment. Elements like [[uranium]] and [[thorium]], and their [[decay product]]s, are present in rock and soil. [[Potassium-40]], a [[primordial nuclide]], makes up a small percentage of all potassium and is present in the human body. Other nuclides, like [[carbon-14]], which is present in all living organisms, are [[cosmogenic nuclide|continuously created]] by [[cosmic ray]]s.

These levels of radioactivity pose little danger but can confuse measurement. A particular problem is encountered with naturally generated [[radon]] gas which can affect instruments which are set to detect contamination close to normal background levels and can cause false alarms. Because of this skill is required by the operator of radiological survey equipment to differentiate between [[background radiation]] and the radiation which emanates from contamination.

[[Naturally occurring radioactive material]]s (NORM) can be brought to the surface or concentrated by human activities like mining, oil and gas extraction and coal consumption.

==Control and monitoring of contamination==
[[File:Cosmos 954 - Recovery 001.jpg|thumb|G-M counters being used as gamma survey monitors, seeking radioactive satellite debris]]
Radioactive contamination may exist on surfaces or in volumes of material or air, and specialist techniques are used to measure the levels of contamination by detection of the emitted radiation.

===Contamination monitoring===
Contamination monitoring depends entirely upon the correct and appropriate deployment and utilisation of radiation monitoring instruments.

====Surface contamination====
Surface contamination may either be fixed or "free". In the case of fixed contamination, the radioactive material cannot by definition be spread, but its radiation is still measurable. In the case of free contamination there is the hazard of contamination spread to other surfaces such as skin or clothing, or entrainment in the air.  A concrete surface contaminated by radioactivity can be [[Bluegrass companies#Diamond Shaving of Contaminated Concrete Surfaces|shaved to a specific depth]], removing the contaminated material for disposal.

For occupational workers controlled areas are established where there may be a contamination hazard. Access to such areas is controlled by a variety of barrier techniques, sometimes involving changes of clothing and foot wear as required. The contamination within a controlled area is normally regularly monitored. Radiological protection instrumentation (RPI) plays a key role in monitoring and detecting any potential contamination spread, and combinations of [[Survey meter|hand held survey instruments]] and permanently installed area monitors such as [[Airborne particulate radioactivity monitoring|Airborne particulate monitors]] and area gamma monitors are often installed.
Detection and measurement of surface contamination of personnel and plant is normally by [[Geiger counter]], [[scintillation counter]] or [[proportional counter]]. Proportional counters and dual phosphor scintillation counters can discriminate between alpha and beta contamination, but the Geiger counter cannot. Scintillation detectors are generally preferred for hand held monitoring instruments, and are designed with a large detection window to make monitoring of large areas faster. Geiger detectors tend to have small windows, which are more suited to small areas of contamination.

====Exit monitoring====
The spread of contamination by personnel exiting controlled areas in which nuclear material is used or processed is monitored by specialised installed exit control instruments such as frisk probes, hand contamination monitors and whole body exit monitors. These are used to check that persons exiting controlled areas do not carry contamination on their body or clothes.

In the [[United Kingdom]] the [[Health and Safety Executive|HSE]] has issued a user guidance note on selecting the correct portable radiation measurement instrument for the application concerned.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hse.gov.uk/pubns/irp7.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This covers all radiation instrument technologies, and is a useful comparative guide for selecting the correct technology for the contamination type.

The UK [[National Physical Laboratory (United Kingdom)|NPL]] publishes a guide on the alarm levels to be used with instruments for checking personnel exiting controlled areas in which contamination may be encountered.&lt;ref&gt;Operational Monitoring Good Practice Guide "The Selection of Alarm Levels for Personnel Exit Monitors" Dec 2009 - National Physical Laboratory, Teddington UK [http://www.npl.co.uk/upload/pdf/alarm_levels_personnel_exit_monitors.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;
Surface contamination is usually expressed in units of radioactivity per unit of area for alpha or beta emitters. For [[SI]], this is [[becquerel]]s per [[square meter]] (or Bq/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). Other units such as [[picoCurie]]s per 100&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; or [[counts per minute|disintegrations per minute]] per square [[centimeter]] (1&amp;nbsp;dpm/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 167&amp;nbsp;Bq/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) may be used.

===Airborne contamination===
{{main|Airborne particulate radioactivity monitoring}}
The air can be contaminated with radioactive isotopes in particulate form, which poses a particular inhalation hazard. Respirators with suitable air filters, or completely self-contained suits with their own air supply can mitigate these dangers.

Airborne contamination is measured by specialist radiological instruments that continuously pump the sampled air through a filter. Airborne particles accumulate on the filter and can be measured in a number of ways:

# The filter paper is periodically manually removed to an instrument such as a "scaler" which measures any accumulated radioactivity.
# The filter paper is static and is measured in situ by a radiation detector.
# The filter is a slowly moving strip and is measured by a radiation detector. These are commonly called "moving filter" devices and automatically advance the filter to present a clean area for accumulation, and thereby allow a plot of airborne concentration over time.

Commonly a semiconductor radiation detection sensor is used that can also provide spectrographic information on the contamination being collected.

A particular problem with airborne contamination monitors designed to detect alpha particles is that naturally occurring [[radon]] can be quite prevalent and may appear as contamination when low contamination levels are being sought. Modern instruments consequently have "radon compensation" to overcome this effect.

See the article on [[Airborne particulate radioactivity monitoring]] for more information.

===Internal human contamination===
{{main|Committed dose}}
Radioactive contamination can enter the body through [[ingestion]], [[inhalation]], [[absorption (skin)|absorption]], or [[injection (medicine)|injection]]. This will result in a [[committed dose]] of radiation.

For this reason, it is important to use [[personal protective equipment]] when working with radioactive materials. Radioactive contamination may also be ingested as the result of eating contaminated plants and animals or drinking contaminated water or milk from exposed animals. Following a major contamination incident, all potential pathways of internal exposure should be considered.

Successfully used on [[Harold McCluskey]], chelation therapy and other treatments exist for internal radionuclide contamination.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20170125171315/https://ke.army.mil/bordeninstitute/published_volumes/nuclearwarfare/chapter4/chapter4.pdf TREATMENT OF INTERNAL RADIONUCLIDE CONTAMINATION. Borden Institute]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Decontamination==
Cleaning up contamination results in [[radioactive waste]] unless the radioactive material can be returned to commercial use by [[Nuclear reprocessing|reprocessing]]. In some cases of large areas of contamination, the contamination may be mitigated by burying and covering the contaminated substances with concrete, soil, or rock to prevent further spread of the contamination to the environment. If a person's body is contaminated by ingestion or by injury and standard cleaning cannot reduce the contamination further, then the person may be permanently contaminated.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Contamination control products have been used by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and the commercial nuclear industry for decades to minimize contamination on radioactive equipment and surfaces and fix contamination in place.  “Contamination control products” is a broad term that includes fixatives, strippable coatings, and [[DeconGel|decontamination gels]].  A ''fixative'' product functions as a permanent coating to stabilize residual loose/transferable radioactive contamination by fixing it in place; this aids in preventing the spread of contamination and reduces the possibility of the contamination becoming airborne, reducing workforce exposure and facilitating future deactivation and decommissioning (D&amp;D) activities. ''Strippable coating'' products are loosely adhered paint-like films and are used for their decontamination abilities.  They are applied to surfaces with loose/transferable radioactive contamination and then, once dried, are peeled off, which removes the loose/transferable contamination along with the product.  The residual radioactive contamination on the surface is significantly reduced once the strippable coating is removed.  Modern strippable coatings show high decontamination efficiency and can rival traditional mechanical and chemical decontamination methods. ''Decontamination gels'' work in much the same way as other strippable coatings. The results obtained through the use of contamination control products is variable and depends on the type of substrate, the selected contamination control product, the contaminants, and the environmental conditions (e.g., temperature, humidity, etc.).[https://www.dndkm.org/DOEKMDocuments/library/Contamination%20Control%20Fixatives%20List.pdf]

Some of the largest areas committed to be decontaminated are in the [[Fukushima Prefecture|Fukushima]] Prefecture, Japan. The national government is under pressure to [[Fukushima disaster cleanup|clean up radioactivity]] due to the [[Fukushima nuclear accident|Fukushima nuclear]] accident of March 2011 from as much land as possible so that some of the 110,000 displaced people can return.  Stripping out the key radioisotope threatening health ([[caesium-137]]) from low level waste could also dramatically decrease the volume of waste requiring special disposal.  A goal is to find techniques  that might be able to strip out 80 to 95% of the caesium from contaminated soil and other materials, efficiently and without destroying the organic content in the soil. One being investigated is termed hydrothermal blasting.  The caesium is broken away from soil particles and then precipitated with ferric [[ferricyanide]] ([[Prussian blue]]). It would be the only component of the waste requiring special burial sites.&lt;ref&gt;Dennis Normile, "Cooling a Hot Zone," Science, 339 (1 March 2013) pp. 1028-1029.&lt;/ref&gt; The aim is to get annual exposure from the contaminated environment down to one [[millisievert]] (mSv) above background. The most contaminated area where radiation doses are greater than 50&amp;nbsp;mSv/year must remain off limits, but some areas that are currently less than 5&amp;nbsp;mSv/year may be decontaminated allowing 22,000 residents to return.

To help with protection of people living in geographical areas which have been radioactively contaminated the [[International Commission on Radiological Protection]] has published a guide: "Publication 111 - Application of the Commission’s Recommendations to the Protection of People Living in Long-term Contaminated Areas after a Nuclear Accident or a Radiation Emergency".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icrp.org/docs/p111%28special%20free%20release%29.pdf|title=ICRP Protection of people living in long term contaminated areas|author=|date=|website=icrp.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{legend|purple|Extremely radioactive elements: the most stable isotope has half-life less than several minutes.}}]]

===Low-level contamination===
The hazards to people and the environment from radioactive contamination depend on the nature of the radioactive contaminant, the level of contamination, and the extent of the spread of contamination. Low levels of radioactive contamination pose little risk, but can still be detected by radiation instrumentation.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} If a survey or map is made of a contaminated area, random sampling locations may be labeled with their activity in [[becquerels]] or [[curies]] on contact. Low levels may be reported in [[counts per minute]]  using a [[scintillation counter]].

In the case of low-level contamination by isotopes with a short half-life, the best course of action may be to simply allow the material to naturally [[radioactive decay|decay]]. Longer-lived isotopes should be cleaned up and properly disposed of, because even a very low level of radiation can be life-threatening when in long exposure to it.

Facilities and physical locations that are deemed to be contaminated may be cordoned off by a [[health physicist]] and labeled "Contaminated area." Persons coming near such an area would typically require [[anti-contamination clothing]] ("anti-Cs").

===High-level contamination===
High levels of contamination may pose major risks to people and the environment. People can be exposed to potentially lethal radiation levels, both externally and internally, from the spread of contamination following an [[Nuclear accident|accident]] (or a [[Nuclear weapon|deliberate initiation]]) involving large quantities of radioactive material. The [[Radiation poisoning|biological effects of external exposure]] to radioactive contamination are generally the same as those from an external radiation source not involving radioactive materials, such as [[x-ray]] machines, and are dependent on the [[absorbed dose]].

When radioactive contamination is being measured or mapped ''[[in situ]]'', any location that appears to be a [[point source]] of radiation is likely to be heavily contaminated. A highly contaminated location is colloquially referred to as a "hot spot." On a map of a contaminated place, hot spots may be labeled with their "on contact" dose rate in mSv/h. In a contaminated facility, hot spots may be marked with a sign, shielded with bags of [[lead shot]], or cordoned off with warning tape containing the [[radioactive trefoil symbol]].

[[Image:Radiation warning symbol.svg|thumb|upright|The radiation warning symbol (''trefoil'')]]
[[Image:Alfa beta gamma radiation.svg|thumb|right|Alpha radiation consists of [[helium-4]] nucleus and is readily stopped by a sheet of paper. Beta radiation, consisting of [[electron]]s, is halted by an aluminium plate. Gamma radiation is eventually absorbed as it penetrates a dense material. [[Lead]] is good at absorbing gamma radiation, due to its density.]]

The hazard from contamination is the emission of ionising radiation. The principal radiations which will be encountered are alpha, beta and gamma, but these have quite different characteristics. They have widely differing penetrating powers and radiation effect, and the accompanying diagram shows the penetration of these radiations in simple terms. For an understanding of the different ionising effects of these radiations and the weighting factors applied, see the article on [[absorbed dose]].

[[Radiation monitoring]] involves the measurement of radiation dose or radionuclide contamination for reasons related to the assessment or control of exposure to radiation or radioactive substances, and the interpretation of the results. The methodological and technical details of the design and operation of environmental radiation monitoring programmes and systems for different radionuclides, environmental media and types of facility are given in IAEA Safety Standards Series No. RS–G-1.8&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Environmental and Source Monitoring for Purposes of Radiation Protection, IAEA Safety Standards Series No. RS–G-1.8 |last1=International Atomic Energy Agency |authorlink= |year=2005 |publisher=IAEA |location=Vienna |isbn= |pages= |url=http://www-pub.iaea.org/MTCD/publications/PDF/Pub1216_web.pdf |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in IAEA Safety Reports Series No. 64.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Programmes and Systems for Source and Environmental Radiation Monitoring.

==Health effects of contamination==

===Biological effects===
{{see also|Sievert|Radiation poisoning|committed dose}}
Radioactive contamination by definition emits ionizing radiation, which can irradiate the human body from an external or internal origin.

====External irradiation====
This is due to radiation from contamination located outside the human body. The source can be in the vicinity of the body or can be on the skin surface. The level of health risk is dependent on duration and the type and strength of irradiation. Penetrating radiation such as gamma rays, X-rays, neutrons or beta particles pose the greatest risk from an external source. Low penetrating radiation such as alpha particles have a low external risk due to the shielding effect of the top layers of skin. See the article on [[sievert]] for more information on how this is calculated.

====Internal irradiation====
Radioactive contamination can be ingested into the human body if it is airborne or is taken in as contamination of food or drink, and will irradiate the body internally. The art and science of assessing internally generated radiation dose is [[Internal dosimetry]].

The biological effects of ingested [[radionuclide]]s depend greatly on the activity, the biodistribution, and the removal rates of the radionuclide, which in turn depends on its chemical form, the particle size, and route of entry. Effects may also depend on the chemical [[toxicity]] of the deposited material, independent of its radioactivity. Some radionuclides may be generally distributed throughout the body and rapidly removed, as is the case with [[tritiated water]].

Some organs concentrate certain elements and hence radionuclide variants of those elements. This action may lead to much lower removal rates. For instance, the [[thyroid]] gland takes up a large percentage of any [[iodine]] that enters the body. Large quantities of inhaled or ingested [[radioactive iodine]] may impair or destroy the thyroid, while other tissues are affected to a lesser extent. Radioactive iodine-131 is a common [[nuclear fission|fission product]]; it was a major component of the radioactivity released from the [[Chernobyl disaster]], leading to nine fatal cases of pediatric [[thyroid cancer]] and [[hypothyroidism]]. On the other hand, radioactive iodine is used in the diagnosis and treatment of many diseases of the thyroid precisely because of the thyroid's selective uptake of iodine.

The radiation risk proposed by the [[International Commission on Radiological Protection]] (ICRP) predicts that an effective dose of one [[sievert]] (100 rem) carries a 5.5% chance of developing cancer. Such a risk is the sum of both internal and external radiation dose.&lt;ref&gt;ICRP publication 103 - Paragraph 83.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ICRP states "Radionuclides incorporated in the human body irradiate the tissues over time periods determined by their physical half-life and their biological retention within the body. Thus they may give rise to doses to body tissues for many months or years after the intake. The need to regulate exposures to radionuclides and the accumulation of radiation dose over extended periods of time has led to the definition of committed dose quantities".&lt;ref&gt;ICRP Publication 103 paragraph 140&lt;/ref&gt;
The ICRP further states "For internal exposure, committed effective doses are generally determined from an assessment of the intakes of radionuclides from bioassay measurements or other quantities (e.g., activity retained in the body or in daily excreta). The radiation dose is determined from the intake using recommended dose coefficients".&lt;ref&gt;ICRP publication 103 - Paragraph 144.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ICRP defines two dose quantities for individual committed dose:

'''Committed equivalent dose''', H &lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;(''t'') is the time integral of the equivalent dose rate in a particular tissue or organ that will be received by an individual following intake of radioactive material into the body by a Reference Person, where ''t'' is the integration time in years.&lt;ref name="ICRP publication 103 - Glossary"&gt;ICRP publication 103 - Glossary.&lt;/ref&gt;
This refers specifically to the dose in a specific tissue or organ, in a similar way to external equivalent dose.

'''Committed effective dose,''' E(''t'') is the sum of the products of the committed organ or tissue equivalent doses and the appropriate tissue weighting factors ''W''&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;, where ''t'' is the integration time in years following the intake. The commitment period is taken to be 50 years for adults, and to age 70 years for children.&lt;ref name="ICRP publication 103 - Glossary"/&gt; This refers specifically to the dose to the whole body, in a similar way to external effective dose.

===Social and psychological effects===
A 2015 report in ''[[The Lancet|Lancet]]'' explained that serious impacts of nuclear accidents were often not directly attributable to radiation exposure, but rather social and psychological effects.&lt;ref name = ari2015/&gt; The consequences of low-level radiation are often more [[psychological]] than radiological. Because damage from very-low-level radiation cannot be detected, people exposed to it are left in anguished uncertainty about what will happen to them. Many believe they have been fundamentally contaminated for life and may refuse to have children for fear of [[birth defect]]s. They may be shunned by others in their community who fear a sort of mysterious contagion.&lt;ref name=riv12&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/03/10/nuclear-risk-and-fear-from-hiroshima-to-fukushima/ |title=Nuclear Risk and Fear, from Hiroshima to Fukushima |author=[[Andrew C. Revkin]] |date=March 10, 2012 |work=New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forced evacuation from a radiological or nuclear accident may lead to social isolation, anxiety, depression, psychosomatic medical problems, reckless behavior, even suicide. Such was the outcome of the 1986 [[Chernobyl nuclear disaster]] in Ukraine. A comprehensive 2005 study concluded that "the mental health impact of Chernobyl is the largest public health problem unleashed by the accident to date".&lt;ref name=riv12/&gt; [[Frank N. von Hippel]], a U.S. scientist, commented on 2011 [[Fukushima nuclear disaster]], saying that "fear of ionizing radiation could have long-term psychological effects on a large portion of the population in the contaminated areas".&lt;ref name="Frank N. von Hippel 27–36"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://bos.sagepub.com/content/67/5/27.full |title=The radiological and psychological consequences of the Fukushima Daiichi accident |author= Frank N. von Hippel |date= September–October 2011 |volume=vol. 67 no. 5 |work= Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists |pages= 27–36 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Evacuation and long-term displacement of affected populations create problems for many people, especially the elderly and hospital patients.&lt;ref name = ari2015&gt;Arifumi Hasegawa, Koichi Tanigawa, Akira Ohtsuru, Hirooki Yabe, Masaharu Maeda, Jun Shigemura, et al. [http://www.thelancet.com/pdfs/journals/lancet/PIIS0140-6736(15)61106-0.pdf Health effects of radiation and other health problems in the aftermath of nuclear accidents, with an emphasis on Fukushima], ''[[The Lancet]]'', 1 August 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Such great psychological danger does not accompany other materials that put people at risk of cancer and other deadly illness. Visceral fear is not widely aroused by, for example, the daily emissions from coal burning, although, as a National Academy of Sciences study found, this causes 10,000 premature deaths a year in the [[Demographics of the United States|US population of  317,413,000]]. [[Medical error#Impact|Medical errors]] leading to death in U.S. hospitals are estimated to be between 44,000 and 98,000. It is "only nuclear radiation that bears a huge psychological burden — for it carries a unique historical legacy".&lt;ref name=riv12/&gt;

In the [[United States]], '''salvage sales''' are [[timber]] sales from [[United States National Forest|national forest]]s primarily to remove dead, infested, damaged, or down trees and associated trees for stand improvement. They are controversial partly because there are no standards for the number or proportion of trees that must be dead, infested, damaged, or down and partly because the [[United States Forest Service|U.S. Forest Service]] may retain the revenues to prepare and administer future salvage sales.

'''Slug Catcher''' is the name of a unit in the gas [[Oil refinery|refinery]] or [[petroleum industry]] in which slugs at the outlet of pipelines are collected or caught.  A slug is a large quantity of gas or liquid that exits in the pipeline.

== Slugs ==

Pipelines that transport both gas and liquids together, known as [[two-phase flow]], can operate in a flow regime known as slugging flow or [[slug flow]].  Under the influence of [[gravity]], liquids will tend to settle on the bottom of the pipeline, while the gases occupy the top section of the pipeline.  Under certain operating conditions gas and liquid are not evenly distributed throughout the pipeline, but travel as large plugs with mostly liquids or mostly gases through the pipeline. These large plugs are called slugs.

Slugs exiting the pipeline can overload the gas/liquid handling capacity of the plant at the pipeline outlet, as they are often produced at a much larger rate than the equipment is designed for.

Slugs can be generated by different mechanisms in a pipeline:

* '''Terrain slugging''' is caused by the elevations in the pipeline, which follows the ground elevation or the sea bed. Liquid can accumulate at a low point of the pipeline until sufficient pressure builds up behind it. Once the liquid is pushed out of the low point, it can form a slug.
* '''Hydrodynamic slugging''' is caused by gas flowing at a fast rate over a slower flowing liquid phase. The gas will form waves on the liquid surface, which may grow to bridge the whole cross-section of the line. This creates a blockage on the gas flow, which travels as a slug through the line.
* '''Riser-based slugging''', also known as '''severe slugging''', is associated with the [[Marine Riser Tensioner|pipeline risers]] often found in offshore oil production facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Eaton | first=A. | title=Post-installed fiber optic pressure sensors on subsea production risers for severe slugging control | journal=OMAE 2015 Proceedings, St. John's, Canada | year=2015 | url=http://apm.byu.edu/prism/uploads/Projects/Eaton_OMAE15.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Liquids accumulate at the bottom of the riser until sufficient pressure is generated behind it to push the liquids over the top of the riser, overcoming the [[static head]]. Behind this slug of liquid follows a slug of gas, until sufficient liquids have accumulated at the bottom to form a new liquid slug.
* '''Pigging slugs''' are caused by [[pigging]] operations in the pipeline. The pig is designed to push all or most of the liquids contents of the pipeline to the outlet. This intentionally creates a liquid slug.

Slugs formed by terrain slugging, hydrodynamic slugging or riser-based slugging are periodical in nature. Whether a slug is able to reach the outlet of the pipeline depends on the rate at which liquids are added to the slug at the front (i.e. in the direction of flow) and the rate at which liquids leave the slug at the back. Some slugs will grow as they travel the pipeline, while others are damped and disappear before reaching the outlet of the pipeline.

== Purpose of the slug catcher ==
A slug catcher is a vessel with sufficient buffer volume to store the largest slugs expected from the upstream system. The slug catcher is located between the outlet of the pipeline and the processing equipment. The buffered liquids can be drained to the processing equipment at a much slower rate to prevent overloading the system. As slugs are a periodical phenomenon, the slug catcher should be emptied before the next slug arrives

Slug catchers can be used continuously or on-demand. A slug catcher permanently connected to the pipeline will buffer all production, including the slugs, before it is sent to the gas and liquid handling facilities. This is used for difficult to predict slugging behaviour found in terrain slugging, hydrodynamic slugging or riser-based slugging. Alternatively, the slug catcher can be bypassed in normal operation and be brought online when a slug is expected, usually during pigging operations. An advantage of this set-up is that inspection and maintenance on the slug catcher can be done without interrupting the normal operation.

== Slug catcher design ==
[[File:Qadirpur Gas Field.jpg|thumb|right|Finger type slug catcher at theQadirpur Gas Field]]
Slug catchers are designed in different forms,
* A '''vessel type''' slug catcher is essentially a conventional vessel. This type is simple in design and maintenance.
* A '''finger type''' slug catcher consists of several long pieces of pipe ('fingers'), which together form the buffer volume. The advantage of this type of slug catcher is that pipe segments are simpler to design for high pressures, which are often encountered in pipeline systems, than a large vessel.  A disadvantage is that its footprint can become excessively large. An example of a large finger-type slugcatcher can be seen in Den Helder, The Netherlands, using [http://maps.google.fr/maps?tab=wl&amp;t=k&amp;om=1&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;ll=52.921789,4.794095&amp;spn=0.003273,0.009613&amp;z=17 Google Maps].
* A '''Parking Loop''' slug catcher combines features of the vessel and finger types. The Gas/Liquid Separation occurs in the Vessel, while the Liquid is stored in the parking loop shaped fingers.

A basic slug catcher design contains the buffer volume for gas and liquid.  A control system is used for controlled outflow of gas and liquid to the downstream processing facilities.  The inlet section is designed to promote the separation of gas and liquids.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="29142">'''Solar car racing''' refers to competitive races of [[electric vehicle]]s which are powered by [[solar power|solar energy]] obtained from solar panels on the surface of the car ([[solar car]]s). The first solar car race was the [[Tour de Sol]] in 1985 which led to several similar races in Europe, US and Australia. Such challenges are often entered by universities to develop their students' engineering and technological skills, but many [[corporation|business corporations]] have entered competitions in the past. A small number of high school teams participate in solar car races designed exclusively for high school students.

==Distance races==
The two most notable solar car distance (overland) races are the [[World Solar Challenge]] and the [[American Solar Challenge]]. They are contested by a variety of university and corporate teams. Corporate teams participate in the races to give their design teams experience of working with both alternative energy sources and advanced materials. University teams participate in order to give their students experience in designing high technology cars and working with environmental and advanced materials technology. These races are often sponsored by government or educational agencies,{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}} and businesses such as Toyota&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.toyota.com/about/news/community/2008/07/30-2-solarchallenge.html |title=Toyota Sponsors World's Longest Solar Car Race |publisher=Toyota.com |date=2008-07-30 |accessdate=2011-08-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927150915/http://www.toyota.com/about/news/community/2008/07/30-2-solarchallenge.html |archivedate=2011-09-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; keen to promote renewable energy sources.

===Support===
The cars require intensive support teams similar in size to professional motor racing teams. This is especially the case with the World Solar Challenge where sections of the race run through very remote country. The solar car will travel escorted by a small caravan of support cars. In a long distance race each solar car will be preceded by a lead car that can identify problems or obstacles ahead of the race car. Behind the solar car there will be a mission control vehicle from which the race pace is controlled. Here tactical decisions are made based on information from the solar car and environmental information about the weather and terrain. Behind the mission control there might be one or more other vehicles carrying replacement drivers and maintenance support as well as supplies and camping equipment for the entire team.

===World Solar Challenge===
{{main|World Solar Challenge}}
This race features a field of competitors from around the world who race to cross the [[Australian continent]]. The 30th Anniversary race of the World Solar Challenge will be held in October 2017. Major regulation changes were released in June 2006 for this race to increase safety, to build a new generation of solar car, which with little modification could be the basis for a practical proposition for sustainable transport and intended to slow down cars in the main event, which could easily exceed the speed limit (110&amp;nbsp;km/h) in previous years.

In 2013 the organisers of the event introduced the Cruiser Class to the World Solar Challenge, designed to encourage contestants to design a "practical" solar powered vehicle. This race requires that vehicles have four wheels and upright seating for passengers, and is judged on a number of factors including time, payload, passenger miles, and external energy use.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldsolarchallenge.org/team_info/2015_regulations{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dutch [[TU Eindhoven]] solar racing team were the inaugural Cruiser Class winner with their vehicle [[Stella (solar vehicles)|''Stella'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tue.nl/en/university/news-and-press/news/06-02-2015-solar-team-eindhoven-wins-crunchie-in-san-francisco/|title=Solar Team Eindhoven wins Crunchie in San Francisco|author=|date=|website=www.tue.nl|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===American Solar Challenge===
{{main|American Solar Challenge}}
The American Solar Challenge, previously known as the 'North American Solar Challenge' and 'Sunrayce', features mostly collegiate teams racing in timed intervals in the United States and Canada. The annual [[Formula Sun Grand Prix]] track race is used as a qualifier for ASC.

The American Solar Challenge was sponsored in part by several small sponsors. However, funding was cut near the end of 2005, and the NASC 2007 was cancelled. The North American solar racing community worked to find a solution, bringing in Toyota as a primary sponsor for a 2008 race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/Solar-Vehicle-Challenge/message/4824 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120714130838/http://tech.groups.yahoo.com/group/Solar-Vehicle-Challenge/message/4824 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-07-14 |title=Official NASC2008 Announcement |publisher=Tech.groups.yahoo.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://americansolarchallenge.org/ |title=Official NASC Website |publisher=Americansolarchallenge.org |date=2010-06-15 |accessdate=2011-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Toyota has since dropped the sponsorship. The last North American Solar Challenge was run 2016, from Brecksville, OH to Hot Springs, SD. The race was won by the [[University of Michigan]]. Michigan has won the race the last 6 times it has been held.

===The Dell-Winston School Solar Car Challenge===
{{main|Dell-Winston School Solar Car Challenge}}
The Dell-Winston School Solar Car Challenge is an annual solar-powered car race for high school students. The event attracts teams from around the world, but mostly from American high schools. The race was first held in 1995. Each event is the end product of a two-year education cycle launched by the Winston Solar Car Team. On odd-numbered years, the race is a road course that starts at the Dell Diamond in Round Rock, Texas; the end of the course varies from year to year. On even-numbered years, the race is a track race around the Texas Motor Speedway. Dell has sponsored the event since 2002.[1]

===South African Solar Challenge===
{{main|South African Solar Challenge}}
The [[South African Solar Challenge]] is a biennial, two-week solar-powered car race through the length and breadth of South Africa. The first challenge in 2008 proved that this event can attract the interest of the public, and that it has the necessary international backing from the FIA. Late in September, all entrants will take off from Pretoria and make their way to Cape Town, then drive along the coast to Durban, before climbing the escarpment on their way back to the finish line in Pretoria 11 days later. The event has (in both 2008 and 2010) been endorsed by International Solarcar Federation (ISF), [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile]] (FIA), [[World Wildlife Fund]] (WWF) making it the first Solar Race to receive endorsement from these 3 organizations. The last race took place in 2016. [[Sasol]] confirmed their support of the South Africa Solar Challenge, by taking naming rights to the event, so that for the duration of their sponsorship, the event was known as the Sasol Solar Challenge, South Africa.

===Carrera Solar Atacama===

The Carrera Solar Atacama is the first solar-powered car race of its kind in Latin America; the race covers {{convert|2600|km|mi|abbr=on}} from Santiago to Arica in the north of Chile. The race's founder, La Ruta Solar, claims it is the most extreme of the vehicular races due to the high levels of solar radiation, up to 8.5 kWh/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/day, encountered while traversing the Atacama Desert, as well as challenging participating teams to climb {{convert|3500|m|ft|abbr=on}} above sea level. The race, which made its debut in 2009 with just a handful of local teams, is set for its fifth version in late October 2018, welcoming international teams in all categories and is for the first time in both English and Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carrerasolar.com/|title=Carrera Solar Atacama - Latin America´s first solar car race|author=|date=|website=www.carrerasolar.com|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Solar drag races==
Solar drag races are another form of solar racing. Unlike long distance solar races, solar dragsters do not use any batteries or pre-charged [[Electric double-layer capacitor|energy storage devices]]. Racers go head-to-head over a straight quarter kilometer distance. Currently, a solar drag race is held each year on the Saturday closest to the summer solstice in Wenatchee, Washington, USA. The world record for this event is 29.5 seconds set by the South Whidbey High School team on June 23, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://users.applecapital.net/~jim/solardragrace.htm |title=Official Solar Drag Race Website |publisher=Users.applecapital.net |date= |accessdate=2011-08-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723015112/http://users.applecapital.net/~jim/solardragrace.htm |archivedate=2011-07-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Speed records==
===Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA)===
The [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile|FIA]] recognise a land speed record for vehicles powered only by solar panels.  The current record was set by the Raedthuys Solar Team, of the University of Twente with their car SolUTra.  The record of 37.757&amp;nbsp;km/h was set in 2005. The record takes place over a flying 1000m run, and is the average speed of 2 runs in opposite directions.

In July, 2014, a group of Australian students from the [[UNSW Sunswift]] solar racing team at the [[University of New South Wales]] broke a world record in their solar car, for the fastest electric car weighing less than {{convert|500|kg}} and capable of travelling {{convert|500|km}} on a single battery charge. This particular record was overseen by the [[Confederation of Australian Motorsport]] on behalf of the [[FIA]] and is not exclusive to solar powered cars but to any electric car, and so during the attempt the solar panels were disconnected from the electrical systems. The previous record of {{convert|73|km/h}} - which had been set in 1988 - was broken by the team with an average speed of {{convert|107|km/h}} over the {{convert|500|km}} distance.

===Guinness world record===
[[File:solar car LSR.jpg|thumb|right|Sunswift IV and control vehicle during speed record attempts at HMAS ''Albatross''.]]
[[Guinness World Records]] recognize a land speed record for vehicles powered only by solar panels. This record is currently held by the [[University of New South Wales]] with the car [[Sunswift|Sunswift IV]]. Its {{convert|25|kg|adj=on}} battery was removed so the vehicle was powered only by its solar panels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.physorg.com/news/2011-01-world-fastest-solar-car-guinness.html |title=World's fastest solar car smashed Guinness World Record (w/ Video) |date=January 7, 2011 |publisher=[[Phys.Org]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The record of {{convert|88.8|km/h}} was set on 7 January 2011 at the naval air base {{HMAS|Albatross|air station|6}} in [[Nowra]], breaking the record previously held by the [[General Motors]] car [[Sunraycer]] of {{convert|78.3|km/h}}. The record takes place over a flying {{convert|500|m}} stretch, and is the average of two runs in opposite directions.

==Miscellaneous records==
===Australian Transcontinental (Perth to Sydney) Speed Record===
The Perth to Sydney Transcontinental record has held a certain allure in Solar Car Racing. Hans Tholstrup (the founder of the World Solar Challenge) first completed this journey in ''[[The Quiet Achiever]]'' in under 20 days in 1983. This vehicle is in the collection of the [[National Museum of Australia]] in [[Canberra]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nma.gov.au/collections-search/display?irn=37958 BP Solar Trek vehicle known as the 'Quiet Achiever'], [[National Museum of Australia]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vehicle design==

Solar cars combine technology used in the [[aerospace]], [[bicycle]], [[alternative energy]] and [[automotive]] industries. Unlike most race cars, solar cars are designed with severe [[energy]] constraints imposed by the race regulations. These rules limit the energy used to only that collected from [[solar radiation]], albeit starting with a fully charged battery pack. Some vehicle classes also allow human power input. As a result, optimizing the design to account for aerodynamic drag, vehicle weight, rolling resistance and electrical efficiency are paramount.

A usual design for today's successful vehicles is a small canopy in the middle of a curved wing-like array, entirely covered in cells, with 3 wheels. Before, the cockroach style with a smooth nose fairing into the panel was more successful. At lower speeds, with less powerful arrays, other configurations are viable and easier to construct, e.g. covering available surfaces of existing electric vehicles with solar cells or fastening solar canopies above them.

===Electrical system===
The electrical system controls all of the power entering and leaving the system. The [[battery pack]] stores surplus solar energy produced when the vehicle is stationary or travelling slowly or downhill. Solar cars use a range of batteries including [[lead-acid batteries]], nickel-metal hydride batteries ([[NiMH]]), nickel-cadmium batteries ([[NiCd]]), [[Lithium ion battery|lithium ion batteries]] and [[lithium polymer batteries]].

Power electronics may be used to optimize the electrical system. The maximum power tracker adjusts the operating point of the [[Photovoltaic module|solar array]] to that voltage which produces the most power for the given conditions, e.g. temperature. The battery manager protects the batteries from overcharging. The motor controller controls the desired motor power. Many controllers allow regenerative braking, i.e. power is fed back into the battery during deceleration.

Some solar cars have complex data acquisition systems that monitor the whole electrical system, while basic cars show battery voltage and motor current. In order to judge the range available with varying solar production and motive consumption, an ampere-hour meter multiplies battery current and rate, thus providing the remaining vehicle range at each moment in the given conditions.

A wide variety of motor types have been used. The most efficient motors exceed 98% efficiency. These are brushless three-"phase" DC, electronically commutated, wheel motors, with a [[Halbach array]] configuration for the neodymium-iron-boron magnets, and [[Litz wire]] for the windings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csiro.au/resources/pf11g.html |title=In-wheel motor for solar-powered electric vehicles: technical details (Publication - Technical) |publisher=Csiro.au |date=2009-12-01 |accessdate=2011-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cheaper alternatives are asynchronous AC or brushed DC motors.

[[File:Test chassis.jpg|thumb|right|A test chassis at Ford Proving Grounds in 1992.]]

===Mechanical systems===
The mechanical systems are designed to keep friction and weight to a minimum while maintaining strength and stiffness. Designers normally use aluminium, titanium and composites to provide a structure that meets strength and stiffness requirements whilst being fairly light. Steel is used for some suspension parts on many cars.

Solar cars usually have three wheels, but some have four. Three-wheelers usually have two front wheels and one rear wheel: the front wheels steer and the rear wheel follows. Four-wheel vehicles are set up like normal cars or similarly to three-wheeled vehicles with the two rear wheels close together.

Solar cars have a wide range of [[suspension (vehicle)|suspensions]] because of varying bodies and chassis. The most common front suspension is the [[double wishbone suspension]]. The rear suspension is often a trailing-arm suspension as found in motor cycles.

Solar cars are required to meet rigorous standards for brakes. [[Disc brakes]] are the most commonly used due to their good braking ability and ability to adjust. Mechanical and hydraulic brakes are both widely used. The brake pads or shoes are typically designed to retract to minimize brake drag, on leading cars.

Steering systems for solar cars also vary. The major design factors for steering systems are efficiency, reliability and precision alignment to minimize tire wear and power loss. The popularity of solar car racing has led to some tire manufacturers designing tires for solar vehicles. This has increased overall safety and performance.

All the top teams now use [[wheel motor]]s, eliminating belt or chain drives.

Testing is essential to demonstrating vehicle reliability prior to a race.  It is easy to spend a hundred thousand dollars to gain a two-hour advantage, and equally easy to lose two hours due to reliability issues.

===Solar array===
The solar array consists of hundreds (or thousands) of photovoltaic [[solar cells]] converting sunlight into electricity. Cars can use a variety of solar cell technologies; most often polycrystalline silicon, monocrystalline silicon, or gallium arsenide. The cells are wired together into strings while strings are often wired together to form a panel. Panels normally have voltages close to the nominal battery voltage. The main aim is to get as much cell area in as small a space as possible. Designers encapsulate the cells to protect them from the weather and breakage.

Designing a solar array is more than just stringing a bunch of cells together. A solar array acts like many very small batteries all hooked together in series. The total voltage produced is the sum of all cell voltages. The problem is that if a single cell is in shadow it acts like a [[diode]], blocking the current for the entire string of cells. To design against this, array designers use by-pass diodes in parallel with smaller segments of the string of cells, allowing current around the non-functioning cell(s). Another consideration is that the battery itself can force current backwards through the array unless there are blocking diodes put at the end of each panel.

The power produced by the solar array depends on the weather conditions, the position of the sun and the capacity of the array. At noon on a bright day, a good array can produce over 2 kilowatts (2.6&amp;nbsp;hp). A 6 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; array of 20% cells will produce roughly 6&amp;nbsp;kW·h (22 kJ) of energy during a typical day on the WSC.

Some cars have employed free-standing or integrated [[sails]] to harness wind energy.&lt;ref name="Wind"&gt;The Leading Edge, Tamai, Goro, Robert Bently, Inc., 1999, p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; Races including the [[World Solar Challenge|WSC]] and [[American Solar Challenge|ASC]], consider wind energy to be solar energy, so their race regulations allow this practice.

===Aerodynamics===
Aerodynamic drag is the main source of losses on a solar race car. The aerodynamic drag of a vehicle is the product of the frontal area and its ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''d''&lt;/sub&gt;. For most solar cars the frontal area is 0.75 to 1.3 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. While ''C''&lt;sub&gt;''d''&lt;/sub&gt; as low as 0.10 have been reported, 0.13 is more typical. This needs a great deal of attention to detail.&lt;ref&gt;Roche, Schinkel, Storey, Humphris &amp; Guelden, ''Speed of Light.'' {{ISBN|0-7334-1527-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mass===
The vehicle's mass is also a significant factor.  A light vehicle generates less [[rolling resistance]] and will need smaller lighter [[brake]]s and other [[suspension (vehicle)|suspension]] components. This is the [[virtuous circle]] when designing lightweight vehicles.

===Rolling resistance===
Rolling resistance can be minimized by using the right tires, inflated to the right pressure, correctly aligned, and by minimizing the weight of the vehicle.

===Performance equation===
The design of a solar car is governed by the following work equation:

::&lt;math&gt;\eta \left\{\eta_bE + \frac{Px}{v}\right\} = \left\{W C_{rr1} + N C_{rr2} v + \frac{1}{2}\rho C_d A v^2\right\}x +Wh + \frac{N_a W v^2}{2g}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;ref name="Equation"&gt;Solar Vehicle Performance, Dr. Eric Slimko, December 1, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

which can be usefully simplified to the performance equation

::&lt;math&gt;\eta \left\{\eta_bEv/x + P\right\} = \left\{W C_{rr1} v + \frac{1}{2}\rho C_d A v^3\right\} &lt;/math&gt;

for long distance races, and values seen in practice.

Briefly, the left hand side represents the energy input into the car (batteries and power from the sun) and the right hand side is the energy needed to drive the car along the race route (overcoming rolling resistance, aerodynamic drag, going uphill and accelerating). Everything in this equation can be estimated except ''v''. The parameters include:

Note 1 For the WSC the average panel power can be approximated as (7/9)×nominal power.

Solving the long form of the equation for velocity results in a large equation (approximately 100 terms). Using the power equation as the arbiter, vehicle designers can compare various car designs and evaluate the comparative performance over a given route. Combined with [[Computer-aided engineering|CAE]] and systems modeling, the power equation can be a useful tool in solar car design.

===Race route considerations===
The directional orientation of a solar car race route affects the apparent position of the sun in the sky during a race day, which in turn affects the energy input to the vehicle.
*In a south-to-north race route alignment, for example, the sun would rise over the driver's right shoulder and finish over his left (due to the east-west apparent motion of the sun).
*In an east-west race route alignment, the sun would rise behind the vehicle, and appear to move in the direction of the vehicle's movement, setting in the front of the car.
*A hybrid route alignment includes significant sections of south-north and east-west routes together.

This is significant to designers, who seek to maximize energy input to a panel of solar cells (often called an "array" of cells) by designing the array to point directly toward the sun for as long as possible during the race day. Thus, a south-north race car designer might increase the car's total energy input by using solar cells on the sides of the vehicle where the sun will strike them (or by creating a [[wikt:convex|convex]] array coaxial with the vehicle's movement). In contrast, an east-west race alignment might reduce the benefit from having cells on the side of the vehicle, and thus might encourage design of a flat array.

Because solar cars are often purpose-built, and because arrays do not usually move in relation to the rest of the vehicle (with notable exceptions), this race-route-driven, flat-panel versus convex design compromise is one of the most significant decisions that a solar car designer must make.

For example, the 1990 and 1993 Sunrayce USA events were won by vehicles with significantly convex arrays, corresponding to the south-north race alignments; by 1997, however, most cars in that event had flat arrays to match the change to an east-west route.

==Race strategy==

===Energy consumption===
Optimizing energy consumption is of prime importance in a solar car race. Therefore, it is useful to be able to continually monitor and optimize the vehicle's energy parameters. Given the variable conditions, most teams have race speed optimization programs that continuously update the team on how fast the vehicle should be traveling. Some teams employ [[telemetry]] that relays vehicle performance data to a following support vehicle, which can provide the vehicle's driver with an optimum strategy.

[[File:ASC 2003 elevation plot.png|300px|thumb|Elevation (in meters) of a race route that crossed the Rocky Mountains, from Illinois to California.]]

===Race route===
The race route itself will affect strategy, because the apparent position of the sun in the sky will vary depending various factors which are specific to the vehicle's orientation (see "Race Route Considerations," above).

In addition, elevation changes over a race route can dramatically change the amount of power needed to travel the route.  For example, the 2001 and 2003 [[North American Solar Challenge]] route crossed the Rocky Mountains (see graph at right).

===Weather forecasting===
A successful solar car racing team will need to have access to reliable weather forecasts in order to predict the power input to the vehicle from the sun during each race day.

[[File:Solar flare (TRACE).gif|right|thumb|Post-eruptive loops in the wake of a solar flare, image taken by the [[TRACE]] satellite (photo by NASA)]]
A '''solar proton event''' ('''SPE'''), or "'''proton storm'''", occurs when particles (mostly [[proton]]s) emitted by the Sun become accelerated either close to the Sun during a flare or in interplanetary space by [[Coronal mass ejection|CME]] shocks. The events can include other nuclei such as helium ions and [[HZE ions]]. These particles cause multiple effects. They can penetrate the Earth's magnetic field and cause [[ionization]] in the [[ionosphere]]. The effect is similar to auroral events, except that protons rather than electrons are involved. Energetic protons are a significant radiation hazard to spacecraft and astronauts.

== Description ==
Solar protons normally have insufficient energy to penetrate the Earth's magnetic field. However, during unusually strong flares, protons can be produced with sufficient energies to reach the Earth's magnetosphere and ionosphere around the [[north pole]] and [[south pole]].

Protons are charged particles and are therefore influenced by magnetic fields. When the energetic protons leave the [[Sun]], they preferentially follow (or are guided by) the Sun's powerful magnetic field. When solar protons enter the [[Magnetosphere#Earth's magnetosphere|Earth's magnetosphere]] where the magnetic fields are stronger than solar magnetic fields, they are guided by the Earth's magnetic field into the polar regions where the majority of the Earth's magnetic field lines enter and exit.

Energetic protons that are guided into the polar regions collide with atmospheric constituents and release their energy through the process of ionization. The majority of the energy is extinguished in the extreme lower region of the ionosphere (around 50–80&amp;nbsp;km in altitude). This area is particularly important to [[radio propagation|ionospheric radio communications]] because this is the area where most of the absorption of radio signal energy occurs. The enhanced ionization produced by incoming energetic protons increases the absorption levels in the lower ionosphere and can have the effect of completely blocking all ionospheric radio communications through the polar regions. Such events are known as Polar Cap Absorption events (or PCAs). These events commence and last as long as the energy of incoming protons at approximately greater than 10 [[MeV]] (million electron volts) exceeds roughly 10 [[particle flux unit|pfu]] (particle flux units or {{frac|particles|[[steradian|sr]]&amp;middot;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;middot;[[second|s]]}}) at [[geosynchronous]] satellite altitudes.

The more severe proton events can be associated with geomagnetic storms that can cause widespread disruption to [[Electric power transmission|electrical grid]]s. However, proton events themselves are not responsible for producing anomalies in power grids, nor are they responsible for producing geomagnetic storms. Power grids are only sensitive to fluctuations in the Earth's magnetic field.

Extremely intense solar proton flares capable of producing energetic protons with energies in excess of 100 MeV can increase neutron count rates at ground levels through secondary radiation effects. These rare events are known as Ground Level Enhancements(or GLEs). Some events produce large amounts of HZE ions, although their contribution to the total radiation is small compared to the level of protons.&lt;ref name="NASA/TP-1999-209320"&gt;[http://hdl.handle.net/2060/19990051001 Contribution of High Charge and Energy (HZE) Ions During Solar-Particle Event of September 29, 1989] Kim, Myung-Hee Y.; Wilson, John W.; Cucinotta, Francis A.; Simonsen, Lisa C.; Atwell, William; Badavi, Francis F.; Miller, Jack, NASA Johnson Space Center; Langley Research Center, May 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no substantive scientific evidence to suggest that energetic proton events are harmful to human health at ground levels, particularly at latitudes where most of the Earth's population resides. The Earth's magnetic field is exceptionally good at preventing the radiative effects of energetic particles from reaching ground levels. High altitude commercial transpolar aircraft flights have measured increases in radiation during energetic proton events, but a warning system is in place that limits these effects by alerting pilots to lower their cruising altitudes. Aircraft flights away from the polar regions are far less likely to see an impact from solar proton events.

Significant proton radiation exposure can be experienced by astronauts who are outside of the protective shield of the Earth's magnetosphere, such as an astronaut in-transit to, or located on the Moon. However, the effects can be minimized if astronauts are in a low-Earth orbit and remain confined to the most heavily shielded regions of their spacecraft. Proton radiation levels in low earth orbit increase with orbital inclination. Therefore, the closer a spacecraft approaches the polar regions, the greater the exposure to energetic proton radiation will be.

Astronauts have reported seeing [[Cosmic ray visual phenomena|flashes or streaks of light]] as energetic protons interact with their optic tissues. Similar flashes and streaks of light occur when energetic protons strike the sensitive optical electronics in spacecraft (such as star trackers and other cameras). The effect can be so pronounced that during extreme events, it is not possible to obtain quality images of the Sun or stars. This can cause spacecraft to lose their orientation, which is critical if ground controllers are to maintain control.

Energetic proton storms can also electrically charge spacecraft to levels that can damage electronic components. They can also cause electronic components to behave erratically. For example, solid state memory on spacecraft can be altered, which may cause data or software contamination and result in unexpected (phantom) spacecraft commands being executed. Energetic proton storms also destroy the efficiency of the solar panels that are designed to collect and convert sunlight to electricity. During years of exposure to energetic proton activity from the Sun, spacecraft can lose a substantial amount of electrical power that may require important instruments to be turned off.

:''Square leg is also a fielding position in cricket; see [[Fielding (cricket)]].''

'''Square Leg''' was a 1980 [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|government]] [[civil defense|home defence]] Command Post and field exercise, which tested the [[Transition to war|Transition to War]] and Home Defence roles of the [[Ministry of Defence]] and British government. Part of the exercise involved a mock nuclear attack on Britain. It was assumed that 131 nuclear weapons would fall on Britain with a total yield of 205 [[megatons]] (69 [[ground burst]]; 62 [[air burst]])&lt;ref&gt;''Doomsday, Britain after Nuclear Attack'', p. 102&lt;/ref&gt; with yields of 500 KT to 3 MT &lt;ref&gt;https://falloutwarning.wordpress.com/category/uk/
&lt;/ref&gt; That was felt to be a reasonably realistic scenario, but the report stated that a total strike in excess of 1,000 megatons would be likely.

Mortality was estimated at 29 million (53 percent of the population); serious injuries at 7 million (12 percent); short-term survivors at 19 million (35 percent).

Square Leg was criticised for a number of reasons: the weapons used were exclusively in the high-yield megaton range, with an average of 1.5 [[TNT equivalent|megatons]] per bomb, but a realistic attack based on known Soviet capabilities would have seen mixed weapons yields, including many missile-based warheads in the low hundred kiloton range.  Also, no targets in [[Inner London]] are attacked (for example, [[Whitehall]], the centre of [[British government]]); towns such as [[Eastbourne]] are hit for no obvious reason.&lt;ref&gt;''Doomsday, Britain after Nuclear Attack'', p. 105&lt;/ref&gt;

Operation Square Leg was one of the exercises used to estimate the destructiveness of a Soviet nuclear attack in the [[1984 in television|1984]] [[BBC]] production ''[[Threads]]''.

'''Stefan Oschmann''' (born 25 July 1957) is a German businessman, who has served as the [[chief executive officer]] (CEO) and chairman of the executive board of the Germany-based [[Merck Group]] since April 2016. Before joining the Merck Group, Oschmann worked for [[Merck &amp; Co.]], in a range of senior executive positions in Europe and the developing world, from 1989 to 2011. 

==Early life==
Oschmann was born on 25 July 1957 in [[Würzburg]], Germany.&lt;ref name=IFPMAbio&gt;{{cite web|title=2016 IFPMA General Assembly Biographies|url=https://www.ifpma.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IFPMA_Assembly_Biographies_FINAL.pdf|publisher=IFPMA|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170622070906/https://www.ifpma.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/IFPMA_Assembly_Biographies_FINAL.pdf|archivedate=22 June 2017|page=4|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dld-conference.com/users/stefan-oschmann|title=Stefan Oschmann|author=|date=|website=DLD Conference|accessdate=1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He holds a doctorate in [[veterinary medicine]] from the [[Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich]].&lt;ref name=Echo/&gt;

==Career==
[[File:Stefan Oschmann MSC 2017 2.jpg|thumb|Oschmann during the [[Munich Security Conference|MSC]] 2017]]
Oschmann started his career at an agency of the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]].&lt;ref name=Echo/&gt; In 1987 he started working for the German Animal Health Federation (''Bundesverband für Tiergesundheit''), the [[trade association]] for German manufacturers of veterinary drugs and feed additives.&lt;ref name=IFPMAbio/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bundesverband für Tiergesundheit|url=https://vet-magazin.de/firmennews-deutschland/Bundesverband-Tiergesundheit.html|publisher=Vet Magazin|accessdate=22 June 2017|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1989 to 2011, Oschmann worked for Merck Sharp &amp; Dohme (MSD), the European operations of [[Merck &amp; Co.]] He was managing director of MSD Austria from 1994, vice president for [[Central and Eastern Europe]] from 1998, vice president of MSD Europe and managing director of MSD Germany from 1999, senior vice president for worldwide human health marketing from 2005, president for [[Europe, the Middle East and Africa|Europe, the Middle East, Africa]], and Canada from 2006 and finally MSD's president of [[emerging markets]] from 2009 to 2011.&lt;ref name="bigthink"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bigthink.com/experts/stefanoschmann|title=Stefan Oschmann &amp;#124; Big Think|publisher=bigthink.com|accessdate=9 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{General relativity sidebar}}

The '''stress–energy tensor''', sometimes '''stress–energy–momentum tensor''' or '''energy–momentum tensor''', is a [[tensor]] quantity in [[physics]] that describes the [[density]] and [[flux]] of [[energy]] and [[momentum]] in [[spacetime]], generalizing the [[Cauchy stress tensor|stress tensor]] of [[Newtonian physics]]. It is an attribute of [[matter]], [[radiation]], and non-gravitational [[force field (physics)|force field]]s. The stress–energy tensor is the source of the [[gravitational field]] in the [[Einstein field equations]] of [[general relativity]], just as mass density is the source of such a field in [[Newtonian gravity]].

==Definition==
The stress–energy tensor involves the use of superscripted variables (''not'' exponents; see [[tensor index notation]] and [[Einstein notation|Einstein summation notation]]). If [[Cartesian coordinates]] in [[SI units]] are used, then the components of the position [[four-vector]] are given by: {{nowrap|1=''x''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; = ''t''}}, {{nowrap|1=''x''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; = ''x''}}, {{nowrap|1=''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''y''}}, and {{nowrap|1=''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = ''z''}}, where ''t'' is time in seconds, and ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' are distances in meters.

The stress–energy tensor is defined as the [[tensor]] ''T''&lt;sup&gt;''αβ''&lt;/sup&gt; of order two that gives the [[flux]] of the ''α''th component of the [[momentum]] [[vector (geometric)|vector]] across a surface with constant ''x''&lt;sup&gt;''β''&lt;/sup&gt; [[coordinate]]. In the theory of [[general relativity|relativity]], this momentum vector is taken as the [[four-momentum]]. In general relativity, the stress–energy tensor is symmetric,&lt;ref&gt;On pp. 141–142 of [[Gravitation (book)|Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler]], section 5.7 "Symmetry of the Stress–Energy Tensor" begins with "All the stress–energy tensors explored above were symmetric. That they could not have been otherwise one sees as follows."&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;T^{\alpha \beta} = T^{\beta \alpha}.&lt;/math&gt;

In some alternative theories like [[Einstein–Cartan theory]], the stress–energy tensor may not be perfectly symmetric because of a nonzero [[spin tensor]], which geometrically corresponds to a nonzero [[torsion tensor]].

==Identifying the components of the tensor==
Because the stress–energy tensor is of order two, its components can be displayed in 4&amp;thinsp;×&amp;thinsp;4 matrix form:
:&lt;math&gt;
(T^{\mu\nu})_{\mu,\nu=0,1,2,3} = \begin{pmatrix} T^{00} &amp; T^{01} &amp; T^{02} &amp; T^{03} \\ T^{10} &amp; T^{11} &amp; T^{12} &amp; T^{13} \\ T^{20} &amp; T^{21} &amp; T^{22} &amp; T^{23} \\ T^{30} &amp; T^{31} &amp; T^{32} &amp; T^{33} \end{pmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;

In the following, ''i'' and ''k'' range from 1 through 3.

The time–time component is the density of relativistic mass, i.e. the [[energy density]] divided by the speed of light squared.&lt;ref&gt;Charles W., Misner, Thorne, Kip S., Wheeler, John A., (1973). Gravitation. San Frandisco: W. H. Freeman and Company. {{ISBN|0-7167-0334-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Its components have a direct physical interpretation. In the case of a perfect fluid this component is
:&lt;math&gt;T^{00} = \rho,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the [[relativistic mass]] per unit volume, and for an electromagnetic field in otherwise empty space this component is
:&lt;math&gt;T^{00} = {1 \over c^2}\left(\frac{1}{2} \epsilon_0 E^2 + \frac{1}{2\mu_0} B^2 \right),&lt;/math&gt;

where ''E'' and ''B'' are the electric and magnetic fields, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;d'Inverno, R.A, (1992). Introducing Einstein's Relativity. New York: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-19-859686-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The flux of relativistic mass across the ''x&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt;'' surface is equivalent to the density of the ''i''th component of linear momentum,
:&lt;math&gt;T^{0i} = T^{i0}.&lt;/math&gt;

The components
:&lt;math&gt; T^{ik}&lt;/math&gt;
represent flux of ''i''th component of linear momentum across the ''x&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;'' surface.  In particular,
:&lt;math&gt; T^{ii}&lt;/math&gt;
(not summed) represents [[tensile stress|normal stress]], which is called [[pressure]] when it is independent of direction. The remaining components
:&lt;math&gt; T^{ik} \quad i \ne k &lt;/math&gt;
represent [[shear stress]] (compare with the [[stress (physics)|stress tensor]]).

In [[solid state physics]] and [[fluid mechanics]], the stress tensor is defined to be the spatial components of the stress–energy tensor in the [[proper frame]] of reference. In other words, the stress energy tensor in [[engineering]] ''differs'' from the stress–energy tensor here by a momentum convective term.

===Covariant and mixed forms===

In most of this article we work with the contravariant form, ''T''&lt;sup&gt;''μν''&lt;/sup&gt; of the stress–energy tensor. However, it is often necessary to work with the covariant form,
:&lt;math&gt;T_{\mu \nu} = T^{\alpha \beta} g_{\alpha \mu} g_{\beta \nu},&lt;/math&gt;

or the mixed form,
:&lt;math&gt;T^\mu{}_\nu = T^{\mu \alpha} g_{\alpha \nu},&lt;/math&gt;

or as a mixed [[tensor density]]
:&lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{T}^\mu{}_\nu = T^\mu{}_\nu \sqrt{-g} \,.&lt;/math&gt;

In this article we use the spacelike [[Sign convention#Metric signature|sign convention]] (−+++) for the metric signature.

==Conservation law==

===In special relativity===

{{see also|Relativistic angular momentum}}

The stress–energy tensor is the conserved [[Noether's theorem|Noether current]] associated with [[spacetime]] [[translation (physics)|translation]]s.

The divergence of the non-gravitational stress–energy is zero. In other words, non-gravitational energy and momentum are conserved,
:&lt;math&gt;0 = T^{\mu \nu}{}_{;\nu} = \nabla_\nu T^{\mu \nu}{}. \!&lt;/math&gt;
When gravity is negligible and using a [[Cartesian coordinate system]] for spacetime, this may be expressed in terms of partial derivatives as 
:&lt;math&gt;0 = T^{\mu \nu}{}_{,\nu} = \partial_{\nu} T^{\mu \nu}. \!&lt;/math&gt;

The integral form of this is
:&lt;math&gt;0 = \int_{\partial N} T^{\mu \nu} \mathrm{d}^3 s_{\nu} \!&lt;/math&gt;

where ''N'' is any compact four-dimensional region of spacetime; &lt;math&gt;\partial N&lt;/math&gt; is its boundary, a three-dimensional hypersurface; and &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}^3 s_{\nu}&lt;/math&gt; is an element of the boundary regarded as the outward pointing normal.

In flat spacetime and using Cartesian coordinates, if one combines this with the symmetry of the stress–energy tensor, one can show that [[angular momentum]] is also conserved:
:&lt;math&gt;0 = (x^{\alpha} T^{\mu \nu} - x^{\mu} T^{\alpha \nu})_{,\nu} . \!&lt;/math&gt;

===In general relativity===
When gravity is non-negligible or when using arbitrary coordinate systems, the divergence of the stress–energy still vanishes. But in this case,  a [[Divergence#Generalizations|coordinate free definition of the divergence]] is used which incorporates the [[covariant derivative]]
:&lt;math&gt;0 = \operatorname{div} T = T^{\mu \nu}{}_{;\nu} = \nabla_{\nu} T^{\mu \nu} = T^{\mu \nu}{}_{,\nu} +  \Gamma^{\mu}{}_{\sigma \nu}T^{\sigma \nu} + \Gamma^{\nu}{}_{\sigma \nu} T^{\mu \sigma}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\Gamma^{\mu}{}_{\sigma \nu} &lt;/math&gt; is the [[Christoffel symbol]] which is the gravitational [[force field (physics)|force field]].

Consequently, if &lt;math&gt;\xi^{\mu}&lt;/math&gt; is any [[Killing vector field]], then the conservation law associated with the symmetry generated by the Killing vector field may be expressed as
:&lt;math&gt;0 = \nabla_\nu (\xi^{\mu} T_{\mu}^{\nu}) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{-g}} \partial_\nu( \sqrt{-g} \ \xi^{\mu} T_{\mu}^{\nu}) &lt;/math&gt;

The integral form of this is
:&lt;math&gt;0 = \int_{\partial N} \sqrt{-g} \ \xi^{\mu} T_{\mu}^{\nu} \ \mathrm{d}^3 s_{\nu} = \int_{\partial N}  \xi^{\mu} \mathfrak{T}_{\mu}^{\nu} \ \mathrm{d}^3 s_{\nu}&lt;/math&gt;

==In general relativity==
In [[general relativity]], the [[symmetric]] stress–energy tensor acts as the source of spacetime [[Riemann curvature tensor|curvature]], and is the current density associated with [[gauge transformation]]s of gravity which are general curvilinear [[coordinate transformation]]s. (If there is [[Torsion tensor|torsion]], then the tensor is no longer symmetric. This corresponds to the case with a nonzero [[spin tensor]] in [[Einstein–Cartan theory|Einstein–Cartan gravity theory]].)

In general relativity, the [[partial derivatives]] used in special relativity are replaced by [[covariant derivative]]s. What this means is that the continuity equation no longer implies that the non-gravitational energy and momentum expressed by the tensor are absolutely conserved, i.e. the gravitational field can do work on matter and vice versa. In the classical limit of [[Newtonian gravity]], this has a simple interpretation: energy is being exchanged with gravitational [[potential energy]], which is not included in the tensor, and momentum is being transferred through the field to other bodies. In general relativity the [[Stress–energy–momentum pseudotensor#Landau–Lifshitz pseudotensor|Landau–Lifshitz pseudotensor]] is a unique way to define the ''gravitational'' field energy and momentum densities. Any such [[Stress–energy–momentum pseudotensor|stress–energy pseudotensor]] can be made to vanish locally by a coordinate transformation.

In curved spacetime, the spacelike [[integral]] now depends on the spacelike slice, in general. There is in fact no way to define a global energy–momentum vector in a general curved spacetime.

=== The Einstein field equations ===
{{Main|Einstein field equations}}

In general relativity, the stress tensor is studied in the context of the Einstein field equations which are often written as

:&lt;math&gt;R_{\mu \nu} - \tfrac{1}{2} R\,g_{\mu \nu} + \Lambda g_{\mu \nu} = {8 \pi G \over c^4} T_{\mu \nu},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;R_{\mu \nu}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Ricci tensor]], &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the Ricci scalar (the [[tensor contraction]] of the Ricci tensor), &lt;math&gt;g_{\mu \nu}\,&lt;/math&gt; is the [[metric tensor (general relativity)|metric tensor]], {{mvar|Λ}} is the [[cosmological constant]] (negligible at the scale of a galaxy or smaller), and &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is the [[universal gravitational constant]].

==Stress–energy in special situations==

===Isolated particle===
In special relativity, the stress–energy of a non-interacting particle with mass ''m'' and trajectory &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x}_\text{p}(t) &lt;/math&gt; is:
:&lt;math&gt;T^{\alpha \beta}(\mathbf{x},t) = \frac{m \, v^{\alpha}(t) v^{\beta}(t)}{\sqrt{1 - (v/c)^2}}\;\, \delta(\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}_\text{p}(t)) = \frac{E}{c^2}\;
 v^{\alpha}(t) v^{\beta}(t)\;\, \delta(\mathbf{x} - \mathbf{x}_\text{p}(t)) &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;(v^{\alpha})_{\alpha=0,1,2,3} \!&lt;/math&gt; is the velocity vector (which should not be confused with [[four-velocity]], since it is missing a &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt;)
:&lt;math&gt; (v^{\alpha})_{\alpha=0,1,2,3} = \left(1, \frac{d \mathbf{x}_\text{p}}{dt}(t) \right) \,,&lt;/math&gt;
δ is the [[Dirac delta function]] and &lt;math&gt; E = \sqrt{p^2 c^2 + m^2 c^4} &lt;/math&gt; is the [[energy]] of the particle.

===Stress–energy of a fluid in equilibrium===
For a [[perfect fluid]] in [[thermodynamic equilibrium]], the stress–energy tensor takes on a particularly simple form
:&lt;math&gt;T^{\alpha \beta} \, = \left(\rho + {p \over c^2}\right)u^{\alpha}u^{\beta} + p g^{\alpha \beta}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the mass–energy density (kilograms per cubic meter), &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is the hydrostatic pressure ([[pascal (unit)|pascals]]), &lt;math&gt;u^{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; is the fluid's [[four velocity]], and &lt;math&gt;g^{\alpha \beta}&lt;/math&gt; is the reciprocal of the [[metric tensor (general relativity)|metric tensor]]. Therefore, the trace is given by
:&lt;math&gt;T  = 3p - \rho c^2 \,.&lt;/math&gt;

The four velocity satisfies
:&lt;math&gt;u^{\alpha} u^{\beta} g_{\alpha \beta} = - c^2 \,.&lt;/math&gt;

In an [[inertial frame of reference]] comoving with the fluid, better known as the fluid's [[proper frame]] of reference, the four velocity is 
:&lt;math&gt;(u^{\alpha})_{\alpha=0,1,2,3} = (1, 0, 0, 0) \,,&lt;/math&gt;

the reciprocal of the metric tensor is simply
:&lt;math&gt;
(g^{\alpha \beta})_{\alpha,\beta=0,1,2,3} \, = \left( \begin{matrix}
                   - c^{-2} &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
                   0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
                   0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
                   0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1    
      \end{matrix} \right)
\, &lt;/math&gt;

and the stress–energy tensor is a diagonal matrix
:&lt;math&gt;
(T^{\alpha \beta})_{\alpha,\beta=0,1,2,3} = \left( \begin{matrix}
                   \rho &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
                   0 &amp; p &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
                   0 &amp; 0 &amp; p &amp; 0 \\
                   0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; p    
      \end{matrix} \right).
&lt;/math&gt;

===Electromagnetic stress–energy tensor===
{{Main|Electromagnetic stress–energy tensor}}
The Hilbert stress–energy tensor of a source-free electromagnetic field is
:&lt;math&gt; T^{\mu \nu} = \frac{1}{\mu_0} \left( F^{\mu \alpha} g_{\alpha \beta} F^{\nu \beta} - \frac{1}{4} g^{\mu \nu} F_{\delta \gamma} F^{\delta \gamma} \right) &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; F_{\mu \nu} &lt;/math&gt; is the [[electromagnetic field tensor]].

===Scalar field===
{{Main|Klein–Gordon equation}}
The stress–energy tensor for a complex scalar field &lt;math&gt;\phi &lt;/math&gt; which satisfies the Klein–Gordon equation is
:&lt;math&gt;T^{\mu\nu} = \frac{\hbar^2}{m} (g^{\mu \alpha} g^{\nu \beta} + g^{\mu \beta} g^{\nu \alpha} - g^{\mu\nu} g^{\alpha \beta}) \partial_{\alpha}\bar\phi \partial_{\beta}\phi - g^{\mu\nu} m c^2 \bar\phi \phi ,&lt;/math&gt;
and when the metric is flat (Minkowski) its components work out to be:
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} T^{00} &amp; =  \frac{\hbar^2}{m c^4} \left(\partial_0 \bar{\phi} \partial_0 \phi + c^2 \partial_k \bar{\phi} \partial_k \phi \right) + m \bar{\phi} \phi, \\
T^{0i} = T^{i0} &amp; = - \frac{\hbar^2}{m c^2} \left(\partial_0 \bar{\phi} \partial_i \phi + \partial_i \bar{\phi} \partial_0 \phi \right),\ \mathrm{and} \\
T^{ij} &amp; = \frac{\hbar^2}{m} \left(\partial_i \bar{\phi} \partial_j \phi + \partial_j \bar{\phi} \partial_i \phi \right) - \delta_{ij} \left(\frac{\hbar^2}{m} \eta^{\alpha\beta} \partial_\alpha \bar{\phi} \partial_\beta \phi + m c^2 \bar{\phi} \phi\right). 
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

==Variant definitions of stress–energy==
There are a number of inequivalent definitions of non-gravitational stress–energy:

===Hilbert stress–energy tensor===
The Hilbert stress–energy tensor is defined as the [[functional derivative]]
:&lt;math&gt;T_{\mu\nu} = \frac{-2}{\sqrt{-g}}\frac{\delta (\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{matter}} \sqrt{-g}) }{\delta g^{\mu\nu}} = - 2 \frac{\delta \mathcal{L}_\mathrm{matter}}{\delta g^{\mu\nu}} + g_{\mu\nu} \mathcal{L}_\mathrm{matter} ,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{matter}}&lt;/math&gt; is the nongravitational part of the [[Lagrangian (field theory)|Lagrangian]] density of the [[action (physics)|action]]. This is symmetric and gauge-invariant. See [[Einstein–Hilbert action]] for more information.

===Canonical stress–energy tensor===
[[Noether's theorem]] implies that there is a conserved current associated with translations through space and time. This is called the canonical stress–energy tensor. Generally, this is not symmetric and if we have some gauge theory, it may not be [[gauge invariant]] because space-dependent [[gauge transformation]]s do not commute with spatial translations.

In [[general relativity]], the translations are with respect to the coordinate system and as such, do not transform covariantly. See the section below on the gravitational stress–energy pseudo-tensor.

===Belinfante–Rosenfeld stress–energy tensor===
{{main|Belinfante–Rosenfeld stress–energy tensor}}
In the presence of spin or other intrinsic angular momentum, the canonical Noether stress energy tensor fails to be symmetric. The Belinfante–Rosenfeld stress energy tensor is constructed from the canonical stress–energy tensor and the spin current in such a way as to be symmetric and still conserved. In general relativity, this modified tensor agrees with the Hilbert stress–energy tensor.

==Gravitational stress–energy==
{{Main|Stress–energy–momentum pseudotensor}}
By the [[equivalence principle]] gravitational stress–energy will always vanish locally at any chosen point in some chosen frame, therefore gravitational stress–energy cannot be expressed as a non-zero tensor; instead we have to use a [[pseudotensor]].

In general relativity, there are many possible distinct definitions of the gravitational stress–energy–momentum pseudotensor. These include the Einstein pseudotensor and the [[Landau–Lifshitz pseudotensor]]. The Landau–Lifshitz pseudotensor can be reduced to zero at any event in spacetime by choosing an appropriate coordinate system.

'''Thermoluminescence''' is a form of [[luminescence]] that is exhibited by certain crystalline materials, such as some minerals, when previously absorbed energy from [[electromagnetic radiation]] or other [[ionizing radiation]] is re-emitted as light upon heating of the material. The phenomenon is distinct from that of [[black-body radiation]].

==Physics==
High energy radiation creates electronic [[excited state]]s in crystalline materials. In some materials, these states are ''trapped'', or ''arrested'', for extended periods of time by localized defects, or imperfections, in the lattice interrupting the normal intermolecular or inter-atomic interactions in the crystal lattice. Quantum-mechanically, these [[Quantum state|state]]s are [[stationary state]]s which have no formal time dependence; however, they are not stable energetically. Heating the material enables the trapped states to interact with [[phonon]]s, i.e. lattice vibrations, to rapidly decay into lower-energy states, causing the emission of [[photon]]s in the process.

==Use in dating==
[[File:TSL curves.png|thumb|Graph of TSL (thermally stimulated luminescence)]]
{{main|Thermoluminescence dating|Thermoluminescent Dosimeter}}
The amount of luminescence is proportional to the original dose of radiation received. In [[thermoluminescence dating]], this can be used to date buried objects that have been heated in the past, since the ionizing dose received from [[radioactive]] elements in the soil or from [[cosmic ray]]s is proportional to age.  This phenomenon has been applied in the [[thermoluminescent dosimeter]], a device to measure the radiation dose received by a chip of suitable material that is carried by a person or placed with an object.

Thermoluminescence is a common [[geochronology]] tool for dating [[pottery]] or other fired archeological materials, as heat empties or resets the thermoluminescent signature of the material (Figure 1).  Subsequent recharging of this material from ambient radiation can then be empirically dated by the equation:

Age = (subsequently accumulated dose of ambient radiation) / (dose accumulated per year)

This technique was modified for use as a ''passive sand migration analysis tool''.&lt;ref name=keizars&gt;{{cite journal

[[Beach nourishment]] is a problem worldwide and receives large amounts of attention due to the millions of dollars spent yearly in order to keep beaches beautified for tourists,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/science/20061225-0031-waikikisand.html Waikiki sand]&lt;/ref&gt; e.g., in Waikiki, Hawaii.  Sands with sizes 90-150 μm (very fine sand) were found to migrate from the swash zone 67% faster than sand grains of 150-212 μm (fine sand; Figure 3).  Furthermore, the technique was shown to provide a passive method of policing sand replenishment and a passive method of observing riverine or other sand inputs along shorelines (Figure 4).&lt;ref name=keizars/&gt;

'''Wood grain''' is the longitudinal arrangement of [[wood]] fibers&lt;ref&gt;"grain, n.1". def 15. ''Oxford English Dictionary'' Second Edition on CD-ROM (v. 4.0) © Oxford University Press 2009&lt;/ref&gt; or the pattern resulting from this.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/grain grain].'', def. 7. ''Dictionary.com Unabridged''. Random House, Inc. 13 Jan. 2015. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition and meanings==
[[R. Bruce Hoadley]] wrote that ''grain'' is a "confusingly versatile term" with numerous different uses, including the direction of the wood cells (e.g., ''straight grain'', ''spiral grain''), surface appearance or [[Figure (wood)|figure]], [[Growth ring|growth-ring]] placement (e.g., ''vertical grain''), plane of the cut (e.g., ''end grain''), rate of growth (e.g., ''narrow grain''), and relative cell size (e.g., ''open grain'').&lt;ref name="Hoadley"&gt;Hoadley, R. Bruce. "Glossary." ''Understanding Wood: A Craftsman's Guide to Wood Technology''. Newtown, Conn.: Taunton, 1980. 265. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physical aspects==
Perhaps most important physical aspect of wood grain in [[woodworking]] is the grain direction or slope (e.g. [[Plane (tool)#Use|against the grain]]). The two basic categories of grain are straight and cross grain. Straight grain runs parallel to the longitudinal axis of the piece. Cross grain deviates from the longitudinal axis in two ways, spiral grain or diagonal grain. The amount of deviation is called the slope of the grain.&lt;ref name="Hoadley" /&gt;

In describing the application of a woodworking technique to a given piece of wood, the direction of the technique may be:
* with the grain (easy; giving a clean result)
* against the grain (heavy going; giving a poor result such as chipping or tear-out)
* across the grain (direction of cut is across the grain lines, but the plane of the cut is still aligned with them)
* end grain (at right angles to the grain, for example trimming the end of a plank)

Grain alignment must be considered when [[Woodworking joints|joining]] pieces of wood, or designing wooden structures. For example, a [[Stress (mechanics)|stressed]] span is less likely to fail if tension is applied along the grain, rather than across the grain. Grain direction will also affect the type of warping seen in the finished item.&lt;ref&gt;Wood Movement, [http://www.woodworkdetails.com/knowledge/wood/movement WoodworkDetails.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

In describing the alignment of the wood in the tree a distinction may be made. Basic grain descriptions and types include:
* straight - grain which runs in a single direction, parallel to the axis of the tree
* spiral - grain which spirals around the axis of the tree
* interlocked - grain which spirals around the axis of the tree, but reverses its direction for periods of years resulting in alternating directions of the spiral grain.

[[File:RedGumTable.jpg|thumb|right|typically figured red gum table]]
[[File:MountainAshFloor.jpg|thumb|mountain ash floor, showing some [[flame maple|fiddleback]] figure]]

==Aesthetic aspects==
In its simplest aesthetic meaning, wood grain is the alternating regions of relatively darker and lighter wood resulting from the differing growth parameters occurring in different seasons (i.e., [[dendrochronology#Growth rings|growth rings]]) on a cut or split piece of wood.

Causes including fungus, [[burls]], stress, knots, special grain alignments, and others produce [[Figure_(wood)|figure]] in wood. Their rarity often promotes the value of both the raw material, and the finished work it becomes a part of. These include:

* bird's eye
* quilted
* [[flame maple|fiddleback]]
* curly

The way a given piece of wood has been sawn affects both its appearance and physical properties:
* flat-grain: flat-sawn, slab-sawn, plain sawn, bastard-sawn,&lt;ref&gt;Punmia, B.C., Ashok Kumar Jain, and Arun Kumar Jain. ''Basic civil engineering: for B.E. / B.Tech first year courses of various universities including M.D.U. and K.U.'', Haryana. New Delhi: Laxmi Publications, 2003. 78. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; or sawn "through and through".
* edge grain: [[quarter-sawn]] or [[rift sawing|rift-sawn]] or straight-grained, and
* end grain: the grain of wood seen when it is cut across the growth rings.

Strictly speaking, grain is not always the same as the ''[[figure (wood)|figure]]'' of wood.

There is irregular grain in [[burr wood]] or burl wood, but this is result of very many knots.
