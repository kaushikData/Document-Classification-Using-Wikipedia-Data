'''''2 Jennifer''''' is a 2016 indie [[horror film]] written and directed by Hunter Johnson, who also stars in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://horrornews.net/109848/film-review-2-jennifer-2016/|title=Film Review: 2 Jennifer (2016)|last=|first=|date=|website=HorrorNews.net|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film is a sequel to [[James Cullen Bressack|James Cullen Bressack's]] ''[[To Jennifer]]'' and features Johnson as a young man intent on creating a sequel to the 2013 film.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/101088/james-cullen-bressack-hunter-johnson-prepping-2-jennifer/|title=James Cullen Bressack and Hunter Johnson Prepping 2 Jennifer|last=Rigney|first=Todd|date=2015-05-11|work=Dread Central|access-date=2017-04-18|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
Spencer wants to create a sequel to one of his favorite horror films, ''To Jennifer,'' and is hoping that doing so will launch his career as a filmmaker. As such, he is playing one of the movie's main characters and wants to find the perfect woman to serve as the film's titular character, even going so far as to insist that they only consider actresses that are named Jennifer. However as they find their perfect Jennifer and filming commences, Spencer's hold on reality grows more and more tenuous.

*David Coupe as Mack
*Lara Jean Mummert as Jennifer

==Reception==
''[[Starburst (magazine)|Starburst]]'' wrote a favorable review of the movie, as they felt that it was "refreshing to have a sequel work so well and for it actually not be essential that one has seen the original. Ultimately, it’s a more enjoyable ride than the first, with a payoff that packs quite a wallop."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.starburstmagazine.com/reviews/dvd-and-blu-ray-home-entertainment-reviews/17167-2-jennifer-review|title=2 JENNIFER|last=UNSWORTH|first=MARTIN|date=|website=Starburst|language=en-gb|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, [[Dread Central]] panned ''2 Jennifer'', stating that "Fans of bargain-basement snuff will eat this one right up, but for this lad, I prefer to keep my eyesight on level ground… solid, stable, non-shaky ground."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/reviews/182543/2-jennifer-2016/|title=2 Jennifer (2016) - Dread Central|last=Boiselle|first=Matt|date=2016-08-19|work=Dread Central|access-date=2017-04-18|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3830">'''Lottery.com''' (AutoLotto, Inc.) is an online mobile [[lottery]] ticket management system for lottery players. The company has created a mobile app that lets users scan and check paper tickets for winnings and, in some states, play [[Powerball]] and [[Mega Millions]] on their mobile device.

==History==

[https://lottery.com Lottery.com], formerly AutoLotto, was founded in February 2015&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kolodny|first1=Lora|title=AutoLotto launches its mobile Powerball app|url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/07/autolotto-launches-its-mobile-powerball-app/|website=TechCrunch|publisher=TechCrunch|accessdate=7 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and launched in [[New Hampshire]] in June 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kolodny|first1=Lora|title=AutoLotto launches its mobile Powerball app|url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/06/07/autolotto-launches-its-mobile-powerball-app/|website=Techcrunch|publisher=AOL Inc.|accessdate=19 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lottery.com app allows users to play the lottery from their smartphone or tablet. By November 2015, the company had raised $2.4 million in seed funding from [[500 Startups]] accelerators and Aurum Partners, an investment firm linked to the [[San Francisco 49ers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kolodny|first1=Laura|title=AutoLotto Raises $2.4 Million for Mobile Powerball App|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/venturecapital/2015/11/02/autolotto-raises-2-4-million-for-mobile-powerball-app/|website=Wall Street Journal|publisher=Wall Street Journal|accessdate=15 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2017, the mobile lottery service announced its $17 million Series A&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/07/10/a-mobile-powerball-app-wants-to-help-millennials-buy-lottery-tickets.html|title=A mobile Powerball app wants to help millennials buy lottery tickets|website=CNBC|last=Kolodny|first=Lora|date=2017-07-10|access-date=2017-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; funding round. The investment was led by a series of private, strategic investors to support the growth and expansion of the company’s mobile app, which allows users to play the Powerball and get lottery results on their phone. In August 2017, AutoLotto officially rebranded as Lottery.com and published their new website, [https://lottery.com lottery.com]. The Lottery.com app is available nationwide with lottery ticket scanning and tracking abilities.

The startup has created a mobile app that lets users scan and check paper tickets for winnings and, in some states, play Powerball and Mega Millions on their smartphones. To stay in compliance with lottery laws, Lottery.com has to operate physical offices in every state where its users play tickets. The company aims to work with state lottery commissions and lottery directors, offices of the governor and attorney general, and other relevant legislators before going live.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.benzinga.com/trading-ideas/long-ideas/17/09/10076743/lotteries-go-online-lottery-coms-ceo-talks-about-changing-th|title=Lotteries Go Online {{!}} Benzinga |website=Benzinga |language=en-US|access-date=2017-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently, they’ve expanded their platform to support charitable giving and more global games of chance. Through government lotteries, NGOs, and private charitable giving, they facilitate community renewal. Current partners include [[Akon]], [[Rihanna]]’s Clara Lionel Foundation, and [[United Nations]] Sustainability Global Index Institute.

'''''Bill Cosby Talks to Kids About Drugs''''' (1971) is an album by [[Bill Cosby]]. Unlike most of [[Bill Cosby#Albums|his recordings]], this is not a full-fledged comedy album, but rather a record intended for children to school them on the dangers of [[Recreational drug use|drugs]] through songs and dialogue. It won the [[Grammy Awards of 1972|Grammy Award in 1972]] for [[Grammy Award for Best Album for Children|Best Recording for Children]].

The album was available for some time to download free on [[Andy Baio|Waxy.org]]. Cosby's lawyers eventually had the album download removed via a [[cease and desist]] letter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://wiredblogs.tripod.com/monkeybites/index.blog?entry_id=1426957 | title = Waxy vs. The Cos | accessdate = 2012-03-30 | last = Calore | first = Michael | date = 2006-03-03 | work = Monkey Bites | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060614192431/http://wiredblogs.tripod.com/monkeybites/index.blog?entry_id=1426957 | archivedate = 2006-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blackout was one of a team of two Micromaster Combiners. They came with a [[Flugabwehrkanonenpanzer Gepard|Gepard]] air defense vehicle that could transform to a base. Because Blackout and his partner [[Spaceshot (Transformers)|Spaceshot]] are regularly pictured together and that they are amongst the lesser-known Micromasters, the exact identity of each Transformer is regularly mistaken for the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title=Transformers: The Fantasy, The Fun, The Future| last=Brereton | first=Erin | year=2006 | publisher=Triumph Books| ISBN=1572439831 | page= 12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dreamwave Productions===
Blackout has never appeared in Transformers fiction, except for a profile in [[Dreamwave Productions]]' ''[[Transformers: More Than Meets the Eye]]'' series. His bio painted him as a brave Decepticon warrior, but liable to flee if the odds turned against him. Only Spaceshot's disapproval often keeps this from happening.

Blackout is the Mini-Con partner of Demolishor.

===Animated series===
In the cartoon, Demolishor used him to find other [[Mini-Con]]s.

===Dreamwave Productions===
Blackout appeared among the Mini-Cons in issue #18 of the ''Transformers: Armada'' comic book who aided [[Over-Run]] using the [[Mini-Con Matrix]] in the defeat of Unicron.

Blackout's bio painted him as aggressive and independent—something which contrasts with [[Demolishor]]'s blind loyalty to [[Megatron (Unicron Trilogy)|Megatron]]. He would voice his thoughts and feelings, even at the risk of a severe beating.

===Toys===
*'''''Armada'' Mini-Con Blackout''' (2002)
:Blackout was one of the first-released Mini-Cons that were included with a larger Transformer. Blackout was able to attach to [[Demolishor]] to form the front section of the Decepticon's tank mode, or he was able to sit on the seat on Demolishor's back. When attached to a special Mini-Con port, he can fire Demolishor's shoulder missiles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bwtf.com/armada/toys/reviews/demolishor/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-08-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060516113436/http://www.bwtf.com/armada/toys/reviews/demolishor/ |archivedate=2006-05-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''''Armada'' Mini-Con Powerlinx Blackout'''

*'''''Armada'' Built to Rule Blackout''' (2003–2004)
:Blackout was also part of the [[Built to Rule]] toy line, again as Demolishor's partner, and during 2004, he was recolored with a 'Night Attack' scheme which was not based on an existing Transformers toy.  In the [[Japan]]ese series, Blackout was named '''Search''' and later '''Spark Search''' when he was recolored.

*'''''Energon'' Mini-Con Blackout''' (2004)
:Ten years after the events in ''Armada'', Demolishor retained his original form, only with a new color scheme. Blackout also received a new color scheme to match Demolishor's. However, Blackout did not appear in the ''Energon'' animated series. Blackout did not reappear when the ''Armada'' Demolishor toy was repainted for ''[[Transformers: Cybertron]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seibertron.com/toys/gallery.php?id=308&amp;size=0&amp;start= Blackout - Transformers: Energon - Toy Gallery - Photos 1 - 24&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Blackout was a member of the Decepticon Destruction Team and transformed into a [[helicopter]]. He was able to combine with his team to form a limb of the giant robot, [[Bruticus Maximus]].

===Animated series===
In the ''Energon'' animated series, Blackout was a seemingly non-sentient drone commanded by team leader, [[Barricade (Transformers)|Barricade]]. As with all of the Energon combiner limbs, Blackout has a twin brother on his team—Stormcloud. Their energon weapons were a cannon and a pair of guns. In the Japanese series, each member had the name of a ''Generation 1'' [[Combaticon]]—Blackout's name was [[Blast Off (Transformers)|Blast Off]].

===Dreamwave Productions===
Although the ''Transformers: Energon'' comic book series by Dreamwave Productions was canceled before Blackout could appear in them, the Energon "More Than Meets The Eye" guide book was under development at the time. Pencil art by [[Guido Guidi]] was released later showing the art that would have been used with Blackout's profile.

Early leaked scripts of the 2007 [[Transformers (film)|live-action film]] had a Decepticon helicopter named [[Vortex (Transformers)|Vortex]], after the ''Generation 1'' [[Combaticon]]. Possibly due to Hasbro's lack of a trademark on the name Vortex, they changed the name to Blackout. Blackout has had various names before being finalized—[[Soundwave (Transformers)|Soundwave]], [[Vortex (Transformers)|Vortex]] and Incinerator; all names have been used on a Transformers toy at some point before. Leaked concept art for the character had the name "Incinerator" on it.
[[File:Airmen at filming of Transformers at Holloman AFB 2006-05-30.jpg|thumb|left|Blackout in the 2007 movie]]
[[image:Blackout-soundwave.jpg|left|thumb|Early Blackout design]]
Blackout transforms into an [[MH-53 Pave Low|Sikorsky MH-53 Pave Low]] helicopter. According to screenwriters [[Roberto Orci]] and [[Alex Kurtzman]], Blackout is the largest Decepticon. Blackout is armed with rotary machine guns and energon wave cannons. He is also able to detach and wield his tail rotor blades as a close-combat weapon. According to the book ''Transformers: The Movie Universe'', Blackout's rotor weapon can spin at 6,000 rpm and is reinforced with toughened cobalt. When out of vehicle mode his main rotors fold into two sets of three onto his back, giving him the appearance of having wings. When in helicopter mode he can simulate the appearance of a human pilot, the same holographic model (referred to as "Mustache Man" on-set and in the credits) that "pilots" [[Starscream (Transformers)|Starscream]] and "drives" [[Barricade (Transformers)#2007 Transformers film|Barricade]]. Blackout can carry [[Scorponok#Transformers|Scorponok]] on his back, as seen in both the film and the game.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hasbro.com/transformers/default.cfm?page=Entertainment/Bios&amp;transformer=Blackout transformers-fr_FR - default&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070922075445/http://www.hasbro.com/transformers/default.cfm?page=Entertainment%2FBios&amp;transformer=Blackout |date=September 22, 2007  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to his profile in the second issue of the U.K. Transformers magazine, Blackout stands 33 feet 5&amp;nbsp;inches tall, weighs 2.9 tons and has a maximum speed of 800&amp;nbsp;mph. The official guide to the Transformers video game says he's 33 feet tall. Both of these heights are much smaller than his alternate mode would suggest, and seem to contradict what Roberto Orci and Alex Kurtzman said about his size. However, in the video game's profile for him, it states that he is often seen "silently looming over Megatron's shoulder" indicating that he would have to be taller than Megatron, and therefore taller than 33 feet. His exact height seems to be a mystery. As size calculations from the Voyager class toy suggests, his height should be about 55 feet tall. Oddly the book ''Ghosts of Yesterday'' described him as being smaller than Optimus Prime, who is officially described as 28 feet tall.

===Books===
Blackout appeared in the prequel novel, ''[[Transformers: Ghosts of Yesterday]]'', where he was the most vocal critic of [[Starscream (Transformers)|Starscream]]'s leadership. When Starscream left to destroy [[Bumblebee (Transformers)|Bumblebee]], Blackout seized the initiative and led [[Bonecrusher (Transformers)|Bonecrusher]], Scorponok and [[Frenzy (Transformers)|Frenzy]] in an assault on the Autobots, attacking Prime. He failed, and eventually challenged Starscream to a duel for leadership of the Decepticons, which he lost.

The book ''Transformers - Meet The Decepticons'' by [[Jennifer Frantz]] had a slightly different ending than the movie. This book had all six Decepticons leaving Earth together after being defeated by the Autobots, instead of having most of their numbers die.

The back cover to children's book "Transformers Prime Time" by [[Michael Teitelbaum]] called Blackout by his earlier name Vortex on the back cover, but used Blackout in the book.

===Comics===

====IDW Publishing====
Blackout appeared in ''[[Transformers: Defiance]]'' by [[IDW Publishing]]. In issue #2 he sided with Megatron in his decision to counter-attack Cybertron's invaders and was among the fleet that attacked their ships.

Blackout also appeared in [[IDW Publishing]]'s ''[[Transformers: Movie Prequel|movie prequel comic]]'', where he, Starscream and [[Barricade (Transformers)#2007 Transformers film|Barricade]] smashed up the [[Mars]] [[Beagle 2]] probe. In issue 4, he traveled to Earth, where he gained his MH-53 helicopter mode in [[Afghanistan]] and destroyed the scanned vehicle. The three Decepticons, detecting emissions similar to that of the [[Spark (Transformers)#2007 Transformers film|Allspark]], then stumbled onto Sector 7's trap for [[Bumblebee (Transformers)#2007 Transformers film|Bumblebee]], wiping out their military backup. Blackout tried to access Sector 7's computers, but could only glean a few bits of information before they shut it down. After Barricade outlined his plan to follow Bumblebee and see what they could find out, Blackout and Starscream tailed him from the air.

In ''[[Transformers: Alliance]]'' #2 the bodies of Brawl, Blackout and Megatron are seen being loaded onto trucks at the Nevada desert for disposal in the ocean.

====Titan Magazines====
Information in ''italics'' occur in the alternate storyline where Megatron won the battle for the Allspark.

Blackout appeared in issue #7 if the Transformers Titan Magazine in a story called "Starscream's Militia". He was seemingly brought to life by Starscream using the sparks of Allspark mutations. He was immediately killed again by the Autobots.

''Blackout appears in issue #22 of the Titan Transformers Magazine series in a story called "The Decepticon who Haunted Himself."''

''Blackout and Scorponok were killed by Stockade for rejecting his offer to defect to Stockade's side.''

===Films===
In the 2007 [[Transformers (film)|live-action film]], Blackout is the first active [[Decepticon]] (and first Transformer) to be seen. Blackout serves as the right hand of Megatron in the movie. He is Third-in-Command after Megatron and Starscream. Early in the film, he, along with his [[henchman|minion]] [[Scorponok#Transformers|Scorponok]], attacks the [[SOCCENT]] Forward Operations Center in [[Qatar]], disguised as a [[Sikorsky MH-53|MH-53M Pave Low IV]] helicopter, tail number 4500X, that was apparently shot down over [[Afghanistan]] three months earlier. Blackout is escorted to the base by two [[Lockheed Martin F-22 Raptor|F-22 Raptor]]s, where he transforms and single-handedly destroys the whole base. During his attack, he attempts to hack into the base's system to download data on the location of the [[Allspark#2007 Transformers movie|Allspark]] and [[Megatron (Transformers)#Transformers|Megatron]], only to have the hardline to the system cut off by a military officer. He then deploys Scorponok and send him to after a fleeing Captain William Lennox and his team. Later, Blackout is seen rallying with the other Decepticons to [[Starscream]]'s call, after [[Frenzy (Transformers)#2007 Transformers movie|Frenzy]] discovers the Allspark in the [[Hoover Dam]], saying "All hail Megatron" as if to remind Starscream who his master is. Arriving in Mission City during the final battle, Blackout attacks Sam, who is saved by the timely intervention of [[Ironhide]], who throws a car at Blackout, which the Decepticon blasts out of the way and then he shoots down Ironhide. Later he attempts to kill Sam with his rotor weapon, but misses him by a few feet. Towards the end of the battle he attempts to help Megatron finish off [[Optimus Prime (other incarnations)#2007 Transformers film|Optimus Prime]]; however, he is attacked by Captain Lennox and his team, the former racing underneath him on a motorcycle and firing at him with a sabot round, along with human pilots in F-22 Raptors firing a barrage of missiles from the air, eventually killing him. (The events of "Starscream's Militia" and ''Alliance'' issue #2 occur next.) His corpse is disposed of in the [[Laurentian Abyss]], along with Megatron and the other [[Bonecrusher (Transformers)|fallen]] [[Brawl (Transformers)|Decepticons]].
In ''Revenge of the Fallen'' a similar looking Decepticon named '''Grindor''' appears assisting Megatron and the Doctor in taking the All Spark fragment from Sam. Grindor is later killed by Optimus Prime during an attempt to rescue Sam.

===Games===
In ''Transformers: The Game'', Blackout appears as a playable character in the Decepticon campaign. He stands very tall over the other Transformers and is very powerful. In the Autobot campaign, he appeared in Jazz's battle with Starscream but was killed. Starscream betrays Blackout and flies away. In the Decepticon campaign, Blackout is used in many missions, including the First Mission and Fourth Mission. He also killed Ironhide. During  Megatron's battle with Optimus Prime, Blackout attempted to assist his master by charging Prime. Prime punched the massive Decepticon, sending him flying. He was knocked out by Optimus Prime but was not killed. After that, Blackout went back to the new Decepticon base with other Decepticons to destroy the planet and execute the Autobots and humans. It should also be noted that it can be argued that Blackout is the best playable Transformer in the game, being able to kill almost every drone type in one melee strike, and can kill many at a time in multiple directions. Also, his heavy ranged weapon can get through the red drone's shield, making him the only playable Transformer who can do that, and the strike actually deals considerable damage on a foe, unlike with most of the other playable characters.

===Toys===
All toys of this character are officially licensed from [[Sikorsky Aircraft]].

*'''''Transformers'' Voyager Blackout''' (2007)
:Features a spinning set of blades, whose mount can be removed to form a spinning-blade weapon for the robot mode. It also includes a small, non-transforming [[Scorponok]] figure with a spring-tail that can be dropped from a basket in Blackout's helicopter mode. In vehicle mode, Blackout can combine with the Deluxe Class movie Scorponok figure (sold separately) in a combined gimmick: rotating Blackout's rotors will cause Scorponok's claws to spin. Blackout lacks the arm-mounted weapons seen in the film, but his robot mode does have sculpted missiles detailed on its shoulders. It is the smallest Voyager-class sized figure, despite his actual size in the movie being larger than the others. The figure has features based on a concept art image rather than the actual character from the movie.
:This toy's fuselage is 25 centimeters long, while an actual Pavelow helicopter is 2235 centimeters long. This gives it a scale of about 1/89. With a robot toy height of 19 centimeters, Blackout should stand about 55 feet tall.
:This toy was later remolded into the Autobot [[Evac (Transformers)|Evac]].

Animated Blackout is a character who appeared in season 3 of the ''[[Transformers Animated]]'' series. He is a homage to the 2007 movie version of the character and incorporates the insect-like style of the movie Decepticons into his robot mode.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.transformersanimated.com/news/7777/First+images+of+Animated+Rodimus%2C+Strika%2C+Blackout+and+spittor Transformers Animated - First Images of Animated Rodimus, Strika, Blackout and Spittor]&lt;/ref&gt;

Blackout is a living legend who has destroyed [[Omega Supreme#Transformers Animated|Omega Sentinels]]. He is also the largest Decepticon ever seen. He can emit shockwaves from his feet that can shut down (and reactivate) machinery.

===Animated series===
He was seen in the season three episode "Transwarped" where he is a member of [[Strika (Transformers)|Strika]]'s Team [[Chaar]]. He was shown to be powerful, but also somewhat dimwitted as unintentionally shut down the Space Bridge his group took for a few seconds.

===Fun Publications===
Blackout's biography was printed in issue #24 of the ''Transformers Collectors Club'' magazine.

In the "aligned" universe, Blackout was a battle-hardened gladiator who joined Megatron's Decepticons in the war against the Autobots. His loyalty to Megatron and defiance of Starscream mirror his live-action film incarnation.

===Books===
Blackout appears in the novel ''Transformers: Exodus''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|isbn=978-0345522528 |title=Transformers: Exodus - The Official History of the War for Cybertron |publisher=Del Rey Books |year=2010 |author=Alexander C. Irvine}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blackout was from the Badlands and fought in the pits of Kaon. His body was riddled with scars. He accompanied Megatron to steal the Plasma Energy Chamber from Teletraan-1 and witnessed his battle with Sentinel Prime. When Sentinel Prime fell, exposing the Code Key of Justice within his chest, Starscream attempted to take the Key for himself but Blackout tried to stop him, taking a blow that would've killed any other Transformer but one that only managed to fell him.
 
After Megatron subdued Starscream, Megatron asked for Blackout's name and told him he had a great future. He asked him to take Sentinel's body back to Kaon. He was presumably successful for Optimus Prime later found Sentinel chained to a pillar in the Underworld, having suffered burns from Omega Supreme's takeoff and subjected to even more torture.

'''Brazilian Wrestling Federation (BWF)''' is a Brazilian [[professional wrestling]] association, the largest in the country. The federation holds one internet show, the BWF [[Telecatch]]. The company was founded with the mission to revive the popularity of [[Pro Wrestling]] and [[Telecatch]] in Brazil.

==History==

The BWF was founded in 2002 by Bob Junior. The first televised match was in 2009 and concerts were also broadcast via the official site and [[YouTube]] channel.

The company was the first to support a wrestler to compete outside the country. The wrestler Bia fought under the name Bianca in a match at [[Combat Zone Wrestling]] (CZW) in 2003 alongside Sabian, fighting Joker and Mercedez Martinez.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://telecatchbrazil.com/v4/?page_id=6434%7ct%C3%ADtulo=Brazilian%20Wrestling%20Federation|title=* BWF - TelecatchBrazil.com |work=Telecatchbrazil.com|accessdate=2015-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, BWF became a stage of the “Torneio Sul-Americano de Luta Livre” and in its first year brought wrestlers like Super Crazy and Zumbi to Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cultura.estadao.com.br/blogs/radar-cultural/campeonato-sul-americano-de-luta-livre-chama-a-atencao-de-visitantes/|title=Campeonato de Luta Livre chama a atenção de visitantes|work=Estadao.com.br|accessdate=2015-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, BWF has been more visible in the media. The company announced the participation of [[KENTA]], [[Eddie Edwards (wrestler)|Eddie Edwards]], [[Naomichi Marufuji]], [[Taiji Ishimori]] and other international wrestlers for the "Torneio Latino Americano de Luta Livre".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://superluchas.com/2013/02/13/bwf-torneo-latinoamericano-de-lucha-libre-resultados-13-febrero-2013-naomichi-marufuji-vence-a-eddie-edwards/|title=BWF "Torneo Latinoamericano de Lucha Libre" Resultados (13 Febrero 2013) Naomichi Marufuji vence a Eddie Edwards|author=Randall Gordon|work=Superluchas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 27, 2014 BWF debuted a special event called "Convocado Para Lutar" that was attended by [[William Regal]] and Director of Development [[Canyon Ceman]] as part of the assessment of BWF wrestlers for a tryout in [[WWE]].

BWF was present at an [[anime]] convention in 2014 and announced the debut of BWF Rookies, a group of young talents who will form the "new wrestlers" division.

In 2015, a new tournament called "Backyard Arena" was presented, and bring some Brazilian independent wrestlers to fight for a BWF contract. The winner of tournament was Death Rider. 

In 2015 [[Cezar Bononi]], which competed under the ring name of '''V8 Big Block''' and held the ''BWF Rei Do Ringue Championship'' once, was recruited into the [[WWE NXT]] and debuting in 2017 against [[Aleister Black]].

==Etymology==

"Chak" ({{lang-th|ชัก}}) means "to pull"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thai-language.com/id/133180 ชัก chak ''thai-language.com'']&lt;/ref&gt; and "Phra" ({{lang-th|พระ}}) can refer to a monk, god, or Buddha image.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thai-language.com/id/131839 พระ phra ''thai-language.com'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Story==

{{Quote
|text=The Buddha’s mother, [[Maya (mother of the Buddha)|Maya]], had died seven days after the Buddha-to-be was born. As she had no access to   the Buddha’s teachings, he went up to [[Trāyastriṃśa|Tavatimsa heaven]], where she had been reborn, in order to give her the benefit of hearing the [[Dharma|Dharmma]]. Upon his return to earth, the Buddha descended upon a ladder of crystal accompanied by two Hindu gods who acted as his witnesses and acolytes: [[Brahma]] on a ladder of gold at right and [[Indra]] on a ladder of silver at left.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Stratton |first=Carol |title= Buddhist Sculpture of Northern Thailand |publisher=Buppha Press |date=2014 |page=43 |chapter=Chapter 3: Sculptural Conventions, Iconography, Style, Sets, Types |chapterurl= https://books.google.co.th/books?id=EVpSSigMi4cC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Charlie's Angels''''' is a [[beat 'em up]] video game developed by [[Neko Entertainment]] and published by [[Ubi Soft]] for the [[PlayStation 2]] and [[GameCube]]. Versions for the [[Xbox]] and [[Game Boy Advance]] were also planned, but they were later cancelled.

''Charlie's Angels'' is based on the [[Charlie's Angels (2000 film)|first]] and [[Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle|second film]] in the series. It follows the continuing adventures of private investigators Alex Munday ([[Lucy Liu]]), Dylan Sanders ([[Drew Barrymore]]) and Natalie Cook ([[Cameron Diaz]]) as they attempt to solve the mystery of a series of missing national monuments. The heroines do not use firearms but can utilize blunt weapons and certain environmental objects.

The game is notable for being panned by critics and has been regarded as one of the [[List of video games notable for negative reception|worst video games ever made]].

==Gameplay==
The gameplay is very simple and involves fighting groups of enemies by performing punching and kicking combinations or by using weapons. Each group of enemies must be defeated before the player is allowed to progress through the game. While the player is engaged in a fight, movement to another area is impossible as invisible walls will block their way. It also featured an option to switch from playing one Angel to another. However, this option is not available during a fight and it is not required to complete the game. Occasionally, one Angel must perform a task such as pressing a switch, pulling a lever or accessing a computer so that another Angel is allowed to progress.

Most levels end when all of the Angels have completed their current objective. Unlockables such as trailers and photographs from the movie ''[[Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle]]'' can be unlocked by collecting items such as film reels and memory sticks, which are hidden in each level.

'''''Crayon Physics Deluxe''''' is a [[puzzle video game]] designed by [[Petri Purho]] and released on January 7, 2009.  An early version, titled '''''Crayon Physics''''', was released as freeware in 2007.  ''Deluxe'' won the grand prize at the [[Independent Games Festival]] in 2008. It features a heavy emphasis on two-dimensional physics [[simulations]], including gravity, mass, kinetic energy and transfer of momentum.  The game includes a [[level editor]] and enables its players to download and [[User generated content|share custom content]] via an online service.

== Gameplay ==
The objective of each level in ''Crayon Physics Deluxe'' is to guide a ball from a predetermined start point so that it touches all of the stars placed on the level.  The ball and nearly all objects on the screen are affected by gravity.  The player cannot control the ball directly, but rather must influence the ball's movement by drawing physical objects on the screen.  Depending on how the object is drawn, it becomes a rigid surface, a pivot point, a wheel or a rope, and the object can then interact with the ball by hitting it, providing a surface to roll on, dragging, carrying or launching the ball, etc.  The player can also nudge the ball left or right by clicking on it, and in some levels, rockets appear and can be used as part of the solution.

The game challenges players to come up with creative solutions to each puzzle, and provides additional rewards for elegant solutions that don't rely on "[[brute force method]]s".  It comes with more than seventy levels, and also features a [[level editor]] and an online Playground, where players can upload and download custom levels.

== Development ==

===''Crayon Physics''===
''Crayon Physics'', the original prototype of this game, is Purho's tenth "rapid-prototype project" inspired by the rules of the [[Experimental Gameplay Project]], and was developed in five days&lt;ref name=slate&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/gaming/2008/03/crayon_physics_deluxe.html |title=Crayon Physics Deluxe |author=Chris Baker |date=March 19, 2008 |website=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |publisher=[[The Slate Group]] |accessdate=March 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; using resources [[Open content|freely available]] under a [[Creative Commons license]].&lt;ref name="kloonigames"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kloonigames.com/blog/games/crayon |title=Crayon Physics |website=[[Kloonigames]] |publisher=Petri Purho |date=June 1, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was inspired by descriptions Purho had heard of the [[children's book]] ''[[Harold and the Purple Crayon]]''.  On June 10, 2007, Purho announced that he would be developing a [[level editor]] to permit [[User generated content|user-created]] levels, although by June 15 fans of the game had already worked out the level format and had released new levels for the game. The level editor was released on June 30. ''Crayon Physics'' was built with [[Simple DirectMedia Layer]] middle-layer and released as [[freeware]].&lt;ref name="kloonigames"/&gt;

===''Crayon Physics Deluxe''===
On October 12, 2007, Purho announced ''Crayon Physics Deluxe'', which would feature an intuitive level editor, more levels, and a modification to the game engine to preserve the player's drawings instead of turning them into rectangles.&lt;ref name=slate/&gt; The follow-up took a year and eight months to develop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=99080116 |title=Computer Game A Mash-Up Of Crayons, Physics |website=[[NPR]] |date=January 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It won the [[Seumas McNally Grand Prize]] at the [[Independent Games Festival]] in February 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://igf.com/02finalists.html |title=2008 Independent Games Festival Winners |website=[[Independent Games Festival]] |publisher=Think Services |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081105182837/http://igf.com/02finalists.html |archivedate=November 5, 2008 |deadurl=yes |accessdate=March 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Chris Baker of ''Slate Magazine'' also wrote that ''Crayon Physics Deluxe'' was more talked about than ''[[Gears of War 2]]'' at the 2008 [[Game Developers Conference]].&lt;ref name=slate/&gt;

[[Microsoft Windows]], [[macOS|Mac OS X]], [[Linux]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] versions of this game were released along with [[Humble Indie Bundle#Humble Bundle for Android 4|Humble Indie Bundle for Android 4]] on November 8, 2012.

'''''Der Spiegel''''' ({{IPA-de|deːɐ̯ ˈʃpiːɡl̩}}, lit. ''"The Mirror"'') is a [[Germany|German]] weekly [[news magazine]] published in [[Hamburg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eurotopics.net/de/148789/der-spiegel|title=Der Spiegel - Magazin|last=|first=|date=|website=Euro Topcis|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; With a weekly circulation of 840,000 copies, it is the largest such publication in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://german.about.com/od/newsnachrichten/a/englSpiegel.htm|title= DER SPIEGEL is Germany's oldest news magazine; founded in 1946 as a German version of America's TIME and NEWSWEEK magazines|accessdate=9 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2004/04/19/spiegel_ed3_.php|title=Scoop on Bundesbank head returns focus to Der Spiegel|accessdate =2 January 2008|author=Kevin J.

Typically, the magazine has a content to advertising ratio of 2:1.

''Der Spiegel'' is known in [[German language|German-speaking]] countries mostly for its [[investigative journalism]]. It has played a key role in uncovering many political scandals such as the [[Spiegel scandal]] in 1962 and the [[Flick affair]] in the 1980s. According to ''[[The Economist]]'', ''Der Spiegel'' is one of [[continental Europe]]'s most influential magazines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Der Spiegel and Germany's press: His country's mirror|url=http://www.economist.com/node/1446317|work=The Economist|accessdate=30 June 2013|quote=Mr Augstein's success in making Der Spiegel one of continental Europe's most influential magazines...|date=16 November 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Image:Spiegel Building Hamburg 1.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Old Spiegel headquarters, [[Hamburg]]]]
[[File:Hamburg.Spiegel.nordwest.abends.wmt.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Spiegel headquarters since 2011, [[Hamburg]]]]
The first edition of ''Der Spiegel'' was published in [[Hanover]] on Saturday, 4 January 1947.&lt;ref name=sixds&gt;{{cite news|title=Six Decades of Quality Journalism: The History of DER SPIEGEL|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/six-decades-of-quality-journalism-the-history-of-der-spiegel-a-789853.html|accessdate=23 March 2015|work=Der Spiegel|date=5 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its release was initiated and sponsored by the British occupational administration and preceded by a magazine titled ''Diese Woche'' (meaning ''This Week'' in English),&lt;ref name=sixds/&gt; which had first been published in November 1946. After disagreements with the British, the magazine was handed over to [[Rudolf Augstein]] as chief editor, and was renamed ''Der Spiegel''. From the first edition in January 1947, Augstein held the position of editor-in-chief, which he retained until his death on 7 November 2002.

After 1950, the magazine was owned by Rudolf Augstein and John Jahr; Jahr's share merged with [[Richard Gruner]] in 1965 to form the publishing company [[Gruner + Jahr]]. In 1969, Augstein bought out Gruner + Jahr for [[Deutsche Mark|DM]] 42&amp;nbsp;million and became the sole owner of ''Der Spiegel''. In 1971, Gruner + Jahr bought back a 25% share in the magazine. In 1974, Augstein restructured the company to make the employees shareholders. All employees with more than three years seniority were offered the opportunity to become an associate and participate in the management of the company, as well as in the profits.

Since 1952, ''Der Spiegel'' has been headquartered in its own building in the old town part of Hamburg.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hydro.com/en/press-room/Archive/2009/Wicona-lands-Spiegel-project-in-Hamburg/|title=Wicona lands Spiegel project in Hamburg|website=www.hydro.com|language=en|access-date=2017-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Der Spiegel''{{'s}} circulation rose quickly. From 15,000 copies in 1947, it grew to 65,000 in 1948 and 437,000 in 1961. It was nearly 500,000 copies in 1962.&lt;ref name=ser&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Frank Esser|author2=Uwe Hartung|title=Nazis, Pollution, and no Sex: Political Scandals as a Reflection of Political Culture in Germany|journal=American Behavioral Scientist|year=2004|volume=47|issue=1040|url=http://abs.sagepub.com/content/47/8/1040|accessdate=4 October 2013|doi=10.1177/0002764203262277|pages=1040–1071}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1970s, it had reached a plateau at about 900,000 copies. When the [[German re-unification]] in 1990 made it available to a new readership in former [[East Germany]], the circulation exceeded one million.

The magazine's influence is based on two pillars; firstly the [[moral authority]] established by investigative journalism since the early years and proven alive by several impressive scoops during the 1980s; secondly the economic power of the prolific ''Spiegel'' publishing house. Since 1988, it has produced the TV programme ''Spiegel TV'', and further diversified during the 1990s.

During the second quarter of 1992 the circulation of ''Der Spiegel'' was 1.1 million copies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Georg Hellack|title=Press, Radio and Television in the Federal Republic of Germany|url=http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED353617.pdf|work=Inter Nationes|accessdate=27 April 2015|location=Bonn|format=Report|date=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, ''[[Spiegel Online]]'' was launched.&lt;ref name=chi5&gt;{{cite journal|author=Christina Schäffner|title=Bringing a German Voice to English-speaking Readers: Spiegel International|journal=Language and Intercultural Communication|year=2005|volume=5|issue=2|pages=154–167|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14708470508668891|accessdate=4 October 2013|doi=10.1080/14708470508668891}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Anne Penketh|author2=Philip Oltermann|author3=Stephen Burgen|title=European newspapers search for ways to survive digital revolution|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2014/jun/12/european-newspapers-digital-revolution|accessdate=7 January 2015|work=The Guardian|date=12 June 2014|location=Paris, Berlin, Barcelona}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has separate and independent editorial staff from ''Der Spiegel''.

''Der Spiegel'' had an average circulation of 1,076,000 copies in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=European Publishing Monitor|url=http://edz.bib.uni-mannheim.de/daten/edz-du/gda/07/med-ind-germany_en.pdf|work=Turku School of Economics (Media Group)|accessdate=27 March 2015|format=Report|date=March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 the magazine started a new regional [[Supplement (publishing)|supplement]] in [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref name=dertag&gt;{{cite news|author=Stephan Russ-Mohl|title=The Lemon Dealers|url=http://en.ejo.ch/339/media_economics/the-lemon-dealers?output=pdf|accessdate=23 December 2014|work=Der Tagesspiegel|date=27 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first regional supplement of the magazine which covers 50-page review of Switzerland.&lt;ref name=dertag/&gt;

In 2010 ''Der Spiegel'' was employing the equivalent of 80 full-time [[fact checker]]s, which the ''[[Columbia Journalism Review]]'' called "most likely the world's largest fact checking operation".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Craig Silverman|url=http://www.cjr.org/behind_the_news/inside_the_worlds_largest_fact.php?page=all|title=Inside the World’s Largest Fact Checking Operation.

==Reception==
When [[Stefan Aust]] took over in 1994, the magazine's readers realised that his personality was different from his predecessor. In 2005, a documentary by Stephan Lamby quoted him as follows: "We stand at a very big cannon!"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ecomediatv.de/live_2010_1/en/produktionen/item/307-stefan-aust-der-chef.html|title="We stand at a very big cannon!"

The outspoken conservative [[Franz Josef Strauß]] contended that ''Der Spiegel'' was "the [[Gestapo]] of our time".

''Der Spiegel'' often produces feature-length articles on problems affecting Germany (like demographic trends, the federal system's gridlock or the issues of its education system) and describes optional strategies and their risks in depth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= http://www.economist.com/node/1446317|title=The best investigative reporting, the widest foreign coverage, the sharpest political analysis, and the most insightful social commentary|accessdate=9 April 2011|work=The Economist|date=14 November 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/der-spiegel-report-hits-vw-shares-1554394.html|title='Der Spiegel' report hits VW shares|accessdate=9 April 2011|location=London|work=[[The Independent]]|author=Sarah Lambert|date=29 September 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-07-10/german-euro-insolvency-plan-comes-with-haircut-spiegel-says.html|title=Holders of sovereign bonds, while taking a so-called haircut, would be guaranteed half the bond’s face value as an incentive to take part in debt restructuring, Spiegel said|accessdate=9 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-12816068|title=Here's how Spiegel puts it: "Germany is witnessing a stunning political about-face".

==Investigative journalism==
''Der Spiegel'' has a distinctive reputation for revealing political misconduct and scandals. Online Encyclopædia Britannica emphasizes this quality of the magazine as follows: "The magazine is renowned for its aggressive, vigorous, and well-written [[Exposé (journalism)|exposés]] of government malpractice and scandals."&lt;ref name=chi5/&gt; It merited recognition for this as early as 1950, when the federal parliament launched an inquiry into ''Spiegel''{{-'}}s accusations that bribed members of parliament had promoted [[Bonn]] over [[Frankfurt]] as the seat of West Germany's government.

During the [[Spiegel scandal]] in 1962, which followed the release of a report about the possibly low state of readiness of the [[Bundeswehr|German armed forces]], minister of defence and conservative figurehead [[Franz Josef Strauß]] had ''Der Spiegel'' investigated. In the course of this investigation, the editorial offices were raided by police while Rudolf Augstein and other ''Der Spiegel'' editors were arrested on charges of treason. Despite a lack of sufficient authority, Strauß even went after the article's author, Conrad Ahlers, who was consequently arrested in Spain where he was on holiday. When the legal case collapsed, the scandal led to a major shake-up in chancellor [[Konrad Adenauer]]'s cabinet and Strauß had to stand down. The affair was generally received as an attack on the freedom of the press. Since then, ''Der Spiegel'' has repeatedly played a significant role in revealing political grievances and misdeeds, including the [[Flick Affair]].&lt;ref name=ser/&gt;

The Spiegel scandal is now remembered for altering the political culture of post-war Germany and—with the first mass demonstrations and public protests—being a turning point from the old Obrigkeitsstaat ([[authoritarian]] state) to a modern [[democracy]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

In 2010, the magazine supported [[WikiLeaks]] in publishing [[United States diplomatic cables leak|leaked materials from the United States State Department]], along with ''[[The Guardian]]'', ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[El País]]'', and ''[[Le Monde]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/international/world/0,1518,731441,00.html WikiLeaks FAQ: What Do the Diplomatic Cables Really Tell Us?] ''Der Spiegel'', 28 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and in October 2013 with the help of former [[NSA]] contractor [[Edward Snowden]] unveiled the systematic wiretapping of [[Chancellor of Germany]] [[Angela Merkel]]'s private cell phone over a period of over 10 years at the hands of the [[National Security Agency]]'s [[Special Collection Service]] (SCS).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/cover-story-how-nsa-spied-on-merkel-cell-phone-from-berlin-embassy-a-930205.html  Embassy Espionage: The NSA's Secret Spy Hub in Berlin] ''Der Spiegel'', 27 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The leading role of the magazine in investigative journalism and its monopoly came to end in 2013 since other German media outlets, including ''[[Süddeutsche Zeitung]]'', ''[[Bild]]'', [[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD]] and [[ZDF]], began to effectively deal with [[political scandals]].&lt;ref name=nyt29/&gt;

===Criticism===
{{Refimprove section|date=October 2012}}
One of the main criticism of ''Der Spiegel'' concerns its use of language. In 1957, writer [[Hans Magnus Enzensberger]] published his essay ''Die Sprache des Spiegels'' (“The Language of Der Spiegel”), in which he criticised what he called a "pretended objectivity". Wolf Schneider, an eminent journalist and stylist has called ''Der Spiegel'' "the biggest mangler of the German language" and used quotations from the magazine as examples of inept German in his style guides. Their criticism was not so much one of linguistic [[aesthetics]] as an argument that ''Der Spiegel'' "hides and distorts its actual topics and issues by manipulative semantics and rhetoric rather than by reporting and analysing them". In 1957, however, Enzensberger admitted in a written statement that no other contemporary German magazine attained the ''Spiegel''{{-'}}s level of objectivity.

Opinions about the level of language employed by ''Der Spiegel'' changed in the late 1990s. After hiring many of Germany's best feature writers, ''Der Spiegel'' has become known for its "Edelfedern" ("noble quills"—wordsmiths). The magazine frequently wins the [[Egon Erwin Kisch Prize]] for the best German feature. ''Der Spiegel'' ended up joining the ranks of the guardians of proper grammar and jargon with the ''Zwiebelfisch'' ("(printer's) pie") column on the magazine's website, which has even produced several best-selling books.

Some critics, in particular the media historian [[Lutz Hachmeister]] and the Augstein biographer and former ''Der Spiegel'' author Otto Köhler, have brought charges against the magazine's dealings with former Nazis, even [[SS]] officers. Allegedly, ''Der Spiegel'', which at other times showed no restraint when exposing the Nazi past of public figures, distorted history and covered up for criminals after enlisting insiders hired to write about [[Third Reich]] topics.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} Its early reports and serials about the [[Reichstag fire]], written by former SS officers [[Paul Carell]] (who had also served as chief press spokesman for Nazi Germany's Foreign Minister [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]]) and [[Fritz Tobias]], have since been considered influential in historiography because since the 1960s the ''Spiegel'' reports written by these two authors have been corroborated by authoritative historian [[Hans Mommsen]].

==Bans==
A special 25 March 2008 edition of ''Der Spiegel'' on [[Islam]] was banned in [[Egypt]] in April 2008 for publishing material deemed by authorities to be  insulting Islam and the [[Prophet Muhammed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Der Spiegel issue on Islam banned in Egypt|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20080402-der-spiegel-issue-islam-banned-egypt-egypt-germany|accessdate=29 September 2013|work=France24|date=2 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Leading German Magazine Banned in Egypt|url=http://www.arabpressnetwork.org/articlesv2.php?id=2081|publisher=The Arab Press Network|accessdate=9 September 2014|date=3 April 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140910200135/http://www.arabpressnetwork.org/articlesv2.php?id=2081|archivedate=10 September 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Head office==
''Der Spiegel'' began moving into its current head office in [[HafenCity]] in September 2011. The facility was designed by [[Henning Larsen Architects]] of [[Denmark]]. The magazine was previously located in a high-rise building with {{convert|8226|sqm|sqft}} of office space.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.spiegel.de/international/hafencity-headquarters-spiegel-moves-to-a-new-home-a-789735.html HafenCity Headquarters: SPIEGEL Moves to a New Home]" ([https://www.webcitation.org/6aNcs5n6d?url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/hafencity-headquarters-spiegel-moves-to-a-new-home-a-789735.html Archive]).

'''''Diànzǐ Yóuxì Ruǎnjiàn''''' ({{CJKV|s=电子游戏软件|l=Electronic Game Software}}; also known by the [[Portmanteau#Chinese|portmanteau abbreviation]] '''''Diàn Ruǎn''''' (电软; lit. "Electro Soft")) is China's earliest [[video game magazine]].&lt;ref name=cqvip&gt;Staff. "[http://lib.cqvip.com/qk/80675X/ 电子游戏软件 - 期刊简介]." 中文科技期刊数据库 (Chinese Scientific Journals Database at CQVIP.com). Retrieved 10 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Founded in the summer of 1993 and officially serialized in May 1994 by [[China Association for Science and Technology]] (中国科学技术协会; Zhōngguó Kēxué Jìshù Xiéhuì), the magazine was originally subtitled '''''Game Jízhōngyíng''''' (GAME集中营; lit. "Game Concentration Camp"), and focused on both [[PC game]]s and [[console game]]s.&lt;ref name=sinagames120307/&gt; In July 1995 it was closed by the government, however the publication ban was lifted two months later and the magazine was given the more politically palatable subtitle '''''Game Fēngjǐngxiàn''''' (GAME风景线; lit. "Game Landscape"). Topical coverage broadened after this point to include articles on anime, comics, music, and popular culture in general, however the de-emphasis on video games created a rift among staff and several editors led by Bīng Suǒ (索冰; better known under the pseudonym "King") left the magazine to found ''[[Diànzǐ Yóuxì yǔ Diànnǎo Yóuxì]]'' (电子游戏与电脑游戏; lit. "Electronic Games and Computer Games"; known by the portmanteau abbreviation ''Diàn Diàn'' (电电; lit. "Electro Comp")), a rival magazine catering to a [[Hardcore gamers|hardcore]] and [[doujin game]]r ethic.&lt;ref name=witness&gt;Staff.

From 1995 to 2000, ''Diàn Ruǎn'' and ''Diàn Diàn'' dominated video game magazine sales in the country and the competition between them was stiff and occasionally acrimonious. The early 2000s saw the introduction of prominent rivals, and the development of specialist gaming magazines like the PC-focused ''[[Play (PRC magazine)|Play]]''.&lt;ref name=sinagames120307/&gt; From 2003 (the year that marked the [[Bankruptcy in China|folding]] of ''Diàn Diàn'') through 2005, ''Diàn Ruǎn'' experienced the peak of its influence with annual income approaching 16.5 million [[Chinese yuan|yuan]].&lt;ref name=yang&gt;杨文志, 王晓彬, 张利军, and 李芳.

On June 13, 2010, a large number of staff simultaneously resigned and the magazine was described by ''Gameaning'' journalists as "hanging by a thread".&lt;ref name=gameaning&gt;Staff. "[https://web.archive.org/web/20100617210525/http://www.gameaning.com/news/news/2010/0613/2569.html 独家：杂志主编风林等集体辞职，老牌刊物《电软》命悬一线]."

Seven months later, in September 2012, the magazine re-opened with a different format and with an academic rather than entertainment focus on video games. This new iteration of the magazine was short-lived and two months later (in November 2012) the magazine was renamed '''''Diànzǐ Jìshù yǔ Ruǎnjiàn Gōngchéng''''' (电子技术与软件工程; lit. "Electronic Technology and Software Engineering"), and its emphasis was shifted to non-game electronic hardware.&lt;ref name=sinagames120911/&gt;&lt;ref name=cqvip/&gt;

== Historical timeline ==

* Summer 1993 - ''Diànzǐ Yóuxì Ruǎnjiàn "Game Jízhōngyíng"'' is founded by Chūn Xiǎo (晓春), Wényǔ Liú (刘文雨; using the pseudonym "Xūnfēng" (熏风)), Sōng Tián (田松), Lóng Qiūzhào (邱兆龙; pseudonym "Lóng Gē" (龙哥)), and Rúdé Liú (刘儒德; pseudonym "Lǎo d" (老d)). Xiǎo takes the position of general manager and the others act as journalists and editors. The magazine begins life as a series of "books" recognized with unique [[ISBN]] identifiers (e.g. the first two issues in 1993 use {{Listed Invalid ISBN|7-4303-1472-0}}/T.294 (issue #1) and {{Listed Invalid ISBN|7-80036-X}}/G.23 (issue #2)).&lt;ref name="sinagames120307" /&gt;
* 25 May 1994 - The magazine gains approval for an official nationally recognized serialization number ([[CN-11]]-3505/TP) and restarts its numbering at #1.&lt;ref name="sinagames120307" /&gt;
* 14 December 1994 - The magazine gains international recognition with an [[ISSN]] number ({{ISSN|1006-5032}}).&lt;ref name="sinagames120307" /&gt;
* July 1995 - Authorities halt the publication of "Game Jízhōngyíng" citing 15 publication infractions including the use of a repugnant publishing title, the use of anonymous pseudonyms for all staff, and the misuse of their "Diàn ruǎn shèpíng" (电软社评; lit. "Electro Soft Editorial") column. This column contained politically sensitive issues like criticism of the government policies on games and frank discussion of the then-rampant [[software piracy]].&lt;ref name="witness" /&gt;
* September 1995 - Under the efforts of founding member, Wényǔ Liú, the publication ban is lifted.&lt;ref name="sinagames120307" /&gt;
* October 1995 - Publication resumes under the title "Game Fēngjǐngxiàn" and the editor in chief, now Wényǔ Liú, discards his old pseudonym to publish under his real name.&lt;ref name="sinagames120307" /&gt;
* Late 1995 - The first ''Diàn Ruǎn'' supplemental publications are published. The first, "Diàn Ruǎn 94 Diǎncáng Běn" (电软94典藏本; lit. "Electric Soft Collection '94") had been created by editor Bīng Suǒ (索冰; better known under the pseudonym "King") during the suspension period. This is followed by the "Mìjì Bǎodiǎn" (秘技宝典; lit. "Cheats Collection") supplement.
* Spring 1996 - Artistic differences between staff members come to a head with the original founders tending to favor expansive coverage of related popular topics like anime, comics, music, etc. using strict controls (e.g. limiting articles to 2 pages, etc.), and newer staffers led by Bīng Suǒ (AKA "King") adopting a philosophy more in tune with the hardcore doujin gamer ethic. King leaves with 3 others to found ''Diànzǐ Yóuxì yǔ Diànnǎo Yóuxì'' (电子游戏与电脑游戏; lit. "Electronic Games and Computer Games"). Hard feelings between the two papers lead them to publish scathing critiques of each other.&lt;ref name="witness" /&gt;
* 1997–1999 - Competition with ''Diàn Diàn'' persists. ''Diàn Ruǎn'' releases spin-off series including the popular "Gédòu Tiānshū" (格斗天书; lit. "Fighting Bible") series and the "Yóuxì Pīpíng" (游戏批评; lit. "Game Criticism") supplemental series to boost revenues.&lt;ref name="sinagames120307" /&gt;
* 2003–2005 - ''Diàn Diàn'' folds and ''Diàn Ruǎn'' experiences the peak of its influence with annual income of approaching 16.48 million [[Chinese yuan|yuan]].&lt;ref name="yang" /&gt;
* 13 June 2010 - Large number of staff resign simultaneously. ''Diàn Ruǎn'' described as "hanging by a thread".&lt;ref name="gameaning" /&gt;
* 27 February 2012 - ''Diàn Ruǎn'' folds. Issue #319 is its final publication.&lt;ref name="gamelook" /&gt;&lt;ref name="netease" /&gt;
* 10 September 2012 - ''Diàn Ruǎn'' reopens with an academic focus on video games.&lt;ref name="sinagames120911" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cqvip" /&gt;
* November 2012 - The magazine is renamed ''Diànzǐ Jìshù yǔ Ruǎnjiàn Gōngchéng'' (电子技术与软件工程; lit. "Electronic Technology and Software Engineering") and covers non-game electronic hardware.&lt;ref name="sinagames120911" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cqvip" /&gt;

'''''Earthrise''''' is a [[science fiction]] [[player vs player]] [[massively multiplayer online role-playing game]] (MMORPG) by independent [[Bulgaria]]n developer [[Masthead Studios]] released on February 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Earthrise |url=http://uk.gamespot.com/pc/rpg/earthrisemmo/index.html?tag=result%3Btitle%3B0 |accessdate=2011-01-26 |publisher=[[GameSpot]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5wCfZ3I7t?url=http://uk.gamespot.com/pc/rpg/earthrisemmo/index.html?tag=result%3Btitle%3B0 |archivedate=2011-02-02 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game takes place in a [[post-apocalyptic]] setting where the surviving population of the Earth has built a new society ruled by a totalitarian government while armed factions fight for resources and power within the new system. Among other features, a few of note are a skill-based advancement system, a player-driven economy and an emphasis on free [[Player versus player|PvP]].&lt;ref name="gamespot_firstlook"&gt;{{cite web |title=Masthead spots Earthrise |url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/rpg/earthrisemmo/news.html?sid=6185039&amp;mode=recent |author=Tom Magrino |date=2008-01-23 |accessdate=2008-03-27 |publisher=GameSpot |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5wCfZvMvp?url=http://www.gamespot.com/pc/rpg/earthrisemmo/news.html?sid=6185039&amp;mode=recent |archivedate=2011-02-02 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The game uses the Earthrise Engine, an engine that was to be used for the cancelled [[Fallout Online]].

Citing that the game was released "too early" and that it "did not meet the expectations of its fans", Masthead Studios shut down the Earthrise servers on February 9, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forum.play-earthrise.com/index.php?/topic/2527-earthrise-shuts-down-its-servers/|title=Earthrise shuts down its servers|last=Atanasov|first=Atanas|publisher=Masthead Studios|accessdate=10 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;   A press release was sent to many of the gaming sites along with a post on the official forums giving additional details.   The announcement also mentioned that the previously planned conversion to a free-to-play model&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forum.play-earthrise.com/index.php?/topic/2470-earthrise-becomes-free-to-all-its-customers/|title=EARTHRISE BECOMES FREE TO ALL ITS CUSTOMERS (Free-to-play model will come in effect in 2012)|last=Atanasov|first=Atanas|publisher=Masthead Studios|accessdate=10 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; is now dependent on future investor and/or publisher interest.

== Gameplay ==

=== Character progression ===
The character progression in Earthrise is conducted entirely online.

=== Skill System ===
The number 100 indicates total skills, abilities and tactics available at launch. While many of them are combat oriented, a sizable amount will cover crafting and social aspects for each character. The three types of game elements – skills, abilities and tactics, are closely related to each other and will allow for numerous possibilities for customization of the character. Tactics are the key to customization – these meta-enhancements will be compatible with wide variety of abilities and will change their effects to suit player’s style of play. Players with similar skills may have a completely different style of fighting thanks to enhancing them with tactics.

=== Combat ===

The outcome of battle in Earthrise will rely more on the traditional RPG system, where avatar skills and equipment are important. However the combat will be more dynamic, resembling a third person shooter. The game will require a certain level of player skill in movement and targeting that is becoming increasingly popular trend in current wave of MMOs. Still, not every action will have the same requirements. Some actions will require proper targeting of the opponent, while others will require only having it in sight and then there will be actions that can be executed even if the player doesn’t have its target in sight but within range.

=== PvP ===

[[File:Earthrise combat gameplay.JPG|thumb|left|Close combat vs ranged weapons, introduced by ''Earthrise''{{'}}s gameplay video]]
Players will have the opportunity to kill other players (including from his faction) – but not without consequences. Killing people of the same faction is one of the worst crimes, prosecuted by members of both Noir and Continoma. It will be very difficult for someone to clear the damning effects of such a crime, though not impossible, and his space of operation would be greatly limited in the wild, less secure areas - where he himself would taste his own medicine by being open target for other criminals.
Each player's criminal actions, once reported through the Continoma SVS Network will affect the behavior of every guard the player encounters. There will be cases when despite guard activity, the actions do not get reported island-wide. For the most prosecuted player killers that means that their life in a sizable portion of the game world will be constant game of cat and mouse, and other players will certainly benefit from joining in as there will be rewards to take a criminal down. Stealth abilities will be almost a requirement for survival. We won't force that sort of gameplay on players and it would be easy to get on good terms with the government. Player who has killed another player opponent would be able to loot his possessions. There will be available equipment protection, but its viability will vary based on character's affiliation and actions in the game. Characters who play "against the system" should learn to protect their gear well. There will be some high security areas in Earthrise, where guards will attack on sight everyone else who tries to attack another player. People, who don’t want to engage in PvP will feel secure in these zones. At the same time, the most dangerous parts of the island will feature free for all PvP.&lt;br /&gt;
Another PvP aspect in Earthrise will be guild rivalries. Guilds will be able to declare war on each other and fight for power and resources. Such wars will be prohibited in the security zones, but will not be punished in the other territories. Guilds will be able to conquer their own part of the island, gaining access to resources and a territory where they can impose their rules. There will also be arenas and other types of PvP competitions with rewards. People who do not want to engage in PvP will not feel alienated in Earthrise. There will be certain areas in the game, where PvE skills will be more important than PvP. Quests, crafting and trade are other examples of the non-PvP gameplay in Earthrise.

=== Crafting ===

Crafting in Earthrise is a complex process that is easy to understand but ultimately difficult to master. The basic rule of crafting is that every item is made of components and every item can be broken down to its composites. Some components are used for specific items, others are used in a wide array of items – for example, a hand gun grip can be used in the creation of various hand guns, while electronic chipsets can be used to create specific devices. Players often will break down items to their components in order to combine some of them with other components to produce new, different items. Crafting and salvaging requires specific skills, depending what item is created or salvaged down, and players will have access to dozens of skills, covering mechanics, electronics, engineering, construction and programming in several futuristic industries.

Transformation of one type of item to another - either through crafting or salvaging - has damaging effect on the used resources and the final item will always have lowered quality value compared to the input components, depending on player's crafting skill. This renders impossible the infinite transformation of items - even for a true expert, constant crafting and salvaging of the same item will make the resources useless and any item made of them prone to quick damage and lessened effect. This is when items will "break" completely - when they cannot be any more repaired, or effectively salvaged to craft a new useful item.

==Critical reception==
MMORPG.com rated the game 5.5/10 and wrote that the game was bland and uninspired, lacking a true sandbox environment and offering "little more than grinding combat and crafting" while also noting that the game suffered from performance issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Earthrise review |url=http://www.mmorpg.com/gamelist.cfm/game/331/view/reviews/loadReview/134 |accessdate=2011-03-25 |publisher=MMORPG.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[GameFront]] rated the game 65/100, praising the game's art direction but stated that the game offered slow progression and lacked a sizable playerbase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Earthrise Review|url=http://www.gamefront.com/earthrise-review-impressions-part-1/|first=CJ|last=Miozzi|date=2011-02-06|publisher=[[GameFront]]|accessdate=2011-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Franck Biyong''' (born 3 December 1973) is a [[Cameroon]]ian musician, bandleader and record producer. He plays the electric guitar, bass as well as percussion and keyboards. After a string of AfroJazz albums,&lt;ref name=Thom&gt;{{cite web|title=Artist Biography by Thom Jurek|url=http://www.allmusic.com/artist/franck-biyong-mn0000210961/biography|website=AllMusic|accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Franck is breaking new ground with a genre called "Alternative Afro-Electro-Rock" or "Afrolectric Music" that fuses [[Rock music|Rock]], [[Electronica]] and African-flavoured beats. His music leans towards the new sound of [[Psychedelic soul|Black Rock]] and Biyong is notable&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ethnocloud|first1=Ethnocloud|title=Liyomba: Time to Dance|url=http://ethnocloud.com/Franck_Biyong/?song=4676&amp;b=354|website=Ethnocloud|publisher=Ethnocloud|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; for his African "Guitar Hero" musical alternative&lt;ref name=Thom /&gt; and aesthetics.

==Early life and education==
Franck Biyong was born in [[France]] but grew up in [[Gabon]] , [[Nigeria]] and [[Ivory Coast]]. His father went to France as a student, graduated, became an English teacher and moved his family back to [[West Africa]] . 
Franck and his siblings attended the Institut National Supérieur des Arts et de l'Action Culturelle in Abidjan, Ivory Coast. He originally studied piano but dropped it in favour of drums, percussion and eventually, guitar. Franck's fondness for African-American Jazz guitarist, [[Wes Montgomery]]'s "Canadian Sunset" got him interested in electric guitar.

At age 14, Franck moved to [[England]] where he started working with various bands and recording demos influenced by musical heroes [[Prince Nico Mbarga]], [[Jimi Hendrix]], [[Frank Zappa]], [[William Onyeabor]], [[King Crimson]] and many others.

==Career==

===1997: Afrolectric===
[[Fela]]'s death in 1997 spurred Franck's return to France where he formed fifteen-piece band Massak&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Massak Live!|url=http://www.mpmmailorder.com/de/catalog/12-single/massak-live|website=Melting Pot Music|accessdate=20 May 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;—a [[Basaa]] (Cameroonian tongue and tribe) word that means music, trance and enjoyment through rhythms and sounds—to pay homage to the legendary musician and his [[Africa ′70|Africa 70]] and [[Egypt 80]] ensembles.

He termed his music then as "Afrolectric", a meeting of [[AfroBeat]] and influence from UK's [[electronica]] scene, and went on to form the Afrolectric Music label. Franck then toured clubs and festivals globally for several years (including appearances at the [[SOB's]] in New York, The Jazz Café in London and the Montréal Jazz Festival). His first official single, [[B.L.A]] (which stands for Brain Liberation Army) was released as a 7'inch vinyl on Lenar/Soul Fire Records. The two-part jam greatly appealed to gritty funk and Afrobeat lovers across the globe.

The 2006 ''Realms of the Atlantis&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Franck Biyong &amp; Massak - Realms Of Atlantis - out now on COLORED-INC.|url=http://www.parisdjs.com/index.php/post/Franck-Biyong-Massak-Realms-Of-Atlantis-out-now-on-Colored-Inc.|accessdate=27 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;'' would become Franck's first full-length album. It was a collection of moods and atmospheres exploring a more relaxed and spiritual musical dimension and broader range of influences. Franck Biyong expanded his repertoire a year later with sophomore release, ''Haiti Market'' a surprising psychedelic Afropop record paying tribute to the spirit of the Haitian cults and religions.

From that point on, Franck was releasing a new album&lt;ref name=Thom /&gt; every year: 2008 brought ''Spirits into Sounds'', 2009 saw the experimental ''Rhythms of our Memory'' and in 2010, Franck Biyong travelled to his homeland to record his fifth album, ''Visions of Kamerun&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Franck Biyong &amp; Massak – Visions of Kamerun|url=http://panafricanspacestation.org.za/franck-biyong-massak-visions-of-kamerun/|website=PASS|publisher=Chimurenga|accessdate=15 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;''. This was his final project with the band Massak and told the history of the colonial wars and linkages of the African nation with France.

Franck then formed new band The Afrolectric Orkestra, composed of young Caribbean and African musicians based in Europe as well as young rising stars of the Paris' Jazz scene.

They went on to release Franck's sixth album, ''Voodoolectric Ground&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Franck Biyong &amp; Massak - Voodoolectric Ground - out on COLORED-INC.|url=http://www.parisdjs.com/index.php/post/Franck-Biyong-Massak-Voodoolectric-Ground|website=Paris DJs|accessdate=12 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;''. In 2011, ''Jazz &amp; Africa&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Franck Biyong &amp; Afrolectric Orkestra - Jazz &amp; Africa : Knowledge Identity Reconstruction|url=http://grantphabao.com/blog/index.php/post/Franck-Biyong-And-Afrolectric-Orkestra-Jazz-And-Africa|website=Grant Phabao|accessdate=15 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;'' came out. It was an album filled with highly original renditions of songs by [[Manu Dibango]], [[Ornette Coleman]] and [[Sun Ra]] among others. The same year, Franck released ''Meeting the Basic Needs of The People&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Franck Biyong &amp; Afrolectric Orkestra - Meeting the Basic Needs of the People|url=http://grantphabao.com/blog/index.php/post/Franck-Biyong-Afrolectric-Orkestra-Meeting-the-Basic-Needs-of-the-People|website=Grant Phabao|accessdate=27 August  2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;'' with many long time collaborators in wide variety of personnel setting.

In 2012, ''Ki i Ye Yi'' was billed to Biyong and The Diamane Bantu Messengers (essentially a variation on Massak) with the assistance of the Paris DJs crew who released the LP with Afrolectric Music. The album had cameos by American Tenor Saxophonist [[:de:Ben Abarbanel-Wolff|Ben Abarbanel-Wolff]], musical director for Afrobeat Academy and Ghanaian highlife legends [[Ebo Taylor]] and [[Pat Thomas (musician)|Pat Thomas]].

Franck's final dalliance into Afro jazz would be the EP, ''21.12.2012 (Truth or Lies?)'' released in 2013. That same year, Biyong also issued a cover version of Fela Kuti's ''I.T.T (International Thief Thief)'' as a free download single.

===2014-Present===

===''International career''===
In 2014, he recorded his new single, Liyomba. The song is off Franck's upcoming 10th album release, Moonwatching&lt;ref name=Thom /&gt; and is an experiment in [[Rock music|Rock]], [[Electronic Music]], [[Trap music (hip hop)|Trap]], Afro-House and [[Psychedelics]]. It draws from the crucial role the moon plays in African culture, religion and spirituality. This forthcoming release shall fuse Franck's electric sound with the deep well of Afro-Futurism.

== Background ==
Frantic Assembly was formed in 1994 by Scott Graham, [[Steven Hoggett]], and Vicki Middleton, three students from [[Swansea University]]. None of the three studied Drama or any of the Arts, but were intrigued by theatre and wanted to create their own unique company.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.franticassembly.co.uk/about|title=About - Frantic Assembly|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They wished  to create non-naturalistic pieces through the use of movement and music, although they have always said that this should never take away from the storyline.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2015/jan/06/frantic-assembly-othello-scott-graham-steven-hoggett-interview|title=Frantic Assembly’s Othello: ‘You don’t want to put people off Shakespeare forever’|last=Gardner|first=Lyn|date=6 January 2015|work=The Guardian|access-date=24 November 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their most notable production, in co-operation with The National Theatre, is '''The Curious Incident Of The Dog In The Night-Time'''  which won a Tony award for Best Play in 2016. |n 2016 Frantic Assembly collaborated with State Theatre South Australia and [[Andrew Bovell]] to create ''Things I Know To Be True.'' This toured both Australia (2016) and the UK (2016 and 2017). In 2018, Frantic     Assembly launched their podcast the Frantic Assembly Podcast which has had guest appearances from old school teachers of Scott Graham, [[Simon Stephens]] and [[Karl Hyde]] from [[Underworld (band)|Underworld]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://franticassembly.co.uk/productions/podcast|title=Production - Frantic Assembly PodcastFrantic Assembly|last=Assembly|first=Frantic|website=franticassembly.co.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Galaxy Trucker''''' is a science-fiction [[board game]] for two to four players. The game was developed by [[Vlaada Chvatil]], with graphics designed by Radim Pech. The Czech version of the game was released in 2007 by Czech Games Edition, and a German version was published in the same year by Heidelberger Spieleverlag.

Vlaada Chvatil developed a video game version in 2014. It was released on 7 October 2014 for iPad,&lt;ref name="czechgames app ipad"&gt;{{cite web|title=Galaxy Trucker is now on iPad|url=http://czechgames.com/en/home/news-14-10-07-gt-on-ipad/|website=Czechgames.com|accessdate=7 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; on 24 December 2014 for iPhone and Android&lt;ref name="czechgames app iphone android"&gt;{{cite web|title=Galaxy Trucker is now available on iPhone and Android|url=http://czechgames.com/en/home/news-14-12-24-gt-for-iphone-and-android/|website=Czechgames.com|accessdate=7 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on 14 April 2015 for Windows Phone.&lt;ref name="czechgames app win phone"&gt;{{cite web|title=Galaxy Trucker is now available also on Windows Phone!|url=http://czechgames.com/en/home/news-15-04-03-galaxy-trucker-on-windows-phone/|website=Czechgames.com|accessdate=7 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Game Description==
Corporation Incorporated is a construction firm that builds sewer systems and [[low-income]] houses on under-developed planets. Galaxy Corp Inc. has been on the verge of bankruptcy which has resulted in the company transporting building materials to the edge of the Galaxy, where the need for their services is highest. Corporation Incorporated was saved by a few individuals who decided to not ship the materials to the edge of Galaxy and instead build the materials into spacecraft and let them ship themselves.
The players now just sign a contract, and then gain access to Corp Inc. Warehouse. The player can build their own [[space ship]] from the available prefabricated materials and fly it to the Periphery (edge of the Galaxy). The player may lose money, but any gains made are theirs to keep, and Corporation Incorporated will pay a bonus for quick delivery.
It’s possible that the player will end up with an immense amount of debt and end up begging for money on the street or they may just might find themselves among the 10 billion richest people in the Galaxy.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Galaxy Trucker|url=http://riograndegames.com/games.html?id=269|publisher=Rio Grande Games|accessdate=4 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
The game is played in three (or up to four with expansions) rounds with later rounds having bigger ships but more difficult travel. Each round consists of three phases: building, space travel, settlement. Before every round, four decks of card are prepared (3 public and 1 secret) and Evil machinations cards from expansion could be added.

=== Building phase===
Main phase of the game where players will construct their ship. In the beginning, all tiles are face down and all players are picking and building simultaneously. Hourglasses keep players under time pressure as faster building players can limit time available. A player who builds at least one tile can pick a public deck to check the dangers ahead.

=== Flight ===
All decks are shuffled together and played one by one by the leading player. Cards contains both positive and negative effects ([[meteor shower]]s, planets with goods, battlezones, [[slave ship|slaver]]s, [[pirate]]s) that can bring money and goods or remove pieces of ship (that must be repaid) or even force a player to return home.

=== Settlement ===
After flight, players receive bonuses for fastest delivery or the nicest ship and can sell goods. Also they have to settle payments for lost tiles.

== Expansions ==

===Gameplay===
The game features two Phases - the Ship building and Space Travel. The Player builds Ship from junk to get ready for trip as best as he can.

'''Gandini Juggling''' are a London-based [[contemporary circus]] company. Originally called Gandini Juggling Project, the company was founded in 1992 by Sean Gandini and Kati Ylä-Hokkala.&lt;ref name="Zetie"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zetie|first1=Ken|title=Evolution of the Group, Evolution of the Idea|journal=Kaskade|date=1993|issue=32|pages=26–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their initial works  focused on fusing juggling with principles from [[postmodern dance]], and were created in close collaboration with choreographer Gill Clarke. Gandini Juggling were early-adopters of [[siteswap]] notation, guided by their collaborations with Mike Day, who performed in their first two works.&lt;ref name="Zetie" /&gt;

In later years Gandini Juggling have explored juggling's relationship to art forms other than postmodern dance, and to date they have created over 30 stage and outdoor performances ranging from "radical art/juggling fusions to accessible theatrical performances, from choreographic studies to commercially commissioned routines."&lt;ref name="Gandini Webpage"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gandinijuggling.com/en/the-company/|title=Gandini Juggling|website=Gandini Juggling|accessdate=29 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Sean Gandini and Kati Ylä-Hokkala met whilst Gandini was performing one of his street shows in London's [[Covent Garden]]. Ylä-Hokkala, a former Finnish national champion in [[rhythmic gymnastics]] was "looking for a way to use her skills outside of the rigidly competitive system"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Marvel|first1=Cindy|title=Challenging Traditional Notions of Juggling Performance|agency=Juggler's World|date=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; of her sport. Prior to forming Gandini Juggling, both Gandini and Ylä-Hokkala worked for British-based [[new circus]] company [[Ra-Ra Zoo]].

===1991-1999===

From 1991-1999 Gandini Juggling worked closely with British choreographer Gill Clarke (1954-2011). During this time they made a number of performances that merged principles of [[postmodern dance]] with juggling. Critic Mary Brennan noted of the company's first show ''nEither Either botH and...'' that it was "tuned into the deepest values of postmodern dance even as it sets out to celebrate some of our oldest entertainment skills"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mary Brennan samples a day of dance and performance at St Brides|date=18 August 1993|agency=The Herald|last1=Brennan|first1=Mary}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that, the "... group suddenly confront us with the whole dancey essence of what it is to-have objects/bodies moving in space, forming relationships with that space, with other bodies."

Regular performers in this period included Mike Day (co-founder of [[siteswap]] notation), Lindsey Butcher (founder of aerial dance company [[Gravity &amp; Levity]]), Alix Wilding (co-founder of [[Feeding the Fish]]), and Ben Richter.

During this period Gandini Juggling also regularly presented their experiments in dance juggling at Juggling Conventions, such as the [[European Juggling Convention]].&lt;ref name="Zetie" /&gt;

===2000-2008===
In 2000 Gandini Juggling were commissioned to make a show for the [[Millennium Dome]] on London's [[Greenwich peninsula]], as part of London's Millennium celebrations. at the same time they also built a large glass cube and, with musician and juggler John Blanchard, begun to explore [[bounce juggling]] within this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gandini Juggling|title=Juggling Cube|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qw5a3rAr5BI|website=YouTube|accessdate=2 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They later went on to collaborate (in 2004) with John Blanchard and circus director [[John-Paul Zaccarini]] to make ''No Exit'' under the company name of K-DNK, supported by a [[Jerwood Award]] and London's [[National Centre for Circus Arts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Blanchard|first1=John|url=http://www.silicondrum.com/silverfilter.html|title=Silver Filter|website=Silicon Drum|accessdate=2 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004 Gandini Juggling first appeared as part of the [[London International Mime Festival]], presenting a double bill: ''Duet'' and ''Quartet''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LIMF Archive|url=http://www.mimelondon.com/archive2016.html|website=London International Mime Festival|accessdate=2 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Duet'' was Gandini Juggling's first narrative performance, exploring the relationship between a man and a woman. ''Quartet'' was a more formal choreography of juggling patterns.

Gandini Juggling's "fun and frothy"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ellingsworth|first1=John|title=Gandini Juggling: Watch This Space Residency|url=http://sideshow-circusmagazine.com/magazine/reviews/gandini-juggling-watch-space-residency|website=Sideshow Circus Magazine|accessdate=18 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Sweet Life'' was first performed in 2006. It was partly inspired by [[Federico Fellini]]'s film ''[[La Dolce Vita]]'', and it toured European city squares and other outdoor spaces for several years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilson|first1=Thomas J. M.|title=Juggling Trajectories: Gandini Juggling 1991-2015|date=2016|publisher=Gandini Press|location=London|isbn=978-0-9955024-1-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gandini Juggling returned to the [[London International Mime Festival]] in 2008 with ''Downfall''. This was an exploration of light and dark, and contained a number of [[glow juggling]] sequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Arratoon|first1=Liz|title=Downfall Review|url=https://www.thestage.co.uk/reviews/2008/downfall-review-at-clore-studio-royal-opera-house-london/|accessdate=2 April 2016|agency=The Stage|date=28 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also featured further experiments with the rhythmical sounds of bounce juggling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gandini Juggling|title=Bouncing from ''Downfall''|url=https://vimeo.com/1484542|website=Vimeo|accessdate=2 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2009-2015===
Between 2009 and 2012, Gandini Juggling were commissioned by England's [[Royal National Theatre|National Theatre]] to make a series of performances for the venue's Watch This Space summer festival of street and outdoor performance. The first of these performances was ''Nightclubs'' in 2009, a large-scale show that was "an abstract and technically complex ensemble show which collected a group of markedly different performers and joined them by their unabashed love of spreadsheet juggling and mathematics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ellingsworth|first1=John|title=Sean Gandini on Smashed|url=http://sideshow-circusmagazine.com/magazine/interviews/sean-gandini-smashed|website=Sideshow Magazine|accessdate=2 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed in 2010 by ''Smashed'', a [[Pina Bausch]]-inspired work "exploring conflict, lost love and quaint afternoon tea".&lt;ref name="Gandini Webpage" /&gt; The original 30-minute outdoor version of ''Smashed'' was later reworked into a 60-minute indoor version for the [[London International Mime Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/goingout/theatre/going-for-the-juggler-gandini-juggling-6378684.html|title=Going for the Juggler|date=14 December 2011|agency=Evening Standard|accessdate=2 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Smashed'' went on to become the company's most successful work being performed over 300 times between 2010 and 2015 &lt;INSERT REF&gt;. For 2011's Watch This Space the company presented ''Blotched'', and then in 2012 ''Twenty/Twenty'', a celebration of the company's 20th year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://londoncalling.com/show/the-juggling-man-sean-gandini|title=The Juggling Man - Sean Gandini|date=25 July 2012|agency=London Calling|last1=Mistry|first1=Anita|accessdate=2 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 Gandini Juggling premiered ''CLOWNS &amp; QUEENS'' at London's Shoreditch Town Hall, a show that was "full of sex, but it is never sexy, examining the nature of lust with an almost forensic attention..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gardner|first1=Lyn|title=CLOWNS &amp; QUEENS Review|url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2014/mar/28/clowns-and-queens-gandini-juggling-review|accessdate=2 April 2016|agency=The Guardian|date=28 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the [[London International Mime Festival]] in 2015 Gandini Juggling premiered ''4 x 4 (Ephemeral Architectures)'', a fusion of juggling and [[ballet]], at the [[Royal Opera House]] in London's Covent Garden. ''4 x 4 (Ephemeral Architectures)'' was directed by Sean Gandini and choreographed by [[Ludovic Ondiviela]] to the original composition ''Suspended Opus 69'' by [[Nimrod Borenstein]].

In the series, Fowlie portrays Danny Carter,  a 30-year-old "washed up" male go-go dancer who "must discover a way to find his 'purpose' and survive within a different lifestyle as he moves on from go-going."&lt;ref name="HP 2014-05"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/05/27/go-go-boy-interrupted_n_5359712.html |title=Go See 'Go-Go Boy Interrupted' Sketch Show Created By Jimmy Fowlie |work=[[The Huffington Post]] |first=James |last=Nichols |date=May 27, 2014 |accessdate=November 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Advocate 2014-10"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.advocate.com/arts-entertainment/hot-sheet/2014/10/23/hot-sheet-october-24-2014?page=0,1 |title=Hot Sheet: Divas and Demons |work=[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]] |first=Daniel |last=Reynolds |date=October 24, 2014 |accessdate=November 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on Fowlie's experience as a go-go dancer in [[West Hollywood]] while attending the [[University of Southern California]], the series asks the question, "What happens next after a go-go boy ages out of his profession?"&lt;ref name="HP 2014-05"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Groundlings 2014"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.groundlings.com/performers/performer-details.aspx?performerID=492 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140720074414/http://groundlings.com/performers/performer-details.aspx?performerID=492 |title=Teachers: Jimmy Fowlie (2014) |publisher=The Groundlings |archivedate=July 20, 2014 |accessdate=November 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fowlie told ''[[The Huffington Post]]'' in 2014:

{{Quote|In college I had worked as a go-go boy at this really popular club — and it was such an interesting world with outrageous characters: larger than life drag queens and 19-year-old party boys ... it just got me thinking — what happens when the party is over and someone can't leave? Dancing at a club doesn't give you any "real world skills". In other words, just like my degree in theater, it is worthless. When gay guys are using their youth and sexuality as currency, what happens when you get "aged out" of your career?&lt;ref name="HP 2014-05"/&gt;}}

Fowlie first performed ''Go-Go Boy Interrupted'' in June 2014 as a live sketch comedy show at The Groundlings.&lt;ref name="HP 2014-05"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Advocate 2014-10"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Queerty 2014-05"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.queerty.com/when-is-a-man-too-old-to-be-a-go-go-boy-20140529 |title=When Is A Man Too Old To Be A Go-Go Boy? |work=[[Queerty]] |first=Dan |last=Tracer |date=May 29, 2014 |accessdate=November 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Towle 2014-05"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.towleroad.com/2014/05/watch-teaser-for-new-sketch-comedy-show-go-go-boy-interrupted.html |title=Go-Go Boy Ages Out of His Career, Has to Start Over |work=[[Towleroad]] |first=Sean |last=Mandell |date=May 27, 2014 |accessdate=November 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WeHoville 2014-05"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wehoville.com/2014/05/26/jimmy-fowlie-injects-real-life-laughter-go-go-boy-interrupted/ |title=Jimmy Fowlie Injects Real Life (and Laughter) Into ‘Go Go Boy Interrupted’ |website=WeHoville.com |date=May 26, 2014 |accessdate=November 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Fowlie, the show continued with four months of sold-out shows, and he adapted it into a web series.&lt;ref name="About"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gogoboyinterrupted.com/#about |title=About ''Go-Go Boy Interrupted'' |website=gogoboyinterrupted.com |accessdate=November 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The live version is ongoing, with periodic performances scheduled through 2015.&lt;ref name="Groundlings 2014-10"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://purchase.groundlings.com/single/EventDetail.aspx?p=1411 |title=''Go-Go Boy Interrupted'' (October 13, 2014) |publisher=[[The Groundlings]] |accessdate=November 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Groundlings 2015-01"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://purchase.groundlings.com/single/EventDetail.aspx?p=1627 |title=''Go-Go Boy Interrupted'' (January 5, 2015) |publisher=The Groundlings |accessdate=November 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LAW 2015-01"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.laweekly.com/calendar/go-go-boy-interrupted-5322708 |title=''Go-Go Boy Interrupted'' |date=January 5, 2015 |work=[[LA Weekly]] |first=Siran |last=Babayan |accessdate=September 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The plot revolves around the two male leads trying to win the heart of Go Ho.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.allkpop.com/article/2016/03/girls-generations-yuri-and-kim-young-kwang-start-filming-for-web-drama-gogh-the-starry-night|title=Girls' Generation's Yuri and Kim Young Kwang start filming for web drama 'Gogh, The Starry Night' {{!}} allkpop.com|website=www.allkpop.com|access-date=2016-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.soompi.com/2016/03/29/girls-generations-yuri-and-kim-young-kwang-confirmed-for-new-web-drama/|title=Girls' Generation's Yuri and Kim Young Kwang Confirmed for New Web Drama|last=boxclub|website=Soompi|access-date=2016-05-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''heterogram''' (from ''hetero-'', meaning "different", + ''-gram'', meaning "written") is a word, phrase, or sentence in which no [[Letter (alphabet)|letter]] of the alphabet occurs more than once. 

An [[isogram]], in which all letters occur an equal number of times, is the same as a heterogram when each letter occurs once.

A heterogram may be distinguished from a [[pangram]] (a holoalphabetic sentence), which uses all of the letters of the alphabet (possibly more than once). A perfect heterogram is, however, the same as a perfect pangram, since both consist of all letters of the alphabet with each represented exactly once.

[[Abjad]]s and [[abugida]]s, in which only the consonants are represented in the basic [[grapheme]]s, have a naturally high incidence of heterograms.

'''''Hitch-Hike''''' ({{lang-it|Autostop rosso sangue|links=no}}, lit. "Blood-red hitchhiking"), also known as '''''Death Drive''''' and '''''The Naked Prey''''', is a 1977 Italian [[crime film]] directed by [[Pasquale Festa Campanile]]. The film stars [[Franco Nero]] and [[Corinne Cléry]] as a couple in a troubled marriage, and [[David Hess]] as a fugitive who takes them hostage. The musical score was written by [[Ennio Morricone]]. The film is based on Peter Kane's novel ''The Violence and the Fury''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Autostop rosso sangue (1977) | work=Elitisti | url=http://www.elitisti.net/review.php?id=1065 | accessdate=2008-06-02 | language=Finnish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Walter Mancini (Nero), an alcoholic reporter, and his wife Eve (Cléry) are on a [[road trip]] with a [[Travel trailer|trailer]] heading back to Los Angeles. Along the way, they pick up a [[hitch-hiker]] (Hess) who introduces himself as Adam Konitz. Konitz soon turns out to be a sadistic escapee from an institution for the criminally insane, and he is running from the law after robbing two million dollars with his partners. He takes the couple hostage and orders Eve to head to Mexico. They are soon stopped by two policemen and after Walter attempts to signal them by writing "[[SOS]]" on his matchbox, Konitz shoots them both.

While the three stop for the night, Konitz's two partners, whom he had betrayed to get all the loot for himself, shoot at Konitz and take control of the money and the car. They decide to keep the Mancinis alive until reaching the [[Mexico–United States border|Mexican border]]. While driving, they are attacked by someone in a truck. The attacker turns out to be Konitz who kills his former associates and again takes the Mancinis hostage. After they reach a secluded place, Konitz rapes Eve and forces Walter to watch the act. As Konitz gets ready to kill Walter, Eve shoots him with Walter's [[hunting rifle]].

Despite Eve's opposition, Walter decides to keep the two million instead of going to the police. After the four young motorcyclists the couple met at a gas station pass them and pour oil on the road, the Mancinis' car goes off the road and crashes. One of the youngsters takes three hundred from Walter's pocket, but leaves the suitcase on the back seat untouched. The thieves then ride away. Eve is badly hurt and requests help from Walter. Walter brings Konitz's body from their trailer and plants it on the accident scene. He then tells the dying Eve that the thieves had only helped him. He had planned to stop after 15 to 20 miles, kill her and make it look like an accident. After lighting up a cigarette and setting the car and the trailer on fire, Walter starts walking and, hearing a car come by, thumbs a ride.

==Production==
The film was based on ''The Violence and the Fury'' by Peter Kane.&lt;ref name="mfb-review" /&gt;

In ''The Devil Thumbs a Ride'', a short [[Documentary film|documentary]] on the film, Nero states that he became involved in the film because he already knew Campanile well, and Campanile had earlier stated his wish to work with him. Nero was in Germany shooting ''[[21 Hours at Munich]]'', in which Hess also had a small role, when Campanile called him and suggested starring in ''Autostop rosso sangue''. Because Hess wanted to work in Italy, Nero suggested him as the second male lead. Hess had earlier played a similar role in ''[[The Last House on the Left (1972 film)|The Last House on the Left]]''.&lt;ref name="bu"&gt;"The Devil Thumbs a Ride." Hitch-Hike DVD, [[Blue Underground]], Inc. 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Just a few days before the shooting of the film began, Nero broke his arm at the set of the [[Spaghetti Western]] ''[[Keoma (film)|Keoma]]'' while giving a misbehaving horse a punch. Nero approached Campanile with his problem and the script was quickly modified. In the final script, Nero's character hurts his hand in the beginning of the film and Cléry's character drives the car.&lt;ref name="bu"/&gt;

Because filming in the United States would have been too expensive, the film was shot in the mountains of the [[Gran Sasso]], around the city of [[L'Aquila]] in central Italy. The location resembled [[Northern California]], and American-like gas stations and signs were also created.&lt;ref name="bu"/&gt;

==Reception==
In a contemporary review, the ''[[Monthly Film Bulletin]]'', the film was condemned for being "dependent on heavy doses of violence to keep its predictable plot moving" and was "directed in a bland and featureless manner by Festa Campanile, and overtly portentous in its dialogue".&lt;ref name="mfb-review"&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Death Drive "(Autostop rosse sangue)"|magazine=[[Monthly Film Bulletin]]|volume=45|issue=528|page=153|year=1978|publisher=[[British Film Institute]]|location=United Kingdom|last=Badder|first=David}}&lt;/ref&gt; The review concluded that it was "notable only for its extensive borrowings: ''[[Duel (1971 film)|Duel]]'' for the murderous truck that terrorises car and trailer on the mountain road; ''[[The Wild One]]'' and company for the motorcycle louts deliberately causing havoc on the highways; and numerous 'road' movies for its general format." Morricone's score was praised as an "attractive score, which makes fine use of a theme tune played on guitar, to its credit."&lt;ref name="mfb-review" /&gt;

The '''King's Cup Sepaktakraw World Championship''' is a [[sepak takraw]] team event which is considered to be the most prestigious tournament in the sport as most top national teams compete in this annual event. The King's Cup is dedicated to His Majesty the [[King of Thailand]]. Three regus form a team and winning point is achieved once a team has the majority of two [[regu]] victories out of the three regus. 

==History==
The King's Cup tournament was first held in 1985 in Bangkok [[Thailand]] where [[Malaysia]] emerged as the inaugural champions. Malaysia became champions again in 1988 &lt;ref&gt;{{th icon}}[http://www.khaosod.co.th/view_news.php?newsid=TUROemNHODBNREkxTURjMU13PT0= โหมโรงตะกร้อโลก"คิงส์คัพ"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120329104517/http://www.khaosod.co.th/view_news.php?newsid=TUROemNHODBNREkxTURjMU13PT0= |date=2012-03-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the rest of the other editions saw Thailand as champions. The King's Cup tournament is seen by some especially the Malaysians as being unfair because it is never held outside of Thailand hence always giving the host nation an obvious upper hand and that the [[Asian Games]] is a fairer ground of competition.

25th King's Cup Sepaktakraw World Championship was held in the [[700th Anniversary Stadium]] from July 27 to August 1, 2010 with 23 competition teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{th icon}}[http://www.iamchiangmai.com/160-การแข่งขันเซปักตะกร้อชิงแชมป์โลก-คิงส์คัพ-ครั้งที่-25-ชิงถ้วยพระราชทาน การแข่งขันเซปักตะกร้อชิงแชมป์โลก คิงส์คัพ ครั้งที่ 25 ชิงถ้วยพระราชทาน]&lt;/ref&gt; And 26th King's Cup Sepaktakraw World Championship was held in Fasionisland on 12-17 September, 2011 with 23 competition teams in 8 tournaments.&lt;ref&gt;{{th icon}}[http://thainews.prd.go.th/view.php?m_newsid=255409070242&amp;tb=N255409&amp;news_headline=%A1%D2%C3%E1%A2%E8%A7%A2%D1%B9%B5%D0%A1%C3%E9%CD%AA%D4%A7%E1%AA%C1%BB%EC%E2%C5%A1%20%A4%D4%A7%CA%EC%A4%D1%BE%20%A4%C3%D1%E9%A7%B7%D5%E8%2026%20%E0%C3%D4%E8%C1%E1%A2%E8%A7%A2%D1%B9%C7%D1%B9%B7%D5%E8%2012%20%A1%D1%B9%C2%D2%C2%B9%B9%D5%E9 การแข่งขันตะกร้อชิงแชมป์โลก คิงส์คัพ ครั้งที่ 26 เริ่มแข่งขันวันที่ 12 กันยายนนี้] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120714150455/thainews.prd.go.th/view.php?m_newsid=255409070242&amp;tb=N255409&amp;news_headline=%A1%D2%C3%E1%A2%E8%A7%A2%D1%B9%B5%D0%A1%C3%E9%CD%AA%D4%A7%E1%AA%C1%BB%EC%E2%C5%A1%20%A4%D4%A7%CA%EC%A4%D1%BE%20%A4%C3%D1%E9%A7%B7%D5%E8%2026%20%E0%C3%D4%E8%C1%E1%A2%E8%A7%A2%D1%B9%C7%D1%B9%B7%D5%E8%2012%20%A1%D1%B9%C2%D2%C2%B9%B9%D5%E9 |date=2012-07-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''LED-backlit LCD''' is a [[flat panel display]] which uses [[LED]] [[backlight]]ing instead of the [[cold cathode#Lamps|cold cathode fluorescent]] (CCFL) backlighting.&lt;ref name="ledtele"&gt;[http://www.ledtele.co.uk/ledvslcd.html LED vs LCD TV Comparison]&lt;/ref&gt; LED-backlit displays use the same [[TFT LCD]] ([[thin-film-transistor liquid-crystal display]]) technologies as CCFL-backlit displays, but offer reduced energy consumption, better contrast and brightness, greater color range (using more expensive RGB LEDs, blue LEDs with RG phosphors, or [[quantum dot enhancement film]] (QDEF)),  more rapid response to changes in scene (with dynamic backlight dimming),  and [[photorefractive effect]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Bong-Ryeol Park and Ho-Young Cha, [http://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/elex/7/1/40/_pdf Thermal consideration in LED array design for LCD backlight unit applications], IEICE Electron.

While not an [[LED display]], a television using such a combination of an LED backlight with an LCD panel is called an ''LED TV'' by some manufacturers and suppliers&lt;ref name="ledtele"/&gt;&lt;ref name="asa"&gt;[https://www.asa.org.uk/Rulings/Adjudications/2013/12/Samsung-Electronics-UK-Ltd/SHP_ADJ_240995.aspx#.VXBNxs-qpBc [[Advertising Standards Authority (United Kingdom)|ASA]]Adjudication on Samsung Electronics UK Ltd]&lt;/ref&gt;.

==LED Arrangement==
[[File:Medical Econet PalmCare - display module - LED-backlit LCD-1405.jpg|thumb|Direct LED full array of a smaller LCD]]
LED backlights replace CCFL (fluorescent) lamps with several dozen to several hundred white or blue LEDs. Two types of LED arrangement may be used:

;Edge-lit LEDs:  LEDs form a line around the rim of the screen, with a special diffusion panel (light guide) to spread the light evenly behind the screen
;Direct LED full array: LEDs form an array directly behind the screen at equally spaced intervals

In Full array local dimming (FALD), LEDs are controlled individually to dynamically control the level of light intensity in a given part of the screen. This method of backlighting allows local dimming of specific areas of darkness on the screen, resulting in much higher dynamic-contrast ratios, though at the cost of less detail in small, bright objects on a dark background, such as star fields or shadow details.&lt;ref&gt;Scott Wilkinson. "[http://blog.ultimateavmag.com/scottwilkinson/ultimate_vizio/ Ultimate Vizio] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090826042143/http://blog.ultimateavmag.com/scottwilkinson/ultimate_vizio/ |date=26 August 2009 }}".

==Technology==
LED-backlit LCDs are not self-illuminating (unlike pure-LED systems). There are several methods of backlighting an LCD panel using LEDs, including the use of either white or RGB (Red, Green, and Blue) LED arrays behind the panel and edge-LED lighting (which uses white LEDs around the inside frame of the TV and a light-diffusion panel to spread the light evenly behind the LCD panel). Variations in LED backlighting offer different benefits. The first commercial full-array LED-backlit LCD TV was the [[Sony]] [[Qualia (Sony)|Qualia]] 005 (introduced in 2004), which used RGB LED arrays to produce a color gamut about twice that of a conventional CCFL LCD television. This was possible because red, green and blue LEDs have sharp spectral peaks which (combined with the LCD panel filters) result in significantly less bleed-through to adjacent color channels. Unwanted bleed-through channels do not "whiten" the desired color as much, resulting in a larger gamut. RGB LED technology continues to be used on Sony [[BRAVIA]] LCD models. LED backlighting using white LEDs produces a broader spectrum source feeding the individual LCD panel filters (similar to CCFL sources), resulting in a more limited display gamut than RGB LEDs at lower cost.

The commercially called "LED TV's" are LCDs-based television sets where the LED's are dynamically controlled using the video information&lt;ref&gt;LED TVs: 10 things you need to know; David Carnoy, David Katzmaier; CNET.com/news; 3 June 2010; https://www.cnet.com/news/led-tvs-10-things-you-need-to-know/&lt;/ref&gt;
(dynamic backlight control or dynamic “local dimming” LED backlight, also marketed as HDR, high dynamic range television, invented by Philips researchers Douglas Stanton, Martinus Stroomer and Adrianus de Vaan &lt;ref name="USRE42428E" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;LED local dimming explained; G. Morrison; CNET.com/news; 26 march 2016; https://www.cnet.com/news/led-local-dimming-explained/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pixel-by-pixel local dimming for high dynamic range liquid crystal displays; H.

The evolution of energy standards and the increasing public expectations regarding power consumption have made it necessary for backlight systems to manage their power. As for other consumer electronics products (e.g., fridges or light bulbs), energy consumption categories are enforced for television sets&lt;ref&gt;"Implementing directive 2005/32/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council with regard to ecodesign requirements for televisions”, 2009; http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:32009R0642&lt;/ref&gt;. Standards for power ratings for TV sets have been introduced, e.g., in the USA, EU, and Australia&lt;ref&gt;“EU Australia and US regulation on energy consumption in TV sets”, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in China&lt;ref&gt;“China Regulation on Energy Consumption in TV Sets”, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;. Moreover, a 2008 study&lt;ref&gt;“International survey on the importance of the energy efficiency of TV appliances”, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; showed that among European countries, power consumption is one of the most important criteria for consumers when they choose a television, as important as the screen size&lt;ref&gt;Controlling Power Consumption for Displays With Backlight Dimming; Claire Mantel et al; Journal of Display Technology; Volume: 9, Issue: 12, Dec. 2013; http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6520956/?reload=true&lt;/ref&gt;.

Using PWM (pulse-width modulation), a technology where the intensity of the LEDs are kept constant but the brightness adjustment is achieved by varying a time interval of flashing these constant light intensity light sources&lt;ref&gt;Dimming options for LCD brightness; J. Moronski; Electronicproducts.com; 3 Januari 2004; http://www.electronicproducts.com/Optoelectronics/Dimming_options_for_LCD_brightness_control.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;, the backlight is dimmed to the brightest color that appears on the screen while simultaneously boosting the LCD contrast to the maximum achievable levels, drastically increasing the perceived contrast ratio, increasing the dynamic range, improving the viewing angle dependency of the LCD and drastically reducing the power consumption.

The prismatic and reflective polarization films are generally achieved using so called DBEF films manufactured and supplied by 3M&lt;ref&gt;Brochure 3M Display Materials &amp; Systems Division Solutions for Large Displays: The right look matters; http://multimedia.3m.com/mws/media/977332O/display-materials-systems-strategies-for-large-displays.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Broadband reflective polarizers based on form birefringence for ultra-thin liquid crystal displays; S.U. Pan; L. Tan and H.S. Kwok; Vol. 25, No. 15; 24 Jul 2017; Optics Express 17499; https://www.osapublishing.org/oe/viewmedia.cfm?uri=oe-25-15-17499&amp;seq=0&lt;/ref&gt;. These reflective polarization films using uniaxial oriented polymerized liquid crystals (birefringent polymers or birefringent glue) are invented in 1989 by Philips researchers Dirk Broer, Adrianus de Vaan and Joerg Brambring&lt;ref&gt;Polarisation-sensitive beam splitter; D.J. Broer; A.J.S.M. de Vaan; J. Brambring; European patent EP0428213B1; 27 July 1994; https://worldwide.espacenet.com/publicationDetails/biblio?CC=EP&amp;NR=0428213B1&amp;KC=B1&amp;FT=D#&lt;/ref&gt;.

A first dynamic “local dimming” LED backlight was public demonstrated by [[BrightSide Technologies]] in 2003,&lt;ref&gt;[[Helge Seetzen|H. Seetzen]], et al.: "A [[High dynamic range imaging|High Dynamic Range]] Display System Using Low and High Resolution Modulators", SID03 Digest&lt;/ref&gt; and later commercially introduced for professional markets (such as video post-production).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bit-tech.net/hardware/2005/10/04/brightside_hdr_edr/1 BrightSide DR37-P HDR display]&lt;/ref&gt; Edge LED lighting was first introduced by [[Sony]] in September 2008 on the {{convert|40|in|adj=on}} BRAVIA KLV-40ZX1M (known as the ZX1 in Europe). Edge-LED lighting for LCDs allows thinner housing; the Sony BRAVIA KLV-40ZX1M is 1&amp;nbsp;cm thick, and others are also extremely thin.

LED-backlit LCDs have longer life and better energy efficiency than [[plasma display|plasma]] and CCFL [[LCD television|LCD TV]]s.&lt;ref name="samsung"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.samsung.com/us/productsubtype/led/ |title=Samsung.com |publisher=Samsung.com |date= |accessdate=17 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike CCFL backlights, LEDs use no [[mercury (element)|mercury]] (an environmental pollutant) in their manufacture. However, other elements (such as [[gallium]] and [[arsenic]]) are used in the manufacture of the LED emitters; there is  debate over whether they are a better long-term solution to the problem of screen disposal.

Because LEDs can be switched on and off more quickly than CCFLs and can offer a higher light output, it is theoretically possible to offer very high contrast ratios. They can produce deep blacks (LEDs off) and high brightness (LEDs on). However, measurements made from pure-black and pure-white outputs are complicated by the fact that edge-LED lighting does not allow these outputs to be reproduced simultaneously on screen.{{Clarify|date=September 2011}}

Full-array backlights that use mini-LED panels, consisting of several thousand WLEDs, are being researched for TVs and mobile devices.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ledinside.com/news/2017/10/mini_led_tv_backlight_and_display_to_be_rolled_out_soon LEDInsight: Mini LED TV Backlight and Display to Be Rolled Out Soon]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quantum dot enhancement film===
{{main|Quantum dot display}}
In September 2009 [[Nanoco]] Group announced a joint development agreement with a major Japanese electronics company, under which it will design and develop [[quantum dot]]s (QDs) for LED backlights in LCDs.&lt;ref name="Quantum Dots in LED Backlit LCD television"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nanocogroup.com/content/Library/NewsandEvents/articles/Nanoco_Signs_Agreement_with_Major_Japanese_Electronics_Company/136.aspx|title=Nanoco PR: "Nanoco Signs Agreement with Major Japanese Electronics Company"}}&lt;/ref&gt; Quantum dots are [[photoluminescence|photoluminescent]]; they are useful in displays because they emit light in specific, narrow [[normal distribution]]s of [[wavelength]]s. To generate white light best suited as an LCD backlight, parts of the light of a blue-emitting LED are transformed by quantum dots into small-bandwidth green and red light such that the combined white light allows for a nearly ideal color [[gamut]] generated by the RGB color filters of the LCD panel. In addition, efficiency is improved, as intermediate colors are not present anymore and don't have to be filtered out by the color filters of the LCD screen. This can result in a display that more accurately renders colors in the [[visible spectrum]]. Other companies are also developing quantum dot solutions for displays: [[Nanosys]], [[3M]] as a licensee of Nanosys and QD Vision of [[Lexington, Massachusetts|Lexington]], [[Massachusetts]].&lt;ref&gt;IEEE Spectrum, 2012, 8, p.11-12 ''Quantum Dots Are Behind New Displays''&lt;/ref&gt; This type of backlighting was demonstrated by various TV manufacturers at the [[Consumer Electronics Show]] 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://spectrum.ieee.org/tech-talk/consumer-electronics/audiovideo/ces-2015-placing-bets-on-the-new-tv-technologies ''CES 2015 - Placing bets on the New TV Technologies.''] IEEE Spectrum, January 7, 2015. Retrieved January 12, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Samsung introduced their first 'QLED' [[quantum dot display]]s at CES 2017 and later formed the 'QLED Alliance' with [[Hisense]] and [[TCL Corporation|TCL]] to market the technology.&lt;ref name=qled_alliance&gt;http://www.flatpanelshd.com/news.php?subaction=showfull&amp;id=1493202792&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nanosysinc.com/dot-color-archive/2017/4/18/welcome-to-the-qled-era&lt;/ref&gt;

=== {{anchor|Flicker due to backlight dimming}}Backlight-dimming flicker ===
LED backlights are often dimmed by applying [[pulse-width modulation]] to the supply current, switching the backlight off and on more quickly than the eye can perceive. If the dimming-pulse frequency is too low or the user is sensitive to flicker, this may cause discomfort and eyestrain (similar to the [[Cathode ray tube#Flicker|flicker of CRT displays]] at lower [[refresh rate|refresh rates]]).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tftcentral.co.uk/articles/content/pulse_width_modulation.htm#side_effects&lt;/ref&gt; This can be tested by a user simply by waving their hand in front of the screen; if it appears to have sharply-defined edges as it moves, the backlight is pulsing at a fairly low frequency. If the hand appears blurry, the display either has a continuously-illuminated backlight or is operating at a frequency too high to perceive. Flicker can be reduced (or eliminated) by setting the display to full brightness, although this degrades image quality and increases power consumption.

The '''lament for Sumer and Urim''' or the '''lament for Sumer and Ur''' is a [[poem]] and one of five known [[Mesopotamia]]n "city laments"&amp;mdash;[[dirge]]s for ruined cities in the voice of the city's [[tutelary deity|tutelary goddess]].

The other city laments are:
*The [[Lament for Ur]]
*The [[Lament for Nippur]]
*The [[Lament for Eridu]]
*The [[Lament for Uruk]]

In 2004 BCE, during the last year of [[Ibbi-Sin|King Ibbi-Sin]]'s reign, Ur fell to an army from the east.&lt;ref&gt;The lamentation over the destruction of Sumer and Ur, [[Piotr Michalowski]], 1989, pg. 1&lt;/ref&gt; The Sumerians decided that such a catastrophic event could only be explained through divine intervention and wrote in the lament that the gods, "An, Enlil, Enki and Ninmah decided [Ur's] fate"&lt;ref&gt;Ancient Near Eastern Themes in Biblical Theology, By Jeffrey Jay Niehaus, 2008, 117&lt;/ref&gt;

The literary works of the Sumerians were widely translated (e.g. by the [[Hittites]], [[Hurrians]] and [[Canaanites]]), and the world-renowned expert in Sumerian history, [[Samuel Noah Kramer]], wrote that later [[Greek language|Greek]] as well as [[Hebrew]] texts "were profoundly influenced by them."&lt;ref&gt;The Sumerians: Their history, culture and character, [[Samuel Noah Kramer]], pg.196, http://oi.uchicago.edu/sites/oi.uchicago.edu/files/uploads/shared/docs/sumerians.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary scholars have drawn parallels between the lament and passages from the bible (e.g. "the Lord departed from his temple and stood on the mountain east of Jerusalem (Ezekiel 10:18-19)."&lt;ref&gt;Ancient Near Eastern Themes in Biblical Theology, By Jeffrey Jay Niehaus, 2008, 118&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20319">[[Mediacorp Channel 8]]'s television series '''''[[Dream Coder]]''''' is a show in 2017 produced by Mediacorp. The story BEGAN APPS on making new apps to improve lives of people.

The show will begin airing on [[Mediacorp Channel 8]] in Singapore from 7 February 2017.

==Episodic Guide==
'''Episode 1''' - Began Apps is a three-year-old mobile app developer. Zheng Hongyi is the firm's chief technology officer. He also develops RPG online games. He Jianming and Fang Ru are talented software engineers with Began Apps. They do not see eye-to-eye on the 'Try On Glasses' app. Their project director, Zhong Zhenlong, tries to mediate. Zhenlong's elder sister, Yayun, is a rich housewife. Her husband, Ouyang Fan, is the owner of a chain of eyewear stores. She dotes on her daughter, Keke, and is dependent on Zhenlong for the smooth running of her domestic affairs. Xu Guangda is the sales representative for Meiya Eyewear. He is friendly and promotes his products enthusiastically. Yayun feels he is dishonest and thinks badly of his frugal habits. Fang Ru's parents, Tianren and Mei’e, are retired doctors. They had hoped Fang Ru would follow in their footsteps. Disappointed, they despise her current job. Ouyang Fan's cheque to Guangda's company has bounced. Guangda is forced by his superior to track Ouyang Fan down for prompt payment. He goes to Ouyang Fan's house. Entering the master bedroom, he sees Yayun in an alluring nightgown.

'''Episode 2''' - Yayun mistakes Guangda for a pervert. Fortunately, Ouyang Fan returns and clears the misunderstanding. Yayun casts aside her unhappiness and enjoys a romantic wedding anniversary celebration with Ouyang Fan. Fang Ru and Jianming are called back to the office on a weekend to fix an app malfunction. She totes her dog, Momo, along. It becomes clear Jianming is afraid of dogs, and she teases him relentlessly. A female student, Huixin, idolises Hongyi and wants to get close to him. To get her off his back, he pretends Jianming is his boyfriend. Jingcheng, the co-founder of Began Apps, returns from a business trip. He hires Huixin, who is from a wealthy background, as an intern, despite Hongyi's objections. Guangda's son, Jiahui, and Keke have a disagreement. Yayun and Guangda refuse to budge from their stance. Later, Guangda realises Jiahui is lying. At home, Yayun finds her jewellery missing. She and Zhenlong check the CCTV recording and discover Ouyang Fan is the thief. It turns out he is leaving Singapore that night with a young woman named Jean.

''' Episode 3 ''' -
Yayun cannot believe Ouyang Fan has abandoned her. She makes up a story to convince herself of a different reality, and Zhenlong worries about her. Zhenlong and Fang Ru meet a client. Zhenlong keeps checking the IP camera on his handphone to monitor Yayun's movements, much to Fang Ru's disapproval. He sees Yayun taking a knife into the bedroom and is horrified. Jianming wants Hongyi to clarify their relationship to Huixin but he refuses. Instead, it is Fang Ru who explains to her that Jianming and Hongyi are just colleagues and Hongyi is single. Guangda's boss blames him for Ouyang Fan's bounced cheque. Guangda goes to Yayun's house and demands the money. He tells her the eyewear store has shut down and Ouyang Fan has run away with his mistress. Keke calls Zhenlong, saying Yayun has not picked her up. Zhenlong manages to find Yayun, who is convinced Ouyang Fan still cares about her. She wants to go to Bangkok to look for him. Unable to change Yayun's mind, Zhenlong takes her to the airport. He chances upon his ex-girlfriend, Ruiqing, who tells him a piece of earth-shattering news.

'''Episode 4''' - Huixin is attracted to Jianming and wants to learn more about him. Jianming shows his mother, Xiuxiang, evidence he has found on the Internet showing that her boyfriend, Kay, is not a good man. Kay manages to explain Jianming's allegations away. A customer at the massage parlour falls and hurts his head. Fang Ru happens to be around and gives first aid. Jianming's view of her changes. Fang Ru discovers Zhenlong secretly following Ruiqing. He comforts Ruiqing in an effort to help her get over a broken relationship. To his disappointment, he learns she is waiting for Max to apologise and seek a reconciliation with her. Guangda's deadline is approaching, and he has not been able to get the money Ouyang Fan owes. He asks Kenny to put in a good word for him to the boss. Instead, Kenny humiliates him. Guangda punches him in the face and is arrested. He is forced to resign. Guangda arrives home, wondering how to break the news of his termination. He witnesses Meimei being harassed by a man and intervenes. He is pushed to the ground.

'''Episode 5''' - Jingcheng has reservations about Hongyi spending so much time on a bus game with no commercial value. Hongyi replies that he is developing it for fun. Jingcheng takes Hongyi to meet Huixin's father, Li Junheng, a potential client. Their purpose is to build relationship, but they leave a bad impression instead. Jianming has hurt his ankle. Fang Ru takes him to the clinic run by her brother, Fang Bo. Jianming finds his heart racing when Fang Ru comes close and is attentive to him. Xiuxiang suspects Jianming has fallen for Fang Ru. He denies this at first, but after trawling the Internet for information on signs of love, he no longer has doubts. Out of job, Guangda is feeling the strain of his medical expenses. He acts nonchalantly in Meimei's presence, but realises he has to face up to his financial struggles. He starts looking for employment. Yayun receives the shocking news that her car and house have been sold by Ouyang Fan. She is devastated by her sudden losses.

'''Episode 6''' - 
Yayun and Keke move into Zhenlong's house. To relieve Yayun's stress over her plight, Zhenlong introduces her to online shopping. Zhenlong and Fang Ru actively seek to partner with a large charitable organisation for the development of an SOS app. They want to tap into the charity's volunteer base, a potential pool of people who can use their app to respond to patients with critical illnesses. Zhenlong discovers Fang Ru has a fear of internal organs, which was the reason she dropped out of medical school. She wants to be able to help others by completing the app. Jingcheng finds out Huixin and Junheng do not see eye-to-eye on her plan to launch a startup. He advises her to have a good talk with Junheng. To his exasperation, Hongyi encourages her to go ahead. Guangda does not get beyond an interview at Began App. He takes part in a ramen-eating competition. Hongyi, who happens to be present, is impressed by his determination and cheers him on. Realising he likes Fang Ru, Jianming avoids her. Zhenlong is stunned to find Yayun has chalked up more than $10,000 in online purchases.

'''Episode 7''' - Hongyi teaches Jianming how to tell a girl he likes her. When Jianming develops the mistaken idea that Fang Ru likes him, he makes a cute animation of the two of them. Zhenlong changes the password of Yayun's online account and lies that the website has malfunctioned. Yayun accidentally hits a motorcycle and injures the driver. Fearing her driving licence might be suspended, she calls Zhenlong to ask him to compensate the driver. Yayun and Annie bump into Guangda, who is now selling intelligent cookers. Yayun thinks he is dishonest and pulls Annie away. Later on, she finds out it was Ouyang Fan's fault that Guangda had lost his job. His positive attitude changes her perception of him. By chance, Yayun finds out Zhenlong had lent a sum of money to Ouyang Fan and the loan remains unpaid. In more recent times, he has sold his watch, a longtime possession. It strikes her that she has been a burden to him. Yayun goes to Keke's school to pick her up but Keke is missing.

'''Episode 8''' - Yayun tells Zhenlong she appreciates what he has done for her and promises to pull herself together. Guangda is notified that he is being hired by Began Apps. When he starts work, he realises it is all a mistake; he has not been hired. He begs Jingcheng to give him a chance but is rejected. However, Hongyi gives him three months to prove himself. Zhenlong notices that Guangda is not at all IT savvy. Nonetheless, he gives the latter encouragement. Jingcheng knows Zhenlong is having financial issues and offers him a loan. Zhenlong asks him to consider hiring Yayun as a data analyst. Xiuxiang shares with Fang Ru that she has difficulty communicating with her son, Jianming. Fang Ru suggests starting with Jianming's interests. Yayun begins an online business. Little does she expect to find that the beauty products she has ordered are fakes. Zhenlong and Fang Ru go to a park to test the SOS app. She slips and falls into a drain. As he pulls her up, they fall into an embrace and she finds her heart racing.

'''Episode 9''' - Guangda is determined to learn wireframe even though he is ridiculed by Jiahui. He meets a client and promises to fulfil the latter's additional requirements at no extra cost. During a meeting, Jingcheng voices his displeasure at Guangda's misjudgment. He wants to terminate his employment. Hongyi and Zhenlong manage to talk him around. Huixin joins the accelerator programme. Jingcheng shares his working experiences with her. Jingcheng agrees to employ Yayun. She lacks confidence but decides to give the job a try. Keke and Zhenlong cheer her on. On her first day of work, Yayun comes to realise Hongyi is her boss and is incredulous. Jianming secretly installs an app into Fang Ru's handphone. Hongyi is sceptical about Yayun's capabilities. Zhenlong vouches for her. The secret app in Fang Ru's handphone is triggered and an animated declaration of Jianming's love plays. She accepts him.

'''Episode 10''' - Jianming professes his love for Fang Ru. Thinking he is playing a prank on her, she scolds him. Later on, Fang Ru finds out by chance that Jianming really likes her. Meanwhile, Jianming is nursing the rejection; it is a big blow to him. They become awkward in each other's presence. Huixin's internship is about to end. She confesses her love for Jianming, even though she realises he likes Fang Ru. She gives them her blessings. Yayun is unhappy at remarks that she got her job by pulling strings. Hongyi defends her and cheers her up. Fang Ru is pleased the SOS app is well-received. She buys Zhenlong dinner. Guangda asks Zhenlong if developing an app to pre-plan one's own funeral is feasible. Intrigued by the idea, Zhenlong tells him to draw up a proposal. At Yayun's encouragement, Zhenlong asks Fang Ru out. They receive a help alert on their SOS app and are shocked to find Tianren unconscious.

'''Episode 11''' - 
Tianren undergoes surgery, which is a success. Because Fang Ru had promptly administered CPR, he is alive. She hugs Zhenlong in relief and thanks him for helping her develop the SOS app. Zhenlong visits Tianren at the hospital. Tianren shows his interest in the mobile apps developed by Began Apps. Fang Ru is glad he is gradually showing signs of accepting her job. Hongyi is asked by his landlord to move out in three days. Knowing it's a challenge to find another place in such a short time, Zhenlong suggests Hongyi move into his house temporarily. Yayun tries to object but to no avail. Xiuxiang finds out Jianming likes Fang Ru and tries to put in a good word for him. Fang Ru tells Jianming she already has someone she likes. Fang Ru dresses up and waits for Zhenlong outside the concert hall, where they are supposed to watch a musical. Zhenlong goes to meet Ruiqing instead. He finds out she is divorced.

'''Episode 12''' - Hongyi moves into Zhenlong's house. He connects with Keke through video games and they get along well. Zhenlong takes Ruiqing cycling at East Coast Park. He recalls their past and has mixed feelings about it. Zhenlong admits to Fang Ru he had missed their date because he was consoling Ruiqing. She tries to conceal her jealousy. After numerous setbacks, Guangda finally finds a client who is willing to invest in the funeral app. He and Yayun are thrilled. Huixin and Yuchen participate in the accelerator programme. They feel depressed when their proposal is rejected. Yayun is gradually accepted by her colleagues and is pleased. Sympathising with Jianming's failed attempt at love, Hongyi tries to lift his mood. He takes him drinking but gets drunk instead. Jianming realises Xiuxiang cares about his feelings when she turns down a date with Kay. Yayun helps the drunk Hongyi into the house. Intoxicated, he kisses her.

'''Episode 13''' - Guangda buys a cake for Yayun, who gives it to Joy instead. His heart aches when he finds out. Hongyi thinks Guangda likes Joy. Jingcheng gets funding for a share app. Hongyi asks Yayun to assist in the development. Jingcheng finds an apartment for Hongyi but the latter plans to stay at Zhenlong's house. Jingcheng can see that Hongyi likes Yayun but feels she is not suitable for him. Thinking Zhenlong is back in a relationship with Ruiqing, Fang Ru gives him the cold shoulder. Yayun wants to buy back the watch Zhenlong had sold. She is upset to learn it has been sold again. Guangda gets the name of the watch buyer and, after much effort, buys the watch back. Guangda takes the watch to Yayun, who has just received news that Ouyang Fan has passed away.

'''Episode 14''' - Jianming encounters Kay, who reveals he has broken up with Xiuxiang. Meanwhile, Xiuxiang acts like nothing has happened and continues to show concern for Jianming. He is touched. Hongyi takes Huixin and Yuchen to meet a group of young entrepreneurs. Motivated when they share their experiences, Huixin and Yuchen decide to continue to pursue their dreams. Zhenlong is uncomfortable about the warm interaction between Fang Ru and Jianming. Zhenlong and Ruiqing have dinner together. Both sense a huge change and try hard to accommodate each other. Zhenlong tells her frankly that he has someone he likes. Hongyi wants to court Yayun but Zhenlong thinks they are not suitable for each other. Jianming is touched when Xiuxiang tries to enter his life by learning to use all sorts of apps and playing the games he has designed. He creates an animated message and apologises to her. Zhenlong expresses his love for Fang Ru but is rejected. She collapses suddenly and he panics.

'''Episode 15''' - 
Fang Ru knows her fainting spells have been caused by brain tumours. Zhenlong feels terrible when she behaves coldly towards him. Yayun returns home after seeing to Ouyang Fan's funeral in Thailand. He had been knocked down by a car and died from his injuries. Jianming senses that something is bothering Fang Ru. He and Zhenlong send text messages to her to express their concern. Yayun is grateful to Guangda for getting Zhenlong's watch back. He lies that he had bumped into the previous buyer by chance. Hongyi hints to Yayun that he likes her. She shares that she is not ready for a relationship. Officers from the Technology Crime Division investigate Began Apps when fraudulent credit card transactions are reported by online gamers. For security reasons, Hongyi takes down the gaming website temporarily. Yayun learns Guangda likes her and gives him a scolding. She maintains she will never like him because he is married. He is dumbfounded.

'''Episode 16''' - 
Guangda explains his relationship with Meimei to Yayun. In turn, she shares that she has no intention of entering into a relationship for the time being. Concerned about the cyber security loophole found in Began Apps’ gaming website, Zhenlong's client puts their plans to collaborate on hold. Began Apps staffers are anxious about the negative impact of the news reports on their compromised gaming website. Jingcheng encourages them to remain united as the company handles the crisis. Hongyi is shocked to learn the cyber security consultant Jingcheng has hired to investigate the security lapse is his former girlfriend, Regina Wee. Jianming suspects Fang Ru has a problem with her eyesight. Worried, he hacks into her e-diary to find out what is going on in her life. The police confirm a hacker had bypassed Began Apps’ firewall and attacked their server. Fang Ru is devastated by the results of her medical report. She goes to the roof-top, and Jianming, who is following her, gets the mistaken idea she is about to commit suicide. She breaks down in his arms.

'''Episode 17''' - Fang Ru and Jianming take leave together. Everyone wonders why. Regina ridicules Yayun for staying with Hongyi. Joy has bought a branded bag. When she lies that it's a replica, Yayun becomes suspicious. Yayun and Hongyi find out Joy is the person in cahoots with the hacker. Jingcheng suggests handing the evidence over to the police, but Yayun hopes to convince Joy to turn herself in. Hongyi realises by chance that Guangda likes Yayun, and tries to prevent them from being together. Fang Ru knows both Jianming and Zhenlong are good to her. However, due to her illness, she is unable to reciprocate either man's feelings. Yayun senses something is wrong with Fang Ru. Zhenlong asks Jianming, who shares that Fang Ru has a brain tumour. They assure Fang Ru they will take care of her and face the illness with her. Unexpectedly, she collapses.

'''Episode 18''' - Fang Ru loses her eyesight because the tumour is affecting her optic nerve, but she refuses to undergo an operation. When Zhenlong fails to talk her round, Jianming gives her a severe scolding. Huixin and Yuchen take part in a competitive pitch. Junheng is one of the judges; he is impressed by their presentation. Fang Ru finally plucks up the courage to face her deteriorating condition. She decides to go overseas to have the surgery, but does not tell Zhenlong and Jianming. She leaves without a word to anyone. Yayun bumps into Ouyang Fan's mistress, Jean, who reveals he had wanted to apologise to her and Keke before he died. Jingcheng encounters a businessman, Joel, who thinks highly of him. Joel offers to help him set up his own company. Jingcheng declines. Yayun realises Guangda is very concerned about her. Jealous, Hongyi confronts Guangda and insists the latter should stop pursuing her.

'''Episode 19''' - Guangda admits to Hongyi that he likes Yayun. They decide to compete fairly. Guangda comes realise Keke keeps throwing tantrums because she doesn’t understand Ouyang Fan has died. Using a story, he patiently explains to her how much Yayun has done for her. Investors pull out from the development of the share-share app. Jingcheng tries to talk Junheng around but fails. His unhappiness towards Hongyi grows. Junheng changes his mind and decides to invest in the share-share app. Everyone gives Hongyi credit. Jingcheng is sullen. Fang Ru goes out on dates with Jianming and Zhenlong separately. She finds each has his own merits. Jingcheng does not show up at the launch of the share-share app. Zhenlong and Jianming discover irregularities with the server, and it fails to start up. Jingcheng cannot be contacted.

'''Episode 20''' - During its launch, the share-share app does not function. The computer system has been attacked by a virus and the app is compromised. Guangda wonders about Jingcheng's sudden disappearance but Hongyi dismisses his suspicions. Another company releases an identical app called Let's Share. Hongyi learns Jingcheng has sabotaged and betrayed them. Junheng drops his investment in the share-share app. Hongyi sinks into depression. Zhenlong steps forward to take the reins. Under his leadership the team fixes the share-share app, and he begs Junheng to give them another chance. His team's determination inspires him, and Hongyi pulls himself together. Guangda is disheartened by Yayun's concern for Hongyi. Hongyi decides to start afresh. He changes the company's name to Rebegan and makes everyone a shareholder. The revamped share-share app is launched to good reviews. Both Hongyi and Guangda confess their feelings for Yayun. Huixin fakes an accident so that Fang Ru will discern her real feelings for Jianming and Zhenlong.

'''Mafia''', also known as '''Werewolf''', is a [[party game]] created by Dmitry Davidoff in 1986&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=François Haffner |url=http://jeuxsoc.fr/jeu/mafid |title=Questions to Dimitry Davidoff about the creation of Mafia on the French website |publisher=Jeuxsoc.fr |date=1999-02-22 |accessdate=2011-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; modelling a conflict between two groups: an informed minority (the [[mafia]]), and an [[Information asymmetry|uninformed]] majority (the innocents). At the start of the game, each player is secretly assigned a role affiliated with one of these teams. The game has two alternating phases: one, during which the mafia may covertly "murder" an innocent, and two, in which surviving players debate the identities of the mafia and vote to eliminate a suspect. The game continues until all of the mafia have been eliminated or until the mafia outnumbers the innocents.

==History==
Dmitry Davidoff ({{lang-ru|Дми́трий Давы́дов}}, ''Dmitry Davydov'') is generally acknowledged as the game's creator. He dates the first game to spring 1987 at the [[Psychology]] Department of [[Moscow State University]], spreading to classrooms, dorms, and summer camps of [[Moscow University]].&lt;ref name="zarf"&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.eblong.com/zarf/werewolf.html | title = Werewolf page ''History'' section}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;Plotkin quotes a 2005 email in which Davidoff explains that he brought Mafia into the Psychology department classrooms for research and it spread (as a [[meme]]) from there to dormitories and likely over next summer, through student summer camps. He credits this game-based [[methodology]] to pioneering 1920s psychologist [[Lev Vygotsky|Lev Vygotskiy]].&lt;/ref&gt; ''Wired'' attributes the creation to Davidoff but dates the first game to 1987,&lt;ref name=wired2010 /&gt; with 1986 being the year in which Davidoff was starting the work which would produce Mafia. He developed the game to combine psychology research with his duties teaching [[high school]] students.&lt;ref name=wired2010&gt;{{Cite journal | last1=Robertson | first1=Margaret | title=Werewolf: How a parlour game became a tech phenomenon | url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/werewolf | accessdate=2010-06-06 | journal=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired UK]] | issue =3.10 |date=2010-02-04 | publisher=Conde Nast Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game became popular in other Soviet colleges and schools and in the 1990s it began to be played in other parts of Europe and then the United States. By the mid 1990s a version of the game became a [[Television in Latvia|Latvian television]] series (with a parliamentary setting, and played by Latvian celebrities).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |location= Boulder |date=December 1998 |title= The Military and Society in the Former Eastern Bloc |editor1-first= C.

[[Andrew Plotkin]] gave the rules a [[werewolf]] theme in 1997,&lt;ref name="zarf2"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.eblong.com/zarf/werewolf.html| title = Werewolf ''A Mind Game''}} is Plotkin's own description of the original Werewolf version&lt;/ref&gt; arguing that the mafia were not that big a cultural reference, and that the werewolf concept fit the idea of a hidden enemy who looked normal during the daytime.&lt;ref name=wired2010 /&gt; Mafia and a variant called Thing&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;In which the antagonists are [[The Thing (1982 film)|Things]], shape-shifting aliens that can turn humans into other Things.

Retrieved 2014-05-16.&lt;/ref&gt; The werewolf theme was also incorporated in the French adaption of Mafia, [[The Werewolves of Millers Hollow]].

In August 2000, a user under the alias "[[Gandalf|mithrandir]]" of The Grey Labyrinth, a website devoted to puzzles and puzzle solving, ran a game of mafia adapted for play on a forum board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://greylabyrinth.com/discussion/viewtopic.php?p=217704 | title = Mafia!! | date = 20 August 2000 | website = The Grey Labyrinth | publisher = mithrandir | access-date = 21 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both The Grey Labyrinth&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.greylabyrinth.com/discussion/index.php | title = Forum Index | website = The Grey Labyrinth | access-date = 21 July 2016 | quote = "The Internet's First Home of Mafia."}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sister site MafiaScum&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://wiki.mafiascum.net/index.php?title=History_of_the_game | title = History of the game | date = 31 January 2007 | website = MafiaScum | access-date = 21 July 2016 | quote = "mith had been visiting [The Grey Labyrinth] since 1996, and started posting in the forums soon after they started. mith had played face-to-face Mafia with his church youth group in the late 1990's, and one day decided it would run well on the forums.

From there, Mafia has spread to numerous online communities.

In March 2006 Ernest Fedorov was running a Mafia Club in [[Kiev]], using his own [[patent]]ed variation of the rules. The club organizes games, [[Elo rating system#Use outside of chess|rates players]], and awards prizes (including a [[Sicily]] trip for their tournament-series champion).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.kyivweekly.com/?art=1141859356 | title = Intellectuals playing mafia games | date= 2006-03-08 | first = Pavlo | last = Berest | quote = Now the rules of the game are the intellectual property of Fedorov.}} The club has its own rules, see: {{cite web | url = http://io.com.ua/www.php?w=http://mafia.kiev.ua | title = Club Империя Мафии}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2006 a [[Rockingham County, New Hampshire|Rockingham]] school inquiry was launched after parents complained of the traumatic effects classroom Mafia was having on their [[Fifth grade|fifth-grade]] children. Davidoff responded to the reports, saying that as a parent who had studied [[child psychology]] for 25 years, he felt that the game could "teach kids to distinguish right from wrong", and that the positive message of being honest could overcome the negative effects of an "evil narrator" moderating the game as if it were a scary story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.seacoastonline.com/articles/20060804-NEWS-308049902 | title = School officials still investigating 'Mafia' | first = Aaron | last = Davis | publisher = [[Seacoast Media Group]] | date= 2006-08-04 | quote = One parent, Nicole Hollenbeck told The Rockingham News in June, My child has had sleepless nights, crying before bed because she's afraid that she'll sleep walk and relive the tragic events they talked about in class [...] We teach our kids right from wrong, and this is what they are being taught? }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2013, Michael "Thingyman" Harders founded the Game of Mafia Champions, an invitation-only series in which players from multiple internet communities play in a series of mafia games, culminating in a final game, where the best player of the year is determined. The series was first hosted on [[Two Plus Two Publishing|Two Plus Two Poker Forums']] Puzzles and Other Games section and has since been moved to Mafia Universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.mafiauniverse.net/ | title = Mafia Universe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mafia was called one of the 50 most historically and culturally significant games published since 1890 by [[about.com]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://boardgames.about.com/cs/gamehistories/a/timeline.htm | title = Board and Card Games Timeline | first = Erik | last = Arneson }}.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Les Loups-garous 1.JPG|thumb|The game of ''Mafia'' is run by a moderator or narrator, who hands each player a card secretly signifying their identity in the game]]
In its simplest form, Mafia is played by two teams: the mafia and the innocents. Live games require a moderator who does not participate as a player, and identities are assigned by handing out cards. At the start of the game, every mafioso is given the identities of their teammates, whereas the innocents only receive the number of mafioso in the game, and do not know which players are mafia and which are innocents.

There are two phases: ''night'' and ''day''. At night, certain players secretly perform special actions; during day, players discuss and vote to "lynch", or eliminate, one player. These phases alternate with each other until all mafiosi have been eliminated or until the mafia outnumbers the innocents.

Some players may be given roles with special abilities. Common special roles include:

* ''detective'' — an innocent who may learn the team of one player every night;
* ''doctor'' — an innocent who may protect a player from being killed every night, but can only do so once in each game;
* ''barman'' — a mafioso who may anonymously cancel the effect of another role's ability every night

Andrew Plotkin recommends having exactly two mafiosi,&lt;ref name="zarf"/&gt; whereas the original Davidoff rules suggest a third of the players (rounding to the nearest whole number) be mafiosi. Davidoff's original game does not include roles with special abilities.&lt;ref name="davidoff"&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/19990302082118/http://members.theglobe.com/mafia_rules/&lt;/ref&gt; In his rules for "Werewolf", Plotkin recommends that the first phase be day and that there be an odd number of players. These specifications prevent players from being killed before the first day and in most scenarios ensure that the game will end dramatically on a lynching rather than with an anticlimactic murder.&lt;ref name="zarf"/&gt;

===Night===
All players close their eyes. The moderator then instructs all members of the mafia to open their eyes and acknowledge their accomplices. The mafia members pick a "victim" by silently gesturing to indicate their target and to show [[unanimity]] then close their eyes again.

A similar process occurs for other roles with nightly actions. In the case of the detective, the moderator may indicate the target's innocence or guilt by using gestures such as nodding or head shaking.

Night may be accompanied by players tapping gently to mask sounds made by gesturing.&lt;ref name="wunderland"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.wunderland.com/LooneyLabs/Werewolf/Rules.html |publisher= [[Looney Labs]] |accessdate=2010-06-15 |title= Are You A Werewolf? Rules of Play |quote= Night-Noise: When everyone closes their eyes at night, it is best for people to also start humming, tapping the table, patting a knee, or making some noise. This will cover up any sounds made accidentally by the werewolves, the seer, or the moderator}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Day===

[[File:BarCampBournemouth 3 Werewolf.jpg|thumb|During the "day" phase, players vote on who to lynch]]
The moderator instructs players to open their eyes and announces who "died" the previous night. Discussion ensues among the living players. At any point, a player may accuse someone of being a mafioso and prompt others to vote to lynch them. If over half of the players do so, the accused person is eliminated and night begins. Otherwise, the phase continues until a lynching occurs.&lt;ref name=zarf/&gt;

According to some rules, the role of dead players are revealed; according to others, it is not.&lt;ref name=zarf2/&gt;&lt;ref name="wunderland"/&gt; In both cases, dead players are not permitted to attempt to influence the remainder of the game.

Because players have more freedom to deliberate, days tend to be longer than nights.

==Game theory==

===Mathematical study===
Mafia is a complicated game to model, so most analyses of optimal play have assumed both (a) that there are only townsfolk and mafiosi and (b) that the townsfolk never have a probability of identifying the Mafia that is better than chance. Early treatment of the game concentrated on [[Monte Carlo method#Optimization|simulation]],&lt;ref&gt;For example: {{cite web |quote=If we figure that 9 or 11 players is ideal for a two-wolf game, and we assume that these probabilities actually means anything (heh heh), then an ideal game has a human-win chance of 0.23 to 0.29. (Again, for completely stupid humans.) |title= Werewolf Statistics |url= http://www.eblong.com/zarf/werewolf-stats.html |first= A. |last= Plotkin}}&lt;/ref&gt; while more recent studies have tried to derive closed-form equilibrium solutions for perfect play.

In 2006, the computer scientists Braverman, Etesami and Mossel proved that without detectives and with [[homo economicus|perfect players]] the randomized strategy is [[Nash equilibrium|optimal for both citizens and mafia]]. [[Asymptotic analysis|When there is a large enough number]] of players to give both groups similar probability of winning, they showed that the initial number of mafiosi ''m'' needs to be proportional to the square root of the total number of players ''P'', that is &lt;math&gt;{\textstyle m \propto \sqrt{P}}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=Mossel2008&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Annals of Applied Probability |first1= M. |last1= Braverman |first2= O. |last2= Etesami |first3= E. |last3= Mossel |url= http://projecteuclid.org/DPubS?verb=Display&amp;version=1.0&amp;service=UI&amp;handle=euclid.aoap/1211819786&amp;page=record |title= Mafia: A Theoretical Study of Players and Coalitions in a Partial Information Environment |volume= 18 |issue= 2 |year= 2008 |bibcode= 2006math......9534B |pages= 825–846 |arxiv= math/0609534 &lt;!--|class=math.PR--&gt; |doi= 10.1214/07-AAP456 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120316141443/http://projecteuclid.org/DPubS?verb=Display&amp;version=1.0&amp;service=UI&amp;handle=euclid.aoap%2F1211819786&amp;page=record |archivedate= 2012-03-16 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; With a simulation, they confirmed that 50 mafiosi would have almost a 50% chance to win among 10,000. The Mafia's chance of victory is

&lt;math&gt; W(m, P) \approx \frac{m}{\sqrt{P}},&lt;/math&gt;

which is a good approximation when the right hand side is below 40%. If any detectives are added to the game, Braverman et al. proved that the number of mafiosi must remain at a [[Linear equation#Linear equations in two variables|fixed proportion]] of the total number of players for their chance of winning to remain constant.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;The single detective publishes a large list of innocents, and asks to be lynched to guarantee its veracity (under the standard rules in which the detective's role is revealed after she is killed, no strategic interference from the Mafia is possible): {{cite journal |journal=Annals of Applied Probability |first1= M. |last1= Braverman |first2= O. |last2= Etesami |first3= E. |last3= Mossel |arxiv= math/0609534 |title= Mafia: A Theoretical Study of Players and Coalitions in a Partial Information Environment |volume= 18 |issue= 3 |year= 2008 |page = 12 |bibcode=2006math......9534B |doi=10.1214/07-aap456}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Erlin Yao derived specific analytical bounds for the mafia's win probability when there are no detectives.&lt;ref name=Yao&gt;Derivation is by recursion on decreasing numbers of players in the following round, see: {{cite web |format= [https://arxiv.org/abs/0804.0071 pdf] |url= http://cdsweb.cern.ch/record/1096965/?ln=fr |chapterurl= |title= A Theoretical Study of Mafia Games |last= Yao |first= E.|page= 7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a paper&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |eprint= 1009.1031 |title= A mathematical model of the Mafia game |last= Migdał |first= Piotr |class= math.PR |year= 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; from 2010, exact formula for the probability that the mafia wins was found. Moreover, it was shown that the [[Parity (mathematics)|parity]] of the initial number of players plays an important role. In particular, when the number of mafiosi is fixed and an odd player is added to the game (and ties are resolved by [[Coin flipping|coin flips]]), the mafia-winning chance do not drop but rise by a factor of approx. &lt;math&gt; \sqrt{\pi/2}&lt;/math&gt; (equality in the [[Limit (mathematics)|limit]] of the infinite number of players).

===Results in live play===
In live (or [[videoconference]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Testing the technology: playing games with video conferencing Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems |isbn= 978-1-59593-593-9 |journal= Proceedings of the SIGCHI conference on Human factors in computing systems |year= 2007 table of contents |doi= 10.1145/1240624.1240751 |last1= Batcheller |first1= Archer L. |last2= Hilligoss |first2= Brian |last3= Nam |first3= Kevin |last4= Rader |first4= Emilee |last5= Rey-Babarro |first5= Marta |last6= Zhou |first6= Xiaomu |pages= 849}}&lt;/ref&gt;) real-time play, the innocents typically win more often than [[game theory]] suggests. Several reasons for this have been advanced:
* The physiological stress of sustained lying degrades the initial ability of mafioso to deceive the innocents, much more than a model of [[mixed strategy|perfect play]] would predict, especially if the innocents can get the town emotionally involved in the game's outcome:
{{quote |text='' If you're trying to feign shock or anger, it's much harder to do over a long period. People accused of something they're trying to hide will start out feigning outrage – 'How dare you ask me that?' But that will start to change to objection rather than shock, as it's psychologically very difficult to mimic emotion.'' |source= [[Wired (magazine)|Wired UK]]&lt;ref name=wired2010/&gt; |sign= Dr Simon Moore}}
* The information revealed by the mafiosi voting patterns tells against them later in the game. One of the game's fans [[Aardvark (search engine)#History|Max Ventilla]], has said that "If the villagers are allowed to keep a pencil and paper, they always win."&lt;ref name=Ventilla&gt;{{cite web |title= Why do young techies want to be werewolves? |first1= C |last1= McCarthy |date= 2009-04-24 |publisher= [[CNET News#CNET News|CNET News]] |url= http://news.cnet.com/8301-13577_3-10225896-36.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* As players get more experienced, their strategic sophistication and ability to spot and use deception [[learning|increases]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= [[Vice Magazine]] |title= Mafia Party EXTRA TIPS |date= June 2005 |first= D. |last= Cross |authorlink= David Cross |url= http://www.viceland.com/int/v12n5/htdocs/mafia.php |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20081120085327/http://www.viceland.com/int/v12n5/htdocs/mafia.php |dead-url= yes |archive-date= 2008-11-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They will typically get better at the skills needed for playing innocents faster, being villagers more often than mafiosi.
* The [[Metagame]] aspect: Dimma Davidoff has said, Past connections will always lose to future collaborations.&lt;ref name=wired2010/&gt; When playing [[Repeated game|several]] Mafia games with the same people, it's more helpful to be known for [[honesty]] than for deceit. Davidoff considers that so important that he thinks the advantages of playing the mafioso role honestly, outweigh the disadvantages.

But, the Mafia ''can'' win in live play; their best chance of winning occurs when mafioso [[Human bonding|bond]] with their innocent [[Propinquity#Propinquity effect|neighbours]] and convince those neighbours to value that bond over dispassionate analysis.&lt;ref name=Ventilla/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |quote= the emotional authenticity of the alliances, the felt pleasure of trusting another, is startlingly, frighteningly real. You and George against the Mafia – but then the quick nightly shadow intrudes: What if George ''is'' the Mafia? Yet the proper suspicions, though they rise, rarely override these instant bonds. |title = Through the Children's Gate: A Home in New York | first = Adam | last = Gopnik | year = 2006 |isbn = 978-0-676-97827-8 |page= 245}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game designers Salen and Zimmerman have written that the deep [[Emergent gameplay|emergent]] social game play in Mafia (combined with the fear of elimination) create ideal conditions for this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Rules of play: game design fundamentals |first1= K |last1= Salen |first2= E. |last2= Zimmerman |pages= 468–469 |publisher= MIT Press |edition= illustrated |date=October 2003 |isbn= 978-0-262-24045-1}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Optional roles==
{{refimprovesect|Role names need to be cited to where they appear|date=November 2017}}
These additional roles are named differently in the many versions of Mafia, for [[Setting (fiction)|thematic flavor]], or historical reasons. Also, the same role-name can have differing functions across different versions of the game.&lt;ref name="Sorcerer"&gt;For example, [[Bezier Games]]' Ultimate Werewolf [http://gamerhotsheet.com/2007/03/ultimate-werewolf-complete-cardset-now-available/ ''Sorcerer'']{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} has the ability to detect the Seer role. (The sorcerer is granted different powers in other rule-sets, like Princeton University's, in which the Wizard has the ability to detect the Seer.) Whatever name this role is known by, the Detective-detector is typically aligned with the Mafia (for example, see: {{cite web | url= http://boredgamegeeks.blogspot.com/2005/09/9-player-werewolf.html | title= 9 Player Werewolf Evil team | year= 2005 }})&lt;/ref&gt; What follows is a general list of role ''types'' found in Mafia variants; since the specific names vary by [[Social environment|milieu]] it must be non-exhaustive.
&lt;!--
Please read this list before adding new characters to it to prevent duplication.
--&gt;

===Investigative roles===
Players with these roles use their own night-phase to discover something about other players. Though the standard game now includes the basic Detective, these roles are optional, and games can exclude them entirely (such as the stool pigeon variant, or Davidoff's original rules).

====Investigative roles (standard)====
* —''Detective'', ''Seer'', ''Commandant'',&lt;ref name=Gopnik&gt;{{cite book|chapter= Fourth Thanksgiving: Propensities |title = Through the Children's Gate: A Home in New York | first = Adam | last = Gopnik | year = 2006 |isbn = 978-0-676-97827-8 |pages= 242–253}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Sheriff'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.puzzlers.org/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=gamerules:mafia | title = Mafia (con) | quote = Knight Commandant / Sheriff – a townsperson who investigates mafia members | accessdate = 2007-12-20 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071118105651/http://www.puzzlers.org/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=gamerules:mafia | archive-date = 2007-11-18 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; etc.
: Allied with the Innocents, the [[Detective]] can detect whether a player is a mafioso. They will typically wake up, and point at one person; the Narrator will silently indicate to the Detective whether that player is Mafia or Innocent. In some versions of the game, the Detective's investigation result is announced publicly by the Narrator, for example ''the Detective found a Mafioso!''. More commonly, no announcement is made. As with other roles, which player is the detective is not generally known, leaving anyone the option of pretending to be the Detective.
: A Detective is usually included in modern games. For example, somebody is ''always'' assigned this role in all commercial [[card game]] versions,&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;As of November 2007, five card-based versions of this game are sold, and all require one player to become a Seer. The {{cite web | url = http://www.toyvault.com/cthulhugame/Cthulhu%20Game%20Instructions%20Front.jpg| title = Do you worship Cthulhu ''Deck Setup''}} specifies that a Seer card be dealt to someone even with the (minimum) five players. Similarly, the ''Lupus in Tabula'' Preparation calls for the Seer card to be dealt to somebody even if the game is played with the minimum number of players (eight). Getting Started with ''Ultimate Werewolf'' Role Selection advises that even the introductory game should include the Seer (with further optional roles being added ''in addition to the seer'' in later games). ''Werewolves of Millers hollow'' uses the Fortune Teller name for the Detective but the role is identical to the standard seer/angel/detective, and is again mandatory, having its own phase of the night in the basic rules. (As does the Seer in ''Are You a Werewolf?'' – though it is after the werewolves' phase.)&lt;/ref&gt; and almost all internet-based, and most face-to-face games start with at least one detective.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;For example, {{cite web | url = http://web.mit.edu/ceu/www/spielregeln_eng.html | title = The Mafia rules (MIT) }}, from [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], are very simple, and specify roles for 7–20 players, always including at least one Detective. Andrew Plotkin's original ''Werewolf'' always includes a Villager (Seer), and he mentions that in 1997 Mafia was played in the [[National Puzzlers' League]] convention with a Knight Commandant. (The role of the Knight Commandant or Knight is described in detail as having the standard Detective powers in: {{cite web | url = http://www.puzzlers.org/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=cons:1997:conreport1997 | title = National Puzzlers' League – 1997 Convention Reports | accessdate = 2007-11-24 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071208204055/http://www.puzzlers.org/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=cons:1997:conreport1997 | archive-date = 2007-12-08 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}) Plotkin describes [https://web.archive.org/web/19990302082118/http://members.theglobe.com/mafia_rules/ Davidoff's original game] (which had [http://fringe.davesource.com/Fringe/Entertainment/Games/Indoors/Mafia/v23.htm no Detective]) as well off the current average. A rare modern rule-set with No [[Inspector]] is: {{cite web | title = The Game ''Player Constellations'' | url = http://org.ntnu.no/mafia/ | first = Vegard | last = Engstrom | year = 1999 | accessdate = 2010-06-15 }} but only when starting with five, larger groups get at least one inspector.&lt;/ref&gt; Multiple detectives either act in separate night phases (unaware of the identities of other detectives)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= [[Vice Magazine]] |title= Mafia Party THE SETUP |date= June 2005 |first= D. |last= Cross |authorlink= David Cross |url= http://www.viceland.com/int/v12n5/htdocs/mafia.php |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081120085327/http://www.viceland.com/int/v12n5/htdocs/mafia.php |archivedate= 2008-11-20 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; or work together as the police (an [[#Association roles|association role]]).

====Investigative roles (less common)====
* —''Psychic'', ''Wizard'', ''Fortune Teller'', ''Oracle'', ''Tracker, Watcher,'' etc.
: [[Psychic]], Psychologist, or Sorcerer-type investigators can determine other players' roles, rather than their alignments.&lt;ref name=Sorcerer /&gt; Roles which detect other roles are usually implemented in the same way as the Detective's ability to determine alignment. For example: the [[Psychologist]] points to a player (at night) for a Thumbs-up from the moderator if the Vigilante is pointed to.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;For example, Vigilante in the {{cite web | url = http://fringe.davesource.com/Fringe/Entertainment/Games/Indoors/Mafia/v26.htm| title = Princeton rules}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Tracker may see what someone's night action was, or the target of their action, while a Watcher may see all those who visited someone at night.
: Information revealed to investigators is fallible (in more complicated variants). Online versions can give information with a [[probability|confidence]] level, and in other variants the Narrator deceives the Detective by showing all players as Innocent, all as Guilty, giving reversed results, or random information (these can be termed as Naive,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.sitesled.com/members/mikeburnfire/mafiascum04.swf | title = Name: Naive Cop | quote = Description: A type of cop that always gets innocent results regardless of who they investigate | accessdate = 2007-12-16 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070227221131/http://www.sitesled.com/members/mikeburnfire/mafiascum04.swf | archivedate = 2007-02-27 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Paranoid, Insane, or Random respectively). Additionally, some Alignment roles give immunity to successful investigation.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;For example, The Oracle in Werewolf chooses one person to investigate every night, and are shown their card, unless they pick the Master Werewolf – when the Oracle is shown an (innocent) villager card.&lt;/ref&gt;
: In some games, there are Mafia Detectives, who have the power of a normal detective but are on the Mafia side. The Super Commandant has the standard power of a Detective, while also protecting the ''investigated'' from night-time attack.

===Omniscient roles===
* —''Witness'', ''Child'', ''Little Girl'', etc.
: Instead of having to investigate, some innocent roles give complete information on the entire mafia: The [[witness]] is told who the mafia are during the first night, while the mafia are not told the witness's identity (differing from the stool pigeon in not being a part of the mafia). 
: The Little Girl in ''Werewolf'' and ''Werewolves of Miller's Hollow'' is allowed to secretly peek and watch as the werewolves choose their victim; if discovered doing so by the Werewolves, she dies of fright.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;For example, as described on Ultimate Werewolf's ''Little Girl'' Card, and in the first non-introductory role [https://www.wired.co.uk/article/werewolf-extra-materials suggested by ''Wired'']: The Child spies at night when the werewolves are killing, and only when the werewolves are killing, by opening her eyes ever so slightly&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protective roles===
* —''Guardian Angel'', ''Doctor'', ''Bodyguard'', ''Hero, Jailer'', etc.
: Allied with the Innocents, the Doctor-type role defends others at night.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;Depending on the variant, they may know the identities of the Mafia, but this isn't required; they usually indicate the player to protect in a separate phase of gameplay (a separate part of the night) than the Mafia's killing phase. The Mafia-Doctor ''is'' a mafioso, and a more obscure variant role, with the opposite power (from the Doctor) of protecting the guilty from attack during the day.&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, they will awaken at night after the Mafia have gone back to sleep and point at one person to protect; that person will survive any night-time attack.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;The protected player gains complete invulnerability during the night they are visited by the Doctor or [[Bodyguard]]. The Mafia do not usually know the identity of the protected player, nor get a chance to select another victim, so this attack is wasted if the Mafia target a protected player (e.g., {{cite web | url = http://www.davincigames.it/download/LupusInTabula_rules.zip | title = Bodyguard, Lupus in Tabula | accessdate = 2007-11-13 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20051224043920/http://www.davincigames.it/download/LupusInTabula_rules.zip | archivedate = 2005-12-24 | df =  }}).&lt;/ref&gt; They are typically allowed to protect themselves, and are commonly barred from protecting the same target on successive nights.&lt;ref name=NM&gt;{{cite web| title= Characters from the New Moon expansion set |accessdate= 2010-06-13 |url= https://www.wired.co.uk/article/werewolf-extra-materials |year= 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Guardian Angel can only protect others. The Nurse gains the Doctor's abilities if the Doctor dies.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;For example, see the [[Two Plus Two Publishing|2+2]] rule-set describing the Nurse: {{cite web | url = http://forumserver.twoplustwo.com/showflat.php?Cat=0&amp;Number=5547619&amp;an=0&amp;page=2 | title = Mafia rules}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jailer protects innocents just like the doctor, but also simultaneously blocks their night action. The Firefighter,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://mikeburnfire.sitesled.com/mscumB.swf | title = Various Mafia Roles: Third Party Roles: Arsonist &amp; Firefighter | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070220101055/http://mikeburnfire.sitesled.com/mscumB.swf | archivedate = 2007-02-20 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; or the [[Herbalist]] can protect from some night-time attacks but not others (in Werewolf, for example, they choose one person to protect with [[Aconitum#Aconitum in literature|wolfsbane]], but that person may still be killed by the Serial Killer). Other games limit this ability to a certain number of times.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;For example, the Witch in ''Werewolves of Miller's Hollow'' has only one use of her protective potion. She is allowed to see who was killed by the werewolves before applying the protective potion, so this character is more typical of the [[#Reanimation roles|reanimation]] than the protective type.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Killing roles===
* —''Vigilante'', ''Veteran,'' ''Hunter'', ''Bomb'', ''Woodcutter'', etc.
: Aside from Mafia, Werewolves, and Serial Killers (solitary guilty parties), the Innocents may have some roles with the ability to kill at night. The [[Vigilante]] is an innocent who kills every night, in their own night-time phase,&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.toyvault.com/cthulhugame/Cthulhu%20Game%20Instructions%20Back.jpg | title = Do you worship Cthulu ''Roles'' and ''Quick Reference Script'' | accessdate = 2007-11-21}}. This makes the vigilante as lethal as the entire Mafia, potentially overbalancing the game, which has led to the introduction of roles that limit his effectiveness, such as the ''Walrus'' role-blocker.&lt;/ref&gt; in some variations, having a limited bullet supply for the entire game. Some variations introduce a time limit of two nights before the player in the Killing Role can exercise their right to kill again or the trait that if they kill an innocent they either lose the ability to kill or die from guilt the next night. In the case of the Veteran, they may use their ability (a finite number of times, usually 3) in which anyone who targets them (friend or foe) will be killed. The Bomb may only trigger if targeted at night (not necessarily for death) by another role. Variants exist where this person can kill during the daytime cycle (e.g., the Terrorist / Gravedigger), sometimes only if executed during the daytime. The Woodcutter or [[Hunter]] can take one other person with them whenever they die.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;The Hunter appears in ''Werewolves of Miller's Hollow'', for example. The Woodcutter is a (less common) [[Little Red Riding Hood|equivalent]] name for the role. ''Wired'' recommends including the hunter in even the most basic games: {{cite web| title= Original Werewolf characters |accessdate= 2010-06-13 |url= https://www.wired.co.uk/article/werewolf-extra-materials |date=January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alignment roles===
* —''Miller'', ''Godfather'', ''Alpha Wolf'', ''Wildcard'', etc.
: Some roles can fool [[#Investigative roles (standard)|investigations to determine their alignments]]: the Miller is an Innocent who appears guilty (usually because they are an outsider); the Godfather, on the other hand, appears innocent despite being the Mafia leader.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;The Godfather role is played differently between variants. If immunity to detection is the Godfather's only power, his leadership of the Mafia need only be nominal: {{cite web | url =http://www.sitesled.com/members/mikeburnfire/mafiascum04.swf | title =Name: Godfather | deadurl =yes | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20070227221131/http://www.sitesled.com/members/mikeburnfire/mafiascum04.swf | archivedate =2007-02-27 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Alpha Wolf or Master Werewolf have the same role as the Godfather in ''Werewolf'' settings.

===Double-agent roles===
* —''Traitor'', ''Possessed'', ''Undercover Cop'', ''Godfather'', etc.
: The Traitor is not a mafioso (in that he does not awake at night and is not revealed as a mafioso by Detective type roles), but works to protect them and hamper the town during the day cycle, and wins only with a Mafia victory.&lt;ref&gt;A typical Traitor-type role is the [[Spirit possession|Possessed]] ''Special Character'' from {{cite web | url = http://www.davincigames.it/download/LupusInTabula_rules.zip | title = The LUPUS IN TABULA (2nd edition) rules | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20051224043920/http://www.davincigames.it/download/LupusInTabula_rules.zip | archivedate = 2005-12-24 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, the Undercover Cop is a [[Mole (espionage)|mole]] within the Mafia group who acts with the Mafia but wins with the innocents. The stool pigeon may be the only optional role in play,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= The Johns Hopkins News-Letter |date= 2001-10-26 |url= http://media.www.jhunewsletter.com/media/storage/paper932/news/2001/10/26/Focus/Mafia.Game.Indulges.Fantasy.Avoids.Jail.Term-2247440.shtml |title= Mafia game indulges fantasy, avoids jail term |first= L. |last= Fraade-Blanar |quote= One person out of the circle finds themselves tapped twice, making them the [[stool pigeon]]. He must inform the townspeople, i.e. everyone who was not tapped, of the identity of the Mafia members while not being killed himself... The game shows a historical conflict between the accusers and the accused. It could well be the [[Witch trials in Early Modern Europe|Europeans accusing witches]] }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and makes up one of the few modern game forms to be played without an investigative role.
:Distinct from the alignment-role Godfather, the double-agent Godfather behaves as a standard mafioso, but wakes again (after the Mafia sleep) to perform an extra kill. This Godfather-role wins only if he survives.

===Role manipulators===
* —''Role-blocker'', ''Bus Driver'', ''Thief'', ''Barman'', ''Witch,'' etc.
: These roles can stop or alter the night actions of others; for instance, they may prevent a protection or investigation from occurring, or they may change the target&lt;ref&gt;The Witch for example has this ability in [[Bézier Games|Bezier]]'s game "Ultimate WereWolf"&lt;/ref&gt;. The Role-blocker can block the Vigilante for a night, while the Thief, Prostitute or Hypnotizer might be able to disable the powers of any selected target.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;The [[thief]]'s action usually applies for a single night, as in: {{cite web | url = http://users.wpi.edu/~tachase/mafiairc.html | title = Mafia Game: IRC Version | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071215001810/http://users.wpi.edu/~tachase/mafiairc.html | archivedate = 2007-12-15 | df =  }}. The thief sometimes has a purely investigative function – being only able to determine the roles from stolen items.{{cite web | url = http://www.sitesled.com/members/mikeburnfire/mafiascum04.swf | title = Thief | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070227221131/http://www.sitesled.com/members/mikeburnfire/mafiascum04.swf | archivedate = 2007-02-27 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
: When the thief is used in ''Werewolves'', an additional townsfolk card is added before dealing, and the Thief may choose on the first night to steal the role of another player or to take the unused role card. The player whose role was stolen gets the unused role card and the Thief card is discarded.

===Recruitment roles===
* —''Godfather'', ''Psychiatrist'', ''Piper'', ''Cult Leader'', etc.
: The Mafia [[Boss (crime)|Godfather]] may be able to recruit innocent players into their faction under certain circumstances. The [[Yakuza]] is a regular mafia player with an extra power: they may sacrifice themselves from the second night (during the night) and choose an innocent to join the mafia.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://7-0-7.co.uk/Miscellaneous/MafiaRules.pdf |title= Mafia: Advanced rules |first= J. |last= Bennet |format= PDF |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110810215310/http://7-0-7.co.uk/Miscellaneous/MafiaRules.pdf |archivedate= 2011-08-10 |df=  }} In other variants, the mafia can't kill anyone else on the night this power is used. The potential existence of a Yakuza makes innocents with protective roles less inclined to reveal their roles for fear of being converted (or more inclined to reveal themselves if they expect the Mafia to win and wish to be converted).&lt;/ref&gt;
: Each night, the [[scientist]] selects a player to [[Werewolf#Remedies|cure]]; if a mafioso is cured, they awaken as an innocent.&lt;ref name=WC/&gt; The [[Psychiatrist]] is an innocent with the ability to convert the [[Serial Killer]] into a normal innocent.&lt;ref&gt;The Psychiatrist can 'cure' the Serial Killer according to the Pub Game rules: {{cite web | url = http://www.dslreports.com/faq/15594 | title = Serial Killer }}. When 'the psychiatrist' is in play, the Serial Killer may be The [[Psychopath]], as in: {{cite web | url = http://www.sitesled.com/members/mikeburnfire/mafiascum04.swf | title = Name: Psychiatrist (Various Mafia Roles: ''Third Party'' at MafiaScum.net) | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070227221131/http://www.sitesled.com/members/mikeburnfire/mafiascum04.swf | archivedate = 2007-02-27 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
: [[Cult|Cult Leaders]] recruit followers at night instead of kill; they act as an independent faction, usually with the ability to talk at night. The [[Pied Piper of Hamelin in popular culture|Piper]] wins by charming every surviving player; she charms players at night, who then know each other (but not the piper) but are otherwise unaffected.&lt;ref name=NM/&gt;

===Association roles===
* —''Freemasons (Masons)'', ''Siblings'', ''Lovers'', ''Police'', etc.
: Possessors of these roles know one another and what their roles are.&lt;ref&gt;For example, [http://gamerhotsheet.com/2007/03/ultimate-werewolf-complete-cardset-now-available/ Ultimate Werewolf Masons]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} recognize one another from the first night.&lt;/ref&gt; On the innocent's side, a [[Freemason|Mason]] usually has no special abilities, but knows the identity of all other Masons and that all Masons are also innocent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Big Book of Rules  |last= Spadaccini |first= S. |date=September 2005 |isbn= 978-0-452-28644-3 |publisher= Plume }}&lt;/ref&gt; Every member of the detectives or the [[Criminal investigation|police]] knows all the rest, because they collaborate at night to investigate someone (sharing the powers of the Detective role between them).&lt;ref&gt;As in the Mafia Games setup described by group-games.com, requiring only mafiosi, police, a doctor, and the townspeople. Or, a simple version using only citizens, mafia, and ''detectives'', as described in: {{cite book |title= Great Games! |last= Toone |first= M. |date=July 2009 |isbn= 978-0-9798345-5-4 |publisher= MVT Games |page= 41 |quote= The ''detectives'' now guess who they think might be one of the ''Mafia'' -no talking allowed, they simply point to one person.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: [[Sibling]] pairs typically consist of one Mafia and one Innocent; in most versions, if one is killed, the other also dies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= Wired Magazine Issue Selected articles from 03.10 &gt; Werewolf &gt; Werewolf: Extra Materials |accessdate= 2010-06-13 |url= https://www.wired.co.uk/article/werewolf-extra-materials |quote= ''Optional rule:'' if the Lovers die and Cupid is still alive, Cupid chooses a new set of lovers.}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Cupid]] in ''Werewolves'' chooses a pair of Lovers on the first night.&lt;ref&gt;The ''Cupid card'' in [http://games.bezier.com Bezier Game's] ''Ultimate Werewolf'', for example.&lt;/ref&gt; In this variant, the Lovers can also win the game (regardless of whether they are Mafia, Innocents, or both) by being the last two standing.

===Election roles===
* —''Doublevoter'', ''Priest'', ''Rabble Rouser'', ''Lawyer'', etc.
: Until the [[wikt:rabble rouser|Rabble Rouser]] dies there are two lynchings per day.&lt;ref name=NM/&gt;
: In some games there are players who can change the vote count. Some players have 2 votes (Doublevoter); some players can only cast the final vote to kill a player (Actor); cannot vote to lynch (Voteless Innocent);&lt;ref&gt;Alternatively, they may have a vote, but be mandated to always vote against lynching, as is the [http://gamerhotsheet.com/2007/03/ultimate-werewolf-complete-cardset-now-available/ Village Ethicist]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; must delegate someone else to vote for them (Fool),&lt;ref name=Extras/&gt; or require one fewer vote to lynch (Hated Innocent). The Priest cannot place the final vote (this role is not necessarily the same as the Reanimation-role priest). The ''[[lawyer]]'' selects someone during the night, and if that person tops the lynching vote the next day, saves them (a different ''lawyer'' role releases the [[Will (law)|wills]] written by players killed up to that point, when she dies).&lt;ref name=Extras&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.wired.co.uk/article/werewolf-extra-materials |title= Werewolf: Extra Materials |date= 2010-01-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Public roles====
* —''Mayor'', ''Judge'', ''Sheriff'', ''President'', etc.
: This role is taken in addition to the assigned role, and it endows the player with additional, [[Openness|overt]], powers (particularly during the daytime). Empowerment can be random, but is usually made by vote. For instance, the Mayor or Sheriff can be elected each morning, and gain two lynching votes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.wired.co.uk/article/werewolf-extra-materials |title= Character references |accessdate= 2010-06-14 |date= 2010-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a Judge could moderate discussion in [[parliamentary procedure|parliamentary]] fashion (to the advantage of their team). The elected [[President]] has the sole lynching vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =http://www.mafiaspiel.de/ | title = Mafia variant: ''President'' }} described by MafiaSpiel.de, for example.&lt;/ref&gt;
In ''Town of Salem'', a version of Mafia,  the Sheriff is a role which can interrogate people at night, and get to know their role. The Godfather and the Arsonist are immune to the detection of a Sheriff, and the Framer can frame a player to make them appear as a mafioso.

===Handicapped roles===
* —''Murr'', ''Drunk'', ''Village Idiot'', ''Teenage Werewolf'', etc.
: This may be a secondary role, taken in addition to the assigned role. However, it has the opposite effect, giving the bearer a handicap, like speaking only [[gibberish]] in the case of the Village Drunk, etc.
: Alternatively, it may be a standard role with a particular constraint, such as the [[I Was a Teenage Werewolf|teenage werewolf]], who must say the word werewolf at least once each day.&lt;ref&gt;A role introduced in [[Ted Alspach]]'s 2010 [[Ted Alspach#Game List|''Ultimate Werewolf: Classic Movie Monsters'']].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Handicapper roles===
* —''Silencer'', ''Dentist'', ''Prostitute'', ''Fog'', etc.
: The Dentist may select any other player at night, and prevent them speaking during the following day.&lt;ref name=NM/&gt; The Silencer is a mafioso with the identical power, except that they may not silence the same player on successive days. The silenced individual wakes in the morning and is immediately instructed not to talk until the end of the day. They can still raise their hand to vote in live games (although, if they were silenced by a prostitute, they are not allowed to vote).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.smogon.com/smog/issue5/mafia_roles |title= Common Mafia Roles |accessdate= 2010-06-14 }} – The Silencer is typically aligned with them and knows their identities, but (in some variants) in unknown to them, not participating in mafia killings.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-mortem roles===
* —''Dark Background'', ''Priest'', ''Medium'', ''Coroner'', etc.
: The dark background roles are [[wikt:vanilla|standard]] (mafia or innocent) except for revealing a deceptive alignment when killed. The [[Medical examiner|M.E.]] gathers information from the killings that can help the innocents, while the Priest learns about the alignment of the dead in the same way that the Detective learns about the living.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Priest]] alone knows whether the dead were innocent in the [[World Boardgaming Championships]] game described by Bruno Wolff in {{cite web | url = https://wolff.to/bruno/werewolf.html | title = Werewolf rules | accessdate = 2007-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Mediumship|Medium]] can interrogate dead players.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;The Medium function varies, for example see summarized '[[seance#Leader-assisted seances|Medium-enabled seance]]' rules from ''Werewolf'' at: {{cite web| url = http://boredgamegeeks.blogspot.com/2005/09/9-player-werewolf.html | title = boredgamegeeks | accessdate = 2007-11-14}}, as opposed to the ''Lupus in Tabula'' Medium, who alone can uncover the alignment of the deceased (see: {{cite web | url = http://www.davincigames.com/page.cfm?sez=01&amp;gioco=lit | title = Lupus in Tabula (English rules) ''Special Characters''}}).&lt;/ref&gt; While the [[coroner]] survives, the narrator will explain the means of death in all night kills.&lt;ref name=WC&gt;{{cite web| title= Characters |accessdate= 2010-06-13 |url= https://www.wired.co.uk/article/werewolf-extra-materials |date=January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reanimation roles===
* —''Reviver'', ''Governor'', ''Martyr'', ''Witch'', etc.
: Revivers and Master Revivers are able to [[resurrect]] dead players, Master Revivers can bring the revived into their association (e.g., the Masons: see Association roles). The players resurrected by a [[Necromancer]] are converted to the Necromancer's alignment; those revived by the [[Bokor|voodooist]] join a separate zombie group.&lt;ref name=WC/&gt; The Governor can [[Clemency|reprieve]] those killed during the daytime, as can the Martyr if he sacrifices himself. The Witch has a (single-use) [[Elixir|revival potion]]. At night, she's shown who will die in the morning, and can choose to save them.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;The Witch was introduced as a special character in ''The Werewolves of Millers Hollow'', where she also has a single-use killing potion. She may be able to revive herself with the "reanimation potion", see: [https://www.wired.co.uk/article/werewolf-extra-materials Original Werewolf characters]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rule-immune Roles===
* —''Bulletproof'', ''Oracle'', ''Elder'', etc.
: The Bulletproof innocent is [[Invulnerability|invulnerable]] at night,&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;The bulletproof effect typically applies to night-time killings and is usually temporary, for example, the'' Ultimate Werewolf'' Amulet of Protection ([[bulletproof vest]] equivalent) protects over only a single night. Rare optional roles do give permanent protection from mafia attack, such as the Lupus in Tabula [http://www.davincigames.it/download/LupusInTabula_rules.zip Werehamster] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051224043920/http://www.davincigames.it/download/LupusInTabula_rules.zip |date=2005-12-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; though usually with limits; for example, the Elder will survive the first night attack, but not the second.&lt;ref name=NM/&gt;
: The [[Oracle]] has an [[#Investigative roles|investigative role]] similar to a Seer but also has the power to talk when inactive (talking in a sleep phase is usually a rule infraction).

===Special roles===
* —''Baker, Chef,'' ''Village Idiot'', ''Cobbler'', etc.
: The baker is on the side of the innocents. During the night, the baker gives one player a loaf of bread, potentially revealing their identity. If the baker dies, the innocents have just three nights to dispose of the mafia, or the innocents [[starvation|starve]], and the mafia win. The Cobbler,&lt;ref name=NM/&gt; [[Village idiot|Village Idiot]], or Jester has the objective of convincing the town to kill them, or is required to vote in favor of all proposed lynchings. Sometimes, successful lynching of the Village Idiot results in the mafia being able to kill two people that night.

===Complicated roles===
Additional variations exist, sometimes with even more specialized or complicated abilities. There are many special roles, and many moderators design novel roles for each game. Some commercial variants ship with blank cards to allow this customization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rpg.net/reviews/archive/10/10583.phtml Lupus in Tabula (Werewolves at the Table) card listings]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variations==
The naming of various roles, factions, and other elements of play is theme-dependent and has limitless variation. Common alternative themes restyle the mafia as werewolves, cultists, assassins, or witches, with other roles being renamed appropriately.

Over the years, players have created Mafia variants that include additional rules. Some of these are listed here.

===Variations on the win conditions===
If there are as many mafiosi as innocents in the day-phase then a mafia victory is declared immediately, under the original Mafia rules. Other variants suspend this rule, and only declare the game after every member of one faction has been eliminated: this makes the game easier to explain, and to run.&lt;ref name=Toone42&gt;{{cite book |title= Great Games!: 175 Games &amp; Activities for Families, Groups &amp; Children |last= Toone |first= M. |date=July 2009 |isbn= 978-0-9798345-5-4 |publisher= MVT Games |page= 42 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Election variants===
Nominees for lynching may be allowed to make a speech in their own defense. Usually, each player must vote, can only vote once and cannot vote for themselves. But some variants have a more complicated process of selecting players to be executed. Davidoff's original 'Mafia' allowed multiple day-time executions (per day), each needing only a plurality to action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://members.theglobe.com/mafia_rules/ |title= The Original Mafia Rules |accessdate= 2010-06-15 |year=1999 |quote= Accusations may happen any number of times during the discussion...once in a while, someone should propose to have a Mafia Night. If the majority of the players who are still in the game agrees, the Night begins. |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/19990302082118/http://members.theglobe.com/mafia_rules/ |archivedate = 1999-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[voting system|Voting variants abound]], but any lynching usually requires an absolute majority of the electorate, or votes cast. So the voting is usually not by [[secret ballot]] for multiple candidates with the highest vote count eliminated; it is more usual for the voting to be openly resolved either by:
* A nomination or series of elections structured to ultimately offer a [[Two-round system|choice between two candidates]], or
* An option to lynch (or not lynch) one suspect (with a new suspect produced if the last one survives the vote).&lt;ref name=Toone42/&gt;

====Tied votes====
[[Split vote|Deadlocked elections]] can be resolved by lot&lt;ref name=Mossel2008/&gt; or by killing the player with the [[scapegoat]] special role.&lt;ref name=wired2010/&gt;

The special case of one mafioso and one innocent remaining can be decided randomly&lt;ref&gt;The random resolution is typical in academic models of Mafia. For example, see: {{cite arXiv |eprint= 0804.0071 |title= A Theoretical Study of Mafia Games |last= Yao |first= E.&lt;!--|class= math.PR--&gt; |year= 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; or be ruled a Mafia win—this is more usual in live play.&lt;ref name="one on one"&gt;That a single mafioso wins against a single surviving innocent in the day phase is a standard live-play rule, being a sub-case of the rule that a numerical equality is a Mafia victory&lt;/ref&gt;

====Optional lynch variant====
The Innocents can choose not to kill anybody during the day. Although commonly unsure of Mafia identities, the Innocents are more likely to randomly kill a mafioso than are the Mafia (at night). Therefore, not lynching anyone (even at random) will typically favor the Mafia.

However, when the number of survivors is even, No Kill may help the Innocents; for example, when three Innocents and one mafioso remain – generally called MYLO, or Mislynch and Lose due to the innocents' loss upon a lynch of their own&lt;ref name="one on one"/&gt; – voting for No Lynch gives a 1/3 chance of killing the mafioso the next day, rather than a 1/4 chance today (assuming [[Uniform distribution (discrete)|random]] lynching).

===Mafia killing methods===
Some variants require all Mafia members to choose the same victim independently for a kill to succeed. This can be achieved in the following ways:
* By waking the Mafia members up separately.&lt;ref&gt;The 'separate waking' method of designating victims is used in the official {{cite web |title = Mayday |url = http://www.interactivitiesink.com/minigames/mayday |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071113150015/http://interactivitiesink.com/minigames/mayday/ |archivedate = 2007-11-13 |df =  }} rules, for example. (This is a [[Soviet Union]]-themed variant with other expanded rules, released under [[Creative Commons]] licensing.)&lt;/ref&gt;
* By calling out the names of all surviving players and requiring surviving mafiosi to raise their hands when the name of the victim is called out. In this variant, the mafiosi only "wake up" (open their eyes) at the very beginning of the game when they identify each other. This variant also allows other roles to take their actions by simply raising their hands when their target's name is called out.
* By having them write their kills. Under this variant, Innocent players write the word 'honest' on a piece of paper; Mafia members write the name of a player for elimination. If all the mafia notes have the same name on them, that player is considered killed by the Mafia.
In some online versions of the game, a particular player (the Godfather or a designated mafioso) must send in the kill.

Another variant requires the night-time vote to be secret and unanimous, but allows multiple players to be added to the execution [[queue area|queue]] to ensure unanimity.

===Multiple families===
Multiple, independent groups of mafia or werewolves&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://fringe.davesource.com/Fringe/Entertainment/Games/Indoors/Mafia/v18.htm |title= Mafia and Werewolves |quote= Note – This variant was performed with great success on November 12, 1998}} – From the old Princeton variant rules.&lt;/ref&gt; act and win independently, giving faster game-play and the potential for cross-fire between the factions.

===Attributes===
In this variant, players are given two cards: the first contains their role, the second an attribute. Attributes were originally derived from roles that could apply to both Mafia and Innocent alignments such as ''Bulletproof'' (cannot be killed at night), ''Mayor'' (has two votes in the lynch), and ''Siamese Twins'' (more commonly known as Siblings or Lovers).&lt;ref&gt;7-0-7, Jon Bennett {{cite web | url= http://7-0-7.co.uk/Miscellaneous/MafiaRules.pdf | title= ''Mafia Advanced Rules'' | deadurl= yes | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110810215310/http://7-0-7.co.uk/Miscellaneous/MafiaRules.pdf | archivedate= 2011-08-10 | df=  }} Additional rules created by Jon Bennett, accepted in local Mafia circles.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quantum Werewolf===
This variant was developed by Steven Irrgang and used for a puzzle in the 2008 CISRA Puzzle Competition. The difference from a standard game of Mafia is that players are not initially assigned roles, but rather on each day are given the probabilities describing the game's current [[quantum state]]. Each player with a non-zero probability of being a seer or a werewolf performs the appropriate night actions (which may not be effective if it is later determined that the player did not have that role). When a player is killed, the [[wave function collapse]]s and the players are given updated probabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://puzzle.cisra.com.au/2008/quantumwerewolf.html |title=CISRA Puzzle Competition – Quantum Werewolf |publisher=Puzzle.cisra.com.au |year=2008 |accessdate=2009-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Train Mafia===
Traditional Mafia re-envisioned and heavily modified by the [[Copenhagen Game Collective]] to be played in a subway metro. In this variation, players who are 'lynched' are kicked off the train (at the next stop), and must wait in shame for the following train – a kind of 'afterlife' train – to join a second, interwoven game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.copenhagengamecollective.org/train-mafia/ |title=Train Mafia |publisher=Copenhagen Game Collective |date=2009-09-27 |accessdate=2011-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Invisible City: Rebels vs. Spies===
A [[location-based game|location-based mobile gaming]] variant for [[Android (operating system)|Android]], designed for [[city center]] play. The two factions are: the Rebels, the majority; and the Spies, the informed minority. The rule-set replaces expulsions with [[score (game)|scoring]] by round. Each player is assigned an individual mission each round. Some missions are critical and if one of those fails, the round goes to the Spies, but only one player knows which missions are critical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.invisiblecity.gr |title=Invisible City: Rebels vs. Spies | publisher=Human-Computer Interaction Group, [[University of Patras]], Greece |year=2011 |accessdate=2012-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===One Night Ultimate Werewolf===
{{main|Ultimate Werewolf}}
In this standalone game published by Bezier Games, players only "sleep" and close their eyes for a single night at the beginning of the game. They then have a single day of discussion, with a single lynching. No players are eliminated as the game progresses. There is no moderator, so everyone gets to participate as a member of the town or village. When playing this game, three more role cards are used than the number of players; when everyone is randomly dealt out their card the three extra ones placed in the middle of the table. To begin the game one of the players, with eyes closed, will act as the "caller" on the single starting night, going through the nighttime roles once: Werewolves and Masons (if in play) will identify each other, the Seer will examine one player's card or two of the middle cards, the Robber will steal another player's role card and replace it with their own, the Troublemaker will blindly swap two players' role cards, the Insomniac wakes up to check if their role card has been swapped, etc. The game ends on a single lynching vote, with the villagers winning if a single werewolf is caught, and the werewolves winning if no werewolves are killed. This game can be played with as few as three players. Play time can be as quick as five minutes per game&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/147949/one-night-ultimate-werewolf | title=One Night Ultimate Werewolf &amp;#x7C; Board Game &amp;#x7C; BoardGameGeek |accessdate=25 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Town of Salem===
This is an advanced version of Mafia that takes place during the [[Salem witch trials]]. It involves several different roles from multiple factions. Every single player is assigned a role. There are no "innocents" (people who have no special role but are aligned with the Town). Besides the Mafia and the Town, there is also a separate, "neutral" faction whose roles are usually not aligned with either faction and have their own goals. For example, the Executioner needs to get someone lynched during the day, the Jester's goal is to be hanged during the day (must convince the town they are an evil role), the Survivor must simply stay alive until the end of the game, and the Arsonist must  be the last person standing . &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://blankmediagames.com | title=Town of Salem |accessdate=20 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was recently updated to add a new faction: the Coven, which mainly consists of witches and is similar in function and goal to the more traditional Mafia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://blankmediagames.com/town-of-salem-the-coven-announcement/ | title=Town of Salem: The Coven announcement |accessdate=20 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Online play ==
Mafia can also be played online. Games can be played on [[IRC channel]]s, where a bot assumes the role of a game moderator and the interaction of players is conducted via textual communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = MAFIA - XKCD Wiki|url = http://wiki.xkcd.com/irc/MAFIA|website = wiki.xkcd.com|accessdate = 2015-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Being that IRC is not a widespread way of communication,{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} these Mafia games are restricted to limited number of people. Since 2008, many other Mafia game sites were formed. These sites are attempts at reproducing the live Mafia games, and the duration and the mechanics of the games are about the same as when the game is played traditionally.

Playing mafia-like games online opens a possibility long lasting games, such as the ones on forums. In such games, one day in real life usually corresponds to one day within the game, so players log in each morning to see who was killed during the night phase.

The online games have several advantages. There is no need to gather many people in the same room, so organizing and playing a game of Mafia is faster and more convenient. Removing the human moderator and the need for players to close their eyes removes the possibility of accidental reveals of information. Online play also allows role mechanics which would be too cumbersome to use in a physical version of the game.

A drawback of online play is the lack of direct face-to-face communication, which many consider the most important aspect of Mafia. Some sites organize Mafia games with web cams, so that the face-to-face communication is preserved. The long lasting online mafia games that are usually played via online forums do not necessarily have this drawback. It is merely a correlation that people who communicate via forums usually do not know each other in real life.

In a traditional Mafia game, all of the players are in one room. There is no way to communicate with another player in private. With online games, this is not the case. Many Mafia game forums and game sites have rules that mandate that only one channel of communication must be used for all game related discussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Epicmafia - Lobby|url = https://epicmafia.com/lobby/rules|website = epicmafia.com|accessdate = 2015-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus forbidding the use of alternative channels for discussing the game. These rules are obviously only declarative as there is no way of enforcing them efficiently. It is especially difficult to enforce such prohibiting rules during long games on players that communicate with each other in person in real life.  All forums support different kind of game setups, so it is feasible to organize a forum game without the restrictions on private messaging.

Private communication problem comes to light especially in trying to prevent "dead" players from participating in the game. Most online games consider this a breach of rules. Since, in general case, this breach of rules cannot be proven, the gameplay of most sites depends heavily on players' honesty and integrity.

There was real competition to win this particular jersey. Especially noted are the struggles between Sante Carollo and Luigi Malabrocca, to see who could waste the most time. Each tried to lose more time than the other by hiding in bars, barns, and behind hedges, or even by puncturing their own wheels. In 1948 the honor was awarded to the Tuscan [[Aldo Bini]], who according to some journalists and fans of the time, stubbornly continued the race until the end, despite a broken right hand suffered in a mass crash, and the suffering that especially in the mountain stages forced him to get off the bike and push it uphill. The special ability of the black jersey was, in addition to not being "discovered", to reach the finish directly within the maximum time.&lt;ref name="gazzetta1"/&gt;

The term "maglia nera" was later used in other contexts to indicate the bottom club in a league, often giving it a negative connotation. 

In 2008 a similar "black number"  was introduced, won by [[Markus Eichler]] of [[Team Milram]].

'''Mimpi''' is a video game developed by Czech company [[Silicon Jelly]]. It is a mix of an [[Adventure game|adventure]] [[Puzzle video game|puzzle]] and a [[platform game]].

The Sequel [[Mimpi Dreams]] was released in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://ahoooj.circusatos.com/presskit/index.php?l=cs&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
The game was announced in January 2013. The development started approximately in October 2012. Developers decided to fund the game on Indiegogo. The game was placed there in February but until March 4, it gained just 112 USD of 10,000 goal. Developers decided to finish the game anyway. The original release date was scheduled for March 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indiegogo.com/projects/mimpi-puzzle-platformer-adventure |title=Mimpi: puzzle platformer adventure |publisher=Indiegogo |date= |accessdate=February 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://games.tiscali.cz/oznameni/ceska-puzzle-plosinovka-mimpi-vas-zve-do-kouzleneho-sveta-61867 |title=Česká puzzle plošinovka Mimpi vás zve do kouzleného světa – GAMES.cz |publisher=Games.tiscali.cz |date=January 24, 2013 |accessdate=February 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most of the game was developed by designer Matěj Moravec. Programmers started their work when he finished first four levels. The music was done by company [[Sype Studios]]. In the course of development the game went through many changes. For example, it was longer and easier than planned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pocketgamer.biz/r/PG.Biz/Mimpi/feature.asp?c=55235 |title=Every dog has its day: The making of Mimpi &amp;#124; feature &amp;#124; Mimpi |publisher=PocketGamer.biz |date=November 13, 2013 |accessdate=February 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game was finished in October and developers found a publisher in [[Crescent Moon Games]]. IOS version was released on October 8. It was followed by OS X version on December 12. On December 19, a version for [[Android (operating system)|Android]] was released. The game was also Greenlighted for release on Steam. The Windows version was released on 20 January 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Eric Ford |url=http://toucharcade.com/2013/10/07/hands-on-with-mimpi-gorgeous-puzzle-platforming/ |title=Hands-On with 'Mimpi' – Gorgeous Puzzle Platforming |publisher=Touch Arcade |date=December 6, 2013 |accessdate=February 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
[[File:Mimpi Screenshot.jpg|250px|thumbnail|left|The game combines Platform and Adventure game. The Player controls Mimpi but also can interact with Environment similarly to [[Point and click]] [[Adventure game]]]]
Mimpi is played as a sidescrolling platformer. The player is controlling a dog Mimpi with directional arrows. Player can also interact with surroundings by tapping, swiping, and dragging on it. There is plenty of puzzles that player has to get through. The game is set in 8 different worlds that differs not only by visuals but also by gameplay. In a sea level for example your character is in a bubble and has to avoid touching anything. In the course of game you can find bones.  They are used to unlock various illustrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://applenapps.com/review/mimpi-exploring-a-strange-new-world |title=Mimpi Review – Exploring A Strange New World|publisher=Applenapps.com |date=October 18, 2013 |accessdate=February 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arcadesushi.com/mimpi-review/ |title=Mimpi Review |publisher=Arcadesushi.com |date=October 17, 2013 |accessdate=February 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The story is told by animations without written or voiced dialogues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cultofmac.com/251548/mimpi-is-a-little-dog-on-a-huge-adventure-review/ |title=Mimpi Is A Little Dog on a Huge Adventure [Review |publisher=Cult of Mac |date=October 29, 2013 |accessdate=February 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game follows story of a little dog Mimpi whose owner disappears when he enjoys his nap during a day. He sets up to find him. He meets strange creatures on his way and some of them are hostile. He gets through multiple environments and overcome multiple dangers. In the end he finds out that his real task is not to find his master but to help himself. When he went for a walk with his master they met some woman and his master didn't pay any attention. Mimpi ate a Chocolate [[Bunny]]. Because of it Mimpi got fever and everything happening is just a toxical [[psychosis]]. In the end Mimpi gets to his own stomach and defeats the Bunny. Mimpi then wakes up on his master's lap.

==Spin-off titles==
Silicon Jelly along with publisher Crescent Moon Games released in November 2013 three spin-off titles. '''Mimpi Volleyball''', '''Mimpi Signal''' and '''Mimpi Hidden Objects'''.

'''''Opus''''' was a [[Sunday strip]] drawn by [[Berkeley Breathed]] for a period of five years, 2003 to 2008. It was Breathed's fourth [[comic strip]], following ''[[The Academia Waltz]]'', ''[[Bloom County]]'' and ''[[Outland (comics)|Outland]]''.

Set in Bloom County, the strip documented the adventures of Breathed's popular character [[Opus the Penguin]], parodying both pop culture and politics along the way. It was launched with much fanfare on November 23, 2003, and was syndicated by [[The Washington Post Company|Washington Post Writers Group]]. In early October 2008 the author declared he was terminating the strip because of his expectation that the United States is going to face tough times and his desire to depart from his most famous character "on a lighter note".

==Characters==

===Opus===
'''[[Opus the Penguin|Opus]]''' is the title character and protagonist of the strip. Though he returned to [[Antarctica]] at the end of ''Outland'', Opus traveled back home to Bloom County, only to find that time has changed everything and everyone he once held dear.  His employment usually depended on the week's joke – since ''Opus'' began, he has so far been a political operative, a garbageman, and a newspaper [[ombudsman]] – but he was most often depicted as a syndicated cartoonist.

While his mother, maiden name Bougm,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gocomics.com/bloomcounty/1989/03/12|title=Bloom County by Berkeley Breathed, March 12, 1989 Via @GoComics|last=Breathed|first=Berkeley|website=GoComics|access-date=2016-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; was no longer "long-lost," she was not all he had imagined her to be after a decades-long search, and he was frequently seeking the comfort of an ideal mother-figure.

In a 2003 interview with ''[[The A.V. Club]]'', Breathed revealed that "Opus was named after a [[Kansas (band)|Kansas]] song."  (The band's 1976 album ''[[Leftoverture]]'' includes the song "Opus Insert" and a suite called "Magnum Opus".) He also added, "If you're too young to know who Kansas was, to hell with you."&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;[http://www.avclub.com/content/node/22539/print/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008174000/http://www.avclub.com/content/node/22539/print/ |date=October 8, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regular characters===
* '''[[Bill the Cat]]''' – the first of Opus' old friends to re-emerge (just months into the strip), Bill seemed to be the only one completely unchanged by time.  Still in a state of [[catatonia]], he was occasionally tapped to run for political office but most often seen relaxing by Opus' side.  He did not appear in many strips through the summer and fall of 2008, though.
* '''[[Steve Dallas]]''' – Steve was reintroduced little more than a year in, making him the only character to have appeared in a major role in all four of Breathed's comic strips. Steve, who had come out as gay at the end of ''Outland'', was back to his former [[chauvinism|chauvinistic]] ways, apparently as a result of so-called "reparative therapy" (i.e., [[conversion therapy]]). Steve's lack of ability to charm women, however, remained.  He had aged quite noticeably and appeared to be in his mid 50s, with graying temples and a receding hairline, but still retained his trademark sunglasses.
* '''Pickles''' – A little girl with a little bit of "snarky energy" (she first appeared as a self-proclaimed [[Viking]] princess), Pickles immediately began tagging along with Opus and Bill.  She appeared much less frequently towards the end of the strip's run.
* '''Auggie Dallas''' – Steve's long lost son, reunited with his father after many years. He had nothing but admiration for Steve, even though Steve was sometimes reluctant to act like a father figure.  His name may be a reference to [[Augie Doggie]].
* '''[[Michael Binkley]]''' – A longtime friend of Opus who began appearing in the strip after a somewhat unexplained twelve-year absence (see [[#Absent characters|below]]).  He appeared as he did in Bloom County, inexplicably not aging as Steve Dallas had.

===Other characters===
* '''[[Minor characters in Bloom County#Senator Bedfellow|Senator Bedfellow]]''' – Though previously convicted on corruption charges, Bedfellow returned later on, still usually drunk and plagued by reporters.
* '''Editor of the ''Bloom Picayune''''' – Usually Opus' boss, the ''Picayune'''s editor was depicted as hyper-stressed and suicidal, though somewhat older than he was in ''Bloom County''.
* '''[[Oliver Wendell Jones]]''' – For some reason, Oliver was shown, like Binkley, to be the same age as he had been in ''Bloom County'' and ''Outland''. He reappeared on August 5, 2007.
* '''[[Lola Granola]]''' – Opus' one-time fiancée (back in the days of ''Bloom County''), Lola reappeared on August 12, 2007 as Steve's girlfriend.
* '''[[Berkeley Breathed]]''' – On November 25, 2007, the cartoonist appeared as himself (using a likeness of [[Sean Connery]] as [[James Bond]] instead of drawing his own face) and "announced" that [[Jim Davis (cartoonist)|Jim Davis's]] character [[Garfield]] is gay in a parody of author [[J. K. Rowling]]'s ex post facto [[outing]] of the [[Harry Potter]] character [[Albus Dumbledore]].  The strip ended with Breathed calling Rowling a "lily-livered literary chicken".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.salon.com/comics/opus/2007/11/25/opus/index.html/ |title=Opus |publisher=Salon.com |date=2007-11-25 |accessdate=2015-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Absent characters===
Early on in the strip, it was revealed that Michael Binkley had fled Bloom County to become a teenage [[Tibet]]an [[eunuch]] after a disastrous first kiss (this kiss was described to Binkley by his older self from his anxiety closet in [[Bloom County]]). He was not heard from again until June 3, 2007, when he appeared in his child form without explanation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.salon.com/comics/opus/2007/06/03/opus/ |title=Opus |publisher=Salon.com |date=2007-06-03 |accessdate=2015-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At one point, Opus ponders the whereabouts of his other buddies from the past. Among those that Opus remembers are [[Milo Bloom]], although Milo's whereabouts have not yet been discussed. Additionally, [[Ronald-Ann Smith]], the original protagonist of ''Outland'', has not been referenced at all in the strip.

At an autograph party for an ''Opus'' anthology book, Breathed revealed that the reason many of the original child characters had not returned is because in the years since the end of ''Outland'', the child characters would have aged into teenagers, and Breathed had no interest in reviving the characters in that form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.platypuscomix.net/otherpeople/nightwithberke.html |title=My Night With Berkeley Breathed |publisher=Platypuscomix.net |accessdate=2015-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Death"==
On August 31, 2008, "[[God|the Creator]]" ([[Berkeley Breathed]]) spoke to Opus and hinted that the strip will end soon. The next week, Opus was visited by the ghost of [[Elvis]] who told Opus to find a place where he wants to be forever, because he will stay in that one spot after he "dies." e.g., Elvis is condemned to sit on the toilet forever because that's where he happened to be when he died.

Opus tried to fly to a tropical island on September 14, but when he was asked for his passport, he told the ticket clerk that he smuggled himself into the U.S. 30 years ago. He was promptly arrested by airport security while screaming, "[[God save the Queen|God Bless George Bush!]]" Opus was taken to the [[Department of Homeland Security]] and [[waterboarding|waterboarded]]. The guards told him to "start talking, [[Hasan Akbar case|Akbar]]!" Opus complained to "the Creator," saying he couldn't just let the strip end like this. "The Creator" then placed Opus in an [[animal shelter]], and mockingly said, "Happy?" to which Opus replied "NO!!"

The next week, September 26, 2008, saw Opus bemoaning having to spend his eternity in a county animal shelter.  At the behest of a fellow inmate, a scruffy dog, Opus soon began sharing his memories of his past and recounts his life through the run of Breathed's strips.  Many shots of him in well-known stories from ''Bloom County'' are then shown, including Opus saying "bozo" to a politician on the TV in 1981, misunderstanding a money-grubbing cultist in 1982, sharing a mass dandelion break with other characters in 1983, his role in the rock band ''[[Deathtöngue]]'' in 1984, dreaming romantically of [[Diane Sawyer]] in 1985, and a current joke about [[Sarah Palin]] set in 1986. The strip included a tag at the bottom indicating it would be continued the next week.

At this point, a trio of island-native girls arrive at the shelter; they only have room for one companion to live with them in their paradise.

On October 6, 2008, Breathed announced that the strip would end after November 2 that year,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/herocomplex/2008/10/berkeley-breath.html |title=Berkeley Breathed says goodbye to Opus: ‘I’m destroying the village to save it’ &amp;#124; Hero Complex – movies, comics, pop culture – Los Angeles Times |publisher=Latimesblogs.latimes.com |date=2008-10-06 |accessdate=2015-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and even decided to do a contest for people to guess what Opus's fate is on BerkeleyBreathed.com. The winner will have $10,000 donated to the animal shelter of their choosing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.berkeleybreathed.com/pages/ContestRules.htm |title=Opus Contest |publisher=Berkeleybreathed.com |date= |accessdate=2015-05-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218074030/http://www.berkeleybreathed.com/pages/ContestRules.htm |archivedate=February 18, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 19, 2008, Steve Dallas was shown barging into the Bloom County Animal Shelter's lobby demanding to see Opus, claiming Opus owed him $20. The clerk stationed there informed Steve that Opus had chosen his final eternity and that Steve should do so likewise, and very quickly.  The conversation ended with Steve finally realizing he was in a cartoon strip by breaking the fourth wall and asking the clerk who "all those scruffy-looking people [are]" as he looked at the readers, to which the clerk replied, "Probably [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] at this point," since he did this after dropping his towel, standing naked (but with a [[censor bar]] over his groin).

The next week, Steve found the tropical island girls and told them to give back Opus. It was then revealed that Opus had let his doggy companion in the shelter go with the girls, said "goodnight", and returned to the kennel. After seeing a vision of former ''Bloom County'' residents (Milo, Binkley, Oliver, Cutter John, Portnoy, and Bill the Cat) waving goodbye as they rode off into the distance atop Cutter John's wheelchair, Steve walked back to the animal shelter to find nothing but Opus' bow tie and an empty kennel. The final strip showed a glowing light coming from a box inside the kennel. Steve reaches into the box, and smiles at what he sees. The panel showed the address of a link to the Humane Society, which displayed the last panel as part of the $10,000 contest (it would later be printed in '' Berkeley Breathed's Opus: The Complete Library''). The final strip showed Steve opening a copy of ''[[Goodnight Moon]]'' and seeing Opus tucked in bed, sleeping peacefully with a mother rabbit watching over him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.hsus.org/forms/the_opus_contest.html |title= The Opus $10,000 Paradise Contest |date = 6 November 2008 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081110120144/http://www.hsus.org/forms/the_opus_contest.html | archivedate=November 10, 2008 | accessdate= 22 July 2015 |publisher= Humane Society of the United States}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2015 revival of the ''[[Bloom County]]'' comic strip reveals that Opus is still alive, only that he has been unconscious the past 25 years and that the events of ''Opus'' and ''Outland'' were all an elaborate [[dream sequence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2015/07/13/422545636/bloom-county-2015-berkeley-breathed-revives-comic-strip |title= 'Bloom County 2015': Berkeley Breathed Revives Comic Strip | date = 13 July 2015 | accessdate= 22 July 2015 |publisher=NPR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production history==
In numerous interviews before launching ''Opus'', Berke Breathed stated his hopes that the strip would help reinvigorate the medium of [[comic strips|newspaper comics]].  He criticized many modern strips, especially ''[[Garfield]]'', for lacking expressive artwork or original humor.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Jarnow |first=Jesse |url=http://dir.salon.com/story/ent/feature/2003/11/20/breathed/index.html?pn=2 |title=The penguin is mightier than the sword |publisher=Salon.com |date= |accessdate=September 16, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090402034501/http://dir.salon.com/story/ent/feature/2003/11/20/breathed/index.html?pn=2 |archivedate=April 2, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview appearing in the April 2007 issue of ''[[Texas Monthly]]'', Breathed announced that he planned to end the strip by killing off the main character.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.texasmonthly.com/2007-04-01/bookreviews.php ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205180639/http://www.texasmonthly.com/2007-04-01/bookreviews.php |date=February 5, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  On April 2, 2007 the journal ''[[Editor &amp; Publisher]]'' reported on this interview in a story titled "Will Cartoonist Berkeley Breathed Kill Off Opus the Penguin?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.editorandpublisher.com/eandp/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003566079 |title=Editor &amp; Publisher |publisher=Editorandpublisher.com |date=June 17, 2009 |accessdate=September 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Breathed's editor has reportedly quoted him as stating, "I mentioned Opus' literal death just for talking points on my [book] tour coming up. Not gonna kill him, but it's good for copy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gardner |first=Alan |url=http://dailycartoonist.com/index.php/2007/04/02/berkeley-breathed-planning-to-end-opus/ |title=Berkeley Breathed planning to end Opus?

I'd like to walk the streets free from fears of spontaneous [[garrot]]ing."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.salon.com/books/feature/2007/06/03/breathed/ |title=Opus day! |publisher=Salon.com |date=June 3, 2007 |accessdate=September 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2008, the strip began a sequence playing off the 2007 interview, as "the Creator" of the strip informed Opus that "the end is near."  The strip ended on Sunday, November 2, 2008, with Opus snugly in bed at the conclusion of ''[[Goodnight Moon]]''.

==Artwork and availability==
The original syndication contract for ''Opus'' stipulated that the strip occupy an entire half of a newspaper page.  According to [[Washington Post Company|The Washington Post Writers Group]], this was to provide ''"space for Breathed to offer richness and depth, similar to the breathtaking imagery in his popular children's books."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.postwritersgroup.com/opus.htm |title=Washington Post &amp;#124; News Service &amp; Syndicate |publisher=Postwritersgroup.com |date= |accessdate=2015-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; While this style can appear hand-painted or [[airbrushing|airbrushed]], it is actually rendered by Breathed on a computer using [[Adobe Photoshop]].  The half-page requirement was subsequently lifted, and the strip scaled down by most newspapers.  Its original illustration style has also been largely abandoned in favor of a more hand-drawn look, much like that of Breathed's previous strip, ''Outland''.

Initially, in an effort to help boost physical newspaper sales, the strip was barred from appearing [[online]]; however, in 2005, that too changed and ''Opus'' became officially available on the [[world wide web|web]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comics.com/wash/opus/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070507074857/http://www.comics.com/wash/opus/ |date=May 7, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 26, 2007, the strip featured Lola Granola wearing a headscarf, explaining that she was now a "radical [[Islamist]]." The cartoon was not printed by the ''[[Washington Post]]'' and many other papers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Joan Walsh |url=http://www.salon.com/opinion/walsh/media/2007/08/26/opus/index.html |title=Joan Walsh – Political Commentary and News |publisher=Salon |date=August 26, 2007 |accessdate=September 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following week's strip was also censored.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Joan Walsh |url=http://www.salon.com/opinion/walsh/media/2007/09/02/opus/ |title=Joan Walsh – Political Commentary and News |publisher=Salon |date=September 2, 2007 |accessdate=September 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both strips were replaced by more innocuous strips in the printed versions, but the 'objectionable' strips relating to Lola's religious beliefs were offered in a variety of Internet comics sites, including Breathed's homepage and the "My Comics Page" site.  This site now requires a paid "pro" registration for access to the censored strips, but free access to the censored strips is still available online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.salon.com/comics/opus/2007/08/26/opus/index.html |title=Opus |publisher=Salon.com |date=2007-08-26 |accessdate=2015-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.salon.com/comics/opus/2007/09/02/opus/index.html |title=Opus |publisher=Salon.com |date=2007-09-02 |accessdate=2015-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The movie==
In August 2006 [[The Weinstein Company]] revealed in a [[press release]] for an animated version of ''[[The Nutty Professor]]'' that it had a "[[Computer-generated imagery|CG-animated project]]" called "Opus" "in the works".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_pwwi/is_200608/ai_n16632590 | work=Market Wire | title=Mainframe Entertainment and The Weinstein Company Team Up for CG Animated "The Nutty Professor" | year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous online movie databases, including ''[[The New York Times]]'', have entries for the movie, titled ''Opus: The Last Christmas'', and give a release date of December 19, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Cieply |first=Michael |url=http://movies2.nytimes.com/gst/movies/movie.html?v_id=358566 |title=Opus: The Last Christmas – Trailer – Cast – Showtimes – New York Times |publisher=Movies2.nytimes.com |date=April 12, 2007 |accessdate=September 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/films.php?id=15965 |title=Opus: The Last Christmas – ComingSoon.net Film Database |publisher=Comingsoon.net |date= |accessdate=September 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these sites name Berkeley Breathed as the director,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moviecentre.net/upcomingmovies/preview/movie_id_1837.htm |title=Opus: The Last Christmas &amp;#124; Preview &amp;#124; Reviews &amp;#124; Trailers &amp;#124; Moviecentre.net |publisher=Moviecentre.net&lt;! |date= |accessdate=September 16, 2009| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080211111539/http://www.moviecentre.net/upcomingmovies/preview/movie_id_1837.htm| archivedate = February 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others list Tim Bjorklund and Paul Taylor.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; Initially, [[Miramax Films]] was reported to have obtained the movie rights to the series,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/2008/OPUS.php ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061110070435/http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/2008/OPUS.php |date=November 10, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but the project migrated to [[The Weinstein Company]] with the departure of the Weinstein brothers from [[Disney]] and [[Miramax]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/4392881.stm |title=Weinsteins step down from Miramax |publisher=BBC News |date=March 31, 2005 |accessdate=September 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, on May 8, 2007, during an interview&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wamu.org/programs/dr/07/05/08.php |title=WAMU 88.5 FM American University Radio – The Diane Rehm Show for Tuesday May 8, 2007 |publisher=Wamu.org |date=May 8, 2007 |accessdate=September 16, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090924165954/http://wamu.org/programs/dr/07/05/08.php |archivedate=September 24, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[NPR]] radio host [[Diane Rehm]], Mr. Breathed responded to an e-mail question regarding the existence of ''Opus: The Last Christmas'' by saying,
{{quote|Uh, the better question is, 'Is there an Opus movie going to come out?' and the answer is 'no.' And, now I can say it's all for the better. Uh, the Weinstein brothers at Miramax tried for five years to develop an Opus movie, their first animated film, and it was, let me just say, it probably wasn't destined to be, as ... as it probably shouldn't. And the problem with developing these kinds of movies and films is that inevitably they discover that a property as idiosyncratic as a comic strip doesn't translate well unless you have the confidence of bringing the creator in and factoring him into the creation of the movie. They never, never do that. Yeah, um, they just don't trust us. So without that control there probably shouldn't be an Opus movie.}}
In a June 2007 interview with [[Salon.com]],&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Breathed confirmed that the [[Miramax]] feature was "dead", but left the door open for an [[independent film|independently produced]] Opus film:
{{quote|There'll only be a movie if I'm writing it, which will probably keep him off the big expensive screen ... probably just as well.}}

'''''Ori and the Will of the Wisps''''' is an upcoming [[Platform game#Platform-adventure games|platform-adventure]] [[Metroidvania]] [[video game]] developed by [[Moon Studios]] and published by [[Microsoft Studios]] for [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Xbox One]]. It is a sequel to the 2015 title ''[[Ori and the Blind Forest]]'' and was announced during [[Electronic Entertainment Expo 2017]].

The game is planned to be a [[Ultra-high-definition television|4K UHD]], [[List of Xbox One X Enhanced games|Xbox One X Enhanced]] and [[Xbox Live|Xbox Play Anywhere]] title.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://gematsu.com/2017/06/ori-will-wisps-announced-xbox-one-windows-10|title=Ori and the Will of the Wisps announced for Xbox One|last=|first=|date=2017-06-11|work=Gematsu|access-date=2017-08-26|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
Players assume control of Ori, a white guardian spirit. To progress in the game, players are tasked to move between platforms and solve puzzles. Similarly to ''[[Ori and the Blind Forest|The Blind Forest]]'', ''Will of the Wisps'' is expected to feature a system called "soul links", which allows players to save at will, and an upgrade system that gives players the ability to strengthen Ori's skills. The game world unfolds to the player in the fashion of a [[Metroidvania]], with new abilities allowing the player to access previously inaccessible areas. Some of the foundational gameplay elements were inspired by the ''[[Rayman]]'' and ''[[Metroid]]'' franchises.

The game story is centered on a new adventure to discover the world beyond the forest of Nibel, uncover the truths of the lost ones, and unearth Ori's true destiny.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/ori-will-of-the-wisps|title=Ori and the Will of the Wisps for Xbox One and Windows 10|last=|first=|date=|website=Xbox.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development ==
The game was announced at [[Electronic Entertainment Expo 2017]] (E3) on 11 June 2017 with a teaser trailer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/6/11/15779186/ori-and-the-will-of-the-wisps-new-sequel-blind-forest-xbox-e3|title=Ori and the Will of the Wisps is the new sequel to the beautiful Ori and the Blind Forest|last=Gartenberg|first=Chaim|date=2017-06-11|website=The Verge|access-date=2017-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2017/06/12/ori-and-the-will-of-the-wisps-announced-about-sad-owls/|title=Ori and the Will of the Wisps announced, about sad owls|last=Smith|first=Graham|date=2017-06-12|website=Rock, Paper, Shotgun|language=en-US|access-date=2017-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://kotaku.com/microsoft-announces-ori-and-the-will-of-the-wisps-1796000967|title=Microsoft Announces Ori And The Will Of The Wisps|last=Grayson|first=Nathan|date=2017-06-11|work=Kotaku|access-date=2017-08-21|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trailer depicts new lands, and Ori with a young owl. Gareth Coker, who performed during the E3 unveiling,&lt;ref&gt;Track written by Gareth Coker for the E3 2017 reveal can be listened to at either [https://garethcoker.bandcamp.com/track/ori-and-the-will-of-the-wisps-teaser-music Bandcamp] or [https://soundcloud.com/garethcoker/ori-and-the-will-of-the-wisps-e3-2017-trailer Soundcloud].&lt;/ref&gt; was similarly announced to return to compose the score.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.vgmonline.net/gareth-coker-announced-ori-will-of-wisps/|title=Gareth Coker announced to score Ori and the Will of the Wisps|date=2017-06-12|work=VGMO -Video Game Music Online-|access-date=2017-08-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moon Studios lead developers [[Gennadiy Korol]] and [[Thomas Mahler]] commented that the team is "crazy iterative" when developing the game. For example, the E3 2017 teaser trailer went through 2,000 iterations during polishing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.trueachievements.com/n28650/ori-and-the-will-of-the-wisps-developer-interview|title=Ori and the Will of the Wisps Developer Interview|last=|first=|date=2017-06-15|work=TrueAchievements|access-date=2017-06-17|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; As for setting the standard and vision of the game, Mahler said that "''Will of the Wisps'' should be to ''Blind Forest'' what ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'' was to the original ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.neogaf.com/forum/showthread.php?t=1389585&amp;page=5|title=Ori and the Will of the Wisps E3 trailer, Page 5, Post #225|last=|first=|date=2017-06-12|website=NeoGAF|language=en|citeseerx=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-25|quote=Trust us a little :) I wouldn't worry too much.

On 7 August 2017, ''[[AM2R]]'' developer Milton Guasti was announced to have joined the Ori team as a level designer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.usgamer.net/articles/am2r-creator-speechless-when-offered-ori-and-the-will-of-the-wisps-job|title=AM2R Creator "Speechless" When Offered Ori and the Will of the Wisps Job|last=Kim|first=Matt|date=2017-08-09|website=USgamer|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2017/08/07/another-metroid-2-remake-developer-is-designing-levels-for-ori-and-the-will-of-the-wisps/|title=Another Metroid 2 Remake developer is designing levels for Ori and the Will of the Wisps|date=2017-08-07|website=VentureBeat|access-date=2017-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moon Studios released a video in October 2017 that showcased the design program used to develop cinematics of the game. The program reportedly allowed animators to make changes while in progress and thus allows for a more flexible and streamlined process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://gamerant.com/ori-will-of-the-wisps-cinematic/|title=Ori and the Will of the Wisps Video Shows Cinematic Tool|date=2017-10-15|work=Game Rant|access-date=2017-11-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A second trailer was revealed at [[Electronic Entertainment Expo 2018]] on June 10 2018, depicting new NPCs, bosses, movement and combat abilities, and revealing its 2019 release date.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Xbox|title=Ori and the Will of the Wisps - E3 2018 - Gameplay Trailer|date=2018-06-10|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kd0zbNw1VOg|accessdate=2018-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Paul Silverberg''' (November 18, 1927 – June 2, 2008), better known as '''Paul Sills''', was an American director and [[improvisation]] teacher, and the original director of [[Chicago]]'s [[The Second City]].

==Life and career==
Sills was born Paul Silverberg in Chicago, Illinois, to a family who believed in the teachings of modern-day Judaism. His mother was teacher and writer [[Viola Spolin]], who authored the first book on improvisation techniques, ''Improvisation for the Theater''.&lt;ref name ="Spolin"&gt;{{cite book|title=Improvisation for the Theater Third Edition|author=Viola Spolin|year=1999|ISBN=0-8101-4008-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spolin in turn was the student of play therapy theorist [[Neva Boyd]].&lt;ref&gt;Drama as therapy: theatre as living By Phil Jones&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1948, Sills enrolled in the [[University of Chicago]], where he established himself as a director, co-founding Playwright's Theater Club. There, with fellow actors [[Edward Asner]], [[Byrne Piven]] and [[Zohra Lampert]],&lt;ref&gt;Coleman, Janet, The Compass. Knopf 1990, pg 16: "Until Paul Sills 'thrust' her onstage...Zohra Lampert ('52) thought, 'I might want to become...a librarian. Not an actor.'"&lt;/ref&gt; they blended Spolin's improvisational techniques with established theater training.

In 1955, Sills and [[David Shepherd (producer)|David Shepherd]] founded the [[Compass Players]], the first [[improvisational theater]] in the United States, where he directed [[Shelley Berman]], [[Mike Nichols]] and [[Elaine May]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ldb77d9WzYsC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Compass+Coleman,+Janet&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjdzYr9jZTXAhUp5IMKHSOuBmoQ6AEIKDAA#v=onepage&amp;q=The+Compass+Coleman,+Janet&amp;f=false|title=The Compass: The Improvisational Theatre that Revolutionized American Comedy|first=Janet|last=Coleman|date=1 November 1991|publisher=University of Chicago Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1959, Sills, along with partners [[Howard Alk]] and [[Bernie Sahlins]], opened a theatre called [[The Second City]] where revues developed improvisationally were presented under Sills's direction.&lt;ref&gt;Coleman, Janet, The Compass, Knopf 1990, pg 255&lt;/ref&gt; With early cast members [[Alan Arkin]], [[Barbara Harris (actress)|Barbara Harris]], [[Severn Darden]], Mina Kolb and [[Paul Sand]], success led to New York (a brief run on Broadway and a long one off-Broadway), London and world recognition. {{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

==Career==
Sills left Second City in 1965 to form the Game Theater, where he coached his mother, Viola Spolin's improvisational techniques in performance and audience participation was encouraged. His mother and other community friends were partners. The Parents School was co-founded there, with wife Carol and others, with a children's curriculum based on group art forms and play. It operated for almost two decades. At the Game Theater, he also discovered a new form he called [[Paul Sill's Story Theatre|Story Theater]], which debuted at 1848 N. Wells Street, during the summer of 1968.  That building was the original location of the Second City, which had already moved to its new and current location at 1616 N. Wells St.  After Sills finished doing Story Theater there, it was torn down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.secondcity.com/history/1967/|title=1967 - The Second City|work=secondcity.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Story Theatre'' went on to play at [[Yale University]], in [[Los Angeles]] and on Broadway,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=3091|title=Paul Sills' Story Theatre|website=www.ibdb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; remaining the form Sills explored for the rest of his life. His book, ''Paul Sills' Story Theater: Four Shows&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Story Theater: Four Shows Adapted for the Stage by Paul Sills|last=Sills|first=Paul|publisher=Applause|year=2000|isbn=1557833982|location=New York, N.Y.|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;''.

Sills's first two wives were Dorothea Horton and [[Barbara Harris (actress)|Barbara Harris]].{{cn|date=October 2017}}

In 2011, he was posthumously inducted into the [[American Theater Hall of Fame]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/159061-Tyne-Daly-Ben-Vereen-Ann-Roth-Daniel-Sullivan-and-More-Inducted-Into-Theater-Hall-of-Fame-Jan-30|title=Playbill.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Paul Sills died on June 2, 2008 at the age of 80, at his home in [[Baileys Harbor, Wisconsin]], of complications from [[pneumonia]]. He is survived by his third wife Carol, a son, four daughters, four grandchildren, and five great grandchildren.

[[File:PRIMA DONNA (Ship) (c112-02-14).jpg|thumb|right|&lt;div style="text-align: center"&gt;''Prima Donna'' [[Clipper|clipper ship]] card&lt;/div&gt;]]

In [[opera]] or [[commedia dell'arte]], a '''prima donna''' ({{IPA-it|ˈpriːma ˈdɔnna|}}; plural: ''prime donne''; [[Italian language|Italian]] for "first lady") is the leading [[female]] singer in the company, the person to whom the prime roles would be given. The prima donna was normally, but not necessarily, a [[soprano]]. The corresponding term for the male lead (almost always a [[tenor]]) is '''primo uomo.'''&lt;ref name="dictionary"&gt;H. Rosenthal, H. and J. Warrack, ''The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Opera'', 2nd Edition, Oxford University Press, 1979. p. 398. {{ISBN|0-19-311321-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Prime donne'' often had grand off-stage personalities and were seen as demanding of their colleagues. From its original usage in opera, the term has spread in contemporary usage to refer to anyone behaving in a demanding or temperamental fashion or having an inflated view of oneself and a [[narcissism|narcissistic]] attitude.

==Opera==
In 19th-century Italy, the leading woman in an opera or Commedia dell'arte company was known as the ''prima donna'', literally the "first lady". This woman, usually the principal soprano of the company, would typically perform leading roles and generally sang more music than other women in the company.&lt;ref name="dictionary" /&gt; Famous opera prime donne have often caused opera enthusiasts to divide into opposing "clubs" supporting one singer over another. The rivalry between the fans of [[Maria Callas]] and [[Renata Tebaldi]], for example, was one of the most famous, despite the friendship of the two singers.&lt;ref&gt;See for example, George Jellinek, [https://books.google.com/books?id=AARY5QG7U3EC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA96,M1 ''Callas: Portrait of a Prima Donna''], Dover, 1986, p. 96 and ''passim''. {{ISBN|0486250474}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The designation ''prima donna assoluta'' (absolute first lady) is occasionally applied to a prima donna of outstanding excellence.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (Draft revision 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been used to describe the creators of heroic coloratura roles in the first half of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Riggs, Geoffrey (2003). [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=GhXggJliLF8C&amp;pg=PA1 ''The Assoluta Voice in Opera, 1797–1847''], p. 1. McFarland. {{ISBN|0786414014}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personality==
At times, these ''prime donne'' (the Italian plural form) were grand with their off-stage personalities and demands on fellow troupe members, musicians, set and wardrobe designers, producers and other staff, but were deferentially tolerated because of their consummate talent and their draw at the box office. From this experience, the term ''prima donna'' has come into common usage in any field denoting someone who behaves in a demanding, often temperamental fashion, revealing an inflated view of themselves, their talent, and their importance.&lt;ref&gt;Susan Rutherford, [https://books.google.com/books?id=s1j6Jl2LOfgC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Prima+donna&amp;lr=&amp;sig=A68hBbMrp3tzzAT70dvP8RIoJ2s#PRA1-PA44,M1 ''The Prima Donna and Opera, 1815–1930''], Cambridge University Press, 2006. {{ISBN|0-521-85167-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to this association, the contemporary meaning of the word has taken on this negative connotation of a [[vanity|vain]], undisciplined, [[Egotism|egotistical]], obnoxious or temperamental person who finds it difficult to work under direction or as part of a team, but whose contributions are essential to the success of a team.&lt;ref&gt;The Oxford Pocket Dictionary of Current English (2009). [http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O999-primadonna.html "prima donna"]. Encyclopedia.com. 12 Sep. 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Merriam-Webster]].

'''''Rabbids Go Home''''' is an [[action-adventure game|action-adventure]] video game developed by [[Ubisoft Pictures]] and published by [[Ubisoft]] for the [[Wii]] and [[Nintendo DS]]. The game was released in North America on November 1, 2009, in Australia on November 5, 2009 and in 
Europe on November 6, 2009. The modified, shorter version of the game was ported to [[Microsoft Windows]] and released in selected countries (Russia, Germany, Poland). This is also the first game that the Rabbids become allies with the player.

''Rabbids Go Home'' is the fourth installment in the ''[[Raving Rabbids|Rabbids]]'' series of video games and is the first stand-alone title in the series, since Rayman does not appear in the game. The game's plot centers on the efforts of the titular Rabbids to collect as many human objects as they can and create a huge pile high enough to reach the Moon, all the while avoiding the extermination attempts by the "Verminators", who wish to gain back the stuff the Rabbids have stolen.

The game received generally favorable reviews from critics, who praised the game's humor, soundtrack and accessible gameplay, though some noted the game's low difficulty&lt;ref&gt;http://www.metacritic.com/game/wii/rabbids-go-home&lt;/ref&gt; The reviews for the Nintendo DS version were mixed.

The online services for the game were shut down on August 8, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://forums.ubi.com/showthread.php/1241617-Online-Services-Update-Masterlist|title=Online Services Update Masterlist|publisher=[[Ubisoft]]|accessdate=March 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay (Wii version)==
The player controls a team of two Rabbids on a rampage pushing a shopping cart.&lt;ref name="LoveRabbids"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wii.ign.com/articles/979/979811p1.html |title=Why You'll Love ''Rabbids Go Home'' - Wii feature - at IGN |author=Matt Casamassina |date=May 5, 2009 |publisher=IGN |accessdate=December 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of the game is to go to human places such as malls, hospitals and other such places to collect as much stuff as possible during each level and help the Rabbids build a pile high enough to reach the Moon. In each level, there is enough stuff to grow the pile by 1,000 feet. The minimum requirement for completing a level is to collect the "Xtra Large Stuff" and carry it to the toilet at the end of the level and unlock new items for the Rabbids like figurines, tattoos, tools, accessories and challenges depending on the score.&lt;ref name="RabbidsHowToPlay"&gt;{{cite book |title=Rabbids Go Home instruction booklet |year=2009 |publisher=Ubisoft |page=4 |accessdate=December 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Xtra Large Stuff is located either in the middle or end of a level. Some Xtra Large items affect the gameplay. For example, a [[jet engine]] will propel the shopping cart to three times its normal speed, while a sickly patient's quarantine bed allows the cart to 
float and glide.&lt;ref name="LoveRabbids"/&gt; Placed throughout the levels are "Collector Rabbids", with which the player can leave any stuff they have collected up to that point. The [[Health (gaming)|health]] of the Rabbids (described in-game as "ideas") is measured in [[light bulb]]s, which fry out when the Rabbids take damage and get collected to refill. At the start of the game, the Rabbids will have three light bulbs, displayed at the bottom-left corner of the screen. Later in the game, you can earn up to 6 light bulbs.  If all of the light bulbs burn out, a cutscene will play when the last light bulb goes out then the Rabbid yells BWAAAH! then the Rabbids will get set back to an automated checkpoint, and if all of the stuff they have collected is lost, they'll reappear next to the most recent Collector Rabbid they've met.

The player can move the shopping cart with the Nunchuk attachment and accelerate using the A button. The Rabbids' main mode of offense is a loud vocalization called the "Bwaaaah! Attack", which can be triggered by shaking the Wii Remote. This attack can break certain objects, stun enemies like guard dogs, scaring humans and stripping them of their clothing. As the player advances through the game, the Verminators and robots appear and humans will start wearing soundproof helmets to protect themselves from the "Bwaaaah! Attack". The player can perform another technique named the "Super Boost", which is initiated when the shopping cart turns and drifts to the point where blue sparks fly from under the cart's wheels. When the player presses the A button and turn, and when blue sparks are coming from the wheels, and presses the B button, the "Super Boost" will be performed. This ability allows the player to knock down piles of crates, strip certain enemies faster and leap over obstacles through the use of springboards. The player can also launch the "Cannonball Rabbid", a Rabbid living inside the player's Wii Remote, by aiming with the Wii Remote and pressing the Z button on the Nunchuk attachment. This attack can strip certain enemies and open certain grates marked with "Tag".&lt;ref name="RabbidsHowToControl"&gt;{{cite book |title=Rabbids Go Home instruction booklet |year=2009 |publisher=Ubisoft |page=5 |accessdate=December 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At several points during the game, a rabbid is "drawn" into the Wii Remote itself, and can be thrown and bounced around while "inside" the remote as the screen displays an apparent interior view of the remote.

==Plot==
After invading Earth and partying intensely, the Rabbids are ready to get back home. Due to having the attention span of a [[goldfish]], they decide to go to the moon, which they think is a giant [[light bulb]]. They come up with a plan to collect all of the human stuff they can find, heap it onto a giant pile and climb to the Moon. They gather the human objects and fit them all into one shopping cart, transfer all of the stuff they have found through the sewage system via a series of toilets and add the stuff to their growing pile, which becomes higher as the game progresses. Eventually, the humans revolt against the Rabbids and become "Verminators" in a bid to exterminate the Rabbids and retrieve their stolen stuff.&lt;ref name="LoveRabbids"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Rabbids Go Home instruction booklet |year=2009 |publisher=Ubisoft |page=3 |accessdate=December 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the game, the Rabbids are still not able to reach the moon, even after gathering almost everything from the city.  The humans bombard the pile with time-delay bombs which explode on the pile, causing the pile to fly up into space.  At the result of that, the XL junk falls from the sky and the humans panic.  After all of the stuff has stopped falling, the humans are over-joyed to have all of their stuff back.  In space, the Rabbids celebrate their accomplishment of finally reaching the moon, albeit  caught in the moon's gravitational orbit.

==Development==
''Rabbids Go Home'' underwent three years of development before its release. A coherent and authentic storyline was needed to keep the Rabbids fresh and conserve their variety in the context of an adventure game. The development team evaluated the Rabbids as representing "emotions pushed to the extreme" and created the human characters to be the exact opposite: "[They] mull over all their decisions, their emotions in-check. Their organs have atrophied. They have nearly forgotten that they have a body or a heart, and can barely handle those." Jacques Exertier stated that the meeting between the two opposing characters is an allegory of the "internal debates we have with ourselves each time we make a decision" and that much of the comedic situations in the game stem from the meeting of the two archetypes. The setting of ''Rabbids Go Home'' was visually inspired by the period between 1945 and 1975, during which there was an explosion in mass consumption. The visuals were based on simple colors and geometric shapes rather than photorealism to create a caricaturized image of its "uptight humans with their sterile places and normalized urban planning". ''Rabbids Go Home'' is the first video game to feature the [[LyN]], which was created alongside the game.&lt;ref name="LoveRabbids"/&gt; The game was announced on April 9, 2009.&lt;ref name="IGNAnnounce"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wii.ign.com/articles/971/971455p1.html |title=Ubisoft Announces ''Rabbids Go Home'' - Wii story - at IGN |author=IGN Staff |date=April 9, 2009 |publisher=IGN |accessdate=April 9, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 17, 2009, Ubisoft denied a rumor that the game would be recalled from United Kingdom shops due to "inappropriate language".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/article.php?id=227488 |title=Wii News: Ubisoft deny ''Rabbids'' recall rumour - ComputerAndVideoGames.com |author=Stephen Daultrey |date=November 17, 2009 |publisher=ComputerAndVideoGames.com |accessdate=December 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result of this, the game has been re-rated a 12 in Europe. {{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

==Music==
The music of ''Rabbids Go Home'' was composed by Fanfare Vagabontu, a [[Moldovans|Moldovan]] [[Romani people|gypsy]] [[brass band]], but inspired from the Romanian folk music. A 12-track soundtrack was made available on the [[iTunes Store#Music|iTunes Music Store]] on November 17, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/raving-rabbids-rabbids-go-home/id341205344 |title=''Raving Rabbids: Rabbids Go Home'' (Original Soundtrack) |author=Fanfare Vagabontu |date=November 17, 2009 |work= |publisher=iTunes |accessdate=December 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game also includes licensed songs such as "[[Come Go With Me]]" by [[The Del-Vikings]], "[[Louie Louie]]" by [[Richard Berry (musician)|Richard Berry]], "[[Take Me Home, Country Roads]]" by [[John Denver]],&lt;ref name="NWRWII"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/reviewArt.cfm?artid=20327 |title=Nintendo World Report - Wii Review: ''Rabbids Go Home'' |author=Pedro Hernandez |date=November 16, 2009 |publisher=Nintendo World Report |accessdate=December 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; "[[Jamaica Farewell]]" by [[Harry Belafonte]], "[[Somebody to Love (Jefferson Airplane song)|Somebody to Love]]" by [[Jefferson Airplane]], "[[I Told You So (The Delfonics song)|I Told You So]]" by [[The Delfonics]], "[[Smarty Pants]]" by [[First Choice (band)|First Choice]], "[[Me and Mrs. Jones]]" by [[Billy Paul]]&lt;ref name="1UPWII"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.1up.com/do/reviewPage?cId=3176873&amp;p=44 |title=''Rabbids Go Home'' Review for the Wii from 1UP.com |author=Matt Leone |date=November 11, 2009 |publisher=1UP.com |accessdate=December 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "[[Rivers of Babylon]]" by [[Boney M]].

The Wii version of ''Rabbids Go Home'' received generally favorable reviews from critics. Pedro Hernandez of ''[[Nintendo World Report]]'' praised the game's "inventive" uses for the Wii Remote, "easy-to-get-into" gameplay, "deep" Rabbid customization modes, "great" soundtrack and "incredible" sense of humor, but noted the redundancy of the gameplay and inconsistent framerate as weak points.&lt;ref name="NWRWII" /&gt; ''[[NGamer]] UK'' concluded that "the Rabbids can pull off a fully fledged game without Rayman's assistance.

'''''Resident Evil Outbreak''''', released in Japan as {{nihongo|'''''Biohazard Outbreak'''''|バイオハザード アウトブレイク|Baiohazādo Autobureiku}}, is a [[survival horror]] video game with online playability for the [[PlayStation 2]]. Initially released in 2003,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Resident Evil Outbreak |publisher=[[GameFAQs]] |url=http://www.gamefaqs.com/ps2/554411-resident-evil-outbreak/data |accessdate=April 1, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was developed by [[Capcom Production Studio 1]] and was the first entry in the [[Resident Evil|''Resident Evil'' video game series]] (11th overall) to feature [[cooperative gameplay]] and [[Multiplayer online game|online]] multiplayer support,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/79685/interviews/interview-capcom-chief-lifts-resident-evil-0-lid/ |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5ybfDs1rG?url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/79685/interviews/interview-capcom-chief-lifts-resident-evil-0-lid/ |archivedate=May 11, 2011 |title=Interview: Capcom chief lifts Resident Evil 0 lid |date=August 30, 2002 |work=[[ComputerAndVideoGames.com]] |publisher=[[Future Publishing Limited]] |accessdate=May 11, 2011 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{allgame|43489|Resident Evil Outbreak}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Reeves|first=Ben|title=Guinness World Records 2012 Gamer’s Edition Preview|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2011/12/30/guinness-world-records-2012-gamer-s-edition-preview.aspx|work=[[Game Informer]]|accessdate=December 31, 2011|date=December 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; although online support was not available for the [[PAL region|PAL]] versions of the game.

''Outbreak'' was produced by Tsuyoshi Tanaka, and depicts a series of episodic storylines in the fictional location [[Raccoon City]]. It was set during the same general time period as ''[[Resident Evil 2]]'' and ''[[Resident Evil 3: Nemesis]]''. ''Outbreak'' was followed by a standalone expansion entitled ''[[Resident Evil Outbreak File 2|Resident Evil Outbreak File #2]]''. The game was praised for the graphics, fun-factor, and multiplayer but criticized for the lack of voice chat.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Resident Evil Outbreak screenshot.jpg|thumb|left|Players can give items to their AI partners and vice versa.]]

The controls and gameplay are similar to the [[Resident Evil (2002 video game)|Resident Evil]] remake, which was exclusive to the [[Nintendo Gamecube]], with quite a few adjustments. The player chooses a scenario, difficulty level, and a character. The difficulty level is tied to what enemies and items the player encounters as they progress through the scenario. The game has five scenarios, each of which has an event checklist consisting of special actions that the player must perform to reach 100% completion. Upon doing so the player will unlock "Infinity Mode", in which all the player's weapons never break or run out of ammunition.

Each scenario also has "SP" items. These are invisible items hidden throughout the level and are randomly generated on two paths{{clarify|date=September 2014}}. There are 20 scenario items for each scenario, and twenty items specific to each character hidden across the five scenarios. If acquired, these items unlock new costumes and the option to listen to their ad-libs.

Players were able to connect to the internet servers using a broadband connection and a network adapter. Account registration and login were required. Once players connected and logged in, they would choose between Free Mode and Scenario Mode. Free Mode took place in a lobby and allowed players to create their own games, scenarios, and difficulty level. Scenario Mode would choose the scenario and players automatically. When a player first started online, they would begin on the "Outbreak" scenario and progress from there. If the player wished to stop playing, they could save their data and restart from the scenario they were up to at the time. If the player had beaten a scenario, they acquired a star next to their name.

Capcom shut down the American servers for ''Outbreak'' on December 31, 2007, and the Japanese servers on June 30, 2011, ending official online capabilities. In 2014, private servers became available to Japanese editions of ''Resident Evil Outbreak''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/ten-years-later-fans-bring-resident-evil-outbreak-back-1494567563 |title=Ten Years Later, Fans Bring Resident Evil Outbreak Back Online|publisher=Kotaku |accessdate=2014-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The beginning of ''Outbreak'' is set a couple of days after the initial outbreak of the T-virus in Raccoon City, moments before the crisis further escalates into complete chaos. The game starts with the eight characters in J's Bar, who are unaware of what is happening until a lone zombie wanders into the bar and attacks one of the employees named Will. After that, the characters must make it through the city. The game ends in the final moments of the same incident, with the player attempting to escape Raccoon City before the U.S. government launches a missile strike to eliminate the threat posed by the T-virus. The player controls one of eight characters, in order: Kevin Ryman, Mark Wilkins, Jim Chapman, George Hamilton, David King, Alyssa Ashcroft, Yoko Suzuki, and Cindy Lennox, along with numerous supporting characters who can be selected in their place. Gameplay events transpire across various regions of Raccoon City and span over a period of several days.

There are five individual scenarios in this game, which are not set in chronological order. The first, "Outbreak", takes place at the beginning of the outbreak, as the police prepare to destroy the zombie horde using explosives. "Below Freezing Point" deals with the events in the former underground laboratory of Umbrella before the events of ''[[Resident Evil 2]]'', where a rogue virologist, Monica, attempts to steal bio-weapons research and deal with{{clarify|date=September 2014}} her former co-worker, Yoko Suzuki. "The Hive" involves the survivors taking refuge in the Raccoon General Hospital, which is also featured in ''[[Resident Evil 3: Nemesis]]'', while it is under assault from a colony of infected leeches. "Hellfire", set the same day as "Outbreak", involves a group of survivors fleeing into the Apple Inn hotel that turns out to be on fire and swarming with lickers. The final scenario, "Decisions, Decisions", regards the survivors' search for a cure to the T-virus, which sends them to Raccoon City University, where the eight different characters must wisely choose a decision to survive the puzzling secrets hidden in the university; they must then escape the city before it is destroyed.

==Development==

===Initial planning and cancellation===
According to an interview with producer [[Noritaka Funamizu]], the first concept of ''Biohazard Outbreak'', as it was known originally, was known before the release of ''[[Resident Evil 2]]'' in 1998. With growing interest in the concept of network gaming over consoles, [[Shinji Mikami]], the director of the first ''[[Resident Evil (1996 video game)|Resident Evil]]'', suggested to Funamizu that he should have a try. Early on in the design, Funamizu made a small multi-player mini-game in which the player must survive the longest time possible; the team decided to remove it due to its failure to encourage [[teamwork]]—players would instinctively run away from the horde and be slaughtered rather than help one another to ensure their own survival. They decided that what made ''Resident Evil'' scary was its lack of multiplayer, forcing gamers to play "on their own". The team then chose that the game would follow its own story like the other games in the series, but keep the option for multi-player.&lt;ref name="famitsu"&gt;{{cite journal| last= Hamamura| first= Koichi | date = 25 October 2002| journal= [[Famitsu|Weekly Famitsu]] | issue=  #725| publisher= Enterbrain, Inc.| language = Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game development was later put on hold.

===Revival===
Prior to 2002, Capcom decided to revive development of the game, based on the research gathered from the first attempt. Production Studio 1 began its development of the game, as opposed to Mikami's Studio 4. In February 2002, a Sony press conference regarding the PlayStation 2 revealed the game—previously unheard-of by the public, it had a working title of ''Biohazard Online''. This led to confusion amongst the audience before Capcom released a statement confirming its existence.&lt;ref name="Gspot 2002-02-15"/&gt; ''Resident Evil Outbreak'' was a part of an initiative from Capcom's Production Studio 1 to develop three [[PlayStation 2 online functionality|network]] focused games on the PlayStation 2. The other games were ''[[Auto Modellista]]'' and ''[[Monster Hunter (video game)|Monster Hunter]]''. Capcom's goal was to have at least one of the games reach a million sales. Both ''Monster Hunter'' and ''Resident Evil Outbreak'' eventually reached this goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-03-11-as-monster-hunter-turns-10-can-capcom-finally-make-the-west-listen|title=As Monster Hunter turns 10, can Capcom finally make the west listen?|last=Yin-Poole|first=Wesley|date=11 March 2014|work=[[Eurogamer]]|publisher=Gamer Network|accessdate=12 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game made an appearance at Sony's conference on May 21 at E&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; 2002, with a video showcasing real-time 3D backgrounds (as opposed to pre-rendered); revealing four of the characters and demonstrating the [[ad-lib]] system and character communication.&lt;ref name="Gspot 2002-05-21a"/&gt; The "ad-lib system" was chosen over conventional microphone chat because the development team argued that it would ruin the atmosphere. Instead, limited chat options were used for conversation between users; a player would walk up to another and deliver a line from a particular conversational category (e.g. "help" and "go" categories).&lt;ref name="famitsu"/&gt; No solid release date was given at that time.&lt;ref name="Gspot 2002-05-21b"/&gt;

Later that year the game was renamed ''Biohazard Network''. By October, eighteen different scenarios were in development, with even more in the concept phase.&lt;ref name="famitsu"/&gt; In November, Capcom released various pieces of media, showing eight playable characters and familiar-scenarios such as "Flashback". The occupations of the characters were also given.&lt;ref name="Gspot 2002-11-05"/&gt;

In January 2003, further information was provided, mostly regarding interactive NPCs (non-player characters). Capcom boasted such actions as enemy NPCs who would attack the player and other ones that would run away when approached. Screenshots of "Flashback", "Underbelly", "The Hive" and other scenarios were released.&lt;ref name="Gspot 2003-01-16"/&gt;

===Name change and cutbacks===
By May 2003, the game's title had been changed. This time, it had been changed to ''Biohazard Outbreak'' (''Resident Evil Outbreak'' outside Japan),&lt;ref name="Gspot 2003-05-02"/&gt; and the number of scenarios was reduced to the five scenarios. Another five scenarios did not make the initial cut, although they were complete enough to be featured in the E3 2002 trailer, and were developed into the sequel ''[[Resident Evil Outbreak File 2|Resident Evil Outbreak File #2]]''. In September, doubts were raised as to ''Outbreak''{{'}}s online game-play in Europe, but Capcom was adamant that it would at least try to find a way to solve the problem in time for release.&lt;ref name="Gspot 2003-09-03"/&gt;

==Release==
The European release was heavily delayed, finally released in September 2004—nine months after Japan and the United States saw its release. Back in March Capcom had given in on securing ''Outbreak''{{'}}s network due to the numerous problems faced with establishing a network in a region simultaneously for dozens of languages, and securing service providers; as well as the usual PAL/NTSC{{clarify|date=September 2014}} differential.&lt;ref name="Gspot 2004-03-26"/&gt;

''Outbreak''' received a "C+" from ''1UP'' in their review. The staff referred to it as "another typical entry in the RE canon", and as a "competent game" with "controls [that] are actually functional and somewhat intuitive". However, they cited a number of problems with the game, notably Capcom's choice of not installing voice chat in favor of the ad-lib system. They found the game's five scenarios to be short, and AI partners to be "chock-full of repetitive and annoying sound bytes".&lt;ref name="1UP"/&gt;

''[[Eurogamer]]'' was disappointed with Capcom's failure to establish online support for the European market at a time when the PlayStation 2's online community was threatened with the expected rise in the Xbox's popularity with the upcoming release of ''Halo 2'', stating that an Outbreak was "designed from the ground up to be a co-operative multiplayer game for four players" and questioning if a network-less game would be of interest to players. Another problem was with the real-time "START" menu, which meant that file-reading and item-trading would make the player vulnerable to a random zombie attack, making the game "[feel] light in the story department" as a consequence of not becoming immersed in the environment. Long load times for the PAL version was also noted in the review.&lt;ref name="Eurogamer"/&gt;

'''Sight &amp; Sound Theatres''' is an entertainment company that produces Bible stories live on stage. Based in [[Lancaster County, Pennsylvania]], Sight &amp; Sound operates two theaters: one in [[Ronks, Pennsylvania]] (formerly known as the ''Millennium Theatre'') and the second in [[Branson, Missouri]].

== History ==
Glenn and Shirley Eshelman started Sight &amp; Sound in the summer of 1976&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sight-sound.com/story|title=Sight &amp; Sound History|last=|first=|date=|website=sight-sound.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;, with a 10-week multimedia show ''The Wonder of It All'' in an auditorium rented from [[Lancaster Bible College]]. Based on that success, they built the original Sight &amp; Sound Auditorium (renamed to Living Waters Theatre) on Rt 896 in [[Ronks, Pennsylvania]]. In July 1976, the Sight &amp; Sound Auditorium opened for the performance of ''A Land of Our Own''. Live actors and actresses were eventually added to the productions, and Behold the Lamb debuted as the first full-length live stage production at the original Sight &amp; Sound Auditorium in 1987. A larger facility, the Sight &amp; Sound Entertainment Centre opened in March 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sight-sound.com/story |title= Our story |accessdate=2018-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, after the success of their productions ''Noah'' and the premiere run of ''The Miracle of Christmas'', the Entertainment Centre caught fire in January 1997, destroying the facility and most of the costumes and sets that were stored in the shops. The animals were killed in the same fire. The Living Waters Theatre was renovated to accommodate live stage productions until another large theater, originally called The Millennium Theater, was opened on September 1, 1998. The new [[theatre]] featured more than 2,000 seats, a {{convert|300|ft|m|adj=on}} wraparound stage that can hold sets up to 40 feet high, and improved audio and visual effects.

Sight &amp; Sound opened a second theater in [[Branson, Missouri]] in 2008, a near identical twin facility to the newest facility in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24204">The major '''sports in Venezuela''' are [[baseball]], [[basketball]] and [[Association football|football]]. [[Baseball in Venezuela]] originates with the early 20th century cultural influence of the United States oil companies. The [[Venezuelan Professional Baseball League]] was established in 1945. [[Football in Venezuela]] lags behind baseball, but its popularity in recent years has grown. [[Basketball]] and volleyball are also popular sports; there has been a [[Liga Profesional de Baloncesto (Venezuela)|national basketball league]] since 1974. The [[Vuelta a Venezuela]] is one of six cycling events in the [[UCI America Tour]]. The [[polo]] club [[Lechuza Caracas]] has had some success in North American polo competitions.

In international competitions, Venezuela has participated in the [[Venezuela at the Olympics|Olympics]] since 1948, and the [[Winter Olympic Games]] since 1998. It won its first [[Olympic medal]] in [[Venezuela at the 1952 Summer Olympics|1952]] when [[Asnoldo Devonish]] won bronze in the Men's [[Triple Jump]], and its first Olympic gold in 1968 ([[Francisco Rodríguez (boxer, born 1945)|Francisco Rodríguez]], light flyweight boxing). Venezuela first competed in the [[Venezuela at the Paralympics|Paralympics]] in 1984, and won its first Paralympic gold in 2008 ([[Naomi Soazo]], judo).

Venezuela participates in the [[Venezuela at the Pan American Games|Pan American Games]] and the [[Central American and Caribbean Games]], with [[Caracas]] hosting these games in [[1959 Central American and Caribbean Games|1959]] and [[1983 Pan American Games|1983]] respectively. Venezuela has had a [[Venezuela Davis Cup team|Davis Cup team]] since 1957.

Though [[golf]] is a minor sport under pressure in Venezuela, the emergence of [[Jhonattan Vegas|Jhonattan (Johnny) Vegas]] on the [[Professional Golf Association|PGA]] Tour in 2011 and his strong showing as a rookie there has raised its profile.

===History===
On October 22, 1941 the Venezuelan [[baseball]] team defeated the Cuban baseball team in the World Amateur Baseball tournament. Since the victory was unexpected because [[Cuba]] was heavily favored, it sent the country into a craze.&lt;ref name="Jamail 2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jamail|first=Milton H.|title=Venezuelan bust, baseball boom : Andrés Reiner and scouting on the new frontier|year=2008|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|location=Lincoln|isbn=978-0-8032-1571-9|edition=[Online-Ausg.]}}&lt;/ref&gt; A week later when the team returned to Venezuela over one hundred thousand people lined up along a twenty-mile road from La Guaria to the capital to welcome them back. At the time that was more than a third of the country's population.&lt;ref name="Jamail 2008"/&gt; Another fact to show the magnitude of the celebration is that government offices, businesses, and schools closed down to celebrate. The players were even greeted by President Gen at the Isaías Medina Angrita and many other high power people. The defeat of Cuba was recognized as a Hazaña at the time, which means a heroic feat.&lt;ref name="Jamail 2008"/&gt; Later in the year 2000, the country's association sports writers established the defeat as the countries most important sporting event of the twentieth century.&lt;ref name="Jamail 2008"/&gt; Since that “heroic” moment, the major spark of the sport of baseball escalated itself to be Venezuela's dominant sport.&lt;ref name="Jamail 2008"/&gt; The [[Venezuelan Professional Baseball League]] was established in 1945, with [[Leones del Caracas]] the leading team; another leading club is [[Valencia, Venezuela|Valencia]]'s [[Navegantes del Magallanes]], established in 1917. There is a [[Venezuelan Summer League]] (established in 1997) and winter league ([[Liga paralela|Liga Paralela]]). Venezuelan teams have won the [[Caribbean Series]] a number of times.

The [[Venezuela national baseball team]] won the [[Baseball World Cup]] several times in the 1940s, and the [[Baseball at the Pan American Games|Baseball tournament at the Pan American Games]] in 1959.

[[List of Major League Baseball players from Venezuela|Venezuelan players]] in US-Canadian [[Major League Baseball]] number over 200 since 1939. The [[Luis Aparicio Award]] was established in 2004, in honor of [[Luis Aparicio]], the only Venezuelan ballplayer to have been introduced into the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum|National Baseball Hall of Fame]] in [[Cooperstown, New York]]. The award is given annually to honor the Venezuelan player who recorded the best individual performance in [[Major League Baseball]], as voted on by sports journalists in Venezuela.

Behind [[baseball]], the most popular sport in Venezuela is [[basketball]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mostpopularsports.net/in-venezuela Most Popular Sports in Venezuela], mostpopularsports.net, accessed 25 January 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, the [[Venezuela national basketball team|national team]] has been one of the three elite teams in [[South America]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fiba.com/pages/eng/fc/even/rank/p/rankMen.html FIBA Ranking for Men], fiba.com , accessed 25 January 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The country hosted the [[2012 FIBA World Olympic Qualifying Tournament for Men|2012 FIBA World Olympic Qualifying tournament]] and the [[2013 FIBA Americas Championship]]. The (English: ''Venezuelan Basketball Federation'') controls the [[Venezuela national basketball team|men's]] and [[Venezuela women's national basketball team|women's]] basketball teams. Venezuela has been home to several elite basketball players who have competed in the world's top basketball tournaments and leagues throughout the [[Americas]], [[Europe]] and [[Asia]]. These players include [[Óscar Torres]], [[Richard Lugo]], [[Carl Herrera]] and most notably [[Greivis Vásquez]].

The [[Liga Professional de Baloncesto (Venezuela)|Liga Professional de Baloncesto]] is the main Venezuelan Basketball League, which features 14 teams.

==Football==

{{Main|Football in Venezuela}}
[[Association football|Football]] in Venezuela has gradually become popular and a mainstream sport with baseball, but baseball is still known as the country's sport.&lt;ref name="Nichols, Elizabeth Gackstetter 2010"&gt;Nichols, Elizabeth Gackstetter., and Kimberly J. Morse. Venezuela. Santa Barbara, CA: ABC-CLIO, 2010. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; This is believed because of how mainstream baseball is played and the success of Venezuelan players in the [[MLB]] ([[Major League Baseball]]). Also, it's believed that the failure for football to become as popular as baseball in the country is because the [[Venezuela national football team|national team]] has not done so well at international level. Venezuela is the only team to not have qualified for a [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] in South America, excluding [[Suriname]], [[Guyana]] and [[French Guiana]], who, although a part of continental South America, participate in the [[CONCACAF]] qualifying region.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;Bell, Jack.

===History===

Venezuela football has had a rough history throughout the years, especially with its national team, and have been looked at as pushovers. The team is known as the La Vinotinto (The Red Wine) due to their dark burgundy jerseys showcasing the same dark color as red wine (shown in the adjacent picture).&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt; The [[Federación Venezolana de Fútbol]] was established in 1926 following the creation of the [[Primera División Venezolana|Liga Venezolana]] in 1921.&lt;ref name="worldsoccer.com"&gt;Ferguson, Alex. "Venezuelan Football: A Brief History." http://www.worldsoccer.com. N.p., 2 July 2012. Web. 30 Sept. 2012. &lt;http://www.worldsoccer.com/blogs/venezuelan-football-a-brief-history&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Venezuela national football team]] played their first game in 1938. Professionalism was not established until 1957 with the [[Copa de Venezuela]] arriving two years later.&lt;ref name="worldsoccer.com"/&gt; The Vinotinto have struggled ever since the beginning of the national team competing for The World Cup in England in 1966.&lt;ref name="inbedwithmaradona.com"&gt;Ferguson, Alex. "Venezuela's Football Revolution." In Bed With Maradona. In Bed With Maradona, 3 July 2011. Web. 20 Oct. 2012. &lt;http://inbedwithmaradona.com/journal/2011/7/3/venezuelas-football-revolution.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; From then to the 1994, attempting to qualify for The World Cup series in America, the team was known as the "whipping boys," for how badly they lost to other teams. Within this time span they competed in seven qualifying campaigns, playing a total of sixty five matches consisting a record of seven wins, seven draws, and fifty-one losses.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt; Along with a poor of record, their goal difference was negative ninety-nine, meaning that they were scored on ninety-nine more times than they scored on opponents.&lt;ref name="inbedwithmaradona.com"/&gt; Two years later, 1998, a new rule changed to the format of the qualifying process gave a little hope for the Venezuela team to compete for a World Cup because it was now easier for them to qualify. It was made easier for the team to qualify because of the new point system and matches against weaker teams.&lt;ref name="inbedwithmaradona.com"/&gt; The expectations of Venezuela to have a chance to qualify were quickly shot down after the team actually started to play worse. The team play better in their previous campaigns with the harder qualifying rules than with the new.&lt;ref name="inbedwithmaradona.com"/&gt;

The next season, a new head coach was chosen by the [[Venezuelan Football Federation]] (FVF). The new coach was [[Richard Páez]], he was a former Venezuelan football player. He coached the Vinotinto until the beginning of the 2010 World Cup qualifiers where he unexpectedly resigned.&lt;ref name="inbedwithmaradona.com"/&gt; In his time as head coach he revolutionized the team with the help of a younger and newer players, helping them become a winning team instead of being known as the "whipping boys." He led the team to its first ever victory over [[Uruguay]], who then fired their head coach for the loss. After the famous 3-0 win, Páez said that "as a country, we have earned the right to savor this triumph after thirty six years of humiliation".&lt;ref name="inbedwithmaradona.com"/&gt; In 2007 the [[Copa América]] tournament was held in [[Venezuela]] where the Vinotinto won its second ever match in the tournament. They went on to be undefeated, winning their bracket, until losing the quarter finals to Uruguay 4-1.&lt;ref name="inbedwithmaradona.com"/&gt; The tournament was a huge success in bringing the country closer to the National Team. It is said for, a brief moment, football the nations favorite sport.&lt;ref name="inbedwithmaradona.com"/&gt; This new enthusiasm towards the team also brought higher expectations of the team as well. When coach Páez resigned, he was replaced with [[César Farías]] where he continued Páez's revolution of the National team. He currently is coaching the team and has also helped the youth of Venezuela football players increasing the intensity of play at each level which produces better players for the Vinotinto.&lt;ref name="inbedwithmaradona.com"/&gt; The 2014 World Cup Series will be the best and closest chance to becoming a qualifier for the Vinotinto.&lt;ref name="inbedwithmaradona.com"/&gt;

===Cycling===
:''Major events: [[Vuelta al Táchira]], [[Vuelta a Venezuela]], [[Clasico Ciclistico Banfoandes]], [[Venezuelan National Road Race Championships]], and [[1977 UCI Road World Championships]]''

===Golf===
:''Major events: [[Copa Tres Diamantes]] and [[Venezuela Open]]''

[[Jhonattan Vegas]] is Venezuela's most famous golfer, he was born in [[Maturín|Maturin]], [[Venezuela]]. He played college golf at the [[University of Texas]].

Vegas turned professional in 2008 and started playing the Nationwide tour in 2009.
 
Vegas represented Venezuela in the [[2009 Omega Mission Hills World Cup]] with [[Alfredo Adrian]]. They finished tied for twelfth place. Vegas won his first Nationwide Tour event in 2010 at the [[Preferred Health Systems Wichita Open]]. He finished the season seventh on the money list and earned his 2011 PGA Tour card, the first Venezuelan to do so.

In 2011, Vegas, competing as Johnny Vegas, won the [[Bob Hope Classic]] in [[La Quinta, California]], and a week later finished tied for third in the [[Farmers Insurance Open]] at the [[Torrey Pines Golf Course]], a municipal public golf course in [[San Diego]].&lt;ref name="NYT01"/&gt; He was also Venezuela's representative in golf for the 2016 Summer Olympics. On 30 July 2017 Vegas successfully defended his title at the RBC [[Canadian Open (golf)|Canadian Open]] for his third PGA Tour win. His play earned him another place in history at the [[2017 Presidents Cup]] as the first Venezuelan to compete in the event.

The sport has come under criticism from, and courses have been closed by, President [[Hugo Chávez]]. "Several years ago, Chávez closed three courses in the Vegas family's home state, [[Monagas]]. All were essentially clubs for workers in the nation's wealthy oil industry. Vegas's father, Carlos, who at one time worked as a caddie and later became a food concessionaire to two of the clubs, decided his son would have to leave Venezuela if he were to pursue golf seriously.
... [Chávez] has called it a 'bourgeois sport' played primarily by lazy, rich people in carts. He has closed six of the country's courses and said the government should appropriate private urban land for public housing. 'Do you mean to tell me this is a people's sport?' he said in 2009. 'It is not.' ... After Vegas won the Hope Classic, Chávez, who has not, it is believed, put buildings on any of the courses, proclaimed that he was not 'an enemy of golf, or any other sport.' He said he would call to congratulate Vegas. 'He beat all of the gringos,' he said. ... Vegas talked about having spoken with Chávez, and what he [Vegas] hopes will come about as a result of the chat: perhaps a friendlier attitude toward the sport."&lt;ref name="NYT01"&gt;Dorman, Larry, [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/02/02/sports/golf/02vegas.html?hpw "Venezuelan Rises on Tour After His Homeland Rejects Golf"], ''The New York Times'', February 1, 2011. Retrieved 2011-02-01.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Caracas Country Club, associated with the United States and the oil industry and designed in the 1920s by the [[Olmsted Brothers]], along with another club in the capital city, were under pressure to close in late 2010. Heavy rains had accentuated a severe housing shortage, and the president saw both political and [[land-use]] reasons for change.&lt;ref&gt;Romero, Simon, Sandra La Fuente P. contributed reporting,

===Motorsport===
:''Venues: [[San Carlos Circuit]] and [[Autodromo de Turagua]]''

Venezuela has produced some notable competitors in motorsport. [[Johnny Cecotto]] enjoyed a successful career in both motorcycle and car racing. He won the 250cc and 350cc races on his [[Grand Prix motorcycle racing|Grand Prix]] debut at the 1975 [[French motorcycle Grand Prix|French Grand Prix]], on the way to winning the 350cc world championship in his rookie year. He went on to win a total of 14 Grands Prix between 1975 and 1980, including three in the top 500cc class. He subsequently switched to four wheels, scoring two wins and finishing as runner up in the [[1982 European Formula Two season|1982 European Formula Two championship]] and racing in [[Formula One]] in [[F1 1983|1983]] and [[F1 1984|1984]]. After F1 he was successful in [[touring car racing]], winning the [[Macau Grand Prix]] [[Guia Race]] in 1986, the [[Italian Superturismo Championship]] in 1989 and the German [[Super Tourenwagen Cup]] in [[1994 Super Tourenwagen Cup season|1994]] and [[1998 Super Tourenwagen Cup season|1998]]. He also scored 14 wins in the [[Deutsche Tourenwagen Meisterschaft]] between 1988 and 1992, and finished runner-up in the championship in 1990. His son [[Johnny Cecotto Jr.]] is also a racing driver, scoring wins in the [[GP2 Series]].

After Cecotto's breakthrough fellow Venezuelans [[Carlos Lavado]] and [[Iván Palazzese]] also made an impact in Grand Prix motorcycling. Lavado scored 19 Grand Prix wins in the 250cc and 350cc classes and won the 250cc world championship in 1983. Palazzese scored consecutive wins in the 125cc class in the [[Swedish motorcycle Grand Prix|Swedish]] and [[Finnish motorcycle Grand Prix|Finnish]] Grands Prix in [[1982 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season|1982]] on his way to finishing third in the 125cc standings.

More recently [[Pastor Maldonado]] has emerged as Venezuela's most successful F1 racer, scoring his first F1 pole position and win at the [[2012 Spanish Grand Prix]]. Previously Maldonado had been successful in GP2, scoring ten wins in the series and winning the championship in [[2010 GP2 Series season|2010]].

Venezuelan racers have also competed in top-level motorsport in North America in recent years, including [[E. J. Viso]] and [[Milka Duno]].

==Martial arts==

===El Juego del Garrote===
[[El Juego del Garrote]] (The Garrote Game) or ''Garrote Larense'', is a Venezuelan martial art that involves [[machete]]s, [[garrote]], and knife fencing.

==Bullfighting==
[[File:Sevilla bullfighting c1850.jpg|thumbnail|right|19th Century Bullfighting Festival]]

''Corrida de toros'', or [[Bullfighting]], in [[Venezuela]] is thought to be the least popular out of the five Latin American countries.&lt;ref name="Nichols, Elizabeth Gackstetter 2010"/&gt; Also, bullfighting is considered to be more of an art form that the Spanish colonist brought with them, but is still a sport.&lt;ref name="Nichols, Elizabeth Gackstetter 2010"/&gt; The modern sport started in the 19th century with the Spaniards arrival.&lt;ref name="cas-international.org"&gt;"Venezuela." Venezuela. N.p., n.d. Web. 05 Oct. 2012. http://www.cas-international.org/en/home/suffering-of-bulls-and-horses/bullfighting/venezuela/&lt;/ref&gt; The industry started from the city of [[San Cristóbal, Táchira|San Cristóbal]]. The first bullrings were built of wood and didn't have many seats, but they eventually grew to the modern "large bullring," such as the Nuevo de Caracas that was built in 1968.&lt;ref name="Nichols, Elizabeth Gackstetter 2010"/&gt; The industry now has 55 bullrings, more than twenty-five breeding farms for bullfighting bulls, and two schools to teach how to fight the bulls. Festivals were normally held in honor of the patron saint or Virgin.&lt;ref name="Nichols, Elizabeth Gackstetter 2010"/&gt; Two of the most important festivals held are the Feria de San Cristóbal and The Feria de Sol (Festival of the Sun).&lt;ref name="Nichols, Elizabeth Gackstetter 2010"/&gt; These festivals have one week where each night there is an event with about four or five matadors, the "bullfighters," and an equal number of bulls.&lt;ref name="Nichols, Elizabeth Gackstetter 2010"/&gt; Even though these are two big events, bullfighting happens in these two places all year long.&lt;ref name="cas-international.org"/&gt; The quality of a bullfight, and how exciting the event is, is based upon the strength and power of the bull plus the skill of the matador.&lt;ref name="Nichols, Elizabeth Gackstetter 2010"/&gt; Bullfighting is legal in Venezuela because there is no national or state animal protection legislation that prevents animal cruelty.&lt;ref name="cas-international.org"/&gt;

==Coleo==
{{Main|Coleo}}
[[Image:TorosColeados1.jpg|thumb|Venezuelan Coleo: Llanero on horseback chasing cattle at high speed]]
Although Baseball, basketball, and football are the top three sports in Venezuela, the sport of [[Coleo]] has been a favorite past time for many years. The sport is most popular in the eastern and southern regions of the country.&lt;ref name="Nichols, Elizabeth Gackstetter 2010"/&gt; The sport is similar to that of American [[Rodeo]], where [[llaneros]] or cowboys, will chase cattle but most commonly a bull.&lt;ref name="Nichols 2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nichols|first=Elizabeth Gackstetter|title=Venezuela|year=2010|publisher=ABC-CLIO|location=Santa Barbara, Calif.|isbn=978-1-59884-569-3|author2=Morse, Kimberly J. }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are about three to five [[llaneros]] on horseback that will compete against each other and the bull. The objective of the sport is to chase a bull around an enclosed area, about the length of an American football field (100 yards), and pull the animal down to the ground by grabbing its tail.&lt;ref name=Romero&gt;{{cite news|last=Romero|first=Simon|title=Venezuela's Passion: Twisting the Tail of an Angry Beast|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/09/10/world/americas/10coleo.html|accessdate=30 September 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=Sep 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once a llanero takes down the bull, they must let bull back up so it can continue to run around the arena. They do this by "twisting the bulls tail." Which ever [[llanero]] can get the bull down to the ground the most times out of the all the riders, will win. The chase lasts about five minutes.&lt;ref name="Nichols 2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Romero"/&gt; The sport can be very dangerous, just like rodeo, because the riders can fall of their horses and be trampled by the bull. Sometimes the bull can break a leg or become injured, and if this happens the bull is taken immediately to the slaughterhouse, the manga.&lt;ref name="Nichols, Elizabeth Gackstetter 2010"/&gt;

'''Tellability''' is quality for which a story is told and examined as remarkable with its constructed merit. Ochs and Capps examine tellability as the reason a narrative is told. Namely speakers can transform any instance into a meaningful narrative, but most are tellable due to how they deviate from everyday happenings and the prototypical.&lt;ref&gt;Elinor Ochs and Lisa Capps. ''Untold Stories.'' 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[narrative]] changes dependent on its level of tellability, and these elements are largely contextual. The tellability of a story often parallels the perceived truth of the story.

== Context and Framing ==
The tellability of a narrative changes and is dependent on the audience, the content, the narrator, and more. This aspect of tellability directly thinks to Erving Goffman’s concept of [[Framing (social sciences)|Framing]] in his book Frame Analysis. Framing is the circumstances and tone by which any interaction is made, whether it be more of a sociable or professional frame changes the content of the interaction.&lt;ref&gt;Erving Goffman. ''The Frame Analysis of Talk.'' 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; According to this certain stories are more significant and appropriate in different social frames in comparison to others. Different frames change the tellability of a story and the means by which that story would be told.

=== Truth ===
The tellability of a story is influenced by the search for truth within the narrative, and this largely changes the story to reflect that truth to the audience. For a story to be tellable it must be believable to those listening. People are more willing to accept stories as true when they are more factual and not discouraging to their sense of security and comfort. Because of this speakers often have to reframe their narratives in order to have other people believe them, especially in different socio-political circumstances. Amy Shuman studies how narratives change in different contexts, and she specifically does research with asylum seekers. Shuman finds that, for a narrative to be believable, it must have an experience that has been told before, but it also must not be too common or people will see it as unremarkable or even just a copy of another’s personal experience.&lt;ref&gt;Amy Shuman. ''Representing Trauma: Political Asylum Narrative.'' 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, while the narrator may have most control over the telling of the narrative, the believability of it is often up to the empathy and willingness of the audience, and so narratives are often constructed with the thought of the audience in mind. This is similar to the [[Hawthorne effect|Heisenberg effect]], wherein the very act of there being a different audience greatly changes the narrative at hand. Yet truth within a narrative is often not solely reflective of objective truth. Truth is often a reflection of the emotional response of the speaker from their story or it can be honing in on a particular element of the story.

== Narrative Construction ==
A key aspect of tellability is authenticity. Elinor Ochs and Lisa Capps both examine tellability of a narrative, and they find that the balance of the narrative’s authenticity and aesthetic is what allows for the content to have a believable narrative structure and therefore makes it tellable.&lt;ref&gt;Elinor Ochs and Lisa Capps. ''Untold Stories.'' 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Authenticity is the objective truth of the account being detailed in the narrative. Authenticity often takes on a linear structure, as it reflects the cause and effect relationship and temporal sequencing of the events that transpire. The aesthetic quality is the change in the narrative that the speaker adds to it, so that the narrative will feel more genuine in how personal it is. Aesthetic may change the structure by which the story is told so to reflect the emotional response of the narrator as well as highlight the aspect most important to the narrator. A story’s tellability is directly linked to its balance between authenticity and aesthetic, as the story must be both personal and factual in how it presents its truth. Folklorists often find that truth is the means by which tellability is implemented in the story, so tellability is to give an understanding as to whether the truth is an objective or subjective matter.

=== Chaotic Narrative ===
In certain circumstances the tellability of the narrative is created through how unbelievable it is, this is commonly happens with the chaotic narrative. The chaotic narrative is told loosely and fragmented as it is the only way the speaker can remember and retell certain traumatic events. While a linear story allows for a show of temporal sequencing and signifies a more objective perspective, the chaotic narrative’s unorganized and seemingly disordered sequencing reflects the believability of the story due to the sheer emotional reaction of the speaker. Yet some chaotic narratives are untellable simply because the speaker cannot bring themselves to relive those moments. Diane Goldstein studies the chaotic narrative in trauma stories and how their tellability fluctuates.&lt;ref&gt;Diane Goldstien. ''Rethinking Ventriloquism: Untellability, Chaotic Narratives, Social Justice, and the Choice to Speak For, About, and Without.'' 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The chaotic narrative is usually used with trauma stories, as the narrator is still deeply affected by the content and can only remember certain aspects of the story. While the speaker’s retelling of the events may not be perfectly true to everything that happened, the chaotic story is told in this fashion because of how severe the memory is to the speaker. Therefore, the story may come out disjointed and focusing on minute details, as that is how the narrator remembers it to be.

=== Memory ===
Memory plays a major role in the tellability of a story, as memories are constantly changing and the lack of memory can often impede on the tellability of a story. In Untold Stories, Ochs and Capps detail the major role that memory plays in tellability.&lt;ref&gt;Elinor Ochs and Lisa Capps. ''Untold Stories.'' 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; They explain that as people grow older their memories of the past change and therefore the very means by which the story changes. Some stories lose tellability as they are forgotten, others lose tellability in how the memory of them are so fragmented that they cannot be told as a story. In other instances people grow so far away from these certain memories that they no longer seem applicable or important to tell.

== Reasons to Tell a Story ==
Tellability is also largely defined by the reasons for which a person chooses to tell a story. Some stories lack tellability for moral reasons, such as people not wanting to concern others with what they have experienced or to not hurt a listener’s feelings. Goldstein examines the foreknowledge and hindsight of telling a story in the wake of a major event.&lt;ref&gt;Diane Goldstien. ''The Sounds of Silence: Foreknowledge, Miracles, Suppressed Narratives, and Terrorism—What Not Telling Might Tell Us.'' 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In her research she finds that people may make stories of small coincidences in the aftermath of a great public trauma so to create more drama. People may want to feel security in knowing that whatever events are meant to transpire give their warnings and can be controlled, so people create narratives out of foreknowledge wherein it singles out an enemy for which people can put the blame on, and it makes the events feel more orderly.

	While stories can lack tellability due to their believability or their relevance, some stories are untellable as they perpetuate stereotypes and create a power dynamic. Goldstein examines tellability through ventriloquism wherein someone who holds more social influence and privilege tries to tell the story of people less fortunate.&lt;ref&gt;Diane Goldstien. ''The Sounds of Silence: Foreknowledge, Miracles, Suppressed Narratives, and Terrorism—What Not Telling Might Tell Us.'' 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In doing so these retellings lack tellability as they influence the perspective of people who are not the speaker and perpetuate stereotypes, as the speaker is not able to capture the authenticity of the experiences these other people have had. Telling the story of another person or community can be tellable, so long as it is not done to speak for them but rather to reflect on the speaker and to show what they gain from looking at these narratives.

'''''Totally Random''''' is a [[Television in Canada|Canadian]] [[sketch comedy]] television series produced exclusively for the web and [[interactive]] [[website]] uniquely intertwined. Both created and produced by [[Ottawa]]-based Mountain Road Productions the site officially launched on February 15, 2012 and is majorly funded by The [[Canada Media Fund]]'s Experimental Stream.

The first episode premiered on April 1, 2012, in the TV section of the website, and was followed by a second episode being released two weeks later.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[http://www.mountainroad.ca/mrp/images/shows/tr/downloads/totallyrandom-e-kit.zip/ Totally Random E-Kit]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; The series is currently on a summer hiatus, and new episodes will air beginning September 1, 2012, to showcase the digital creations (''SnowBalls'') made on the site,  Totally Random, over the summer.

==About==

The first of its kind, ''Totally Random'' introduces a brand-new interactive form of television along with a safe and creative social networking website aimed at kids aged 7 to 11.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mountainroad.ca/mrp/images/shows/tr/downloads/totallyrandom-e-kit.zip/ Mountain Road debuts interactive web/TV series, Totally Random E-Kit]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://kidscreen.com/2012/04/04/mountain-road-debuts-interactive-webtv-series/ Mountain Road debuts interactive web/TV series, Kidscreen.com]&lt;/ref&gt; The series turns traditional broadcasting on its side by introducing the next generation of kids to digital media and putting their creations in the spotlight, establishing a partnership between the producer and the viewer to create content for the TV series rather than going the traditional route where content creation is the exclusive domain of the producer. The result is a greater sense of ownership for the viewer and more fresh, relevant and timely content being produced.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

It is an online entertainment experience where kids can express themselves without limitations or expectations. The proprietary technology that drives the website allows individual creativity, innovation and imagination while sharing the experience with a larger, social network of kids.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.mountainroad.ca/mrp/portfolio/totallyrandom.php/ Production Website (Mountain Road Productions)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The innovative site features a huge library of random elements; supplying kids with raw materials like still images, text, audio, and video, to help them build the coolest, craziest digital creations ever imagined. From these original ''Seeds'', kids can edit the images with our online editor and media library and then pass it on to the ''Totally Random'' community. The key to the website is its ability to bring together kids from across the country and around the world as they work on building these digital creations we call ''SnowBalls''.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

==How It Works==

Using the large library of random elements referred to as ''Seeds'', and the website’s photo editor, kids build digital works of art called ''SnowBalls''. The coolest, most tagged and innovative ''SnowBalls'' move to the top and are featured in the ''Totally Random'' TV series. Presented by energetic hosts Ryley, Jayden, and Mason, the episodes encompass crazy adventures and random comedy skits performed by the TR Kids, Grant, Jason, and Umu. Every episode provides a showcase for the best user-created content, while setting the stage for the seeds and themes of the next episode’s challenges and tasking the audience to come up with cool new content, all the while creating new materials for the kids to use in their next ''SnowBall''.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

==Reception==

''Totally Random'' was showcased in ''[[Canadian Living]]'''s August 2012 issue, having made the renowned magazine's Editor's Picks for an interactive TV series for kids aged seven to 11.&lt;ref&gt;[https://twitter.com/totallyrandom/status/220943341846663169/photo/1/ Totally Random's Official Twitter]&lt;/ref&gt;

The video vixen image has become a staple and a nuanced form of sex work within popular music; especially within the genre of hip-hop.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Story, Kaila A.

==Stereotyping==
Biblical imagery accompanied by [[chauvinism]] morphs black female performers into "The Black Jezebel". This caricature portrays black women as promiscuous, unintelligent, and deceptive. This comes from biblical implications that [[Jezebel]]'s "beauty" captivated [[King Ahab]], in such a way, that it drove him from reason and he turned from God, to instead worship idols because he was blinded by his lust for her.  Black women under this type of social gaze are not seen as valuable. The only value given to them is derived from their physique highlighted by form fitting clothing that exaggerates the female form. There is continued [[hypersexualisation]] of the video vixen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harris|first=Tamara|date=March 15, 2016|title=Sunday Kind of Love: Sex and Spirituality in the Black Church|url=|journal=Bitch Magazine|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social aspect==

The work of video vixens and their portrayal in music videos have drawn criticism. Critics suggest that music-video models are typically placed in [[subordinate]] and [[submissive]] roles while male artists are shown in positions of power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Conrad | first1 = Kate | last2 = Dixon | first2 = Travis | last3 = Zhang | first3 = Yuanyuan | year = 2009 | title = Controversial Rap Themes, Gender Portrayals and Skin Tone Distortion: A Content Analysis of Rap Music Videos | url = | journal = Journal of Broadcasting &amp; Electronic Media | volume = 53 | issue = 1| pages = 134–156 | doi = 10.1080/08838150802643795 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="encyclopedia of women"&gt;Stange, Mary Zeiss; Carol K.

In 2004, [[Nelly]]'s video for his song "[[Tip Drill (song)|Tip Drill]]" came under particular criticism for its depiction and sexual objectification of women.&lt;ref name="Nelly"&gt;Bailey, Moya (May 24, 2004).

In 2005, former hip hop music-video model [[Karrine Steffans]] authored the book ''[[Confessions of a Video Vixen]]'', in which she depicts the degradation of women in the world of hip hop.

==Female rappers as video vixens==
Female rappers have most substantially felt this pressure, where sex appeal is now the currency by which women in the music business are valued and devalued. In particular, female rappers such as [[Lil' Kim]] and [[Trina]] occupy what T. Denean Sharpley-Whiting calls a "peculiar place of cultural antipathy", often accused of selling out and blamed for participating in the exploitation of women.&lt;ref name="genius.it"/&gt; Similarly, [[Nicki Minaj]] is arguably a 'video vixen' who is the 'object, subject, and author' of sexually explicit music videos.&lt;ref name="genius.it"/&gt;

Female rappers who have shown themselves off as "video vixens" include [[Nicki Minaj]], [[Trina (rapper)|Trina]], [[Eve (rapper)|Eve]], [[Rasheeda]], [[Foxy Brown (rapper)|Foxy Brown]], [[Remy Ma]], [[Da Brat]], [[Jacki-O]], [[Shawnna]], [[Gangsta Boo]], [[LoLa Monroe]], [[Diamond (rapper)|Diamond]] [[Princess (rapper)|Princess]], and Cardi B. The role women have evolved over time in the hip-hop world. Rapper Roxane Shante and Salt-N-Pepa were at the beginning where they were rapping
about defending women's image.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; They were responding to male hip-hop artists for degrading women.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Rappers Lil Kim, Foxy Brown, Trina, Nicki Minaj
and many others are all opposite in accepting hyper-sexuality.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Women, Pop Music, and Pornography|last = Levande|first = Meredith|date = 2008|journal = Meridians|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Black women in hip hop ==
[[Audre Lorde]], who spoke out for black girls who are considered video vixens (although she herself was never a video vixen or closely associated with hip hop), said: "If I didn't define myself for myself, I would be crunched into other people's fantasies for me and eaten alive."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Vixen Resistin': Redefining Black Womanhood in Hip Hop Music Videos|last = Balaji|first = Murali|date = 2010|journal = Journal of Black Studies|doi = 10.1177/0021934708325377 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The images presented in mass media, specifically in music videos, portray hyper-sensual images of the female sex. These images created within the world of hip hop reinforce the negative stereotypes associated especially with the black female.

It is pressuring for women musicians to conform to the porn standards because if not they will have to compete with the women who do.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

People realize that images of women is what rap music videos sell whether the women in the videos are playing the part of cheerleaders or die-hard groupies.  Women in the videos are what gets the attention of men and guarantee males audiences.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The images are still shots of women taken from videos displaying their appearance. Women are tended to dress half naked and moving their body in sexual ways.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Media have given a clear definition that African American women are only seen as sexual figures in the society. Once these images are put out there these women are not the owner of their representation anymore.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Expressing femininity in hip hop ==
Gender Performance is an evolving category where hip hop artists express femininity in nonconventional ways that break the stereotype of the passive, hyper-sexualized female body as an object to be consumed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Imani Kai|date=April 12, 2014|title=From blues women to b-girls: performing badass femininity|url=https://bbnewpaltz.sln.suny.edu/bbcswebdav/pid-1861563-dt-content-rid-2699459_2/courses/spring16_WOM393_02/Johnson_Badass%20Femininity.pdf|journal=Women &amp; Performance: a journal of feminist theory|doi=|pmid=|access-date=March 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the genre in graffiti, breakdancing, and rapping, women are addressing the issues associated with the passive stereotype of female representation in hip hop. [[Feminist activism in hip hop]] re-examines the relationship women have to the hip hop culture, and how women choose to assert their sexuality.

A form of femininity in hip hop is through asserting sexuality and using it as a dominant source of power, creating the notion of being liberated and a subject as opposed to an object.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Home Girls Make Some Noise: Hip Hop Feminism Anthology|last=Pough|first=Gwendolyn D.|publisher=Parker Publishing|year=2007|isbn=978-1-60043-010-7|location=Mira Loma, California|pages=116–127}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artists within this category use blatant sexuality to their advantage as a part of their marketing and work, by using sexuality to their advantage. Due to the commodification of hip hop and stereotyping, the "sex sells" concept became prominent within mainstream hip hop culture.

==Successful career paths==
Some video vixens who have made a name for themselves in the music video industry, as well as  girls with limited work as hip hop models, have gone on to other types of work with greater success, mostly by marketing themselves.

[[Nicole Alexander]] became an American reality TV show contestant and is known for winning the [[VH1]] reality television shows of ''[[Flavor of Love]]'' in its [[Flavor of Love (season 1)|first season]] and ''[[I Love Money (season 1)|I Love Money]]''.&lt;ref name="reality blurred"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.realityblurred.com/realitytv/archives/i_love_money/2008_Oct_07_hoopz_wins|title=Hoopz wins I Love Money|author=Andy Dehnart|work=reality blurred|accessdate=9 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another reality show winner was [[Chandra Davis]] who won the second season of [[VH1|VH1's]] [[Flavor of Love]] competition.
