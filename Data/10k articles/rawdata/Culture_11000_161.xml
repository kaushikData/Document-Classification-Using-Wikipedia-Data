{{Campaignbox ISIL insurgency in Tunisia}}
On 26 June 2015, a [[mass shooting]] occurred at the tourist resort at [[Port El Kantaoui]], about 10 kilometres north of the city of [[Sousse]], [[Tunisia]].&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="france24.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20150626-tunisia-deadly-shooting-beach-resort-gunmen|title=Africa – Scores killed in terror attack on Tunisian beach resort|work=France 24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thirty-eight people, 30 of whom were British, were killed when a gunman, Seifeddine Rezgui, attacked a hotel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Death toll from attack at Tunisia hotel rises to 39|url=http://www.wbtv.com/story/29415576/lone-gunman-believed-responsible-for-28-killed-at-tunisia-hotel|website=wbtv.com|accessdate=29 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the deadliest [[violent non-state actor|non-state attack]] in the [[history of modern Tunisia]], with more fatalities than the 22 killed in the [[Bardo National Museum attack]] three months before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Payne|first1=Ed|last2=Black|first2=Phil|last3=Smith-Spark|first3=Laura|title=Tunisia attack: Tourists flee the country after gunman kills 38|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2015/06/27/africa/tunisia-terror-attack/|accessdate=27 June 2015|agency=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The attack received widespread condemnation around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/26/tunisia-tourist-hotel-reportedly-attacked|title=Deadly attack on Tunisia tourist hotel in Sousse resort|last=Elgot|first=Jessica|date=2015-06-26|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-02-28|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tunisian government later "acknowledged fault" for slow police response to the attack.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Background ==

{{see also|Bardo National Museum attack}}

In October 2013, a suicide bomber blew himself up in a botched attack on a Sousse beach while security forces foiled another planned attack nearby.&lt;ref name=toi&gt;[http://www.timesofisrael.com/islamic-state-claims-deadly-hotel-attack-in-tunisia/ timesofisrael.com: "Tunisia to shut illegal mosques as IS claims deadly hotel attack"], 27 June 2015&lt;/ref&gt;
The post-[[Tunisian revolution]] led to the [[Tunisian parliamentary election, 2014|2014 parliamentary election]] in which the principal secularist party gained a plurality but was unable to govern alone, and ultimately formed a national unity government. Secularist [[Beji Caid Essebsi]] was elected president in the [[Tunisian presidential election, 2014]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/12/22/us-tunisia-election-idUSKBN0JZ04F20141222|last=Markey|first=Patrick|last2=Amara|first2=Tarek|title=Veteran Essebsi wins Tunisia's first free presidential vote|publisher=Reuters|date=22 December 2014|accessdate=27 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the overthrow of Tunisian president [[Zine El Abidine Ben Ali|Ben Ali]], terrorism increased, leading to 60 victims among security and military troops. Other attacks targeted civilians and tourists. Despite this, Tunisia was considered to be a secure country.&lt;ref name="chronicle.fanack.com"&gt;{{cite web|last1=chronicle.fanack.com|title=In Tunisia, is it an Era of Democracy or Terrorism?|url=https://chronicle.fanack.com/specials/extremism/in-tunisia-democracy-or-terrorism/|website=fanack.com|accessdate=27 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 March 2015, the [[Bardo National Museum]] in [[Tunis]] was attacked by three terrorists, leading to the deaths of twenty-two people, including twenty foreigners visiting the museum. Two of the gunmen, Tunisian citizens Yassine Labidi and Saber Khachnaoui, were killed by police, while the third attacker is currently at large.&lt;ref name="ThirdAttacker"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/third-attacker-run-deadly-museum-attack-tunisian-president-105754039.html|title=Third Tunisia museum attacker 'on the run', says president|work=Yahoo!

A police raid killed nine members on 28 March.&lt;ref name="TarekAmara"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/03/18/us-tunisia-security-idUSKBN0ME18E20150318|title=Gunmen storm Tunisian museum, kill 17 foreign tourists|work=Reuters|date=18 March 2015|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the Bardo attack, the government announced new security measures and declared the country safe again.&lt;ref name="chronicle.fanack.com"/&gt;

==Attack==
On 26 June 2015 the Spanish-owned five-star Riu Imperial Marhaba Hotel at [[Port El Kantaoui]], a tourist complex situated on the coast about ten kilometres north of [[Sousse]], Tunisia, was hosting 565 guests mainly from Western Europe, 77% of its capacity.&lt;ref name="update"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2015/jun/26/tunisia-beach-resort-attack-multiple-deaths-live-updates|last=Siddique|first=Haroon|last2=Jalabi|first2=Raya|title=Terror attacks: deadly gun assault on Tunisia tourist beach – live updates| work=The Guardian|date=26 June 2015|accessdate=26 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tourists from the hotel as well as from the Soviva Hotel located nearby went to the beach to swim and sunbathe.&lt;ref name="gua"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jun/26/tunisia-tourist-hotel-reportedly-attacked|last=Elgot|first=Jessica|title=Deadly attack on Tunisia tourist hotel in Sousse resort|work=The Guardian|date=26 June 2015|accessdate=26 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At around noon, Seifeddine Rezgui Yacoubi, disguised as a tourist,&lt;ref name="circ"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/06/26/us-tunisia-security-idUSKBN0P61F020150626|last=Amara|first=Tarek|title=Gun attack kills at least 28, including Europeans, at Tunisian beachside hotel|publisher=Reuters|date=26 June 2015|accessdate= 26 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; socialised with others, and then took out a [[Kalashnikov assault rifle]] concealed in a beach umbrella and fired at the tourists on the beach.

An Interior Ministry spokesman said that they were sure that others helped, but did not participate directly, providing the Kalashnikov, and helping Rezgui to the scene.&lt;ref name=indep28jun/&gt;

Rezgui is thought to have been recruited by [[Ajnad al-Khilafah]],&lt;ref name=ajnad&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/terrorism-in-the-uk/11707325/Tunisia-beach-massacre-gunmans-links-to-Britain.html telegraph.co.uk: "Tunisia attack: gunman's links to Britain"], 30 June 2015&lt;/ref&gt; an outgrowth of [[Ansar al-Sharia (Tunisia)|the Tunisian branch]] of [[Ansar al-Sharia]], which was founded by [[Saifallah Ben Hassine]], who had lived in the UK in the 1990s and whose mentor during that time was [[Abu Qatada]].&lt;ref name=whydt&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/islamic-state/11718614/Why-werent-we-told-of-Sousse-suicide-bomber.html telegraph.co.uk: "'Why weren’t we told of Sousse suicide bomber?’"], 4 July 2015&lt;/ref&gt;   High Court papers relating to a control order placed on a British-based suspect state that Ben Hassine "aimed to recruit new members and send them to Afghanistan for training".&lt;ref name=ajnad/&gt;  The control order documents add that: "Abu Qatada appears as a watermark running through the whole of this case as being the mastermind."&lt;ref name=ajnad/&gt;

Ben Hassine is reported to have been killed by the [[USAF]] near Adjabiya in eastern Libya on 14 June 2015.  The strike was designed to kill [[Mokhtar Belmokhtar]] in an Ansar meeting.  After the overthrow of Tunisia's President [[Zine el-Abedine Ben Ali]] in 2011, Ben Hassine was released from jail in March 2011 under an amnesty, and later founded Ansar al-Sharia in Tunisia, which resisted proscription until 2013 arguing it was carrying out humanitarian work, even though Ben Hassine personally had led the storming of the [[Reactions to Innocence of Muslims#Tunisia|US Embassy in Tunis on 14 September 2012]], three days after [[Ansar al-Sharia (Libya)|Ansar's Libyan counterparts]] killed US ambassador [[J. Christopher Stevens]] in [[2012 Benghazi attack|Benghazi, Libya]].  When Ansar was finally outlawed in August 2013, after the murders of two secular leftist MPs, he was listed as a proscribed terrorist by the United States, and he fled to Libya.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/tunisia/11715933/Senior-Tunisian-jihadist-and-Osama-bin-Laden-associate-killed-by-US-strike-in-Libya.html telegraph.co.uk: "Senior Tunisian jihadist and Osama bin Laden associate 'killed by US strike in Libya'"], 3 July 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/tunisia/11718577/How-Britain-and-the-EU-allowed-jihadists-to-wage-war-on-their-own-tourists.html telegraph.co.uk: "How Britain and the EU allowed jihadists to wage war on their own tourists"], 4 July 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Qatada wrote in a letter published online in January 2014 that Ben Hassine "is among the best of those I have known in intellect" and "the most knowledgeable of people of my intentions ... for he was the closest of people to me".&lt;ref name=ajnad/&gt;

In January 2017, documents obtained by panorama identified Chamseddine al-Sandi as the mastermind behind the attack. He is named in confessions from suspects who were arrested in connection with the shootings. Rezgui was killed at the scene, but the documents obtained by Panorama say that he was recruited and directed by al-Sandi. The confessions say al-Sandi ran a militant cell responsible for both the Sousse shootings and the attack three months earlier at the [[Bardo National Museum attack|Bardo National Museum]] in which 22 people died. Both attacks were claimed by the Islamic State.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-38557946?intlink_from_url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/topics/13bba436-5d61-409b-82ec-2d2f4ecbe1e6/islamic-state-group&amp;link_location=live-reporting-story&lt;/ref&gt;

Hotels were targeted in attacks to undermine tourism and because they were considered "[[brothel]]s" by ISIS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/tunisia-hotel-attack-gunman-imperial-hotel-sousse-resort/1/447398.html|title=Gunman kills 39 at Tunisian beachside hotel, Islamic State claims attack|accessdate=27 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both tourism and the related industries accounted for up to 14.9% of the Tunisian economy in 2014.&lt;ref name="youthkiawaaz.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.youthkiawaaz.com/2015/06/islamic-state-attacks-foreigners-in-tunisia|title=Islamic State Attacks Tourists on Tunisia Beach: Kills 38 In Sousse|work=Youth Ki Awaaz}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Kingdom]]'s Home Secretary [[Theresa May]] and Foreign Office Minister [[Tobias Ellwood]] visited the site of the shooting on 29 June 2015.

An inquest to the attack was initially scheduled to start in November 2016 but was pushed back to 2017. On 16 January 2017, the first hearing of the inquest was held in the [[Royal Courts of Justice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-35698927|title=Tunisia attack inquests put back to 2017|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-38630124|title=Tunisia attack: British lives could have been saved|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inquest found that the police response to the Tunisia Beach Attacks was "at best shambolic and at worst cowardly" after officers in the vicinity were found to be hiding or running in the opposite direction to the attacker.  A security team close by to the attack and armed with assault rifles and wearing protective vests, retreated to wait for reinforcements for a half an hour, during which time the lone gunman killed the 38 victims.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/01/world/africa/tunisia-resort-massacre-officers.html|title=Tunisian Officers, Branded 'Cowardly' During Massacre, Face Charges|last=Walsh|first=Declan|date=2017-03-01|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-03-02|last2=Youssef|first2=Nour|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By March 2017, at least six police officers were referred to trial for criminal negligence for failing to help the victims, and 27 others were referred on similar charges, according to the Tunisian Justice Ministry.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A coroner at the inquest ruled that the victims of the attacks were "unlawfully killed" prompting the relatives of British victims to take legal action against tour operator TUI.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-39109107|title=Tunisia beach attack: British families to sue TUI|date=2017-02-28|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-02-28|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tunisian president [[Beji Caid Essebsi]] called for a global strategy against [[Definitions of terrorism|terrorism]]&lt;ref name="reac"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/tunisia/11701043/Tunisia-attack-deadly-shooting-in-front-of-tourist-beach-hotel-live.html|last=Ensor|first=Josie|last2=Henderson|first2=Barney|title=Tunisia attack: deadly shooting in front of tourist beach hotel in Sousse – latest|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=26 June 2015|accessdate=26 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and visited Sousse with Prime Minister [[Habib Essid]],&lt;ref name=BBCNews1/&gt;&lt;ref name="youthkiawaaz.com"/&gt; who promised to close 80 mosques within the week.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.yahoo.com/tunisia-government-says-close-80-mosques-inciting-violence-004824930.html yahoo.com: "Tunisia government says to close 80 mosques for inciting violence, after hotel attack"], 26 June 2015&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ibt/&gt; The government also plans to crack down on financing for certain associations as a countermeasure against another attack.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dw.com/en/tunisia-to-close-80-mosques-following-terror-attack/a-18544478 dw.com: "Tunisia to close 80 mosques following terror attack"], 27 June 2015&lt;/ref&gt; Essid announced new anti-terrorism measures, including the deployment of reserve troops to reinforce security at "sensitive sites ... and places that could be targets of terrorist attacks." The "exceptional plan to better secure tourist and archaeological sites" will include "deploying armed tourist security officers all along the coast and inside hotels from 1 July,"&lt;ref name=toi/&gt; and that:
{{quote|The country is under threat; the government is under threat. Without the cooperation of everyone and a show of unity, we cannot win this war.

Beji Caid Essebsi also denounced the "cowardly" attacks, promising "painful but necessary" measures to fight extremism in the country. He called for a firm response: "No country is safe from terrorism, and we need a global strategy of all democratic countries,"&lt;ref name=ibt/&gt;

On 4 July, Essebsi removed from his post the provincial Governor of Sousse and at least five senior police officers. Among the policemen dismissed were three from Sousse, one from [[Gaafour]] (the home city of Rezgui) and one from [[Kairouan]], where Rezgui was studying.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/tunisia/11718571/Tunisia-sacks-governor-and-police-over-terror-attacks.html telegraph.co.uk: "Tunisia sacks governor and police over terror attacks"], 4 July 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 July, Tunisian MPs began a three-day debate on new counter-terrorism legislation. The legislation would allow the courts to impose death sentences to those convicted of terrorism related offences. The legislation would also make public support of terrorism a jailable offence. If passed, the bill would allow law enforcement and security services to tap phone calls of individuals suspected of terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/tunisia/11757026/Tunisia-seeking-to-confront-extremist-threat-with-new-anti-terrorism-bill.html: "Tunisia seeking to confront extremist threat with new anti-terrorism bill"], 22 July 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 July, the British Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office changed the advised status of Tunisia to "Advise against all but essential travel", resulting from 9 July in the planned return home of the estimated 3,000 British nationals in Tunisia at that time. ABTA and travel organisations First Choice, TUI and Thomson have stated that they plan to send no further British tourists to Tunisia until after 31 October 2015.&lt;ref name="BBC33473433"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-33473433|title=Tunisia travel alert: Thousands of Britons fly home|date=2015-07-10|newspaper=BBC News|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other Islamist attacks==
[[2015 Ramadan attacks|Four other Islamist attacks]] took place on the same day in France, Kuwait, Syria and Somalia. The attacks followed an audio message released three days earlier by [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIL]] senior leader [[Abu Mohammad al-Adnani]] encouraging militants everywhere to attack during the month of [[Ramadan]]. No definitive link between the attacks has yet been established. [[Saint-Quentin-Fallavier attack|One attack, at a French factory]], resulted in the beheading of one person; another [[2015 Kuwait mosque bombing|bombing at a Shia mosque in Kuwait City]] killed at least 27; and the other [[2015 Leego attack|attack on an African Union base]] in Somalia undertaken by [[Al-Shabaab (militant group)|Al-Shabaab]], killed at least 70.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/06/27/world/middleeast/terror-attacks-france-tunisia-kuwait.html?hp&amp;action=click&amp;pgtype=Homepage&amp;module=a-lede-package-region&amp;region=top-news&amp;WT.nav=top-news|title=Terrorist Attacks in France, Tunisia and Kuwait Kill Dozens|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10316">'''Agricultural philosophy''' (or '''philosophy of agriculture''') is, roughly and approximately, a discipline devoted to the systematic critique of the philosophical frameworks (or ethical world views) that are the foundation for decisions regarding agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;C. Taliaferro and S. Carpenter. (2010) "Farms" in ''Life Science Ethics.'' ed. Gary L. Comstock.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these views are also used to guide decisions dealing with land use in general. (Please see the Wikipedia article on [[environmental philosophy]].) In everyday usage, it can also be defined as the love of, search after, and wisdom associated with agriculture, as one of humanity's founding components of civilization.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lindsay Falvey]] (2005) Religion and Agriculture: Sustainability in Christianity and Buddhism. c.350pp. [[Institute for International Development]], Adelaide and Silkworm Books, Chiang Mai.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this view is more aptly known as [[agrarianism]]. In actuality, agrarianism is only one philosophy or normative framework out of many that people use to guide their decisions regarding agriculture on an everyday basis. The most prevalent of these philosophies will be briefly defined below.

==Utilitarian approach==
This view was first put forth by [[Jeremy Bentham]] and [[John Stuart Mill]]. Though there are many varieties of [[utilitarianism]], generally the view is that a morally right action is an action that produces the maximum good for people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/utilitarianism-history/ Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy/ History of Utilitarianism]&lt;/ref&gt; This theory is a form of [[consequentialism]]; which basically means that the correct action is understood entirely in terms of the consequences of that action. Utilitarianism is often used when deciding farming issues. For example, farmland is commonly valued based upon its capacity to the grow crops that people want. This approach to valuing land is called Asset Theory (in contrast to Location Theory) and it is based upon utilitarian principles. Another example is when a community decides on what to do with a particular parcel of land. Let's say that this community must decide to use it for industry, residential uses, or for farming. By using a utilitarian approach, the council would judge which use would benefit the greatest number of people in the community and then make their choice based upon that information. Finally, it also forms the foundation for industrial farming; as an increase in yield, which would increase the number of people able to receive goods from farmed land, is judged from this view to be a good action or approach. Indeed, a common argument in favor of [[industrial agriculture]] is this it is a good practice because it increases the benefits for humans; benefits such as food abundance and a drop in food prices.&lt;ref&gt;Conkin, Paul. (2009) ''Revolution Down on the Farm: The Transformation of American Agriculture since 1929.'' Raleigh: The University of Kentucky Press; Kingsolver, Barbara. (2007)''Animal, Vegetable, Miracle: A Year of Food Life.'' New York: HarperCollins Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, several scholars and writers, such as [[Peter Singer]], [[Aldo Leopold]], [[Vandana Shiva]], [[Barbara Kingsolver]], and [[Wendell Berry]] have argued against this view. For example, Singer argues that the suffering of animals (farm animals included) should be included in the cost/benefit calculus when deciding whether or not to do an action such as industrial farming.&lt;ref&gt;Singer, Peter. (2002) ''Animal Liberation.'' New York: Harper Collins.&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been challenged on the grounds that farmland and farm animals are instrumentalized in this view and not valued in and of themselves.&lt;ref name="publishing1"&gt;Thompson, Paul. (2010) "Land." "Life Science Ethics." ed. Gary L. Comstock. Raleigh: Springer Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, systems thinkers, deep ecologists, and agrarian philosophers (such as [[Aldo Leopold]] &amp; [[Wendell Berry]]) critique this view on the grounds that it ignores aspects of farming which are morally applicable and/or intrinsically valuable.&lt;ref&gt;Leopold, A. (1948) ''A Sand County Almanac.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press; Berry, Wendell. (2002) ''The Art of the Commonplace: The Agrarian Essays of Wendell Berry.'' Berkeley: Counterpoint Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Slow Food Movement]] and the Buy Local Agricultural Movements are also built upon philosophical views morally opposed to extreme versions of this approach. Other critiques will be explored below when different philosophical approaches to agriculture are briefly explained. However, it is important to note that the Utilitarian approach to agriculture is currently the most widespread approach within the modern Western World.

==Libertarian approach==

Another philosophical approach often used when deciding land or farming issues is [[Libertarianism]]. Libertarianism is, roughly, the moral view that agents own themselves and have certain moral rights including the right to acquire property.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2010/entries/libertarianism/ Vallentyne, Peter, "Libertarianism", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2010 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)]&lt;/ref&gt; In a looser sense, Libertarianism is commonly identified with the belief that each person has a right to a maximum amount of liberty when this liberty does not interfere with other people's freedom. A well known Libertarian theorist is [[John Hospers]]. Within this view, property rights are natural rights. Thus, it would be acceptable for a farmer to inefficiently farm their land as long as they don't harm others while doing it. In 1968, Garrett Harden applied this philosophy to land/farming issues when he argued that the only solution to the "[[Tragedy of the Commons]]" was to place soil and water resources into the hands of private citizens.&lt;ref&gt;Harden, Garrett. (1968) "The Tragedy of the Commons." Science, 162, 1243-1248&lt;/ref&gt; He then supplied utilitarian justifications to support his argument and, indeed, you could argue that Libertarianism is rooted in utilitarian ideals. However, this leaves Libertarian based land ethics open to the above critiques lodged against Utilitarian approaches to agriculture. Even excepting these critiques, the Libertarian view has been specifically challenged by the critique that people making self-interested decisions can cause large ecological and social disasters such as the [[Dust Bowl]] disaster.&lt;ref name="publishing1"/&gt; Even so, it is a philosophical view commonly held within the United States and, especially, by U.S. ranchers and farmers.

==Egalitarian approach==

Egalitarian based views are often developed as a response to Libertarianism. This is because, while Libertarianism provides for the maximum amount of human freedom, it does not require a person to help others. In addition, it also leads to the grossly uneven distribution of wealth. A well known Egalitarian philosopher is [[John Rawls]]. When focusing on agriculture, what this translates into is the uneven distribution of land and food.&lt;ref name="publishing1"/&gt; While both Utilitarian and Libertarian approaches to agriculture ethics could conceivably rationalize this mal-distribution, an Egalitarian approach typically favors equality whether that be equal entitlement and/or opportunity to employment or access to food.&lt;ref&gt;Arneson, Richard, "Egalitarianism", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Spring 2009 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = &lt;http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2009/entries/egalitarianism/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; However, if you recognize that people have a right to something, then someone has to supply this opportunity or item; whether that be an individual person or the government. Thus, the Egalitarian view links land and water with the right to food. With the growth of human populations and the decline of soil and water resources, Egalitarianism could provide a strong argument for the preservation of soil fertility and water.&lt;ref name="publishing1"/&gt;

==Ecological or systems approach==

In addition to Utilitarian, Libertarian, and Egalitarian philosophies, there are also normative views that are based upon the principle that land has intrinsic value and positions coming out of an ecological or systems view. Two main examples of this are [[James Lovelock]]'s [[Gaia hypothesis]] which postulates that the Earth is an organism&lt;ref&gt;Lovelock, James (2009). The Vanishing Face of Gaia: A Final Warning: Enjoy It While You Can. Allen Lane. {{ISBN|978-1-84614-185-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[deep ecology|deep ecologists]] who argue that human communities are built upon a foundation of the surrounding ecosystems or the biotic communities.&lt;ref&gt;Naess, Arne (1973) 'The Shallow and the Deep, Long-Range Ecology Movement.' Inquiry 16: 95-100&lt;/ref&gt; While the above philosophies can be useful for guiding decision making on issues concerning land in general, they have limited usefulness when applied to agriculture because these philosophies privilege natural ecosystems and agricultural ecosystems are often considered not natural. One philosophy grounded in the principle that land has intrinsic value which is directly applicable to agriculture is [[Aldo Leopold]]'s stewardship ethic or [[land ethic]].&lt;ref name="university1948"&gt;Leopold, A. (1948) A Sand County Almanac. Oxford: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; For Leopold, an action is correct if it tends to "preserve the integrity, stability, and beauty of the biotic community".&lt;ref name="university1948"/&gt; Similar to Egalitarian-based land ethics, many of the above philosophies were also developed as alternatives to utilitarian and libertarian based approaches. Leopold's ethic is currently one of the most popular ecological approaches to agriculture commonly known as [[agrarianism]]. Other agrarianists include [[Benjamin Franklin]], [[Thomas Jefferson]], [[J. Hector St. John de Crèvecœur]] (1735–1813), [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] (1803–1882), [[Henry David Thoreau]] (1817–1862), [[John Steinbeck]] (1902–1968), [[Wendell Berry]] (b. 1934), [[Gene Logsdon]] (b. 1932), [[Paul B. Thompson (philosopher)|Paul B. Thompson]], and [[Barbara Kingsolver]].

{{Italic title|reason=[[:Category:Japanese words and phrases]]}}
'''''Akisutozeneko''''', (''あきすとぜねこの or アキストゼネコ in Japanese'') is a love [[Fortune-telling|fortune telling]] used mainly by girls in the [[Shōwa period|Showa period]].

Each character associated "aishiteru", "kirai", "suki" "tomodachi", "zekkou", "netsuretsu" and "koibito". Using their initials they would perform Akisutozeneko.

== How to perform Akisutozeneko ==

''(Incorrect somewhere)''

''Akisutozeneko'' is performed by changing the letters of your name into numbers.

1) First change any vowels into numbers (a=1、i=2、u=3、e=4、o=5、n=1)&lt;br /&gt;
For example:
俗語太郎＝ぞくごたろう = Zokugo Tarou = 535153&lt;br /&gt;
	     辞書花美＝じしょはなみ = Jishi(o) Hanami = 223112

''(No 'small Hiragana' are used for this fortune telling method.)''

2) Next, eliminate any numbers that you both share in common.
   
俗語太郎 ＝ ぞくごたろう=Zokugo Tarou = 535153 = 5+5+5 = 15&lt;br /&gt;
辞書花美 ＝ じしょはなみ=Jishi(o) Hanami = 223112 = 2+2+2 = 6

3) Now each number has an associated letter:

あ=a=1&lt;br /&gt;
き=ki=2&lt;br /&gt;
す=su=3&lt;br /&gt;
と=to=4&lt;br /&gt;
ぜ=ze=5&lt;br /&gt;
ね=ne=6&lt;br /&gt;
こ=ko=7&lt;br /&gt;
あ=a=8&lt;br /&gt;
き=ki=9&lt;br /&gt;
etc.

Zokugo Tarou being 15, he will be "ne"&lt;br /&gt;
Jisho Hanami is 6, which is also "ne".&lt;br /&gt;
Therefore, their fortune together is netsuretsu. (passionate)

----

''Japanese:''

『あ』・・・愛している&lt;br /&gt;
『き』・・・嫌い&lt;br /&gt;
『す』・・・好き&lt;br /&gt;
『と』・・・友達&lt;br /&gt;
『ぜ』・・・絶交&lt;br /&gt;
『ね』・・・熱中&lt;br /&gt;
『こ』・・・恋人

[[File:Flag of the United States.svg|thumb|275px|[[Flag of the United States]]]]

'''American nationalism''' or '''United States nationalism''' is a form of [[civic nationalism]]&lt;ref name="Citizen" /&gt; found in the [[United States]].{{sfn|Motyl|2001|p=16}} Essentially, it indicates the aspects that characterize and distinguish the United States as an autonomous political community.

== History ==
{{main|History of the United States}}
The United States traces its origins to the [[Thirteen Colonies]] founded by [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]] in the 17th and early 18th century. Residents identified with Britain until the mid-18th century when the first sense of being "American" emerged. The [[Albany Plan]] proposed a union between the colonies in 1754. Although unsuccessful, it served as a reference for future discussions of independence.

[[File:Declaration of Independence (1819), by John Trumbull.jpg|thumb|325px|left|[[John Trumbull]]'s ''[[Declaration of Independence (Trumbull)|Declaration of Independence]]'' is often identified as a depiction of the signing of the Declaration, but it actually shows the drafting committee presenting its work to the Congress&lt;ref&gt;Wills, ''Inventing America'', 348.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Soon afterward, the colonies faced [[Causes of the revolutionary war|several common grievances]] over acts passed by the [[Parliament of Great Britain|British Parliament]], including [[taxation without representation]].  Americans were in general agreement that only their own colonial legislatures—and not Parliament in London—could pass taxes. Parliament vigorously insisted otherwise and no compromise was found. The London government punished Boston for the [[Boston Tea Party]] and the Thirteen Colonies united and formed the [[Continental Congress]], which lasted from 1774 to 1789. Fighting broke out in 1775 and the sentiment swung to independence in early 1776, influenced especially by the appeal to American nationalism by [[Thomas Paine]]. His pamphlet ''[[Common Sense]]'' was a runaway best seller in 1776.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Loughran|first=Trish|date=2006-03-01|title=Disseminating Common Sense: Thomas Paine and the Problem of the Early National Bestseller|journal=American Literature|volume=78|issue=1|pages=1–28|doi=10.1215/00029831-78-1-1|issn=0002-9831}}&lt;/ref&gt; Congress unanimously issued a [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] announcing a new nation had formed, the United States of America. [[Patriot (American Revolution)|American Patriots]] won the [[American Revolutionary War]] and received generous peace terms from Britain in 1783. The minority of [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalists]] (loyal to King George III) could remain or leave, but about 80% remained and became full American citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Savelle|first=Max|date=1962|title=Nationalism and Other Loyalties in the American Revolution|journal=The American Historical Review|volume=67|issue=4|pages=901–923|doi=10.2307/1845245|jstor=1845245}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frequent parades along with new rituals and ceremonies—and a new flag—provided popular occasions for expressing a spirit of American nationalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Waldstreicher|first=David|date=1995|title=Rites of Rebellion, Rites of Assent: Celebrations, Print Culture, and the Origins of American Nationalism|journal=The Journal of American History|volume=82|issue=1|pages=37–61|doi=10.2307/2081914|jstor=2081914}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new nation operated under the very weak national government set up by the [[Articles of Confederation]] and most Americans put loyalty to their state ahead of loyalty to the nation. Nationalists led by [[George Washington]], [[Alexander Hamilton]] and [[James Madison]] had Congress call a constitutional convention in 1787. It produced the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] for a strong national government which was debated in every state and unanimously adopted. It went into effect in 1789 with Washington as the first President.&lt;ref&gt;Edward J. Larson, ''George Washington, Nationalist'' (U of Virginia Press, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

In an 1858 speech, future President [[Abraham Lincoln]] alluded to a form of American civic nationalism originating from the tenets of the Declaration of Independence as a force for [[national unity]] in the United States, stating that it was a method for uniting diverse peoples of different ethnic ancestries into a common nationality:
{{quotation|If they look back through this history to trace their connection with those days by blood, they find they have none, they cannot carry themselves back into that glorious epoch and make themselves feel that they are part of us, but when they look through that old ''Declaration of Independence'' they find that those old men say that "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal", and then they feel that moral sentiment taught in that day evidences their relation to those men, that it is the father of all moral principle in them, and that they have a right to claim it as though they were blood of the blood, and flesh of the flesh of the men who wrote the Declaration, and so they are. That is the electric cord in that Declaration that links the hearts of patriotic and liberty-loving men together, that will link those patriotic hearts as long as the love of freedom exists in the minds of men throughout the world.|[[Abraham Lincoln]]|address to Chicagoan voters, July 10, 1858&lt;ref&gt;[http://quod.lib.umich.edu/l/lincoln/lincoln2/1:526?rgn=div1;singlegenre=All;sort=occur;subview=detail;type=simple;view=fulltext;q1=Let+us+discard+all+this+quibbling Address to Chicagoan voters] (July 10, 1858); quoted in Roy P.

=== American Civil War ===
White Southerners increasingly felt alienated—they saw themselves as becoming second-class citizens as aggressive anti-slavery Northerners tried to end their ability to take slave property to the fast-growing western territories. They questioned whether their loyalty to the nation trumped their loyalty to their state and their way of life since it was so intimately bound up with slavery, whether they owned any slaves or not.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/1115989|title=The Idea of Nationalism: A Study in Its Origins and Background|last=Kohn|first=Hans|date=1961|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=|location=|pages=|oclc=1115989}}&lt;/ref&gt; A sense of [[Southern nationalism]] was starting to emerge, though it was inchoate as late as 1860 when the election of Lincoln was a signal for most of the slave states in the South to secede and form their own new nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://worldcat.org/oclc/4933821|title=The Idea of a Southern Nation: Southern Nationalists and Southern Nationalism, 1830–1860|last=McCardell|first=John|publisher=|year=1979|isbn=978-0393012415|location=|pages=|oclc=4933821}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Confederate States of America|Confederate government]] insisted the nationalism was real and imposed increasing burdens on the population in the name of independence and nationalism. The fierce combat record of the Confederates demonstrates their commitment to the death for independence. The government and army refused to compromise and were militarily overwhelmed in 1865.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Quigley, ''Shifting Grounds: Nationalism and the American South, 1848–1865'' (2012)&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1890s, the white South felt vindicated through its belief in the newly constructed memory of the [[Lost Cause of the Confederacy]]. The North came to accept or at least tolerate racial segregation and disfranchisement of black voters in the South. The spirit of American nationalism had returned to [[Dixie]].&lt;ref&gt;Gaines M. Foster, ''Ghosts of the Confederacy: Defeat, the Lost Cause and the Emergence of the New South, 1865–1913'' (1988).&lt;/ref&gt;

The North's triumph in the American Civil War marked a significant transition in American national identity. The ratification of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] settled the basic question of national identity, such as the criteria for becoming a citizen of the United States. Everyone born in the territorial boundaries of the United States or those areas and subject to its jurisdiction was an American citizen, regardless of ethnicity or social status (Indians on reservations became citizens in 1924 while Indians off reservations had always been citizens).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Larsen|first=Charles E.|date=1959|title=Nationalism and States' Rights in Commentaries on the Constitution after the Civil War|journal=The American Journal of Legal History|volume=3|issue=4|pages=360–369|doi=10.2307/844323|jstor=844323}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With a very fast growing industrial economy, immigrants were welcome from Europe, Canada, Mexico and Cuba and millions came. Becoming a full citizen was an easy process of filling out paperwork over a five-year span.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas J. Archdeacon, ''European Immigration from the Colonial Era to the 1920s: A Historical Perspective'' (2000) [https://americansall.org/sites/default/files/877-EUROPEAN%20AM%20C_T%20MedLoRes_0.pdf online].&lt;/ref&gt;

However, new Asian arrivals were not welcome. Restrictions were imposed on most Chinese immigrants in the 1880s and informal restrictions on most Japanese in 1907. By 1924, it was difficult for any Asian to enter the United States, but children born in the United States to Asian parents were full citizens. The restrictions were ended on the Chinese in the 1940s and on other Asians in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=Erika|date=2007|title=The "Yellow Peril" and Asian Exclusion in the Americas|journal=Pacific Historical Review|volume=76|issue=4|pages=537–562|doi=10.1525/phr.2007.76.4.537}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nationalism in the contemporary United States ===
Nationalism and [[Americanism (ideology)|Americanism]] remain topics in the modern United States. Political scientist Paul McCartney, for instance, argues that as a nation defined by a creed and sense of mission Americans tend to equate their interests with those of humanity, which in turn informs their global posture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | url=http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p65633_index.html | title=The Bush Doctrine and American Nationalism | accessdate=February 6, 2011 | author=McCartney, Paul | date=August 28, 2002 | conference=Annual meeting of the American Political Science Association | publisher=American Political Science Association | id=McCartney-2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; In certain cases, it may be considered a form of [[ethnocentrism]] and [[American exceptionalism]].

Due to the distinctive circumstances involved throughout history in [[American politics]], its nationalism has developed in regards to both loyalty to a set of liberal, universal political ideals and a perceived accountability to propagate those principles globally. Acknowledging the conception of the United States as accountable for spreading liberal change and promoting democracy throughout the world's politics and governance has defined practically all of [[American foreign policy]]. Therefore, democracy promotion is not just another measure of foreign policy, but it is rather the fundamental characteristic of their national identity and political determination.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Monten, "The Roots of the Bush Doctrine: Power, Nationalism, and Democracy Promotion in U.S. Strategy" 29.4 (2005): 112-156 [https://jstor.org/stable/4137499] in JSTOR&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[September 11 attacks]] of 2001 led to a wave of nationalist expression in the United States. This was accompanied by a rise in military enlistment that included not only lower-income Americans, but also [[American middle class|middle-class]] and [[American upper class|upper-class citizens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritage.org/Research/NationalSecurity/em987.cfm|title=The Demographics of Military Enlistment After 9/11|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Varieties of American nationalism====
In their article in the ''[[American Sociological Review]]'', "Varieties of American Popular Nationalism", sociologists Bart Bonikowski and [[Paul DiMaggio]] report on research findings supporting the existence of at least four kinds of American nationalists, including, from smallest to largest groups: (1) the disengaged, (2) creedal or civic nationalists, (3) ardent nationalists, and (4) restrictive nationalists.&lt;ref name=varieties&gt;Bonikowski, Bart and [[Paul DiMaggio|DiMaggio, Paul]] (2016) [http://scholar.harvard.edu/files/bonikowski/files/bonikowski_and_dimaggio_-_varieties_of_american_popular_nationalism.pdf "Varieties of American Popular Nationalism"]. ''[[American Sociological Review]]'', v.81 n.5 pp.949–980.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Bonikowski and Dimaggio's analysis of these four groups found that ''ardent nationalists'' made up about 24% of their study, and was the larger of the two groups they describe as "extreme". Members of this group identified closely with the United States, were very proud of their country, and associated themselves strongly with factors of national hubris. However, although they felt that it was important that a "true American" speak English, and had lived most of their life in the U.S., they rejected the necessity of being Christian or being born in the country.  Nevertheless, ardent nationalists perceived Jews, Muslims, agnostics and naturalized citizens as something less than truly American. The second class that Bonikowski and DiMaggio referred to as "extreme" was the smallest of the four classes, making up 17% of their respondents. ''The disengaged'' showed low levels of pride in the institutions of government and did not fully identify themselves with the United States. Their lack of pride extended to American democracy, American history, the political equality in the U.S., and the country's political influence in the world. This group was the least nationalistic of all four groups identified.&lt;ref name=varieties /&gt;

The two remaining classes were less homogeneous in their responses than were ardent nationalists and the disengaged. ''Restrictive nationalists'' had low levels of pride in American and its institutions, but defined a "true American" in ways that were markedly "exclusionary". This group was the largest of the four, including 38% of the study's respondents. While their levels of national identification and pride were moderate, they espoused beliefs that restricted who they considered to be "true Americans", excluding, for instance, non-Christians. The final group identified were ''creedal nationalists'', who made of 22% of the study.  This group believes in liberal values, is proud of the United States, and held the fewest restrictions on who could be considered to be a true American. They identified closely with their country, which they felt "very close" to, and were proud if its achievements.  Bonikowski and Dimaggio dubbed the group "creedal" because their beliefs most closely approximated the precepts of what is widely taken to be the [[American creed]].&lt;ref name=varieties /&gt;

'''''Anatomy of Criticism: Four Essays''''' ([[Princeton University Press]], 1957) is a book by Canadian literary critic and theorist, [[Herman Northrop Frye|Northrop Frye]], which attempts to formulate an overall view of the scope, theory, principles, and techniques of [[literary criticism]] derived exclusively from literature. Frye consciously omits all specific and practical criticism, instead offering classically inspired theories of modes, symbols, myths and genres, in what he termed "an interconnected group of suggestions." The literary approach proposed by Frye in ''Anatomy'' was highly influential in the decades before [[deconstruction|deconstructivist criticism]] and other expressions of [[postmodernism]] came to prominence in American academia circa 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Frank Lentricchia]], ''After the New Criticism'' (1980), in which Chapter One, 'The Place of Northrop Frye's ''Anatomy of Criticism'' ', begins by calling the book 'monumental'.&lt;/ref&gt;

Frye's four essays are sandwiched between a "Polemical Introduction" and a "Tentative Conclusion." The four essays are titled "Historical Criticism: A Theory of Modes", "Ethical Criticism: a Theory of [[Symbol]]s", "[[Archetypal]] Criticism: A Theory of [[mythology|Myth]]s", and "Rhetorical Criticism: A Theory of [[Genre]]s."

==Contents==
===Polemical Introduction===
The purpose of the introduction is to defend the need for literary criticism, to distinguish the nature of genuine literary criticism from other forms of criticism, and to clarify the difference between direct experience of literature and the systematic study of literary criticism.

There are a number of reasons why the introduction is labeled as a '[[polemic]]'. In defending the need for literary criticism, Frye opposes a notion common to [[Tolstoy]] and [[Romanticism|Romantic]] thought that 'natural taste' is superior to scholarly learning (and by extension, criticism). Frye also accuses a number of methods of criticism (e.g. [[Marxist]], [[Freud]]ian, [[Carl Jung|Jung]]ian, [[Neoclassicism|Neo-classical]], etc.) as being embodiments of the deterministic fallacy. He is not opposed to these ideologies in particular, but sees the application of any external, ready-made ideology to literature as a departure from genuine criticism. This results in subjecting a work of literature to an individual's pet philosophy and an elevation or demotion of authors according to their conformity to the pet philosophy.

Another point is to distinguish the difference between personal taste and genuine criticism. Personal taste is too easily swayed by the prevailing morals, values and tastes of the critic's society at that point in history. If taste succumbs entirely to such social forces, the result is the same as that of consciously adopting an external ideology described above. Yet even if there is a consensus among critics that the works of [[John Milton]] are more fruitful than [[R. D. Blackmore]] (to use Frye's example), a critic contributes little by saying so. In other words, value judgments contribute little to meaningful criticism.

In place of meaningless criticism, Frye proposes a genuine literary criticism which draws its method from the body of literature itself. Literary criticism ought to be a systematic study of works of literature, just as physics is of nature and history is of human action. Frye makes the explicit assumption that in order for systematic study to be possible, the body of literature must already possess a systematic nature. Frye claims that we know very little about this system as yet and that the systematic study of literature has progressed little since [[Aristotle]].

Frye concludes his introduction by addressing the weaknesses of his argument. He mentions that the introduction is a polemic, but written in first person to acknowledge the individual nature of his views. He concedes that the following essays can only give a preliminary, and likely inexact, glimpse of the system of literature. He admits to making sweeping generalities that will often prove false in light of particular examples. Finally, he stresses that while many feel an "emotional repugnance" to schematization of [[poetry]], the schematization should be regarded as an aspect of criticism, not the vibrant, personal, direct experience of the work itself—much as the geologist turns away from his or her systematic work to enjoy the beauty of the mountains.

==="Historical Criticism: Theory of Modes"===
Frye's systemization of literature begins with three aspects of poetry given by [[Aristotle]] in his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'': ''mythos'' (plot), ''ethos'' (characterization/setting), and ''dianoia'' (theme/idea). Frye sees works of literature as lying somewhere on a continuum between being [[Plot (narrative)|plot]] driven, as in most [[fiction]], and [[idea]] driven, as in [[essay]]s and [[Lyrics|lyric]]al poetry. The First essay begins by exploring the different aspects of fiction (subdivided into tragic and comic) in each mode and ends with a similar discussion of thematic literature.

Frye divides his study of tragic, comic, and thematic literature into five "modes", each identified with a specific literary epoch: mythic, romantic, high [[mimesis|mimetic]], low mimetic, and ironic. This categorization is a representation of ''[[ethos]]'', or characterization and relates to how the protagonist is portrayed in respect to the rest of humanity and the protagonist's environment. Frye suggests that Classical civilizations progressed historically through the development of these modes, and that something similar happened in Western civilization during medieval and modern times. He speculates that contemporary fiction may be undergoing a return to myth, completing a full circle through the five modes. Frye argues that when irony is pushed to extremes, it returns to the mode of myth; this concept of the ''recursion'' of [[cyclic history|historical cycles]] is familiar from [[Giambattista Vico]]&lt;ref&gt;Cotrupi, Caterina Nella [https://books.google.com/books?id=rh8gcNF9YXkC ''Northrop Frye and the poetics of process''] p.18&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Oswald Spengler]].&lt;ref&gt;Frye (1991) [https://books.google.com/books?id=RgcnAQAAIAAJ ''Spiritus Mundi: Essays on Literature, Myth, and Society''] p.113 quotation: {{quotation|The demonic aspect of historical time is clearer in Vico than in Spengler, though Vico came later into my readig. In Vico there is also a projecting of authority, first on gods, then on "heroes" or human leaders, then on the people themselves. Vico lived at a time when there had been no permanently successful example of a democracy, and from his study of Roman history he concluded that the people cannot recover the authority they project on others, and hence the third age of the people is followed by a ''ricorso'' that starts the cycle over again. In Spengler there is no general cyclical movement of this kind, but there is one latent in his argument. Spengler's sense of a historically finite culture, exploiting and exhausting a certain range of imaginative possibilities, provided the basis for the conception of modes outlined in the first essay of Anatomy of Criticism. I soon scrapped his loaded term "decline" for a more neutral conception of cultural aging, but his vision of cultural history superseded the onward- and-upward people I had read still earlier in youth, such as Bernard Shaw and HG Wells, who had obviously got it wrong.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://pages.prodigy.net/aesir/aoc.htm review]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050403220409/http://pages.prodigy.net/aesir/aoc.htm |date=April 3, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tragedy is concerned with the hero's separation from society.
*Mythic tragedy deals with the death of gods.
*Romantic tragedy features elegies mourning the death of heroes such as [[King Arthur|Arthur]] or [[Beowulf]].
*High mimetic tragedy presents the death of a noble human such as [[Othello]] or [[Oedipus]].
*Low mimetic tragedy shows the death or sacrifice of an ordinary human being and evokes pathos, as with [[Thomas Hardy]]'s [[Tess of the d'Urbervilles|Tess]] or [[Henry James]]'s [[Daisy Miller]].
*The ironic mode often shows the death or suffering of a protagonist who is both weak and pitiful compared to the rest of humanity and the protagonist's environment; [[Franz Kafka]]'s works provide many examples of such. At other times, the protagonist is not necessarily weaker than the average person yet suffers severe persecution at the hands of a deranged society. [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]]'s Hester Prynne, and Hardy's Tess exemplify this treatment.

Comedy is concerned with integration of society.
*Mythic comedy deals with acceptance into the society of gods, often through a number of trials as with [[Hercules]] or through [[salvation]] or assumption as in the [[Bible]].
*In romantic comic modes, the setting is pastoral or idyllic, and there is an integration of the hero with an idealized simplified form of nature.
*High mimetic comedy involves a strong central protagonist who constructs his or her own society by brute force, fending off all opposition until the protagonist ends up with all honor and riches due him or her—the plays of [[Aristophanes]] or something like [[Shakespeare]]'s [[Prospero]] are examples.
*Low mimetic comedy often shows the social elevation of the hero or heroine and often ends in marriage.
*Ironic comedy is perhaps more difficult, and Frye devotes a good deal more space to this than the other comedic modes. At one extreme, ironic comedy borders on savagery, the inflicting of pain on a helpless victim. Some examples of this include tales of [[Lynching|lynch mob]]s, [[Crime fiction|murder mysteries]], or human sacrifice. Yet ironic comedy may also offer biting satire of a society replete with snobbery. It may even depict a protagonist rejected by society (thus failing the typical comic reintegration) yet who appears wiser than the rejecting society. Aristophanes, [[Ben Jonson]], [[Molière]], [[Henry Fielding]], [[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]], and [[Graham Greene]] offer examples of the wide range of ironic comic possibility.

Finally, Frye explores the nature of thematic literature in each mode. Here, the intellectual content is more important than the plot, so these modes are organized by what is considered more authoritative or educational at the time. Also, these modes tend to organize by societal structure.
*In the mythical mode scripture, literature claiming divine inspiration is prevalent.
*In the romantic, the gods have retreated to the sky and it is up to chroniclers in a nomadic society to remember the lists of names of the patriarchs, the proverbs, traditions, charms, deeds, etc.
*In the high mimetic mode society is structured around a capital city, and "national" epics such as ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'' and ''[[The Lusiad]]'' are typical.
*In the low mimetic, thematic exposition tends toward individualism and romanticism. The individual author's own thoughts and ideas are now the center of authority, as instanced by [[William Wordsworth]]'s ''[[The Prelude|Prelude]]''.
*Finally, in the ironic mode, the poet figures as a mere observer rather than an authoritative commentator, producing writing that tends to emphasize discontinuity and anti-epiphany. [[T. S. Eliot]]'s ''[[The Waste Land]]'' and [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'' exemplify this thematic mode.

==="Ethical Criticism: Theory of Symbols"===
Now that Frye has established his theory of modes, he proposes five levels, or ''phases'', of symbolism, each phase independently possessing its own ''mythos'', ethos, and ''dianoia'' as laid out in the first essay. These phases are based on the four levels of [[medieval allegory]] (the first two phases constituting the first level). Also, Frye relates the five phases with the ages of man laid out in the first essay. Frye defines a literary symbol as: "[A]ny unit of any literary structure that can be isolated for critical attention."

Symbolic phases:
* Literal/descriptive (motifs and signs)
* Formal (image)
* Mythical (archetype)
* Anagogic (monad)

The '''descriptive''' phase exhibits the centrifugal, or outward, property of a symbol. For example, when a word such as 'cat' evokes a definition, image, experience or any property connected with the word 'cat' external to the literary context of the particular usage, we have the word taken in the descriptive sense. Frye labels any such symbol a ''sign''. He does not define the sign beyond this sense of pointing to the external, nor does he refer to any particular semiotic theory. In opposition to the sign stands the ''motif'' which is a symbol taken in the '''literal''' phase. This phase demonstrates the inward, or centripetal, direction of meaning, best described as the contextual meaning of the symbol. To Frye, ''literal'' means nearly the opposite of its usage in common speech; to say that something "literally" means something generally involves referring to a definition external to the text. Instead, ''literal'' refers to the symbol's meaning in its specific literary situation while ''descriptive'' refers to personal connotation and conventional definition. Finally, Frye draws an analogy between rhythm and harmony with the literal and descriptive phases respectively. The literal phase tends to be horizontal, dependent on what comes before and after the symbol while the descriptive phase tends to be laid out in space, having external meanings that vary in nearness to the contextual meaning.

Frye next introduces the '''formal''' phase, embodied by the image, in order to define the layer of meaning that results from the interplay of the harmony and rhythm of the signs and motifs. The  most frequently repeated imagery sets the tone of the work (as with the color red in ''[[Macbeth]]''), with less repeated imagery working in contrast with this tonal background. This section of the essay gives a faithful representation of literary formalism (also known as [[New Criticism]]). Frye's representation of formalism here is unique; however, its setting as part of the larger system of literary criticism Frye outlines in the entire work. The notion of form (and perhaps Frye's literal phase) relies heavily on the assumption of inherent meaning within the text—a point contested by deconstructionist critics.

The '''mythical''' phase is the treatment of a symbol as an archetype. This concept relates most closely with [[intertextuality]] and considers the symbol in a work as interconnected with similar symbolism throughout the entire body of literature. While Frye deals with myths and archetypes from a broader perspective in the third essay, in this section he focuses on the critical method of tracing a symbol's heritage through literary works both prior and subsequent to the work in question. Frye argues that convention is a vital part of literature and that copyright  is deleterious to the process of literary creation. Frye points to the use of convention in Shakespeare and Milton as examples to strengthen his argument that even verbatim copying of text and plot does not entail a death of creativity. Further, Frye argues that romantic, anti-conventional writers such as [[Walt Whitman]] tend to follow convention anyway. In criticism, the study of the archetypal phase of a symbol is akin to the "nature" perspective in the psychological debate over [[nature versus nurture]]. Rather than viewing the symbol as a unique achievement of the author or some inherent quality of the text, the archetypeal phase situates the symbol in its society of literary kindred as a product of its conventional forebears.

Finally, Frye proposes an '''anagogic''' phase wherein a symbol is treated as a monad. The anagogic level of medieval allegory treated a text as expressing the highest spiritual meaning. For example, Dante's Beatrice in the [[Divine Comedy]] would represent the bride of Christ. Frye makes the argument that not only is there a lateral connection of archetypes through intertextuality, but that there is a transcendent almost spiritual unity within the body of literature. Frye describes the anagogic in literature as "the imitation of infinite social action and infinite human thought, the mind of a man who is all men, the universal creative word which is all words."

==="Archetypal Criticism: Theory of Myths"===
Frye begins the essay regarding [[myth]] as the source of all [[literature]] (as a visual, auditory and textual art form), paintings (as visual art form) and music (as an auditory art form). The underlying structures and patterns of all these forms are similar, though they have a unique style of their own.

The third essay is the culmination of Frye's theory in that it unites the elements of characterization and each of the five symbolic phases presented in the first two essays into an organic whole. This whole is organized around a metaphor of human desire and frustration as manifested in the [[Great Chain of Being]] (divine, human, animal, vegetable, mineral and water) by analogy to the four [[season]]s.

At one pole we have apocalyptic imagery which typifies the revelation of [[heaven]] and ultimate [[wikt:fulfillment|fulfillment]] of human desire. In this state, the literary structure points toward unification of all things in a single analogical symbol. The ultimate of the divine is the deity, of the human is [[Christ]] (or any other being that embodies the oneness of humanity in its spiritual culmination), of the animal is the [[Domestic sheep|lamb]], of the vegetable is the [[Tree of life|Tree of Life]] or [[vine]], and of the mineral is the [[New Jerusalem|heavenly Jerusalem]] or city of God.

At the opposite pole lies [[demon]]ic imagery which typifies the unfulfillment, perverion, or opposition of human desire. In this state, things tend toward [[anarchy]] or [[tyranny]]. The divine is an angry, inscrutable God demanding sacrifice, the human is the tyrannical [[anti-christ|anti-Christ]], the animal is a predator such as a [[lion]], the vegetable is the evil wood as found at the beginning of Dante's ''[[Divine Comedy|Inferno]]'' or Hawthorne's "[[Young Goodman Brown]]", and the city is the [[dystopia]] embodied by [[George Orwell|Orwell]]'s ''1984'' or [[Kafka]]'s ''[[The Castle (novel)|The Castle]]''.

Finally we have the analogical imagery, or more simply, depictions of states that are similar to paradise or [[hell]], but not identical. There is a great deal of variety in the imagery of these structures, but tame animals and wise rulers are common in structures analogical to the apocalyptic (analogy of innocence), while predatory aristocrats and masses living in squalor characterize analogy to the demonic (analogy of experience).

Frye then identifies the mythical mode with the apocalyptic, the ironic with the demonic, and the romantic and [[Mimesis|low mimetic]] with their respective analogies. The [[Mimesis|high mimetic]], then, occupies the center of all four. This ordering allows Frye to place the modes in a circular structure and point to the cyclical nature of myth and archetypes. In this setting, literature represents the natural cycle of birth, growth, maturity, decline, death, [[resurrection]], rebirth, and the repetition of the cycle. The remainder of the chapter deals with the cycle of the four seasons as embodied by four mythoi: [[comedy]], [[Romance (heroic literature)|romance]], [[tragedy]], and [[irony]] or [[satire]].

==="Rhetorical Criticism: Theory of Genres"===
In the first three essays, Frye deals mainly with the first three elements of Aristotle's elements of poetry (i.e. mythos, ethos, dianoia). In the fourth essay, he explores the last three elements:
* ''melos'' - the element dealing with the tonal, musical aspect of literature
* ''lexis'' - the written word, lying somewhere between musical and visual aspects. It may be referred to as diction (ear) or imagery (eye) depending on the critical focus.
* ''opsis'' - the element dealing with visual aspects of literature

Whereas mythos is the verbal imitation of action and dianoia the verbal imitation of thought (ethos being composed of the two), melos and opsis (with lexis composed of the two) correspond, though seen from a different (rhetorical) perspective. Frye identifies the connection as such: "The world of social action and event . . . has a particularly strong association with the ear. . . . The world of individual thought and idea has a correspondingly close connection with the eye . . ." (Frye, 243).

Rhetoric means two things: ornamental (opsis) speech and persuasive (melos) speech. Rhetorical criticism, then, is the exploration of literature in the light of melos, opsis, and their interplay as manifested in lexis.

The ''radical of presentation''—the relation (or idealized relation) between author and audience—is a further consideration. Difference in genre relies not on topical considerations (science fiction, romance, mystery), nor in length (e.g. epics are long, lyrics are short), but in the radical of presentation. As such, Frye proposes a total of four distinct genres:
* epos - Author speaks directly to audience (e.g. story telling, formal speech).
* fiction - Author and audience are hidden from each other (e.g. most novels).
* drama - Author is hidden from the audience; audience experiences content directly.
* lyric - Audience is "hidden" from author; that is, the speaker is "overheard" by hearers.

These four genres form the organizing principle of the essay, first examining the distinctive kind of rhythm of each, then looking at specific forms of each more closely. As Frye describes each genre, he explains the function of melos and opsis in each. To understand Frye's melos, it is important to note{{According to whom|date=May 2011}} his counter-intuitive usage of the term "musical". He contends that the common usage of the term is inaccurate for purposes of criticism, drawn from analogy with harmony, a stable relationship. Music, however, does not consist of a plastic, static, continuously stable relationship, but rather a series of dissonances resolving at the end into a stable relationship. Poetry containing little dissonance, then, has more in common with the plastic arts than with music.

The original presentation of the epic was ''ta epe'' (that which is spoken), and when an author, speaker, or storyteller addresses a visible audience directly, we have epos. The rhythm of epos is that of recurrence (i.e. accent, meter, sound patterns). These are the rhythms most commonly associated with poetry.

"Fiction" is a vague term which Frye uses to avoid introducing too many new terms. Part of the difficulty comes from fact that this is the only of the four genres which has no precedent in antiquity. He acknowledges having used the term previously in a different sense. In this essay, the term refers to literature in which the author addresses the audience through a book, or more simply stated, prose. The rhythm of prose is that of continuity of meaning.

Drama lies halfway between epos and fiction, or more accurately, its diction must fit the setting and the character. Some characters may be melos-oriented, speaking in meter or with various rhetorical effects in song and banter. Others may be opsis-oriented, speaking more in prose and conveying ideological content. Most characters alternate according to the dramatic situation. Such a marriage of the appropriate language with the character and setting (ethos) defines a rhythm of decorum, the distinctive rhythm of drama.

Classical lyrical poetry often presents a shepherd speaking of his love; he is overheard by his audience. However, the distinctiveness of lyric comes more from its peculiar rhythm than from this radical of representation. Frye describes this rhythm as associative rather than logical and is the stuff of dreams and the subconscious. It is closely related to the chant, and though it is found in all literature, it is more apparent in certain kinds of literature than others. At this point Frye suggests a connection between the four historical modes and the four genres. In this sense, the lyrical is typical of the ironic age—just as the ironic protagonist has turned away from society, the lyrical poet makes utterances without regard to the audience. The lyrical rhythm is very clearly seen in Joyce's ''[[Finnegans Wake]]'', a work based almost entirely on associative babbles and dream utterance.

==Miscellaneous==
* The Latin dedication at the beginning, "Helenae Uxori" is to Northrop's wife, Helen.
* Frye's [[Green World]] theory developed
* [[Bergson]]'s ''[[Laughter (Bergson book)|Laughter]]'' may provide a complementary view on [[comedy]].
* The book evolved out of an introduction to [[Edmund Spenser|Spenser]]'s ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'': "the introduction to Spenser became an introduction to the theory of [[allegory]]" Frye allowed (p. vii).

'''Appropriation of knowledge''' is the process of constructing [[knowledge]] from social and cultural sources, and integrating it into pre-existing schemas.&lt;ref&gt;Billett (1998), Johnson et al (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[developmental process]] that comes about through socially formulated, goal-directed, and tool-mediated actions.&lt;ref&gt;Cook et al (2002), Grossman et al (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; Appropriation draws on the developmental theories of [[Jean Piaget|Piaget]] and [[Lev Vygotsky|Vygotsky]], as both the cognitive and social-constructivist views of learning are equally emphasized.&lt;ref&gt;Billett (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Henry Jenkins]], discusses appropriation as "the ability to meaningfully sample and remix the content(s)"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jenkins|first=Henry|title=Multiculturalism, Appropriation, and the New Media Literacies|url=http://henryjenkins.org/2009/06/multiculturalism_appropriation.html|publisher=Henry Jenkins|accessdate=19 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; of our culture for new expressive purposes. Jenkins noted that many literature classes in schools are embracing appropriation. A common example of appropriation at its finest is [[Ricardo Pitts-Wiley]]'s "Moby-Dick: Then and Now", a contemporary reworking of Herman Melville's [[Moby-Dick]] narrative. Fundamental to appropriation is the idea that knowledge is socially constructed and that the student plays an active role in its construction.&lt;ref&gt;Cook et al (2002), Grossman et al (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; Appropriation has occurred when the student has adapted the information in a way that is meaningful to them and they can use the knowledge as their own.&lt;ref&gt;Cook et al (2002), Grossman et al (1999), Johnson et al (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activity theory==

Appropriation in [[education]] is often understood and analyzed through [[activity theory]]. This theory was developed by [[Aleksei N. Leontiev]] and focuses on understanding the socio-cultural context (specifically the setting) learning occurs in.&lt;ref&gt;Cook et al (2002), Hung (1999), Johnson et al (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; Activity theory is predicated on the assumption that a person's frameworks for thinking are developed and carried out in specific settings,&lt;ref&gt;Grossman et al (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; and that these settings mediate [[cognitive development]].&lt;ref&gt;Johnson et al (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; Since appropriation also places a strong emphasis on setting, these theories complement each other when being used to analyze learning environments.

==Process of appropriating knowledge==

Hung&lt;ref&gt;Hung (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; has developed steps through which the appropriation of knowledge usually occurs. The process is as follows:

; 1. Growing into {{Interlanguage link multi|social dependency|wikt|3=dependency|lt=dependency}} (''submitting''): the [[student]] recognizes the differences between their beliefs/knowledge and the beliefs/knowledge of the [[teacher]]. The student accepts the teacher as the leader and submits to their beliefs, knowledge and rules.
; 2. Dependency (''mirroring''): The student adapts strategies to help submit to the beliefs, knowledge and rules of the teacher. The student questions the teacher and other students and begins to co-construct and negotiate meanings.
; 3. Growing out of dependency (''constructing''): the student experiments with the beliefs, knowledge and rules co-constructed with the teacher and other students and uses these ideas outside of the classroom. The student discovers patterns, ideas, concepts and beliefs inherent to the [[learning community]] and applies them to other environments.

==Five degrees of appropriation==

Through research with English teachers, Grossman ''et al.''&lt;ref&gt;Grossman et al (1999)&lt;/ref&gt; developed a theory to describe the varying levels of appropriation. The degrees 
; Lack of appropriation: the student has not appropriated the knowledge. This may occur because the [[concept]] being taught is too difficult for the student to comprehend or is too foreign to fit into the learner’s prior frameworks at that point in their development.
; Appropriating a label: the student knows the name of the concept but knows none of the features.
; Appropriating surface features: the student knows most of the features of the concept, but does not understand how those features contribute to the conceptual whole.
; Appropriating conceptual underpinnings: the student grasps the theoretical basis that informs and motivates the use of the concept and is able to make use of the concept in new contexts and for solving new problems. This is the level of appropriation that teachers and students should strive for.
; Achieving mastery: the student has the skills to use the concept effectively and to its fullest effect. This should also be strived for, but would likely to years of practice to achieve.

===Factors affecting the degree of appropriation===
There are a variety of factors that can affect the level of appropriation that the student achieves. Some of these factors are:

*The role the student plays in the [[learning process]]: students that play an active role in their learning process are more likely to appropriate knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Grossman et al (1999), Johnson et al (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[social context]] of learning: this refers to the environment where the student learning, the values and expectations implied in the learning environment, how the knowledge is introduced by the teacher, and the social practices that occur in the learning environment. A more positive learning environment will most likely result in higher degrees of appropriation.&lt;ref&gt;Grossman et al (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;
*Individual characteristics of the student: this includes the beliefs, goals, expectations, and motives of the student. The closer a student’s values align with those of the teacher, the more likely a student will appropriate the knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Billett (1998), Grossman et al (1999), Johnson et al (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; A student’s motives also affect the degree of appropriation. Students who are intrinsically motivated are more likely to reach a higher level of appropriation.&lt;ref&gt;Poleman (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;
*Interest and knowledge of the teacher: a teacher who appears more interested and/ or knowledgeable in the content being taught is more likely to influence appropriation in their students.&lt;ref&gt;Poleman (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outcomes of appropriation==

Through appropriation students construct their own versions of knowledge, allowing [[internalization]] of the information they have learned.&lt;ref&gt;Billett (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; Their beliefs and behaviours concerning the concepts learned also change.&lt;ref&gt;Poleman (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; These transformations alter the student’s conception of the information, which will affect how that information is given to others interacting with the student.&lt;ref&gt;Billett (1998), Cook et al (2002), Johnson et al (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; How knowledge is transferred from one person to the next is an important aspect of appropriation and demonstrates the collaborative aspect of appropriation, where knowledge is constantly being negotiated with other.&lt;ref&gt;Billett (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; Collaboratively, students and teachers construct knowledge in a way that is meaningful to them.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2097">'''Art Mac Cumhaigh''' (1738–1773) was, along with [[Cathal Buí Mac Giolla Ghunna]], [[Peadar Ó Doirnín]] and [[Séamas Dall Mac Cuarta]], among the most celebrated of the south [[Ulster]] and north [[Leinster]] poets in the eighteenth century. As with the latter two he was part of the [[Kingdom of Oriel|Airgíalla]] tradition of poetry and song.

It is commonly believed that Mac Cumhaigh was born in [[Creggan, County Armagh]], where a branch of the [[Uí Néill]] had been the traditional patrons of the poets under the old order.  However, the most comprehensive research into Mac Cumhaigh's life and works&lt;ref&gt;Ó Fiaich, 1973&lt;/ref&gt; could only suggest a birthplace on or near the Louth/Armagh border in or near the parish of Creggan. Mac Cumhaigh eked out a living as a ''[[spailpín]]'', or travelling labourer. [[Seán Ó Tuama]] and [[Thomas Kinsella]] remark about Mac Cumhaigh's most famous poem, ''Úr-Chill An Chreagáin'', that 'in its simple innocence is a more attractive [[aisling]], perhaps, than some more polished vision-songs by the late eighteenth century Munster poets.'&lt;ref&gt;Seán Ó Tuama and Thomas Kinsella, ''An Duanaire 1600-1900: Poems of the Dispossessed'', p. 177.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike other works of [[aisling]] poetry, that poem does not mention the [[James Francis Edward Stuart|Stuart Pretender]], nor does it hold out hope of foreign help coming to free Ireland.

'''Baroque dance''' is [[dance]] of the [[Baroque]] era (roughly 1600–1750),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.baroque.org/baroque/terms|title=A Baroque Glossary – Music of the Baroque|website=www.baroque.org|access-date=2016-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; closely linked with [[Baroque music]], theatre and opera.

== English country dance ==
{{Further|Country dance}}
The majority of surviving choreographies from the period are [[English country dance]]s, such as those in the many editions of [[John Playford|Playford's]] ''[[The Dancing Master]]''.  Playford only gives the floor patterns of the dances, with no indication of the steps. However, other sources of the period, such as the writings of the French dancing-masters [[Raoul Auger Feuillet|Feuillet]] and Lorin, indicate that steps more complicated than simple walking were used at least some of the time.

English country dance survived well beyond the Baroque era and eventually spread in various forms across Europe and its colonies, and to all levels of society.

== The French Noble style ==
{{Further|French ballet}}
[[Image:Ballet de la nuit 1653.jpg|thumb|200px|right|A costume design for Louis XIV as The Rising Sun, from the final entrée of ''[[Ballet de la Nuit|Le Ballet de la Nuit]]'' (1653)]]
The great innovations in dance in the 17th century originated at the French court under [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], and it is here that we see the first clear stylistic ancestor of [[classical ballet]].  The same basic technique was used both at social events, and as theatrical dance in court ballets and at public theaters.  The style of dance is commonly known to modern scholars as the ''French noble style'' or ''belle danse'' (French, literally "beautiful dance"), however it is often referred to casually as ''baroque dance'' in spite of the existence of other theatrical and social dance styles during the baroque era.

Primary sources include more than three hundred choreographies in [[Beauchamp-Feuillet notation]],&lt;ref&gt;Little, Meredith Ellis and Marsh, Carol G. ''La Danse Noble, An Inventory of Dances and Sources'', (Broude Brothers Ltd, 1992) {{ISBN|0-8450-0092-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lancelot, Francine, ''La Belle Dance: Catalogue Raisonné'', (Van Dieren Editeur, 1996) {{ISBN|2-911087-02-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as manuals by [[Raoul Handsome Auger Feuillet]] and [[Pierre Rameau]] in France, [[Kellom Tomlinson]] and [[John Weaver (dancer)|John Weaver]] in England, and [[Gottfried Taubert]] in Germany.  This wealth of evidence has allowed modern scholars and dancers to recreate the style, although areas of controversy still exist.  The standard modern introduction is Hilton.&lt;ref&gt;Hilton, Wendy, ''Dance and Music of Court and Theater: Selected Writings of Wendy Hilton'' (Pendragon Press, 1997) {{ISBN|0-945193-98-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

French dance types include:
* [[Allemande]]
* [[Bourrée]]
* [[Canarie (dance)|Canarie]] (canary)
* [[Chaconne]]
* [[Courante|(French) courante]]
* [[Entrée grave]]
* [[Forlane]] (forlana)
* [[Gavotte]]
* [[Gigue]]
* [[Loure]] (slow gigue)
* [[Minuet|Menuet]] (minuet)
* [[Bal-musette|Musette]]
* [[Passacaglia|Passacaille]] (passacaglia)
* [[Passepied]]
* [[Rigaudon]]
* [[Sarabande]]
* [[Tambourin]]

The English, working in the French style, added their own [[hornpipe]] to this list.

Many of these dance types are familiar from [[European classical music|baroque music]], perhaps most spectacularly in the stylized [[suite (music)|suite]]s of [[Johann Sebastian Bach|J. S. Bach]].&lt;ref&gt;Little, Meredith and Jenne, Natalie. ''Dance and the Music of J.S. Bach'' (Indiana University Press, 1991, 2001) {{ISBN|0-253-21464-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Note, however, that the [[allemande]]s, that occur in these suites do not correspond to a French dance from the same period.

== Theatrical dance ==
The French noble style was danced both at social events and by professional dancers in theatrical productions such as opera-ballets and court entertainments. However, 18th-century theatrical dance had at least two other styles: comic or grotesque, and semi-serious.&lt;ref&gt;Fairfax, Edmund. ''The Styles of Eighteenth-Century Ballet'' (Scarecrow Press, 2003) {{ISBN|0-8108-4698-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harris-Warrick, Rebecca and Brown, Bruce Alan, editors. ''The Grotesque Dancer on the Eighteenth Century Stage'' (The University of Wisconsin Press, 2005) {{ISBN|0-299-20354-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other social dance styles ==
Other dance styles, such as the Italian and Spanish dances of the period are much less well studied than either English country dance or the French style.  The general picture seems to be that during most of the 17th century, a style of late [[Renaissance dance]] was widespread, but as time progressed, French ballroom dances such as the minuet were widely adopted at fashionable courts. Beyond this, the evolution and cross-fertilisation of dance styles is an area of ongoing research.

== Modern reconstructions ==
[[File:Historical dancing baroque at time travellers ball earthly delights dance group.JPG|thumb|Young ladies enjoying a Time Travelers' Ball – dances from the 15th to early 20th century including Baroque]]
The revival of baroque music in the 1960s and '70s sparked renewed interest in 17th and 18th century dance styles. While some 300 of these dances had been preserved in [[Beauchamp-Feuillet notation]], it wasn't until the mid-20th century that serious scholarship commenced in deciphering the notation and reconstructing the dances.

Perhaps best known among these pioneers was Britain's Melusine Wood, who published several books on historical dancing in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, Melusine, ''More Historical Dances'', (Imperial Soc. Dancing, 1956) {{ISBN|0-900484-12-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wood passed her research on to her student Belinda Quirey, and also to Pavlova Company ballerina and choreographer Mary Skeaping (1902–1984). The latter became well known for her reconstructions of baroque ballets for London's "Ballet for All" company in the 1960s.

The leading figures of the second generation of historical dance research include Shirley Wynne and her Baroque Dance Ensemble which was founded at Ohio State University in the early 1970s and Wendy Hilton (1931–2002), a student of Belinda Quirey  who supplemented the work of Melusine Wood with her own research into original sources.&lt;ref&gt;Hilton, Wendy, ''Dance of Court and Theater: The French Noble Style 1690-1725'' (Princeton Book Company, 1981) {{ISBN|0-916622-09-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A native of Britain, Hilton arrived in the U.S. in 1969 joining the faculty of the [[Juilliard School]] in 1972 and establishing her own baroque dance workshop at [[Stanford University]] in 1974 which endured for more than 25 years.

Catherine Turocy (b. circa 1950) began her studies in Baroque dance in 1971 as a student of dance historian Shirley Wynne. She founded [[The New York Baroque Dance Company]] in 1976 with Ann Jacoby, and the company has since toured internationally. In 1982/83 as part of the French national celebration of Jean Philippe Rameau's 300th birthday, Turocy choreographed the first production of [[Jean-Philippe Rameau]]'s ''Les Boréades'' - it was never performed during the composer's lifetime.  This French supported production with John Eliot Gardiner, conductor, and his orchestra was directed by Jean Louis Martinoty. Turocy has been decorated as Chevalier in the [[Ordre des Arts et des Lettres]] by the French government.

In 1973, French dance historian [[Francine Lancelot]] (1929–2003) began her formal studies in ethnomusicology which later led her to research French traditional dance forms and eventually Renaissance and Baroque dances. In 1980, at the invitation of the French Minister of Culture, she founded the baroque dance company "Ris et Danceries". Her work in choreographing the landmark 1986 production of [[Jean-Baptiste Lully|Lully]]'s 1676 tragedie-lyrique ''[[Atys (Lully)|Atys]]'' was part of the national celebration of the 300th anniversary of Lully's death.  This production propelled the career of [[William Christie (musician)|William Christie]] and his ensemble [[Les Arts Florissants (ensemble)|Les Arts Florissants]]. Since the Ris et Danseries company was disbanded circa 1993, choreographers from the company have continued with their own work. [[Béatrice Massin]] with her "Compagnie Fetes Galantes", along with Marie Genevieve Massé and her company "L'Eventail" are among the most prominent. In 1995 Francine Lancelot's [[catalogue raisonné]] of baroque dance, entitled ''La Belle Dance'', was published.

The '''Biological Diversity Act, 2002''' is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of India]] for preservation of [[biological diversity]] in India, and provides mechanism for equitable sharing of benefits arising out of the use of traditional biological resources and [[Traditional knowledge|knowledge]]. The Act was enacted to meet the obligations under [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] (CBD), to which India is a party.

==History==
The Act was enacted to meet the obligations under [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] (CBD), to which India is a party.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Environmental legislation |url=http://www.thestatesman.com/features/environmental-legislation-1484784315.html |work=[[The Statesman (India)|The Statesman]] |date=19 January 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=min&gt;{{citation |title=Biological Diversity Act 2002 and establishment of National Biodiversity Authority, Chennai |url=http://www.moef.nic.in/divisions/csurv/nba_act.htm |work=[[Ministry of Environment and Forests]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biodiversity and biological resource==
Biodiversity has been defined under Section 2(b) of the Act as "the variability among living organisms from all sources and the [[habitat|ecological complexes]] of which they are part, and includes diversity within species or between species and of [[eco-system]]s". The Act also defines, Biological resources as "plants, animals and [[micro-organism]]s or parts thereof, their [[genetic material]] and by-products (excluding value added products) with actual or potential use or value, but does not include human genetic material."&lt;ref&gt;Section 2(c) of Biological Diversity Act, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

==National Biodiversity Authority and State Biodiversity Boards==
{{Main|National Biodiversity Authority}}

The National Biodiversity Authority (NBA)is a statutory autonomous body, headquartered in [[Chennai]], under the [[Ministry of Environment and Forests (India)|Ministry of Environment and Forests]], [[Government of India]] established in 2003 to implement the provisions under the Act. State Biodiversity Boards (SBB) has been created in 29 States along with  31,574 Biological management committees (for each local body) across India.

===Functions===
* Regulation of acts prohibited under the Act
* Advise the Government on conservation of biodiversity
* Advise the Government on selection of biological heritage sites
* Take appropriate steps to oppose grant of intellectual property rights in foreign countries, arising from the use of biological resources or associated traditional knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Section 18 of Biological Diversity Act, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulations==
A foreigner, non-resident Indian as defined in clause (30) of section 2 of [[The Income-tax Act, 1961]] or a foreign company or [[body corporate]] need to take permission from the NBA before obtaining any biological resources or associated knowledge from India for research, survey, commercial utilisation.&lt;ref&gt;Section 3 of Biological Diversity Act, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Indian citizens or body corporates need to take permission from the concerned State Biodiversity Board.&lt;ref&gt;Section 7 of Biological Diversity Act, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

Result of research using biological resources from India cannot be transferred to a non-citizen or a foreign company without the permission of NBA.

[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1260074 JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; English [[Christmas carol]] that describes the ancient tradition of [[sacrifice|sacrificing]] a [[boar]] and presenting its head at a [[Yule]]tide feast. Of the several extant versions of the carol, the one most usually performed today is based on a version published in 1521 in [[Wynkyn de Worde]]'s ''Christmasse Carolles''.&lt;ref name = "Husk"/&gt;

==History and origins==
{{main article|Christmas ham}}
According to folklorists, the boar's head tradition was:

{{quote|initiated in all probability on the Isle of Britain by the [[Anglo-Saxons]], although our knowledge of it comes substantially from [[medieval]] times. ... [In ancient [[Norse paganism|Norse]] tradition] sacrifice carried the intent of imploring [[Freyr]] to show favor to the new year. The boar's head with apple in mouth was carried into the banquet hall on a gold or silver dish to the sounds of trumpets and the songs of minstrels.&lt;ref name ="folklore" /&gt;}}

In [[Scandinavia]] and [[England]], [[Saint Stephen]] may have inherited some of Freyr's legacy. [[St. Stephen's Day|St. Stephen's feast day]] is 26 December, and thus he came to play a part in the Yuletide celebrations which were previously associated with Freyr (or ''Ingwi'' to the Anglo-Saxons). In old Swedish art, Stephen is shown as tending to horses and bringing a boar's head to a Yuletide banquet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Berger, Pamela |date=1985|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6kAj30ftRaAC&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=Goddess+Obscured:+Transformation+of+the+Grain+Protectress#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false |title=The Goddess Obscured: Transformation of the Grain Protectress from Goddess to Saint|location= Boston|publisher= Beacon Press|isbn= 0-8070-6723-7|pages= 105–112}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both elements are extra-canonical and may be pagan survivals. [[Christmas ham]] is an old tradition in Sweden and may have originated as a winter solstice boar sacrifice to Freyr.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

==Lyrics==
{{Listen|filename=A Carol Brynging in the Bore's Heed.ogg|title=Boar's Head Carol|description=The tune for ''A Carol Brynging in the Bore's Heed''}}
{{Listen|filename=The Boar's Head Carol.ogg|title=The Boar's Head Carol|description=A multitrack recording of The Boar's Head Carol}}
&lt;poem&gt;The boar's head in hand bring I, (Or:  The boar's head in hand bear I,)
Bedeck'd with bays and rosemary.
And I pray you, my masters, be merry (Or: And I pray you, my masters, merry be)
''Quot estis in convivio'' (Translation: As many as are in the feast)

'''CHORUS'''
''Caput apri defero'' (Translation: The boar's head I bear)
''Reddens laudes Domino''  (Translation: Giving praises to the Lord)

The boar's head, as I understand,
Is the rarest dish in all this land,
Which thus bedeck'd with a gay garland
Let us ''servire cantico''. (Translation: Let us serve with a song)

'''CHORUS'''

Our steward hath provided this
In honour of the King of Bliss;
Which on this day to be servèd is
''In Reginensi atrio''.  (Translation: In the hall of Queen’s [College, Oxford])

'''CHORUS'''&lt;/poem&gt;

There is also an alternative version of the same song with lyrics modified to fit poultry being served, replacing "The boar's head in hand bring I" with "The fowl on the platter see", and "The boar's head, as I understand/Is the rarest dish in all this land" with "This large bird, as I understand/Is the finest dish in all this land".

==Modern processions==
As of 2008, the tradition of processing with the Boar's Head whilst singing the carol was believed still to be observed at the following locations:

===In Canada===
* [[Knox College, University of Toronto]], Canada.  The procession takes place in the dark and is the only occasion when candles are permitted to be lit in the historic building.  A bearer of the boar's head and the singers are selected by the music director of the Christmas formal dinner.
* Victoria University in the University of Toronto, Canada.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}
* Wilfrid Laurier University, Waterloo, Canada.  December 2008 was the 59th annual observance.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}
* Jane Ubertino's annual Wassail party in Toronto (the 26th one in 2016 was held at Regis College, the 27th one in 2017 in Corpus Christi parish hall)
* Bushwakker Brewpub, Regina, Saskatchewan. Annual Christmas presentation from the Regina Male Voice Choir in mid-December.

===In England===
* [[Hurstpierpoint College]], West Sussex, England.  Here, it has been observed annually almost since the College's foundation in 1849 and may have been imported by a Headmaster who was at Queen's College.  It now takes place on the first Wednesday in December after a short service in Chapel for all, and heralds the feast which is held to acknowledge the work done by the College's Sacristans and Choir.  The Boar's Head is carried on a platter carried by four Sacristans and preceded by the mustard pot carried by a fifth. The remainder of the Senior School lines the cloisters which form three sides of the Inner Quadrangle, the fourth being formed by the Chapel and Dining Hall.  The lights are extinguished and the procession, its members carrying candles, moves from the east of the college through the cloisters lined by unusually silent students and back through the Chapel to the vestry.
* [[Netherthorpe School]], Chesterfield, England.
*[[Notting Hill &amp; Ealing High School]], England. Here, the Boar's Head itself is actually a fake made from papier mache. The [[GDST|GPDST]] council of 1911 declared this inappropriate, however the tradition is still enforced.
*[[Orchard House]] Christmas Dinner at [[Millfield School]], Somerset, England.
* [[Stourbridge]] Old Edwardian Club, England. The Boar's Head supper was traditionally celebrated on Christmas Eve since 1911 but is now celebrated on 23 December. The decorated Boar's Head, carried on a platter by the Club's President, is ceremonially presented to the members. After the welcome and seasonal greetings, a supper is served, which includes [[brawn]]-filled bread rolls.
*[[The Queen's College, Oxford]], England. [[William Henry Husk]], Librarian to the Sacred Harmonic Society, wrote about the tradition in his ''Songs of the Nativity Being Christmas Carols, Ancient and Modern'' (1868): &lt;blockquote&gt;Where an amusing tradition formerly current in Oxford concerning the boar's head custom, which represented that usage as a commemoration of an act of valour performed by a student of the college, who, while walking in the neighbouring forest of [[Shotover]] and reading [[Aristotle]], was suddenly attacked by a wild boar. The furious beast came open-mouthed upon the youth, who, however, very courageously, and with a happy presence of mind, thrust the volume he was reading down the boar's throat, crying, "Græcum est,"&lt;ref name = "note"&gt;"With compliments of the Greeks."&lt;/ref&gt; and fairly choked the savage with the sage.&lt;ref name ="Husk" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Queen's College celebrates the tradition by three chefs' bringing a boar's head into hall, with a procession of a solo singer who sings the first verse, accompanied by torch bearers and followed by a choir. The procession stops during verses and walks during the chorus. The head is placed on the high table, and the Provost distributes the herbs to the choir and the orange from the Boar's mouth to the solo singer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christmas-carols.org.uk/christmas-carols/boars-head-carol|title= Boar's Head Carol|website= Christmas-Carols.org.uk|accessdate= December 8, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Worshipful Company of Cutlers]], London, England
*[https://www.achurchnearyou.com/church/5978 Church of St Leonard &amp; St James], [http://rousham.org Rousham], Oxfordshire, England where the choir processes behind a boar's head at the start of the annual service of Nine Lessons and Carols (the Sunday before Christmas).  Here, as at Queen's College in nearby Oxford, the procession stops during verses and walks during the chorus.  The head is placed in the pulpit for the duration of the service, and then taken to St James's church in [[Somerton, Oxfordshire|Somerton]], for similar use under the supervision of local MP [[Victoria Prentis]].

===In Ireland===
*[[Gonzaga College]] [[Dublin]], the senior choir has traditionally sung the Boar's Head Carol after the solemn [[Christmas Eve]] [[Midnight Mass]] held at the College Chapel. On Christmas Eve 2008, the [[Schola]] (inner choir) initiated an impromptu rendition on the steps of the College to maintain the tradition after the Carol had strangely been dropped from the service.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

===In South Africa===
* [[St. John's College, Johannesburg]], founded 1898. The tradition of the boar's head is observed during the annual old boys dinner.

===In the United States===
In the United States, the "Boar's Head Carol" and procession are often a part of [[madrigal dinner]] performances, even though the main dish is usually chicken.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

'''Brunei English''' is a regional [[dialect]] of [[English language|English]] that is widely spoken in [[Brunei|Brunei Darussalam]], even though the national language is [[Malay language|Malay]]. Although the lingua franca in the country is generally the local dialect of Malay,&lt;ref&gt;Clynes, A. (2014). Brunei Malay: An overview. In P. Sercombe, M. Boutin &amp; A. Clynes (Eds.), ''Advances in research on linguistic and cultural practices in Borneo'' (pp. 153-200). Phillips, ME: Borneo Research Council.&lt;/ref&gt; all educated people are proficient in English, as it has been the medium of instruction from the fourth year of primary school since 1985.&lt;ref&gt;McLellan, J., Noor Azam Haji-Othman, &amp; Deterding, D. (2016). The Language Situation in Brunei Darussalam. In Noor Azam Haji-Othman., J. McLellan &amp; D. Deterding (Eds.), ''The use and status of language in Brunei Darussalam: A kingdom of unexpected linguistic diversity'' (pp. 9–16). Singapore: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are various features that make Brunei English distinct: for pronunciation, the sound at the start of a word such as ''three'' is often [t] rather than [θ], and there is usually a full vowel rather than [ə] in function words such as ''as'', ''than'', and ''of''; for grammar, ''furnitures'' and ''jewelleries'' are treated as plural nouns, and there is variable use of the third-person &amp;minus;s suffix on present tense verbs; and for lexis, many words are borrowed from Malay to reflect local customs, including ''titah'' (a speech by the Sultan) and ''tudung'' (a head scarf). Some of these features are shared with other varieties of [[Southeast Asian English]]; but others make Brunei English a distinct variety.

== History and Education ==
Brunei was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Protectorate]] from 1888 until 1984.&lt;ref&gt;Saunders, G. (1994). ''A History of Brunei.'' Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hussainmiya, B. A. (1995). ''Sultan Omar Ali Saifuddin III: The Making of Brunei Darusslam''. Kuala Lumpur: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Not surprisingly, English became widely used, even though Brunei Malay (a dialect of Malay that is substantially different from Standard Malay&lt;ref&gt;Clynes, A., &amp; Deterding, D. (2011). Standard Malay (Brunei). ''Journal of the International Phonetic Association'', ''41'', 259–268. [http://www.ubd.edu.bn/academic/faculty/FASS/research/malay/index.html On-line Version] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151015203321/http://www.ubd.edu.bn/academic/faculty/FASS/research/malay/index.html |date=2015-10-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) continues to be the main language that is spoken.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, P. W., &amp; Poedjoesoedarmo, G. (1996). An overview of the language situation in Brunei Darussalam. In P. W. Martin, A. C. K. Ozog &amp; G. Poedjoesoedarmo (eds.), ''Language Use and Language Change in Brunei Darussalam'' (pp. 1–23). Athens, OH: Ohio University Center for International Studies.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, the Bilingual Education Policy was implemented, with Malay as the medium of instruction for the first three years of [[primary school]], and then English becoming the medium of instruction for most subjects from the fourth year of primary school on.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, G. (1996). The Brunei education policy in Brunei Darussalam. In P. W. Martin, A. C. K. Ozog &amp; G. Poedjoesoedarmo (eds.), ''Language Use and Language Change in Brunei Darussalam'' (pp. 123–132). Athens, OH: Ohio University Center for International Studies.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, history switched from being English medium to being Malay medium.&lt;ref&gt;Gunn, G. C. (1997). ''Language, Power, &amp; Ideology in Brunei Darussalam''. Athens, OH: Ohio University Center for International Studies. page 155.&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2009, a new education policy was implemented. It is termed SPN21 (''Sistem Pendidikan Negara&amp;nbsp;– Abad 21'', 'National Education System for the 21st Century'). In this new system, Mathematics and Science are taught in English from the start of primary school.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, G. M. (2012). Language planning in its historical context in Brunei Darussalam. In E. L. Low &amp; Azirah Hashim (Eds.), ''English in Southeast Asia: Features, Policy and Language in Use'' (pp. 175–187). Amseterdam/Philadelphia: John Benjamins.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jones, G. M. (2016). Changing patterns of education in Brunei: How past plans have shaped future trends. In Noor Azam Haji-Othman., J. McLellan &amp; D. Deterding (Eds.), ''The use and status of language in Brunei Darussalam: A kingdom of unexpected linguistic diversity'' (pp. 267–278). Singapore: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; Only time will tell what effect this new SPN21 education policy will have on the status of English in Brunei.&lt;ref&gt;Deterding, D., &amp; Salbrina S. (2013). ''Brunei English: A New Variety in a Multilingual Society''. Dordrecht: Springer. p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Clearly, English is well established in Brunei, though it does not seem to be challenging the position of Malay. Rather more threatened are the minority languages such as [[Dusun language|Dusun]], [[Tutong language|Tutong]] and Murut ([[Lun Bawang language|Lun Bawang]]), which seem to be getting squeezed out by the two dominant languages,&lt;ref&gt;Noor Azam (2012). It's not always English: "Duelling Aunties" in Brunei Darussalam. In V. Rapatahana &amp; P. Bunce (eds.), ''English Language as Hydra''. Bristol: Multilingual Matters.&lt;/ref&gt; though recent research in [[Temburong District]] suggests that Murut is surviving better than the other two.&lt;ref&gt;Coluzzi, P. (2010). Endangered languages in Borneo: a survey among the Iban and Murut (Lun Bawang) in Temburong, Brunei. ''Oceanic Linguistics, 49''(1), 119–143.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Variation ==
There is, of course, substantial variation in the English spoken in Brunei. Two sources of variation are mentioned here: education and ethnicity.

There is rather a wide educational divide. Those who attend private schools and the best government schools usually achieve an excellent standard in English; but those who go to less fashionable schools often end up with only rudimentary skills in English.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, A., Henry, A., Malai Ayla Hj Abd., &amp; Clynes, A. (2011). English in Brunei: “She speaks excellent English” – “No he doesn’t”. In  L. J. Zhang, R. Rubdy &amp; L. Alsagoff (Eds.), ''Asian Englishes: Changing Perspectives in a Globalized World'' (pp. 52–66). Singapore: Pearson.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also some variation in Brunei English arising from the ethnicity of speakers. Recent research has shown that undergraduates at the University of Brunei Darussalam (UBD) can identify whether a fellow undergraduate is Malay or Chinese on the basis of 10 seconds of spoken English  with an accuracy of about 74%, which suggests that the English pronunciation of the two ethnic groups differs to some extent.&lt;ref&gt;Ishamina Athirah (2011). Identification of Bruneian ethnic groups from their English pronunciation. ''Southeast Asia: A Multidisciplinary Journal, 11'', 37–45. [http://www.ubd.edu.bn/academic/faculty/FASS/SEA/vol11/SEA-v11-ishamina.pdf On-line Version] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304043247/http://www.ubd.edu.bn/academic/faculty/FASS/SEA/vol11/SEA-v11-ishamina.pdf |date=2016-03-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Pronunciation ==
Some of the salient features of the pronunciation of English in Brunei are:
* The consonant at the start of words like ''thin'' and ''thank'' tends to be pronounced as [t] rather than [θ].&lt;ref&gt;Mossop, J. (1996). Some phonological features of Brunei English. In P. W. Martin, A. C. K. Ozog &amp; G. Poedjoesoedarmo (eds.), ''Language Use and Language Change in Brunei Darussalam'' (pp. 189–208). Athens, OH: Ohio University Center for International Studies.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The vowel in function words such as ''of'' and ''that'' tends to be a full vowel rather than [ə].&lt;ref&gt;Deterding, D., &amp; Salbrina S. (2013). ''Brunei English: A New Variety in a Multilingual Society''. Dordrecht: Springer. p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Pairs of long and short vowels are merged by some speakers,&lt;ref&gt;Salbrina, S. (2006). The vowels of Brunei English: An acoustic investigation. ''English World-Wide'', ''27'', 247–264.&lt;/ref&gt; with the result that ''beat'' and ''bit'' may be homophones, and similarly ''fool'' and ''full'' often sound the same. In an investigation of the speech of 53 undergraduates, 14 were found to have the same vowel quality in ''feast'' and ''fist'',&lt;ref&gt;Deterding, D., &amp; Salbrina S. (2013). ''Brunei English: A New Variety in a Multilingual Society''. Dordrecht: Springer. p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; but the proportion of speakers who merge these two vowels is almost certainly higher for less well-educated speakers.
* Spelling pronunciation affects some words, so ''salmon'' tends to have an [l] in it, and the first syllable of ''company'' has [ɒ] rather than [ʌ] for about half of undergraduates at the [[University of Brunei Darussalam]].&lt;ref&gt;Deterding, D., &amp; Salbrina S. (2013). ''Brunei English: A New Variety in a Multilingual Society''. Dordrecht: Springer. p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

One current change that seems to be taking place is that Brunei English is becoming rhotic, partly influenced by American English and also by the rhoticity of the Malay spoken in Brunei,&lt;ref&gt;Salbrina, S., &amp; Deterding, D. (2010). Rhoticity in Brunei English. ''English World-Wide'', ''31'', 121–137.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nur Raihan Mohamad (2017). Rhoticity in Brunei English : A diachronic approach. [http://fass.ubd.edu.bn/SEA/volume17.html ''Southeast Asia: A Multidisciplinary Journal''], 17, 1-7. [http://fass.ubd.edu.bn/SEA/vol17/SEA-v17-raihan.pdf PDF Version]&lt;/ref&gt; although English in neighboring Malaysia and Singapore remains mostly non-rhotic.

== Grammar ==
A few of the salient features of Brunei English grammar are:
* Logically plural nouns are found with an &amp;minus;s suffix, even if they are uncount nouns in other varieties of English. So one finds ''equipments'', ''infrastructures'' and ''jewelleries''.&lt;ref&gt;Deterding, D., &amp; Salbrina S. (2013). ''Brunei English: A New Variety in a Multilingual Society''. Dordrecht: Springer. p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; This is, of course, also found in a wide range of other New Varieties of English around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Mesthrie, R., &amp; Bhatt, R. M. (2008). ''World Englishes: The Study of Linguistic varieties'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''one of'' is often followed by a singular noun, so one finds utterances like 'one of the queen were beheaded' and 'he is one of the main character'.&lt;ref&gt;Deterding, D., &amp; Salbrina S. (2013). ''Brunei English: A New Variety in a Multilingual Society''. Dordrecht: Springer. p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Use of the &amp;minus;s suffix on verbs to indicate a 3rd person singular subject is variable.&lt;ref&gt;Deterding, D., &amp; Salbrina S. (2013). ''Brunei English: A New Variety in a Multilingual Society''. Dordrecht: Springer. p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''would'' is often used to indicate something tentative.&lt;ref&gt;Ho, D. G. E. (2009). Exponents of politeness in Brunei English. ''World Englishes'', ''28'', 35–51.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Lexis ==
There is widespread borrowing of words from Malay into Brunei English. These include ''titah'' (a speech by the Sultan), ''sabda'' (a speech by another member of the Royal Family), ''tudung'' (a head-dress worn by women) and ''puasa'' ('fasting').&lt;ref&gt;Deterding, D., &amp; Salbrina S. (2013). ''Brunei English: A New Variety in a Multilingual Society''. Dordrecht: Springer. p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; Words for local food are often borrowed from Malay, such as ''kuih'' ('a local cake'), as in 'A variety of Malay kuih and sliced fruits will also be served'.&lt;ref&gt;McLellan, J., &amp; Noor Azam H-J. (2012). Brunei English. In E. L. Low &amp; Azirah Hashim (Eds.), ''English in Southeast Asia: Features, Policy and Language Use'' (pp. 75-90). Amsterdam: John Benjamins. p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt;

Use of Malay terms in the English spoken in Brunei can sometimes lead to loss of intelligibility, such as ''Ugama Schools'' ('religious schools') being misunderstood as 'government schools' by someone from the Maldives.&lt;ref&gt;Ishamina Athirah, &amp; Deterding, D. (2017). English medium education in a university in Brunei Darussalam: Code-switching and intelligibility. In I. Walkinshaw, B. Fenton-Smith &amp; P. Humphreys (Eds.), ''English medium instruction in higher education in Asia-Pacific'' (pp. 281–297). Singapore: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many initialisms are found, including:&lt;ref&gt;Deterding, D., &amp; Salbrina S. (2013). ''Brunei English: A New Variety in a Multilingual Society''. Dordrecht: Springer. p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt;
* UBD : Universiti Brunei Darusslam
* BSB : Bandar Seri Begawan (the capital of Brunei)
* PTE : Pusat Tingkatan Enam ('Sixth Form Centre')
* OGDC : [[Oil and Gas Discovery Centre]]
* GOFR : General Order Financial Regulations

Acronyms (where the letters create a word) are not so common, but we find:&lt;ref&gt;Deterding, D., &amp; Salbrina S. (2013). ''Brunei English: A New Variety in a Multilingual Society''. Dordrecht: Springer. p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt;
* RIPAS [ripas] : Raja Isteri Pengiran Anak Saleha (the Hospital in BSB, named after the Queen)
* MOFAT [mɒfæt] : Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade
* SHBIE [ʃɪbɪ] : Sultan Hassanal Bolkiah Institute of Education

There are some idiosyncratic expressions in Brunei English, such as ''dry season'' to refer to the period just before payday when people are short of money, as in 'I cannot pay now: dry season bah!'&lt;ref&gt;McLellan, J., &amp; Noor Azam H-J. (2012). Brunei English. In E. L. Low &amp; Azirah Hashim (Eds.), ''English in Southeast Asia: Features, Policy and Language Use'' (pp. 75-90). Amsterdam: John Benjamins. p. 83&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mixing ==
Mixing of English and Malay is extremely widespread in informal discourse in Brunei. In fact, an investigation of the language used in an English-medium discussion forum showed that nearly half of all postings were partly or completely in Malay.&lt;ref&gt;McLellan, J. (2010). Mixed codes or varieties of English. In A. Kirkpatrick (ed.), ''The Routledge Handbook of World Englishes'' (pp. 425–441). London/New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; In data involving a map task, where one participant has to guide a second participant along a route, a speaker said:&lt;ref&gt;Faahirah, R. (2016). Code-switching in Brunei: Evidence from the map task. ''South East Asia: A Multidisciplinary Journal'', 16, pp. 65–81. [http://fass.ubd.edu.bn/SEA/vol16/SEA-v16-faahirah.pdf On-line Version] &lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;uh so ''jalan saja'' uh continue ''macam ada'' a bit cornering&lt;/blockquote&gt;

with four words of Malay in the English utterance: ''jalan'' (walk), ''saja'' (just), ''macam'' (like) and ''ada'' (there is). So this utterance means: 'just go and continue, like there's a bit of cornering'.

== Conclusion ==
It is hard to know whether English in Brunei is following an established pattern and emerging as a distinct variety of English or not.&lt;ref&gt;Schnieder, E. W. (2007). ''Postcolonial English: Varieties around the World''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the trends found, including the use of plural nouns such as ''equipments'' and the variable use of the 3rd person singular &amp;minus;s suffix on verbs, seem to be similar to the ways English is used as a lingua franca around the world.&lt;ref&gt;Seidlhofer, B. (2011). ''Understanding English as a Lingua Franca''. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the avoidance of vowel reduction in unstressed syllables is consistent with the way English is spoken elsewhere in South-East Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Deterding, D. (2010). Norms for pronunciation in Southeast Asia. ''World Englishes'', ''29''(3), 364–367.&lt;/ref&gt; So Brunei English may be contributing to the ways that English is evolving around the world today.&lt;ref&gt;Deterding, D. (2014). The evolution of Brunei English: How it is contributing to the development of English in the world. In S. Buschfeld, T. Hoffmann, M. Huber, &amp; A. Kautzsch (Eds.), ''The Evolution of Englishes. The Dynamic Model and Beyond'' (pp. 420–433). Amsterdam: John Benjamins.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1332">'''Classical Chinese writers''' were trained as compilers rather than as originators composing information. These writers in [[Classical Chinese]] were trained by memorizing extensive tracts in the classics and histories. Their method of constructing their own work was to extensively cut and paste passages and fragments from these sources. Today this would be called [[plagiarism]]. However, these early Chinese writers considered themselves not as creators, but as preservers of the record. The continuing controversy over the meaning of Chinese text is best understood by examining the classical scholar's way of writing. [[Zhu Xi]] was a great editor and commentator but his prime aim was moral learning, considered far more important than art or literature. Zhu Xi cemented [[Confucian]] moral righteousness into the Chinese methods of evaluation. [[Joseph Needham]] has said, Chinese writers made careful note of observable concrete phenomena but they made little use of categorical analysis or the building of [[logical system]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The '''Columbia Water Center''' ('''CWC''') was established in January 2008 as a branch of the [[Earth Institute]] at [[Columbia University]]. The center focuses on researching and addressing global water-related challenges, including [[water scarcity]], access, quality and climate risks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.earthinstitute.columbia.edu/articles/view/2125 |title=The Earth Institute Water |publisher=[[Earth Institute]] |author= |date= |accessdate=2009-09-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Center's stated mission is to "creatively tackle water challenges of a rapidly changing world where water and climate interact with food, energy, ecosystems and urbanization," by combining "the rigor of scientific research with the impact of effective policy."  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://water.columbia.edu/about-us/|title=Columbia Water Center: About Us |publisher=Columbia Water Center |author= |date= |accessdate=2015-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Columbia Water Center takes a multidisciplinary approach to water challenges, employing [[hydrologists]], [[climatologists]], [[environmental engineer]]s, and [[water policy]] analysts. The Director of the center is Upmanu Lall, the Carol Silberstein Professor of Earth and Environmental Engineering and Civil Engineering and Engineering Mechanics at Columbia University.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://earth.columbia.edu/articles/view/2757  |title=The Earth Institute Profiles: Upmanu Lall |publisher=[[Earth Institute]] |author= |date= |accessdate=2015-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pierre Gentine, an Assistant Professor in the Department of Earth and Environmental Engineering, also takes a leading role in the center, with his own PhD and Post-doctoral team focusing on the interactions between soil and atmospheric moisture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/~pg2328/Website/Pierre_Gentines_Homepage/Lab.html|title=Gentine Lab website|accessdate=5 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="earth water and sky"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/2011/05/11/earth-water-and-sky-a-conversation-with-pierre-gentine-a-new-columbia-water-center-scientist/|title=Earth, Water and Sky –A Conversation with Pierre Gentine, a new Columbia Water Center Scientist|date=11 May 2011|last=Polycarpou|first=Lakis|publisher=State of the planet|accessdate=5 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The center currently divides its projects into five themes, America's Water, The Global Floods Initiative, Data Analytics and Multi-Scale Predictions, Risk and Financial Instruments and the Water, Food, Energy Nexus.&lt;ref name="research themes"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://water.columbia.edu/research-themes/  |title=The Columbia Water Center: Research Themes |publisher=Columbia Water Center |author= |date= |accessdate=2015-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The Earth Institute, under the leadership of [[Jeff Sachs]], is a research institution that supports sustainable development from various angles.&lt;ref name="Earth Institute"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.earth.columbia.edu/articles/view/2021|title=PepsiCo Foundation announces major new grant to the Earth Institute at Columbia University to promote global water sustainability |publisher=[[Earth Institute]]|date=22 January 2008|accessdate=5 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the [[PepsiCo]] Foundation awarded the [[Earth Institute]] $6 million to address these water-related issues. The PepsiCo grant led to the establishment of the Columbia Water Center under the leadership of Columbia University engineering professor Upmanu Lall.  This three-year grant made possible projects in four countries: India, China, Mali, and Brazil.&lt;ref name="Earth Institute"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pepsico.com/Purpose/Environmental-Sustainability/Water|title=Our planet sustainability efforts and goals|publisher=PepsiCo|accessdate=5 April 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161001095523/http://www.pepsico.com/Purpose/Environmental-Sustainability/Water|archivedate=1 October 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Brazil, CWC has partnered with the [[Federal University of Ceará]] in the northeast to focus on sophisticated climate-based forecasting systems used for water allocation decisions across diverse use sectors.  In addition, the CWC team recently completed a municipal water plan (PAM) for Milhã, a rural area in central Ceará. The project outlines a plan for the municipality to deliver water to all of its 14,000 residents.

As part of the project, the CWC designed and built water infrastructure demonstration projects for Ingá and Pedra Fina, two communities in Milhã. The project provides water to 500 people in the area.&lt;ref name="CWC Article"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.america.gov/st/energy-english/2010/June/20100528161751kjleinad0.6077082.html |title=Columbia Water Center at Work Across Globe |publisher=America.gov |author=Carrie Loewenthal Massey |date=2010-06-01 |accessdate=2010-06-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In India, the project focuses on reducing water consumption in the agricultural sector by encouraging sustainable crop choice patterns, as well as working with corporations to deploy better [[irrigation]] technologies (and increase reliability) throughout their supply chains.  A key objective is to reduce the [[overdrafting|groundwater stress]] in the region. Primary project locations are in the states of [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] and [[Gujarat]].&lt;ref name="Circleofblue"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.circleofblue.org/waternews/2010/world/qa-upmanu-lall-gives-insight-to-indias-nexus-of-energy-food-and-water?CP.rss=true |title=U.S., India Working Together to Address India’s Water Needs |publisher=Circle of Blue Water News|author=J. Carl Ganter |date=2010-06-04 |accessdate=2011-01-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Punjab, the CWC has partnered with [[Punjab Agricultural University]] to come up with innovative solutions to reduce farmer irrigation. Some of the methods developed (including the use of inexpensive [[Tensiometer (soil science)|tensiometers]] to measure soil moisture and direct seeding of rice) were field tested in the 2010 planting season with over 500 farmers participating.&lt;ref name="India"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.america.gov/st/energy-english/2010/May/20100528153333kjleinad0.4795191.html?CP.rss=true |title=U.S., India Working Together to Address India’s Water Needs |publisher=America.gov |author=Carrie Loewenthal Massey |date=2010-05-28 |accessdate=2010-06-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Punjab Agricultural University team reports that participating farmers saved 25 to 30 percent of their normal water use by implementing the new approaches. The CWC/PAU team plans to scale up the pilot project in 2011 by recruiting 5,000 rice farmers to use tensiometers.&lt;ref name="tensiometer"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/2010/11/17/%E2%80%9Csmall-is-also-beautiful%E2%80%9D-%E2%80%93-appropriate-technology-cuts-rice-famers%E2%80%99-water-use-by-30-percent-in-punjab-india/?CP.rss=true |title=‘Small is Also Beautiful’ – Appropriate Technology Cuts Rice Famers’ Water Use by 30 Percent in Punjab, India |publisher=blogs.ei.columbia.edu |author=Lakis Polycarpou |date=2010-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Gujarat, the Columbia Water Center is working with the state government to reform [[subsidies in India|electricity subsidies]] to provide a greater incentive for farmers to conserve water. In conjunction with subsidy reform, the CWC is also piloting water saving technologies among farmers.&lt;ref name="WaterWideWeb"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.waterwideweb.org/incentives-for-water-conservation-in-guajarat.html#comments |title=Incentives for Water Conservation in Gujarat |publisher=WaterWideWeb.org |author=Eryn-Ashlei Bailey |date=2010-12-03 |accessdate=2011-01-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110502164844/http://www.waterwideweb.org/incentives-for-water-conservation-in-guajarat.html#comments |archivedate=2011-05-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work in Mali coincides with the [[Millennium Villages Project]]. CWC is focusing on designing irrigation and cropping systems that can be operated and maintained locally in order to provide farmers with higher-value cash crops. The center has installed large pumps that improved the amount of water available.  Projects emphasize bringing together local partners, [[market forces]] and [[public-private partnership]]s.

==Current Research ==

In recent years, the Columbia Water Center has expanded the scope of its initiatives to encompass five broad research themes.&lt;ref name="research themes" /&gt;

===[http://water.columbia.edu/research-themes/americas-water/ America's Water]===

The America’s Water Initiative is aims to build a network of academic institutions, government agencies, and private industry to inform water infrastructure improvements in the United States and address other water challenges. The initiative focuses on all aspects of water, from policy to drought and flood forecasting and the potential for disruptive water technology to provide distributed water infrastructure that is less expensive than replacing legacy systems.&lt;ref name="America's Water"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://water.columbia.edu/research-themes/americas-water/ |title=Columbia Water Center: Research Themes |location=America's water |publisher=The Columbia Water Center |accessdate=2015-04-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 12, 2015, the initiative held its first annual symposium, which brought together water experts from various groups, representing the industry, utilities, policy and non-profit sectors among others. The meeting was intended to be a first step toward a broader working relationship that can help set a water research agenda and develop solutions for national water challenges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://piscesfoundation.org/partnering-with-academia-to-address-u-s-water-challenges/|title=Partnering with Academia to Address U.S. Water Challenges|date=13 March 2013|accessdate=5 April 2017|last=Stoner|first=Nancy|publisher=Pisces Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.ei.columbia.edu/2015/03/19/waking-up-to-americas-water-challenges/|title=Waking up to America’s Water Challenges|date=19 March 2015|publisher=State of the Planet|last=Polycarpou|first=Lakis|accessdate=5 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===[http://water.columbia.edu/research-themes/global-floods-initiative/ The Global Floods Initiative]===

The Global Floods Initiative aims to apply cutting-edge and continually evolving  climate forecasting techniques to help helping policymakers, disaster relief agencies, infrastructure designers, financial institutions and others better prepare for, manage and respond to extreme floods.&lt;ref name="Global Floods Initiative 2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://water.columbia.edu/research-themes/global-floods-initiative/ |title=Columbia Water Center: Research Themes |location=Global floods initiative |publisher=The Columbia Water Center |accessdate=2015-04-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="earth water and sky" /&gt;

The initiative builds on almost two decades of research on how the quasi-periodic climate cycles (such as El-Nino/La-Nina and the Pacific Decadal Oscillation) interact to increase the risk of flooding in particular locations. More recent research into hydrometerology, which looks at the interaction of land, water and atmosphere at a more local scale, adds additional layers to the potential for flood prediction.&lt;ref name="research themes" /&gt;

===[http://water.columbia.edu/research-themes/data-analytics-and-multi-scale-predictions/ Data Analytics and Multi-Scale Predictions]===

The Columbia Water Center is a leader in predicting seasonal hydroclimate forecasts and associated risk analyses. These forecasts are used for a variety of applications, including integrating climate forecasts into water allocation procedures for urban, industrial and agricultural consumers.&lt;ref name="Data Analytics"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://water.columbia.edu/research-themes/data-analytics-and-multi-scale-predictions/ |title=Columbia Water Center: Research Themes |location=Data analytics and multi-scale predictions |publisher=The Columbia Water Center |accessdate=2015-04-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

New ways of representing convection and vegetation response to water stress are also major areas of research, the results of which could offer new understandings of the carbon and hydrological cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://water.columbia.edu/research-themes/data-analytics-and-multi-scale-predictions/5115-2/|title=Predictions, Surface Energy, Plants: Understanding the Hydrologic Cycle|publisher=Columbia Water Center|accessdate=5 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===[http://water.columbia.edu/research-themes/risk-and-financial-instruments/ Risk and Financial Instruments]===

Climate forecasting can also be used to develop flood and drought risk metrics for companies with global supply chains. These metrics can help companies address challenges through new sourcing strategies, novel regional financial risk management products (e.g., cat bonds, index insurance), pre-emptive maintenance and mitigation, reservoir reallocation agreements and other tools.&lt;ref name="Risk and Financial Instruments"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://water.columbia.edu/research-themes/risk-and-financial-instruments/ |title=Columbia Water Center: Research Themes |location=Risk and finantial instruments |publisher=The Columbia Water Center |accessdate=2015-04-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===[http://water.columbia.edu/research-themes/water-food-energy-nexus/ Water, Food, Energy Nexus]===

The Columbia Water Center  studies how the water, food, and energy sectors are interrelated and how climate affects this relationship. Projects include policy research and recommendations to  promote water and energy savings in the agricultural sector in water-stressed farming regions, development of seasonal forecasts to guide decision-making in the water and energy sectors, and testing and implementation of low-cost soil moisture and nitrogen sensors to improve irrigation efficiency, reducing fertilizer use and [[groundwater pollution]] and saving energy from groundwater pumping.&lt;ref name="Water, Food, Energy Nexus"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://water.columbia.edu/research-themes/water-food-energy-nexus/ |title=Columbia Water Center: Research Themes |location=Water, food, energy nexus |publisher=The Columbia Water Center |accessdate=2015-04-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Circleofblue" /&gt;

In [[jazz education]], a '''contrafact''' is a [[musical composition]] consisting of a new [[melody]] overlaid on a familiar [[harmony|harmonic structure]].&lt;ref name = "GROVE"&gt;{{Citation

J. Peter Burkholder. Notes, Second Series, Vol. 50, No. 3 (Mar., 1994), pp. 851-870. Published by: Music Library Association.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a compositional device, it was of particular importance in the 1940s development of [[bebop|bop]], since it allowed [[jazz]] musicians to create new pieces for performance and recording on which they could immediately [[improvisation|improvise]], without having to seek permission or pay publisher fees for [[copyright]]ed materials (while melodies can be copyrighted, the underlying harmonic structure cannot be).

Contrafacts are not to be confused with [[musical quotation]]s, which comprise borrowing rhythms or melodic figures from an existing composition.

In classical music, contrafacts have been used as early as the [[parody mass]] and [[In Nomine]] of the 16th century. More recently, ''[[Cheap Imitation]]'' (1969) by [[John Cage]] was produced by systematically changing notes from the melody line of ''[[Socrate]]'' by [[Erik Satie]] using chance procedures.

In spite of its usefulness, the term "contrafact" has not won wide acceptance in Western classical theory.

== Examples ==
Well-known examples of contrafacts include the [[Charlie Parker]]/[[Miles Davis]] bop tune "[[Donna Lee]]," which uses the chord changes of the standard "[[Back Home Again in Indiana]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last  = Rosenthal| first  = David, H.| title  = Hard Bop:  Jazz and Black Music 1955-1965| publisher = Oxford University Press| location  = New York| isbn  = 0-19-505869-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Thelonious Monk]]'s [[jazz standard]]&lt;ref&gt;Yanow, Scott (2008). [{{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p106839/biography|pure_url=yes}} "Thelonious Monk" biography], ''AllMusic''.&lt;/ref&gt; "Evidence", which borrows the chord progression from Jesse Greer and Raymond Klages's song "[[Just You, Just Me]]" (1929).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Williams|first=Martin|title=What Kind of Composer Was Thelonious Monk?|journal=[[The Musical Quarterly]]|date=1 January 1992|volume=76|issue=3|pages=433–441|doi=10.1093/mq/76.3.433|url=http://mq.oxfordjournals.org/content/76/3/433.full.pdf+html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Gershwin tune "[[I Got Rhythm]]" has proved especially amenable to contrafactual recomposition: the popularity of its "[[rhythm changes]]" is second only to that of the [[12-bar blues]] as a basic harmonic structure used by jazz composers.

[[Image:Rashomon-sketch.jpg|thumb|alt=Photo of a drawing of a face and two hands|Page from a [[sketchbook]] using black Conté crayon.]]
'''Conté''', also known as '''Conté sticks''' or '''Conté crayons''', are a drawing medium composed of compressed powdered [[graphite]] or [[charcoal]] mixed with a [[wax]] or [[clay]] base, square in cross-section. They were invented in 1795 by [[Nicolas-Jacques Conté]], who created the combination of clay and graphite in response to the shortage of graphite caused by the [[Napoleonic Wars]] (the [[United Kingdom|British]] naval blockade of [[France]] prevented [[import]]). Conté crayons had the advantage of being [[cost-effective]] to produce, and easy to manufacture in controlled grades of [[hardness]].

They are now manufactured using natural [[pigment]]s ([[iron oxide]]s, [[carbon black]], [[titanium dioxide]]), [[clay]] ([[kaolin]]), and a [[binder (material)|binder]] ([[cellulose]] [[ether]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Conte à Paris |url=http://www.lefranc-bourgeois.com/catalogue_va/index.php?gam_cle=57&amp;s_gam_cle=105 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070809184709/http://www.lefranc-bourgeois.com/catalogue_va/index.php?gam_cle=57&amp;s_gam_cle=105 |archivedate = 2007-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conté crayons are most commonly found in black, white, and [[sanguine]] tones, as well as [[bistre]], shades of [[grey]], and other colors. Currently in the USA, sets of 12 assorted portrait and landscape colors are available as well as a sketching set, plus sets of 18, 24 or 48 colors. In Europe, 22 more colors are available and the colors other than sanguine, bistre, grey, black, and white are available open stock.

Colors sets are especially useful for field studies and color studies. Some artists create entire paintings with them, using them more like pastels than like a drawing medium. They are also used often to sketch under pastel paintings or lay down initial layers before using dry pastels. The colors sets lean toward very bright spectrum hues that mix well; even the 12 assorted color set can be layered to produce any hues or values desired. Color Conté mixes better on paper than many hard pastel products.

They are frequently used on rough paper that holds pigment grains well. They can also be used on prepared primed [[canvas]]es for [[underdrawing]] for a painting. The sticks' square profile make Conté crayons more suitable for detailed hatched work as opposed to the bolder [[painterly]] drawing style demanded by soft [[pastel]]s.

== Georges Seurat ==
In the 1880s, [[Georges Seurat]] used Conté crayons to produce many of his studies.

'''Cutting in''' is a process, in [[dancing]], by which a person interrupts two dance partners and claims the partner of one.&lt;ref&gt;WALES AT AMERICAN DANCE.; " Cut In " Like Other Officers -- Treated as Army Captain., The New York Times, January 14, 1919&lt;/ref&gt;  As traditionally portrayed in Hollywood films, men are more likely to cut in than women.

[[File:NewFakeMuseumsMascot.jpg|thumb|"The New Fake Museums" — 1889 cartoon suggesting that some "Dime museums" were little more than scams.]]
'''Dime museums''' were institutions that were popular at the end of the 19th century in the [[United States]]. Designed as centers for entertainment and moral education for the [[working class]] (''[[low culture|lowbrow]]''), the museums were distinctly different from [[upper middle class]]' cultural events (''[[highbrow]]''). In urban centers like [[New York City]], where many [[immigration to the United States|immigrants]] settled, dime museums were popular and cheap [[entertainment]]. The social trend reached its peak during the [[Progressive Era]] (c. 1890–1920). Although lowbrow entertainment, they were the starting places for the careers of many notable [[vaudeville]]-era entertainers including [[Harry Houdini]], [[Lew Fields]], [[Joe Weber (vaudevillian)|Joe Weber]], and [[Maggie Cline]].

==Baltimore==
In [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]], [[Peale Museum|Peale's Museum]] is credited as one of the first serious museums in the country. This type of attraction was re-created in the [[American Dime Museum]] in 1999, which operated for eight years before closing permanently and auctioning off its exhibits in late February 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sitebits.com/2007/american_dime_museum.html |title=American Dime Museum, reportage from the Baltimore museum on its last day of existence |work=SiteBits |year=2007 |accessdate=3 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Boston==
Kimball's Museum and Austin &amp; Stones Museum in Scollay Square were both well-known attractions, the former having a friendly connection to, and sometimes competition with, [[P. T. Barnum]].{{fact|date=January 2014}} Barnum and [[Moses Kimball]] even shared "Fee Gee Mermaids" on a regular basis.

==Cincinnati==
Both [[John James Audubon]] and sculptor [[Hiram Powers]] produced displays for the Western Museum, organized by Dr Daniel Drake in 1818 and continued by Joseph Dorfeuille.{{fact|date=January 2014}} "Satan and his Court" wax figures with moving parts and glowing eyes are typical of these displays.

==New Orleans==
[[File:RobinsonsMammothDimeMuseumAd.jpg|thumb|1885 advertisement for Robinson's Dime Museum and Theatre.]]
On [[Canal Street, New Orleans|Canal Street]], "Eugene Robinson's Museum and Theater" featured entertainments on the hour and also presented some of its attractions on a nearby riverboat.{{fact|date=January 2014}} The common promotion gimmick of a brass band at the front entrance of these Dime Museums featured some of the earliest documented traditional jazz; Robinson's riverboat museum also hired [[Papa Jack Laine]].

==New York City==
[[P.T. Barnum]] purchased Scudder's ''Dime Museum'' in 1841, and transformed it into one of the most popular single cultural sites that has ever existed, [[Barnum's American Museum]]. Together, P.T. Barnum and [[Moses Kimball]] introduced the so-called "[[Edutainment|Edutainement]]" which was a moralistic education realized through sensational [[freak show]]s, theater and circus performances, and many other means of entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/handle/2152/ETD-UT-2009-08-279 Lisa Rochelle Murray, MA Thesis: P.T. Barnum Presents: The Greatest Classroom on Earth!

It was relocated further up Broadway, but this venue too, fell victim to fire.

For many years in the basement of the [[Playland Arcade]] in [[Times Square]] in New York City, [[Hubert's Museum]] featured acts such as [[sword swallower]] Lady Estelene, Congo The Jungle Creep, a [[flea circus]], a half-man half-woman, and magicians such as [[Earl "Presto" Johnson]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}} This museum was documented in photography by [[Diane Arbus]]. Later, in Times Square, mouse pitchman [[Tommy Laird]] opened a dime museum that featured Tisha Booty - "the Human Pin Cushion" - and several magicians including [[Lou Lancaster]], [[Criss Capehart]], [[Dorothy Dietrich]], magician [[Dick Brooks (magician)|Dick Brooks]], and others.

'''''Dotter of Her Father's Eyes''''' is a 2012 graphic novel written by [[Mary M. Talbot]] with artwork by her husband, [[Bryan Talbot]]. It is part memoir, and part biography of [[Lucia Joyce]], daughter of modernist writer [[James Joyce]].

==Synopsis==
Mary Talbot recounts her childhood in [[Preston, Lancashire]], focussing upon her relationship with her father, Joycean scholar James S. Atherton.&lt;ref name="midweek"&gt;{{cite web |title=Midweek 22/02/2012  |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b01c7rgl |work=BBC |accessdate=13 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Talbot became a scholar herself, working in [[critical discourse analysis]] and publishing about [[language and gender]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Language and Gender |first=Mary M. |last=Talbot |edition=2 |year=2010 |publisher=Polity Press |isbn=0745646050}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book juxtaposes Talbot's childhood with [[Lucia Joyce]]'s -- the daughter of [[James Joyce]]. Inspired by Carol Shloss’s 2003 biography of Lucia, it covers her ambitions in dance and her deteriorating mental condition.

==Writing==
[[Bryan Talbot]] reflects on the differences in collaborating with his wife and his normal collaborations with writers. Explaining the process to the ''[[Sunderland Echo]]'', Talbot says, "[t]he usual state of affairs is you get a script through the post or by email and that is the end of the collaboration. You illustrate, you design the page and tell the story. But this time, Mary would come down to the studio to watch me work and suggest things. I would suggest changes to the script to make it clearer or to get a point across, then we would discuss it over dinner.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Book is a family affair  |url=http://www.sunderlandecho.com/news/book-is-a-family-affair-1-4382538 |newspaper=Sunderland Echo |date=24 March 2012|accessdate=13 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than have Bryan rework the art, Mary identified inaccuracies by inserting footnotes throughout the book.&lt;ref name="midweek"/&gt;

==Reception==
The book was received mainly positively by critics. Writing for ''[[The Observer]]'', [[Rachel Cooke]] wrote that "[b]oth narratives are elegantly done. Talbot has a keen eye for the revealing detail, an important skill if you are working in comics. She makes connections, but never labours them."&lt;!-- The Observer is the sister paper of The Guardian. --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Rachel |last=Cooke |title=Dotter of Her Father's Eyes by Mary M Talbot and Bryan Talbot – review |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/jan/27/dotter-fathers-eyes-talbot-james-joyce |work=The Observer |date=27 January 2012|accessdate=13 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Telegraph''{{'}}s review was similarly positive, labelling the book: "ambitious, entertaining and perceptive and blends a first-time script from Mary Talbot with stunning drawings and design from her husband, Bryan ([[Luther Arkwright]], ''[[Grandville (comics)|Grandville]]'', ''[[Alice in Sunderland]]'').

==Methodology and hypotheses==
===Issues with research===
Within the field of pornography research, there are many challenges that arise due to strong opinions and feelings on the topic. [[Confirmation bias]] is prevalent due to societal taboos surrounding pornography. While many studies hypothesize about and study negative effects of pornography, few researchers explore potential benefits or positive aspects of pornography. A large percentage of studies suffer from [[methodological]] issues. In one meta-study by researchers at Middlesex University in England, over 40,000 papers and articles were submitted to the team for review and 276 or 0.69% were suitable for consideration due to the low quality of research within the field.&lt;ref name="middlesexstudy"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-22987051|title=Do we know whether pornography harms people?|last=Fidgen|first=Jo|date=2013-06-25|newspaper=BBC News|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Zillmann's research===
[[File:Zillmann Fig 5.png|thumb|300px|Figure 5 in ''Effects of Prolonged Consumption of Pornography.''&lt;ref name="prolonged"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/NN/B/C/K/V/ |last=Zillmann |first=Dolf |title=Effects of Prolonged Consumption of Pornography |website=National Institutes of Health}}&lt;/ref&gt;]][[File:Zillmann Fig 10.png|thumb|300px|Figure 10 in ''Effects of Prolonged Consumption of Pornography.''&lt;ref name="prolonged"/&gt;]]

In ''Effects of Prolonged Consumption of Pornography'', a review of pornography research conducted for the [[Surgeon General of the United States]] in 1986, Zillmann noted that inconsistencies in the literature on pornography exist, but overall concluded that extensive viewing of pornographic material may produce some [[sociology|sociological]] effects he argued were negative, including a decreased respect for long-term, [[monogamy|monogamous]] relationships, and an attenuated desire for [[reproduction|procreation]].&lt;ref name="prolonged"/&gt; He describes the hypothetical basis for these conclusions stating:&lt;blockquote&gt;The values expressed in pornography clash so obviously with the family concept, and they potentially undermine the traditional values that favor marriage, family, and children ... Pornographic scripts dwell on sexual engagements of parties who have just met, who are in no way attached or committed to each other, and who will part shortly, never to meet again ... Sexual gratification in pornography is not a function of emotional attachment, of kindness, of caring, and especially not of continuance of the relationship, as such continuance would translate into responsibilities, curtailments, and costs ...&lt;ref&gt;Zillmann, pages 16-17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Other contemporary researchers disagreed, McKay &amp; Dolf noting "neglected in work on pornography is that adults capable of functioning in contemporary society are also quite able to distinguish the difference between reality and fantasy. That such a point requires stating is indicative of the overly simplistic model of human behaviour which is reflected in this type of work."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=McKay|first1=H.B.|last2=Dolff|first2=D.J|title='The Impact of Pornography: An Analysis of Research and Summary of Findings';  Working Papers on Pornography and Prostitution Report No. 3|date=1984|publisher=Department of Justice, Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effects as [[Gail Dines]] summarizes Zillman's 1989 study, include "alters perceptions of sexuality; specifically, it fosters presumptions of popularity for less common sexual practices; breeds discontent with the physical appearance and the sexual performance of intimate partners; trivializes rape as a criminal offense and also trivializes sexual child abuse as a criminal offense; and promotes insensitivity toward victims of sexual violence and promotes men's beliefs that they would be capable of committing rape. In addition, habitual male consumers of common pornography appear to be at greater risk of becoming sexually callous and sexually violent toward women than occasional users."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dines|first1=Gail|title=Pornland : how porn has hijacked our sexuality|date=2010|publisher=Beacon Press|location=Boston|isbn=0807044520}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Bryant|editor-first1=D. Zillmann, J.|title=Pornography : research advances and policy considerations|date=1989|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|location=Hillsdale (New Jersey)|isbn=0805806156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Avedon Carol]] has explained of Zillmann's term "sexually callous" that he meant "a greater tolerance for homosexuality; a belief that women should be able to choose other priorities beside motherhood; less belief in marriage; a belief that women may enjoy sex and choose to participate in it for reasons other than pleasing their husbands or conceiving children - in short, the goals of most feminist groups of the time. Zillmann was unable to demonstrate any increase in misogynist or violent attitudes and desires, although he did try." and stated of the sponsor of the report "Having noted the varied interpretability of Zillmann and Bryant's findings, the [USA] Surgeon-General's report said that the only reliable findings of the research that supposedly proved men were more callous towards women after looking at pornography was this: the group that saw pornography estimated more accurately the prevalence of sexual practices in society. The control group, which did not see the material, tended to underestimate grossly how common certain sexual acts were" and commented "But even this result may be less reliable than it appears, due to methodological problems. Zillmann and Bryant had tried to include non-students in their research, but many of them left the study group when they discovered they would be asked to look at pornography. This meant that the control group contained a different population - older, perhaps more settled married men, for example - and thus any differences in the answers the groups gave to the questions might only reflect different attitudes among the different groups, and not pornography effects at all. The study was no longer controlled. In the end, the research may only mean that older, married men are less critical of their partners than young, single psychology students, and that such young, educated men have more liberal attitudes about women's roles and homosexuality, and more realistic knowledge of sexual practices in society."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carol|first1=Avedon|title=Nudes, Prudes and Attitudes: Pornography and Censorship|date=1994|publisher=New Clarion Press|location=Gloucester|page=69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Addiction==
[[Pornography addiction]] is a purported [[behavioral addiction]] characterized by [[compulsive]], repeated use of pornographic material until it causes serious negative consequences to one's physical, mental, social, and/or financial well-being.&lt;ref name="dsm-5" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SteinHollander2009"&gt;{{cite book |first1=Dan J. |last1=Stein |first2=Eric |last2=Hollander |first3=Barbara Olasov |last3=Rothbaum |title=Textbook of Anxiety Disorders |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=quQY1R8vsZcC&amp;pg=PA359 |accessdate=24 April 2010 |date=31 August 2009 |publisher=American Psychiatric Pub |isbn=978-1-58562-254-2|pages=359–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid17503551"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Parashar A, Varma A |title=Behavior and substance addictions: is the world ready for a new category in the DSM-V? |journal=CNS Spectr |volume=12 |issue=4 |pages=257; author reply 258–9 |date=April 2007 |pmid=17503551 |doi= |url=http://www.cnsspectrums.com/aspx/articledetail.aspx?articleid=1035}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is no diagnosis of pornography addiction in the current ''[[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]]'' ([[DSM-5]]).&lt;ref name="dsm-5" /&gt; The DSM-5 considered the diagnosis of hypersexuality-related behavioral disorders (to which porn addiction was a subset), but rejected it because "there is insufficient peer-reviewed evidence to establish the diagnostic criteria and course descriptions needed to identify these behaviors as mental disorders."&lt;ref name="dsm-5"&gt;{{Cite book|author=American Psychiatric Association|year=2013|title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders| edition=Fifth|publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing|location=Arlington, VA|pages=481, 797–798|isbn=978-0-89042-555-8|quote=Thus, groups of repetitive behaviors, which some term behavioral addictions, with such subcategories as "sex addiction," "exercise addiction," or "shopping addiction," are not included because at this time there is insufficient peer-reviewed evidence to establish the diagnostic criteria and course descriptions needed to identify these behaviors as mental disorders.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, some psychologists suggest that any [[maladaptive]] sexual symptoms represent a manifestation of an underlying disorder, such as depression or anxiety which is simply manifesting itself sexually, or, alternatively, there is no underlying disorder and the behavior simply is not maladaptive.

Two 2016 neurology reviews found evidence of addiction related brain changes in internet pornography users. Psychological effects of these brain changes are described as desensitization to reward, a dysfunctional anxiety response, and impulsiveness.&lt;ref name=Kraus2016rev/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kuhn2016rev/&gt; Another 2016 review suggests that internet behaviors, including the use of pornography, be considered potentially addictive, and that problematic use of online pornography be considered an "internet-use disorder".&lt;ref name=Brand2016rev/&gt;

===Controlled studies===
{{See also|Correlation does not imply causation}}
A controlled study describes the relationship between given behaviors or environmental conditions and health effects in a laboratory setting in which conditions other than those under study are effectively held constant across groups of participants receiving various levels of the experimental condition(s).  Since it is considered that the only functional difference between groups is the level of experimental condition(s) received, researchers can strongly infer cause-and-effect relationships from [[Statistical significance|statistically significant]] associations between experimental condition(s) and health consequences.  Thus, if executed properly, controlled studies have high levels of [[internal validity]].  However, such studies often suffer from questionable [[external validity]] due to the considerable differences between real-world environments and the experimental context, and the consequent belief that results cannot be generalized beyond that context.&lt;ref name=psychtextbooks/&gt;

The link between pornography and sexual aggression has been the subject of multiple [[Meta-analysis|meta-analyses]].&lt;ref name="g"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/malamuth/pdf/00arsr11.pdf |format=PDF |title=Pornography and Attitudes Supporting Violence Against Women: Revisiting the Relationship in Nonexperimental Studies |first=Gert Martin |last=Hald |first2=Neil |last2=Malamuth |first3=Carlin |last3=Yuen |year=2000 |website=UCLA Division of Social Sciences |accessdate=13 March 2013}}

A meta-analysis conducted in 2015 found that pornography "consumption was associated with sexual aggression in the United States and internationally, among males and females, and in cross-sectional and longitudinal studies. Associations were stronger for verbal than physical sexual aggression, although both were significant. The general pattern of results suggested that violent content may be an exacerbating factor."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A Meta-Analysis of Pornography Consumption and Actual Acts of Sexual Aggression in General Population Studies|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/jcom.12201/abstract|journal = Journal of Communication|date = 2015-12-01|issn = 1460-2466|pages = 183–205|doi = 10.1111/jcom.12201|language = en|first = Paul J.|last = Wright|first2 = Robert S.|last2 = Tokunaga|first3 = Ashley|last3 = Kraus|volume=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable medical source|date=July 2016}}

In an earlier review of this literature Ferguson and Hartley (2009) argued that "it is time to discard the hypothesis that pornography contributes to increased sexual assault behavior".&lt;ref name="Ferguson &amp; Hartley (2009)"&gt;{{citation |last=Ferguson|first=Christopher J.|title=The pleasure is momentary...the expense damnable?  The influence of pornography on rape and sexual assault.|url=http://www.christopherjferguson.com/pornography.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; They stated that the authors of some studies tended to highlight positive findings while deemphasizing null findings, demonstrating confirmation bias in the published literature.  Ferguson and Hartley concluded that controlled studies, on balance, were not able to support links between pornography and sexual violence.

===Epidemiological studies===
An [[epidemiological]] study describes the association between given behaviors or environmental conditions, and physical or psychological health by means of observation of real-world phenomena through statistical data.  Epidemiological studies generally have high levels of [[external validity]], insofar as they accurately describe events as they occur outside of a laboratory setting, but low levels of [[internal validity]], since they do not strongly establish cause-and-effect relationships between the behaviors or conditions under study, and the health consequences observed.&lt;ref name=psychtextbooks&gt;*Mitchell, M. and Jolley, J.

Danish criminologist [[Berl Kutchinsky]]'s ''Studies on Pornography and sex crimes in Denmark'' (1970), a scientific report ordered by the Presidential Commission on Obscenity and Pornography, found that the legalizing of pornography in [[Denmark]] had not resulted in an increase of [[sex crimes]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://home20.inet.tele.dk/gorzelak/dps/anmeldelser/barbano_kutchinsky.html [[Berl Kutchinsky]]: ''Studies on Pornography and sex crimes in Denmark''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071030030642/http://home20.inet.tele.dk/gorzelak/dps/anmeldelser/barbano_kutchinsky.html |date=2007-10-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since then, many other experiments have been conducted, either supporting or opposing the findings of [[Berl Kutchinsky]], who would continue his study into the social effects of pornography until his death in 1995. His life's work was summed up in the publication ''Law, Pornography, and Crime: The Danish Experience'' (1999). Milton Diamond from the [[University of Hawaii]] found that the number of reported cases of child sex abuse dropped markedly immediately after the ban on sexually explicit materials was lifted in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/BIB/DIAM/effects_pornography.htm The Effects of Pornography: An International Perspective] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120203171037/http://www2.hu-berlin.de/sexology/BIB/DIAM/effects_pornography.htm |date=2012-02-03 }} [[University of Hawaii]] Porn 101: Eroticism, Pornography, and the First Amendment: Milton Diamond Ph.D.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some researchers claim there is a correlation between pornography and a decrease of sex crimes,&lt;ref name="BK-PDF" /&gt;&lt;ref name="JSI-Summer1973" /&gt;&lt;ref name="JWS-book" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BK-1970" /&gt;&lt;ref name="PDF-200707" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SSRN-20060623" /&gt; including Diamond (author of a review from 2009).&lt;ref name="MD-2009" /&gt; ''The effects of Pornography: An International Perspective'' was an epidemiological study which found that the massive growth of the pornography industry in the United States between 1975 and 1995 was accompanied by a substantial decrease in the number of sexual assaults per capita, and reported similar results for Japan.&lt;ref name="intern"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hawaii.edu/PCSS/online_artcls/pornography/prngrphy_ovrvw.html|title=The effects of Pornography: An International Perspective|last=Diamond|first=Milton|website=University of Hawaii System|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080115001619/http://www.hawaii.edu/PCSS/online_artcls/pornography/prngrphy_ovrvw.html|archivedate=2008-01-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Findings of this nature have been critiqued by Robert Peters, president of [[Morality in Media]], on the grounds that the results are better explained by factors other than the increased prevalence of pornography: "a more plausible explanation is that if there is a decline in "forcible rape," it is the result of a tremendous effort to curb rape through community and school-based programs, media coverage, aggressive law enforcement, DNA evidence, longer prison sentences, and more."&lt;ref name="OC-20060804"&gt;{{cite web |last=Peters |first=Robert |title=‘Could it be that pornography prevents rape?’ |url=http://www.obscenitycrimes.org/noprevent.cfm |date=4 August 2006 |work=ObscenityCrimes.org |deadurl=yes |archivedate=2006-10-01 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061001185806/http://www.obscenitycrimes.org/noprevent.cfm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, a review of epidemiological studies by Neil M. Malamuth found that the quantity of pornographic material viewed by men was positively correlated with degree to which they endorsed sexual assault.&lt;ref name="Malamuth"&gt;{{cite book|last=Malamuth|first=Neil M.|title=Do Sexually Violent Media Indirectly Contribute to Antisocial Behavior?|publisher=Public Health Service of United States|date=August 4, 1986|pages=38|url=http://profiles.nlm.nih.gov/NN/B/C/K/W/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Malamuth's work describes Check (1984), who found among a diverse sample of [[Canadians|Canadian]] men that more exposure to pornography led to higher acceptance of [[rape myth]]s, violence against women, and general sexual callousness. In another study, Briere, Corne, Runtz and Neil M. Malamuth, (1984) reported similar correlations in a sample involving college males. On the other hand, the failure to find a statistically significant correlation in another previous study led Malamuth to examine other interesting correlations, which took into account the information about [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] the samples obtained in their childhood, and pornography emerged as the second most important source of information.&lt;ref name="Malamuth" /&gt;  Malamuth's work has been criticized by other authors, however, such as Ferguson and Hartley (2009) who argue Malamuth has exaggerated positive findings and has not always properly discussed null findings.&lt;ref name="Ferguson &amp; Hartley (2009)"/&gt;

==Occupational safety and health==
{{main article|STDs in the porn industry}}
Because pornographic film making involves [[unsimulated sex]], usually without [[condom]]s ([[Bareback (sex)|barebacking]]), pornographic actors appear to be particularly vulnerable to [[sexually transmitted disease]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rodriguez-Hart|first1=C|last2=Chitale|first2=RA|last3=Rigg|first3=R|last4=Goldstein|first4=BY|last5=Kerndt|first5=PR|last6=Tavrow|first6=P|title=Sexually transmitted infection testing of adult film performers: is disease being missed?|journal=Sexually transmitted diseases|date=December 2012|volume=39|issue=12|pages=989–94|doi=10.1097/OLQ.0b013e3182716e6e|pmid=23191956}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grudzen|first1=CR|last2=Meeker|first2=D|last3=Torres|first3=J|last4=Du|first4=Q|last5=Andersen|first5=RM|last6=Gelberg|first6=L|title=HIV and STI risk behaviors, knowledge, and testing among female adult film performers as compared to other California women.|journal=AIDS and behavior|date=February 2013|volume=17|issue=2|pages=517–22|doi=10.1007/s10461-011-0090-0|pmid=22101890}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goldstein|first1=BY|last2=Steinberg|first2=JK|last3=Aynalem|first3=G|last4=Kerndt|first4=PR|title=High Chlamydia and gonorrhea incidence and reinfection among performers in the adult film industry.|journal=Sexually transmitted diseases|date=July 2011|volume=38|issue=7|pages=644–8|doi=10.1097/OLQ.0b013e318214e408|pmid=21844714}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[AIDS Healthcare Foundation]] tried several times to have California’s Department of Industrial Relations, Division of Occupational Safety and Health’s Appeals Board force companies in the pornography industry to treat actors and actresses as employees subject to [[occupational safety and health]] regulation; in a 2014 case brought against [[Treasure Island Media]] an administrative judge found that the company did have to comply with regulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fitz-Gerald|first1=Sean|title=Condoms Required for CA Porn Performers: Judge|url=http://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/California-Judge-Issues-Landmark-Ruling-on-Unprotected-Porn-242117921.html|work=NBC Southern California|date=January 27, 2014|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==School-age juveniles==
In the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Association of Teachers and Lecturers]] feels schoolchildren need to be educated about pornography and warned what is reasonable and what is not acceptable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-21938823 |first=Katherine |last=Sellgren |title=BBC News - Pupils 'should be taught about risks of pornography' |date=26 March 2013 |newspaper=BBC News |accessdate=13 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UK children's commissioner initiated a meta-study conducted by researchers at Middlesex University which concluded that pornography is linked to unrealistic attitudes about sex, beliefs that women are sex objects, more frequent thoughts about sex, and found that children and young people who view pornography tend to hold less progressive gender role attitudes.&lt;ref name="middlesexstudy" /&gt; Miranda Horvath stated about this: "But it is not possible to establish causation from correlational studies, and to say whether pornography is changing or reinforcing attitudes."&lt;ref name="middlesexstudy" /&gt;

The '''Egyptian National Library and Archives''' ({{lang-ar|دار الكتب والوثائق القومية}}; "Dar el-Kotob") are located in [[Cairo]] and is the largest [[library]] in [[Egypt]]. The second largest libraries in Egypt are [[Al-Azhar University]] and the [[Bibliotheca Alexandrina]] (New Library of Alexandria). The Egyptian National Library and Archives are a non-profit government organization.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cairo.gov.eg/CairoPortal/Culture%20and%20Arts/libraries%20text.aspx?ID=2|title=The National Library and Archives|last=|first=|date=|website=www.cairo.gov.eg|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The National Library houses several million volumes on a wide range of topics.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It is one of the largest in the world with thousands of ancient collections. It contains a vast variety of [[Arabic]]-language and other Eastern manuscripts, the oldest in the world.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The main library is a seven-story building in Ramlet [[Boulaq]], a district of Cairo. The Egyptian [[National Archives]] are contained in an annex beside the building.

The National Archives, located in an annex beside the library, houses a vast and diverse collection. The holdings are particularly significant to those who work on Egyptian social and [[political history]], although it is open to the public. 

==History==
[[File:Cairo, the Khedival Library.jpg|thumb|left|Cairo, the Khedival Library]]
[[Isma'il Pasha|Khedive Isma'il Pasha]], also known as Ismail the Magificent&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://madmonarchist.blogspot.com/2013/08/monarch-profile-ismail-magnificent.html|title=The Mad Monarchist: Monarch Profile: Ismail the Magnificent, Khedive of Egypt|last=Madmonarchist|date=2013-08-21|website=The Mad Monarchist|access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;, was devoted to cultural development and modernization of Egypt during his rule&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sis.gov.eg/section/2773/2774?lang=en-us|title=The National Library of Egypt Dar al-Kotub at Bab -SIS|website=www.sis.gov.eg|language=en|access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;. He introduced the project of the National Library of Egypt (formerly, Kotub Khana of Egypt) in March 23, 1870. [[Ali Pasha Mubarak]], the Minister of Education of Egypt during that time, was appointed the job of collecting materials to place in the library by Ismail&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. The materials were obtained from Sultans, Princes, and scholars and were taken from Mosques, shrines, and schools to form the library's holdings. In Egypt, a library is called a [[bookhouse]]. [[Ali Pasha Mubarak]] placed many different languages within the collection, a representation of the diverse sources of Egyptian culture and knowledge&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. 

The library, which was originally housed in Darb al-Gamamiz&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.al-furqan.com/world_library_details/id/238800|title=Dar al-Kutub al-Qawmiya (al-Miṣriya) (Egyptian National Library) {{!}} Al-Furqan Islamic Heritage Foundation|website=Al-Furqan|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;, was built to look like the National Library of Paris. Their aim was to emulate the great library's in Europe at the time. After a mandate passed in 1886 that required all new books and publications to be deposited within the library’s holdings, it outgrew its repository&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. A new building was erected for the library in 1904 in Bab al-Khalq and shared its space with the Museum of Islamic Art&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dissertationreviews.org/archives/7355|title=Dar al-Kutub Manuscript Collections, Cairo {{!}} Dissertation Reviews|website=dissertationreviews.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The library was moved to its current and much larger location in 1971, where it overlooks the Nile on the Corniche in Ramle Boulak. The current location is several buildings comprising the library, which has modern features for the public and researchers, book storage, a scientific center, and the administrative offices&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.darelkotob.gov.eg/objectives.aspx|title=دار الكتب والوثائق القومية|website=www.darelkotob.gov.eg|access-date=2018-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

==Contents==
Collections include a wide variety of manuscripts of the [[Qur'an]], written on paper and parchment. Some of which date back to early [[Kufic]] script. Others are written by celebrated [[calligraphy|calligraphers]]. Of Egyptian [[Islam]]ic materials, there is perhaps the outstanding collection of illuminated [[manuscripts]] of the Qur'an in the [[Mamluk]] text-hand, and in Trilinear and [[Rayhan]]i hands. There are also collections of Arabic [[papyri]] from different sites in Egypt, some dating to the 7th century AD or earlier. The library is a mine of information on early Islamic Egypt's social and cultural life. Ancient [[Persian Empire|Persian]] and [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] documents are also part of the collection.
[[File:Outside the Egyptian National Library and Archives.jpg|thumb|Outside the Egyptian National Library and Archives|272x272px]]
The library remains Egypt's largest resource of manuscripts and documents that include more than 57,000 of the most valuable manuscripts in the world. The manuscript collection covers a vast number of subjects, fully documented, dated, and compiled. It also houses a rare number of [[Arabic]] papyri. These are related to marriage, rent, and exchange contracts, as well as records, accounts of taxes, distribution of inheritance, etc. The oldest papyrus group dates back to the year AH 87 (AD 705); only 444 papyri from this collection were published.

The Library also has a large collection of medieval Arabic [[coin]]s from as early as AD 696, which were published by [[Stanley Lane-Poole]], Bernhardt Moritz and recently by [[Norman D. Nicol]], [[Jere L. Bacharach]] and [[Rifa'at al-Nabarawy]] in 1982. These collections are of high archeological value&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;. 

Collections formed by [[Ahmed Taymour|Ahmed Taymour Pasha]], Ahmed Zaki Pasha, Ahmed Tal'aat Bey and Mustafa Fadel all came to the National Library at the end of the 19th century.

== 2014 Car Bombing ==
[[File:Dar-al-kutub-after-friday-24th-bombings.jpg|thumb|Damaged sustained after the 2014 car bombing.]]
On Friday, January 24, 2014, a car bomb meant to destroy the Police Headquarters across the street from the National Library and Archives did quite a bit of damage to the library's building and collections. National Library and Archive head Abdul Nasser Hassan estimated that the losses would be around $2.81 million in repairs&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/News/92430.aspx|title=Bomb damages Egypt's National Library and Archives - Islamic - Heritage - Ahram Online|website=english.ahram.org.eg|language=en|access-date=2018-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Lighting and ventilation systems were destroyed, along with the Islamic architectural facade, which crumbled to the ground. Showcases and displays containing irreplaceable ancient manuscripts and papyri were damaged, along with all the furniture in the building. The conservation staff at the National Library and Archive's were able to save the documents on display, although they did sustain some damage&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://anitachowdry.wordpress.com/2014/01/27/preserving-treasures-in-cairos-national-library-and-archives/|title=Preserving treasures in Cairo’s National Library and Archives|date=2014-01-27|work=Anita Chowdry|access-date=2018-11-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''''Elfie Hopkins''''' is a British [[horror film]] directed by Ryan Andrews and co-written by Riyad Barmania and Ryan Andrews. It stars [[Jaime Winstone]], [[Ray Winstone]], [[Steven Mackintosh]], [[Rupert Evans]], [[Aneurin Barnard]] and [[Kimberley Nixon]]. The film tells the story of an aspiring detective, Elfie Hopkins (Jaime Winstone), who stumbles into her first real case, when investigating the mysterious new family, the Gammons, in her neighbourhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/27292|title=A Violent Teaser for 'Elfie Hopkins', Cannibal Hunter!|accessdate=20 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was released in the UK on 20 April 2012.

==Plot==
''Elfie Hopkins'' tells the story of twenty-two-year-old slacker (Jaime Winstone), a "wanna-be" detective, set in a sleepy hunting village.  She is a stoner and an animal lover, and haunted by the death of her mother and surrounded by her broken father and alcoholic step-mother, Elfie seeks solace and inspiration from the old school detectives in ''[[The Maltese Falcon (1941 film)|The Maltese Falcon]]'' and ''[[Chinatown (1974 film)|Chinatown]]''. She entertains herself, along with her geeky best friend, Dylan ([[Aneurin Barnard]]), by investigating the villagers and upsetting everyone with their imaginative allegations. Elfie's mundane existence is thrown for a spin with the arrival of a family of trendy city dwellers, the Gammons.

The Gammons weave tales of adventure and seduce the villagers with offers of exotic hunting holidays around the world.  It is not long before the villagers are flying off to the four corners of the world. Elfie, despite her best efforts, is not free to the Gammons' charms, but soon smells a rat.  Elfie and Dylan begin investigating the Gammons' life. Bloody violence and pandemonium soon starts to rage in the village and it is no longer just the blood of animals. Elfie discovers the villagers are not making those flights and when she finally uncovers the truth, it is darker than she could have ever imagined.

==Production==
Director Ryan Andrews became friends with Winstone when he was part of the camera crew for ''Daddy's Girl'', an independent Welsh film made in 2006, which also starring Winstone as a teen with a twisted lust for blood. Extending their shared love of fantasy, horror and anything grunge-related, Elfie Hopkins is, says Andrews, "a combination of an eclectic mix of British twee and American grunge – a weird mash-up of two worlds with a heightened comic-strip feel."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/the-winstones--bring-your-daughter-to-the-slaughter-2244939.html|title=The Winstones – Bring your daughter to the slaughter|accessdate=20 February 2012 | location=London|work=The Independent|date=18 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film is based on short film by Andrews called The Gammons and it was this concept that Andrews, with co-writer Riyad Barmania, turned into a feature film script. "The Elfie character played a minor role in the short," explains Andrews. "But after meeting Jaime I knew she could become the main focus and make it something really special and unique in British horror fantasy terms. Elfie is a finely tuned representation of my own childhood memories growing up in rural Wales. I often used to imagine myself as a vampire hunter let loose on a community of surreal country folk. Riyad and I have taken those already magnified experiences and transformed them further... and the film is informed by everything between author Roald Dahl and The Lost Boys to Brit photographer Tim Walker."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shocktillyoudrop.com/news/18539-exclusive-first-images-set-report-from-elfie-hopkins|title=Exclusive: First Images, Set Report from Elfie Hopkins!|accessdate=20 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Winstone says: "Ryan and I have been looking forward to making this film for years since our styles just collided and we really hit it off. It feels the right time to capture that 1990s vibe now."

"Elfie Hopkins has been an alter ego of mine for a while now," Winstone says, "and I can't wait for the world to meet her. She'll kick ass! For me, Elfie's a dream role to play, and I feel there is a gap in the British film industry which we will more than fill! I can't wait to work with Ryan Andrews—he is a young and exciting director with a vision that can match my imagination."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fangoria.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=3478:meet-the-winstones-in-cannibalism-flick&amp;catid=1:latest-news&amp;Itemid=167|title=Meet the Winstones in cannibalism flick|accessdate=20 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]] claimed the film was "sunk by a lame script and mannered performances"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/92731/elfie_hopkins.html Elfie Hopkins] - Time Out, 19 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Total Film]] commented that "The Twin Peaks mood writer/director that Ryan Andrews musters in his sleepy village setting, not to mention the striking costume and production design, has real promise."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.totalfilm.com/reviews/cinema/elfie-hopkins Review - Elfie Hopkins] - Total Film, 9 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt; [[The Observer]] stated it was "an orgy of mistimed jokes, stumbling narration and dim performances."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/apr/22/elfie-hopkins-jaime-winstone-review Elfie Hopkins - Review] - The Observer, 22 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt; However, Peter Bradshaw in [[The Guardian]] wrote that "It doesn't totally take off until the final act, but there's evidence here that Ryan Andrews will become a force to be reckoned with."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/film/2012/apr/19/elfie-hopkins-review] - The Guardian, 19 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Final Fantasy XIII'''''{{efn|{{nihongo|ファイナルファンタジーXIII|Fainaru Fantajī Sātīn}} in Japanese}} is a science fiction [[role-playing video game]] developed and published by [[Square Enix]] for the [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]] consoles and later for the [[Microsoft Windows]] operating system. Released in Japan in December 2009 and worldwide in March 2010, it is the thirteenth title in the mainline ''[[Final Fantasy]]'' series. The game includes fast-paced [[Gameplay of Final Fantasy#Parties and battles|combat]], a new system for the series for determining which abilities are developed for the characters called "Crystarium", and a customizable "Paradigm" system to control which abilities are used by the characters. ''Final Fantasy XIII'' includes elements from the previous games in the series, such as [[Final Fantasy character jobs#Summoner|summoned monsters]], [[chocobo]]s, and [[Gameplay of Final Fantasy#Airships and transport|airships]].

The game takes place in the fictional floating world of Cocoon, whose government, the Sanctum, is ordering a purge of civilians who have supposedly come into contact with Pulse, the much-feared world below. The former soldier [[Lightning (Final Fantasy)|Lightning]] begins her fight against the government in order to save her sister who has been branded as an unwilling servant to a god-like being from Pulse, making her an enemy of Cocoon. Lightning is soon joined by a band of allies, and together the group also become marked by the same Pulse creature. They rally against the Sanctum while trying to discover their assigned task and whether they can avoid being turned into monsters or crystals at the completion.

Development began in 2004, and the game was first announced at [[Electronic Entertainment Expo]] (E3) 2006. ''Final Fantasy XIII'' is the flagship title of the ''[[Fabula Nova Crystallis Final Fantasy|Fabula Nova Crystallis]]'' collection of ''Final Fantasy'' games and is the first game to use Square Enix's [[Crystal Tools]] engine. ''Final Fantasy XIII'' received mostly positive reviews from [[video game journalism|video game publications]], which praised the game's [[video game graphics|graphics]], presentation, and battle system. The game's story received a mixed response from reviewers, and its [[nonlinear gameplay|linearity]] compared to previous games in the series was mostly criticized. Selling 1.7 million copies in Japan in 2009, ''Final Fantasy XIII'' became the fastest-selling title in the history of the series. As of 2017, the game has sold over 7 million copies worldwide.&lt;ref name="7M"&gt;[http://jp.ign.com/square-enix/17748/opinion/ffdqrpg] (PS3: 5M+, Xbox 360: 2M+) IGN Japan&lt;/ref&gt; The Microsoft Windows version has sold over 700,000 copies according to SteamSpy. A sequel, titled ''[[Final Fantasy XIII-2]]'', was released in December 2011 in Japan and in February 2012 in North America and PAL regions. A second sequel, titled ''[[Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII]]'', which concludes Lightning's story and the ''Final Fantasy XIII'' series,&lt;ref name="LRlastXIII"/&gt; was released in November 2013 in Japan and in February 2014 in North America and PAL regions. In September 2014, Square Enix announced the ''Final Fantasy XIII'' series has been widely successful and has shipped over 11 million copies worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://press.na.square-enix.com/releases/325/final-fantasy-xiii-series-announced-for-windows-pc |title=FINAL FANTASY XIII SERIES ANNOUNCED FOR WINDOWS PC |publisher=Square Enix |date=September 18, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
The player directly controls the [[player character|on-screen character]] through a third-person perspective to interact with people, objects, and enemies throughout the game. The player can also turn the camera around the characters, which allows for a 360° view of the surroundings.&lt;ref name="MANUAL10"/&gt; The world of ''Final Fantasy XIII'' is rendered to scale relative to the characters in it; instead of a caricature of the character roaming around miniature terrain, as found in the earlier ''Final Fantasy'' games, every area is represented proportionally. The player navigates the [[overworld|world]] by foot or by [[chocobo]].&lt;ref name="MANUAL16"/&gt; Players may save their game to a hard disk drive using save stations, where the player can also purchase items from retail networks or upgrade their weapons.&lt;ref name="MANUAL19"/&gt; An in-game datalog provides a [[bestiary]] and incidental information about the world of ''Final Fantasy XIII''.&lt;ref name="MANUAL12"/&gt; The ''Final Fantasy XIII Ultimate Hits International'' version of the game, released in Japan, also contains an "Easy" mode option.&lt;ref name="VG247epilogue"/&gt;

===Battle system===
[[File:Final Fantasy XIII battle.png|left|thumb|upright=1.1364|The ''Final Fantasy XIII'' battle system, with the "Paradigm Shift" option, the Active Time Battle (ATB) bar filling beneath it with five slots and two actions queued, and the three active characters' [[health (gaming)|health]] and roles displayed. The enemy's name and damage percentage are shown in the upper right corner.]]

As in ''[[Final Fantasy XII]]'', enemies are integrated into the open field and can be approached or avoided by the player. When the player's character touches an enemy, the screen transitions from the regular map to a separate battle screen similar to those used in previous ''Final Fantasy'' titles.&lt;ref name="SEe306"/&gt; A maximum of three characters may be used in battles, which use a variant on the series' traditional [[Gameplay of Final Fantasy#Parties and battles|Active Time Battle]] (ATB) system first featured in ''[[Final Fantasy IV]]''. Under this system, the player selects an action from the [[menu (computing)|menus]], such as Attack, Magic, and Item. Unlike previous games in the series, the player only controls the lead character while the remaining two characters are controlled by the game's [[artificial intelligence]] (AI). Each action requires a specific number of slots on the ATB bar, which continually refills to a set maximum number of slots. The ATB bar gradually increases in size throughout the game from two slots to six.&lt;ref name="IGN update"/&gt; The player may select less than the maximum number of possible actions, or may stop the filling of the ATB bar and perform as many actions as can be done with the current ATB amount. The player may select an autobattle command, which fills the ATB slots with actions chosen automatically. Actions cannot be performed outside of battle, and the characters' health is fully restored after each battle.&lt;ref name="IGN update"/&gt;

Each enemy has a meter, called a chain counter, consisting of a percentage starting at 100 which increases when the enemy is struck by attacks or spells. Attacks by different roles have different effects; some raise the chain by a larger amount while others give the player longer before the chain counter resets. The amount of damage performed by an attack is multiplied by the chain percentage before it is applied to the enemy. When the chain counter reaches a preset amount, different for each enemy, the enemy is placed into Stagger State. In this mode, the enemy has lowered defense and may be launched into the air.&lt;ref name="gradar_review" /&gt; The Paradigm system allows the player to program six different roles which the characters can then assume to perform certain formations in battle in response to the specific conditions. The roles consist of Commando, a [[Final Fantasy character jobs#Warrior|warrior]]-type role; Ravager, a [[Black Mage|black mage]]-type role which uses damage-dealing magic; Medic, a [[Final Fantasy character jobs#White Mage|White Mage]]-type role which can heal and remove negative status ailments; Saboteur, which uses magic to weaken enemies by inflicting negative statuses; Synergist, which uses magic to strengthen allies by giving positive statuses; and Sentinel, which has protective and defensive abilities similar to a [[Final Fantasy character jobs#Paladin|paladin]].&lt;ref name="eurog_review"/&gt; Each of the characters can initially take on only three roles, but the player has access to all of them later in the game (although the other three roles are limited in their abilities for those players which choose them). The player can select which roles the controlled character and the AI characters are using both outside and during battle, which is the only way that the player can control the AI characters during battle.&lt;ref name="eurog_review"/&gt; The player can only choose from specific sets of paradigms that the player has set up beforehand outside of battle.&lt;ref name="gradar_review" /&gt;

Each character can summon a specific Eidolon into battle.&lt;ref name="IGN update"/&gt; These [[Final Fantasy character jobs#Summoner|summoned creatures]] include series staples Odin, Shiva, Alexander, and Bahamut, and newcomers Hecatoncheir and Brynhildr.&lt;ref name="SEofficial"/&gt; When summoned, the Eidolon stays in combat while the characters accompanying the summoner leave the party.&lt;ref name="IGNpreview"/&gt; While an Eidolon is summoned, the player can trigger a feature called Gestalt Mode, in which the Eidolon transforms into a different form and performs different attacks while the summoning character rides them.&lt;ref name="1UPpreview"/&gt;

===Crystarium===
The Crystarium is a leveling system consisting of six crystals and resembles the [[Sphere Grid]] from ''[[Final Fantasy X]]''.&lt;ref name="1UPcryst"/&gt;&lt;ref name="OFFGUIDE154"/&gt; Each crystal in the Crystarium represents one of the six Paradigms, and is divided into ten levels. Each level contains various nodes that supply bonuses to health, strength, or magic, or provide new abilities and accessory slots. These nodes are connected by a semi-linear path. The player may advance down the path by acquiring Crystarium Points, which are awarded after defeating enemies.&lt;ref name="MANUAL36"/&gt; The full Crystarium is not available to the player at the beginning of the game; at specific points in the game's plot, the player gains access to new crystals or levels.&lt;ref name="EUROGcryst"/&gt;

==Synopsis==

===Setting===
''Final Fantasy XIII'' is set on the world of Gran Pulse (often simply called Pulse). Central to the story is Cocoon, a massive artificial sphere that floats above Pulse's surface and is ruled by the Sanctum, a [[Theocracy|theocratic]] government. The two worlds are controlled by fal'Cie {{IPAc-en|f|æ|l|ˈ|s|iː}}, mechanical beings with godlike power. The Cocoon fal'Cie are responsible for keeping Cocoon floating, as well as providing light and water to the people that live inside. Each fal'Cie handles a specific task.&lt;ref name="DATALOGfalcie"/&gt; The fal'Cie have the capability of marking the humans that live in Pulse and Cocoon as their servants. These servants, called l'Cie {{IPAc-en|l|ə|ˈ|s|i:}}, are branded with a symbol representing either Pulse or Cocoon and are given a "Focus"—a task to complete.&lt;ref name="xbox trailer"/&gt; If the l'Cie complete their task in time, they are transformed to crystal and according to legend gain eternal life; otherwise they become mindless monsters called Cie'th {{IPAc-en|s|iː|θ|}}.&lt;ref name="HopeScan"/&gt; The l'Cie are not explicitly told their Focus, but are instead given visions that they must interpret.&lt;ref name="DATALOGlcie"/&gt;

Several hundred years before the events of the game, a battle known as the War of Transgression took place between Pulse and Cocoon. During the battle, l'Cie from Pulse attacked and ripped a large hole in Cocoon.&lt;ref name="DATALOGwar"/&gt; Eventually, the l'Cie completed their focus and were turned to crystal. The hole was patched with material lifted from Pulse, and Cocoon's citizens have since lived in fear of another invasion; this fear is used by the Sanctum to remain in power.&lt;ref name="DATALOGartifacts"/&gt; The Sanctum oversees two military branches: the Guardian Corps, responsible for keeping order on Cocoon, and the Public Security and Intelligence COMmand (PSICOM), the special forces in charge of dealing with any threat related to Pulse.&lt;ref name="DATALOGpsicom"/&gt; The fal'Cie have given the humans advanced technology, including flying airships and mechanical creatures, and a form of magic also exists. This magic is normally only accessible to l'Cie, fal'Cie, and various monsters in Cocoon and Pulse, though distilled chemical forms can be used by normal humans through the use of Manadrives.&lt;ref name="DATALOGamp"/&gt;

===Characters===

===Plot===
[[File:Final Fantasy XIII Cast.png|upright=1.164|thumb|The playable cast of ''Final Fantasy XIII''. From left to right: [[Sazh Katzroy]], [[Snow Villiers]], [[Hope Estheim]], [[Lightning (Final Fantasy)|Lightning]], [[Oerba Yun Fang]], and [[Oerba Dia Vanille]]]]

In Cocoon, the citizens of the town of Bodhum are being evicted, or Purged, after coming in contact with something from Pulse.&lt;ref name="DATALOGpurge"/&gt; Over the course of the game, the player is shown flashbacks of the events of the previous thirteen days, which began when a fal'Cie from Pulse was discovered near Bodhum. Lightning's sister Serah had found the fal'Cie from Pulse and been changed into a l'Cie by it. Lightning and Sazh derail a Purge train bound for Pulse in an attempt to save Serah. As Snow leads his resistance group NORA to rescue the Purge exiles, several of them are killed. Heading to the fal'Cie Anima to save Serah, Snow is joined by two of the exiles: Hope and Vanille. The two parties meet at the fal'Cie, and find Serah just as she turns to crystal. Anima then brands them as l'Cie and they are cast out into a different part of Cocoon. During this transformation, the newly crested l'Cie all have the same vision: a monster called Ragnarok.&lt;ref name="DATALOGragnarok"/&gt; Arguing over the ambiguous nature of the dreamed Focus, the party finds Serah in her crystallized form; Snow remains with her as the others leave.

Snow meets Cid and Fang, two members of the Cavalry, after he is captured and detained aboard the [[airship]] ''Lindblum''. Meanwhile, the others flee from PSICOM before getting separated by an airstrike; Hope and Lightning travel to Palumpolum, while Sazh and Vanille travel to Nautilus. In Lightning's scenario, she unintentionally supports Hope's goal of killing Snow to avenge his mother's death.&lt;ref name="DATALOGassassinate"/&gt; In Vanille's scenario, Sazh discusses how his son Dajh was turned into a l'Cie by a Cocoon fal'Cie and was taken by PSICOM to discover his Focus.&lt;ref name="QUOTEdajh"/&gt; In Palumpolum, Lightning attempts to dissuade Hope from going through with his revenge and meets Snow and Fang. Fang reveals that she and Vanille were l'Cie from Pulse who were turned into crystals; they were turned back into humans 13 days earlier, sparking the Purge.&lt;ref name="QUOTEfang"/&gt; Hope attempts to murder Snow, but after being rescued during an airstrike, he decides not to go through with it.&lt;ref name="DATALOGnoraover"/&gt; The four then flee the city with Cid's aid. In Nautilus, Vanille reveals herself to Sazh as a l'Cie from Pulse, and indirectly the reason that Dajh was turned into a l'Cie.&lt;ref name="QUOTEvanille"/&gt; Sazh and Vanille are then captured and detained on board the airship ''Palamecia''.

On the ''Palamecia'', the other members of the party reunite with Vanille and Sazh before they confront Galenth Dysley, the Sanctum's Primarch, who is the Cocoon fal'Cie ruler Barthandelus in disguise.&lt;ref name="QUOTEdysley"/&gt; Barthandelus tells the party that their Focus is to transform into the beast Ragnarok and slay the sleeping fal'Cie Orphan, who keeps Cocoon afloat above Pulse. Slaying Orphan will result in the destruction of Cocoon. The party flees and learns from Cid that the fal'Cie believe that Cocoon's destruction will summon the Maker, the creator of the worlds. The fal'Cie cannot harm Orphan themselves.&lt;ref name="DATALOGorphan"/&gt; Vanille and Fang reveal to the party that they were involved in the War of Transgression centuries earlier, and that their Focus then had been the same: to transform into Ragnarok and attempt to destroy Orphan.&lt;ref name="DATALOGfangragna"/&gt; The party flies away to Pulse and journeys to Oerba, Vanille and Fang's hometown, where they hope to learn how to remove their l'Cie marks. The town is deserted, and they find no living people on the surface. The party is unsuccessful in removing their marks, and Barthandelus confronts them again. The party learns that Barthandelus has made Cid the new Primarch to create chaos in Cocoon to force the Cavalry to attack Cid and Orphan in a [[coup d'état]].&lt;ref name="DATALOGcoup"/&gt;

The party infiltrates Cocoon and heads towards Orphan but soon discover that the Cavalry have been turned into Cie'th. The party defeats Barthandelus, but Orphan awakens and merges with Barthandelus, then compels Fang to finish her Focus as Ragnarok while the others are seemingly transformed into Cie'th. The party reappears in human form, preventing Fang from transforming. The party defeats Orphan&lt;ref name="QUOTEfinalbattle"/&gt; and escapes Cocoon, which is now falling towards Pulse. As the rest of the party turns to crystal for completing their Focus, Vanille and Fang remain on Cocoon and transform into Ragnarok together to prevent a collision between Cocoon and Pulse. The rest of the party awaken from their crystallization on Pulse and find their l'Cie brands gone; Lightning, Hope, Snow and Sazh reunite with Serah and Dajh.

==Development==
[[File:Motomu Toriyama - Game Developers Conference 2010.jpg|thumb|left|Director and scenario designer [[Motomu Toriyama]] at the 2010 [[Game Developers Conference]]]]
Development of ''Final Fantasy XIII'' began in February 2004, shortly after the release of ''[[Final Fantasy X-2 International + Last Mission]]'' in Japan.&lt;ref name="SUint" /&gt; At the time, the project was internally referred to by the codename "Colors World".&lt;ref name="XIIIcodename"/&gt; Over the first year, director [[Motomu Toriyama]] and scenario conceptor [[Kazushige Nojima]] conceived ideas for the plot. Nojima thought up the crystal mythology that became the basis for the ''Fabula Nova Crystallis'' series, including concepts such as the fal'Cie and l'Cie. Toriyama then created a story premised on this mythology. He wanted to portray "characters at the mercy of a predetermined, unjust fate" who "belong together but collide heavily". In order to achieve this, each of the story's thirteen chapters was made to focus on different protagonists. Chapters seven and eight were to mark a turning point in the interpersonal relationships of the party.&lt;ref name="SUscenint"/&gt;

In March 2006, when the structural part of the narrative started to come together, lead scenario writer [[Daisuke Watanabe]] joined the team. Toriyama gave him a rough outline of the first eight chapters, which included several cornerstone scenes that needed to be kept, like when party members were separated or reunited. He told Watanabe what he wanted to express with the scenario, and asked him to flesh out the story and to strengthen how the points in his outline connected.&lt;ref name="SUscenint"/&gt; For example, Toriyama's rudimentary instructions in the document would say "Snow and Hope reconcile".&lt;ref name="SUscenint"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FamitsuWatanabe" /&gt; Watanabe had to decide about how the scenes with this reconciliation would play out, then write the scenario that way. To emphasize what the story tried to express, Watanabe adjusted the personalities Toriyama had given to each character. For example, he felt that the party should not have a "reliable and calm leader type" at the beginning of the story, in order to more accurately show the confusion and unease after the protagonists transform into l'Cie. Toriyama has said that one of the storytelling challenges was the despair of the characters and the many points at which they are seemingly cornered. He mentioned the scene where Sazh tries to commit suicide as one such example: Although Toriyama felt it was "almost a little too dark", he wanted to include something like it in the game. In contrast, he said that lighthearted elements such as Sazh's Chocobo chick helped maintain a good balance.&lt;ref name="SUscenint"/&gt;

At the beginning of the development, the game was intended to be released on the [[PlayStation 2]].&lt;ref name="1UP 2006"/&gt; In May 2005, however, after the positive reception of the tech demo of ''[[Final Fantasy VII]]'', the team decided to move the game to the [[PlayStation 3]] and developed it with the new [[Crystal Tools]] engine, a [[History of video game consoles (seventh generation)|seventh generation]] multiplatform [[game engine]] created by Square Enix for its next generation games.&lt;ref name="IGNupdate"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Development"/&gt; Square Enix believed that developing a new engine would speed up development time later in the project, though it would initially cause a delay in the game's development. However, the delay was longer than originally anticipated as the engine had to accommodate the requirements of several other games in addition to ''XIII''.&lt;ref name="GDpostmortem"/&gt; Another factor in the platform move was the delayed release of ''Final Fantasy XII'', which came out a very short time before the release of the PlayStation 3.&lt;ref name="XIIIbeginnings"/&gt; A [[Microsoft Windows|PC]] port was considered during development, but was decided against due to how Square Enix saw the video game market situation at the time as well as additional complexities that Square Enix did not have experience with related to the PC platform, such as security issues.&lt;ref name="XIIIpc"/&gt; ''Final Fantasy XIII'' was first shown at the 2006 [[Electronic Entertainment Expo|E3]] convention.&lt;ref name="E3 06"/&gt; The [[trailer (film)|trailer]] shown was an artistic concept that did not represent the final concept for the game, since at the time there was no playable form of the game.&lt;ref name="GDpostmortem"/&gt; Announced alongside the game was ''Final Fantasy Versus XIII'', later retitled as ''[[Final Fantasy XV]]'', and the [[PlayStation Portable]] game ''[[Final Fantasy Type-0]]'', originally titled ''Final Fantasy Agito XIII'', the three of which form the ''[[Fabula Nova Crystallis Final Fantasy]]'' series.&lt;ref name="IGNe306"/&gt; Square Enix explained that although all three games are thematically linked, they are not directly related in terms of story.&lt;ref name="FFXIII showcased"/&gt;

The developers for ''Final Fantasy XIII'' were divided into multiple areas, with each developer or team focusing only on a specific task such as developing a specific in-game area or modeling characters.&lt;ref name="GDpostmortem"/&gt; Each physical area of the game was developed separately; after an initial design was approved, teams were assigned to a specific location and filled in details without reusing assets from other areas.&lt;ref name="BUmapint"/&gt; Several of the game's developers had worked on previous installments of the series. Director [[Motomu Toriyama]] had worked on ''[[Final Fantasy X]]'' and ''[[Final Fantasy X-2|X-2]]''; producer [[Yoshinori Kitase]] had worked on ''V'' through ''VIII'' and as the producer for ''X'' and ''X-2''; main-character designer [[Tetsuya Nomura]] had performed the same role for ''VII'', ''VIII'', ''X'', and ''X-2'', and battle-system director [[Toshiro Tsuchida]] reprised that role from ''Final Fantasy X''.&lt;ref name="IGNstaff" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GPversus"/&gt; As ''XIII'' was the first ''Final Fantasy'' game for the PlayStation 3, the development team's internal goal was for the game to have the same "gameplay and craftmanship" impact that ''Final Fantasy VII'' and ''X'' had as the first games of the series on their respective consoles. They aimed to sell five&amp;nbsp;million copies of the game.&lt;ref name="GDpostmortem"/&gt; Toriyama wanted the game to be "the ultimate single player [[role-playing game#single player|RPG]]".&lt;ref name="Toriyama Interview"/&gt;

Tsuchida's concept for the battle system was to maintain the strategic nature of command-based battles. The system stemmed from a desire to create battles similar to those found in the film ''[[Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children]]''.&lt;ref name="EUROGadvent"/&gt; [[Magic point]]s (MP), which had been a part of the battle system in previous ''Final Fantasy'' titles, were removed in the game's battle system as Tsuchida and the other designers felt that it gave players an incentive to not use their most powerful magic attacks due to the MP cost, in turn making battles less interesting. The Paradigm system was designed early in the battle system's development, with the intent of making battles rely on quickly changing strategies and feel fast-moving. Originally there were only five roles, but the Saboteur was later added as the designers felt that its abilities were missing from the game and did not fit with the other roles. Together with the maximum of three characters in a combat situation, the groupings of enemies were designed to force the player to switch Paradigms to keep them engaged in the battles.&lt;ref name="BUBATTLEint"/&gt;

Toriyama wanted Lightning to be a new type of female character with an athlete's body and a less feminine nature than some of the previous female characters of the series.&lt;ref name="1UP 2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="1UP E3 2008"/&gt; His guideline to Nomura was to make her "strong and beautiful", and she was intended to be reminiscent of ''Final Fantasy VII''{{'}}s [[Cloud Strife]].&lt;ref name="1UP 2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Famitsu1001"/&gt; Fang was initially meant to be a male character, but the gender was changed to coincide with the updated character designs during the latter part of development.&lt;ref name="IGNfang"/&gt; The graphics capabilities of the PS3 and Xbox 360 compared to previous consoles allowed Nomura to use more complex elements in the character designs than before, such as Lightning's cape and detailed facial features.&lt;ref name="SUCHARint"/&gt; This in turn meant that the art team had to do much more work for each character or area than in previous games.&lt;ref name="SUARTint"/&gt; Nomura did not take an involved role in the creation of the [[3D interactive characters|non-playable characters]].&lt;ref name="SUCHARint"/&gt;

Unlike previous games in the series which were more inspired by Asian locations and culture, ''Final Fantasy XIII'' was intended by the art team to be reminiscent of the United States. Pulse was based on landscape photographs the team took from across the country, and Cocoon was intended to be a "[[melting pot]]" of different ethnicities.&lt;ref name="SUARTint"/&gt; The setting was also given a [[science fiction]] aesthetic to make it stand out more in comparison with other entries in the series.&lt;ref name="XIIIsetting"/&gt; Art director [[Isamu Kamikokuryo]] revealed that many additional scenarios such as Lightning's home, which were functioning in an unreleased build during development, were left out of the final version due to concerns about the game's length and volume.&lt;ref name="content_cut" /&gt; Kamikokuryo said the content they cut was, in itself, enough to make another game.&lt;ref name="content_cut"/&gt; According to Toriyama, the cuts were made in "various stages of [the game's] development", and that some of the content was removed just before the game's completion.&lt;ref name="Toriyama Interview"/&gt; The game, unlike previous titles in the series, includes no explorable town areas; Toriyama said in an interview that the team was unable to make them as graphically appealing as the rest of the game and chose to eliminate them.&lt;ref name="SUint"/&gt; Toriyama intended to have a piece of [[downloadable content]] available for the game that would include a new area, weapons and quests, but was forced to cut it as well due to quality concerns so late in the project and difficulties with the different systems for extra content on the two gaming consoles.&lt;ref name="UOint"/&gt;

A playable demo of ''Final Fantasy XIII'' was included in the Japanese version of ''[[Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children#Final Fantasy VII: Advent Children Complete|Final Fantasy VII Advent Children Complete]]'', released on April 16, 2009.&lt;ref name="PSXEXadvent"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IGNdemo"/&gt; Toriyama stated that the release of the demo, which was not in the original development schedule, helped the team recognize a shared vision for what the game should look and feel like, a problem which had been plaguing the development team up until then. It helped the team prioritize the work that still needed to be done, which increased the development speed for the remainder of the project. The game was intended to appeal to both Western and Japanese audiences, and focus groups from both regions were used. The English [[Language localisation|localization]] began while development was still in progress to lessen the delay between the Japanese and worldwide releases.&lt;ref name="GDpostmortem"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GC 2009 Interview"/&gt; The game was initially going to be released solely for the PlayStation 3, but an Xbox 360 version was announced late in the game's development cycle. The Xbox version, due to technical limitations, runs at a lower resolution (720p maximum) than the PlayStation version and is spread across 3 discs.&lt;ref name="EGxbox"/&gt;

===Music===
{{Main|Music of Final Fantasy XIII}}
[[Masashi Hamauzu]] composed the game's soundtrack; his previous work on the series was as a co-composer for ''[[Final Fantasy X]]'' and as the main composer for ''[[Dirge of Cerberus: Final Fantasy VII]]''.&lt;ref name="IGNstaff"/&gt; The game was the first main-series ''Final Fantasy'' game to not include any compositions by original series composer [[Nobuo Uematsu]]. Although Uematsu was originally announced to compose the main theme of the game, this role was taken over by Hamauzu after Uematsu signed on to compose the soundtrack to ''[[Final Fantasy XIV (2010 video game)|Final Fantasy XIV]]''. The score features some pieces orchestrated by [[Yoshihisa Hirano]], Toshiyuki Oomori, and Kunihito Shiina, with the [[Warsaw Philharmonic Orchestra]].&lt;ref name="SEMOdetails"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SEMOinfo"/&gt; The song "[[My Hands]]", from British singer [[Leona Lewis]]' second album ''[[Echo (Leona Lewis album)|Echo]]'', was chosen to replace ''Final Fantasy XIII'''s original theme song, "[[Kimi ga Iru Kara (Sayuri Sugawara song)|Kimi ga Iru Kara]]" by [[Sayuri Sugawara]], for the game's international release.&lt;ref name="WesternRelease"/&gt; Square Enix president [[Yoichi Wada]] later said that it would have been better if the American branch of the company had produced a theme song from scratch, but a lack of staff led to the decision of licensing an existing song.&lt;ref name="DOlicense"/&gt;

Music from the game has been released in several albums. Square Enix released the main soundtrack album, ''Final Fantasy XIII Original Soundtrack'', on four [[Compact Disc]]s in 2010.&lt;ref name="RPGFOST"/&gt; The album sold 16,000 copies the day of its release.&lt;ref name="ORICONcharts"/&gt; Square Enix released selections from the soundtrack on two [[gramophone record]] albums in 2010: ''W/F: Music from Final Fantasy XIII'' and ''W/F: Music from Final Fantasy XIII Gentle Reveries''.&lt;ref name="SEVINYL1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SEVINYL2"/&gt; An album of arranged pieces from the soundtrack, ''Final Fantasy XIII Original Soundtrack -PLUS-'', was also released by Square Enix in 2010, as was an album of piano arrangements.&lt;ref name="SEMOOSTP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SEMOOSTPI"/&gt; [[For Life Music]] published a single of the theme song for the Japanese version of the game, "Kimi ga Iru Kara" (君がいるから, "Because You're Here"), in 2009.&lt;ref name="RPGFKIR"/&gt;

While the game was released on both PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 in western regions, the game was a PlayStation 3 exclusive in Asian territories.&lt;ref name="PS3asia"/&gt; This was changed in late 2010 when Square Enix announced that the Xbox 360 version would in fact release in Japan, despite many statements to the opposite.&lt;ref name="XIIIxbox"/&gt; It was later released for [[Microsoft Windows]] via [[Steam (software)|Steam]], along with its two sequels.&lt;ref name="XIIIpcrelease"/&gt; ''Final Fantasy XIII'' was the first game in the series to receive an official release in Chinese and Korean.&lt;ref name="chinese version"/&gt; This was the first edition of a ''Final Fantasy'' game in which Japanese voice-overs could be enabled. An [[international version]] of the game for the Xbox 360 called ''Final Fantasy XIII Ultimate Hits International'' was released in Asia on December 16, 2010.&lt;ref name="IGN360"/&gt; The game includes an "Easy" mode option, and features the English voices.

''Final Fantasy XIII'' sold over one&amp;nbsp;million units on its first day of sale in Japan,&lt;ref name="GSUTRA1mil"/&gt; and had sold 1.7&amp;nbsp;million copies for the PlayStation 3 in Japan by the end of 2009, and 1.9&amp;nbsp;million by the end of 2010.&lt;ref name="1UP17mil"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TMB2010"/&gt; Square Enix had anticipated high initial sales for the game and shipped close to two&amp;nbsp;million units for its launch.&lt;ref name="IGN2mil"/&gt; The game sold more than one million copies in North America in its release month. In March 2010, Square Enix stated that ''Final Fantasy XIII'' was the fastest-selling title in the franchise's history.&lt;ref name="GSpyfast"/&gt; By April of the same year, American game sales for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 reached an estimated 800,000 and 500,000 units respectively.&lt;ref name="IGNsales"/&gt; As of January 2013, the game had sold 6.6 million copies worldwide.&lt;ref name="FFXIII sales"/&gt; According to [[Media Create]], [[Women and video games|female gamers]] accounted for nearly a third of the game's Japanese fanbase.&lt;ref name="SIwomen"/&gt; The Steam version has sold over 600,000 copies as of July 2016.&lt;ref name="SteamSales"/&gt; As of July 2012, a combined total of 9.7 million units has been sold on consoles for both ''Final Fantasy XIII'' and its sequel ''Final Fantasy XIII-2''.&lt;ref name="FFXIII sales"/&gt; In September 2014, Square Enix announced the ''Final Fantasy XIII'' series has been widely successful and has shipped over 11 million copies worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://press.na.square-enix.com/releases/325/final-fantasy-xiii-series-announced-for-windows-pc |title=FINAL FANTASY XIII SERIES ANNOUNCED FOR WINDOWS PC #2 |publisher=Square Enix |date=September 18, 2014 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150209162441/http://press.na.square-enix.com/releases/325/final-fantasy-xiii-series-announced-for-windows-pc |archivedate=February 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2017, the game has sold over 7 million copies worldwide.&lt;ref name="7M"/&gt;

''Final Fantasy XIII'' received generally positive reviews. [[Review aggregator]] website [[Metacritic]] gave the PlayStation 3 version 83/100 based on 83 reviews,&lt;ref name="mc_ps3" /&gt; the Xbox 360 version 82/100 based on 54 reviews,&lt;ref name="mc_360" /&gt; and the Microsoft Windows version 65/100 based on 6 reviews.&lt;ref name="mc_pc" /&gt; It was rated 39 out of 40 by the Japanese gaming magazine ''[[Famitsu]]''.&lt;ref name="FAMITSUreview"/&gt; ''[[Dengeki PlayStation|Dengeki]]'' praised the game for the battle system, stating that the battles are by far the most exciting in the series, and concluded ''Final Fantasy XIII'' deserved a score of 120, as 100 would not be enough.&lt;ref name="Dengeki"/&gt; The game was voted as the second best game of 2009 in Dengeki Online's reader poll,&lt;ref name="DENGEKIreview"/&gt; and in January 2010, it was voted the best game ever in ''Famitsu''{{'s}} reader poll.&lt;ref name="FAMITSUpoll"/&gt; The game received a Best RPG of the year award nomination at the [[Spike Video Game Awards]], but lost to ''[[Mass Effect 2]]''.&lt;ref name="SPIKEnom"/&gt; It won the "Future Division" award at the Japan Game Awards 2009 and later won a Game Designers Award at the Japan Game Awards 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hd.square-enix.com/eng/company/award/index.html |title=Award-Winning |publisher=[[Square Enix]] |date=2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160518044749/http://www.hd.square-enix.com/eng/company/award/index.html |archivedate=May 18, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Universal praise was given to the technical milestones achieved by the game's graphics and presentation. ''[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]'' felt that Cocoon in particular was an "inspired setting [...] blessed with a vibrancy and vivid colour that often leaves you open-mouthed".&lt;ref name="edge_review"/&gt; [[GameSpot]] called the art design "magnificent".&lt;ref name="gspot_review"/&gt; Further praise was given to the [[cutscene|pre-rendered animation sequences]]&lt;ref name="cvg_review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="vg_review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wired_review" /&gt; and the almost seamless transition of visual quality between these and the realtime gameplay.&lt;ref name="vg_review" /&gt; Many also appreciated the game's soundtrack,&lt;ref name="cvg_review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gspot_review" /&gt; with Masashi Hamauzu providing "a score with catchy hooks and blood-pumping battle melodies", according to ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]''.&lt;ref name="wired_review" /&gt;

The battle system of ''Final Fantasy XIII'' received widespread praise. The increased pace of battles was appreciated, with several reviews describing it as "thrilling";&lt;ref name="eurog_review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cvg_review" /&gt; ''Edge''{{'}}s description of the battle system summarized it as "among the genre's finest".&lt;ref name="edge_review" /&gt; [[1UP.com]] said that "Despite the fact that two-thirds of your party is AI-controlled, FFXIII's battles may be the most involving the series has ever seen."&lt;ref name="1up_review"/&gt; The story got a mixed reception, with ''Wired'' remarking that the plot was "a little more human and less esoteric than in previous games".&lt;ref name="wired_review" /&gt; 1UP.com felt that the story was "hardly world-class writing", but that the writers clearly knew the medium well and had attempted to avoid clichés.&lt;ref name="1up_review" /&gt; Reviewers felt that the characters worked well together,&lt;ref name="1up_review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gspot_review" /&gt; and that the interactions among them as the game progressed made up for shortcomings in the story.&lt;ref name="eurog_review" /&gt;

===Linearity===
While critics generally praised Square Enix's attempt to revitalize the ''Final Fantasy'' series formula, many reacted negatively to the linear nature of the game, especially in the first ten chapters on Cocoon,&lt;ref name="1up_review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="joystiq_review"/&gt; an issue which many felt was compounded by the large reduction of towns, free-roaming capabilities, and interaction with non-player characters.&lt;ref name="gamepro_review" /&gt; ''[[GamePro]]'' described the gameplay as "a long hallway toward an orange target symbol on your mini-map that triggers a cutscene, a boss fight, or both,"&lt;ref name="gamepro_review"/&gt; and 1UP.com criticized the linear aspect as the game's "biggest shortcoming", and felt the first section was "superficial."&lt;ref name="1up_review" /&gt; ''Edge'' and others awarded the game especially lower scores as a result of these aspects, with ''Edge'' in particular lowering the score they awarded the game to a five out of ten primarily due to the game's linear nature.&lt;ref name="edge_review" /&gt;

In contrast, reviewers from [[GamesRadar]] and ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' appreciated the linear nature; the former stated that "the streamlined, focused structure eliminates potential tedium without dumbing anything down",&lt;ref name="gradar_review"/&gt; while the latter felt it was "a clever move",&lt;ref name="cvg_review" /&gt; and kept the player from being "[bogged] down with mundane number crunching, [and] finicky and repetitive leveling-up."&lt;ref name="cvg_review"/&gt; Many negatively noted the gradual unfurling of the player's abilities over this first part of the game, from battle gameplay to selecting the party leader.&lt;ref name="eurog_review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="1up_review" /&gt; Combined with the game's linear nature, some reviews went as far as to describe these chapters as "boring" until the world of Gran Pulse was revealed.&lt;ref name="edge_review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wired_review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="joystiq_review" /&gt; ''Edge'' noted that while it did not do enough to make up for the opening chapters, at Gran Pulse the game "hits a sweet spot" as the narrative offers "hunting side-quests and the simple joy of exploring to see what visual marvel is around the next corner."&lt;ref name="edge_review" /&gt;

===Response to criticism===
After release, director Motomu Toriyama felt that the lower-than-expected review scores for a main ''Final Fantasy'' series game came from reviewers who approached the game from a Western point of view. These reviewers were used to games in which the player was given an [[open world]] to explore, he said, noting that this expectation contrasted with the vision the team set out to create. He noted that it "becomes very difficult to tell a compelling story when you're given that much freedom".&lt;ref name="CVGresponse"/&gt; Yoshinori Kitase stated that they "didn't really intend to work within the RPG template," but "wanted to create a new game, even a new genre." He stated that "in a lot of senses FFXIII is more like an [[First-person shooter|FPS]] than an RPG."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Parish|first=Jeremy|title=Final Fantasy XIII is Not an RPG|url=http://www.1up.com/previews/final-fantasy-xiii-rpg|publisher=[[1UP.com]]|accessdate=March 16, 2012|date=February 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Toriyama and Kitase later said, in July 2011, that the biggest complaints about the game were that it was too linear and that there was not enough interaction between the player and the world, which they described as a lack of towns and [[Minigames of Final Fantasy|minigames]] compared to the previous ''Final Fantasy'' games. They also named the amount of time it took to access all of the gameplay elements as a common criticism, saying that people interpreted it as a "lengthy tutorial".&lt;ref name="GSKITTORint"/&gt;

[[Yoichi Wada]], then-president of Square Enix, made his thoughts about the reception of the game known to [[Gamasutra]]. He said "some value it highly and some are not very happy with it".&lt;ref name="GSUTRAresponse"/&gt; He added, "Should ''Final Fantasy'' become a new type of game or should ''Final Fantasy'' not become a new type of game? The customers have different opinions. It's very difficult to determine which way it should go."&lt;ref name="GSUTRAresponse"/&gt;

===Windows port===
Square Enix released a Microsoft Windows port of the game in October 2014, where it was met with a more critical reception than the original versions. ''[[PC Gamer]]''{{'}}s Samuel Roberts, when reviewing the port, criticized not only the original gameplay, but heavily criticized the quality of the port itself, decrying the low resolution, limited graphical options and low framerate. He was especially critical of the time taken for the port given that an unofficial patch was produced by [[mod (video gaming)|modder]] Peter Thoman within a day of release that fixed many of the issues.&lt;ref name="PCGreview"/&gt; Michael McWhertor of [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] also noted a similar critical response by consumers.&lt;ref name="PGfans"/&gt; A patch was released by Square Enix in December 2014, which was noted by Thoman as adding only the graphical features that his external patch had, with no other additions or performance improvements.&lt;ref name="PCGpatch"/&gt;

==Sequels==
{{main|Final Fantasy XIII-2|Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII}}
At the Square Enix First Production Department Conference held on January 18, 2011, Square Enix announced that they were developing a direct sequel to ''Final Fantasy XIII'', entitled ''[[Final Fantasy XIII-2]]'', which they intended to build on the game's story and characters while taking on board the criticism and other feedback about the original. It was released on December 15, 2011, in Japan, January 31, 2012, in North America and February 3, 2012, in Europe, for both the PlayStation 3 and the Xbox 360.&lt;ref name="XIII-2release"/&gt;&lt;ref name="XIII-2PS3special"/&gt; Motomu Toriyama and Yoshinori Kitase returned to their respective roles as director and producer. The game begins three years after the events of ''Final Fantasy XIII'', and features Serah and newcomer Noel as the main protagonists. ''XIII-2'' is the fifth sequel game in the ''Final Fantasy'' series, after ''[[Final Fantasy X-2]]'', ''[[Dirge of Cerberus: Final Fantasy VII]]'', ''[[Final Fantasy XII: Revenant Wings]]'', and ''[[Final Fantasy IV: The After Years]]''. Most of the team returned again to create a second sequel entitled ''[[Lightning Returns: Final Fantasy XIII]]'', meant to wrap up the story of Lightning and the ''Final Fantasy XIII'' universe.&lt;ref name="LRfamitsu"/&gt; The game was released in November 2013 in Japan and in February 2014 in North America and Europe.&lt;ref name="LRrelease"/&gt; Toriyama stated in the ''[[List of Square Enix companion books|Ultimania Omega]]'' companion book prior to ''XIII-2''{{'}}s announcement that he hoped to write a story "where Lightning ends up happy", though at the time Square Enix had no plans to make a sequel.&lt;ref name="UOint"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2853">[[File:Hokuetsu Seppu Part 2 volume 1.jpg|thumb|160px|''"Hokuetsu Seppu"'']]
'''''Hokuetsu Seppu''''' (北越雪譜 "Snow stories of North Etsu Province"; translation: ''Snow Country Tales: Life in the other Japan'' by Jeffrey Hunter with Rose Lesser, Weatherhill, 1986) is a late [[Edo period|Edo-period]] encyclopedic work of [[human geography]] describing life in the [[Minamiuonuma District, Niigata|Uonuma]] area of [[Japan]]'s old [[Echigo Province]], a place known for its long winters and deep snow.

[[File:Hokuetsu Seppu - Figure of snow crystals.jpg|thumb|left|240px|Figure of snow crystals from ''"Hokuetsu Seppu"'']]
First published in [[Edo]] in 1837, ''Hokuetsu Seppu'' was written by {{nihongo|Suzuki Bokushi|[[:ja:鈴木牧之|鈴木牧之]]}} (1770–1842), a textile merchant and leading townsman of [[Shiozawa, Niigata|Shiozawa]], a settlement on the old Mikuni Highway. The work, an immediate best seller that eventually encompassed seven chapters when a second volume was published in 1841, covers a wide range of local topics from the varieties of snow to the customs, lifestyles, local dialects, industries, and [[folklore|folk tales]] of Japan's [[Snow country (Japan)|snow country]]. The text covers 123 themes from multiple angles and is also richly illustrated with detailed sketches.

{{nihongo|[[Santō Kyōzan]]|[[:ja:山東京山|山東京山]]}}—a [[gesaku]] writer and brother of [[Santō Kyōden]]—assisted with publication of the text. He wrote the preface and drew the illustrations, which were based on Bokushi's originals.

Some of the material in the book is of scientific interest. For example, it contains 
the first Japanese sketches of 86 types of natural [[snow]]flake [[crystal]]s. An 1840 edition included an additional 97 sketches that [[Doi Toshitsura]] made with the aid of a [[microscope]] during his 20 years as [[daimyō]] of the [[Koga Domain]]. Thereafter, the snow crystal became a popular design motif on [[kimono]]s and on [[chawan]], Japanese tea bowls.

{{original research|date=November 2009}}
An '''instrumental''' is a [[musical composition]] or recording without [[lyrics]], or [[singing]], although it might include some inarticulate [[vocal]]s, such as shouted [[backup vocal]]s in a [[Big Band]] setting. The word "song" is widely misused by people in the popular music industry to describe any musical composition, whether sung or played only by instruments. The [[music]] is primarily or exclusively produced using [[musical instrument]]s. An instrumental can exist in [[music notation]], after it is written by a [[composer]]; in the mind of the [[composer]] (especially in cases where the composer himself will perform the piece, as in the case of a [[blues]] solo guitarist or a [[folk music]] [[fiddle]] player); as a piece that is performed live by a single instrumentalist or a [[musical ensemble]], which could range in components from a [[duet|duo]] or [[trio (music)|trio]] to a large [[Big Band]], [[concert band]] or [[orchestra]].

In a [[song]] that is otherwise [[Singing|sung]], a section that is not sung but which is played by instruments can be called an '''instrumental interlude''', or, if it occurs at the beginning of the song, before the singer starts to sing, an instrumental [[introduction (music)|introduction]]. If the instrumental section highlights the skill, musicality, and often the virtuosity of a particular performer (or group of performers), the section may be called a "solo" (e.g., the [[guitar solo]] that is a key section of [[heavy metal music]] and [[hard rock]] songs). If the instruments are [[percussion instrument]]s, the interlude can be called a [[Break (music)|percussion interlude]] or "percussion break". These interludes are a form of [[Break (music)|break]] in the song.

Modern instrumentals are produced using a [[Digital audio workstation|digital audio workstation (DAW)]] such as [[FL Studio]], [[Cubase]] and [[Logic Pro]]. These pieces of software allow instrumental music to be composed with ease.

==In popular music==
In commercial [[popular music]], instrumental tracks are sometimes renderings, [[remix]]es of a corresponding release that features vocals, but they may also be compositions originally conceived without vocals. One example of a genre in which both vocal/instrumental and solely instrumental songs are produced is blues. A [[blues]] band often uses mostly songs that have lyrics that are sung, but during the band's show, they may also perform instrumental songs which only include [[electric guitar]], [[harmonica]], [[upright bass]]/[[electric bass]] and [[drum kit]].

==Opposite concept==
The opposite of instrumental music, that is, music for voices alone, without any [[accompaniment]] instruments, is [[a cappella]], an Italian phrase that means "in the chapel". In [[early music]], instruments such as [[trumpet]] and [[drums]] were considered outdoor instruments, and music for inside a chapel typically used quieter instruments, voices, or just voices alone. A capella music exists in both [[Classical music]] [[choir]] pieces (for choir without any [[accompanist]] [[piano]] or [[pipe organ]]) and in popular music styles such as [[doo wop]] groups and [[Barbershop quartet]]s. For [[genre]]s in which a non-vocal song or interlude is conceived using computers and software, rather than with acoustic musical instruments or [[electronic musical instrument]]s, the term instrumental is still used for it.

==Borderline cases==
Some recordings which include brief or non-musical use of the human voice are typically considered instrumentals. Examples include songs with the following:
* Short verbal interjections (as in "[[Tequila (song)|Tequila]]" or "[[Topsy (instrumental)|Topsy]]" or "[[Wipe Out (instrumental)|Wipe Out]]" or "[[Hustle (song)|The Hustle]]" or "[[Bentley Rhythm Ace (album)|Bentley's Gonna Sort You Out]]")
* Repetitive [[nonsense]] words (e.g., "la la..." (as in "[[Calcutta (song)|Calcutta]]") or "[[Woo-Hoo (Rock-A-Teens song)|Woo Hoo]]")
* Non-musical spoken passages in the background of the track (e.g., "[[To Live Is to Die]]" by [[Metallica]]; "[[Desolation of Eden|Wasteland]]" by [[Chelsea Grin]])
* Wordless vocal effects, such as [[drone (music)|drones]] (e.g., "[[Rockit (song)|Rockit]]" or "[[Flying (Beatles instrumental)|Flying]]")
* [[Vocal percussion]], such as beatbox [[B-sides]] on rap singles
* [[Yodeling]] (e.g., "[[Hocus Pocus (song)|Hocus Pocus]]")
* [[Whistling]] (e.g., "[[I Was Kaiser Bill's Batman]]" or "[[Colonel Bogey March]]")
* Spoken statements at the end of the track (e.g., God Bless the Children of the Beast by [[Mötley Crüe]], [[For the Love of God (instrumental)|For the Love of God]] by [[Steve Vai]])
* Non-musical vocal recordings taken from other media (e.g., "[[Vampires (Godsmack song)|Vampires]]" by [[Godsmack]])
* [[Field recording]]s which may or may not contain non-lyrical words. (e.g., many songs by [[Godspeed You! Black Emperor]] and other [[post-rock]] bands.)

Songs including actual musical—rhythmic, melodic, and lyrical—vocals might still be categorized as instrumentals if the vocals appear only as a short part of an extended piece (e.g., "[[Unchained Melody]]" (Les Baxter), "[[TSOP (The Sound of Philadelphia)]]", "[[Pick Up the Pieces (Average White Band song)|Pick Up the Pieces]]", "[[The Hustle (song)|The Hustle]]", "[[Fly, Robin, Fly]]", "[[Get Up and Boogie (song)|Get Up and Boogie]]", "[[Do It Any Way You Wanna]]", and "[[Gonna Fly Now]]"), though this definition is loose and subjective.

Falling just outside of that definition is "[[Theme From Shaft]]" by [[Isaac Hayes]].

The '''''Jyllands-Posten'' Muhammad cartoons controversy''' (or '''Muhammad cartoons crisis''') ([[Denmark|Danish]]: ''Muhammedkrisen'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Henkel |first=Heiko |title=Fundamentally Danish? The Muhammad Cartoon Crisis as Transitional Drama |journal=Human Architecture: Journal of the Sociology of Self-knowledge |date=Fall 2010 |volume=VIII |series=2 |url=http://www.okcir.com/Articles%20VIII%202/Henkel-FM.pdf |accessdate=25 November 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029194639/http://www.okcir.com/Articles%20VIII%202/Henkel-FM.pdf |archivedate=29 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; began after the [[List of newspapers in Denmark|Danish newspaper]] ''[[Jyllands-Posten]]'' published 12 editorial cartoons on 30 September 2005, most of which depicted [[Muhammad]], a principal figure of the religion of [[Islam]]. The newspaper announced that this was an attempt to contribute to the debate about [[criticism of Islam]] and self-censorship. Muslim groups in [[Denmark]] complained, and the issue eventually led to protests around the world, including violent demonstrations and riots in some [[Muslim world|Muslim countries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title="The Muhammad Cartoon Crisis. The tip of an Iceberg", Japanese religion |last=Jensen |first=Tim |year=2006 |pages=5–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Islam has a strong tradition of [[aniconism]], and it is considered [[Islam and blasphemy|highly blasphemous in most Islamic traditions]] to visually depict Muhammad. This, compounded with a sense that the cartoons insulted Muhammad and Islam, offended many Muslims. Danish Muslim organisations that objected to the depictions responded by petitioning the embassies of Islamic countries and the Danish government to take action in response, and filed a judicial complaint against the newspaper, which was dismissed in January 2006. After the Danish government refused to meet with diplomatic representatives of the Muslim countries and would not intervene in the case, a number of Danish [[imam]]s visited the Middle East in late 2005 to raise awareness of the issue. They presented a dossier containing the twelve cartoons from the ''Jyllands-Posten'', and other information some of which was found to be falsified.&lt;ref name=responsibilities /&gt;&lt;ref name="HH80-84" /&gt;

As a result, the issue received prominent media attention in some Muslim-majority countries, leading to protests across the world in late January and early February 2006. Some escalated into violence resulting in more than 200 reported deaths, attacks on Danish and other European diplomatic missions, attacks on churches and Christians, and a major international boycott. Some groups responded to the outpouring of protest by endorsing the Danish policies, launching "Buy Danish" campaigns and other displays of support. The cartoons were reprinted in newspapers around the world both in a sense of journalistic solidarity and as an illustration in what became a major news story.

Danish Prime Minister [[Anders Fogh Rasmussen]] described the controversy as Denmark's worst international relations incident since the [[Denmark in World War II|Second World War]]. The incident came at a time of heightened political and social tensions between [[Islam by country|Muslim majority countries]] and [[Western world|Western countries]], following several, high-profile [[Islamic terrorism|Islamic terrorist attacks]] in the West{{mdash}}including the [[September 11 attacks]]{{mdash}}and Western military interventions in Muslim countries, such as [[American occupation of Iraq|Iraq]] and [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan]]. The cartoons and the reaction to them aggravated already-strained relations. The relationship between Muslims in Denmark and the broader society was similarly at a low-point, and the conflict came to symbolize the misunderstandings between the Islamic community and the rest of society. In the years since, terrorist plots claiming to be in retaliation for the cartoons have been planned, and some executed, against targets affiliated with newspapers that published the cartoons or Denmark.

Supporters said that the publication of the cartoons was a legitimate exercise of [[Freedom of speech|free speech]] regardless of the validity of the expression, that it was important to openly discuss Islam without fear or that the cartoons made important points about topical issues. The Danish tradition of relatively high tolerance for freedom of speech became a focus of some attention. The controversy ignited a debate about the limits of freedom of expression in all societies, religious tolerance and the relationship of Muslim minorities with their broader societies in the West, and relations between the Islamic World in general and the West. Critics of the cartoons described them as [[Islamophobic]], racist, or baiting and blasphemous to Muslims, possibly intended to humiliate a Danish minority. Others saw them as a manifestation of ignorance about the history of Western imperialism, double standards, and stereotyping.

=== Debate about self-censorship ===
On 16 September 2005, Danish news service [[Ritzau]] published an article discussing the difficulty encountered by the writer [[Kåre Bluitgen]], who was initially unable to find an illustrator prepared to work on his children's book ''The Qur'an and the life of the Prophet Muhammad'' (Danish:''Koranen og profeten Muhammeds liv'').&lt;ref name=hansen&amp;hundevadt&gt;{{cite book |last=Hansen |first=John |title=Provoen og Profeten: Muhammed Krisen bag kulisserne |year=2006 |publisher=Jyllands-Postens Forlag |location=Copenhagen |isbn=87-7692-092-5 |first2=Kim |last2=Hundevadt |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bluitgen |first=Kåre |title=Koranen og profeten Muhammeds liv |year=2006 |publisher=Høst &amp; Søn/Tøkk |isbn=978-87-638-0049-5 |page=268 |url=http://www.digibutik.dk/?ID=250&amp;GroupID=250&amp;ProductID=PROD1179&amp;pgid=GROUP249&amp;qq=8D7SR65SK7TUB%2048D9LG6B%20L7T |others=Anonymous illustrator |language=Danish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150118123641/http://www.digibutik.dk/?ID=250&amp;GroupID=250&amp;ProductID=PROD1179&amp;pgid=GROUP249&amp;qq=8D7SR65SK7TUB%2048D9LG6B%20L7T |archivedate=18 January 2015 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three artists declined Bluitgen's proposal out of fear of reprisals.

One artist agreed to assist anonymously; he said that he was afraid for his and his family's safety.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen &amp; Hundevadt, 13.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Bluitgen, one artist declined due to the murder in Amsterdam of the film director [[Theo van Gogh (film director)|Theo van Gogh]] the year before; another cited the attack in October 2004 on a lecturer at the [[Carsten Niebuhr]] Institute at the [[University of Copenhagen]]; he was assaulted by five assailants who opposed his reading of the Qur'an to non-Muslims during a lecture.&lt;ref name="dybangst" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=9 October 2004 |title=Overfaldet efter Koran-læsning |publisher=TV 2 |url=http://nyhederne.tv2.dk/article.php?id=1424089 |language=Danish |accessdate=16 September 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029202822/http://nyhederne.tv2.dk/article.php?id=1424089 |archivedate=29 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The story gained some traction, and the major Danish newspapers reported the story the following day.&lt;ref name="dybangst"&gt;{{cite news |date=17 September 2005 |title=Dyb angst for kritik af islam ("Profound anxiety about criticism of Islam") |newspaper=Politiken |url=http://politiken.dk/kultur/boger/ECE123660/dyb-angst-for-kritik-af-islam/ |accessdate=19 March 2013 |language=Danish |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029195043/http://politiken.dk/kultur/boger/ECE123660/dyb-angst-for-kritik-af-islam/ |archivedate=29 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The supposed refusals from these first three artists to participate was seen as evidence of self-censorship out of fear of violence from [[Islamist]]s, which led to much debate in Denmark.&lt;ref name="dybangst" /&gt;&lt;ref name="whyipub"&gt;{{cite news |date=19 February 2006 |title=Why I Published Those Cartoons |newspaper=The Washington Post |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/02/17/AR2006021702499.html |first=Flemming |last=Rose |accessdate=16 September 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130923211833/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/02/17/AR2006021702499.html |archivedate=23 September 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Danish news paper Politiken stated at February 12, 2006, that they asked Bluitgen to put them in touch with the artists, so the claim that none of them dared to work with him could be proved. The author refused, and nobody has ever been able to confirm whether the incident is properly described.&lt;ref&gt;Politiken 12. Februar 2006 "''Muhammedsag: Ikke ligefrem en genistreg''"&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Publication ===

At an editorial meeting of ''Jyllands-Posten'' ("The [[Jutland]] Post", Denmark's largest daily newspaper) on 19 September, reporter Stig Olesen mooted the idea of asking the members of the newspaper illustrators union if they would be willing to draw Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen &amp; Hundevadt, 14.&lt;/ref&gt; This would be an experiment to see the degree to which professional illustrators felt threatened. [[Flemming Rose]], culture editor, was interested in the idea and wrote to the 42 members of the union asking them to draw their interpretations of Muhammad.&lt;ref name="whyipub" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hansen &amp; Hundevadt, 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

15 illustrators responded to the letter; three declined to participate, one did not know how to contribute to what he called a vague project, one thought the project was stupid and badly paid, and one said he was afraid.&lt;ref name="Hansen &amp; Hundevadt, 17"&gt;Hansen &amp; Hundevadt, 17.&lt;/ref&gt; 12 drawings had been submitted{{mdash}}three from newspaper employees and two which did not directly show Muhammad.&lt;ref name="Hansen &amp; Hundevadt, 17" /&gt; The editors thought that some of the illustrators who had not responded were employed by other newspapers and were thus contractually prohibited from working for ''Jyllands-Posten.'' In the end, editor-in-chief [[Carsten Juste]] decided that given its inconclusive results, the story was better suited as an opinion piece rather than a news story, and it was decided to publish it in the culture section, entirely under the direction of editor Flemming Rose.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

[[Peter Hervik]], a professor of Migration Studies, has since written that the results of this experiment disproved the idea that self-censorship was a serious problem in Denmark because the overwhelming majority of cartoonists had either responded positively or refused for contractual or philosophical reasons.&lt;ref name=IMER /&gt; Carsten Juste has said that the survey "lacked validity and the story fell short of sound journalistic basis."&lt;ref name=IMER /&gt; Hervik said that this, along with the fact that the most controversial cartoons were drawn by the newspaper's staff cartoonists, demonstrates that the newspaper's "desire to provoke and insult Danish Muslims exceeded the wish to test the self-censorship of Danish cartoonists."&lt;ref name=IMER /&gt;

Rose wrote the editorial which accompanied the cartoons in which he argued there had been several recent cases of self-censorship, weighing freedom of speech against the fear of confronting issues about Islam, so he thought it was legitimate news story. Among the incidents he cited were: the translators of a book critical of Islam did not want their names published; the [[Tate gallery]] in London withdrew an installation by the avant-garde artist [[John Latham (artist)|John Latham]] depicting the Quran, Bible and Talmud torn to pieces, and comedian [[Frank Hvam]] said in an interview with ''Jyllands-Posten'' that he would hypothetically dare to urinate on the Bible on television, but not on the Quran. Rose also mentioned the case of a Danish imam who had met with Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen and "called on the prime minister to interfere with the press in order to get more positive coverage of Islam."&lt;ref name="whyipub" /&gt;

On 30 September 2005, ''Jyllands-Posten'' published an article entitled "''Muhammeds ansigt''" ("The face of Muhammad")  incorporating the cartoons.&lt;ref name="muhammeds_ansigt"&gt;{{cite news |first=Flemming |last=Rose |date=29 September 2005 |title=Muhammeds ansigt |newspaper=Jyllands-Posten |url=http://jyllands-posten.dk/indland/ECE4769352/muhammeds-ansigt/ |language=Danish |accessdate=18 September 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150225235648/http://jyllands-posten.dk/indland/ECE4769352/muhammeds-ansigt/ |archivedate=25 February 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The article consisted of the 12 cartoons and an explanatory text, in which Rose wrote:

{{quote|Modern, secular society is rejected by some Muslims. They demand a special position, insisting on special consideration of their own religious feelings. It is incompatible with contemporary democracy and freedom of speech, where one must be ready to put up with insults, mockery and ridicule. It is certainly not always attractive and nice to look at, and it does not mean that religious feelings should be made fun of at any price, but that is of minor importance in the present context.&amp;nbsp;... we are on our way to a slippery slope where no-one can tell how the self-censorship will end. That is why ''Morgenavisen Jyllands-Posten'' has invited members of the Danish editorial cartoonists union to draw Muhammad as they see him.|Flemming Rose|&lt;ref name="muhammeds_ansigt" /&gt;}}

Later, Rose explained his intent further in ''[[The Washington Post]]'': "The cartoonists treated Islam the same way they treat Christianity, Buddhism, Hinduism and other religions. And by treating Muslims in Denmark as equals they made a point: We are integrating you into the Danish tradition of satire because you are part of our society, not strangers. The cartoons are including, rather than excluding, Muslims."&lt;ref name="whyipub" /&gt; The publication of the cartoons was also accompanied by an editorial titled 'Truslen fra mørket'' ('The Threat from  the Darkness'') condemning Islamic spiritual leaders "who feel entitled to interpret the prophet's word, and cannot abide the insult that comes from being the object of intelligent satire."&lt;ref name=IMER /&gt; In October 2005, ''Politiken'', another leading Danish newspaper, published its own poll of thirty-one of the forty-three members of the Danish cartoonist association. Twenty-three said they would be willing to draw Muhammad. One had doubts, one would not be willing because of fear of possible reprisals, and six artists would not be willing because they respected the Muslim ban on depicting Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Profetens ansigt: Ingen selvcensur blandt tegnere (''The prophet's face: No Self Censorship among illustrators'') |newspaper=Politiken |date=20 October 2005 |page=Section 2, page 3 |language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Description of the cartoons ===
{{Main|Descriptions of the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons}}

The 12 cartoons were drawn by 12 professional cartoonists in Denmark. Four of the cartoons have Danish texts, one deliberately evades the issue and depicts a school child in Denmark named Muhammad rather than the [[Prophets in Islam|Islamic prophet]], one is based on a Danish cultural expression, and one includes a Danish politician.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

=== Response ===

The immediate responses to the publication included newspaper sellers refusing to distribute that day's paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lHUIuy2Y5AQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Klausen,+Jytte+The+Cartoons&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=5bGHUq6oMIrNtAbj_oHQCg&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=September%2030%2C%202005&amp;f=false |title=The Cartoons That Shook the World |publisher= |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160624082203/https://books.google.com/books?id=lHUIuy2Y5AQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Klausen,+Jytte+The+Cartoons&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=5bGHUq6oMIrNtAbj_oHQCg&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=September%2030%2C%202005&amp;f=false |archivedate=24 June 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the following days, the cartoons received significant attention in other Danish press outlets. According to [[Jytte Klausen]], "most people groaned that the newspaper was at it again, bashing Muslims. The instinct was to split the blame."&lt;ref name="Klausen, 2009. p. 17"&gt;Klausen, 2009. p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Berlingske-Tidende'' criticised the 'gag', but also said that Islam should be openly criticised. ''Politiken'' attacked Rose's account of growing self-censorship; it also surveyed Danish cartoonists and said that self-censorship was not generally perceived as a problem.&lt;ref name="Klausen, 2009. p. 17" /&gt; On October 4, a local teenager telephoned the newspaper offices threatening to kill the cartoonists, but he was arrested after his mother turned him in.&lt;ref&gt;Klausen, 2009. p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after the publication, a group of Islamic leaders formed a protest group. [[Raed Hlayhel]] called a meeting to discuss their strategy, which took place in Copenhagen a few days after the cartoons appeared.&lt;ref name="Klausen, 2009. p. 86"&gt;Klausen, 2009. p. 86.&lt;/ref&gt; The Islamic Faith Community and four mosques from around the country were represented. The meeting established 19 "action points" to try to influence public opinion about the cartoons. [[Ahmed Akkari]] from an  mosque in Aarhus was designated the group's spokesman. The group planned a variety of political activities, including launching a legal complaint against the newspaper,  writing letters to media outlets inside and outside Denmark, contacting politicians and diplomatic representatives, organising a protest in Copenhagen, and mobilising Danish Muslims through text messages and mosques.&lt;ref name="Klausen, 2009. p. 86" /&gt; A one-day strike and sleep-in were planned, but never took place.&lt;ref name="Klausen, 2009. p. 86" /&gt; A peaceful protest, which attracted about 3,500 demonstrators, was held in Copenhagen on 14 October 2005.&lt;ref name=Klausen186&gt;Klausen, 2009. p. 186.&lt;/ref&gt;

Having received petitions from Danish imams, eleven ambassadors from Muslim-majority countries{{mdash}}Turkey, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Pakistan, Egypt, Indonesia, Algeria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Libya, Morocco{{mdash}}and the Head of the Palestinian General Delegation&lt;ref name=IMER /&gt; asked for a meeting with Danish Prime Minister [[Anders Fogh Rasmussen]] on 12 October 2005. They wanted to discuss what they perceived as an "on-going smearing campaign in Danish public circles and media against Islam and Muslims".&lt;ref&gt;Hervik, 2012, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter, the ambassadors mentioned the issue of the Muhammad cartoons, a recent indictment against [[Radio Holger]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Denmark targets extremist media |date=17 August 2005 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4159220.stm |publisher=[[BBC News]] |first=Thomas |last=Buch-Andersen |accessdate=16 September 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921055144/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4159220.stm |archivedate=21 September 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and statements by MP [[Louise Frevert]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ordene på Louise Freverts hjemmeside |date=30 September 2005 |language=Danish |url=http://nyhederne.tv2.dk/baggrund/article.php?id=2946997 |publisher=[[TV2 (Denmark)|TV2]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051211101846/http://nyhederne.tv2.dk/baggrund/article.php?id=2946997 |archivedate=11 December 2005 |accessdate=16 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Minister of Culture [[Brian Mikkelsen]].&lt;ref name=IMER /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Mikkelsen blæser til ny kulturkamp |date=25 September 2005 |url=http://nyhederne.tv2.dk/article.php?id=2923885 |publisher=TV2 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060215173141/http://nyhederne.tv2.dk/article.php?id=2923885 |archivedate=15 February 2006 |language=Danish |accessdate=16 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It concluded:

{{quote|We deplore these statements and publications and urge Your Excellency's government to take all those responsible to task under law of the land in the interest of inter-faith harmony, better integration and Denmark's overall relations with the Muslim world.|Letter from 11 ambassadors|&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Letter from 11 ambassadors |url=http://www.rogerbuch.dk/jpabrev.pdf |accessdate=10 December 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121013004346/http://www.rogerbuch.dk/jpabrev.pdf |archivedate=13 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

The government answered with a letter without addressing the request for a meeting: "The freedom of expression has a wide scope and the Danish government has no means of influencing the press. However, Danish legislation prohibits acts or expressions of blasphemous or discriminatory nature. The offended party may bring such acts or expressions to court, and it is for the courts to decide in individual cases."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gfx-master.tv2.dk/images/Nyhederne/Pdf/side3.pdf |title=Official response to ambassadors from A.F.Rasmussen |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060219083657/http://gfx-master.tv2.dk/images/Nyhederne/Pdf/side3.pdf |archivedate=19 February 2006 |accessdate=16 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The refusal to meet the ambassadors was later prominently criticised by the Danish political opposition, twenty-two Danish ex-ambassadors and the Prime Minister's fellow party member, former Minister of Foreign Affairs [[Uffe Ellemann-Jensen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Davidsen-Nielsen |first=Hans |title=Danske ambassadører leverer skarp kritik af Fogh |url=http://politiken.dk/indland/ECE132427/danske-ambassadoerer-leverer-skarp-kritik-af-fogh/ |accessdate=19 September 2013 |newspaper=Politiken |date=19 December 2005 |language=Danish |last2=Surrugue |first2=Stéphanie |last3=Parker Astrup |first3=Tanja |last4=Emborg |first4=Rasmus |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921055618/http://politiken.dk/indland/ECE132427/danske-ambassadoerer-leverer-skarp-kritik-af-fogh/ |archivedate=21 September 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hervik wrote, "While it is certainly true that the prime minister did not have a legal right to intervene in the editorial process, he could have publicly (as an enactment of free speech) dissociated himself from the publication, from the content of the cartoons, from Rose's explanatory text, from ''Jyllands-Posten'''s editorial of the same day, and from the general association of Islam with terrorism. Rasmussen did none of those. Instead, he used his interview [on 30 October 2005] to endorse ''Jyllands-Posten's'' position and the act of publishing the cartoons."&lt;ref&gt;Hervik, 2012. p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Organisation of Islamic Cooperation]] (OIC) and [[Arab League]] also wrote a joint letter to the Prime Minister expressing alarm about the cartoons and other recent incidents and insults committed by Danish politicians.&lt;ref name=Klausen186 /&gt; The Muslim countries continued to work diplomatically to try to have the issue{{mdash}}and the other issues mentioned in their initial letter{{mdash}}addressed by the Danish government.&lt;ref name=Diplomatic&gt;Klausen, 2009.

After trying to engage the Danish government diplomatically, Egyptian foreign minister [[Ahmed Aboul Gheit]] and the secretary-generals of the  OIC and the Arab League sent letters to the [[OSCE]], [[OECD]], and [[High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy|EU foreign policy coordinator]] complaining about Danish inaction.&lt;ref name="Klausen, 2009. p. 67" /&gt;

=== Judicial investigation of ''Jyllands-Posten'' (October 2005 – January 2006) ===
On 27 October 2005, representatives of the Muslim organisations which had complained about the cartoons in early October filed a complaint with the Danish police claiming that ''Jyllands-Posten'' had committed an offence under section 140 and 266b of the [[Danish Criminal Code]], precipitating an investigation by the public prosecutor.&lt;ref name="danish_response_to_un_jan"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.um.dk/NR/rdonlyres/00D9E6F7-32DC-4C5A-8E24-F0C96E813C06/0/060123final.pdf |title=Official Response by the Danish Government to the UN Special Rapporteurs |publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark |date=24 January 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060218054430/http://www.um.dk/NR/rdonlyres/00D9E6F7-32DC-4C5A-8E24-F0C96E813C06/0/060123final.pdf |archivedate=18 February 2006 |format=PDF |language=Danish |accessdate=22 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 January 2006, the Regional Public Prosecutor in Viborg discontinued the investigation as he found no basis for concluding that the cartoons constituted a criminal offence because the publication concerned a subject of public interest and Danish [[case law]] extends editorial freedom to journalists regarding subjects of public interest. He stated that in assessing what constitutes an offence, the right to freedom of speech must be taken into consideration, and said that freedom of speech must be exercised with the necessary respect for other human rights, including the right to protection against discrimination, insult and degradation.&lt;ref name="danish_response_to_un_jan" /&gt; In a new hearing resulting from a complaint about the original decision, the Director of Public Prosecutors in Denmark agreed with the previous ruling.&lt;ref name=rigsadvokat /&gt;

In December, after failing to make any progress with the Danish government or the newspaper, the "Committee for Prophet Honouring" decided to gain support and leverage outside of Denmark by meeting directly with religious and political leaders in the Middle East. They created a 43-page dossier (commonly known as the [[Akkari-Laban dossier]], after two leading imams ({{lang-ar|ملف عكّاري لبن}})) containing the cartoons and supporting materials for their meetings.&lt;ref name=clash&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/0,1518,398624,00.html |date=1 February 2006 |title=Alienated Danish Muslims Sought Help from Arabs |newspaper=Spiegel Online International |accessdate=6 December 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307221716/http://www.spiegel.de/international/0,1518,398624,00.html |archivedate=7 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Experts{{mdash}}including Helle Lykke Nielsen{{mdash}}who have examined the dossier said that it was broadly accurate from a technical point of view but contained a few falsehoods and could easily have misled people not familiar with Danish society, an assessment which the imams have since agreed to.&lt;ref name="HH80-84"&gt;Hansen &amp; Hundevadt, 80-84.&lt;/ref&gt; Some mistakes were that Islam is not officially recognised as a religion in Denmark (it is), that the cartoons are the result of a contest, and that Anders Fogh Rasmussen in his role as Prime Minister gave a medal to [[Ayaan Hirsi Ali]] (he gave one in his capacity as party leader of the Liberal Party). The imams also claimed to speak on behalf of 28 organisations, many of which later denied any connection to them.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen &amp; Hundevadt, 81.&lt;/ref&gt; Additions such as the "pig" photograph may have polarised the situation (the association of a person and a pig is considered very insulting in Islamic culture), as they were confused for the cartoons published in the newspaper.&lt;ref name=responsibilities /&gt; Muslims who met with the group later said Akkari's delegation had given them the impression that Danish Prime Minister Anders Fogh Rasmussen somehow controlled or owned ''Jyllands-Posten''.&lt;ref name=clash /&gt;

The OIC issued a condemnation of the cartoons: "[We express our] concern at rising hatred against Islam and Muslims and condemned the recent incident of desecration of the image of the Holy Prophet Mohamed."

The BBC said, "The cost to Danish businesses was around 134 million euros ($170m), when compared with the same period last year, the statistics showed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5329642.stm |title=Cartoons row hits Danish exports |publisher=BBC News |date=9 September 2006 |accessdate=9 September 2006 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061004180422/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5329642.stm |archivedate=4 October 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, ''[[The Guardian]]'' newspaper in the UK said, "While Danish milk products were dumped in the Middle East, fervent right-wing Americans started buying [[Bang &amp; Olufsen]] stereos and [[Lego]].

[[Naser Khader]], a Muslim Danish MP, founded an organisation called [[Democratic Muslims in Denmark]] in response to the controversy. He was worried that what he believed to be Islamists were seen to speak for all Muslims in Denmark. He said that there is still a sharp division within the Danish Muslim community between Islamists and moderates, and that Denmark had become a target for Islamists. He said that some good came from the crisis because "the cartoon crisis made clear that Muslims are not united and that there is a real difference between the Islamists and people like myself. Danes were shown that talk of 'the Muslims' was too monolithic." He also said that the crisis served as a wake-up call about radical Islam to European countries.&lt;ref name=Pipesinterview&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pipes |first=Daniel |title=Naser Khader and Flemming Rose: Reflections on the Danish Cartoon Controversy |journal=[[Middle East Quarterly]] |date=Fall 2007 |volume=XIV |issue=4 |pages=59–66 |url=http://www.meforum.org/1758/naser-khader-and-flemming-rose-reflections-on |accessdate=18 October 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120920205949/http://www.meforum.org/1758/naser-khader-and-flemming-rose-reflections-on |archivedate=20 September 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Still a practising Muslim, he said that printing the cartoons was ok and he personally apologised to the cartoonist Westergaard. Westergaard responded by saying "I met a man who has converted from being an Islamist to become a humanist who understands the values of our society. To me, he is really sincere, convincing and strong in his views." A spokesman for the Islamic Society of Denmark said "It is still not OK to publish drawings of Muhammad.

In February 2015, in the wake of the Charlie Hebdo shootings in Paris, a gunman opened fire on attendants and police officers at a meeting discussing freedom of speech with the Swedish cartoonist [[Lars Vilks]] among the panelists, and later attacked a synagogue killing two people in Copenhagen in the [[2015 Copenhagen shootings]].

Freedom of speech was guaranteed in law by the Danish Constitution of 1849, as it is today by The [[Constitution of Denmark|Constitutional Act of Denmark]] of 5 June 1953.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Jayasinghe |first=Anita May |title=The Constitutional Act of Denmark |url=http://www.thedanishparliament.dk/Democracy/The_Constitutional_Act_of_Denmark.aspx |publisher=Folketinget |accessdate=29 November 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121120170200/http://www.thedanishparliament.dk/Democracy/The_Constitutional_Act_of_Denmark.aspx |archivedate=20 November 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Danish freedom of expression is quite far-reaching{{mdash}}even by Western European standards{{mdash}}although it is subject to some legal restrictions dealing with libel, hate speech, blasphemy and defamation.&lt;ref name=mediadem&gt;{{cite book |title=Case Study Report: Does media policy promote media freedom and independence?

=== Islamic tradition ===

==== Aniconism ====
[[File:Mohammed kaaba 1315.jpg|160px|thumb|left|Muhammad rededicating the [[Kaaba]] [[Black Stone]]. Found in the [[Jami' al-tawarikh]] by [[Rashid-al-Din Hamadani|Rashid Al-Din]], at the [[University of Edinburgh]] library; [[Circa|c.]] 1315.]]
{{Main|Aniconism in Islam|Depictions of Muhammad}}

The [[Qur'an]] condemns idolatry, and this has led some Islamic scholars to interpret it as prohibiting figurative representation; this is known as [[aniconism]]. However, since Islam has many centres of religious authority, opinion and tradition about this is not uniform.&lt;ref name=Esposito&gt;{{cite book |last=Esposito |first=John L. |title=What Everyone Needs to Know about Islam |year=2011 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-979413-3 |pages=14–15 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xnN6wvw8zVQC&amp;pg=PA15#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160506193700/https://books.google.com/books?id=xnN6wvw8zVQC&amp;pg=PA15#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |archivedate=6 May 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In popular practice today there is no general injunction against pictorial representation of people outside of religious contexts.&lt;ref&gt;Klausen 2009. p.&amp;nbsp;139–140.&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, images of Muhammad have been prohibited throughout history. In practice, images of Muhammad have been made on many occasions, generally in a restricted and socially regulated way; for example, they are often stylised or do not show Muhammad's face.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Muhammad: A Very Short Introduction |year=2011 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=0-19-151027-0 |page=105 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9JafXLrLiwYC&amp;pg=PT105#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |last=Brown |first=Jonathan |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160502081332/https://books.google.com/books?id=9JafXLrLiwYC&amp;pg=PT105#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |archivedate=2 May 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Within Muslim communities, views about pictorial representations have varied: [[Shi'a Islam]] has been generally tolerant of pictorial representations of human figures while [[Sunni Islam]] generally forbids any pictorial representation of living beings, albeit with some variation in practice outside a religious context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Voices of Islam |year=2007 |publisher=Praeger Publishers |isbn=0-275-98732-9 |page=29 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RNTAHx95RqQC&amp;pg=PA29 |first=Titus |last=Burckhardt |editor=Vincent J.

==== Insulting Muhammad ====
In Muslim societies, insulting Muhammad is considered one of the gravest of all crimes. According to Ana Belen Soage of the [[University of Granada]], "The Islamic sharî'a has traditionally considered blasphemy punishable by death, although modern Muslim thinkers such as [[Mohammad Hashim Kamali]] maintain that, given that the Quran does not prescribe a punishment, determining a penalty is left to the judicial authorities of the day."&lt;ref name=Soage&gt;{{cite journal |last=Soage |first=Ana Belen |title=The Danish Caricatures Seen from the Arab World |journal=Totalitarian Movements and Political Religions |year=2006 |volume=7 |series=3 |pages=363–369 |doi=10.1080/14690760600819523 |issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the Quran itself, "God often instructs Muhammad to be patient to those who insult him and, according to historical records, no action was taken against them during his years in Mecca." &lt;ref name=Soage /&gt; Many Muslims said their anti-cartoon stance is against insulting pictures and not so much as against pictures in general. According to the BBC, "It is the satirical intent of the cartoonists and the association of the Prophet with terrorism, that is so offensive to the vast majority of Muslims."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Magdi |last=Abdelhadi |title=Cartoon row highlights deep divisions |date=4 February 2006 |publisher=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4678220.stm |accessdate=17 September 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131013075147/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4678220.stm |archivedate=13 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This link played into a widespread perception among Muslims across the world that many in the West are hostile towards Islam and Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Q&amp;A: Depicting the Prophet Muhammad |date=2 February 2006 |publisher=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4674864.stm |accessdate=17 September 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130916054629/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4674864.stm |archivedate=16 September 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Approximately 350,000 non-Western immigrants lived in Denmark in 2006, representing about 7% of the country's population.&lt;ref&gt;Hervik 2011, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; According to figures reported by the BBC,{{efn| 1 = Other sources show some variation on these figures.

See: [http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/country,,USDOS,,DNK,,4cf2d0a2c,0.html A report at the UNHCR website]}} about 270,000 of these were Muslim (ca. 5% of the population).&lt;ref name=bbcountryguide&gt;{{cite news |title=Muslims in Europe: Country guide |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4385768.stm |accessdate=13 November 2012 |publisher=BBC News |date=23 December 2005 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090929213440/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4385768.stm |archivedate=29 September 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 1970s Muslims arrived from Turkey, Pakistan, Morocco and Yugoslavia to work.

Peter Hervik said that the cartoon controversy must be seen in the context of an increasingly politicised media environment in Denmark since the 1990s, increasingly negative coverage of Islam and the Muslim minority in Denmark, anti-Muslim rhetoric from the governing political parties, and government policies such as restrictions on immigration and the abolishment of the Board for Ethnic Equality in 2002.&lt;ref name=Hervik&gt;{{cite book |last=Hervik |first=Peter |title=The Annoying Difference: The Emergence of Danish Neonationalism, Neoracism, and Populism in the Post-1989 World |year=2011 |publisher=Berghahn Books |isbn=978-0-85745-100-2 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=BivtnsLX5FgC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hervik said these themes are often ignored in international coverage of the issue and that they render conclusions that ''Jyllands-Posten'' and the Danish government were innocent victims in a dispute over freedom of speech inaccurate.&lt;ref name=Hervik /&gt; Against this background, Danish Muslims were particularly offended by the cartoons because they reinforced the idea that Danes stigmatize all Muslims as terrorists and do not respect their religious beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Müller |first=Marion G. |last2=Özcan |first2=Esra |title=The Political Iconography of Muhammad Cartoons: Understanding Cultural Conflict and Political Action |journal=PS: Political Science and Politics |date=April 2007 |volume=40 |series=2 |doi=10.1017/S104909650707045X |at=290}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heiko Henkel of British academic journal ''[[Radical Philosophy]]'' wrote: 

{{quote|the solicitation and publication of the ʻMuhammad cartoonsʼ was part of a long and carefully orchestrated campaign by the conservative ''Jyllands-Posten'' (also known in Denmark as Jyllands-Pesten – the plague from Jutland), in which it backed the centre-right Venstre party of Prime Minister Fogh Rasmussen in its successful bid for power in 2001.

Kiku Day, writing in the Guardian said, "We were a liberal and tolerant people until the 1990s, when we suddenly awoke to find that for the first time in our history we had a significant minority group living among us.

Danish Muslim politician Naser Khader said, "Muslims are no more discriminated against in Denmark than they are elsewhere in Europe&amp;nbsp;... Generally, Danes give you a fair shake. They accept Muslims if you declare that you are loyal to this society, to democracy. If you say that you are one of them, they will accept you. If you have reservations, they will worry."&lt;ref name=Pipesinterview /&gt; His concern has centred on the power of "Islamism" or fundamentalist political Islam in Denmark's Muslim community which he has tried to fight, especially in the wake of the controversy by forming an association of democratic, moderate Muslims.&lt;ref name=Pipesinterview /&gt;

==== Relationship between the West and Muslims ====
{{Main|Islam in Europe|Multiculturalism}}

The incident occurred at a time of unusually strained relations between the Muslim world and the West. This was a result of decades of Muslim immigration to Europe, recent political struggles, violent incidents such as September 11 and a string of Islamist terrorist attacks and Western interventions in Muslim countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Cowell |first=Alan |title=West Beginning to See Islamic Protests as Sign of Deep Gulf |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/08/international/europe/08islam.html?ref=danishcartooncontroversy&amp;pagewanted=all |accessdate=21 March 2013 |newspaper=The New York Times |date=8 February 2006 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150107223659/http://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/08/international/europe/08islam.html?ref=danishcartooncontroversy&amp;pagewanted=all |archivedate=7 January 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The cartoons were used as a tool by different political interests in a wide variety of local and international situations. Some debate surrounded the relationship between Islamic minorities and their broader societies, and the legal and moral limits that the press should observe when commenting on that minority or any religious minority group.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

===== Cartoons as a political tool in the West =====

Some commentators see the publications of the cartoons as part of a deliberate effort to show Muslims and Islam in a bad light, thus influencing public opinion in the West in aid of various political projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=23 March 2006 |title=Islam and globanalisation |newspaper=Al-Ahram |url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2006/787/cu4.htm |last=Dabashi |first=Hamid |accessdate=17 September 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130625133913/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2006/787/cu4.htm |archivedate=25 June 2013 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalist Andrew Mueller wrote, "I am concerned that the ridiculous, disproportionate reaction to some unfunny sketches in an obscure Scandinavian newspaper may confirm that&amp;nbsp;...

{{quote|the critique of 'Muslim fundamentalism' has become a cornerstone in the definition of European identities. As well as replacing anti-communism as the rallying point for a broad 'democratic consensus' (and, in this shift, remaking this consensus), the critique of Islamic fundamentalism has also become a conduit for imagining Europe as a moral community beyond the nation. It has emerged as a banner under which the most diverse sectors of society can unite in the name of 'European' values.}}

===== Use by Islamists and Middle-Eastern governments =====

===== Racism and ignorance =====

One controversy that arose around the cartoons was the question of whether they were racist.&lt;ref name="Modood Hansen Bleich OLeary 2006 pp. 7–16"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Modood |first=Tariq |last2=Hansen |first2=Randall |last3=Bleich |first3=Erik |last4=O'Leary |first4=Brendan |last5=Carens |first5=Joseph H. |title=The Danish Cartoon Affair: Free Speech, Racism, Islamism, and Integration |at=The Danish Cartoon Controversy: A Defence of Liberal Freedom |journal=International Migration |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |volume=44 |issue=5 |year=2006 |issn=0020-7985 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-2435.2006.00386.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]] (UNCHR) [[United Nations Special Rapporteur|Special Rapporteur]] "on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance", [[Doudou Diène]], saw xenophobia and racism in Europe as the root of the controversy, and partly criticised the government of Denmark for inaction after the publication of the cartoons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=13 February 2006 |title=Report of the Special Rapporteur on contemporary forms of racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance on the situation of Muslim and Arab peoples in various parts of the world (E/CN.4/2006/17) |first=Doudou |last=Diène |publisher=UNCHR |url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/chr/sessions/62/listdocs.htm |quote=Politically and from the standpoint of the morality of international relations, the Danish Government, against the backdrop of an alarming resurgence of defamation of religions, especially Islamophobia but also anti-Semitism and Christianophobia, failed to show the commitment and vigilance that it normally displays in combating religious intolerance and incitement to religious hatred and promoting religious harmony. |accessdate=18 September 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927190308/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/bodies/chr/sessions/62/listdocs.htm |archivedate=27 September 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Aurel Sari has since said that the special rapporteur's interpretation was wrong and that "neither the decision to commission images depicting the Prophet in defiance of Islamic tradition, nor the actual content of the individual cartoons can be regarded as racist within the meaning of the relevant international human rights instruments" although "some of the more controversial pictures may nevertheless be judged 'gratuitously offensive' to the religious beliefs of Muslims in accordance with the applicable case-law of the European Court of Human Rights."

Many Muslims saw the cartoons as a sign of lack of education about Islam in Denmark and in the West. Egyptian preacher and television star [[Amr Khaled]] urged his followers to take action to remedy supposed Western ignorance, saying, "It is our duty to the prophet of God to make his message known&amp;nbsp;...

He supported calls for a UN resolution that "categorically prohibits affronts to prophets{{mdash}}to the prophets of the Lord and His messengers, to His holy books, and to the religious holy places". He also castigated governments around the world for inaction on the issue, saying, "Your silence over such crimes, which offend the Prophet of Islam and insult his great nation, is what begets violence, generates terrorism, and makes the terrorists say: Our governments are doing nothing, and we must avenge our Prophet ourselves. This is what creates terrorism and begets violence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Special Dispatch No.1089: Sheikh Al-Qaradhawi Responds to Cartoons of Prophet Muhammad: Whoever is Angered and Does Not Rage in Anger is a Jackass – We are Not a Nation of Jackasses |url=http://www.memri.org/report/en/0/0/0/0/0/0/1604.htm |work=Jihad &amp; Terrorism Studies Project |publisher=[[MEMRI]] |accessdate=16 November 2012 |date=9 February 2006 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130109150258/http://www.memri.org/report/en/0/0/0/0/0/0/1604.htm |archivedate=9 January 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===== Relationship between the Liberal West and Islam =====

[[Francis Fukuyama]] wrote in the online magazine ''Slate'' that "while beginning with a commendable European desire to assert basic liberal values," the controversy was an alarming sign of the degree of cultural conflict between Muslim immigrant communities in Europe and their broader populations, and advocated a measured and prudent response to the situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=27 February 2006 |last=Fukuyama |first=Francis |title=Europe vs. Radical Islam |newspaper=Slate |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2136964/ |accessdate=17 September 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110907121835/http://www.slate.com/id/2136964/ |archivedate=7 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Helle Rytkonen wrote in ''Danish Foreign Policy Yearbook 2007'' that most of the debate around the cartoon controversy was over-simplified as a simple matter of free speech against religion. She said that the actual dispute was more nuanced, focusing on the tone of the debate and broader context of Western-Islamic relations.&lt;ref&gt;Rytkonen 2007, 106.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christopher Hitchens]] wrote in ''Slate'' that official reaction in the West{{mdash}}particularly the United States{{mdash}}was too lenient toward the protesters and Muslim community in Denmark, and insufficiently supportive of Denmark and the right to free speech. He said, "nobody in authority can be found to state the obvious and the necessary—that we stand with the Danes against this defamation and blackmail and sabotage. Instead, all compassion and concern is apparently to be expended upon those who lit the powder trail, and who yell and scream for joy as the embassies of democracies are put to the torch in the capital cities of miserable, fly-blown dictatorships. Let's be sure we haven't hurt the vandals' ''feelings''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Hitchens |first=Christopher |title=Stand up for Denmark! |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/fighting_words/2006/02/stand_up_for_denmark.html |work=Slate |date=21 February 2006 |accessdate=3 October 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120925164659/http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/fighting_words/2006/02/stand_up_for_denmark.html |archivedate=25 September 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Kristol]] also wrote that the response of Western leaders, with the exception of the Danish Prime Minister, was too weak and that the issue was used as an excuse by "those who are threatened by our effort to help liberalize and civilize the Middle East" to fight back against the "assault" on radical Islamists and Middle Eastern dictatorships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kristol |first=William |title=Oh, the Anguish!

Flemming Rose said he did not expect a violent reaction, and talked about what the incident implies about the relationship between the West and the Muslim world. He said, 

{{quote|I spoke to [historian of Islam] Bernard Lewis about this, and he said that the big difference between our case and the Rushdie affair is that Rushdie is perceived as an apostate by the Muslims while, in our case, Muslims were insisting on applying Islamic law to what non-Muslims are doing in non-Muslim countries. In that sense, he said it is a kind of unique case that might indicate that Europe is perceived as some kind of intermediate state between the Muslim world and the non-Muslim world.&lt;ref name=Pipesinterview /&gt;}}

==== Freedom of speech, political correctness and self-censorship ====

One of the principal lines of controversy surrounding the cartoons concerned the limits of free speech,&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Mohammed Saif-Alden Wattad, [http://www.nujslawreview.org/pdf/articles/2010_2/dr-mohammed-saif-alden-wattad.pdf "ISLAM, TERRORISM AND MODERN LIBERAL SOCIETIES"]{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=Sam Sailor |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''NUJS LAW REVIEW'', January 2, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; how much it should be legally or ethically constrained and whether the cartoons were an appropriate expression for a newspaper to print. The cartoons were first printed in response to the perception of some journalists at the newspaper that self-censorship was becoming a problem; the ensuing reaction did nothing to dispel that idea. Rose said: 

{{Quote|When I wrote the accompanying text to the publication of the cartoons, I said that this act was about self-censorship, not free speech. Free speech is on the books; we have the law, and nobody as yet has thought of rewriting it. This changed when the death threats were issued; it became an issue of the Sharia trumping the fundamental right of free speech.&lt;ref name=Pipesinterview /&gt;}} 

Rose also highlighted what he believed to be a difference between political correctness and self-censorship{{mdash}}which he considered more dangerous. He said: 

{{Quote|There is a very important distinction to be made here between what you perceive as good behavior and a fear keeping you from doing things that you want to do&amp;nbsp;... A good example of this was the illustrator who refused to illustrate a children's book about the life of Mohammed. He is on the record in two interviews saying that he insisted on anonymity because he was afraid.&lt;ref name=Pipesinterview /&gt;}}

Christopher Hitchens wrote that it is important to affirm "the right to criticize not merely Islam but religion in general".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hitchens |first=Christopher |title=Cartoon Debate: The Case for Mocking Religion |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/fighting_words/2006/02/cartoon_debate.html |accessdate=4 October 2012 |newspaper=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |date=4 February 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121010093541/http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/fighting_words/2006/02/cartoon_debate.html |archivedate=10 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He criticised media outlets which did not print the cartoons while covering the story. [[Ralf Dahrendorf]] wrote that the violent reaction to the cartoons constituted a sort of [[counter-enlightenment]] which must be defended against.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Dahrendorf |first=Ralf |title=Today's Counter-Enlightenment |url=http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/today-s-counter-enlightenment |publisher=[[Project Syndicate]] |accessdate=14 November 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121021074101/http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/today-s-counter-enlightenment |archivedate=21 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sonia Mikich]] wrote in ''[[Die Tageszeitung]]'', "I hereby refuse to feel badly for the chronically insulted. I refuse to argue politely why freedom of expression, reason and humour should be respected". She said that those things are part of a healthy society and that deeply held feelings or beliefs should not be exempt from commentary, and that those offended had the option of ignoring them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Mikich |first=Sonia |title=What next, bearded one?

Ashwani K. Peetush of Wilfrid Laurier University wrote that in a liberal democracy freedom of speech is not absolute, and that reasonable limits are put on it such as libel, defamation and hate speech laws in almost every society to protect individuals from "devastating and direct harm". He said that the cartoons "create a social environment of conflict and intimidation for a community that already feels that its way of life is threatened. I do not see how such tactics incorporate people into the wider public and democratic sphere, as Rose argues. They have the opposite effect: the marginalised feel further marginalised and powerless." He said that it is reasonable to consider two of the cartoons as hate speech, which directly undermine a group of people (Muslims) by forming part of an established discourse linking all Muslims with terrorism and barbarity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Peetush |first=Ashwani K. |title=Caricaturizing Freedom: Islam, Offence, and The Danish Cartoon Controversy |journal=Studies in South Asian Film and Media |date=May 2009 |volume=1 |issue=1 |pages=173–188 |url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/intellect/safm/2009/00000001/00000001/art00010 |accessdate=15 November 2012 |doi=10.1386/safm.1.1.173_1 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141001221527/http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/intellect/safm/2009/00000001/00000001/art00010 |archivedate=1 October 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In France, satirical magazine ''[[Charlie Hebdo]]'' was taken to court for publishing the cartoons; it was acquitted of charges that it incited hatred.&lt;ref name="Leveque" /&gt;  In Canada a human rights commission investigated ''[[The Western Standard]]'', a magazine which published the cartoons, but found insufficient grounds to proceed with a human rights tribunal (which does not imply criminal charges, but is a quasi-judicial, mandatory process) against the publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Danish cartoon complaint rejected |url=http://www.canada.com/story_print.html?id=bab36f55-6aec-43c6-a458-a49f262fbbb6&amp;sponsor= |accessdate=10 June 2013 |newspaper=National Post |date=7 August 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160324103700/http://www.canada.com/story_print.html?id=bab36f55-6aec-43c6-a458-a49f262fbbb6&amp;sponsor= |archivedate=24 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; These government investigations of journalists catalysed debate about the role of government in censoring or prosecuting expressions they deemed potentially hateful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kahn |first=Robert |title=Tragedy, Farce or Legal Mobilization?

'''Lexicostatistics''' is a method of [[comparative linguistics]] that involves comparing the percentage of lexical [[cognates]] between languages to determine their relationship. Lexicostatistics is related to the [[comparative method]] but does not reconstruct a [[proto-language]]. It is to be distinguished from [[glottochronology]], which attempts to use lexicostatistical methods to estimate the length of time since two or more languages diverged from a common earlier proto-language. This is merely one application of lexicostatistics, however; other applications of it may not share the assumption of a constant rate of change for basic lexical items.

The term "lexicostatistics" is misleading in that mathematical equations are used but not statistics. Other features of a language may be used other than the lexicon, though this is unusual. Whereas the comparative method used shared identified innovations to determine sub-groups, lexicostatistics does not identify these. Lexicostatistics is a distance-based method, whereas the comparative method considers language characters directly. The lexicostatistics method is a simple and fast technique relative to the comparative method but has limitations (discussed below). It can be validated by cross-checking the trees produced by both methods.

==History==
Lexicostatistics was developed by [[Morris Swadesh]] in a series of articles in the 1950s, based on earlier ideas. The concept's first known use was by [[Dumont d'Urville]] in 1834 who compared various "Oceanic" languages and proposed a method for calculating a coefficient of relationship. Hymes (1960) and Embleton (1986) both review the history of lexicostatistics.

==Method==

===Create word list===
The aim is to generate a list of universally used meanings (hand, mouth, sky, I). Words are then collected for these meaning slots for each language being considered. Swadesh reduced a larger set of meanings down to 200 originally. He later found that it was necessary to reduce it further but that he could include some meanings that were not in his original list, giving his later 100-item list. The [[Swadesh list]] in Wiktionary gives the total 207 meanings in a number of languages. Alternative lists that apply more rigorous criteria have been generated, e.g. the [[Dolgopolsky list]] and the [[Leipzig–Jakarta list]], as well as lists with a more specific scope; for example, Dyen, Kruskal and Black have 200 meanings for 84 [[Indo-European languages]] in digital form.

===Determine cognacies===
A trained and experienced linguist is needed to make cognacy decisions. However, the decisions may need to be refined as the state of knowledge increases. However, lexicostatistics does not rely on all the decisions being correct. For each pair of lists the cognacy of a form could be positive, negative or indeterminate. Sometimes a language has multiple words for one meaning, e.g. ''small'' and ''little'' for ''not big''.

===Calculate lexicostatistic percentages===
This percentage is related to the proportion of meanings for a particular language pair that are cognate, i.e. relative to the total without indeterminacy. This value is entered into a [[distance matrix|N x N table of distances]], where N is the number of languages being compared. When complete this table is half-filled in [[triangular matrix|triangular]] form. The higher the proportion of cognacy the closer the languages are related.

===Create family tree===
Creation of the language tree is based solely on the table found above. Various sub-grouping methods can be used but that adopted by Dyen, Krustal and Black was:
* all lists are placed in a pool
* the two closest members are removed and form a nucleus which is placed in the pool
* this step is repeated
* under certain conditions a nucleus becomes a group
* this is repeated until the pool only contains one group.

Calculations have to be of nucleus and group lexical percentages.

==Applications==
A leading exponent of lexicostatistics application has been [[Isidore Dyen]]. He used lexicostatistics to classify [[Austronesian languages]] as well as [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] ones. A major study of the latter was reported by Dyen, Kruskal and Black (1992). Studies have also been carried out of [[Amerindian]] and [[African languages]].

==Criticisms==
People such as Hoijer (1956) have showed that there were difficulties in finding equivalents to the meaning items while many have found it necessary to modify Swadesh's lists. Gudschinsky (1956) questioned whether it was possible to obtain a universal list.

Factors such as [[loanword|borrowing]], tradition and [[taboo]] can skew the results, as with other methods. Sometimes lexicostatistics has been used with [[lexical similarity]] being used rather than cognacy to find resemblances. This is then equivalent to [[mass comparison]].

The choice of meaning slots is subjective, as is the choice of [[synonym]]s.

==Improved methods==
Some of the modern computational statistical hypothesis testing methods can be regarded as improvements of lexicostatistics in that they use similar word lists and distance measures.

== [http://www.printedweb.org ''Printed Web''] (publication) ==
''Printed Web'' is an artists' publication devoted to web-to-print art and discourse, published by Paul Soulellis / Library of the Printed Web. The project began in 2014 as a way to present new work by artists included in Soulellis’ Library of the Printed Web. Artists are invited to submit new or existing network-based work for the printed page. In the spirit of Seth Siegelaub, each issue is curated as a group exhibition for the printed page. Printed Web circulates primarily as print-on-demand publications, but also includes PDFs, ZIPs, GIFs, and server directories.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1704">The '''music of [[Palau]]''' finds its heritage in Micronesia, but it has been supplemented with influences from the [[United States]] and [[Western Europe]], as well as [[Japan]].

The government department of the Republic of Palau and Director of the [[Bureau of Arts and Culture]] are in charge of developing and implementing cultural policies is the [[Ministry of Community and Cultural Affairs]].
The [[national anthem]] of Palau is a song written by [[Ymesei O. Ezekiel]], and has been the anthem since 1980.

There are no [[intellectual property]] restrictions in Palau.

The modern Palauan [[pop music]] scene began in the mid-1980s [http://www.pacificworlds.com/palau/memories/chronol.cfm].  The country recorded popular sound includes element of [[music of Japan|Japanese music]], legacy of a period of Japanese domination [https://web.archive.org/web/20050319004239/http://www.okara.com/violeta_hughes-davis/html/palau.html].  The American influence can be heard in a distinctly Palauan form of [[country music]].  Popular performers include [[IN-X-ES]], whose "Mousubes" was a major commercial success in 1999.

{{refimprove|date=June 2017}}
Philippine folklore, unlike [[Greek mythology|Greek]], [[Norse mythology|Norse]] or [[Egyptian Mythology|Egyptian]] [[mythology|mythologies]], has not been organized into a formal pantheon, has not been relegated to history, nor does not generally contain long [[epic poetry|epics]], though epics have been recorded, many of which are only partly recorded as majority have been abolished, slimmed, or altered under Spanish colonial rule. To this day, Philippine [[myths]] still have an active role in the lives of rural Filipinos. The countless myths circulating throughout the Filipino countryside contain a large variety of '''mythical creatures'''. Although there is no scientific evidence for any of these creatures, there is also no shortage in the rural parts of the Philippines of people who believe firmly in their existence. This discrepancy is sometimes rationalized by the explanation that only pure and good mortals are able to see these creatures. Although there is no scientific evidence that this creatures exist some people still believe that they are still alive up to this day especially in rural area. Very few of the following mythical creatures are 'national' in coverage, as usually, mythical creatures are endemic to the belief of specific ethnic groups in the Philippines. An example is the ''amahanlig'', which is only believed by the people of Western Visayas, while the ''malakat'' is endemic to Waray areas in Eastern Visayas. Other examples of ethnic-inclusiveness of mythical creatures in the Philippines is the ''ragit-ragit'' which is believed to live only in the islands of Romblon, while ''sarangay'' is only believed to thrive in Ibanag lands. Due to modern influences, some mythical creatures that were originally ethnically-endemic are now believed by other ethnic groups as well. An example is the ''tiyanak'' which used to be believed by the Tagalog people only. Today, majority of Filipinos know what a ''tiyanak'' is, and therefore, its influence is national in scale.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.aswangproject.com/creatures-mythical-beings-philippine-folklore-mythology/&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Aswang''==
{{main|Aswang}}
[[File:Aswang, common form.jpg|thumb|170px|right|A sketch of an ''aswang''.]]
'''Aswang''' are shapeshifters, that are human-like by day, but, transform into different monstrous forms to harass and eat awake humans at night or day, especially pregnant women who are about to give birth.&lt;ref name="TE"&gt;"Tagalog-English Dictionary by Leo James English, Congregation of the Most Holy Redeemer, Manila, distributed by National Book Store, 1583 pages, {{ISBN|971-91055-0-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Aswang'' can change from a human to an animal form, usually as a big black bird with a long tongue (''tiktik''), as a half-bodied monster (''manananggal'') as a bat, a cat, a pig or a black dog. Some ''aswang'' can change form at will, others through the use of foul oils concocted by good magicians (''albularyo'', ''manggagaway'', ''[[manghihilot]]''). ''Aswang'' appear at night (rarely during the day) to prey upon unwary travelers or sleeping people. It is said that they have a peculiar liking for the taste of human liver. The myth of the ''aswang'' is popular in the Visayas, especially in provinces such as Aklan, Capiz, Antique, and Ilo-Ilo.  ''Aswang'' (mostly, ''tiktik'') also have a peculiar liking for the fetus of pregnant women and are said to find their quarry by the scent of the mother, which to the aswang smells like ripe jackfruit. Upon finding the house of the pregnant mother, the ''tiktik'' alights on the roof from where it stretches its tongue until it is as thin as a thread and uses it to enter the womb and feast on the fetus. The only way for a person to prevent this creature is to put one's brooms upside down, to put a "badiawan twig" all over his/her house's windows, or to put a blessed or a magic dagger in any parts of the house.

==''Bakunawa''==
{{main|Bakunawa}}

'''Bakunawa''' is a serpentine in Philippine mythology that is often represented as a gigantic sea serpent. It is believed to be the cause of eclipses. It is believed that he or she was just turned into a dragon as punishment. Bakunawa was a beautiful ''[[diwata]]'' in the sea; some say she was a [[Nāga|''naga'']], and was the most powerful. One night, she saw the seven moons and was captivated by their beauty and longed to possess them.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aswangproject.com/bakunawa/#ts-fab-bio-below Clark, J. (2016, May 27). Bakunawa: the moon eating dragon of Philippine mythology. Retrieved from: https://www.aswangproject.com/bakunawa/#ts-fab-bio-below]&lt;/ref&gt; One of the embodiment of the moon descended to the sea to swim with the mermaids. It was Bulan, the adolescent aspect of the moon. The boy moon did not notice Bakunawa. Thinking the boy had ignored her beauty to play with the mermaids enraged her. The following night, she transformed herself into a dragon and devoured the moons. When she had swallowed the last moon, Bathala intervened, so she spit out the moon...

==''Bathala''==
{{main|Bathala}}
[[File:BathalaDiwataPhilippinemythology.jpg|170px|thumb|right|''Bathala'' (top), a ''[[diwata]]'' (bottom), and the ''[[Sarimanok]]'' (center).]]
'''Bathala''', ''[[God (male deity)|Diyos]]'' or ''[[Bathala|Apo]]'' it is the creation god in Tagalog myths.&lt;ref name="TE"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bambooman/&gt;&lt;ref name=Apo&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/gcalla1/apo.htm&amp;date=2009-10-25+22:30:47 Giovanni, R.C.

==''Berberoka''==
{{main|Berberoka}}
'''Berberoka''' ensnares its victims by drinking enough water in the pond until a number of fish appear into the surface. When the potential victims get attracted to the school of fish, the ''berberoka'' drowns them by hosing water and swallowing them afterwards.

==''Bungisngis''==
{{main|Bungisngis}}
'''Bungisngis''' is a one-eyed giant. This Philippine folklore giant lives in forest and woods. It is a happy and a playful cyclops, and is also commonly known as 'Mahentoy' in the northern part of Davao.

==''Diwata''==
{{main|Diwata}}
''Diwata'' (from Sanskrit '''devada''', "''gods''"), ''[[diwata|engkantada]]'' (from Spanish: '''encantada''', "''enchantress, charmed''") or [[engkanto]] (from Spanish: '''encanto''', ''"spell, incantation, charm"'') are lesser gods and goddesses. Some are [[dryads]] who guard natural creations such as forests, seas, mountains, land and air.&lt;ref name="TE"/&gt;  

''Diwatas'' are described as fair-skinned, good-looking, and sometimes, blonde-haired.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Creatures of Philippine Lower Mythology|last=Ramos|first=Maximo|publisher=University of the Philippines Press|year=1971|isbn=|location=Philippines|pages=54}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are said to reside in large trees, such as [[acacia]] and [[balete tree|balete]]. They tend to be resentful of humanity's intrusion into their realm.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; They also bring blessings or curses upon those who do good or harm to the forests and mountains. One famous ''diwata'' is [[Maria Makiling]], guardian of [[Mount Makiling]] in [[Laguna (province)|Laguna]] province.  ''Engkanto'' (sometimes spelled ''Encanto'') is an umbrella term for most supernatural beings.  The common connotation is that they are fairies who reside primarily in the forests and the sea. They can also be called ''encantado'' (male) or ''encantada'' (female).

==''Duwende''==
{{main|Duende (mythology)}}

'''Duwende''' are [[goblins]], [[hobgoblins]], [[elves]] or [[dwarf (mythology)|dwarfs]] (''[[Spanish language|Spanish]]'': ''[[Duende (mythology)|duende]]'' "''goblin, elf, charm''" &lt; "''duen de (casa)''", ''owner of the house'').  They are little creatures who can provide good fortune or bad fate to people.&lt;ref name="TE"/&gt;  In the pre-colonial Philippines they were called mangalo and were believed to cause the death of children by eating their bowels. Also in pre-colonial Philippines, mainly Visayas, people believed that this race of creatures served and raised the goddess Burigadang Pada Sinaklang Bulawan. In modern-day beliefs ''duwende'' frequently live in houses, in trees, underground, termite like mound or hill, and in rural areas. They are known to be either good or mischievous, depending on how homeowners treat them. They usually come out at 12 noon for an hour and during the night.  Filipinos always mutter words ("tabi-tabi po" or "bari-bari apo ma ka ilabas kami apo") asking them to excuse themselves for bothering the Duwendes. Filipinos would leave food on the floor, so that the ''duwende'' residing (or guarding) the house would not be angry with them. They also take a person's things, and laugh at him/her when you try to find it. They give it back when they feel like it, or when one tells them to please give it.

==''Tiktik''==

''[[Tiktik]]'' is a creature with a form of  bird-like human. It is similar to "wakwak" in the common Filipino term. Both are winged-humans who at night search for victims. They hunger for flesh and blood especially to those of fetuses. ''Tiktik'' look like [[Harpy|harpies]], and both creatures are named after the sounds they create. According to stories, one cannot hear the ''tiktik'' and the ''aswang'' when they are very near. On the contrary, one will hear loud noises whenever they are far.

==''Engkanto''==
A male diwata is coined as '''engkanto''', but they are a totally different race. They are believed to be malevolent and physically attractive, having light colored hair and fangs. It resides primarily near the sea or any body of water. It is customary for Filipino fishermen to offer meat and other delicacies to the enkanto by throwing them into the sea, after a day's bountiful catch.

==''Garuda''==
{{main|Garuda}}

'''Garuda''' is a large bird-like creature, or humanoid bird 
muscular upper body of a man but the face and large wings of the great eagle who is believed to eat men

==''Kapre''==
{{main|Kapre}}
[[File:Kapre of Philippine Folklore Commons.jpg|thumb|150px|right|A depiction of ''kapre'' scaring away a lass from atop his tree dwelling, and with a lit tobacco placed in his mouth.]]
'''Kapre''' is a filthy [[Giant (mythology)|giant]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Clark|first=Jordan|url=https://www.aswangproject.com/origin-kapre/|title=Origin of the Kapre, the cigar smoking giant from the Philippines|publisher=The Aswang Project|access-date=19 Dec 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; who likes to smoke huge rolls of cigars, and hide within, and atop large trees, particularly the [[Banyan|balete]] and old acacia or mango trees. A Filipino [[bigfoot]], it scares away little children who play at night.&lt;ref name=Kapre&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080729223038/http://www.geocities.com/gcalla1/kapre.htm The Kapre, Ancient Mythology, Children of the Pearl, Geocities.com (undated)], retrieved on August 5, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; If one is stuck in a place and keeps going around in circles, one is said to be played around with by a ''kapre''. To escape its control, one must remove his/her shirt/clothing, and wear it inside-out.

==''Kinara''==
In the pre-colonial Philippines, the Kinnara or Kinnari are symbolic of androgynous beauty and of a lover's devotion, ethereal beauty, and one's undying devotion towards a lover. Pre-colonial gold pieces have been found depicting such otherworldly beauty. The Kinnara is described as gentle, loyal, and subservient creatures. They are depicted as having a beautiful face, the upper body of a slender woman or boy with wings. Alternately, a kinnara can transform its hands and limbs into feathered wings for flight and the lower body of a bird description varies. Kinnaras are skilled dancers and musicians, performing solely for their lover.
The golden vessel kinnari was found in 1981 in Surigao. The kinnari exists in both Buddhist and Hindu mythology. In Buddhism, the kinnari, a half-human, and half-bird creature represent enlightened action. The Buddhist Lotus Sutra mentions the kinnari as the celestial musician in the Himavanta realm. The kinnari takes the form of a centaur, however, in India's epic poem, the Mahabharata, and in the Veda's Purana part.

==''Naga''==

'''Naga''''s other names are ''marindaga'', ''marinaga'', and ''maginaga''. They are a type of fresh water mermaids, but instead of having fish tails they have eels and/or water snakes for tails and the upper body of a human female having alluring face, curvaceous body and long flowing hair.

Vicious to adults but gentle to children are considered the protectors of springs, wells and rivers. They bring rain, and thus fertility, but are also thought to bring disasters such as floods and drought.

Nagas are snake-like mermaids that may take human form. They tend to be very curious. According to traditions nāgas are only malevolent to humans when they have been mistreated. They are susceptible to mankind's disrespectful actions in relation to the environment. They are also associated with waters—rivers, lakes, seas, and wells—and are generally regarded as guardians of treasure.

In other beliefs the most powerful of the Nagas became a goddess named [[Bakunawa]]. She is captivated by the beauty of the seven moons and turned herself into a giant dragon-serpent in order to reach them, but the deity [[Bathala]] punished her so she remained in her dragon state for all eternity.

==''Malakas'' and ''Maganda''==
[[File:Malakas and Maganda Emerging from Bamboo BambooMan.jpg|thumb|right|210px|''Malakas'' and ''Maganda''.]]
''[[Philippine mythology#Creation myths|Malakas and Maganda]]'' (literally, ''Strong One'' and ''Beautiful One'') are Filipino versions of [[Adam and Eve]].  They are said to have sprung from a large bamboo tree pecked by a [[#Sarimanok|''sarimanok'']] known as Magaulancealabarca.&lt;ref name=Bambooman&gt;[http://www.bambooman.com/malakas_at_maganda.php Malakas at Maganda Legend, Bambooman.com, 2006], retrieved on August 5, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MalMag&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071212183029/http://www.geocities.com/gcalla1/malakas.htm The Tale of Malakas and Maganda, Ancient Mythology, Children of the Pearl, Geocities.com (undated)], retrieved on August 5, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MalandMag&gt;[http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=1419780 Story of Malakas and Maganda, Everything2.com], retrieved on: August 5, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Magindara''==

The '''Magindara''' are fierce water creatures with the upper body of attractive women and the lower body of multicolored fishes. They lure men to drown them. It is believed that the lunar deity Bulan the boy moon descended and tamed the vicious creatures, turning them into friendly Mermaids.

==''Mambabarang''==
{{main|Barang (Visayan word)}}

''[[Conjuror|Mambabarang]]'' (summoner) is a [[witch]] who uses insects and spirits to enter the body of any person they hate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|url=https://aboutphilippines.ph/files/Mambabarang-and-Mangkukulam.pdf|title=Mambabarang and Mangkukulam|format=pdf|access-date=20 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A ''mambabarang'' is a kind of a ''mangkukulam''. ''Mambabarang'' are ordinary human beings with black magic who torture and later kill their victims by infesting their bodies with insects. They are different from ''mangkukulams'' - the latter only inflict pain or illness. ''Mambabarang'' use a strand of hair from their chosen victim and tie it to the bugs or worms which they will use as a medium. When they prick the bug, the victim immediately experiences the intended effect.

==''Manananggal''==
{{main|Manananggal}}
[[File:Manananggal.jpg|thumb|right|An illustrated depiction of a ''Manananggal''.]]
'''Manananggal''' is an ''aswang'' that can fly after separating itself from the lower half of its body. It eats babies and fetuses from a mother's womb by means of passing their long tongue through a small hole from the roof of a house. The sharp end of the tongue touches the mother's navel to suck the blood of the fetus or unborn child.&lt;ref name=Manang&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071109174435/http://www.geocities.com/gcalla1/manananggal.htm The Manananggal, Ancient Mythology, Children of the Pearl, Geocities.com (undated)], retrieved on August 5, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; This creature's name was derived from the Filipino word, ''tanggal'', which means "to separate" because of the manananggal's ability to separate itself from its lower body.&lt;ref name="TE"/&gt;

A ''manananggal'' can also be a sorceress that visits villages and barrios. To feed, the self-segmenter chooses an isolated place where she will leave her lower torso while she hunts at night. When she separates from her lower torso, she then gains her ability to fly. She then goes off in search of houses where pregnant women reside. Upon choosing a suitable victim, the ''manananggal'' alights on the house and inserts her tongue through the roof. The tongue is long, hollow and extremely flexible. She uses it to puncture the womb of the sleeping woman and to suck out the fetus. At other times, she seduces men with her beauty and lures them to a private place before eating them alive. She usually eats the insides, like the heart, stomach or the liver.  Sunlight is deadly to the ''manananggal'' when she is in her monstrous form.If her two halves are still separate with the coming of dawn, she will be destroyed. According to legend, to destroy the ''manananggal'', one should search for the lower torso that she leaves behind during her nightly hunts. Salt, ash, and/or garlic should then be placed on the exposed flesh, preventing the monster from combining again and leaving it vulnerable to sunlight. Small containers of salt, ash and raw rice, and the smell of burning rubber are said to deter the ''manananggal'' from approaching one's house.

==''Manaul''==
{{main|Manaul}}

The '''manaul''' is a mythical king who became a bird.  He was believed to have caused the seas and the skies to fight against each other.  The clash between the seas and skies resulted to the formation of the [[Philippine]] [[island|islands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=De Guzman|first=Daniel|url=https://www.aswangproject.com/role-birds-serpents-philippine-mythology/|title=The Role of Birds and Serpents in Philippine Mythology|publisher=The Aswang Project|access-date=20 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Mangkukulam''==
{{main|Mangkukulam}}

'''Mangkukulam''' or ''[[Mangkukulam|bruha]]'' (from Spanish: '''bruja''', "''witch''") are witches, wizards, ''bruho'' (Spanish:'''brujo''', "''wizard, male witch''"), or sorcerers who cast evil spells to humans. This [[witch|bewitcher]] is also called ''manggagaway''.&lt;ref name="TE"/&gt;  The ''Mangkukulam'' uses dark magic.

The difference between a ''mambabarang'' and a ''mangkukulam'' is that the ''mambabarang'' uses magical insects to bring harm to his victims. These insects are released after incantations, when they will search for their supposed victim and burrow under the skin, impregnating her. After some time, matruculans return to the house to kill the pregnant mother, open her abdomen, and eat the growing fetus.

==''Maria Makiling''==
{{main|Maria Makiling}}
[[File:MariaMakiling Philippinefolklore.JPG|thumb|170px|right|An illustrated depiction of Maria Makiling descending onto one of her favorite places on Mount Makiling, and greeted by butterflies and birds.]]
'''Mariang Makiling''' is a fairy who dwells atop [[Laguna (province)|Laguna]]'s [[Mount Makiling]], an inactive volcano. Oral tradition described that Mount Makiling was once a castle and Mariang Makiling was a princess who fell in love with a mortal.

==''Multo''==
{{main|Ghosts in Filipino culture|White Lady (ghost)}}
'''Multo''', the Tagalog word for [[ghost]], comes from the Spanish word ''muerto'', which means "dead". Superstitious Filipinos believe that some kind of ''multo'', often a spirit of their former kin, regularly visits them.

==''Nuno sa punso''==
{{main|Nuno sa punso}}

'''Nuno sa punso''' (literally, ''goblin of the mound'') are goblins or elves who live within mysterious lumps of soil ([[Ant colony|ant hills]]). They can provide a person who steps on their shelter with good luck or misfortune.&lt;ref name="TE"/&gt;  Superstitious Filipinos, when passing by a mound, will ask the resident nuno's permission to let them pass with the phrase, ''"Tabi-tabi po"''. Strange and sudden illnesses that befall a person are sometimes attributed to nunos.  It is also said that nunos don't like being pointed at, and could cause one to break a person's finger. If a medical condition is untreatable by modern medicine, it is often considered that a ''nuno'' has placed a curse on the patient. A special practitioner called''' ''albularyo''''', he carries out a traditional ceremony, melting candle wax into a spoon, pouring it into water and reading the shape formed by the wax thus informing their suggestions on how to dispel the curse. Usually this healing process involves an offering of food drink or trinkets to the ''nuno''. Failing that the patient can ask the ''nuno''’s forgiveness which usually works. As a last resort though catching a ''nuno'' and crushing its head is a sure way to remove the curse.

==''Pasatsat''==

'''Pasatsat''' is word rooted on the Pangasinense word ''satsat'', meaning "to stab". ''Pasatsat'' are ghosts of people who died or were killed in the Second World War. Coffins during the time were so expensive, so the families of the dead wrapped the corpses in reed mats or ''icamen''. The dead were buried in places other than cemeteries because tomb robberies were rampant during that era of extreme poverty. These ghosts usually show up in solitary paths and block passersby. To get rid of such a ghost, one needs to stab (hence ''pasatsat'') the reed mat and unravel it, but doing so will show no presence of a corpse, although the mat will emit a noxious odor, much like that of putrid flesh.

==''Santelmo''==

Legends say that when rain falls while the sun is shining, a pair of ''tikbalang'' are being wed.

It can also be an aborted fetus which comes back to take revenge on its mother. Most Tiyanaks are said to live in forests. If they see a human, they transform into what looks like a normal baby. When the person notices the Tiyanak and comes near to take a look at it, the Tiyanak changes back to its true form and eats its prey. And since they often seen coming out of trees it may also refer to [[Tboli people|Tboli]] legends, Tibolis are known for hanging their infants in trees who died after birth.

==''Wakwak''==
{{main|Wakwak}}

'''Wakwak''' originated from the word '''Uwak''' which is the ''Tagalog'' for '''Crow'''. It is assumed to grab humans at night as its prey, just like Manananggal and the tiktik who can fly. It likes to haunt in the rural areas of the Philippines. The Wakwak has no ability to separate its torso from its body. Some people believed that it is a night bird that belongs to a witch.

The Wakwak makes a sound by flapping its wings while flying. The sound that it produced is typically linked to the presence of an Unglu (vampire) or Ungo (ghost or monster). The Wakwak’s sound also indicates that it is searching for victims. When the sound is loud, it means that it is far from you. If not, then it is near you and ready to attack. The Wakwak rips and maims its victims and then feeds on their hearts. The old folks described the Wakwak as creatures with long sharp talons and a pair of wings just like bats. Its talons or claws are used in slashing its victims in order to retrieve their hearts.

'''''Pronkstilleven''''' ([[Dutch language|Dutch]] for 'ostentatious', 'ornate' or 'sumptuous' still life) is a style of ornate [[still life]] painting, which was developed in the 1640s in [[Antwerp]] from where it spread quickly to the [[Dutch Republic]]. 

==Development==
Flemish artists such as [[Frans Snyders]] and [[Adriaen van Utrecht]] started to paint still lifes that emphasized abundance by depicting a diversity of objects, fruits, flowers and dead game, often together with living people and animals.

The style was soon adopted by artists from the Dutch Republic.&lt;ref name=ox&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/pronkstilleven Oxford Dictionary of Art Terms: Pronkstilleven]&lt;/ref&gt;  A leading Dutch representative was [[Jan Davidsz. de Heem]], who spent a long period of his active career in Antwerp and was one of the founders of the style in Holland.&lt;ref name=rkd&gt;[https://rkd.nl/en/explore/artists/36842 Jan Davidsz. de Heem] at the Netherlands Institute for Art History {{link language|nl|Middle Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hermitage.nl/nl/pers/rubens_van_dyck_en_jordaens/achtergrond.htm [[Ben van Beneden]], ''Massijs, Rubens, Van Dyck en de anderen.]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Schilderkunst in Antwerpen, 1500-1650'' {{link language|nl|Middle Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other leading representatives in Flanders and the Dutch Republic were [[Nicolaes van Verendael]], [[Alexander Coosemans]], [[Carstian Luyckx]], [[Jasper Geeraards]], [[Peter Willebeeck]], [[Abraham van Beyeren]] and [[Willem Kalf]].&lt;ref name=ox/&gt;

[[Cornelis Norbertus Gijsbrechts]] developed the style further by incorporating pronkstillevens in the [[trompe-l'œil]] compositions for which he was known.  An example is his ''[[:File:Cornelis Norbertus Gijsbrechts - Silverware in an Open Cabinet.jpg|Silverware in an Open Cabinet]]'' at the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Ghent]].&lt;ref name=gijs&gt;[http://barokinvlaanderen.vlaamsekunstcollectie.be/nl/collectie/pronkstilleven-in-openstaande-kast Cornelis Norbertus Gijsbrechts, ''Pronkstilleven in an open cabinet''] at barokinvlaanderen {{link language|nl|Middle Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Meaning==
[[File:Cornelis Norbertus Gijsbrechts - Silverware in an Open Cabinet.jpg|thumb|''Silverware in an Open Cabinet'' by Cornelis Norbertus Gijsbrechts]]
Pronkstillevens are usually interpreted as a form of [[vanitas]] painting that conveys a moral lesson.  The various objects in the compositions serve as symbols that can be read as an admonition or a life lesson. The objects usually refer to the transience and emptiness of wealth and possessions and the ultimate extinction and emptiness of earthly life.

For instance, roses are often used as a vanitas motif, as they recall that all life and earthly beauty are fleeting. Hourglasses are an admonition that life is fleeting and will end.  Empty containers such as glasses or vases point to the emptiness of earthly wealth and aspirations.  The paintings remind the viewer of the need to practice moderation and temperance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tento.be/OKV-artikel/abraham-van-beyeren-pronk-stilleven L.J., Bol, ''Abraham van Beyeren - Pronk-stilleven''] at okv {{link language|nl|Middle Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1974, the [[Joint Committee on Standards for Educational Evaluation]] was charged with the responsibility of writing a companion volume to the 1974 revision of the ''Standards for Educational and Psychological Tests''.{{ref|AERAnewsletter}} This companion volume was to deal with issues and standards for [[program evaluation|program]] and [[curriculum]] [[evaluation]] in [[education]]. In 1975, the Joint Committee began work and ultimately decided to establish three separate sets of standards. These standards include ''[[Joint Committee on Standards for Educational Evaluation#The Personnel Evaluation Standards|The Personnel Evaluation Standards]]'', ''[[Joint Committee on Standards for Educational Evaluation#The Program Evaluation Standards|The Program Evaluation Standards]]'', and ''[[Joint Committee on Standards for Educational Evaluation#The Student Evaluation Standards|The Student Evaluation Standards]]''.

The '''Steel City''' is a common [[nickname]] for many cities that were once known for their production of large amounts of [[steel]].  With industrial production also in developing countries, like those in [[Eastern Europe]] and Asia, most of these cities do not produce as much steel as they used to.  It is possible there will be new ''steel cities'' in those [[developing countries]]. 

'''[[Sheffield]]''', [[South Yorkshire]], England, United Kingdom; '''[[Pittsburgh]]''', [[Pennsylvania]], United States;  '''[[Pueblo, Colorado|Pueblo]]''', [[Colorado]], United States; '''[[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]]''', [[New South Wales]], Australia; and '''[[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]]''', [[Ontario]], Canada are some of the cities most commonly referred to with this name, in their respective countries.

Steel City is also the name of the primary setting in [[Jules Verne]]'s novel ''[[The Begum's Fortune]]'' and is the location of the [[Titans East]] headquarters in the ''[[Teen Titans (animated series)|Teen Titans]]'' animated series.

'''TAO''' is the French acronym for ''Testing Assisté par Ordinateur'' (Computer Based Testing).

The TAO framework provides an open architecture for computer-assisted test development and delivery, with the potential to respond to the whole range of evaluation needs. It provides to all the actors of the entire computer-based assessment process a comprehensive set of functionalities enabling the creation, the management, and the delivery of electronic assessments.
The TAO platform is developed by the [http://www.emacs.uni.lu EMACS] research unit of the [http://www.uni.lu University of Luxembourg] and the SSI department of the [http://www.tudor.lu Centre de Recherche Public Henri Tudor].

== Overview ==

The TAO framework is an open-source project which provides a very general and open architecture for computer-assisted test development and delivery. As upcoming evaluation needs will imply the collaboration among a large number of stakeholders situated at different institutional levels and with very different needs for assessment tools, the TAO framework has the ambition to provide a modular and versatile framework for collaborative distributed test development and delivery with the potential to be extended and adapted to virtually every evaluation purpose that could be handled by the means of computer-based assessment.

In order to reach this goal, the testing problem has been broken down into its constitutive parts:
* Item development and management 	
* Subject management
* Test development and management 	
* Group management
* Test delivery management 	
* Results management

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Schema Processus TAO Platform 250.gif|thumb]] --&gt;

These parts are implemented under the form of multiple specialized modules connected in a peer-to-peer network. As the TAO architecture should fit into many different use cases, there is no central node in the system (the whole network of TAO nodes is an open-system with no global consistency) and it is assumed that there cannot be an a priori model for each data domain that reaches consensus within all the actors. On the contrary, each module owner or user is free to build the model that best corresponds to his own view. In order to support this model diversity, TAO modules are equipped with advanced modelling functionalities allowing users to build dynamically their own model and share data organized according to different models.

== Features ==

;General features
* Multilingual application - user interface as well as data is supported in most languages (European languages, Japanese, Chinese, Korean, Turkish, etc.)
* Web application - full Internet access without installation of any client application, except well-known and widely used browser plug-ins.

* Export results to csv files (excel, openoffice)
* Wizard to create report with multiple scores combined

== TAO Architecture ==

The description of the platform architecture at the current stage is organized on a component basis. A part of these components are independent from the computer-assisted testing domain.

The TAO platform should be considered as a particular instantiation (for a particular purpose) of a more general platform dedicated to the collaborative and distributed management of web resources and of the ontologies describing these resources. The more specific components will be presented afterward. The TAO platform consists in a series of interconnected modules. Each module is a specialization of a more generic kernel application called Generis4.

The specialization consists in adding a specific model to the kernel defining the domain of specialization, several plug-ins providing specific functionalities to the specialization according to the domain and relying on specific properties of the model, possibly some external applications, and a specific (optional) user graphical interface.

== TAO Modules ==

TAO is designed as a modular system. This decentralised structure is necessary on one hand to maintain the anonymity of the Subjects and on the other hand to allow the collaboration among several users, to change items and tests.

The modules may be placed on the same server or on different servers connected through the internet or local area networks.

There is a distinction between the portal of test execution (Delivery Server) and the servers of the different modules, providing the information about Subjects, Groups, Items, Tests, Deliveries and Results.

In the Subject module the testees are recorded and managed. Its flexibility allows the design of datasheets (e.g. name, address, birthday, gender, etc.). The Subjects may be assigned to sets according to the specific assessment context (Human resources management, education, edumetric monitoring, etc.).

The subjects may be subsumed in regard to global features and classifications in the Group module. The main object of this module is to assign the favoured test(s) to the appointed group. The Subjects and Tests that belong to one group may be originated from different modules on different servers. This module establishes the basis to run a test.

The Item module enables the creation and design of items, exercises. Different kinds of templates are provided to the item authors like Multiple Choice Question, puzzle design, Fill-in-the-gap, etc. Any other demands may be added within the scope of further development.

A selection of favourite Items – originated from different modules on different servers - is combined to a test in the Test module. Furthermore, the test mode (sequencing, scoring, cumulating, etc.) and layout is configured here.

In the Delivery module the test administrator will be able to define test campaigns, constraints on test execution (Test may be made available during a given period, Tests may be assigned with a maximum number of executions). This module will also enable to select on which Result module all results should be sent to.

The Test Delivery Server provides the compiled tests via URL. The Subjects will access their assigned Test(s) through their logins and passwords.
Finally all the results of passed tests with referring Subject, Group, Item and Test specific data as well as the individual data collected during test execution are stored and managed in the Result module.

== Item templates ==

Tests or surveys consist of items (exercises, questions) that may have different characteristics.These characteristics are defined by Item Templates. They describe the way an item is presented.

On the basis of a certain template an item is filled with text and/or multimedia elements, the Item Content. This process is called item authoring.

The main constituents of a particular item are its underlying Item Template and its specific Item Content.

TAO provides the following Item templates (types of items):

* '''[[QTI]]''': QTI covers a broad range of possible interactions.
* '''Open Web Item''': Users may upload their own little app and run them as items within TAO. An API allows to exchange the required information for results management or branching during the test. An open web item consists is built according to web technologies ([[HTML]], [[CSS]], [[Javascript]]) and give you all the freedom required for more complex things like simulation or game based assessment going beyond what the QTI standard allows to do.

'''''The Cathedral''''' ({{lang-pl|Katedra}}) is a 2002 animated [[science fiction]] [[short film]] directed by [[Tomasz Bagiński]]. It is based on the [[short story]] of the same name by [[Jacek Dukaj]], winner of the [[Janusz A. Zajdel Award]] in 2000. The film was nominated in [[2002 in film|2002]] for the [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film]] for the [[75th Academy Awards]]. The film also won the title of Best Animated Short at [[Siggraph]] 2002 in [[San Antonio]].

==Plot==
The film focuses on a man who visits a mystical, organic building that looks like a medieval cathedral. As he walks through the immense structure, the light from his torch falls upon the pillars, revealing human faces. The viewer later realizes that the faces are still alive, as several smile and open their eyes as the man walks past them.  The building's nature is partially unveiled at sunrise as the blinding light enchants the visitor and causes organic branch-like structures to burst from his chest. These protrusions then become another set of pillars in the building.

==Reception==
The film was nominated in 2002 for the [[Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film]] for the [[75th Academy Awards]]. The movie won the title of Best Animated Short at [[Siggraph]] 2002 in [[San Antonio]] as well as several other awards.

In May 2011, Polish Prime Minister [[Donald Tusk]] gave several gifts to American President [[Barack Obama]] for his tour in Europe, as is the custom. One of those gifts was an [[iPad]] loaded with ''The Cathedral''.&lt;ref&gt;John Funk ,''[http://www.escapistmagazine.com/news/view/110469-Polish-Prime-Minister-Gives-Obama-Witcher-2 Polish Prime Minister Gives Obama Witcher 2]'', 28 May 2011, The Escapist&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Return of the Condor Heroes''''', also called '''''The Giant Eagle and Its Companion''''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hamm|first=John Christopher|year=2005|title=Paper Swordsmen: Jin Yong and the Modern Chinese Martial Arts Novel|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=9780824828950}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1=Rojas, Carlos|editor2=Chow, Eileen|title=Rethinking Chinese Popular Culture: Cannibalizations of the Canon|series=Routledge Contemporary China Series|publisher=Routledge|year=2008|isbn=9781134032235}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[wuxia]] novel by [[Jin Yong]] (Louis Cha). It is the second part of the ''[[Condor Trilogy]]'' and was preceded by ''[[The Legend of the Condor Heroes]]'' and followed by ''[[The Heaven Sword and Dragon Saber]]''. It was first serialised between 20 May 1959 and 5 July 1961 in the Hong Kong newspaper ''[[Ming Pao]]''.&lt;ref&gt;The date conforms to the data published in Chen Zhenhui (陳鎮輝), ''Wuxia Xiaoshuo Xiaoyao Tan'' (武俠小說逍遙談), 2000, Huizhi Publishing Company (匯智出版有限公司), p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

The story revolves around the protagonist, [[Yang Guo]], and his lover and martial arts master, [[Xiaolongnü]], in their adventures in the ''[[jianghu]]'' (also called the ''wulin'', the community of martial artists), where love between master and apprentice is seen as taboo. Jin Yong revised the novel in 1970 and again in 2004. There are 40 chapters in the second and third revisions. Each chapter has a title composed of four Chinese characters. Most of the revisions are either clarifications or minor alterations of character motivations or names. The Chinese title of the novel translates to ''The Divine Eagle and the Heroic Couple''.

==Plot==
The protagonist, [[Yang Guo]], is the orphaned son of [[Yang Kang]], one of the antagonists in ''[[The Legend of the Condor Heroes]]'', who is also the sworn brother of Guo Jing. The couple [[Guo Jing]] and [[Huang Rong]] take care of Yang Guo for a short period of time before sending him to the [[Quanzhen School|Quanzhen Sect]] on [[Mount Zhongnan]] for better guidance in moral values and orthodox martial arts. In Quanzhen, Yang Guo is often picked on and bullied by his fellow students, and discriminated against by his master, Zhao Zhijing. Yang Guo flees from Quanzhen and ventures unknowingly into the nearby Tomb of the Living Dead, where the [[Ancient Tomb Sect]] is based. There, he meets [[Xiaolongnü]], a mysterious maiden of unknown origin, and becomes her apprentice. They live together in the tomb for many years until Yang Guo grows up.

Yang Guo and Xiaolongnü develop romantic feelings for each other, but their romance is forbidden by the prevailing norms of the ''jianghu'' (or ''wulin'', the community of martial artists). Throughout the story, their love meets with several tests, such as the misunderstandings that threaten to tear them apart, and their encounter with Gongsun Zhi, whom Xiaolongnü almost marries at one point. Finally, after their reunion and marriage, Xiaolongnü leaves Yang Guo again, owing to her belief she cannot recover from a fatal poison and promises to meet him again 16 years later, to prevent him from committing suicide. While Yang Guo is wandering the ''jianghu'' alone, he meets several formidable martial artists and a giant eagle, and improves his skills tremendously after learning from them. His adventures gradually mold him into a courageous hero and perhaps the most powerful martial artist of his time. Yang Guo serves his native land by helping the [[Han Chinese]] people of the [[Song dynasty|Song Empire]] resist invaders from the [[Mongol Empire]]. At the end of the novel, he is reunited with Xiaolongnü and they leave to lead the rest of their lives in seclusion after receiving praises and blessings from the ''wulin''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2724">'''The Yellow Dwarf''' is a French literary [[fairy tale]] by [[Madame d'Aulnoy]].  [[Andrew Lang]] included it in ''[[The Blue Fairy Book]]''.

==Synopsis==

A widowed queen spoiled her only daughter, who was so beautiful that kings vied for the honor of her hand, not believing they could attain it.  Uneasy that her daughter would never marry, the queen went to visit the [[Fairy]] of the Desert for advice.  She made a cake to protect herself from the lions that guarded the fairy, but she lost it.  A yellow [[dwarf (mythology)|dwarf]] offered to save her in return for her daughter's hand.  She accepted, but when the dwarf showed the miserable home in which her daughter would live, she grew quite ill.

Her daughter, distressed, went to seek the same fairy.  The dwarf told her what her mother had promised, and when she was ready to reject it, the lions arrived.  She agreed if he would save her.  Back at the castle, she fell quite ill and agreed to marry the King of the Gold Mines.  However, at the wedding, the Fairy of the Desert and the Yellow Dwarf interrupted.  The dwarf carried off the princess, and the fairy fell in love with the king and carried him off.  She chained him in a cave and turned herself into a beautiful woman, but her feet being unchanged, the king was able to tell who she was.  He told her that he would hate the fairy as long as she kept him chained up, but would love her if she freed him.  The Fairy of the Desert freed him and brought him to her castle, carrying him by the castle where the princess lived; she saw them and became convinced that the king was unfaithful to her.

The king was kept more pleasantly, but was unable to escape.  He lamented his fate along the sea, and a [[mermaid]] left enchanted sea rushes behind to look like his body and freed him.  She gave him a sword to fight his way to the princess.

The fairy was entirely deceived by the sea rushes and did not pursue him.

The king fought his way through [[sphinx]]es and [[dragon]]s to find his path blocked by maidens with garlands of flowers; he still pressed on, tearing apart their garlands, and reached the princess.  He persuaded her of his fidelity, but the Yellow Dwarf found them and killed him.  The princess died of grief.

The mermaid was only able to change their bodies to two palm trees.

'''''Tombs of the Blind Dead''''' is a 1972 Spanish-Portuguese [[horror film]] written and directed by [[Amando de Ossorio]].&lt;ref name=bfi&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b74d6b963|title=La NOCHE DEL TERROR CIEGO (1972)|work=[[British Film Institute]]|accessdate=14 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its original Spanish title is '''''La noche del terror ciego''''' ({{literal translation}} [[English language|English]]: ''The Night of the Blind Terror'').

The film was the first in Ossorio's "Blind Dead" series, spawning three official sequels: ''[[Return of the Blind Dead]]'' (1973), ''[[The Ghost Galleon]]'' (1974) and ''[[Night of the Seagulls]]'' (1975). Its success helped kickstart the Spanish horror film boom of the early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.riseaboverecords.com/artists/riseaboveartists/zoltan/|work=Rise Above Record|title=Zoltan|accessdate=17 October 2017|archivedate=31 March 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160331203843/http://www.riseaboverecords.com/artists/riseaboveartists/zoltan/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''A Companion to the Horror Film'', edited by Harry M. Benshoff&lt;/ref&gt;

Ossorio has stated that [[Gustavo Adolfo Bécquer]]'s [[Gothic horror]] legend ''El monte de las ánimas'' (1862) and [[George Romero]]'s ''[[Night of the Living Dead]]'' (1968) both influenced the creation of his film. 

==Plot==
Legend has that in the abandoned medieval town of Berzano, at the border between [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]], the [[Knights Templar]] (a fictionalized version of the real-life order that was dissolved in the 14th century following charges of witchcraft and heresy) leave their tombs at night and come back from the dead as [[revenants]]. The reanimated corpses are blind, because their eyes were pecked out by birds while their hanged bodies rotted on the gallows.

While on vacation nearby with her friend Roger Whelan, Virginia White reconnects with her dear college friend Betty "Bet" Turner , who relocated in the area and now runs a mannequin factory. Roger immediately takes a liking to Betty and invites her along for a train journey, provoking Virginia's jealousy, as the two women had had a romantic relationship years prior. Angry at both, Virginia jumps off the train. Wandering through the country, she comes upon the ruins of Berzano, where she decides to camp overnight. The knights rise from their tombs and attack her, ultimately biting and ripping her flesh. Her corpse is found in a field the following morning by the returning train conductor.

The next morning, Betty and Roger retrace Virginia's steps, trying to find out what happened to her. They hear about the legend from some locals and meet two police investigators who inform them about Virginia's horrible fate. Later at the morgue, next to Betty's laboratory, Virginia's corpse comes back to life and kills a custodian, then flees to the lab and is only stopped by Betty's assistant, who manages to set Virginia on fire inside the mannequin factory.

In the meantime, Betty and Roger are investigating the legend with the help of Professor Pedro Candal, who indirectly send them to find his son Pedro, who lives near Berzano as a small-time smuggler and is suspected by the police to be the one who killed Virginia as a way to instill fear in the locals. Once they've located Pedro and convinced him to help them prove the knights are real, Betty and Roger return with Pedro and his lover Nina to Berzano, to confront the knights once and for all.

Upon their arrival, they are confronted by the knights, who kill Roger, Pedro and Nina. The knights find Betty through her heartbeat, and she flees from Berzano with the knights in pursuit. She boards a passing train, hiding in a cargo of coal. The knights take charge of the train, killing the conductor and cannibalizing passengers onboard. The train arrives at the station shortly thereafter, and Betty, speechless, is helped by a station attendant. As several passengers go to board the train, they scream in horror at the sight inside.

Although the Knights are identifiable by their uniforms, they are never called "Templars" in the film; they are referred to as "Knights from the East". Ossorio objected to the description of the revenant Templars as "[[zombie]]s", insisting that they more resembled [[Mummy|mummies]] who feed like [[vampires]] and that, unlike zombies, the Templars were not mindless corpses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alternateending.com/2009/04/legend-of-the-zombie-crusaders.html|work=Alternate Ending|title=Tombs of the Blind Dead|author=Brayton, Tim|date=19 April 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170606171413/http://www.alternateending.com/2009/04/legend-of-the-zombie-crusaders.html|archivedate=6 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Exterior scenes in the film were shot in Portugal and Spain.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} In Portugal, locations included Lisbon and surrounding areas (Estoril, Setúbal, Sesimbra y Palmela).{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} In Spain, film credits mention the monastery at El Cercón, Madrid, but the scenes with the impressive sinister ruins were filmed at the Santa María La Real de Valdeiglesias monastery in [[Pelayos de la Presa]].{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

==Edited Versions==

The Spanish version, ''La noche del terror ciego'', differed from the retitled English version. In the latter, a flashback of the living Knights Templar torturing and drinking the blood of a female victim was moved to the beginning of the film, and most of the sex and gore (for instance, the scene depicting the lesbian relationship between Betty and Virginia, and the sequence on a train in which the Knights kill a woman in front of her child) were removed.&lt;ref name=dvdtalk&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/17752/blind-dead-collection-the/|title=The Blind Dead Collection|last=Tyner|first=Adam|work=[[DVD Talk]]|date=18 September 2005|accessdate=9 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American distributors decided to severely re-edit the film for its English-language release and add a new opening scene to cash in on the success of the ''[[Planet of the Apes]]'' film series. The plan was to replace the film's original setting with a [[post-apocalyptic]] future in which the undead were deceased intelligent apes, similar to the ones seen in ''Planet of the Apes''. Rather than doing a reshoot, location footage from the film was edited together, the Templar flashback sequence was removed, and a narration track explaining the premise was produced as an introduction. The revised film was retitled ''Revenge from Planet Ape''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Critical Outcast|date=21 September 2014|url=http://www.criticaloutcast.com/2014/09/movie-review-revenge-from-planet-ape.html|title=Movie Review: Revenge from Planet Ape (aka Tombs of the Blind Dead)|accessdate=17 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Re-release==
The film was released on [[DVD]] on 20 October 1998 by [[Anchor Bay Entertainment]] as a double feature with ''[[Return of the Blind Dead]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=Digitally Obsessed|title=dOc DVD Review: Tombs of the Blind Dead / Return of the Blind Dead|url=http://www.digitallyobsessed.com/displaylegacy.php?ID=317|accessdate=17 October 2017|author=Dobson, Dale|date=22 July 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Writing in ''The Zombie Movie Encyclopedia'', academic [[Peter Dendle]] said, "Spanish filmmaker de Ossorio earned international fame with this widely popular tale of blind zombie monks, creating a fresh mythology and unforgettable zombies, all set against imposing scenic backgrounds".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Zombie Movie Encyclopedia|last=Dendle|first=Peter|authorlink=Peter Dendle|publisher=[[McFarland &amp; Company]]|year=2001|pages=171–173|isbn=978-0-7864-9288-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Allmovie]] gave the film a positive review, praising the film's make-up effects, chilling atmosphere, and soundtrack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=La Noche del Terror Ciego (1971) - Review - AllMovie|url=http://www.allmovie.com/movie/la-noche-del-terror-ciego-v67230/review|website=Allmovie.com|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
''[[TV Guide]]'' awarded the film 2 out of 4 stars and called it "a slow and lackadaisically plotted thirsty-corpse movie distinguished by terrific music and locations, and genuinely eerie zombies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tombs Of The Blind Dead Review|url=http://movies.tvguide.com/tombs-of-the-blind-dead/review/109600|website=TV Guide.com|accessdate=10 November 2014}} {{rating|2|4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brett H. from ''Oh the Horror!'' gave the film a positive review, stating, "''Tombs of the Blind Dead'' is a slow moving Spanish classic that is a must see for all fans of creature features with ample amounts of all the things that make horror great. It's not perfect and it does have some small inconsistencies (why in the world are the Templars so powerful, yet sometimes swing their swords like goofy puppets?), but you'll be too engulfed in the atmosphere and monsters to worry too much about it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=H|first1=Brett|title=Horror Reviews - Tombs of the Blind Dead (1971)|url=http://www.oh-the-horror.com/page.php?id=672|website=Oh the Horror.com|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Jeremy Zoss from ''[[Film Threat]]'' gave the film a negative review, stating, "Like many old works of entertainment from Mexico [''[[sic]]''], ''Tombs of the Blind Dead'' is not without its charms. It would be a great film to watch while drunk with a group of friends. However, when looking for a real horror film, the ''Blind Dead'' are definitely not worth seeing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zoss|first1=Jeremy|title=Tombs Of The Blind Dead|url=http://www.filmthreat.com/reviews/3381/|work=Film Threat|archiveurl=https://archive.today/20171017075608/http://filmthreat.com/uncategorized/tombs-of-the-blind-dead/|archivedate=17 October 2017|date=4 January 2009|accessdate=10 November 2014|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Film critic [[John Kenneth Muir]] gave the film a mostly positive review, writing that the film lost momentum after the first act but praised the film's suspense, unsettling imagery and the effectiveness of the Templar revenants as "genuinely scary".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Horror Films of the 1970s|last=Muir|first=John Kenneth|publisher=[[McFarland &amp; Company]]|year=2002|isbn=978-0-786-49156-8|pages=238–240|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ghmYvJReqIIC&amp;pg=PA238}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adam Tyner of [[DVD Talk]] wrote, "Although ''Tombs of the Blind Dead'' isn't a particularly gory film, several of its sequences are deeply unsettling".&lt;ref name=dvdtalk/&gt;

The film has an approval rating of 57% on film review aggregate [[Rotten Tomatoes]] and an average rating of 5.5 out of 10 based on seven reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tombs Of The Blind Dead (Noche del terror ciego) - Rotten Tomatoes|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/tombs-of-the-blind-dead-noche-del-terror-ciego/|website=Rotten Tomatoes.com|accessdate=12 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==  History of the Institution ==
*The Public University "Haxhi Zeka" is a successor to the Faculty of Applied Business Sciences (FABS) in Peja, founded in 1960 with the decision of the Executive Council of KSAK as the High Commercial and Commercial School in Peja. Initially, the school had only the Commercial Business Unit in the Enterprise and a small number of teachers. In the first year of study 1960/61 120 students were registered. Since then, the school has engaged in the training of economists' professional cadres that respond to social and economic conditions. The activity and development of the Higher School of Economics was always oriented to building that kind of regular curriculum that would form economists with contemporary professional skills that would respond to the needs of economic development and business in general.
*From the High School of Economics came several thousand economists from Kosovo and other ethnic Albanian territories (Macedonia, Montenegro, Serbia, etc.). This number of economists best expresses the contribution of the school they gave to the economy of Kosovo and all the Albanian lands. The High School of Economics in Peja experienced some very interesting and important existential periods of time.
*These periods can be divided as follows: 1960-1974 - period of formation and establishment of institutional identity 1975- 1990 - period of affirmation of the School in Kosovo and all other places around Kosovo, 1991-1999 - survival period, through continuity of continuity through the parallel organization of learning in private homes 2000-2006 - the reorganization period of the FASB.

But once he reached the editing phase and realized how off putting the models and animation were, he changed the score and some of the dialogue to give it a darker edge and make it feel more "bi-polar". After "Tainted Milk" was complete he began work on the other two segments but tried to treat them more like serious horror films and use less comedic elements, though he has stated that he tried to inject a little humor into each short. But due to the statements being taken out of context, a rumor began that the entire film was a failed attempt at a comedy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2095004/faq?ref_=tt_faq_1#.2.1.1 FAQ for Where the Dead Go to Die], [[IMDB]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E32rpG3cMLc |title=The Royale Reel Rundown - Interview with Jimmy ScreamerClauz |publisher=YouTube |date=2015-05-10 |accessdate=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jason Ours |url=http://www.fromdusktillcon.com/content/reviews/165-reviews-showcase/2129-brundlefly-s-cinema-holocaust-an-impossible-attempt-to-describe-insanity-a-look-at-where-the-dead-go-to-die-director-jimmy-screamerclauz-interview |title=Brundlefly'S Cinema Holocaust: An Impossible Attempt To Describe Insanity - A Look At 'Where The Dead Go To Die' + Director Jimmy Screamerclauz Interview |publisher=Fromdusktillcon.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.searchmytrash.com/cgi-bin/articlecreditsb.pl?jimmyscreamerclauz%283-12%29 |title=(re)Search my Trash |publisher=Search my Trash |date= |accessdate=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The main animation software used on the film is called [[Cinema 4D]].
* The movie is dedicated to Jennifer English, who voiced Tommy's mother.
* Jimmy Screamerclauz says all the surreal and graphic imagery has no deeper meaning behind it and is just there because he liked it.

==Release and reception==
The film was released on [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]] on February 21, 2012. [[Unearthed Films]] handles the home video distribution. The film has yet to be released on streaming services.{{CN|date=July 2017}}

''Where the Dead Go to Die'' was panned by many viewers and Internet animation critics, criticizing its three stories, animation, characters, voice acting, writing, use of music, and incredibly dark content, such as eating fetuses, [[genital mutilation]], [[bestiality]], and [[necrophilia]]. It was however reviewed well in many horror publications, such as Rue Morgue,&lt;ref&gt;http://screamerclauz.com/wtdgtd/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2015/05/ruemorgue.jpg&lt;/ref&gt; DVDtalk,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdtalk.com/reviews/55211/where-the-dead-go-to-die/ |title=Where The Dead Go To Die : DVD Talk Review of the DVD Video |publisher=Dvdtalk.com |date= |accessdate=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and horrornews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Film Review: Where the Dead Go to Die (2012) |url=http://horrornews.net/43375/film-review-where-the-dead-go-to-die-2012/ |title=Film Review: Where the Dead Go to Die (2012) |publisher=Horrornews.net |date= |accessdate=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''White [[Dacha]]''', ({{lang-ru|белая дача}}; {{lang-uk|біла дача}}) is the house that [[Anton Chekhov]] had built in [[Yalta]] and in which he wrote some of his greatest work. It is now a [[writer's house museum]].&lt;ref name="foundation"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://antonchekhovfoundation.org/en/chekhov-house-museum-in-yalta|title=History of the House-Museum|work=Anton Chekhov Foundation/Yalta Chekhov Campaign|accessdate=23 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00pxmcv|title=The House That Chekhov Built|work=BBC Radio 4|accessdate=23 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Building==
The White Dacha was built in 1898 following Chekhov's success with ''[[The Seagull]]''. He took up residence there after his father's death and to aid him with coping with [[tuberculosis]]. Chekhov planted a variety of trees including [[mulberry]], cherry, almond, peach, [[cypress]], citrus, [[acacia]] and [[birch]]. He also kept dogs and tame cranes.&lt;ref name="Yalta"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yaltachekhov.org/history.html|title=History of the House-Museum|work=Yalta Chekhov Campaign|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090122050556/http://yaltachekhov.org/history.html|archivedate=January 22, 2009|accessdate=November 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Museum"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yalta.chekhov.com.ua/|title=Chehov's House-museum Website|website=www.yalta.chekhov.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100107031500/http://www.yalta.chekhov.com.ua/start_r.php4?|archivedate=January 7, 2010|accessdate=November 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The house was designed by L.N. Shapovalov. [[Aleksandr Kuprin]] described the house as follows,

&lt;blockquote&gt;
It was, perhaps, the most original building in Yalta. It is all white, pure, easy, beautifully asymmetrical, ... with a tower, and unexpected ledges, with a glass veranda below and an open terrace above, with scattered broad and narrow windows... ".
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

V.N. Ladygensky mentioned that "a dacha in Crimea, in Аutka, near Yalta, was validly constructed, excellent".&lt;ref name="Yalta" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Museum"/&gt;
From the study one can see the seafront that inspired "[[The Lady with the Dog]]", and at the back the scene that inspired the setting of ''[[The Cherry Orchard]]'' is visible. He also wrote the ''[[Three Sisters (play)|Three Sisters]]'' and ''The Bishop'' on the site.&lt;ref name="Yalta"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Independent"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/theatre-dance/features/restoration-drama-how-chekhovs-home-has-fallen-into-disrepair-1026124.html|title=Restoration drama: How Chekhov's home has fallen into disrepair|last=Pennington|first=Michael|date=2008-11-20|work=The Independent|accessdate=23 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Museum"/&gt;

==Museum==
[[File:Chekhov White Dacha study.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Chekhov in the study at the White Dacha]]
After Chekhov's death (1904) the house was looked after by his sister, Masha, until 1921 when it became a museum. During the Nazi occupation Maria Pavlovna refused to leave and put up pictures of [[Gerhart Hauptmann|Hauptmann]] (the German dramatist)&lt;!--- not "the Hauptmann" ie "the captain" &amp; not just ---&gt; any "a...dramatist" on the wall and refused to let a German officer move into her brother's rooms. Nothing went missing but the house was damaged by one of the last air raids on the area by the [[Luftwaffe]]. &lt;ref name="Independent"/&gt;

=== Museum funding issues ===
The Soviet government, as with other such heritage sites, diligently looked after the house but following the [[breakup of the USSR]], the responsibility for the house's upkeep came under dispute. [[Crimea]] became an [[autonomous republic]] within Ukraine. The museum falls under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Culture of the Crimean Autonomous Republic and their budget is extremely small. The Ukrainian state authorities would like the Russian government to pay for upkeep since Chekhov was Russian, but the Russians do not agree. The house has now become dilapidated.&lt;ref name="Independent"/&gt; On May 11, 2010, [[Ukrainian President]], [[Viktor Yanukovych]], ordered that repairs and restoration work be carried out on the house.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/66351/|title=Yanukovych gives range of orders to Crimean government|newspaper=Kyiv Post|date=May 11, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100513032155/http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/66351/|archivedate=May 13, 2010|accessdate=November 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Noted visitors==

Chekhov was a noted host and entertained [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Feodor Chaliapin]], [[Sergei Rachmaninoff]], and [[Maxim Gorky]] at the Dacha.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=206|title=Lonely Planet Ukraine|author=Sarah Johnstone |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Benedetti, Jean|title=Dear Writer, Dear Actress: The Love Letters of Olga Knipper and Anton Chekhov|publisher=Methuen Publishing Ltd|year=1998 |isbn=978-0-413-72390-1|pages=37, 270}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leonid Kuchma]] and [[Vladimir Putin]] and their spouses visited the museum in 2003.&lt;ref name="foundation"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Independent"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="46887">Since the late 20th century, substantial [[labour migration]] from developing countries to high-income countries has occurred. 
This includes a substantial portion of female migrants.  The term '''feminization of migration''' has been proposed as a suggested "[[gendered]] pattern" in [[international migration]] where there is a trend towards a higher percentage of women among voluntary migrants.&lt;ref name=Lan&gt;Lan, Pei-Chia. ''Global Cinderellas: Migrant Domestics and Newly Rich Employers in Taiwan''. Durham, NC: Duke UP, 2006. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
Studies on women migrant workers in high-income countries tend to focus on their employment in [[domestic work]] and [[care work]] for dual-income families.

For more than 4 decades, female migrant numbers have rivaled those of male migrants.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; By 2000, the difference between female and male migrant numbers stayed about the same since 1960, with 5 million more male migrants than female migrants.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Statistics==
According to estimates published by the World Bank, there has been only a slight increase in the percentage of women among international migrants over the past fifty years, with 46.7% estimated for 1960 and 48.4% for 2010.&lt;ref&gt;Morrison, Schiff &amp; Sjöblom (2008): ''The International Migration of Women''. Washington: The World Bank. Page 2; [http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTLAC/Resources/Factbook2011-Ebook.pdf Migration and Remittances Factbook 2011].&lt;/ref&gt; 

Although "South-South migration" (migration between developing countries) is generally more substantial than migration from developing to high-income countries, the World Bank estimates that there are about 73 million migrants from developing countries living in high-income OECD countries; about half being female and half being male.&lt;ref&gt;these numbers include both refugees and migrant workers. [http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTLAC/Resources/Factbook2011-Ebook.pdf Migration and Remittances Factbook 2011].
&lt;/ref&gt;

According to censuses carried out in 1990, the United Nations Population Division estimated that women constitute 48% of all migrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|year=2001|title=Trends in International Migration 2001|url=http://www.keepeek.com/Digital-Asset-Management/oecd/social-issues-migration-health/trends-in-international-migration-2001_migr_outlook-2001-en#page27|journal=OECD|volume=|pages=374|via=OECD iLibrary}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, 52% of the 56 million migrants in Europe were female.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/global-dimensions-female-migration|title=The Global Dimensions of Female Migration|date=2003-03-01|work=migrationpolicy.org|access-date=2017-03-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of immigrants in Europe has continually increased, due to a higher demand for [[care work]] for multi-income families, among other things.&lt;ref name=WMW&gt;{{cite journal|author=Beneria, Lourdes|year=2008|title=The crisis of care, international migration, and public policy|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13545700802081984#.UkAVLIZTAhE|journal= Feminist Economics|volume= 14|issue=3|pages=1–21|doi=10.1080/13545700802081984}}&lt;/ref&gt; The major sites for female labor include GCC countries in Western Asia as well as Pacific Rim countries in Eastern and Southeastern Asia.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; By 2000, there were 5 million female migrants compared to 4.9 million male migrants in Eastern and Southeastern Asia.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In Western Asia, female migrants constituted 48% of all migrants in the region.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Women migrants work in domestic occupations that are considered part of the [[informal sector]] and lack a degree of government [[regulation]] and protection. [[Lourdes Beneria]], a [[feminist economics|feminist economist]], argues that the demand for care work in Europe in the 1990s and 2000s has brought young [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Latinas]] to countries like [[Spain]], in order to provide care work for the aging population. The demand for these workers has risen due to an increasing number of European women moving toward the formal sector of work, leaving their domestic duties for hire.

Women leaving their country of origin are often considered to be temporary migrants. They leave for an uncertain amount of time, with the intent to return to their homeland after they have earned enough money. Given that women are statistically better at saving their capital gains, they are becoming increasingly economically significant to the capital gains of their country of origin.&lt;ref name="unwomen-eseasia.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unwomen-eseasia.org/projects/migrant/08capacity.pdf|title=Women Migrant Workers Capacity and Contribution}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be measured through [[remittance]]s and how much is sent back to the country of origin. Documentaries, such as ''Letters from the Other Side'', illustrate that after some time, remittances may cease due to new responsibilities or new circumstances that migrant workers face.&lt;ref&gt;Courtney, Heather, dir. Letters from the Other Side. Side street Films, 2006. Film.&lt;/ref&gt;

Economic impacts and the impact of women working abroad have both negative and positive impacts upon traditional family roles, children, and gender roles. In addition to diversifying the domestic workforce, women migrant workers also impact the global economy. Remittances by women migrant workers help bolster the [[Gross domestic product|GDPs]] of their countries of origin.

==Feminization of migration==
The term '''feminization of migration''' was used by the United Nations in a 2007 working paper.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|year=2007|title=Feminization of Migration|url=http://www.renate-europe.net/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Feminization_of_Migration-INSTRAW2007.pdf|journal=UN-INSTRAW|volume=|pages=7|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Gender, Remittances and Development. Feminization of Migration 2007''. Working paper 1 for United Nations Instraw. Page 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Donato&gt;Donato, K. M., Gabaccia, D., Holdaway, J., Manalansan, M. and Pessar, P. R. (2006), ''A Glass Half Full? Gender in Migration Studies''. International Migration Review, 40: 3–26. {{doi|10.1111/j.1747-7379.2006.00001.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; It refers to an increase in the proportion of female migrant workers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

For a long time,{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=June 2017}} females have constituted a high proportion of all international migrants.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1960, females constituted 47 out of every 100 migrants residing in a foreign country.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 2000, women made up almost 49% of all international migrants.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Although these statistics illustrate a "feminization of migration", a high level of feminization already existed in 1960.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Female laborers are mostly found in low-status and unskilled occupations.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|year=2007|title=Women and Migration|url=https://www.fidh.org/IMG/pdf/Femme_Migrations_Eng.pdf|journal=FIDH|volume=|pages=4|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to this, "women migrants are particularly vulnerable to human trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation, a multimillion-dollar business."&lt;ref name="unfpa.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/pds/migration.html|title=Migration: a world on the move." United Nations Population Fund}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many women in [[Latin America]] respond to demands created in Europe, especially Spain, for jobs as care workers for dual-income houses.&lt;ref name="WMW" /&gt; This demand is created by the increase in European women moving from their traditional household labors to market work, where they can contribute to a company's bottom line.

Limited education can force those with a lack of skills to move to a foreign country to help support their family, but these situations often promote [[exploitation of labour|exploitation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=1998|title=The Social-Economy Impacts of Women Migrant Workers on their Families and Communities|journal=A Case Study in Waru Doyong Village, Central Java, Indonesia|volume=4|pages=144–162|ssrn=1833004|author=Hunga, Arianti Ina}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The increase in feminization of migration has led to an increase in concerns regarding females' security in the locations in which they are moving to such as human rights issues and security.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.prb.org/Publications/Articles/2006/TheFeminizationofMigration.aspx|title=Feminization of Migration|website=www.prb.org|access-date=2017-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The controversy surrounding migration has led to challenges for international analysts as they look to change implications. Assumptions have been made regarding the reason women migrate, which causes popular debate among developing countries in considering implication changes.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

Some of the issues this research addresses are [[remittances]] and their economic impacts, family cohesion, the [[racialization]] of migrants, [[human trafficking]], gendered [[division of labor]], and economic as well as educational opportunities.&lt;ref name=Donato/&gt;&lt;ref name=Zlotnik&gt;Zlotnik, Hania. ''The Global Dimensions of Female Migration.'' Migration Information Source. Mar. 2003. Web. 04 Mar. 2011. &lt;http://www.migrationinformation.org/feature/display.cfm?ID=109&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to the gender studies boom of the 1990s, statistical evidence on migration patterns have not often been classified by gender.&lt;ref name=Zlotnik/&gt;

A more recent shift in migration, in September 2014, patterns relates to an increase in the migration of single women and partnered women who migrate without their families.&lt;ref name=Lan/&gt;

==Gender-specific division of labor==
Much of the work made available to women migrants is gendered and concentrated in the entertainment industry,&lt;ref name=":0b"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zheng|first=Tiantian|year=2008|title=Anti-Trafficking Campaign and Karaoke Bar Hostesses in China|journal=Wagadu: A Journal of Transnational Women's and Gender Studies|volume=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[health services]], and most of all in the domestic services.&lt;ref name=Lan/&gt;

The gendered [[division of labor]] includes [[reproductive labor]], which refers to work performed within the domestic or private sphere and which helps to sustain a household (e.g. cleaning, cooking, childcare and rearing, etc.).&lt;ref name=Lan/&gt; Reproductive labor enables paid, productive labor to take place.&lt;ref name=Lan/&gt; Reproductive labor is typically performed by women and, as dominant gender discourses are threaded throughout labor ideologies, domestic work has historically been considered a "natural" part of a woman's duties and [[Identity (social science)|identity]].&lt;ref name=Lan/&gt; As such, feminized labor has typically been considered "unskilled" and, thus, has gone unpaid.&lt;ref name=Lan/&gt;

As noted by Filipino [[popular culture studies]] professor Roland Tolentino, when women migrate to perform domestic labor, "unpaid home labor in the [[Separate spheres|domestic sphere]] becomes paid labor in international spaces".&lt;ref name=Lan/&gt;

===Analyses of migrant nannies===
It has been argued that women migrants working as full-time [[nannies]] support the shift in division of labour in the First World because it becomes affordable to outsource child-care for a larger portion of families.&lt;ref name="Cheever, Susan 2002"&gt;Cheever, Susan. "The Nanny Dilemma." Global Women: Nannies, Maids, and Sex Workers in the New Economy. New York City: Metropolitan /Henry Holt and, 2002. 31-38. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  
At the same time, it has been argued, the absence of the migrants working as nannies in high-income countries in their home countries create a shift of gender roles in developing countries as well.&lt;ref name="Gamburd, Michele 2002"&gt;Gamburd, Michele. "Breadwinner No More." Global Women: Nannies, Maids, and Sex Workers in the New Economy. New York City: Metropolitan /Henry Holt and, 2002. 190-206. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, both the first-world  mother and the nanny are arguably [[outsourcing]] child care to someone else—the mother to the nanny and the nanny to either her husband, one of her children, or a family relative.  The First World mother gives up her time as mother by going to work and paying the nanny to take care and raise the child. The mother passes on her role as mother to the nanny.  At the same time, the nanny is giving up her time with her children and passing on her role to another person back in her home country.  And, when a woman migrates to a First World country, she is taking on the gender role of "[[breadwinner model|breadwinner]]" of the family—a role that has traditionally been the role of the man in the family, yet the restructuring of the family and [[globalization]] have started changing this ideology of the man being the main financial caretaker of the family.&lt;ref name="Cheever, Susan 2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gamburd, Michele 2002"/&gt;

Those men within the familial unit are displaced as the "breadwinner" for their family—the migrant mothers take over this role when they leave for a First World country and send her earnings back home as [[remittances]] (Add source). This may lead to the perceived [[emasculation]] of the husband, who is left with three options:
# Take on the role of the women in her absence
# Find a job of his own within the Third World country in order to still be seen as a financial contributor and still be considered a man
# Reject the womanly role and continue to not provide to the family in relation to child care and house work.&lt;ref name="Gamburd, Michele 2002"/&gt;

Nannies leave their children back in the Third World countries, taking their love with them.  The mothers (nannies) then need someone to love at the moment, therefore most usually giving their love to the closest children possible—the ones that they are nannies for.&lt;ref name="Cheever, Susan 2002"/&gt;  The child that is being taken care of by the nanny is also lacking someone to love because his/her parents are working during the day, and depending on the exact situation it is hard to tell how much of a [[parenting]] [[role]] they take when they get home from work.

In many cases the children in turn love the person that is most like a parent to them; the person they spend most of their time with—their nanny.&lt;ref name="Cheever, Susan 2002"/&gt;  Parents often become jealous of the nannies; however, they are the ones who decided to have kids, the ones that decided to pursue working jobs, and those who decided to hire a nanny.&lt;ref name="Cheever, Susan 2002"/&gt;  This often leads to the parents firing the nanny.  Yet, most children have created a bond with their nanny, and they have come to assume that the nanny is going to be a part of their life for some time.&lt;ref name="Cheever, Susan 2002"/&gt;  The firing of a nanny in some cases leave a child heart-broken and the nanny as well for she has treated this child as one of her own.&lt;ref name="Cheever, Susan 2002"/&gt;
  
From studies and personal stories of family members, scholars have noted that nannies transplant their love for their own children into the children in which they take care of.  It is rare for the families of nannies to migrate to the First World with them.  Also, nannies do not often get to return home to visit their children—in some cases, every two or three years.  Nannies still try to stay in connection with their families, and the advancements of [[technology]] and [[communication]] have made this easier to do.&lt;ref name="Parrenas, Rhacel 2005"&gt;Parrenas, Rhacel. "Long Distance Intimacy: Class, Gender and Intergenerational Relations between Mothers and Children in Filipino Transnational Families." Global Networks. 5.4 (2005): 317-336. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most all migrant mothers are seen as "here and there" at the same time—[[Nurturant parent model|nurturing]] her children from another country.  Physical love is not present within the transnational family.  Mothers cannot nurture up close and the physical love is not allowed to be transferred from two different countries.&lt;ref name="Parrenas, Rhacel 2005"/&gt;  Cases have shown that many of the mothers transfer their physical love onto the children that they nanny.

[[Power (social and political)|Power]] shifts among Third World families when the mother leaves the country to find enhanced and better paying work.  The breadwinner holds the power within the family unit because they are the one that provides the family with (the most) monetary [[assets]].  The reason mothers of Third World countries are leaving their homes is due to the lack of well-paying jobs within their country—not only for women, but for men as well.

It is easier for mothers to move to First World countries to find work due to the increase in the need of child care and household work.  These jobs that the mothers are searching for are very well paid—much better than any job in Third World countries.  The women are leaving home, working at well-paid jobs, sending their wages back to their families in the Third World countries in the form of remittances, therefore becoming the member of the family that holds the most power—the power that is traditionally seen as masculine power, and the highest power (based on [[cultural]] [[ideology]]) being held by the 'man' in the family.

Most fathers lose their masculine power and the children can gain more power if more responsibility is placed on them in the nonappearance of their mothers.  The family should theoretically gain more power within their respected community due to the increase in wage earnings and newfound wealth due to the remittances sent by the mother—power in the sense of moving up of the [[social stratification]] &lt;ref&gt;Walkerdine, Valerie.

The families that outsource child care and home work are in [[Power (social and political)|power]] of their hired nanny.  Those that pay for a service hold most of the power in the [[Workplace relationships|employee-employer relationship]].  The mothers and fathers have power over the nanny's day-to-day schedule, along with her employment and pay (Zdravomyslova, 218).  The employers determine if the nanny is suitable for the job and if she can be trusted to occupy a place in their house and oversee the care of their child and house.  They are allowed to set up cameras inside the house in order to watch the nanny's actions and the care their child is receiving.

Employers can also be in communication with their nanny at any time during the day, allocating jobs for the nanny to do.&lt;ref name="Zdravomyslova, Elena 2010"&gt;Zdravomyslova, Elena. "Working Mothers and Nannies: Commercialization of Childcare and Modifications in the Gender Contract (A Sociological Essay)." Anthropology of East Europe Review [Online], 28.2 (2010): 200-225. Web. 7 Nov. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  The employers decide when the nanny works and does not work, the labor that the nanny is responsible for, when the nanny is allowed to return home, and the overall stability of the nanny's job.  Power is defined as control over the one that is hired in the sense of the employer-employee relationship between parents and their nannies &lt;ref name="Zdravomyslova, Elena 2010"/&gt;

All nannies hold power in the employee-employer relationship.  The nanny is in control of the child and its health and security, and she is the manager of the household while the employers are away.  This allows the nanny to have say in the [[Contractual term|conditions]] of her [[contract]] with the family.&lt;ref name="Zdravomyslova, Elena 2010"/&gt;  Most nannies and the children under their care, after time, create bonds and become attached to one another.  Some nannies use this attachment against the parents if their employment is at stake―parents not wanting to take away a stable relationship from their child, limiting the risk of [[Abandonment (emotional)|abandonment issues]] present in the child, and the feeling of guilt felt by the parents.&lt;ref&gt;Baquedano-López, Patricia, Ph.D. "A Stop at the End of the Bus Line: Nannies, Children, and the Language of Care."

==Manufacturing workers==

===Women in China (aka rural to urban migration)===
Young Chinese girls are sent to cities to work in factories, where they work for low wages, and often go unpaid for a large length of time.&lt;ref name="pbs.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/independentlens/chinablue/film.html|title= dir. China Blue|author=Peled, Micah|year= 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The documentary [[China Blue]] provides insight into the treatment of these young Chinese women and the conditions under which they live.&lt;ref name="pbs.org"/&gt; Many of the laborers are migrant workers that travel from the countryside to the city to find work, and as seen in China Blue, these workers are often underpaid, and face strict regulations in the city. The city provides legislation and/or policies stating that the factories must house them. By having dormitories onsite, the factory works like a small city. It provides food and shelter, and because the factory controls every part of the laborer's life, laborers can be forced to work late, and can be penalized for bad behavior, or not meeting their quotas.

According to Ngai, the dormitory system is also stressful on these migrant workers as it removes them from their families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ngai, Pun|year=2007|title=Gendering the dormitory labor system: production, reproduction, and migrant labor in south China|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13545700701439465#.UkAb94ZTAhE|journal=Feminist Economics|volume= 13|issue=3|pages=239–258|doi=10.1080/13545700701439465}}&lt;/ref&gt; Isolation and maltreatment in the form of cheap labor is how [[China]] competes globally. China forces its workers to work long hours, subsidizes their living expenses, while keeping their wages low.

===Burmese in Thailand===
Ruth Pearson discusses the millions of [[Women in Burma|Burmese women]] who migrate to [[Thailand]] each year. These women almost entirely make up the agricultural and manufacturing workforce.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The Burmese who migrate are typically undocumented, and there is very little regulation of the migration. The workers, more than half of which are women, are considered disposable, and face aggression from the Thai government and police force. The Thai manufacturing and agricultural businesses are far more dependent upon the Burmese migrants due to their low pay, and the amount of work that they can demand from them.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Pearson, Ruth; Kusakabe, Kyoko. ''Thailand's Hidden Workforce : Burmese Migrant Women Factory Workers.'' London: Zed Books, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== '''Migration within Africa''' ===
There has been an increase of female migration within [[Africa]]. Due to all the harsh conditions Africa withstands such as starvation, poverty, and disease, these have been some of the reasons to increase the need for work. In Africa there has also been in increase in high male unemployment, which has been a factor in the increase of women working more. &lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.caritas.org/includes/pdf/backgroundmigration.pdf|title=The Female Face of Migration|last=|first=|date=2009|website=Caritas Internationalis|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=28 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since women are working more and have become the main providers for their families, they go wherever there is work. They don't always go out of the country for work, sometimes they tend to [[Human migration|migrate]] within their country. The work that constantly has them moving from region to region is the agriculture and mineral deposits. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/international-migration-africa-analysis-based-estimates-migrant-stock|title=International Migration in Africa: An Analysis Based on Estimates of the Migrant Stock|last=Zlotnik|first=Hania|date=2004-09-01|work=migrationpolicy.org|access-date=2018-03-28|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there is work within their own country there are others that will migrate outside their region. Some places they migrate to are, but not limited to, areas in [[North America]] or even [[Europe]]. &lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; There are many jobs outside their country that they hear about that they are willing to travel to. A reason that has attracted African migrant workers to places outside their country is the demand for domestic work. &lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;   

==Care workers==
The most common work found by women migrant workers is in domestic care.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In Spain, 70% of all women migrants find jobs in this sector.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The increase in women migrants from Latin America is illustrated by the fact that 70% of Brazilian and Dominican migrant workers going to Spain in 2001 were women.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Domestic workers are employed by private households as nannies to care for the elderly or sick family members, or as maids that provide household services. The [[International Labour Organization]] (ILO) estimates that care workers are 8% more prevalent in developing countries than developed countries.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unwomen.org/2011/05/gender-and-migration-care-workers-at-the-interface-of-migration-and-development/|title=Gender and migration: Care Workers at the Interface of Migration and Development|author=Bachelet, Michelle|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many of these positions require that women remain with the families that hire them, which makes exploitation and abuse highly likely in these situations, given that the work is often unregulated, and there is no real way to track payment or living conditions. Furthering the issue, some of these care workers are illegally living in the United States and are undocumented.

De Parle shows through anecdote that a man from [[Manila]] was gone for twenty years to provide for his family.&lt;ref name="Parle"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://duygukorhan.com/articles/deparle.pdf|title=A Good Provider is One Who Leaves|author=de Parle, Jason|pages=50–74. New York Times Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; This man's family followed his example, and all five of his children became migrant workers. Migrant workers make about 10 times the amount of domestic wages. There is often a dramatic need that motivates these workers to move abroad. 1 in every 7 Filipinos is a migrant worker, and migrant workers are viewed as heroes as a result of their willingness to leave their families and send remittances from their pay. However, these remittances do not cover the social costs and familial costs that these workers face. For example, many children don’t recognize their parents, and grow up not knowing their closest family members. Though there are some protections for families, there is still the propensity for remittances and migrant work to have more of a negative impact on family dynamics. Though situations for children in terms of growth have improved, money is still not a replacement for their parent(s).

==Emigration from Sri Lanka==
It has become more common for women from Sri Lanka to immigrate to the Middle East to work as domestic servants. This migration forces those in the villages of Sri Lanka to create new gender [[norm (social)|norm]]s and [[ideal (ethics)|ideal]]s, going against cultural [[ideology]].

A few men reluctantly take over the work of women in their absence, and when possible, pawn this work off to female relatives. Reconstruction of gender roles occurs, creating uncomfortable situations for the men of the communities.&lt;ref name="Gamburd, Michele 2002"/&gt;  Men have the chance to take on different roles of which they themselves choose:
* Drinking in order to maintain a masculine identity and showcase wealth
* Find work
* Take on the work of the women

In Sri Lankan communities drinking of alcohol is seen as a masculine activity. Unemployed and underemployed men take to drinking in order to still be seen as masculine and to protect their identities within the social sphere of the community. Drinking is also a sign of wealth. Creation of male groups comes out of drinking—a group of men that wish to still be seen as masculine and instead show laziness and unwillingness to provide. Men that drink spend much of their wives' remittances, making her migration of little use financially to their families.&lt;ref name="Gamburd, Michele 2002"/&gt; Some men find work of their own in, and outside, of the communities. These men do not give up their entire [[role]] of breadwinner; yet earn less than their migrant wives. This man is still seen as taking on a masculine role and is still considered a 'man'.&lt;ref name="Gamburd, Michele 2002"/&gt;

Very few men take on the work of the women by taking care of the house, the preparation of food, and the care of their children. These men are looked down upon as 'not-men', therefore making them look as 'women'.  This work comes with the loss of the prestige of being a 'man' and doing 'men's work'.  This job is not paid and the men that do this job are not breadwinners. These men are taking on responsibility, unlike those that drink and do not work and only spend remittance money. However, they are seen as 'not-men' by others within the community. With the ability to be humbled and take on responsibility in order to provide, in other ways than the earning of money, these men are still looked down upon as [[Failure|failing]] to be a 'man'.&lt;ref name="Gamburd, Michele 2002"/&gt;

==Migration within East Asia==
Since the 1970s, the economic growth in [[East Asia]] has spurred workers to migrate from low-income Southeast Asian countries, like the [[Philippines]] and [[Indonesia]], to wealthier, but typically more crowded locations, like [[Hong Kong]], [[Singapore]] and [[Taiwan]], in search of employment.&lt;ref name=Lan/&gt; As a result of [[globalization]], women are migrating in large numbers and entering the domestic field of work, a phenomenon which scholars refer to as "the global nanny chain" or "the international division of reproductive labor".&lt;ref name=Lan/&gt;

[[File:Girl in Muyuan in Jiangxi.jpg|thumb|A woman from one of China's rural areas]]
Economic growth in China in particular has led many women from the rural areas of China to migrate to urban areas in search of employment.&lt;ref name=":1b"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=He|first=Canfei|last2=Gober|first2=Patricia|year=2003|title=Gendering Interprovincial Migration in China|journal=International Migration Review|volume=37|issue=4|pages=1220–1251}}&lt;/ref&gt; These women want to be a part of the push for the modernization of China,&lt;ref name=":2b"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Out to Work|last=Gaetano|first=Arianne|publisher=University of Hawai'i Press|year=2015|location=United States of America|pages=28–45|quote=|via=Open Edition}}&lt;/ref&gt; leaving behind the traditional practices of their rural families in favor of a chance to be a part of the modern age. This motivation, as well as the sense of duty they feel to help provide for their parents, is one of the most commonly cited reasons rural women decide to migrate to bigger cities.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In order to find jobs in China's bigger cities, like Shanghai, they rely on [[social network]]s.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; By connecting with family members or other villagers who have already left for the city, a wide range of jobs are available.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Rural women take up a wide variety of jobs, from [[Domestic worker|domestic]]&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; and factory work to owning their own businesses&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=AsiaFoundation|title=Empowering Migrant Women as Entrepreneurs in China|date=2015-09-09|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tIJU3rQFA4|accessdate=2016-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; to working as hostesses in China's popular [[Host and hostess clubs|karaoke bars]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These women usually spend their income on education for themselves or family members, sending any leftover money to the rest of the family that remains in the village.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Not all migrant workers come from poorer regions, however. In the Philippines, for example, workers often come from more economically [[developed]] regions.&lt;ref name="Lan" /&gt; [[Thailand]] has seen an increase in the migration of women from higher classes as well. Once practiced exclusively by the wealthy elite, the 1960s marked a time when [[middle-class]] [[Sino-Thai]] families began to increasingly send daughters overseas in pursuit of [[higher education]].&lt;ref name="Wilson"&gt;[[Ara Wilson|Wilson, Ara]].

==Consequences and aid==
Cheng states that there is an isolation of women who work abroad even within their own social circles.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This discourages support systems, and often puts these women in heightened vulnerable positions, placing more dependency on the family structure and household where they are employed. The first year's wages are used to secure their place in their new job, and from then onward the isolation in the household keeps the women obedient.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Cheng, SJ|year=1996|title= Migrant Women domestic workers in Hong Kong, Singapore and Taiwan: a comparative analysis|journal=Asian Pac Migr J|volume=5 |issue=1|pages=139–152|pmid=12291761}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Authors Tonya Basok and Nicola Piper discuss the global governance of international migration efforts undertaken by the non-governmental organizations trying to protect the rights of Latin Americans and those from the [[Caribbean]], moving to Europe.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; They argue that although the management of trafficking the women to and from their country of origin has improved, the management of labor rights abroad is difficult due to the lack of rights promotions as opposed to management efforts.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Basok, Tonya |author2=Nicola Piper |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2012|title=Management Versus Rights: Women's Migration and Global Governance in Latin America and the Caribbean|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13545701.2012.690525#.UkAePIZTAhE|journal= Feminist Economics|volume=18|issue=2|pages= 35–61|doi=10.1080/13545701.2012.690525}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women who leave their homes in search of work abroad often leave their duties to another member of the family, or even their children. It is often female children or another woman who assume responsibility for maternal duties, thereby further strengthening a gendered role of domestic work, and perpetuating traditional [[gender role]]s.

[[United Nations Development Fund for Women|UNIFEM]] (now UN Women) is a branch of the [[United Nations]] dedicated to the support and defense of women workers. As the advent of migrant work has become more prevalent among women, UNIFEM has had to help keep their rights protected. This includes establishing a human rights standard, timely payment, rest days, medical care, and housing investigation. UNIFEM has promoted several laws similar to the law on the Protection of Migrant Women in [[Indonesia]]. Their goal is to make a universal code of ethics and treatment for all those engaging in migration for work or other reasons.&lt;ref name="unifem.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unifem.org/gender_issues/women_poverty_economics/women_migrant_workers.html|title=Women migrant Workers|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131219051632/http://www.unifem.org/gender_issues/women_poverty_economics/women_migrant_workers.html|archivedate=December 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gender protections in migrant work have become a necessity, given the exploitation of migrant women and the propensity of [[sex trafficking]] once they arrive in their destination country. As many women in these positions are either involved in the sex trade or domestic care, they are prone to abuse.

===Remittances===
Economically, women enter the market to help support their family and their home in their native country. Women migrant laborers are often only skilled to work in factory or care work positions. The effect these migrant workers have on domestic and foreign economies varies, and there is too little data to make any conclusive argument regarding economic impact. However, impact can be seen through continued globalization, monetary exchange, and remittances by women.&lt;ref name="unwomen-eseasia.org"/&gt; "Remittances have had significant macro economic effects in several countries of origin in coping with trade deficits, reducing pressure on local currency, reducing external debt, etc." This means that a major source of capital for developing countries are the wages earned and sent home by these women.&lt;ref name="unfpa.org"/&gt; "Formal remittance transfers of some $150 billion were reported in 2004. Possibly twice this amount was transferred informally. These financial transfers are growing in significance. In many countries, they are larger than either development assistance or foreign direct investment."

Rosewarne argues that the lack of temporary migrant laws is a hindrance to the continual flow of remittances.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; As well as the families that receive them, countries' GDPs are becoming dependent on the flow of these remittances. However, there are various limitations. Women traditionally have a more difficult time finding temporary employment due to their lack of education and job availability, as well as laws to support them abroad.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Rosewarne, Stuart|year=2012|title=Temporary International Labor Migration and Development in South and Southeast Asia|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13545701.2012.696314#.UkAeyoZTAhE|journal= Feminist Economics|volume= 18|issue=2|pages=63–90|doi=10.1080/13545701.2012.696314}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Changing gender roles===
Throughout history, women have taken on the role of a caregiver, someone who stays at home to care for the children while maintaining housework. This role while still popular among many households, has begun to change across the globe as women are taking on more male positions in the home and workforce.This change in roles has been incredibly difficult for women. They have needed to adapt to a more male physical appearance and take on the characteristics of the opposite sex, as to be taken seriously in the workforce. This change in the appearance and attitude of women has caused a shift in the way women present themselves both at work and at home. Although recently, women have chosen to adopt an assertive lifestyle rather than taking on the appearance of males in attempt to keep their femininity while maintaining seriousness in the workforce.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bodylanguageexpert.co.uk/changinggenderroles.html|title=Changing Gender Roles|website=www.bodylanguageexpert.co.uk|access-date=2017-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some women migrate in order to escape oppressive gender roles, leaving their home and obtaining increased economic independence and freedom, which challenge traditional gender roles. This can strengthen a woman's position in the family by improving her relative bargaining position. Women have more leverage in controlling the household because they have control over a degree of economic assets, depending on their economic situation. Gender roles often follow women from their rural or domestic environment to the labor they are allowed to participate in. It can have a stratifying effect on their work and social life. Jie-Yu Lui states that social roles follow migrant workers in their new environments.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; There is a strong connection between a woman's role in her rural life to her new life in an urban city or foreign country. Women accept the treatment they receive because it is normalized by their traditional and domestic roles, e.g. their roles at home as homemaker and houseworker.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Liu, Jie-yu|year= 2007|title=Gender Dynamics and Redundancy in Urban China|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13545700701445322#.UkAe24ZTAhE|journal= Feminist Economics|volume= 13|issue=3-4|pages=125–158|doi=10.1080/13545700701445322}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beneria says that gender roles are ever-changing as women from Latin America are leaving their families there, and moving to be domestic care workers in Western Europe.&lt;ref name=WMW/&gt; Europeans create demand as they are focused on providing income, and have to balance their domestic duties with their market work. She uses the argument that a woman's choice to leave and provide remittances for her family initiates a role reversal for the family as a whole, in addition to a new gender category. Given that most migrant workers work in the care field, their traditional familial role is reinforced. Their absence from their homes may elicit resentful feelings from their children, but this is dependent on the presence of family. She closes by saying that the reconciliation policy is affected by the availability of migrant care workers who help balance the domestic and market work in more developed countries. If there are solutions that don't require policy changes, governments are prone to use these examples as reasons against such policy change. Additionally, there is a risk for infidelity abroad, which also erodes the family structure.&lt;ref name="Parle" /&gt;

===Extortion and abuse experienced by migrant workers===
Mistreatment of women migrant workers is primarily due to the fact that they tend to seek employment in the informal sector, and are therefore either not covered or partially covered by the labor legislation, social security, and welfare provisions of the host country.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|year=2008|title=Women and men migrant workers: Moving towards equal rights and opportunities|url=http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---dgreports/---gender/documents/publication/wcms_101118.pdf|journal=International Labour Organization (ILO)|volume=|pages=12|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exploitation of women migrant workers is less identifiable than exploitation of male migrant workers because exploitation occurs at a premature stage of the migration process or in situations with weak labor inspection services.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Examples of maltreatment include: not getting paid, restricted movement, removal of personal identity documents, long shifts, working for a whole week without days-off, sexual exploitation, and poor living conditions with inadequate food, water, and accommodation.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Women migrant workers are often mistreated and isolated by their employers, particularly in the Middle East.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Domestic workers experience this isolation, and become dependent upon their employers. They can be physically as well as psychologically abused. Dependency and work insecurity make extortion possible.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://publications.iom.int/bookstore/index.php?main_page=product_info&amp;cPath=7&amp;products_id=125|title=International Organization for Migration (IOM) 1995 Staff and Programme Policies on Gender Issues, adopted at the Seventy-first Session of the Council 2006 Breaking the Cycle of Vulnerability. Responding to the Health Needs of Trafficked Women in East and Southern Africa}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women are also raped and sexually harassed while abroad, and are vulnerable to sex trafficking.

===Care work deficit in country of origin===
With the trend of women migrant labor, the absence of women, mothers in particular, leaves a deficit in family life. When women leave to provide for their families, the role of mother or caretaker is left to the other female family members. These can be the eldest daughter, aunts, or even further extended family members. These kin help with domestic duties and child-rearing for the parent(s) abroad, but the absence of the parents sparks a trend and cycle within the family.

An '''écorché''' ({{IPA-fr|ekɔʁʃe}}) is a figure drawn, painted, or sculpted showing the muscles of the body without skin, normally as a [[figure study]] for another work or as an exercise for a student artist. The [[Renaissance art|Renaissance]]-era [[Renaissance architecture|architect]], theorist and all-around [[Renaissance man]], [[Leon Battista Alberti]], recommended that when painters intend to depict a [[Nude (art)|nude]], they should first arrange the muscles and bones, then depict the overlying skin.&lt;ref name="artlex"&gt;[http://www.artlex.com/ArtLex/E.html Écorché] defined at ArtLex.com&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the first well known [[Study (art)|studies]] of this kind were performed by [[Leonardo da Vinci]], who dissected [[cadavers]] and created detailed drawings of them. However, there are some accounts of this same practice taking place as far back as [[ancient Greece]], though the specifics are not known.

==Etymology==
The term ''écorché'', meaning literally "[[Flaying|flayed]]", came into usage via the French Academies (such as the [[École des Beaux Arts]]) in the 19th century.&lt;ref name="artlex" /&gt;

==History==
Although there are some accounts of practices similar to ''écorché'' as far back as [[ancient Greece]], the degree of similarity is unclear.{{cn|date=December 2017}} The term as used today can be applied with the greatest confidence to the [[Renaissance period]] onwards.

===Renaissance===
During the Renaissance in Italy, around the 1450 to 1600, the rebirth of classical Greek and Roman characteristics in art led to the studies of the human anatomy. The practice of dissecting the human body was banned for many centuries due to the belief that body and soul were inseparable. It wasn’t until the election of [[Pope Boniface VIII]] that the practice of dissection was once again allowed for observation.&lt;ref name="lemire m"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lemire|first=M|title=Representation of the human body: the colored wax anatomic models of the 18th and 19th centuries in the revival of medical instruction|journal=Surgical and Radiologic Anatomy|date=1 December 1992|volume=14|issue=4|pages=283–291|doi=10.1007/BF01794751|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2FBF01794751?LI=true|accessdate=3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="brain"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ginn|first=Sheryl R.|author2=Lorusso, Lorenzo|title=Brain, Mind, and Body: Interactions with Art in Renaissance Italy|journal=Journal of the History of the Neurosciences|date=16 July 2008 |volume=17|issue=3|pages=295–313|doi=10.1080/09647040701575900|pmid=18629698|url=http://resolver.scholarsportal.info/resolve/0964704x/v17i0003/295_bmabiwairi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many painters and artists documented and even performed the dissections themselves by taking careful observations of the human body. Among them were [[Leonardo da Vinci]] and [[Andreas Vesalius]], two of the most influential artists in [[anatomical illustrations]].&lt;ref name=specbook&gt;{{cite book|last=Wallace|first=Martin Kemp, Marina|title=Spectacular bodies : the art and science of the human body from Leonardo to now|year=2001|publisher=[[Hayward Gallery]]|location=London|isbn=0520227921|pages=22–90}}&lt;/ref&gt; Leonardo da Vinci, in particular, was very detailed in his studies that he was known as the “artist-anatomist” for the creation of a new science and the creative depiction to [[anatomy]].  Leonardo’s anatomical studies contributed to artistic exploration of the movement of the muscles, joints and bones. His goal was to analyze and understand the instruments behind the postures and gestures in the human body.&lt;ref name=leo&gt;{{cite journal|last=Keele|first=Kenneth D.|title=Leonardo Da Vinci's Influence on Renaissance Anatomy|journal=Medical History|date=October 1964|volume=8|issue=4|pages=360–370|doi=10.1017/s0025727300029835|pmid=14230140|pmc=1033412}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===17th – 19th centuries===
The study of anatomical figures became popular among the medical academies across Europe around the 17th and 18th century, especially when there was a lack of bodies available for dissections.&lt;ref name=specbook /&gt;  Medical students relied on these figures because they provided a good representation of what the anatomical model looks like. The ''écorché'' (flayed) figures were made to look like the skin was removed from the body, exposing the muscles and vessels of the model. Some figures were created to strip away the layers of muscles and reveal the skeleton of the model. Many of the life-size scale écorché figures were reproduced in a smaller scale out of bronze that could be easily distributed.&lt;ref name=healthcare&gt;{{cite journal|last=Owen|first=Harry|title=Early Use of Simulation in Medical Education|journal=[[Society for Simulation in Healthcare|Simulation in Healthcare: the Journal of the Society for Simulation in Healthcare]]|date=1 April 2012|volume=7|issue=2|pages=102–116|doi=10.1097/SIH.0b013e3182415a91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Écorché'' figures were commonly made out of many different materials: bronze, ivory, plaster, wax, or wood. By the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, wax was the most popular use of material in creating écorché statues. The production of colored wax anatomies allowed for a variety of hues and tone that makes the models appear realistic.&lt;ref name=anatomy&gt;{{cite journal|last=DARLINGTON|first=ANNE|title=The Teaching of Anatomy and the Royal Academy of Arts 1768-1782|journal=Journal of Art &amp; Design Education|date=1 December 1986|volume=5|issue=3|pages=263–271|doi=10.1111/j.1476-8070.1986.tb00207.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===21st century===
The ''écorché'' form of study still continues at traditional schools throughout the world including the [[New York Academy of Art]], the [[Art Students League of New York]], the [[Grand Central Academy of Art]] in New York City, the [[Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts]] in Philadelphia, and the [[Academy of Art University|Academy of Art University in San Francisco]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.academyart.edu/content/dam/assets/pdf/arc/handouts/FA-FASCU-JEM.pdf |title = Academy of Art University On Campus Labs |date = |accessdate = 23 November 2016 |website = academyart.edu |publisher = [[Academy of Art University]]|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
