* 7 April — [[Tinsley Lindley]] scores in his ninth consecutive [[England national football team|England]] game, a [[England national football team records|record]] that still stands.
'''Origin of the Football League'''
* One of the problems facing [[professionalism]] is the lack of competitive matches, especially for teams that have been knocked out of the [[FA Cup]].  It is self–evident that crowds for friendly fixtures are much lower, which means a reduction in revenue and consequent struggle to pay wages.
* [[Aston Villa]]'s Scottish director [[William McGregor (football)|William McGregor]] seeks a solution by asking other professional clubs to arrange annual home and away fixtures on a competitive basis, with points to be awarded for winning and drawing.  Following a conference between club directors on 23 March, the English [[Football League]] is founded on 17 April as one division of twelve clubs.
* The founder members are: [[Accrington F.C.]] (1888–1893), [[Aston Villa]], [[Blackburn Rovers]], [[Bolton Wanderers]], [[Burnley F.C.|Burnley]], [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]], [[Everton F.C.|Everton]], [[Notts County]], [[Preston North End]], [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke F.C.]], [[West Bromwich Albion]] and [[Wolverhampton Wanderers]].
'''India'''
* [[Durand Cup]] instituted by [[Mortimer Durand]] as recreation for British troops stationed in India. It is the oldest tournament in India and the third oldest in the world.
'''Scotland'''
* [[Scottish Cup final]] – [[Renton F.C.|Renton]] 6–1 [[Cambuslang F.C.|Cambuslang]] 
* [[Celtic Football Club]] is founded by members of the Marist Order, a teaching institute, as a way of raising money for a poor children's charity.  The club's first ground is a piece of rented land not far from the present [[Celtic Park]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2913">'''Belt-sander racing''' is the practice of racing [[belt sander]]s competitively. Belt sanders were one of the first power tools used in the growing field of power tool [[drag racing]]{{cn|date=September 2013}} wherein a pair of stock or modified belt sanders are placed in parallel wooden channels and fitted with long [[extension cord]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/02/03/technology/screen-grab-a-sport-for-purists-belt-sander-races.html | title=A Sport for Purists: Belt-Sander Races | publisher=New York Times | date=February 3, 2000 | accessdate=June 24, 2012 | author=Pollak, Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each heat begins when a common switch or individual switches triggered by the racers energizes them, causing the sanders to race towards the end of the track spitting wood dust along the way.  Both stock sanders  and modified sanders race down a {{convert|75|foot}} long track. Sanders of all shapes and sizes can go very fast, or very slow depending on the power of the motor.  The fastest time on a 75-foot track was 2.2103 seconds recorded by Dudley Harper's Sudden Death Racer of San Marcos, Texas.  Sudden Death raced on that date at the Legends Raceway in Rockport, Texas.  The peak velocity of that belt sander at the finish line was in the range of {{convert|50|–|60|mph}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = SoTex Belt Sander Racing Association|url = https://www.facebook.com/SoTexBeltSanderRacingAssociation|website = www.facebook.com|accessdate = 2015-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fundraising ==
For more than two decades, Bertie's Inn in Reading, Pennsylvania has held a fundraiser called Bertie's Inn Belt Sander Race.  Riders sit on and race hand-held belt sanders on a 40-foot-long plywood track.  All team entry fees ($50), food sales and T-shirts sales are donated to the [[National Multiple Sclerosis Society]].  Their most recent race was July 16, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bertiesinn.com/beltsanderrace.html|title=Bertie's Belt Sander Race|last=Thomas|first=William P.|website=www.bertiesinn.com|access-date=2018-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalmssociety.org/chapters/pae/fundraising-events/community-fundraisers/berties-belt-sander-race/index.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-03-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130925124928/http://www.nationalmssociety.org/chapters/pae/fundraising-events/community-fundraisers/berties-belt-sander-race/index.aspx |archivedate=2013-09-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www2.readingeagle.com/article.aspx?id=395378|title=Belt-sander race to benefit Multiple Sclerosis Society|website=Reading Eagle|access-date=2018-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www2.readingeagle.com/article.aspx?id=493027|title=Riding sanders a blast at charity event|website=Reading Eagle|access-date=2018-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Chinese motorcycle Grand Prix''' was a motorcycling event that was part of the [[Grand Prix motorcycle racing|World Motorcycle Racing]] season, from 2005 until 2008.

The Chinese grand prix was scheduled to run until 2011, but a low amount of spectator attendance, poor promotion and a lack of commercial interest caused the race to be scrapped from the 2009 calendar onwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.crash.net/motogp/news/77451/1/china-not-close-to-breaking-even|title=China 'not close' to breaking even.|date=17 May 2006|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.motorcyclenews.com/sport/motogp/2008/may/may0608motogpchinaaxesaddensvalentinorossiandcaseystoner/|title=MotoGP: China axe saddens Valentino Rossi and Casey Stoner|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Concord Oval''' (also '''Waratah Stadium''') is a [[Rugby football|rugby]] [[stadium]] in [[Concord, New South Wales|Concord]], [[Australia]], in the inner west of Sydney. It is currently used mostly for [[rugby union]] matches, and it was used for eight matches during the [[1987 Rugby World Cup]]. It also hosts [[football]] matches. The stadium is able to hold 20,000 people and was opened in 1985.

It is the home ground of [[West Harbour RFC]] in the [[Shute Shield]] rugby union competition, and the [[Greater Sydney Rams]] in the [[National Rugby Championship]]. It is also the training and administration base for the [[Wests Tigers]] rugby league club. [[Football]] club [[Inter Lions SC]] also play games at the ground.

==Facilities==

The stadium has two opposing grandstands. The eastern stand hosts the tennis box-style seats, television gantry and the change rooms. The stand runs approximately from try-line to try-line. The western stand contains a gym and some boxes. This stand runs approximately from dead-ball line to dead ball line. In front of the western stand are two rows of seats, while a concrete path runs around the field (except not in front of the aforementioned two rows of seats, the path runs behind those seats). At each end there is a grassy hill, and at the southern or Parramatta Road end, there is a wooden, manually operated scoreboard with an analogue clock.

The stadium is bordered by Gipps Street to the north, [[Great Western Highway|Parramatta Road]] to the south, Loftus Street to the west and the Cintra Hockey Centre to the east. Parking is at a premium with small carparks behind the northern hill, eastern stand and in the south-east corner, although [[Burwood railway station, Sydney|Burwood train station]] is not too far away, and the 439, L39, 464 and 466 bus routes pass close to the stadium.

==History==
St Luke's Park, which was the home ground of Sydney's [[Western Suburbs Magpies]] [[rugby league]] club in [[1910 NSWRFL season|1910]] and [[1911 NSWRFL season|1911]] was where Concord Oval is now located.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=westsmagpies.com.au|title=Home Grounds|url=http://www.westsmagpies.com.au/archives/000/php/venues.php|work=Wests Archives|publisher=[[Western Suburbs Magpies]]|accessdate=19 February 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140127020820/http://www.westsmagpies.com.au/archives/000/php/venues.php|archivedate=27 January 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wests started playing their matches at [[Pratten Park]] in 1912, but after pressure from local residents there the council refused the club permission to use that ground, forcing them to return to St. Luke's Oval from 1915 to 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=[[Ashfield Municipal Council]]|title=Pratten Park Plan of Management|date=2008|publisher=ashfield.nsw.gov.au|location=Australia|pages=6–7|url=http://www.ashfield.nsw.gov.au/files/recreation/parks_and_reserves/plans_of_management/pom_-_pratten__park_-_april_2008.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1920 Wests resumed playing at Pratten Park.

The stadium also hosted four first grade [[rugby league]] matches, three of them in 1994 as [[Bulldogs Rugby League Football Club|Canterbury's]] second home ground during that season.

As far as high-profile events go, the stadium currently lies dormant. With the completion of the [[Sydney Football Stadium]], and later [[Stadium Australia]], the [[New South Wales Waratahs]] and [[Australia national rugby union team|Australian Wallabies]] have not played at the stadium in many years. A return is unlikely, especially considering how expansion is almost impossible due to housing to the west, roads to the north and south, and a hockey complex and canal to the east. Other issues are that the stadium does not have floodlights, a video screen, parking or modern spectator amenities.

In the early 2010s the City of Canada Bay Council prepared a masterplan &lt;ref&gt;http://www.lpma.nsw.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0011/171785/Concord_Oval_draft_POM_for_public_exhibition_May_2012_version.pdf{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; to bring these events back to an expanded and rejuvenated Concord Oval. This includes construction and installation of broadcasting equipment such as satellite dishes, antennas, camera platforms and commentary boxes, as well as training quality floodlighting and a new scoreboard. Mention is made in the masterplan of attempting to lure [[Asian Football Confederation]] games to the renovated ground, however the masterplan may take up to a decade to complete. For the mean time, most events in the area prefer grounds such as [[Parramatta Stadium]], or the Olympic Park and Moore Park venues.

==Rugby World Cup==
Concord Oval hosted six matches of the [[1987 Rugby World Cup|1987]] [[Rugby World Cup]].

'''FPS''' (full name: '''Forssan Palloseura''') is a [[Finland|Finnish]] [[ice hockey]] team based in [[Forssa Ice Hall]] (capacity 3000), [[Forssa]], established in [[1931 in sports|1931]]. Forssan Palloseura has two lower level teams: FoPS which plays in lower divisions and FoPS Flames which plays in the [[2. Divisioona]] league.

FoPS Flames gained some negative news after former [[SM-liiga]] and Forssan Palloseura [[defenceman]] [[Timo Willman]] assaulted an opposing player during a [[3. Divisioona|3rd Division]] game in 2007.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

Most famous FPS figures are former NHL-coach [[Alpo Suhonen]] and player [[Mika Helkearo]] who are nicknamed the "[[Mestis|Divarin]] [[Wayne Gretzky|Gretzky]]" (Gretzky of the [[Mestis|1st Division]]) from his virtually unbreakable [[Mestis]] records in games, assists and points.

The '''History of the South Africa national rugby union team''' dates back to 1891, when the British Lions first toured South Africa where they played against South African representative sides. The [[South Africa national rugby union team]] played few international matches during a period of international sanctions due to apartheid. Since the end of apartheid in 1990–91, South Africa has once again fully participated in international rugby.

The most iconic moment in South Africa rugby history is when South Africa hosted and won the [[1995 Rugby World Cup]], with Nelson Mandela presenting the trophy to the team. South Africa also won the [[2007 Rugby World Cup]].

[[File:South africa v british isles.jpg|thumb|right|The South Africa team that played the second test v the [[British and Irish Lions|British Isles]] in 1891]]
The first [[1891 British Lions tour to South Africa|British Isles tour]] took place in 1891, with the trip financially underwritten by [[Cape Colony]] Prime Minister [[Cecil Rhodes]].&lt;ref name="1891Lions"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.lionsrugby.com/history/5024.php |title=1891 South Africa |publisher=lionsrugby.com |accessdate=19 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were the first representative games played by South African sides, who were still learning the game. The tourists played and won a total of twenty matches, conceding only one point in the process.&lt;ref name="1891TourMatches"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.lionsrugby.com/results.cfm?TourID=34 |title=TOUR: 1891 South Africa |publisher=Lionsrugby.com |accessdate=26 April 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061022065914/http://www.lionsrugby.com/results.cfm?TourID=34 |archivedate = 22 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; South Africa's first Tests were played, although South Africa did not exist as political unit until 1910. In a notable event of the tour, the British side presented the [[Currie Cup]] to [[Griquas (rugby)|Griqualand West]], the province they thought produced the best performance on the tour.&lt;ref name="CurrieCupHistory"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.planet-rugby.com/Story/0,18259,3844_1733706,00.html |title=Currie Cup: The History |publisher=planet-rugby.com |date=21 August 2001 |accessdate=17 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The British Isles' success continued on their 21-game tour of [[1896 British Lions tour to South Africa|1896]]. The British Isles won three out of the four Tests against South Africa. South Africa's play improved markedly from 1891. Their forwards were particularly impressive, and their first Test win in the final game was a pointer to the future.&lt;ref name="1896Tour"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.lionsrugby.com/history/5025.php |title=1896 – South Africa |publisher=lionsrugby.com |accessdate=26 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Allen174"&gt;Allen (2007), pg 174&lt;/ref&gt; For the first time South Africa had worn myrtle green shirts, which their captain, Barry Heatlie, borrowed from his Old Diocesans club. Rugby was given a huge boost by the early Lions tours, which created great interest in the South African press.&lt;ref name="Nauright40"&gt;Nauright (1997), pg 40&lt;/ref&gt;

Rugby was so popular that in 1902 there was a temporary ceasefire in the [[Second Boer War]] so that a game could be played between British and Boer forces.&lt;ref name="Parker5"&gt;Parker (2009), pg 5. Accepted proof from a letter from Field General S.G. Maritz of Transvaal Scouting Corps. to a Major Edwards dated 28 April 1902 informing of an agreed cease-fire from noon until sunset on 29 April to allow a game of rugby union to take place. The original letter is kept at the South Africa Rugby Board Museum.&lt;/ref&gt; The game had spread among the Afrikaner population through [[Prisoner of war|POW]] games during the Boer War,&lt;ref name="Van Der Merwe"&gt;Van Der Merwe (1992).&lt;/ref&gt; and afterwards [[Stellenbosch University]] became a training ground for future players and administrators.&lt;ref name="MightyBoks"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_union/5388786.stm |title=Mighty Boks: South African rugby |publisher=bbc.co.uk  |last=Davies |first=Sean |accessdate=11 October 2007 |date=28 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1903 the British Isles lost [[1903 British Lions tour to South Africa|a series for the first time]] in South Africa, drawing the opening two Tests before losing the last 8–0. In all, the tourists won just 11 of their 22 tour games.&lt;ref name="Allen177"&gt;Allen (2007), pg 177&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="1903Tour"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.lionsrugby.com/history/5027.php |title=1903 – South Africa |publisher=lionsrugby.com |accessdate=26 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, South Africa would not lose another series—home or away—until 1956.&lt;ref name="MightyBoks"/&gt;

==Springboks==

[[File:Paul-Roos,-Springbok-.jpg|thumb|right|170px|[[Paul Roos (rugby player)|Paul Roos]], Springbok captain of the team that toured the British Isles in 1906.]]
[[Paul Roos (rugby player)|Paul Roos]] was the captain of the first South African team to tour the [[1906 South Africa rugby union tour|British Isles and France]]. The team was largely dominated by players from Western Province, and the tour took place during 1906–07. The team played 29 matches; including Tests against all four [[Home Nations]]. England managed a draw, but Scotland was the only one of the Home unions to gain a victory.&lt;ref name="Allen182"&gt;Allen (2007), pg 182&lt;/ref&gt;

During this tour the nickname ''Springboks'' was first used. There is often confusion as to the springbok symbol being worn before the name was invented, but this may be down to the fact the tour manager, J.C. Carden, spoke of having no 'uniforms or blazers' with the icon, though he did not appear to mean the jerseys. It was reported in the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' on 20 September 1906, seven days before the first match, that 'The team's colours will be myrtle green with gold collar... and will have embroidered in mouse-coloured silk on the left breast a Springbok'.&lt;ref name="Parker32"&gt;Parker (2009), pg 32&lt;/ref&gt; Carden later stated:

{{cquote|...No uniforms or blazers had been provided... That night I spoke to Roos and Carolin and pointed out that the witty London Press would invent some funny name for us if we did not invent one ourselves. We thereupon agreed to call ourselves Springboks and to tell Pressmen that we desired to be so named. I remember this distinctly, for Paul (Roos) reminded us that "Springbokken" was the correct plural. However, the ''Daily Mail'', after our first practice, called us the Springboks and the name stuck. I at once ordered the dark green, gold-edged blazers...&lt;ref name="Parker32"/&gt;}}

[[File:Southafrica rugby team 1906.jpg|thumb|left|250px|right|The 1906 Springboks team.]]
Newspaper reporters were to call the team "De Springbokken", and later the ''Daily Mail'' printed an article referring to the "Springboks".&lt;ref name="DeSpringbokken"&gt;{{cite news|title=Bafana Bafana need to put a sting in their tale |url=http://www.businessday.co.za/specialist/articles/AgonyRant.aspx?ID=BD4A599988 |publisher=businessday.co.za |last=Eberl |first=Nikolaus |date=30 October 2007 |accessdate=26 April 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081118113851/http://www.businessday.co.za/specialist/articles/AgonyRant.aspx?ID=BD4A599988 |archivedate=18 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The team thereafter wore blazers with a springbok on the left breast pocket.&lt;ref name="EmblemChanged" /&gt; Research in 1992 showed that the design for a Springbok head which was used on the cap as well as the jumping Springbok for use on the jersey and blazer was designed by a German-born artist Heinrich Egersdörfer, living at the time in [[Woodstock, Cape Town]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Van der Schyff|first=P.F.|title=Heinrich Egersdörfer – unsung first designer of South Africa's national sporting emblem, the Springbok|journal=Pretoriana – Journal of the Old Pretoria Society|date=March 1993|volume=102–105|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically the term 'Springbok' was applied to any team or individual representing South Africa in international competition regardless of sporting discipline. This tradition was abandoned with the advent of South Africa's new democratic government in 1994.&lt;ref name="EmblemChanged"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.iht.com/articles/1995/11/14/ian.t.php |title=World Champions Face Next Test: Springboks Blossom, Flowers of a New Land |work=International Herald Tribune |accessdate=26 April 2008 |date=14 November 1995 |last=Thomsen |first=Ian |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080605172931/http://www.iht.com/articles/1995/11/14/ian.t.php |archivedate = 5 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The trip helped heal wounds after the Boer War and instilled a sense of national pride among South Africans.&lt;ref name="MightyBoks"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Allen183"&gt;Allen (2007), pg 183&lt;/ref&gt;

The South Africans crossed the channel to play an unofficial match against a 'France' team drawn from the two Parisian clubs: [[Stade Français]] and [[Racing Métro 92 Paris|Racing Club de France]]. The official French team were in England at the time. The Springboks won 55–6 and scored 13 tries in the process.&lt;ref name="France1907a"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rugby-pioneers.blogs.com/rugby/2007/10/index.html |title=Springboks in Paris 1907–2007... part II |publisher=rugby-pioneers.blogs.com |accessdate=26 April 2008 |date=26 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="France1907Article"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/rugby_pioneers/877682984/sizes/l/ |title=Africanders Contre Francois |publisher=Sports Universel Illustrés |language=French |date=January 1907 |accessdate=26 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[1910 British Lions tour to South Africa|1910 British Isles tour of South Africa]] was the first to include representatives from all four Home unions. The team performed moderately against the non-test parties, claiming victories in just over half their matches. The tourists won just one of their three Tests.&lt;ref name="1910Lions"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lionsrugby.com/1910.htm |title=1910 – South Africa |publisher=lionsrugby.com |accessdate=26 April 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130403095437/http://www.lionsrugby.com/1910.htm |archivedate=3 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Boks' [[1912–13 South Africa rugby union tour|second European tour]] took place in 1912–13. They beat the four [[Home nation]]s to earn their first [[Grand Slam (rugby union)|Grand Slam]] and also went on to defeat France.&lt;ref name="MightyBoks"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GrandSlams"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/rugby_union/international/3984061.stm |title=History favours Springbok slam |publisher=bbc.co.uk  |accessdate=26 April 2008 |date=4 November 2004 |last=Standley |first=James}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inter war==

[[File:South Africa rugby union team against New Zealand, 1921.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The Springboks team that faced [[New Zealand national rugby union team|New Zealand]] in 1921.]]
By the first World War New Zealand and South Africa had established themselves as rugby's two greatest powers.&lt;ref name="GreatPowers"&gt;The [[All Blacks]] had first played Test rugby in 1903, and toured the British Isles in 1905. By 1921 they had won 19 Tests, drawn two and lost three.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Harding16"&gt;Harding (2000) pg 16&lt;/ref&gt; A New Zealand Army match tour of South Africa in 1919 paved the way for [[1921 South Africa rugby union tour of Australia and New Zealand|a Springbok tour to New Zealand and Australia in 1921]]. The tour was billed as "The World Championship of Rugby".&lt;ref name="Zavos1997"&gt;{{cite news| title=The Passion That Keeps An Old Rivalry Burning |work=Sydney Morning Herald |last=Zavos |first=Spiro |page=52 |date=9 August 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; The All Blacks won the first Test 13–5, which included a try by All Blacks [[Wing (rugby union)|wing]]er [[Jack Steel]] who had sprinted 50 metres with the ball trapped between his right hand and back to score.&lt;ref name="Harding18"&gt;Harding (2000), pg 18&lt;/ref&gt; The Springboks recovered to win the second Test 9–5 thanks to a [[Gerhard Morkel]] drop-goal.&lt;ref name="Harding18"/&gt; The final Test was drawn 0–0 after being played in terrible conditions—resulting in a series draw.&lt;ref name="Harding20"&gt;Harding (2000), pg 20–21&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[1924 British Lions tour to South Africa|1924 British and Irish Lions team to South Africa]] struggled with injuries and won only nine of 21 games. They lost three Tests to the Springboks,drew one, but despite the results, the tour produced some attractive rugby.&lt;ref name="BBC1924Lions"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/rugby_union/international/4361709.stm |publisher=bbc.co.uk  |title=Early history of the Lions |date=18 May 2005 |last=Davies |first=Sean |accessdate=30 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="1924Lions"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.lionsrugby.com/1924.htm |title=1924 – South Africa |publisher=lionsrugby.com |accessdate=14 February 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927200809/http://www.lionsrugby.com/1924.htm |archivedate = 27 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first side to pick up the name Lions,&lt;ref&gt;They were known as 'British Isles Rugby Union Team'—an official name that stayed with them into the 1950s.&lt;/ref&gt; apparently picked up from the Lions embroidered on their ties.&lt;ref name="PlanetLionsHist"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.planet-rugby.com/Story/0,18259,3837_1730556,00.html |title=The Lions History – Part 1 |date=24 May 2001 |accessdate=30 April 2008 |publisher=planet-rugby.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[1928 New Zealand rugby union tour of South Africa|All Blacks first toured South Africa in 1928]], and again the Test series finished level. Despite playing most of the second half with only 14 men, with a dominant scrum and fly-half [[Bennie Osler]], the Springboks won the first Test 17–0 to inflict the All Blacks' heaviest defeat since 1893.&lt;ref name="Harding23"&gt;Harding (2000), pg 23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Harding25"&gt;Harding (2000), pg 25&lt;/ref&gt; The All Blacks rebounded to win the second Test 7–6. After a Springbok win in the third Test, the Springboks needed to win the fourth to secure a series victory. The New Zealanders bought back [[Mark Nicholls (rugby player)|Mark Nicholls]] for his only Test of the series,&lt;ref name="Harding28"&gt;Harding (2000), pg 28&lt;/ref&gt; and their captain [[Maurice Brownlie]] told the team a week before the Test that "Under no circumstances whatever is anyone of you so much as to touch a rugby ball until we play the Springboks in the last test."&lt;ref name="McLean162"&gt;McLean (1987), pg 162&lt;/ref&gt; Their tactics were successful and the All Blacks won 13–5 to draw the series.&lt;ref name="Harding28"/&gt;

Despite winning South Africa's second Grand Slam, the [[1931–32 South Africa rugby union tour|Springbok tourists of 1931–32]] were an unloved team. They had a jumbo pack and a kicking fly-half in captain [[Bennie Osler]]. Their tactics of kicking for territory earned them criticism both in South Africa and abroad.&lt;ref name="SixGS"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://tvnz.co.nz/view/sport_story_skin/631712 |title=Six Grand Slam successes |date=24 November 2005 |publisher=tvnz.co.nz |accessdate=2 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RugbyGuide"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://sport.scotsman.com/guidetoscottishrugby/Rugbys-great-leap-forward.2396913.jp |title=Rugby's great leap forward |last=Massie |first=Allan |date=27 January 2003 |accessdate=2 May 2008 |work=The Scotsman |location=UK }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was successful however, the team winning against England, Ireland, Scotland and Wales, as well as defeating all their Welsh opponents for the first time.&lt;ref name="DragonsSpringboks"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wru.co.uk/15264_15284.php|title=Dragons &amp; Springboks: The first 100 years|accessdate=2 May 2008|publisher=wru.co.uk|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080417020616/http://www.wru.co.uk/15264_15284.php|archivedate=17 April 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1933, [[Wallabies (rugby union)|Wallabies]] made [[1933 Australia rugby union tour of South Africa and Rhodesia|a tour in South Africa]], After five match, Springboks won the series against Australian (3–2), confirmed themself as the strongest team in the world.

[[File:1937 span 011.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The complete squad that toured [[1937 Springbok tour to Australasia|New Zealand and Australia]] in 1937.]]
In 1937 South Africa toured [[1937 Springbok tour to Australasia|New Zealand and Australia]] and broke the deadlock with a series win in New Zealand. Their 2–1 series win prompted them to be called "the best team to ever leave New Zealand".&lt;ref name="1956Springboks"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rugbymuseum.co.nz/asp/container_pages/normal_menu/rmArticle.asp?IDID=152 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120605005815/http://www.rugbymuseum.co.nz/asp/container_pages/normal_menu/rmArticle.asp?IDID=152 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=5 June 2012 |title=THE 1956 SPRINGBOK TOUR |publisher=rugbymuseum.co.nz |accessdate=27 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the All Blacks winning the first Test, the Springboks' won in the third Test 17–6 and scored five tries to none.&lt;ref name="McLean194"&gt;McLean (1987), pg 194&lt;/ref&gt; The All Blacks' loss was considered a humiliation in New Zealand.&lt;ref name="McLean194"/&gt;

The [[1938 British Lions tour to South Africa|British Isles toured South Africa again in 1938]], winning the majority of their tour matches. However, the Springboks secured easy victories in the first two tests, winning 26–12 and 19–3. However, the Lions bounced back to record a 21–16 win in the third test, which was the first Lions win on South Africa soil since 1910.&lt;ref name="1938Lions"&gt;{{cite web| title=1938 – South Africa |url=http://www.lionsrugby.com/1938.htm |publisher=lionsrugby.com |accessdate=14 February 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927200736/http://www.lionsrugby.com/1938.htm |archivedate = 27 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-war era==

[[Danie Craven]] was appointed coach in '''1949''', and started his coaching career with a bang. The Springboks won ten matches in a row, including a 4–0 whitewash of New Zealand on their [[1949 New Zealand rugby union tour of South Africa|1949 tour to South Africa]].&lt;ref name="Harding42"&gt;Harding (2000), pg 42&lt;/ref&gt; Prop Okey Geffin helped kick the Springboks to victory—they won all four Tests despite the All Blacks scoring more tries in three of them.&lt;ref name="Harding46"&gt;Harding (2000), pg 46&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Harding50"&gt;Harding (2000), pg 50&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''1951–52''' [[1951–52 South Africa rugby union tour|team that toured Europe]] was considered amongst the finest Springbok sides to tour.&lt;ref name="GrandSlams"/&gt; The team won the Grand Slam as well as defeating France. [[Hennie Muller]] captained the side after original captain [[Basil Kenyon]] suffered a serious eye injury. The South African highlight of the tour was a 44–0 defeat of Scotland.&lt;ref name="SixGS"/&gt; The defeat of Scotland included nine tries, and was a record at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Under the modern scoring system it would have been a 62–0 defeat.&lt;/ref&gt; The team finished with only one loss, to London Counties, from 31 matches.&lt;ref name="BattlingYears"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://sport.scotsman.com/guidetoscottishrugby/The-Battling-Years.2397247.jp |title=The Battling Years |date=28 January 2003 |accessdate=14 May 2008 |last=Massie |first=Allan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In '''1953''', [[1953 Australia rugby union tour of South Africa and Rhodesia|Australia toured South Africa]] for the second time and although they lost the series they were given a standing ovation after defeating South Africa 18–14 in a thrilling 2nd Test at Newlands. Wallaby Captain John Solomon was chaired off the field by two South African players. This was the first Springbok defeat for 15 years.
During their '''1955''' [[1955 British Lions tour to South Africa|tour to South Africa]], the Lions won 19 and drew one from the 25 fixtures. The four-test series ended in a draw.

In '''1956''', Springboks [[1956 South Africa rugby union tour of Australia and New Zealand|toured Australasia]] the All Blacks won its first series over the Springboks, in what Chris Hewett called "in the most bitterly fought series in history."&lt;ref name="Hewitt1905"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/rugby/rugby-union/the-all-blacks-100-years-of-attitude-513716.html |title=The All Blacks: 100 years of attitude |work=The Independent |location=UK |last=Hewitt |first=Chris |accessdate=27 April 2008 |date=3 November 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Surprise selection [[Don Clarke]] from [[Waikato Rugby Union|Waikato]]—nicknamed ''the Boot''—kicked the decisive penalties in the final Tests.&lt;ref name="DonClarke"&gt;{{All Blacks|151|Don Clarke}}&lt;/ref&gt;

South Africa had defeated France 25–3 at [[Colombes Stadium]] in 1952, and when [[1958 France rugby union tour of South Africa|France toured South Africa]] in '''1958''' they were not expected to compete.&lt;ref name="Potter83"&gt;Potter (1961), pg 83&lt;/ref&gt; Georges Duthen described the mood of the French players before their first Test in 1958: "They were going into battle. A Battle for France. And they hadn't a hope..."&lt;ref name="Potter83"/&gt; France exceeded expectations and drew 3–3 with after a drop goal to French [[Scrum-half (rugby union)|scrum-half]] Pierre Danos and unconverted try to South Africa's Butch Lochner.&lt;ref name="Potter84"&gt;Potter (1961), pg 84. Note that in today's scoring system, the same scores would have resulted in a 5–3 Springboks win&lt;/ref&gt; The French then secured a Test series victory in South Africa with their 9–5 victory in front of 90,000 spectators in Johannesburg.&lt;ref name="Potter85"&gt;Potter (1961), pg 85&lt;/ref&gt; The French feared the South African forwards, especially their scrum, and focused much of their training before the series on improving the "South African" style of their forwards.&lt;ref name="Potter91"&gt;Potter (1961), pg 91&lt;/ref&gt; The decisive moment of the match was French forward Jean Barthe's tackle on [[Jan Prinsloo]] near the French try-line prevented a certain try. The momentum then swung to France who scored drop-goals—one each to Pierre Lacaze and Roger Martine—to secure the historic victory.&lt;ref name="Potter106"&gt;Potter (1961), pg 106&lt;/ref&gt;

==1960s==

Even before the [[apartheid]] laws were passed after 1948, sporting teams going to South Africa had felt it necessary to exclude non-white players. New Zealand rugby teams in particular had done this, and the exclusion of [[George Nepia]] and [[Jimmy Mill]] from the 1928 All Blacks tour,&lt;ref name="JimmyMill"&gt;{{All Blacks|612|Jimmy Mill}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Harding31"&gt;Harding (2000), pg 31&lt;/ref&gt; and the dropping of [[Ranji Wilson]] from the New Zealand Army team nine years before that,&lt;ref name="RanjiWilson"&gt;{{All Blacks|974|Ranji Wilson}}&lt;/ref&gt; had attracted little comment at the time. However, in '''1960''' international criticism of apartheid grew in the wake of ''[[Wind of Change (speech)|The Wind of Change]]'' speech and the [[Sharpeville massacre]].&lt;ref name="Harding73"&gt;Harding (2000), pg 73&lt;/ref&gt;

From this point onward, the Springboks were increasingly the target of international controversy and protest. The [[1960 New Zealand rugby union tour of Australia and South Africa|All Blacks toured in 1960]] without their Maori players, who were excluded at the insistence of South Africa. This was controversial in New Zealand, with a "No Maoris, No Tour" campaign and a 150,000 signature petition opposing it.&lt;ref name="NoMaoriNoTour"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/media/photo/no-maoris-no-tour-poster |title='No Maoris – No Tour' poster, 1960 |publisher=Ministry for Culture and Heritage |date=10 September 2007 |accessdate=18 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Springboks avenged their 1956 series defeat by winning the Test series 2–1 with a Test drawn.&lt;ref name="Harding65"&gt;Harding (2000), pg 65&lt;/ref&gt; The first match was won 13–0 by the Springboks with two tries to [[Hennie van Zyl]].&lt;ref name="Harding67"&gt;Harding (2000), pg 67&lt;/ref&gt; New Zealand journalist Noel Holmes said after the match "I hang my head in shame for having suggested that your forwards might be slow, even unfit."&lt;ref name="Harding69"&gt;Harding (2000), pg 69&lt;/ref&gt; The All Blacks won the second Test 11–3 which they did so with a dominant forward pack and the tactical kicking of Don Clarke.&lt;ref name="Harding69"/&gt; The players selected for the third and fourth Tests formed the core of Springboks side for the next three seasons.&lt;ref name="Harding70"&gt;Harding (2000), pg 70&lt;/ref&gt; The third Test was drawn 11–11 after a last minute sideline conversion from All Black Don Clarke.&lt;ref name="DonClarke"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Harding71"&gt;Harding (2000), pg 71&lt;/ref&gt; The deciding Test was won 8–3 by the Springboks with the decisive try scored by [[Martin Pelser]].&lt;ref name="Harding72"&gt;Harding (2000), pg 72&lt;/ref&gt;

Later that same year the [[1960–61 South Africa rugby union tour of Europe|Springboks themselves toured]], and led by Avril Malan they defeated all four Home unions for their fourth Grand Slam. On a four-month, 34 game sweep through Europe they played a ruthless, forward-oriented game in which intimidation was a key part, and opposition players suffered a string of controversial injuries. However, they lost their final game 6–0 against the [[Barbarian F.C.|Barbarians]] in [[Cardiff]], beaten when perhaps the Barbarians' pack played an uncharacteristically pragmatic game.

In '''1962''' the British Isles, won 16 of their 25 games on [[1962 British Lions tour to South Africa|their tour to South Africa]], but did not do so well in the Tests—losing all three. In 1963 the touring Wallabies beat the Springboks in consecutive Tests, the first team to do so since the 1896 British team.

Wales toured South Africa and played several games and one Test in '''1964'''—[[1964 Wales rugby union tour|their first overseas tour]].&lt;ref&gt;Smith (1980), pg 368&lt;/ref&gt; They lost the Test against South Africa in [[Durban]] 24–3, their biggest defeat in 40 years.&lt;ref name="RugbyChronology"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rfu.com/microsites/museum/index.cfm?fuseaction=faqs.chronology |title=Rugby Chronology |publisher=rfu.com |accessdate=28 August 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070304054815/http://www.rfu.com/microsites/museum/index.cfm?fuseaction=faqs.chronology |archivedate=4 March 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[Welsh Rugby Union]] (WRU) annual general meeting that year, the outgoing WRU President D. Ewart Davies declared that "it was evident from the experience of the South African Tour that a much more positive attitude to the game was required in Wales... Players must be prepared to learn, and indeed re-learn, to the absolute point of mastery, the basic principles of Rugby Union football."&lt;ref&gt;Smith (1980), pg 369&lt;/ref&gt;

South Africa had a disastrous year in '''1965''', when lost in [[1965 South Africa rugby union tour of Scotland and Ireland|a short tour]] losing to Ireland, Scotland, and in a [[1965 South Africa rugby union tour of Scotland and Ireland|second and long tour]] to Australia (twice) and New Zealand (three times) while winning just once against New Zealand.

The planned ''1967''' tour by the All Blacks was cancelled by the New Zealand Rugby Football Union after the South African government refused to allow Maori players.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/rugby/news/article.cfm?c_id=80&amp;objectid=10567880 "Call to honour Maori denied AB caps"], 22 April 2009, NZ Herald&lt;/ref&gt;

In '''1968''' the [[1968 British Lions tour to South Africa|Lions toured]] and won 15 of their 16 provincial matches, but lost three Tests and drew one.

Next year the '''1969–70''', [[1969–70 South Africa rugby union tour of Britain and Ireland|Springbok tour to Britain and Ireland]] found a new spirit and confidence had developed in Home nations rugby, and the tourists lost two of their seven games in Wales—against [[Newport RFC|Newport]] and a composite side from [[Monmouthshire County RFC|Monmouthshire]]. Wales nearly claimed their first win against the Springboks as the game ended 6–6. The Springboks lost the Test matches against England and Scotland, drawing the one against Ireland. Throughout the tour however, large anti-apartheid demonstrations were a feature, and many matches had to be played behind barbed wire fences.

==1970s==

In 1970 the [[1970 New Zealand rugby union tour of South Africa|All Blacks toured South Africa]] once again—after the 1967 stand-off, the South African government now agreed to treat Maoris in the team, and Maori spectators, as '[[honorary whites]]'.&lt;ref name="Stuff.co.nz_3673480"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/sunday-news/news/3673480/Bee-Gee-I-never-felt-I-was-an-honorary-white |title=Bee Gee: I never felt I was an honorary white |author=Reid, Neil |date=9 May 2010 |work=Sunday News |accessdate=12 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NZ_Herald_10639172"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/springbok-rugby-team/news/article.cfm?c_id=327&amp;objectid=10639172 |title=Rugby: Once was hatred |author=Brown, Michael |date=18 April 2010 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=12 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Springboks won the test series 3–1.

The [[1971 Springbok tour|Springbok tour of Australia]] in 1971 began with matches in [[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], then [[Adelaide]] and Melbourne. The Springboks won all three Tests, scoring 18–6, 14–6, and 19–11. As in Britain three years before however, massive anti-apartheid demonstrations greeted the team, and they had to be transported by the [[Royal Australian Air Force]] after the trade unions refused to service planes or trains transporting them. Although a tour of New Zealand had been planned for 1973, it was blocked by New Zealand Prime Minister [[Norman Kirk]] on the grounds of public safety.&lt;ref name="1973Tour"&gt;{{cite web| title= Stopping the 1973 tour |url=http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/culture/1981-springbok-tour/1973-springbok-tour |publisher=Ministry for Culture and Heritage |date=13 May 2007 |accessdate=18 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[1974 British Lions tour to South Africa|The Lions team that toured South Africa]] in 1974 led by [[Willie John McBride]] was unbeaten over 22 games, and triumphed 3–0 (with one drawn) in the Test series. A key feature was the Lions' infamous '99 call'. Lions management had decided that the Springboks dominated their opponents with physical aggression, so decided "to get their retaliation in first". At the call of '99' each Lions player would attack their nearest rival player. The idea was that a South African referee would be unlikely to send off all of the Lions. At the "battle of [[EPRFU Stadium|Boet Erasmus Stadium]]"—one of the most violent matches in rugby history—[[JPR Williams]] famously ran over half of the pitch and launched himself at 'Moaner' van Heerden after such a call.&lt;ref name="JPR99"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/sport/2006/10/06/small_talk_jpr_williams.html |title=Small Talk: JPR Williams |work=The Guardian |location=UK |accessdate=18 May 2008 |last=Doyle |first=Paul |date=6 October 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[1976 New Zealand rugby union tour of South Africa|'''1976''' All Blacks tour of South Africa]] went ahead, and the Springboks won by three Tests to one, but coming shortly after the [[Soweto riots]] the tour attracted international condemnation and 28 countries boycotted the [[1976 Summer Olympics]] in protest, and the next year, in '''1977''', the Commonwealth signed the [[Gleneagles Agreement]], which discouraged any sporting contact with South Africa. In response to the growing pressure the segregated South African rugby unions merged in 1977. Four years later [[Errol Tobias]] would become the first non-white South African to represent his country when he took the field against Ireland. A planned 1979 Springbok tour of France was stopped by the French government, who announced that it was inappropriate for South African teams to tour France.

==1980s==

The [[1980 British Lions tour to South Africa|Lions toured South Africa in '''1980''']]. The team completed a flawless non-Test record, winning 14 out of 14 non-Test matches on the tour. But they lost the first three Tests before winning the last one.

The [[1981 Springbok Tour|'''1981''' tour of New Zealand]] went ahead in defiance of the Gleneagles Agreement. South Africa lost the series 2–1, but the tour and the massive civil disruption in New Zealand had ramifications far beyond rugby.

South Africa sought to counteract its sporting isolation by inviting the [[South American Jaguars]] to tour. The team contained mainly Argentinian players, whose national team had struggled to attract strong international opposition. Eight matches were played between the two teams in the early 1980s—all awarded Test status.

In [[1984 England rugby union tour of South Africa|1984]] England toured losing both test matches on tour. Of the players selected, only [[Ralph Knibbs]] of Bristol refused to tour for political reasons.

In 1985, a planned All Black tour of South Africa was stopped by the [[New Zealand High Court]]. A rebel tour took place the next year by a team known as [[New Zealand Cavaliers|the Cavaliers]]. The team was not sanctioned by the New Zealand Rugby Football Union, yet consisted of all but two of the original squad that had been selected.&lt;ref name="Cavaliers"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.nzhistory.net.nz/media/photo/cavaliers-rugby-tour-1985 |title=Cavaliers rugby tour, 1986 |date=23 October 2007 |publisher=Ministry for Culture and Heritage |accessdate=18 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; For some of the tests, the team was advertised, inside South Africa as the All Blacks whilst at the others they were advertised as the New Zealand Cavaliers. The Springboks won the series 3–1.

In 1989, a World XV sanctioned by the International Rugby Board went on a mini-tour of South Africa. All traditional rugby nations bar New Zealand supplied players to the team with ten Welshmen, eight Frenchmen, six Australians, four Englishmen, one Scot and one Irishman.

==1990s==

From 1990 to 1991 the legal apparatus of apartheid was abolished, and the Springboks were readmitted to international rugby in '''1992'''. They struggled to return to their pre-isolation standards in their first games after readmission. During the [[1992 New Zealand rugby union tour of Australia and South Africa|1992 All Blacks tour]], the first to South Africa since 1976, the Springboks were defeated 27–24 by New Zealand on 15 August 1992 and also suffered a 26–3 loss to Australia the following month. Ian McIntosh was sacked as national coach following a series defeat by the All Blacks in New Zealand in mid-1994. In October of that year, [[Kitch Christie]] accepted an offer to take over from McIntosh.

South Africa was selected to host the [[1995 Rugby World Cup]], and there was a remarkable surge of support for the Springboks among the white and black communities in the lead-up to the tournament. This was the first major event to be held in what Archbishop [[Desmond Tutu]] had dubbed "the [[Rainbow Nation]]." South Africans of all colours got behind the slogan coined by Edward Griffiths, then CEO of the rugby federation: "one team, one country".&lt;ref name=Carlin110&gt;{{cite book|last=Carlin|first=John|title=Playing the Enemy|year=2008|publisher=Penguin|location=New York|isbn=978-1-59420-174-5|pages=110–113, 172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time they hosted the '''1995''' World Cup, the Springboks were seeded ninth. They defeated Australia, [[Romania national rugby union team|Romania]], [[Canada national rugby union team|Canada]], [[Samoa national rugby union team|Western Samoa]] and [[France national rugby union team|France]] to play in the final.

South Africa narrowly won the epic [[1995 Rugby World Cup Final]] 15–12 against traditional rivals the All Blacks. A drop goal by [[Joel Stransky]] secured victory in extra-time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/osm/story/0,,1251765,00.html | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=OSM's sporting plaques | accessdate=23 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=5727571184344259601# |title=All Blacks and food poisoning before the 1995 Rugby World Cup final |publisher=Google  |accessdate=2 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Independent Online |url=http://www.iol.co.za/index.php?set_id=6&amp;click_id=581&amp;art_id=qw961136822629B262 |title=News – World Rugby: Syndicate link to Kiwi poisoning of '95 (Page 1 of 2) |publisher=Iol.co.za |accessdate=2 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sports Digital Media |url=http://www.worldcupweb.com/rugby/news/viewarticle.asp?id=13685 |title=Rugby World Cup 2011 The Unofficial Rugby World cup website |publisher=Worldcupweb.com |date=11 June 2008 |accessdate=2 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2003/oct/05/rugbyworldcup2003.rugbyunion1 | work=The Guardian | location=London | title=Inside the mind of an All Black | first=Nick | last=Green | date=5 October 2003 | accessdate=23 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wearing a Springbok shirt, [[Nelson Mandela]] presented the trophy to captain [[Francois Pienaar]], a white Afrikaner. The gesture was widely seen as a major step towards the reconciliation of white and black South Africans. Mandela's enthusiasm and support for the Springboks is portrayed in the 2009 film ''[[Invictus (film)|Invictus]]''. SARFU President [[Louis Luyt]] caused controversy at the post-match dinner by declaring that the Springboks would have won the previous two World Cups if they had been allowed to compete. The day after the World Cup victory, the [[Xhosa language|Xhosa]] word for Springbok, ''Amabokoboko!'' appeared as the headline of [[The Sowetan]]'s sports page.

[[File:Bob Skinstad.jpg|thumb|left|250px|[[Bobby Skinstad]] in June 2007]]
A series of crises followed in 1995 through 1997 as it became clear that South African rugby was an unreformed element of the new Rainbow Nation. The team was also struck by tragedy, as Christie, who had led them to victory in all 14 Tests he coached, was forced to resign in 1996 after battling leukaemia for more than a decade. An on-field slump saw South African sides struggle in the new [[Super Rugby|Super 12]] and [[Tri-Nations Series|Tri-Nations]] competitions. Under new coach [[John Hart (rugby coach)|John Hart]] and the captaincy of [[Sean Fitzpatrick]], the All Blacks won a [[1996 New Zealand rugby union tour of South Africa|Test series in South Africa]] for the first time in '''1996'''.&lt;ref name="PalenskiSA1996"&gt;Palenski (2003), pg 206&lt;/ref&gt; Fitzpatrick even rated the series win higher than the 1987 World Cup victory in which he had participated.&lt;ref name="PalenskiSA1996"/&gt; The '''1997''' Lions completed [[1997 British Lions tour to South Africa|their South African tour]] with only two losses in total, winning the Test series two games to one.

Coach [[Andre Markgraaff]] was fired in 1997 over a racial comment he made. Despite a successful career as a player, Markgraaff's replacement [[Carel du Plessis]] led the team to successive defeats in the [[1997 British Lions tour to South Africa|British and Irish Lions 1997 tour]] and the [[1997 Tri Nations Series]]. He was replaced later in 1997 by [[Nick Mallett]], who went on to coach the unbeaten [[1997 South Africa rugby union tour of Europe]] in late 1997. In 1998 Mallett and new captain [[Gary Teichmann]] tied the then-existing record of the 1965–69 All Blacks for longest Test winning streak, winning 17 consecutive Tests, including the 1998 Tri-Nations.&lt;ref name="Lithuania streak"&gt;This record was surpassed by [[Lithuania national rugby union team|Lithuania]] in 2010, but remains a record for "Tier 1" rugby nations. {{cite news |url=http://www.rugbyworldcup.com/qualifying/news/newsid=2037051.html#lithuania+rugby+world+record |title=Lithuania set new Rugby World Record |publisher=[[International Rugby Board]] |date=26 April 2010 |accessdate=27 April 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120506130519/http://www.rugbyworldcup.com/qualifying/news/newsid%3D2037051.html#lithuania+rugby+world+record |archivedate=6 May 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, South Africa mourned as Christie's illness claimed his life.

Despite indications that the Springboks were a team on the decline prior to the [[1999 Rugby World Cup]],&lt;ref name="Mighty Boks: South African rugby"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/rugby_union/international/3772591.stm | title=Mighty Boks: South African rugby | publisher=BBC | date=15 November 2005 | accessdate=9 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; they reached the semi-finals of the competition, where they lost to eventual champions {{nrut|Australia}} at [[Twickenham Stadium|Twickenham]].

==2000–2009==

[[File:Percy Montgomery against Samoa.jpg|thumb|300px|right|[[Percy Montgomery]] running the ball for the Springboks against [[Samoa national rugby union team|Samoa]] in 2007, with [[Jaque Fourie]] supporting on the outside.]]
During the [[2002 South Africa rugby union tour of Europe|2002 tour]], at Twickenham in November 2002 England defeated South Africa 53–3, which was their worst ever loss, after Springbok Jannes Labuschagne was red-carded after 23 minutes and the Boks played three-quarters of the match one man short.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/rugby_union/international/2506421.stm |work=BBC News  | first=James | last=Standley | title=England rout sorry Springboks | date=23 November 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; An increasingly frustrated South African side began physically targeting England players during the match, with footage showing captain [[Corné Krige]] as a leader.&lt;ref name=krige&gt;{{cite news |publisher=BBC Sport   | title=Krige in the spotlight|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/rugby_union/international/2525929.stm| accessdate =6 August 2006 | date=28 November 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2002 and 2003 seasons, the Springboks also lost by record margins to France, Scotland and New Zealand. They defeated [[Argentina national rugby union team|Argentina]] by only one point, and were eliminated from the [[2003 Rugby World Cup|2003 World Cup]] in the quarter final round – their worst ever showing in a World Cup record of two gold and one bronze from five appearances.

During a pre-World Cup training camp, there was a highly publicised dispute between [[Geo Cronjé]] (an Afrikaner) and [[Quinton Davids]] (a coloured). Both were dropped from the team, and Cronjé was called before a tribunal to answer charges that his actions in the dispute were racially motivated. Cronjé was eventually cleared. Later, the Boks were sent to a military-style boot camp in the South African bush called [[Kamp Staaldraad]] (literal English translation "Camp Steel-wire", idiomatically "Camp Barbed Wire"). After the World Cup, then-coach [[Rudolf Straeuli]] was under fire, not only because of the team's poor results, but because of his role in organising Kamp Staaldraad. He eventually resigned, and in February 2004 [[Jake White]] was named as new national coach.

The Springboks then swept Ireland in a two-Test series and defeated Wales during their opponents' June 2004 tours of the Southern Hemisphere. Next came a win in [[2004 Tri Nations Series|the most closely contested Tri Nations in history]]—their only Tri Nations trophy since 1998. In November 2004, the Springboks went on a [[2004 South Africa end of year rugby union tour|Grand Slam tour of the Home Nations]]. They were decisively defeated by England, and lost controversially to Ireland. They then won a hard-fought match against Wales, and prevailed comfortably against Scotland. The Springbok resurgence was honoured with a sweep of the major [[International Rugby Board]] awards. The Boks were named Team of the Year, White Coach of the Year, and flanker [[Schalk Burger]] Player of the Year.

In 2005 the Springboks defeated an embarrassed [[Uruguay national rugby union team|Uruguay]] by a world record margin. Zimbabwean-born new cap, [[Tonderai Chavanga]], scored a record six tries in the match, surpassing [[Stefan Terblanche]]'s previous record of five. The side finished second in the Tri-Nations that year, losing their final match to New Zealand. The springboks thought they had the match before Keven Mealamu scored the match winning try for the All Blacks in the 27–31 loss.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} The year ended positively with close victories away from home against Argentina, among others.

With several new players aboard, the 2006 Springboks defeated Scotland twice in South Africa, before a loss to France ended their long undefeated home record. A bad start to the [[2006 Tri Nations Series]] saw them lose 49–0 to the Wallabies. The Springboks put together better games in the following two matches, losing in the final minutes in the second test against Australia. Answering the call from many South African supporters to play a more expansive style of rugby, coach Jake White fielded a more adventurous team. They broke South Africa's five-game losing streak by beating the All Blacks 21–20 at [[Royal Bafokeng Stadium]]. The All Blacks' defeat by the South Africans was their only loss of the year. The highlight of South Africa's tour to Europe was the 24–15 win over England at Twickenham, after a loss to Ireland and one to England the previous week. 
In July 2006, Springbok coach [[Jake White]] told the press he had been unable to pick some white players for his squad "because of transformation"—a reference to the ANC government's policies attempting to redress the racial imbalances in national sport.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

===Rugby World Cup 2007===

[[File:09-09-07 058.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The Springboks]]
Grouped in Pool A at the [[2007 Rugby World Cup]] in France, they opened their campaign in Paris with a 59–7 victory over Samoa. Next up was England at the Stade de France, where the Springboks triumphed 36–-0. The third pool game against Tonga in Lens was more competitive and they narrowly won 30–25. The final pool game against the USA in Montpellier produced a 64–15 win.

Having won all their pool games, they advanced to the quarter finals to defeat Fiji 37–20 before accounting for Argentina 37–13 in the semi-finals.
They prevailed 15–6 over England to lift the Webb Ellis Cup for a second time on 20 October 2007. The Springboks won the match joining Australia as the only other national team, at the time, to have won the trophy twice (New Zealand also won it for a second time in 2011).

===After the World Cup===

2008 was a mixed year for the Springboks. Going into the year as world champions, they were under pressure to perform. In January 2008, [[Peter de Villiers]] was appointed as the first non-white coach of the Springboks. De Villiers's first squad included ten of colour and managed two victories against [[Wales national rugby union team|Wales]] (43–17 and 37–21) and one against [[Italy national rugby union team|Italy]] (26–0) in Incoming Tours. They had an ultimately disappointing [[2008 Tri Nations Series|Tri Nations]] ending up last with only two wins. They did manage a historic triumph in [[Dunedin]], a city in which they had never tasted victory in over 100 years. The Springboks beat [[Wales national rugby union team|Wales]] and [[Scotland national rugby union team|Scotland]] before thrashing [[England national rugby union team|England]] on the [[2008 end of year rugby tests|end of year tour]].

[[File:IRB world rankings - South Africa 2010.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Springbok rankings during 2009]]
The 2009 season began as one of the more successful. The Boks' 2009 international campaign began with a closely fought 2–1 series win over the Lions. They followed it up with a win in the [[2009 Tri Nations Series|Tri Nations]], sweeping the All Blacks and losing only to the Wallabies in [[Lang Park|Brisbane]], adding the [[Freedom Cup]] (against New Zealand) and the [[Mandela Challenge Plate]] (against Australia) to their trophy cabinet.
However, the Boks' busy year took its toll when they toured Europe in the [[2009 end of year rugby tests|November Test window]]. They lost their top spot in the IRB rankings with a loss to France. The Boks then defeated Italy, but were beaten by Ireland to close out the year.
Nonetheless, the Boks were named [[IRB International Team of the Year]], beating out [[2009 Six Nations Championship|Six Nations]] [[Grand Slam (rugby union)|Grand Slam]] winners Ireland.

== 2010–present ==

The Boks began their 2010 Test campaign on 5 June, defeating Wales 34–31 in Cardiff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.supersport.com/rugby/springboks/news/100604/Boks_relishing_underdog_tag_De_Villiers |title=Boks relishing underdog tag – De Villiers|publisher=Supersport|date=4 June 2010 |accessdate=8 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
After defeating Wales, the Springboks headed back to Cape Town to play against France, which they won 42–17.&lt;ref name="supersport1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.supersport.com/rugby/springboks/news/100612/Aplons_brace_buries_hapless_French |title=Aplon's brace buries hapless French|publisher=Supersport|date=12 June 2010 |accessdate=13 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Springbok victory over the French was their first since 2005. Their final preparations for the 2010 Tri-Nations tournament includes two internationals against Italy. In the first test the Springbok team beat Italy by 29–13,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.scrum.com/southafrica/rugby/story/117994.html|title=Springboks too strong for gutsy Italy|publisher=Scrum|date=19 June 2010 |accessdate=10 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the second test beat the Azzuri 55–11.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.scrum.com/southafrica/rugby/story/118414.html|title=Springboks blow Italy away|publisher=Scrum|date=26 June 2010 |accessdate=10 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Boks were widely fancied to beat the All Blacks at Eden Park in Auckland in the first Tri-Nations test of 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.supersport.com/rugby/springboks/news/100707/Boks_acknowledged_as_greatest_challenge|title=Boks acknowledged as greatest challenge|publisher=Super Sport|date=7 July 2010 |accessdate=14 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Boks had only previously won twice at Eden park, the last time being in 1937. However, the first test of the 2010 Tri Nations campaign turned out to be a nightmare for the Boks. They went down 32–12.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.supersport.com/rugby/springboks/news/100710/Boks_bullied_into_defeat|title=Boks bullied into defeat|publisher=Super Sport |accessdate=14 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the Boks lost consecutive tests to again succeed both the Tri-Nations trophy and Freedom Cup to the world number one ranked All Blacks, as well as lose the Mandela Plate and second place [[IRB World Ranking]] to Australia.

On 6 November 2010, the Springboks had the honour of being the first Test team to play Ireland at their new home of [[Aviva Stadium]]. Because of the historic significance of this match, the Boks had agreed to wear their change strip to allow Ireland to wear their regular green. (Normally, the home team changes in case of a colour clash.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/rugby_union/irish/8296992.stm |title=SA to play in Aviva rugby opener |publisher=BBC Sport  |date=8 October 2009 |accessdate=12 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The match was the opener of their first attempted Grand Slam tour since 2004, with the Ireland match followed by encounters with Wales, Scotland and England. The Boks followed the tour up with a match against the [[Barbarian F.C.|Barbarians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sarugby.co.za/newsarticle.aspx?newsid=331349 |title=Springbok end-of-year fixtures confirmed |publisher=South African Rugby Union |date=29 January 2010 |accessdate=29 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2011 and the Rugby World Cup ===


The Springboks kicked off their 2011 test season with controversy, with 21 high-profile players omitted from the away leg of the [[2011 Tri Nations Series|2011 Tri Nations]], leaving only captain [[John Smit]] and [[Morné Steyn]] as regular members of the starting XV amongst a largely second-string side. Media sources claimed that the Boks players were simply being rested in preparation for the upcoming World Cup, thus creating outcry that the 2011 Tri Nations was being turned into a farce by the Springboks. The Boks subsequently lost both of their away games. The home leg saw the return of the first-choice players, and the Boks went on to lose to Australia, but win the following week 18–5 against New Zealand. The Springboks finished the 2011 Tri Nations with just the one win.

The South Africans entered the [[2011 Rugby World Cup]] drawn in a pool against [[Wales national rugby union team|Wales]], [[Samoa national rugby union team|Samoa]], [[Fiji national rugby union team|Fiji]] and [[Namibia national rugby union team|Namibia]]. Despite a close opening encounter against Wales, which was won 17–16, the Springboks went on to top their group, registering convincing wins against Fiji and Namibia, before winning another close match against Samoa 13–5.
The Springboks then faced [[Australia national rugby union team|Australia]] in a highly controversial quarter-final match, ultimately losing 11–9 and falling out of the tournament. The South African fans and pundits went on to criticise New Zealand referee [[Bryce Lawrence]] for "one-sided" refereeing, claiming that Australian openside [[David Pocock]] was allowed to "reduce the breakdown to a farce".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en-gb.facebook.com/pages/Petition-To-Stop-Bryce-Lawrence-Ever-Reffing-A-Rugby-Game-Again/286992594653732| title=Petition To Stop Bryce Lawrence Ever Reffing A Rugby Game Again}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lawrence was dropped from the nine-man elite panel in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/rugby/7356523/New-Zealand-ref-Bryce-Lawrence-out-of-elite-list&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the World Cup exit, several stalwarts of the 2007 World Cup-winning side and the 2011 squad went on to announce retirements or moves abroad. This included captain [[John Smit]], influential lock pairing [[Victor Matfield]] and [[Bakkies Botha]], and scrum-half [[Fourie du Preez]].

The '''Kailao''' is a [[Tonga]]n cultural dance. It's origin is from [[Wallis and Futuna]].
==History==
It's origin is from [[Wallis and Futuna]] where it is still performed in public ceremonies. In Tonga it is usually performed at public and private ceremonies. The men, bearing stylized clubs (pate kailao), dance in a fierce manner that emulates fighting, all to the accompaniment of a beaten slit drum or a tin box, which sets the tempo. Unlike most other Tongan dances, the kailao is performed without singing. The sequences of movements to be performed by the group are called by the lead dancer, who will give the name of the sequence, then will signal when to do it. The sequences can involve mock combat between dancers, changes in formation, and tricks involving the pate kailao themselves. The dance displays the dancers' discipline, obedience and skill with their weapon. A similar [[Rotuma]]n dance, also derived from the 'Uvean original is similarly titled ''"ka'loa"''.

The 'Ikale Tahi, the [[Tonga national rugby union team|national rugby union team]] used to perform the kailao with kailao clubs or sticks, as they did against Wales in 1974. However in the 1980's, the Tonga national team stopped performing the Kailao and switched to the Sipitau which is performed without sticks.

==Sipi Tau==
[[File:kailao.jpg|thumb|right|400px|Tonga College students performing a kailao for the King's 70th birthday (1988)]]

The Tonga rugby union national team's pre-game challenge, the Sipi Tau was penned by King [[Tāufaʻāhau Tupou IV|Tama Tu'i Tāufaʻāhau Tupou IV]] in 1994, but its origins can be traced back much further. In Tonga in the pre-1800s there were no challenges before war. Indeed talking was considered a sign of weakness in battle. But in the 19th century a war dance was introduced from the neighbouring Wallis and Futuna Islands and Tonga quickly annexed it.
There have been several different Sipi Tau used by the Tongan rugby team over the years, but it is unsure when they were first used in rugby. The latest one was composed in honour of a short, successful tour of New Zealand in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.irishtimes.com/sport/artistic-merit-tonga-war-dance-1.234614&lt;/ref&gt; The current words were first used in the [[2011 Rugby World Cup]].

The '''Kor Royal Cup stampede'''  was a [[Stampede#Human_stampedes|human crush]] that occurred on 20 February 2010 at [[National Stadium (Thailand)|Suphachalasai Stadium]] in [[Bangkok]], Thailand during a [[Kor Royal Cup]] match between [[Muangthong United F.C.|Muangthong United]] and [[Singhtarua F.C.|Thai Port]].

==Events==
{{Main|2010 Kor Royal Cup}}
[[Mohamed Koné (footballer, born 1984)|Koné Mohamed]] scored with a header from a Piyachart free kick in the 67th minute, his first goal in a Muangthong United shirt after he moved from [[Chonburi F.C.|Chonburi]], and [[Dagno Siaka]] scored with a header in the 81st minute.

Thai Port's [[Pongpipat Kamnuan]] attempted to convince his fans (the ''Khlong Toei Army'') that the second goal came from a [[handball (soccer)|handball]]; they agreed with him, and feeling that the second goal should have been disallowed, they started throwing firecrackers and bottles onto the pitch, and a pitch invasion then occurred in which Thai Port fans attacked fleeing Muangthong United fans (the ''Ultra Muangthong''), Muangthong United players, officials and stadium security. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bangkokpost.com/breakingnews/169108/violence-disrupts-thai-premier-final Violence disrupts Thai Premier final]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/sports/33257/violence-mars-king-trophy-match Violence mars King's Trophy match]&lt;/ref&gt;

Thai Port fans later set fire to Muangthong United's team flag and a team shirt in the centre of the pitch.

==Aftermath==
The match was abandoned and the Kor Royal Cup was awarded to Muangthong United. The actions of the Thai Port fans could not have come at a worse time for the club, as they were preparing to host the Vietnamese champions, [[Đà Nẵng]] in their [[2010 AFC Cup]] Group H opener at the National Stadium on 24 February.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.the-afc.com/en/afc-cup-2010/27149-crowd-trouble-mars-kor-royal-cup Crowd trouble mars Kor Royal Cup]&lt;/ref&gt;

At least ten fans were injured, nine from Muangthong United and one from Thai Port.

This is a list of '''foreign players''' in the '''[[Úrvalsdeild karla (football)|Úrvalsdeild]]''', which commenced play in 1912. The following players must meet both of the following two criteria:
#Have played at least one Úrvalsdeild League game. Players who were signed by Úrvalsdeild League clubs, but only played in lower league, cup and/or European games, or did not play in any competitive games at all, are not included.
#Are considered foreign, determined by the following:
::A player is considered foreign if he is not eligible to play for [[Iceland national football team]], more specifically:
::*If a player has been capped on international level, the national team is used; if he has been capped by more than one country, the highest level (or the most recent) team is used.
::*If a player has not been capped on international level, his country of birth is used, except those who were born abroad from Icelandic parents or moved to Iceland at a young age, and those who clearly indicated to have switched his nationality to another nation.

'''Monmouth Park Racetrack''' is an American [[race track]] for [[thoroughbred]] [[horse racing]] in [[Oceanport, New Jersey|Oceanport]], [[New Jersey]], United States. It is owned by the [[New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority]] and is operated under a five-year lease as a partnership with Darby Development, LLC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theracingbiz.com/2014/05/09/monmouth-park-opens-change-way-preservation|title=AS MONMOUTH PARK OPENS, CHANGE IS A WAY OF PRESERVATION|publisher=theracingbiz.com|date=May 9, 2014|accessdate=August 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Monmouth Park's marquee event is the [[Haskell Invitational]], named after Amory L. Haskell. The Haskell was first run in 1968 as a handicap, but was made into an Invitational Handicap in 1981. It is now a 1⅛-mile test for three-year-olds run in late July. Monmouth Park also now showcases the [[Jersey Derby]] originally run at [[Garden State Park]] until its closure in 2001.

==History==
===Long Branch Racetrack===
[[File:BreedersCupClassic2007-AwesomeGemFirstTurn.jpg|thumb|left|The racetrack and part of the stands during the [[2007 Breeders' Cup]]]]
The original [[thoroughbred racing]] track was opened by the Monmouth Park Association on July 30, 1870 in [[Eatontown, New Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Inauguration of the New Monmouth Park Race-Course |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1870/07/31/archives/racing-at-the-branch-inauguration-of-the-new-monmouth-park.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=July 31, 1870 |page=1 |accessdate=2010-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1878 it was bought by [[David D. Withers]], [[George L. Lorillard]], [[James Gordon Bennett, Jr.]], and [[George P. Wetmore]].&lt;!-- after which Withers ran the facility for more than a decade during which time he helped found racings Board of Control, a predecessor to [[The Jockey Club]].--&gt; From 1882 to 1890, the track increased in popularity, but legislation proposed in 1891 and enacted in 1894 barred [[parimutuel betting]] in [[New Jersey]], and the track closed its doors. In May 1894, the Township Committee at [[Eatontown, New Jersey]] ordered the seizure and sale of the Monmouth Park Association's [[grandstand]] and other property for the payment of back taxes and on May 7 was sold at a public auction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Monmouth Park's Troubles |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1894/05/03/archives/monmouth-parks-troubles-the-grand-stand-and-personal-property-to-be.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=May 3, 1894 |page=3 |accessdate=2010-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Monmouth Park Effects Sold |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1894/05/08/archives/monmouth-park-effects-sold-furniture-horses-and-wagons-said-to-be.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=May 8, 1894 |page=3 |accessdate=2010-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some of the major races held at the Long Branch track included the [[Champion Stakes (United States)|Champion Stakes]], the [[Freehold Stakes]], and the [[Monmouth Cup]]. The [[United States Department of the Army]] later constructed [[Fort Monmouth]] on the site of the former racetrack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fortmonmouthnj.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Concise-History-of-Fort-Monmouth.pdf||title=A Concise History of Fort Monmouth, NJ and the U.S. Army CECOM Life Cycle Management Command|publisher=FortMonmouthNJ.com|date=2009|accessdate=August 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Monmouth Park Jockey Club===
In 1946, the [[New Jersey Legislature]] passed a bill providing for state regulation of [[horse racing]]. Spurred on by [[Amory L. Haskell]], who led the legislative charge to once again permit wagering on horse racing in New Jersey and [[Philip H. Iselin]], a [[New York City]] [[textile]] magnate, along with the backing of [[Reeve Schley]], [[Joseph M. Roebling]], [[John M. MacDonald]], [[Townsend B. Martin]], and [[James Cox Brady, Jr.]]. Now called the Monmouth Park Jockey Club, it opened on June 19, 1946. [[Thoroughbred racing]] was back at the facility after a 53-year hiatus with 18,724 in attendance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Races Start Today At Monmouth Park |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1946/06/19/archives/races-start-today-at-monmouth-park-first-flight-and-mesl-among.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date=June 19, 1946 |at=section Sports, p. 34 |accessdate=2010-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Monmouth Park Racetrack===
The [[New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority]] purchased Monmouth Park from its previous owners, the Monmouth Park Jockey Club, in 1985, in a deal valued at $45 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Monmouth Park Track Sold to N.J.

The [[Vans Warped Tour]], a touring music and [[extreme sports]] festival, was successfully held at the racetrack in 2010 and 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.last.fm/festival/1331100+Vans+Warped+Tour+2010|title=Vans Warped Tour 2010|publisher=last.fm|date=July 18, 2010|accessdate=August 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.last.fm/festival/1754128+Vans+Warped+Tour+2011|title=Vans Warped Tour 2011|publisher=last.fm|date=July 24, 2010|accessdate=August 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It marks the [[New York metropolitan area|New York]] stop on the nationwide tour, which visits the area during July. In 2012, the festival moved to the [[PNC Bank Arts Center]] in nearby [[Holmdel, New Jersey]] due to financial considerations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.nj.com/entertainment/music/index.ssf/2012/07/warped_tour_changes_its_addres.html|title=Warped Tour changes its address, but little else|publisher=NJ.com|date=July 13, 2012|accessdate=August 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, a five-year lease was signed with Morris Bailey, co-owner of [[Resorts Casino Hotel]] in Atlantic City, to provide a marketing partnership between the casino and racetrack. The agreement allowed Resorts to sponsor the Haskell Invitational, and possibilities include a merging of loyalty programs as well as bringing entertainers' appearances at the casino to the racetrack. The program is part of a strategy to mesh horse racing with casino gambling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pressofatlanticcity.com/communities/atlantic-city_pleasantville_brigantine/resorts-casino-hotel-gets-business-partner-in-monmouth-park/article_b0c8a370-b648-11e0-b5cd-001cc4c002e0.html |title=Resorts Casino Hotel gets business partner in Monmouth Park |work=[[Press of Atlantic City]] |author=Donald Wittkowski |date=24 Jul 2011 |accessdate=25 Jul 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2013, Monmouth Park opened the Bluegrass [[Miniature Golf]] Course near the Port-au-Peck Ave. entrance. The Course features two 18-hole courses, the Haskell Course and the [[Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing (United States)|Triple Crown]] Course.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monmouthpark.com/event_detail.aspx?id=7083|title=Bluegrass Miniature Golf OPENS|publisher=Monmouth Park|date=April 27, 2013|accessdate=August 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2016, the luxury restaurant Blu Grotto, named after the [[Blue Grotto (Capri)|Blue Grotto]] [[sea cave]] on the Italian island of [[Capri]], opened at Monmouth Park. The restaurant is open year-round and is located near the racetrack's quarter-pole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thoroughbreddailynews.com/luxury-restaurant-added-to-monmouth-menu/|title=Luxury Restaurant Added to Monmouth Menu|publisher=Thoroughbred Daily News|date=July 27, 2016|accessdate=August 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Beer garden|Beer Garden]] at Blu Grotto opened in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monmouthpark.com/content.aspx?id=8072||title=Blu Grotto|publisher=Monmouth Park|date=August 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physical Attributes==
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2014}}
The main track is a one-mile (1.6&amp;nbsp;km) dirt oval with chutes for 6 furlong and 1¼ mile races.

[[File:Monmouth turf.jpg|thumb|The long infield chute at Monmouth Park leads to the main turf course and allows for races of up to 1⅛ miles.]]
The [[grass|turf]] course is seven furlongs in circumference, with a diagonal chute for races between {{convert|1|mi|km|adj=on}} and 1⅛ miles. A re-design of the grass course for the 2006 season brought with it a new, second chute to accommodate 5½ furlong sprint races. Turf races can be run along the hedge, or with the portable rail out 12 feet (dubbed the "Haskell Course"), 24 feet ("Monmouth Course") or 36 feet ("Lennox Course").

The Stable Area, located directly to the north of the back stretch of the main track, contains a total of forty barns and stables, twelve north of the [[New Jersey Transit]]'s [[North Jersey Coast Line]] (connected by its own service and access road) and twenty eight on the main complex.

The Wolf Hill Farm, which served Monmouth Park as a private stable and practice facility, is located adjacent to and immediately west of the main complex. Wolf Hill, owned and operated by the Valentino Family from the nearby City of [[Long Branch, New Jersey]] featured barns, stables and a practice track featuring a dirt oval and turf course identical to that at Monmouth Park's main facility only built to 50% scale. The Valentino Family sold Wolf Hill Farm to the [[Monmouth Park Jockey Club]] in 1963 which then became part of the greater Monmouth Park Complex. It was transferred to state ownership in the 1986 takeover by the NJSEA and was eventually sold to the [[Monmouth County Park System]] in 1998 which now operates the site as Wolf Hill Recreation Area that features a 4-acre [[dog park]], an 18-hole [[disc golf]] course, a [[baseball field]] and two [[softball]] fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.monmouthcountyparks.com/page.aspx?ID=2548|title=Wolf Hill Recreation Area|publisher=Monmouth County Parks|date=August 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Wolf Hill ceased operating as a farm following the 1963 sale, owners and trainers continued to use Wolf Hill's practice track well into the 1990s. Remnants of the practice were clearly visible on the site until after the 2009 meet. After the 2009 meet, construction began in the Wolf Hill area, eliminating the last of the practice track.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pdga.com/course-directory/course/wolf-hill-recreation-area-disc-golf|title=Wolf Hill Recreation Area Disc Golf|publisher=Professional Disc Golf Association|date=August 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Breeders' Cup World Championships===
On October 26 and 27, 2007, Monmouth Park hosted the [[Breeders' Cup]] for the first time in its history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Curlin Is Favorite for Haskell |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/03/sports/othersports/03sportsbriefs-haskell.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=August 3, 2007 |accessdate=2007-10-08 |quote=It is a pivotal one-and-one-eighth-mile race for 3-year-olds with the Breeders’ Cup World Championships being held at Monmouth for the first time Oct. 26-27.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The 2007 Event also marked the first time the event has been held over two days and also the creation of three new races held on Day 1 of the Championships.

'''Winners of Races''':&lt;br&gt;
'''Day 1'''&lt;br&gt;
Filly &amp; Mare Sprint-[[Maryfield (horse)|Maryfield]]&lt;br&gt;
Juvenile Turf-[[Nownownow]]&lt;br&gt;
Dirt Mile-[[Corinthian (horse)|Corinthian]]&lt;br&gt;
'''Day 2'''&lt;br&gt;
Juvenile Fillies-[[Indian Blessing]]&lt;br&gt;
Juvenile-[[War Pass]]&lt;br&gt;
Filly &amp; Mare Turf-[[Lahudood]]&lt;br&gt;
Sprint-[[Midnight Lute]]&lt;br&gt;
Mile-[[Kip Deville]]&lt;br&gt;
Distaff-[[Ginger Punch]]&lt;br&gt;
Turf-[[English Channel]]&lt;br&gt;
Classic-[[Curlin]]

The Classic was marred by a fatal injury suffered by George Washington, the 2006 European 3-year-old champion who had returned to training when his stud career was scuttled by fertility problems. He suffered a dislocated fracture of his right front ankle and was euthanized on the track.

===Million Dollar Meet===
In March 2010, it was announced that Monmouth Park would shorten its summer meet, conducting only 50 days of live racing (down from 141 total [[thoroughbred]] days in the state) for a total of $50 million in purse money for the 2010 meet. This was done due to the recent monetary losses of the racetrack industry in New Jersey and made it the most expensive purse structure in North America at the time.

==TV Personalites==
*Caton Bredar (1995–1998)
*Barbara Foster (1995–1997) 
*Jennifer Burke (2000–2004)
*Carolyn Conley 
*Brad Thomas (?-present)
*Thomas Cassidy (?-present)
*[[Larry Collmus]] (1994–2014)
*Mike Curci
*Gordon Richards 
*Matt Carothers (1998)
*Travis Stone (2014)

==TV &amp; Film Appearances==
*The track appears in the 1984 film classic ''[[The Pope of Greenwich Village]]''.
*Monmouth Park was featured in a 1986 episode of ''[[The Equalizer|The Equalizer TV series]]'', entitled "Tip on a Sure Thing." 
*''[[Law &amp; Order]]'' filmed an episode at Monmouth Park racetrack entitled "Sport of Kings" in 2005.
*The 2010 film ''[[The Bounty Hunter (2010 film)|The Bounty Hunter]]'' starring Jennifer Aniston and Gerard Butler filmed a brief scene at Monmouth Park.
*The track was briefly shown on an episode of ''[[Impractical Jokers]]''.

==Accessibility &amp; transportation==
The Park is served by the [[Monmouth Park station|Monmouth Park]] station on [[New Jersey Transit]]'s [[North Jersey Coast Line]] during the racing season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monmouthpark.com/content.aspx?id=245|title=By Train|publisher=Monmouth Park|accessdate=July 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A special train called the "Pony Express" was discontinued after the 2005 racing season. This train operated between [[Hoboken Terminal]] and the racetrack, terminating on a rail siding near the grandstand entrance. It was often scouted out by [[railfan]]s due to the variety of equipment that were used on the train in recent years, ranging from the 1970 vintage [[Pullman Standard]] [[Erie Lackawanna]] Comet I cars to modern Alstom [[Metro-North]] Comet Vs.

Monmouth Park is also served by the [[List of New Jersey Transit bus routes (800-880)|831]] [[New Jersey Transit Bus Operations|New Jersey Transit Bus]] route.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.njtransit.com/pdf/bus/T0831.pdf|title=831 Schedule|publisher=NJ Transit|date=September 3, 2016|accessdate=July 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Park is accessible by car via [[New Jersey Route 36|NJ-36]] with connections to the [[Garden State Parkway]], [[Interstate 195 (New Jersey)|I-195]], [[New Jersey Turnpike]] ([[Interstate 95 in New Jersey|I-95]]) and other highways and roads. Parking is available in several on site lots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monmouthpark.com/directions.aspx?Id=94|title=By Car|publisher=Monmouth Park|date=July 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Muay Lao ({{lang-lo|ມວຍລາວ}})''' is a traditional unarmed [[martial art]] from [[Laos]]. It is similar to [[muay Thai]] from [[Thailand]], [[pradal serey]] from [[Cambodia]], and [[tomoi]] from [[Malaysia]]. It incorporates punches, kicks, elbows and knee strikes. Muay Lao was an event at the [[2009 Southeast Asian Games]] in [[Vientiane]].

The martial art is related to other forms of martial arts found in other parts of the [[Greater India|Indian cultural sphere]] including [[Musti-yuddha]] in India, [[Muay Thai]] in Thailand, [[Pradal serey]] in Cambodia and [[Lethwei]] in Myanmar.

'''''O Jogo''''' ([[English language|English]]: ''The Game'') is a [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] daily [[sport]] [[newspaper]] published in [[Porto]], Portugal.

==History and profile==
''O Jogo'' was first published on 22 February 1985 by the [[Jornal de Notícias]] company in [[Porto]], and it is seen as appealing mainly to supporters of [[FC Porto]],&lt;ref name=kumar&gt;{{cite book|author=Prasidh Kumar Mishra|title=Sports Journalism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Jcfml8Fqy1wC&amp;pg=PT167|date=10 October 2010|publisher=Pinnacle Technology|isbn=978-1-61820-463-9|page=167}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.novidadestv.com/2012/09/04/benfica-contra-oliveira-pt-e-zon/|title=Benfica contra Oliveira, PT e Zon |trans-title=Benfica against [Joaquim] Oliveira, PT (Portugal Telecom) and ZON|language=Portuguese|date=4 September 2012|work=Correio da Manhã|accessdate=12 January 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130304055609/http://www.novidadestv.com/2012/09/04/benfica-contra-oliveira-pt-e-zon|archivedate=4 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; being publicly criticized by [[S.L.

'''Papoose Peak Jumps''' was a [[ski jumping hill]] located at [[Squaw Valley Ski Resort]] in the US state of [[California]]. The hill consisted of three jumps, with [[K-point]]s of 80, 60 and 40 meters, respectively. Constructed upon the hill-side of Little Papoose Peak, it was built for the [[1960 Winter Olympics]]; the 80-meter hill hosted the [[ski jumping at the 1960 Winter Olympics|ski jumping event]] and the 60-meter hill the [[Nordic combined at the 1960 Winter Olympics|Nordic combined event]]. The jump was designed by [[Heini Klopfer]] and opened in 1958. After the Olympics the venue saw little use; it was renovated for the 1976 US National Ski Jumping Championships, but has since fallen into disrepair and demolished to make room for a [[ski lift]].

==History==
As Squaw Valley was an undeveloped area when it was awarded the Olympics, the organizing committee was free to design a tailor-made Olympic resort.&lt;ref&gt;Squaw Valley Organizing Committee: 33&lt;/ref&gt; Heini Klopfer from [[Oberstdorf]], West Germany, was hired to design the ski jumping hills, which he finished in early 1957. He chose to locate it on the hill-side of Little Papoose Peak, opposite [[Blyth Arena]]. He described the location as "the type of hill one always seeks but seldom finds".&lt;ref name=s103&gt;Squaw Valley Organizing Committee: 103&lt;/ref&gt; The construction contract was awarded to Diversified Builders, who constructed the jumps during the summer and fall of 1958.

Papoose Peak Jumps was the first Olympic ski jump to have three [[ski jump|in-runs]].&lt;ref name=s103 /&gt;   Minor details were corrected in 1959 and 1960. It was renovated ahead of the 1976 US National Championships.&lt;ref name=skisprungschanzen&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.skisprungschanzen.com/EN/Ski+Jumps/USA-United+States/CA-California/Squaw+Valley/0578/ |title=Papoose Peak Jumps |publisher=Ski Jumping Hill Archive |accessdate=21 June 2012 |archivedate=21 June 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68aoW89n1?url=http://www.skisprungschanzen.com/EN/Ski+Jumps/USA-United+States/CA-California/Squaw+Valley/0578/ |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it fell out of use afterwards and instead the hill was converted to a [[speed skiing]] and [[snowboarding]] hill. Later the resort's Far East Express chairlift was installed on the hill.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/winter/1960/SKJ/ |title=Ski Jumping at the 1960 Squaw Valley Winter Games |publisher=Sports Reference |accessdate=21 June 2012 |archivedate=21 June 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68aoaPS0M?url=http://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/winter/1960/SKJ/ |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facilities==
The hill consisted of three jumps with a common out-run, each with a [[construction point]] (K-point) of 80, 60 and 40 meters, respectively.&lt;ref name=skisprungschanzen /&gt; It was located in the central area of the Olympic resort, next to the skating rinks and the Olympic Village. Tall trees on both sides of the hill gave good protection against the wind. The location was also ideal because of the sun was at the competitor's backs. A judges' tower was constructed on the side, which was both accessible by stairs from the bottom of the hill or from the chairlift which ran to the top of the in-runs.&lt;ref name=s103 /&gt; The hill had an overall height of {{convert|140|m|sp=us}}, the in-run had a length of {{convert|113|m|sp=us}}. The largest jump had a take-off angle of 8.5 degrees and a landing angle of 38 degrees.&lt;ref name=skisprungschanzen /&gt;

==Events==
The first competitive use of the hills was the trial Olympics in February 1959. During the 1960 Winter Olympics, the 80-meter hill was used for special jumping on 28 February,&lt;ref name=s105&gt;Squaw Valley Organizing Committee: 105&lt;/ref&gt; while the 60-meter hill was used for Nordic combined  on 22 February.&lt;ref name=s106&gt;Squaw Valley Organizing Committee: 106&lt;/ref&gt; The [[ski jumping at the 1960 Winter Olympics|special ski jumping event]] was won by [[Helmut Recknagel]] of [[Germany at the 1960 Winter Olympics|Germany]], who also set a hill record of {{convert|93.5|m|sp=us}}. He was followed up by [[Finland at the 1960 Winter Olympics|Finland]]'s [[Niilo Halonen]] and [[Austria at the 1960 Winter Olympics|Austria]]'s [[Otto Leodolter]].&lt;ref name=s105 /&gt; In the ski jumping part of the [[Nordic combined at the 1960 Winter Olympics|Nordic combined event]], Germany's [[Georg Thoma]] received the highest points ahead of the [[Soviet Union at the 1960 Winter Olympics|Soviet Union]]'s [[Dmitriy Kochkin]] and [[Norway at the 1960 Winter Olympics|Norway]]'s [[Tormod Knutsen]].&lt;ref name=s106 /&gt; The cross-country part of the event took place at [[McKinney Creek Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;Squaw Valley Organizing Committee: 110&lt;/ref&gt; While Thoma won the discipline overall, Knutsen finished second overall ahead of the Soviet Union's [[Nikolai Gusakov]].&lt;ref name=s106 /&gt; In 1976, the US National Championships in Ski Jumping were held at the large hill, and was won by [[Jim Denney (ski jumper born 1957)|Jim Denney]].&lt;ref name=skisprungschanzen /&gt;

Pasiking designs have sacred allusions, although most are purely aesthetic. These artifacts, whether handwoven traditionally or with contemporary variations, are considered exemplars of functional basketry in the Philippines and among [[Filipinos]].&lt;ref&gt;The [http://www.google.com.ph/search?aq=f&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=pasiking NCI SF homepage] on pasiking.com&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Vicente4.jpg|thumb|A [[Manilan]] sporting a centuries-old variant of the Northern Philippine pasiking.|left]]The ritual pasiking of the [[Ifugao people#The Ifugao|Ifugao tribal group]] is called the ''inabnutan'', not to be confused with the more common ''bangeo''. Both of those types have palm bast weatherproofing.

The ritual pasiking of the [[Igorot#The Bontoc|Bontoc people]] is called the ''takba,'' and represents an ancestor figure, and active participant in ''begnas'' rituals.

Some of the Northern Philippine tribal groups called [[Igorots]] or Cordillerans&lt;ref&gt;Blog on the [http://ivegotmail.blogspot.com/2004/11/pasiking.html Igorots], plus a photo of an Igorot ''pasiking''&lt;/ref&gt; that weave pasiking are the [[Apayaos]] or [[Isneg]], the [[Tinguian]] of [[Abra (province)|Abra]] province, the [[Igorot#The Kalinga|Kalingas]] of [[Kalinga (province)|Kalinga]] province, the Gaddang, the Bugkalot, the Applai, the [[Igorot#The Bontoc|Bontocs]] of [[Bontoc, Mountain Province]], the Ilagod, the Bago, the [[Igorot#The Kankanaey|Kankana-ey]], the [[Balangao]], the [[Ibaloi]], the [[Ifugao people#The Ifugao|Ifugaos]], the Ikalahan, the Kalanguya, the Karao, and the Ilongots. It is also woven using [[rattan]] by non-Cordilleran persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Gascon |first=Melvin |date=27 May 2015 |title=Blind weaver’s masterpiece a tribute to Ifugao heritage |url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/693795/blind-weavers-masterpiece-a-tribute-to-ifugao-heritage |newspaper=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]] |location=Philippines |access-date=28 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Common materials used in construction are rattan and bamboo.  There are pasiking specimens utilizing deer hide (parfleche), wood, turtle shell, and crocodile skin. 

A deconstructed version of the pasiking, including dozens of variants, were exhibited in the [[Benedicto Cabrera|BenCab]] Museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=15 December 2014 |title=Gallery News: ‘Carrier of Tradition: An Exhibition of Northern Philippine Backpacks’ at BenCab Museum |url=http://www.philstar.com/arts-and-culture/2014/12/15/1402209/gallery-news-carrier-tradition-exhibition-northern-philippine |newspaper=[[The Philippine Star]] |location=Philippines |access-date=28 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are also 21st century pasiking that are made of recyclable materials like plastic cargo straps, canvas conveyor belts, and recycled detonation cord.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Lolarga |first=Elizabeth |date=21 May 2012 |title=Cool everyday objects bridge old, new in the Cordillera |url=http://lifestyle.inquirer.net/48955/cool-everyday-objects-bridge-old-new-in-the-cordillera |newspaper=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]] |location=Philippines |access-date=28 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s on through the 1980s, the pasiking has also been a symbol among Filipino students for nationalist activism.  There was a decline of making traditional bamboo crafts, including the pasiking, during the 1980s but in the mid-2010s, the industry of bamboo crafts came into resurgence with the help of the Philippines' [[Department of Trade and Industry (Philippines)|Department of Trade and Industry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Beleo |first=Erwin |date=26 November 2014 |title=Resurgent bamboo craft industry in far-flung village |url=http://www.mb.com.ph/resurgent-bamboo-craft-industry-in-far-flung-village/ |newspaper=[[Manila Bulletin]] |location=Philippines |access-date=28 October 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pikes Peak International Raceway''' ('''PPIR''') is a racetrack in a [[Colorado Springs]] annexed area of the [[Fountain, Colorado]], postal zone that by October 12, 1997, was "the fastest 1-mile paved oval anywhere".&lt;ref name=Bergsten1997&gt;{{Cite news |last=Bergsten |first=Tim |date=October 12, 1997 |title=PPIR races through 1st year, tunes up for next |newspaper=[[The Gazette (Colorado Springs)|The Gazette]] |quote=Myers, and Apollo Real Estate Advisory of New York, the track's co-owners, didn't borrow money to build PPIR.  Neither has a loan to pay.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The speedway hosted races in several series including the [[Indy Racing League]] and 2 [[NASCAR]] series ([[Nationwide Series|Busch]] and [[Camping World Truck Series|Truck]]) until operations were suspended 2005–08.  A wide variety of amateur racing groups use PPIR for racing and training, and many NASCAR teams use PPIR for testing.{{Citation needed|date=December 2013}} 

==History==
Racing in the [[Pikes Peak Region]] included 19th century horse tracks (e.g., to the west of Colorado Springs'  [[Antlers Hotel (Colorado)|Palmer House]] along [[Fountain Creek (Arkansas River)|Fountain Creek]] by 1882&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite map |year=1882 |title=Panoramic Bird's Eye View of Colorado Springs, Colorado City &amp; Manitou, Colo. |url=https://www.loc.gov/item/75693126 |publisher=J.

In 1938, a track was north of [[Alexander Aircraft Company|the Alexander Aircraft factory]] and {{circa|lk=no|[[World War II]]}} another was to the factory's southeast at the south end of the [[Nichols Field (airport)|Nichols Field]] taxiway.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Freeman |first=Paul |date=2013-10-13 |title=Colorado Springs area |url=http://www.airfields-freeman.com/CO/Airfields_CO_ColoradoSprings.htm#alexander |publisher=airfields-freeman.com|accessdate=2013-11-17 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On the [[U.S. Route 24 in Colorado|Pike's Peak Ocean-to-Occan Highway]]{{r|Directory1916}} west of the city was the end of the 1951 Colorado sports car rally (terminus at the [[Crystola, Colorado|Crystola Inn]]),{{r|RoadTrack1951}} a 1953 dirt [[dragstrip]] "some four miles east of Colorado Springs" was used for "the first statewide drag race",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Southworth |first=Bill |title=Colorado Conquest |journal= |quote=…through the efforts of the local Sea-Bee Reserve unit… Grading equipment was loaned by Douglas Jardine, a Colorado Springs contractor and commander of the unit. … president of the Cam Winders [club] "Our goal is to make Colorado Springs the mecca of all hot rodders in the Rocky Mountain area [by having] the strip paved…}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a stock car track was along Powers Road in the early 1960s.&lt;!--interview of Cold War military officer--&gt;  The "last local track" for auto racing east of the city through the late 1970s was the '''Colorado Springs International Speedway''' which "had crowds in the 3,000-4,000 range on summer weekends".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Routon |first=Ralph |date=May 29, 1997 |title=No telling how many will attend first races |newspaper=The Gazette}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Platte Avenue go-kart track closed {{circa|lk=no|1990}}, the greyhound track closed {{circa|lk=no|2005}} and is now an off track betting facility, and the [[List of cycling tracks and velodromes#USA|Olympic velodrome]] in [[Memorial Park, Colorado Springs|Memorial Park]] is a remaining racing venue within the city.

===Pikes Peak Meadows===
'''Pikes Peak Meadows''' was a dirt horse racing track facility opened in 1964{{r|Hartman1997}} {{convert|20|mi|abbr=on}} south of [[Colorado Springs]] and {{convert|25|mi|abbr=on}} north of [[Pueblo, Colorado]], with a large, blue, covered grandstand on the west.

===Speedway development===
In 1997, "[[Apollo Real Estate Advisors]] LP formed a joint venture January 30 with Raceway Associates, a partnership headed by California contractor and developer C.C. Myers Inc, to own and run the 1,300-acre" speedway complex.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Hellman |first=Wayne |title=Investors buy into race track |newspaper=Gazette Telegraph }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The asphalt track was constructed {{Convert|6|ft|abbr=on}} below the "normal ground level",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Bergsten |first=Tim |title=Completion of raceway on track for summer |newspaper=The Gazette |quote=Most of the bleacher structure that will seat 42,700 is in place … The bleachers wrap around the west side of the track, which was sunk 6 feet below the normal ground level to improve viewing.}}&lt;/ref&gt; C.C.

===International Speedway Corporation===
[[File:Pikes Peak International Raceway 2018.JPG|275px|thumb|right|The stands and part of the infield, viewed from the south]]
Earlier in 1996, a competing track near Denver in [[Adams County, Colorado]] was attempted by [[Penske Corporation|Penske Motorsports, Inc.]] which merged in 1999 with the [[International Speedway Corporation]].{{r|Jayski}} In 2002 ISC gained "the right of first refusal should PPIR owners decide to sell their 1,200-acre complex"{{r|Jayski}} and in October 2005 for $11 million,&lt;ref name=Bainbridge2006&gt;{{Cite news |last=Bainbridge |first=Jim |date=November 23, 2006 |title=PPIR may become a private racetrack |newspaper=The Gazette }}&lt;/ref&gt; "bought out the owners of Pikes Peak International Raceway"{{r|Jayski}} (racing operations were suspended  and the scoreboard was moved to [[Texas Motor Speedway]].)  In 2006, meetings "between attorneys representing [Commerce City, near Denver] and International Speedway Corporation"{{r|Jayski}} were conducted before ISC "announced in February [1997] that it was eyeing land in [[Commerce City]] as well as eastern Aurora for the track. It envision[ed] a $360 million to $400 million track and stadium that could hold 75,000 to 80,000 fans."{{r|Jayski}} A new opposition group, Commerce City Citizens and Business Alliance, endorsed anti-raceway candidates which won local elections, and in May 1997 "ISC executive Wesley Harris said the 1,300-acre parcel the company was considering near Denver International Airport was not compatible with its needs".{{r|Jayski}}  ISC sold PPIR in November 2006 (the purchase closed in the first quarter of 2007),{{r|Bainbridge2006}} and PPIR operations resumed in 2008.

===Current races===
On December 6, 2012, [[United States Auto Club|USAC]] announced that PPIR would be on the 2013 [[USAC Silver Crown Series|USAC Traxxas Silver Crown Series]] schedule.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usacracing.com/silvercrown_index/news_sc/5853.html 2013 Silver Crown Schedule]&lt;/ref&gt;  Pikes Peak International Raceway would host the richest event in [[SRL Southwest Tour]] history as announced on April 23, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.srlsouthwesttour.com/pikes-peak-international-raceway-to-host-richest-event-in-spears-southwest-tour-history/&lt;/ref&gt;  PPIR also hosts regional club road course races such as the National Auto Sport Association (NASA) and SCCA as well as local enthusiast events such as track days, drifting events, and car shows.

'''The Rackham Golf Course''' is a public golf course designed by [[Donald Ross (golfer)|Donald Ross]] located in [[Huntington Woods, Michigan]]. The grounds crew at Rackham maintains one, 18-hole course.

==History==
In 1924, [[Horace Rackham]] purchased acres of land in Huntington Woods, Michigan, near land owned by the Detroit Zoological Society. (Currently this land would be extending from the corner of I-696 and Woodward to I-696 and Scotia Road). Rackham promised to donate the land towards a zoo as long as Detroit voters approved of it. The voters did pass the proposal, and Rackham followed through on his promise and gave {{convert|22|acre|ha}} for a parking lot, and the rest for a public golf course to be built. In 1925, the course was complete. Designed by Donald Ross, who also designed the [[Detroit Golf Club]] and numerous other courses, created an 18-hole course open to the public. Rackham has also been named one of Donald Ross' ten best public golf courses. It has been the home of Ben Davis, one of the country's first African-American golf pros. Joe Louis, the famous boxer known as the "Brown Bomber", played the course on a regular basis back in his day. The historic original front 9 was closed in October 1983 for major revisions due to the encroachment of I-696 extending through the area. Major changes to the front 9-hole layout were completed about {{frac|2|1|2}} years later. The 7th &amp; 9th holes are the only two untouched front 9 holes remaining from the original Ross layout.&lt;ref&gt;[[Horace Rackham]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Course==
The course is 18 holes with a Par of 71. A total of 6,555 yards with a course rating is 70.8. There are no water hazards on the entire course. Golf Simulator in the Pro-Shop for the winter months! High Tech Golf Simulator, same as Jordan Speith uses.

'''Running shorts''' are a specialized form of [[shorts]] worn by [[Running|runners]].

== Materials ==
Running shorts are designed to facilitate comfort and free movement during exercise.  Their materials are lightweight and hard-wearing. Many running shorts include an inner lining that acts as underwear, so wearing separate underwear is not necessary. [[Polyester]] is a common fabric in running shorts.

== Variants ==
[[File:Ludovic and Lauren (8425515069).jpg|thumb|[[Marathon]] runners in running shorts]]

Many running shorts have a seam cut up the side of each leg to enable freer movement. Manufacturers define running shorts according to the length of the leg which is not cut. For example, a 3/4 seam means that 1/4 of the length is cut.

&lt;!-- (Commenting this out until the issue is resolved.) * "Full split shorts" are [shortest/longest - needs definition]--&gt;
* 1/2 split seam shorts are the shortest.
* 3/4 split seam shorts are short, but not as short as 1/2 split seam shorts.
* Square leg shorts have no split at all.

Longer shorts are not ideal for running.  A runner's stride may pull up the shorts' fabric, which can cause discomfort.  Nonetheless, some runners prefer longer shorts because they cover a greater portion of their legs.  

Some runners use athletic [[hot pants]] as running shorts. Like 1/2 split seam shorts, hot pants do not encumber leg movement.

[[Lycra]] running shorts are an alternative to conventional, polyester-based shorts. In most cases, they  reach the mid-thigh. They are skin-tight, so they allow for more flexible, unencumbered movement.

'''''The Burns-Johnson Fight''''' (or '''''Burns-Johnson Contest''''') is a 1908 documentary film of the boxing fight between [[Tommy Burns (boxer)|Tommy Burns]] and [[Jack Johnson (boxer)|Jack Johnson]] at [[Sydney Stadium]], Rushcutters Bay, on 26 December 1908 for the World Heavyweight Championship title, which Johnson won.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article126738480 |title=THE FIGHT. |newspaper=[[Sunday Times]] |issue=1197 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=27 December 1908 |accessdate=25 April 2016 |page=9 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was produced by [[Charles Cozens Spencer]] at the behest of the fight's promoted [[Hugh D. McIntosh]].

Some footage from the film survives today, chiefly of that showing some of the middle rounds of the 14-round fight.

==Plot==
According to newspaper reports the film showed the following:
*the champions training, swimming, ball punching, sparring, skipping, motor pacing (Burns at Medlow, Johnson at Botany);
*the crowd arriving at the Stadium;
*interior preparations;
*the ring;
*the climax;
*view afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article85917645 |title=Advertising. |newspaper=[[The Cumberland Argus and Fruitgrowers' Advocate]] |location=Parramatta, NSW |date=10 February 1909 |accessdate=21 February 2015 |page=3 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="THE BURNS-JOHNSON FIGHT"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article57004763 |title=THE BURNS-JOHNSON FIGHT. |newspaper=[[The Register (Adelaide)|The Register]] |location=Adelaide |date=28 December 1908 |accessdate=21 February 2015 |page=10 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article158875386 |title=LYRIC THEATRE. |newspaper=Southern Times|location=Bunbury, WA |date=4 March 1909 |accessdate=21 February 2015 |page=5 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to Hugh MacIntosh:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The show lasts two hours, and not only is the whole fight presented in detail with all the doings between the rounds, but films are shown depicting Johnson and Burns going through their training work, swimming, hall-punching, boxing, massaging, and both. The figures are life-size and there is a wonderful absence of flicker. Then there are films showing the crowds flocking to and from the stadium. What a crowd it was! Nothing has ever been seen like it in Australia.&lt;ref name="hugh"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Production==
[[Hugh D. MacIntosh]] promoted the fight and was also involved in distribution of the film in Queensland in association with [[E. J. Carroll]]. Cameras, films and chemicals worth £2,000 were imported into Australian from England along with two camera experts, who took part in filming with two Australian camera operators. A tower was built 16 feet high to capture vision.&lt;ref name="courier"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article19554965 |title=BURNSJOHNSON PICTURES. |newspaper=[[The Brisbane Courier]] |date=19 December 1908 |accessdate=21 February 2015 |page=16 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hugh McIntosh arranged for footage to be taken of Burns and Johnson training and this was shown prior to the fight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article102793099 |title=THE STRUTTER'S PAGE. |newspaper=[[The Newsletter: an Australian Paper for Australian People]] |location=Sydney |date=12 December 1908 |accessdate=21 February 2015 |page=3 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MacIntosh later said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;We went to no end of trouble to secure a good film, and had three machines and operator, at work. One of these latter we imported from a leading French firm to ensure the best talent the world could provide us with, and the importation of this operator and his assistants cost us £500. As events determined, the expense was an unnecessary one; for the best of the three films was the one taken by Mr Spencer, the Australian operator... I am of opinion that  the French experts did not fully understand the atmospheric conditions of Australia, and, though we have their films as a standby, it is the one taken by Mr Spencer which we are showing all over the world.&lt;ref name="hugh"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article148615994 |title=THE GREAT FIGHT. |newspaper=Eastern Districts Chronicle (York, WA : 1877–1927) |location=York, WA |date=16 January 1909 |accessdate=21 February 2015 |page=3 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Various newspaper advertisements for the film claim the "general manager" of the movie was [[Alfred Rolfe (director)|Alfred Rolfe]], an actor and stage manager who later made a number of films for Spencer. It is possible this means Rolfe directed, or was involved in the film's New South Wales distribution.&lt;ref name="rolfe"/&gt;

[[Raymond Longford]] was also purportedly involved in filming.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aso.gov.au/titles/historical/boxing-1908-johnson-vs-burns/notes/ film information] at [[Australian Screen Online]]&lt;/ref&gt; However this is unlikely as Longford was acting on the stage in Mackay Queensland in December 1908.&lt;ref name="tony"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article170794152 |title=THE THEATRE. |newspaper=[[Daily Mercury]] |issue=1021 |location=Queensland, Australia |date=28 December 1908 |accessdate=25 April 2016 |page=2 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was also known as '''''Burns vs Johnson'''''.

==Release==
The film was shown almost immediately after the fight, debuting in Sydney at Rushcutter's Bay Stadium on 28 December 1908, to a crowd between 7,000 and 8,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article113773948 |title=BOXING. |newspaper=[[The Evening News (Sydney)|Evening News]] |issue=12,965 |location=New South Wales, Australia |date=29 December 1908 |accessdate=25 April 2016 |page=2 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was distributed throughout the country. It was also seen overseas.&lt;ref name="THE BURNS-JOHNSON FIGHT"/&gt;
===Box Office===
The movie was a considerable financial success. According to MacIntosh, the film took £2,114 in one week in Sydney, and £1,738 in Melbourne over four nights.&lt;ref name="hugh"/&gt;

Theatrical manager Allan Hamilton secured rights to distribute the film in Victoria, Tasmania, South Australia and Western Australia for a reported £1,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article5150286 |title=NEW SOUTH WALES. |newspaper=[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|The Advertiser]] |location=Adelaide |date=5 December 1908 |accessdate=21 February 2015 |page=12 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article77111696 |title=BURNS V.

===Critical Reception===
According to a contemporary review of a packed out screening:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The various movements in the game were watched with much concern, and the good and bad moves groaned at or cheered according to deserts, while laughter was provoked at frequent intervals by the half-comical episodes that occurred. To make the show realistic, the usual noises, such as the hounding of a gong, and the hooting of tho crowd when the police stopped the light, were provided, and so well was this latter piece co of stage management arranged that the audience on Saturday night, mistaking the bogus hoots for the genuine article, took up the refrain and themselves became hootingly demonstrative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article120630330 |title=MELBOURNE MEMS. |newspaper=[[The Referee (newspaper)|The Referee]]|location=Sydney |date=6 January 1909 |accessdate=21 February 2015 |page=10 |via=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''White City Stadium''' in [[White City, London|White City]], [[London]], England, was built for the [[1908 Summer Olympics]], and hosted the finish of the first modern marathon. It also hosted swimming, speedway, boxing, show jumping, athletics, stock car racing, concerts and a match at the [[1966 FIFA World Cup|1966 World Cup]]. From 1927 to 1984, it was a venue for greyhound racing, hosting the [[English Greyhound Derby]].

==History==
Designed by the engineer [[John Webster|J. J. Webster]] and completed in 10 months by [[George Wimpey]],&lt;ref&gt;White, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; on part of the site of the [[Franco-British Exhibition (1908)|Franco-British Exhibition]], this stadium with a seating capacity of 68,000 was opened by [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|King Edward VII]] on 27 April 1908 after the first stanchion had been placed in position by Lady Desborough on 2 August 1907. The cost of construction was [[Pound sterling|£]]60,000.&lt;ref name=Zarnowski&gt;{{cite journal | last = Zarnowski | first = C. Frank |date=Summer 1992 | title = A Look at Olympic Costs | journal = Citius, Altius, Fortius | volume = 1 | issue = 1 | pages = 16–32 | url = http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/JOH/JOHv1n1/JOHv1n1f.pdf | accessdate =24 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon completion, the stadium had a running track {{convert|24|ft|m|abbr=on|adj=mid|wide}} and three laps to the mile (536 m); outside there was a {{convert|35|ft|m|adj=mid|-wide}}, {{convert|660|yd|m|adj=on}} cycle track. The infield included a swimming and diving pool.

[[File:White City Stadium 1908.jpg|thumb|350px|The White City Stadium during the 1908 Summer Olympics]]
Many events of the [[1908 Olympics]] were at the stadium itself whereas nowadays there are many arenas. [[Rugby union at the 1908 Summer Olympics|The Olympic rugby union final]] between [[Australia]] and [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain]] was held in the stadium on 26 October 1908&lt;ref&gt;The First Hundred Years - The story of rugby in Cornwall by Tom Salmon 1983 (published by the Cornwall RFU)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.la84foundation.org/6oic/OfficialReports/1908/1908.pdf 1908 Summer Olympics official report. pp. 32-5, 40.]&lt;/ref&gt; and events such as archery and gymnastics took place at White City, while some others took place at [[Queens Club]].  Swimming was held at White City, in a 100-yard pool dug in the infield.  The position of the finish line for the [[marathon]] in the 1908 Summer Olympics is commemorated by a marker in the plaza that now stands there. The distance of the modern marathon was fixed at these Games and calculated from the start of the race at [[Windsor Castle]] to a point in front of the royal box. The medal table for the [[1908 Summer Olympics]] is also listed on a nearby wall.&lt;ref&gt;The photographing of the plaques is not allowed without prior permission.&lt;/ref&gt;

The original running track continued in use until 1914. There were attempts to sell the stadium in 1922, but several athletes in the team for the [[1924 Summer Olympics]] used it for training.

In 1926 the GRA ([[Greyhound Racing Association]]) took over the stadium and in 1927, the track was grassed over for [[greyhound racing]] and [[motorcycle speedway|speedway]]. They built new covered terracing and a restaurant. From 1927 until its closure it hosted weekly greyhound meetings and was considered the top greyhound track in Britain. It hosted the sport's premier event, the [[English Greyhound Derby]], until 1984. Just before and after the Second World War attendances were huge, a record 92,000 spectators attended the 1939 Derby final.

In 1931, a 440yd running track was installed for the [[Amateur Athletic Association]] Championships, held there from 1932 to 1970. Besides the AAA championships, major athletics events, including international matches, were held at the stadium.  In 1954 in a match against Russia [[Christopher Chataway]] broke the world 5000m record running against [[Vladimir Kuts]]. The one mile world record was broken there by [[Derek Ibbotson]] in 1957. In 1934 the [[1934 British Empire Games|second British Empire Games]] and the [[1934 Women's World Games|fourth Women's World Games]] were held at the venue.

Also in 1931, [[Queens Park Rangers F.C.]] began the first of two spells playing at the stadium, until 1933 (the second spell was from 1962–63). QPR eventually decided against a permanent move to White City and stayed at [[Loftus Road]].
 
[[File:Canada-United States football game at White City Stadium, London, 1944.jpg|thumb|Team captains shake hands after a Canada-United States American football game at White City Stadium, 14 February 1944]]
Between 1932 and 1958 the stadium hosted major British boxing events, with attendances peaking as high as 90,000 for the second meeting between [[Len Harvey]] and [[Jack Petersen]] in 1934. The first major fight at the stadium was Len Harvey’s unsuccessful challenge for the NBA Middleweight Championship versus [[Marcel Thil]] of France. Future heavyweight champion [[Primo Carnera]] suffered his only defeat on British soil here when he lost to Canadian [[Larry Gains]] in May 1932. Other important fighters to appear at White City include [[Jock McAvoy]], [[Don Cockell]], [[Nino Valdez]], [[Henry Cooper]] and [[Terry Downes]].

In 1933, Wigan Highfield, a [[rugby league]] side, nearly became bankrupt. White City Company, owners of the stadium, decided to move the club to [[White City, London|White City]]. Previously, only [[rugby union]] had been popular in southern England, professional [[rugby league]] being the preserve of northern  towns and cities. [[Liverpool Stanley#Wigan Highfield - 1880-1895 and 1902-1933|Wigan Highfield]]  became [[Liverpool Stanley#London Highfield - 1933|London Highfield]] with their debts paid. Their first try was scored by George "Porky" Davies, who went on to play for [[Liverpool Stanley#Liverpool Stanley - 1934-1951 and the second Liverpool City - 1951-1968|Liverpool Stanley]] and then [[St Helens R.F.C.|St. Helens]] from 1938 to 1947. The White City Company lost money on the venture and decided not to continue with rugby league. London Highfield was the precursor to [[London Broncos]], the current leading rugby league club in London.

In 1966, [[Wembley Stadium (1924)|Wembley's]] owner's refusal to cancel regular greyhound racing meant the match between [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]] and [[France national football team|France]] in the [[1966 FIFA World Cup]] was played at White City. The game attracted 45,662 fans.

The stadium was demolished in 1985 and the site is now occupied by [[BBC White City]].

==Greyhound Racing==
{{main article|White City Greyhounds}}

White City Stadium was principally used for [[greyhound racing]] for the majority of its existence. The first greyhound meeting took place on 20 June 1927.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.stainforthonline.co.uk/2001/meadow_court_racing_history.htm | title = A Concise History Greyhound Racing | accessdate = 2012-08-07 | publisher = Stainforth OnLine}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The stadium became the Mecca of greyhound racing with tens of thousands of spectators attending meetings on a regular basis, particularly in the 1940s, and 1950s. A crowd of 92,000 attended the [[1939 English Greyhound Derby]] final.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dack|first=Barrie|title=Greyhound Derby, the first 60 years|year=1990|publisher=Ringpress Books|isbn=0-948955-36-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Speedway==
The [[motorcycle speedway|speedway track]] at White City was {{convert|380|m|yd|abbr=off}} in length.

The White City stadium first held open speedway meetings in 1928 before the start of the Southern League, in 1929. A team from the stadium known as White City (London) entered the 1929 Southern League where they finished in 7th place out of 11 teams (after Birmingham (Hall Green) resigned for the league after racing 7 league matches). The White City team were due to race in the 1930 Southern League, but they withdrew from the league before it started. The stadium then ran once again using an Open Licence and held occasional one-off meetings between (1953–58, 1961) until a new league team was formed, from the Oxford 'Rebels' in 1976.

From 1976 until 1978, the stadium was home to [[White City Rebels]] speedway team.&lt;ref&gt;Bamford, R &amp; Jarvis J.(2001). ''Homes of British Speedway''.  {{ISBN|0-7524-2210-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team closed after only three seasons due to poor crowds levels, despite finishing the 1977 season as champions of the [[Speedway British League|British League]]. The Rebels' most notable rider was [[England national speedway team|England]] International [[Gordon Kennett]]. Other notable riders were [[Steve Weatherley]], [[Trevor Geer]], [[Poland]]'s [[Marek Cieślak]] and multiple [[Finland|Finnish]] champion [[Kai Niemi]] and [[Colin Watson (speedway rider)|Colin Watson]] (pre war).&lt;ref&gt;Jacobs, N. ''Speedway in London'', {{ISBN|0-7524-2221-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1979-83 the stadium once again raced using an Open Licence hosting a number of high-profile [[Speedway World Championship]] qualifying rounds, including the Overseas and [[Intercontinental Final|Intercontinental]] Finals during the 1970s, and 1980s. It also hosted the Final of the [[Speedway World Team Cup]] in [[1976 Speedway World Team Cup|1976]], [[1979 Speedway World Team Cup|1979]] and [[1982 Speedway World Team Cup|1982]].

Following the end of speedway at the [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]] after the [[1981 Individual Speedway World Championship|1981 World Final]], White City became the home of international speedway in Great Britain until it was closed in 1984. Following this international speedway moved out of London and north to the [[Odsal Stadium]] in [[Bradford]].

==Appearances in the media==

The White City Stadium features in the climax to the 1950 film ''[[The Blue Lamp]]''. It also appears in an episode, named "Man From the Dead", of 1960s television spy series ''[[Man in a Suitcase]]'' and was used in the 1973 film ''[[Steptoe and Son Ride Again]]''. Some sections of the video for [[The Human League]] single "[[Life On Your Own]]" were shot in the stadium in 1984, just a few months before its demolition.

The stadium was the location of a famous public outburst by [[Ray Davies]] of [[The Kinks]] during a July 1973 performance.&lt;ref name="Hinman 174"&gt;Hinman, Doug (2004). p.&amp;nbsp;174&lt;/ref&gt; Davies swore onstage,&lt;ref name="Days"&gt;Hollingsworth, Roy (21 July 1973). "Thank you for the days, Ray". ''[[Melody Maker]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; and at the show's conclusion, as pretaped music played on the sound system, declared his retirement from the group.&lt;ref name="Hinman 174"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Days"/&gt; He subsequently collapsed after a drug overdose and was rushed to hospital.&lt;ref name="Hinman 174"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Independent"&gt;George, Chris (27 August 1994). "The Kitchen Sink Kink". ''[[The Independent]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; He would eventually recover and return to recording with The Kinks.&lt;ref&gt;Portions of the preceding paragraph copied from the Wikipedia article [[The Kinks]], section "Theatrical Incarnation: 1973–1976"&lt;/ref&gt;

At a [[David Cassidy]] show on 26 May 1974, 800 people were injured in a crush at the front of the stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = 14 girls hurt in crush at Cassidy concert | date = 27 May 1974 | work = The Times }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thirty were taken to hospital, and one, 14-year-old Bernadette Whelan, died on 30 May from injuries.

[[The Pogues]] made a song about the stadium and its demolition, called "White City". It can be found on their 1989 album ''[[Peace and Love (The Pogues album)|Peace and Love]]''.
