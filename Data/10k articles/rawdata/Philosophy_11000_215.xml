'''"A Few Words on Non-Intervention"''' is a short essay by the philosopher, politician and economist, [[John Stuart Mill]]. It was written in 1859&lt;ref&gt;First appeared in ''[[Fraser's Magazine]]'' in 1859.&lt;/ref&gt; in the context of the construction of the [[Suez Canal]] and the recent [[Crimean War]]. The essay addresses the question of under what circumstances states should be allowed to intervene in the sovereign affairs of another country.

==Content==
Mill's argument begins with a discussion of Britain's place in the world, in which Mill right away asserts that Britain, unlike other countries, never ventures into the outside world with an imperialistic aim; rather, when it does venture out, it is to improve the world, end conflicts, bring civilization, etc.: "Any attempt [Britain] makes to exert influence...is rather in the service of others, than of itself".  Writing for a contemporary British middle and upper class audience, Mill gives an overview of some world events that were important for that particular time. 

The main arguments for and against non-intervention are found in the second half of the script.

&lt;blockquote&gt;There seems to be no little need that the whole doctrine of non-interference with foreign nations should be reconsidered, if it can be said to have as yet been considered as a really moral question at all... To go to war for an idea, if the war is aggressive, not defensive, is as criminal as to go to war for territory or revenue; for it is as little justifiable to force our ideas on other people, as to compel them to submit to our will in any other respect. But there assuredly are cases in which it is allowable to go to war, without having been ourselves attacked, or threatened with attack; and it is very important that nations should make up their minds in time, as to what these cases are... To suppose that the same international customs, and the same rules of international morality, can obtain between one civilized nation and another, and between civilized nations and barbarians, is a grave error...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Mill's opinion (in 1859) barbarous peoples were found in [[Algeria]] and [[India]] where the French and British armies had been involved. First, he argued that with "barbarians" there is no hope for "reciprocity", an international fundamental. Second, barbarians are apt to benefit from civilised intervenors, said Mill, citing Roman conquests of [[Gaul]], Spain, [[Numidia]] and [[Dacia]]. Barbarians,

&lt;blockquote&gt;have no rights as a nation, except a right to such treatment as may, at the earliest possible period, fit them for becoming one. The only moral laws for the relation between a civilized and a barbarous government, are the universal rules of morality between man and man.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Similar arguments can today be found in theory on intervention in [[failed state]]s. Of more widespread relevance, Mill discussed the position between "civilized peoples".

&lt;blockquote&gt;The disputed question is that of interfering in the regulation of another country's internal concerns; the question whether a nation is justified in taking part, on either side, in the civil wars or party contests of another: and chiefly, whether it may justifiably aid the people of another country in struggling for liberty; or may impose on a country any particular government or institutions, either as being best for the country itself, or as necessary for the security of its neighbours.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Mill brushes over the situation of intervening on the side of governments who are trying to oppress an uprising of their own, saying "government which needs foreign support to enforce obedience from its own citizens, is one which ought not to exist". In the case however of a civil war, where both parties seem at fault, Mill argues that third parties are entitled to demand that the conflicts shall cease. He then moves to the more contentious situation of wars for liberation.

&lt;blockquote&gt;When the contest is only with native rulers, and with such native strength as those rulers can enlist in their defence, the answer I should give to the question of the legitimacy of intervention is, as a general rule, No. The reason is, that there can seldom be anything approaching to assurance that intervention, even if successful, would be for the good of the people themselves. The only test possessing any real value, of a people’s having become fit for popular institutions, is that they, or a sufficient portion of them to prevail in the contest, are willing to brave labour and danger for their liberation. I know all that may be said, I know it may be urged that the virtues of freemen cannot be learnt in the school of slavery, and that if a people are not fit for freedom, to have any chance of becoming so they must first be free. And this would be conclusive, if the intervention recommended would really give them freedom. But the evil is, that if they have not sufficient love of liberty to be able to wrest it from merely domestic oppressors, the liberty which is bestowed on them by other hands than their own, will have nothing real, nothing permanent. No people ever was and remained free, but because it was determined to be so...&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Responses==
[[Noam Chomsky]] has made reference to Mill's essay in a number of his books, including ''[[Failed States (book)|Failed States: The Abuse of Power and the Assault on Democracy]]'' (2006), ''[[Hegemony or Survival: America's Quest for Global Dominance]]'' (2002) and ''Peering into the Abyss of the Future'' (2002). Chomsky writes that even "individuals of the highest intelligence and moral integrity succumb to the pathology" of taking exception to universal human standards.&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky (2006) p. 104-5&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Libertarianism|Libertarian]] historian Joseph R. Stromberg states that J.S. Mill's imperialistic views are incompatible with his alleged [[classical liberalism|liberalism]], since maintenance of the [[British Empire]] would require government repression.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.antiwar.com/stromberg/s051802.html ''The Old Cause'', "John Stuart Mill and Liberal Imperialism", May 18, 2002, antiwar.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{hatnote|This article deals primarily with Acquired characteristics by humans. You can improve this article by adding information about Acquired characteristics by plants and non-human animals.}}
An '''acquired characteristic''' is a [[Heredity|non-heritable]] change in a function or structure of a living [[biotic material]] caused after birth by disease, injury, accident, deliberate modification, variation, repeated use, disuse, or misuse, or other environmental influences. Acquired traits, which is [[synonym]]ous with acquired characteristics, are not [[August Weismann#Experiments on the inheritance of mutilations|passed on]] to offspring through reproduction alone.

The changes that constitute acquired characteristics can have many manifestations and degrees of visibility but they all have one thing in common: they change a facet of a living organisms' function or structure after the organism has left the womb.

*The children of former [[bodybuilder]] [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] may have highly developed or otherwise above average musculature.{{citation needed|reason=This claim needs a reliable source; acquired characteristics do not change the inheritable genes in gametes.|date=August 2015}}
*"Lucky", an adult, three-legged dog who got her name after surviving being hit by a car when she was a pup, just gave birth to five puppies. None had [[limp]]s, malformed/abnormal legs, or were missing a leg.
*[[Bonsai]] are normal plants that have been grown to remain small through [[Bonsai cultivation and care|cultivation]] techniques.

Acquired characteristics can be minor and temporary like bruises, [[blister]]s, shaving body hair, and body building. Permanent but inconspicuous or invisible ones are [[LASIK|corrective]] eye surgery and organ [[Transplant surgery|transplant]] or [[List of surgical procedures|removal]].
Semi-permanent but inconspicuous or invisible traits are [[vaccination]]s and [[laser hair removal]]. [[Perm (hairstyle)|Perms]], [[tattoo]]s, [[scar]]s, and [[amputation]]s are semi-permanent and highly visible.

Applying [[Cosmetics|makeup]] and nailpolish, [[Hair coloring|dying]] one's hair or applying [[henna]] to the skin, and [[tooth whitening]] are  '''not''' examples of acquired traits. They change the appearance of a facet of an organism, but do not change the structure or functionality.

[[Inheritance of acquired characters]] was historically proposed by renowned [[theorist]]s such as [[Hippocrates]], [[Aristotle]], and French [[naturalist]] [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]]. Conversely, this [[hypothesis]] was denounced by other renowned theorists such as [[Charles Darwin]].
Today, although [[Lamarckism]] is generally discredited, there is still debate on whether ''some'' acquired characteristics in organisms are actually inheritable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pmc = 1320859|title=The Inheritance of Acquired Characteristics |

Acquired characteristics, by definition, are characteristics that are gained by an organism after birth as a result of external influences or its own activities that change its structure or function and cannot be inherited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/acquired+characteristic |title=Acquired characteristic - definition of acquired characteristic by The Free Dictionary |publisher=Thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2015-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/acquired+characteristic?qsrc=2446 |title=Acquired characteristic &amp;#124; Define Acquired characteristic at Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date= |accessdate=2015-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Acquired+characteristics |title=Acquired characteristics &amp;#124; definition of Acquired characteristics by Medical dictionary |publisher=Medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2015-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, every condition an organism is born with must be considered an inherited characteristic.

[[Heredity|Inherited characteristics]], by definition, are characteristics that are gained or predisposed to by an organism as a result of genetic transmission from its parents and will be passed to the organism's offspring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Inherited+trait |title=Inherited trait - definition of Inherited trait by The Free Dictionary |publisher=Thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2015-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/inherited+character?qsrc=2446T |title=Inherited character &amp;#124; Define Inherited character at Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date= |accessdate=2015-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Inherited+trait |title=Inherited trait &amp;#124; definition of inherited trait by Medical dictionary |publisher=Medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2015-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, every condition an organism does not gain or develop because of inheritance of its parents' genetic [[Gene|information]] must be considered an acquired characteristic.

===Eye color===
It is fairly common for [[mammal]]ian eyes to [[Eye color#Changes in eye color|change]] color in the first years of life. This happens, with human infants and kittens being some well-known examples, because the eyes of the baby, just like the rest of its body, are still developing. This change can be as simple as blue to brown, or can involve multiple color changes in which neither the child's parents nor his/her doctors know when the changes will stop and what the final eye color will be.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whattoexpect.com/first-year/ask-heidi/baby-eye-color.aspx |title=Baby's Eye Color |website=What To Expect|date= |accessdate=2015-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Changes in [[eye color]] signal changes in the arrangement and concentration of [[pigment]] in the [[iris (anatomy)|iris]], which is an example of [[structural color]]. Even though this change happens after birth, it is strictly as result of genes. While changes in eye appearance (and function, and structure) that occur because of acquired characteristics like injury, illness, old age, or malnutrition are definitely acquired characteristics, the infantile color change as described above is ''usually'' considered inherited.

=== Certain genetic conditions ===
When diseases are caused by environmental influences, such as [[iodine deficiency]] or [[lead poisoning]], their resultant symptoms are [[Wiktionary:unequivocal|unequivocally]] agreed to be acquired characteristics. However, it is debatable whether changes in bodily functions due to disorders that are [[Genetic predisposition|partly]] or wholly [[Genetic disorder|genetic]] in origin are actually "acquired".

Wholly genetic disorders, such as [[Huntington's disease|Huntingtons]], are ticking time-bombs that are inherited from parents' genes and are present before birth but the symptoms that develop, aka are "acquired", after birth are simply delayed manifestations of the inherited trait.

Disorders that are partially genetic, such as [[Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis|ALS]] and [[Allergy|allergies]], mean the organism has inherited a [[Genetic predisposition|predisposition]] to develop, aka "acquire", a certain condition but that inherited increased likelihood can be reduced or further increased [[sufficient causes|depending]] on acquired [[Host factor|characteristics]] of the organism.

===De novo mutations===
New mutations, (often [[Somatic (biology)|somatic]], spontaneous and sporadic), not inherited from either parent are called [[:wikt:de novo|de novo]] mutations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zhao |first1=Xiaoyue |last2=Leotta |first2=Anthony |last3=Kustanovich |first3=Vlad |last4=Lajonchere |first4=Clara |last5=Geschwind |first5=Daniel H. |last6=Law |first6=Kiely |last7=Law |first7=Paul |last8=Qiu |first8=Shanping |last9=Lord |first9=Catherine |last10=Sebat |first10=Jonathan |last11=Ye |first11=Kenny |last12=Wigler |first12=Michael |title=A unified genetic theory for sporadic and inherited autism |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=104 |issue=31 |pages=12831–6 |year=2007 |pmid=17652511 |pmc=1933261 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0705803104 |bibcode=2007PNAS..10412831Z |jstor=25436390 |laysummary=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/07/070724113757.htm |laysource=ScienceDaily |laydate=July 26, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The consensus on whether certain prenatal spontaneous [[mutation]]s and [[genetic disorder]]s that occur as a result of [[Meiosis|meiotic]] and [[Chromosome abnormality|chromosome]] errors&lt;ref name="New Genetic Risk Factor"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2010/11/101104154221.htm |title="New Genetic Risk Factor for Both Autism and Schizophrenia" |quote="Researchers have uncovered a prominent genetic risk factor for autism spectrum disorders and schizophrenia.

Mutations and meiotic errors can be considered inherited since the organism is [[Non-communicable disease#Inherited diseases|born]] with them ''in its genes'', but they can also be seen as [[Prenatal development|prenatal]] acquired characteristics since they are ''not actually inherited'' from its parents.&lt;ref name="New Model For Autism"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2007/07/070724113757.htm |title="New Model For Autism Suggests Women Carry The Disorder And Explains Age As A Risk Factor" |quote="Spontaneous mutations are changes in a chromosome that alter genes. Germ-line mutations are newly acquired in a germ cell of a parent, and sometimes are transmitted to offspring at conception. ... "The fact that germ-line mutations increase with age places older parents at a higher risk of having children with autism..." said CSHL co-author of the study [Dr.] Michael Wigler. ...

=== Prenatal conditions===
The definitions of inherited and acquired characteristics leave a [[Wiktionary:gray area|gray area]] for [[trauma (medicine)|trauma]], pre-existing and gestational maternal conditions that affect the fetus, as well as chemical and [[pathogen]] exposures and trauma that happen before and [[Birth trauma (physical)|while]] an organism is [[childbirth|born]], such as [[AIDS]], [[syphilis]], [[Hepatitis B]], [[chickenpox]], [[rubella]], unregulated [[gestational diabetes]], and [[fetal alcohol syndrome]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.noah-health.org/en/pregnancy/problems/problems/disorders/index.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120501043359/http://www.noah-health.org/en/pregnancy/problems/problems/disorders/index.html |date=May 1, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most infections won't affect a fetus if the pregnant mother contracts it, but some can be transmitted to babies via the [[placenta]] or during birth, and others cause more severe symptoms in pregnant women or can cause complications to the pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.babycenter.com/0_infections-that-can-affect-pregnancy_9223.bc |title=Infections that can affect pregnancy |website=BabyCenter |date= |accessdate=2015-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==
The [[World Health Organization]] defines [[health]] as a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being, and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|WHO Maternal health}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Acquired characteristics don't need to affect the health of an organism, (a scar, [[Sun tanning|suntan]], or [[Perm (hairstyle)|perm]]) but examples that do are often the first that come to mind when thinking of acquired characteristics since they are the easiest to observe and the ones that we, ourselves, are most familiar with.

=== Physical ===
Physical acquired characteristics can stem from various environmental influences such as disease, [[Body modification|modification]], injury, and regular or infrequent use of body parts.

=== Mental ===
Mental traits are acquired by learning and adapting native traits to the environment of the individual.

=== Mind-body correlation ===
Many acquired characteristics, such as injuries and diseases, directly affect only the [[Mental health|mind]] but indirectly affect the body or directly affect only the body but indirectly affect the mind.

Suppose you develop an [[Speech and language pathology in school settings#Articulation disorders|articulation disorder]] [[Component causes|after being hit]] in the head with a [[fastball]] from a [[Minor league baseball|Pro]] baseball pitcher. Once your [[concussion]] wears off, this is your ''only'' [[symptom]]. There's nothing wrong with your body, and nothing wrong with most of your mind but you [[stutter]] and [[Slur (phonology)|slur]] and mispronounce your words so that people have a very hard time understanding you.

How would such a condition affect your life if you were a child?
A child would be teased mercilessly by peers and have trouble communicating with friends and family.

A student would not be able to communicate easily with classmates ([[Collaboration|collaborative]] assignments), teachers, tutors, and certain classes (choir, public speaking).

What if you had a job where you needed to be able to talk to people? You wouldn't be able to easily talk to customers, other employees, or your boss. You couldn't answer phones or make calls, greet customers, do presentations.
You couldn't call your pet's name. You wouldn't even be able to use a [[fast food]] [[drive-through]] or tell your waitress what you wanted to order! You couldn't say, "I love you," to your child, parent, or [[significant other]].

How would you [[Coping (psychology)|cope]] with the [[functional disorder]]? With the changes and the stress those changes caused?

The example in the above link deals with the loss of a single mental function. Imagine what would happen if a part of your [[Physical fitness|body]] stopped [[functional disorder|working]]. Even something as simple as a broken [[Phalanx bone|finger]] causes many changes in lifestyle to compensate for the difference in function: writing, typing, drawing, driving, [[hobby|hobbies]] like gardening, fishing, or sports, using video game and TV controls, texting and dialing phone numbers, using [[cutlery]] to eat, opening a bag of chips or soda can, preparing food for yourself or your family, playing with your child or pet, unlocking and opening doors, bathing, brushing your teeth and hair, dressing yourself, typing your shoes, and more.

{{Details|topic=stress and the relationship between mind and body|Stress (biology)|Stress (physiology)|Stress (psychological)|Quality of life|Mind-body interventions|:Category:Stress}}

The person unable to pronounce words clearly would suffer additional stress, [[anxiety]], [[frustration]], and emotional upset from his functional limitation. There would be anxiety over financial hardships like bills from medical [[Physical examination|exams]] and [[Medical test|tests]], and a possible [[leave of absence]] or [[Involuntary termination|termination]] from work.
Physical effects of your articulation disorder could be paper cuts from your notepad, headaches over the stress, stubbed toes and sprained ankles from rushing to where you accidentally left you notepad, pulling a muscle from hauling a laptop around, etc. Worry could induce [[ulcer]]s.
If you have to cut back on [[Consumption (economics)|spending]], your (and your family's) nutrition could suffer. There would be less money for fine dining, going out with friends, and indulging in toys and hobbies.

Those close to you - family, friends, lovers - would be negatively affected by your limitation and your relationship with them would suffer as well.

== Origin ==
There are four main types of disease: pathogenic disease, deficiency disease, hereditary disease, and physiological disease.

=== Prenatal ===
[[Congenital disorder]]s, known more commonly as birth defects, are DEFINITION.

It is possible for an unborn child to contract [[fetal disease]]s and [[perinatal infection]]s.

[[:Category:Disorders originating in the perinatal period]]

==== Trauma ====
Suppose a pregnant woman is shot in her [[abdomen]] and the bullet hits the [[Fetus (biology)|fetus]], causing a non-[[death|fatal]] injury. Depending on the length of time between injury and birth, the baby could be born either with a still-healing wound or with a fully healed scar.
Regardless of its state of [[healing]], the gunshot wound could be considered an inherited characteristic, since the baby is born with the condition, or could be considered an acquired characteristic, since the condition did not happen as a result of genes inherited from its parents.

The gray area is that a prenatal gunshot wound obviously isn't an inherited, ''genetic'' condition but it can't be an acquired trait because it didn't happen ''after'' the baby's birth.
{{See also|Acquired disorder|:Category:Birth trauma|Prenatal and perinatal psychology}}

==== Chemical exposure ====
{{main|Prenatal exposure#Exposure to toxins}}
'''[[Hormone]]s''' are chemicals released by a cell or a gland in one part of the body that affect cells in other parts of the organism.

{{Details|topic=how hormones can affect fetal development|Prenatal testosterone transfer|Freemartin|Endocrine disruptor|s, Psychoneuroendocrinology|Prenatal hormones and sexual orientation}}

'''[[Drug]]s''' are any substance that, when absorbed into the body of a living organism, alter normal bodily function. Drugs can be legal and be used as is medically [[Pharmaceutical drug|prescribed]] by a doctor or be [[Illegal drug trade|illegal]] to buy, sell, possess, and administer. They can be naturally occurring (such as [[caffeine]] and [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]]) or man-made (such as [[Chlorpromazine]]). Both legal and illegal drugs can be [[Recreational drug use|misused]] and [[Substance abuse|abused]]. They have varying levels of [[Substance dependence|dependence]] and some can cause [[addiction]].

=== Disease ===
[[Disease]] is any condition that impairs the normal [[Physical fitness|physical]] or [[Mental disorder|mental]] (or both) function of an [[organism]]. (Though this definition includes [[Injury|injuries]], it will not be discussed here). Diseases can arise from [[infection]], [[environmental disease|environmental conditions]], [[accident]]s, and [[Genetic disorder|inherited diseases]].

It is not always easy to classify the source of a health problem. For instance, people can develop [[gout]], which is known to cause permanent or near permanent changes to the human body,&lt;ref&gt;{{MedlinePlusEncyclopedia|000353|Hypothyroidism}}&lt;/ref&gt; because of [[malnutrition|diet]], inherited [[genetic predisposition]], as a [[Complication (medicine)|secondary]] condition from other diseases, or as an unintended [[Adverse effect|side effect]] of certain medications.

[[Infectious disease]]s can be caused by [[pathogen]]s and [[microorganism]]s such as [[virus]]es, [[prion]]s, [[bacteria]], [[Parasitism|parasite]]s, and [[Fungus|fungi]].

=== Injury ===
[[Trauma (medicine)|Trauma]] is "a body wound or shock produced by sudden physical injury, as from violence or accident,"&lt;ref name=Dictionary&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Trauma|encyclopedia=Dictionary.com|year=2010|publisher=Dictionary.com, LLC|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/trauma|accessdate=2010-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; or, more simply put, is "a physical wound or injury, such as a fracture or blow."&lt;ref name=conmed&gt;{{cite dictionary|title=Concise Medical Dictionary|edition=Eighth|editor=Elizabeth Martin|year=2010|publisher=Market House Books Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Accident]]al injuries, most of which can be predicted and thus prevented, are the unintentional negative outcomes of unforeseen or unplanned events or circumstances which may have been avoided or prevented if reasonable [[Injury prevention|measures]] had been taken or if the [[risk]]s involving the [[Attendant circumstance|circumstance]]s leading up to the accident been recognized and acted upon (minimized).

[[Battery (crime)|Battery]] is a criminal offense involving the use of force against another that results in harmful or offensive contact.&lt;ref&gt;[[Black's Law Dictionary]] Garner, p. 162&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Assault]] is fear/belief of impending battery.)
[[Violence]] is defined by the [[World Health Organization|WHO]] as the [[Intention (criminal law)|intentional]] use of physical force or power, threatened or actual, against oneself or others that either results in or has a high likelihood of resulting in injury, death, psychological harm, [[maldevelopment]] or deprivation.&lt;ref name="who.int"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/violence_injury_prevention/violence/world_report/en/ |title=WHO &amp;#124; World report on violence and health |publisher=Who.int |date=2002-10-03 |accessdate=2015-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Head trauma ====
[[Head injury|Head trauma]] in the form of a traumatic brain injury, [[stroke]], drug or alcohol abuse, and infection have been known in some cases to cause changes to a person's mental processes, the most common being [[amnesia]], ability to deal with stress and changes in aggression.  There have also been documented cases of a person's [[personality]] changing more drastically, the best-known case being [[Phineas Gage]], who in 1848 who survived a 1.1 meter long tamping iron being driven through his skull (though almost all presentations of Gage's subsequent personality changes are grossly exaggerated).

There is also the rare condition called [[Foreign Accent Syndrome]] in which someone who has suffered a brain injury will appear to speak in a new language or [[dialect]].  This is typically thought to be due to an injury to the linguistic center of the brain causing speech impairment that just happens to sound like a persons non-native language.  This is thought to be the reasoning behind the [[urban legend]] where someone wakes from a coma or surgery and suddenly speaks a new language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/health/2011/06/01/136824428/a-curious-case-of-foreign-accent-syndrome |title=A Curious Case Of Foreign Accent Syndrome : Shots - Health News |publisher=NPR |date=2011-06-01 |accessdate=2015-08-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Body modification ====
[[Body modification]] is the deliberate altering of the human body for any non-medical reason, such as aesthetics, sexual enhancement, a [[rite of passage]], religious [[ritual|reasons]], to display group membership or affiliation, to create [[body art]], shock value, or self-expression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.essortment.com/all/whatisbodymod_pdv.htm |title=What Is Body Modification? |publisher=Essortment.com |date=1986-05-16 |accessdate=2015-08-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160128093431/http://www.essortment.com/all/whatisbodymod_pdv.htm |archivedate=2016-01-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Wiktionary:frequency|frequency]] of occurrence depends on the location, [[Wiktionary:extent|extent]], and number of modifications, and, perhaps most importantly, on the mind of each individual being asked to accept the modifications on another.

{{further2|[[Social acceptance]]|[[Peer pressure]]|[[Toleration]]|[[Controversial#Psychological bases of controversy|Controversy]]|[[Taboo]]}}

The change can be extreme but still be [[Social acceptance|accepted]] or at least [[toleration|tolerated]] by the majority ([[Cosmetic surgery|cosmetic]] surgery), or be extreme and opposed by most people ([[neck ring]]s). [[Ear piercing]] is a minor aesthetic alteration that is widely accepted (on females' ears). The [[Controversial#Psychological bases of controversy|acceptance]] of highly diverse [[tattoo]]s and [[body piercing]]s depends on location, size, and number and, perhaps most importantly, on the mind of each individual being asked to accept it.

Also known as maiming, [[mutilation]] is any form of physical [[injury]] aimed at [[Wiktionary:degrade|degrading]] the bodily appearance or function of a living organism's body. Examples, include [[amputation]], [[foot binding]], and [[genital modification and mutilation|genital cutting]].
The reasons for these changes can be [[rite of passage]],

Like other acquired characteristics, body modification results in permanent physiological changes that cannot be passed on to offspring genetically alone.

=== Use and disuse of body parts ===
Constant physical exercise such as swimming, running, and weight lifting can cause muscles to develop. However, muscles and other body parts can also waste away through [[atrophy]] due to disuse of said body parts. Both of these phenomena occur most of the time due to the living style of the organism and their effects on the physiology of the organism constitute of acquired characteristics such as either stronger muscles or disintegrated tissue.

Many repetitive activities (sports, [[manual labor]], [[Horse teeth#Typical wear patterns|chewing]]) create wear patterns and leave impressions on the [[bone]]s and [[fascia]] that are highly [[Forensic anthropology|specialized]] (sometimes even unique) to the activity. Over a lifetime, even such simple activities as [[Neutral spine|posture]] and [[Gait (human)|gait]] leave telltale impressions on our bodies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8871">In [[Morphology (linguistics)|linguistic morphology]], the '''bracketing paradox''' concerns morphologically complex [[word]]s which have more than one analysis, or ''[[Bracketing (linguistics)|bracketing]]'', e.g., one for phonology and one for [[semantics]], and the two are not compatible, or brackets do not align.

==English examples==

===Comparatives such as ''unhappier''===

One type of a bracketing paradox found in [[English language|English]] is exemplified by words like ''unhappier'' or ''uneasier''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Pesetsky, D. 1985. "Morphology and logical form." ''Linguistic Inquiry'' 16:193–246.&lt;/ref&gt;  The synthetic [[comparative]] [[suffix]] ''-er'' generally occurs with monosyllabic [[adjective]]s and a small class of disyllabic adjectives with the primary (and only) [[Stress (phonology)|stress]] on the first syllable.  Other adjectives take the analytic comparative ''more''.  Thus, we have ''older'' and ''grumpier'', but ''more correct'' and ''more restrictive''.  From a phonological perspective, this suggests that a word like ''uneasier'' must be formed by combining the suffix ''er'' with the adjective ''easy'', since ''uneasy'' is a three syllable word:
:&lt;math&gt;\Big[\mbox{un-}\Big] \Big[ \big[\mbox{easi}\big] \big[\mbox{-er}\big] \Big]&lt;/math&gt;
However,  ''uneasier'' means "more uneasy", not "not more easy". Thus, from a [[Meaning (linguistics)|semantic]] perspective, ''uneasier'' must be a combination of ''er'' with the adjective ''uneasy'':
:&lt;math&gt;\Big [ \big[\mbox{un-}\big] \big[\mbox{easi}\big] \Big ] \Big[\mbox{-er}\Big] &lt;/math&gt;
This, however, violates the morphophonological rules for the suffix ''-er''.  Phenomena such as this have been argued to represent a mismatch between different levels of grammatical structure.&lt;ref&gt;Sproat, R. 1988. "Bracketing paradoxes, cliticization, and other topics: The mapping between syntactic and phonological structure." In Everaert et al. (eds), ''Morphology and Modularity.'' Amsterdam: North-Holland.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Professions such as ''nuclear physicist''===

Another type of [[English language|English]] bracketing paradox is found in [[compound word]]s that are a name for a professional of a particular discipline, preceded by a modifier that narrows that discipline: ''nuclear physicist'', ''historical linguist'', ''political scientist'', etc.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, E. 1981. "On the notions 'lexically related' and 'head of a word.'" ''Linguistic Inquiry'' 12:245–274.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spencer, A. 1988. "Bracketing paradoxes and the English lexicon." ''Language'' 64:663–682.&lt;/ref&gt; Taking ''nuclear physicist'' as an example, we see that there are at least two reasonable ways that the compound word can be bracketed (ignoring the fact that ''nuclear'' itself is morphologically complex):
#&lt;math&gt; \Big [ \mbox{nuclear} \Big ] \Big [ \big [ \mbox{physic(s)} \big ] \big [\mbox{-ist} \big ] \Big ] &lt;/math&gt; – one who studies physics, and who happens also to be nuclear (phonological bracketing)
#&lt;math&gt; \Big[ \big [\mbox{nuclear} \big] \big [\mbox{physic(s)} \big] \Big] \Big [\mbox{-ist} \Big] &lt;/math&gt; – one who studies nuclear physics, a subfield of physics that deals with nuclear phenomena (semantic bracketing)
What is interesting to many morphologists about this type of bracketing paradox in English is that the correct bracketing 2 (correct in the sense that this is the way that a native speaker would understand it) does not follow the usual bracketing pattern 1 typical for most compound words in English.

== Proposed solutions ==

=== Raising ===

Pesetsky (1985)&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; accounts for the bracketing paradox by proposing that phonological bracketing occurs in syntax and semantic bracketing occurs after the output is sent to [[logical form (linguistics)|LF]]. This solution is parallel to [[Operator (linguistics)#Quantifier Raising .28QR.29|quantifier raising]]. For example, the sentence: ''Every farmer owns a donkey'' has two interpretations:

# Every farmer owns their own donkey: ∀x[farmer(x) → ∃y[donkey(y) ∧ own(x,y)] ]
# There exists one donkey such that every farmer owns it: ∃y[donkey(y) ∧ ∀x[farmer(x) → own(x,y)] ]

* The structure for 1 is: [&lt;sub&gt;IP&lt;/sub&gt; [&lt;sub&gt;DP1&lt;/sub&gt; every farmer ] [ [&lt;sub&gt;DP2&lt;/sub&gt; a donkey ] [''t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' [&lt;sub&gt;VP&lt;/sub&gt; owns ''t&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' ] ] ] ]	
* The structure for 2 is: [&lt;sub&gt;IP&lt;/sub&gt; [&lt;sub&gt;DP2&lt;/sub&gt; a donkey ] [ [&lt;sub&gt;DP1&lt;/sub&gt; every farmer ] [''t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' [&lt;sub&gt;VP&lt;/sub&gt; owns ''t&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' ] ] ] ]	

Depending on which quantifier expression is higher, the meaning is shifted, but because this movement does not occur until LF, the structures are pronounced identically. Similarly to this account for scopal ambiguity in quantifier raising, Pesetsky proposes that in the structure of ''unhappier'', ''happy'' and the comparative suffix ''-er'' are the first to combine, since ''-er'' may not attach to adjectives that are longer than two syllables. It is then fed to PF before the next phase, at which the negative prefix ''un-'' is then attached. At LF in the following phase, ''-er'' undergoes raising, forcing the interpretation of the word to be "more unhappy" and not "not happier".

Syntax: [ un [ happy er ] ] → LF: [ [ un [ happy ''t&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' ] ] er&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ]

=== Late Adjunction ===

An alternative account is proposed by Newell (2005).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.hum2.leidenuniv.nl/pdf/lucl/sole/console13/console13-newell.pdf|title = Bracketing paradoxes and particle verbs: a late adjunction analysis.|last = Newell|first = Heather|date = 2005|journal = Proceedings of ConSOLE xiii|doi = |pmid = |access-date = July 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She argues that ''un-'' adjoins at a late stage of the derivation in LF, possibly after the Spell-out of [happy -er]. Under this interpretation the stages are:

Syntax: [ happy er ] → Late Insertion: [ [ un happy ] er ]

Contrasting with ''un-'', the prefix ''in-'', which also has negative meaning, is not allowed at late insertion. There are various pieces of evidence that ''in-'' is closer to the root.

# Selectional Restrictions: ''in-'' may only combine with Latinate roots, while ''un-'' is nonrestrictive
# Bound Morphemes: ''in-'' attaches to some bound morphemes, while ''un-'' only attaches to free morphemes (''inept'' → *ept, ''inane'' → *ane)
# Nasal Assimilation: ''in-'' assimilates phonologically with the first phoneme of the morpheme to which it attaches, whereas the /n/ in ''un-'' is preserved
## Impossible: /in-/ + /ˈpasɪbl̩/ → [imˈpʰasɪbl̩] (*[inˈpʰasɪbl̩])
## Unpopular: /un-/ + /ˈpɒpjulr̩/ → [unˈpʰˈɒpjulr̩] (*[umˈpʰˈɒpjulr̩])

In order to participate in these processes, ''in-'' must attach at an earlier level directly to the root in order to adjectivize it. Thus, because it attaches early, if it creates a three-syllable word, ''-er'' may not attach, as ''-er'' attaches at a later stage above the root derivation.

* [ [ in √polite ] -er ] → crashes at PF

=== Glomming ===
A famous bracketing paradox of Russian verb complex&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Problems in the theory of phonology: Russian phonology and Turkish phonology.|last = Lightner|first = Theodore|publisher = Linguistic Research|year = 1972|isbn = |location = Edmonton, Alberta|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; such as ''razorvala'' 'she ripped apart' shows different phonological and semantic analyses:

razo rv a          la

PFX Root THEME 3SG.PST.F
* morphophonology – [prefix [root suffixes] ]
* morphosemantics – [ [prefix root] suffixes]
One of the proposed solutions is parallel to the proposal for [[Navajo language|Navajo verbs]] with multiple prefixes.&lt;ref&gt;Harley, Heidi (2010). Affixation and the mirror principle. In Interfaces in linguistics: New research perspectives, ed. Rafaella Folli and Christiane Ulbrich. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; It includes head movement and Merger Under Adjacency, also called Glomming. For Russian, the derivation starts with [&lt;sub&gt;TP&lt;/sub&gt; T [&lt;sub&gt;AspP&lt;/sub&gt; Asp [&lt;sub&gt;vP&lt;/sub&gt; v [&lt;sub&gt;VP&lt;/sub&gt; √V [&lt;sub&gt;SC&lt;/sub&gt; LP DP''&lt;sub&gt;obj&lt;/sub&gt;'']]]]] It allows for the semantic bracketing as √V and LP are next to each other. Next, √V ''rv'' merges with v –''a'' via head movement and further v complex merges with Asp also via head movement. Lexical Prefix ''razo-'' is phrasal&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Russian prefixes are phrasal.|last = Svenonius|first = Peter|date = 2004|journal = Ms. University of Tromsø|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and does not participate in the head movement. Thus, the complex structure emerging as a result of head movement to the exclusion of LP allows for the phonological bracketing. Finally, Glomming or Merger Under Adjacency takes place resulting in one verbal complex.

'''Brian Evan Anthony Davies''' {{post-nominals|post-noms=[[Ordo Praedicatorum|OP]]}} (born 1951) is a British philosopher. He is Distinguished Professor of [[Philosophy]], [[Fordham University]] (since 1995), and author of ''An Introduction to the Philosophy of Religion'', now in its third English edition, which has been translated into five languages.

==Education==
Brian Davies studied theology at the [[University of Bristol]]&lt;ref name=PR&gt;[http://www.philosophyofreligion.info/whos-who/modern-authors/brian-davies/ Philosophy of Religion]&lt;/ref&gt; (BA 1972) and undertook graduate studies at [[King's College London]] (MTh, 1973; Tutorial Assistant, 1974–6; PhD, 1976).&lt;ref name=Fordham&gt;[http://www.fordham.edu/academics/programs_at_fordham_/philosophy/materials/brian_davies_69790.asp Fordham Philosophy Department]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Teaching==
He spent the period 1982–95 at the [[University of Oxford]]. Throughout those years he was lecturer in Theology and Philosophy at [[Blackfriars, Oxford]]. Davies was also Tutor in Theology, [[St Benet's Hall, Oxford|St Benet's Hall]] and a member of the [[Theology Faculty of the University of Oxford|Faculty of Theology]] (1983–95); Regent of Studies of the English Dominican Province (1988–95); University Research Lecturer (1993–95); and member of the Sub-Faculty of Philosophy (1994–95).&lt;ref name=Fordham/&gt;

In 1994 Davies was appointed Regent of [[Blackfriars, Oxford|Blackfriars]] and, as a Head of House, received the degree of Master of Arts by Special Decree by the University of Oxford. In 1995 he took up his current appointment at [[Fordham University]].&lt;ref name=PR/&gt; He held Visiting Professorships at the [[Beda College]], Rome (Spring 1987 and Spring 1988), [[Fordham University]] (July–August 1987, July–August 1988, and Fall 1994), and [[Candler School of Theology]], [[Emory University]] (Spring 1993).&lt;ref name=Fordham/&gt;

==Publications==

===Writing===
Some of Davies's publications include:

*''An Introduction to the Philosophy of Religion'' (Oxford University Press: Oxford, 1982; revised edition, 1993; 3rd edition 2003; Korean translation, 1996; Romanian translation, 1996; Ukrainian translation, 1996; Hungarian translation, 1999; Polish translation 2006) -An Introduction to the Philosophy of Religion is a Philosophical Book written by the philosopher Brian Davies (1951–present). The book covers the topics: Concepts of God, Philosophy and Religious Belief, Cosmological Arguments, Design Arguments, Ontological Arguments, Experience and God, Talking about God, Divine Simplicity, Omnipotence and Omniscience, God and Evil, Miracles, Morality and Religion and Life after Death. '''Miracles'''-The text covers the definition of miracles in reference to a number of different philosophers (David Hume, Richard Swinburne, and John Mackie). David Hume’s definition being ‘A miracle is a transgression of a law of nature by a particular violation of the deity, or by the interposition of some invisible agent.’ It then goes on to pose questions such as ‘Is it Reasonable to Believe in Miracles?’.  It then focuses on Hume’s opinion on Miracles and the confusion on his beliefs whether miracles are possible or not. It then moves onto ‘What do Miracles prove?’ where it debates how miracles help to prove meaning for the existence in God, it discusses the ideas of who causes and in what conditions can miracles be caused.

The Rev. '''Edmond La Beaume Cherbonnier''' (February 11, 1918 – March 7, 2017) was an American scholar in the field of religious studies.&lt;ref name="bio"&gt;[http://www.philosophy-religion.org/cherbonnier/pdfs/EDMOND-LaB.pdf A Brief Biography of Edmond La B. Cherbonnier]&lt;/ref&gt; He served as Professor of Religion at [[Trinity College (Connecticut)|Trinity College, Connecticut]], and as a [[deacon]] in the [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Episcopal Church]]. He is known for his work on Christianity, analyzing [[idolatry]] and distinctions between [[Mysticism|mystical]] and biblical thought, his efforts on developing and advancing religious studies, and for founding the Religion Department at Trinity College in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Edmond La Beaume Cherbonnier|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/stltoday/obituary.aspx?pid=184495804|publisher=St. Louis Today|accessdate=22 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Edmond Cherbonnier was born on February 11, 1918, in [[Saint Louis, Missouri]].  His father, Edward Goodwin Cherbonnier, was a vice president of the [[Ralston Purina Company]].&lt;ref name="nytimes1"&gt;"[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B0DE3DC1138F934A25756C0A961948260 Laurie Goodwin Cherbonnier Marries John Christopher Nielsen in Hartford]", ''The New York Times'', May 17, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduation from [[St. Louis Country Day School]], Cherbonnier entered [[Harvard University]], where he majored in [[geology]].&lt;ref name="barnardarchive1"&gt;"Cherbonnier talks at noon meeting", ''[http://barnardcollege.newspaperarchive.com/ Barnard Bulletin]'', November 2, 1953&lt;/ref&gt; In 1939, he received the degree of Bachelor of Arts ''[[cum laude]]''.&lt;ref name="commentary1"&gt;Cherbonnier, E. La B., "[http://www.commentarymagazine.com/viewarticle.cfm/a--j--heschel-and-the-philosophy-of-the-bible-br-em-mystic-or-rationalist-em-2943 Abstract - A. J. Heschel and the Philosophy of the Bible: Mystic or Rationalist?]", ''[[Commentary (magazine)|Commentary]]'' (January 1959)&lt;/ref&gt; During his undergraduate years, when associated with Harvard’s [[Winthrop House]], (one of twelve undergraduate residences)&lt;ref name="crimson1"&gt;"[http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=458563 Cherbonnier elected next P.B.H. President]", ''[[The Harvard Crimson]]'', March 08, 1938&lt;/ref&gt; he was elected President of the [[Phillips Brooks House Association]] (a student-run public service organization).&lt;ref name="crimson1" /&gt; He was a member of the [[Winthrop House]] Committee and the Harvard [[Glee Club]], and an active participant for several years in social service work at the [[Phillips Brooks House Association]].&lt;ref name="crimson1" /&gt;

==Professional career==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:cherbonnier.jpg|upright|thumb|Cherbonnier in the 1970s]] --&gt;
Cherbonnier held a brief post as teacher of [[Latin]] at [[Avon Old Farms School]] in [[Avon, Connecticut]].&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt; Shortly thereafter, Cherbonnier enrolled at [[Union Theological Seminary in the City of New York|Union Theological Seminary]] in [[New York City|New York]]; his graduate studies were interrupted while he served as a naval aviator during [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="commentary1" /&gt; After his wartime service, he resumed his [[theological]] studies and in 1947 received the degree of [[Bachelor of Divinity]] from Union. In the same year he was ordained a deacon by the Episcopal Bishop of Missouri.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diocesemo.org/whoweare/clergydirectory.htm Clergy from The Episcopal Diocese of Missouri]&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent study on a Fiske Fellowship from Harvard&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=471828 Fellowships Awarded for Travel, Study]", ''[[The Harvard Crimson]]'', June 19, 1947&lt;/ref&gt; led to the degrees of [[Bachelor of Arts]] (1948) and [[Master of Arts]] (1952) from [[Cambridge University]], England. Additionally, from 1948-1949 Cherbonnier was in residence as a Union Seminary Traveling Fellow at the [[University of Strasbourg]] and the [[University of Zurich]].

Cherbonnier entered the doctoral program at [[Columbia University]]; while studying during the 1949-1950 school year, Cherbonnier was a tutor-assistant to Henry P. Van Dusen at Union. He held a one-year appointment as assistant professor of religion at [[Vassar College|Vassar]] (1950–1951)&lt;ref&gt;[http://specialcollections.vassar.edu/findingaids/biographical_files.html#series3 Guide to the Vassar College Biographical Files, 1900-1983]&lt;/ref&gt; which resulted in a [[Ph.D.]] degree in religion conferred by Columbia. His doctoral thesis was entitled "[http://www.philosophy-religion.org/cherbonnier/pdfs/Freedom-and-Time.pdf Freedom and Time: A Study in Some Recent Contributions to the Problem]".

From Vassar, Cherbonnier joined the faculty of [[Barnard College]] of Columbia University,&lt;ref name="barnardarchive1" /&gt; where he remained until the spring of 1955 as assistant and associate professor of religion. In addition, from 1952 to 1955 he served as Deacon at the nearby [[Cathedral Church of Saint John the Divine]], during the Deanship of the later controversial Bishop of California [[James A. Pike]]. On May 31, 1954, ''[[The New York Times]]'' highlighted one of his cathedral sermons in an article "Worship Of Ideals Held Destructive".&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.nytimes.com/1954/05/31/archives/worship-of-ideals-held-destructive-st-johns-deacon-warns-on.html?sq=Worship%2520Of%2520Idols%2520Held%2520Destructive&amp;scp=1&amp;st=cse Worship Of Ideals Held Destructive - St. John's Deacon Warns on Idolatry of Democracy as a Danger of Our Time]", ''[[The New York Times]]'', May 31, 1954&lt;/ref&gt;

Cherbonnier received praise for his efforts early in his career. In 1952, [[Reinhold Niebuhr]] expressed gratitude to Cherbonnier in his Preface to ''The Irony Of American History'' "for careful reading of my manuscript and for many suggestions for its improvement".&lt;ref&gt;Niebuhr, Reinhold (1952). ''The Irony Of American History'' p. ix&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1955, Cherbonnier’s book ''Hardness of Heart'' was published by [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]]. A volume in the “Christian Faith Series” edited by [[Reinhold Niebuhr]], the study provided a contemporary interpretation of the doctrine of sin. During the next year it was also published by London’s [[Victor Gollancz Ltd]]. Psychiatrist [[Karl Menninger|Karl Menninger, M.D.]] presented a synopsis of the book in his ''The Vital Balance'': “Cherbonnier in his beautiful essay, Hardness of Heart, describes the forms of [[idolatry]] indulged in by the hardhearted. He lists the hidden gods of cynicism as nationalism, [[humanism]], [[phallicism]], [[promiscuity]], the glorification of money, and the various euphemisms such as frugality, shrewdness, and sound economy. Cherbonnier also lists [[iconoclasm]], existentialist despair, and a so-called state of “adjustment” and “relatedness” toward which some psychiatrists are believed to steer their patients.”&lt;ref&gt;Menninger, Karl (1963). ''The Vital Balance'' p.375&lt;/ref&gt;

In the fall of 1955, Cherbonnier was invited by [[Trinity College (Connecticut)|Trinity College]] in [[Hartford, Connecticut]], to establish a religion department. After serving two years as an associate professor, he was promoted to full professor and was then joined by a second department member, Dr. Theodor Marcus Mauch.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.wickedlocal.com/brewster/archive/x857471503 Obituaries for October 19]." ''The Cape Codder'', October 19, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Under Cherbonnier’s chairmanship, the department was enlarged to a staff of five full-time professors plus adjunct faculty.

Professor Cherbonnier was awarded the degree of [[Doctor of Divinity]], [[honoris causa]] by the [[University of Vermont]] in 1959. He took a sabbatical leave in 1962-63 to London, England, which was partially underwritten by a Lilly Post-Doctoral Fellowship.  He spent his sabbatical performing further work on distinctions between mystical and biblical thought.  Dr. Cherbonnier took another leave for the 1970-1972 academic years plus the first semester of 1972-1973, which he also spent in England. He retired from his Trinity position in 1983.&lt;ref name="nytimes1"/&gt;

Dr. Cherbonnier's interests include the [[Shroud of Turin]] and the life of [[Saint Joan of Arc]] (1412-1431 C.E.).

He is a [[chaplain]] in the [[Venerable Order of Saint John#The Priory in the United States of America|Most Venerable Order of the Hospital of St. John of Jerusalem - Priory in the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saintjohn.org/usapriory/2005_memberlist_eh.asp Members List of Priory of St John]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eleanor Rae''' (born 1934) is an American author and proponent of eco-feminism.  
'''

==Family==
Rae was born in [[Meriden, Connecticut]]).  Her parents named here after First Lady [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] with the thought that her family would survive the [[Great Depression]]. Eleanor Rae is married to Giles Rae and they together have two daughters, a son, and eight grand children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.women-philosophers.com/Eleanor-Rae.html|work=Eleanor Rae - Women, Earth, the Divine|accessdate=2013-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
Rae first earned a Mathematics degree from the [[College of New Rochelle]]. She received a Master's degree from [[Southern Connecticut State University]] in [[early childhood education]] and a Masters in parish ministry and [[adult education]] from [[Fordham University]]. Rae earned her doctoral degree from Fordham in contemporary [[systematic theology]].

==Work Life==
After her youngest child entered school, Rae worked as a day care worker, parent cooperative nursery school director, in church ministries, and a public school teacher. In her most recent position as Director of Office of the Laity for the Roman Catholic Diocese, she developed an interest in women’s issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eleanor Rae - Women, Earth, the Divine|url=http://www.women-philosophers.com/Eleanor-Rae.html|work=Women-philosophers.com|accessdate=2013-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major works==
Rae co-authored the book ''Created in Her Image: Models of the Feminine Divine''. Beginning in 1995, Rae has published a quarterly newsletter ''Weaving the Connections'' on various women’s issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eleanor Rae - Women, Earth, the Divine|url=http://www.women-philosophers.com/Eleanor-Rae.html|work=Women-Philosophers.com|accessdate=2013-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Created in Her Image: Models of the Feminine Divine (Summary)==
Eleanor Rae uses her feminist perspective, spirituality, and her social concerns to put forth a book that explains the powers of the feminist divine. The book outlines the role that [[psychology]] has played in [[feminism]] and how it will also play a role going forward.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|publisher=Orbis Books|asin = 0883449528}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Women, the Earth, the Divine (Summary)==
Rae puts together three topics of concern in this 1994 novel. The novel focuses on rediscovering feminine principle that is a not a result of male view. Instead, Rae uses real world experiences from women. She ties together eco feminism with religion and relates them to real world issues. The novel examines western tendencies to ignore women's voices and peoples ability to over look women's capabilities across various subjects. Rae compares the feminine principle with four major religions, Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism, and Judaism.

==Philosophical contributions==
Rae is considered a staple in eco feminist theology. She has had a focus on women’s oppression and issues around this subject her entire career. Rae is part of a group of eco feminists that contribute to social in justice and attacks philosophical theories that contribute to injustices. Eco feminism as a whole aims to connect, historically and philosophically, the idea of women’s oppression and nature’s exploitation. 'Rae is credited as one of these eco feminists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=An Orthodox Christian Response to Ecofeminist Theological Claims|url=http://www.omhksea.org/|accessdate=2013-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Present==
Rae has worked with [[Amazon river dolphin]]s in [[Peru]] and [[leatherback turtles]] in [[Suriname]].
==Accomplishments==
Rae was awarded the Ursula Lauris citation for her leadership achievements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.women-philosophers.com/Eleanor-Rae.html|work=Eleanor Rae - Women, Earth, the Divine|accessdate=2013-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Eric R. Scerri''' is a chemist, writer and [[Philosophy of science|philosopher of science]], of [[Maltese people|Maltese]] origin.&lt;ref&gt;Baykoucheva S 2010, '[http://bulletin.acscinf.org/node/197 Eric Scerri: A philosopher’s view on the periodic table of the elements and its significance'], ''Chemical Information Bulletin,'' vol. 62, no. 1, Spring, pp.&amp;nbsp;27–32&lt;/ref&gt; He is a lecturer at the University of California, Los Angeles; and the founder and editor-in-chief of ''[[Foundations of Chemistry]]'', an international peer reviewed journal covering the [[History of chemistry|history]] and [[philosophy of chemistry]], and [[chemical education]].&lt;ref name=Rocke&gt;Rocke A 2012, '[http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/books/a-tale-of-seven-elements-by-eric-scerri/2006399.article A place at the periodic table'], ''[[The Times Higher Education Supplement]],'' 15 August&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=UCLA&gt;UCLA Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry 2013, 'Scerri, Eric R.', University of California. For current biographical information see the home page of [http://ericscerri.com/ Eric Scerri]&lt;/ref&gt;

He is a world authority on the [[History of the periodic table|history]] and [[Philosophy of chemistry|philosophy]] of the [[periodic table]] and is the author and editor of several books in this and related fields.&lt;ref&gt;Sella A 2013, '[https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21929291.200-an-elementary-history-lesson.html#.UrODOOKc3cx An elementary history lesson'], ''[[New Scientist]],'' 13 August&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Scerri was a participant in the 2014 [[PBS]] documentary film, ''[[The Mystery of Matter (film)|The Mystery of Matter]]''.

Eric Scerri attended Walpole Grammar School in Ealing.  He received his BSc from [[Westfield College]] ([[University of London]]), his Certificate in Postgraduate Study from the [[University of Cambridge]], his MPhil from the [[University of Southampton]], and his PhD from [[King's College London]].&lt;ref name=UCLA/&gt;

==Research interests==
Scerri's research has mainly been in the history and philosophy of chemistry, in particular on the question of the extent to which chemistry reduces to quantum mechanics.  He has specialized in the study of the periodic table of the elements, including its historical origins and its philosophical significance.  More recent writings have included critiques of claims for the emergence of chemistry and the existence of downward causation.

In addition to historical and philosophical work Scerri has published numerous articles in the chemical education literature, including accounts of the electronic structures of transition metals and the occurrence of anomalous electronic configurations.

In ''A Tale of Seven Elements'' (2013) Scerri recounts the story of the discovery of the seven elements missing from the periodic table shortly after the turn of the 20th century, including the setbacks, misguided claims, and sometimes acrimonious priority debates and disputes.

In 2015, Scerri was appointed by [[IUPAC]] as the chair of a project that will make a recommendation on the composition of [[Group 3 element|group 3]]—whether it should be the elements [[Periodic_table#Group_3_and_its_elements_in_periods_6_and_7|Sc, Y, La and Ac; or Sc, Y, Lu and Lr]].

Most recently (2016) he proposed a new evolutionary approach to the philosophy of science based on seven case studies of little known scientists such as John Nicholson, Anton Van den Broek and Edmund Stoner. Scerri has argued that these lesser known figures are just as significant as the heroic personalities in that they constitute the missing gaps in a gradual evolutionary and organic growth in the body of scientific knowledge. Although he rejects the occurrence of scientific revolutions as envisioned by [[Thomas Kuhn]], Scerri very much supports Kuhn's notion that scientific progress is non-teleological and that there is no approach towards an external truth.

{{Catholic philosophy}}

'''Francisco Suárez''' (5 January 1548 – 25 September 1617) was a [[Spain|Spanish]] [[Jesuit]] [[Catholic priest|priest]], [[philosopher]] and [[theology|theologian]], one of the leading figures of the [[School of Salamanca]] movement, and generally regarded among the greatest [[scholasticism|scholastics]] after [[Thomas Aquinas]]. His work is considered a turning point in the history of [[second scholasticism]], marking the transition from its Renaissance to its [[Baroque philosophy|Baroque phases]]. According to Christopher Shields and Daniel Schwartz, "figures as distinct from one another in place, time, and philosophical orientation as [[Leibniz]], [[Grotius]], [[Pufendorf]], [[Schopenhauer]], and [[Heidegger]], all found reason to cite him as a source of inspiration and influence."&lt;ref&gt;http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/suarez/&lt;/ref&gt;

Novotný, ''Ens rationis from Su : A Study in Scholasticism of the Baroque Era'', [[Fordham University Press]] (2013), p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; Francisco Suárez was born in [[Granada]], [[Andalusia]] (southern [[Spain]]), on 5 January 1548.

After 3 years of preliminary studies from age 10 onwards, in 1561 Suárez matriculated at the [[University of Salamanca]], and studied Law. In 1564, at age sixteen, Suárez entered the [[Society of Jesus]] in [[Salamanca]] and went through the two years of intense spiritual training under the guidance of Fr [[Alonso Rodriguez]]. In August 1566, Suárez took his first vows as a Jesuit; he then began in October 1566 to study Theology at Salamanca.  It seems he was not a promising student at first; in fact, he nearly gave up his matters of study after failing the entrance exam twice. After passing the exam at third attempt, though, things changed.

In 1570, with the completion of his course, Suárez began to teach Philosophy, first at Salamanca as a Scholastic tutor, and then as a professor in the Jesuit college at [[Segovia]].  He was [[ordination|ordained]] in March 1572 in Segovia. He continued to teach Philosophy in Segovia until, in September 1574, he moved to the Jesuit College in [[Valladolid]]  to teach Theology, a subject he would then teach for the rest of his life. He taught in a succession of different places: Avila (1575), Segovia (1575), Valladolid (1576) [[Rome]] (1580–85), [[Alcalá de Henares|Alcalá]] (1585–92) and Salamanca (1592–97). In 1597, he moved to [[Coimbra]], some years after the accession of the Spanish (elder line) House of Habsburg to the Portuguese Throne, to take up the principal chair of Theology at the [[University of Coimbra]]. He remained there, aside from a brief time teaching at Rome, until his death in 1617.

He wrote on a wide variety of subjects, producing a vast amount of work (his complete works in [[Latin]] amount to twenty-six volumes). Suárez writings include treatises on [[law]], the relationship between Church and State, [[metaphysics]], and theology. He is considered the godfather of International Law. His ''[[Metaphysical Disputations|Disputationes metaphysicae]] (Metaphysical Disputations'') were widely read in Europe during the 17th century and are considered by some scholars to be his most profound work.

Suárez was regarded during his lifetime as being the greatest living philosopher and theologian, and given the [[nickname]] ''Doctor Eximius et Pius'' ("Exceptional and Pious Doctor"); [[Pope Gregory XIII]] attended his first lecture in Rome. [[Pope Paul V]] invited him to refute the arguments of [[James I of England]], and wished to retain him near his person, to profit by his knowledge. [[Philip II of Spain]] sent him to the [[University of Coimbra]] in order to give it prestige, and when Suárez visited the [[University of Barcelona]], the [[Doctorate|doctors]] of the university went out to meet him wearing the insignia of their [[Faculty (division)|faculties]].

After his death in [[Portugal]] (in either [[Lisbon]] or [[Coimbra]]) his reputation grew still greater, and he had a direct influence on such leading philosophers as [[Hugo Grotius]], [[René Descartes]], [[John Norris (philosopher)|John Norris]], and [[Gottfried Leibniz]].

In 1679 [[Pope Innocent XI]] publicly condemned sixty-five [[casuistry|casuist]] propositions, taken chiefly from the writings of [[Antonio Escobar y Mendoza|Escobar]], Suárez and others, mostly [[Jesuit]], theologians as ''propositiones laxorum moralistarum'' and forbade anyone to teach them under penalty of [[excommunication]].&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, J.N.D., The Oxford History of the Popes, Oxford University Press, 1986. {{ISBN|0-19-282085-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophical thought ==
His most important philosophical achievements were in metaphysics and the philosophy of law. Suárez may be considered the last eminent representative of [[scholasticism]]. He adhered to a moderate form of [[Thomism]] and developed metaphysics as a systematic enquiry.

=== Metaphysics ===
[[File:Francisco Suarez (1590) Commentariorum ac disputationum in tertiam partem divi Thomae.png|thumb|''Commentariorum ac disputationum in tertiam partem divi Thomae'' (1590).]]
[[File:Francisco Suarez (1625) Operis de religione.png|thumb|''Operis de religione'' (1625).]]
[[File:Francisco Suarez (1745) De incarnatione, pars 1.png|thumb|''De incarnatione, pars prima'' (1745).]]
[[File:Francisco Suarez (1746) De incarnatione, pars 2.png|thumb|''De incarnatione, pars secunda'' (1746).]]
For Suárez, metaphysics was the science of real essences (and existence); it was mostly concerned with real being rather than conceptual being, and with immaterial rather than with material being.  He held (along with earlier scholastics) that essence and existence are the same in the case of God (see [[ontological argument]]), but disagreed with Aquinas and others that the essence and existence of finite beings are really distinct. He argued that in fact they are merely ''conceptually'' distinct: rather than being really separable, they can only logically be conceived as separate.

On the vexed subject of [[universals]], he endeavored to steer a middle course between the [[Medieval realism|realism]] of [[Duns Scotus]] and the [[nominalism]] of [[William of Occam]]. His position is a little bit closer to nominalism than that of [[Thomas Aquinas]].&lt;ref&gt;See the translation of Suárez's ''De Unitate Formali et Universali'' [[James Francis Ross]] (Translator) ''On Formal and Universal Unity: De Unitate Formali et Universali by Francis Suarez,''(Milwaukee: Marquette University Press, 1964)&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes he is classified as a ''moderate nominalist'', but his admitting of [[objective precision]] (''praecisio obiectiva'') ranks him with moderate realists. The only veritable and real unity in the world of existences is the individual; to assert that the universal exists separately ''ex parte rei'' would be to reduce individuals to mere accidents of one indivisible form. Suárez maintains that, though the humanity of Socrates does not differ from that of Plato, yet they do not constitute ''realiter'' one and the same humanity; there are as many "formal unities" (in this case, humanities) as there are individuals, and these individuals do not constitute a factual, but only an essential or ideal unity ("In such a way, that many individuals, which are said to be of the same nature, are so: only through the operation of the intellect, not through a substance or essence of things which unites them").&lt;ref&gt;Original Latin: "ita ut plura individua, quae dicuntur esse ejusdem naturae, non sint unum quid vera entitate quae sit in rebus, sed solum fundamentaliter vel per intellectum"&lt;/ref&gt; The formal unity, however, is not an arbitrary creation of the mind, but exists "in the nature of the thing, prior [ontologically] to any operation of the intellect".&lt;ref&gt;Original Latin: "in natura rei ante omnem operationem intellectus."&lt;/ref&gt;

His metaphysical work, giving a remarkable effort of systematisation, is a real history of medieval thought, combining the three schools available at that time: [[Thomism]], [[Scotism]] and [[Nominalism]]. He is also a deep commentator of Arabic or high medieval works. He enjoyed the reputation of being the greatest metaphysician of his time. He thus founded a school of his own, ''Suarism'' or ''Suarezianism'', the chief characteristic principles of which are: 
* the [[principle of individuation]] by the proper concrete entity of beings
* the rejection of pure potentiality of matter
* the singular as the object of direct intellectual cognition
* a ''distinctio rationis ratiocinatae'' between the essence and the existence of created beings
* the possibility of spiritual substance only numerically distinct from one another
* ambition for the hypostatic union as the sin of the fallen angels
* the Incarnation of the Word, even if Adam had not sinned
* the solemnity of the vow only in ecclesiastical law
* the system of Congruism that modifies [[Molinism]] by the introduction of subjective circumstances, as well as of place and of time, propitious to the action of efficacious grace, and with predestination ''ante praevisa merita''
* the possibility of holding one and the same truth by both science and faith
* the belief in Divine authority contained in an act of faith
* the production of the body and blood of Christ by [[transubstantiation]] as constituting the Eucharistic sacrifice
* the final grace of the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] superior to that of the angels and saints combined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Pérez Goyena|first=Antonio|title=Francisco Suárez|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14319a.htm|work=The Catholic Encyclopedia|publisher=New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1912|accessdate=September 20, 2012}}  [Pérez gives both "Suarism" and "Suarezianism" as alternative spellings.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Suárez made an important investigation of being, its properties and division in ''Disputationes Metaphysicae'' (1597), which influenced the further development of theology within Catholicism. In the second part of the book, disputations 28-53, Suárez fixes the distinction between ''ens infinitum'' (God) and ''ens finitum'' (created beings). The first division of being is that between ''ens infinitum'' and ''ens finitum''. Instead of dividing being into infinite and finite, it can also be divided into ''ens a se'' and ''ens ab alio'', i.e., being that is from itself and being that is from another. A second distinction corresponding to this one:''ens necessarium'' and ''ens contingens'', i.e., necessary being and contingent being. Still another formulation of the distinction is between ''ens per essentiam'' and ''ens per participationem'', i.e., being that exists by reason of its essence and being that exists only by participation in a being that exists on its own (''eigentlich''). A further distinction is between ''ens increatum'' and ''ens creatum'', i.e., uncreated being and created, or creaturely, being. A final distinction is between being as ''actus purus'' and being as ''ens potentiale'', i.e., being as pure actuality and being as potential being. Suárez decided in favor of the first classification of the being into ''ens infinitum'' and ''ens finitum'' as the most fundamental, in connection with which he accords the other classifications their due. In the last disputation 54 Suárez deals with ''entia rationis'' (beings of reason), which are impossible intentional objects, i.e. objects that are created by our minds but cannot exist in actual reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Novotný|first=Daniel D.|title=Ens rationis from Suárez to Caramuel|url=https://www.amazon.com/Ens-rationis-Su%C3%A1rez-Caramuel-Scholasticism/dp/0823244768|publisher=New York: Fordham University Press, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Theology ===

In theology, Suárez attached himself to the doctrine of [[Luis de Molina|Luis Molina]], the celebrated Jesuit professor of Évora. Molina tried to reconcile the doctrine of [[predestination]] with the freedom of the human will and the predestinarian teachings of the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] by saying that the predestination is consequent upon God's foreknowledge of the free determination of man's will, which is therefore in no way affected by the fact of such predestination. Suárez endeavoured to reconcile this view with the more orthodox doctrines of the efficacy of grace and special election, maintaining that, though all share in an absolutely sufficient grace, there is granted to the elect a grace which is so adapted to their peculiar dispositions and circumstances that they infallibly, though at the same time quite freely, yield themselves to its influence. This mediatizing system was known by the name of "congruism."

=== Philosophy of law ===
Here, Suárez's main importance stems probably from his work on [[natural law]], and from his arguments concerning [[positive law]] and the status of a [[monarch]]. In his massive work, ''Tractatus de legibus ac deo legislatore'' (1612), he is to some extent the precursor of [[Grotius]] and [[Pufendorf]], in making an important distinction between natural law and international law, which he saw as based on custom. Though his method is throughout scholastic, he covers the same ground, and Grotius speaks of him with great respect. The fundamental position of the work is that all legislative as well as all paternal power is derived from God, and that the authority of every law stems ultimately from God's eternal law. Suárez denies the patriarchal theory of government and the divine right of kings founded upon it, doctrines popular at that time in England and to some extent on the Continent. He argued against the sort of [[social contract]] theory that became dominant among early-modern [[political philosophy|political philosophers]] such as [[Thomas Hobbes]] and [[John Locke]], but some of his thinking, as transmitted by Grotius, found echoes in later liberal political theory.

He argued that human beings have a social nature bestowed upon them by God, and this includes the potential to make laws. However, when a political society is formed, the authority of the state is not of divine but of human origin; therefore, its nature is chosen by the people involved, and their natural legislative power is given to the ruler.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.acton.org - Francisco Suarez (1548 - 1617) - The Acton Institute - Microsoft Internet Explorer&lt;/ref&gt; Because they gave this power, they have the right to take it back and to revolt against a ruler, only if the ruler behaves badly towards them, and they must act moderately and justly. In particular, the people must refrain from killing the ruler, no matter how tyrannical he may have become. If a government is imposed on people, on the other hand, they have the right to defend themselves by revolting against it and even kill the tyrannical ruler.&lt;ref&gt;John A. Mourant, "Suárez, Francisco," in ''The Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', ed. Paul Edwards. New York: Macmillan and The Free Press, 1967, vol. 8, p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though Suárez was greatly influenced by Aquinas in his philosophy of law, there are some notable differences. Aquinas broadly defined "law" as "a rule and measure acts, whereby man is induced to act or is restrained from acting" (ST 1-11, qu. 90, art. 1). Suárez argues that this definition is too broad, since it applies to things that are not strictly laws, such as unjust ordinances and counsels of perfection.&lt;ref&gt;Francisco Suárez, ''Selections from Three Works'', trans. by Gwladys L. Williams, et. al. Indianapolis: Liberty Fund, 2015, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Suárez also takes issue with Aquinas' more formal definition of "law" as "an ordinance of reason for the common good, made by him who has care of the community, and promulgated" (ST 1-11, qu. 90, art. 4). This definition, he claims, fails to recognize that law is primarily an act of will rather than an act of reason, and would wrongly count orders to particular individuals as being laws.&lt;ref&gt;''Selections from Three Works'', p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, Suárez disagrees with Aquinas's claim that God can change or suspend some of the secondary precepts of the natural law, such as the prohibitions on murder, theft, and adultery (ST 1-11, qu. 94, art. 5). Suárez argues that the natural law is immutable as long as human nature remains unchanged, and that what may appear to be divinely-made changes in the natural law are really just alterations of subject matter. For example, when God orders Hosea to take a "wife of fornications" (i.e., sleep with a prostitute), this is not an exemption from God's prohibition of adultery. "For God has power to transfer to a man ''dominium'' over a woman without her consent, and to effect such a bond between them that, by virtue of this bond, the union is no longer one of fornication."&lt;ref&gt;''Selections from Three Works'', p. 343.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1613, at the instigation of [[Pope Paul V]], Suárez wrote a treatise dedicated to the Christian princes of Europe, entitled ''Defensio catholicae fidei contra anglicanae sectae errores'' ("Defense of the Universal Catholic Faith Against the Errors of the Anglican Sect").&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/americanecclesia57cathuoft#page/512/mode/2up Jollain, Japeth S.] ''"Francis Suarez: The Man and His History,"'' The Ecclesiastical Review, Vol. LVII, 1917.&lt;/ref&gt; This was directed against the [[Oath of Allegiance (1606)|oath of allegiance]] which [[James I of England|James I]] required from his subjects.

James (himself a talented scholar) caused it to be burned by the common hangman and forbade its perusal under the 'severest penalties, complaining bitterly to [[Philip III of Spain]] for harbouring in his dominions a declared enemy of the throne and majesty of kings.

== Influence ==
[[File:Prima pars Summae theologiae de Deo vno et trino BEIC3 V00042 F0006.tif|thumb|''Prima pars Summae theologiae de Deo vno et trino'']]
The contributions of Suarez to metaphysics and theology exerted significant influence over 17th and 18th century scholastic theology among both Roman Catholics and Protestants.&lt;ref&gt;Donnelly, John Patrick, ''Calvinism and Scholasticism in Vermigli's Doctrine of Man and Grace,'' Leiden: Brill, 1976, pp. 193-194.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thanks in part to the strength of Suárez's Jesuit order, his ''Disputationes Metaphysicae ''was widely taught in the Catholic schools of Spain, Portugal and Italy.

It also spread from these schools to many Lutheran universities in Germany, where the text was studied especially by those who favoured Melanchthon rather than Luther's attitude towards philosophy. In a number of seventeenth-century Lutheran universities the ''Disputationes'' served as a textbook in philosophy.

In a similar way, Suárez had major influence in the Reformed tradition of German and Dutch schools for both metaphysics and law, including international law. His work was highly praised, for example, by Hugo Grotius (1583-1645).

His influence is evident in the writings of [[Bartholomaeus Keckermann]] (1571–1609), [[Clemens Timpler]] (1563–1624), [[Gilbert Jack|Gilbertus Jacchaeus]] (1578–1628), [[Johann Heinrich Alsted]] (1588–1638), [[Antonius Walaeus]] (1573–1639), and [[Johannes Maccovius]] (Jan Makowski; 1588–1644), among others.&lt;ref&gt;Muller, Richard, ''Post-Reformation Reformed Dogmatics: The Rise and Development of Reformed Orthodoxy, ca. 1520 to ca. 1725,'' Grand Rapids, MI: Baker Academic, 2003, volume 3, passim.&lt;/ref&gt;  This influence was so pervasive that by 1643 it provoked the Dutch Reformed theologian [[Jacobus Revius]] to publish his book-length response: ''Suarez repurgatus.''&lt;ref&gt;Revius, Jacobus, ''Suarez repurgatus, sive, Syllabus Disputationum metaphysicarum Francisci Suarez Societatis Iesu theologi,'' Lugduni Batavorum, 1644.&lt;/ref&gt; Suárez's ''De legibus'' was cited as among the best books on law by the Puritan [[Richard Baxter]],&lt;ref&gt;Baxter, Richard, Preface to ''Methodus Theologiae Christianae,'' London, 1681.&lt;/ref&gt; and Baxter's friend [[Matthew Hale (jurist)|Matthew Hale]] drew on it for his natural-law theory.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Hale, [http://www.clpress.com/publications/law-nature ''Of the Law of Nature.''] CLP Academic. 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
The views of Suarez upon the human origin of political order, and his defense of tyrannicide emanating from popular dissent were heavily criticized  by English philosopher [[Robert Filmer]] in his work ''[[Patriarcha|Patriarcha, Or the Natural Power of Kings]]. ''Filmer believed the Calvinists and the Papists like Suarez to be dangerous opponents of [[Divine right of kings|divine right]] monarchy, legitimized by the supremacy of fathers upon their offspring, which Filmer claimed could be traced back to [[Adam]].&lt;ref&gt;Johann P. Sommerville, Raymond Geuss, "Filmer: Patriarcha and Other Writings (Cambridge Texts in the History of Political Thought)" Cambridge University Press, 1991. {{ISBN|0521399033}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2233">'''Gerardus Johannes Geers''', ([[Delft]], 10 December 1891 – [[Groningen (city)|Groningen]], the 2 May 1965), was a Dutch linguist and Hispanist. He wrote his thesis on the language of the [[Blackfoot]] Indians in North America but spent his career studying the Spanish language and Spanish culture.

In 1917 Geers travelled to Spain to become the governor of the children of the Dutch [[envoy (title)|envoy]] in Madrid. He mingled in leftist intellectual circles and translated [[Das Kapital]] in Spanish. Under the pseudonym of Cayo Graco he published articles in socialist periodics like [[Nuestra Palabra]] and [[El Comunista]]. Despite his [[diplomatic immunity]] as part of the household of the envoy he was expelled from Spain for alleged "subversive activities".

Geers made a career as a teacher and became a pioneer of hispanismo in the Netherlands. He translated [[Cervantes]], [[Unamuno]], [[Ortega y Gasset]] and [[Diez del Corral]]. As an hispanist he criticized the popular "[[Leyenda negra]]" and he defended King [[Philip II of Spain]] against the many accusitions.

In "El problema de los romances" (1920) Geers denied the popular thesis of [[Milá y Fontanals]] en [[Menéndez Pelayo]] that the Spanish literary romances were descended from the Spanish epic works. Geers proposed that they stood in the tradition of the middle-Latin lyrics. Geers thesis was falsified by E. [[García Gómez]] in his article "La lírica hispano-árabe y la aparición de la lírica románica" (Al-Andalus, XXI (1956)) based on recently discovered [[kharga]]-material.

Geers became a professor of Hispanic studies in Groningen.

'''''Goodbye to Language''''' ({{lang-fr|'''Adieu au Langage'''}}) is a 2014 French-Swiss [[3D film|3D]] [[Experimental film|experimental]] [[Fictional film|narrative]] [[Essay#Film|essay film]] written and directed by [[Jean-Luc Godard]]. It stars Héloïse Godet, Kamel Abdeli, Richard Chevallier, Zoé Bruneau, Jessica Erickson and Christian Grégori and was shot by cinematographer [[Fabrice Aragno]]. It is Godard's 42nd feature film and 121st film or video project. In the French-speaking parts of Switzerland where it was shot, the word "adieu" can mean both goodbye and hello. The film depicts a couple having an affair. The woman's husband discovers the affair and the lover is killed. Two pairs of actors portray the couple and their actions repeat and mirror one another. Godard's own dog Roxy Miéville has a prominent role in the film and won a prize at the Cannes Film Festival. Like many of Godard's films it includes numerous quotes and references to previous artistic, philosophical and scientific works, most prominently those of [[Jacques Ellul]], [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]] and [[Mary Shelley]].

Godard became interested in making a 3D film in 2010 and asked Aragno to make some camera tests. Aragno was dissatisfied with the results of professional 3D cameras and built his own custom rigs using [[Canon EOS 5D|Canon 5D]]s and [[Flip Video Mino|Flip Mino]]s. Aragno broke many of the standard rules for 3D cinematography. Godard and Aragno worked on the film for four years, each shooting footage independently before officially beginning production with the actors. Godard edited a 2D version of the film before he and Aragno perfected the 3D cut with [[color correction]] and [[surround sound]].{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

It premiered in competition at the [[2014 Cannes Film Festival]] and won the [[Jury Prize (Cannes Film Festival)|Jury Prize]]. It was distributed in France by [[Wild Bunch (film company)|Wild Bunch]] and in the US by [[Kino Lorber]], and won Best Picture at the [[2014 National Society of Film Critics Awards]]. It received a generally positive reception and was listed as one of the best films of the year on several  critics lists. In particular, praise went to its visual style, while criticism was levied at the plot, which some deemed "incomprehensible." &lt;ref name="Fandango Media"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/goodbye_to_language_3d/|title=ADIEU AU LANGAGE (GOODBYE TO LANGUAGE)|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Fandango Media]]|accessdate=April 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Goodbye to Language 3D Reviews"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/goodbye-to-language|title=Goodbye to Language 3D Reviews|work=[[Metacritic]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|accessdate=April 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many critics have attempted to analyze the film's themes and its use of 3D.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

Some of the film's more elaborate shots have been called innovative techniques of the film vocabulary.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} These include a "separation" shot in which a single, unbroken shot splits into two separate shots that can be viewed simultaneously through either the left or the right eye, and then returns to one single 3D shot. Aragno and Godard also experimented with [[Multiple exposure|double exposure]] 3D images and shots with [[parallax]] that are difficult for the human eye to see.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

''Goodbye to Language'' is an experimental narrative that tells two similar versions of a couple having an affair. These two stories are named "1 Nature" and "2 Metaphor", and they respectively focus on the couples Josette and Gédéon and Ivitch and Marcus – along with a dog (Godard's own dog Roxy).

The film begins with "1 Nature" at the Nyon cultural center. A young couple, Marie and her boyfriend, are setting up a used bookstand. Another couple, Davidson and Isabelle, arrive. By the way that Marie, her boyfriend, and later the character Ivitch address Davidson, it appears that he is a professor. Brandishing a copy of [[The Gulag Archipelago]], Davidson remarks that its author, [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]], did not need to use Google to search for the book's subtitle. The professor then asks Isabelle what thumbs used to be for before smartphones, making a punning reference to the French children's story [[Hop-o'-My-Thumb]]. He then proceeds to deliver an impromptu lecture on the ideas of [[Jacques Ellul]], such as the abdication of individual rights and responsibilities to the state, a situation that Ellul declared to be the triumph of [[Adolf Hitler]]. Abruptly a car drives up, a man gets out and, speaking in German, he accosts Josette, who has been standing nearby. After demanding that she come home (implying that the man is Josette's husband), threatening her with consequences, and trying to physically drag her away, the man retreats out of frame and fires shots from a gun. As the other characters rush to where the shots were fired, the car departs. Josette wanders away, while Gédéon, who has been watching all along, follows her. As Josette washes her hands in a fountain, Gédéon approaches and declares to her, "I am at your service."

The film switches to "2 Metaphor". At the Nyon lakefront Davidson is sitting on a bench looking through a book of [[Nicolas de Staël]] reproductions when Marie and her boyfriend arrive to say goodbye before they go to the United States. Ivitch arrives, dressed like Davidson in matching trench coat and hat. While the two discuss the tyranny of images, the German speaking man arrives and the scene plays out as before: he accosts Ivitch, fires his gun, and leaves. As before, a man approaches the shaken woman. This time it is the man that is offscreen and the woman who is onscreen (Ivitch behind metal bars – an image frequently used in promotion of the film). The man, Marcus, puts his hand on the bars and declares, "I am at your service."

The film returns to "1 Nature." Gédéon and Josette are in the process of having affair and are staying in a house together in the summer; they talk about literature and domestic issues. Gédéon references Rodin's ''The Thinker'' while sitting on a toilet and declares that people are made equal through the act of defecating. At some point, the scene shifts to Nyon where Marie examines the body of an unidentified man. Returning to Gédéon and Josette's affair, the dog Roxy frolics in the countryside as a narrator talks about human's relationship with dogs. He wanders into a car with Gédéon and Josette, who bring him home and continue talking with Roxy present. Josette mentions a knife that Gédéon gave her four years earlier. Gédéon and Josette leave to board a ferry, leaving Roxy behind.

The film returns to "2 Metaphor." Marcus and Ivitch have an affair in the same house in the winter; they talk about painting and political issues, such as Mao Zedong's opinion of the [[French Revolution]] and how Russians will never be Europeans. They have an argument while showering together, followed by shot of a bloody knife in a sink. As their relationship deteriorates, Ivitch reminds Marcus that he told her "I am at your service." Marcus declares that they should have children, Ivitch says that they should get a dog instead.

In an epilogue titled "3 Memory/historical misfortune" Roxy is again in the countryside while a voiceover narration representing Roxy's thoughts (and paraphrasing Clifford D. Simak's ''Time and Again'') wonders what the water is trying to say to him. A narrator mentions that Mary Shelley wrote ''Frankenstein'' near the couples house in [[Cologny]]; Shelley is seen in the country writing her book with quill and ink and is joined by [[Lord Byron]] and Percy Shelley. An unseen man and woman (Godard and Florence Colombani) paint with [[watercolors]] and black ink. They order Roxy out of the room and (paraphrasing Dostoyevsky's ''Demons'') compare [[Demons (Dostoyevsky novel)#Characters|Kirillov]]'s two questions, "a big one and a little one" (the other world and suffering) and the "difficult[y of] fit[ting] flatness into depth" to the act of creating art.  Roxy falls asleep on a couch as a narrator (Anne-Marie Miéville) describes his thoughts and the film ends with the sounds of a dog barking and a baby crying.

===References to other works===

Godard even quotes himself: "Showing a forest, easy. But showing a room with a forest nearby, ''difficult''" is paraphrased from Godard's 1958 review of [[Alexandre Astruc]]'s film ''[[One Life (1958 film)|Une Vie]]''. Some of the references are false, such as a Marcel Proust quote erroneously attributed to Claude Monet and a quote by [[William Faulkner]] that is not traceable in his known works.&lt;ref name=fendt/&gt;

Music in the film includes Alfredo Bandelli's folk song ''The Witch Hunt'', sung by Pino Masi. There are also brief fragments of [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]'s ''[[Symphony No. 7 (Beethoven)|Symphony no. 7, Second Movement]]'', [[Giya Kancheli]]'s ''Abii Ne Viderem'', [[Dobrinka Tabakova]]'s ''Suite in Old Style, Part II'', [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky]]'s ''[[Marche Slave|Slavic March]]'', [[Arnold Schoenberg]]'s ''[[Verklärte Nacht|Transfigured Night]]'', [[Jean Sibelius]]'s ''[[Symphony No. 2 (Sibelius)|Symphony No. 2]]'' and ''[[Valse triste (Sibelius)|Valse triste]]'' and [[Valentyn Sylvestrov]]'s ''Holy God''.&lt;ref name=fendt/&gt;

==Production==

[[File:Nyon street on the shore of lake Geneve.jpg|left|thumb|250px|Scenes from the film were shot on the [[Nyon]] lake front off of [[Lake Geneva]].]]

Godard first announced plans for the film during the [[2010 Cannes Film Festival]], when he said its title would be ''Adieu au Langage''. In a November 2010 interview, he joked that he wanted to cast [[Humphrey Bogart]] and [[Ava Gardner]], and said that "it's about a man and his wife who no longer speak the same language. The dog they take on walks then intervenes and speaks." He also revealed his interest in 3D and the possibility of using his own dog in the film. Godard initially wanted to cast major stars in the lead roles&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Brody |first=Richard |title=Dog Days |url=http://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/dog-days |work=The New Yorker |location=New York, NY |date=13 November 2010 |accessdate=31 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and asked [[Sophie Marceau]] and [[Vincent Cassel]] to play the couple.

Godard often re-wrote scenes the night before filming and allowed no [[Improvisation#Film|improvisation]] on set, aside from minor screen blocking.&lt;ref name=gore/&gt; One such improvisation involved an actress sitting in front of a lamp, resulting in [[lens flare]] that Aragno called "magic" in 3D.&lt;ref name=Dallas&gt;{{cite news |last=Dallas |first=Paul |title=1+1=3 |url=http://www.filmcomment.com/article/fabrice-aragno-interview |work=[[Film Comment]] |location=New York, NY |date=2014 |accessdate=22 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Godet said that Godard's direction was "very precise and very gentle, but clear and no discussion about it." There was very little rehearsal time for the actors, but Aragno took a lot of time to set up each shot.&lt;ref name=tafoya/&gt; French film historian Florence Colombani was asked to travel to Godard's home and act in the film, then discovered that he only wanted to film her hands drawing the [[Cross of Lorraine]] while she spoke her dialogue.&lt;ref name=Colombani/&gt;

Aragno said that he and Godard did not want to use 3D as a typical special effect or gimmick. Instead, they wished to use it "to express new things."&lt;ref name=Dallas/&gt; Several cameras were used, but the majority was shot on the [[Canon EOS 5D|Canon 5D]] and the [[Canon EOS-1D C|Canon 1DC]].&lt;ref name=Rizov/&gt; Other cameras included [[GoPro]]s and [[Lumix]]es.&lt;ref name=Bordwell/&gt; Aragno used [[Leica Camera#List of Leica lenses|Leica lenses]] on the Canons "because the Canon lenses are too perfect&amp;nbsp;... How can you fall in love with a digitally perfect person? To err is human! The Leica lenses have some involuntary imperfections."&lt;ref name=canon/&gt; The Canon cameras allowed them to shoot most of the film using [[Sunlight|natural]] or [[available light]] sources. Godard intentionally framed shots for 3D images, such as when the character's shadows are in 2D but the sidewalk is in 3D. The dog in the film is Godard's own pet Roxy Miéville, whom Godard would film whenever he took him for a walk. Godard used [[Camcorder#Consumer market|consumer cameras]] from [[Fujifilm]] and [[Sony]] for these shots.&lt;ref name=Rizov/&gt; Aragno also shot some footage independently before production officially began, including shots of his two children running around olive trees.&lt;ref name=Dallas/&gt;

Aragno recorded the sound during production and was later the [[Audio mixing|sound mixer]] during post-production. Godard edited a 2D [[rough cut]] of the film before he and Aragno worked on the 3D [[Film editing#Final cut|final cut]].&lt;ref name=Rizov/&gt; Godard edited the first cut alone on [[HDCAM]]. Aragno said that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;When he wants to insert something, he overlaps the images&amp;nbsp;... Jean-Luc separates the images he's editing from the editing console. He arranges the screen perpendicular to the console so that there's nothing between him and the image. He has to turn away to make the edit. He decides edits very quickly. After he's seen all the footage, he uses small thumbnails from photocopied or printed images of each scene, and makes books, gluing each image to a page.&lt;ref name=Dallas/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Aragno used Godard's first cut to manually synchronize the left and right images into the first 3D cut, which he said "took some time!" Godard was initially disappointed with the cut, which "had mono sound and very little color correction." On 18 March Aragno arranged a screening of a 3D cut with a stereo soundtrack for Godard at a Paris movie theater. Aragno said that they also edited a 2D version of the film that "layers the two images like a double exposure", which Godard thought may be the version screened at the Cannes Film Festival. Godard had not seen any 3D footage of the film until this screening and was immediately happy with the final result.&lt;ref name=Dallas/&gt;

The editing of the final cut took two weeks at Godard's home, which they nicknamed "Chez les Anglais". Godard and Aragno "set up three synchronized computers, [[Pro Tools]] for the Surround sound mix, [[Da Vinci Systems|Da Vinci Resolve]] for [[color correction]] and 3-D managing, and [[Final Cut Pro|Final Cut]] to play what was rendered by DaVinci synched with the ProTools sound mix. The idea was to mix, color correct, and edit at the same time in HD 3-D. We edited two minutes a session."&lt;ref name=Dallas/&gt;

===3D innovations===

{{quote box|bgcolor=#CCDDFF|align=right|width=25%|quote="In one scene we see a woman and an older man, her lover, sitting on a bench. A second man, her husband, appears with a gun and pulls the woman out of the shot and to the right. But instead of cutting back and forth between the action going on in the separate shots, Aragno used two cameras to capture both in 3D. The result is a layered image of the woman and her husband combined with the left-hand-side image of the man on the bench. If you close one eye, you will only see the woman and her husband, if you close the other you will only see the man on the bench, and if both eyes are open your brain will struggle to view them simultaneously. Yet at the end of the wild visual experiment, the separated images join back together in what Aragno has called a "romantic effect."|source=—Erin Whitney of ''[[The Huffington Post]]'' describing the first experimental "separation" shot of the film.&lt;ref name=Whitney&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/10/07/godard-goodbye-to-language-3d_n_5941170.html |last=Whitney |first=Erin |title=Godard's 3D Film 'Goodbye To Language' Is Making Cinematic History |work=[[The Huffington Post]]|location=New York, NY |date=7 October 2014 |accessdate=15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Shortly after finishing ''[[Film Socialism]]'' (and after the success of the American 3D film ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'') Godard asked Aragno to shoot some test footage in 3D.&lt;ref name=Dallas/&gt; With assistance from Battaggia and cinematographer Paul Grivas (Godard's nephew&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cinema-scope.com/spotlight/spotlight-film-socialisme-jean-luc-godard-switzerlandfrance/ |last=Picard |first=Andréa |title=Spotlight Film Socialisme (Jean-Luc Godard, Switzerland/France) |publisher=Cinema-Scope |date=2010 |accessdate=2 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;), Aragno researched&lt;ref name=cook/&gt; and experimented with 3D techniques and built his own custom camera rigs. He began by using "an expensive Panasonic camera that had built-in 3-D", but was unimpressed with the results.&lt;ref name=Dallas/&gt; In his experiments Arango concluded that the standard "rules" for 3D cinematography ("You can't be more than six centimeters between the two cameras. If the background and foreground are too far away, it cannot be good.") were not interesting.&lt;ref name=Rizov/&gt; Aragno then built a rig out of wood with two Canon 5Ds, which he said "was much more rough and expressive. Normally in two-camera 3-D, the cameras are very close together to minimize the [[parallax]]. With the rig I built, the two 5Ds were about five centimeters apart, producing a much harder 3-D image."&lt;ref name=Dallas/&gt; In his rig, one of the cameras was upside down "so I could register the sensors in the same angle-of-view for perfect or 'imperfect' 3D, avoiding parallax and so to get the best effect from both cameras. There were no computers involved in this calibration. Just a hammer and a chisel. It is artisan filmmaking."&lt;ref name=canon/&gt;

Aragno built another rig with two [[Flip Video Mino|Flip Mino]] cameras that allowed one of the cameras to pan. In a test with two children, Aragno said he: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;asked the boy to go to the kitchen on my right, and the right camera followed him and the left stayed, so the 3D broke. The girl is in your left eyes and the boy on the right. When he was in the kitchen, your brain didn't know how to watch. It hurts to watch a little, but it was interesting, and when the boy comes back to the girl, the two cameras were again in classic 3D. So I showed it to Jean-Luc and he decided to use this for the film.&lt;/blockquote&gt; 
Aragno also experimented with the distance between the two cameras, sometimes moving them closer or farther away than the industry standard of six centimeters.&lt;ref name=Rizov/&gt; Aragno later told ''[[the Huffington Post]],'' "I began thinking about making something in 3D that can only be in 3D&amp;nbsp;... 3D means two images, one left and one right, and both can be together, but you can also make one image different than the other."&lt;ref name=Whitney/&gt;

This technique of separating the 3D image has been called a new shot in filmmaking, although it is partially comparable to shots in the first 3D feature film ''[[The Power of Love (film)|The Power of Love]]''. Calum Marsh of ''[[The Dissolve]]'' said that "the vocabulary of the cinema has been enriched. There is a new tool available to filmmakers: a new technique, like the jump cut before it", and that in his previous films Godard has "been searching for a way to unify ideas—to join disparate images to create a new one. This shot is the realization."&lt;ref name=Marsh&gt;{{cite web |url=https://thedissolve.com/features/2014-in-review/866-the-shot-of-the-year/ |last=Marsh |first=Calum |title=The shot of the year |publisher=[[Pitchfork Media]] |location=Chicago, IL |date=19 December 2014 |accessdate=15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Erin Whitney of ''The Huffington Post'' wrote that "The moment is so innovative and unusual that Godard and his cinematographer, Fabrice Aragno, didn't even have a name for it (Aragno has referred to the shot as "separation," for lack of a better term)."&lt;ref name=Whitney/&gt; David Ehrlich of ''The Dissolve'' has described the technique as a "[[Choose Your Own Adventure|choose your own adventure]]" shot and wrote that "by rendering the disparate images separate but simultaneous, Godard has found a way for viewers to compare separate images at the moment they see them. ''Goodbye To Language'' effectively argues that every cut is [[porous]], and that seeing is just looking, if it's distracted by memory."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://thedissolve.com/reviews/1177-goodbye-to-language/ |last=Ehrlich |first=David |title=Goodbye To Language  |publisher=Pitchfork Media |location=Chicago, IL |date=28 October 2014 |accessdate=15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amy Taubin]] of ''Film Comment'' called the shot "a mindboggling, eyeball-dislocating, narratively profound sequence" and reported that after the shot concluded the audience erupted into applause at the film's premiere during the Cannes film festival.&lt;ref name=Taubin&gt;{{cite news |last=Taubin |first=Amy |authorlink=Amy Taubin |title=Dog Days |url=http://www.filmcomment.com/article/cannes-2014-amy-taubin |work=Film Comment |location=New York, NY |date=2014 |accessdate=15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jonathan Romney of ''Film Comment'' said that "it's in-camera magic of a [[Georges Méliès|Méliès]] vintage: a piece of cheap trickery, but brilliantly and simply carried off, finding hitherto unsuspected delight in a simple 'improper' use of 3-D."&lt;ref name=romney&gt;{{cite news |last=Romney |first=Jonathan |title= Film of the Week: Goodbye to Language |url= http://www.filmcomment.com/entry/film-of-the-week-goodbye-to-language |work=Film Comment |location=New York, NY |date=29 October 2014 |accessdate=24 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aragno also experimented with 3D images in post-production. These included "tests overlapping and combining 2-D and 3-D images. I wanted to 'encrust' different images and work on different planes in space" and mixing different 2D images to create [[Multiple exposure|double exposure]] 3D images. Godard later used some of these tests in his short film ''Les Trois Désastres'', included in the 2013 [[omnibus film]] ''[[3X3D]]''.&lt;ref name=Dallas/&gt;

==Reception==

===Cannes Film Festival premiere===

''Goodbye to Language'' premiered on 21 May 2014, at the Lumière Theater in competition at the [[2014 Cannes Film Festival]]. Godard was expected to attend the festival, but announced that he would not a few days before the screening. Godard told ''[[Radio Télévision Suisse]]'' that he did not want the [[Palme d'Or]] and would give it to his tax advisor if he won, just as he had done with his [[Academy Honorary Award|Honorary Oscar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Rochebin |first=Darius |title=Jean-Luc Godard: "Rien ne me fera aller au Festival de Cannes" |url=http://www.rts.ch/info/culture/5856805-jean-luc-godard-rien-ne-me-fera-aller-au-festival-de-cannes.html |work=Radio Télévision Suisse |language=French |date=20 May 2014 |accessdate=2 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly afterwards he sent a video letter to retiring festival president Gilles Jacob and artistic director Thierry Frémaux&lt;ref name=Taubin/&gt; explaining his absence from the festival and current state of mind.

==Themes and interpretations==

{{quote box|bgcolor=#CCDDFF|align=left|width=25%|quote="When - the sun already piercing - the river still sleeping in the dreams of fog, we do not see it anymore than it sees itself. Here it is already the river, and the eye is arrested, one no longer sees anything but a void, a fog which prevents one from seeing farther. In that part of the canvas, one must paint neither what one sees, since one sees nothing, nor what one doesn't see, since one must paint only what one sees; but to paint what one doesn't see."|source=—Quote used in the film's narration, attributed to [[Claude Monet]], but actually paraphrased from [[Marcel Proust]]'s ''[[Jean Santeuil]]''&lt;ref name=fendt/&gt; }}

Many film critics have complained that ''Goodbye to Language'' is difficult to understand. [[Todd McCarthy]] of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' said that "there are only fragments of thoughts, nothing is developed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=McCarthy |first=Todd |authorlink=Todd McCarthy |title='Goodbye to Language': Cannes Review |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/goodbye-language-cannes-review-706228 |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |location=Los Angeles, CA |date=21 May 2014 |accessdate=27 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charles Ealy of ''[[Austin American-Statesman|Austin 360]]'' compared it to watching [[Mike Myers]]'s ''[[Sprockets (Saturday Night Live)|Sprockets]]'' sketch from ''[[Saturday Night Live]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ealy |first=Charles |title='Goodbye to Language 3D' to screen in Austin |url=http://movies.blog.austin360.com/2015/01/27/goodbye-to-language-3d-to-screen-in-austin/ |work=[[Austin American-Statesman]] |location=Austin, TX |date=27 January 2015 |accessdate=31 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bordwell has criticized other reviewers' shallow analysis of the film, stating that "critics put off by Godard, I think, have too limited a notion of what criticism is."&lt;ref name=bordwell2/&gt;

Bordwell has called the film [[Opaque context|opaque]] with characters that are difficult to interpret, unexplained conflicts, and major plot points that occur off-camera. Godard also sometimes frames characters to make them unrecognizable to the audience, films scenes with overlapping dialogue of characters on and off screen, and uses [[Ellipsis (narrative device)|ellipses]] in scenes to create gaps in time. He also sometimes cuts to black frames, objects in the scene, or landscapes while dialogue from the scene is still heard. These techniques make the film both difficult to interpret and to comprehend. Bordwell believes "we ought to find problems of comprehension fascinating. They remind us of storytelling conventions we take for granted, and they push toward other ways of spinning yarns, or unraveling them." Bordwell believes that "blocking or troubling our story-making process serves to re-weight the individual image and sound. When we can't easily tie what we see and hear to an ongoing plot, we're coaxed to savor each moment as a micro-event in itself, like a word in a poem or a patch of color in a painting."&lt;ref name=Bordwell/&gt;

This "opaque" technique has been Godard's trademark style for many years. In 1995 Jean-Michel Frodon described the same complexities as Bordwell and wrote that &lt;blockquote&gt;when viewing a Godard film there are moments when one has the tendency to resist the experience. As the film unfolds you are suddenly confused, you don't quite grasp something and you feel like you are losing your footing. On the point of drowning one is liable to think Godard is vague and obscure but then there is a maritime movement/shift and if one lets oneself be carried by the next wave that comes one soon recovers the drift of the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Frodon |first=Jean-Michel |title=Jean-Luc Godard: Autoportrait en Melancholie |url=http://sensesofcinema.com/2001/jean-luc-godard-pt-1/godard_mozart/#b6 |work=Le Monde |date=March 9, 1995 |accessdate=February 5, 2015 |page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
When asked about the film's message, Godard rejected the premise of the question and contended, "rather, it would be the message of the absence of a message. It's a message in everyday life."&lt;ref name=canon/&gt; [[Colin MacCabe]] wrote that the film has no story: &lt;blockquote&gt;Instead there are patterns of images and sound overlaid with quotations from the authors&amp;nbsp;... There is the concern with history, above all Hitler and Nazism, and the understanding of history as making no distinction between image and reality, so that the history of the cinema and the history of the modern world wind in and out of each other.&lt;ref name=maccabe&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.criterion.com/current/posts/3192-godard-at-cannes-part-two |last=MacCabe |first=Colin |authorlink=Colin MacCabe |title=Godard at Cannes, Part Two |publisher=[[The Criterion Collection]] |date=June 12, 2014 |accessdate=January 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The film's title has a double meaning. In [[Vaud]], the French-speaking part of Switzerland where Godard was raised and currently lives, the word "adieu" can mean both goodbye and hello&lt;ref name=Monde/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Sachs |first=Ben |title=Jean-Luc Godard goes 3-D, hurls ideas in your face: Goodbye to Language ponders the future of communication |url=http://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/jean-luc-godard-goodbye-to-language-3-d-3d/Content?oid=16192129 |work=[[Chicago Reader]] |location=Chicago, IL |date=14 January 2015 |accessdate=16 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; "according to the time of day, the tone of voice." Godard has acknowledged that this interpretation would only be understood in Vaud and said "nowadays, it seems that talking has nothing to do, that speech no longer exists." He believes that words are losing all meaning and that "we are missing the point&amp;nbsp;... when I say 'Farewell' to language, it really means 'Farewell', meaning to say goodbye to my own way of speaking." However Godard believes that images, like films that mix words and visuals, are still capable of meaningful communication, citing [[Islamic]] and [[Christian]] prohibitions of certain images while allowing words as an example.&lt;ref name=canon/&gt; Godard said that in the sequence with Mary Shelley and himself painting with watercolors he wanted to visually show the physical acts of the language of writing and the language of visual art.&lt;ref name=Monde/&gt; Bordwell believes that a theme of the film is "the idea that language alienates us from some primordial connection to things."&lt;ref name=bordwell2/&gt;

===Use of 3D===

Godard became interested in 3D because "it is still an area where there are no rules" and thought it was not interesting because it had not yet been explored to its full potential. Godard thinks that technology, like a movie camera, "reveal[s] something cultural", such as what it "mean[s] about the times it emerged from" and also how it is limited by what it cannot do. Cinematic techniques such as [[CinemaScope]], [[Tracking shot|dolly shots]], [[close-ups]] or [[high fidelity]] are thought of as innovative, but actually create limitations by setting standards and rules in technique. He compares his experiments with 3D to early films by [[Auguste and Louis Lumière]] and [[D. W. Griffith]], who made films before there were "rules" about technique, stating "when technique is at its very beginnings, just like a child it knows no rules." His inspiration came from the invention of [[Perspective (visual)|perspective]] in painting, when the viewer understands the existence of space outside the painting's edges. Godard wanted to explore the illusion of depth in a 3D image suggesting something "beyond the frame."&lt;ref name=canon/&gt; Like the double exposure of a 3D image, the film contains two parallel narratives that repeat with two different couples.&lt;ref name=bordwell2/&gt; Godard was following [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s theory that "when you want something to be understood, you say it at least twice."&lt;ref name=canon/&gt;

Bryant Frazer of ''Studio Daily'' wrote that Godard breaks the conventional "rules" of 3D in five ways: "he does not keep a clean frame" in his screen compositions, "he embraces low-quality cameras", "he gravitates toward deep focus" cinematography, "he rips the 3D image apart and then restores it in a single shot" and "he uses stereo to elevate the mundane" instead of spectacular subjects like [[Superhero films|superhero]] or [[fantasy films]]. Frazer said that Godard "wants to experiment with the technology, draw attention to it, test its boundaries, and see what happens when the image falls apart completely."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.studiodaily.com/2014/10/five-ways-jean-luc-godard-breaks-the-3d-rules-in-farewell-to-language/ |last=Frazer |first=Bryant |title=Five Ways Jean-Luc Godard Breaks the 3D Rules in ''Farewell to Language'' |publisher=studiodaily.com |date=3 October 2014 |accessdate=31 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Brody of ''The New Yorker'' wrote that "rather than using 3-D as an effect to create a sensation of flight or to make a viewer feel like the target of propelled objects, Godard uses 3-D to emphasize the materiality, the physical properties, of the world at hand."&lt;ref name=brody/&gt; Bordwell said that, other than "to awe us with special effects", 3D's purposes are typically to be realistic in its enhancement of the depth of objects and "advancing our understanding of the story", which is usually achieved with only one part of the screen in 3D while the rest is out of focus and in 2D. In ''Goodbye to Language'' Godard uses 3D in deep focus shots with images that allow the audience to scan the entire frame. Bordwell wrote that Godard's use of 3D "is aiming to make us perceive the world stripped of our conceptual constructs (language, plot, normal viewpoints, and so on)."&lt;ref name=bordwell2/&gt;

Brody wrote that Godard "treated 3-D as a device of independent filmmaking&amp;nbsp;... he opens the art form up to yet another, virtual dimension. His use of 3-D is itself the film's big idea."&lt;ref name=brody/&gt; MacCabe wrote that Godard "uses [3D] to distance as well as engage" the audience instead of simply enhancing realism, which is influenced by [[Bertolt Brecht]].&lt;ref name=maccabe/&gt; [[Armond White]] wrote that Godard "uses the digital 3D fad to consider how men and women communicate&amp;nbsp;... and then, playfully, observes their dog's loyalty&amp;nbsp;... to demonstrate pure faith, pure curiosity, and his own imperviousness in an era when Reality and Digital Reality are confused." White believes that the film's use of 3D mocks the technique's supposed visual depth and instead uses it to examine the depth of human experience, such as "the dynamics of sexual, political, and artistic relations."&lt;ref name=white&gt;{{cite news |last=White |first=Armond |authorlink=Armond White |title=Goodbye to Language: Godard Goes 3D |url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/391512/goodbye-language-godard-goes-3d-armond-white |work=[[National Review]] |location=New York, NY |date=30 October 2014 |accessdate=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social interpretations===

[[File:Jacques Ellul (cropped).jpg|upright|250px|thumb|The works of philosopher [[Jacques Ellul]] and his predictions about technology are prominent in the film's themes.]]

Roxy Miéville appears with the couple, as well as with the unseen Godard and [[Anne-Marie Miéville]] at the end of the film. Godard and his long-term professional and romantic partner Miéville co-own Roxy,&lt;ref name=romney/&gt; but no longer live together.&lt;ref name=Colombani/&gt; During the film's production Godard would often talk about Miéville. Olivier Séguret of ''[[Libération]]'' observed that most of the film was shot in places Godard shared with Miéville in their personal life and that the dialogue between the two couples could be based on conversations between them.&lt;ref name=Seguret/&gt; When interviewed by [[NPR]], Bordwell interpreted the shots of Roxy as Godard "trying to get people to look at the world in a kind of an unspoiled way&amp;nbsp;... There are hints throughout the film that [[animal consciousness]] is kind of closer to the world than we are, that language sets up a barrier or filter or screen between us and what's really there. And although the film is full of language, talk, printed text and so on, nevertheless I think there's a sense he wants the viewer to scrape away a lot of the ordinary conceptions we have about how we communicate and look at the world afresh."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Dowell |first=Pat |title=At 83, Filmmaker Jean-Luc Godard Makes The Leap To 3-D |url=https://www.npr.org/2014/10/29/359658248/at-83-filmmaker-jean-luc-godard-makes-the-leap-to-3-d |publisher=[[National Public Radio]] |location=Washington DC |date=29 October 2014 |accessdate=15 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Godard said that it was partially true that he sees the world through Roxy's eyes&lt;ref name=Monde/&gt; and that Roxy "restores balance" to the couple when they are in conflict and represent "the commoners" while the couple represents "nobility" or "the clergy."&lt;ref name=canon/&gt; MacCabe wrote that Roxy "offer[s] an image of acceptable sociality" in the film.&lt;ref name=maccabe/&gt; In a scene with Roxy, a narrator talks about the [[Universal Declaration on Animal Welfare]], which Brody calls "Godard's one rare glimmer of historical optimism. It's as if Roxy were the agent of reconciliation—not of one merely lover to another but of Godard to the present day, to the rising generation."&lt;ref name=brody/&gt;

Jonathan Romney expressed his difficulty in jotting down each reference while watching the film, writing that "propositions, allusions, sounds, images rush on in wave after wave, each building a new layer on top of—or violently erasing—what's immediately gone before. Trying to make any sense of it all, even in the most rudimentary or provisional way, is an anguish-inducing process" and that "you might be closer to understanding a Godard film if you'd read everything the director had read—but then you'd also have to have read it all ''in exactly'' the same way that he had read it, making the same connections."&lt;ref name=romney/&gt; Ted Fendt wrote that "knowing the original sources of Godard's work often seems to me to be about as useful to 'unlocking' the films and videos as reading a heavily footnoted copy of ''[[The Waste Land]]''."&lt;ref name=fendt/&gt;

Brody has observed that many of the references have been used by Godard in his previous film, making them "self-referential and retrospective touches." He also relates the visual references to the political themes of the film and compares the archival footage of Nazi Germany and the Soviet Union in the first part as parallel to the scenes from [[Classical Hollywood cinema|classic films]] on TV screens in the second part. The historical footage "seem[s] to persist as an outsized influence on today's politics, stories, and even identities" while the Hollywood movies compel modern film characters to "live in the light of the history of cinema, of the great age of Hollywood and the [[Cinema of Europe|classic European]] cinema that also overarches and overawes the moderns."&lt;ref name=brody/&gt; One technique Godard uses is having narrative scenes suddenly cut to "a digression, a collage of found footage, intertitles, or other material that seems triggered by something mentioned in the scene." Bordwell has called this an "associational form" often used in essay films, similar to novelist [[John Dos Passos]]' use of newspaper stories in his ''[[USA trilogy]]''.&lt;ref name=Bordwell/&gt;

The film examines many historical events of the twentieth century, particularly the rise of Hitler, communism and technology. Godard quotes lengthy passages from Jacques Ellul's 1945 essay "Victoire d'Hitler?"&lt;ref name=fendt/&gt; In this essay Ellul wrote "everything Hitler said, he accomplished" and examined the dangers of the individual giving absolute power to the State. Ellul concluded that "everything that the State conquers as a power, it never loses. And that's Hitler's second victory."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ellul |first=Jacques |authorlink=Jacques Ellul |title=Victoire d'Hitler? |url=https://sites.google.com/site/libratextu/paroles-d-hommes/2009-07-un-inedit-de-jacques-ellul |language=French |work=Réforme |date=23 June 1945 |accessdate=4 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eric Kohn of ''Indiewire'' wrote that showing Ellul's essay being read off of a smart phone "portrays the information age as the dying breath of consciousness before intellectual thought becomes homogenized by digital advancements" and that the film "suggests humankind has grown limited by devices that tell us everything we think we need to know."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.indiewire.com/article/review-how-jean-luc-godards-goodbye-to-language-messes-with-your-eyes-and-your-head-20141028 |last=Kohn |first=Eric |title=Review: How Jean-Luc Godard's 'Goodbye to Language' Messes With Your Eyes &amp;ndash; And Your Head |work=Indiewire |date=28 October 2014 |accessdate=4 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also brief references to Africa,&lt;ref name=brody/&gt; such as Joceyln Benoist's quote: "Sir, is it possible to produce a concept about Africa?"&lt;ref name=fendt/&gt; Brody said this reference "suggests the poverty of modern philosophy—and of modern art—in addressing political crises that were wrongly relegated to the margins of the twentieth century and that have recently come to the fore."&lt;ref name=brody/&gt; White believes that the film's reference to ''Frankenstein'' is a "prophesy of the 21st century compulsion to debase ourselves into monsters and zombies—confused by the need to make sense of topical complexities. Our guilt-ridden age's retreat into a technology that pretends realism rather than moral imagination is pathetic."&lt;ref name=white/&gt; Brody interpreted the reference as a suggestion "that the book itself is an act of political metaphor and historical image creation."&lt;ref name=brody/&gt; MacCabe wrote that the film is Godard's most intense example of the director's increasing "extreme [[Calvinism]]", writing that "it is difficult not to feel that the film is, among other things, the work of an old [[Protestant]] pastor fulminating against the sins of the world and the irredeemable fallenness of man."&lt;ref name=maccabe/&gt;

'''Harvey Claflin Mansfield Jr.''' (born March 21, 1932) is an American [[political philosophy|political philosopher]]. He is the [[William R. Kenan, Jr.]] [[Professor]] of Government at [[Harvard University]], where he has taught since 1962. He has held [[Guggenheim Fellowship|Guggenheim]] and [[National Endowment for the Humanities|NEH]] Fellowships and has been a Fellow at the [[National Humanities Center]]; he also received the [[National Humanities Medal]] in 2004 and delivered the [[Jefferson Lecture]] in 2007. He is a Carol G. Simon Senior Fellow at [[Stanford University]]'s [[Hoover Institution]]. He is notable for his generally [[Conservatism|conservative]] stance on political issues in his writings.

Mansfield is the author and co-translator of studies of and/or by major political philosophers such as [[Aristotle]], [[Edmund Burke]], [[Niccolò Machiavelli]], [[Alexis de Tocqueville]], and [[Thomas Hobbes]], of [[Constitution|Constitutional government]], and of ''[[Manliness (book)|Manliness]]'' (2006). In interviews Mansfield has acknowledged the work of [[Leo Strauss]] as the key modern influence on his own political philosophy.&lt;ref name=HarlanKagay&gt;See, e.g.,&amp;nbsp;Josh Harlan and Christopher Kagay, [http://www.hcs.harvard.edu/~hrp/issues/1993/Mansfield.pdf "Harvey C.

==Early life and education==
Mansfield's father, Harvey Mansfield Sr., was the Ruggles Professor Emeritus of Public Law and Government at [[Columbia University]] at the time of his death in 1988 at the age of 83.&lt;ref name=dies&gt;{{cite news|title=Harvey Mansfield, 83; Taught at Columbia|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/05/10/obituaries/harvey-mansfield-83-taught-at-columbia.html|newspaper=New York Times|date=10 May 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mansfield has been at Harvard since his own student days in 1949, having joined the faculty in 1962. He received his [[Bachelor of Arts|A.B.]] at Harvard in 1953, served in the United States Army in Virginia and France, and then received his [[Ph.D.]] from Harvard 1961. 

==Personal life==
Mansfield was married to the late Delba Winthrop, with whom he co-translated and co-authored work on Tocqueville.

==Career==
===''A Student's Guide to Political Philosophy''===
In his 2001 book ''A Student's Guide to Political Philosophy'', Mansfield traces the history of political philosophy in "the great books" written by [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], [[John Locke|Locke]], [[Rousseau]], and others of the "highest rank" (1).&lt;ref name=MansfieldSGTPP&gt;Harvey C. Mansfield, ''A Student's Guide to Political Philosophy'' (Wilmington, Delaware: ISI Books, 2001). {{ISBN|1-882926-43-9}}. (Subsequent parenthetical references to this work follow in the text.)&lt;/ref&gt; He also finds [[political philosophy]] in practical [[politics]], which Mansfield considers necessarily partisan, because it involves citizens "arguing passionately pro and con with advocacy and denigration, accusation and defense" (2). He argues that politics does not merely consist of liberal and conservative options, but rather, they are fundamentally opposed to each other, with each side defending its own interest as it attempts to appeal to the [[common good]] (2). Since such adversarial sides in a political dispute appeal to the common good, an observer of the dispute can use his capacity to reason to judge which side supplies the most compelling arguments. If such an observer is competent to be a judge, he or she may be thought of as a political philosopher, or as at least on the way to engaging in political philosophy (2–3).

Mansfield stresses the connection between politics and political philosophy, but he does not find [[political philosophy]] in [[political science]], which for Mansfield is a rival to political philosophy and "apes" the natural sciences (3–5). From Mansfield's point of view, [[political science]] replaces words like "good", "just", and "noble" with other words like "utility" or "preferences." The terms are meant to be neutral, but as a result of the political scientist's purported change of role and perspective from judge to so‑called "disinterested observer", such a "scientist" is not able to determine whose arguments are the best, because he or she falls victim to [[relativism]], which, according to Mansfield, is "a sort of lazy [[dogmatism]]" (4–5).

In his guide, Mansfield reminds students that political science rebelled from political philosophy in the seventeenth century and declared itself distinct and separate in the [[Positivism|positivist]] movement of the late nineteenth century: thus, he argues in it that whereas "Today political science is often said to be 'descriptive' or 'empirical,' concerned with facts; political philosophy is called 'normative' because it expresses values. But these terms merely repeat in more abstract form the difference between political science, which seeks agreement, and political philosophy, which seeks the best" (6).

Furthermore, according to Mansfield, when people talk about the difference between political philosophy and political science, they are actually talking about two distinct kinds of political philosophy, one modern and the other ancient. The only way to understand modern political science and its ancient alternative fully, he stresses, is to enter the history of political philosophy, and to study the tradition handed down over the centuries: "No one can count himself educated who does not have some acquaintance with this tradition. It informs you of the leading possibilities of human life, and by giving you a sense of what has been tried and what is now dominant, it tells you ''where we are now'' in a depth not available from any other source" (7–8). Although modern political science feels no obligation to look at its roots, and might even denigrate the subject as if it could not be of any real significance, he says, "our reasoning shows that the history of political philosophy is required for understanding its substance" (7–8).

===Scholarship===
====Western civilization====
In response to [[multiculturalism]] on college campuses, Mansfield has defended the importance of preserving and teaching courses on [[Western civilization]], even proposing a survey course that selects a dozen or so books that capture the principal themes.  Mansfield believes that understanding Western civilization is important because the books that explain it deal with problems associated with the human condition.&lt;ref name="The Hoover Institution"/&gt;
====Defense of the "strong executive"====
Mansfield has argued that the President of the United States has "extra-legal powers such as commanding the military, making treaties (and carrying on foreign policy), and pardoning the convicted, not to mention a veto of legislation", observing that the [[U.S. Constitution]] does not ask the President to take an oath to execute the laws, but rather, to execute "the ''office'' of the president, which is larger."&lt;ref name=Mansfieldlawpres&gt;Harvey Mansfield, [http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/006/563mevpm.asp "The Law and the President:] In a National Emergency, Who You Gonna Call?" ''[[The Weekly Standard]]'', January 16, 2006, accessed February 5, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Referring to domestic surveillance, Mansfield notes, "those arguing that the executive should be subject to checks and balances are wrong to say or imply that the president may be checked in the sense of stopped. The president can be held accountable and made responsible, but if he could be stopped, the Constitution would lack any sure means of emergency action.&lt;ref name=Mansfieldlawpres/&gt; He defends the [[separation of powers]], arguing that "the executive subordinated to the rule of law is in danger of being subordinate to the legislature."&lt;ref&gt;Harvey C. Mansfield, [http://opinionjournal.com/federation/feature/?id=110010014 "The Case for the Strong Executive:] Under Some Circumstances, the Rule of Law Must Yield to the Need for Energy", ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', May 2, 2007, accessed June 17, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Taming the Prince''====
In his book ''Taming the Prince'', Mansfield traces the modern doctrine of executive power to [[Niccolò Machiavelli]].  He argues that executive power had to be tamed to become compatible with liberal constitutionalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mansfield|first=Harvey|title=Taming the Prince|year=1989|publisher=The Free Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;
====Gender roles and equality====
In his 2006 book ''[[Manliness (book)|Manliness]]'', Mansfield defended a moderately conservative understanding of [[gender role]]s, and bemoaned the loss of the virtue of [[Masculinity|manliness]] in a "[[Gender neutrality|gender neutral]]" society. In a ''[[New York Times]]'' interview, he defined the concept briefly as "confidence in a situation of risk. A manly man has to know what he is doing."&lt;ref name="Of Manliness and Men"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/12/magazine/312wwln_q4.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin Of Manliness and Men] from the [[New York Times]]&lt;/ref&gt; He defines the idea in more concrete terms in the book. There, a manly man does not have to know what he is doing, but only has to act as though he does. Also in the book, Mansfield subjects the concept of manliness to a test in which he refers for support of his argument to such diverse authorities as [[Homer]], [[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], [[Rudyard Kipling]], [[Ernest Hemingway]], and Naomi Wood. In his argument, manliness is ultimately related to [[assertiveness]]—"decisiveness without complete knowledge"—and its place in society is debated. In an interview with Bill Kristol, Mansfield said, "What I wrote was a modest defense of manliness. And the emphasis [is] on modest because manliness can be bad as well as good. Not everyone who takes risks deserves to have them turn out right and so manliness is, I think, responsible for a lot of evil. You can say that terrorists are manly, they’re willing to risk their lives and give their lives for a principle they believe in or a point they believe in."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mansfield|first1=Harvey|title=Conversations with Bill Kristol|url=http://conversationswithbillkristol.org/video/harvey-mansfield/|website=Conversations with Bill Kristol|accessdate=8 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Manliness'' was criticized by [[Martha Nussbaum]] in the June 22, 2006, issue of ''[[The New Republic]].''&lt;ref name="Nausbaum Criticism"&gt;[http://www.powells.com/review/2006_06_22] from ''[[The New Republic]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Nussbaum accuses Mansfield of misreading, or refusing to read, many feminist and nonfeminist texts. She argues that his book is based on overt misogynistic assumptions that take a position of indifference towards [[violence against women]]. Mansfield asserts, she contends, that a woman can resist rape only with the aid of "a certain ladylike modesty enabling her to take offense at unwanted encroachment".&lt;ref name="Nausbaum Criticism"/&gt;

Concerning controversial comments by former President of Harvard, [[Lawrence Summers]], about mental differences between men and women, Mansfield said that it is "probably true" that  women "innately have less capacity than men at the highest level of science...It's common sense if you just look at who the top scientists are".&lt;ref name="Of Manliness and Men"/&gt;

In 1993, Mansfield testified on behalf of Colorado's Amendment 2, which amended the state constitution to prevent gays, lesbians and bisexuals from pursuing legal claims of discrimination. In his testimony, he argued that being gay "is not a life that makes for happiness," that homosexuality is "shameful," and that by not being able to have children gay people were not "socially responsible."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1993/10/19/mansfield-speaks-in-gay-rights-trial/|title=Mansfield Speaks In Gay Rights Trial|date=19 October 1993|author=Anna D.

====Views on grades and affirmative action====
Mansfield has voiced criticism of [[grade inflation]] at [[Harvard University]], which he claims is due in part to [[affirmative action]].&lt;ref name=grades&gt;Harvey C. Mansfield, [http://chronicle.com/free/v47/i30/30b02401.htm "Point of View: Grade Inflation: It's Time to Face the Facts"], ''[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]'', April 6, 2001, accessed June 18, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Mansfield also participated in a debate  on [[affirmative action]] between [[Cornel West]] and [[Michael Sandel]] (arguing for affirmative action) with [[Ruth Wisse]] and himself (arguing against affirmative action). The debate attracted a "massive audience" of a thousand Harvard students, requiring its campus venue to be changed twice before it could take place on November 3, 1997, in Harvard's [[Sanders Theater]], prompting Professor Sandel to comment, "'This puts to rest the myth that this generation has a political apathy, and apathy to political debates.'"&lt;ref&gt;As qtd. in Luke McLoughlin, [http://www.digitas.harvard.edu/~perspy/old/issues/1997/dec/walking.html "Walking the Walk: Dialogue Is Only a Prelude to Involvement"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060901213551/http://www.digitas.harvard.edu/~perspy/old/issues/1997/dec/walking.html |date=2006-09-01 }}, archived issue of ''[[Digitas]]'' (Dec. 1997), accessed February 6, 2007. [Digitas is "a student organization dedicated to new technology" at [[Harvard University]].]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Mansfield, after hearing from a dean that "the most frequent grade is an A", claimed to give students two grades: one for their transcript, and the one he thinks they deserve. He commented, "I didn’t want my students to be punished by being the only ones to suffer for getting an accurate grade".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last =Slavov| first =Sita| title =How to Fix College Grade Inflation: Inflated grades are a serious problem, but there are ways to fix them.| website =US News &amp; World Report| date =26 December 2013| url =https://www.usnews.com/opinion/blogs/economic-intelligence/2013/12/26/why-college-grade-inflation-is-a-real-problem-and-how-to-fix-it| accessdate = 11 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to [[grade inflation]], according to ''[[Harvard Crimson]]'' reporters Lulu Zhou and Rebecca D. O'Brien, Mansfield revived the "ironic" (or the "inflated") grade in 2006, in order to let his students know what they really deserved in his class without causing them harm by grading them lower than the other professors at Harvard: "In Mansfield’s 'true and serious' grading system, 5 percent of students will receive A’s, and 15 percent will receive A-minuses. But Mansfield won’t share those marks with anyone other than his teaching fellows and students. ... By contrast, Mansfield’s 'ironic' grade—the only one that will appear on official transcripts—will follow average grade distribution in the College, with about a quarter of students receiving A’s and another quarter receiving A-minu[s]es"; in contrast, their privately received deserved "real" (lower) grades usually centered around a C or C-minus, earning him the nickname "Harvey C-minus Mansfield."&lt;ref&gt;Lulu Zhou, [http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=511242 "'C-minus' Prof to Give More As"], ''[[The Harvard Crimson]]'', February 13, 2006, accessed February 9, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; "This [grading] policy—meant to demonstrate the causes and effects of grade inflation—drew heat from students and faculty, and attracted national media attention."&lt;ref name=OBrien&gt;Rebecca D. O'Brien, [http://www.thecrimson.com/article.aspx?ref=348199 "Professor Fights Grade Inflation, Affirmative Action"], ''[[The Harvard Crimson]]'', June 2, 2003, accessed February 6, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Mansfield himself has joked that his middle initial "C." stands for compassion: "That's what I lack when it comes to grading."&lt;ref name=OBrien/&gt; In an interview with the Hoover Institution, Mansfield claimed that college professors are too quick to label students as exceptional.&lt;ref name="The Hoover Institution"&gt;{{cite web|title=Harvey Mansfield – The Left on Campus|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT-rixDQM9A|work=The Hoover Institution|publisher=The Hoover Institution|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
====Jefferson Lecture====
On May 8, 2007, Mansfield delivered the 36th [[Jefferson Lecture]] ("the highest honor the federal government bestows for distinguished intellectual and public achievement in the humanities", according to the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]], which sponsored the lecture).&lt;ref name=NEH&gt;[http://www.neh.gov/news/archive/20070322.html "Harvey Mansfield, Noted American Author and Political Theorist, to Deliver the 2007 Jefferson Lecture in the Humanities"], press release, ''[[National Endowment for the Humanities]]'', March 22, 2007, accessed June 3, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NEHAboutJL&gt;[http://www.neh.gov/whoweare/Mansfield/HMabout.html "About the Jefferson Lecture"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070519000428/http://www.neh.gov/whoweare/Mansfield/HMabout.html |date=2007-05-19 }}, ''[[National Endowment for the Humanities]]'', accessed June 16, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mansfield&gt;Harvey C. Mansfield, [http://www.neh.gov/whoweare/Mansfield/HMlecture.html "How to Understand Politics: What the Humanities Can Say to Science"], 36th Jefferson Lecture in the Humanities, presented on May 8, 2007, at the [[Warner Theatre (Washington, D.C.)|Warner Theatre]], [[Washington, D.C.]], ''neh.gov'' ([[National Endowment for the Humanities|NEH]]), accessed June 16, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In his lecture, Mansfield suggests "two improvements for today’s understanding of politics arising from the humanities ... first ... to recapture the notion of [[thumos]] in [[Plato]], and [[Aristotle]]... [and] ...second ... the use of names—proper to literature and foreign to science".&lt;ref name=Mansfield/&gt;

This is a reference to his own philosophy, which forbids discounting the wisdom of the past simply because those who spoke it lived a long time ago.

'''Havi Carel''' ({{lang-he|חוי כראל}}) is a professor of [[philosophy]] at the [[University of Bristol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bristol.ac.uk/school-of-arts/people/havi-h-carel/index.html|title=Professor Havi Carel - School of Arts|website=Bristol.ac.uk|accessdate=5 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education and career ==
Carel studied for a BA and MA at [[Tel-Aviv University]] and was awarded her PhD by the [[University of Essex]]. She was lecturer at the [[University of the West of England]] then moved to the [[University of Bristol]] as a senior lecturer and later promoted to professor.

Her research interests include [[philosophy of medicine]], [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], [[philosophy of death]], [[epistemic injustice]] and health, illness, and children, and film and philosophy. Carel is best-known for her work on the phenomenology of somatic illness, and has led AHRC-funded project on concepts of health, illness, and disease (2009–11), a [[Leverhulme Trust]]-funded the lived experience of illness (2011–12), a [[British Academy]] Mid-Career Fellowship (2012–13)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://info.uwe.ac.uk/news/uwenews/news.aspx?id=2240|title=UWE Bristol: News|website=info.uwe.ac.uk|accessdate=5 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and currently has a [[Wellcome Trust]] Senior Investigator Award  funded project, 'The Life of Breath'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lifeofbreath.org/about/meet-the-team/bristol-team/|title=Bristol Team|date=4 November 2015|website=Lifeofbreath.org|accessdate=5 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Carel was diagnosed with [[lymphangioleiomyomatosis]], a life-limiting lung disease, and much of her academic work reflects her own lived experiences as an ill person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/havi-carel-my-10-year-death-sentence-5332425.html|title=Havi Carel: My 10-year death sentence|website=Independent.co.uk|accessdate=5 August 2018|date=2007-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Ich und Du''''', usually translated as '''''I and Thou(You)''''', is a book by [[Martin Buber]], published in 1923, and first translated from German to English in 1937.

==Premise==
Buber's main proposition is that we may address [[existence]] in two ways:
# The attitude of the "I" towards an "It", towards an object that is separate in itself, which we either use or experience.
# The attitude of the "I" towards "Thou", in a relationship in which the other is not separated by discrete bounds.
One of the major themes of the book is that human life finds its meaningfulness in [[Interpersonal relationship|relationships]]. In Buber's view, all of our relationships bring us ultimately into relationship with [[God]], who is the Eternal Thou.

Buber explains that humans are defined by two word pairs: ''I-It'' and ''I-Thou''.

The "It" of ''I-It'' refers to the world of experience and sensation. ''I-It'' describes entities as discrete objects drawn from a defined set (e.g., he, she or any other objective entity defined by what makes it measurably different from other entities).  It can be said that "I" have as many distinct and different relationships with each "It" as there are "Its" in one's life. Fundamentally, "It" refers to the world as we experience it.

By contrast, the word pair ''I-Thou'' describes the world of relations.  This is the "I" that does not objectify any "It" but rather acknowledges a living relationship. ''I-Thou'' relationships are sustained in the spirit and mind of an "I" for however long the feeling or idea of relationship is the dominant mode of perception.  A person sitting next to a complete stranger on a park bench may enter into an "I-Thou" relationship with the stranger merely by beginning to think positively about people in general.  The stranger is a person as well, and gets instantaneously drawn into a mental or spiritual relationship with the person whose positive thoughts necessarily include the stranger as a member of the set of persons about whom positive thoughts are directed.  It is not necessary for the stranger to have any idea that he is being drawn into an "I-Thou" relationship for such a relationship to arise. But what is crucial to understand is the word pair "I-Thou" can refer to a relationship with a tree, the sky, or the park bench itself as much as it can refer to the relationship between two individuals. The essential character of "I-Thou" is the abandonment of the world of sensation, the melting of the between, so that the relationship with another "I" is foremost.

Buber's two notions of "I" require attachment of the word "I" to a word partner. The splitting into the individual terms "I" and "it" and "thou" is only for the purposes of analysis. Despite the separation of "I" from the "It" and "Thou" in this very sentence describing the relationship, there is to Buber's mind either an ''I-Thou'' or an ''I-It'' relationship.  Every sentence that a person uses with "I" refers to the two pairs: "I-Thou" and "I-It", and likewise "I" is implicit in every sentence with "Thou" or "It". Each It is bounded by others and It can only exist through this attachment because for every object there is another object.  Thou, on the other hand, has no limitations. When "Thou" is spoken, the speaker has no thing (has nothing), hence, Thou is abstract; yet the speaker “takes his stand in relation”.

What does it mean to experience the world? One goes around the world extracting knowledge from the world in experiences betokened by "He", "She", and "It". One also has ''I-Thou'' relationships. Experience is all physical, but these relationships involve a great deal of [[spirituality]]. The twofold nature of the world means that our being in the world has two aspects: the aspect of experience, which is perceived as I-It, and the aspect of relation, which is perceived as I-Thou.

==Examples==
Buber uses an example of a tree and presents five separate relations:
# Looking at the tree as a picture with the color and detail through the aesthetic perception.
# Identifying the tree as movement. The movement includes the flow of the juices through the veins of the tree, the breathing of the leaves, the roots sucking the water, the never-ending activities between the tree and earth and air, and the growth of the tree.
# Categorizing the tree by its type; in other words, studying it.
# Exercising the ability to look at something from a different perspective. “I can subdue its actual presence and form so sternly that I recognize it only as an expression of law”.
# Interpreting the experience of the tree in mathematical terms.
Through all of these relations, the tree is still an object that occupies time and space and still has the characteristics that make it what it is.&lt;ref&gt;Kaufman's translation, Touchstone edition, 1996, pp. 47–58.&lt;/ref&gt;

If "Thou" is used in the context of an encounter with a human being, the human being is not He, She, or bound by anything. You do not ''experience'' the human being; rather you can only relate to him or her in the sacredness of the I-Thou relation. The I-Thou relationship cannot be explained; it simply is. Nothing can intervene in the I-Thou relationship. I-Thou is not a means to some object or goal, but a definitive relationship involving the whole being of each subject.

Like the I-Thou relation, love is a subject-to-subject relationship. Love is not a relation of subject to object, but rather a relation in which both members in the relationship are subjects and share the unity of being.

The ultimate Thou is God. In the I-Thou relation there are no barriers. This enables us to relate directly to God. God is ever-present in human consciousness, manifesting in music, literature, and other forms of culture. Inevitably, Thou is addressed as It, and the I-Thou relation becomes the being of the I-Thou relation. God is now spoken to directly, not spoken about.

There is no world that disconnects one from God, a world of It alone, when I-Thou guides one’s actions. "One who truly meets the world goes out also to God." God is the worldwide relation to all relations.

'''Jeanne Hersch''' ([[Geneva]], 13 July 1910 – Geneva, 5 June 2000) was a Swiss philosopher of [[Poles|Polish]]-[[Jewish]] origin, whose works dealt with the concept of freedom.

She studied under the existentialist [[Karl Jaspers]] in Germany in the early 1930s. In 1956, she was appointed to a professorship at the [[University of Geneva]], one of the first women to hold such a post at a Swiss university, holding the post until 1977. From 1966 to 1968 she headed the philosophy division of [[UNESCO]], and was a member of its executive commission from 1970 to 1972.&lt;ref name="LA Times"&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2000/jun/08/local/me-38976 Los Angeles Times obituary], June 08, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968 she edited ''[[Le droit d'être un homme]], une anthologie mondiale de la liberté'' in French (translated in English in 1969 as ''Birthright of man: a selection of texts'' and also in Greek as ''Το δικαίωμα να είσαι άνθρωπος''), an anthology of writings on [[human rights]], republished in French in 1984 and 1990.&lt;ref&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0000/000000/000029eo.pdf Electronic copy (PDF) of ''Birthright of man'' in English] at UNESCO&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20121109102702/http://www.aidh.org/Livres/Hersch.htm Le Droit d'etre un Homme]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, she received the [[Einstein Medal]].&lt;ref name="Einstein"&gt;[http://www.einstein-bern.ch/index.php?lang=en&amp;show=medaille Albert Einstein Medal Laureates]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
[[Jnana|Jñāna]] in [[Sanskrit]] means "[[knowledge]]".{{sfn|Apte|1965|p=457}} The root [[:wikt:ज्ञान|jñā-]] is cognate to English ''[[:wikt:know|know]]'', as well as to the Greek [[:wikt:γιγνώσκω|γνώ-]] (as in γνῶσις ''[[gnosis]]''). Its antonym is ''ajñāna'' "ignorance".

==Definition==
''Jnana'' is knowledge, and refers to any cognitive event that is correct and true over time. It particularly refers to knowledge inseparable from the total experience of its object, especially about reality (non-theistic schools) or supreme being (theistic schools).&lt;ref name="brittanica on jnana"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/304133/jnana |title=jnana (Indian religion) - Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Hinduism, it is knowledge which gives [[Moksha]], or spiritual release while alive ([[jivanmukti]]) or after death ([[videhamukti]]).{{sfn|Matilal|2005|p=4928}} According to Bimal Matilal, ''jnana yoga'' in Advaita Vedanta connotes both primary and secondary sense of its meaning, that is "self-consciousness, awareness" in the absolute sense and relative "intellectual understanding" respectively.{{sfn|Matilal|2005|p=4928}}

According to Jones and Ryan, ''jnana'' in ''jnana yoga'' context is better understood as "realization or gnosis", referring to a "path of study" wherein one knows the unity between self and ultimate reality called Brahman in Hinduism. This explanation is found in the ancient [[Upanishad]]s and the [[Bhagavad Gita]].{{sfn|Jones|Ryan|2006|pp=2, 215}}

Jñāna yoga is the path towards attaining ''jnana''. It is one of the three classical types of [[yoga]] mentioned in [[Hindu]] philosophies, the other two being [[karma yoga]] and [[bhakti]].{{sfn|Matilal|2005|p=4928}} In modern classifications, [[classical yoga]], being called [[Raja yoga]], is mentioned as a fourth one, an extension introduced by [[Vivekananda]].{{sfn|Michelis|2005}} Jnana yoga, states Stephen Phillips, is the "yoga of meditation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephen Phillips|title= Yoga, Karma, and Rebirth: A Brief History and Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uLqrAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA179|year= 2009| publisher= Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-14485-8|page=258}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the three different paths to liberation, ''jnana marga'' and ''karma marga'' are the more ancient, traceable to Vedic era literature.&lt;ref name="Klostermaier2007p119"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeaneane D.

The [[classical yoga]] emphasizes the practice of [[Dhyana in Hinduism|dhyana]] (meditation), and this is a part of all three classical paths in Hinduism, including ''jñāna yoga''.{{sfn|Matilal|2005|p=4928}}{{sfn|Jones|Ryan|2006|p=73}}{{refn|group=note|See for example [[H. W. L.

==Upanishads==
In the [[Upanishads]], '''jnana yoga'' aims at the realization of the oneness of the individual self (Atman) and the ultimate Self (Brahman).{{sfn|Jones|Ryan|2006|p=511}} These teachings are found in the [[Principal Upanishads|early Upanishads]].&lt;ref name=ravi3/&gt; According to Chambliss, the mystical teachings within these Upanishads discuss "the way of knowledge of the Self", a union, the realization that the Self (Atman) and the Brahman are identical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=J.J. Chambliss|title=Philosophy of Education: An Encyclopedia |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HzKTbwprbqYC&amp;pg=PA271 |year=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-51168-4|page=271}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The teachings in the Upanishads have been interpreted in a number of ways, ranging from non-theistic monism to theistic dualism.&lt;ref name=perrett45/&gt;&lt;ref name=horosz257/&gt; In former, rituals are not necessary and a path of introspection and meditation is emphasized for the correct knowledge (''jnana'') of self. In latter, it is the full and correct knowledge of a Vishnu avatar or Shiva or Shakti (Goddess) that is emphasized. In all its various interpretations, the paths are not necessarily mutually exclusive. A ''Jnana yogi'' may also practice ''Karma yoga'' or ''Bhakti yoga'' or both, and differing levels of emphasis.&lt;ref name=perrett45/&gt;&lt;ref name=horosz257&gt;{{cite book|author1=W. Horosz|author2=Tad Clements|title=Religion and Human Purpose: A Cross Disciplinary Approach|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=o5-hBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA257|year= 2012|publisher= Springer Science|isbn=978-94-009-3483-2|pages=257–258}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Robert Roeser, the precepts of ''Jnana yoga'' in Hinduism were likely systematized by about 500 BCE, earlier than ''Karma yoga'' and ''Bhakti yoga''.&lt;ref&gt;Robert W. Roeser (2005), An introduction to Hindu Indiaís contemplative psychological perspectives on motivation, self, and development, in M.L. Maehr &amp; S. Karabenick (Eds.), ''Advances in Motivation and Achievement'', Volume 14: Religion and Motivation, Amsterdam: Elsevier, {{ISBN|978-07623-12-597}}, pp 305-308&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bhagavad Gita==
In the Bhagavad Gita, ''jnana yoga'' is also referred to as ''buddhi yoga'' and its goal is self-realization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=M. V. Nadkarni|title=The Bhagavad-Gita for the Modern Reader: History, interpretations and philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x_EwDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT266| year=2016|publisher= Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn= 978-1-315-43898-6|page=266}}&lt;/ref&gt; The text considers ''jnana marga'' as the most difficult, slow, confusing for those who prefer it because it deals with "formless reality", the ''avyakta''. It is the path that intellectually oriented people tend to prefer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Eknath Easwaran|title=Essence of the Bhagavad Gita: A Contemporary Guide to Yoga, Meditation, and Indian Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xcvJAAAAQBAJ|year=2011|publisher=Nilgiri Press|isbn=978-1-58638-068-7|pages=118, 281}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The chapter 4 of the ''Bhagavad Gita'' is dedicated to the general exposition of ''jnana yoga'', while chapters 7 and 16 discuss its theological and axiological aspects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jeaneane D.

{{Quote|
Truly, there is nothing here as pure as knowledge.
In time, he who is perfected in yoga finds that in his own Atman.

==Traditions==
The [[Advaita]] philosopher [[Adi Shankarar]] gave primary importance to jñāna yoga for the "knowledge of the absolute" ([[Brahman]]), while the [[Vishishtadvaita]] commentator [[Ramanujar]] regarded knowledge only as a condition of devotion.{{sfn|Flood|1996|p=127}}

===Classical Advaita Vedanta===
====Behaviors====
Classical Advaita Vedanta emphasises the path of Jnana Yoga to attain [[moksha]].

====Practices====
''Jnanayoga'' for Advaitins consists of three practices:&lt;ref name=davis38/&gt; ''sravana'' (hearing), ''manana'' (thinking) and ''nididhyasana'' (meditation).{{sfn|Mayeda|1992|p=xvii}} This three-step methodology is rooted in the teachings of chapter 4 of the ''[[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]]'':&lt;ref name="RaoParanjpe2015p6"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John A. Grimes|title=A Concise Dictionary of Indian Philosophy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qcoUFYOX0bEC&amp;pg=PA99|year=1996|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-0-7914-3067-5|pages=98–99}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Sravana'' literally means hearing, and broadly refers to perception and observations typically aided by a counsellor or teacher ([[guru]]),{{Sfn| Deutsch|1973|pp=106-110}} wherein the Advaitin listens and discusses the ideas, concepts, questions and answers.{{sfn|Mayeda|1992|p=xvii}}&lt;ref name="RaoParanjpe2015p6"/&gt;
*''Manana'' refers to thinking on these discussions and contemplating over the various ideas based on ''svadhyaya'' and ''sravana''.&lt;ref name="RaoParanjpe2015p6"&gt;{{cite book|author1=K. Ramakrishna Rao|author2=Anand C.

*''Nididhyāsana'' refers to meditation,&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803100234232 Oxford Index, ''nididhyāsana'']&lt;/ref&gt; realization and consequent conviction of the truths, non-duality and a state where there is a fusion of thought and action, knowing and being.{{sfn|Dalal|2009|p=16}}&lt;ref name="RaoParanjpe2015p6"/&gt;

These practices, with the help of a [[guru]] are believed to lead to correct knowledge, which destroys ''avidya'', psychological and perceptual errors related to Atman and Brahman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Śaṅkarācārya|author2=Sengaku Mayeda|title=A Thousand Teachings: The Upadeśasāhasrī of Śaṅkara|year=2006|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-8120827714|pages=78–79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Saivism===
Both the theistic and monistic streams of [[Shaivism]] include ''jnana yoga'' ideas, along with those related to ''karma yoga'', and in the case of Saiva Siddhanta ideas related to ''bhakti yoga''. The Shaivism traditions do not consider renunciation necessary for practicing jnana yoga, leaving ascetic yogi lifestyle optional.&lt;ref name="Sivaraman1973p392"/&gt; Spirituality can be pursued along with active life (''karma''), according to Shaiva traditions, and it believes that this does not hinder ones ability to journey towards self (Shiva within) realization. The traditions dwell into this integration of karma yoga with jnana yoga, such as by ranking daily behavior and activity that is done by choice and when not necessary as higher in spiritual terms than activity that is impulsive or forced.&lt;ref name="Sivaraman1973p392"&gt;{{cite book|author=K. Sivaraman|title=Śaivism in Philosophical Perspective: A Study of the Formative Concepts, Problems, and Methods of Śaiva Siddhānta|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I1blW4-yY20C|year=1973|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-1771-5|pages=371, 392–397}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The methodology of sravana, manana and nididhyasana similar to Advaita Vedanta are also found in various traditions of Shaivism. However, ''nistha'' or ''samadhi'' is sometimes added in Shaiva methodology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=K. Sivaraman|title=Śaivism in Philosophical Perspective: A Study of the Formative Concepts, Problems, and Methods of Śaiva Siddhānta|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I1blW4-yY20C|year=1973|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-1771-5|pages=384, 388–391}}&lt;/ref&gt; The meditational aspects of Shaivism focus on the [[Nirguna Brahman|nirguna]] form of Supreme Reality (Shiva).&lt;ref name="Schomer1987p57"/&gt;

===Vaishnavism===
The ''Pancharatra'' ([[Agama (Hinduism)|agama]]) texts of [[Vaishnavism]], along with its Bhagavata (Krishna, Rama, Vishnu) tradition, are strongly influenced by ''jnana yoga'' ideas of the Upanishads.&lt;ref name="Schomer1987p57"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Karine Schomer|author2=W. H. McLeod|title=The Sants: Studies in a Devotional Tradition of India|url =https://books.google.com/books?id=OkKhOivXrhgC&amp;pg=PA57| year=1987| publisher= Motilal Banarsidass|isbn=978-81-208-0277-3|pages=57, 42–43, 140–141}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Vaishnavism also incorporates Bhakti yoga concepts of loving devotion to the divine Supreme personally selected by the devotee, in [[Saguna Brahman|saguna]] form, both in silent meditational and musical expressive styles.&lt;ref name="Schomer1987p57"/&gt;

The aim of jnana yoga in Vaishnavism differs from that in other schools. Advaita, for example, considers jnana yoga as the path to nondual self-knowledge and moksha. Vaishnavism, in contrast, considers it a condition of devotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gavin D. Flood|title=An Introduction to Hinduism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KpIWhKnYmF0C|year=1996|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-43878-0|page=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shaktism===
The Shaktism literature on goddess such as ''Kularnava Tantra'' highlight ''jnana marga'' as important to liberation. It differentiates between two kings of ''jnana'': one it calls knowledge that comes from Agama texts, and another it calls ''viveka'' (insight). The Shaktism literature then adds that both lead to the knowledge of Brahman, but the first one is in the form of sound (''shabdabrahman''), while the insight from within is the ultimate truth (''parabrahman'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=June McDaniel|title=Offering Flowers, Feeding Skulls: Popular Goddess Worship in West Bengal |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=caeJpIj9SdkC&amp;pg=PA98 |year=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-534713-5|pages=98–99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Shakta texts, such as the ''[[Sita Upanishad]]'', combine yoga of action and knowledge as a path to liberation. The ''[[Devi Gita]]'', a classic text of Shaktism, dedicates chapter 4 to ''Jnana yoga'', stating that a Jnana yogi understands and realizes that there is no difference between the individual soul and herself as the supreme Self.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Cheever Mackenzie Brown|title=The Devi Gita: The Song of the Goddess: A Translation, Annotation, and Commentary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=28CIEnZCcqMC&amp;pg=PA161 |year=1998|publisher=State University of New York Press|isbn=978-0-7914-3939-5|pages=161–162, for full context and translations: 150–163}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discussion of Jnana yoga continues through the later chapters of the ''Devi Gita''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=C.

'''Jo Gwangjo''' ({{korean|hangul=조광조|hanja=[[wikt:趙|趙]][[wikt:|光]][[wikt:祖|祖]]}}, 23 August 1482 – 10 January 1520), also often called by his pen name Jeong-am ({{korean|hanja=[[wikt:靜|靜]][[wikt:庵|庵]]||hangul=정암}}), was [[Neo-Confucianism|Korean Neo-Confucian]] scholar who pursued radical reforms during the reign of [[Jungjong of Joseon]] in the early 16th century.

He was framed with charges of factionalism by the power elite that opposed his reform measures and was sentenced to drink poison in the [[Korean literati purges|Third Literati Purge of 1519]].  He has been widely venerated as a Confucian martyr and an embodiment of "[[seonbi]] spirit" by later generations in Korea.  Some historians consider him one of the most influential figures in 16th century Korea.  He's one of the 18 Sages of Korea ({{hangul|동방18현}}) and honored as [[Munmyo]] Baehyang ({{korean|hanja=文廟配享|hangul=문묘배향}}).&lt;ref&gt;Joseon Annals, September 15, 1604. No. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life ==

===Early years===
[[File:Cho Gwang-jo01.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Jo Gwangjo]]
Jo Gwangjo was the son of Jo Wongang (조원강, 趙元綱) and was from the Hanyang Jo clan (한양조씨, 漢陽趙氏). Jo studied under neo-Confucian scholar [[Kim Gwoeng-pil]], [[Kim Jong-jik]]'s disciple who was in exile at the time following the [[Korean Literati Purges|First Literati Purge of 1498]].  When Kim Gwoeng-pil was later executed (by poison) following the Second Literati Purge of 1504, Jo was exiled for being Kim's disciple.

At this time, [[Joseon Dynasty politics]] was primarily marked by power struggle between two aristocratic yangban factions - the established "Hungu" power elites who were generally conservative and the upstart [[Sarim]] scholars called [[seonbi]]s, who belonged to neo-Confucian school of Kim Jong-jik and other thinkers. Sarim faction had entered the court politics during the reign of [[Seongjong of Joseon|King Seongjong]] but suffered two bloody purges under his successor [[Yeonsangun]].  When Yeonsangun was eventually deposed in 1506, [[Jungjong]] was placed on the throne as the eleventh king of Joseon by the Hungu leaders who led the coup. For first ten years of his reign, Jungjong could not truly rule the country with regal authority (he was forced to depose his faithful queen because her father was killed by the coup leaders, and they feared that the queen might take revenge.)  However, three main coup leaders died of natural causes by then, and Jungjong began to welcome Sarim scholars to his court to check Hungu faction's power.  The Sarim faction considered Hungu faction as a whole as greedy and corrupt men unworthy of respect and sought to establish ideal neo-Confucian society.  (Indeed, many of coup leaders had enjoyed Yeonsangun's favor during most of his reign, and their chief Park Won-jong led the coup mainly for personal revenge for his sister was raped by Yeonsangun.)

Jo Gwangjo came from a prominent family that belonged to Hungu faction but was called "crazy man" and "source of disaster" by people around him for studying neo-Confucianism under exiled Sarim scholar Kim Gwoeng-pil at the height of persecution of the Sarim faction.  In 1510, Jo Gwangjo passed the [[Gwageo]] exam and became a student at Royal Academy called [[Seonggyungwan]].  He was often recommended for a court position by high officials and fellow students at Seonggyngwan, but he delayed entering civil service to pursue further study until 1515, when he was recommended to King Jungjong by Minister of Personnel Ahn Dang and 200 Seonggyungwan students and was immediately appointed to a position of junior sixth rank.  However, he was ashamed to take office with others' help and took Al-seung-si exam, and his essay caught Jungjong's attention.

By then, Jo was already known for unbending and outspoken character as he soon emerged as the leader of Sarim faction.  For instance, when he became a jung-un, lowest position at Office of Censors, the first thing he did on the following day was to petition the king to fire all his superiors at the Office of Censors and Office of Inspector General.  At the time, two Sarim officials had petitioned the king to restore status of the deposed queen, who was deposed by Hungu faction.  [[Joseon Dynasty#Three Offices|Office of Inspector General and Office of Censors]] had them exiled for their impertinent petition.  Jo Gwangjo argued that two offices violated their given function by suppressing free speech and petitioned the king to fire his superiors or accept his resignation since he could not work with them.  To the surprise of everyone, Jungjong replaced everyone in two offices except Jo. This event reflected Jungjong's complete trust and confidence in Jo, who rose in a series of unprecedented promotions from rank of junior sixth rank to junior second rank in only three years.

===Jo Gwangjo's reforms===
[[File:Jo Gwang-jo 05.jpg|thumb|left|130px|Jo Gwangjo]]
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:jo Gwangjo writing2.jpg|thumb|Jo Gwangjo's handwriting]] --&gt;
King Jungjong wanted to bring new talents to the royal court that was dominated by Hoon-gu faction, and Jo complied by introducing a new system of government recruitment via recommendations that were based on the candidates' moral character as well as scholarship.  He argued that existing officer examination were too philosophical and placed too much emphasis on literary skills, detached from the practical needs of the government. The supplementary examination that Jo introduced was called an "examination for the learned and the virtuous" (''hyeollanggwa''). This was an abbreviated examination for candidates recommended by local magistrates as men of highest integrity in the presence of the king, who chose the winning candidates.  This system allowed Jo to recruit many talented Sarim scholars who had been living secluded life in rural provinces.  However, it also left him open to Hungu faction's attack that Jo formed a clique of his supporters by placing them in key positions.

Jo and his supporters then pushed forth a series of radical reforms as they established local self-government system called [[Hyang'yak]] to strengthen local autonomy and communal spirit among people.  In this system, deference was placed according to senority of villagers rather than their social status. The Sarim faction also sought to reduce gap between the rich and poor with a land reform that would distribute land to farmers equally and limit amount of land and number of slaves that one could own. This measure also targeted Hungu faction's accumulation of land and wealth.&lt;ref&gt;KBS World, January 23, 2010, "Jo Gwangjo, Reformer who dreamt ideal neo-Confucianism"&lt;/ref&gt;

Deeply influenced by [[Zhu Xi]]'s [[neo-Confucianism]], Jo Gwangjo believed that ideal world of mythical Chinese [[Emperor Yao]] and [[Shun (Chinese leader)|Shun]], could be achieved if all people from the king down to low-born became morally refined and followed Confucius' teachings. The Sarim faction therefore promulgated Confucian writings among the populace by translating them in Korean [[hangul]] and distributing them widely.  They also suppressed Buddhism and Taoism as superstitious religions by destroying the royal Taoist temple and confiscating properties of Buddhist temples. 
As Inspector General, he impeached many officials for corruption and bribery.  According to [[Annals of the Joseon Dynasty]], it was said that no official dared to receive a bribe or exploit the populace during this time because of such strict enforcement.&lt;ref&gt;Annals of Joseon Dynasty, October, 1520&lt;/ref&gt;  He also sought to trim the size of government by reducing the number of bureaucrats and their wages. 
 
Jo also believed that any talented people including slaves should be appointed as officials regardless of social status.  He was said to judge people by moral character and did not greet superior officials if he considered them of unworthy characters while he was courteous even to his servants. For instance, he formed a friendship with a butcher/tanner of lowest class ([[baekjeong]]) who did not even have a name and admired his learning so much that he discussed state affairs with him and wanted to appoint him as a court official.  But the tanner repeatedly refused Jo's offer and then disappeared without a trace according to Records of Yeonryeoshil (연려실기술), a collection of official and unofficial history books compiled by Yi Geung-ik in late Joseon Dynasty. (It is said that [[Injong of Joseon|King Injong]], Jungjong's successor who admired his tutor Jo Gwangjo, listed the "tanner" as [[Chief State Councillor]] for his future cabinet for he was greatly admired by Jo.) According to famous Korean philosopher [[Yi I]], Jo was admired so much by populace that when he appeared on streets people gathered before him saying, "Our master is coming." &lt;ref&gt;Annals, September 21, 1562: "When Jo Gwangjo became Inspector General and passed the streets, everyone on street bowed to pay their respects.  The slanderers claimed that he tried to gather popular support with a different purpose."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sarim's Power Base===
[[File:Letter of Cho Kwang-jo.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Letter of Jo Kwang-jo]]
Jo Gwangjo's radical reforms were popular with the populace, who called him the "living Buddha",&lt;ref&gt;Annals, January 19, 1520&lt;/ref&gt; but he faced fierce opposition and hostility from the Hungu faction. In early 1519, several Hungu officials began a plot to assassinate Sarim officials, though they were discovered in time.&lt;ref&gt;Annals, March 2, 1519&lt;/ref&gt;    
Jo's power base was concentrated in four offices: Inspector General's Office (사헌부; whose main function was to impeach corrupt or unprincipled government officials in court and local administration), Office of Censors (사간원; whose role was to criticize wrong policies of the king or ministers), Hongmoongwan (홍문관; an advisory council that answered the king's questions and educated the king with history and Confucian philosophy), and Royal Secretariat (승정원; which served as liaison between the king and ministries).  The first three offices were collectively called [[Three Offices]], or Samsa (삼사), as they provided checks and balance on the power of the king and the ministers and also served as organ of press that influenced general opinion of the court. 
 
However, the Sarim faction did not control any army nor had financial base.  Sarim's power was solely dependent on the king's support, which Jo believed to be steadfast in their mutual pursuit of reforms.  However, Jo's unbending character and his frequent remonstrations to Jungjong to support his radical programs began to irritate the king.  Even when he disagreed with Jo, Jungjong almost always ended up adopting Jo's petition because Jo would refuse to bend his will and Three Offices would threaten to resign en masse.  Furthermore, Jo and Hongmoongwan officials often instructed Jungjong on the ways of king in long lessons.  Because Jungjong was not a crown prince, he had not received a thorough royal education expected of future king, and Sarim scholars sought to rectify this, believing that only learning could prevent a despot like Yeonsangun.  Jungjong began to feel hounded by his subjects and resented it.

The Hungu faction, which sensed Jungjong's irritation with Jo Gwangjo, found an opportunity to strike Sarim faction when Jo Gwangjo decided to go after the "heroes" of the 1506 coup that brought Jungjong to power.  According to Jo, many officials who were awarded with special privileges including tax exemptions and huge stipends did not actually contribute much to the coup but gained their status through bribes or familial connections.  He petitioned Jungjong to revoke such status from two thirds out of 110 people who received special status in connection with the coup.  This move infuriated the Hungu faction, and they soon after proceeded to frame Jo Gwangjo with charges of disloyalty.

==="Cho will become the King"===
At the behest of Hungu leaders including Hong Kyung-ju, Nam Gon, and Shim Jung, Consort Gyeong of Park clan and Consort Hui of Hong clan (Hong Kyung-ju's daughter) sought to estrange Jungjong and Jo Gwangjo by often questioning Jo's loyalty and claiming that popular support was shifting to Jo. They told Jungjong that people were saying that it was actually Jo Gwangjo who ruled the country and that populace wanted to make him their king.  Even if Jo was not disloyal, he would not be able to stop his supporters from doing so, they said.&lt;ref name="Annals, December 21, 1544"&gt;Annals, December 21, 1544&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Annals of Joseon Dynasty]], Nam Gon now set out to slander Jo and wrote a phrase "Ju cho will become the king" (주초위왕, 走肖爲王)" with honey or sugary water on mulberry leaves so that caterpillars left behind such phrase on leaves in the palace.&lt;ref&gt;Annals, September 21, 1568&lt;/ref&gt; When two [[Hanja]] (Chinese) characters "ju"(走) and "cho"(肖) are put together, they form a new Hanja character "jo"(趙), which happen to be Jo Gwangjo's family name. Consort Hong or Consort Park showed the leaf to Jungjong and claimed that this was the heaven's warning that Jo would take the throne himself after eliminating Hungu faction. Jungjong, who himself rose to the throne through a coup d'état, began to distrust Jo Gwangjo.  [It should be noted that when [[Goryeo]] dynasty fell and was replaced by [[Joseon]] dynasty, there was popular saying "Son of wood will gain the country" (목자득국 木子得國). When two Hanja characters meaning wood(木) and son(子) are combined, they form a new character "yi"(李), which happens to be the family name of [[Taejo of Joseon|Yi Seoung-gye]], who deposed the last king of Goryeo and founded Joseon dynasty.  These phrases helped Yi Seoung-gye win popular support for the new dynasty as heaven's will.]

When Jo petitioned Jungjong to revoke special privileges of people who falsely contributed to 1506 coup, Jungjong's suspicion was further heightened. Now feeling certain that Jungjong was sufficiently estranged from Jo, Hong Kyung-ju secretly entered the palace to warn King Jungjong that the court was filled with Jo's supporters and that no one could dare oppose him openly. Jungjong dispatched a secret letter to Hong Kyung-ju, expressing his fear that Jo Gwangjo would next go after Hungu officials who did contribute to the coup by questioning legitimacy of the coup and then turn against the king himself.&lt;ref name="Annals, April 13, 1520"&gt;Annals, April 13, 1520&lt;/ref&gt; Jungjong instructed Hoon-gu leaders to kill Jo Gwangjo and then inform him. On November 15, 1519, Hoon-gu leaders entered the palace secretly at night to bypass Royal Secretariat and present to the king written charges against Jo: he and his supporters "deceived the king and put the state in disorder by forming a clique and abusing their positions to promote their supporters while excluding their opponents, and thereby misleading young people to make extremism into habit, causing the young to despise the old, the low-born to disrespect the high-born." &lt;ref&gt;Annals, November 15, 1519&lt;/ref&gt; Inspector General Jo Gwangjo, Justice Minister Kim Jung, and six others were immediately arrested, and they were about to be killed extrajudicially without trial or even investigation.&lt;ref name="Annals, December 21, 1544"/&gt; The whole event had appearance of coup d'état except that it was sanctioned by the king.

==="What is their crime?"===
They would have been immediately killed except that War Minister Yi Jang-gon, who arrested Sarim officials, entreated that ministers should be consulted for such decision. The cabinet meeting on the following day regarding Jo's fate is described in detail in the [[Annals of the Joseon Dynasty]].  Most officials expressed their shock at Jo Gwangjo's arrest and Jungjong's intention to kill him.&lt;ref&gt;Annals, November 16, 1519, No. 12&lt;/ref&gt;  They entreated that he may have been extreme in his youthful zeal to improve the country but could not possibly have private agenda. [[Yeonguijeong|Chief State Councillor]] Jeong Gwang-pil said in tears: "I have frequently witnessed horrid calamities during the reign of deposed king ([[Yeonsangun]]), but how could I imagine to see such thing again even after meeting the wise king?" &lt;ref name="Annals, April 13, 1520"/&gt; When Jungjong tried to leave, he even grasped the royal cloth to entreat further.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Yi Geung-ik, Records of Yeonryeoshil&lt;/ref&gt;  He "could not understand on what charges the king wanted to punish them" for "mere demotion of 2-3 ranks would be already excessive." &lt;ref name="Annals, November 16, 1519, No.12"&gt;Annals, November 16, 1519, No.12&lt;/ref&gt;  Eighteen younger officials requested to the king to imprison them with Jo Gwangjo.&lt;ref&gt;Annals, November 16, 1519, No.7&lt;/ref&gt;  [[State Council of Joseon|State Council]] and [[Six Ministries of Joseon|Six Ministries]] jointly entreated that punishing Jo and others on such charges without evidence would become a blot on the king's reputation.&lt;ref&gt;Annals, November 16, 1519, No.20&lt;/ref&gt;  Even Hong Sook, who became Justice Minister overnight and interrogated Jo, reported to the king that he was "deeply moved" by Jo's loyalty.&lt;ref name="Annals, November 16, 1519, No.12"/&gt;

New Inspector General Yu Eun, who replaced Jo, protested in even stronger terms: "If Jo Gwangjo is guilty of crime, he should be punished in open and just manner... Instead, Your Majesty is handing out such punishment according to secret words by two people in the middle of night... What is so difficult about punishing few [[seonbi]]s with authority of king that Your Majesty should do so covertly by sending a secret message?... If there is a crime, it should be dealt with clearly and justly, but Your Majesty appeared to trust and be friendly with them on the outside while thinking of eliminating them in mind." &lt;ref&gt;Annals, November 18, 1519&lt;/ref&gt;  He was finally dismissed after asking Jungjong to "cut my head to please the wicked people." &lt;ref&gt;Annals, December 30, 1528&lt;/ref&gt;
Meanwhile, 150 [[Seonggyungwan]] students stormed the palace to protest Jo's arrest and filled the palace with shouts of entreaties,&lt;ref&gt;Annals, November 16, 1519, No.13&lt;/ref&gt;  and later 240 students petitioned to claim Jo's innocence and requested to be imprisoned together.&lt;ref name="Annals, November 17, 1519"&gt;Annals, November 17, 1519&lt;/ref&gt;  There was such popular outpouring for Jo's release that it may have increased Jungjong's suspicion and anger.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;[http://www.ohmynews.com/nws_web/view/at_pg.aspx?CNTN_CD=A0000370918], Reformer Jo Kwang-jo (in Korean)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Third Literati Purge of 1519===
[[File:Cho Kwang-jo in 1750.jpg|left|150px|thumb|Portrait of Jo Gwangjo]]
Jo Gwangjo was completely caught off guard with turn of the event. The Sarim faction had scored its biggest victory just four days ago when Jungjong granted their petition to revoke special status for 70 Hungu officials. He continued to believe that Jungjong was misled by his enemies and was confident that he could persuade the king of his loyalty once he could face him in the interrogation. He wrote to Jungjong of his fear for this incident becoming a bloody purge and entreated that he would not regret dying ten thousand times if only he could be granted an audience.&lt;ref&gt;Annals, November 16, 1915, No.11&lt;/ref&gt; However, he would never have a chance to see Jungjong again. Amid petitions for leniency, Jungjong commuted the death sentence to exile, and Jo Gwangjo was exiled to Neung-ju.

Nevertheless, Jungjong was determined to put Jo Gwangjo to death. In the Annals, there was no official demand for Jo's death, not even by Hong Kyung-joo, Nam Gon, and Shim Jung, except for a petition by three Seunggyungwan students &lt;ref&gt;Annals, December 14, 1519&lt;/ref&gt; (as opposed to 300 who petitioned for his release).&lt;ref&gt;Annals, November 19, 1519, No.2&lt;/ref&gt;  Nam Gon rather urged against executing Jo multiple times even as he was adding more and more names to the list of people to be purged through exile or dismissal.&lt;ref&gt;Annals, December 14, 1519, No.3&lt;/ref&gt;  Yet Jungjong turned against Jo with the same intensity as when he favored him. He reinstated death sentence by poison for Jo less than a month after their exile. He fired many ministers who entreated on Jo's behalf including Chief State Councillor Jeong Gwang-pill, Deputy State Councillor Ahn Dang, and even War Minister Yi Jang-gon, who took part in arresting Sarim officials.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:jo gwang jo exile.jpg|thumb|Cottage where Jo Gwangjo exiled and drank poison]] --&gt;
Jo Gwangjo still could not believe Jungjong's heart really turned against him and hoped to be recalled by the king, keeping a north door open each day during exile.  Even when soldiers arrived with poison, he was suspicious that Hungu leaders might be trying to kill him without Jungjong's approval.  But when he learned that Nam Gon and Shim Jung became Vice State Councillor and Minister of Personnel, he finally realized that Jungjong's change of heart was final.&lt;ref name="Annals, December 16, 1519"&gt;Annals, December 16, 1519&lt;/ref&gt;

Before drinking the poison, Jo wrote [[Jo Gwangjo#Death Poem|a poem declaring his loyalty]], asked his people not to make coffin too heavy, and apologized to the owner and servant of the house for not paying his debt and instead showing them terrible sight and desecrating their house.  He then bowed four times toward the north in the direction of palace.&lt;ref name="Annals, December 16, 1519"/&gt;  (It was customary to pay respect to the king in gratitude for granting poison, which was not an official method of execution and was considered more honorable form of death, instead of beheading or hanging.)  When he drank poison, he did not die immediately and soldiers tried to strangle him.  Jo rebuked them saying that the king intended to spare his neck by sending the poison and requested for another bowl of poison.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; He died at the age of 37.  Later when there was a severe drought in the country, the populace blamed that it was heaven's punishment for killing an innocent [[seonbi]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://weekly.donga.com/docs/magazine/weekly/2009/12/10/200912100500021/200912100500021_1.html] Weekly Donga, "Dream of reform cut by the conspiracy" December 15, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Many of remaining Sarim scholars left the central government in protest and retreated to rural provinces. Most of Jo's reforms were revoked with his fall.

The Third Literati Purge of 1519 (기묘사화 己卯士禍) was widely viewed as a missed opportunity to reform Joseon Dynasty by later generations because Joseon politics soon degenerated into power struggle among in-laws and relatives of the royal family. A year after the purge, a histographer wrote that bribery and corruption became widespread in the court and local administrations.&lt;ref&gt;Annals. November 16, 1520&lt;/ref&gt; Later, purge victims were venerated as "Wise Men of Gimyo" (Gimyo is the Korean calendar name for year 1519) while three main instigators (Hong Kyung-ju, Nam Gon, and Shim Jung) were collectively called "Evil Three of Gimyo".

Hong Kyung-ju died two years later of natural causes, but Shim Jung and Consort Kyung of Park clan were later executed on a framed charge of cursing the crown prince in a plot concocted by their rival Kim Anro (Kim Anro was killed by rival Yoon Won-hyung, who in turn was purged by King Myeongjong - Shim, Kim, and Yoon are all considered some of the most corrupt officials in Joseon dynasty).  Nam Gon, who was reportedly deeply saddened at Jo's death,&lt;ref name="Annals, December 16, 1519"/&gt; regretted his role in the purge and willed that all his writings be burnt, saying that he "deceived the world with vain name," so no writing of his remains except for one short poem although he was one of the most famous writers of his time. Nam Gon, initially of Sarim faction as a disciple of Kim Jong-jik, was a moderate supporter of reforms and supposedly sought Jo Gwangjo's friendship but was rebuffed by Jo and his supporters as a petty Hungu official.&lt;ref&gt;Originally consulted from this page in Korean http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LPOD&amp;mid=etc&amp;oid=036&amp;aid=0000009053&lt;/ref&gt; 
   
Ten years after the purge, King Jungjong again began to advance Sarim scholars by recalling them from exile and reappointing them to the royal court.  Nevertheless, Jungjong did not rehabilitate Jo Gwangjo's name to the end despite endless petitions, saying at one time that what happened in 1519 was "neither right nor wrong." &lt;ref&gt;Annals, April 7, 1544&lt;/ref&gt; 
(There is speculation as to what Jungjong really believed about the leaf incident since Jungjong never accused Jo of disloyalty or anything but pure intentions after first few days of Jo's arrest. From very early on, Jungjong's official position has been that Jo intended well but caused a situation that could only be rectified with a purge.&lt;ref name="Annals, November 17, 1519"/&gt;)  Jo Gwangjo was finally rehabilitated by his son [[Injong of Joseon]], and was posthumously honored as a chief state councillor by [[Seonjo of Joseon]] in 1568.

===Legacy===

Jo Gwangjo was greatly venerated by later generations of Korean neo-Confucianists as their spiritual head, but was also criticized for mistakes that led to the failure of his reforms.  [[Yi Hwang]] and [[Yi I]], often considered Joseon's two greatest Confucian philosophers, lamented that he entered politics too early before his scholarship was completed and pursued his reforms too rapidly.  Nevertheless, Yi Hwang praised him as one of "Four Wise of the East" along with Kim Gwoeng-pil, Jeong Yeo-chang, and [[Yi Eonjeok]] and said that Jo showed the direction for all [[seonbi]]s to aim and follow and unveiled the foundation of governing a country.  Jo Gwangjo's emphasis on neo-Confucian ethics as practical philosophy has been very influential as the previous focus has been on more literary aspects of Confucianism.  It was also during his time that Confucianism finally took roots deeply among the common populace.  Even though Confucianism was the official state religion since the founding of [[Joseon Dynasty]], Confucian practices were largely limited to aristocratic class. His dream of making neo-Confucianism the predominant philosophy of Joseon was soon accomplished by the reign of Seonjo, fifty years after his death. He was canonized and enshrined in the [[Seonggyungwan]] in 1610, one of only eighteen Korean Confucian scholars so honored by the Joseon Dynasty.  However, Sarim faction that venerated Jo Gwangjo's name did not attempt to carry out his reforms when they seized political power during Seonjo's reign and all the while they maintained power until the end of Joseon dynasty.  Some people blame Jo Gwangjo for dogmatism of Korean Neo-Confucianism, which became very conservative and caused Korea to resist changes and new learnings from abroad.

Today his name remains a byword for reform in Korea, and his example is often raised when there is a controversy about a reform.

==Modern portrayal==
[[File:Huam Baik In-geol.jpg|thumb|right|200px|his disciple and successor [[Baik In-geol]]]]
Jo Gwangjo was the protagonist of 1996 KBS TV series ''Jo Gwangjo'' and was a prominent character in 2001 SBS TV series ''Ladies of the Palace''.  In MBC TV series ''[[Dae Jang Geum]]'' (2003-4), he does not appear as a character, but his name is mentioned frequently as the political foe of fictitious villain Right Minister Oh.  Main protagonist Jang Geum and Lady Han are falsely accused of being in conspiracy with Jo Gwangjo while male protagonist Min Jung-ho is portrayed as his supporter (Min Jung-ho found a doctor for him and is shown recruiting his followers to return to politics).  In the musical version of ''Dae Jang Geum'', Jo Gwangjo is a prominent character as a friend of Min Jung-ho.  In KBS TV series ''[[Immortal Admiral Yi Sun-sin]]'' (2004-5), [[Yi Sun-shin]]'s grandfather is described to have been executed for supporting Jo Gwangjo and Yi's father is arrested while holding a memorial rite at Jo's abandoned house.  In 2006 KBS series ''[[Hwang Jini (TV series)|Hwang Jini]]'', the male protagonist Kim Jeong-han is portrayed as Jo Gwangjo's disciple while another character Lee Saeng become Hwang Jini's bodyguard after he leaves his father's home in disgust because his father is Jo Gwango-jo's friend but betrays him to become prime minister.  In these dramas (Dae Jang Geum, Yi Sun-shin, and Hwang Jini), Jo Gwangjo does not appear as a character but serves as a plot device to set the main characters as righteous people by association.

'''John Micallef''' (1923–2003) was a Maltese [[philosopher]]. Although his thoughts remained philosophically grounded in the Christian tradition, he was primarily interested in [[Existentialism]].&lt;ref&gt;Mark Montebello, ''Il-Ktieb tal-Filosofija f’Malta'' (''A Source Book of Philosophy in Malta''), PIN Publications, Malta, 2001, Vol. II, pp. 35-36; Mark Montebello, ''Malta’s Philosophy &amp; Philosophers'', PIN Publications, Malta, 2011, pp. 118-201.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Micallef was born in [[Victoria, Gozo]], one of Malta's subsidiary islands, in 1923. After completing his studies at the Lyceum in [[Malta]], he continued studying at the [[Gregorian University]] of [[Rome]]. From Gregorian, he acquired a [[Master's degree|Masters]] in Philosophy. He also studied philosophy at [[Heythop College]] in [[London]], England. From the [[University of London]] he acquired a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in [[Italian Language]], and another [[Master’s degree]] in [[Linguistics]]. He completed "3rd cycle" studies at [[Laval University]] in Quebec City, receiving a Doctorate in Philosophy. From the [[Colorado Mesa University|University of Western Colorado]] in the [[United States of America]] he acquired, in 1973, a second [[Doctorate]] in Arts. In 1980, he also acquired a [[Master's degree|Masters]] in Christian Studies from [[Regent College]] of [[Vancouver]], British Columbia, Canada. In addition to his prior studies, he pursued further coursework at the University of [[Oña]], in Spain, and at the University of Innsbruck, in Austria.

During the fifties, Dr.John Micallef was a teacher of languages. He was elected and he served for some time as Member of the Malta Legislative Assembly before he  emigrated from Malta to Canada in 1964. He eventually settled in [[Nelson, British Columbia]], and then in [[Oregon]], United States. In [[Nelson, British Columbia|Nelson]], he was Associate Professor of Philosophy at [[Notre Dame University of Nelson]]. He was also Associate Professor of Philosophy at the [[University of Portland]], and at [[Mount Angel, Oregon|Mount Angel College]], both in [[Oregon]]. Micallef died in 2003 in Vancouver, BC Canada.

==Work==
'''''Philosophy of Existence''''',&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', Vol. I, p. 155&lt;/ref&gt; was published in 1969 (Philosophical Library, New York, U.S.A.). As its title indicates, in this 225-page composition, Micallef reveals his thorough [[Existentialist]] perspective. The book is basically divided into four parts, each one sub-divided into chapters.

The composition is a highly elaborate philosophical exercise into the nature of existence. Successively, Micallef deals with the affirmation of existence, the process of existence, the properties of existence, and the dialectics of existence.

Unfortunately, since the book was issued abroad, it has been seldom read in Malta. Consequently, its influence on the Maltese philosophical tradition has been relatively slight.

Additional publications by John Micallef are: "No Destination- A Travellers Way" - a collection of poems and "Joy is my Gift"  a collection of poems.

Dr. Micallef was a prolific writer who produced numerous finished manuscripts and plays most of which remain unpublished to date.

'''Keidō Fukushima''' (福島 慶道, [[Rōmaji]]: Fukushima Keidō, March 1, 1933 – March 1, 2011) was a [[Japanese Zen|Japanese]] [[Rinzai]] [[Zen master]], head abbot of [[Tofuku-ji|Tōfuku-ji]] (one of the main branches of the Rinzai sect), centered in [[Kyoto]], [[Japan]]. Because of openness to teaching [[Western Buddhism|Western]] students, he had considerable influence on the development of Rinzai Zen practice in the West.

==Biography==

===Zen studies===
[[File:Shibayama-Fukushima.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Keidō Fukushima with his teacher Zenkei Shibayama in the USA, 1969.]]
Fukushima became an [[Zen ranks and hierarchy|acolyte monk]] at the age of thirteen under his original teacher Kidō Okada, abbot of Hōfuku-ji monastery in Okayama, Japan.{{sfn|Harris|2004|p=6-9}} Fukushima graduated from Otani University’s Department of Buddhist Studies in 1956, following completion of Otani’s doctoral course. In 1961 he began monastic training with [[Zenkei Shibayama]] at [[Nanzen-ji]] Monastery in Kyoto.{{sfn|Harris|2004|p=14}} Fukushima’s main teacher, Zenkei Shibayama, was instrumental in helping to transplant Rinzai Zen to the West. He was one of the first Rinzai Zen masters to hold retreats in the United States, and to publish books in English: ''A Flower Does Not Talk'', ''Ox-herding Pictures'', and ''Zen Comments on the Mumonkan / Gateless Barrier''. Shibayama made annual visits to the United States in the late 1960s. In 1969 he was accompanied by Fukushima (at that time senior monk at Nanzen-ji and known as Genshō). In 1973 Fukushima received a fellowship to study English at the Claremont Colleges where he conducted seminars on Zen and led ''[[zazen]]'' practice.{{sfn|Harris|2004|p=19}}

===Zen master===
Acknowledged as a Zen master in 1974, Fukushima was appointed vice-resident abbot of Hōfuku-ji where he began to train his own disciples. In 1980, he was appointed master of the Tōfuku-ji training monastery (''senmon dōjō'' 専門道場) in Kyoto.{{sfn|Harris|2004|p=21}} He was elected head abbot (''kanchō'' 管長) of Tōfuku-ji in 1991, supervising 363 affiliated temples.

After being named Zen master and given the name Keidō, Fukushima strove to carry out his teacher Shibayama’s intention to introduce Rinzai Zen to the West.{{sfn|Harris|2004|p=24}} He accepted Western students as monks, both at Hōfuku-ji and Tōfuku-ji. Counter to tradition, he let women participate in monastic ''[[sesshin]]''-retreats. He conducted annual speaking tours at American universities including Pomona College, Millsaps College, Hendrix College, Bard College, Columbia University, Xavier University in Cincinnati, Harvard University, the University of Pennsylvania, the University of Kansas, the University of Richmond, Middlebury College and the University of Vermont. From 1991 onwards, these tours included some ''sesshin''-retreats. After decades of contact with American Zen, Fukushima gradually revised his views on it. In October 2007 he wrote: 
{{quote|While American Zen has certainly learned a great deal from Japanese Zen, I think it is now time for American Zen to stand on its own two feet. In contrast with the 'monastic Zen' of Japan, American Zen is essentially a 'lay Zen.'{{sfn|Fukushima|2009|p=xvii}}}}

Fukushima also worked to raise awareness and funds to revive and reconstruct several of China's important historical monasteries, thereby aiding [[Chan Buddhism|Chán]]'s emergence from the Cultural Revolution's devastating effects.{{sfn|Harris|2004|p=107}} Jōshū's monastery at Zhao Zhou, now known as Bailin, was the first of these efforts to achieve official government support. On later trips, Fukushima and other priests provided assistance for the rebuilding of Manjuji (萬寿寺) on Mt. Kinzan (径山), of particular importance to the Tōfuku-ji tradition since the founder Enni Ben’en (also known as Shōichi Kokushi) trained there between 1235 and 1241.

===Calligraphy===
[[File:Fukushima calligraphy (Kusoudo).jpg|thumb|right|upright|Calligraphy by Fukushima.]]
Well known for his calligraphy,{{sfn|Harris|2004|p=10}} Fukushima was an authority on reading classical Chinese and Kanbun (a hybrid Chinese/Japanese script). Although many Buddhist priests produce religiously inspired art, they rarely create their works in front of an audience. Fukushima realized the very act of doing calligraphy could exert educational and inspirational influence upon those who witnessed it. In keeping with Japanese conventions, he did not give calligraphy demonstrations for Japanese audiences, but he did incorporate such events among his overseas teaching activities.

===Death===
Around 2000, Fukushima began showing symptoms of the onset of Parkinson’s disease, and his health steadily declined. He died on his seventy-eighth birthday (March 1) in 2011.

==Teachings, students and Dharma Heirs==
{{See also|Koan|Dharma transmission#Rinzai|l1=Dharma transmission in Rinzai}}

Throughout his teaching career, Fukushima was clear about what is required to train others using ''[[koan|kōan]]''. Guiding others in this training can be done by those who have finished the entire ''kōan'' curriculum through rigorous training over many years, then matured further on their own. One can only guide someone else in ''kōan'' study when one has gone all the way through it oneself and resolved the One Great Matter.{{sfn|Harris|2004|p=103-104}}

Fukushima authorized one Japanese Dharma heir, Yūdō Harada (also known as Ji'en; current training master at Tōfuku-ji Monastery),'&lt;ref name="SZ-Fukushima death"&gt;[http://sweepingzen.com/keido-fukushima-retired-abbot-of-tofukuji-dead-at-age-78/ SweepingZen, ''Keido Fukushima, retired Abbot of Tofukuji, dead at age 78'']&lt;/ref&gt; and one lay successor, Jeff Shore (Fukushima’s lay disciple since 1982).&lt;ref name="JS=Being"&gt;[http://beingwithoutself.org/jeff/ Jeff Shore, ''being without self'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Fukushima was strict about preserving the traditional practices of Rinzai Zen, he was open to accepting those of other faiths and traditions as his disciples. Among these were Phra Thana Kaokham (a Thai monk of the [[Thai Forest Tradition]]), [[Muho Noelke]] (current abbot of the [[Sōtō]] Zen temple [[Antai-ji]] in Hyōgo, Japan), and Justin Lanier (American Anglican priest). Fukushima permitted Westerners to live in the monastery and train under him at both Hōfuku-ji and Tōfuku-ji. Senior disciples who have done sustained training under Fukushima include Alex Taikei Vesey, Hap Tivey, Tayo Gabler, James Green, Tim Armacost, Ron Sinnige, Alex Buijs, and Sally Stein.

{{nihongo|'''Kokutai-ji'''|国泰寺||"Temple of National Peace"}}, originally {{nihongo|'''Tosho-ji'''|東松寺||}}, is one of fourteen autonomous branches of the [[Rinzai]] school of [[Japan]]ese [[Zen]], founded in 1300 by the monk [[Jiun Myoi]] in [[Toyama, Japan]]. In 1327 [[Emperor Go-Daigo]] gave the temple the name Kokutai-ji, and Jiun Myoi became Seisen Zenji.&lt;ref&gt;Head Temples&lt;/ref&gt;

Kokutai-ji was once also a temple of the [[Fuke Zen|Fuke sect]] (as many Rinzai monasteries in Japan once were), and housed [[komusō]]. Rinzai monks and priests still dress and practice ''[[suizen]]'' as komusō during memorial ceremonies in remembrance of Jiun Myoi.

'''Konrad Ekhof''' (12 August 1720 in [[Hamburg]], [[Germany]] – 16 June 1778) was a German [[actor]], widely regarded as one of the foremost actors of the German-speaking realm in the 18th century.

==Life==
In 1739, he became a member of [[Johann Friedrich Schönemann]]'s (1704–1782) company in [[Lüneburg]], and made his first appearance there on 15 January 1740 as Xiphares in [[Jean Racine|Racine]]'s ''[[Mithridate (Racine)|Mithridate]]''. 
From 1751, the Schönemann company performed mainly in Hamburg and at [[Schwerin]], where [[Christian Ludwig II]] of [[Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin|Mecklenburg-Schwerin]] made them comedians to the court.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

During this period Ekhof founded a theatrical academy, which, though short-lived, was of great importance in helping to raise the standard of German acting and the status of German actors. In 1757, Ekhof left Schönemann to join [[Franz Schuch]]'s company in [[Gdańsk|Danzig]], but he soon returned to Hamburg, where, in conjunction with two other actors, he succeeded Schönemann in the direction of the company. 
He resigned this position, however, in favor of [[H. G. Koch]], with whom he acted until 1764, when he joined [[Konrad Ernst Ackermann|K. E. Ackermann]]'s company. In 1767, the Hamburg National Theatre or the [[Hamburgische Entreprise]] was founded, backed by [[Abel Seyler]] and a group of merchants, and was made famous by [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|Lessing]]'s ''[[Hamburgische Dramaturgie]]''. Ekhof was the leading member of the company. After the failure of the enterprise Ekhof was persuaded to join its successor, the travelling [[Seyler Theatre Company]], and performed at the court in Weimar with the Seyler company for some time. He ultimately became co-director of the new court theatre at [[Gotha (town)|Gotha]]. This, the first permanently established theatre in Germany, was opened on 2 October 1775. Ekhof's reputation was now at its height; [[Goethe]] called him the only German tragic actor; and in 1777 he acted with Goethe and [[Duke Charles Augustus]] at a private performance at [[Weimar]], dining afterward with the poet at the ducal table.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

His versatility may be judged from the fact that in the comedies of [[Carlo Goldoni|Goldoni]] and [[Molière]] he was no less successful than in the tragedies of Lessing and [[Shakespeare]]. He was regarded by his contemporaries as an unsurpassed exponent of naturalness on the stage; and in this respect he has been not unfairly compared with Garrick. His fame, however, was rapidly eclipsed by that of [[Friedrich U. Schröder]]. His literary efforts were chiefly confined to translations from French authors.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

{{Conservatism sidebar |People}}

'''Konstantin Nikolayevich Leontiev''' ({{lang-ru|Константи́н Никола́евич Лео́нтьев}}; January 25, 1831 in Kudinovo, [[Kaluga Governorate]] – November 24, 1891 in [[Sergiyev Posad]]) was a [[traditionalist conservatism|conservative]] [[tsarism|tsarist]] and [[imperialism|imperial]] [[monarchist]] Russian philosopher who advocated closer cultural ties between [[Russia]] and the East against what he believed to be the West's catastrophic [[egalitarian]], [[utilitarian]] and revolutionary influences. He also advocated Russia's cultural and territorial expansion eastward to [[India]], [[Tibet]] and [[China]].

== Life ==
Leontiev was born and grew up on his father's estate. His father, a nobleman, was a military officer but was discharged for "riotous behaviour". Still, the intervention of the Russian empress in behalf of the Leontiev brothers made him able to enter the Imperial [[Corps of Pages]]. He was engaged at 23 but broke off the relationship for the sake of "freedom and art"" a decision that made things difficult for him. After completing medical school in [[Moscow]], Leontiev saw service as a doctor during the [[Crimean War]].

In 1861, he carried off a local Crimean girl, the daughter of a Greek merchant, from [[Feodosiya]], eventually marrying her.

He later lived in various Ottoman towns as a Russian consular agent, devoting his leisure time to writing oriental fiction on many themes, some of which included a condemnation of [[homophobia]] and implied that he may have been bisexual.&lt;ref name=glbtq&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.glbtq.com/literature/russ_lit,5.html |title=Russian Literature |work=[[glbtq.com]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060904100553/http://www.glbtq.com/literature/russ_lit%2C5.html |archivedate=2006-09-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Rzhevsky. (1983). ''Russian literature and ideology: Herzen, Dostoevsky, Leontiev, Tolstoy, Fadeyev''. Champaign, Illinois: University of Illinois Press&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer of 1871, after praying to the [[Theotokos|Virgin Mary]], he was cured of [[cholera]] and [[dysentery]] and promised Her to take monastic vows. Later that fall, he moved to the [[Rossikon|Russian monastery]] on [[Mount Athos]]. In 1880, he moved to the censorship department in [[Moscow]], where he published several acclaimed analyses of [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s novels.

Seven years later, he secretly took the tonsure at the [[Optina monastery]], famous for its [[startsy]]. He died as a monk in the [[Troitse-Sergiyeva Lavra]].

== Works and political thought ==

Leontiev's most remarkable book is a volume of [[essay]]s, ''The East, Russia, and Slavdom'' (1885–1886). Like [[Nikolay Danilevsky]] and [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]] before him, he was ill at ease with the Western [[consumer society]] and the cult of material prosperity. Leontiev regarded traditional Russian [[Byzantinism]] as a blessing and a strong antidote against further [[liberalisation]] of the country's society. His aesthetic and political theories had some similarities to those of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] and [[Oswald Spengler]]. Preceding the latter's theory of the [[social cycle|cyclical nature of civilizations]] and ''[[The Decline of the West]]'' by several decades, Leontiev proposed that all societies undergo a state of flowering and increasing complexity followed by one of "secondary simplification", decay and, ultimately, death. Leontiev felt that the West had reached the beginning of secondary simplification.

A pessimist, Leontiev made several predictions that turned out to come true. He prophesied that in the 20th century, there would be a bloody revolution in Russia led by an "[[anti-Christ]]" that would be socialist and tyrannical in nature and whose rulers would wield even more power than their tsarist predecessors. He said, "[[Socialism]] is the [[feudalism]] of the future".&lt;ref name="Conquest"&gt;[[Robert Conquest]], ''[[The Harvest of Sorrow]]: Soviet Collectivization and the Terror-Famine'', [[Oxford University Press]] New York (1986) {{ISBN|0-19-504054-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; He felt that only the harshest reaction could prevent that scenario.

He also predicted that [[Germany]] would grow strong enough to make up to two wars against Russia and that [[China]] also would eventually threaten Russia's power. He also claimed that technology would one day lead to universal destruction.

He presented himself as a representative of the "Western [[Baul]]" tradition.

==Biography==
Lee Lozowick was born on November 18, 1943, to Ukrainian-American artist [[Louis Lozowick]] and Adele Turner, who had married in 1933 and lived in [[South Orange]], New Jersey.&lt;ref&gt;

===Interest in spiritualism===

Lozowick became a student of [[Silva Mind Control]] in 1970 and became interested in the [[human potential movement]] around the same time.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; He had an awakening experience in 1975. During this period he operated a small center in Mount Tabor, New Jersey where Silva Mind Control was taught, along with occasional guest lectures and acoustic guitar lessons for younger attendees. In his early phase "some people accused Lee of plagiarizing the work of [[Da Free John]]. Lee reports that his speaking style and writing were the articulation of his own experience and denies the charge."&lt;ref&gt;"Embodied Knowledge and Divinity: The Hohm Community as Western-style Bauls" by Helen Crovetto. ''Nova Religio: The Journal of Alternative and Emergent Religions'', Volume 10, Issue 1, pg 73, ISSN 1092-6690&lt;sup&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/55064544/Embodied-Knowledge-and-Divinity-The-Hohm-Community-as-Western-Style-Bauls]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; With several of his students, he made a pilgrimage to India in 1977, where he met Yogi Ramsuratkumar.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; Lozowick became a disciple of [[Yogi Ramsuratkumar]], and attributed his earlier awakening, or what he refers to as a "shift in context," retroactively to Yogi Ramsuratkumar, although he did not feel much connection to Yogi Ramsuratkumar until the 1980s.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;"Enlightenment's Divine Jester: Mr. Lee Lozowick - Rock 'n' Roll, Crazy Wisdom, and Slavery to the Divine. Interview by Hal Blacker ''EnlightenNext'' Issue 8, Summer 1995 (reprinted in Issue 20, Fall/Winter 2001){{cite web |url=http://www.enlightennext.org/magazine/j20/lee.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130414184257/http://www.enlightennext.org/magazine/j20/lee.asp |archivedate=2013-04-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lee subsequently became known to many people the world over as the "Heart-Son" of Yogi Ramsuratkumar after he wrote several volumes of devotional poetry containing over a thousand poems dedicated to his spiritual master.&lt;ref&gt;“The Unknown Traveler with his Magic Mirror appears as the Beggar King and his True Heart-Son:
  Metaphors, Literary Images, and Leitmotifs of Contemporary Hindu Tantric Poetry” by Helen Crovetto. Society for
  Tantric Studies. Flagstaff, Arizona. September 26, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hohm community===

Lozowick then formed a spiritual community called Hohm in New Jersey and began to gather disciples.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; In 1980, he moved the community to Arizona, where it comprised a "Hohm Sahaj Mandir" (Hohm Innate Divinity Temple) and the "Hohm Community."&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; Lozowick founded three ashrams: Triveni Ashram in Arizona, USA; the Ramji Association's Ashram at Ferme de Jutreau in France, and the Triveni II Ashram in Tiruvannamalai, India. The Community also established Hohm Press, which has published a number of books on topics such as natural health, Eastern religion, poetry, and parenting, including those written by Lozowick.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; According to scholar Helen Crovetto,  who has studied the community, "Lee said the word 'Hohm' has no translation and chose not to elaborate on its significance."&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;

Lozowick came to identify with the Baul tradition of Bengal, speculating that Yogi Ramsuratkumar may have had some connection to that community as well during years of his early life that he no longer remembered or refused to disclose, although Ramsuratkumar was not a Baul by lineage.&lt;ref&gt;"Embodied Knowledge and Divinity: The Hohm Community as Western-style Bauls" by Helen Crovetto. ''Nova Religio: The Journal of Alternative and Emergent Religions'', Volume 10, Issue 1, 2006. pg 75, ISSN 1092-6690&lt;sup&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/55064544/Embodied-Knowledge-and-Divinity-The-Hohm-Community-as-Western-Style-Bauls]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, however, the Hohm community did establish relationships with a number of Bengali Bauls, such as Sanatan Das and [[Purna Das Baul Samrat|Purna Das]].&lt;ref&gt;"Embodied Knowledge and Divinity: The Hohm Community as Western-style Bauls" by Helen Crovetto. ''Nova Religio: The Journal of Alternative and Emergent Religions'', Volume 10, Issue 1, 2006. pgs 75-6, ISSN 1092-6690&lt;sup&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/55064544/Embodied-Knowledge-and-Divinity-The-Hohm-Community-as-Western-Style-Bauls]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The focus of spiritual practice in Lozowick's teaching is guru yoga,&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; and some have considered him a proponent of "crazy wisdom." (See George Feuerstein, Divine Madness). He was an ardent admirer of [[Chogyam Trungpa]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; Lozowick was known to discourage potential students in his public lectures with the "sexual content of much of" his talk, or by "loud obnoxiousness."&lt;ref name="scribd.com"&gt;"Embodied Knowledge and Divinity: The Hohm Community as Western-style Bauls" by Helen Crovetto. ''Nova Religio: The Journal of Alternative and Emergent Religions'', Volume 10, Issue 1, 2006. pg 87, ISSN 1092-6690&lt;sup&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/55064544/Embodied-Knowledge-and-Divinity-The-Hohm-Community-as-Western-Style-Bauls]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; "His public demeanor seems to be a technique for scaring away those who are only superficially interested in the spiritual path."&lt;ref name="scribd.com"/&gt;

The Hohm community also incorporates elements of the work of [[George I. Gurdjieff]] into their philosophy, particularly "in the Western Bauls' speculations about the existence of soul and especially in their adoption of his chakra (energy center) system."&lt;ref&gt;"Embodied Knowledge and Divinity: The Hohm Community as Western-style Bauls" by Helen Crovetto. ''Nova Religio: The Journal of Alternative and Emergent Religions'', Volume 10, Issue 1, 2006. pg 78, ISSN 1092-6690&lt;sup&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/55064544/Embodied-Knowledge-and-Divinity-The-Hohm-Community-as-Western-Style-Bauls]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2006, total membership in the Hohm community was "not much more than a hundred," in part due to the desire of Lozowick to keep the number of disciples down to a number where he could remain on a first name basis with all of them.&lt;ref name="Divinity 2006. pg 88"&gt;"Embodied Knowledge and Divinity: The Hohm Community as Western-style Bauls" by Helen Crovetto. ''Nova Religio: The Journal of Alternative and Emergent Religions'', Volume 10, Issue 1, 2006. pg 88, ISSN 1092-6690&lt;sup&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/55064544/Embodied-Knowledge-and-Divinity-The-Hohm-Community-as-Western-Style-Bauls]&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Hohm community members incorporate music into their spiritual practice, and a few are in blues and rock bands, first started by Lozowick, principally (at present) Shri,&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; and The Denise Allen Band.

During the last twenty years of his life, Lozowick had an enduring friendship and collaboration with the late spiritual teacher, [[Arnaud Desjardins]], as well as with [[Robert Svoboda]], and [[Llewellyn Vaughan-Lee]].

Lee Lozowick died of cancer on November 16, 2010, in [[Prescott, Arizona]], after a long illness.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; His work is carried on by his disciples, including Purna Steinitz, who has his own "Trimurti Community" begun in 1998 in [[Bozeman]], Montana,&lt;ref name="Divinity 2006. pg 88"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Purna Steinitz, Teacher biography, "Guest Workshop: Purna Steinitz &amp; Acharya Fleet Maull - A Life That Works – Reaping the Benefits of Spiritual Practice."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18414">'''Moral reasoning,''' also known as moral development, is a study in [[psychology]] that overlaps with [[moral philosophy]]. Children can make moral decisions about what is right and wrong from a young age; this makes morality fundamental to the human condition. Moral reasoning, however, is a part of morality that occurs both within and between individuals. &lt;ref&gt;Raine, A. &amp; Yang, Y. (2006). Neural foundations of moral reasoning and antisocial behavior. Social Cognitive and Affective Neuroscience 1(3), 203-213. doi:10.1093/scan/nsl033 &lt;/ref&gt; Prominent contributors to this theory include [[Lawrence Kohlberg]] and [[Elliot Turiel]].  The term is sometimes used in a different sense: reasoning under conditions of uncertainty, such as those commonly obtained in a [[court of law]].  It is this sense that gave rise to the phrase, "To a moral certainty;"&lt;ref&gt;Victor v. Nebraska (92-8894), 511 U.S. 1(1994), from the syllabus, holding (c) and throughout, available in the [https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/92-8894.ZS.html Cornell Law School Supreme Court Collection]&lt;/ref&gt; however, this idea is now seldom used outside of charges to juries.

Moral reasoning can be defined as being the process in which individuals try to determine the difference between what is right and what is wrong by using logic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition of: Moral Reasoning|url=http://www.alleydog.com/glossary/definition.php?term=Moral%20Reasoning|accessdate=21 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is an important and often daily process that people use when trying to do the right thing.  For instance, every day people are faced with the dilemma of whether to lie in a given situation or not.  People make this decision by reasoning the morality of their potential actions, and through weighing their actions against potential consequences.

A moral choice can be a personal, economic, or ethical one; as described by some [[ethical code,]] or regulated by [[ethical relationship]]s with others. This branch of psychology is concerned with how these issues are perceived by ordinary people, and so is the foundation of descriptive ethics. There are many different forms of moral reasoning which often are dictated by culture. Cultural differences in the high-levels of cognitive function associated with moral reasoning can be observed through the association of brain networks from various cultures and their moral decision making. These cultural differences demonstrate the neural basis that cultural influences can have on an individual’s moral reasoning and decision making &lt;ref&gt;Sachdeva, S., Singh, P., &amp; Medin, D. (2011). Culture and the quest for universal principals in moral reasoning. International Journal of Psychology, 46(3), 161-176. doi:10.1080/00207594.2011.568486&lt;/ref&gt;. 

In 1983, James Rest developed the four component Model of Morality, which addresses the ways that moral motivation and behavior occurs &lt;ref&gt;Lincoln, S. H. &amp; Holmes, E. K. (2011). Ethical decision making: a process influenced by moral intensity. Journal of Healthcare, Science and the Humanities, 1(1), 55-69. doi:10.1111/j.1559-2011.tb02661.x&lt;/ref&gt;. The first of these is moral sensitivity, which is "the ability to see an ethical dilemma, including how our actions will affect others".&lt;ref name="Rest"&gt;Lynn E. Swaner, "Ethical and Moral Reasoning," Educating for Personal and Social Responsibility, Position Paper, American Council of Colleges and Universities, September 13, 2004 (pdf), citing [[James Rest]], "Morality," in ''Cognitive Development'', ed. John H. Flavell and Ellen M. Markman, ''Handbook of Child Psychology'' volume 3, 4th ed. New York: Wiley, 1983, {{ISBN|978-0-471-09064-9}}, pp. 556&amp;#x2013;629.&lt;/ref&gt; The second is moral judgment, which is "the ability to reason correctly about what 'ought' to be done in a specific situation".&lt;ref name=Rest/&gt;  The third is moral motivation, which is "a personal commitment to moral action, accepting responsibility for the outcome".&lt;ref name=Rest/&gt; The fourth and final component of moral behavior is moral character, which is a "courageous persistence in spite of fatigue or temptations to take the easy way out".&lt;ref name=Rest/&gt;

Distinctions between theories of moral reasoning can be accounted for by evaluating inferences (which tend to be either deductive or inductive)based on a given set of premises.&lt;ref name=SJDM/&gt; Deductive inference reaches a conclusion that is true based on whether a given set of premises preceding the conclusion are also true, whereas, inductive inference goes beyond information given in a set of premises to base the conclusion on provoked reflection.&lt;ref name=SJDM/&gt;

This branch of psychology is concerned with how these issues are perceived by ordinary people, and so is the foundation of [[descriptive ethics]]. There are many different moral reasonings. Moral reasoning is culturally defined, and thus is difficult to apply; yet [[human relationships]] define our existence and thus defy cultural boundaries.

==Lawrence Kohlberg==
{{main|Lawrence Kohlberg's stages of moral development}}
[[Lawrence Kohlberg]] is a psychologist who has made significant contributions to the field of moral reasoning by creating a theory of moral development.&lt;ref name=aboutKohlberg&gt;{{cite web|last=Cherry|first=Kendra|title=Kohlberg's Theory of Moral Development|url=http://psychology.about.com/od/developmentalpsychology/a/kohlberg.htm|work=about.com psychology|accessdate=20 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; His theory is a "widely accepted theory that provides the basis for empirical evidence on the influence of human decision making on ethical behavior."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Some Cross-Cultural Evidence on Ethical Reasoning | journal = Journal of Business Ethics | date = May 2001 | first = Judy | last = Tsui |author2=Carolyn Windsor | volume = 31 | issue = 2 | pages = 143–150 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In Lawrence Kohlberg's view, moral development consists of the growth of less egocentric and more impartial modes of reasoning on more complicated matters. He believed that the objective of moral education is the reinforcement of children to grow from one stage to an upper stage. Dilemma was a critical tool that he emphasized that children should be presented with; yet also, the knowledge for children to cooperate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Musschenga|first=Albert W.|title=Moral Intuitions, Moral Expertise and  Moral Reasoning|journal=Journal of Philosophy of Education|year=2009|volume=43|issue=4|pages=597–613|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9752.2009.00707.x|url=https://www.academia.edu/206236/Moral_intuitions_moral_expertise_and_moral_reasoning|accessdate=19 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to his theory, people pass through three main stages of moral development as they grow from early childhood to adulthood. These are preconventional morality, conventional morality, and postconventional morality.&lt;ref name=aboutKohlberg/&gt; Each of these is subdivided into two levels.&lt;ref name=aboutKohlberg/&gt;

The first stage in the preconventional level is obedience and punishment.  In this stage people, usually young children, avoid certain behaviors only because of the fear of punishment, not because they see them as wrong.&lt;ref name=aboutKohlberg/&gt; The second stage in the preconventional level is called individualism and exchange: in this stage people make moral decisions based on what best serves their needs.&lt;ref name=aboutKohlberg/&gt;

The third stage is part of the conventional morality level and is called interpersonal relationships. In this stage one tries to conform to what is considered moral by the society that they live in, attempting to be seen by peers as a good person.&lt;ref name=aboutKohlberg/&gt;  The fourth stage is also in the conventional morality level and is called maintaining social order.  This stage focuses on a view of society as a whole and following the laws and rules of that society.&lt;ref name=aboutKohlberg/&gt; &lt;!-- The philosopher [[Immanuel Kant]] held a similar view to this, claiming that "our transcendent capacity to act on our conception of a practical law enables us to set ends and to follow morality even when doing so sharply conflicts with our interests".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Richardson|first=Henry S.|title=Moral Reasoning|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2009/entries/reasoning-moral/|work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2009 Edition)|accessdate=20 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commented out: Citation is not from Kant but from Richardson, and this is OR--no mention of Kohlberg. --&gt;

The fifth stage is a part of the postconventional level and is called social contract and individual rights. In this stage people begin to consider differing ideas about morality in other people and feel that rules and laws should be agreed on by the members of a society.&lt;ref name=aboutKohlberg/&gt; The sixth and final stage of moral development, the second in the postconventional level, is called universal principles.  At this stage people begin to develop their ideas of universal moral principles and will consider them the right thing to do regardless of what the laws of a society are.&lt;ref name=aboutKohlberg/&gt;

==Jean Piaget==
Another psychologist who contributed to the field of moral reasoning was [[Jean Piaget]].  He developed two phases of moral development, one common among children and the other common among adults. The first is known as the Heteronomous Phase.&lt;ref name=Walsh&gt;{{cite web|last=Walsh|first=Keiron|title=Piaget's Theory of Moral Development|url=http://alevelpsychology.co.uk/?q=piagets-theory-moral-development|publisher=Development of Moral Understanding|accessdate=11 Oct 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This phase, more common among children, is characterized by the idea that rules come from authority figures in one's life such as parents, teachers, and God.&lt;ref name=Walsh/&gt; It also involves the idea that rules are permanent no matter what.&lt;ref name=Walsh/&gt; Thirdly, this phase of moral development includes the belief that "naughty" behavior must always be punished and that the punishment will be proportional.&lt;ref name=Walsh/&gt;

The second phase in Piaget's theory of moral development is referred to as the Autonomous Phase.  This phase is more common after one has matured and is no longer a child. In this phase people begin to view the intentions behind actions as more important than their consequences.&lt;ref name=Walsh/&gt; For instance, if a person who is driving swerves in order to not hit a dog and then knocks over a road sign, adults are likely to be less angry at the person than if he or she had done it on purpose just for fun.  Even though the outcome is the same, people are more forgiving because of the good intention of saving the dog. This phase also includes the idea that people have different morals and that morality is not necessarily universal.&lt;ref name=Walsh/&gt; People in the Autonomous Phase also believe rules may be broken under certain circumstances.&lt;ref name=Walsh/&gt; For instance, [[Rosa Parks]] broke the law by refusing to give up her seat on a bus, which was against the law but something many people consider moral nonetheless. In this phase people also stop believing in the idea of immanent justice.&lt;ref name=Walsh/&gt;

==Jonathan Haidt==
Jonathan Haidt is a social psychologist who defines moral as: the sudden appearance in consciousness of a moral judgment, including an affective valence (good–bad, like–dislike), without any awareness of having gone through steps of searching, weighing evidence, or inferring a moral conclusion. Moral intuition is therefore the psychological process that the Scottish philosophers talked about, aprocess akin to aesthetic judgment. One sees or hears about an event and one instantly feels approval or disapproval.&lt;ref&gt;''The Emotional Dog and its Rational Tail: A Social Intuitionist Approach to Moral Judgement'' (2001), p.818&lt;/ref&gt; Haidt argues that many people do not utilize conscious reasoning to make our judgments.

==Agusto Blasi==
Gusto Blasi is a moral psychologist who rebuts the theories of Jonathan Haidt on moral intuition and reasoning. He agrees with Haidt that moral intuition plays a significant role in the way humans operate. However, Blasi suggests that people use moral reasoning more than Haidt and other cognitive scientists claim. Blasi advocates moral reasoning and reflection as the foundation of moral functioning. Reasoning and reflection play a key role in the growth of an individual and the progress of societies. Blasi, A. (2009). &lt;ref&gt;The moral functioning of mature adults and the possibility of fair moral reasoning. In D. Narvaez and D. K. Lapsley (Eds.), Personality, identity, and character: Explorations in moral psychology (pp.396-440) New York: Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

==In philosophy==
Philosopher [[David Hume]] and psychologist [[Jonathan Haidt]] both claim that morality is based more on perceptions than on logical reasoning.&lt;ref name=SJDM&gt;{{cite web|url=http://journal.sjdm.org/jdm8105.pdf|title=The psychology of moral reasoning|last1=Bucciarelli|first1=Monica|last2=Khemlani|first2=Sangeet|last3=Johnson-Laird|first3= P.N.|date=February 2008|work=Judgment and Decision Making, Vol. 3, No. 2|accessdate=20 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This means that people's morality is based more on their emotions and feelings than on a logical analysis of any given situation. Hume regards morals as linked to passion, love, happiness, and other emotions and therefore not based on reason.&lt;ref name=SJDM/&gt; Haidt agrees, arguing that reasoning concerning a moral situation or idea follows an initial intuition.&lt;ref name=SJDM/&gt; Haidt's fundamental stance on moral reasoning is that "moral intuitions (including moral emotions) come first and directly cause moral judgments"; he characterizes a moral intuition as "the sudden appearance in consciousness of a moral judgment, including an affective valence (good-bad, like-dislike), without any conscious awareness of having gone through steps of searching, weighing evidence, or inferring a conclusion".&lt;ref name=SJDM/&gt;

[[Immanuel Kant]] had a radically different view of morality. In his view, there are universal laws of morality that no one should never break regardless of emotions.&lt;ref name=SJDM/&gt; He proposes a four-step system to determine whether or not a given action was moral based on logic and reason. The first step of this method involves formulating "a maxim capturing your reason for an action".&lt;ref name=SJDM/&gt; In the second step, one "frame[s] it as a universal principle for all rational agents".&lt;ref name=SJDM/&gt; The third step is assessing "whether a world based on this universal principle is conceivable".&lt;ref name=SJDM/&gt; If it is, then the fourth step is asking oneself "whether [one] would will the maxim to be a principle in this world".&lt;ref name=SJDM/&gt; In essence, an action is moral if the maxim by which it is justified is one which could be universalized.  For instance, when deciding whether or not to lie to someone for one's own advantage, one is meant to imagine what the world would be like if everyone always lied, and successfully so.  In such a world, there would be no purpose in lying, for everybody would expect deceit, rendering the universal maxim of lying whenever it is to your advantage absurd.  Thus, Kant argues that  one should not lie under any circumstance. Another example would be if trying to decide whether suicide is moral or immoral; imagine if everyone committed suicide. Since mass international suicide would not be a good thing, the act of suicide is immoral. Kant's moral framework, however, operates under the overarching maxim that you should treat each person as an end in themselves, not as a means to an end. This overarching maxim must be considered when applying the four aforementioned steps. &lt;ref name=SJDM/&gt;

==Gender==

At one time psychologists believed that men and women have different moral values and reasoning.  This was based on the idea that men and women often think differently and would react to moral dilemmas in different ways. Some researchers hypothesized that women would favor care reasoning, meaning that they would consider issues of need and sacrifice, while men would be more inclined to favor fairness and rights, which is known as justice reasoning.&lt;ref name=GenderDiffs&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pwq.sagepub.com/content/17/1/85.abstract|title=Gender Differences in Moral Reasoning: Stable or Situational?|last1=Clopton|first1=Nancy A.|last2=Sorell|first2=Gwendolyn T.|date=March 1993|work=Psychology of Women Quarterly Vol. 17 No. 1|doi=10.1111/j.1471-6402.1993.tb00678.x|accessdate=21 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some also knew that men and women simply face different moral dilemmas on a day-to-day basis and that might be the reason for the perceived difference in their moral reasoning.&lt;ref name=GenderDiffs/&gt;  With these two ideas in mind, researchers decided to do their experiments based on moral dilemmas that both men and women face regularly. To reduce situational differences and discern how both genders use reason in their moral judgments, they therefore ran the tests on parenting situations, since both genders can be involved in child rearing.&lt;ref name=GenderDiffs/&gt; The research showed that women and men use the same form of moral reasoning as one another and the only difference is the moral dilemmas they find themselves in on a day-to-day basis.&lt;ref name=GenderDiffs/&gt;  When it came to moral decisions both men and women would be faced with, they often chose the same solution as being the moral choice. At least this research shows that a division in terms of morality does not actually exist, and that reasoning between genders is the same in moral decisions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10592">'''Natalism''' (also called '''pronatalism''' or the '''pro-birth''' position) is a belief that promotes [[reproduction]] of [[sentient]] life.&lt;ref name=definition&gt;{{cite book|last1=McKeown|first1=John|title=God's Babies: Natalism and Bible Interpretation in Modern America|date=2014|publisher=Open Books|location=Cambridge|pages=2–4|url=http://www.openbookpublishers.com/product/263/gods-babies--natalism-and-bible-interpretation-in-modern-america}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{request quote|date=May 2018}} The term is taken from the Latin adjective form for "birth", ''natalis''. Natalism promotes [[child-bearing]] and [[parent]]hood as desirable for social reasons and to ensure the continuance of humanity. Natalism in public policy typically seeks to create financial and social incentives for populations to reproduce, such as providing tax incentives that reward having and supporting children. Adherents of more stringent takes on natalism may seek to limit access to [[abortion]] and [[contraception]], as well. The opposite of natalism is [[antinatalism]].

===Intention to have children===
{{Further|Fertility factor (demography)#Intention}}
An intention to have children is a substantial [[Fertility factor (demography)|fertility factor]] in actually ending up doing so, but childless individuals who intend to have children immediately or within 2 or 3 years are generally more likely to succeed than those who intend to have children in the long-term.&lt;ref name=balbo2013&gt;{{cite journal|title=Fertility in Advanced Societies: A Review of Research|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10680-012-9277-y|author1=Nicoletta Balbo |author2=Francesco C. Billari |author3=Melinda Mills |journal=European Journal of Population|year=2013|volume=29|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There are many determinants of the intention to have children, including:
*The mother's preference of family size, which influences that of the children through early adulthood.&lt;ref name="AxinnClarkberg1994"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Axinn|first1=William G.|last2=Clarkberg|first2=Marin E.|last3=Thornton|first3=Arland|title=Family Influences on Family Size Preferences|journal=Demography|volume=31|issue=1|year=1994|pages=65|issn=0070-3370|doi=10.2307/2061908}}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, the [[extended family]] influences fertility intentions, with increased number of nephews and nieces increasing the preferred number of children.&lt;ref name=balbo2013/&gt;
*Social pressure from kin and friends to have another child.&lt;ref name=balbo2013/&gt;
*Social support. However, a study from [[West Germany]] came to the result that both men receiving no support at all and receiving support from many different people have a lower probability of intending to have another child, with the latter probably related to coordination problems.&lt;ref name=balbo2013/&gt;
*Happiness, with happier people tending to want more children.&lt;ref name=balbo2013/&gt;
*Secure housing situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Vignoli, Daniele and Rinesi, Francesca and Mussino, Eleonora|title=A home to plan the first child?

==Natalistic politics==
{{Further|Human population planning}}
Some countries with [[population decline]] offer incentives to the people to have large families as a means of [[Population decline#National efforts to reverse declining populations|national efforts to reverse declining populations]].  Incentives may include a one time [[baby bonus]], or ongoing [[child benefit]] payments or tax reductions.  Some impose penalties or [[tax on childlessness|taxes]] on those with fewer children. Some nations, such as [[Japan]], [[Singapore]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Pro-natalism: Breaking the baby strike |url=https://www.economist.com/news/international/21659763-people-rich-countries-can-be-coaxed-having-more-children-lazy-husbands-and | newspaper=[[The Economist]] | date=25 July 2015 | accessdate=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[South Korea]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/08/21/world/asia/south-korea-in-turnabout-now-calls-for-more-babies.html?_r=0 | title=South Korea, in Turnabout, Now Calls for More Babies | publisher=[[The New York Times]] | date=21 August 2005 | accessdate=27 April 2016 | author=Onishi, Norimitsu}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Taiwan]], have implemented, or tried to implement, interventionist natalist policies, creating incentives for larger families among native stock. Immigrants are generally not part of natalist policies.

Paid [[Parental leave|maternity and paternity leave policies]] can also be used as an incentive. For example, [[Sweden]] has generous parental leave wherein parents are entitled to share 16 months paid leave per child, the cost divided between both employer and [[State (polity)|State]].

Books advocating natalist policies include ''[[What to Expect When No One's Expecting]]'' by [[Jonathan V. Last]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/2014/04/24/case-for-more-babies/ |title=The Case for More Babies |first=Joel E. |last=Cohen |date=April 24, 2014 |newspaper=[[The New York Review of Books]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Antinatalism==
{{Main| Antinatalism}}
Antinatalism, or anti-natalism, is a philosophical position that assigns a negative [[value (ethics)|value]] to [[birth]]. Antinatalists argue that people should refrain from procreation because it is [[Ethics|ethically]] [[evil|bad]] (some also recognize procreation of other [[sentience|sentient beings]] as ethically bad).{{cn|date=June 2018}} In scholarly and in literary writings, various [[ethics|ethical]] foundations have been adduced for antinatalism.&lt;ref&gt;K. Akerma, ''Antinatalismus – Ein Handbuch'', epubli, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the earliest surviving formulations of the idea that it would be better not to have been born come from ancient Greece.&lt;ref&gt;W. Tatarkiewicz, ''O szczęściu'' (On Happiness), Warszawa: Państwowe Wydawnictwo Naukowe, 1979, pp. 420-421.&lt;/ref&gt; The term "antinatalism" was used probably for the first time as the name of the position by [[Théophile de Giraud]] (born 1968) in his book ''L'art de guillotiner les procréateurs: Manifeste anti-nataliste''.&lt;ref&gt;K. Akerma, ''Antinatalismus – Ein Handbuch'', epubli, 2017, p. 301.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Tibetan Buddhism}}

The term '''Nyönpa''' ({{bo|w=smyon pa}} "mad one(s)"; Sanskrit [[avadhuta|''avadhūta'']]) may refer to a group of Tibetan Buddhist yogis or a single individual belonging to this group. They were mainly known for their unusual style of teaching, to which they owed their names.

==Spiritual practices of the Nyönpa==
Recent scholarship has helped to illuminate many distinguishing features of the religious practices the Nyönpa; these practices are sometimes referred to in the literature as ''The Practice of Observance''.&lt;ref&gt;See Chapter Two in DiValerio (2015)&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=October 2018}} ''The Practice of Observance'' takes as its foundation the philosophy of [[tulshuk]] or [[chöpa]] or even [[tulshuk chöpa]].&lt;ref&gt;See Chapter Two in DiValerio (2015)&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=October 2018}} This religious philosophy is the common thread in the following spiritual practices of the Nyönpa:&lt;ref&gt;See Chapter Two in DiValerio (2015)&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=October 2018}}

*wandering homeless and taking on a new style of dress and a new mental attitude towards the world;
*consuming impure substances;
*drinking alcohol and eating meat;
*singing and dancing;
*behaving fearlessly;
*engaging in sexual behavior.

Practices that a serious Nyönpa should avoid include:

*not to read spiritual texts;
*not to recite prayers in the usual ways.

Some Nyönpa were also famous for the practice of [[Chöd]].

==List of some known Nyönpa==
There are some recorded historical descriptions of those exhibiting the behavior and spiritual practice of the nyönpa in both Tibet and India including:

*[[Do Khyentse Yeshe Dorje]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Do_Khyentse_Yeshe_Dorje&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Drukpa Kunley]]
*[[2nd Dalai Lama|Gendün Gyatso]], the Second Dalai Lama&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Gendün_Gyatso&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Kalapa]], the "Handsome Madman", one of the [[Mahasiddha|84 Mahasiddas]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Eighty-four_mahasiddhas&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Lakṣmīṅkarā]], the "Crazy Princess", another of the [[Mahasiddha|84 Mahasiddas]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Eighty-four_mahasiddhas&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Mekhala and Kanakhala|Mekhala]] and [[Mekhala and Kanakhala|Kankhala]], often called the "Two Headless Sisters", also part of the group of the [[Mahasiddha|84 Mahasiddas]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Eighty-four_mahasiddhas&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Pema Jigme Chöying Rangdrol]], the Second Degyal Rinpoche&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Second_Degyal_Rinpoche&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Sönam Peldren]]&lt;ref&gt;See Bessenger (2016)&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Thang Tong Gyalpo]]
*[[Tsangnyön Heruka]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Tsangnyön_Heruka&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.treasuryoflives.org/biographies/view/Tsangnyon-Heruka/6856&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Ünyön Künga Zangpo|Ü Nyön Kunga Zangpo]]&lt;ref&gt;See DiValerio (2015) and DiValerio (2016)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Women and the path of the Nyönpa==
There is evidence that women also took inspiration from the spiritual practices and ways of conduct of the Nyönpa.

The most famous Tibetan woman exhibiting signs of the path of the Nyönpa would be the Tibetan female saint [[Sönam Peldren]] who probably lived in the 14th century.&lt;ref&gt;See Bessenger, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Sönam Peldren was eventually understood as an emanation of [[Vajravārāhī]] in the female [[tulku]] incarnation lineage of the [[Samding Dorje Phagmo]].&lt;ref&gt;Bessenger (2016) and Diemberger (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

Before this, in India, there were three women in the grouping of the [[Mahasiddha|84 Mahasidda]] whose spiritual behavior would indicate that they practiced according to this spiritual path. They are [[Lakṣmīṅkarā]], the "Crazy Princess", and the "Two Headless Sisters" [[Mekhala and Kanakhala]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Eighty-four_mahasiddhas&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4617">'''Oskar Kraus''' (24 July 1872 – 26 September 1942) was a Czech [[philosopher]] and [[jurist]].

==Life==
Oskar Kraus, who converted from the [[Judaism|Jewish]] to the [[Protestantism|Protestant]] faith, was born in [[Prague]], the son of Hermann Kraus and Clara Reitler-Eidlitz. In 1899 he married Bertha Chitz.

In 1890 he began to study [[jurisprudence]] and [[philosophy]] under [[Friedrich Jodl]] and [[Anton Marty]], who introduced him into [[Franz Brentano]]'s philosophy. Kraus made his [[Doctor of Philosophy]] in 1895 and attained the [[habilitation]] in philosophy in 1902. In 1909 he became Professor extraordinarius and in 1916 Professor ordinarius. After the Germans occupied [[Czechoslovakia]] in 1939, Kraus was put into an [[concentration camp]]; however, after he was released he fled to [[Great Britain]]. At the University Edinburgh he held [[Gifford Lectures]] in 1941. In 1942 he died, aged 70, in [[Oxford]], of [[cancer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{NDB|12|696|698|Kraus, Oskar|Friedbert Holz}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gifford Lectures: [http://www.giffordlectures.org/Author.asp?AuthorID=100 Oskar Kraus] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927041149/http://www.giffordlectures.org/Author.asp?AuthorID=100 |date=2007-09-27 }}, (Publications taken from this source)&lt;/ref&gt;

Family:
*Wally Oskarovich Kraus (1930 – 21 October 1981) — son, died in an accident
*Yuriy Voldemarovich Kraus (b. 30 March 1966 in [[Tallinn]])

==Work==
During [[World War I]], Kraus worked on topics in relation to [[war]] and [[ethics]] and wrote important works in the field of [[public international law]]. 

Influenced by Brentano, Kraus developed an ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' [[value theory]], which was formulated in opposition to [[Marxism|Marxian]] value theory. He also applied this method on [[Theory of value (economics)|economics]]. 

Based on his ideas on law and duty he developed a juristic [[hermeneutics]] in the field of [[jurisprudence]], and criticized [[historism]] and [[positivism]].

Kraus was also known for his criticism of the [[theory of relativity]], which was according to him an accumulation of "absurdities" (like the constancy of the speed of light) and "mathematical fictions".

'''Robert Boyce Brandom''' (born March 13, 1950)&lt;ref name="CV"&gt;[http://www.pitt.edu/~rbrandom/cv.html Robert Boyce Brandom - Curriculum Vitae]&lt;/ref&gt; is an American [[philosopher]] who teaches at the [[University of Pittsburgh]]. He works primarily in [[philosophy of language]], [[philosophy of mind]] and [[philosophical logic]], and his work manifests both systematic and historical interests in these topics. His work has presented "arguably the first fully systematic and technically rigorous attempt to explain the meaning of linguistic items in terms of their socially norm-governed use ('meaning as use', to cite the Wittgensteinian slogan), thereby also giving a [[Antirepresentationalism|non-representationalist]] account of the intentionality of thought and the rationality of action as well."&lt;ref&gt;[https://ndpr.nd.edu/news/24555-reading-brandom-on-making-it-explicit/ ''Reading Brandom: On Making It Explicit'']. Reviewed by James R. O'Shea, University College Dublin&lt;/ref&gt;

Brandom is broadly considered to be part of the American [[Pragmatism (philosophy)|pragmatist]] tradition in philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pragmatism/|title=Pragmatism|first=Christopher|last=Hookway|publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|date=16 August 2008|accessdate=9 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/pragmati/|title=Pragmatism|first=Douglas|last=McDermid|work=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|date=15 December 2006|accessdate=9 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, he won the Mellon Distinguished Achievement Award.

==Education==
Brandom earned his [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in 1972 from [[Yale University]] and his [[Ph.D.]] in 1977 from [[Princeton University]], under [[Richard Rorty]] and [[David Kellogg Lewis]].&lt;ref name="CV"/&gt; His doctoral thesis was titled ''Practice and Object''.&lt;ref name="CV"/&gt;

==Philosophy&lt;!--'Logical expressivism' redirects here--&gt;==
Brandom's work is heavily influenced by that of [[Wilfrid Sellars]], [[Richard Rorty]], [[Michael Dummett]] and his Pittsburgh colleague [[John McDowell]].  He also draws heavily on the works of [[Immanuel Kant]], [[G. W. F. Hegel]], [[Gottlob Frege]], and [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]].

He is best known for his investigations of linguistic meanings, or [[semantics]]. He advocates the view that the meaning of an expression is fixed by how it is used in [[inference]]s (see [[inferential role semantics]]). This project is developed at length in his influential 1994 book, ''[[Making It Explicit]]'', and more briefly in ''Articulating Reasons: An Introduction to Inferentialism'' (2000); a chapter of that latter work, "Semantic Inferentialism and Logical Expressivism", outlines the main themes of [[representationalism]] (the tradition of basing semantics on the concept of representation) vs. inferentialism (the conviction for an expression to be meaningful is has to be governed by a certain kind of inferential rules) and inferentialism's relationship to '''logical expressivism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; (the conviction that "logic is expressive in the sense that it makes explicit or codifies certain aspects of the inferential structure of our discursive practice").&lt;ref&gt;James Lindsey David Brown, "Propositions and Nondescriptivism in Metaethics", MPhil thesis, University College London, 2016, p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

Brandom has also published a collection of essays on the [[history of philosophy]], ''Tales of the Mighty Dead'' (2002), a critical and historical sketch of what he calls the "philosophy of intentionality".  He is the editor of a collection of papers about [[Richard Rorty]]'s philosophy, ''Rorty and His Critics'' (2000).  He delivered the 2006 [[John Locke lectures]] at [[Oxford University]], and they have been published by Oxford University Press under the title ''Between Saying and Doing: Towards an Analytic Pragmatism'' (2008). Brandom is currently working on a book dealing with Hegel's ''[[Phenomenology of Spirit]]''.

The SBLGNT features an apparatus that records differences not among manuscripts, but rather from other published editions of the Greek New Testament. According to the editors this is a function of a "reading edition" that calls attention to text critical issues.&lt;ref name="holmes" /&gt; The text was created by starting with the [[The New Testament in the Original Greek|Westcott and Hort]] text&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.supakoo.com/rick/ricoblog/2010/10/29/OnTheSBLGreekNewTestamentSBLGNT.aspx|title=supakoo.com|website=www.supakoo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then comparing it to [[Samuel Prideaux Tregelles|Tregelles]], Robinson-Pierpont, and the text underlying the [[New International Version|NIV]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sblgnt.com/about/introduction/|title=SBL Greek New Testament - Introduction|website=sblgnt.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Sa Aking mga Kabata'''" ({{lang-en|To My Fellow Youth}}) is a [[poem]] about the love of one's native language written in [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]]. It is widely attributed to the [[Filipino people|Filipino]] [[national hero of the Philippines|national hero]] [[José Rizal]], who supposedly wrote it in 1869 at the age of eight.&lt;ref name="romero"&gt;{{cite book|author1=M.C. Romero |author2=J.R. Sta Romana |author3=L.Y. Santos  |last-author-amp=yes |title =Rizal and the Development of National Consciousness|publisher =Goodwill Trading Co., Inc.|year =2006|page=104|isbn =978-971-574-103-3|url =https://books.google.com/books?id=ngonYm_SDSIC&amp;lpg=PA103&amp;dq=sa%20aking%20mga%20kababata&amp;hl=en&amp;pg=PA104#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no evidence, however, to support authorship by Rizal and several historians now believe it to be a [[hoax]].&lt;ref name= "ocampo" /&gt; The actual author of the poem is suspected to have been the poets Gabriel Beato Francisco or Herminigildo Cruz.&lt;ref name="morrow"/&gt;

==Prominence==
[[File:Sa Aking Mga Kabata (in Herminigildo Cruz, Kun Sino ang Kumatha ng Florante, 1906).jpg|thumb|The oldest known copy of the poem appears in ''Kun sino ang kumathâ ng̃ "Florante": kasaysayan sa buhay ni Francisco Baltazar at pag-uulat nang kanyang karunung̃a't kadakilaan (1906) by Hermenigildo Cruz. Note that the poem uses the [[Philippine Commonwealth]]-era [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] spelling with a 'K'. If Rizal had indeed written it, it should have used the phonetically equivalent Spanish 'C'.]]
The poem was widely taught in Philippine schools to point out Rizal's precociousness and early development of his nationalistic ideals.&lt;ref name="romero"/&gt;

A passage of the poem often paraphrased as ''Ang hindì marunong magmahal sa sariling wikà, masahol pa sa hayop at malansang isdâ'' (English: 'He that knows not to love his own language, is worse than beasts and putrid fish') is widely quoted to promote the use of Tagalog among Filipinos. It is encountered most frequently during the ''Buwan ng Wika'' ('Language Month'), a commemoration of the establishment of the [[Filipino language]] as the national language of the Philippines.&lt;ref name="sillimanian"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theweeklysillimanian.com/?p=1121|title=Hindi Ka Pinoy|date=August 2011|publisher=The Weekly Sillimanian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="zamboanga"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zamboangatimes.ph/inside-stories/2288-buwan-ng-wika-2011.html|title=Buwan ng Wika 2011 |author=Cesar A.

==Publication history==
No manuscript for ''Sa Aking Mga Kabatà'' written in Rizal's handwriting exists.&lt;ref name="valdez"&gt;{{cite book|author=Valdez|title =Doctor Jose Rizal and the writing of his story|publisher =Rex Bookstore, Inc.|year =2007|page=279|isbn =978-971-23-4868-6|url =https://books.google.com/books?id=ixcoCv2o2NoC&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;hl=en&amp;pg=PT288#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The poem was first published in 1906, a decade after his death, in a book authored by the poet Hermenigildo Cruz. Cruz claimed that he received the poem from another poet, Gabriel Beato Francisco, who in turn received it in 1884 from an alleged close friend of Rizal, Saturnino Raselis. José Rizal, however, has never mentioned anyone by the name of Saturnino Raselis.&lt;ref name= "ocampo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/45479/did-young-rizal-really-write-poem-for-children|author=Ambeth Ocampo|authorlink=Ambeth Ocampo|publisher=[[Philippine Daily Inquirer]]|title=Did young Rizal really write poem for children?|date=August 22, 2011|work=newsinfo.inquirer.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pilipino-express.com/pdfs/inotherwords/Something%20Fishy%20About%20Rizal%20Poem.pdf Hermenegildo Cruz (1906)] (in Tagalog) ''Kun Sino ang Kumathâ ng “Florante”, Kasaysayan Ng Búhay Ni Francisco Baltazar at Pag-uulat Nang Kanyang Karununga’t Kadakilaan.'' p. 188 ''Ang tulang itó ay utang ko sa kaibigan kong si G. Gabriel Beato Francisco. Ito’y ipinagkaloob sa kanyá ni G. Saturnino Raselis, táong tunay sa Lukbán, na naging gurò (maestro) sa Mahayhay ng taóng 1884. Ang ginoóng itó ay isang matalik na kaibigan ni Rizal na siyang nagkaloob sa kanyá (sa gurò) ng isang salin nitong tulâ, tandâ, dî umanó, ng kanilang pagka-katoto.''&lt;/ref&gt; The poem may have actually been written by Cruz or Francisco.&lt;ref name= "ocampo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="morrow"/&gt;

[[Pascual H. Poblete]] published a different account in his introduction to the 1909 translation ''Noli Me Tangere; Novelang Wicang Castila Na Tinagalog Ni Pascual H. Poblete'' (note old Tagalog spelling), he claims that the poem was well-known to Filipino poets during Rizal's childhood.&lt;ref name="poblete"&gt;{{cite book|author=Pascual H. Poblete|author-link=Pascual H.

This is not substantiated by any known evidence.&lt;ref name="morrow"/&gt;

The earliest known poems of Rizal in the [[National Historical Commission of the Philippines|National Historical Institute]]’s collection, ''Poesías Por José Rizal'', also date six years after the alleged writing date of ''Sa Aking Mga Kabatà''. His own account of the earliest awakening of his nationalistic views, identifies it as the year 1872 – the year of the [[Gomburza|executions]] of the priests [[Mariano Gómez]], [[José Apolonio Burgos]], and [[Jacinto Zamora]].&lt;ref name="ponce"&gt;[http://www.filipiniana.net/publication/rizal-paris-18-april-1889-to-mariano-ponce/13097440725771/1/0 José Rizal to Mariano Ponce (April 18, 1889; 18 Rue de Rochechouart, Paris).] ''Without 1872 there would not be now either a Plaridel, or Jaena, or Sanciangco, or would there exist brave and generous Filipino colonies in Europe; without 1872 Rizal would be a Jesuit now and instead of writing ''Noli me tángere'', would have written the opposite. At the sight of those injustices and cruelties, while still a child, my imagination was awakened and I swore to devote myself to avenge one day so many victims, and with this idea in mind I have been studying and this can be read in all my works and writings.''&lt;/ref&gt; The poem is never mentioned by Rizal himself in all his voluminous writings, despite its apparent significance in terms of his future ideals.&lt;ref name="morrow"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Paul Morrow|date=July 16–31, 2011|title=Something fishy about Rizal poem|journal=The Pilipino Express|volume=7|issue=14|pages=1&amp;ndash;33|publisher=The Pilipino Express Inc.|url=http://www.pilipino-express.com/pdfs/inotherwords/Something%20Fishy%20About%20Rizal%20Poem.pdf|accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Authenticity==
Historian [[Ambeth Ocampo]], [[National Artist of the Philippines]] and writer [[Virgilio S. Almario]] and others have debunked Rizal's traditional authorship of the poem based on the following:&lt;ref name= "ocampo" /&gt;

The poem uses the Tagalog word ''kalayaan'' (liberty/freedom). However, Rizal first encountered the word at least by 1882, when he was 25 years old – 17 years after he supposedly wrote the poem. Rizal first came across ''kalayaan'', or as it was spelled, ''kalayahan'', through a Tagalog translation by [[Marcelo H. del Pilar]] of Rizal's own essay ''El Amor Patrio''.&lt;ref name= "ocampo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kalayahan"/&gt;

The fluency and sophistication of the Tagalog used in the poem also do not match Rizal's grasp of the language. Although Rizal's native tongue was Tagalog, his early education was all in Spanish. In the oft-quoted anecdote of the moth and the flame from Rizal's memoir, the children's book he and his mother were reading was entitled ''El Amigo de los Niños'', and it was in Spanish.&lt;ref name="memoir"&gt;{{cite book|author=José Rizal (under the pseudonym P. Jacinto)|title =Memoirs of a Student in Manila|chapter=Chapter 8: My First Reminiscence|url =http://joserizal.info/Biography/memoirs-chapter8.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; He would later lament his difficulties in expressing himself in Tagalog. In 1886, Rizal was in Leipzig working on a Tagalog translation of [[Friedrich Schiller]]'s ''[[William Tell (play)|William Tell]]'', which he sent home to his brother [[Paciano Rizal|Paciano]]. In the accompanying letter, Rizal speaks of his difficulty finding an appropriate Tagalog equivalent of ''Freiheit'' (freedom), settling on ''kalayahan''. Rizal cited Del Pilar's translation of his own essay as his source for ''kalayahan''.&lt;ref name= "ocampo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kalayahan"&gt;[http://www.filipiniana.net/publication/rizal-leipzig-12-october-1886-to-paciano-rizal/12791881737302/1/0 José Rizal to Paciano Rizal (October 12, 1886; 40-11 Albertstrasse, Leipzig).] ''I lacked many words, for example, for the word ''Freiheit'' or ''liberty''. The Tagalog word ''kaligtasan'' cannot be used, because this means that formerly he was in some prison, slavery, etc. I found in the translation of Amor Patrio the noun ''malayá'', ''kalayahan'' that Marcelo del Pilar uses. In the only Tagalog book I have — Florante — I don't find an equivalent noun.''&lt;/ref&gt; Rizal also attempted to write ''[[Makamisa]]'' (the intended sequel to ''[[El filibusterismo]]'')  in Tagalog, only to give up after only ten pages and start again in Spanish.&lt;ref name= "ocampo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="morrow"/&gt;

The 8-year old Rizal's apparent familiarity with Latin and English is also questionable.&lt;ref name= "ocampo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="morrow"/&gt; In his memoir as a student in Manila, a year after the poem's supposed writing date, he admitted only having 'a little' knowledge of Latin from lessons by a friend of his father.&lt;ref name="memoir2"&gt;{{cite book|author=José Rizal (under the pseudonym P. Jacinto)|title =Memoirs of a Student in Manila|chapter=Chapter 2: My Life Away from My Parents / My Sufferings|url =http://joserizal.info/Biography/memoirs-chapter2.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rizal also did not study English until 1880, more than ten years after the poem was allegedly written. English was not a prominent language in the Philippines in 1869 and its presence in the poem is believed to betray later authorship during the [[Commonwealth of the Philippines|American Commonwealth of the Philippines]].&lt;ref name="morrow"/&gt;

The poem also makes use of the letters 'K' and 'W', whereas during Rizal's childhood, Tagalog spelling was based on Spanish orthography where neither letters were used. The letters 'C' and 'U' were used instead. (i.e., the poem would have been spelled "Sa Aquing Mañga Cabata")  The shift in Tagalog and later [[Filipino language|Filipino]] orthography from 'C' to 'K' and 'U' to 'W' were proposed by Rizal himself as an adult, and was later made official in the early 20th century by the Philippine government as per grammarian [[Lope K. Santos]]'s proposal.&lt;ref name= "ocampo" /&gt;

{{Verse translation|
'''Sa Aking Mga Kabata'''

Kapagka ang baya'y sadyáng umiibig
Sa kanyáng salitáng kaloob ng langit,
Sanlang kalayaan nasa ring masapit
Katulad ng ibong nasa himpapawid.

Pagka't ang salita'y isang kahatulan
Sa bayan, sa nayo't mga kaharián,
At ang isáng tao'y katulad, kabagay
Ng alin mang likha noong kalayaán.

Ang hindi magmahal sa kanyang salitâ
Mahigit sa hayop at malansáng isdâ,
Kayâ ang marapat pagyamaning kusà
Na tulad sa ináng tunay na nagpalà.

Ang wikang Tagalog tulad din sa Latin
Sa Inglés, Kastilà at salitang anghel,
Sapagka't ang Poong maalam tumingín
Ang siyang naggawad, nagbigay sa atin.

Ang salita nati'y huwad din sa iba
Na may alfabeto at sariling letra,
Na kaya nawalá'y dinatnan ng sigwâ
Ang lunday sa lawà noóng dakong una.|'''To My Fellow Youth'''

If a nation's people certainly love
The gift of their language bestowed by heaven,
So too will they regain their pawned freedom
Like a bird who takes to the sky.

For language is a measure of worth
Of cities, nations, and kingdoms,
And each person alike deserves it,
As does any creation born free.

One who does not treasure his own language
is worse than a beast or a putrid fish,
Thus it should be nurtured intently,
As a mother nurtures her child.

The language Tagalog is like Latin,
Like English, Spanish, and the language of angels
For the Lord, in His wisdom
Bestowed it, He gave it to us.

Our language is like that of others,
With its own alphabet and its own characters,
But they vanished as if a sudden storm had come upon
A boat in a lake in an age long past.}}

'''Sextus Empiricus''' ({{lang-grc-gre|Σέξτος Ἐμπειρικός}}; c. 160 – c. 210 CE, dates uncertain), was a [[physician]] and [[philosopher]], who likely lived in [[Alexandria]], [[Rome]], or [[Athens]]. His philosophical work is the most complete surviving account of ancient Greek and Roman [[Pyrrhonism]].

In his medical work, as reflected by his name, tradition maintains that he belonged to the [[empiric school]] in which [[Pyrrhonism]] was popular. However, at least twice in his writings, Sextus seems to place himself closer to the [[methodic school]]. He may have been the same person as [[Sextus of Chaeronea]].

== Writings ==
Sextus Empiricus's three surviving works are the ''Outlines of Pyrrhonism'' (Πυῤῥώνειοι ὑποτυπώσεις, ''Pyrrhōneioi hypotypōseis'', thus commonly abbreviated ''PH''), and two distinct works preserved under the same title, ''Against the Mathematicians'' (''Adversus Mathematicos''), one of which is probably incomplete as there are references in the text to parts that are not in the surviving text.

The first six books of ''Against the Mathematicians'' (Πρὸς μαθηματικούς, ''Pros mathematikous'') are commonly known as ''Against the Professors'', and each book also has a traditional title:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/sextus-empiricus/|title=Sextus Empiricus|author=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Against the Mathematicians '''I–VI''''' is sometimes distinguished from ''Against the Mathematicians '''VII–XI''''' by using an other title, ''Against the Dogmatists'' ( ''Πρὸς δογματικούς, Pros dogmatikous'') and then the remaining books are numbered as I–II,   III–IV, and  V, despite the fact that it is also commonly inferred that the beginning of such a separate work is missing and it is not known how many books might have preceded the extant books. The supposed general title of this work is ''Skeptical Treatises''' (''Σκεπτικὰ Ὑπομνήματα /Skeptika Hypomnēmata'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.de/books?id=WwpZVuylPgYC&amp;pg=PA303&amp;lpg=PA303&amp;dq=Skeptical+Treatises%27&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=xM0FO1-Ru7&amp;sig=rfs-K2IpRAwbvRaiGDPFY69TIrE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=pnFnVbaPOsbTU8i-gJAB&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Skeptical%20Treatises'&amp;f=false|title=A Companion to Socrates|authors=Sara Ahbel-Rappe, Rachana Kamtekar|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophy ==
Sextus Empiricus raised concerns which applied to all types of knowledge. He doubted the validity of [[problem of induction|induction]]&lt;ref&gt;Sextus Empiricus. ''[[Outlines of Pyrrhonism]]'' trans. [[Robert Gregg Bury|R.G. Bury]] (Loeb edn) (London: W. Heinemann, 1933), p. 283.&lt;/ref&gt; long before its best known critic [[David Hume]], and raised the [[regress argument]] against all forms of reasoning:
{{quote|Those who claim for themselves to judge the truth are bound to possess a criterion of truth. This criterion, then, either is without a judge's approval or has been approved. But if it is without approval, whence comes it that it is truthworthy? For no matter of dispute is to be trusted without judging. And, if it has been approved, that which approves it, in turn, either has been approved or has not been approved, and so on ''[[ad infinitum]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Sextus Empiricus. ''Against the Logicians'' trans. R.G. Bury (Loeb edn) (London: W. Heinemann, 1935) p. 179&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Because of these and other barriers to acquiring true beliefs, Sextus Empiricus advises&lt;ref&gt;The extent to which a skeptic can hold beliefs as well as the kinds of beliefs a skeptic can have is a matter of scholarly dispute.&lt;/ref&gt; that we should suspend judgment about virtually all beliefs; that is to say, we should neither affirm any belief as true nor deny any belief as false. This view is known as [[Pyrrhonian skepticism]], as distinguished from [[Academic skepticism]], as practiced by [[Carneades]], which, according to Sextus, denies knowledge altogether. Sextus did not deny the possibility of knowledge. He criticizes the Academic skeptic's claim that nothing is knowable as being an affirmative belief. Instead, Sextus advocates simply giving up belief; in other words, suspending judgment about whether or not anything is knowable.&lt;ref&gt;See ''PH'' I.3, I.8, I.198; cf. J. Barnes, "Introduction", xix ff., in Sextus Empiricus, ''Outlines of Scepticism''. Julia Annas and Jonathan Barnes (transl.) (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;  Only by suspending judgment can we attain a state of [[ataraxia]] (roughly, 'peace of mind').  Sextus did not think such a general suspension of judgment to be impractical, since we may live without any beliefs, acting by habit.

Sextus allowed that we might affirm claims about our experience (e.g., reports about our feelings or sensations).  That is, for some claim X that I feel or perceive, it could be true to say "it seems to me now that X."  However, he pointed out that this does not imply any objective knowledge of external reality. Though I might know that the honey I eat at a certain moment tastes sweet to me, this is merely a subjective judgment, and as such may not tell me anything true about the honey itself.

Interpretations of Sextus's philosophy along the above lines have been advocated by scholars such as [[Myles Burnyeat]],&lt;ref&gt;Burnyeat, M., "Can The Sceptic Live His Scepticism" in Myles Burnyeat and Michael Frede (ed.), ''The Original Sceptics: A Controversy'' (Hackett, 1997): 25–57. Cf.  Burnyeat, M., "The Sceptic in His Place and Time", ''ibid.'', 92–126.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jonathan Barnes]],&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, J., "The Beliefs of a Pyrrhonist" in Myles Burnyeat and Michael Frede (ed.), ''The Original Sceptics: A Controversy'' (Hackett, 1997): 58–91.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Benson Mates]].&lt;ref&gt;Mates, B.  ''The Skeptic Way'' (Oxford UP, 1996).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael Frede]], however, defends a different interpretation,&lt;ref&gt;Frede, M., "The Sceptic's Beliefs" in Myles Burnyeat and Michael Frede (ed.), ''The Original Sceptics: A Controversy'' (Hackett, 1997): 1–24. Cf. Frede, M., "The Skeptic's Two Kinds of Assent and the Question of the Possibility of Knowledge", ''ibid.'', 127–152.&lt;/ref&gt; according to which Sextus does allow beliefs, so long as they are not derived by reason, philosophy or speculation; a skeptic may, for example, accept common opinions in the skeptic's society. The important difference between the skeptic and the dogmatist is that the skeptic does not hold his beliefs ''as a result of rigorous philosophical investigation.''  In ''Against the Ethicists'', Sextus in fact directly says that "the Skeptic does not conduct his life according to philosophical theory (so far as regards this he is inactive), but as regards the non-philosophical regulation of life he is capable of desiring some things and avoiding others." (XI, 165). Thus, on this interpretation (and as per Sextus' own words), the skeptic may well entertain the belief that God does or does not exist or that virtue is good.  But he will not believe that such claims are true on the basis of ''reasons'' since, as far as the skeptic is aware, no reason for assenting to such claims has yet been shown to be "any more" credible than the reasons for their denial. (XIX)

It must also be remembered that by "dogma" Sextus means "assent to something non-evident [ἄδηλος, adēlos]" (PH I, 16). And by "non-evident" he means things which lie beyond appearances (and thus beyond proof or disproof), such as the existence and/or nature of causality, time, motion, or even proof itself. Thus, the skeptic will, for example, believe the proposition that "Dion is in the room" if sense-data and ordinary reasoning led to the emergence of such a belief. On the other hand, if he were to "strongly" assert that Dion was "really" in the room, then he may be met with opposing arguments of equal psychological force against the self-same proposition and experience mental disquietude as a result.  Thus, the Pyrrhonian  does not assent to the proposition "Dion is in the room" in a dogmatic way as that would purport to describe a non-evident reality which lies beyond the "appearance" [φαινόμενον, phainomenon] of Dion being in the room. The Skeptic simply goes along with the appearance just as "a child is persuaded by...his teacher." (PH I, 229). It is for this reason then that Sextus says the Skeptic lives undogmatically in accordance with appearances and also according to a "fourfold regimine of life" which includes the guidance of nature, compulsion of ''pathe'' (feelings), laws and customs, and instruction in arts and crafts. The Skeptic follows this course of life while suspending judgment concerning the ultimate truth of the non-evident matters debated in philosophy and the sciences (PH I, 17). Thus, the Pyrrhonian Skeptic is one who believes possibly many things, but yet does not dogmatize about those beliefs since he finds no ultimate justification for them. Thus, the Pyrrhonian achieves ''ataraxia'' not by casting certain judgments about appearances but rather through his refined ''ability'' to "oppose appearances to judgments" such that he is "brought firstly to a state of mental suspense and next to a state of 'unperturbedness' or 'quietude.'" (IV, 8)

Because of the high degree of similarity between the surviving works of Sextus Empiricus and those of the Buddhist philosopher, [[Nagarjuna]]&lt;ref&gt;Adrian Kuzminski, ''Pyrrhonism: How the Ancient Greeks Reinvented Buddhism'' 2008&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas McEvilley]] suspects that Nagarjuna and Sextus Empiricus were referencing some of the same earlier Pyrrhonist texts in developing their works.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas McEvilley, ''The Shape of Ancient Thought'' 2002 pp499-505&lt;/ref&gt;

== The ten modes of Pyrrhonism ==
Pyrrhonism is more a mental attitude or therapy than a theory. It involves setting things in opposition and owing to the [[equipollence]] of the objects and reasons, one suspends judgement. "We oppose either appearances to appearances or objects of thought to objects of thought or ''alternando.''"&lt;ref&gt;Sextus Empiricus, ''Outlines of Pyrrhonism'', Trans. R.G. Bury, Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1933, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; The ten modes induce suspension of judgement and in turn a state of mental suspense followed by ''[[ataraxia]].'' If ever one is in a position in which they are unable to refute a theory, Pyrrhonists reply "Just as, before the birth of the founder of the School to which you belong, the theory it holds was not as yet apparent as a sound theory, although it was really in existence, so likewise it is possible that the opposite theory to that which you now propound is already really existent, though not yet apparent to us, so that we ought not as yet to yield assent to this theory which at the moment seems to be valid."&lt;ref&gt;Sextus Empiricus, ''Outlines of Pyrrhonism'', Translated by R.G. Bury, Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1933, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;  These ten ''modes'' or ''tropes'' were originally listed by [[Aenesidemus]].

# "The same impressions are not produced by the same objects owing to the differences in animals."&lt;ref&gt;Sextus Empiricus, ''Outlines of Pyrrhonism'', Trans. R.G. Bury, Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1933, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;
# The same impressions are not produced by the same objects owing to the differences among human beings.&lt;ref&gt;Sextus Empiricus, ''Outlines of Pyrrhonism'', Trans. R.G. Bury, Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1933, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;
# The same impressions are not produced by the same objects owing to the differences among the senses.&lt;ref&gt;Sextus Empiricus, ''Outlines of Pyrrhonism'', Trans. R.G. Bury, Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1933, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;
# Owing to the "circumstances, conditions or dispositions," the same objects appear different. These are "states that are natural or unnatural, with waking or sleeping, with conditions due to age, motion or rest, hatred or love, emptiness or fullness, drunkenness or soberness, predispositions, confidence or fear, grief or joy."&lt;ref&gt;Sextus Empiricus, ''Outlines of Pyrrhonism'', Trans. R.G. Bury, Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1933, p.61&lt;/ref&gt;
# "Based on positions, distances, and locations; for owing to each of these the same objects appear different." For example, "the same porch e when viewed from one of its corners appears curtailed, but viewed from the middle symmetrical on all sides; and the same ship seems at a distance to be small and stationary, but from close at hand large and in motion ; and the same tower from a distance appears round but from a near point quadrangular." &lt;ref&gt;Sextus Empiricus, ''Outlines of Pyrrhonism'', Trans. R.G. Bury, Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1933, p.69-71&lt;/ref&gt;
# “We deduce that since no object strikes us entirely by itself, but along with something else, it may perhaps be possible to say what the mixture compounded out of the external object and the thing perceived with it is like, but we would not be able to say what the external object is like by itself."&lt;ref&gt;Sextus Empiricus, ''Outlines of Pyrrhonism'', Trans. R.G. Bury, Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1933, p.73&lt;/ref&gt;
# "Based, as we said, on the quantity and constitution of the underlying objects, meaning generally by "constitution" the manner of composition." So, for example, goat horn appears black when intact and appears white when ground up. Snow appears white when frozen and translucent as a liquid.&lt;ref&gt;Sextus Empiricus, ''Outlines of Pyrrhonism'', Trans. R.G. Bury, Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1933, p.77&lt;/ref&gt;
# "Since all things appear relative, we will suspend judgement about what things exist absolutely and really existent.&lt;ref&gt;Sextus Empiricus, ''Outlines of Pyrrhonism'', Trans. R.G. Bury, Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1933, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; Do things which exist "differentially" as opposed to those things that have a distinct existence of their own, differ from relative things or not?  If they do not differ, then they too are relative; but if they differ, then, since everything which differs is relative to something..., things which exist absolutely  are relative."&lt;ref&gt;Sextus Empiricus, ''Outlines of Pyrrhonism'', Trans. R.G. Bury, Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1933, p. 81&lt;/ref&gt;
# "Based on constancy or rarity of occurrence." The sun is more amazing than a comet, but because we see and feel the warmth of the sun daily and the comet rarely, the latter commands our attention.&lt;ref&gt;Sextus Empiricus, ''Outlines of Pyrrhonism'', Trans. R.G. Bury, Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1933, p. 83&lt;/ref&gt;
# "There is a Tenth Mode, which is mainly concerned with Ethics, being based on rules of conduct, habits, laws, legendary beliefs, and dogmatic conceptions."&lt;ref&gt;Sextus Empiricus, ''Outlines of Pyrrhonism'', Trans. R.G. Bury, Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1933, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;

Superordinate to these ten modes stand three other modes:
* I: that based on the subject who judges (modes 1, 2, 3 &amp; 4).
* II: that based on the object judged (modes 7 &amp; 10).
* III: that based on both subject who judges and object judged (modes 5, 6, 8 &amp; 9)

Superordinate to these three modes is the mode of relation.&lt;ref&gt;Sextus Empiricus, ''Outlines of Pyrrhonism'', Trans. R.G. Bury, Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1933, pp. 25–27&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legacy ==
An influential [[Latin]] translation of Sextus's ''Outlines'' was published by [[Henricus Stephanus]] in [[Geneva]] in 1562,&lt;ref&gt;Bican Şahin, [''Toleration: The Liberal Virtue''], Lexington Books, 2010, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; and this was followed by a complete Latin Sextus with [[Gentian Hervet]] as translator in 1569.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Popkin]] (editor), ''History of Western Philosophy'' (1998) p. 330.&lt;/ref&gt; Petrus and Jacobus Chouet published the Greek text for the first time in 1621. Stephanus did not publish it with his Latin translation either in 1562 or in 1569, nor was it published in the reprint of the latter in 1619.

Sextus's ''Outlines'' were widely read in [[Europe]] during the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries, and had a profound effect on [[Michel de Montaigne]], [[David Hume]], and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]], among many others.  Another source for the circulation of Sextus's ideas was [[Pierre Bayle]]'s ''Dictionary''. The legacy of Pyrrhonism is described in [[Richard Popkin]]'s ''The History of Skepticism from Erasmus to Descartes'' and ''High Road to Pyrrhonism''. The transmission of Sextus's manuscripts through antiquity and the Middle Ages is reconstructed by [[Luciano Floridi]]'s ''Sextus Empiricus, The Recovery and Transmission of Pyrrhonism'' (Oxford: [[Oxford University Press]], 2002). Since the Renaissance French philosophy has been continuously influenced by Sextus: [[Montaigne]] in the 16th century, [[Descartes]], [[Blaise Pascal]], [[Pierre-Daniel Huet]] and [[François de La Mothe Le Vayer]] in the 17th century, many of the "Philosophes," and in recent times controversial figures such as [[Michel Onfray]], in a direct line of filiation between Sextus' radical skepticism and secular or even radical atheism.&lt;ref&gt;Recent Greek-French edition of Sextus's works by Pierre Pellegrin, with an upbeat commentary. Paris: Seuil-Points, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sextus is the earliest known source for the proverb "Slowly grinds the mill of the gods, but it grinds fine", alluded to in [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow|Longfellow]]'s poem "[[Retribution (poem)|Retribution]]".&lt;ref&gt;D.L. Blank, trans., ''Sextus Empiricus: Against the Grammarians (Adversus Mathematicos I)'', p. 311, {{ISBN|0-19-824470-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A modern development and [[belief]] that the progress of [[knowledge]] is the result of distinct and independent spheres, and that knowledge in one discipline has little connection with knowledge in another discipline. Thus, ''specialists'' pursue their work in isolation from one another rather than as aspects of a unity or whole.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19233">The laws of '''state responsibility''' are the principles governing when and how a [[Sovereign state|state]] is held [[Moral responsibility|responsible]] for a breach of an international [[obligation]]. Rather than set forth any particular obligations, the rules of state responsibility determine, in general, when an obligation has been breached and the legal consequences of that violation. In this way they are "secondary" rules that address basic issues of responsibility and remedies available for breach of "primary" or [[substantive]] rules of [[international law]], such as with respect to the use of armed force. Because of this generality, the rules can be studied independently of the primary rules of obligation. They establish (1) the conditions of actions to qualify as internationally wrongful, (2) the circumstances under which actions of [[official]]s,&lt;ref&gt;It can safely be ruled out that the military can be summoned for the execution of an order issued from his state in violation of a rule of international law: {{cite journal|last1=Buonomo|first1=Giampiero|title = L'impossibilità (giuridica) degli accordi bilaterali per sottrarsi alla giurisdizione|journal= Diritto&amp;Giustizia edizione online |date=2002| url= https://www.questia.com/projects#!/project/89338131}} {{Subscription required |via=[[Questia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; private [[individual]]s and other entities may be attributed to the state, (3) general defences to liability and (4) the consequences of liability.

Until recently, the theory of the law of state responsibility was not well developed. The position has now changed, with the adoption of the '''Draft Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts''' ("Draft Articles") by the [[International Law Commission]] (ILC) in August 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/56/10%28SUPP%29 ''Draft Articles on the Responsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts, Report of the ILC on the Work of its Fifty-third Session,'' UN GAOR, 56th Sess, Supp No 10, p 43, UN Doc A/56/10 (2001)].&lt;/ref&gt; The Draft Articles are a combination of codification and progressive development. They have already been cited by the [[International Court of Justice]]&lt;ref&gt;The ICJ cited an earlier draft text of the Articles in ''Gabčíkovo-Nagyamaros Project (Hungary/Slovakia)'', ''ICJ Reports 1997'', at 7.&lt;/ref&gt; and have generally been well received.

Although the articles are general in coverage, they do not necessarily apply in all cases. Particular [[treaty]] regimes, such as the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] and the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], have established their own special rules of responsibility.

== History ==
Traditionally, the term "state responsibility" referred only to state responsibility for injuries to [[Alien (law)|aliens]]. It included not only "secondary" issues such as attribution and remedies, but also the primary rights and duties of states, for example the asserted international standard of treatment and the right of [[diplomatic protection]]. Early efforts by the [[League of Nations]] and private bodies to codify the rules of "state responsibility" reflected the traditional focus on responsibility for injuries to aliens.&lt;ref&gt;See Y. Matsui, "The Transformation of the Law of State Responsibility" (1993) 20 ''Thesaurus Acroasium'' 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The League's 1930 Codification Conference in [[The Hague]] was able to reach an agreement only on "secondary" issues such as [[imputation (law)|imputation]], not on substantive rules regarding the treatment of aliens and their property.

Attempts to codify and develop the rules of state responsibility have continued throughout the life of the [[United Nations]]. It took nearly 45 years, more than thirty reports, and extensive work by five Special Rapporteurs in order for the [[International Law Commission]] to reach agreement on the final text of the Draft Articles as a whole, with commentaries. At the same time, the [[customary international law]] of state responsibility concerning matters such as detention and physical ill-treatment of aliens and their [[right to a fair trial]] has been rendered less important than formerly by the development of international [[human rights]] law, which applies to all individuals, whether aliens or nationals. The concept of a general regime of legal responsibility, which the rules of state responsibility have taken on, is an inception of the [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] system and is largely foreign to the [[common law]] tradition.

=== Codification ===
The topic of state responsibility was one of the first 14 areas provisionally selected for the ILC's attention in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;''Report to the General Assembly'', [http://legal.un.org/ilc/publications/yearbooks/Ybkvolumes%28e%29/ILC_1949_v1_e.pdf 1949 ''Yearbook of the International Law Commission''] 277, at 281.&lt;/ref&gt; When the ILC listed the topic for codification in 1953, "state responsibility" was distinguished from a separate topic on the "treatment of aliens", reflecting the growing view that state responsibility encompasses the breach of an international obligation.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://legal.un.org/ilc/publications/yearbooks/Ybkvolumes%28e%29/ILC_1949_v1_e.pdf 1949 Year Book of the International Law Commission]'' 46, 49-50, UN Doc. A/CN.4/SER.A/1949.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ILC's first special rapporteur on state responsibility, [[F.V. García Amador]] of [[Cuba]], appointed in 1955 noted, "It would be difficult to find a topic beset with greater confusion and uncertainty."&lt;ref&gt;F. V. García Amador, ''First Report on International Responsibility'' [http://legal.un.org/ilc/publications/yearbooks/Ybkvolumes%28e%29/ILC_1956_v2_e.pdf 1956 2 Yearbook of the International Law Commission] 173 at 175, para. 6, UN Doc. A/CN.4/SER.A/1956/Add.1.&lt;/ref&gt; García Amador attempted to return to the traditional focus on responsibility for injury to aliens but his work was essentially abandoned by the ILC when his membership ended in 1961. His successor, [[Roberto Ago]] of [[Italy]], reconceptualised the ILC's work in terms of the distinction between primary and secondary rules, and also established the basic organisational structure of what would become the ''Draft Articles''. By focusing on general rules, stated at a high level of abstraction, Ago created a politically safe space within which the ILC could work and largely avoid the contentious debates of the day. From 1969 until his election to the ICJ in 1980, Ago completed work on part 1 of the draft articles, addressing the origin of state responsibility. Most of the thirty-five articles adopted during his tenure are reflected in the final draft.

Work on the remainder of the articles proceeded slowly throughout the 1980s and early 1990s. [[Willem Riphagen]] of the [[Netherlands]], who served as special rapporteur to 1986, stressed that particular primary rules may specify the consequences of their breach - an idea conveyed by the articles through the recognition of ''[[lex specialis]]''. [[Gaetano Arangio-Ruiz]], special rapporteur from 1988, helped clarify the consequences of breaches of international obligations. Over the next eight years, the ILC completed its first reading of parts 2 and 3.

In 1995, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] adopted a resolution in effect pressing the Commission to make progress on the state responsibility articles and other long-pending projects.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/res/50/45 GA Res. 50/45], para. 3 (Dec. 11, 1995).&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Crawford (jurist)|James Crawford]] of [[Australia]], appointed as special rapporteur in 1996, approached the task pragmatically. The ILC moved rapidly through a second reading of the draft articles, adopting what it could agree on and jettisoning the rest, most notable of which was Article 19 on [[state crime]]s and the section on dispute settlement.

==Draft Articles==
The final text of the Draft Articles was adopted by the ILC in August 2001, bringing to completion one of the Commission's longest running and most controversial studies. On 12 December 2001, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] adopted [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 56/83|resolution 56/83]], which "commended [the articles] to the attention of Governments without prejudice to the question of their future adoption or other appropriate action."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/res/56/83 GA Res. 56/83], para. 3 (Dec. 12, 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

Crawford notes that the rules are "rigorously general in character,"&lt;ref&gt;James Crawford, ''The International Law Commission's Articles on State Responsibility: Introduction, Text and Commentaries'' (Cambridge University Press, 2002) at 12.&lt;/ref&gt; encompassing all types of international obligations.

=== Internationally wrongful acts ===
According to the ''Draft Articles'', an internationally wrongful act must:
*be attributable to the state under international law; and
*constitute a breach of an international obligation of the state.&lt;ref&gt;Note 1, Article 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

===International crimes===

Earlier drafts of the Articles on State Responsibility contained Article 19, which provided for "[[state crime]]s".&lt;ref name="1991 Report"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=mOIUawoFRzsC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=International%20Law%20Commission's%20Draft%20Articles%20on%20State%20Responsibility&amp;pg=PR4#v=onepage&amp;q=International%20Law%20Commission's%20Draft%20Articles%20on%20State%20Responsibility&amp;f=false], International Law Commission's Draft Articles on State Responsibility, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; Article 19 included the following provisions:

''2. An internationally wrongful act which results from the breach by a State of an international obligation so essential for the protection of fundamental interests of the international community that its breach is recognized as a crime by that community as a whole constitutes an international crime.''

''3. Subject to Paragraph 2, and on the basis of the rules of international law in force, an international crime may result,'' inter alia, ''from:''

''(a) a serious breach of an international obligation of essential importance for the maintenance of international peace and security, such as that prohibiting aggression;''

''(b) a serious breach of an international obligation of essential importance for safeguarding the right of self-determination of peoples, such as that prohibiting the establishment or maintenance by force of colonial domination;''

''(c) a serious breach on a widespread scale of an international obligation of essential importance for safeguarding the human being, such as those prohibiting slavery, genocide and apartheid;''

''(d) a serious breach of an international obligation of essential importance for the safeguarding and preservation of the human environment, such as those prohibiting massive pollution of the atmosphere or of the seas.''

''4. Any internationally wrongful act which is not an international crime in accordance with paragraph 2 constitutes an international delict.''&lt;ref name="1991 Report" /&gt;

Article 19 was deleted from the final Draft Articles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.refworld.org/pdfid/3ddb8f804.pdf], International Law Commission's Articles on Responsibility of States for internationally wrongful acts, as adopted 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Attribution ===
Before a state can be held responsible for any action, it is necessary to prove a causal connection between the injury and an official act or omission attributable to the state alleged to be in breach of its obligations. This has become an increasingly significant contemporary issue, as non-state actors such as [[Al Qaeda]], [[multinational corporation]]s, and [[non-governmental organisation]]s play greater international roles, and as governments [[Privatization|privatise]] some traditional functions.

The state is responsible for all actions of its officials and organs, even if the organ or official is formally independent&lt;ref&gt;Note 1, Art 5.&lt;/ref&gt; and even if the organ or official is acting ''[[ultra vires]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Note 1, Art 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Persons or entities not classified as organs of the State may still be imputable, when they are otherwise empowered to exercise elements of governmental authority, and act in that capacity in the particular instance. Persons or entities not performing public functions may equally be imputable, if they in fact acted under the direction or control of the State.&lt;ref&gt;Note 1, Art 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Where there is a breakdown of normal governmental authority and control, such as in so-called "[[failed states]]", the actions of those acting as the "government" in a [[de facto]] sense will be acts of the state.&lt;ref&gt;Note 1, Art 9.&lt;/ref&gt; The acts of an "insurrectional or other movement that becomes the new government of an existing state or succeeds in establishing a new state" can also be attributed to the state.&lt;ref&gt;Note 1, Art 10. See further Liesbeth Zegveld, ''The Accountability of Armed Opposition Groups in International Law'' (Cambridge University Press, 2002).&lt;/ref&gt; This is also the case where a state acknowledges and adopts the conduct of private persons as its own.&lt;ref&gt;Note 1, Article 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite their apparent concreteness, the standards stated in some rules involve important ambiguities, and their application will often require significant fact-finding and judgment. Most rules state responsibility involving private acts already arise under primary rules. For example, environmental and human rights agreements require states to prevent abuses by private parties.

=== Defences ===
If the general elements to establish state responsibility are established, the question arises as to whether any [[Defense (legal)|defences]] may be available to the respondent state.

These include ''force majeure'' (Article 23), distress (Article 24), state of necessity (Article 25) and counter measures (Articles 49-52), self-defence (article 21) and consent (article 20).

=== Consequences of breach ===
The breach of an international obligation entails two types of legal consequences. Firstly, it creates new obligations for the breaching state, principally, duties of cessation and non-repetition (Article 30), and a duty to make full reparation (Article 31). Article 33(1) characterises these secondary obligations as being owed to other states or to the [[international community]] as a whole. Articles indirectly acknowledges in a [[savings clause]] also that states may owe secondary obligations to non-state actors such as individuals or international organisations.

Second, the articles create new rights for injured states, principally, the right to invoke responsibility (Articles 42 and 48) and a limited right to take countermeasures (Articles 49-53). These rights, however, are heavily state-centred and do not deal with how state responsibility is to be implemented if the holder of the right is an individual or an organisation. The principal element of progressive development in this area is Article 48, which provides that certain violations of international obligations can affect the international community as a whole such that state responsibility can be invoked by states on behalf of the larger community. This provision picks up on the ICJ's celebrated suggestion in ''[[Barcelona Traction]]'' that some obligations are owed ''[[erga omnes]]'', toward the international community as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;''Barcelona Traction, Light &amp; Power Co. (Belgium v. Spain)'', New Application, 1970 ICJ Reports 4, 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reparation === 
If illegal actions are continuing, the state has a duty to cease.&lt;ref&gt;Note 1, Art 30.&lt;/ref&gt; The state also has duties to make [[reparation (legal)|reparation]], which could involve [[restitution]], [[Damages|compensation]], or [[Satisfaction (law)|satisfaction]]. Remedies will be dependent on the particular forum, such as the [[United Nations]], [[International Court of Justice]], [[World Trade Organization]], [[International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea]], [[International Criminal Court]], and on the purpose of reparation.&lt;ref&gt;Hardman Reis, T., ''Compensation for Environmental Damages under International Law'', Kluwer Law International, The Hague, 2011, {{ISBN|978-90-411-3437-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Taoist philosophy''' ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: 道家; [[pinyin]]: ''dàojiā''; lit. "school or family of the Tao") also known as '''Taology''' ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: 道學; [[pinyin]]: ''dàoxué''; lit. "learning of the Tao") refers to the various philosophical currents of [[Taoism]], a tradition of [[China|Chinese]] origin which emphasizes living in harmony with the ''[[Tao]]'' ({{zh|c={{linktext|道}}|p=Dào|l=the Way}}, [[Taoism#Spelling and pronunciation|also romanized as ''Dao'']]). The ''Tao'' is a mysterious and deep principle that is the source, pattern and substance of the entire universe.&lt;ref name="Pollard; Rosenberg; Tignor 2011 164"&gt;{{Cite book | title = Worlds Together Worlds Apart | last = Pollard; Rosenberg; Tignor | first = Elizabeth; Clifford; Robert | publisher = Norton | year = 2011 | isbn = 9780393918472 | location = New York, New York | page = 164}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Creel, What Is Taoism?, 2&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout its history, Taoist philosophy has emphasized concepts like ''[[wu wei]]'' (effortless action), ''[[ziran]]'' ("naturalness"), [[Yin and yang|yin and yang]], [[Qi|''Ch'i'']] ("life energy")'','' ''Wu'' (non-being), and personal cultivation through [[Daoist meditation|meditation]] and other spiritual practices. Taoism differs from Confucianism in putting more emphasis on physical and spiritual cultivation and less emphasis on political organization.

Since the initial stages of Taoist thought, there have been varying schools of Taoist philosophy and they have drawn from and interacted with other philosophical traditions such as Confucianism and Buddhism. While scholars have sometimes attempted to separate "Taoist philosophy" from "Taoist religion", there was never really such a separation. Taoist texts and the literati and [[Taoist priest]]s that wrote and commented on them never made the distinction between "religious" and "philosophical" ideas, particularly those related to metaphysics and ethics.&lt;ref&gt;"Daoist Philosophy," by Ronnie Littlejohn, The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, ISSN 2161-0002, &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.iep.utm.edu/&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, Chad, "Daoism", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Spring 2017 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = &lt;&lt;nowiki&gt;https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2017/entries/daoism/&lt;/nowiki&gt;&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

The major texts of this loose philosophical tradition are traditionally seen as the [[Tao Te Ching]], and the [[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]], though it was only during the [[Han Dynasty]] that they were grouped together under the label "Taoist" (''Daojia'').&lt;ref&gt;Chad Hansen. [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/taoism/ "Taoism"]. ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''. Metaphysics Research Lab, CSLI, [[Stanford University]]. Retrieved 2008-10-01.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[I Ching]] was also later linked to this tradition by scholars like [[Wang Bi]].&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, Chad, "Daoism", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Spring 2017 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = &lt;&lt;nowiki&gt;https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2017/entries/daoism/&lt;/nowiki&gt;&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early sources==
[[File:Birth Places of Chinese Philosophers.png|350px|thumb|Birth places of notable Chinese philosophers from Hundred Schools of Thought in Zhou Dynasty.]]
Compared to other philosophical traditions, Taoist philosophy is quite [[Homogeneity and heterogeneity|heterogeneous]]. According to Russell Kirkland, "Taoists did not generally regard themselves as followers of a single religious community that shared a single set of teachings, or practices."&lt;ref&gt;Kirkland, 2004, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of drawing on a single book or the works of one founding teacher, Taoism developed out a widely diverse set of Chinese beliefs and texts, that over time were gathered together into various synthetic traditions. These texts had some things in common, especially ideas about personal cultivation and integration with what they saw as the deep realities of life.&lt;ref&gt;Kirkland, 2004, p 74&lt;/ref&gt;

The first group consciously identifying itself as "Taoist" (''dàojiào'') appeared and began to collect texts during the fifth century CE.&lt;ref&gt;Kirkland, 2004, p.16&lt;/ref&gt; Their collection of Taoist texts did not initially include classics typically considered to be "Taoist" like the [[Tao Te Ching]] and the [[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]]. Only after a later expansion of the canon did these texts become included.&lt;ref&gt;Kirkland, 2004, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

The legend of the "person" [[Laozi]] was developed during the [[Han dynasty]] and has no historical validity.&lt;ref&gt;Kirkland, 2004, p 18&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise the labels Taoism and Confucianism were developed during the Han dynasty by scholars to group together various thinkers, and texts of the past and categorize them as "Taoist", even though they are quite diverse and their authors may never have known of each other.&lt;ref&gt;Kirkland, 2004, p 75.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, while there was never a coherent "school" of "classical Taoism" during the pre-Han eras, later self identified Taoists (c. 500 CE) were influenced by streams of thought, practices and frameworks inherited from the period of the [[Hundred Schools of Thought|hundred schools of thought]] (6th century to 221 BC).&lt;ref&gt;Kirkland, 2004, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; According to Russell Kirkland, these independent influences include:&lt;ref&gt;Kirkland, 2004, p. 23 - 33&lt;/ref&gt;

* Several divergent [[Confucianism|Confucian]] schools and their ideas of personal development and Tao. 
* Several “[[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalist]]” theorists, such as [[Shen Buhai|Shen Pu-hai]], who spoke of Tao and wu wei and [[Han Fei]], whose work explicates some parts of the [[Tao Te Ching]]
* The murky groups who produced the ideas of [[yin and yang]] and the “[[Wu Xing|Five Forces]]” (wu-hsing).
* Ideas associated with official practitioners of [[divination]] and the [[I Ching|I-Ching]]
* Early versions of independent texts like the [[Neiye|Nei-yeh]], the [[Lüshi Chunqiu]], the [[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]], and the [[Tao Te Ching]].

=== Ideas in Taoist "classics" ===
[[File:Bagua Zhao Huiqian.jpg|thumb|250px|''Bagua'' diagram from Zhao Huiqian's (趙撝謙) ''Liushu benyi'' (六書本義, 1370s).]]
The [[Tao Te Ching]] (also known as the Laozi, [[Terminus ante|terminus ante quem]] third century BCE) has traditionally been seen as the central and founding Taoist text, though historically, it is only one of the many different influences on Taoist thought, and at times, a marginal one at that.&lt;ref&gt;Kirkland, 2004, p. 53, 67.&lt;/ref&gt; The Laozi changed and developed over time possibly from a tradition of oral sayings, and is a loose collection of aphorisms on various topics which seek to give the reader wise advice on how to live, govern and also includes some metaphysical speculations.&lt;ref&gt;Kirkland, 2004, p. 58-59, 63&lt;/ref&gt; The Laozi commonly mentions the idea of a subtle universal force or cosmic creative power called Tao (literally "way" or "road"), using feminine and maternal imagery to describe it.&lt;ref&gt;Kirkland, 2004 p 63&lt;/ref&gt; Tao is the natural spontaneous way that things arise and exist, it is the "organic order" of the universe. The Laozi states that the true Tao cannot be captured by language (cannot be named).&lt;ref&gt;"Daoist Philosophy," by Ronnie Littlejohn, The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, ISSN 2161-0002, &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.iep.utm.edu/&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Laozi also mentions the concept of [[wu wei]] (effortless or non-forceful action), which is illustrated with water analogies (going with the flow of the river instead of against) and "encompasses shrewd tactics—among them “feminine wiles”— which one may utilize to achieve success".&lt;ref&gt;Kirkland, 2004 p 59&lt;/ref&gt; Wu wei is associated with yielding, minimal action and softness. Wu wei is the activity of the ideal sage (''sheng ren''), who spontaneously and effortlessly express Te (virtue), acting as one with the universal forces of the Tao, resembling children or un-carved wood ([[Pu (Daoism)|pu]]).&lt;ref&gt;"Daoist Philosophy," by Ronnie Littlejohn, The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, ISSN 2161-0002, &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.iep.utm.edu/&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; They concentrate their internal energies, are humble, pliable and content and move naturally without being restricted by the structures of society and culture.&lt;ref&gt;"Daoist Philosophy," by Ronnie Littlejohn, The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, ISSN 2161-0002, &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.iep.utm.edu/&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; The Laozi also provides advice for rulers, such as never standing out, keeping weapons but not using them, keeping the people simple and ignorant and working in subtle unseen ways instead of forceful ones.&lt;ref&gt;"Daoist Philosophy," by Ronnie Littlejohn, The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, ISSN 2161-0002, &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.iep.utm.edu/&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; It has generally been seen as promoting [[minimal government]].

Like the Tao Te Ching, the lesser known [[Neiye|Nei-yeh]] (literally: "Inner cultivation") is another short wisdom sayings text but with a different focus. The [[Neiye|Nei-yeh]] is an important early textual source for Taoist personal cultivation of the [[Xin (concept)|heartmind]] (''hsiu-hsin''), which advocated the cultivation and refinement of [[Qi|ch’i]] (“life-energy”), ching (“vital essence”), and shen (“spirit”).&lt;ref&gt;Kirkland, 2004 p 41-42&lt;/ref&gt; The Nei-yeh's idea of a pervasive and unseen "vital force or energy" called ch'i and its relationship to acquiring Te (virtue or inner power) was very influential for later Taoist philosophy. Similarly, important Taoist ideas such as the relationship between a person’s ''hsing'' (“inner nature”) and their ''ming'' (“life-realities”) can be found in another lesser known text called the [[Lüshi Chunqiu]].&lt;ref&gt;Kirkland, 2004 p 41&lt;/ref&gt; In these texts, as well as in the Laozi, a person who acquires Te and has a balanced and tranquil heartmind is called a ''sheng-jen'' (“sage”).&lt;ref&gt;Kirkland, 2004 p 46&lt;/ref&gt; According to Russell Kirkland:  &lt;blockquote&gt;The “heart/mind” is the ruling agency within an individual’s biospiritual nexus, i.e., in the entire personal complex of body/mind/heart/spirit. The Nei-yeh’s principal teaching is that a person should work constantly to ensure that his/her “heart/mind” is balanced and tranquil—without excessive cogitation or emotion. If one maintains a tranquil “heart/ mind,” one will become a receptor of life’s healthful energies, and will be able to retain them and live a long life.&lt;ref&gt;Kirkland, 2004 p 46&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Another text called the [[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]] is also seen as a classic of Taoism though it was also often a marginal work for Chinese Taoists.&lt;ref&gt;Kirkland, 2004, p 68&lt;/ref&gt; It contains various ideas such as the idea that society and morality is a relative cultural construct, and that the sage is not bound by such things and lives, in a sense, beyond them.&lt;ref&gt;Kirkland, 2004, p.37&lt;/ref&gt; The Zhuangzi's vision for becoming a sage requires one to empty oneself of conventional social values and cultural ideas and to cultivate [[wu wei]].&lt;ref&gt;"Daoist Philosophy," by Ronnie Littlejohn, The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, ISSN 2161-0002, &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.iep.utm.edu/&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars see [[Primitivism|primitivist]] ideas in the Zhuangzi, advocating a return to simpler forms of life.&lt;ref&gt;Kohn, Livia. Introducing Daoism, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Kirkland what these three texts have in common is the idea that "one can live one’s life wisely only if one learns how to live in accord with life’s unseen forces and subtle processes, not on the basis of society’s more prosaic concerns".&lt;ref&gt;Kirkland, 2004, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; These subtle forces include ch'i, Tao, and shen (spirit).

Later Taoists incorporated concepts from the I Ching, like Tian (heaven). According to Livia Kohn, Tian is "a process, an abstract representation of the cycles and patterns of nature, a nonhuman force that interacted closely with the human world in a nonpersonal way."&lt;ref&gt;Kohn, Livia. Introducing Daoism, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

== Han and Jin Dynasties ==
The term ''Daojia'' (usually translated as "philosophical Taoism") was coined during the [[Han Dynasty]] (206 BCE–220 CE) by scholars and bibliographers to refer to a grouping of classic texts like the Tao Te Ching and the Zhuangzi.&lt;ref&gt;Chad Hansen. [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/taoism/ "Taoism"]. ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''. Metaphysics Research Lab, CSLI, [[Stanford University]]. Retrieved 2008-10-01.&lt;/ref&gt; Though there were no self termed "Taoists" during the Han dynasty, ideas which were later important to "Taoists" can be seen in Han texts such as the ''[[Huainanzi]]'' and the ''[[Taipingjing]]''. According to the ''Taipingjing'' (Scripture of Grand Tranquility) for example, the ideal ruler maintains an "air" (''ch'i'') of grand tranquility (''t'ai-p'ing'') through the practice of [[wu wei]], meditation, longevity practices such as breath control and medicinal practices like acupuncture.&lt;ref&gt;Kirkland, 2004, p.80.&lt;/ref&gt; There also commentaries written on the classics, the earliest commentary on the ''Dao De Jing'' is that of [[Heshang Gong]] (the "Riverside Master").&lt;ref&gt;Kohn, Livia, ed. ''Daoism Handbook''. p. 6. (Leiden: Brill, 2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

Another influence to the development of later Taoism was ''[[Huang–Lao|Huáng-Lǎo]]'' (literally: "Yellow [Emperor] Old [Master]"), one of the most influential [[Hundred Schools of Thought|Chinese school of thought]] in the early [[Han dynasty]] (2nd-century BCE).&lt;ref&gt;HUANG-LAO IDEOLOGY, Indiana University, History G380 – class text readings – Spring 2010 – R. Eno, http://www.indiana.edu/~g380/4.8-Huang-Lao-2010.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It was a syncretist philosophy which brought together texts and elements from many schools. Huang–Lao philosophy was favored at the [[Western Han]], before the reign of [[Emperor Wu of Han|Emperor Wu]] (r. 141–87 BCE) who made [[Confucianism]] the official state philosophy. These intellectual currents helped inspire several new social movements such as the [[Way of the Celestial Masters]] which would later influence Taoist thought.

The fourth century saw major developments such as the rise of new spiritual traditions like the [[Shangqing School|Shangqing]] ("Supreme Clarity") and [[Lingbao School|Lingbao]] ("Numinous Treasure") with new scriptures and practices such as alchemy and visualization meditations as a way of moral and spiritual refinement.&lt;ref&gt;Kirkland, 2004, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; It was the Lingbao school who also developed the ideas of a great cosmic deity as a personification of the Tao and a heavenly order with Mahayana Buddhist influences.&lt;ref&gt;Kirkland, 2004, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; The Shangqing school is the beginning of the Taoist tradition known as “inner alchemy” (''[[neidan]]''), a form of physical and spiritual self cultivation.&lt;ref&gt;"Daoist Philosophy," by Ronnie Littlejohn, The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, ISSN 2161-0002, &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.iep.utm.edu/&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was in the later fifth century that an aristocratic scholar called [[Lu Xiujing]] (406-477) drew on all these disparate influences to shape and produce a common set of beliefs, texts and practices for what he called "the teachings of the Tao” (Tao-chiao).&lt;ref&gt;Kirkland, 2004, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt; In the north, another influential figure, [[Kou Qianzhi]] (365–448), reformed the celestial master school, producing a new ethical code.

=== Xuanxue ===
[[Xuanxue]] (lit. "mysterious" or "deep" learning, sometimes called Neo-Taoism'')'' was an important [[school of thought]] from the third to sixth century CE. Xuanxue philosophers combined elements of [[Confucianism]] and [[Taoism]] to reinterpret the ''[[Yijing]],'' ''[[Daodejing]],'' and ''[[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]].'' Influential Xuanxue scholars include [[Wang Bi]] (226-249), [[He Yan]] (d. 249), [[Xiang Xiu]] (223?-300, part of the famous intellectual group known as the [[Seven Sages of the Bamboo Grove]]), [[Guo Xiang]] (d. 312), and Pei Wei (267-300).&lt;ref&gt;"Daoist Philosophy," by Ronnie Littlejohn, The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, ISSN 2161-0002, &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.iep.utm.edu/&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Thinkers like He Yan and Wang Bi are set forth the theory that everything, including [[yin and yang]] and the virtue of the sage, “have their roots" in ''wu'' (nothingness, negativity, not-being).&lt;ref&gt;Chan, Alan, "Neo-Daoism", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Spring 2017 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = &lt;&lt;nowiki&gt;https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2017/entries/neo-daoism/&lt;/nowiki&gt;&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; What He Yan seems to mean by ''wu'' can be variously described as formlessness and undifferentiated wholeness. Wu is property-less and yet full and fecund.&lt;ref&gt;Chan, Alan, "Neo-Daoism", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Spring 2017 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = &lt;&lt;nowiki&gt;https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2017/entries/neo-daoism/&lt;/nowiki&gt;&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wang Bi]]'s commentary has traditionally been the most influential philosophical commentary on the Laozi. Like He Yan, Wang Bi focuses on the concept of ''Wu'' (non-being, nothingness) as the nature of the Tao and underlying ground of existence.&lt;ref&gt;Kohn, Livia. Introducing Daoism, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; Wang Bi's view of Wu is that it is indeed ''not being as a necessary basis of being.'' For being to be possible, there must be not-being, and as the Laozi states, “Dao gives birth to [''sheng''] one” and “all things in the world are born of something (''you''); something is born of nothing (''wu'')”. Wang Bi's account focuses on this foundational aspect of not-being.&lt;ref&gt;Chan, Alan, "Neo-Daoism", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Spring 2017 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = &lt;&lt;nowiki&gt;https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2017/entries/neo-daoism/&lt;/nowiki&gt;&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Livia Kohn, for Wang Bi "nonbeing is at the root of all and needs to be activated in a return to emptiness and spontaneity, achieved through the practice of nonaction, a decrease in desires and growth of humility and tranquility".&lt;ref&gt;Kohn, Livia. Introducing Daoism, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; Another critical concept for Xuanxue philosopher is [[ziran]] (lit. "self-so", naturalness, spontaneity).&lt;ref&gt;Chan, Alan, "Neo-Daoism", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Spring 2017 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = &lt;&lt;nowiki&gt;https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2017/entries/neo-daoism/&lt;/nowiki&gt;&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Guo Xiang]] is also another influential Xuanxue thinker. In his commentary to the [[Zhuangzi (book)|Zhuangzi]], he rejected that ''wu'' was the source of the generation of beings, instead arguing for spontaneous “self-production” (''zi sheng'') and “self-transformation” (''zi hua'' or ''du hua''):&lt;blockquote&gt;“Because ''wu'' [by definition] is not being, it cannot produce being. Prior to the coming to be of being, it cannot produce other beings. In that case, then, who or what brought about the birth of being? [The answer can only be that] beings are spontaneously self-generated”&lt;ref&gt;Chan, Alan, "Neo-Daoism", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Spring 2017 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = &lt;&lt;nowiki&gt;https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2017/entries/neo-daoism/&lt;/nowiki&gt;&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Another key figure, Taoist alchemist [[Ge Hong]] (c. 283–343) was an aristocrat and government official during the [[Jin dynasty (265–420)|Jin Dynasty]]  who wrote the classic known as the [[Baopuzi]] ("Master Embracing Simplicity"), a key Taoist philosophical work of this period.&lt;ref&gt;"Daoist Philosophy," by Ronnie Littlejohn, The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, ISSN 2161-0002, &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.iep.utm.edu/&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; This text includes Confucian teachings and also spiritual practices meant to aid in attaining immortality and a heavenly state called "great clarity", which had great influence on later Taoism.&lt;ref&gt;Robinet (1997), p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kirkland, 2004, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;

A later Xuanxue thinker, Zhang Zhan (ca. 330–400), is known particularly for his commentary on the [[Liezi]].&lt;ref&gt;Chan, Alan, "Neo-Daoism", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Spring 2017 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = &lt;&lt;nowiki&gt;https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2017/entries/neo-daoism/&lt;/nowiki&gt;&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Northern and Southern dynasties|Northern and Southern Dynasties]] (420–589), ''Xuanxue'' reached the height of influence as it was admitted into the official curriculum of the imperial academy.&lt;ref&gt;Chan, Alan, "Neo-Daoism", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Spring 2017 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = &lt;&lt;nowiki&gt;https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2017/entries/neo-daoism/&lt;/nowiki&gt;&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tang dynasty==
[[File:Sima Chengchen.jpg|thumb|150px|Sima Chengzhen.]]
By [[Tang dynasty]] times (618–907 CE), a common sense of a "Taoist identity" had developed (which Tang leaders called Tao-chiao, "teachings of the Tao"), partly by the efforts of systematizers like Lu Xiujing and also due to the need to compete against Buddhism for imperial patronage.&lt;ref&gt;Kirkland, 2004, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; This synthetic system is sometimes called the Three Caverns. They collected the first Taoist canon, often called the San-tung (“The Three Arcana”), which did not originally include the [[Tao Te Ching]].&lt;ref&gt;Kirkland, 2004, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; Taoism also gained official status in China during the [[Tang dynasty|Tang Dynasty]], whose emperors claimed Laozi as their relative.&lt;ref&gt;Robinet (1997), p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Emperor Gaozong of Tang|Gaozong Emperor]] even added the ''Tao Te Ching'' to the list of classics (''jing,'' 經) to be studied for the imperial examinations.&lt;ref&gt;Robinet, Isabelle. ''Taoism: Growth of a Religion''. p. 185.  (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1997 [original French 1992]). {{ISBN|0-8047-2839-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This was the height of Taoist influence in Chinese history.

[[Sima Chengzhen]] (647—735) is an important intellectual figure of this period. He is especially known for blending Taoist, and Buddhist theories and forms of mental cultivation in the Taoist meditation text called the ''[[Zuowanglun]].'' He also served as an adviser to the Tang government.&lt;ref&gt;Kirkland, 2004, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt; He was later retroactively appropriated as a patriarch of the Quanzhen school.&lt;ref&gt;Kirkland, 2004, p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another key Taoist writer and thinker of this period is [[Du Guangting]] (850—933), he produced an influential commentary on the Tao Te Ching as well as numerous expositions of other scriptures and histories. Likewise, Taoist master Ch’eng Hsüan-ying (fl. 631-652) wrote an influential commentaries on the Laozi and Zhuangzi.

==Post Tang==
The [[Song dynasty]] (960–1279) era saw the foundation of the [[Quanzhen]] (Complete perfection or Integrating perfection) school of Taoism during the 12th century among followers of [[Wang Chongyang]] (1113–1170), a scholar who wrote various collections of poetry and texts on living a Taoist life who taught that "spiritural immortality” (shen-hsien) can be attained within this life by entering seclusion, cultivating one’s internal spiritual realities (hsing), and harmonizing them with the realities of one’s external life (ming)."&lt;ref&gt;Kirkland, 2004, p. 106&lt;/ref&gt; The Quanzhen school was syncretic, combining elements from Buddhism (such as monasticism) and Confucianism with past Taoist traditions.&lt;ref&gt;"Daoist Philosophy," by Ronnie Littlejohn, The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, ISSN 2161-0002, &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.iep.utm.edu/&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Neidan]]'', a form of [[internal alchemy]], became a major emphasis of the Quanzhen sect. Wang Chongyang taught that the "three teachings" (Buddhism, Confucianism, Taoism), "when investigated, prove to be but one school." He taught that, by mental training and [[asceticism]] through which one reaches a state of no-mind (''Wu Xin'' 無心) and no-thoughts, attached to nothing, one can recover the primordial, deathless "Radiant Spirit" or "Real Nature" (''yangshen/zhenxing'').&lt;ref&gt;Eskildsen, Stephen. The Teachings and Practices of the Early Quanzhen Taoist Masters, SUNY series in Chinese Philosophy and Culture. p. 21, 31 ( “You simply must be of no mind and no thoughts. Do not become attached to anything. Clearly, serenely, be free of affairs within and without. This is what it means to see your [Real] Nature.”)&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Stephen Eskildsen, Wang Chongyang appears to have been familiar with and influenced by [[Mahayana]] Buddhist texts like the Diamond sutra as well as Chan texts, however:&lt;blockquote&gt;Wang Zhe did not abide by the thoroughgoing negation and non-assertion of Mahayana Buddhist philosophy. Fond as he was of borrowing Buddhist language to preach detachment from this provisional, fleeting world of samsara, Wang Zhe ardently believed in the eternal, universal Real Nature/Radiant Spirit that is the ground and wellspring of consciousness (spirit [shen], Nature [xing]), and vitality (qi, Life [ming]) within all living beings. This to him was not “empty” (lacking inherent existence); it was fully Real (zhen).&lt;ref&gt;Eskildsen, Stephen. The Teachings and Practices of the Early Quanzhen Taoist Masters, SUNY series in Chinese Philosophy and Culture. p. 6-7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;One Quanzhen master, [[Qiu Chuji]], became a teacher of [[Genghis Khan]] before the establishment of the [[Yuan Dynasty]]. Originally from [[Shanxi]] and [[Shandong]], the sect established its main center in [[Beijing]]'s [[White Cloud Temple|Baiyunguan]] ("White Cloud Monastery").&lt;ref&gt;Robinet (1997), p. 223-224.&lt;/ref&gt; Several Song emperors, most notably [[Emperor Huizong (Song Dynasty)|Huizong]], were active in promoting Taoism, collecting Taoist texts and publishing editions of the ''[[Daozang]].'' [[File:Huxisanxiaotu.jpg|thumb|300px|''[[Confucianism]], Taoism, and [[Buddhism]] are one'', a painting in the ''litang style'' portraying three men laughing by a river stream, 12th century, [[Song dynasty]].]]
The [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]] and [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] government meanwhile often attempted to control and regulate Taoism. Taoism suffered a significant setback during the reign of [[Kublai Khan|Khubilai Khan]] when many copies of the ''Daozang'' were ordered burned in 1281.&lt;ref&gt;"Daoist Philosophy," by Ronnie Littlejohn, The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, ISSN 2161-0002, &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.iep.utm.edu/&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; This destruction gave Taoism a chance to renew itself.&lt;ref&gt;Schipper and Verellen (2004), p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese Taoists during the 12-14th centuries engaged in a revaluation of their tradition, dubbed by some a "reformation", which focused on individual cultivation.&lt;ref&gt;Kirkland, 2004, p.98.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Ming dynasty]] (1368–1644), the state promoted the notion that “the Three Teachings (Confucianism, Buddhism, and Taoism) are one”, an idea which was over time became popular consensus.&lt;ref&gt;Kirkland, 2004, p. 107, 120&lt;/ref&gt; The current Taoist textual canon, called the [[Daozang]], was compiled during the [[Ming dynasty|Ming Dynasty]] (1368–1644).&lt;ref&gt;Kirkland, 2004, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, during the Ming dynasty, Taoist ideas also influenced Neo-Confucian thinkers like [[Wang Yangming]] and [[Zhan Ruoshui]].&lt;ref&gt;Kohn, Livia. Introducing Daoism, p. 178&lt;/ref&gt;

==Qing dynasty and modern China==

The late Ming and early [[Qing dynasty]] saw the rise of the [[Longmen Taoism|Longmen]] (Dragon Gate 龍門) school of Taoism, founded by Wang Kunyang (d. 1680) which reinvigorated the Quanzhen tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Monica Esposito (2001) Longmen Taoism in Qing China: Doctrinal Ideal and Local Reality, Journal of Chinese Religions, 29:1, 191-231, DOI: 10.1179/073776901804774604&lt;/ref&gt; Longmen Taoist writers such as [[Liu Yiming]] (1734–1821) also simplified Taoist “Inner Alchemy” practices making more accessible to the public by removing much of the esoteric symbolism of medieval texts.&lt;ref&gt;Kirkland, 2004, p. 112&lt;/ref&gt; It was Min Yide (1758-1836) though that became the most influential figure of the Longmen lineage, as he was the main compiler of the Longmen ''[[Daozang]] xubian'' and doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;Monica Esposito (2001) Longmen Taoism in Qing China: Doctrinal Ideal and Local Reality, Journal of Chinese Religions, 29:1, 191-231, DOI: 10.1179/073776901804774604&lt;/ref&gt; It was Min Yide who also made the famous text known as The [[The Secret of the Golden Flower|Secret of the Golden Flower]] along with its emphasis on internal alchemy, the central doctrinal scripture of the Longmen tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Monica Esposito (2001) Longmen Taoism in Qing China: Doctrinal Ideal and Local Reality, Journal of Chinese Religions, 29:1, 191-231, DOI: 10.1179/073776901804774604&lt;/ref&gt;

The fall of the [[Ming dynasty|Ming Dynasty]] was blamed by some Chinese literati on Taoist influences and therefore they sought to return to a pure form of Han Confucianism during a movement called ''Hanxue'', or "[[Han Learning]]" which excluded Taoism.&lt;ref&gt;Schipper (1993), p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; The study and practice of Taoist philosophy saw a steep decline in the more tumultuous times of the later Qing dynasty. By the beginning of the twentieth century, Taoism had declined considerably, and only one complete copy of the ''[[Daozang]]'' still remained, at the White Cloud Monastery in Beijing.&lt;ref&gt;Schipper (1993), p. 220.&lt;/ref&gt;

Taoism continued to decline during the [[Guomindang]] (Chinese Nationalist Party), who saw religions as parasitic and reactionary and confiscated temples.&lt;ref&gt;Schipper (1993), p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Taoist decline was accelerated after the rise of the [[Communist Party of China]]. During the [[Cultural Revolution]] from 1966 to 1976, many Taoist temples and sites were damaged and taoist clergy were sent to labor camps.&lt;ref name="Dean 1993, p. 41"&gt;Dean (1993), p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;

Persecution of Taoists stopped in 1979, and many Taoists began reviving their traditions.&lt;ref name="Dean 1993, p. 41"&gt;Dean (1993), p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, many temples and monasteries have been repaired and reopened. Taoism is one of five religions recognized by the PRC, which regulates its activities through the China Taoist Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.hrwf.net/advocacy/ext/religious_freedom_china.pdf |title= Human Rights Without Frontiers "Religious Freedom in China in 2006" |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090327075017/http://www.hrwf.net/advocacy/ext/religious_freedom_china.pdf |archivedate= 2009-03-27 |df=  }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(30.6&amp;nbsp;KB)}} An address given to the Delegation EU-China of the European Parliament.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Teodor Ilyich Oizerman''' ({{lang-ru|Теодо́р Ильи́ч Ойзерма́н}}; {{OldStyleDate|14 May|1914|1 May}} &amp;ndash; 25 March 2017) was a Soviet and Russian philosopher and academician.&lt;ref&gt;http://dic.academic.ru/dic.nsf/enc_biography/94770/Ойзерман, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

Oizerman was born in [[Petrovirivka|Petroverovka]] village, [[Tiraspol]] [[uyezd]], [[Kherson Governorate]], [[Russian Empire]], into a [[Jew]]ish family. His parents were teachers.  During [[World War II]] he served in the [[Red Army]].

Oizerman was a member of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] from 1981 until his death.  He received a doctorate, ''honoris causa'', from the [[University of Jena]] in 1979 and the [[USSR State Prize]] in 1983. In 1979 Oizerman was awarded the [[Georgi Plekhanov|Plekhanov]] prize for the monograph ''The main Trends in Philosophy''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ras.ru/about/awards/awdlist.aspx?awdid=143 The Plekhanov prize] {{Ru icon}} &lt;br /&gt; The first edition of this book was out in 1971. The second edition published in 1984 was translated into English in 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; He also served in the [[Anti-Zionist Committee of the Soviet Public]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ISBN|3-7186-5740-6}} ''Russian Antisemitism, Pamyat and the Demonology of Zionism (Studies in Antisemitism)'' by William Korey&lt;/ref&gt;

Politically, following the 1991 break-up of the Soviet Union Oizerman moved towards [[social democratic]], anti-[[Leninist]] positions, as per regarding Lenin's interpretation and application of the ideas of [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]] in the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution]] as incorrect, and leading Russian history towards [[oligarchy]] rather than the victorious establishment of the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]].&lt;ref&gt;Luther, Sara Fletcher, John J.

Westport, Ct.: Greenwood Publishing Group, 1995. {{ISBN|0-313-29396-1}}, {{ISBN|978-0-313-29396-2}}. P. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Oizerman died on 25 March 2017 in Moscow at the age of 102.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gorky.media/news/skonchalsya-filosof-teodor-ojzerman/|title=Скончался философ Теодор Ойзерман|publisher=gorky.media|author=Staff|date=2017-03-25|accessdate=2017-03-25|language=russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Social Contract''''', originally published as '''''On the Social Contract; or, Principles of Political Rights''''' ({{lang-fr|Du contrat social; ou Principes du droit politique}}) by [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], is a 1762 book in which Rousseau theorized about the best way to establish a political [[community]] in the face of the problems of commercial society, which he had already identified in his ''[[Discourse on Inequality]]'' (1754).

''The Social Contract'' helped inspire political reforms or revolutions in Europe, especially in France. ''The Social Contract'' argued against the idea that monarchs were divinely empowered to legislate. Rousseau asserts that only the people, who are sovereign, have that all-powerful right.

==Overview==
{{unsourced|section|date=August 2018}}
[[File:Rousseau pirated edition.jpg|thumb|upright|Title page of a pirated edition of the ''Social Contract'', probably printed in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;R.A. Leigh, ''Unsolved Problems in the Bibliography of J.-J. Rousseau'' (Cambridge, 1990), plate 22.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The [[epigraph (literature)|epigraph]] of the work is "foederis aequas / Dicamus leges" ([[Virgil]], ''[[Aeneid]]'' XI.321–22). The stated aim of ''The Social Contract'' is to determine whether there can be a legitimate political authority, since people's interactions he saw at his time seemed to put them in a state far worse than the good one they were at in the [[state of nature]], even though living in isolation.  He concludes book one, chapter three with, "Let us then admit that force does not create right, and that we are obliged to obey only legitimate powers", which is to say, the ability to coerce is not a legitimate power, and there is no rightful duty to submit to it.  A [[State (polity)|state]] has no right to enslave a conquered people.

In this desired [[social contract]], everyone will be free because they all forfeit the same number of rights and impose the same duties on all. Rousseau argues that it is absurd for a man to surrender his freedom for [[slavery]]; thus, the participants must have a right to choose the laws under which they live. Although the contract imposes new laws, including those safeguarding and regulating [[property]], there are restrictions on how that property can be legitimately claimed.  His example with land includes three conditions; that the land be uninhabited, that the owner claims only what is needed for subsistence, and that labor and cultivation give the possession legitimacy.

Rousseau posits that the political aspects of a society should be divided into two parts. First, there must be a sovereign consisting of the whole population, women included, that represents the [[general will]] and is the legislative power within the state. The second division is that of the [[government]], being distinct from the sovereign. This division is necessary because the sovereign cannot deal with particular matters like applications of the law.  Doing so would undermine its generality, and therefore damage its legitimacy. Thus, government must remain a separate institution from the sovereign body. When the government exceeds the boundaries set in place by the people, it is the mission of the people to abolish such government, and begin anew.

Rousseau claims that the size of the territory to be governed often decides the nature of the government. Since a government is only as strong as the people, and this strength is absolute, the larger the territory, the more strength the government must be able to exert over the populace. In his view, a monarchical government is able to wield the most power over the people since it has to devote less power to itself, while a democracy the least. In general, the larger the [[bureaucracy]], the more power required for government discipline. Normally, this relationship requires the state to be an [[aristocracy]] or [[monarchy]]. When Rousseau uses the word democracy, he refers to a [[direct democracy]] rather than a [[representative democracy]]. In light of the relation between population size and governmental structure, Rousseau argues that, like his native [[Geneva]], small [[city-states]] are the form of nation in which freedom can best flourish. For states of this size, an elected aristocracy is preferable, and in very large states a benevolent monarch; but even monarchical rule, to be legitimate, must be subordinate to the sovereign rule of law.

== Reception ==
{{expand section|date=June 2016}}
The French philosopher [[Voltaire]] used his publications to criticise and mock Rousseau, but also to defend [[Freedom of speech|free expression]]. In his ''[[Idées républicaines]]'' (1765), he reacted to the news that ''The Social Contract'' had been burned in [[Geneva]], saying "The operation of burning it was perhaps as odious as that of writing it. […] To burn a book of argument is to say: 'We do not have enough wit to reply to it.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gay |first1=Peter |title=Voltaire's Politics: The Poet as Realist |date=1959 |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=New Jersey |pages=214–219}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Davidson |first1=Ian |title=Voltaire in Exile |date=2004 |publisher=Atlantic books |isbn=1843540878 |pages=186–187}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work was also banned in [[Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Jean-Jacques Rousseau {{!}} The Core Curriculum|url=https://www.college.columbia.edu/core/content/jean-jacques-rousseau|accessdate=12 April 2017|work=www.college.columbia.edu|publisher=[[Columbia University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work received a refutation called "The Confusion of the Social Contract by Jean-Jacques Rousseau" by the Jesuit [[Alfonso Muzzarelli]] in Italy in 1794.&lt;ref name="O'NeillDomínguez2001"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Charles E.

'''Theory choice''' was a main problem in the [[philosophy of science]] in the early 20th century, and under the impact of the new and controversial theories of [[theory of relativity|relativity]] and [[quantum physics]], came to involve how scientists should choose between competing theories.

The classical answer would be to select the theory which was best verified, against which [[Karl Popper]] argued that competing theories should be subjected to comparative tests and the one chosen which survived the tests. If two theories could not, for practical reasons, be tested one should prefer the one with the highest degree of empirical content, said Popper in ''[[The Logic of Scientific Discovery]]''.

Mathematician and physicist [[Henri Poincaré]] instead, like many others, proposed [[Occam's razor|simplicity]] as a criterion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=2235317|title=Simplicity, Scientific Inference and Econometric Modelling|first1=Hugo A.|last1=Keuzenkamp|first2=Michael|last2=McAleer|date=1 January 1995|publisher=|journal=The Economic Journal|volume=105|issue=428|pages=1–21|doi=10.2307/2235317}}&lt;/ref&gt; One should choose the mathematically simplest or most elegant approach. Many have sympathized with this view, but the problem is that the idea of simplicity is highly intuitive and even personal, and that no one has managed to formulate it in precise and acceptable terms.

Popper's solution was subsequently criticized by [[Thomas S. Kuhn]] in ''[[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions]]''. He denied that competing theories (or [[paradigm]]s) could be compared in the way that Popper had claimed, and substituted instead what can be briefly described as pragmatic success. This led to an intense discussion with [[Imre Lakatos]] and [[Paul Feyerabend]] the best known participants.

The discussion has continued, but no general and uncontroversial solution to the problem of formulating objective criteria to decide which is the best theory has so far been formulated. The main criteria usually proposed are to choose the theory which provides the best (and novel) predictions, the one with the highest explanatory potential, the one which offers better problems or the most elegant and simple one. Alternatively a theory may be preferable if it is better integrated into the rest of contemporary knowledge.

'''Thomas Brown''' {{Postnom|country=UK|FRSE}} (9 January 1778 – 2 April 1820) was a [[Scotland|Scottish]] philosopher and poet.

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
Brown was born at Kirkmabreck, [[Wigtownshire]], the son of Rev. Samuel Brown (d.1779) (minister of Kirkmabreck and Kirkdale) and Mary Smith.

Their son was a wide reader and an eager student. Educated at several schools in [[London]], he went to the [[University of Edinburgh]] in 1792, where he attended [[Dugald Stewart]]'s [[moral philosophy]] class, but does not appear to have completed his course. After studying law for a time he took up medicine; his graduation thesis ''De Somno'' was well received. But his strength lay in [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] analysis.

=== Career ===
Brown set an answer to the objections raised against the appointment of [[John Leslie (physicist)|Sir John Leslie]] to the mathematical professorship (1805). Leslie, a follower of [[David Hume]], was attacked by the clerical party as a sceptic and an infidel, and Brown took the opportunity to defend Hume's doctrine of [[causality]] as in no way inimical to [[religion]].&lt;ref&gt;See

In 1806, Brown became a medical practitioner in partnership with [[James Gregory (physician)|James Gregory]] (1753–1821), but, though successful, preferred literature and philosophy. After twice failing to gain a professorship in the university, he was invited, during an illness of Dugald Stewart in the session of 1808–1809, to act as his substitute, and during the following session he undertook much of Stewart's work. The students received him with enthusiasm, due partly to his splendid [[rhetoric]] and partly to the novelty and ingenuity of his views. In 1810 he was appointed as colleague to Stewart, a position which he held for the rest of his life.  Brown was elected a member of the [[American Antiquarian Society]] in 1815.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.americanantiquarian.org/memberlistb American Antiquarian Society Members Directory]&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote his lectures at high pressure, and devoted much time to the editing and publication of the numerous poems which he had written at various times during his life. He was also preparing an abstract of his lectures as a handbook for his class. His health, never strong, gave way under the strain of his work.

He was advised to take a trip to London, where he died in 1820 aged 42. His body was returned to Kirkmabreck for burial.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Criticism of Darwin ===
One of Brown's notable works included a critique of [[Erasmus Darwin]]'s theory of transmutation. The philosopher published it in the form of a detailed study ''Observations on the zoonomia of Erasmus Darwin'' (1798), which was recognized as a mature work of criticism.&lt;ref&gt;History English Philosophy, ''A History of British Philosophy to 1900''. CUP Archive. p. 209  {{ISBN|1001412796}}; 9781001412795&lt;/ref&gt;

There, Brown wrote:
{{Quote|As the earth, to a considerable depth, abounds with the recrements of organic life, Dr. Darwin adopts the opinion, that it has been generated, rather than created; the original quantity of matter having been continually increased, by the processes of animalization, and vegetation. This production of the causes of effects he considers, as affording a more magnificent idea of the infinite power of the Creator, than if he had simply caused the effects themselves; and, if the inconceivable be the source of the magnificent, the opinion is just. It is contrary, however, to all the observations, which prove the processes of animal, and vegetable growth, to be the result of new combinations of matter, previously existing; and it is also in direct opposition to the opinions, which Dr. Darwin has himself advanced.&lt;br/&gt; A body can increase in bulk, only by the farther separation of its parts, in expansion, or by the accretion of new parts. In the former case, no addition is made to the original quantity of matter; and it will surely be admitted, that nothing can accresce, which does not exist. The parts accreted, existing before their junction with the animal, must have formed a portion of the original matter of the world, or been called into being,, in a new creation, not by the animal, to which they accresce, but by the great fource of animal existence.&lt;br/&gt;The immense beds of limestone, chalk, and marble, may have been, at one time, the shells of fish, and may thus have received a difference of form; but, unless the calcareous earth, of which they are composed, if that earth be a simple body, or its ingredients, if it be compound, had previously existed, all the powers of animation which the ocean contains would have been insufficient to create a single shell...&lt;br/&gt;The process of generation is said to consist in the secretion by the male of a living filament, and by the female of a nutritive fluid, which stimulates the filament, to absorb particles, and thus to add to its bulk: ''At the earliest period of its existence the embryon, as secreted from the blood of the male, would seem to consist of a living filament, with certain capabilities of irritation, sensation, volition and association," p. 484.'' To say, that the filament is living, and that it possesses these powers, is to say, that it possess sensorial power, which is considered by Dr. Darwin, as the source of animation...&lt;br/&gt;Dr. Darwin seems to consider the animals of former times, as possessing powers, much superior to those of their posterity. They reasoned on their wants : they wished : and it was done. The boar, which originally differed little from the other beasts of the forest, first obtained tusks, because he conceived them to be useful weapons, and then, by another process of reasoning, a thick shield-like shoulder, to defend himself from the tusks of his fellows. The stag, in like manner, formed to himself horns, at once sharp, and branched, for the different purposes of offence, and defence. Some animals obtained wings, others fins, and others swiftness of foot; while the vegetables exerted themselves, in inventing various modes of concealing, and defending their feeds, and honey. These are a few of many instances, adduced by Dr. Darwin, which are all objectionable, on his own principles ; as they require us to believe the various propensities, to have been the cause, rather than the effect, of the difference of configuration... &lt;br/&gt;If we admit the supposed capacity of producing organs, by the mere feeling of a want, man must have been greatly degenerated, or been originally inferior, in power. He may \Nash for wings, as the other bipeds are supposed to have done with success ; but a century of wishes will not render him abler to take flight. It is not, however, to man that the observation must be confined. No improvements of form have been observed, in the other animals, since the first dawnings of zoology ; and we must, therefore, believe them, to have lost the power of production, rather than to have attained all the objects of their desire.|Thomas Brown, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZavjKANqnooC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Observations on the Zoonomia of Erasmus Darwin]'', M.D., Edinburgh, 1798, pp. 432–3, 464–7.|}}

Noteworthy, Brown's criticism of the Darwinian thesis, like that of [[Rudolf Virchow]], did not come from any religious feeling.

=== Reception ===
Brown's philosophy occupies an intermediate place between the earlier Scottish school and the later associational psychology, to which he really belonged. Later criticism of Brown's philosophy lessened its popularity, a severe attack being made by [[Sir William Hamilton, 9th Baronet]] in his ''Discussions'' and ''Lectures on Metaphysics''. A high estimate of his merits was shown in [[John Stuart Mill]]'s ''Examination of Hamilton''. Also, in David Welsh's ''Account of the Life and Writings'' (1825) and [[James McCosh]]'s ''Scottish Philosophy''. [[Friedrich Eduard Beneke]], who found in him anticipations of some of his own doctrines.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Die neue Psychologie'', pp.&amp;nbsp;320–330.&lt;/ref&gt;

The philosopher [[Schopenhauer]] wrote of him in 1844:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Quite recently Thomas Brown has taught ... in his extremely tedious book ''Inquiry into the Relation of [[Causality|Cause and Effect]]'' (4th ed., 1835), ... that knowledge springs from an innate, intuitive, and instinctive conviction; he is therefore essentially on the right path. However, the crass ignorance is unpardonable by which, in this book of 476 pages, 130 of which are devoted to the refutation of [[David Hume|Hume]], no mention at all is made of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], who cleared up the matter seventy years ago.|''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', Vol. II, Chapter IV&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In his ''[[On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason]]'', § 20, Schopenhauer claimed that Brown intended to provide support for the [[Cosmological argument|Cosmological Proof of God’s Existence]]. "… sometimes there is an intention…a theological design flirting with the Cosmological Proof…. We find the clearest instance of this in Thomas Browne’s [sic] book, ''On the Relation of Cause and Effect''…this Englishman rightly recognizes, that the causal law has invariably to do with ''changes'', and that every effect is accordingly a ''change''. Yet…he is unwilling to admit that every cause is likewise a ''change'' and that the whole process is therefore nothing but the uninterrupted connection of ''changes'' succeeding one another in time. On the contrary, he persists in clumsily calling the cause an ''object or substance, which precedes the change''…in order that his definition may on no account stand in the way of the Cosmological Proof…."

His friend and biographer, [[David Welsh]] (1793–1845), superintended the publication of Brown's text-book, the ''Physiology of the Human Mind'', and his ''Lectures on the Philosophy of the Human Mind'', which was published by his successors, [[John "Walking" Stewart|John Stewart]] and Edward Milroy. The ''Lectures'' were well received both in England (where it reached a 19th edition)&lt;ref&gt;See {{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the USA.

Among Brown's  poems, which were influenced by [[Alexander Pope]] and [[Mark Akenside|Akenside]] were: ''Paradise of Coquettes'' (1814); ''Wanderer in Norway'' (1815); ''Warfiend'' (1816); ''Bower of Spring'' (1817); ''Agnes'' (1818); ''Emily'' (1819); a collected edition in 4 vols. appeared in 1820. His poetry, though graceful, lacked force, and is now forgotten.

Brown was one of the first contributors to the ''[[Edinburgh Review]]''. In its second number, he published a criticism of [[Immanuel Kant]]'s philosophy, based on [[Auguste Villiers de l'Isle-Adam]]'s account of it.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8445">'''Thomas Talbott''' is Professor Emeritus of Philosophy at [[Willamette University]], [[Salem, Oregon]]. He is best known for his advocacy of [[trinitarian universalism]]. Due to his book ''The Inescapable Love of God'' and other works he is one of the most prominent Protestant voices today supporting the idea of [[universal reconciliation|universal salvation]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} The 2003 book ''Universal Salvation?: The Current Debate'' presents Talbott's "rigorous defense of universalism" together with responses from various fields theologians, philosophers, church historians and other religious scholars supporting or opposing Talbott's universalism.  Talbott contributed the chapter on "Universalism" for ''The Oxford Handbook of Eschatology''.&lt;ref&gt;Edited by Jerry L. Walls. Pp. xviii + 724. New York and Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2008. {{ISBN|978-0-19-517049-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Universalist argument==
Talbott has offered three propositions which many traditional Christians consider are biblically based but Talbott considers can not all be true at the same time:
# God is totally sovereign over human destinies.
# God is entirely loving and wills that all people be reconciled to Him in relationship.
# Most people will experience endless, conscious torment in hell.&lt;ref name="Talbott"&gt;Talbott, Thomas. ''The Inescapable Love of God''.1999.{{ISBN|1-58112-831-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arguments against Talbott's views===
However those objecting to Talbott's view note that there are multiple biblical verses describing [[hell]] as the fate of the wicked. Traditionally;
# [[Arminianism|Arminians]] resolve this by disagreeing with #1. Some people will resist the grace of God and choose a life-path that results in everlasting separation from God.
# [[Calvinism|Calvinists]] resolve this by disagreeing with #2. God graciously elects some to be saved and either passes over the rest in their sin (single predestination) or elects others to be damned (double predestination)—those who are to be everlastingly punished according to the doctrine of [[Predestination (Calvinism)|double predestination]].
# Christians who believe in [[Christian mortalism]] and [[conditional immortality]], for example [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventists]], typically disagree with #3, and propose the doctrine of [[annihilationism]] as an alternative solution to Talbott's proposed problem.

==Problem of evil==
In the September 1987 edition of the periodical ''Christian Scholar's Review'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csreview.org/ ''Christian Scholar's Review'' Home page]&lt;/ref&gt; Talbott sought, as he explains in a more recent comment, "to make some ideas then current in the philosophical literature available to a wider audience of non-philosophers."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Talbott, "John Beversluis and the Problem of Evil," {{cite web |url=http://www.willamette.edu/~ttalbott/Beversluis%20and%20Evil.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608031808/http://www.willamette.edu/~ttalbott/Beversluis%20and%20Evil.pdf |archivedate=2011-06-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He sought to explain, for example, how [[Alvin Plantinga]]'s Free Will Defense had transformed the way in which contemporary philosophers approach the so-called [[problem of evil]] and why, in particular, even atheistic philosophers came to abandon the claim that evil is ''logically inconsistent'' with the existence of God. But at the end of this article, Talbott also ventured into more controversial territory, suggesting ways in which even the tragic suffering of innocent children might contribute, in the end, to the future blessedness of all people (including the children who suffer). In accordance with his affirmation of universal reconciliation, he thus expressed the hopeful belief that "every innocent child who suffers will one day look upon that suffering as a privilege because of the joy it has made possible: the joy of knowing that one has been used by God in the redemption of others, the joy of that final union or reunion in which love's triumph is complete and all separation from others is finally overcome. I would ask but two things of those who [might understandably] reject such a view: first, that they resist the temptation to moralize, and second, that they consider the alternatives carefully."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal  | last = Talbott | first =  Thomas | title =  C.S. Lewis and the Problem of Evil | journal =  Christian Scholar's Review | volume =  15 | issue = 1  | page = 50 | date =  September 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others have, not surprisingly, roundly criticized and even ridiculed such a view. According to John Beversluis, Emeritus Professor of Philosophy at [[Butler University]], for example, Talbott's view is "so outrageous...that I will not dignify it with a reply....If Talbott is right, he is logically committed and morally obliged to oppose everyone dedicated to alleviating world hunger, ridding the world of terrorism, finding a cure for cancer...and so forth."&lt;ref&gt;Beversluis, John. ''C.S. Lewis and the Search for Rational Religion''. Amherst: Prometheus Books, 2007. pp. 246-7&lt;/ref&gt; But in an equally hard-hitting reply, Talbott dismisses this claim by comparing it to a more precise claim of the following form: "If Talbott is right in accepting [proposition] ''p'' (where ''p'' is specifically identified), then Talbott is logically committed to ''q''." He then points out that a cogent argument in the present context would require two things of Beversluis: "first, that he identify a relevant instance of ''p'', and second, that he make some attempt to deduce ''q'' from ''p''. But Beversluis," Talbott insists, "does not so much as identify the proposition that he claims logically commits me to the moral obligation he alleges; much less does he make the required deduction." &lt;ref&gt;Talbott "John Beversluis and the Problem of Evil," {{cite web |url=http://www.willamette.edu/~ttalbott/Beversluis%20and%20Evil.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110608031808/http://www.willamette.edu/~ttalbott/Beversluis%20and%20Evil.pdf |archivedate=2011-06-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Talbott acknowledges, however, that his optimistic view could be regarded as a case of wishful thinking. But he goes on to contrast hope with despair, arguing that, unlike despair, hope is compatible with a healthy skepticism.&lt;ref&gt;See The Inescapable Love of God, pp. 212-216&lt;/ref&gt; For whereas despair typically rests upon a set of dogmatic beliefs about the future, hope does not.

The term "transnational" is reaction and the rejection of terms like "international" and "global" feminism.&lt;ref name="scattered" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SwarrNagar2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mohanty2003" /&gt; Transnational feminists believe that the term "international" puts more emphasis on nation-states as distinct entities, and that "global" speaks to liberal feminist theories on "global sisterhood" that ignore Third World women and women of color's perspectives on gender inequality and other problems globalization inherently brings.

The transnational feminist academic paradigm draws from [[postcolonial feminist]] theories, which emphasize how colonialist legacies have shaped and continue to shape the social, economic, and [[political repression|political oppression]] of people across the globe.&lt;ref name="scattered"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Grewal|first1=Inderpal|last2=editors|first2=Caren Kaplan,|title=Scattered hegemonies : postmodernity and transnational feminist practices|date=1994|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|location=Minneapolis|isbn=978-0816621385|edition=[Nachdr.].}}&lt;/ref&gt; It rejects the idea that people from different regions have the same [[subjectivities]] and experiences with [[gender inequality]], it further recognizes that global [[capitalism]] has created similar relations of exploitation and inequality, this core concept creates dialogue which feminists around the world can find solidarity and seek collaboration. Transnational feminism further complicates global capitalism and neoliberalism.

Transnational feminist practice is involved in activist movements across the globe that work together to understand the role of [[gender]], the state, [[Race (human classification)|race]], [[Class (social)|class]], and [[sexuality]] in critiquing and resisting structures of [[patriarchal]], [[capitalist]] power. It is attentive to feminism as both a liberatory formation and a practice that has been oppressed by and sometimes been complicit with [[colonialism]], [[racism]], and [[imperialism]]. As such, it resists [[utopian]] ideas about "global sisterhood" while simultaneously working to lay the groundwork for more productive and equitable social relations among women across borders and cultural contexts.

==Usage==

Transnational feminist theorists and practitioners vary in how they phrase "transnational feminism". Variations include "transnational feminisms", or "transnational feminist praxis"&lt;ref name="SwarrNagar2010"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Swarr|first1=edited by Amanda Lock|last2=Nagar|first2=Richa|title=Critical Transnational Feminist Praxis|date=2010|publisher=State University of New York Press|location=Albany, NY|isbn=978-1438429380}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "transnational practices"&lt;ref name="KaplanGrewal2006"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kaplan|first1=[ed. by] Inderpal Grewal; Caren|title=An introduction to women's studies : gender in a transnational world|date=2006|publisher=McGraw-Hill Higher Education|location=Boston [u.a.]|isbn=9780072887181|edition=2.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amanda Swarr and Richa Nagar, in their book ''Critical Transnational Feminist Praxis'', give a list of the now outdated terms that describe transnational feminist practices. They emphasize that, like these "rejects", the term "transnational" feminisms is merely a product of its time in the U.S. and Canadian academic institutions. Before, the terms were " "women of color" feminisms (Combahee River Collective 1982), "third world" feminisms (Mohanty et al. 1991), "Multicultural feminisms (e.g. Shohat 1998)", "international (Enloe 1990)" and "global" feminisms (e.g., Morgan 1984)." Currently, "transnational feminism" is the term that feminists like Chandra Mohanty and Jacqui Alexander, Inderpal Grewal and Caren Kaplan claim has political power and can discard [[essentialist]] binaries like First World/Third World, or [[heteronormative]] gender constructs. These feminist theorists believed that "international" put more emphasis on nation-states as distinct entities, and that "global" speaks to [[liberal feminist]] theories, like Robin Morgan's concept of "global sisterhood",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morgan|first1=Robin|title=Sisterhood is Global: The International Women's Movement Anthology|date=1996|publisher=The Feminist Press at CUNY|location=CUNY}}&lt;/ref&gt; without taking into consideration race, class, culture, or colonialist and imperialist histories.

In ''Women's studies on its own: a next wave reader in institutional change,'' Inderpal Grewal and Caren Kaplan claim they do not think the term "transnational" is better than other "international" or "global", but that it is useful inasmuch as it is free from the implications that other terms may have:
{{Quote|text=Transnational as a term is useful only when it signals attention to uneven and dissimilar circuits of culture and capital. Through such critical recognition, the links among patriarchies, colonialisms, racisms, and feminisms become more apparent and available for critique or appropriation. The history of the term "international", by contrast, is quite different. |author=Inderpal Grewal and Caren Kaplan |source=&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wiegman|first1=edited by Robyn|title=Women's studies on its own : a next wave reader in institutional change|date=2002|publisher=Duke University Press|location=Durham, N.C. ;London|isbn=978-0822329862}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 }}

Criticisms against the term "transnational" claim that because it de-emphasizes the borders between nations and emphasizes the similar concept of global capital flows, it deceptively smooths over large inequalities between nations.&lt;ref name="Oxford2016"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Disch|first1=Lisa|last2=Hawkesworth|first2=Mary|title=The Oxford Handbook of Feminist Theory|date=2016|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Transnational Feminism in practice can be noted as a means of studying the “other”, a western concept of people not strictly related to the global north. This is the attempt to understand what factors make up their identities and struggles and a way of acknowledging  these experiences have their own complex natures, unique geographically and how this is interpolated by those examining and theorizing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780190221911/obo-9780190221911-0006.xml#obo-9780190221911-0006-div2-0017|title=Transnational Feminism - Literary and Critical Theory - Oxford Bibliographies - obo|access-date=2018-10-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

===Globalization===

[[Globalization]] is a process marked by greater political, economic, and social interdependence between all the nations of the world. It arose in the 1970s with greater market expansion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lourdes|last2=May|first2=AnnMari|last3=Strassmann|first3=Diana|title=Feminist Economics Volumes I–III, pp. xi–xxi. International Library of Critical Writings in Economics series|date=2011|publisher=Edward Elgar Publishing Inc.|location=Northampton|page=xi-xx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[neoliberal]] ideologies and policies spread in the 1980s and 1990s, more governments started deregulating their markets. In the Third World, governments implemented [[Structural Adjustment Programs]], which espoused the neoliberal ideologies of free trade, increased government deregulation, and reduced welfare and social protection. These practices feminized the labor force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Standing|first1=Guy|title=Global feminization through flexible Labor|journal=World Development|date=1989|volume=17|issue=7|pages=1077–1095|doi=10.1016/0305-750x(89)90170-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because women in Third world countries are now more involved in the professional workforce, many outsource care work to women in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chen|first1=Martha|last2=Vanek|first2=Joann|last3=Lund|first3=Francie|last4=Heintz|first4=James|last5=Jhabvala|first5=Renana|last6=Bonner|first6=Christine|title=Progress of the World's Women|date=2005|publisher=United Nations Development Fund for Women|location=New York|pages=22–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; This provides more job opportunities for the Third World women but also detracts from the migrants' ability to care for their own children and increases the gap in human capital between the two spheres. Because of this global demand for outsourced labor, women in countries like Bangladesh and Cambodia who would otherwise not have a job now do, and studies have shown that this improves their sense of empowerment and reduces likelihood of domestic abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kabeer|first1=Naila|title=Globalization, labor standards, and women's rights: dilemmas of collective (in)action in an interdependent world|journal=Feminist Economics|date=March 2004|volume=10|issue=1|pages=3–35|doi=10.1080/1354570042000198227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Globalization also allows resistances against the spread of neoliberal ideologies. Transnational feminist networks, in which women from all over the world can organize together against gender inequity, would not be possible without the information and travel networks created by globalization.

===Feminism===

In the ''Oxford Handbook of Transnational Feminist Movements'', Valentine Moghadam says that "women have worked together across borders since at least the mid-1800s. (55)" What is now called [[first wave feminism]] started in the early twentieth century in the West with a focus on women's suffrage. 
During [[World War II]], the United States government gave women jobs because the war had caused a national shortage of labor. After the war ended, Irene Tinker says (oxford transnational), these jobs were taken away but women were no longer satisfied going back to their previous gender roles. Starting in the 1960s in the United States, [[second wave feminism]] emerged, defined by women's organization around "equal right to education, employment, and equal pay for equal work, and on sexual and reproductive rights." The UN Decade for Women of 1976-1985, and the following four UN conferences on women between 1975 and 1995 were essential in creating transnational feminist networks and putting feminism on a global agenda. 
However starting in the 1980s there was a separation between Western feminists and [[Third World]] feminists. This occurred largely because Western feminists largely subscribed to [[liberal feminist]] perspectives, which focused on the common patriarchal oppressor of women, defined by its confining women to the household and traditional work. Liberal feminists propose that women break this oppression by leaving their traditional roles in the household, becoming educated, and entering the labor force. Women in the global South often felt that Western feminism did not represent them and align with their struggles. They felt that Western feminism was ethnocentric and assumed all women had similar situations. Scholars like Chandra Talpade Mohanty plays an integral role in articulating concerns about Western feminism's failure to account for non-Western subjects. She critiques feminism during this time period to be more inclusive of intersectional struggles, identifying that feminism and inequalities are not linear, and the idea of female being a basis of shared oppression invisibilized the individual within their specific context and time.&lt;ref name="Mohanty 2000"/&gt; Upon realizing that the common phenomena of capitalist globalization was causing women all over the world to be disproportionately affected (CITE), transnational feminist movements allied together and helped to consolidate the field of transnational feminism.

===Transnational feminism===

The theory termed "transnational feminism" was first used&lt;ref name="Oxford2016" /&gt; by Inderpal Grewal and Caren Kaplan in 1994 in their seminal text ''Scattered Hegemonies: Postmodernity and Transnational Feminist Practices, which situated transnational feminism among other theories of feminism, modernity, and postmodernity.''
Soon after, M. Alexander and Chandra Mohanty published ''Feminist Genealogies, Colonial Legacies, Democratic Futures'' in 1997, a book important in formulating transnational feminist canon. This text, building on Grewal and Kaplan's, focused more on the ways in which a new theory of transnational feminism could help foreground feminist activist practices in global contexts. They talk about  "feminist democracies" as ways for activists to imagine nonhegemonic futures.

The practice of transnational feminism networks, in which feminists started exchanging ideas and collaborating across nation-state borders, originated from the United Nations conferences in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Oxford2016" /&gt; In 1975 the United Nations Decade of Women began with the United Nations declaration of an International Women's Year. This ushered in a decade of conferences that would continue to the present. Important events during this period included conferences in Mexico City (1975), Copenhagen (1980), Nairobi (1985), and Beijing in 1995.&lt;ref name="SwarrNagar2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Oxford2016" /&gt;

These conferences and others facilitated the contact of feminists from all over the globe, allowing for discussions to occur that transcended borders. While so called "western feminists", a term for feminists that were "US-based white, class-privileged women"&lt;ref name="SwarrNagar2010" /&gt; had dominated the women's rights movement, when women from other parts of the globe were brought in, they began criticizing this type of women's rights for assuming all women had the same experiences, and not considering the impact of factors such as race, state, economic status had on their lives.

The theories of WID and GAD also helped to highlight gender related issues that pertained to women worldwide.&lt;ref name="Sarah E 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dempsey|first1=Sarah E.|last2=Parker|first2=Patricia S.|last3=Krone|first3=Kathleen J.|title=Navigating Socio-Spatial Difference, Constructing Counter-Space: Insights from Transnational Feminist Praxis|journal=Journal of International and Intercultural Communication|date=August 2011|volume=4|issue=3|pages=201–220|doi=10.1080/17513057.2011.569973}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/17513057.2011.569973 | volume=4 | issue=3 | title=Navigating Socio-Spatial Difference, Constructing Counter-Space: Insights from Transnational Feminist Praxis | journal=Journal of International and Intercultural Communication | pages=201–220| year=2011 | last1=Dempsey | first1=Sarah E | last2=Parker | first2=Patricia S | last3=Krone | first3=Kathleen J }}&lt;/ref&gt; The establishment of transnational feminist networks did many things, one such thing was creating numerous NGOs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Quataert|first1=J.H.|last2=Roth|first2=B|title=editorial note: Human rights, global conferences, and the making of postwar transnational feminism|journal=Journal of Women's History|date=2012|volume=24|issue=4|pages=11–23|doi=10.1353/jowh.2012.0038}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The United Nations conferences were not the only factors leading to the transnationalization of feminism as mentioned, WID and GAD played important roles and so did other global events. As more women globally were gaining greater access to education, obtaining jobs, and becoming more mobile, it allowed for women to more easily meet and communicate. The spread of neoliberalism, poor working conditions, and declining welfare conditions in many countries led many women to find common ground and to subsequently form transnational feminist groups and organizations.&lt;ref name="Sarah E 2011"/&gt;

Although the term "transnational" was chosen for its supposed political power and ability to "resist or question modernity", Laura Briggs, in the ''Oxford Handbook of Feminist Theory'', claims that "transnational feminism" could only be legitimized as a separate field of feminist study when the term "transnational" started being used by business schools, education systems, and global corporations in the 1990s. Since then, however, academic institutions have been incorporating transnational feminist studies as categories of study. In 2000, a group of feminists started publishing the journal ''[[Meridians: feminism, race, transnationalism]]'', in which feminist theorists like Amrita Basu started using the term "transnational feminism" to describe a separate and emerging field of feminist studies.

== Theory ==

Transnational feminist theories seek to destabilize liberal feminist assumptions that Third World women face the same type of oppression as First World women. 
In their seminal text'' Scattered Hegemonies: Postmodernity and Transnational Feminist Practices'', the authors Inderpal Grewal and Caren Kaplan posit transnational feminist theory as one that critiques [[modernity]] through the lens of feminist theory. This articulation of feminist theory is a revision to the field of [[postmodernism]], which the authors argue is powerful in its critique of modern global capitalism, but inadequate because it does not explore gender or reflect on the consequences of theorizing with a Western background. Without paying attention to how colonial histories and global capital flows allow for different cultures to influence and change each other, postmodernist theorists portray non-Western cultures as essentially different from and marginal to Western cultures. Postmodern does not exemplify the realities of transnational feminism and its relation to the global south, Mohanty states "postmodernist critique that is skeptical of a systematic analysis of institutionalized power and of decolonizing methodologies that center marginalized experience (women of color epistemology) in struggles for justice is seriously off the mark".&lt;ref name="Mohanty2013"&gt;{{cite journal | last1= Mohanty | first= C.T. | year = 2013 | title= Transnational Feminist Crossings: On Neoliberalism and Radical Critique  |url = | journal = Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society | volume = 38 | issue = 4 | pages = 967–991 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   In order for activists around the world to collaborate, they need a theory that both creates solidarity among women all over the globe and recognizes difference. This involves challenging how people from different cultures understand what being a "woman" is and can be. Grewal and Kaplan express this sentiment when they say:

{{Quote|text=In working to construct such a terrain for coalition and cooperation, however, we have to rearticulate the histories of how people in different locations and circumstances are linked by the spread of and resistance to modern capitalist social formations even as their experiences of these phenomena are not at all the same or equal. }}

These modern capitalist social formations can include "humanitarian" wars waged on behalf of the supposed oppressed women.&lt;ref name="Mullally2009"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mullaly | first1 = S | year = 2009 | title = Gender, culture and human rights: Reclaiming universalism | url = | journal = International Journal of Law | volume = 5 | issue = 1| pages = 87–92 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   [[Laura Bush]], along with various western feminist groups such as National Organization for Women and the Feminist Majority Foundation, justified the war in Afghanistan because of "the human rights abuses committed against Afghani women and girls by the Taliban".&lt;ref name="Mullally2009"/&gt;   Transnational feminists often oppose such wars, and tend to insist that Western states try to work with local women's rights groups, such as the Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan (RAWA).&lt;ref name="Mullally2009" /&gt; to ensure the effectiveness of solving the cultural and systematic problem that is affecting those marginalized subjects. Another example of liberal feminist theories going wrong is the ban against wearing Muslim [[burqas]] in public. Westerners objected to burqas because they saw them as "a symbol of subservience". Transnational feminists argue that banning burqas forces women to conform to "Euro-patriarchal notions of femininity and dress",&lt;ref name="Mullally2009"/&gt; stripping them of their agency to make their own choices.

== Concerns ==
There are a number of concerns that many transnational feminists focus on. Issues of gender, imperialism, colonialism, economics, human rights, race, and nationalism encompass many areas of concern.

=== Gender ===

Transnational feminisms examine how powers of colonialism, modernity, postmodernity, and globalization construct gender norms, or normative conceptions of masculinity and femininity among the subaltern, Third World, and colonized.

Second-wave feminism in the 1980s started to explore gender instead of sex as a category of distinction between people. With a recognition that biology can identify differences between people, feminists focused on the system of gender norms as an ongoing, changeable process that shaped people's lives and behaviors. This production of critique was largely used in the Global North and is a liberal feminist ideology. Though it did not broaden the discussion of workplace discrimination and reproductive rights for heterosexual female identified people of the first world, this wave was exclusionary of Third world feminist and the global south. Second wave feminism rejected critic of inequalities due to class, race, sex, socioeconomic status, legal status, age, ability and religion.&lt;ref name="Code2006"&gt;{{cite book |last= Code |first= L. |year=2006 |chapter= Introduction |title= Encyclopedia of feminist theories |pages= xv–xxiii }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With global capitalism causing more people to migrate away from their homes in search of jobs, migration has affected genders unequally, and is thus a key concern in transnational feminisms and feminist economics. Women currently account for roughly half of long-distance migration, and overwhelmingly marginalized women of color bear the burden of global capitalism.

=== Human rights ===

Because the original design of human rights, particularly as constituted in the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], was designed to fit into specific legal categories, it reflected the "needs and values of affluent white Western men" who were the subjects of the legal system.&lt;ref name="CollinsFalconLodhiaTalcott2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Collins|first1=Dana|last2=Falcon|first2=Sylvanna |last3=Lodhia |first3=Sharmila|last4=Talcott|first4=Molly|title=New Directions in Feminism and Human Rights|journal=International Feminist Journal of Politics|date=December 2010|volume=12|issue=3|pages=298–318|doi=10.1080/14616742.2010.513096}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transnational feminists argue that human rights sometimes do not take into account other conceptions of rights, and do not recognize the experiences of women, in particular those who are "indigenous, Third World, women of color, poor, rural, disabled and queer".&lt;ref name="CollinsFalconLodhiaTalcott2010"/&gt; For example, human rights are geared towards public life and often don't account for the violations of women within their private lives. The private sector is often one of the major focuses of women's rights, including "domestic violence, the 'double day' of work and family, discrimination against homosexuals, or the denial of reproductive rights",&lt;ref name="Friedman2003"&gt;Friedman, E. J. (2003). Gendering the agenda: The impact of the transnational women's rights movement at the UN conferences of the 1990s. Women's Studies International Forum, 26(4), 313-331.&lt;/ref&gt; and even rights tied to keeping these private for women. However, human rights discourse doesn't largely concern itself with these areas.&lt;ref name="Mullally2009"/&gt; Feminists also critique that these definitions of human rights are often tied too much to the nation-state itself, and that this model discludes "the majority of women and communities throughout the world".&lt;ref name="CollinsFalconLodhiaTalcott2010"/&gt;

Feminists argue that human rights tend also to reinforce power imbalances, giving marginalized people the false assumption that they have rights. In reality these kinds of rights often work more greatly in favor of those already with power,&lt;ref name="Mullally2009"/&gt; and furthermore that nation-states that already do not care to follow human rights declarations have no incentive to protect women's rights.&lt;ref name="CollinsFalconLodhiaTalcott2010"/&gt;

=== Race ===
[[Race (human classification)|Race]] is a very relevant area of study for transnational feminism as it is concerned with cross-cultural interactions, histories, and [[Human migration|migration]]s.&lt;ref name="Park2011"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Park | first1 = H | year = 2011 | title = Migrants, minorities and economics: Transnational feminism and the Asian/Canadian woman subject | url = | journal = Asian Journal of Women Studies | volume = 17 | issue = 4| pages = 7–38 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Race plays an important role in shaping not only historical interactions between groups, but also present day migrations. Race also plays an important role in many transnational interactions shaping conceptions of [[cultures]] and groups of people.&lt;ref name="Khan2013"&gt;Khan, S. (2013). Zina, transnational feminism, and the moral regulation of Pakistani women. Vancouver: UBC Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Race is a key component in transnational feminism, race and ethnicity contribute to the complexities of why globalization and neoliberal agendas are imposed on certain groups (colonized; read: marginalized groups) over others (colonizer; read: imperial elitist).

=== Economics ===

Some transnational feminist groups focus on [[economic]] issues. Many of the most important issues to transnational feminists revolve around economics. For many transnational feminists like [[Chandra Talpade Mohanty|Mohanty]], [[global capitalism]] is a serious problem and one that hurts [[women]], particularly [[Third World]] women.&lt;ref name= "Mohanty2003"&gt;Mohanty, C. T. (2003). Feminism without borders. Durham, NC: Duke University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Mohanty argues strongly against global capitalism. She considers herself an [[anti-capitalist]] and is opposed to [[globalization]].&lt;ref name="Mohanty2003"/&gt; Mohanty advocates transnational feminists take similar stances.&lt;ref name="Mohanty2003"/&gt; The expansion of [[neoliberalism]] and [[neoliberal]] policies are also of concern given their often negative impacts on women.&lt;ref name="Signs2011"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Signs | first1 = C | year = 2011 | title = We want empowerment for our women: Transnational Feminism, Neoliberal Citizenship, and the Gendering of Women's Political Subjectivity in Postconflict South Sudan | url = | journal = Journal of Women in Culture and Society | volume = 36 | issue = 3| pages = 627–652 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Audre Lorde, empowering people who are doing work, like educating others, does not mean using privilege to overstep and overpower groups like educators. Instead, these people must use their privilege to hold the door open for more allies to step in and support groups like educators or less-industrialized groups of women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dangerous Liaisons: Gender, Nation, and Postcolonial Perspectives|last=Lorde|first=Audre|first2=|publisher=University of Minneapolis Press|year=1997|isbn=9780816626496|editor-last=McClintock|editor-first=Anne|location=Minneapolis|pages=374–380|chapter=Age, Race, Class, and Sex: Women Redefining Difference}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Colonialism ===
Colonialism is one of the most important areas of concern for transnational feminism. Inderpal Grewal and Caren Kaplan talk about how colonialism has created situations of gender inequality that continue to disadvantage the lives of women today. Sometimes this inequality takes the form of neocolonialism, which manifests in the way that First World or Western feminists talk about women from the Third World, creating a binary of Us vs. Them rather than developing a cultural understanding of the differences each respective group has. These ways of talking do not consider colonialist histories and tend to portray Third World women as isolated from flows of global capital and information, and therefore passive, helpless, and uninformed. Such Western depictions of non-Western women, Grewal and Kaplan argue, only perpetuate hierarchies that place Western theorists at the superior center and non-Western theorists and people at the inferior margins.

=== Imperialism ===
[[Imperialism]] has had numerous effects on people. Imperialism has often been the impetus for colonialism. Transnational feminism examines not only colonial history, but how imperialism may have contributed to that history. Imperialism is not an issue of only the past, but one of modern-day concern. For example, the United States occupations of Iraq and Afghanistan can be seen as imperialistic in nature. The United States has also had a substantial military presence in [[Pakistan]]. Some transnational feminists argue this kind of imperialistic nature has led to the increased [[fundamentalism]] and [[extremism]] in Pakistan, which can be seen in the [[Zina]] laws.&lt;ref name="Khan2013"/&gt; The Zina Laws are strict religious laws that regulate extramarital and premarital sex. These laws have very negative effects on women's livelihoods. Transnational feminism looks at the reasons behind the oppression of women.&lt;ref name="Khan2013"/&gt; Some feminists might simply look at the oppressive nature of such policies, while many transnational feminists look to how these oppressive policies came to be.&lt;ref name="Khan2013"/&gt; By not only examining the issue at hand but depthinging the systematic ideologies such as neocolonialism and imperialism and how those contribute to the initial involvement into that country.

=== Nationalism ===
In her essay "Postcolonial Legacies", Geraldine Heng shows how feminism in almost all Third World countries arose as part of nationalistic agendas that were reacting against colonialism and imperialism.&lt;ref name="scattered" /&gt; Kwame Anthony Appiah talks about how footbinding in China ended when it was seen to represent the weakness of the nation: here, Chinese nationalism enacts its hopes for an anti-imperialist future on the bodies of its women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Appiah|first1=Kwame Anthony|title=The Honor Code: How Moral Revolutions Happen|date=2010|publisher=W.W. Norton and Co.|location=New York|page=x–xix and 137–172}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some transnational feminist are antagonistic to nationalism because of its history of being a tool of control "the retrospective activity of nation-building in modernity is always predicated upon women as trope".&lt;ref name="Herr2014"&gt;{{cite journal | last1= Herr | first= R.S.| year = 2014 | title= Reclaiming Third World Feminism: or Why Transnational Feminism Needs Third World Feminism  |url = | journal = Meridians: Feminism, Race, Transnationalism | volume = 12 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The nation-state ===

Because global capitalism is one of the driving forces for much of the inequalities that transnational feminists are addressing with, and nation-states produce and reproduce structures of global capitalism, nation-states are important to look at in transnational feminist practices.

Today, there is also a wave of transnational feminism with "important currents of feminism are challenging the state-territorial framing of political claims-making" and that rejects "the state-territorial frame" itself.&lt;ref name="Fraser2005"&gt;Fraser, N. (2005). Mapping the feminist imagination: From redistribution to recognition to representation. Constellations,12(3), 295-307.&lt;/ref&gt; They point out that the actions of one state can and tend to affect the lives of women in surrounding territories, and even throughout the world with more powerful actors. Furthermore, the actions of non-state actors, especially those of international organizations, of the governmental and non-governmental varieties, have huge impacts on the lives of women without consideration of state borders. Likewise, communication at the scale it exists today can alter the lives of women, especially with "global mass media and cyber technology".&lt;ref name="Fraser2005"/&gt; Many of the issues that women around the world face as well are not simply from within state borders, such as sickness and climate change, so the traditional model of the state does not do enough for helping to solve these issues.

Some further claim that this framework of the state further contributes to oppression, as it "partitions political space in ways that block many women from challenging the forces that oppress them", especially with the protection international corporations and the current global governance of the economy.&lt;ref name="Fraser2005"/&gt; Many of the poor and marginalized in the world, especially of the women, are restricted in seeking justice for problems against such large, international corporations. It also takes many groups out of the global decision making, as, with a few exceptions, women are underrepresented at the national level in many states and in many global governance groups.&lt;ref name="Fraser2005"/&gt; These feminists argue that because women are among the most impoverished and underrepresented of the world, in the current framework of the global nation-state, it is even more difficult for women to attempt to create change, when in order to do so, they must often go against their domestic state or an international corporation, both of which have more resources and influence than a singular or even a small community of women, so this power division and systematic structure seeks to further oppress women.

== Networks and organizations ==

In the Introduction for the Oxford Handbook of Transnational Feminist Movements, Rawwida Baksh and Wendy Harcourt define transnational feminist movements as "the fluid coalescence of organizations, networks, coalitions, campaigns, analysis, advocacy and actions that politicize women's rights and gender equality issues beyond the nation-state, particularly from the 1990s, when deepening globalization and new communications and information technologies (ICTs) enabled feminists to connect readily with a nt interrogate their localities and cross-border relations (4)." The formation of Transnational Feminist Network organizations requires methods for approaching the conflicts that arise based out of cultural and personal differences of women across the globe. Approaches include dialogue based conversations, flexibility and organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Snyder|first1=Anna|title=Transnational Dialogue: Building the Social Infrastructure for Transnational Feminist Networks|journal=International Journal of Peace Studies|date=2005|volume=10|issue=2|pages=69–88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AF3IRM is the first organization to openly and purposefully put transnational feminism into practice. Since 2006, inspired by theorists like Chandra Mohanty, AF3IRM has set out to practice a feminism that builds deeply in local communities and horizontally across national borders, recognizing and being conscious of differences while organizing. AF3IRM is also anti-imperialist, acknowledging and addressing the role United States imperialism and global capitalism plays in the subjugation of women worldwide. It is

== Movements/activism ==

Gender plays a large role in the allotment of work, quality of work, type of work etc. Women often find themselves in poor working conditions, earning minimal pay, and having little to no channels to protest or negotiate the conditions. Rural [[agricultural]] work in [[Brazil]] often exemplifies some of these conditions. Transnational feminists take interests in projects to improve gender relations in family agriculture.&lt;ref name="Thayer2010"&gt;Thayer, M. (2010). Making transnational feminism: Rural women, ngo activists, and northern donors in Brazil. New York, NY: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; These feminists wanted to understand the [[Hierarchy|subordination]] of women agricultural workers and also give the women the tools to increase political discourse.&lt;ref name="Thayer2010"/&gt; By creating [[political discourse]] they could hopefully increase their [[bargaining power]] in [[labour economics|labor]] situations.&lt;ref name="Thayer2010"/&gt; Labor rights are an issue for women not only in Brazil, but all over the world. Transnational feminists in [[South Africa]] study and acknowledge the many factors affecting women.&lt;ref name="Turshen2010"&gt;Turshen, M. (Ed.). (2010). African women: A political economy. New York, NY: Palgrave Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt; Women in South Africa face racial oppression, gender oppression, and subsequently oppression as workers.&lt;ref name="Turshen2010"/&gt;

== Critiques ==

Transnational feminism has been criticized for working within the imperialistic framework it has derived from.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Networking Arguments : Rhetoric, Transnational Feminism, and Public Policy Writing|last=Dingo|first=Rebecca|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press|year=2012|isbn=9780822961888|location=|pages=7, 8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A major criticism of transnational feminism lie in the duality of approach to research. While the United States has been seen as a great source for imperialist privilege, Sylvanna Falcón asserts that it is not the US alone that "practices imperial privilege".

:''"Privileges garnered as a result of geopolitical power are not always experienced''
:''the same way, even by groups of people who benefit from the same structural privileges."'' &lt;ref&gt;Falcón, Sylvanna M. (2016). Transnational feminism as a paradigm for decolonizing the practice of research: Identifying Feminist principles and methodology criteria for US-based scholars. Frontiers, 37(1). {{DOI|10.5250/fronjwomestud.37.1.0vii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This speaks to the level in which "Western" feminism is still homogenized as a single experience, even from transnational feminist scholars. Falcón reminds scholars to be mindful of the social location of identities that lie within the area of Western feminism while utilizing a transnational feminist lens. Furthermore, Falcón's assessment of the transnational feminist approach to ontology challenges the "tendency to secularize US feminist research."&lt;ref&gt;Falcón, Sylvanna M. (2016). Transnational feminism as a paradigm for decolonizing the practice of research: Identifying Feminist principles and methodology criteria for US-based scholars. Frontiers, 37(1). doi: 10.5250/fronjwomestud.37.1.0vii&lt;/ref&gt;

:''"Its purpose is to support a research practice that recognizes''
:''both ontologies in order "to theorize in a respectful way.""'' &lt;ref&gt;Lugones, Maria C. &amp; Spelman, Elizabeth V. (2009) Have We Got a Theory for You!

:Many scholars ask: Who has the power of representation, whom are they speaking for/about and from what perspective? What images construct the “other” and what constructs this feminist knowledge? &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Methodology ==

One key critique to transnational feminist research and literature is the obtainment of resources to accurately represent the masses and marginalised people. Falcon suggests "building of ethics involves relationships and solidarity models, prioritizing collective justice, adopting alternative research models that acknowledge the dimensions of spirituality in relation to ethics".&lt;ref name="Falcón2016"&gt;{{cite journal | last1= Falcón| first= S.M.| year = 2016 | title= Transnational Feminism as a Paradigm for Decolonizing the Practice of Research: Identifying Feminist Principles and Methodology Criteria for US-Based Scholars  |url = | journal = Frontiers: A Journal of Women Studies | volume = 37 | issue = 1 | pages = 174–194 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The need to collect other sources besides elite academic search components to ensure the accessibility of this knowledge. This also challenges academia's tendency to be exclusionary and selective to what is considered valid and noteworthy content. "Imperialist privilege is one of those contradictory factors in the research process".&lt;ref name="Falcón2016"/&gt; To bridge this gap the call for building a research community through seeking out community members, collecting testimonies to people affected by neocolonialism in marginalized communities and involving family members is crucial to creating an organic collective of non-academic, valid knowledge for transnational feminism rhetoric. 
The challenge Transnational Feminist researchers are faced with is the ability to incorporate ontologies that are relational Falcon, further explains

"Knowledge production is collective, and we must strive to retain that collective spirit in the organization of our research. As a result, scholars may have to be more creative about their research practices or acknowledge that we do not have the existing methodological tools or ability to research certain dimensions of relational ontologies."&lt;ref name="Falcón2016"/&gt;

This is not to discourage Transnational feminist but to further critique the modes in which research and academic literature obtains its knowledge. Acknowledging the central nature of feminist research as being imperialist is crucial to understanding how to further improve feminist scholarship.

'''Twin Earth''' is a [[thought experiment]] by [[philosophy|philosopher]] [[Hilary Putnam]], first in his paper "Meaning and Reference" (1973), and then in his paper "The Meaning of 'Meaning{{' "}} (1975), to illustrate his argument for [[semantic externalism]], or the view that the meanings of words are ultimately not purely psychological. The ''Twin Earth'' thought experiment was one of three, the other two being the ''Aluminum-Molybdenum'', and the ''Beech-Elm'' cases. Since the publication of these cases, philosophers have proposed numerous variations on the experiment.

== The thought experiment ==
Putnam's original formulation of the experiment was this: We begin by supposing that elsewhere in the universe there is a planet exactly like Earth in virtually all aspects, which we refer to as "Twin Earth". (We should also suppose that the relevant surroundings are exactly the same as for Earth; it revolves around a star that appears to be exactly like our sun, and so on). On Twin Earth, there is a Twin equivalent of every person and thing here on Earth. The one difference between the two planets is that there is no water on Twin Earth. In its place there is a liquid that is superficially identical, but is chemically different, being composed not of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, but rather of some more complicated formula which we abbreviate as "XYZ". The Twin Earthlings who refer to their language as "English" call XYZ "water". Finally, we set the date of our thought experiment to be several centuries ago, when the residents of Earth and Twin Earth would have no means of knowing that the liquids they called "water" were H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and XYZ respectively. The experience of people on Earth with water and that of those on Twin Earth with XYZ would be identical.

Now the question arises: when an Earthling (or Oscar for simplicity's sake) and his twin on Twin Earth say 'water' do they mean the same thing? (The twin is also called 'Oscar' on his own planet, of course. Indeed, the inhabitants of that planet call their own planet 'Earth'. For convenience, we refer to this putative planet as 'Twin Earth', and extend this naming convention to the objects and people that inhabit it, in this case referring to Oscar's twin as Twin Oscar.)  ''Ex hypothesi'', their brains are molecule-for-molecule identical. Yet, at least according to Putnam, when Oscar says 'water', the term refers to H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, whereas when Twin Oscar says 'water' it refers to XYZ. The result of this is that the contents of a person's brain are not sufficient to determine the reference of terms they use, as one must also examine the causal history that led to this individual acquiring the term. (Oscar, for instance, learned the word 'water' in a world filled with H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, whereas Twin Oscar learned 'water' in a world filled with XYZ.)

This is the essential thesis of [[semantic externalism]]. Putnam famously summarized this conclusion with the statement that {{"'}}meanings' just ain't in the head."&lt;ref&gt;Putnam 1975/1985, p.&amp;nbsp;227&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
In his original article, Putnam had claimed that the reference of the twins' "water" varied even though their psychological states were the same. [[Tyler Burge]] subsequently argued in "Other Bodies" (1982) that the twins' mental states are different:  Oscar has the concept ''H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O'', while Twin Oscar has the concept ''XYZ''. Putnam has since expressed agreement with Burge's interpretation of the thought experiment. (See Putnam's introduction in Pessin and Goldberg 1996, xxi.)

A number of philosophers have argued that "water" for both Oscar and Twin Oscar refers to anything that is sufficiently water-like (i.e. the term's extension includes both H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and XYZ). They reject, therefore, the contention that "water" is a [[rigid designator]] referring to H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. [[John Searle]], for example, argues (''Intentionality: An Essay in the Philosophy of Mind'') that, once we discover that our water is H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, we have the choice of either redefining it as H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (a classical [[Reduction (philosophy)|reduction]] redefinition) or continuing to allow the term water to refer to anything with the basic properties of water (transparency, wetness, etc.). Searle suggests that in the Twin-Earth example, the second seems more plausible, since if Twin Earth doesn't have water, then all its water-based products will also be different. Twin ice cream, for example, will be constitutionally different, yet we will still be tempted to call it ice cream. Searle, along with others, considers this sufficient argument to "solve" the thought experiment altogether; others, such as [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]], feel that variations on the experiment can be used to draw some of the same conclusions.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

[[Paul Boghossian]] raised an objection to the class of Twin-Earth-style arguments for externalism in the form of an argument that aims to show that externalism is incompatible with privileged self-knowledge. Here, privileged self-knowledge is taken to be the idea that one can know the content of one's thoughts without having to investigate the external world (for [[empirical evidence]]). Although this type of argument does not directly disprove externalism, it is pressing because of the intuitive plausibility of privileged self-knowledge's existence.&lt;ref&gt;Boghossian (1998): "What the externalist can know ''a priori''".&lt;/ref&gt;

Some philosophers believe that such science-fiction thought experiments (like the Twin-Earth) should be examined carefully. They argue that when a thought experiment describes a state of affairs that is radically different from the actual one (or what we think it to be), our intuitions can become unreliable, and hence the philosophical conclusions drawn from them may also be unreliable. [[Daniel Dennett]] calls Twin Earth and other experiments like it "[[intuition pump]]s", as they are designed in such a way to allow the thinker to use their intuition to guide them through the problem. Some philosophers take the Twin-Earth thought experiment/intuition pump to engage faulty intuitions, and hence lead to faulty conclusions. Phil Hutchinson,&lt;ref&gt;Hutchinson (2008): 'Shame and Philosophy'' (chapter 1, section 2).&lt;/ref&gt; for example, notes that a) if one looks at Putnam's own later criticisms of others (for example his criticisms of [[Jaegwon Kim]] in his book ''The Threefold Cord'') one finds that implicitly he criticises his own earlier self; and b) that the persuasive power of the Twin Earth thought experiment/intuition pump relies on our turning a blind eye to aspects of the experiment in order that it establish that which Putnam claims it to. In short, the thought experiment is set up in such a way that one's intuitions will be pumped in the desired direction.

[[John McDowell]], in his paper "Putnam on Mind and Meaning",&lt;ref&gt;see John McDowell (1998): "Putnam on Mind and Meaning". In: id., ''Mind, Meaning and Reality''.&lt;/ref&gt; criticised Putnam for still having in play a latent commitment to a picture of the mind as modelled on the brain and located in the head. Putnam has since conceded the point and subscribes to McDowell's neo-Wittgensteinian therapeutic invocation of the mind as a structured system of object involving abilities (what Putnam has since defended as a neo-Aristotelian picture of mind&lt;ref&gt;See his papers "Changing Aristotle's Mind" and "Aristotle after Wittgenstein", both reprinted in Putnam (1994): ''Words and Life''.&lt;/ref&gt;). [[Phil Hutchinson]] has since argued that this concession to McDowell means that the distinction which Putnam wishes to operationalize, between intension and extension, is now problematized.&lt;ref&gt;Hutchinson (2008): ''Shame and Philosophy'' (chapter 1).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Dupré]], in a number of papers and mainly in his paper "Natural Kinds and Biological Taxa",&lt;ref&gt;Reprinted in John Dupre (2002): ''Humans and Other Animals''.&lt;/ref&gt; has demonstrated that the theory of natural kinds, which many have taken to be established and/or supported by Putnam's Twin Earth thought experiment does not find support in the practice of scientific classification. [[Avrum Stroll]] has produced probably the most comprehensive critique of the program of natural kind semantics (both Putnam's and Kripke's) in his book ''Sketches of Landscapes''.&lt;ref&gt;Avrum Stroll (1998): ''Sketches of Landscapes''.&lt;/ref&gt; Putnam, who is well known for changing his philosophical positions on a variety of issues, criticized the experiment later in life because it is anti-functionalist.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

An '''''umpan''''' ({{nihongo|'''umpan'''|雲版}}, {{zh|c=雲版|p=yún bǎn}}, literally "cloud plate")  is a flat [[gong]], usually [[bronze]], which is rung at mealtime in a [[Zen]] [[monastery]]. Literally translated as "cloud plate," the umpan is also sounded to "signal other events,"&lt;ref name="baroni"&gt;Baroni, 364&lt;/ref&gt; such as a call to the conclusion of [[zazen]].&lt;ref&gt;Sogen, xii&lt;/ref&gt; Typically one will find an umpan outside the kitchen (J. [[Kuri (kitchen)|kuri]]) or dining hall area. According to [[Helen J. Baroni]], "Wooden boards (''han'') hanging on various buildings throughout the temple grounds are sounded simultaneously to alert the members of the community beyond the range of the umpan."&lt;ref name="baroni"/&gt;

==Uṣṇīṣa Vijaya Dhāraṇī Sūtra==
The [[Uṣṇīṣa Vijaya Dhāraṇī Sūtra]] is the Mantra of Usnisavijaya, a very important Dharani in Chinese Buddhism such that a [[Chinese Emperor]] (唐代宗 776 AD) and a [[Japanese Emperor]] (清和天皇 860 AD ) had both enforced all [[Vihara|Buddhist monasteries]] within their countries to facilitate its practice, after it had been believed to have brought rain to end two events of droughts in history.

'''William Christopher Barrett''' (1913–1992) was a [[professor]] of [[philosophy]] at [[New York University]] from 1950 to 1979. 

==Biography==
Precociously, Barrett began post-secondary studies at the [[City College of New York]] when 15 years old. He received his [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] at [[Columbia University]].  He was an editor of ''[[Partisan Review]]'' and later the literary critic of ''[[The Atlantic Monthly]]'' magazine. He was well known for writing philosophical works for nonexperts. These included ''[[Irrational Man]]'' and ''The Illusion of Technique'', which remain in print.&lt;ref name="Honan, William H"&gt;{{cite news  |author=Honan, William H. |author-link=William H. Honan |date=September 10, 1992 |title=William Barrett, 78, a Professor And Interpreter of Existentialism  |newspaper=New York Times  |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1992/09/10/arts/william-barrett-78-a-professor-and-interpreter-of-existentialism.html  |accessdate=March 3, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like many intellectuals of his generation, Barrett flirted with [[Marxism]] before turning his energies to providing readable introductions to European philosophical schools, notably [[existentialism]].

Barrett was good friends with the poet [[Delmore Schwartz]] for many years. He knew many other literary figures of the day, including [[Edmund Wilson]], [[Philip Rahv]], and [[Albert Camus]].  He was deeply influenced by the philosophies of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Søren Kierkegaard]], and [[Martin Heidegger]] and was the editor of [[D. T. Suzuki]]'s 1956 classic ''Zen Buddhism''.  In fiction his taste ran to the great Russians, particularly [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]]. 

Barrett died in 1992, aged 78, of [[cancer]] of the [[esophagus]].&lt;ref name="Honan, William H"/&gt;

[[Barrett's Law]] is named for him: "''not everyone who might read the productions of scholarly writers is an expert in the fields discussed''" (p.&amp;nbsp;99).&lt;ref name="barrett's law"&gt;Burman, J. T. (2012). The misunderstanding of memes: Biography of an unscientific object, 1976–1999. ''[[Perspectives on Science]], 20''(1), 75-104.

'''Yoga pants''' are a type of flexible, form-fitting pants designed for the practice of [[yoga]] as well as other physical activities that involve a lot of movement, bending and stretching. They are typically worn for sports and physical exercise, [[martial arts]], [[dancing]], [[pilates]], or [[aerobics]]. These pants are generally made from a blend of cotton, lycra spandex, nylon, polyester, wool, or a similarly light and [[stretch fabric|stretchy synthetic material]] giving the pants a very soft, smooth, polished and silky finish when worn.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/posteverything/wp/2016/12/15/yoga-pants-are-comfy-theyre-also-an-assault-on-manners-and-a-nihilistic-threat/ |title=Yoga pants are comfy.

==Types of yoga pants==
According to Anu Hastings with the&amp;nbsp;product database [[Indix]], over 2,700 types of so-called "yoga pants" are now available on the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.indix.com/indix-product-bite-yoga-pants-taking-world/|title = Indix|date = 18 September 2014|accessdate = 21 April 2015|website = Indix|publisher = Indix|last = Hastings|first = Anu}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are various types and styles, including the traditional boot-cut and flared yoga pants with flat [[waistband]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://elitedaily.com/women/the-19-reasons-all-women-worship-yoga-pants/ | title=#DefaultOutfit: The 19 Reasons All Women Worship Yoga Pants | publisher= |website=Elite Daily | date=27 January 2014 | accessdate=2 October 2015 | author=Ashley Fern}}&lt;/ref&gt; The typical type of yoga pants traditionally come in black, are tight-fitted, boot-cut, and flared style, are reversible, carry a four way stretch fabric  and have a flat elastic waistband folded over at the top.

The flat and fold-over waists are utilized to provide flexibility, comfort, coverage, style, breathability and versatility. Flat and fold-over waist boot cut and flare yoga pants are commonly used as casual wear, workout and exercise wear, maternity wear, making errands, lounging around the house, yoga class, or as [[clubwear]] as women would wear the body-hugging pants to permit freedom of movement when dancing during nights out at their local nightclub.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://mancavin.com/galleries/club-scene/ |title=Club Girls: 10 Types of Girls You See at a Nightclub |date=29 December 2016 |website=Mancavin}}&lt;br&gt;- {{Cite web |url=https://cilisos.my/4-must-haves-for-a-safe-night-of-clubbing-in-kl-while-still-looking-fabulous-duh/ |title=4 must-haves for a safe night of clubbing in KL (while still looking fabulous, duh) |last= Ho-Lee |first=Jasmine |date=14 April 2014 |website= Cilisos}}&lt;br&gt;- {{Cite web |url=http://www.shape.com/fitness/clothes/workout-clothes-you-can-wear-night-out |title=Workout Clothes You Can Wear On a Night Out  |last= Malacoff |first=Julia |date=29 December 2015}}&lt;br&gt;- {{cite web | url=http://yoganonymous.com/you-can-find-them-in-da-club-yoga-pants-are-you-down-with-the-y-p-p/ | title=You Can Find them In da Club: Yoga Pants? | publisher= |website=Yoganonymous | date=28 January 2014 | accessdate=24 October 2015}}&lt;br&gt;- {{cite web | url=http://shine.yahoo.com/fashion/20-places-moms-wear-yoga-pants-without-embarrassing-184300782.html | title=20 Places Moms Can Wear Yoga Pants Without Embarrassing Themselves | publisher= |website=Yahoo | date=16 November 2012 | accessdate=3 September 2013}}&lt;br&gt;- {{cite web | url=http://www.scarymommy.com/7-reasons-yoga-pants-are-a-mommy-must/ | title=7 Reasons Yoga Pants Are A Mommy Must | publisher= |website=Scary Mommy | accessdate=3 September 2013}}&lt;br&gt;- {{cite web | url=http://styleblazer.com/199801/yoga-pants-club-maybe-one-day/ | title=Yoga Pants At The Club?

Demand for comfortable active, athletic, sports and casual wear has increased since the turn of the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stalder|first1=Erika|title=Fashion 101: A Crash Course in Clothing|date=2008|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|isbn=9780547946931|page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nike, Inc.]] reported their women's business comprised 7 billion in 2010&lt;ref name =Denv/&gt; and the larger market grew to $33.6 billion by 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Will yoga pants have jean makers singing the blues?|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/will-yoga-pants-have-jean-makers-singing-the-blues/|website=CBS Money Watch|publisher=|accessdate=22 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;Nike claims the driving factor has been by the demand for fashionable workout gear that is also flattering. New colors, patterns, and structural design of yoga pants created more versatility and increased their wear in public settings. Author Mae Anderson described the new craze of yoga pants outside the gym by calling them the "new jeans."&lt;ref name =Denv&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.denverpost.com/lifestyles/ci_24595974/how-yoga-pants-became-new-jeans|title = How yoga pants became the new jeans.|date = 25 November 2013|accessdate = 2 April 2015|website = Denver Post|publisher = |last = Anderson|first = Mae}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many high-end fashion houses and mass-market trend-chasers have capitalized on the growth of the modern sportswear market, leading an emphasis on technical fabrics and garments that facilitate wearing them as everyday dress. Market research analysts have sought to explain the trend by referencing the extension of work hours in major cities across North America, leading to a "day-to-night" than a "gym-to-work"—while other explanations cite the North American passion for fitness and healthy living.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.highsnobiety.com/2014/06/12/technical-fabric-in-fashion/ | title=Technical Fabric in Fashion is Here to Stay | publisher=|website=HighSnobiety | date=2 June 2014 | accessdate=2 October 2016 | author=Brundage, Douglas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, reaction to the wider adoption of yoga pants proved somewhat controversial for schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Foley|first1=Heather|title=Your guide to America's war on yoga pants|url=http://www.boston.com/lifestyle/fashion/2014/04/10/america-war-yoga-pants/C7cE8EIbZdjTLbMW9luL6H/story.html|work=Boston.com|date=10 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some schools adopted [[dress codes]] banning yoga pants for all students, or banning them only for female students.&lt;ref name=MA&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/regionals/north/2014/03/06/rockport-high-school-leggings-ban-controversy-still-simmers/bB6p4Q7AQeriyIACzAjlWJ/story.html|title = Rockport High School leggings-ban controversy still simmers|date = 6 March 2014|accessdate = 9 April 2015|website = The Boston Globe|publisher = |last = Shemkus|first = Sarah}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/distracting-yoga-pants-banned-officials-north-dakota-high-school-article-1.1962380|title = 'Distracting' yoga pants banned by officials at North Dakota high school|date = 3 October 2014|accessdate = 9 April 2015|website = Daily News|publisher = |last = Lestch|first = Corinne}}&lt;br&gt;- {{Cite web|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/03/19/school-bans-leggings_n_4993941.html|title = Parents Say School's Leggings 'Ban' Is Unfair To Girls, 'Contributes To Rape Culture'|date = 19 March 2014|accessdate = 9 April 2015|website = Huffington Post|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Bitch (magazine)|Bitch]]'' magazine argued such bans are largely gendered, focusing on the damage caused by "distraction" by girls;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Chin|first1=Elleanor|title=Instead of Banning Yoga Pants, Schools Should Crack Down on Harassment|url=http://bitchmagazine.org/post/instead-of-banning-yoga-pants-schools-should-crack-down-on-harassment|work=[[Bitch Magazine|Bitch]]|date=15 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; similar complaints caused a ban in [[Rockport, Massachusetts]], that was quickly reversed.&lt;ref name=MA /&gt;

There are others who agree with banning yoga pants in public. Most often the reasoning for disagreeing with wearing yoga pants publicly is that they promote a relaxed and informal atmosphere. Amanda Hallay, professor of fashion and cultural history at New York City's [[LIM College]], was interviewed for her opinion on yoga pants being a replacement for jeans. She said, "Yoga pants are a step above pajamas and we don't wear pajamas out to lunch, and we certainly don't wear them to work. Pajamas are for sleeping in, and ergo, not appropriate to wear in any other setting. The same can be said for yoga pants. Yoga pants are to be worn while doing yoga." Yoga pants being worn in public can be perceived as inappropriate and unattractive. According to Hallay, to promote a more business-like or mature persona, a person should dress as such.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = That's a 'no' to yoga pants; What we wear in public has to be about more than just our comfort.|last = Rhone|first = Nedra|date = 14 March 2015|journal = Atlanta Journal-Constitution|doi = |pmid = |accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the U.S. state of [[Montana]], some [[Montana House of Representatives|state House]] members unsuccessfully attempted to ban the wearing of in public of "any device, costume, or covering that gives the appearance of or simulates the genitals, pubic hair, anus region, or pubic hair region." The author of the legislation, Republican David Moore, acknowledged that the measure could extend to "tight beige garments" and stated: "Yoga pants should be illegal in public anyway."&lt;ref&gt;Alexandra Petri, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/compost/wp/2015/02/12/absurd-things-that-almost-happened-montanas-yoga-pants-ban/ Absurd things that almost happened: Montana’s yoga pants ban], ''Washington Post'' (12 February 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; Moore later said that the latter comment was an "off-the-cuff" joke, although the [[Associated Press]] stood by its reporting.&lt;ref&gt;Jessica Glenza, [https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/feb/14/republican-montana-yoga-pants-obscenity "Republican in Montana yoga pants obscenity uproar explains: it was a joke"], ''The Guardian'' (14 February 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;
