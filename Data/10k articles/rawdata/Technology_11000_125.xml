      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1046">'''Acidulants''' are [[chemical compound]]s that confer a tart, sour, or acidic flavor to foods.  They differ from [[acidity regulator]]s, which are [[food additive]]s intended to modify the stability of food or enzymes within it.  Typical acidulants are [[acetic acid]] (e.g. in [[pickled cucumber|pickles]]) and  [[citric acid]].  Many beverages, such as colas, contain [[phosphoric acid]].  Sour candies often are formulated with [[malic acid]].&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;Erich Lück and Gert-Wolfhard von Rymon Lipinski "Foods, 3.

'''Arrid''' is a type of [[antiperspirant]] and [[deodorant]] originally introduced in 1935 by [[Carter Products]] and was acquired by [[Church &amp; Dwight]] in 2001.&lt;ref name=fu&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fundinguniverse.com/company-histories/CarterWallace-Inc-Company-History.html |title=Carter-Wallace |accessdate=2011-09-26 |quote=... Arrid became the largest selling deodorant in the United States. These two characteristics of the Arrid product became Carter-Wallace trademarks: the effective use of advertising, combined with a product that was developed instead of copied. To keep ahead of its many imitators and competitors, Arrid was constantly improved. The success of the deodorant soon led to the construction of a new plant in New Brunswick. Carter's sales topped the $1 million mark for the first time in 1935. ... For ten years, the original formula of Arrid was a top-seller. ... |publisher=Funding Universe }}&lt;/ref&gt; The active ingredient is up to 20% [[aluminium zirconium tetrachlorohydrex gly]].

==Products==
Arrid deodorants and antiperspirants come in 5 different forms: solids, clear gels, sprays, roll-ons and cream.&lt;ref name=Arrid&gt;{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions|url=http://www.arrid.com/faq.aspx|publisher=Arrid|accessdate=27 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advertising==
During the 1940s and '50s, its famous slogan was "Don't be ''half-safe''—use Arrid to be sure", which gave rise to ''Half-Safe'', the name of the amphibious vehicle which [[Ben Carlin]] used to circumnavigate the world in the mid 20th century.&lt;ref name="ambitious amphibious"&gt;Strohl, Daniel (2011). [http://blog.hemmings.com/index.php/2011/03/02/ambitious-amphibious-ben-carlins-round-the-world-trek-in-a-ford-gpa/ Ambitious Amphibious: Ben Carlin’s round-the-world trek in a Ford GPA] – Hemmings Daily. Published 2 March 2011. Retrieved 2 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, Arrid was backed by a $14 million television campaign, $1.4 million in radio and $3 million in print support.&lt;ref name=ad&gt;{{cite web|last=Springe|first=Judith|title=Arrid set for major restaging this fall|url=http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising-branding/arrid-set-major-restaging-fall-bby-judith-springebbr-clearnonebr-clearnone|publisher=adweek|accessdate=27 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2000s, one of its most popular slogans was "Stress stinks! Arrid works!"

==Ingredients==
Each of Arrid's deodorants contain a different active ingredient. In their solid and clear gel deodorant, the active ingredient is aluminum zirconium tetrachlorohydrex gly. The active ingredient in their spray deodorant is [[Aluminium chlorohydrate|aluminum chlorohydrate]] and the active ingredient in their cream is [[aluminum sesquichlorohydrate]].&lt;ref name=Arrid /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9773">'''Automated mining''' involves the removal of human labor from the [[mining]] process.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/business/mining-energy/rio-to-trial-automated-mining/story-e6frg9df-1111115351260 ''Rio to trial automated mining''] at The Australian&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Mining#Mining industry|mining industry]] is in the transition towards [[automation]]. It can still require a large amount of [[human capital]], particularly in the [[third world|developing world]] where labor costs are low so there is less incentive for increasing efficiency. There are two types of automated mining- process and software automation, and the application of robotic technology to mining vehicles and equipment.

==Mine automation software==
In order to gain more control over their operations, mining companies may implement mining automation software or processes. Reports generated by mine automation software allow administrators to identify productivity bottlenecks, increase accountability, and better understand [[return on investment]].

==Mining equipment automation==
Addressing concerns about how to improve productivity and safety in the mine site, some mine companies are turning to equipment automation consisting of robotic hardware and software technologies that convert vehicles or equipment into autonomous mining units.

Mine equipment automation comes in four different forms: remote control, [[teleoperation]], driver assist, and full automation.

===Remote control===
Remote control mining equipment usually refers to mining vehicles such as [[excavators]] or [[bulldozers]] that are controlled with a handheld remote control. An operator stands in line-of-sight and uses the remote control to perform the normal vehicle functions. Because visibility and feel of the machine are heavily reduced, vehicle productivity is generally reduced as well using remote control. Remote control technology is generally used to enable mining equipment to operate in dangerous conditions such as unstable terrain, blast areas or in high risk areas of falling debris, or underground mining. Remote control technology is generally the least expensive way to automate mining equipment making it an ideal entry point for companies looking to test the viability of robotic technology in their mine.

===Teleoperated mining equipment===
Teleoperated mining equipment refers to mining vehicles that are controlled by an operator at a remote location with the use of cameras, sensors, and possibly additional positioning software. [[Teleoperation]] allows an operator to further remove themselves from the mining location and control a vehicle from a more protected environment. Joysticks or other handheld controls are still used to control the vehicle's functions, and operators have greater access to vehicle telemetry and positioning data through the teleoperation software. With the operator removed from the cab, teleoperated mining vehicles may also experience reduced productivity; however, the operator has a better vantage point than remote control from on-vehicle cameras and sensors and is further removed from potentially dangerous conditions.

===Driver assist===
"Driver assist" refers to partly automated control of mining machines. Only some of the functions are automated and operator intervention is needed. Common functions include both spotting assist{{clarify|date=May 2016}} and [[collision avoidance system]]s.

===Full automation===
"Full automation" can refer to the autonomous control of one or more mining vehicles. Robotic components manage all critical vehicle functions including ignition, steering, transmission, acceleration, braking, and implement control (i.e. blade control, dump bed control, excavator bucket and boom, etc.) without the need for operator intervention. Fully autonomous mining systems experience the most productivity gains as software controls one or more mining vehicles allowing operators to take on the role of mining facilitators, troubleshooting errors and monitoring efficiency.

==Benefits==
The benefits of mining equipment automation technologies are varied but may include: improved safety, better fuel efficiency, increased productivity, reduced unscheduled maintenance, improved working conditions, better vehicle utilization, and reduced driver fatigue and attrition. Automation technologies are an efficient way to mitigate the effects of widespread labor shortages for positions such as haul truck driver. In the face of falling commodity prices, many mining companies are looking for ways to dramatically reduce overhead costs while still maintaining site safety and integrity; automation may be the answer.

==Drawbacks==
Critics of vehicle automation often focus on the potential for robotic technology to eliminate jobs while proponents counter that while some jobs will become obsolete (normally the dirty, dangerous, or monotonous jobs), others will be created. Communities supporting underprivileged workers that rely on entry level mining positions are worried about and are calling for social responsibility as mining companies transition to automation technologies that promise to increase productivity in the face of falling commodity prices. Risk averse [[mining companies]] are also reluctant to commit large amounts of capital to an unproven technology, preferring more often to enter the automation scene at lower, more inexpensive levels such as remote control.

==Examples of autonomous mining equipment==

===Mine of the future===
[[Rio Tinto Group]] embarked on their '''Mine of the Future''' initiative in 2008. From a control center in Perth, Rio Tinto employees operate autonomous mining equipment in Australia's remote but mineral rich Pilbara region. The autonomous mining vehicles reduce the footprint of the mining giant while improving productivity and vehicle utilization. As of June 2014,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.riotinto.com/media/media-releases-237_10603.aspx ''Press Release: Rio Tinto improves productivity through the world's largest fleet of owned and operated autonomous trucks'']&lt;/ref&gt; Rio Tinto's autonomous mining fleet reached the milestone of 200 million tons hauled. Rio Tinto also operate a number of autonomous blast hole drill rigs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.riotinto.com/media/media-releases-237_1719.aspx ''Rio Tinto and Atlas Copco announce autonomous drilling alliance'']&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bingham Canyon Mine===
Located near Salt Lake City, Utah, the [[Bingham Canyon Mine]] ([[Kennecott Utah Copper]]/Rio Tinto) is one of the largest open pit mine in the world and one of the world's largest copper producers. In April 2013, the mine experienced a catastrophic landslide that halted much of the mine's operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.miningaustralia.com.au/news/second-landslide-hits-rio-s-bingham-canyon-mine-10 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-09-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927014324/http://www.miningaustralia.com.au/news/second-landslide-hits-rio-s-bingham-canyon-mine-10 |archivedate=2013-09-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the cleanup efforts and to improve safety, mine administrators turned to remote control excavator, dozers and teleremote blast hole drills to perform work on the highly unstable terrain areas. Robotic technology helped Kennecott to reduce the steeper, more dangerous areas of the slide to allow manned vehicles access for cleanup efforts.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

=== Automation of underground works in China ===
German company «EEP Elektro-Elektronik Pranjic» delivered and put into operation more than 60 sets of advanced automatic control for underground coal mining for the period ~ 2006-2016. For the first time completely deserted coal mining technology has been used by the Chinese concern «China National Coal Group Corp. (CME)» at the mine «Tang Shan Gou» ([[longwall mining]], shearers, three lava, depth 200 m), and at the mine «Nan Liang» (one plow, depth 100 m). Both coal mines have coal layer thickness 1-1.7 m. 
Monitoring the harvesting is carried out by means of video cameras (in real time with signal transmission over [[Optical fiber cable|optical fiber]]). Typically, an underground staff is required to monitor the production process and for carrying out repairs. Automation has improved the safety and economic performance.&lt;ref name="Уголь-02-2016"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Song|first=Gang|date=February 2016|title=Experience in the implementation of process automation and data communication for underground coal mining on the example of China's coal industry [Опыт внедрения автоматизации процессов подземной добычи угля на примере китайской угольной промышленности]|journal=Ugol [Уголь], Russian Coal Journal|publisher=RF Ministry of Energy, Ugol' Journal Edition|location=Moscow|issue=2|pages=25–29|issn=0041-5790|doi=10.18796/0041-5790-2016-2-25-29|url=http://www.ugolinfo.ru/index.php?idmagyn=201602|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Next Generation Mining===
[[BHP Billiton|BHP]] have deployed a number of autonomous mining components as part of their Next Generation Mining program. This includes autonomous drills &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.itnews.com.au/news/bhp-billiton-hits-go-on-autonomous-drills-421008 "BHP Billiton hits go on Atlas Copco autonomous drills"]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[autonomous trucks]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mining.com/two-aussie-mines-start-moving-all-their-iron-ore-with-driverless-trucks/ "BHP Billiton completed a trial of driverless trucks"]&lt;/ref&gt; in the Pilbara region.

'''BPAY''' is an [[electronic bill payment]] system in [[Australia]] which enables payments to be made through a [[financial institution]]'s [[online banking|online]], mobile or [[telephone banking]] facility to organisations which are registered BPAY billers.

BPAY is a registered trading name of BPAY Pty Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary of Cardlink Services Limited. Cardlink is owned equally by the four major Australian banks: [[Australia and New Zealand Banking Group]], [[Commonwealth Bank]], [[National Australia Bank]] and [[Westpac]].&lt;ref name="aboutbpay"&gt;[http://www.bpay.com.au/About-BPAY/Overview.aspx About BPAY, Overview]. Retrieved January 2015 &lt;/ref&gt;

== How it works ==
Businesses or other organisations which choose to participate in the BPAY system would register as billers with the BPAY operating company through its bank. The operating company would allocate a biller number to the business, which would be printed with the BPAY logo on their bills, as well as an indication of what reference number a customer should use when making a payment. 

To make a payment, a customer would visit his or her financial institution's online, mobile or telephone banking facility, where he or she would enter the biller code, reference number and payment amount as well as an indication of the account to be debited, which may also be a credit card. Some billers do not accept credit cards (or accept payment from a limited list of credit cards) in payment through BPAY. The financial institution may limit the accounts which may be used for BPAY payments, and save the biller references information for use by the customer for future payments. 

The customer does not need to register for the service. The customer would usually not be required to pay a fee for the service, but the biller would usually pay a fee to its bank, and the credit card company if a card was used in payment.

After a customer has made a payment using BPAY, the financial institution where the payment was made would send by [[electronic funds transfer]] the payment details to the biller's bank (if different) and the biller's bank would credit the biller's designated bank account with the payment amount, and the biller will be advised of the customer reference number and payment amount, for automatic or manual entry into its accounting system. Transactions completed before a cut-off time set by the financial institution will normally be processed and paid on the same day, otherwise it will be processed on the next business day. The remitting bank may charge the biller's bank an [[interchange fee]].

== History ==
The BPAY system was launched on 18 November 1997 as an [[electronic bill payment]] system for bill payments by phone. It was the world's first single bill payment service adopted across the banking sector.&lt;ref name="aboutbpay" /&gt; It soon offered bill payments over the Internet through financial institutions' online banking sites.

In 2002 BPAY View was introduced, which delivers bills and statements electronically through Australian financial institution's internet banking sites.&lt;ref name="aboutbpay" /&gt;

As of January 2015, BPAY payments can be made through more than 156 participating Australian banks, credit unions and financial institutions.&lt;ref name="aboutbpay" /&gt; More than 45,000 businesses accept payments using BPAY&lt;ref name="aboutbpay" /&gt; and each month approximately 30 million bills to the value of $24 billion are paid using BPAY.&lt;ref name="aboutbpay" /&gt;

'''Barley''' (''Hordeum vulgare''), a member of the [[Poaceae|grass family]], is a major [[cereal grain]] grown in [[temperate climate]]s globally. It was one of the first cultivated grains, particularly in [[Eurasia]] as early as 10,000 years ago.&lt;ref name = Zohary/&gt; Barley has been used as animal [[fodder]], as a source of fermentable material for [[beer]] and certain [[distilled beverage]]s, and as a component of various [[health food]]s. It is used in soups and stews, and in [[barley bread]] of various cultures. Barley grains are commonly made into [[malt]] in a traditional and ancient method of preparation.

In 2016, barley was ranked fourth among grains in quantity produced (141 million [[tonne]]s) behind [[maize]], [[rice]] and [[wheat]].&lt;ref name=faostat16/&gt;

==Etymology==
[[File:Barley Seeds.jpg|thumb|Barley seeds with and without the outer husk.]]
The [[Old English]] word for 'barley' was ''bære'', which traces back to [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] and is cognate to the [[Latin]] word ''farina'' "flour".  The direct ancestor of modern English "barley" in Old English was the derived adjective ''bærlic,'' meaning "of barley".&lt;ref name=Ayto1990/&gt;  The first citation of the form ''bærlic'' in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' dates to around 966 CE, in the compound word ''bærlic-croft''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=barley|encyclopedia=Oxford English Dictionary|editor1=J. Simpson |editor2=E. Weiner |year=1989|edition=2nd|location=Oxford|publisher=Clarendon Press|isbn=0-19-861186-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
The underived word ''bære'' survives in the north of Scotland as ''[[Bere (grain)|bere]]'', and refers to a specific strain of six-row barley grown there.&lt;ref name=DSLbear&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dsl.ac.uk/dsl/getent4.php?plen=18327&amp;startset=1964317&amp;query=BEAR&amp;fhit=bere&amp;dregion=form&amp;dtext=snd#fhit |title=''Dictionary of the Scots Language'': "DSL - DOST Bere, Beir" |access-date=2008-11-19 |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110526194225/http://www.dsl.ac.uk/dsl/getent4.php?plen=18327&amp;startset=1964317&amp;query=BEAR&amp;fhit=bere&amp;dregion=form&amp;dtext=snd |archive-date=2011-05-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The word [[barn]], which originally meant "barley-house", is also rooted in these words.&lt;ref name=Ayto1990/&gt;

[[File:CSIRO ScienceImage 11626 Barley root.jpg|thumb|The cross-section of a barley root]]
Barley is a member of the [[Poaceae|grass family]]. It is a [[self-pollination|self-pollinating]], [[diploid]] species with 14 [[chromosome]]s.  The wild ancestor of domesticated barley, ''Hordeum vulgare'' subsp. ''spontaneum'', is abundant in grasslands and woodlands throughout the [[Fertile Crescent]] area of Western Asia and northeast Africa, and is abundant in [[secondary succession|disturbed habitats]], roadsides and orchards. Outside this region, the wild barley is less common and is usually found in disturbed habitats.&lt;ref name = Zohary&gt;{{cite book|last=Zohary|first=Daniel| first2 = Maria | last2 = Hopf | name-list-format = vanc |title=Domestication of Plants in the Old World: The Origin and Spread of Cultivated Plants in West Asia, Europe, and the Nile Valley |edition=3rd |year=2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-850357-1|pages= 59–69}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in a study of genome-wide diversity markers, [[Tibet]] was found to be an additional center of domestication of cultivated barley.&lt;ref name="Fei Dai"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dai F, Nevo E, Wu D, Comadran J, Zhou M, Qiu L, Chen Z, Beiles A, Chen G, Zhang G | title = Tibet is one of the centers of domestication of cultivated barley | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 109 | issue = 42 | pages = 16969–73 | date = October 2012 | pmid = 23033493 | pmc = 3479512 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1215265109 | displayauthors = 6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Domestication===
Wild barley (''H. spontaneum'') is the ancestor of domestic barley (''H. vulgare'') and harbours distinctive [[gene]]s, [[allele]]s and regulators with potential for resistance to [[abiotic]] or [[biotic stress]]es to cultivated barley and adaptation to climatic changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wang X, Chen ZH, Yang C, Zhang X, Jin G, Chen G, Wang Y, Holford P, Nevo E, Zhang G, Dai F | title = Genomic adaptation to drought in wild barley is driven by edaphic natural selection at the Tabigha Evolution Slope | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 115 | issue = 20 | pages = 5223–5228 | date = May 2018 | pmid = 29712833 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1721749115 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wild barley has a brittle [[spike (botany)|spike]]; upon maturity, the [[spikelet]]s separate, facilitating [[seed dispersal]].  Domesticated barley has [[shattering (agriculture)|nonshattering]] spikes, making it much easier to harvest the mature ears.&lt;ref name = Zohary/&gt;  The nonshattering condition is caused by a [[mutation]] in one of two [[Genetic linkage|tightly linked]] genes known as Bt&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and Bt&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;; many [[cultivar]]s possess both mutations. The nonshattering condition is [[recessive]], so varieties of barley that exhibit this condition are [[homozygous]] for the mutant [[allele]].&lt;ref name = Zohary/&gt;

Each plant gets a set of genes from both parents, so two copies of each gene are in every plant. If one gene copy is a nonworking mutant, but the other gene copy works, the mutation has no effect.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} Only when the plant is [[homozygous]] with both copies of the gene as nonworking [[mutant]]s does the mutation show its effect by exhibiting the nonshattering condition.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Domestication in barley is followed by the change of key [[phenotype|phenotypic traits]] at the genetic level. Little is known about the [[genetic variation]] among domesticated and wild genes in the [[chromosome|chromosomal]] regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yan S, Sun D, Sun G | title = Genetic divergence in domesticated and non-domesticated gene regions of barley chromosomes | journal = PLOS One | volume = 10 | issue = 3 | pages = e0121106 | date = 2015-03-26 | pmid = 25812037 | pmc = 4374956 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0121106 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Two-row and six-row barley&lt;!--Numerous terms redirect here; see https://tools.wmflabs.org/dispenser/cgi-bin/backlinkscount.py?title=Barley --&gt;===
[[File:BarleyEars.JPG|thumb|upright|Two-row and six-row barley]]

Spikelets are arranged in triplets which alternate along the [[rachis]]. In wild barley (and other [[Old World]] species of ''Hordeum''), only the central spikelet is fertile, while the other two are reduced. This condition is retained in certain cultivars known as two-row barleys. A pair of mutations (one dominant, the other recessive) result in fertile lateral spikelets to produce six-row barleys.&lt;ref name = Zohary/&gt; Recent genetic studies have revealed that a mutation in one gene, ''vrs1'', is responsible for the transition from two-row to six-row barley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Komatsuda T, Pourkheirandish M, He C, Azhaguvel P, Kanamori H, Perovic D, Stein N, Graner A, Wicker T, Tagiri A, Lundqvist U, Fujimura T, Matsuoka M, Matsumoto T, Yano M | title = Six-rowed barley originated from a mutation in a homeodomain-leucine zipper I-class homeobox gene | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 104 | issue = 4 | pages = 1424–9 | date = January 2007 | pmid = 17220272 | pmc = 1783110 | doi = 10.1073/pnas.0608580104 | displayauthors = 8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two-row barley has a lower protein content than six-row barley, thus a more fermentable sugar content. High-[[protein]] barley is best suited for animal feed. Malting barley is usually lower protein&lt;ref name="IPNI"&gt;

("low grain nitrogen", usually produced without a late fertilizer application) which shows more uniform germination, needs shorter steeping, and has less protein in the extract that can make beer cloudy. Two-row barley is traditionally used in English [[ale]]-style beers. Six-row barley is common in some American [[lager]]-style beers, especially when [[adjuncts]] such as corn and rice are used, whereas two-row malted summer barley is preferred for traditional [[German beer]]s.

===Hulless barley===
Hulless or "naked" barley (''Hordeum vulgare ''L. var.'' nudum'' Hook. f.) is a form of domesticated barley with an easier-to-remove [[Husk|hull]]. Naked barley is an ancient food crop, but a new industry has developed around uses of selected hulless barley to increase the digestible energy of the grain, especially for swine and poultry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bhatty RS | title = The potential of hull-less barley | journal = Cereal Chemistry | year = 1999 | volume = 76 | pages = 589–599 | doi = 10.1094/CCHEM.1999.76.5.589 | issue = 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hulless barley has been investigated for several potential new applications as whole grain, and for its value-added products. These include bran and flour for multiple food applications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bhatty RS | title = &amp;beta;-glucan and flour yield of hull-less barley | journal = Cereal Chemistry | year = 2011 | volume = 76 | pages = 314–315 | doi = 10.1094/CCHEM.1999.76.2.314 | issue = 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Classification ===
[[File:Hordeum-barley.jpg|thumb|upright|Barley]]

In traditional classifications of barley, these morphological differences have led to different forms of barley being classified as different species. Under these classifications, two-row barley with shattering spikes (wild barley) is classified as ''Hordeum spontaneum'' [[Karl Koch (botanist)|K. Koch]]. Two-row barley with nonshattering spikes is classified as ''H. distichum'' [[L.]], six-row barley with nonshattering spikes as ''H. vulgare'' L. (or ''H. hexastichum'' L.), and six-row with shattering spikes as ''H. agriocrithon'' Åberg.

Because these differences were driven by single-gene mutations, coupled with [[cell biology|cytological]] and [[molecular biology|molecular]] evidence, most recent classifications treat these forms as a single species, ''H. vulgare'' L.&lt;ref name = Zohary/&gt;

''The Mycenaean World'' pp 118f ''et passim''.&lt;/ref&gt; In mainland Greece, the ''ritual'' significance of barley possibly dates back to the earliest stages of the [[Eleusinian Mysteries]]. The preparatory ''[[kykeon]]'' or mixed drink of the initiates, prepared from barley and [[herb]]s, referred in the [[Homeric hymn]] to [[Demeter]], whose name some scholars believe meant "Barley-mother".&lt;ref name="cereals_and_cereal_products_technology_and_chemistry"&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = J.

== Genetics ==
The genome of barley was sequenced in 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mayer KF, Waugh R, Brown JW, Schulman A, Langridge P, Platzer M, Fincher GB, Muehlbauer GJ, Sato K, Close TJ, Wise RP, Stein N | title = A physical, genetic and functional sequence assembly of the barley genome | journal = Nature | volume = 491 | issue = 7426 | pages = 711–6 | date = November 2012 | pmid = 23075845 | doi = 10.1038/nature11543 | url = http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/nature11543 | displayauthors = 8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; due to the efforts of the International Barley Genome Sequencing Consortium and the UK Barley Sequencing Consortium.

The genome is composed of seven pairs of nuclear chromosomes (recommended designations: 1H, 2H, 3H, 4H, 5H, 6H and 7H), and one mitochondrial and one chloroplastic chromosome, with a total of 5000 Mbp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/mapview/map_search.cgi?chr=barley.inf|title=barley genome at ncbi.nlm.nih.gov|author=mapview|publisher=|access-date=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abundant biological information is already freely available in several barley databases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.barleygenome.org.uk/resources Barley-resources]&lt;/ref&gt;

The wild barley (''H. vulgare'' ssp.'' spontaneum'') found currently in the [[Fertile Crescent]] might not be the progenitor of the barley cultivated in [[Eritrea]] and [[Ethiopia]], indicating that separate domestication may have occurred in eastern Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Orabi J, Backes G, Wolday A, Yahyaoui A, Jahoor A | title = The Horn of Africa as a centre of barley diversification and a potential domestication site | journal = TAG.

In 2016, world production of barley was 141 million tonnes, led by the [[European Union]] producing 41% of the world total. [[Russia]], [[Germany]], [[France]], and [[Ukraine]] were major producers.&lt;ref name=faostat16/&gt;

== Cultivation ==
[[File:Barley-Turkyurdu Village-Gaziantep-ali riza.jpg|thumb|Barley harvesting in [[Gaziantep]], [[Turkey]] ]]
Barley is a widely adaptable crop. It is currently popular in temperate areas where it is grown as a summer crop and tropical areas where it is sown as a [[winter crop]]. Its [[germination]] time is one to three days. Barley grows under cool conditions, but is not particularly [[Hardiness (plants)#Winter hardiness|winter hardy]].

Barley is more tolerant of [[soil salinity]] than wheat, which might explain the increase of barley cultivation in [[Mesopotamia]] from the second millennium BCE onwards. Barley is not as cold tolerant as the winter wheats (''Triticum aestivum''), fall [[rye]] (''Secale cereale'') or winter [[triticale]] (× ''Triticosecale'' Wittm. ex A. Camus.), but may be sown as a winter crop in warmer areas of  [[Australia]] and [[Great Britain]].

Barley has a short growing season and is also relatively drought tolerant.&lt;ref name=Mcgee235&gt;{{harvnb|McGee|1986|p=235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It can be susceptible to many diseases, but plant breeders have been working hard to incorporate resistance.  The devastation caused by any one disease will depend upon the susceptibility of the variety being grown and the environmental conditions during disease development. Serious diseases of barley include powdery mildew caused by ''[[Blumeria graminis]]'' f.sp. ''hordei'', leaf scald caused by ''[[Rhynchosporium secalis]]'', barley rust caused by ''Puccinia hordei'', crown rust caused by ''[[Puccinia coronata]]'', and various diseases caused by ''[[Cochliobolus sativus]]''. Barley is also susceptible to [[Fusarium ear blight|head blight]].

===Nutrition===
[[File:Various grains.jpg|thumb|left|Barley, oats, and some products made from them]]
In a 100-g serving, raw barley provides 352 [[Calories]] and is a rich source (20% or more of the [[Daily Value]], DV) of [[essential nutrients]], including [[protein]], [[dietary fiber]], the [[B vitamins]], [[niacin]] (31% DV) and [[vitamin B6|vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]] (20% DV), and several [[dietary minerals]] (table). Highest nutrient contents are for [[manganese]] (63% DV) and [[phosphorus]] (32% DV) (table). Raw barley is 78% [[carbohydrates]], 1% [[fat]], 10% [[protein]], and 10% water (table).

===Preparation===

Hulled barley (or covered barley) is eaten after removing the inedible, fibrous, outer hull. Once removed, it is called dehulled barley (or pot barley or scotch barley).&lt;ref name=Simon&gt;Simon, André (1963). ''Guide to Good Food and Wines: A Concise Encyclopedia of Gastronomy Complete and Unabridged''. p. 150 Collins, London&lt;/ref&gt; Considered a [[whole grain]], dehulled barley still has its [[bran]] and [[Cereal germ|germ]], making it a nutritious and popular [[Healthy diet|health food]]. [[Pearl barley]] (or pearled barley) is dehulled barley which has been steam processed further to remove the bran.&lt;ref name=Simon/&gt; It may be polished, a process known as "pearling". Dehulled or pearl barley may be processed into a variety of barley products, including [[flour]], flakes similar to [[oatmeal]], and [[grits]].

Barley meal, a wholemeal [[barley flour]] lighter than wheat meal but darker in colour, is used in [[porridge]] and [[gruel]] in [[Scotland]].&lt;ref name=Simon/&gt; Barley meal gruel is known as ''sawiq'' in the [[Arab world]].&lt;ref name=Tabarip89&gt;{{cite book|title=The History of Al-Tabari: The Foundation of the Community: Muhammad at Al-Madina, A.

===Health implications===
[[File:Budvar-mug.JPG|thumb|left|The [[Reinheitsgebot]] law of 15th century [[Holy Roman Empire]] allowed barley as the only grain for brewing beer (Czech beer [[Budweiser Budvar]] depicted).]]

According to [[Health Canada]] and the US [[Food and Drug Administration]], consuming at least 3 grams per day of barley [[beta-glucan]] or 0.75 grams per serving of [[soluble fiber]] can lower levels of [[blood cholesterol]], a risk factor for [[cardiovascular diseases]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/cfrsearch.cfm?fr=101.81|title=21 CFR Part 101 [Docket No. 2004P-0512], Food Labeling: Health Claims; Soluble Dietary Fiber From Certain Foods and Coronary Heart Disease|publisher=US Food and Drug Administration|date=22 May 2006|access-date=2 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/fn-an/label-etiquet/claims-reclam/assess-evalu/barley-orge-eng.php|title=Summary of Health Canada's Assessment of a Health Claim about Barley Products and Blood Cholesterol Lowering|publisher=Health Canada|date=12 July 2012|access-date=2 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eating whole-grain barley, as well as other grains with lots of fiber, improves regulation of [[blood sugar]] (i.e., reduces blood glucose response to a meal).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Harris KA, Kris-Etherton PM | title = Effects of whole grains on coronary heart disease risk | journal = Current Atherosclerosis Reports | volume = 12 | issue = 6 | pages = 368–76 | date = November 2010 | pmid = 20820954 | doi = 10.1007/s11883-010-0136-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Consuming [[breakfast cereal]]s containing barley over weeks to months also improved cholesterol levels and glucose regulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Williams PG | title = The benefits of breakfast cereal consumption: a systematic review of the evidence base | journal = Advances in Nutrition | volume = 5 | issue = 5 | pages = 636S-673S | date = September 2014 | pmid = 25225349 | pmc = 4188247 | doi = 10.3945/an.114.006247 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like [[wheat]], [[rye]], and their hybrids and derivatives, barley contains [[gluten]], which makes it an unsuitable grain for consumption by people with [[gluten-related disorders]], such as [[celiac disease]], [[non-celiac gluten sensitivity]] and [[wheat allergy]] sufferers, among others.&lt;ref name=TovoliMasi&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tovoli F, Masi C, Guidetti E, Negrini G, Paterini P, Bolondi L | title = Clinical and diagnostic aspects of gluten related disorders | journal = World Journal of Clinical Cases | volume = 3 | issue = 3 | pages = 275–84 | date = March 2015 | pmid = 25789300 | pmc = 4360499 | doi = 10.12998/wjcc.v3.i3.275 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, some wheat allergy patients can tolerate barley or rye.&lt;ref name=Pietzak&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pietzak M | title = Celiac disease, wheat allergy, and gluten sensitivity: when gluten free is not a fad | journal = JPEN.

[[Barley wine]] is a style of strong beer from the English brewing tradition.  Another alcoholic drink known by the same name, enjoyed in the 18th century,  was prepared by boiling barley in water, then mixing the barley water with white wine and other ingredients, such as [[borage]], lemon and sugar. In the 19th century, a different barley wine was made prepared from recipes of ancient Greek origin.&lt;ref name=Ayto1990/&gt;

In Italy, barley is also sometimes used as coffee substitute, ''[[caffè d'orzo]]'' (coffee of barley). This drink is obtained from ground, roasted barley and it is prepared as an espresso (it can be prepared using percolators, filter machines or cafetieres). It became widely used during the  Fascist period and WWII, as Italy was affected by embargo and struggled to import coffee. It was also a cheaper option for poor families (often grown and roasted at home) in the period. Afterwards, it was promoted and sold as a coffee substitute for children. Nowadays, it is experiencing a revival and it can be considered some Italians' favourite alternative to coffee when, for health reasons, caffeine drinks are not recommended.

Barley straw, in [[England]], is placed in mesh bags and floated in fish ponds or water gardens to help prevent algal growth without harming pond plants and animals. Barley straw has not been approved by the EPA for use as a pesticide and its effectiveness as an algae regulator in ponds has produced mixed results, with either more efficacy against phytoplankton algae versus mat-forming algae, or no significant change, during university testing in the US and the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.btny.purdue.edu/pubs/APM/APM-1-W.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030408210226/http://www.btny.purdue.edu/Pubs/APM/APM-1-W.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2003-04-08|title=Barley straw for algae control|author=Lembi, Carole A|publisher=Department of Botany and Plant Pathology, Purdue University, West Lafayette, Indiana}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Measurement===
Barley grains were used for measurement in England, there being three or four [[Barleycorn (unit)|barleycorns]] to the inch and four or five [[poppy seed]]s to the barleycorn.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://dictionary.oed.com|title=Oxford English Dictionary|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2009|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The statute definition of an inch was three barleycorns, although by the 19th century, this had been superseded by standard inch measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://books.google.com/?id=rJhOFg1yiqUC|page=436|title=The Penny Cyclopædia of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge|author=George Long|year=1842|publisher=C.

As modern studies show, the actual length of a kernel of barley varies from as short as {{convert|4-7|mm|in|abbr=on}} to as long as {{convert|12-15|mm|in|abbr=on}} depending on the cultivar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ullrich|first1=Steven E. | name-list-format = vanc |title=Barley: Production, Improvement, and Uses|date=2011|page=454|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4nFfyy66UioC&amp;pg=PA545|isbn=9780470958629}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sýrkorová|first1=Alena | name-list-format = vanc |title=Size Distribution of Barley Kernels|journal=Czech Journal of Food Sciences|date=2009|volume=27|issue=4|pages=249–58|url=http://www.agriculturejournals.cz/publicFiles/10118.pdf|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Older sources claimed the average length of a grain of barley being {{convert|0.345|in|mm|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Supplement to the Encyclopædia Britannica|volume=2|date=1824|location=Edinburgh|page=462|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FMcnAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA462|chapter=Brewing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The barleycorn was known as ''arpa'' in Turkish, and the feudal system in [[Ottoman Empire]] employed the term ''arpalik'', or "barley-money", to refer to a second allowance made to officials to offset the costs of fodder for their horses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| vauthors = Houtsma M, Arnold TW, Wensinck AJ | title = E.J.

===Ornamental===
A new stabilized [[variegated]] variety of ''H. vulgare'', billed as ''H. vulgare'' varigate, has been introduced for cultivation as an ornamental and pot plant for pet cats to nibble.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.loghouseplants.com/images/catgrass2.pdf|title=Variegated Cat Grass}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural===

In English folklore, the figure of [[John Barleycorn]] in the [[folksong]] of the same name is a personification of barley, and of the alcoholic beverages made from it: beer and whisky. In the song, John Barleycorn is represented as suffering attacks, death, and indignities that correspond to the various stages of barley cultivation, such as reaping and malting.&lt;ref name="deVries76"&gt;{{cite book |last=de Vries |first=Ad | name-list-format = vanc |title=Dictionary of Symbols and Imagery |year=1976 |pages=34–35|publisher=North-Holland Publishing Company |location=Amsterdam |isbn=0-7204-8021-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6666">In [[agriculture]] and [[gardening]], a '''beneficial organism''' is any [[organism]] that benefits the growing process, including [[insect]]s, [[arachnid]]s, other [[animal]]s, [[plant]]s, [[bacteria]], [[fungus|fungi]], [[virus]]es, and [[nematode]]s. Benefits include [[pest control]], [[pollination]], and maintenance of [[soil health]]. The opposite of beneficial organisms are [[pest (animal)|pest]]s, which are organisms deemed detrimental to the growing process.There are many different types of beneficial organisms as well as beneficial microorganisms. Beneficial organisms include but are not limited to: Birds, Bears, Nematodes, Insects, Arachnids, and fungi. The ways that birds and bears are considered beneficial is mainly because they consume seeds from plant and spread them through feces. Birds also prey on certain  insects that eat plants and hinder them from growing these insects are known as non beneficial organisms. Nematodes are considered beneficial because they will help compost and provide nutrients for the soil the plants are growing in. Insects and arachnids help the growing process because they prey on non beneficial organisms that consume plants for food. Fungi help the growing process by using long threads of mycelium that can reach very long distances away from the tree or plant and bring water and nutrients back to the tree or plant roots.

==Beneficial or pest==
The distinction between ''beneficial'' and ''pest'' is arbitrary, subjectively determined by examining the effect of a particular organism in a specific growing situation.There are many different types of beneficial organisms as well as beneficial microorganisms. Beneficial organisms include but are not limited to: Birds, Bears, Nematodes, Insects, Arachnids, and fungi. The ways that birds and bears are considered beneficial is mainly because they consume seeds from plant and spread them through feces. Birds also prey on certain  insects that eat plants and hinder them from growing these insects are known as non beneficial organisms. Nematodes are considered beneficial because they will help compost and provide nutrients for the soil the plants are growing in. Insects and arachnids help the growing process because they prey on non beneficial organisms that consume plants for food. Fungi help the growing process by using long threads of mycelium that can reach very long distances away from the tree or plant and bring water and nutrients back to the tree or plant roots.

With beneficial organisms there is a flip side to these helpful organisms and that's the non beneficial organisms. These organisms hinder or stop the growing process or prey on beneficial organisms. Examples of these are Aphids, Assassin Bugs, and Japanese beetles. Aphids are attracted by pollen which is bad for plants because the aphids feed on the plants after they are located from spreading their pollen. Assassin Bugs are non beneficial because they feed on many beneficial insects by stabbing them with a horn on their head repeated times living up to its name "Assassin bug". Japanese beetles are especially a pest to gardeners and plants because the larva feed on the stems and roots while full grown beetles feed on leaves and flowers killing the plant.

===Insects===
[[Beneficial insect]]s can include predators (such as [[ladybug]]s) of pest insects, and [[pollinators]] (such as [[bee]]s, which are an integral part of the growth cycle of many crops). Increasingly certain species of insects are managed and used to intervene where natural pollination or biological control is insufficient, usually due to human disturbance of the balance of nature.

===Nematodes===
Certain microscopic [[nematodes]] (worms) are beneficial in destroying and controlling populations of larvae that are damaging or deadly to crops and other plants. They are commonly used in organic gardening for their ability to kill various kinds of harmful larvae ([[fungus gnat]]s, [[flea]] larvae, [[spidermite]]s, [[weevil]]s, [[Larva|grub]]s, [[rootworm]]s, [[cutworm]]s, etc.)

===Animals===
[[Bird]]s and other animals may, by their actions, improve conditions in various growing situations, and in such cases are also beneficials. Birds assist in the spread of seeds by ingesting the fruits and berries of plants, then depositing the seeds in their droppings. Other animals, such as raccoons, bears, etc. provide similar benefits.

===Plants===
Plants that perform positive functions can also be considered beneficials ([[companion planting]] is one technique based on principle of beneficial plants).

==Issues==

In agriculture, controversy surrounds the concept of beneficial insects. Much of this has to do with the effect of [[agrichemicals]], like [[insecticides]], [[herbicides]] and large quantities of synthetic [[fertilizers]], on what are considered beneficials. Citing the reduction or elimination of various organisms as a side effect of agrichemical-based farming, some argue that critical damage is being done to the [[ecosystem]], to the point where conventional agriculture is [[sustainability|unsustainable]]. For example, if bee populations are reduced by insecticides aimed at other pests, pollination is inhibited and crops don't appear. If soil microorganisms are killed off, natural [[soil regeneration]] is inhibited, and reliance on mechanical and chemical inputs to keep the soil viable is increased. The longer term impact of these conditions has not been determined. Commercial ventures currently exist to provide pollinators and [[biological pest control]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16750">[[Comité consultatif international pour la radio|CCIR]]  System '''B''' was the [[625-line]] analog broadcast [[television]] system which at its peak was the system used in most countries. It is being replaced across Western Europe, part of Asia and Africa by [[DVB-T|digital broadcasting]].

== Specifications ==

The system was developed for [[VHF]] band (part of RF band lower than 300&amp;nbsp;MHz.) Some of the most important specs are listed below.&lt;ref&gt;Reference Data for Radio Engineers, ITT Howard W.Sams Co., New York, 1977, section 30&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Channel spacing for CCIR television System B (VHF Bands).jpg|frame|Channel spacing for CCIR television System B (VHF Bands)&lt;br&gt;The separation between the aural and visual carriers is 5.5 MHz.]]
A frame is the total picture. The '''frame rate''' is the number of pictures displayed in one second. But each frame is actually scanned twice '''interleaving''' odd and even lines. Each scan is known as a field (odd and even fields.) So '''field rate''' is twice the frame rate. In each frame there are 625 '''lines''' (or 312.5 lines in a field.) So '''line rate''' (line frequency) is 625 times the frame frequency or 625•25=15625&amp;nbsp;Hz.

The '''video bandwidth''' is 5.0&amp;nbsp;MHz. The video signal modulates the carrier by [[Amplitude Modulation]]. But a portion of the lower side band is suppressed. This technique is known as vestigial side band modulation ('''AC3'''). The polarity of modulation is negative, meaning that an increase in the instantaneous brightness of the [[video signal]] results in a decrease in RF power and vice versa. Specifically, the sync pulses (being "blacker than black") result in maximum power from the transmitter.

The primary [[audio signal]] is modulated by [[Frequency modulation]] with a [[preemphasis]] '''time constant''' of τ = 50 μs. The '''deviation''' for a 1.0&amp;nbsp;kHz. AF signal is 50&amp;nbsp;kHz.

The separation between the primary audio FM subcarrier and the video carrier is 5.5&amp;nbsp;MHz.

The total '''RF bandwidth''' of System B (as originally designed with its single FM audio subcarrier) was 6.5&amp;nbsp;MHz, allowing System B to be transmitted in the 7.0&amp;nbsp;MHz wide channels specified for television in the VHF bands with an ample 500&amp;nbsp;kHz guard zone between channels.&lt;ref&gt;Nedim Ardoğa:TV Verici tekniğine giriş p.34&lt;/ref&gt;

In specs, sometimes, other parameters such as vestigial sideband characteristics and gamma of display device are also given.

=== Colour TV ===
System '''B''' has variously been used with both the [[PAL]] or [[SECAM]] colour systems. It could have been used with a 625-line variant of the [[NTSC]] color system, but apart from possible technical tests in the 1950s, this has never been done officially.

When used with PAL, the colour subcarrier is 4.43361875&amp;nbsp;MHz and the sidebands of the PAL signal have to be truncated on the high-frequency side at +570&amp;nbsp;kHz (matching the rolloff of the luminance signal at +5.0&amp;nbsp;MHz). On the low-frequency side, the full 1.3&amp;nbsp;MHz sideband is radiated. ( This behaviour would cause massive U/V crosstalk in the NTSC system, but delay-line PAL hides such artefacts. )

When used with SECAM, the 'R' lines' carrier is at 4.40625&amp;nbsp;MHz deviating from +350±18&amp;nbsp;kHz to -506±25&amp;nbsp;kHz. The 'B' lines' carrier is at 4.250&amp;nbsp;MHz deviating +506±25&amp;nbsp;kHz to -350±18&amp;nbsp;kHz.

Neither colour encoding system has any effect on the bandwidth of system '''B''' as a whole.

=== Improved audio===
Enhancements have been made to the specification of System B's audio capabilities over the years. The introduction of [[Zweiton]] in the 1970s allowed for stereo sound or twin monophonic audio tracks (possibly in different languages for instance). This was implemented by adding a second FM audio subcarrier at +5.74&amp;nbsp;MHz. Alternatively, starting in the late 1980s and early 1990s it became possible to replace the second audio FM subcarrier with a digital signal carrying [[NICAM]] sound. Either of these extensions to audio capability have eaten into the guard band between channels. Zweiton uses an extra 150&amp;nbsp;kHz. The alternative NICAM system uses an extra 500&amp;nbsp;kHz, and needs to be spaced further from the primary audio subcarrier, thus System B with NICAM has only 150&amp;nbsp;kHz guard zones between channels.

== Transmission channels ==
System '''B''' was the first internationally accepted [[625-line]] broadcasting standard in the world.{{Citation needed|reason=Need name and date of a corresponding international document, better with a link. Also, need dates for other standards to prove this one was accepted eariler.|date=July 2017}} The European 41-68&amp;nbsp;MHz [[Band I]] television allocation was agreed at the 1947 ITU (International Telecommunications Union) conference in 1947, and the first European channel plan (i.e. the use of channels E2&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;E4) was agreed in 1952 at the ITU conference in Stockholm. The extension to VHF [[Band III]] (i.e. Channels E5&amp;nbsp;-&amp;nbsp;E12) was also agreed in the 1950s.

Since then, the System B specification has been used with slightly different broadcast frequencies in many other countries.

Transmitters were operational on the above channels in 1959. During the 1960s, channels 1 to 3 were deleted and channels E3 to E12 adopted, bringing East Germany into line with the channel allocations used in the West.

=== Italy ===
Italian channel-spacings were erratic. System B is no longer in use in Italy, the switchover to DVB-T having been completed 4 July 2012.

Note: Unusually for Europe, Band III is used for DVB-T in Italy. At digital switchover time, Italy took the opportunity to discontinue their erratic System B frequencies, and the digital channels (known as Ch5 through Ch12) are regularly-spaced every 7.0&amp;nbsp;MHz from 177.5&amp;nbsp;MHz (and identical to Germany's Band III DVB-T bandplan).

===Australia VHF (until 1993)===
Australia were unique in the world by their use of [[Band II]] for television broadcasting.

‡ Channels 3, 4 and 5 were scheduled to be cleared during 1993-96 to make way for FM radio stations in Band II. This clearance action took much longer than was anticipated, and as a result, many stations on channel 3 still remain, along with a few on 4 and 5.

♦ New channel allocations from 1993.
&lt;br /&gt;
‡ Channels 10 and 11 were shifted up in frequency by 1&amp;nbsp;MHz to make room for channel 9A. The frequencies of existing stations did not change; only new ones used the new allocations. Digital multiplexes on channels 10 and 11 are using the new channel boundaries.

===Australia UHF===
Australia are nearly unique in the world for their use of 7&amp;nbsp;MHz channel-spacing (and therefore System B) on UHF.

== System G and H ==
When the UHF bands came into use in the early 1960s, two variants of System '''B''' began to be used on those frequencies.

In most countries, the channels on the UHF bands are 8&amp;nbsp;MHz wide, but in most system '''B''' countries transmissions on the UHF channels still use system '''B''' specifications, the only difference being that the guard band between the channels is 1.0&amp;nbsp;MHz wider than for System B. That system for the UHF bands is known as [[CCIR System G|System G]] and all RF specifications given above (apart from the guard band width) also apply to system '''G'''. Exceptions to this would seem to be Australia, Brunei and Tanzania where the UHF channels are 7&amp;nbsp;MHz wide, and system '''B''' is used on UHF just as it is on VHF.

A few countries (Belgium, several of the Balkan states and Malta) use another variant of system '''B''' on UHF which is known as [[CCIR System H|System H]]. System '''H''' is similar to system '''G''' but the lower (vestigial) side band is 500&amp;nbsp;kHz wider. This makes much better use of the 8.0&amp;nbsp;MHz channels of the UHF bands (though whether any system B/H televisions actually made use of the extra bandwidth is not known).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6771">[[File:Managing cargo systems on an oil-chemical tanker.jpg|thumb|right|A modern CCR gives the PIC access to numerous monitoring and control systems]]

The '''cargo control room''', '''CCR''', or '''cargo office''' of a [[tankship]] is where the [[person in charge]] (PIC) can monitor and control the loading and unloading of the ship's liquid cargo.  Prevalent on automated vessels, the CCR may be in its own room, or located on the ship's [[Bridge (nautical)|bridge]].&lt;ref name="hub146"&gt;Huber 2001, p. 146.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hub147"&gt;Huber 2001, p. 147.&lt;/ref&gt;  Among other things, the equipment in the CCR may allow the person in charge to control cargo and stripping pumps, control and monitor valve positions, and monitor cargo tank liquid levels.

==History==
[[File:Tank discharge on an oil tanker.jpg|thumb|right|Many systems allow the PIC to monitor the ballast system and [[ship stability|ship's stability]] during load and discharge]]
Cargo control rooms began to appear on U.S.-[[flag state|flag]] tankers in the mid-1960s.&lt;ref name="g128"&gt;Gordon, 1993, p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt;  Prior to this time, valves were operated manually on deck by reach rods and liquid levels were monitored by a roving watch consisting of the [[licensed mariner#Deck officers|mate]] and [[able seaman|seamen]] on watch.&lt;ref name="g128"/&gt;  The use of computers in the cargo control room began in the 1980s.&lt;ref name="g129"/&gt;  As technology developed, computerized systems began to centralize tasks such as cargo control ''per se'', tank level monitoring, and real-time computation of hull stress information in the cargo control room.&lt;ref name="g129"/&gt;

==Characteristics==
[[File:Tank discharge on an oil tanker 2.jpg|thumb|right|Schematic showing various cargoes loaded, [[trim (ship)|trim]], and [[List (watercraft)|list]].]]
[[File:Tank discharge on an oil tanker 3.jpg|thumb|right|Monitoring systems that do not use computers are still often seen]]The design and layout of an individual cargo control room is determined by the ship's design, owner's requirements and the capabilities of the shipyard in which the ship is built.&lt;ref name="g128"/&gt;  Modern cargo control rooms offer some or all of these components: main cargo pump and stripping pump control, valve control, tank level monitoring, and auxiliary functions.&lt;ref name="g128"/&gt;

Main cargo pumps and stripping pumps are used to discharge cargo from the ship.  From the cargo control room, the person in charge of the discharge can typically turn pumps on and off, set pump speeds, and monitor pipeline pressures on the suction- and discharge-sides of pumps.&lt;ref name="g128"/&gt;&lt;ref name="g129"&gt;Gordon, 1993, p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt;

By actuating cargo valves, the person in charge can control where cargo is pumped from, where it is pumped to, and in systems that use [[throttle valve]]s, can control the relative flow rates of cargo through the valves.&lt;ref name="g129"/&gt;  Modern cargo control rooms allow the person in charge to remotely control some or all of the valves in the cargo system and monitor the state of all valves.&lt;ref name="g129"/&gt;  Valve indicators are typically laid out on a "mimic panel" which displays the cargo system piping, valves and pumps in a schematic diagram.&lt;ref name="g129"/&gt;
 
Tank level monitoring is another key functionality often provided in modern cargo control rooms.&lt;ref name="g129"/&gt;  One aspect of tank level monitoring is overfill alarms, which sound throughout the ship when cargo levels exceed the ship's design specifications.&lt;ref name="g129"/&gt;  Many systems allow the person in charge to monitor tank levels at all tank levels.  Tank level monitoring allows the person in charge to take early action to avoid [[oil spill]]s, especially when loading the ship.&lt;ref name="g129"/&gt;  Tank level information is often sent to computers that calculate hull stresses such as [[shear force]]s and [[bending moment]]s.&lt;ref name="g129"/&gt;

Various other functions are available in some cargo control rooms.&lt;ref name="g129"/&gt;  Many offer the person in charge additional monitoring and control systems,&lt;ref name="g129"/&gt; the ability to monitor [[inert gas system]]s,&lt;ref name="g129"/&gt; and tank pressures.&lt;ref name="g129"/&gt;  Modern cargo control rooms typically allow the person in charge to control ballast pumps and valves,&lt;ref name="g129"/&gt; and monitor oil content of [[ballast tank|ballast water]] by the use of [[Oily Water Separator (marine)|oily water separator]]s.&lt;ref name="g129"/&gt;  In cases where ships carry specialty products, specialized monitoring systems are available in the cargo control room.&lt;ref name="g129"/&gt;

* Human [[shoulder]]s designed to facilitate the hanging of a [[Coat (clothing)|coat]], [[jacket]], [[sweater]], [[shirt]], [[blouse]] or [[Dress (garment)|dress]] in a manner that prevents [[wrinkle]]s, with a lower bar for the hanging of [[trouser]]s or [[skirt]]s.
* [[Clamp (tool)|Clamp]] for the hanging of [[trouser]]s, [[skirt]]s, or [[kilt]]s. Both types can be combined in a single hanger.

There are three basic types of clothes hangers. The first is the wire hanger, which has a simple loop of wire, most often [[steel]]{{Citation needed|reason=Anecdotally it seems that more are made of brass. Material should be deleted in absence of source supporting either|date=January 2013}}, in a flattened triangle shape that continues into a hook at the top.  The second is the wooden hanger, which consists of a flat piece of wood cut into a [[boomerang]]-like shape with the edges sanded down to prevent damage to the clothing, and a hook, usually of metal, protruding from the point. Some wooden hangers have a rounded bar from tip to tip, forming a flattened triangle. This bar is designed to hang the trousers belonging to the jacket. The third kind and most used in today's world are plastic coat hangers, which mostly mimic the shape of either a wire or wooden hanger. Plastic coat hangers are also produced in smaller sizes to accommodate the shapes of children's clothes.

Some hangers have clips along the bottom for suspending [[skirt]]s. Dedicated skirt and trousers hangers may not use the triangular shape at all, instead using just a rod with clips. Other hangers have little rings coming from the top two bars to hang straps from tank-tops on.  Specialized pant hanger racks may accommodate many pairs of trousers. Foldable clothes hangers that are designed to be inserted through the collar area for ease of use and the reduction of stretching are an old, yet potentially useful variation on traditional clothes hangers. They have been patented over 200 times in the U.S. alone, as in U.S. Patent 0586456, awarded in 1897 to George E. Hideout.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US586456A/en|title=Coat-hanger|author=|date=|website=google.com|accessdate=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Some historians believe [[President of the United States|President]] [[Thomas Jefferson]] invented a forerunner&lt;ref&gt;[http://wiki.monticello.org/mediawiki/index.php/Image:Clothes_rack.jpg Jefferson encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt; of the wooden clothes hanger. However, today's most-used hanger, the shoulder-shaped wire hanger, was inspired by a coat hook that was invented in 1869  by O. A. North of [[New Britain, Connecticut]].&lt;ref&gt;https://patents.google.com/patent/US85756?oq=O.+A.+North&lt;/ref&gt; An employee of the Timberlake Wire and Novelty Company, Albert J. Parkhouse of [[Jackson, Michigan]] has also been credited with the invention.  The story goes that one morning in 1903, Parkhouse arrived to work to find that all coat hooks were taken.  Annoyed, he took a piece of wire, bent it into the shape we would recognize today, and hung his coat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ideafinder.com/history/inventions/coathanger.htm|title=Coat Hanger History - Invention of the Coat Hanger|first=Phil|last=Ament|date=|website=www.ideafinder.com|accessdate=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also credited is Christopher Cann in 1876 as an engineering student at Boston University.

In 1906 Meyer May, a men's [[Tailor|clothier]] of [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]], became the first retailer to display his wares on his [[Furcula|wishbone]]-inspired hangers.  Some of these original hangers can be seen at the [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] designed Meyer May House in Grand Rapids.

In 1932 [[Schuyler C. Hulett]] patented an improved design, which used [[Paperboard|cardboard]] tubes mounted on the upper and lower parts of the wire to prevent wrinkles, and in 1935 [[Elmer D. Rogers]] added a tube on the lower bar, which is still used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://inventors.about.com/od/famousinventions/fl/Who-Invented-The-Coat-Hanger.htm|title=Do You Know Who Invented the Coat Hanger?|access-date=2016-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hangers can be made in wood, wire, plastic, rarely from rubber substance and other materials.  Some are padded with fine materials, such as [[satin]], for expensive clothes, [[lingerie]] and fancy dresses. The soft, plush padding is intended to protect garments from shoulder dents that wire hangers may make. A caped hanger is an inexpensive wire clothing hanger covered in paper. Caped hangers are used by [[dry cleaning|dry cleaners]] to protect garments after cleaning. Used wire hangers may be recycled, or returned to the dry cleaner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nyc.gov/html/nycwasteless/html/wasteless/athome_tips_shopping_hanger.shtml | title=Hanger Reuse and Recycling | publisher=NYC Department of Sanitation | accessdate=24 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
A wire clothes hanger was also a featured prop in an iconic central scene in the [[1981 in film|1981]] [[film|movie]] ''[[Mommie Dearest (film)|Mommie Dearest]]'', in which [[Joan Crawford]], played by [[Faye Dunaway]] with cold cream all over her face, enters the room of her daughter, Christina, at night while  she sleeps, to admire the beautiful clothes hanging nicely in her [[closet]]. She then becomes enraged upon discovering that Christina has used a wire hanger, instead of the expensive padded hangers Joan provided and instructed her to use. Fearing that her dresses are ruined, Joan wakes her daughter in terror and gives her a thrashing. Joan's fierce cry of "No wire hangers, ever!" quickly worked its way into pop culture since wire hangers sometimes bring distortion in the clothes and tears holes through the fabric when not used properly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GBaR5Rymxg8C&amp;lpg=PA2&amp;pg=PA46#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title=Celebrity Tantrums!: The Official Dirt | publisher=ECW Press | author=Brandt, Lisa | year=2003 | pages=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Wire clothes hangers play a prominent part in the [[2008 in film|2008]] [[film|movie]] ''[[Birdemic: Shock and Terror]]''.  During a key scene in this "[[Romantic thriller]]" directed by James Nguyen, four terrified characters defend themselves against bloodthirsty hawks and vultures by waving wire hangers over their heads in the parking lot of a [[San Francisco Bay Area]] [[Motel 6]].

Unfolded wire clothes hangers, because of their purported use in performing illegal or [[self-induced abortion]]s (by inserting one in the uterus), have been used for [[pro-choice]] protests.&lt;ref&gt;Oakley, Doug.  "CA: Berkeley council sends coat hangers to protest health care bill's abortion restrictions", Oakland Tribune. 10 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fielding"&gt;Waldo L. Fielding, M.D., Tony Cenicola, ed., "[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/03/health/views/03essa.html?_r=1&amp; Repairing the Damage, Before Roe]", ''[[The New York Times]]'' (June 3, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unintended uses==
Wire is versatile, and wire clothes hangers are often used as cheap sources of semi-tough wire, more available than [[baling wire]] for all sorts of home projects.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} The use of wire clothes hangers for use as makeshift welding rod has been common for nearly 100 years.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} Similarly, many similar [[do-it-yourself]] and children's projects use wire hangers as holders of various types, from keeping a brake caliper from hanging by the brake line during auto repair work, to securing a gate on a bird cage. The much-loved 'Advent Crown' made for children's TV programme [[Blue Peter]] was made from four wire coathangers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/cult/classic/bluepeter/valpetejohn/scrapbook/page1.shtml|title=BBC - I Love Blue Peter - Trivia about Valerie Singelton, John Noakes, Peter Purves|author=|date=|website=www.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coathangers can be used to make [[dowsing]] rods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wikihow.com/Use-Dowsing-or-Divining-Rods|title=How to Use Dowsing or Divining Rods|author=|date=|website=wikihow.com|accessdate=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; After sanding, wire hangers also find uses as conducting wire for uses as varied as hot wiring cars to games &lt;ref&gt;[http://staff.washington.edu/chudler/chmemory.html#learn Neuroscience for Kids] University of Washington&lt;/ref&gt; to testing hand steadiness. They are commonly used to gain forcible entry into older automobiles whose locks and entry systems are not protected from such methods. There is a long history of using wire coat hangers as replacement car radio antennas. Clothes hangers are also commonly used as an implement for roasting [[marshmallow]]s or [[hot dog]]s at [[camp-out]]s.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

''[[Collecticus]]'' magazine reported in October 2007 that clothes hangers have now become collectible, especially those with a famous company or event advertised across the front. For example, a 1950 [[Butlins]] hanger sold for £10.10 in October 2006 within ''Collecticus''.

In 1995, while performing surgery in an airliner at 35,000 feet, orthopedic surgeon [[Angus Wallace]] and his fellow doctor Tom Wong used an unfolded coathanger, sterilised with brandy, as a [[trocar]] to stiffen a [[catheter]] for use as a [[chest tube]] to relieve a passenger's [[pneumothorax]].&lt;ref&gt;Anstead, Mike (9 June 2006) [https://www.theguardian.com/football/2006/jun/09/worldcup2006.sport14 "The Scot who raised England's hopes".] ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BMJ"&gt;{{cite journal|first=W.

Straightened-out wire clothes hangers have been used to perform [[Unsafe abortion|unsafe]] and/or [[illegal abortion]]s (frequently self-administered) by inserting them into the uterus in an attempt to extract the embryo or fetus, a method that entails serious risks to the life and health of the woman and the baby undergoing the procedure.&lt;ref name="Fielding" /&gt;

'''Copper zinc antimony sulfide''' is a relatively new class of [[semiconductor]], derived from copper antimony sulfide (CAS). Copper antimony sulfide, a famatinite class of compound, is being explored for [[photovoltaic]] applications. Other [[sulfosalt]] group compounds such as chalcostibite and [[tetrahedrite]] also exhibit photovoltaic properties. These materials show potential for applications such as  [[thin film solar cell]]s, [[Photoelectrochemical cell|photoelectrochemical]] [[hydrogen]] production, [[thermoelectricity]] production, and [[topological insulator]]s.

== History ==

In 1996, Finlay Cumming established Cumming LLC in [[Southern California]]. Between 2002 and 2006, Cumming opened new offices in [[Northern California]], [[Colorado]], [[Nevada]], [[Florida]], [[Arizona]], [[Texas]], and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. Later in 2006,&lt;ref&gt;[http://enr.construction.com/people/toplists/topcmfee/topcmfee_1-50.asp ENR's Top 100 CM for Fee] Engineering-News Record, June 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Cumming was named to [[Engineering News-Record|Engineering News-Record’s]] listing of the Top 100 CM-for-Fee firm in the United States, and continues to receive the honor, ranking in the top 40 every year since.&lt;ref&gt;[http://enr.construction.com/toplists/cm-fee/001-100.asp ENR's Top 100 Construction Management Firms Throughout the Years] Engineering-News Record, June 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the firm officially incorporated as Cumming Corporation and a year later in 2008, Cumming acquired Construction Controls Group (CCG), a Los Angeles-based program and project/construction management business. Shortly after the acquisition of CCG, Cumming acquired Southern Management Group (SMG),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.southernmanagementgroup.com/ Southern Management Group] Southern Management Group, January 2008&lt;/ref&gt; a South Carolina-based firm with more than 20 years of experience in program and project/construction management. Later in 2008, after several years working abroad, Cumming established Cumming International and opened its first overseas office in [[Abu Dhabi]]. 
== Present ==
Cumming currently has 37 offices across the U.S. and internationally with more than 620 employees. According to Engineering News-Record (ENR),&lt;ref&gt;[http://enr.construction.com/toplists/Top-CM-Fee-Firms/001-100.asp/ Construction Management-for-Fee Firms] Engineering News-Record, June 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Cumming has ranked among the top 40 [[construction management]] firms on its annual listing of the Top 100 CM-for-Fee Firms in the United States for the past six years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sdbj.com/news/2013/jun/17/cumming-moves-top-100-construction-management-list/ Cumming Moves Up on Top 100 Construction Management List] San Diego Business Journal, June 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''electrode array''' is a configuration of [[electrode]]s used for measuring either an [[electric current]] or [[voltage]]. Some electrode arrays can operate in a bidirectional fashion, in that they can also be used to provide a stimulating pattern of [[electric current]] or [[voltage]].

Common arrays include:
*Schlumberger (Wenner)
*Wenner alpha
*Wenner beta
*Wenner gamma
*Pole-pole
*Dipole-dipole
*Pole-dipole
*Equatorial dipole-dipole

==Resistivity==
Resistivity measurement of bulk materials is a frequent application of electrode arrays.  The figure shows a Wenner array, one of the possible ways of achieving this.&lt;ref&gt;Milsom, pp. 98–99.&lt;/ref&gt;  Injecting the current through electrodes separate from those being used for measurement of potential has the advantage of eliminating any inaccuracies caused by the injecting circuit resistance, particularly the contact resistance between the probe and the surface, which can be high.  Assuming the material is homogenous, the resistivity is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;\rho=2 \pi a \frac {V}{I} &lt;/math&gt;

Electrode arrays are widely used to measure resistivity in [[geophysics]] applications.&lt;ref&gt;Milsom, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also used in the semiconductor industry to measure the bulk resistivity of silicon wafers, which in turn can be taken as a measure of the [[doping (semiconductor)|doping]] that has been applied to the wafer, before further manufacturing processes are undertaken.&lt;ref&gt;Lark-Horovitz &amp; Johnson, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Empathy]] has been studied in the context of [[online communities]] as it pertains to enablers of interpersonal communication, [[Internet anonymity|anonymity]], as well as barriers to online relationships, such as ambiguity, [[cyberbullying]] and [[Internet troll]]ing.
It has been found that on online health support communities members tend to exhibit higher levels of empathic concern.&lt;ref name="Djikic 28–47"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Reading other minds: Effects of literature on empathy|url = http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/jbp/ssol/2013/00000003/00000001/art00006|journal = Scientific Study of Literature|date = 2013-01-01|access-date = 2015-04-20|pages = 28–47|volume = 3|issue = 1|doi = 10.1075/ssol.3.1.06dji|first = Maja|last = Djikic|first2 = Keith|last2 = Oatley|first3 = Mihnea C.|last3 = Moldoveanu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Empathic Exchanges in Online Cancer Support Groups: Distinguishing Message Expression and Reception Effects|journal = Health Communication|date = February 28, 2011|issn = 1041-0236|pmid = 21318917|pages = 185–197|volume = 26|issue = 2|doi = 10.1080/10410236.2010.544283|first = Jeong Yeob|last = Han|first2 = Dhavan V.|last2 = Shah|first3 = Eunkyung|last3 = Kim|first4 = Kang|last4 = Namkoong|first5 = Sun-Young|last5 = Lee|first6 = Tae Joon|last6 = Moon|first7 = Rich|last7 = Cleland|first8 = Q.

== Comparison/contrast with empathy in offline environments ==
A number of studies have explored the importance of empathy in offline settings. For example, one study found that mindfulness and acceptance-based behavioral approaches may have potential for increasing empathy in interpersonal relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The case for mindfulness-based approaches in the cultivation of empathy: Does nonjudgmental, present-moment awareness increase capacity for perspective-taking and empathic concern?|date = 2007|journal = Journal of Marital and Family Therapy|doi = 10.1111/j.1752-0606.2007.00034.x|pmid = 17935532|access-date = |volume=33 |issue = 4|pages=501–16 | last1 = Block-Lerner | first1 = J | last2 = Adair | first2 = C | last3 = Plumb | first3 = JC | last4 = Rhatigan | first4 = DL | last5 = Orsillo | first5 = SM}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other work has explored the link between fiction and empathy, suggesting that the experience-taking quality of fiction may increase empathy among readers.&lt;ref name="Djikic 28–47"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://faculty.psy.ohio-state.edu/libby/lab/Publications_files/Kaufman%26Libby2012.pdf|title = Changing beliefs and behavior through experience-taking|last = Kaufman; Libby|first = Geoff; LK|date = 2012|journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|doi = 10.1037/a0027525|pmid = 22448888|access-date =|volume=103|issue = 1|pages=1–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also evidence that individuals tend to more readily feel empathy for those that they view as similar to themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | access-date=2015-04-20 | url=http://spr.sagepub.com/content/20/3/267 | title=Empathy as an Interpersonal Phenomenon | date=June 1, 2003 | last=Håkansson | first=Jakob | last2=Montgomery | first2=Henry | journal=Journal of Social and Personal Relationships | volume=20 | issue=3 | pages=267–284 | issn=0265-4075 | doi=10.1177/0265407503020003001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In online contexts, several researchers have pointed out that there are some key differences in how users interact online that may affect levels of empathy. For example, communication in online forum communities interact asynchronously, and are generally text-based rather than verbal communications.&lt;ref name="Rice"&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Internet and Health Communication: Experiences and Expectations|url = https://books.google.com/?id=plZ2AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA237&amp;dq=Experiencing+Empathy+Online&amp;pg=PA237&amp;dq=Experiencing+empathy+online|publisher = SAGE Publications|date = 2000-11-17|access-date = 2015-04-20|isbn = 9781452264424|first = Ronald E.|last = Rice|first2 = James E.|last2 = Katz}}&lt;/ref&gt; Establishment of trust in online communities may also operate differently in online environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Patterns of Empathy in Online Communication|publisher = ACM|date = 2007|isbn = 978-1-59593-593-9|pages = 919–928|series = CHI '07|doi = 10.1145/1240624.1240763|first = Ulrike|last = Pfeil|first2 = Panayiotis|last2 = Zaphiris|journal=Proceedings of the SIGCHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems - CHI '07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, communications related interactions with others online might facilitate empathy while video or online gaming might negatively affect empathy.&lt;ref&gt;Carrier, L. Mark, Spradlin, A., Bunce, J. P., &amp; Rosen, L. D. (2015). Virtual empathy: Positive and negative effects of going online upon empathy in young adults, Computers in Human Behavior, 52, 39-48.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Enablers ==
* '''Anonymity. '''The anonymous nature of many online communities can allow individuals to feel more comfortable disclosing more personal information, which in turn can increase feelings of trust, connectedness and empathy.&lt;ref name="Rice"/&gt;
* '''Shared interests. '''Because empathy tends to be strongest among those that share common experiences, the presence of niche online communities can set the stage for higher levels of empathy among members.''' '''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Barriers ==
* '''[[Cyberbullying]]''' is any bullying that takes place using electronic media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What is Cyberbullying|url = http://www.stopbullying.gov/cyberbullying/what-is-it/|website = Stopbullying.gov|accessdate = 2015-04-20| publisher=[[United States Department of Health and Human Services]]|date = 2012-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;''' '''Studies have suggested that individuals who are bystanders, that is, witnessing someone bullying someone else, are less likely to intervene in online contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Cyberbullying among Adolescent Bystanders: Role of the Communication Medium, Form of Violence, and Empathy | doi=10.1002/casp.2137|volume=23|journal=Journal of Community &amp; Applied Social Psychology|pages=37–51|year = 2013 |last1 = Barlińska |first1 = Julia | last2=Szuster| first2=Anna| last3=Winiewski| first3=Mikołaj}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''[[Internet trolling]]''' is "the practice of behaving in a deceptive, destructive, or disruptive manner in a social setting on the Internet with no apparent instrumental purpose." Although empirical research on trolling is limited, studies have suggested that internet trolling may be a space occupied by already-sadistic individuals who can easily disrupt conversations and communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Trolls just want to have fun|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886914000324|accessdate = 2015-04-20|doi=10.1016/j.paid.2014.01.016|volume=67|journal=Personality and Individual Differences|pages=97–102|year = 2014|last1 = Buckels|first1 = Erin E.|last2 = Trapnell|first2 = Paul D.|last3 = Paulhus|first3 = Delroy L.}}&lt;/ref&gt;              
* '''Ambiguity.''' Because asynchronous, text-mediated online conversations lack the richness of interaction and cues that face-to-face interaction provides, online communication tends to be much more ambiguous. This ambiguity may decrease members' abilities to find similarities in one another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Getting to know you: Face-to-face versus online interactions|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S074756321000213X|accessdate = 2015-04-20|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2010.07.017|volume=27|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|pages=153–159|year = 2011|last1 = Okdie|first1 = Bradley M.|last2 = Guadagno|first2 = Rosanna E.|last3 = Bernieri|first3 = Frank J.|last4 = Geers|first4 = Andrew L.|last5 = McLarney-Vesotski|first5 = Amber R.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In both online and offline interactions, increased perceived similarity is associated with increased empathy.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = (Preece J.)

A '''gas explosion''' is an [[explosion]] resulting from mixing a [[gas]], typically from a [[gas leak]], with air in the presence of an [[Combustion|ignition]] source. In household accidents, the principal explosive gases are those used for heating or cooking purposes such as [[natural gas]], [[methane]], [[propane]], [[butane]]. In industrial explosions many other gases, like [[hydrogen]], as well as evaporated (gaseous) gasoline (American English)/petrol (British English) or ethanol play an important role. Industrial gas [[Industrial explosion|explosions]] can be prevented with the use of [[intrinsic safety]] barriers to prevent ignition.

==Lower and upper explosive limits==

Whether a mixture of air and gas is combustible depends on the [[Air–fuel ratio|air-to-fuel ratio]]. For each fuel, ignition occurs only within the explosive range (i.e. the Lower and upper explosive limits). For example, for [[methane]] and [[gasoline]] vapor, the explosive range is 5-15% and 1.4-7.6%&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mathesongas.com/pdfs/products/Lower-(LEL)-&amp;-Upper-(UEL)-Explosive-Limits-.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; gas to air, respectively.

* On September 15 2015 in [[Pennsville, New Jersey]] A [[main gas line explosion]] and subsequent fast-moving fire destroyed a modified house building, with a 2nd story apartment. The building was used as The Law Office's of John Jordan. 
Kline Construction, who are one of South Jersey Gas Company's contractors, was performing work in the area that was apart of a gas main and renewal project. Workers from Kline had punctured a [[natural main gas line]] nearby causing a [[gas leak]] into the basement of the building. With the buildings heat source being [[natural gas]] there was also a gas heater with a [[pilot light]] in the basement. As the gas built up, the heater's pilot light became the ignition source of this explosion. South Jersey Gas Company is a [[natural gas company]] that serves [[Salem County, NJ]] and also has offices in [[Atlantic County, NJ]] and [[Gloucester County, NJ]]. A year later the as company was fined $300,000.00 USD by the [[New Jersey Board of Public Utilities]] after their investigation found multiple safety violations. No-one was injured in the blast or fire. However, the neighboring homes of the building suffered smoke and structual damage as a result.

'''Hot melt coating''' is the application of a layer to a substrate by pre-melting the desired material and then allowing or forcing the material to cool, solidifying the layer.  The process is widely used in industry, particularly for [[pressure-sensitive adhesive]]s on thin substrates- self-adhesive [[label]]s.

==Introduction==
[[Coating]] is the application of a layer to a substrate.  In general, in order for a thin uniform layer to be applied, the application must be done at low or moderate viscosities.  In many cases this low viscosity is achieved by dissolving or dispersing the desired coating in a liquid such as water or a solvent, but this then necessitates the subsequent removal of the liquid by, for instance, a drying process. 
Hot-melt coating achieves this low to moderate viscosity by melting the desired material before applying it to the substrate.    The substrate and coated layer are then cooled, generally by passing over a chilled roller.   There is no liquid to remove, so the process is, in principle, much faster than water- or solvent-based equivalents.

==Terminology &amp; use==
The process has been used so extensively for the application of adhesive layers by slot-die coating that the use of the term ‘hot melt’ often implies slot-die coating, but hot melt methods have also been used for other coating processes, such as metering rod or roller coating.

==Transfer coating==
If the desired substrate is too temperature-sensitive to allow direct hot-melt coating, the product may be made by coating a transfer belt which is then brought into contact with the substrate after cooling: if the relative adhesion is correct then the coating will transfer to the new substrate from the transfer belt.

'''Isobutane''', also known as '''''i''-butane''','''2-methylpropane''' or '''methylpropane''', is a [[chemical compound]] with [[molecular formula]] HC(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. It is an [[isomer]] of [[butane]]. It is the simplest [[alkane]] with a [[carbon-carbon bond|tertiary carbon]]. Isobutane is used as a precursor molecule in the [[petrochemical industry]], for example in the synthesis of [[isooctane]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chemistry.org/portal/a/c/s/1/acsdisplay.html?DOC=patentwatch%5Carchive%5C073106_patentwatch.html Patent Watch, July 31, 2006.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
Isobutane is obtained by [[isomerization]] of butane.
:[[File:ButaneIsomerization.svg|240px]]

==Uses==
Isobutane is the principal feedstock in [[alkylation unit]]s of refineries.  Using isobutane, gasoline-grade "blendstocks" are generated with high branching for good combustion characteristics.  Typical products from isobutane are [[2,4-Dimethylpentane|2,4-dimethylpentane]] and especially [[2,2,4-Trimethylpentane|2,2,4-trimethylpentane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Alkylation|authors=Bipin V. Vora, Joseph A. Kocal, Paul T. Barger, Robert J. Schmidt, James A. Johnson|year=2003|encyclopedia=Kirk‐Othmer Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology|doi=10.1002/0471238961.0112112508011313.a01.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:2,4-Me2pentaneRoute.png|center|thumb|288 px|Typical acid-catalyzed route to [[2,4-Dimethylpentane|2,4-dimethylpentane]].]]

===Solvent===
In the Chevron Phillips slurry process for making [[high-density polyethylene]], isobutane is used as a diluent. As the slurried polyethylene is removed, isobutane is "flashed" off, and condensed, and recycled back into the loop reactor for this purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{Ullmann | title = Polyethylene | author = Kenneth S. Whiteley | doi = 10.1002/14356007.a21_487.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Precursor to tert-butyl hydroperoxide===
Isobutane is oxidized to tert-butyl hydroperoxide, which is subsequently reacted with [[propylene]] to yield [[propylene oxide]].  The [[tert-butanol]] that results as a by-product is typically used to make gasoline additives such as [[methyl tert-butyl ether]] (MTBE).

===Miscellaneous uses===
Isobutane is also used as a propellant for aerosol cans and [[foam]] products.

Isobutane is used as part of blended fuels, especially common in fuel canisters used for [[camping]].&lt;ref name="camp fuel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.backpackinglight.com/cgi-bin/backpackinglight/canister_stove_faq |title=Frequently Asked Questions About Lightweight Canister Stoves and Fuels |first=Will |last=Rietveld |publisher=Backpacking Light |date=2005-02-08 |accessdate=2014-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Refrigerant==
Isobutane is used as a [[refrigerant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/environment/ozone/pdf/hcfc_technical_meeting_summary.pdf |title=European Commission on retrofit refrigerants for stationary applications |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-10-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090805150605/http://ec.europa.eu/environment/ozone/pdf/hcfc_technical_meeting_summary.pdf |archivedate=2009-08-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The use in refrigerators started in 1993 when [[Greenpeace]] presented the Greenfreeze project with the German company Foron.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Page - March 15, 2010 |url=http://www.greenpeace.org/usa/en/campaigns/global-warming-and-energy/green-solutions/greenfreeze/ |title=GreenFreeze |publisher=Greenpeace |date=2010-03-15 |accessdate=2013-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this regard, blends of pure, dry "isobutane" (R-600a) (that is, isobutane mixtures) have negligible [[ozone depletion potential]] and very low [[global warming potential]] (having a value of 3.3 times the GWP of carbon dioxide) and can serve as a functional replacement for [[Dichlorodifluoromethane|R-12]], [[Chlorodifluoromethane|R-22]], [[1,1,1,2-Tetrafluoroethane|R-134a]], and other [[chlorofluorocarbon]] or [[hydrofluorocarbon]] [[refrigerant]]s in conventional stationary refrigeration and air conditioning systems.

As a refrigerant, isobutane poses an explosion risk in addition to the hazards associated with non-flammable CFC refrigerants. 
Substitution of this refrigerant for motor vehicle air conditioning systems not originally designed for isobutane is widely prohibited or discouraged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/ozone/snap/refrigerants/hc12alng.html |title=U.S. EPA hydrocarbon-refrigerants FAQ |publisher=Epa.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.astreappliancerepair.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/hc_white_paper.pdf Compendium of hydrocarbon-refrigerant policy statements, October 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.autoacforum.com/MACS/HCwarning.pdf |title=MACS bulletin: hydrocarbon refrigerant usage in vehicles |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-10-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110105174944/http://www.autoacforum.com/MACS/HCwarning.pdf |archivedate=2011-01-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sae.org/news/releases/05hydrocarbon_warning.htm |title=Society of Automotive Engineers hydrocarbon refrigerant bulletin |publisher=Sae.org |date=2005-04-27 |accessdate=2010-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.labour.gov.sk.ca/Default.aspx?DN=2fb5ac24-d90e-4408-bf40-559793bd8e96 |title=Saskatchewan Labour bulletin on hydrocarbon refrigerants in vehicles |publisher=Labour.gov.sk.ca |date=2010-06-29 |accessdate=2010-10-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090701025850/http://www.labour.gov.sk.ca/Default.aspx?DN=2fb5ac24-d90e-4408-bf40-559793bd8e96 |archivedate=2009-07-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vasa.org.au/content/refriggas/index.php#Bookmark%202 VASA on refrigerant legality &amp; advisability]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090113163519/http://www.vasa.org.au/content/refriggas/index.php#Bookmark |date=January 13, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energy.qld.gov.au/zone_files/petroleum_pdf/safety_alert025.pdf |title=Queensland (Australia) government warning on hydrocarbon refrigerants |publisher=Energy.qld.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2010-10-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217150006/http://www.energy.qld.gov.au/zone_files/petroleum_pdf/safety_alert025.pdf |archivedate=2008-12-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vendors and advocates of hydrocarbon refrigerants argue against such bans on the grounds that there have been very few such incidents relative to the number of vehicle air conditioning systems filled with hydrocarbons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/parlment/HansArt.nsf/V3Key/LA19971016015 |title=New South Wales (Australia) Parliamentary record, 16 October 1997 |publisher=Parliament.nsw.gov.au |date=1997-10-16 |accessdate=2010-10-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090701025536/http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/parlment/HansArt.nsf/V3Key/LA19971016015 |archivedate=1 July 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/parlment/hansart.nsf/V3Key/LC20000629051 |title=New South Wales (Australia) Parliamentary record, 29 June 2000 |publisher=Parliament.nsw.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2010-10-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050522080708/http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/parlment/hansart.nsf/V3Key/LC20000629051 |archivedate=22 May 2005 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nomenclature==
The traditional name isobutane was still retained in the 1993 [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry|IUPAC]] recommendations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Panico, R.; &amp; Powell, W. H. (Eds.) | title=A Guide to IUPAC Nomenclature of Organic Compounds 1993 | location=Oxford | publisher=Blackwell Science | year=1994 | isbn=0-632-03488-2}} http://www.acdlabs.com/iupac/nomenclature/93/r93_679.htm&lt;/ref&gt; but is no longer recommended according to the 2013 recommendations.&lt;ref name=iupac2013_652 /&gt; Since the longest continuous chain in isobutane contains only three carbon atoms, the [[preferred IUPAC name]] is 2-methylpropane but the [[locant]] (2-) is typically omitted in general nomenclature as redundant; C2 is the only position on a propane chain where a methyl substituent can be located without altering the main chain and forming the constitutional isomer ''n''-butane.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5225">'''Leah Rosenfeld''' (October 25, 1908 - November 12, 2006) was a railroad [[telegraph]] operator and station agent whose 1968 lawsuit against the [[Southern Pacific Railroad]] and the state of [[California]] helped to end job and wage discrimination against women and ensure equal opportunities for women in the [[railroad]] industry.

==Early life and beginning of railroad career==

At age 16 in 1924, Rosenfeld had worked as a clerk and paralegal in a law firm. In October 1944, then 36 years old, she began her career as a railroad telegrapher and station agent with the Southern Pacific Railroad after completing courses in telegraphy and clerical work. The railroads began to hire increasing numbers of women during [[World War II]] to replace the men drafted into military service; Rosenfeld took the job to help support her growing family, then consisting of nine children.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | title=Women and Railroading | author= Shirley Burman | work=Trains Railroad History, November 16, 2009 | url=http://trn.trains.com/en/Railroad%20Reference/Railroad%20History/2009/11/Women%20and%20Railroading.aspx | accessdate= 2011-05-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Employment as railroad operator – 1944–1955==

After her divorce in 1953, she became the sole support of 6 of her 12 children and worked in a number of one-operator stations, mostly in desert areas around the [[Salton Sea]] from [[Mecca, California]], to [[Yuma, Arizona]]. For a time, the family lived in a refrigerator car that Southern Pacific converted into housing with added screen porches. In 1955, a position opened in [[Saugus, California]], for an agent/telegrapher.  With ten years' seniority, Rosenfeld applied for the position.  The Southern Pacific Railroad denied her promotion from operator to station agent, citing the state of California's "women's protective laws" which barred women from lifting more than 25 pounds or working more than eight hours per day, both of which were required of station agents.  However, railroad workers were covered by the federal Railroad Labor Act, which did not distinguish between male and female workers.

Rosenfeld then protested to her union, the [[Order of Railroad Telegraphers]], noting that she had already performed the duties of a station agent in her previous employment, but earning a lower wage. However, the union did not support her claim.

==Suit against the State of California – 1968==

The railroad continued to reject her claims for promotion, citing the California state law that barred women from performing the duties of station agents. However, In 1964, the passage of the federal [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] and its [[Title VII]] made it illegal for employers to discriminate against women in hiring practices, and created the [[Equal Employment Opportunity Commission]] (EEOC) to redress employment grievances. When the Southern Pacific Railroad gave the position of agent/telegrapher at Thermal, California, to a man with less seniority in March 1966, she took her case to the EEOC, which advised her to file suit against the State of California.  On August 30, 1968, she filed suit against the State of California, the Southern Pacific Railroad, and her union, then known as the [[Transportation Communications International Union]].  On November 25, 1968, the suit against the Southern Pacific Railroad was settled and the California women's protective laws were declared unconstitutional. A subsequent appeal filed by the railroad in 1971 was also decided in Rosenfeld's favor.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web | title= 444 F.2d 1219: Leah Rosenfeld, Appellee, v. Southern Pacific Company, a Delaware Corporation, Appellant.leah Rosenfeld, Appellee, v. Southern Pacific Company, a Delaware Corporation, et al., Appellants | work= Justia US Law | url= http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/444/1219/340937/ | accessdate= 2011-05-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The outcome of the suit was a victory for Rosenfeld, who received her promotion and pay increase, and benefited all women railroad workers. As a result, the railroad industry began hiring women in all positions in 1971 at the same pay rate as men.

==Later life and retirement==

Rosenfeld was able to receive her promotion and pay adjustment shortly before she retired from the Southern Pacific in 1974. She spent the rest of her life in [[Mariposa, California]], where she was interviewed by railroad historian [[Shirley Burman]] and photographed by railroad photographer [[Richard Steinheimer]] in 1987. In her retirement, she helped to found the local animal shelter. She died in Mariposa in 2006.

'''Light tubes''' (also known as '''light pipes''' or '''tubular skylights''') are physical structures used for transmitting or distributing [[natural lighting|natural]] or artificial light for the purpose of [[Lighting|illumination]], and are examples of [[Waveguide (optics)|optical waveguides]].

In their application to [[daylighting]], they are also often called tubular daylighting devices, sun pipes, sun scopes, or daylight pipes. Light pipes may be divided into two broad categories: hollow structures that contain the light with reflective surfaces, and transparent solids that contain the light by [[total internal reflection]]. The principles governing the flow of light through these devices are those of [[nonimaging optics]].&lt;ref name="IntroNio2e"&gt;{{cite book | first = Julio | last = Chaves | title = Introduction to Nonimaging Optics, Second Edition | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=e11ECgAAQBAJ | publisher = [[CRC Press]] | year = 2015 | isbn = 978-1482206739 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160218223513/https://books.google.com/books?id=e11ECgAAQBAJ | archivedate = 2016-02-18 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===IR light pipes/IR light tubes===
Manufacturing custom designed Infrared light pipes, hollow waveguides and homogenizers is non-trivial.  This is because these are tubes lined with a highly polished infrared reflective coating of [[Laser Gold]], which can be applied thick enough to permit these tubes to be used in highly corrosive atmospheres. [[Laser Black]] can be applied to certain parts of light pipes to absorb IR light (see [[photonics]]). This is done to limit IR light to only certain areas of the pipe.

While most light pipes are produced with a round cross-section, light pipes are not limited to this geometry. Square and hexagonal cross-sections are used in special applications. Hexagonal pipes tend to produce the most homogenized type of IR Light. The pipes do not need to be straight.  Bends in the pipe have little effect on efficiency.

===Light tube with reflective material===

[[File:Berlin light tube.jpg|thumb|right|upright|… and below ground.]]

Also known as a "tubular skylight" or "tubular daylighting device", this is the oldest and most widespread type of light tube used for [[daylighting]]. The concept was originally developed by the [[ancient Egyptians]]. The first commercial reflector systems were [[patent]]ed and [[Marketing|market]]ed in the 1850s by [[Paul Emile Chappuis]] in London, utilising various forms of angled [[mirror]] designs. Chappuis Ltd's reflectors were in continuous production until the factory was destroyed in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scienceandsociety.co.uk/results.asp?image=10422108 Science &amp; Society Picture Library] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606063140/http://www.scienceandsociety.co.uk/results.asp?image=10422108 |date=2011-06-06 }} Advertisement for Chappuis’ patent reflectors, c 1851–1870.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept was rediscovered and patented in 1986 by [[Solatube]] International of Australia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.solatube.com.au/corporate/about_history.php Solatube International, history] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090929135829/http://www.solatube.com.au/corporate/about_history.php |date=2009-09-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This system has been marketed for widespread residential and commercial use. Other daylighting products are on the market under various generic names, such as "SunScope", "solar pipe", "light pipe", "light tube" and "tubular skylight".

A tube lined with highly [[reflectivity|reflective material]] leads the light rays through a building, starting from an entrance-point located on its roof or one of its outer walls. A light tube is not intended for imaging (in contrast to a [[periscope]], for example), thus image distortions pose no problem and are in many ways encouraged due to the reduction of "directional" light.

The entrance point usually comprises a [[dome]] ([[cupola]]), which has the function of collecting and reflecting as much sunlight as possible into the tube. Many units also have directional "collectors", "reflectors" or even [[Fresnel lens]] devices that assist in collecting additional directional light down the tube.

A set-up in which a [[Laser cutting|laser cut]] [[Acrylic glass|acrylic panel]] is arranged to redirect sunlight into a horizontally or vertically orientated mirrored pipe, combined with a light spreading system with a triangular arrangement of laser cut panels that spread the light into the room, was developed at the [[Queensland University of Technology]] in Brisbane.&lt;ref&gt;Ken Yeang:[http://www.trhamzahyeang.com/features/img/Light%20pipe%20paper.pdf Light Pipes: An Innovative Design Device for Bringing Natural Daylight and Illumination into Buildings with Deep Floor Plan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305001322/http://www.trhamzahyeang.com/features/img/Light%20pipe%20paper.pdf |date=2009-03-05 }}, Nomination for the Far East Economic Review Asian Innovation Awards 2003&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, Veronica Garcia Hansen, [[Ken Yeang]], and Ian Edmonds were awarded the [[Far Eastern Economic Review#Awards presented by FEER|Far East Economic Review Innovation Award]] in bronze for this development.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scienceinpublic.com/freshinnovators/2005/Veronica/veronicagarciahansen.htm Lighting up your workplace — Queensland student pipes light to your office cubicle] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090105210012/http://www.scienceinpublic.com/freshinnovators/2005/Veronica/veronicagarciahansen.htm |date=2009-01-05 }}, May 9, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcities.com.sg/speaker3.htm#kenneth01 Kenneth Yeang] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080925033953/http://www.worldcities.com.sg/speaker3.htm |date=2008-09-25 }}, World Cities Summit 2008, June 23—25, 2008, Singapore&lt;/ref&gt;

Light transmission efficiency is greatest if the tube is short and straight. In longer, angled, or flexible tubes, part of the light intensity is lost. To minimize losses, a high reflectivity of the tube lining is crucial; manufacturers claim reflectivities of their materials, in the visible range, of up to almost 99.5 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alanod.de/opencms/sites/alanod.de/de/miro/MIRO_Produkte/MIRO_LIGHTPIPE/index.html |title=MIRO LIGHTPIPE |accessdate=2006-08-01 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061114231516/http://www.alanod.de/opencms/sites/alanod.de/de/miro/MIRO_Produkte/MIRO_LIGHTPIPE/index.html |archivedate=November 14, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://www.acoram.biz/frtubelumiere.htm Tube de Lumière] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070225034937/http://www.acoram.biz/frtubelumiere.htm |date=2007-02-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end point (the point of use), a diffuser spreads the light into the room.

To further optimize the use of solar light, a [[heliostat]] can be installed which tracks the movement of the sun, thereby directing sunlight into the light tube at all times of the day as far as the surroundings´ limitations allow, possibly with additional mirrors or other reflective elements that influence the light path. The heliostat can be set to capture [[moonlight]] at night.

=== Optical fiber ===
[[File:Fiber_optic_light_tube_for_architecture.jpg|thumb|right|Corning Fibrance Light-Diffusing Fiber]]
Corning Inc. makes Fibrance Light-Diffusing Fiber. Fibrance works by shining a laser through a light diffusing fiber optic cable. The cable gives off a lighted glow.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.corning.com/worldwide/en/products/advanced-optics/product-materials/specialty-fiber/light-diffusing-fiber2.html Corning Fibrance official website]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Optical fiber]]s are used in [[fiberscope]]s for imaging applications.

Optical fibers can also be used for daylighting. A solar lighting system based on plastic optical fibers was in development at Oak Ridge National Laboratory in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ornl.gov/sci/solar/pdfs/Let%20the%20Sun%20Shine%20In.pdf Article on Hybrid Solar Lighting "Let the Sun Shine in", Discover Magazine, Vol. 25, No. 07, July 2004] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060809224307/http://www.ornl.gov/sci/solar/pdfs/Let%20the%20Sun%20Shine%20In.pdf |date=2006-08-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ornl.gov/sci/solar/ ORNL - Solar Technologies Program] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130701184144/http://www.ornl.gov/sci/solar/ |date=2013-07-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The system was installed at the American Museum of Science and Energy, Tennessee, USA, in 2005,&lt;ref&gt;HSL Featured in [http://www.popsci.com/popsci/whatsnew/7b1f0e0796b84010vgnvcm1000004eecbccdrcrd.html  Popular Science's What's New Section] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051217024120/http://www.popsci.com/popsci/whatsnew/7b1f0e0796b84010vgnvcm1000004eecbccdrcrd.html |date=2005-12-17 }} June 2005, Page 28&lt;/ref&gt; and brought to market the same year by the company Sunlight Direct.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ornl.gov/info/press_releases/get_press_release.cfm?ReleaseNumber=mr20050830-00 Oak Ridge National Laboratory - New Oak Ridge company putting hybrid solar lighting on map&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060928232712/http://www.ornl.gov/info/press_releases/get_press_release.cfm?ReleaseNumber=mr20050830-00 |date=2006-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sunlight-direct.com/overview.html Sunlight Direct- Architectural Design Information&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060819054131/http://www.sunlight-direct.com/overview.html |date=2006-08-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this system was taken off the market in 2009.

Optical fibers are also used in the Bjork system sold by Parans Solar Lighting AB.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buildinggreen.com/live/index.cfm/2010/3/3/Alexs-Cool-Product-of-the-Week-FiberOptic-Daylighting-from-Parans Parans Bjork] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708104119/http://www.buildinggreen.com/live/index.cfm/2010/3/3/Alexs-Cool-Product-of-the-Week-FiberOptic-Daylighting-from-Parans |date=2011-07-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://inhabitat.com/sunlight-transport-system/ Parans Bjork system review by Inhabitat] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101126144823/http://inhabitat.com/sunlight-transport-system/ |date=2010-11-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The optic fibers in this system are made of PMMA ([[Poly(methyl methacrylate)|PolyMethylMethAcrylate]]) and sheathed with Megolon, a halogen-free thermoplastic resin. A system such as this, however, is quite expensive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buildinggreen.com/live/index.cfm/2010/3/3/Alexs-Cool-Product-of-the-Week-FiberOptic-Daylighting-from-Parans Typical system starting at $10,000] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708104119/http://www.buildinggreen.com/live/index.cfm/2010/3/3/Alexs-Cool-Product-of-the-Week-FiberOptic-Daylighting-from-Parans |date=2011-07-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar system, but using optical fibers of glass, had earlier been under study in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7287168/page/2/ Hybrid Solar Lighting: Bringing a little sunshine into our lives] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060423222228/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/7287168/page/2/ |date=2006-04-23 }}, MSNBC, March 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

In view of the usually small diameter of the fibers, an efficient daylighting set-up requires a [[parabolic reflector|parabolic collector]] to track the sun and concentrate its light.

In contrast to an optical fiber which has a solid core, a prism light guide leads the light through air and is therefore referred to as hollow light guide.

=== Fluorescence based system ===
In a system developed by Fluorosolar and the [[University of Technology, Sydney]], two [[fluorescence|fluorescent]] polymer layers in a flat panel capture short wave sunlight, particularly [[ultraviolet light]], generating red and green light, respectively, which is guided into the interior of a building. There, the red and green light is mixed with artificial blue light to yield white light, without infrared or ultraviolet. This system, which collects light without requiring mobile parts such as a heliostat or a parabolic collector, is intended to transfer light to any place within a building.&amp;nbsp;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fluorosolar.com Fluorosolar]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070112181728/http://www.fluorosolar.com/ |date=January 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treehugger.com/files/2006/05/fluorosolar_bri.php FluoroSolar - Bringing the Sunshine Inside] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070506233137/http://www.treehugger.com/files/2006/05/fluorosolar_bri.php |date=2007-05-06 }}, Treehugger, February 5, 2006 (retrieved on January 13, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/catalyst/stories/s1610451.htm Video] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070202092336/http://www.abc.net.au/catalyst/stories/s1610451.htm |date=2007-02-02 }} on fluorescence based system&lt;/ref&gt; By capturing ultraviolet the system can be especially effective on bright but overcast days; this since ultraviolet is diminished less by cloud cover than are the visible components of sunlight.

== Properties and applications ==

=== Solar and hybrid lighting systems ===
[[File:Solatube 160 DS rafter cutaway.jpg|thumb|A simple light tube, showing collection, transmission, and distribution]]
Solar light pipes, compared to conventional skylights and other windows, offer better heat insulation properties and more flexibility for use in inner rooms, but less visual contact with the external environment.

In the context of [[seasonal affective disorder]], it may be worth consideration that an additional installation of light tubes increases the amount of natural daily light exposure. It could thus possibly contribute to residents´ or employees´ well-being while avoiding [[over-illumination]] effects.

Compared to [[Lamp (electrical component)|artificial lights]], light tubes have the advantage of providing natural light and of saving energy. The transmitted light varies over the day; should this not be desired, light tubes can be combined with artificial light in a [[Daylighting#Hybrid solar lighting|hybrid]] set-up.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sunpipe.com/NightLite.htm Night Lite&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060805125652/http://www.sunpipe.com/NightLite.htm |date=2006-08-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.natural-light-skylights.com/pages/light_kit.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060818184743/http://www.natural-light-skylights.com/pages/light_kit.html |date=August 18, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sunlight-direct.com/lighting.html Sunlight Direct- Lighting Design Information&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060721144112/http://www.sunlight-direct.com/lighting.html |date=2006-07-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some artificial light sources are marketed which have a spectrum similar to that of sunlight, at least in the [[Visible spectrum|human visible spectrum]] range,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xternet.de/bioelektrik/en/true-lite.htm True-Lite&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20020108115037/http://www.xternet.de/bioelektrik/en/true-lite.htm |date=2002-01-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.solux.net/ |title=What is SoLux? |publisher=Solux.net |date= |accessdate=2010-09-29 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080706120915/http://solux.net/ |archivedate=2008-07-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{de icon}} {{cite web |url=http://www.e-wenzl.at/lichtliteratur/vollspektrum_001.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-08-02 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110531205333/http://www.e-wenzl.at/lichtliteratur/vollspektrum_001.html |archivedate=2011-05-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as low flicker.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; Their spectrum can be made to vary dynamically such as to mimick the changes of natural light over the day. Manufacturers and vendors of such light sources claim that their products can provide the same or similar health effects as natural light.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} {{cite web|url=http://www.j-lorber.de/shm/licht/vollspektrum-bedeutg.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-08-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060625161813/http://j-lorber.de/shm/licht/vollspektrum-bedeutg.htm |archivedate=2006-06-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} {{cite web |url=http://www.villiton.ch/vollspektrumlicht.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-08-02 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060615171028/http://www.villiton.ch/vollspektrumlicht.php |archivedate=2006-06-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; When considered as alternatives to solar light pipes, such products may have lower installation costs but do consume energy during use; therefore they may well be more wasteful in terms of overall energy resources and costs.

On a more practical note, light tubes do not require electric installations or insulation, and are thus especially useful for indoor wet areas such as bathrooms and pools. From a more artistic point of view, recent developments, especially those pertaining to transparent light tubes, open new and interesting possibilities for architectural design.

=== Security applications ===
Due to the relatively small size and high light output of sun pipes, they have an ideal application to security oriented situations, such as [[prisons]], [[police]] cells and other locations where restricted access is required. Being of a narrow diameter, and not largely affected by internal security grilles, this provides daylight to areas without providing electrical connections or escape access, and without allowing objects to be passed into a secure area.

==In electronic devices==
Molded plastic light tubes are commonly used in the electronics industry to direct illumination from LEDs on a circuit board to indicator symbols or buttons. These light tubes typically take on a highly complex shape that uses either gentle curving bends as in an optic fiber or have sharp prismatic folds which reflect off the angled corners. Multiple light tubes are often molded from a single piece of plastic, permitting easy device assembly since the long thin light tubes are all part of a single rigid component that snaps into place.

Light tube indicators make electronics cheaper to manufacture since the old way would be to mount a tiny lamp into a small socket directly behind the spot to be illuminated. This often requires extensive hand-labor for installation and wiring. Light tubes permit all lights to be mounted on a single flat circuit board, but the illumination can be directed up and away from the board by several inches, wherever it is required.

'''Multi-Channel DRAM''' or '''MCDRAM''' (pronounced ''em cee dee ram''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | url = https://software.intel.com/en-us/blogs/2016/01/20/an-intro-to-mcdram-high-bandwidth-memory-on-knights-landing
 | title = An Intro to MCDRAM (High Bandwidth Memory) on Knights Landing
 | date = January 20, 2016 
 | accessdate = April 18, 2016
 | author = Mike P. (sic)
 | publisher = software.intel.com
}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[Three-dimensional integrated circuit|3D-stacked]] [[Dynamic random-access memory|DRAM]] that is used in the [[Intel]] [[Xeon Phi]] processor codenamed [[Xeon_Phi#Knights_Landing|Knights Landing]].  It is a version of [[Hybrid Memory Cube]] developed in partnership with Micron, and a competitor to [[High Bandwidth Memory]].  

The many cores in the Xeon Phi processors, along with their associated vector processing units, enable them to consume many more gigabytes per second than traditional DRAM DIMMs can supply.  The "Multi-channel" part of the MCDRAM full name reflects the cores having many more channels available to access the MCDRAM than processors have to access their attached DIMMs.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | url = http://www.anandtech.com/show/9794/a-few-notes-on-intels-knights-landing-and-mcdram-modes-from-sc15
 | title = A few notes on Intel's Knights Landing and MDRAM modes from SC15

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This high channel count leads to MCDRAM's high bandwidth, up to 400+ GB/s, although the latencies are similar to a DIMM access.

Its physical placement on the processor imposes some limits on capacity - up to 16&amp;nbsp;GB at launch, although speculated to go higher in the future.

==Programming==
The memory can be partitioned at boot time, with some used as cache for more distant DDR, and the remainder mapped into the physical address space.

The application can request pages of [[virtual memory]] to be assigned to either the distant DDR directly, to the portion of DDR that is cached by the MCDRAM, or to the portion of the MCDRAM that is not being used as cache.  One way to do this is via the&lt;code&gt;memkind&lt;/code&gt; API.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | url = https://memkind.github.io/memkind/memkind_arch_20150318.pdf

 | accessdate = April 18, 2016
 | author = Christopher Cantalupo
 | publisher = memkind.github.io
|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When used as cache, the latency of a miss accessing both the MCDRAM and DDR is slightly higher than going directly to DDR, and so applications may need to be tuned 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
to avoid excessive cache misses.

'''Martifer''' is a family group based in [[Oliveira de Frades]], [[Portugal]], with over 3,000 employees, focusing its activity on the [[metalworking|metal construction]] and [[renewable energy]] areas.

The company launched its first operations in 1990 in the metal structure industry. In 2004, it entered the renewables business, leveraging know-how from the metal construction operation to develop the energy equipment division.

Martifer is market leader in [[Iberia]] for metal construction, and aims to become the top player in other specific markets, namely [[Europe]] and [[Angola]].

In renewable energies, Martifer would like to become established as an integrated producer of turn-key solutions for the wind and solar segments. Furthermore, within renewable energies, Martifer operates as a promoter of electricity generation projects, with a portfolio of holdings in projects at different phases of development.

Martifer SGPS, SA is the Group’s holding company and has been listed on the Euronext Lisbon since June 2007. In 2008, its core activity operating revenues reached EUR 650 million. The main shareholder structure is made up of the founding partners, through I’M SGPS, S.A., and the [[Mota Engil|Mota-Engil Group]], both control approximately 80% of the company.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.martifer.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2009, Martifer and [[Hirschfeld Wind Energy Solutions]], a part of [[Hirschfeld Industries]] in [[Texas]], United States, announced a [[Joint venture]] for the manufacture of [[wind towers]] and related components in the United States. The project cost was estimated to cost $40 million US dollars to build a new facility in San Angelo, Texas. Production was originally expected to reach a capacity of 400 towers a year by 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hirschfeld.com/news_item.asp?ID=18 Hirschfeld Industries press release] June 19, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; However, the operation was unable to compete effectively in the very difficult pricing environment for wind towers in the 2009-2011 time frame and the investment failed to reach its objectives. In July 18, 2012, Hirschfeld announced that it had acquired the remaining 50 percent of the joint venture from Martifer for a small cash payment, and as of 2014, had converted the plant to build steel bridge structures. The last wind tower was produced there in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Waller|first=Matthew|title=Martifer leaves wind tower plant: Hirschfeld buys out stake in company|url=http://www.gosanangelo.com/news/2012/jul/18/martifer-out-of-hirschfeld-partnership/|accessdate=July 19, 2012|newspaper=San Angelo Standard Times|date=July 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Martifer Out of Hirschfeld Joint Venture|url=http://stateofthedivision.blogspot.com/2012/07/martifer-out-of-hirschfeld-joint.html|work=State of the Division Blog|accessdate=July 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Waller|first=M|title=Martifer leaves wind tower plant|url=http://www.power-eng.com/news/2012/07/19/martifer-leaves-wind-tower-plant.html|work=Power Engineering|publisher=PennWell|accessdate=July 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mobile Marketing Research''' describes a method of data collection means by using functions of mobile phones, smart phones and [[Personal digital assistant|PDAs]]. It makes use of strengths from mobile communication and applies these strengths to research purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Maxl, Emanuel: Mobile Market Research: Analysis through the Mobile Phone, in: Maxl/Döring/Wallisch (Hrsg.): Mobile Market Research (Neue Schriften zur Online-Forschung 7), Herbert von Halem Verlag, Köln, 2009, p.12&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[Image:Pic Survey.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Survey on a mobile phone]]
Due to sociocultural changes towards digitization in everyday life, reachability and lifestyle at the turn of the 21st century, it became more and more difficult for the [[marketing research]] industry to address respondents that are both willing to participate in surveys and reachable via [[traditional media]]. Consumers were no longer clearly classified which made it harder to make obvious assumptions about [[Consumer behaviour|consumer behavior]]. Researchers had to adopt their approaches to keep up with technology as well as coping with these changes in order to find out who customers are and what they want.&lt;ref&gt;Kaufmann, Gwen: Die Marktmacht des Konsumenten, in: Planung &amp; Analyse, 2/2010 (Sonderteil: Jahreskongress für Marktforschung - Zukunft der Märkte - Märkte der Zukunft, April 2010), p.5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition and development==
Mobile phones are practical, versatile and have already become an indispensable device for communication which is carried along almost around the clock. [[Smartphones]] in particular offer many different kinds of applications and fulfill further technical requirements. There are several [http://hubs.ly/H01FmTy0 mobile applications] that provide mobile market research through smartphones. This is the basis to allow conducting [[empirical research]] studies.&lt;ref&gt;Maxl, Emanuel / Döring, Nicola / Wallisch, Astrid: Introduction, in: Maxl/Döring/Wallisch (Hrsg.): Mobile Market Research (Neue Schriften zur Online-Forschung 7), Herbert von Halem Verlag, Köln, 2009, p.7&lt;/ref&gt; Besides, the number of mobile phones, smart phones and PDAs is still growing: already in 2006, the number of worldwide mobile phone user exceeded the number of land line users. According to a study of PEW ''(Internet &amp; American Life Projects)'', which examined more than 1000 internet leader, -analysts and -executives, mobile devices will become the most often used instrument to connect to internet by the year 2020.
According to Pew Research’s Internet &amp; American Life study in January 2014, 58% of adults in the US had a smartphone,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewinternet.org/2014/02/27/the-web-at-25-in-the-u-s/|title=The Web at 25 in the U.S.|author1=Susannah Fox|author2=Lee Rainie|date=February 27, 2014|website=Pew Research Center - Internet &amp; Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt; up from 56% in May 2013. In other parts of the world, like Central and Latin America, many people never had a PC but they now have a smartphone. For instance in Chile, more than 85% of the participants of an online panel had a smartphone in 2014, whereas only around 60% had a desktop.&lt;ref&gt;Revilla, M, Toninelli, D, Ochoa, C and Loewe, G. 2015. Who Has Access to Mobile Devices in an Online Opt-in Panel? An Analysis of Potential Respondents for Mobile Surveys. In: Toninelli, D, Pinter, R &amp; de Pedraza, P (eds.) Mobile Research Methods: Opportunities and Challenges of Mobile Research Methodologies, Pp. 119–139. London: Ubiquity Press. DOI: https://dx.doi.org/10.5334/bar.h. License: CC-BY 4.0.&lt;/ref&gt; For many people the mobile phone is already a kind of "life-support tool”. Therefore, conducting [[Statistical survey|survey]]s via mobile phones could possibly help to counteract against the generally declining motivation of respondents, as many potential participants enjoy using this technical device. Particularly the very technology-savvy young target is difficult to reach by traditional media as compared to more modern media such as cell phones. Therefore, this medium is very appropriate to address this target group.&lt;ref&gt;Tarkus, Astrid: Usability of Mobile surveys, in: Maxl/Döring/Wallisch (Hrsg.): Mobile Market Research (Neue Schriften zur Online-Forschung 7), Herbert von Halem Verlag, Köln, 2009, p.154&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="reaching-the-mobile-respondent"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://homepage.univie.ac.at/andreas.hergovich/php/reaching_the_mobile_respondent_soc.sci.comp.rev.pdf |title = Reaching the Mobile Respondent: Determinants of High-Level Mobile Phone Use Among a High-Coverage Group |publisher = Social Science Computer Review |doi = 10.1177/0894439309353099}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even if some respondents declare that they still prefer to answer web surveys through PCs, the proportions of panelists declaring that they prefer to answer through smartphones are clearly non-negligeable anymore across many different countries &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Revilla|first1=M.|last2=Toninelli|first2=D.|last3=Ochoa|first3=C.|last4=Loewe|first4=G.|year=2016|title=Do online access panels really need to allow and adapt surveys to mobile devices?|journal=Internet Research|volume=26|issue=5|pages=1209–1227|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/IntR-02-2015-0032}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mobile survey methods==
===Methodology of data collection===
According to Maxl, four different kinds of methods are distinguished which can be used as required. These are listed in the following figure.
[[File:Figure MMR Methods.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Introduction: Mobile market research methods&lt;ref&gt;Figure according to Maxl (2009), p.18&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Push studies without contexts (A) are conducted independently from time and location. This can be [[CATI]]- or CACI-studies as well as surveys by [[SMS]] or MMS. In cases of these research methods, the feedback impulse actively comes from the researcher.
With contextual push studies (B) the researcher prompts the respondent to give appropriate feedback once it is recognized that he/she is located in a particular environment or is in a certain situation.&lt;ref&gt;Maxl (2009), pp.18-20&lt;/ref&gt;
Pull studies are characterized that participants call in the questionnaire themselves. In many cases short notes draw attention to a survey or an evaluation. Such communications may be placed in certain contexts (C) (e.g. on receipts, advertisements or product packaging) in order to encourage participation. Non-context-sensitive pull studies (D) are not relevant for marketing research since they provide only general feedback, which has no relation to a fixed object of research. Therefore, they are hardly controlled and evaluated.&lt;ref&gt;Döring, Nicola: Psychological Aspects of Interviewing by Cellular Telephone, Presentation / MRC 2010, London, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Data collection on a technical view===
On the technical level, three different possibilities of data collection are distinguished according to Pferdekämper/Batinic. The [[SMS|Short Message Service (SMS)]] outlines one possibility, which can be used as a basis to conduct interviews. This is very suitable for ad hoc surveys, if particular key questions have to be answered.
For [[Java application|Java]] applications, the participants receive a link to a [[Wireless Application Protocol|WAP]] page where an application is to be downloaded. The survey software is immediately installed on the mobile phone and the survey can be filled out straight away.
Furthermore, surveys can be accessed via the [[Mobile internet|mobile Internet]]. The webpage is also called in via [[Wap push#WAP Push|WAP push]]. Questionnaires are created and designed in different formats. This allows disrupting to complete the questionnaire in order to further process on a different technical device with internet access.&lt;ref&gt;Pferdekämper, Tanja / Batinic, Bernad: Mobile Surveys from a technical perspective, in: Maxl/Döring/Wallisch (Hrsg.): Mobile Market Research (Neue Schriften zur Online-Forschung 7), Herbert von Halem Verlag, Köln, 2009, pp.122-125&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disadvantages and difficulties of mobile market research==
Probably most important point to be discussed is the representativity of the sampling regarding the quality of data.
Based on the total population, those people who don’t own a mobile phone, cannot become part of the sampling. Mobile phone users have to be able to be reached as well as to be willing to take part in the survey. But it is by far not enough to just look at the users of mobile phones. Equally important is to also know the number of people who use the SMS service and how many of these people own a web-enabled phone. Only if all these aspects are being noticed, a final conclusion regarding the sampling can be drawn.&lt;ref&gt;Busse, Britta / Fuchs, Marek: Relative Coverage Biases for Mobile Phone and Mobile Web Surveys, in: Maxl/Döring/Wallisch (Hrsg.): Mobile Market Research (Neue Schriften zur Online-Forschung 7), Herbert von Halem Verlag, Köln, 2009, p.223-226&lt;/ref&gt; For these reasons a mobile survey does not meet the standards of the statistical representativity.
As mentioned in the beginning, the restricted possibilities to access WAP-Surveys are another problem. The number of those who use the internet via their mobile phone is rather small: According to IFCom only 19% of all mobile phone users do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IFCom Crossmedia 2010 - Wer sind die mobilen Onliner?|date=February 2010|url=http://www.ifcom-research.de/ifcom_crossmedia_2010.pdf|language=de|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100331033919/http://www.ifcom-research.de/ifcom_crossmedia_2010.pdf|archive-date=March 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; But the data acquisition through mobile phones holds more difficulties. On one hand there are high costs for Incentives and an intensive recruitment by the institutes. On the other hand, the participants of the survey have to pay the costs for the internet usage via mobile phone. However, more and more respondents do not pay the internet access based on the time spent on Internet and more and more places proposes free Wi-Fi, making this issue less and less relevant for respondents. Additionally, there are also technical difficulties that may occur. The high number of different and not-compatible software or the low transmission rate of data are just a few to name. In order to improve the respondents' experience in answering the web surveys on mobile devices, optimizing the layout of the survey for smaller screen is crucial: non-optimized layouts lead to lower data quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Revilla|first1=M.|last2=Toninelli|first2=D.|last3=Ochoa|first3=C.|year=2016|title=PCs versus Smartphones in answering web surveys: does the device make a difference?|journal=Survey Practice|volume=9|issue=4|url=http://www.surveypractice.org/index.php/SurveyPractice/article/view/338/pdf_72}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Restrictions concerning the reveal and passing on of mobile phone numbers (because of [[data protection]] and the lack of [[Anonymity]]) are setting limits to the research in this field of study, too.&lt;ref name="Maxl 2009, p.15"&gt;Maxl (2009), p.15&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages and possibilities of mobile market research==
Statistical methods in the mobile market research profit from the fact that they do not depend on place or time.&lt;ref&gt;Maxl (2009), p.16&lt;/ref&gt; This means that surveys via mobile phone can be done anywhere and at any time and are therefore much more advantageous compared to surveys via land line phones. Considering that a high number of participants of the main target groups can not be reached at home at most hours of the day,&lt;ref&gt;Romano (2009), p.251&lt;/ref&gt; the chance to get hold of them by mobile phone is much higher.
Especially with regard to people under the age of 25 as well as business people, who are often on the way and cannot get hold of easily, the chances of the mobile market research are promising. As most people always carry their mobile phone with them, an immediate transmission of personal impressions of current events, is possible at any time.&lt;ref name="Maxl 2009, p.15"/&gt; Thus, the so-called ‘magic moment’ can be captured, which is often very helpful. Surveys concerning product placement and efficiency of sales promotion measures at the [[point of sale]] turned out to be perfectly realizable this way. Looking at the topic “Access possibilities to WAP-Surveys” by mobile phone, as well as at the topic “Getting hold of potential participants”, there are some developments that should be named. The trend towards the increasing distribution of web-enabled mobile phones, and the improved representativity that comes along with it, does still continue: from 2007 to 2008, ''Nielsen Mobile'' noticed an increase of the mobile internet usage.&lt;ref&gt;Busse/Fuchs (2009), p.223&lt;/ref&gt;
With decreasing costs and an improving technology, a further upward tendency can be expected. In addition, the mobile internet usage increases with the rapidly developing distribution of smart phones. According to IM (Mediawork Initiative), already in 2013 more people will log in with their smart phone, than with a PC. Mobile statistics show a high and very fast response rate. As a result of the independency from time and place, answers can be submitted immediately. This also means that results can almost be transmitted in real time. A study from Globalpark shows that approximately 35% of the participants answered a mobile survey within 2 hours.&lt;ref&gt;Kaufmann (2010), p.5&lt;/ref&gt; Through the novelty of the form of survey and its playful design, mobile research has a motivating effect on the participants. This applies especially to young, technologically interested male persons. But also [[iPhone]] users are considered to be very communicative. As the devices are easy to handle, the users are more likely and more motivated to take part in surveys.&lt;ref&gt;Maxl (2009), pp.13-16&lt;/ref&gt; A study examining how to best reach mobile respondents published in the Journal Social Science Computer Review underlines the importance of social factors. Especially their subjective belief of how they are seen by significant others, or their intention of how they would like to be seen by significant others seem to play a major role in their mobile phone behavior.&lt;ref name="reaching-the-mobile-respondent"/&gt;

[[File:Powell UN Iraq presentation, alleged Mobile Production Facilities.jpg|thumb|Purported Iraqi mobile weapons laboratories, actually for production of hydrogen to fill wind-sensing balloons.&lt;ref name="Observer "/&gt;]]

'''Mobile weapons laboratories''' are [[bioreactor]]s and other processing equipment to manufacture and process [[biological weapons]] that can be moved from location to location either by [[train]] or vehicle.

==Iraqi Mobile weapons laboratories==
In the run up to the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|2003 Invasion of Iraq]], the main [[rationale for the Iraq War]] was Hussein's Iraq failure to transparently and verifiably cease Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD - nuclear, biological and chemical weapons) programs, and to destroy all materials relating thereto, as mandated in United Nations Resolution 1441. In February 2003 the then [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Colin Powell]] gave a presentation before the [[United Nations]] showing a computer generated view of what the laboratories looked like. He said Iraq had as many as 18 mobile facilities for making [[anthrax]] and [[botulinum toxin]]. "They can produce enough dry, biological agent in a single month to kill thousands upon thousands of people."  Powell based the assertion on accounts of at least four Iraqi defectors, including a chemical engineer who supervised one of the facilities and been present during production runs of a biological agent.
&lt;ref name="UCLA"&gt;{{cite web |date=April 29, 2003| url = http://www.ph.ucla.edu/epi/bioter/trucktested.html| title = Truck Is Tested for Biological Agents| publisher = [[Los Angeles Times]] | accessdate = 2007-07-24 | last=By Greg Miller and Bob Drogin }}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the invasion of Iraq two trailers were found and initially described as the alleged mobile labs.

===Intelligence Sources===

In the CIA briefing days before the 2003 [[United Nations]] security council presentation Colin Powell knew that all information included in the report had to be solid.  "Powell and I were both suspicious because there were no pictures of the mobile labs," Wilkerson, Powell's chief of staff said.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost"&gt;{{cite news |date= June 25, 2006| url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/24/AR2006062401081_pf.html| title = Warnings on WMD 'Fabricator' Were Ignored, Ex-CIA Aide Says| publisher = Washington Post| accessdate = 2007-07-23 | author=Joby Warrick }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Powell demanded multiple sources and the two CIA men present [[George Tenet]], then the CIA director and [[John E. McLaughlin]], then the CIA deputy director claimed to have multiple eye witness accounts and supporting evidence.  Wilkerson claims that the two said, "This is it, Mr. Secretary. You can't doubt this one"&lt;ref name="washingtonpost"/&gt;

The information behind the mobile vehicles had come from the multiple informants but the main and most important one was known as [[Curveball (informant)|Curveball]]. Curveball was an Iraqi refugee in [[Germany]].&lt;ref name="cooperativeresearch"&gt;{{cite web| date = November 20, 2005| url = http://www.cooperativeresearch.org/context.jsp?item=complete_timeline_of_the_2003_invasion_of_iraq_3280| title = Complete timeline of the 2003 invasion of Iraq| publisher = cooperativeresearch.org| accessdate = 2007-07-23| last = cooperative research| quote = He speaks to his BND debriefers in Arabic through a translator, and also in broken English and German. Curveball says that he worked for Iraq's Military Industrial Commission after graduating first in his class from engineering school at Baghdad University in 1994 (He actually graduated last (see 1994)). A year later, he says, he was assigned to work for "Dr. Germ," British-trained microbiologist [[Rihab Taha|Rihab Rashid Taha]], to construct mobile biological weapons labs. But Curveball never says that he actually produced biological weapons or witnessed anyone else doing so and the BND is unable to verify his claims. Curveball's statements are recorded in German, shared with a local Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) team, and sent to the US, where they are translated into English for analysis at the DIA's directorate for human intelligence in Clarendon, Va. "This was not substantial evidence," one senior German intelligence official later recalls in an interview with the Los Angeles Times. "We made clear we could not verify the things he said." The reports are then sent to the CIA's Weapons Intelligence, Non-Proliferation and Arms Control Center (WINPAC), whose experts analyze the data and share it with artists who use Curveball's accounts to render sketches.| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070930033512/http://www.cooperativeresearch.org/context.jsp?item=complete_timeline_of_the_2003_invasion_of_iraq_3280| archivedate = September 30, 2007| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
He claimed that after he had graduated at the top of his [[chemical engineer]]ing class at [[Baghdad University]] in 1994, he worked  for "Dr. Germ,"  the pseudonym of British-trained [[microbiologist]] [[Rihab Taha|Rihab Rashid Taha]].&lt;ref name="cooperativeresearch"/&gt; He led a team that built mobile labs to create biological WMD&lt;ref name="cooperativeresearch"/&gt; Curveball was never actually interviewed by  American intelligence and in May 2004, over a year after the invasion of Iraq, the CIA concluded formally that Curveball's information was fabricated. Furthermore, on June 26, 2006, the Washington Post reported that "the CIA acknowledged that Curveball was a [[con artist]] who drove a [[Taxicab|taxi]] in Iraq and spun his engineering knowledge into a fantastic but plausible tale about secret bioweapons factories on wheels."&lt;ref name="washingtonpost"/&gt;

With information about the mobile labs the Bush administration then went and asked [[Ahmed Chalabi]]'s [[Iraqi National Congress|Iraqi National Congress (INC)]] if they knew anything about this "threat".  The INC provided an Iraqi defector, Mohammad Harith, who claimed that while working for the Iraqi government he had purchased seven Renault refrigerated trucks to be converted into mobile biological weapons laboratories.&lt;ref name="FamousPictures"&gt;{{cite web |year=2007 | url = http://www.famouspictures.org/iraqi-mobile-production-facilities/| title = Famous Pictures Magazine - Iraqi Mobile Production Facilities| publisher = Famous Pictures Magazine| accessdate = 2007-07-24 | last= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The INC used [[James Woolsey]], former director of the CIA, to directly contact Deputy Assistant Defense Secretary Linton Wells, of the [[Defense Intelligence Agency|Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA)]], with info about Mohammad Harith's account to avoid any scrutiny by the CIA.&lt;ref name="Knight"&gt;{{cite web |date=May 31, 2007&lt;!-- 07:35:07 PM --&gt;| url = http://www.mcclatchydc.com/staff/jonathan_landay/v-print/story/10507.html| title = Former CIA director used Pentagon ties to introduce Iraqi defector| publisher = [[Knight Ridder Newspapers]]| accessdate = 2007-07-24 | last=Jonathan S. Landay and Warren P. Strobel }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Harith's was met by a [[Defense Intelligence Agency|DIA]] debriefer who concluded that it "seemed accurate, but much of it appeared embellished" and he apparently "had been coached on what information to provide."  However, the line about Harith being coached was removed and one that he passed a lie detector added and as such became  official evidence of mobile bio-labs even being used by Bush in his January 2003 State of the Union message.&lt;ref name="Knight"/&gt;  Later Mohammad Harith like curveball evidence was labeled with a fabricator notice.

A third source, reporting through Defense [[HUMINT]] channels and another asylum seeker, claimed that in June 2001 that Iraq had mobile biological weapons laboratories however after the war in Oct 2003 the source recanted his testimony.&lt;ref name="globalsecurity"&gt;{{cite web |date=Page last modified: 12-04-2006 18:25:51| url = http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/world/iraq/bw-mobile.htm| title = Mobile Biological Weapons Facilities - Winnebagos of Death| publisher = [[Sunday Telegraph]] | accessdate = 2007-07-24 | last=John Pike |quote=From January 2000 to September 2001, the Defense Intelligence Agency's (DIA) Human Intelligence disseminated almost 112 reports from Curveball regarding mobile BW facilities in Iraq. These reports did not come directly from Curveball, however, but were transferred through a "foreign liaison."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A fourth source existed but all information and details regarding the report are still classified.&lt;ref name="globalsecurity"/&gt;

All the sources depended on the [[Curveball (informant)|Curveball]]'s account and were seen as supportive to it.  When Tenet called Powell in late summer 2003, seven months after the U.N. speech, he admitted that all of the CIA's claims Powell used in his speech about Iraqi weapons were wrong.  "They had hung on for a long time, but finally Tenet called Powell to say, 'We don't have that one, either,' " Wilkerson recalled. "The mobile labs were the last thing to go."&lt;ref name="washingtonpost"/&gt;

===Discovery of Iraqi mobile labs? ===

May 13, 2003 it was reported that a second suspected mobile weapons lab had been found in Iraq on April 19, 2003.&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;{{cite news |date=May 13, 2003| url = http://edition.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/meast/05/13/sprj.irq.mobile.lab/index.html | title = Second suspected mobile weapons lab found in Iraq | publisher = CNN| accessdate = 2008-01-16 | last= CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

May 27, 2003 a fact finding mission to Iraq sent its report to Washington unanimously declaring that the trailers had nothing to do with biological weapons. The report was 'shelved'.&lt;ref name="washpost"&gt;{{cite news |date=April 12, 2006| url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/04/11/AR2006041101888_pf.html | title = Lacking Biolabs, Trailers Carried Case for War | publisher = Washington Post | accessdate = 2008-01-16 | author=Joby Warrick }}&lt;/ref&gt;

May 28, 2003 the Central Intelligence Agency released a report on the supposed mobile weapons labs, stating:-

&lt;blockquote&gt;Despite the lack of confirmatory samples, we nevertheless are confident that this trailer is a mobile BW production plant.&lt;ref name="cia2"&gt;{{cite web |date=May 28, 2003| url = https://www.cia.gov/library/reports/general-reports-1/iraqi_mobile_plants/index.html| title = Iraqi Mobile Biological Warfare Agent Production Plants | publisher = Central Intelligence Agency | accessdate = 2008-01-16 | last= CIA}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

May 29, 2003 President George W Bush declared that they had found the weapons of mass destruction that had been claimed were in Iraq, these were in the form of mobile labs for manufacturing biological weapons.

&lt;blockquote&gt;We found the weapons of mass destruction. We found biological laboratories. You remember when Colin Powell stood up in front of the world, and he said, Iraq has got laboratories, mobile labs to build biological weapons. They're illegal. They're against the United Nations resolutions, and we've so far discovered two. And we'll find more weapons as time goes on. But for those who say we haven't found the banned manufacturing devices or banned weapons, they're wrong, we found them.&lt;ref name="BushPoland"&gt;{{cite web |date=May 29, 2003| url = https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/g8/interview5.html| title = Interview of the President by TVP, Poland | publisher = White House| accessdate = 2008-01-16 | last= George W Bush}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

May 29, 2003 "We have already found two trailers that both our and the American security services believe were used for the manufacture of chemical and biological weapons." Tony Blair, Flying into Kuwait for morale boosting trip.

May 29, 2003 "My personal view is we're going to find them, just as we found these two mobile laboratories" Town Hall Meeting with Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld, Infinity-CBS Radio.

June 2, 2003 In the UK, [[Susan Watts]] broadcasts on the influential BBC2 Newsnight report which includes an anonymous experts (Dr David Kelly&lt;ref name="hutton"&gt;{{cite web |date=August 13, 2003| url = http://www.the-hutton-inquiry.org.uk/content/transcripts/hearing-trans06.htm | title = Hutton Inquiry Hearing Transcripts - Susan Watts| publisher = The Hutton Inquiry| accessdate = 2008-01-16 | last= Hutton}}&lt;/ref&gt; ) opinion on the Mobile Weapons labs being for biological weapons. Dr Kelly is now only 40% certain the trailers are labs.

June 3, 2003 "We know that these trailers look exactly like what was described to us by multiple sources as the capabilities for building or for making biological agents. We know that we have from multiple sources who told us that then and sources who have confirmed it now. Now the Iraqis were not stupid about this. They were able to conceal a lot. They've been able to scrub things down. But I think when the whole picture comes out, we will see that this was an active program." [[Condoleezza Rice]], Capital Report, CNBC.

'''Pipeline pre-commissioning''' is the process of proving the ability of a [[pipeline transport|pipeline]] and [[piping]] systems to contain product without leaking. This product may be liquid, gaseous or multiphase [[hydrocarbons]], [[water]], [[steam]], CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, [[petrol]], [[aviation fuel]] etc.

Pre-commissioning is the series of processes carried out on the pipeline '''before''' the final product is introduced. The process during which the pipeline is made "live" i.e. the product is put in the pipeline, is called pipeline commissioning or start-up.

Despite being seen as an offshoot, or minor part of the business for the larger oil service companies, the pipeline pre-commissioning industry possesses quite a large portfolio of services including, but not limited to the following services:

Pipeline Cleaning – this is carried out by pushing [[Pigging|pigs]] or [[gel pigs]] through the pipeline to remove any debris buildup or corrosion.

Pipeline Gauging – this is carried out to prove the dimensional quality of the internal diameter of the pipeline.

Pipeline Filling (Flooding) – which can be carried out by propelling pigs through the pipeline with water or free flooding with water (normally for smaller or unpiggable pipelines).

[[Hydrotesting]] – this is a process by which the pipeline in question is pressure tested to a predefined pressure above the operating design pressure of the pipeline.

Dewatering – this involves pushing pigs through the pipeline propelled by a gas to remove the water prior to start-up.

Other services include vacuum drying, degassing, pneumatic testing, barrier testing, leak testing, decommissioning to mention but a few.

On the pipeline process pre-commissioning side, there are various services such as chemical cleaning, helium leak detection, bolting, hot oil flushing, pipe freezing, foam inerting etc...

Other services include valve testing, umbilical testing, hot tapping, leak metering, riser annulus testing.

Some of the main service companies in the business are given below.

A '''plumber''' is a [[tradesperson]] who specializes in installing and maintaining systems used for potable (drinking) [[water]], [[sewage]] and [[drainage]] in [[plumbing]] systems. The term dates from ancient times and is related to the Latin word for lead, "[[plumbum]]".&lt;ref&gt;Whitney, William D., ed.. "Trade." Def, 7. ''The Century Dictionary: An Encyclopedic Lexicon of the English Language'' vol. 8. New York. The Century Co. 1895. 6,415. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MichReport"&gt;[http://milmi.org/Portals/137/publications/Employment_Occupations_Skilled_Trades_Michigan.pdf Employment and Occupations in the Skilled Trades in Michigan], Michigan Department of Technology, Management, and Budget, Bureau of Labor Market Information and Strategic Initiatives (June 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The word  "plumber" dates from the [[Roman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Pulsifer, William H. [https://archive.org/details/notesforhistoryo00pulsrich Notes For a History of Lead], New York University Press, 1888 pp. 132, 158&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Latin]]  for [[lead]] is ''{{lang|la|plumbum}}''.  Roman roofs used lead in conduits and drain pipes&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Px4XAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA821 Middleton, The Remains of Ancient Rome, Vol. 2, A &amp; C Black, 1892]&lt;/ref&gt; and some were also covered with lead, lead was also used for [[piping]] and for making baths.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20081121025509/http://www.ila-lead.org/factbook/annex.pdf Historical production and uses of lead]. ila-lead.org&lt;/ref&gt; In medieval times anyone who worked with lead was referred to as a plumber as can be seen from an extract of workmen fixing a roof in Westminster Palace and were referred to as plumbers "To Gilbert de Westminster, plumber, working about the roof of the pantry of the little hall, covering it with lead, and about various defects in the roof of the little hall".&lt;ref name="plum1"&gt;{{cite book|title=The history of the ancient palace and late Houses of Parliament at Westminster|year=1836|publisher=J B Nichols and son|page=122|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DQc3AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA122|author=EW Wedlake|author2=J Britton |accessdate=28 June 2010|chapter=Westminster Palace}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus a person with expertise in working with lead was first known as a ''Plumbarius'' which was later shortened to plumber.

===United States===

Each state and locality may have its own licensing and taxing schemes for plumbers.  There is no federal law establishing licenses for plumbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bls.gov/ooh/construction-and-extraction/plumbers-pipefitters-and-steamfitters.htm#tab-4|title=How to Become a Plumber in the USA|last=|first=|date=1 November 2016|work=|publisher=U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics|newspaper=|location=|pages=|language=|via=|accessdate=1 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
In Canada, licensing requirements differ by province, however the provinces have pooled resources to develop an Interprovincial Program Guide that developed and maintains apprenticeship training standards across all provinces. The result is what is known as the Interprovincial Standards Red Seal Program.

===United Kingdom===

National Vocational Qualifications ([[NVQ]]) remained the main form of plumbing qualification until they were superseded in 2008 by the Qualification and Credit Framework (QCF)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | title =Plumbing Qualifications in the UK | newspaper = | location = | pages = | language = | publisher = Local Heroes | url =https://www.localheroes.com/advice/how-to-become-a-plumber| accessdate =27 February 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and then again into the [[National qualifications frameworks in the United Kingdom]] in 2015. The terms NVQ and SVQ ([[Scottish Vocational Qualification]]) are still widely used&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | title =Plumbing Qualifications in the UK | newspaper = | location = | pages = | language = | publisher = Local Heroes | url =https://www.localheroes.com/advice/how-to-become-a-plumber| accessdate =27 February 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Plumbers in the United Kingdom are required to pass Level 2 and Level 3 vocational requirements of the [[City and Guilds of London Institute]]. There are several regulatory bodies in the United Kingdom providing accredited plumbing qualifications, including [[City and Guilds of London Institute]] and [[Pearson PLC]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | title =Plumbing Qualifications in the UK | newspaper = | location = | pages = | language = | publisher = Local Heroes | url =https://www.localheroes.com/advice/how-to-become-a-plumber| accessdate =27 February 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

===Australia===

Plumbers in Australia have licensing requirements that differ from state to state but it is generally accepted a 4-year apprenticeship with a further minimum experience of 2 years (6 years total) and a further curricular requirement as a benchmark for licensing. Licensed plumbers are also expected to maintain minimum relevant training requirements to maintain their plumbing license

== Dangers ==

===Type of Danger===
There are many types of dangers to a plumber. Some of them are strains and sprains, cuts and lacerations, bruises and  contusions, fractures, burns and scalds, foreign bodies in the eye, and hernias.&lt;ref&gt;[https://fraser.stlouisfed.org/files/docs/publications/bls/bls_1079_1952.pdf "Injuries  and  Accident  Causes in  Plumbing  Operations" United States Department of Labor. 1949]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ditch collapse and Holes===
On a construction site there are many dangers. Without protective measures, a ditch can collapse on a plumber who is at the bottom of one.&lt;ref&gt;[https://consumer.healthday.com/encyclopedia/work-and-health-41/occupational-health-news-507/plumbers-pipe-dreams-646645.html "Plumber Mike Tehle could handle everything from clogged-up pipes to deep sewer lines. But he never planned on being buried alive."]&lt;/ref&gt; A plumber can also fall down a hole.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pressreader.com/canada/montreal-gazette/20100423/281668251179319 "Blue Collar's Death Probed"]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acids and Bases ===
When a person has a blockage in their sewage system they often try to fix it themselves by adding an acid or a base such as [[Drano]] in an attempt to dissolve or dislodge the problem. These chemicals can get into the plumbers eyes &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webmd.com/eye-health/chemical-eye-burns#1 "Chemical Eye Burns"]&lt;/ref&gt;when the sewage is splashed during the repair. The plumbers skin during the repair does come into contact with the sewage water.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.constructionenquirer.com/2011/03/03/plumber-in-sulphuric-acid-burn-horror/ "Plumber in sulphuric acid burn horror" ]&lt;/ref&gt; The owner of the toilet might not report to the plumber they have already tried [[Drano]] a highly caustic base .

===Infectious disease risks associated with occupational exposure===
Plumbers risk infections&lt;ref&gt;[https://oem.bmj.com/content/69/2/140 "Infectious disease risks associated with occupational exposure: a systematic review of the literature" ]&lt;/ref&gt; when dealing with human waste when repairing sewage systems.  Microbes can be excreted in the [[feces]] or [[vomit]] of the sufferer onto the toilet or sewage pipes. Human waste can contain infectious diseases such as [[cholera]], [[typhoid]], [[hepatitis]], [[polio]], [[cryptosporidiosis]], [[ascariasis]], and [[schistosomiasis]].

==Other uses==
The term "[[White House Plumbers]]" was a popular name given to the covert White House Special Investigations Unit established on July 24, 1971 during the presidency of [[Richard Nixon]]. Their job was to plug intelligence "[[News leak|leaks]]" in the U.S. Government relating to the [[Vietnam War]] (i.e. the [[Pentagon Papers]]); hence the term "plumbers".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=II. The Plumbers|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/past/docs/issues/82may/hershwh3.htm|publisher=''[[The Atlantic]]''|accessdate=17 September 2013|quote=In the early evening of June 17, 1971, Henry Kissinger held forth in the Oval Office, telling his President, and John Ehrlichman and Bob Haldeman, all about Daniel Ellsberg. Kissinger's comments were recorded, of course, on the hidden White House taping system, and four years later, a portion of that tape was listened to by the Watergate Special Prosecution Force, which was then investigating the internal White House police unit known as the Plumbers.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2242">[[Image:PouchLaminator.jpg|300px|thumb|Pouch Laminator Kit]]
A '''pouch laminator''' uses a [[lamination]] pouch that is usually sealed on one side. The inside of the lamination pouch is coated with a heat-activated film that adheres to the product being laminated as it runs through the laminator. The substrate side of the board contains a heat-activated [[adhesive]] that bonds the print to the substrate. This can be any of a number of board products or another sheet of laminate. The pouch containing the print, laminate, and substrate is passed through a set of heated rollers under pressure, ensuring that all adhesive layers bond to one another.

Pouch laminators are designed for moderate use in the office or home. For continuous, large-volume lamination projects, a [[heated roll laminators|roll laminator]] performs more efficiently.

Pouches can be bought with different thicknesses in micrometres. Standard home or office machines normally use 80–250 micrometre pouches, depending on the quality of the machine. The thicker the pouch, the higher the cost. Pouches can also measured in mil, which equals one thousandth of an inch. The most common pouch thicknesses are 3, 5, 7 and 10 mil (76,127,178 and 254 μm).

Certain pouches such as butterfly pouches can be used with a pouch laminator to form [[ID cards]]. Butterfly pouches are available with magnetic stripes embedded.

==Maintenance==
Many pouch laminators require the use of a carrier. A carrier holds the pouch as it is run through the laminator. This helps prevent the hot glue, some of which leaks from the sides of the pouches during the process, from gumming up the rollers. The carrier prevents the rollers from getting sticky, which helps to prevent the lamination pouch from wrapping around the rollers inside the laminator.

Many newer laminators claim that they can be used without a carrier. However the use of carriers will extend the laminator's life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abcoffice.com/how-to-use-a-pouch-laminator.htm |title=How To Use A Pouch Laminator |accessdate=2009-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Property Management Systems''' also known as PMS or Hotel Operating System (Hotel OS), under business terms may be used in real estate, manufacturing, logistics, intellectual property, government or hospitality accommodation management.  They are computerized systems that facilitate the management of properties, personal property, equipment, including maintenance, legalities and personnel all through a single piece of software.  They replaced old-fashioned, paper-based methods that tended to be both cumbersome and inefficient. They are often deployed as client/server configurations. Today, most next generation property management systems favour a [[Software_as_a_service|software-as-a-service (SaaS)]] model sustained by [[World Wide Web|web]] and [[Cloud Computing|cloud]] technologies.

==Hospitality industry==

The first property management systems in the [[hospitality industry]] appeared on the market in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hospitalitynet.org/news/4017990.html Hotels - A Brief History&lt;/ref&gt; In hotels a property management system, also known as a PMS, is a comprehensive software application used to cover objectives like coordinating the operational functions of front office, sales and planning, reporting etc. The system automates hotel operations like guest bookings, guest details, online reservations, posting of charges, point of sale, telephone, accounts receivable, sales and marketing, events, food and beverage costing, materials management, HR and payroll, maintenance management, quality management and other amenities. Hotel property management systems may have integrated or interface with third-party solutions like central reservation systems and revenue or [[yield management]] systems, online booking engine, [[back office]], [[point of sale]], door-locking, housekeeping optimization, pay-TV, energy management, payment card authorization and channel management systems.&lt;ref&gt;http://digitalcommons.fiu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1036&amp;context=hospitalityreview Front-of-the-House Computer Systems: A User's
Guide, Steven V. Moll, Florida International University&lt;/ref&gt;

With the advancement of [[cloud computing]] property management systems for hotels expand their functionality towards new service areas like guest-facing features. These include online check-in, room service, in-room controls, guest-staff communication, virtual concierge and more.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hospitalityupgrade.com/_magazine/magazine_Detail.asp?ID=686 Tablets – T-Commerce: Innovative Guest-facing Applications by Michael L. Kasavana, Ph.D., NCE, CHTP&lt;/ref&gt; These new functionalities are mainly used by guests on their own mobile devices or such provided by the hotel in lobbies and/or rooms.

A good PMS should give accurate and timely information on the basic key performance indicators of a hotel business such as [[average daily rate]], [[RevPAR]] or occupancy rate and help the food and beverage management control the stocks in the store room and help deciding what to buy, how much and how often.

==Local government==

Property management systems are used in local government authorities, since these authorities hold and manage large property estates ranging from schools, leisure centres, social housing and parks not to mention investment properties such as shops and industrial estates - even pubs. All of these are necessary income earners for a local authority, so the efficiency gained through an automated, computerized system is essential.

==Manufacturing and logistics industries==
Property management systems are used to manage, control and account for personal property.
Property is defined as the equipment, tooling and physical capital assets that are acquired and used to build, repair and maintain end item deliverables. Property Management involves the processes, systems and manpower required to manage the life cycle of all acquired property as defined above including Acquisition, Control, Accountability, Maintenance, Utilization, and disposition.

==Commercial properties==
Property Management systems allow local property managers and maintenance personnel manage the day-to-day operations of their properties. Property maintenance for commercial properties includes major focus areas such as risk management, maintenance, communication, and tenant satisfaction. Usually a certain agreed percentage of the rent payment will be deducted on each rent payment collected by the property management as their service fee. There are also other ways of charging the property owners using the service but percentage collection is the common one.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14897">[[File:SR20 pyranometer 1.jpg|thumb|347x347px|Typical pyranometer, here a secondary standard (according to ISO 9060)]]
A '''pyranometer''' is a type of [[actinometer]] used for measuring [[solar irradiance]] on a planar surface and it is designed to measure the solar radiation [[flux density]] (W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) from the hemisphere above within a wavelength range 0.3 μm to 3 μm. The name pyranometer stems from the Greek words ''πῦρ'' (pyr), meaning "fire", and ''ἄνω'' (ano), meaning "above, sky".

A typical pyranometer does not require any power to operate. However, recent technical development includes use of electronics in pyranometers, which do require (low) external power.''

== Explanation ==
[[File:Solar_Spectrum_and_Spectral-Response.png|454x454px|right|Spectrum and Spectral Response.]]
The solar radiation [[spectrum]] that reaches earth's surface extends its wavelength approximately from 300&amp;nbsp;nm to 2800&amp;nbsp;nm.
Depending on the type of pyranometer used, irradiance measurements with different degrees of spectral sensitivity will be obtained.

To make a measurement of [[irradiance]], it is required by definition that the response to “beam” radiation varies with the [[cosine]] of the angle of incidence. This ensures a full response when the solar radiation hits the sensor perpendicularly (normal to the surface, sun at zenith, 0° angle of incidence), zero response when the sun is at the horizon (90° angle of incidence, 90° zenith angle), and 0.5 at a 60° angle of incidence. It follows that a pyranometer should have a so-called “directional response” or “cosine response” that is as close as possible to the ideal cosine characteristic.

== Classification of Pyranometers ==
Following the classifications and definitions noted in the ISO 9060,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.iso.org/standard/16629.html ISO9060] :1990 Classification of Pyranometers&lt;/ref&gt; three types of pyranometers can be recognized and grouped in two different technologies: thermopile technology and silicon semiconductor technology.

The light sensitivity, known as ''''spectral response'''', depends on the type of pyranometer. The figure here above shows the spectral responses of the three types of pyranometer in relation to the Solar Radiation Spectrum. The Solar Radiation Spectrum represents the spectrum of sunlight that reaches the Earth’s surface at sea level, at midday with A.M. ([[Air mass (solar energy)|air mass]]) = 1.5.&lt;br /&gt;
The latitude and altitude influence this spectrum. The spectrum is influenced also by [[aerosol]] and pollution.

=== Thermopile Pyranometers ===
A '''thermopile pyranometer''' is a sensor based on [[thermopile]]s designed to measure the broadband of the solar radiation flux density from a 180° field of view angle. A thermopile pyranometer thus usually measures 300 to 2800&amp;nbsp;nm with a largely flat spectral sensitivity (see the Spectral Response graph) The first generation of thermopile pyranometers had the active part of the sensor equally divided in black and white sectors. Irradiation was calculated from the differential measure between the temperature of the black sectors, exposed to the sun, and the temperature of the white sectors, sectors not exposed to the sun or better said in the shades.

In all thermopile technology, irradiation is proportional to the difference between the temperature of the sun exposed area and the temperature of the shadow area.

==== Design ====
[[File:SR20 pyranometer linedrawing.pdf|thumb|296x296px|Linedrawing of a pyranometer, showing essential parts: (1) cable, (3) and (5) glass domes, (4) black detector surface, (6) sun screen, (7) desiccant indicator, (9) levelling feet, (10) bubble level, (11) connector]]
In order to attain the proper directional and spectral characteristics, a thermopile pyranometer is constructed with the following main components:
*A [[thermopile]] sensor with a black coating. It absorbs all solar radiation, has a flat spectrum covering the 300 to 50,000 nanometer range, and has a near-perfect cosine response.
*A glass dome. It limits the spectral response from 300 to 2,800 nanometers (cutting off the part above 2,800&amp;nbsp;nm), while preserving the 180° field of view. It also shields the thermopile sensor from convection. For first class and secondary standard pyranometers (see ISO 9060 classification of thermopile pyranometers) a second glass dome is used. This construction provides an additional “radiation shield”, resulting in a better thermal equilibrium between the sensor and inner dome, compared to using a single dome. The effect of having a second dome is a strong reduction of instrument offsets.

In the modern thermopile pyranometers the active (hot) junctions of the thermopile are located beneath the black coating surface and are heated by the radiation absorbed from the black coating.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.kippzonen.com/News/572/The-Working-Principle-of-a-Thermopile-Pyranometer#&lt;/ref&gt; The passive (cold) junctions of the thermopile are fully protected from solar radiation and in thermal contact with the pyranometer housing, which serves as a heat-sink.  This prevents any alteration from yellowing or decay when measuring the temperature in the shade, thus impairing the measure of the solar irradiance.

The thermopile generates a small voltage in proportion to the temperature difference between the black coating surface and the instrument housing. This is of the order of 10 µ • VW/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Typically, on a sunny day the output is around 10 mV. Each pyranometer has a unique sensitivity, unless otherwise equipped with electronics for [[Calibration|signal calibration]].

==== Usage ====
Thermopile pyranometers are frequently used in [[meteorology]], [[climatology]], [[climate change]] research, [[building engineering physics]] and in [[Photovoltaic system|photovoltaic systems]].

They are usually installed horizontally in meteorological stations and typically mounted in the 'plane of array' (with the sensor surface parallel to the [[solar panel]]) when used for [[Photovoltaic system performance|monitoring of photovoltaic systems]].

The solar energy industry, in a new [https://webstore.iec.ch/publication/33622 standard, IEC 61724-1:2017], has defined what type of pyranometers should be used depending on the size and category of solar power plant.

=== Photodiode-based Pyranometer ===
Also known as a '''silicon pyranometer''' in the ISO 9060,&lt;ref&gt;ISO9060 - Paragraph 3.4 (1990)&lt;/ref&gt; a photodiode-based pyranometer can detect the portion of the solar spectrum between 400&amp;nbsp;nm and 900&amp;nbsp;nm, with the most performant detecting between 350&amp;nbsp;nm and 1100&amp;nbsp;nm. The photodiode converts the aforementioned solar spectrum frequencies into current at high speed, thanks to the [[photoelectric effect]]. The conversion is influenced by the temperature with a raise in current produced by the raise in temperature (about 0,1% • °C)

==== Design ====
[[File:Photodiode pyranometer.jpg|300x300px|A Photodiode pyranometer, model Quantum |thumb]]
A photodiode-based pyranometer is composed by a housing dome, a [[photodiode]], and a diffuser or optical filters. The photodiode has a small surface area and acts as a sensor. The current generated by the photodiode is proportional to irradiance; an output circuit, such as a [[Transimpedance amplifier]], generates a voltage directly proportional to the photocurrent.  The output is usually on the order of millivolts, the same order of magnitude of thermopile-type pyranometers.

==== Usage ====
Photodiode-based pyranometers are implemented where the quantity of irradiation of the visible solar spectrum, or of certain portions such as UV, IR or PAR ([[Photosynthetically active radiation]]), needs to be calculated. This is done by using diodes with specific spectral responses. 
Photodiode-based pyranometers are the core of [[Light meter|luxmeter]] used in photography, cinema and lighting technique. Sometimes they are also installed close to modules of photovoltaic systems.

=== Photovoltaic Pyranometer ===
Built around the 2000s concurrently with the spread of photovoltaic systems, the '''photovoltaic pyranometer''' is a derivation of the photodiode pyranometer. It answered the need for a single reference photovoltaic cell when measuring the power of cell and photovoltaic modules.&lt;ref&gt;IEC 60904-4:Procedures for establishing calibration traceability&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, each cell and module is tested through flash tests by their respective manufacturers, and thermopile pyranometers do not possess the adequate speed of response nor the same spectral response of a cell. This would create obvious mismatch when measuring power, which would need to be quantified.&lt;ref&gt;EN 60904-2: Requirements for reference solar devices&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;EN 60904-7: Computation of spectral mismatch correction&lt;/ref&gt; In the technical documents, this pyranometer is also known as "reference PV cell", "irradiance sensor", "solarimeter", "solar sensor", as bibliographies are more recent than the ISO 9060.
[[File:ABB Irradiation Sensor.jpg|300x300px|A Photovoltaic-based pyranometer, model LM1-C2 |thumb]]
The active part of the sensor is composed of a photovoltaic cell working in near short-circuit condition. As such, the generated current is directly proportionate to the solar radiation hitting the cell in a range between 350&amp;nbsp;nm and 1150&amp;nbsp;nm. When invested by a luminous radiation in the mentioned range, it produces current as a consequence of the [[photovoltaic effect]]. Its sensitivity is not flat, but it is same as that of Silicon photovoltaic cell. See the Spectral Response graph.

==== Design ====
A photovoltaic pyranometer is essentially assembled with the following parts:

*A metallic container with a fixing staff 
*A small photovoltaic cell 
*Signal conditioning electronics
Silicon sensors such as the photodiode and the photovoltaic cell vary the output in function of temperature. In the more recent models, the electronics compensate the signal with the temperature, therefore removing the influence of temperature out of the values of solar irradiance. Inside several models, the case houses a board for the amplification and [[Signal conditioning|conditioning of the signal]].

==== Usage ====
Photovoltaic pyranometers are used in solar simulators and alongside photovoltaic systems for the calculation of photovoltaic module effective power and system performance. Because the spectral response of a photovoltaic pyranometer is similar to that of a photovoltaic module, it may also be used for preliminary diagnosis of malfunction in photovoltaic systems.

== Standardization and Calibration ==
Both thermopile-type and photovoltaic pyranometers are manufactured according to standards.

=== Thermopile Pyranometers ===
Thermopile Pyranometers follow the ISO 9060 standard, which is also adopted by the [[World Meteorological Organization]] (WMO). This standard discriminates three classes. Rather confusingly, the best is confusingly called "secondary standard" (''i.e.,'' calibrated by direct comparison with the single [[primary instrument]]). The second best is defined as "first class" and the last one "second class".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url=http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=16629
 |title=ISO 9060:1990 Classification of Pyranometers
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Differences in classes are due to a certain number of properties in the sensors: response time, thermal offsets, temperature dependence, directional error, non-stability, non-linearity, spectral selectivity and tilt response. These are all defined in ISO 9060. For a sensor to be classified in a certain category, it needs to fulfill all the minimum requirements for these properties.

The calibration is typically done having the [https://www.pmodwrc.ch/pmod.php?topic=wrc World Radiometric Reference] (WRR) as absolute reference. This is maintained by [https://www.pmodwrc.ch/ PMOD] in [[Davos]], [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url=http://www.pmodwrc.ch/pmod.php?topic=wrc
 |title=World Radiometric Reference}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the [https://www.pmodwrc.ch/pmod.php?topic=wrc World Radiometric Reference] there are private laboratories such as [http://isocalnorthamerica.com/ ISO-Cal North America] who have acquired accreditation for these unique calibrations. For the "secondary standard" pyranometer, calibration is done following [https://www.astm.org/Standards/G167.htm ASTM G167], [https://www.iso.org/standard/17725.html ISO 9847] or [https://www.iso.org/standard/17724.html ISO 9846].&lt;ref&gt;ISO 9846:1993 -Calibration of a Pyranometer Using a Pyrheliometer&lt;/ref&gt;  First and second class pyranometers are usually calibrated according to [https://www.astm.org/Standards/E824.htm ASTM E824], and [https://www.iso.org/standard/17725.html ISO 9847].

=== Photovoltaic Pyranometers ===
Photovoltaic pyranometers are standardized and calibrated under IEC 60904-4 for primary reference samples and under IEC 60904-2 for secondary reference samples and the instruments intended for sale.

In both standards, their respective traceability chain starts with the primary standard known as the Group of Cavity Radiometer by the World Radiometric Reference (WRR).&lt;ref&gt;IEC 60904-4:Procedures for establishing calibration traceability- Table1 and Fig.1&lt;/ref&gt;

== Signal conditioning ==
The natural output value of these pyranometers do not usually exceed tens of millivolt (mV). It is considered a ‘weak’ signal, and as such, rather vulnerable to [[electromagnetic interference]]s, especially where the cable runs across decametrical distances or lies in photovoltaic systems. Thus, these sensors are frequently equipped with signal conditioning electronics, which allows them to amplify its natural output value by 100 or 1000 times.

Another solution implies greater immunities to noises, like a 4-20 mA [[current loop]] or [[Modbus]] over [[RS-485]] output, suitable for ambiances with electromagnetic interferences typical of medium-large scale [[Photovoltaic power station|photovoltaic power stations]]. The equipped electronics often concur to normalize the signal output into a predetermined value and easy integration in the system's [[SCADA]].

Additionally, information on the sensor can be stored in the electronics of the sensor, like calibration history, serial number. Some pyranometers also offer extra information like case temperature and sensor tilt angle.

A '''real-time polymerase chain reaction''' ('''Real-Time PCR'''), also known as quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR), is a [[laboratory technique]] of [[molecular biology]] based on the [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR). It monitors the amplification of a targeted [[DNA]] molecule during the PCR, i.e. in real-time, and not at its end, as in conventional PCR. Real-time PCR can be used quantitatively (quantitative real-time PCR), and semi-quantitatively, i.e. above/below a certain amount of DNA molecules (semi quantitative real-time PCR).

Two common methods for the detection of PCR products in real-time PCR are: (1) non-specific [[fluorescent dye]]s that [[Intercalation (biochemistry)|intercalate]] with any double-stranded DNA, and (2) sequence-specific [[DNA probe]]s consisting of [[oligonucleotide]]s that are labelled with a [[fluorescence|fluorescent]] reporter which permits detection only after [[nucleic acid hybridisation|hybridization]] of the probe with its complementary sequence.

The Minimum Information for Publication of Quantitative Real-Time PCR Experiments (MIQE) guidelines propose that the abbreviation ''qPCR'' be used for quantitative real-time PCR and that ''RT-qPCR'' be used for reverse transcription–qPCR.&lt;ref name=Bustin2009&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bustin SA, Benes V, Garson JA, Hellemans J, Huggett J, Kubista M, Mueller R, Nolan T, Pfaffl MW, Shipley GL, Vandesompele J, Wittwer CT |title=The MIQE guidelines: minimum information for publication of quantitative real-time PCR experiments |journal=Clinical Chemistry |volume=55 |issue=4 |pages=611–22 |year=2009 |pmid=19246619 |doi=10.1373/clinchem.2008.112797 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The acronym "RT-PCR" commonly denotes [[reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction]] and not real-time PCR, but not all authors adhere to this convention.&lt;ref name="Logan et al."&gt;{{cite book|editors=Logan J, Edwards K, Saunders N|year= 2009|title=Real-Time PCR: Current Technology and Applications|publisher=Caister Academic Press|isbn=978-1-904455-39-4|author1=edited by Julie Logan |author2=Kirstin Edwards |author3=Nick Saunders.  |last-author-amp=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
[[File:Molecular Beacons.jpg|thumb|300px|Real time PCR uses [[fluorophore]]s in order to detect levels of [[gene expression]].]]
Cells in all organisms regulate [[gene expression]] by turnover of gene transcripts (single stranded [[RNA]]): The amount of an expressed gene in a cell can be measured by the number of copies of an RNA transcript of that gene present in a sample. In order to robustly detect and quantify gene expression from small amounts of RNA, amplification of the gene transcript is necessary. The [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) is a common method for amplifying DNA; for RNA-based PCR the RNA sample is first reverse-transcribed to [[complementary DNA]] (cDNA) with [[reverse transcriptase]].

In order to amplify small amounts of DNA, the same methodology is used as in conventional PCR using a DNA template, at least one pair of specific [[Primer (molecular biology)|primers]], [[deoxyribonucleotide]]s, a suitable [[buffer solution]] and a thermo-stable [[DNA polymerase]]. A substance marked with a [[fluorophore]] is added to this mixture in a [[thermal cycler]] that contains [[sensor]]s for measuring the [[fluorescence]] of the fluorophore after it has been excited at the required [[wavelength]] allowing the generation rate to be measured for one or more specific products. 
This allows the rate of generation of the amplified product to be measured at  each PCR cycle. The data thus generated can be analysed by computer software to calculate ''relative gene expression'' (or ''mRNA copy number'') in several samples. Quantitative PCR can also be applied to the detection and quantification of DNA in samples to determine the presence and abundance of a particular DNA sequence in these samples.&lt;ref name="watson"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Watson|first1=J D|last2=Baker|first2=T A|last3=Bell|first3=S P|last4=Gann|first4=A|last5=Levine|first5=M|last6=Losick|first6=R|title=Molecular Biology of the Gene|date=2004|publisher=Benjamin Cummings|location=San Francisco|isbn=0-321-22368-3|edition=Fifth}}&lt;/ref&gt; This measurement is made after each amplification cycle, and this is the reason why this method is called real time PCR (that is, immediate or simultaneous PCR). In the case of RNA quantitation, the template is [[complementary DNA]] (cDNA), which is obtained by [[Reverse transcriptase#Process of reverse transcription|reverse transcription]] of [[ribonucleic acid]] (RNA). In this instance the technique used is quantitative RT-PCR or Q-RT-PCR.

Quantitative PCR and [[DNA microarray]] are modern methodologies for studying [[gene expression]]. Older methods were used to measure mRNA abundance: [[Differential display]], [[RNase protection assay]] and [[Northern blot]]. [[Northern Blot|Northern blotting]] is often used to estimate the expression level of a gene by visualizing the abundance of its mRNA transcript in a sample. In this method, purified RNA is separated by [[agarose gel electrophoresis]], transferred to a solid matrix (such as a nylon membrane), and probed with a specific [[Hybridization probe|DNA or RNA probe]] that is [[Complementarity (molecular biology)|complementary]] to the gene of interest. Although this technique is still used to assess gene expression, it requires relatively large amounts of RNA and provides only qualitative or semi quantitative information of mRNA levels.&lt;ref name="Pfaffl"&gt;Michael W. Pfaff, Ales Tichopad, Christian Prgomet and Tanja P. Neuvians (2005). [http://www.springerlink.com/content/g6732750704887n8/ Determination of stable housekeeping genes, differentially regulated target genes and sample integrity: BestKeeper – Excel-based tool using pair-wise correlations] Biotechnology Letters '''26''':509-515&lt;/ref&gt; Estimation errors arising from variations in the quantification method can be the result of DNA integrity, [[enzyme kinetics|enzyme efficiency]] and many other factors. For this reason a number of [[standardization]] systems (often called [[Western blot normalization|normalization methods]]) have been developed. Some have been developed for quantifying total gene expression, but the most common are aimed at quantifying the specific gene being studied in relation to another gene called a normalizing gene, which is selected for its almost constant level of expression. These genes are often selected from [[housekeeping gene]]s as their functions related to basic [[Cell (biology)|cellular]] survival normally imply [[Gene expression#regulation of gene expression|constitutive gene expression]].&lt;ref name="pfaffl"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pfaffl | first1 = MW | last2 = Horgan | first2 = GW | last3 = Dempfle | first3 = L | year = 2002 | title = Relative Expression Software Tool (REST©) for group wise comparison and statistical analysis of relative expression results in real-time PCR | url = http://pt.wkhealth.com/pt/re/nar/abstract.00006178-200205010-00031.htm | journal = Nucleic Acids Res. | volume = 30 | issue = | page = e36 | doi=10.1093/nar/30.9.e36}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Vandesompele | first1 = J | last2 = De Preter | first2 = K | last3 = Pattyn | first3 = F | last4 = Poppe | first4 = B | last5 = Van Roy | first5 = N | last6 = De Paepe | first6 = A | last7 = Speleman | first7 = F | year = 2002 | title = Accurate normalisation of real-time quantitative RT-PCR data by geometric averaging of multiple internal control genes | url = http://genomebiology.com/2002/3/7/RESEARCH/0034./ABSTRACT/ADDITIONAL/ABSTRACT/COMMENTS/additional/ | journal = Gen.

The most commonly used normalizing genes are those that code for the following molecules: [[tubulin]], [[glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase]], [[albumin]], [[cyclophilin]], and [[ribosomal RNA]]s.&lt;ref name="Pfaffl" /&gt;

== Basic principles ==
{{Main article | Polymerase chain reaction}}
Real-time PCR is carried out in a [[thermal cycler]] with the capacity to illuminate each sample with a beam of light of at least one specified wavelength and detect the fluorescence emitted by the excited [[fluorophore]].  The thermal cycler is also able to rapidly heat and chill samples, thereby taking advantage of the physicochemical properties of the [[nucleic acid]]s and [[DNA polymerase]].

The PCR process generally consists of a series of temperature changes that are repeated 25 – 50 times. These cycles normally consist of three stages: the first, at around 95&amp;nbsp;°C, allows the separation of the nucleic acid's double chain; the second, at a temperature of around 50-60&amp;nbsp;°C, allows the binding of the primers with the DNA template;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Rychlik W, Spencer WJ, Rhoads RE | title=Optimization of the annealing temperature for DNA amplification ''in vitro''| journal=Nucleic Acids Res| year=1990 |volume=18|pmid=2243783 | doi = 10.1093/nar/18.21.6409| issue=21| pmc=332522| pages=6409–6412}}&lt;/ref&gt; the third, at between 68 - 72&amp;nbsp;°C, facilitates the [[polymerization]] carried out by the DNA polymerase. Due to the small size of the fragments the last step is usually omitted in this type of PCR as the enzyme is able to increase their number during the change between the alignment stage and the denaturing stage. In addition, in four step PCR the fluorescence is measured during short temperature phase lasting only a few seconds in each cycle, with a temperature of, for example, 80&amp;nbsp;°C, in order to reduce the signal caused by the presence of primer dimers when a non-specific dye is used.&lt;ref&gt;http://gene-quantification.org/biochemica-3-2000.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The temperatures and the timings used for each cycle depend on a wide variety of parameters, such as: the enzyme used to synthesize the DNA, the concentration of divalent ions and [[deoxyribonucleotide]]s (dNTPs) in the reaction and the bonding temperature of the primers.&lt;ref name=molecular_cloning&gt;{{cite book |author1=Joseph Sambrook  |author2=David W. Russel |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2001|title=Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual|edition= 3rd|publisher= Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press|location= Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y.|isbn= 0-87969-576-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chemical classification ==
Real-time PCR technique can be classified by the chemistry used to detect the PCR product, specific or non-specific fluorochromes.

===Non-specific detection: Real-time PCR with double-stranded DNA-binding dyes as reporters===

A DNA-binding dye binds to all double-stranded (ds) [[DNA]] in PCR, causing fluorescence of the dye. An increase in DNA product during PCR therefore leads to an increase in fluorescence intensity measured at each cycle. However, dsDNA dyes such as [[SYBR Green]] will bind to all dsDNA PCR products, including nonspecific PCR products (such as [[Primer dimer]]). This can potentially interfere with, or prevent, accurate monitoring of the intended target sequence.

In real-time PCR with dsDNA dyes the reaction is prepared as usual, with the addition of fluorescent dsDNA dye. Then the reaction is run in a [[Quantitative PCR instrument|real-time PCR instrument]], and after each cycle, the intensity of fluorescence is measured with a detector; the dye only fluoresces when bound to the dsDNA (i.e., the PCR product). 
This method has the advantage of only needing a pair of primers to carry out the amplification, which keeps costs down; multiple target sequences can be monitored in a tube by using different types of dyes.

===Specific detection: fluorescent reporter probe method===
[[File:TaqMan Probes.jpg|thumb|750px|(1) In intact probes, reporter fluorescence is quenched. (2) Probes and the complementary DNA strand are hybridized and reporter fluorescence is still quenched. (3) During PCR, the probe is degraded by the Taq polymerase and the fluorescent reporter released.]]

[[fluorescence|Fluorescent]] reporter probes detect only the DNA containing the sequence complementary to the probe; therefore, use of the reporter probe significantly increases specificity, and enables performing the technique even in the presence of other dsDNA. Using different-coloured labels, fluorescent probes can be used in multiplex assays for monitoring several target sequences in the same tube. The specificity of fluorescent reporter probes also prevents interference of measurements caused by [[Primer Dimer|primer dimers]], which are undesirable potential by-products in PCR. However, fluorescent reporter probes do not prevent the inhibitory effect of the primer dimers, which may depress accumulation of the desired products in the reaction.

The method relies on a DNA-based probe with a fluorescent reporter at one end and a [[Quenching (fluorescence)|quencher]] of fluorescence at the opposite end of the probe. The close proximity of the reporter to the quencher prevents detection of its fluorescence; breakdown of the probe by the 5' to 3' [[exonuclease]] activity of the [[Taq polymerase]] breaks the reporter-quencher proximity and thus allows unquenched emission of fluorescence, which can be detected after [[Excited state|excitation]] with a laser. An increase in the product targeted by the reporter probe at each PCR cycle therefore causes a proportional increase in fluorescence due to the breakdown of the probe and release of the reporter.

#The PCR is prepared as usual (see [[PCR]]), and the reporter probe is added.
#As the reaction commences, during the [[Annealing (biology)|annealing]] stage of the PCR both probe and primers anneal to the DNA target.
#Polymerisation of a new DNA strand is initiated from the primers, and once the polymerase reaches the probe, its 5'-3'-exonuclease degrades the probe, physically separating the fluorescent reporter from the quencher, resulting in an increase in fluorescence.
#Fluorescence is detected and measured in a real-time PCR machine, and its geometric increase corresponding to exponential increase of the product is used to determine the quantification cycle [[Cycle of quantification/qualification|(C&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt;)]] in each reaction.

== Fusion temperature analysis ==
[[File:Melting Ponchel2003.jpg|thumb|Distinct fusion curves for a number of PCR products (showing distinct colours). Amplification reactions can be seen for a specific product (pink, blue) and others with a negative result (green, orange). The fusion peak indicated with an arrow shows the peak caused by primer dimers, which is different from the expected amplification product.&lt;ref name=Ponchel2003&gt;{{cite journal | year= 2003 | title = Real-time PCR based on SYBR-Green I fluorescence: An alternative to the TaqMan assay for a relative quantification of gene rearrangements, gene amplifications and micro gene deletions | journal= BMC Biotechnol | volume= 3 | pages= 18 | doi = 10.1186/1472-6750-3-18 | url = http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6750/3/18/ | format= w |author1=Ponchel F |author2=Toomes C |author3=Bransfield K |author4=Leong F.T |author5=Douglas S.H |author6=Field S.L |author7=Bell S.M |author8=Combaret V |author9=Puisieux A |author10=Mighell A.J }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Real-time PCR permits the identification of specific, amplified DNA fragments using analysis of their [[Nucleic acid thermodynamics|melting temperature]] (also called ''T&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' value, from m''elting'' t''emperature''). The method used is usually PCR with double-stranded DNA-binding dyes as reporters and the dye used is usually SYBR Green. The DNA melting temperature is specific to the amplified fragment. The results of this technique are obtained by comparing the dissociation curves of the analysed DNA samples.&lt;ref name=Ririe1997&gt;{{Cite journal | year= 1997 | title = Product Differentiation by Analysis of DNA Melting Curves during the Polymerase Chain Reaction | journal= Analytical Biochemistry | volume= 245 | pages= 154–160 | doi = 10.1006/abio.1996.9916 | url = http://www.sh.lsuhsc.edu/oor/crf/PCR_prep2.pdf | pmid=9056205 |author1=Ririe K.M |author2=Rasmussen R.P |author3=Wittwer C.T. | issue= 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike conventional PCR, this method avoids the previous use of [[electrophoresis]] techniques to demonstrate the results of all the samples. This is because, despite being a kinetic technique, quantitative PCR is usually evaluated at a distinct end point. The technique therefore usually provides more rapid results and / or uses fewer reactants than electrophoresis. If subsequent electrophoresis is required it is only necessary to test those samples that real time PCR has shown to be doubtful and / or to ratify the results for samples that have tested positive for a specific determinant.

=== Modeling ===
Unlike end point PCR (conventional PCR), real time PCR allows monitoring of the desired product at any point in the amplification process by measuring fluorescence (in real time frame, measurement is made of its level over a given threshold). A commonly employed method of DNA quantification by real-time PCR relies on plotting fluorescence against the number of cycles on a [[logarithmic scale]]. A threshold for detection of DNA-based fluorescence is set 3-5 times of the [[standard deviation]] of the signal noise above background. The number of cycles at which the fluorescence exceeds the threshold is called the threshold cycle (C&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;) or, according to the MIQE guidelines, quantification cycle [[Cycle of quantification/qualification|(C&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt;)]].&lt;ref name="S. A. Bustin et al."&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Stephen A. Bustin |author2=Vladimir Benes |author3=Jeremy A.

During the exponential amplification phase, the quantity of the target DNA template (amplicon) doubles every cycle. For example, a DNA sample whose C&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt; precedes that of another sample by 3 cycles contained 2&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 8 times more template. However, the efficiency of amplification is often variable among primers and templates. Therefore, the efficiency of a primer-template combination is assessed in a [[titration]] experiment with serial dilutions of DNA template to create a [[standard curve]] of the change in [[Cycle of quantification/qualification|(C&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt;)]] with each dilution. The [[slope]] of the [[linear regression]] is then used to determine the efficiency of amplification, which is 100% if a dilution of 1:2 results in a [[Cycle of quantification/qualification|(C&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt;)]] difference of 1. The cycle threshold method makes several assumptions of reaction mechanism and has a reliance on data from low signal-to-noise regions of the amplification profile that can introduce substantial variance during the data analysis.&lt;ref name=Carr2012&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Carr | first1 = A.

To quantify gene expression, the [[Cycle of quantification/qualification|(C&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt;)]] for an RNA or DNA from the gene of interest is subtracted from the [[Cycle of quantification/qualification|(C&lt;sub&gt;q&lt;/sub&gt;)]] of RNA/DNA from a housekeeping gene in the same sample to normalize for variation in the amount and quality of RNA between different samples. This normalization procedure is commonly called the ''ΔC&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;-method''&lt;ref name="Schefe"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Schefe JH, Lehmann KE, Buschmann IR, Unger T, Funke-Kaiser H |year= 2006|title=Quantitative real-time RT-PCR data analysis: current concepts and the novel "gene expression's CT difference" formula|journal=J Mol Med |volume=84|pages=901–10|pmid=16972087|doi=10.1007/s00109-006-0097-6|pmc=|issue=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and permits comparison of expression of a gene of interest among different samples. However, for such comparison, expression of the normalizing reference gene needs to be very similar across all the samples. Choosing a reference gene fulfilling this criterion is therefore of high importance, and often challenging, because only very few genes show equal levels of expression across a range of different conditions or tissues.&lt;ref name="Nailis"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Nailis H, Coenye T, Van Nieuwerburgh F, Deforce D, Nelis HJ |year= 2006|title=Development and evaluation of different normalization strategies for gene expression studies in Candida albicans biofilms by real-time PCR|journal=BMC Mol.

Mechanism-based qPCR quantification methods have also been suggested, and have the advantage that they do not require a standard curve for quantification.  Methods such as MAK2&lt;ref name="Boggy"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Boggy G, Woolf  PJ|year= 2010|pages=e12355|issue=8|title=A Mechanistic Model of PCR for Accurate Quantification of Quantitative PCR Data|volume=5|journal=PLOS ONE|pmid=20814578|pmc=2930010|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0012355|editor1-last=Ravasi|editor1-first=Timothy}}&lt;/ref&gt; have been shown to have equal or better quantitative performance to standard curve methods.  These mechanism-based methods use knowledge about the polymerase amplification process to generate estimates of the original sample concentration. An extension of this approach includes an accurate model of the entire PCR reaction profile, which allows for the use of high signal-to-noise data and the ability to validate data quality prior to analysis.&lt;ref name=Carr2012/&gt;

According to research of Ruijter et al.&lt;ref name="Ruijter"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Ruijter JM, Pfaffl MW, Zhao S, Spiess AN, Boggy G, Blom J, Rutledge RG, Sisti D, Lievens A, De Preter K, Derveaux S, Hellemans J, Vandesompele J |year= 2012|pages=e12355|title=Evaluation of qPCR curve analysis methods for reliable biomarker discovery: bias, resolution, precision, and implications|journal=Methods|doi=10.1016/j.ymeth.2012.08.011|pmid=22975077|volume=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; MAK2 assumes constant amplification efficiency during the PCR reaction. However, theoretical analysis of polymerase chain reaction, from which MAK2 was derived, has revealed that amplification efficiency is not constant throughout PCR. While MAK2 quantification provides reliable estimates of target DNA concentration in a sample under normal qPCR conditions, MAK2 does not reliably quantify target concentration for qPCR assays with competimeters.

== Applications  ==
There are numerous applications for quantitative polymerase chain reaction in the [[laboratory]]. It is commonly used for both [[Clinical laboratory|diagnostic]] and [[basic research]]. Uses of the technique in industry include the quantification of microbial load in foods or on vegetable matter, the detection of GMOs ([[Genetically modified organisms]]) and the quantification and genotyping of human viral pathogens.

=== Quantification of gene expression ===
Quantifying gene expression by traditional DNA detection methods is unreliable. Detection of [[mRNA]] on a [[Northern blot]] or PCR products on a [[Agarose gel electrophoresis|gel]] or [[Southern blot]] does not allow precise quantification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=PEMF For Treatment Of Corneal Disorders|url=http://lemuriatechnologies.com/index.php/component/joomgalaxy/Entry-Detail/PEMF%20for%20treatment%20of%20corneal%20disorders%20and%20injuries?lang=en|author=Bruce Gelerter|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140609040341/http://lemuriatechnologies.com/index.php/component/joomgalaxy/Entry-Detail/PEMF%20for%20treatment%20of%20corneal%20disorders%20and%20injuries?lang=en|archivedate=2014-06-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, over the 20-40 cycles of a typical PCR, the amount of DNA product reaches a [[plateau (mathematics)|plateau]] that is not directly correlated with the amount of target DNA in the initial PCR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Overbergh, Giulietti et al |title=The use of real-time reverse transcriptase PCR for the quantification of cytokine gene expression |journal=Journal of biomolecular techniques |date=2003 |volume=14 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Real-time PCR can be used to quantify [[nucleic acid]]s by two common methods: relative quantification and absolute quantification.&lt;ref name="S. Dhanasekaran et al."&gt;{{cite journal|date=Mar 2010|title=Comparison of different standards for real-time PCR-based absolute quantification|journal=Immunol Methods.|volume=354|issue=1–2|pages=34–9|doi=10.1016/j.jim.2010.01.004|pmid=20109462|author=S. Dhanasekaran, T. Mark Doherty, John Kenneth and TB Trials Study Group.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Absolute quantification gives the exact number of target DNA molecules by comparison with DNA standards using a [[calibration curve]]. It is therefore essential that the PCR of the sample and the standard have the same [[Gene duplication|amplification efficiency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bar|first=Tzachi|last2=Kubista|first2=Mikael|last3=Tichopad|first3=Ales|date=2011-10-19|title=Validation of kinetics similarity in qPCR|url=http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/content/early/2011/10/18/nar.gkr778|journal=Nucleic Acids Research|language=en|pages=gkr778|doi=10.1093/nar/gkr778|issn=0305-1048|pmc=3287174|pmid=22013160|volume=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Relative quantification is based on internal reference genes to determine fold-differences in expression of the target gene. The quantification is expressed as the change in expression levels of mRNA interpreted as [[complementary DNA]] (cDNA, generated by [[Reverse transcriptase#Process of reverse transcription|reverse transcription]] of mRNA). Relative quantification is easier to carry out as it does not require a calibration curve as the amount of the studied gene is compared to the amount of a control reference gene.

As the units used to express the results of relative quantification are unimportant the results can be compared across a number of different RT-Q-PCR. The reason for using one or more housekeeping genes is to correct non-specific variation, such as the differences in the quantity and quality of RNA used, which can affect the efficiency of reverse transcription and therefore that of the whole PCR process. However, the most crucial aspect of the process is that the reference gene must be stable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Yakovlev|first2=IA|last3=Strauss|first3=SH|year=2004|title=Validating internal controls for quantitative plant gene expression studies|url=http://www.plantphysiol.org/cgi/external_ref?access_num=15317655&amp;link_type=MED|journal=BMC Plant Biol|volume=4|issue=|page=14|last1=Brunner|first1=AM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The selection of these reference genes was traditionally carried out in [[molecular biology]] using qualitative or semi-quantitative studies such as the visual examination of RNA gels, Northern blot [[densitometry]] or semi-quantitative PCR (PCR mimics). Now, in the [[genome]] era, it is possible to carry out a more detailed estimate for many organisms using [[Transcriptomics technologies|transcriptomic technologies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McGettigan|first=Paul A|title=Transcriptomics in the RNA-seq era|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1367593112001585|journal=Current Opinion in Chemical Biology|volume=17|issue=1|pages=4–11|doi=10.1016/j.cbpa.2012.12.008}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, research has shown that amplification of the majority of reference genes used in quantifying the expression of mRNA varies according to experimental conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Zorzi|first2=W|last3=Lakaye|first3=B|last4=De Borman|first4=B|last5=Coumans|first5=B|last6=Henne|first6=G|last7=Grisar|first7=T|last8=Igout|first8=A|last9=Heinen|first9=E|year=1999|title=Housekeeping genes as internal standards: use and limits|url=|journal=J Biotechnol|volume=75|issue=|pages=197–200|doi=10.1016/s0168-1656(99)00163-7|last1=Thellin|first1=O|pmid=10617337}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Thulke|first2=S|last3=Mackay|first3=IM|last4=Landt|first4=O|last5=Siegert|first5=W|last6=Nitsche|first6=A|year=2004|title=Guideline for reference gene selection for quantitative real-time PCR|url=http://www.plantphysiol.org/cgi/external_ref?access_num=14706621&amp;link_type=MED|journal=Biochem Biophys Res Commun|volume=313|issue=|pages=856–862|doi=10.1016/j.bbrc.2003.11.177|pmid=14706621|last1=Radonic|first1=A}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Huggett|first2=JF|last3=Bustin|first3=SA|last4=Johnson|first4=MA|last5=Rook|first5=G|last6=Zumla|first6=A|year=2004|title=Validation of housekeeping genes for normalizing RNA expression in real-time PCR|url=http://www.plantphysiol.org/cgi/external_ref?access_num=15283208&amp;link_type=MED|journal=Biotechniques|volume=37|issue=|pages=112–119|last1=Dheda|first1=K}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is therefore necessary to carry out an initial [[Statistics|statistically]] sound methodological study in order to select the most suitable reference gene.

A number of statistical algorithms have been developed that can detect which gene or genes are most suitable for use under given conditions. Those like geNORM or BestKeeper can compare pairs or [[geometric mean]]s for a matrix of different reference genes and [[Tissue (biology)|tissues]].&lt;ref name="vandesompele"&gt;Vandesompele J, De Preter K, Pattyn F, Poppe B, Van Roy N, De Paepe A, Speleman F (2002) Accurate normalization of real-time quantitative RT-PCR data by geometric averaging of multiple internal control genes" ''Genome Biol'' 37: RESEARCH0034&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Tichopad|first2=A|last3=Prgomet|first3=C|last4=Neuvians|first4=TP|year=2004|title=Determination of stable housekeeping genes, differentially regulated target genes and sample integrity: BestKeeper—Excel-based tool using pair-wise correlations|url=http://www.plantphysiol.org/cgi/external_ref?access_num=15127793&amp;link_type=MED|journal=Biotechnol Lett|volume=26|issue=|pages=509–515|doi=10.1023/b:bile.0000019559.84305.47|last1=Pfaffl|first1=MW}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Diagnostic uses ===
Diagnostic qualitative PCR is applied to rapidly detect [[nucleic acid]]s that are diagnostic of, for example, [[infectious diseases]], [[cancer]] and genetic abnormalities. The introduction of qualitative PCR assays to the [[clinical laboratory|clinical microbiology laboratory]] has significantly improved the diagnosis of [[infectious diseases]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Espy|first=M.J.|date=January 2006|title=Real-Time PCR in Clinical Microbiology: Applications for Routine Laboratory Testing|pmc=1360278|journal=Clinical Microbiology Reviews|volume=19|issue=3|doi=10.1128/CMR.19.1.165-256.2006|pmid=16418529|pages=165–256}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is deployed as a tool to detect newly emerging diseases, such as new strains of [[influenza|flu]], in [[in vitro diagnostics|diagnostic test]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/flu/pdf/professionals/diagnosis/molecular-assay-table-1.pdf ''FDA-cleared RT-PCR Assays and Other Molecular Assays for Influenza Viruses'']&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Microbiological uses ===
Quantitative PCR is also used by microbiologists working in the fields of food safety, food spoilage and fermentation and for the microbial risk assessment of water quality (drinking and recreational waters) and in public health protection.&lt;ref name= FilionM&gt;{{cite book | author= Filion, M (editor) | year=2012 | title=Quantitative Real-time PCR in Applied Microbiology | publisher=[[Caister Academic Press]] | isbn= 978-1-908230-01-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Detection of phytopathogens ===
The agricultural industry is constantly striving to produce plant propagules or seedlings that are free of pathogens in order to prevent economic losses and safeguard health. Systems have been developed that allow detection of small amounts of the DNA of ''[[Phytophthora ramorum]]'', an oomycete that kills [[Oak]]s and other species, mixed in with the DNA of the host plant. Discrimination between the DNA of the pathogen and the plant is based on the amplification of ITS sequences, spacers located in [[ribosomal RNA]] gene's coding area, which are characteristic for each taxon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| author=Baldwin, B.G.| title=Phylogenetic utility of the internal transcribed spacers of nuclear ribosomal DNA in plants: An example from the Compositaogy| journal=Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution| year=1992 |pages=3–16|volume=1 | doi=10.1016/1055-7903(92)90030-K| pmid=1342921| issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Field-based versions of this technique have also been developed for identifying the same pathogen.&lt;ref name=Tomlinson2007&gt;{{ Cite journal | last1= Tomlinson | first1= J.

=== Detection of genetically modified organisms ===
qPCR using reverse transcription (RT-qPCR) can be used to detect [[GMO]]s given its sensitivity and dynamic range in detecting DNA. Alternatives such as DNA or protein analysis are usually less sensitive. Specific primers are used that amplify not the transgene but the [[Promoter (genetics)|promoter]], [[Terminator (genetics)|terminator]] or even intermediate sequences used during the process of engineering the vector. As the process of creating a transgenic plant normally leads to the insertion of more than one copy of the transgene its quantity is also commonly assessed. This is often carried out by relative quantification using a control gene from the treated species that is only present as a single copy.&lt;ref name=Holst-jensen2003&gt;{{Cite journal | authors= Holst-jensen A, R{o}nning S.B, L{o}vseth A, Berdal  K.G. | year= 2003 | title = PCR technology for screening and quantification of genetically modified organisms (GMOs) | journal= Analytical and Bioanalytical Chemistry | volume= 375 | number= 8 | pages= 985–993 | url = http://www.springerlink.com/index/FDVNVCYN343T96Y7.pdf |doi=10.1007/s00216-003-1767-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Brodmann2002&gt;{{Cite journal | year= 2002 | title = … -Time Quantitative Polymerase Chain Reaction Methods for Four Genetically Modified Maize Varieties … | journal= Journal of AOAC International | volume= 85 | pages= 646–653 | doi = 10.5555/jaoi.2002.85.3.646 |author1=Brodmann P.D |author2=Ilg E.C |author3=Berthoud H |author4=Herrmann A. | issue= 3 | pmid= 12083257}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Clinical quantification and genotyping ===
Viruses can be present in humans due to direct infection or co-infections which makes [[diagnosis]] difficult using classical techniques and can result in an incorrect [[prognosis]] and treatment. The use of qPCR allows both the quantification and genotyping (characterization of the strain, carried out using melting curves) of a virus such as the [[Hepatitis B virus]].&lt;ref name=Yeh2004&gt;{{Cite journal | year= 2004 | title = Quantification and genotyping of hepatitis B virus in a single reaction by real-time PCR and melting … | journal= Journal of Hepatology | volume= 41 | pages= 659–666 | doi = 10.1016/j.jhep.2004.06.031 | url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0168827804003009 | author= Yeh S.H.

The degree of infection, quantified as the copies of the viral genome per unit of the patient's tissue, is relevant in many cases; for example, the probability that the type 1 [[herpes simplex virus]] reactivates is related to the number of infected [[neuron]]s in the [[Ganglion|ganglia]].&lt;ref name=Sawtell1998&gt;{{Cite journal | author= Sawtell N.M. | year= 1998 | title = The Probability of in Vivo Reactivation of Herpes Simplex Virus Type 1 Increases with the Number of Latently Infected Neurons in the Ganglia | journal= Journal of Virology | volume= 72 | pages= 6888–6892 | url = http://jvi.asm.org/cgi/content/abstract/72/8/6888 | issue= 8 | pmid= 9658140 | pmc= 109900}}&lt;/ref&gt; This quantification is carried out either with reverse transcription or without it, as occurs if the virus becomes integrated in the human genome at any point in its cycle, such as happens in the case of [[HPV]] (human papillomavirus), where some of its variants are associated with the appearance of [[cervical cancer]].&lt;ref name=Peter2006&gt;{{Cite journal | year= 2006 | title = MYC activation associated with the integration of HPV DNA at the MYC locus in genital tumours | journal= Oncogene | volume= 25 | pages= 5985–5993 | doi = 10.1038/sj.onc.1209625 | url = http://www.nature.com/onc/journal/v25/n44/abs/1209625a.html | format= w | author= Peter M.

'''Semi-active radar homing''' ('''SARH''') is a common type of [[missile guidance]] system, perhaps the most common type for longer-range [[Air-to-air missile|air-to-air]] and [[surface-to-air missile]] systems. The name refers to the fact that the missile itself is only a [[passive radar|passive detector of a radar signal]] – [[Radar illumination|provided by an external (“offboard”) source&amp;nbsp;— as it reflects off the target]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ausairpower.net/TE-Radar-AAMs.html|title=Active and Semiactive Radar Missile Guidance|publisher=Air Power Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radartutorial.eu/05.bistatic/bs04.en.html|title=Bistatic Radar|publisher=Radartutorial.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;(in contrast to [[active radar homing]], which uses an active radar: [[transceiver]]). Semi-active missile systems use [[Bistatic radar|bistatic]] [[continuous-wave radar]].

The NATO [[Multiservice tactical brevity code|brevity code]] for a semi-active radar homing missile launch is '''Fox One'''.

==Concept==
{{Main|Track algorithm}}

[[File:Missile homing.jpg|thumb|Figure 1. Semi-active radar homing flight path geometry.]]The basic concept of SARH is that since almost all detection and tracking systems consist of a [[radar]] system, duplicating this hardware on the missile itself is redundant. The weight of a transmitter reduces the range of any flying object, so passive systems have greater reach. In addition, the [[Angular resolution|resolution]] of a radar is strongly related to the physical size of the antenna, and in the small nose cone of a missile there isn't enough room to provide the sort of accuracy needed for guidance. Instead the larger radar dish on the ground or launch aircraft will provide the needed signal and tracking logic, and the missile simply has to listen to the signal reflected from the target and point itself in the right direction. Additionally, the missile will listen rearward to the launch platform's transmitted signal as a reference, enabling it to avoid some kinds of radar jamming distractions offered by the target.

The SARH system determines the closing velocity using the flight path geometry shown in Figure 1. The closing velocity is used to set the frequency location for the CW receive signal shown at the bottom of the diagram (spectrum). Antenna offset angle of the missile antenna is set after the target is acquired by the missile seeker using the spectrum location set using closing speed. The missile seeker antenna is a [[monopulse radar]] receiver that produces angle error measurements using that fixed position. Flight path is controlled by producing navigation input to the steering system (tail fins or gimbaled rocket) using angle errors produced by the antenna. This steers the body of the missile to hold the target near the centerline of the antenna while the antenna is held in a fixed position. The offset angle geometry is determined by [[analytical dynamics|flight dynamics]] using missile speed, target speed, and separation distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fas.org/man/dod-101/navy/docs/fun/part15.htm|title=Chapter 15. Guidance and Control|publisher=Federation of American Scientists}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Techniques are nearly identical using [[Radar jamming and deception|jamming signals]], optical guidance video, and [[infra-red radiation]] for homing.

Maximum range is increased in SARH systems using navigation data in the homing vehicle to increase the travel distance before antenna tracking is needed for terminal guidance. Navigation relies on [[Accelerometer|acceleration data]], [[Fibre optic gyroscope|gyroscopic data]], and [[global positioning system|global positioning data]]. This maximizes distance by minimizing corrective maneuvers that waste flight energy.

Contrast this with [[beam riding]] systems, like the [[RIM-8 Talos]], in which the radar is pointed at the target and the missile keeps itself centered in the beam by listening to the signal at the rear of the missile body. In the SARH system the missile listens for the reflected signal at the nose, and is still responsible for providing some sort of “lead” guidance. The disadvantages of [[beam riding]] are twofold: One is that a radar signal is “fan shaped”, growing larger, and therefore less accurate, with distance. This means that the beam riding system is not accurate at long ranges, while SARH is largely independent of range and grows more accurate as it approaches the target, or the source of the reflected signal it listens for. Reduced accuracy means the missile must use a very large warhead to be effective (i.e.: nuclear). Another requirement is that a beam riding system must accurately track the target at high speeds, typically requiring one radar for tracking and another “tighter” beam for guidance.

The SARH system needs only one radar set to a wider pattern.

==Continuous-wave radar==
{{main|Continuous-wave radar}}
Modern SARH systems use [[continuous-wave radar]] (CW radar) for guidance. Even though most modern fighter radars are pulse Doppler sets, most have a CW function to guide radar missiles. A few [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] aircraft, such as some versions of the [[MiG-23]] and [[MiG-27]], used an auxiliary guidance pod or aerial to provide a CW signal. The [[Vympel R-33]] AA missile for [[MiG-31]] interceptor uses SARH as the main type of guidance (with supplement of inertial guidance on initial stage).&lt;!-- added "Modern"; 1960-era Sparrows keyed from single-target nutating antenna pulsed radar systems --&gt;

SARH missiles require tracking radar to acquire the target, and a more narrowly focused illuminator radar to "light up" the target in order for the missile to [[Missile lock-on|lock]] on to the radar return reflected off target.&lt;ref name="AA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ausairpower.net/TE-Radar-AAMs.html|title=Active and Semi-Active Radar Missile Guidance|publisher=Australian Aviation|date=June 1982|author=Carlo Kopp}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The target must remain illuminated for the entire duration of the missile's flight.  This could leave the launch aircraft vulnerable to counterattack, as well as giving the target's electronic warning systems time to detect the attack and engage countermeasures. Because most SARH missiles require guidance during their entire flight, older radars are limited to one target per radar emitter at a time.

The maximum range of a SARH system is determined by energy density of the transmitter. Increasing transmit power can increase energy density. Reducing the noise bandwidth of the transmitter can also increase energy density. [[Spectral density]] matched to the receive radar detection bandwidth is the limiting factor for maximum range.

==Inverse monopulse seeker==
{{main|Inverse monopulse seeker}}

==Electronic counter-countermeasure (ECCM)==
{{main|Electronic counter-countermeasure}}
Recent-generation SARH weapons have superior electronic counter-countermeasure ([[Electronic counter-countermeasures|ECCM]]) capability, but the system still has fundamental limitations. Some newer missiles, such as the [[Standard missile|SM-2]], incorporate terminal semi-active radar homing (TSARH). TSARH missiles use [[inertial guidance]] for most of their flight, only activating their SARH system for the final attack. This can keep the target from realising it is under attack until shortly before the missile strikes. Since the missile only requires guidance during the terminal phase, each radar emitter can be used to engage more targets.  Some of these weapons, like the SM-2, allow the firing platform to update the missile with [[RIM-161 Standard Missile 3#Operation and performance|mid-course updates]] via [[datalink]].

Some of the more effective methods used to defeat semi-active homing radar are flying techniques. These depend upon the pilot knowing that a missile has been launched. The [[global positioning system]] allows a missile to reach the predicted intercept with no datalink, greatly increasing lethality by postponing illumination for most of the missile flight. The pilot is unaware that a launch has occurred, so flying techniques become almost irrelevant. One difficulty is testing, because this feature creates public safety risks if a fault prevents datalink [[self-destruct]] signals when a missile is heading in the wrong direction. Most coastlines are heavily populated, so this risk exists at test centers for sea-based systems that are near the coastlines.

==Combat record==
The combat record of U.S. SARH missiles was unimpressive during the [[Vietnam War]]. [[USAF]] and [[US Navy]] fighters armed with [[AIM-7 Sparrow]] attained a success rate of barely 10%, which tended to amplify the effect of deleting the gun on most [[F-4 Phantom]]s, which carried 4 Sparrows.&lt;ref name="AA"/&gt; While some of the failures were attributable to mechanical failure of 1960s-era electronics, which could be disturbed by pulling a cart over uneven pavement, or pilot error; the intrinsic accuracy of these weapons was low relative to [[AIM-9 Sidewinder|Sidewinder]] and guns{{Citation needed|reason=Considering RoE, why intrinsic?|date=August 2016}}.

Since [[Desert Storm]], most [[F-15 Eagle]] combat victories have been scored with the Sparrow at [[Beyond Visual Range missile|beyond visual range]]. Similar performance has been achieved with the sea-launched [[Standard Missile]].

Soviet systems using SARH have achieved a number of notable successes, notably in the [[Yom Kippur War]], where [[2K12 Kub]] (NATO name SA-6) tactical SAM systems were able to effectively deny airspace to the [[Israeli Air Force]]. A 2K12 also [[Scott_O'Grady|shot down a U.S. F-16]] in the Bosnian War.

==List of missiles==
SARH is a commonly used modern missile guidance methodology, used in multiple missile systems, such as:

* [[AIM-4 Falcon|AIM-4A/E/F Falcon]]
* [[AIM-7 Sparrow]]
* [[AIM-9C Sidewinder]]
* [[AIM-26 Falcon]]
* [[Aspide]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2747">[[File:Smart Module.png|thumb|right|Smart module]]'''Smart modules''' are a type of [[solar panel]] that has a [[power optimizer]] embedded into the solar module at the time of manufacturing.  Typically the power optimizer is embedded in the [[junction box]] of the solar module.  Power optimizers attached to the frame of a solar module, or connected to the [[photovoltaic]] circuit through a connector, are not properly considered smart modules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/solar-electronics-panel-integration-and-the-bankability-challenge |title=Solar Electronics, Panel Integration and the Bankability Challenge |publisher=Greentech Media |date=2012-08-23 |accessdate=2014-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smart modules are different from traditional solar panels because the power electronics embedded in the module offers enhanced functionality such as panel-level [[maximum power point tracking]], monitoring, and enhanced safety.

==History==
Solar panel installers saw significant growth between 2008 and 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seia.org/research-resources/solar-industry-data |title=Solar Industry Data |publisher=SEIA |date= |accessdate=2014-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to that growth many installers had projects that were not "ideal" solar roof tops to work with and had to find solutions to shaded roofs and orientation difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.energy.ca.gov/2007publications/CEC-500-2007-048/CEC-500-2007-048.PDF&lt;/ref&gt;  This challenge was initially addressed by the re-popularization of [[micro-inverter]]s and later the invention of [[power optimizer]]s.

Solar panel manufacturers partnered with micro-inverter companies to create [[AC module]]s and power optimizer companies partnered with module manufacturers to create smart modules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/Solar-Module-OEMs-Seeking-Advantage-with-Inverter-Electronics |title=Solar Module OEMs Seeking Advantage With Inverter Electronics |publisher=Greentech Media |date=2012-10-23 |accessdate=2014-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 many solar panel manufacturers announced and began shipping their smart module solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tigoenergy.com/press-releases/leading-solar-module-oems-display-next-generation-tigo-energy-technology-during-pv |title=Leading Solar Module OEMs To Display Next-generation Tigo Energy Technology During PV Expo Japan |publisher=Tigo Energy |date=2012-02-28 |accessdate=2014-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
It is estimated that smart module shipments will grow rapidly with some manufacturers expecting smart modules will account for 30% of their shipments.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3488">'''Stripper''' was a type of [[List of agricultural machinery#Harvesting / post-harvest|harvesting machine]] common in Australia in the late 19th and early 20th century. [[John Ridley (inventor)|John Ridley]] is now accepted as its inventor, though [[John Wrathall Bull]] argued strongly for the credit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Jones, LJ | title=Engineering Considerations in an Historical Argument – the Ridley-Bull 'Stripper' Controversy | journal=Second National Conference on Engineering Heritage "The Value of Engineering Heritage": Preprints of Papers | publication-date=1985 | publisher=Institution of Engineers, Australia | pages=79–84 | isbn=978-0-85825-250-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The stripper plucks the ears of grain (generally [[wheat]]) without [[winnowing]], and leaving the straw standing. The first strippers were drawn by [[ox|bullocks]] and consisted of a large, wheeled,  box-like machine with a row of spiked prongs in front and with a long pole at the back of the machine for steering. It had the advantage over the early [[reaper]] machines in being able to reap more quickly (of benefit in a hot climate) and having fewer components subject to wearing out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article89781130 |title=Stripper versus Harvester |newspaper=[[The Leader (Melbourne)|The Leader]] |location=Melbourne |date=18 May 1918 |accessdate=27 July 2013 |page=8 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first strippers were improved by adding a beater to knock the heads off the stems. The machines became [[Header (agriculture)|headers]]. Later headers had reciprocating cutter bars at the back of the combs to cut the stems just short of the heads&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Manual of Australian Agriculture|last=Read|first=Robert L|publisher=Butterworths|year=1990|isbn=0 409 30946 X|location=Sydney|pages=683}}&lt;/ref&gt;. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://collection.maas.museum/object/211927|title=Sunshine header-harvester|last=|first=|date=|website=Museum of Applied Arts and Science|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=29 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A stripper-harvester also winnowed the grain, removing the [[chaff]].

Notable manufacturers were [[Sunshine Harvester]], [[J. and D. Shearer]] and [[Mellor Bros.]] (who specialised in "bike strippers", ie. light enough to be drawn by a bicycle).

==Evolution of the header==

The Gallic [[reaper]]  that is seen in Roman times, in the first three centuries of the current era led to the stripper developed in the 19th century. The Gallic reaper had a comb at the front to collect grain heads. An operator would knock the heads into a tray for collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gnrtr.com/Generator.html?pi=208&amp;cp=3|title=History of the Gallic Reaper|last=Chuksin|first=Petr|date=23 January 2006|website=History of Gallic Reaper Evolution Agriculture|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=29 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stripper developed in South Australia used the principles, with a comb at the front, using a mechanical beater to knock the heads off. Later innovations were including a cutter bar similar to the [[Reaper|binder reaper]] and an elevator to lift the heads into a storage bin for later threshing. The combined header-harvester added the winnower to thresh the grain from the heads.

'''Sustainable Electronics Initiative''' (SEI) is an initiative started in the [[United States]] in the summer of 2009 by the Illinois Sustainable Technology Center, which is a division of the Institute of Natural Resource Sustainability of the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]]. SEI is dedicated to developing and implementing [[Sustainability|sustainable]] means for the [[design]], [[manufacturing]], [[remanufacturing]], and [[recycling]] of [[electronics]] ([[computers]], [[cell phones]], [[televisions]], [[Printer (computing)|printers]], etc.) Members of SEI include individuals from [[academia]], [[non-profit organizations]], government agencies, manufacturers, designers, recyclers and refurbishers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Sustainable Electronics Initiative: Mission | year = 2009 | url = http://www.sustainelectronics.illinois.edu/about/mission.cfm | accessdate = 5 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The goals of the Sustainable Electronics Initiative are to provide research, education, technical assistance, and data management for the general public and other interested parties with regards to electronics and [[electronic waste]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Barnes | first = Laura | title = SEI "Ask an Expert" Service Provides Information on Electronics and the Environment | date = 8 September 2009 | url = http://lib.wmrc.uiuc.edu/enb/2009/09/08/sei-ask-an-expert-service-provides-information-on-electronics-and-the-environment/ | accessdate = 7 January 2010 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100620044141/http://lib.wmrc.uiuc.edu/enb/2009/09/08/sei-ask-an-expert-service-provides-information-on-electronics-and-the-environment/ | archivedate = 20 June 2010 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; SEI conducts collaborative research with professors and industry representatives, facilitates networking and information exchange among its participants, promotes the diffusion of technology through demonstration projects, and it provides a forum for discussion of applicable policies and legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Illinois Sustainable Technology Center | title = Strategies for Improving the Sustainability of E-Waste Management Systems: Concept Paper |date = July 2009| url = http://www.sustainelectronics.illinois.edu/concept_paper.pdf | accessdate = 3 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SEI was created as a response to the growing national and international demand for more sustainable electronic designs and more environmentally friendly ways to handle electronics once they reach the end of their useful lives. Currently, individual states have passed laws regarding ewaste, but federal legislation has not yet been passed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Electronics TakeBack Coalition | title = State Legislation | url = http://www.computertakeback.com/legislation/state_legislation.htm | accessdate = 30 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States House of Representatives]] and [[United States Senate]] are, however, currently considering federal legislation which will fund electronics research, recycling, and refurbishing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = Greenemeier | first = Larry | title = U.S. Lags Behind World with Its Patchwork Approach to Curbing E-Waste | publisher = Scientific American | date = 29 October 2009 | url = http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=electronic-waste-control | accessdate = 30 October 2009}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Bill S.1397&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.govtrack.us/congress/billtext.xpd?bill=s111-1397 Bill S.1397]&lt;/ref&gt; was proposed by Senator [[Amy Klobuchar]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]]-[[Minnesota|MN]]) and Senator [[Kirsten Gillibrand]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]]-[[New York (state)|NY]]) in July, 2009. The bill addresses the illegal dumping of electronic waste to undeveloped countries. More importantly, however, the bill also focuses on the importance of research and development for the designing and manufacturing of sustainable electronics, which would be recycled, reused, and refurbished more easily.&lt;ref&gt;Electronic Device Recycling Research and Development Act of 2009, S. 1397, 111th Cong. (2009)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European Union]], on the other hand, has passed several strict laws governing electronic equipment and its disposal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = RoHS Compliance | title = RoHS Compliance in the EU | url = http://www.rohs.eu/english/index.html | accessdate = 30 October 2009 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100105231535/http://www.rohs.eu/english/index.html | archivedate = 5 January 2010 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While one of the SEI goals is to minimize waste, this goal can be reached through the application of [[life cycle analysis|life cycle analyses]]. By analyzing the complete life cycle of a product, SEI will take into consideration the design, processing, manufacturing, use, and disposal stages of electronic equipment. With the use of life cycle analyses, SEI plans to make the overall process of computers and other electronics more sustainable and less environmentally harmful.

==Symposia and workshops==
===The Truth, Tragedy, and Transformation of E-Waste===
This was the first free public talk in the new Lecture Series presented by the Institute of Natural Resource Sustainability at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]]. Willie Cade, the founder and CEO of PC Rebuilders and Recyclers (PCRR) gave a lecture focussing on the current e-waste problems and how refurbishing can help alleviate  the current e-waste  problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = INS November Lecture | publisher = Institute of Natural Resource Sustainability | url = http://www.sustainelectronics.illinois.edu/INRS_Nov_Lecture_flyer_sm.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 30 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Dodson | first = Don | title = Businessman talks about restoring old computers | newspaper = The News-Gazette | date = 12 November 2009 | url = http://www.newsgazette.com/news/local/2009/11/12/businessman_talks_about_restoring_old_computers | accessdate = 16 November 2009}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cade also spoke about current assumptions with regards to e-waste and their possible inaccuracies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Welin | first = Dan | title = University takes action on e-waste | newspaper = The Daili Illini | date = 12 November 2009 | url = http://www.dailyillini.com/news/campus/2009/11/12/university-takes-action-on-e-waste | accessdate = 16 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, free cell phone recycling was offered to attendees of the event, with proceeds going to local nonprofits.

===Electronics &amp; Sustainability Symposium===
Design for Energy and the Environment is the first annual symposium hosted by SEI, which will include presentations from representatives from industry, government agencies, and academia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Sustainable Electronics Initiative Symposium | publisher = Illinois Sustainable Technology Center | url = http://www.sustainelectronics.illinois.edu/services/symposia.cfm | accessdate = 3 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Topics of the symposium include: education, materials and design, life cycle analysis, policies, design for end-of-life, and electronics recovery. In addition, the symposium will include keynote speakers from the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA), [[Dell]], and [[Walmart]]. The symposium welcomes designers, manufacturers, chemists, electrical engineers, government representatives, and all others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Electronics &amp; Sustainability: Design for Energy and the Environment | publisher = GreenBiz.com | url = http://www.greenbiz.com/event/2009/09/01/electronics-sustainability-design-energy-and-environment-1 | accessdate = 7 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and research==
=== Design for Energy and the Environment Laboratory (DEE Lab) ===
The DEE Lab is a new campus research laboratory bringing together faculty and students from design, marketing, business and engineering to solve real world product development problems for industry. Companies are finding that they can no longer compete on the basis of technology alone. User needs must be met through technology, and successful companies must create innovative products that delight customers.  For this reason, the DEE Lab links user-centered/customer focused and technology driven disciplines to work toward common goals and solutions. DEE Lab integrates research and instruction to solve real world problems for industry while preparing students for leadership positions in collaborative product development. DEE Lab’s integral disciplines are industrial design, graphic design, architecture and marketing, given their user centered roles, and engineering to support the integration of technology and manufacturing innovation. DEE Lab’s design process methodology combines customer, technology, business and marketing research with structured analysis, interdisciplinary brainstorming, rapid prototyping and evaluation. Research deliverable include development of smart products and technology transfer, strategic product and systems concepts, sustainable product development, ethnographic studies, trends forecasting, ergonomic verification and envisioning new products and systems.  Research guides companies in articulating the future or addressing immediate needs through a fresh independent perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Sustainable Electronics Initiative: Current Projects | url = http://www.sustainelectronics.illinois.edu/research/currentprojects.cfm  | accessdate = 5 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The DEE Lab is located within the Illinois Sustainable Technology Center and is a part of the Sustainable Electronics Initiative. William Bullock, a professor with the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign School of Art and Design is the director of the DEE lab.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Illinois Directory, William Bullock, University of Illinois | publisher = University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign | url = http://illinois.edu/ds/search?search=william+bullock&amp;search_type=all&amp;skinId=&amp;cx=&amp;cof=&amp;q=william+bullock&amp;t=1&amp;sa=Go | accessdate = 5 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Competitions==
===Sustainable E-Waste Design Competition===
The Sustainable E-Waste Design Competition is a way for University of Illinois students to get involved in the Sustainable Electronics Initiative. During the spring 2009 semester, students were challenged to create appealing, useful products from e-waste through a School of Art and Design course. Students conducted an e-waste collection on campus and twenty teams each developed useful items from the collected e-waste.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Students Find Gold in First E-waste Design Competition at Illinois | newspaper = Newswise | date = 21 April 2009 | url = http://www.newswise.com/articles/view/551466/ | accessdate = 30 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The projects were judged by a group of industry representatives. Six of the teams were awarded a total of fifteen thousand dollars in scholarships provided by industry sponsors Wal-Mart, Dell, Motorola and Microsoft.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Adderly | first = Shawn | title = Students devise new, creative ways to reuse electronics | newspaper = DailyIllini | date = 16 April 2009 | url = http://www.dailyillini.com/news/campus/2009/04/16/students-devise-new-creative-ways-to-reuse-electronics | accessdate = 30 October 2009 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101112003642/http://www.dailyillini.com/news/campus/2009/04/16/students-devise-new-creative-ways-to-reuse-electronics | archivedate = 12 November 2010 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The E-Waste Design competition will occur during the Spring 2010, with the final judging occurring on April 20, 2010. This year, the competition will be international in scope, with participants submitting projects in the form of videos on [[YouTube]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Forrest| first = Sharita | title = E-waste design competition at Illinois expanding to international event | newspaper = News Bureau | date = 6 January 2010 | url = http://www.news.illinois.edu/news/10/0106ewaste.html | accessdate = 11 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Resources==
SEI offers an extensive section of resources designated for research regarding sustainable electronics through RefWorks.

In addition, the Greater Lakes Regional Pollution Prevention Roundtable offers sector resources specifically geared toward electronic waste.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4750">'''Sélection de Grains Nobles''' (SGN) is [[French language|French]] for "selection of noble berries" and refers to [[wine]]s made from [[grape]]s affected by [[noble rot]]. SGN wines are sweet [[dessert wines]] with rich, concentrated flavours. [[Alsace wine]]s were the first to be described as ''Sélection de Grains Nobles'', with the legal definition introduced in 1984,&lt;ref name="Hugel VT SGN"&gt;[http://www.hugel.com/pdf/VENDANGE_TARDIVE_and_SGN.pdf Hugel.com: Vendange Tardive and SGN], read on February 11, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; but the term is also seen in some other wine regions France, such as [[Loire Valley wine|Loire]].

==Use in Alsace==
For Alsace wines, SGN is the highest official category for [[late harvest wine]]s, while the step below is called ''[[Vendange tardive]]''.&lt;ref name="Hugel VT SGN"/&gt;

In 2001, the minimum [[must weight]] requirements for SGN in Alsace were increased to 18.2% for [[Gewürztraminer]] and [[Pinot gris]], and 16.4% for [[Riesling]] and [[Muscat (grape and wine)|Muscat]], expressed as potential alcohol. Only these four "noble varieties" may carry the SGN designation, or the ''Vendange tardive'' designation.

The required level [[ripeness of the grapes]] are as follows, expressed as sugar content of the must and [[potential alcohol]]:&lt;ref name="Hugel VT SGN"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inao.gouv.fr/public/produits/showTexte.php?comiteNat=1&amp;id_txt=1020 Décret du 1er mars 1984 modifié relatif aux appellations d'origine contrôlées « Alsace » et « Alsace grand cru »: Décret relatif aux conditions propres à la déclaration et à la présentation des mentions « vendanges tardives » et « sélection de grains nobles »]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.weimax.com/prod03.htm Weimax Wines &amp; Spirits: Dessert wines], accessed February 11, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.food.gov.uk/multimedia/pdfs/euwineregs.pdf Food.gov.uk: Guide to EU wine regulations, p. 11], accessed on March 18, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

|- bgcolor="lightgrey"
! Varieties || SGN since 2001 || SGN before 2001

|}

These requirements make SGN roughly equivalent to a [[German wine|German]] [[Beerenauslese]], but the Alsace style tend to favour slightly higher alcohol levels, which means that the [[residual sugar]] often is a little lower than in German wines, especially for Riesling and Muscat.

On rare occasions, the designation '''Quintessence de Grains Nobles''' (QGN) is seen for wines that significantly exceed the minimum requirements for SGN wines.  Unlike the German designation [[Trockenbeerenauslese]] (TBA), QGN is no official designation, but it could be thought of as the Alsatian equivalent of a high-grade TBA.  The term was invented in 1983 by [[Domaine Weinbach]] to describe an exceptional cuvee of that year's vintage, and while still used primarily by Weinbach, it has been adopted by a few other producers, including [[Marcel Deiss]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chiptin.com/wine/gewurztraminer/vintners/france/alsace/weinbach.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use in Loire==
[[Image:Jo Pithon Clos des Bois SGN 1994 label.jpg|thumb|A wine from the Loire valley labelled ''Sélection de Grains Nobles''.]]

In the case of Loire valley wines, the designation SGN usually denotes wines that are extra sweet, and produced by one of the region's so-called "sugar hunters".&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Rovani in [[Wine Advocate]], issue #113: October 31, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Often, the same producer will have another wine from the same appellation with less [[residual sugar]] without the SGN designation. The SGN designation can be used in the appellations [[Coteaux du Layon]] and [[Coteaux de l'Aubance]] and in both cases this requires the grape [[must]] used for the wine to have a minimum sugar content of 294&amp;nbsp;grams per liter rather than the basic level of 221 or 230&amp;nbsp;grams per liter respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inao.gouv.fr/public/produits/showTexte.php?comiteNat=1&amp;id_txt=926 INAO: Appellation rules for AOC Coteaux du Layon, with latest changes from February 21, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inao.gouv.fr/public/produits/showTexte.php?comiteNat=1&amp;id_txt=596 INAO: Appellation rules for AOC Coteaux de l'Aubance , with latest changes from October 7, 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{About|a tabletop – a table computer|a cross of a tablet and a laptop device|tabtop}}
[[File:LenovoIdeaCentreHorizon.jpeg|thumb|[[Lenovo]] [[Lenovo IdeaCentre Horizon|IdeaCentre Horizon]] table PC]]

A '''table computer''', or a '''table PC''', or a '''tabletop''' is a device class of a full-featured large-display portable [[Desktop computer#All-in-one|all-in-one]] [[computer]] with an internal battery. It can either be used on a table's top, hence the name, or carried around the house.&lt;ref name=CNet&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ackerman|first1=Dan|title=Big screens, big batteries: A roundup of tabletop PCs|url=http://www.cnet.com/news/big-screens-big-batteries-a-roundup-of-tabletop-pcs/|website=CNet.com|accessdate=9 October 2014|date=16 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Table computers feature an 18-inch or larger [[multi-touch]] [[touchscreen]] display, a battery capable of at least 2 hours of autonomous work and a full-featured desktop [[operating system]], such as [[Windows 10]]. They are typically shipped with pre-installed multi-user touch-enabled [[casual game]]s and [[Application software|apps]], and typically marketed as family entertainment devices. Manufacturers of some table computers provide a specialized [[graphical user interface]] to simplify a simultaneous interaction of multiple users, one example is ''Aura''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Aura Horizon Table PC (Interface Design)|url=http://www.red-dot-21.com/projects/aura-horizon-table-pc|website=Red-Dot-21.com|accessdate=9 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; interface, which is installed in [[Lenovo IdeaCentre Horizon]] tabletop.

A number of manufacturers released their own versions of tabletops, some prominent examples are HP Envy Rove 20,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnet.com/products/hp-envy-rove-20/|title=HP's 20-inch mega-tablet, the Envy Rove 20|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dell XPS 18&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dell.com/us/p/xps-18-1810/pd|title=XPS 18 Portable All-in-One Desktop - Dell United States|website=www.dell.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Sony VAIO Tap 20.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sony.com.au/productcategory/it-pc-series-svj|title=Support for Sony products - Sony AU|website=www.sony.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11166">The '''W. Alton Jones Cell Science Center''' (1971&amp;ndash;1995) was a non-profit research and education center on 10 Old Barn Road in [[Lake Placid, New York]].  The Center was established by a gift of {{convert|34|acre|m2}} of land and $3 million to the Tissue Culture Association from the [[W. Alton Jones Foundation]] through efforts of Nettie Marie Jones, widow of [[W. Alton Jones]] who was former chairman of the Board of Cities Service Company (see [[Citgo]]).  The original tax-free gift was accompanied by the institutional charter that use of the facility would be restricted forever to non-profit activities related to research and education on the biology of cells.
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:cellcenter1.jpg|350x229px|right]] --&gt;

==Cell Culture Research and Education Center 1971-1982==

The Cell Center was largely the vision of cell culture pioneer Dr. [[George Otto Gey]], director of the Finney-Howell Cancer Research Laboratory at the [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]], a founder and first President of The Tissue Culture Association (now the Society for In Vitro Biology).  Dr. Gey was introduced to Nettie Marie Jones, widow of [[W. Alton Jones]], through her daughter Patricia Jones, an employee or acquaintance at Johns Hopkins.  A highlight of the W. Alton Jones Cell Science Center building was the George and Margaret Gey Library.  The objective was to provide a center in the peaceful setting of the [[Adirondack Mountains]] where experts in the fields of genetics, immunology, virology, insect physiology and other invertebrates unified by common interest in the art and science of culturing cells outside the body could come together, pool their ideas and techniques, and convey them to others.

[[Image:cellcenter2.jpg|350x229px|right]]

In the period 1971 to 1980, the Cell Center consisted of research groups oriented around the theme of cell and tissue culture, provided specialty 1 to 3 week courses and hosted international meetings on the theme.  The first Director was Dr. Donald Merchant followed by Dr. Paul Chapple.

For the period 1971 through 1979 the [[W. Alton Jones Foundation]] contributed annually to the operating expenses and mission of the Cell Center through the influence of Nettie Marie Jones.  In 1979, Mrs. Jones was in poor health and nearing age 100.  At that time [[Charlottesville, Virginia]]-based daughter of Mrs. Jones, Patricia Jones Edgerton, took charge of the [[W. Alton Jones Foundation]] and together with longtime family associate [[William C. Battle]], ambassador to Australia under the Kennedy administration, established an independent corporation called the W. Alton Jones Cell Science Center, Inc. Edgerton and Battle and associates maintained concurrent control of the [[W. Alton Jones Foundation]] and the W. Alton Jones Cell Science Center, Inc.  In the early 1980s, the Tissue Culture Association, subsequently the Society for In Vitro Biology (SIVB), under President [[Keith R. Porter]], was pressured to relinquish deed to the Cell Center property and facility originally donated to them tax-free by the [[W. Alton Jones Foundation]] to the newly established W. Alton Jones Cell Science Center, Inc.  Without sufficient resources to support legal action to retain ownership of the property and enforce the original non-profit charter and mission, the deed was relinquished.  Subsequently the SIVB agreed retroactively to relingquish enforcement of the "non-profit use only" stipulation of the original charter along with the earlier transfer of the deed to the property for a donation of $50,000 from the Adirondack Biomedical Institute, Inc. (Director, Dr. James Stevens).

==The Sato Program 1983-1993==

In 1982 the [[W. Alton Jones Foundation]] donated $17.5 million to the W. Alton Jones Cell Science Center, Inc. of to support the recruitment and program of Dr. [[Gordon H. Sato]] as Director.  Dr. Sato's mission was to build a financially independent world-class basic research and teaching institute in the [[Adirondack Mountains]] generally oriented around the applications of cell culture technologies to broad problems in human health and disease through translational biotechnology to industry and the clinic.  In his own words he envisioned "a self-endowed Rockefeller University-type institution" in the middle of the [[Adirondack Park]], New York's statewide counterpart of [[New York City]]'s [[Central Park]].

In the period 1983-1993 the research staff of the Center increased by 10 fold.  Sato purchased several local properties for staff and student housing.  He established an international Ph.D. program in Chemical Biology with nearby [[Clarkson University]], [[Potsdam (village), New York]] and a joint program with the [[University of Vermont]], [[Burlington, Vermont]].  He established the annual W. Alton Jones International Symposium in Cellular Endocrinology centered on honoring movers and shakers in the field.  During his administration the Center acquired program project grants from the [[National Cancer Institute]] and [[National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases]].  Through Sato's efforts, the Cell Center acquired worldwide recognition through contributions of its researchers to basic research and biotechnological applications.  Its former researchers and students hold leadership positions in academics and biotechnology worldwide.  During this period the Lake Placid center became the headquarters of The Manzanar Project,&lt;ref&gt;[http://themanzanarproject.com The Manzanar Project-Low Tech Solutions to Hunger and Povery]&lt;/ref&gt; a global action project aimed at attacking the planet's most critical problems as poverty, hunger, environmental pollution, and global warming through low tech biotechnological methods in salt water deserts that can be transferred to the indigenous inhabitants

To ensure financial independence, a permanent endowment for the research center, "to give scientists security and remove any temptation they may have felt to modify their research because of monetary support,"&lt;ref&gt;1995 letter to Dr. James Stevens, Director of the Adirondack Biomedical Institute&lt;/ref&gt; Sato founded Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. (UBI) to be solely owned by the W. Alton Jones Cell Science Center, Inc.  Startup for UBI was financed by loans from the W. Alton Jones Cell Science Center, Inc. from the $17.5 million gift from the [[W. Alton Jones Foundation]] to ensure that ownership and proceeds of UBI flowed solely into support and long term endowment of the Cell Center without interference by private interests.  As profitability of UBI increased, private interests and the controlling overlapping members of the Boards of both the for-profit UBI, the non-profit W. Alton Jones Cell Science Center, Inc. and the non-profit [[W. Alton Jones Foundation]] and their associates diverted the UBI mission away from the goal of providing permanent support and endowment of the Cell Center in its [[Lake Placid, New York]] location in the [[Adirondack Mountains]].  This precipitated the resignation of Dr. Sato as Director.

==Diversion of Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. and Dissolution==

In 1996 Edgerton and Battle and associates recruited venture capitalist [[Sheridan Snyder]] to become involved with UBI, later called Upstate USA, Inc., Upstate Group or simply Upstate.  In 1996 the not-for-profit W. Alton Jones Cell Science Center, Inc. was dissolved and the assets, which included Upstate Biotechnology, Inc., were transferred to a newly incorporated non-for-profit entity, the Adirondack Biomedical Research Institute (ABRI), Inc.  In 1998 the ABRI ceased operations as a non-profit basic research entity and announced the facility would become an "incubator facility" for biotechnology companies in the [[Adirondack Mountains]] region with Upstate, Inc. and Argonex (a Snyder startup) as lead companies.&lt;ref&gt;1998 News Release, ABRI&lt;/ref&gt;  

In 2000, the ABRI corporation was dissolved and the property and facilities purchased by for-profit Upstate, Inc. of which Argonex was a major shareholder for $1 million.&lt;ref name="Town"&gt;Lake Placid and Town of North Elba Realtor Records&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2004 Upstate was sold to Serologicals, Inc. for $204 million.&lt;ref&gt;along with the physical facilities  [http://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/stories/2004/10/11/daily39.html ''Serologicals buys Upstate'' Atlanta Business Chronicle Oct. 15 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;  Upstate and Serologicals, Inc. are now a division of [[Millipore Corporation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.upstate.com/home.q./Upstate+Cell+Signaling+Products Corporate website]&lt;/ref&gt;  The site was offered for sale on the Lake Placid real estate market by [[Millipore Corporation]] for $5.9 million and was reportedly sold in 2007 to a local partnership of Lake Placid real estate and business investors for about $3 million.&lt;ref name="Town"/&gt;

In 2000 the Ivy Foundation chaired by [[William C. Battle]] was established with a reported endowment of $7 million from funds from the closure of the Adirondack Biomedical Research Foundation, Inc. (formerly the W. Alton Jones Cell Science Center, Inc.) &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.virginia.edu/topnews/releases2000/ivyfoundation-oct-6-2000.html University of Virginia News, Oct. 6 2000]&lt;/ref&gt; that included Upstate Biotechnology, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.virginia.edu/topnews/releases2003/ivy-may-19-2003.html University of Virginia News May 19 2003]&lt;/ref&gt;   Subsequent to the sale of the Upstate Group in 2005 the Ivy Foundation listing Board of Directors as [[William C. Battle]], Arthur Garson, Jr., William Black, [[Sheridan Snyder]], Patricia J. Edgerton, Aaron Shatkin and Dr. Robert W. Battle made a gift of $45 million to the University of Virginia, Charlottesville, Virginia, the largest single gift in the history of the University.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.virginia.edu/topnews/releases2005/20051212battles.html University of Virginia News Dec. 12 2005] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060212001924/http://www.virginia.edu/topnews/releases2005/20051212battles.html |date=2006-02-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Just after the establishment of the Ivy Foundation, but prior to the sale of the privately held Upstate Biotechnology, Inc. to Serologicals, Inc., the Charlottesville, Virginia-based 56-year-old [[W. Alton Jones Foundation]] suddenly dissolved in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.readthehook.com/stories/2002/03/28/newsLostFoundationWhatever.html ''Lost foundation: Whatever happened to W. Alton Jones?'' The Hook Mar 28 2002]&lt;/ref&gt;  The $400 million endowment was split into three separate Foundations, the Blue Moon Fund &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bluemoonfund.org Blue Moon Fund]&lt;/ref&gt; run by Patricia Jones Edgerton (daughter of W. Alton Jones) and her daughter Diane Edgerton Miller, the Oak Hill Foundation run by son William Edgerton, and the Edgerton Foundation run by son Brad Edgerton.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.readthehook.com/stories/2002/10/17/newsshygreenOffshootsWAlto.html ''Green offshoots: W.

[[File:Stump-jump plough.jpg|right|thumb|Plan of the original single-furrow stump-jump plough]]This is a '''timeline of Australian inventions''' consisting of products and technology invented in [[Australia]] from pre-European-settlement in 1788 to the present. The inventions are listed in chronological order based on the date of their introduction.

Australian inventions include the very old, such as [[Woomera (spear-thrower)|woomera]], and the very new, such as the scramjet, first fired at the [[Woomera, South Australia|Woomera]] rocket range. The Australian government has suggested that Australian inventiveness springs from the nation's geography and isolation.&lt;ref name=AI/&gt; Perhaps due to its status as an island continent connected to the rest of the world Australians have been leaders in inventions relating to both maritime and aeronautical matters, including [[powered flight]], the [[black box]] [[flight recorder]], the inflatable escape slide, the [[surf ski]] and the [[wave-piercing]] [[catamaran]] [[winged keel]]. Since the earliest days of European settlement, Australia's main industries have been agriculture and mining. As a result of this, Australians have made many inventions in these areas, including the grain stripper, the [[stump jump plough]], [[The Wolseley Sheep Shearing Machine Company|mechanical sheep shears]], the [[Dethridge wheel|Dethridge water wheel]], the [[froth flotation]] ore separation process, the instream ore analysis process and the [[buffalo fly]] trap.

Australian inventions also include a number of weapons or weapons systems, including the woomera, the tank, and the underwater torpedo. In recent years, Australians have been at the forefront of medical technology with inventions including [[ultrasound]], the bionic ear, the first [[Corrective lens|plastic spectacle lenses]], the electronic [[pacemaker]], the multi-focal contact lens, spray-on artificial skin and anti-flu medication. Australians also developed a number of useful household items, including [[Vegemite]], and the process for producing permanently creased fabric.

Many of Australia's inventions were realised by individuals who get little credit or who are often overlooked for more famous Americans or Europeans.&lt;ref name=AI&gt;{{cite web|title=Australian inventions |publisher=Australian Government: Culture and Recreation Portal |url=http://www.cultureandrecreation.gov.au/articles/inventions/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100416135914/http://www.cultureandrecreation.gov.au/articles/inventions/ |archivedate=16 April 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Australian Aborigine [[David Unaipon]] is known as "Australia's Leonardo" for his contributions to science and the Aboriginal people.&lt;ref name=AI/&gt; His inventions include a tool for sheep-shearing, a centrifugal motor, a multi-radial wheel and mechanical propulsion device. Unaipon appears on Australia's $50 note.

The [[Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation]] (CSIRO) is an Australian-government-funded institution. A number of CSIRO funded scientists and engineers are featured in this list. CSIRO scientists lead Australian research across a number of different fields, and work with industry and government to solve problems such as using insects to tackle weeds, growing more sustainable crops and improving transportation.&lt;ref name="AI"/&gt;

{{hatnote|The original inventors of these uniquely Australian inventions are unknown.}}

'''[[Didgeridoo]]''' – The didgeridoo is a wind [[musical instrument|instrument]] of northern [[Australia]].&lt;ref name="Didgeridoo"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cheal|first=Joe|title=The Didjeridu: A Guide|publisher=GWiz Training Partnership|location=Moggerhanger|year=2008|page=8|chapter=Part One: Background|url=http://www.gwiztraining.com/Didj%20Book.pdf|format=PDF|accessdate=15 December 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928041812/http://www.gwiztraining.com/Didj%20Book.pdf|archivedate=28 September 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is sometimes described as a "[[drone (music)|drone]] pipe," but [[musicologist]]s classify it as an [[aerophone]]. Traditionally, a didgeridoo was made by selecting a section of a [[Eucalyptus tree|Eucalyptus branch]], then burying it near a termite mound so that the termites would hollow it out, to produce a long, hollow piece of wood suitable for fashioning the instrument.

'''[[Woomera (spear-thrower)|Woomera]]''' – The woomera is a type of [[Spear-thrower|spear thrower]], adding thrust to a spear as part of a throwing action.&lt;ref name=AI/&gt;

==Colonial era – 19th century==

1843 – '''Grain stripper''' – John Wrathall Bull invented and John Ridley manufactured in [[South Australia]] the world's first mechanised grain stripper. It utilised a comb to lift the ears of the crop to where revolving beaters deposited the grain into a bin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=May Brothers Patent 1886 grain stripper harvester|publisher=National Museum of Australia, Canberra|url=http://www.nma.gov.au/collections-search/display?irn=37652}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1856 – '''[[Refrigerator]]''' – Using the principle of vapour compression, [[James Harrison (engineer)|James Harrison]] produced the world's first practical ice making machine and refrigerator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=An Act to render valid a Patent heretofore granted to James Harrison for Manufacturing Ice|publisher=Flinders University, Adelaide|url=https://dspace.flinders.edu.au/dspace/bitstream/2328/2352/1/PAct21862.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1858 – '''[[Australian rules football]]''' – began its development when [[Tom Wills]] wrote a letter published in ''Bell's Life in Victoria &amp; Sporting Chronicle'' on 10 July 1858, calling for a "foot-ball club, a rifle club, or other athletic pursuits" to keep cricketers fit during winter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Letter from Tom Wills | work=MCG website | url=http://www.mcg.org.au/default.asp?pg=footballdisplay&amp;articleid=37|accessdate=14 July 2006 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060625081726/http://www.mcg.org.au/default.asp?pg=footballdisplay&amp;articleid=37 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 25 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; An experimental match was played by Wills and others at the Richmond Paddock, later known as [[Yarra Park, Melbourne|Yarra Park]] next to the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] on 31 July 1858.
The [[Melbourne Football Club]] rules of 1859 are the oldest surviving set of laws for Australian football. They were drawn up at the Parade Hotel, [[East Melbourne]], on 17 May, by Wills, W. J. Hammersley, J. B. Thompson and Thomas Smith.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Smith himself made this claim in response to an article about the history of Melbourne FC in ''The Australasian'' published 26 February 1876 (from ''Melbourne FC Since 1858 – An Illustrated History'' pg 36). Smith's personal account mentions Thompson arriving after the decision to form the club&lt;/ref&gt;
The Melbourne club's game was not immediately adopted by neighbouring clubs. Before each match the rules had to be agreed by the two teams involved. By 1866, several other clubs had agreed to play by an updated version of Melbourne's rules.

1859 — '''[[Photolithography]]''' — developed by [[John Walter Osborne]] at the Victorian government's Crown Lands Office. During a land boom the Office had trouble producing the many maps and documents required to keep land records updated. Instead of having to copy surveyor's originals, or having to store stone originals, master copies saved were glass slides of around {{convert|6|in|mm}} square.&lt;ref name=adb&gt;Jean Gittins, 'Osborne, John Walter (1828–1902)', Australian Dictionary of Biography, National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/osborne-john-walter-4343/text7051, published first in hardcopy 1974, accessed online 26 June 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

1874 – '''Underwater [[Brennan torpedo|torpedo]]''' – Invented by Louis Brennan, the torpedo had two propellers, rotated by wires which were attached to winding engines on the shore station. By varying the speed at which the two wires were extracted, the torpedo could be steered to the left or right by an operator on the shore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Australian Dictionary of Biography Online – Brennan, Louis (1852–1932)|publisher=Australian National University|url=http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A030208b.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1876 – '''[[Stump jump plough]]''' – Richard and Clarence Bowyer Smith developed a plough which could jump over stumps and stones, enabling newly cleared land to be cultivated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stump-Jump Plough|publisher=Australian Biotechnology|url=http://www.biotechnology-innovation.com.au/innovations/agriculture/jump_plough.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1877 – '''[[The Wolseley Sheep Shearing Machine Company|Mechanical clippers]]''' – Various mechanical shearing patents were registered in Australia before [[Frederick Wolseley|Frederick York Wolseley]] finally succeeded in developing a practical hand piece with a comb and reciprocating cutter driven by power transmitted from a stationary engine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Technology in Australia 1788-1988m Introduction and innovation in livestock husbandry|publisher=Australian Science and Technology Heritage Centre|url=http://www.austehc.unimelb.edu.au/tia/017.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1889 – '''[[Electric drill]]''' – [[Arthur James Arnot]] patented the world's first electric drill on 20 August 1889 while working for the Union Electric Company in Melbourne. He designed it primarily to drill rock and to dig coal.&lt;ref&gt;"Specifications for registration of patent by William Blanch Brain and Arthur James Arnot titled – Improvements in electrical rock drills coal diggers and earth cutters".

[[File:Coolgardie safe.jpg|120px|thumb|Coolgardie safe in the [[Western Australian Museum|WA Museum]]]]

1892 – '''[[Coolgardie safe]]''' – Arthur Patrick McCormick noticed that a wet bag placed over a bottle cooled its contents, and the cooling was more pronounced in a breeze. The Coolgardie safe was a box made of wire and [[hessian (cloth)|hessian]] sitting in water, which was placed on a verandah so that any breeze would evaporate the water in the hessian and via the principle of evaporation, cool the air inside the box. The Coolgardie safe was used into the middle of the 20th century as a means of preserving food.

==20th century Post-Federation – 1901–1945==

1902 – '''[[Notebook|Notepad]]''' – For 500 years, paper had been supplied in loose sheets. [[Launceston, Tasmania|Launceston]] stationer J.A. Birchall decided that it would be a good idea to cut the sheets in half, back them with cardboard and glue them together at the top.&lt;ref name="Beyond the Hills Hoist"&gt;{{cite news|title=Beyond the Hills Hoist|publisher=Sydney Morning Herald|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2005/01/26/1106415670489.html | date=27 January 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1903 – '''[[Froth flotation]]''' – The process of separating minerals from rock by flotation was developed by Charles Potter and [[Guillaume Delprat]] in [[New South Wales]]. Both worked independently at the same time on different parts of the process for the mining company [[BHP Billiton|Broken Hill Pty. Ltd.]] (BHP)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Australian Dictionary of Biography Online – Delprat, Guillaume Daniel (1856–1937)|publisher=Australian National University |url=http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A080295b.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Australian Dictionary of Biography Online – Potter, Charles Vincent (1859–1908)|publisher=Australian National University|url=http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A080295b.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fluid thrust bearing.PNG|thumb|140px|A fluid film thrust bearing]]
1907 – '''[[Thrust block|Michell thrust block bearing]]''' – Fluid-film thrust bearings were invented by Australian engineer [[Anthony Michell|George Michell]]. Michell bearings contain a number of sector-shaped pads, arranged in a circle around the shaft, and that are free to tilt. These create wedge-shaped regions of oil inside the bearing between the pads and a rotating disk, which support the applied thrust and eliminate metal-on-metal contact. The small size (one-tenth the size of old bearing designs), low friction and long life of Michell's invention made possible the development of larger propellers and engines in ships. They were used extensively in ships built during [[World War I]], and have become the standard bearing used on turbine shafts in ships and power plants worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Michell thrust bearing, 1907, Low-friction bearing for thrust shafts|publisher=Powerhouse Museum, Sydney|url=http://www.powerhousemuseum.com/australia_innovates/?behaviour=view_article&amp;Section_id=1080&amp;article_id=10086}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1910 – '''Humespun pipe-making process''' – The Humespun process was developed by [[Walter Reginald Hume|Walter Hume]] of Humes Ltd for making concrete pipes of high strength and low permeability. The process used centrifugal force to evenly distribute concrete onto wire reinforcing, revolutionising pipe manufacture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Innovations: Humespun concrete pipes|publisher=Government of South Australia|url=http://www.samemory.sa.gov.au/site/page.cfm?u=319}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Dethridge wheel 1936.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Dethridge wheel in 1936]]
1910 – '''[[Dethridge wheel]]''' – The wheel, used to measure the water flow in an irrigation channel, consisting of a drum on an axle, with eight v-shaped vanes fixed to its outside, was invented by John Dethridge, Commissioner of the Victorian State Rivers and Water Supply Commission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Measuring farm supplies – the Dethridge wheel|publisher=Australian Academy of Technological Sciences and Engineering|url=http://www.austehc.unimelb.edu.au/tia/157.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1912 – '''[[Surf ski]]''' – Harry McLaren and his brother Jack used an early version of the surf ski for use around the family's oyster beds on Lake Innes, near [[Port Macquarie, New South Wales]], and the brothers used them in the surf on Port Macquarie's beaches. The board was propelled in a sitting position with two small hand blades, which was probably not a highly efficient method to negotiate the surf. The deck is flat with a bung plug at the rear and a nose ring with a leash, possibly originally required for mooring. The rails are square and there is pronounced rocker. The boards' obvious buoyancy indicates hollow construction, with thin boards of cedar fixed longtitudinally down the board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=the development and design of the surf ski|publisher=surfresearch|url= http://www.surfresearch.com.au/0000h_SurfSki.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1912 – '''[[Tank]]''' – South Australian [[Lancelot de Mole|Lance de Mole]] submitted a proposal to the British War Office, for a 'chain-rail vehicle which could be easily steered and carry heavy loads over rough ground and trenches,' complete with extensive drawings. The British war office rejected the idea at the time, but De Mole made several more proposals to the British War Office in 1914 and 1916, and formally requested he be recognised as the inventor of the [[Mark I tank]]. The British Royal Commission on Awards to Inventors eventually made a payment of £987 to De Mole to cover his expenses and promoted him to an honorary corporal.&lt;ref&gt;Coulthard-Clark, Christopher D., Australian Dictionary of Biography, online edition, http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A080298b.htm, retrieved on 26 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

1912 – '''Self-Propelled [[rotary tiller|Rotary Hoe]]''' – At the age of 16 Cliff Howard of [[Gilgandra]] invented a machine with rotating hoe blades on an axle that simultaneously hoed the ground and pulled the machine forward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Howard's Rotary Hoe|publisher=The Institution of Engineers Australia – Sydney Division|url=http://www.engheritage-sydney.org.au/PDFs/Howard.pm.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1928 – '''Electronic [[Pacemaker]]''' – Developed by Edgar H Booth and Mark C Liddell, the heart pacemaker had a portable apparatus which 'plugged into a lighting point. One pole was applied to a skin pad soaked in strong salt solution' while the other pole 'consisted of a needle insulated except at its point, and was plunged into the appropriate cardiac chamber'. 'The pacemaker rate was not good from about 80 to 120 pulses per minute, and likewise the voltage variable from 1.5 to 120 volts.' The apparatus was used to revive a potentially stillborn infant at Crown Street Women's Hospital, Sydney whose heart continued 'to beat on its own accord', 'at the end of 10 minutes' of stimulation.&lt;ref&gt;Mond H, Sloman J, Edwards R (1982).

1934 – '''[[Coupé utility]]''' – The car body style, known colloquially as the ute in Australia and New Zealand, combines a two-door "coupé" cabin with an integral cargo bed behind the cabin—using a light-duty passenger vehicle-derived platform. It was designed by [[Lewis Bandt]] at the [[Ford Motor Company]] in [[Geelong]], Victoria. The first ute rolled off the Ford production lines in 1934. The idea came from a Geelong farmer's wife who wrote to Ford in 1933 advising the need for a new sort of vehicle to take her 'to church on Sundays and pigs to market on Mondays.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Utes|publisher=utes.com.au|url=http://www.utes.com.au/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Toothbrush x3 20050716 001.jpg|thumb|Three toothbrushes]]
The '''toothbrush''' is an [[oral hygiene]] instrument used to clean the [[teeth]], [[gingiva|gums]], and [[tongue]]. It consists of a head of tightly clustered [[bristle]]--atop of which [[toothpaste]] is supposed to go—mounted on a [[handle (grip)|handle]] which facilitates the cleaning of hard-to-reach areas of the mouth.

Toothbrushes are available with different bristle textures, sizes, and forms. Most [[dentist]]s recommend using a soft toothbrush since hard bristled toothbrushes can damage [[tooth enamel]] and irritate the gums.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parisdentistry.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/orallongevity_brochure.pdf "Oral Longevity," American Dental Association brochure (PDF), page 2] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101119223615/http://ada.org/sections/publicResources/pdfs/orallongevity_brochure.pdf |date=2010-11-19 }} Retrieved June 12, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Although first made as an [[oral hygiene]] instrument, the toothbrush has seen other use as a precise cleaning tool as well, most specifically in the military. This is because of the many small strands that allow it to clean in small places many conventional cleaning tools cannot reach.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ToothbrushFloorScrubbing|title=Toothbrush Floor Scrubbing - TV Tropes|website=TV Tropes|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Napoleon’s toothbrush, c 1795. (9660576547).jpg|thumb|right|The [[horsehair]] toothbrush was said to have been used by [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] (1769–1821)]]

In Europe, [[William Addis (entrepreneur)|William Addis]] of England is believed to have produced the first mass-produced toothbrush in 1780.&lt;ref name="The Library of Congress" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Dentistry&gt;{{cite web|url=http://inventors.about.com/od/dstartinventions/a/dentistry_2.htm|title=History of the Toothbrush and Toothpaste|author=Mary Bellis|publisher=About.com Money}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1770, he had been jailed for causing a riot. While in prison he decided that using a [[textile|rag]] with [[soot]] and [[salt]] on the teeth was ineffective and could be improved. After saving a small [[bone]] from a meal, he drilled small holes into the bone and tied into the bone tufts of bristles that he had obtained from one of the guards, passed the tufts of bristle through the holes in the bone and sealed the holes with glue. After his release, he became wealthy after starting a business manufacturing toothbrushes. He died in 1808, bequeathing the business to his eldest son. It remained within family ownership until 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.addis.co.uk/our-history |title=History of ADDIS |publisher=addis.co.uk |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141028094022/http://www.addis.co.uk/our-history |archivedate=2014-10-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the name Wisdom Toothbrushes, the company now manufactures 70 million toothbrushes per year in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/Cambridge/New-jobs-joy-in-toothbrushes.htm "New jobs joy in toothbrushes"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140525235443/http://www.cambridge-news.co.uk/Cambridge/New-jobs-joy-in-toothbrushes.htm |date=2014-05-25 }}, cambridge-news.co.uk&lt;/ref&gt; By 1840 toothbrushes were being mass-produced in England, France, Germany, and Japan.&lt;ref name=Addis&gt;[http://www.wisdom-toothbrushes.co.uk/learning-centre/history.html The company founded by Addis in 1780] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120630192218/http://www.wisdom-toothbrushes.co.uk/learning-centre/history.html |date=2012-06-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pig bristles were used for cheaper toothbrushes and badger hair for the more expensive ones.&lt;ref name=Addis /&gt;

The first [[patent]] for a toothbrush was granted to H.N. Wadsworth in 1857 (U.S.A. Patent No. 18,653) in the United States, but mass production in the United States did not start until 1885. The improved design had a bone handle with holes bored into it for the Siberian [[boar]] hair bristles. Unfortunately, animal bristle was not an ideal material as it retained [[bacteria]], did not [[desiccate]] efficiently and the bristles were often extricated from their intended fixed insertions. In addition to bone, handles were made of wood or ivory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ada.org/1321.aspx |title=Toothbrushes&amp;nbsp;– American Dental Association |publisher=ADA.org |date=2010-02-04 |accessdate=2013-05-03 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121112095938/http://www.ada.org/1321.aspx |archivedate=2012-11-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, brushing teeth did not become routine until after [[World War II]], when American soldiers had to clean their teeth daily.&lt;ref name=Dentistry /&gt;
[[File:Toothbrush teaching 1.jpg|thumb|right|A child being shown how to use a toothbrush.]]

During the 1900s, celluloid gradually replaced bone handles.&lt;ref name=kumar-412413 /&gt; Natural animal bristles were also replaced by [[synthetic fiber]]s, usually [[nylon]], by [[DuPont]] in 1938. The first nylon bristle toothbrush made with nylon yarn went on sale on February 24, 1938. The first [[electric toothbrush]], the Broxodent, was invented in Switzerland in 1954.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/scitech/mysteries/tooth.html |title=Who invented the toothbrush and when was it?

[[Johnson &amp; Johnson]], a leading medical supplies firm, introduced the "[[Reach (brand)|Reach]]" toothbrush in 1977.&lt;ref name="tribune1991"&gt;{{cite news |last=Lazarus |first=George |date=1991-08-13 |title=P&amp;G Puts Its Crest On A Toothbrush |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1991-08-13/business/9103280368_1_toothbrush-market-procter-gamble-crest |dead-url=no |newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]] |location=[[Chicago]] |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6ekMoEePo?url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1991-08-13/business/9103280368_1_toothbrush-market-procter-gamble-crest |archive-date=2016-01-23 |access-date=2016-01-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It differed from previous toothbrushes in three ways: it had an angled head, similar to dental instruments, to reach back teeth; the bristles were concentrated more closely than usual to clean each tooth of potentially [[Dental caries|cariogenic]] (cavity-causing) materials; and the outer bristles were longer and softer than the inner bristles. Other manufacturers soon followed with other designs aimed at improving effectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;[https://fortworthtexasdentist.com/the-complete-history-of-the-toothbrush/ The Complete History of the Toothbrush]&lt;/ref&gt;
In spite of the changes with the number of tufts and the spacing, the handle form and design, the bristles were still straight and difficult to maneuver. In 1978 Dr. George C. Collis developed the Collis Curve toothbrush which was the first toothbrush to have curved bristles. The curved bristles follow the curvature of the teeth and safely reach in between the teeth and into the [[gingival sulcus|sulcular]] areas. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilkins|first1=E.

In January 2003, the toothbrush was selected as the number one invention [[United States|Americans]] could not live without according to the [[Jerome H. Lemelson|Lemelson]]-[[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] Invention Index.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.mit.edu/invent/n-pressreleases/n-press-03index.html |title=2003 Invention Index |accessdate=2009-05-20 |date=2003-01-21 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090628194042/http://web.mit.edu/invent/n-pressreleases/n-press-03index.html |archivedate=2009-06-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of toothbrush==

===Electric toothbrush===
{{main article|Electric toothbrush}}
[[File:So Many Choices (11693539025).jpg|thumb|Various electric toothbrush heads]]

It has been discovered that compared to a manual brush, the multi-directional power brush might reduce the incidence of gingivitis and plaque, when compared to regular side-to-side brushing. These brushes tend to be more costly. An [[electric toothbrush]] performs rotations of its bristles and cleans hard to reach places. Most studies report performances equivalent to those of manual brushings, possibly with a decrease in plaque and gingivitis&lt;ref name="pmid21154357"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Deacon|first=SA|author2=Glenny, AM |author3=Deery, C |author4=Robinson, PG |author5=Heanue, M |author6=Walmsley, AD |author7= Shaw, WC |title=Different powered toothbrushes for plaque control and gingival health.|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=Dec 8, 2010|issue=12|pages=CD004971|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD004971.pub2|pmid=21154357 |volume=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the electric version can be more comfortable. An additional timer and pressure sensors can encourage a more efficient cleaning process.&lt;ref name="pmid21985880"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kallar|first=S|author2=Srivastava, N |author3=Pandit, IK |author4= Gugnani, N |title=Plaque removal efficacy of powered and manual toothbrushes under supervised and unsupervised conditions: A comparative clinical study|journal=Journal of Indian Society of Pedodontics and Preventive Dentistry|date=1 January 2011|volume=29|issue=3|pages=235–8|doi=10.4103/0970-4388.85832|pmid=21985880}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Electric toothbrushes can be classified, according to the speed of their movements as: standard power toothbrushes, sonic toothbrushes, or [[ultrasonic toothbrush]]es.  Any electric toothbrush is technically a power toothbrush.  If the motion of the toothbrush is sufficiently rapid to produce a hum in the [[audible frequency]] range (20&amp;nbsp;Hz to 20,000&amp;nbsp;Hz), it can be classified as a sonic toothbrush.  Any electric toothbrush with movement faster than this limit can be classified as an ultrasonic toothbrush.  Certain ultrasonic toothbrushes, such as the Megasonex and the Ultreo, have both sonic and ultrasonic movements.

===Interdental brush===
[[File:TePe Interdental Brushes original.jpg|thumb|Interdental Brushes]]
An interdental or interproximal ("proxy") brush is a small brush, typically disposable, either supplied with a reusable angled plastic handle or an integral handle, used for cleaning between [[teeth]] and between the wires of [[dental brace]]s and the teeth.

The use of interdental brushes in conjunction with tooth brushing, has been shown to reduce both the amount of plaque and the incidence of gingivitis when compared to toothbrushing alone.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Poklepovic T, Worthington HV, Johnson TM, Sambunjak D, Imai P, Clarkson JE, Tugwell P|first=|date=2013|title=Interdental brushing for the prevention and control of periodontal diseases and dental caries in adults|url=|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there is some evidence that after tooth brushing with a conventional tooth brush, interdental brushes remove more plaque than [[dental floss]],&lt;ref name="pmid22726785"&gt;{{cite journal|title=As an Adjunct to Tooth Brushing, Interdental Brushes (IDBs) are More Effective in Removing Plaque as Compared with Brushing Alone or the Combination Use of Tooth Brushing and Dental Floss|year=2012|last1=Gluch|first1=Joan I.|journal=Journal of Evidence Based Dental Practice|volume=12|issue=2|pages=81–83|doi=10.1016/j.jebdp.2012.03.016|pmid=22726785 |issn=1532-3382}}&lt;/ref&gt; a systematic review reported insufficient evidence to determine such an association.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The size of interdental brushes is standardized in [[ISO]] 16409.&lt;ref name="ISO 16409:2010"&gt;ISO 16409:2006 + Amd.1:2010, ''Dentistry&amp;nbsp;– Oral hygiene products&amp;nbsp;– Manual interdental brushes''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ISO 16409:2014"&gt;ISO/[[Draft International Standard|DIS]] 16409:2014, ''Dentistry&amp;nbsp;– Oral hygiene products&amp;nbsp;– Manual interdental brushes'' (draft standard)&lt;/ref&gt; The brush size,&lt;ref&gt;Different versions of the standard specify different brush sizes.&lt;/ref&gt; which is a number between 0 (small space between teeth) and 8 (large space), indicates the ''passage hole diameter''. This corresponds to the space between two teeth that is just sufficient for the brush to go through without bending the wire. The color of the brushes differs between producers. The same is the case with respect to the wire diameter.&lt;ref&gt;Neither the brush color nor the wire diameter are specified in ISO 16409:2010 or ISO/DIS 16409:2014. Just some general properties of the wire (e.g., should not bend) or specifications of the packaging (e.g., the brush size must be noted) can be found there.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sulcabrush===

A Sulcabrush is a type of toothbrush used specifically for cleaning along the gumline adjacent to the [[tooth|teeth]]. The bristles are usually shaped in a pointed arrow pattern to allow closer adaptation to the gums. A Sulcabrush is ideal for cleaning specific difficult-to-reach areas, such as between crowns, bridgework and crowded teeth. End-tufted brushes may also be used around fixed orthodontic appliances, such as [[dental braces|braces]].

===End-tuft brush===

The small round brush head comprises seven tufts of tightly packed soft nylon bristles, trimmed so the bristles in the center can reach deeper into small spaces. The brush handle is ergonomically designed for a firm grip, giving the control and precision necessary to clean where most other cleaning aids cannot reach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gumbrand.com/end-tuft-toothbrush-308rqb.html |title=GUM® End-Tuft Toothbrush&amp;nbsp;–  Official Site for GUM® Toothbrushes |work=GUM® Brand |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140419163829/http://www.gumbrand.com/end-tuft-toothbrush-308rqb.html |archivedate=2014-04-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; These areas include the posterior of the wisdom teeth (third molars), orthodontic structures (braces), crowded teeth, and tooth surfaces that are next to missing teeth. It can also be used to clean areas around implants, bridges, dentures and other appliances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/flossingandinterdentalaids/end-tuft-brush |title=End Tuft Brush&amp;nbsp;– Flossing and interdental aids |work=google.com |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140327024601/https://sites.google.com/site/flossingandinterdentalaids/end-tuft-brush |archivedate=2014-03-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chewable toothbrush===
[[Image:chewabletoothbrush.jpg|thumb|Chewable toothbrushes]]
A chewable toothbrush is a miniature plastic moulded toothbrush which can be placed inside the mouth. While not commonly used, they are useful to travelers and are sometimes available from [[bathroom]] [[vending machine]]s. They are available in different flavors such as mint or bubblegum and should be disposed of after use. Other types of disposable toothbrushes include those that contain a small breakable plastic ball of [[toothpaste]] on the bristles, which can be used without water.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oaji.net/articles/2014/957-1405051468.pdf Era of “Smart Toothbrushes”]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ecological toothbrushes===
Commonly, toothbrushes are made of plastic. Such brushes constitute a source of pollution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenecoservices.com/green-and-healthy-mouths-toothbrushes/ |title=Green and Healthy Mouths- Toothbrushes |author=Cathy |work=greenecoservices.com |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090905180801/http://www.greenecoservices.com/green-and-healthy-mouths-toothbrushes/ |archivedate=2009-09-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://environment.about.com/od/earthtalkcolumns/a/toothbrush.htm |title=Can You Recycle Your Toothbrush? |author=Larry West |work=About.com News &amp; Issues |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090204041650/http://environment.about.com/od/earthtalkcolumns/a/toothbrush.htm |archivedate=2009-02-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to reduce the environmental impact, some manufacturers have switched to using [[biodegradable]] materials and/or use replaceable heads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2012/09/26/building-better-toothbrush/ATlyLiQdE4LMIenqoliQQL/story.html|title=Building a better toothbrush&amp;nbsp;– Business&amp;nbsp;– The Boston Globe|work=BostonGlobe.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to avoid plastic altogether, alternative toothbrushes on offer consist of wooden handles (often bamboo) and bristles of [[bamboo viscose]] or pig bristles.

==Adversity of toothbrushes==
Teeth can be damaged by several factors including poor oral hygiene, but also by wrong oral hygiene. Especially for sensitive teeth, damage to dentin and gums can be prevented by several measures&lt;ref name="PreventiveMeasures"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Magalhães|first=AC|author2=Wiegand, A |author3=Rios, D |author4=Honório, HM |author5= Buzalaf, MA |title=Insights into preventive measures for dental erosion.|journal=Journal of applied oral science : revista FOB|date=Mar–Apr 2009|volume=17|issue=2|pages=75–86|doi=10.1590/S1678-77572009000200002|issn=1678-7757|pmid=19274390 |pmc=4327581}}{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; including a correct brushing technique.

It is beneficial, when using a straight bristled brush, not to scrub horizontally over the necks of teeth, not to press the brush too hard against the teeth, to choose a toothpaste that is not too abrasive,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lussic | first1 = A. | last2 = Jaeggi | first2 = T. | year = 2008 | title = Erosion—diagnosis and risk factors | url = | journal = Clin Oral Investig | volume = 12 | issue = Suppl 1| pages = 5–13 | doi = 10.1007/s00784-007-0179-z |PMC=2238777 | pmid=18228059}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to wait at least 30 minutes after consumption of acidic food or drinks before brushing.&lt;ref name="PreventiveMeasures" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cheng | first1 = R | last2 = Yang | first2 = H | last3 = Shao | first3 = M | last4 = Hu | first4 = T | last5 = Zhou | first5 = X | last6 = Zhejiang | first6 = J | year = 2009 | title = Dental erosion and severe tooth decay related to soft drinks: a case report and literature review | journal = Univ Sci B. | volume = 10 | issue = 5| pages = 395–399 | doi = 10.1631/jzus.B0820245 | pmid=19434767 | pmc = 2676420 }} {{open access}} "It is concluded that keeping tooth unbrushed for at least 30 min after an erosive attack is necessary for protecting dentin"&lt;/ref&gt;

"The curved bristles rotate on their axes and slip into the sulcus as far as the junctional epithelium without lacerating it" &lt;ref&gt;Journal of Dentistry for Children September–October 1984 p 371-73.&lt;/ref&gt;
Harder tooth brushes reduce plaque more efficiently but are more stressful to teeth and gum; using a medium to soft tooth brush for a longer cleaning time was rated to be the best compromise between cleaning result and gum and tooth health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zimmer | first1 = S | last2 = Öztürk | first2 = M | last3 = Barthel | first3 = CR | last4 = Bizhang | first4 = M | last5 = Jordan | first5 = RA | date = Feb 2011 | title = Cleaning efficacy and soft tissue trauma after use of manual toothbrushes with different bristle stiffness | url = | journal = J Periodontol | volume = 82 | issue = 2| pages = 267–71 | doi = 10.1902/jop.2010.100328 }} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study by [[University College London]] found that advice on brushing technique and frequency given by 10 national dental associations, toothpaste and toothbrush companies, and in dental textbooks was inconsistent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://medicalxpress.com/news/2014-08-teeth-dentists-dental-associations-dont.html |title=What's the best way to brush teeth?

==Hygiene and care==
* It is not recommended to share toothbrushes with others, since besides general hygienic concerns, there is a risk of transmitting diseases that are typically transmittable by blood, such as [[Hepatitis C]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lock | first1 = G. | last2 = Dirscherl | first2 = M. | last3 = Obermeier | first3 = F. | last4 = Gelbmann | first4 = C.

* After use it is advisable to rinse the toothbrush with water, shake it off and let the toothbrush dry.
* Bent and worn out bristles of a toothbrush lead to decreased cleaning efficiency. It is therefore recommended to change it for a new one when it appears to be worn out (roughly after 6–16 weeks).{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}
