      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4016">In [[computer science]], in particular in the field of [[formal language]] theory,
the term '''abstract family of languages''' refers to an abstract mathematical notion generalizing characteristics common to the [[regular language]]s, the [[context-free language]]s and the [[recursively enumerable language]]s, and other families of formal languages studied in the scientific literature.

==Formal definitions==

A ''formal language'' is a set {{mvar|L}} for which there exists a finite set of abstract symbols {{math|&amp;Sigma;}} such that &lt;math&gt;L \subseteq\Sigma^*&lt;/math&gt;, where * is the [[Kleene star]] operation.

A ''family of languages'' is an ordered pair &lt;math&gt;(\Sigma,\Lambda)&lt;/math&gt;, where
# {{math|&amp;Sigma;}} is an infinite set of symbols;
# {{math|&amp;Lambda;}} is a set of formal languages;
# For each {{mvar|L}} in {{math|&amp;Lambda;}} there exists a finite subset &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_1 \subset \Sigma&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;L \subseteq \Sigma_1^*&lt;/math&gt;; and
# {{math|''L'' ≠ Ø}} for some {{mvar|L}} in {{math|&amp;Lambda;}}.

A ''trio'' is a family of languages [[Closure (mathematics)|closed]] under [[e-free homomorphism]], inverse [[homomorphism]], and intersection with regular language.

A ''full trio,'' also called a  ''[[cone (formal languages)|cone]],'' is a trio closed under arbitrary homomorphism.

A ''(full) semi-AFL'' is a (full) trio  closed under [[Union (set theory)|union]].

A ''(full) AFL'' is a ''(full) semi-AFL'' closed under [[concatenation]] and the [[Kleene plus]].

==Some families of languages==
The following are some simple results from the study of abstract families of languages.&lt;ref name="Seymour"&gt;{{harvtxt|Ginsburg|1975}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SpringerAFL"&gt;{{SpringerEOM| title=Abstract family of languages | id=Abstract_family_of_languages | oldid=18934 | first=A. | last=Mateescu | first2=A. | last2=Salomaa }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the [[Chomsky hierarchy]], the regular languages, the context-free languages, and the recursively enumerable languages are all full AFLs. However, the [[Context-sensitive language|context sensitive languages]] and the [[recursive language]]s are AFLs, but not full AFLs because they are not closed under arbitrary homomorphisms.

The family of regular languages are contained within any cone (full trio). Other categories of abstract families are identifiable by closure under other operations such as shuffle, reversal, or substitution.&lt;ref name="SpringerOps"&gt;{{SpringerEOM| title=AFL operations | id=AFL_operations | oldid=13097 | first=Gh. | last=Păun }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==

[[Seymour Ginsburg]] of the [[University of Southern California]] and [[Sheila Greibach]] of [[Harvard University]] presented the first AFL theory paper at the IEEE Eighth Annual [[Symposium on Switching and Automata Theory]] in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Ginsburg|Greibach|1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alicia Dussán de Reichel''' (born 16 October 1920) is a [[Colombians|Colombian]] educator, who was one of the first students of ethnology in the country. For two decades, she was the only woman conducting archaeological and anthropological studies in the country. Her research focused on Colombia and the Caribbean and along with her husband, she founded [[University of Los Andes (Colombia)|University of the Andes]]' Department of Anthropology. She occupied Chair 15 of the [[Colombian Academy of Exact, Physical and Natural Sciences]] until 2008 and was the only anthropologist to be a member during her tenure. In 2010, she was honored by the French Government with the designation of officer of the [[Ordre des Arts et des Lettres]].

==Early life==
Alicia Dussán Maldonado was born on 16 October 1920 in [[Bogotá]], Colombia{{sfn|Colombian Academy of Sciences|2009}} to Lucrecia Maldonado Parra and Agustín Dussán Quiroga. Her father was a landowner, originally from [[Villavieja, Huila|Villavieja]] and her mother was a passionate liberal nationalist, as her father, José María Maldonado Neira, had served as a General in the [[Thousand Days' War]]. Another ancestor from her Parra line was Antonio María Díaz, who had fought in the [[Battle of Boyacá]]. From the third grade, Dussán developed an interest in other cultures, particularly those of Africa and Asia, as well as a curiosity with Colombia's indigenous people.{{sfn|Barragán|2013}}  

Dussán attended the Gimnasio Femenino ([[Gymnasium (school)|Women's Gymnasium]]) in Bogotá, a prestigious private school which incorporated a [[Montessori education|Montessori method]] as well as moral instruction to prepare young women to become good wives and mothers.{{sfn|Pineda Camacho|2012}} She was one of the first group of young women in Colombia who pursued higher education and a career. Dussán's father died before she completed high school. She graduated in 1938 and with the consent of her mother, decided to go to Europe to further her studies. She enrolled in the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|University of Berlin]] studying German Culture and Language.{{sfn|Pineda Camacho|2012}} and while she was in Europe took the opportunity to visit many museums, seeing for the first time archeological objects from South America.{{sfn|Barragán|2013}} She was forced to return to Colombia at the outbreak of [[World War II]]. Dussán enrolled in the Faculty of Law at the [[National University of Colombia]] in 1940,{{sfn|Pineda Camacho|2012}} but fascinated by archeology attended lectures offered by [[Paul Rivet]].{{sfn|Barragán|2013}} After studying law through 1941, she transferred to the [[National Ethnological Institute (Colombia)|National Ethnological Institute]] (NEI), which had recently been founded by Rivet. The program was an innovative approach to scientifically based methodology, rather than rote memorization. Students were encouraged to evaluate the biological, cultural and technological influences of indigenous peoples upon each other.{{sfn|Barragán|2013}} Receiving her degree in 1942,{{sfn|Colombian Academy of Sciences|2009}} the following year, Dussán married fellow student [[Gerardo Reichel-Dolmatoff]].{{sfn|Pineda Camacho|2012}}

==Career==
Between 1942 and 1945 Dussán worked as research assistant at NEI{{sfn|Colombian Academy of Sciences|2009}} and jointly worked with her husband on an evaluation of funerary urns in the [[Magdalena Department]] and carried out a study on the [[physical anthropology]] of the [[Pijao people]] of the [[Tolima Department]].{{sfn|Pineda Camacho|2012}} During this period, she also gave birth to the couple's first child, René Reichel Dussán.{{sfn|Barragán|2013}} She was awarded research grant to carry out studies in 1944 from the French government.{{sfn|Colombian Academy of Sciences|2009}} Besides the difficulty of the physical work, Dussán had to face criticism from local priests and other members of society, who felt that her dress and behavior were inappropriate for a woman. For the first two decades of her career, she was the only woman working in anthropology in Colombia,{{sfn|Pineda Camacho|2012}} and was ridiculed for not choosing a career as a social worker or nurse, if she insisted on working. Wearing pants, instead of the customary dresses for women at that time, and becoming one of the first women to drive a car resulted in people calling her a man and throwing stones at her.{{sfn|Gómez Giraldo|2009}} 

In 1946, she co-founded with her husband the Ethnological Institute of Magdalena and worked there through 1950.{{sfn|Colombian Academy of Sciences|2009}} Collecting ceramics and ethnographic materials, they established a museum of pieces they amassed during their joint archaeological fieldwork in an area they designated as ''Pueblito'', which is now in the [[Tayrona National Natural Park]], and the river valleys surrounding the [[Ranchería River|Ranchería]] and [[Cesar River|Cesar Rivers]].{{sfn|Pineda Camacho|2012}} One particularly important ritual they documented was a practice of [[secondary burial]] among the [[Yukpa people|Yuko or Yukpa people]] who lived in the northeastern part of the [[Cesar Department]].{{sfn|Barragán|2013}} Working on the slopes of the [[Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta]], Dussán who was pregnant again, collected materials from the local indigenous people on their mythology, socialization processes, and traditions. Using field questionnaires designed and adapted from [[Margaret Mead]]'s methodology, she made pioneering studies on gender relations and parenting traditions in [[Taganga]].{{sfn|Pineda Camacho|2012}}

In 1951, Dussán began working as a research assistant to the [[Colombian Institute of Anthropology and History]] until 1956.{{sfn|Colombian Academy of Sciences|2009}} She and her husband undertook work at a site known as ''Aritama'', a pseudonym for [[Atanquez|Atánquez]],{{sfn|Barragán|2013}} where they could study the villagers of the [[Kankuamo|Kankuamo people]]. The [[mestizo]] town offered an opportunity to study the transitions between cultures, as to those in nearby [[Valledupar]], the village was known as an indigenous town, but to those living in traditional native communities, Atánquez was viewed as a "Spanish" town. The couple's findings, which included Dussán's analysis of the social changes, documented how the society had been reshaped by [[First contact (anthropology)|contact]] would be published as ''The People of Aritama'' (1961), which quickly became a classic of the studies of early society in Colombia.{{sfn|Pineda Camacho|2012}} Her work was funded in part by a research grant from the [[Wenner Gren Foundation]] in New York City.{{sfn|Colombian Academy of Sciences|2009}} Between 1954 and 1958, the couple lived in [[Cartagena, Colombia|Cartagena]] and worked in a collaborative program sponsored by the [[University of Cartagena]] and their new department focusing on public health and preventative medicine. The program allowed them to participate in archaeological digs along the [[Caribbean|Caribbean coast]] of Colombia, and conduct [[Medical anthropology|medical anthropological studies]], which were insightful for their findings on Atánquez.{{sfn|Pineda Camacho|2012}} 

Returning to Bogatá in 1960, Dussán took a job with the Inter-American Center for Housing and Planning (IACHP) and{{sfn|Camargo Rojas|2009}} later that year, she took a position as a research associate of the [[Institute of Andean Research]] in Washington, D. C. through 1962.{{sfn|Colombian Academy of Sciences|2009}} These organizations allowed exploration to continue on the Pacific coast, in an area ranging from Panama's [[Darién Province]] to the [[Colombia–Ecuador border]]. Very little archaeological work had been done in the area at the time.{{sfn|Barragán|2013}} While studying in the area, ''El Hermanito'' an [[Apocalypticism|apocalyptic prophet]] became the subject of one of her studies. ''El Hermanito''′s doomsday predictions affected both the customs and local economy, causing both [[Indigenous peoples in Colombia|indigenous]] and [[Afro-Colombians|Afro-Colombian]] populations to sell off their belongings or sacrifice them into the river, and kill off their livestock. Dussán's study of the movement was the first [[Anthropology of religion|religiously based anthropological study]] of its kind in [[Latin America]]. The association with the IACHP allowed Dussán to study urban problems, evaluating marginal neighborhoods. One such study focused on the El Carmen neighborhood of Bogotá.{{sfn|Pineda Camacho|2012}}

In 1964, the Reichels founded the Department of Anthropology at the [[University of Los Andes (Colombia)|Universidad de los Andes]] at the suggestion of the [[Rector (academia)|rector]], Ramón de Zubiría. Financed by the [[Ford Foundation]], they designed a program which would grant a degree in applied anthropology covering studies in archaeology, ethnology, linguistics, [[material culture]] studies and physical anthropology.{{sfn|Barragán|2013}} In addition to working as a professor in the department,{{sfn|Colombian Academy of Sciences|2009}} Dussán traveled at her own expense to evaluate the anthropology departments at [[New York University]], [[Tulane University]], and [[UCLA]] to develop programs which could be adapted for the new department. Dussán published ''Problemas y necesidades de la investigación etnológica en Colombia'' (Problems and Needs of Ethnological Research in Colombia, 1965) which stressed the urgency of evaluating those communities in danger of having their cultures usurped by modernization. The essay had international impact and created discussion on the importance of fieldwork and preserving indigenous cultures. In 1967, she served as the Colombian representative to the first international conference, held in Austria, which discussed teaching anthropology in Latin America and her paper, presented at the conference urged that their program was ready to undertake postgraduate training.{{sfn|Pineda Camacho|2012}} Between 1967 and

[[Image:Banksia menziesii 1 gnangarra.jpg|thumb|right|The sequential anthesis of the individual flowers in this ''[[Banksia menziesii]]'' inflorescence has begun.]]
'''Anthesis''' is the period during which a [[flower]] is fully open and functional. It may also refer to the onset of that period.

The onset of anthesis is spectacular in some species. In ''[[Banksia]]'' species, for example, anthesis involves the extension of the [[carpel|style]] far beyond the upper [[perianth]] parts. Anthesis of flowers is sequential within an [[inflorescence]], so when the style and perianth are different colours, the result is a striking colour change that gradually sweeps along the inflorescence.

Flowers with [[diurnality|diurnal]] anthesis generally are brightly colored in order to attract diurnal insects, such as butterflies.
Flowers with [[nocturnal]] anthesis generally are white or less colorful, and as such, they contrast more strongly with the night. These flowers typically attract nocturnal insects including many moth species.

The '''Book of Tobit''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|oʊ|b|ɪ|t}}){{efn|from the {{lang-grc-gre|Τωβίθ}} ''Tōbith'' or {{lang|el|Τωβίτ}} ''Tōbit'',&lt;ref&gt;{{lang|grc|Τωβείθ}} and {{lang|el|Τωβείτ}} spellings are also attested; see [[iotacism]].&lt;/ref&gt; itself from {{lang-he|טובי}} ''Tovi'' "my good";  '''Book of Tobias''' in the [[Vulgate]] from the Greek {{lang|grc|Τωβίας}} ''Tōbias'', itself from the Hebrew {{lang|he|טוביה}} ''Tovyah'' "[[Jah|Yah]] is good"}} is a book of scripture that is part of the [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholic]] and [[Eastern Orthodoxy|Orthodox]] [[biblical canon]]s. It was pronounced canonical by the [[Council of Hippo]] (in 393), the [[Councils of Carthage]] of 397 and 417, and the [[Council of Florence]] (in 1442), and confirmed in the [[Counter-Reformation]] by the [[Council of Trent]] (1546). It is not found in Protestant or Jewish biblical canons.

==Canonical status==
===In Christianity===
The Book of Tobit is listed as a canonical book by the [[Council of Rome]] (382 AD),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tertullian.org/decretum_eng.htm&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Council of Hippo]] (393 AD),&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |chapter-url=http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf214.xv.iv.iv.xxv.html |chapter=Canon XXIV.

Roman Catholics often refer to it as [[Deuterocanonical books|deuterocanonical]].&lt;ref name="Fitzmyer55"/&gt;

[[Athanasius of Alexandria|Athanasius]] (367 AD) mentioned that certain other books, including the book of Tobit, while not being part of the Canon, "were appointed by the Fathers to be read".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=of Alexandria|first1=Athanasius|title=CHURCH FATHERS: Letter 39 (Athanasius)|publisher=newadvent|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/2806039.htm|accessdate=14 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the monk [[Rufinus of Aquileia]] (c. 400 AD) the book of Tobit and other deuterocanonical books were not called Canonical but Ecclesiastical books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=of Aquileia|first1=Rufinus|title=Commentary on the Apostles' Creed #38|publisher=newadvent|url=http://www.newadvent.org/fathers/2711.htm|accessdate=12 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Judaism===
Before the 1952 discovery of [[Aramaic]] and [[Hebrew (language)|Hebrew]] fragments of Tobit among the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] in a cave at [[Qumran]], scholars believed Tobit was not included in the Jewish canon because of late authorship, estimated to 100 AD.&lt;ref name="Fitzmyer55" &gt;Fitzmyer, at pp. 50, 55–57&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deadseascrolls.org.il/learn-about-the-scrolls/scrolls-content |title=Scrolls Content |publisher=The Dead Sea Scrolls |accessdate=2014-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Qumran fragments of the text, which were copied between 100 BC to 25 AD, evidence a much earlier origin than previously thought.&lt;ref name="Fitzmyer55" /&gt; These fragments evidence authorship no later than the 2nd century BC and, likely, contemporary with the date ascribed, by modern scholars, to the final compilation of the [[Book of Daniel]], which did attain canonical status.&lt;ref&gt;R. Glenn Wooden, "Changing Perceptions of Daniel: Reading Chapters 4 and 5 of Daniel", in'' From Biblical Criticism to Biblical Faith'', Brackney &amp; Evans eds., p. 10 (Mercer Univ.Press 2007) {{ISBN|0-88146-052-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other scholars have postulated that Tobit was excluded from the Jewish Scriptures for a [[Halakha|halakhic]] reason because Raguel, the bride's father, wrote the marriage document discussed in 7:16, instead of the bridegroom, as required by Jewish rabbinical law.&lt;ref name="Fitzmyer55" /&gt;

However, it could be hypothesized that some ancient Jewish rabbinic scholars considered Tobit to be historical. [[Bereishit Rabbah|Midrash Bereishit Rabbah]], an aggadic commentary on the [[Book of Genesis]] compiled circa 400–600 AD, includes a truncated [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]] version of Tobit. Tobit was also considered part of the [[Septuagint]] (the Greek translation/interpretation of the Hebrew Bible).&lt;ref name="Fitzmyer55" /&gt;  In more contemporary times, a number of Jews in Israel have sought to reclaim Tobit as part of the canon.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Bredin, ''Studies in the Book of Tobit: A Multidisciplinary Approach'', p. 3 (T&amp;T Clark 2006), {{ISBN|0-567-08229-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==

This book tells the story of '''Tobit''', a righteous Israelite of the [[tribe of Naphtali]], living in [[Nineveh]] after [[Sargon II]] had deported the northern tribes of [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]] to [[Assyria]] in 721 BC. In the two Greek versions, the first two and a half chapters are written in the first person; in the Vulgate version, they are written in the third person.&lt;ref&gt;''Septuaginta: Editio altera/Revised Edition,'' 2006: Deutsche Bibelgesellschaft, Stuttgart, pp. 1002-1039; ''Biblia Sacra Vulgata,'' vierte, verbesserte Auflage 1994: Deutsche Bibelgesellschaft, Stuttgart, pp. 676-690.&lt;/ref&gt; Tobit, raised by his paternal grandmother, Deborah, remains loyal to the worship of God at the temple in Jerusalem, refusing the cult of the [[golden calf|golden calves]] that [[Jeroboam]], king of Northern Israel, set up at [[Dan (ancient city)|Dan]]. He is particularly noted for his diligence in attempting to provide proper burials for fallen Israelites whom Sargon's successor, [[Sennacherib]], has slain. For this behavior the king seizes his property and exiles him. After Sennacherib's death, Tobit is allowed to return to Nineveh, where he buries a man who has been murdered on the street. That night, he sleeps in the open and is blinded by bird droppings which fall into his eyes. The blindness caused by this injury strains his marriage and, ultimately, he prays for death.&lt;ref name=je&gt;[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/14422-tobit-book-of "Tobit, book of", ''Jewish Encyclopedia'']&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Tobias cura a cegueira de seu pai - Domingos Sequeira.png|thumb|right|250px|''Tobias heals the blindness of his father Tobit'', by [[Domingos Sequeira]]]]

Meanwhile, in faraway [[Medes|Media]], a young woman named Sarah has prayed for death in despair. The [[demon]] of lust, [[Asmodeus]] ("the worst of demons"), abducts and kills every man Sarah marries on their wedding night before the marriage can be consummated. God sends the angel [[Raphael (archangel)|Raphael]], disguised as a human, to heal Tobit and free Sarah from the demon.&lt;ref name=je/&gt;

The main narrative is dedicated to Tobit's son, Tobiah or Tobiyah (Greek: {{lang|el|Τωβίας}} ''Tobias''), who is sent by his father to collect money that the elder has deposited in distant Media. Raphael presents himself as Tobit's kinsman, Azariah, and offers to aid and protect Tobias. Under Raphael's guidance, Tobias journeys to Media with his dog.

Along the way, while washing his feet in the river [[Tigris]], a fish tries to swallow his foot. By the angel's order, he captures it and removes its heart, liver and gall bladder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Tobit+6&amp;version=GNT |title= Tobit 6 GNT – Tobias Catches a Fish – So Tobias and |publisher= Bible Gateway |accessdate= 2014-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon arriving in Media, Raphael tells Tobias of the beautiful Sarah, whom Tobias has the right to marry because he is her cousin and closest relative. The angel instructs the young man to burn the fish's liver and heart to drive away the demon when he attacks on the wedding night.&lt;ref name=Drum&gt;{{cite book|url= http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14749c.htm|chapter=Book of Tobias|title=Catholic Encyclopedia|year=1909|publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two marry, and the fumes of the burning organs drive the demon to [[Upper Egypt]], where Raphael follows and binds him. Sarah's father had been digging a grave to secretly bury Tobias under the assumption that he would be killed. Surprised to find his son-in-law alive and well, he orders a double-length wedding feast and has the grave secretly filled. Since the feast prevents him from leaving, Tobias sends Raphael to recover his father's money.&lt;ref name=Drum/&gt;

After the feast, Tobias and Sarah return to Nineveh. There, Raphael tells the youth to use the fish's gall to cure his father's blindness. Raphael then reveals his identity and returns to heaven, and Tobit sings a hymn of praise.&lt;ref name=Drum/&gt;

Tobit tells his son to leave Nineveh before God destroys it according to prophecy (compare the [[Book of Nahum]]). After the prayer, Tobit dies at an advanced age.&lt;ref&gt;
Tobit's age at death is variously given as 127 years in Greek I, 117 years in Greek II and the [[Vetus Latina]], and 102 years in most manuscripts of the [[Vulgate]], 112 years in others,
* (158) "an hundred and eight and fifty years old" in [[s:Bible (King James)/Tobit#14:11|Tobit 14:11 KJV]] (Wikisource)
* (102) "a hundred and two years" {{bibleref|Tobit|14:2|63}} Douay-Rheims (Biblegateway)
&lt;/ref&gt;
After burying his father and mother, Tobias returns to Media with his family.

==Liturgical and religious significance==
Readings from the book are used in the [[Latin Rite]]. Because of the book's praise for the purity of marriage, it is often read during weddings in many rites. Doctrinally, the book is cited for its teaching on the [[intercession]] of angels, [[filial piety]], and reverence for the dead.&lt;ref name=nab&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/__PCA.HTM "Introduction"], ''Tobit'', NAB, Libreria Editrice Vaticana {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150227202156/http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG0839/__PCA.HTM |date=February 27, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition==

===Dating===
The story in the Book of Tobit is set in the 8th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, at p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; However, a number of historical errors (according to Miller, though some may dispute this) rule out contemporaneous authorship,&lt;ref&gt;Miller, at p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; and most scholars now date the book's composition between 225 and 175 BC.&lt;ref name="Fitzmyer51"&gt;Fitzmyer, at p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;  The direct quote in Tobit 2:6 from the [[Book of Amos]] ("Your feasts shall be turned into mourning, and all your mirth into lamentation"&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleref2|Tobit.2:5–7;Amos.8:10||DRA|cf. Tobit 2:5–7 &amp;amp; Amos 8:10}}&lt;/ref&gt;) indicates that the prophetic books had become not only fixed but authoritative, signalling a [[post-exilic]] date.&lt;ref name="Fitzmyer51"/&gt; Moreover, reference to the "Book of Moses" (6:13, 7:11–13) and the "Law of Moses" (7:13) echo identical phrasing in the [[Book of Chronicles]], which some believe was composed after the 4th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzmyer, at p. 51; Miller, at p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;  Contextually, dating Tobit's authorship to after 175 BC is problematic, as the author expresses no awareness of [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucid]] attempts to [[Hellenization|Hellenize]] [[Judea]] (from 175 BC) or of the [[Maccabean Revolt]] against the Seleucids (165 BC), nor does it espouse apocalyptic or messianic expectations upon which later writings focused.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzmyer, at pp. 51–52; Miller at pp. 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless, some scholars espouse a later date of composition of at least portions of Tobit.&lt;ref&gt;Fitzmyer, at p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Location and language===
No scholarly consensus exists on the place of composition, and "almost every region of the ancient world seems to be a candidate."&lt;ref name="Miller12"&gt;Miller, at pp. 12–13.&lt;/ref&gt;  A [[Mesopotamian]] origin seems logical given that the story takes place in [[Assyria]] and [[Persia]], as does the invocation of the Persian demon "aeshma daeva", rendered "[[Asmodeus]]" by Tobit.&lt;ref name="Miller12"/&gt; But significant errors in geographical detail (such as the distance from [[Ecbatana]] to [[Rey, Iran|Rhages]] and their topography) render this origin questionable.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, at p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Arguments against and in favor of Judean or Egyptian composition also exist.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, at pp. 12–15.&lt;/ref&gt;

The original language of composition remains unclear. Tobit may have been originally composed either in [[Aramaic]] or Hebrew, since fragments of Tobit in both languages have been discovered at [[Qumran]].

===Genre===
The book is closely related to Jewish [[wisdom literature]]. This is especially clear in Tobit's instructions to Tobias before his departure for Media in Chapter 4, which particularly praise the value of prayer, fasting, and almsgiving.

==Manuscripts==
As stated, fragments of Tobit in both Aramaic and Hebrew have been discovered at [[Qumran]].&lt;ref&gt;Four Aramaic fragmentary texts of Tobit (4QTob&lt;sup&gt;a–d&lt;/sup&gt;ar [=4Q196-199]) and one Hebrew text (4QTob&lt;sup&gt;e&lt;/sup&gt; [=4Q200]) were found at [[Qumran]] in Cave IV.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ccat.sas.upenn.edu"&gt;A.A. Di Lella, [http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/nets/edition/19-tobit-nets.pdf ''New English Translation of the Septuagint'', "Tobit" (PDF)], 2007&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jerome]] described his version for the [[Vulgate]] as being made from an Aramaic text available to him.

Surviving [[Greek (language)|Greek]] translations are found in two versions. The shorter, which Robert Hanhart called Greek I in his edition of the [[Septuagint]], is found in [[Codex Vaticanus Graecus 1209|Codex Vaticanus]], [[Codex Alexandrinus|Alexandrinus]], Venetus, and most cursive manuscripts. The Greek II version, 1700 words longer, is found in [[Codex Sinaiticus]] and closely aligns with the Hebrew and Aramaic fragments found at Qumran. Apparently the Old Latin (La) manuscripts are also translated from the longer Greek II version. Most English translations since 1966 have relied on the Greek II version.&lt;ref name="ccat.sas.upenn.edu"/&gt;

The '''Bren School of Environmental Science &amp; Management''' is a graduate professional school at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]].

The mission of the Bren School is to play a leading role in researching environmental issues, identifying and solving environmental problems, and training research scientists and environmental-management professionals.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bren.ucsb.edu/about/mission.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

In 1991, recognizing the need for a graduate school dedicated to the study of the environment, the [[Regents of the University of California]] established the School of Environmental Science &amp; Management at UC Santa Barbara.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bren.ucsb.edu/about/about_history.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, [[Jeff Dozier]] became the school's first dean. In 1995, the first faculty were appointed, and in 1996 the first master's students were admitted, receiving their degrees in 1998. In 2000, the first PhD students were admitted. The first PhD degrees were awarded in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bren.ucsb.edu/about/about_history.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, the school received a major gift from the Donald Bren Foundation to provide funding for endowed faculty chairs, faculty scholars, visiting lecturers, conferences, and student support. In recognition of the gift, the school was renamed the Bren School of Environmental Science &amp; Management.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bren.ucsb.edu/about/about_history.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, [[Bren Hall]] was completed, providing the school with the facilities and the physical focus it retains to this day.

== Degree programs ==
The Bren School offers Master of Environmental Science &amp; Management (MESM) and [[Doctor of Philosophy]] (Ph.D.) degrees.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bren.ucsb.edu/academics&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Master of Environmental Science &amp; Management ===

The Bren School's Master of Environmental Science &amp; Management (MESM) degree is a two-year program comparable to the [[Master of Environmental Management]] (MEM) degree offered by other schools. The Bren School chose to include "Science" in the name of its degree to emphasize its focus on environmental science.

One notable aspect of the master's program at the Bren School is the group project. The master's thesis for MESM candidates consists of a project, usually proposed by an agency or company having a local, statewide, nationwide, or international presence. Group projects begin during the spring quarter of the first year of study, and culminate in a final presentation to the Bren community, project stakeholders, and local professionals.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bren.ucsb.edu/academics/MESM.html&lt;/ref&gt;

=== PhD in Environmental Science &amp; Management ===

The Bren School's PhD program is designed to prepare leaders in Environmental Science &amp; Management. The program is notable for its focus on a wide variety of environmental issues.

== Bren Hall ==
[[File:Bren Hall, UCSB.jpg|thumb|Bren Hall]]
The school's classrooms, laboratories, and other facilities are located in [[Bren Hall]]. Since opening in 2002, Bren Hall has been recognized as an exemplar of sustainable building practices. The building was the first laboratory building in the United States to receive a [[LEED Platinum]] certification from the [[U.S. Green Building Council]] (USGBC) in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bren.ucsb.edu/facilities/greening_bren_hall.html&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the building became the first structure in the nation to received a second [[LEED Platinum]] certification—the ''LEED for Existing Buildings: Operations &amp; Maintenance''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bren.ucsb.edu/news/platinum_eb.htm&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2017, Bren Hall received its third LEED Platinum certification. The building was the highest scoring LEED project in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usgbc.org/articles/defining-projects-and-policies-2017-top-10-states|title=Defining projects and policies of the 2017 Top 10 States {{!}} U.S. Green Building Council|website=www.usgbc.org|language=en|access-date=2018-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1436">The '''cam plastometer''' is a [[physical test]]ing machine. It measures the resistance of non-brittle materials to compressive deformation at constant true-strain rates. In this way, it can be compared a bit to the [[Gleeble_Systems|Gleeble(R)]]. In the early days, the machine operates at relatively low [[strain rate]]s, but over time it has been enhanced and currently it can operate over a wide range of strain rates&lt;ref&gt;J.E. Hockett and N.A. Lindsay, Journal of Physics E: Scientific Instruments 4 (1971), 520-522.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The machine is [[patent]]ed under the name of "United States Patent 4109516".&lt;ref name="patent"&gt;[http://www.freepatentsonline.com/4109516.html Cam plastometer (freepatentsonline.com)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the machine, deformation compressive forces are applied to a specimen by two flat, opposing [[platen]]s which impact a flat, rectangular specimen. The deformation forces can be varied during operation, to simulate actual conditions which occur during industrial pressing and forming operations. The plastometer is also capable of torsional testing of specimens".&lt;ref name="patent" /&gt; 

The cam plastometers are expensive and there are only a few of them in the world.&lt;ref&gt;G.E. Dieter et al., ''Handbook of Workability and Process Design'', ASM International 2003, page 49&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Centre for Advanced Structural Ceramics''' is a multidisciplinary research centre focusing on materials science and engineering involving ceramic materials for applications such as aerospace, energy and tissue engineering. It is located within [[Imperial College London]] in the [[United Kingdom]].

It was intended from conception to facilitate research between CASC-associated academics and the UK’s industrial structural ceramics community. Its stated goal is to provide a "critical mass of UK expertise in the fundamental understanding of structural ceramics that is highly relevant to key areas of the economy including, energy generation, aerospace and defence, transport and healthcare". Funding initially came through the [[Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council]] but it is now funded through an industrial consortium including members such as [[Rolls-Royce Holdings]], [[Morgan Advanced Materials]] and [[Reaction Engines]].&lt;ref name = CASCsite&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www3.imperial.ac.uk/structuralceramics|title= Imperial College CASC Page|last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website= |publisher= Imperial College London|access-date= 27 August 2015|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CASC's work draws from skills of multiple fields, including chemistry, physics, materials and earth sciences and business. It supports the dissemination of knowledge of ceramic materials through annual summer schools, industry days, workshops and lectures.&lt;ref name = ACS&gt;{{cite web |url= http://ceramics.org/ceramic-tech-today/uks-imperial-college-builds-global-advanced-ceramics-industry-university-consortium|title= UK’s Imperial College builds global advanced ceramics industry–university consortium|last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website= ceramics.org|publisher= The American Ceramic Society|access-date= 27 August 2015|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3885">'''Conventional sex''', or '''vanilla sex''', is [[Human sexual activity|sexual behavior]] that is within the [[normal (behaviour)|range of normality]] for a culture or subculture, and typically involves sex which does not include elements of [[BDSM]], [[kink (sexual)|kink]], or [[Sexual fetishism|fetishism]].

==Description==
What is regarded as conventional sex depends on cultural and subcultural norms. Among heterosexual couples in the [[Western world]], for example, conventional sex often refers to [[sexual intercourse]] in the [[missionary position]]. It can also describe [[penetrative sex]] which does not have any element of BDSM, kink or fetish.

The ''[[BMJ|British Medical Journal]]'' regards conventional sex between homosexual couples as "sex that does not extend beyond affection, [[mutual masturbation]], and [[Oral sex|oral]] and [[anal sex]]."&lt;ref name ="gay vanilla sex"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Bell |first1=Robin |date=13 February 1999 |title=Homosexual men and women |journal=[[BMJ]] |volume=318 |issue=7181 |pages=452–5 |doi=10.1136/bmj.318.7181.452 |url=http://www.bmj.com/content/318/7181/452 |accessdate=9 November 2011 |pmid=9974466 |pmc=1114912}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to mutual masturbation, penetrative sexual activity among same-sex pairings is contrasted by [[Non-penetrative sex|non-insertive]] acts such as [[intercrural sex]], [[frot]] and [[tribadism]], although tribadism has been cited as a common but rarely discussed sexual practice among lesbians.&lt;ref name="Carroll"&gt;{{cite book |first=Janell L. |last=Carroll |title=Sexuality Now: Embracing Diversity |edition=Third |id= {{ISBN|978-0-495-60274-3}} |publisher=Cengage Learning |location=Belmont, Calif. |year=2009 |page=629 |oclc=426044136 |accessdate=2010-12-19 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5f8mQx7ULs4C&amp;pg=PA272&amp;dq=Lesbians+and+tribadism#v=onepage&amp;q=Lesbians%20and%20tribadism&amp;f=false|isbn=0495602744 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Halberstam"&gt;{{cite book |first=Judith |last=Halberstam |title=Female Masculinity |id= {{ISBN|978-0-8223-2243-6}} |oclc=39235591 |publisher=Duke University Press |location=Durham, N.C. |year=1998 |page=61 |accessdate=2010-12-19 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UYAi9OEYRekC&amp;pg=PA61&amp;dq=Lesbians+tribadism#v=onepage&amp;q=Lesbians%20tribadism&amp;f=false|isbn=0822322439 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vanilla sexuality==
The term ''vanilla'' in "vanilla sex" derives from the use of [[vanilla]] extract as the basic flavoring for [[ice cream]], and by extension, meaning plain or conventional. In relationships where only one partner enjoys less conventional forms of sexual expression, the partner who does not enjoy such activities as much as the other is often referred to as the ''vanilla partner''. As such, it is easy for them to be erroneously branded unadventurous in sexual matters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Sadomasochism: Powerful Pleasures |last=Nichols |first=Margaret |editor1-first=Peggy J. |editor1-last= Kleinplatz |editor2-first=Charles |editor2-last=Moser |year=2006 |publisher=Harrington Park Press |location=New York |chapter=Psychotherapeutic Issues With 'Kinky' Clients: Clinical Problems, Yours and Theirs |id= {{ISBN|1-56023-640-X}} |oclc=61758612 |pages=281–300 |url=http://ipgcounseling.com/issues_with_kinky_clients.html |accessdate=9 November 2011|isbn=1560236396 }} Paper on the difficulties facing "vanilla partners". {{Google books|iHkT5Eyj7H0C|Sadomasochism: Powerful Pleasures|page=281}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Through exploration with their partner, it may be possible for a more vanilla-minded person to discover new facets of their sexuality. As with any sexually active person, they may find their preferences on the commonly termed "vanilla-kink spectrum" are sufficient for their full satisfaction.

Since 1990 there has been intense debate among [[paleontologist]]s about the evolution in the Early [[Cambrian]] period of the "super-[[phylum]]" [[Lophotrochozoa]], which is thought to include the modern [[mollusc]]s, [[annelid]] worms and [[brachiopod]]s, as well as their evolutionary "aunts" and "cousins".

The name "halwaxiid" was formed by combining the names of two members of the proposed group, ''[[Halkieria]]'' and ''[[Wiwaxia]]''. The group was defined as a set of Early to Mid [[Cambrian]] animals that had: a "chain mail" coat of three [[concentric]] bands of small armor plates that are called [[sclerite]]s; in some cases, a small cap-like shell at the front end and in some cases both ends.&lt;ref name="ConwayMorrisCaron2007" /&gt; Some scientists are unhappy with this loose definition, arguing that such traits may have arisen [[convergent evolution|convergently]] rather being inherited from a common ancestor. This objection suggests that the group is not [[monophyletic]],&lt;ref name=ButterfieldPalAss&gt;{{cite conference

}}&lt;/ref&gt; in other words that the group does not contain all and only the descendants of a single common ancestor. In fact the originators of the term "halwaxiid" prefer an evolutionary "family tree" in which the halwaxiids are not monophyletic.&lt;ref name="ConwayMorrisCaron2007" /&gt;

Other fossil organisms became involved in the debate as there were plausible arguments for considering them closely related to the halkieriids or ''[[Wiwaxia]]'' or both. One was the more recently discovered ''[[Orthrozanclus]]'', which looked an intermediate between the halkieriids and ''[[Wiwaxia]]'' as it had a shell like that of halkieriids, and [[Biomineralization|unmineralized]] sclerites and long spines like those of ''Wiwaxia'' – in fact the article which first described ''Orthrozanclus'' introduced the term "halwaxiid".&lt;ref name="ConwayMorrisCaron2007" /&gt; New finds of ''[[Odontogriphus]]'' put this animal into play as well since, despite its lack of sclerites or shells, its feeding apparatus looks very like ''Wiwaxia''’s.&lt;ref name="ConwayMorrisCaron2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Butterfield2006" /&gt; The [[Siphogonotuchida|siphogonotuchids]], a very Early Cambrian group known only from isolated sclerites among the [[small shelly fossils]], also appear in analyses as their sclerites suggest this group  may have been close to the ancestors of halkieriids.&lt;ref name="ConwayMorrisCaron2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Genera group=note&gt;The original, possibly incomplete, list includes ''[[Australohalkieria]], [[Drepanochites]], [[Eohalobia]], [[Halkieria]], [[Lomasulcachites]], [[Ninella]], [[Ocruranus]], [[Oikozetetes]], [[Orthrozanclus]], [[Sinosachites]], [[Siphogonuchites]], [[Thambetolepis]]'', and ''[[Wiwaxia]]'' — {{cite journal

==Suggested phylogenies==
Since 1995 several [[phylogeny|phylogenies]], or evolutionary "family trees", have been suggested for these organisms. The position of ''[[Wiwaxia]]'' is highlighted, since the position of this organism has been central to the debate since 1990.&lt;ref name="CaronScheltemaSchanderRudkin2006"&gt;{{cite journal

The most intense part of the debate centers round ''[[Wiwaxia]]''. Conway Morris (1985) originally dismissed the earliest classification of ''[[Wiwaxia]]'' as a [[polychaete]] worm, because he thought there was little structural similarity between a polychaete's scale-like [[elytra]] and ''Wiwaxia''’s [[sclerite]]s, and because the arrangement of the sclerites, with quite different numbers in each band, showed no sign of the regular [[Segmentation (biology)|segmentation]] that is a feature of polychaetes. Instead he thought ''Wiwaxia'' was very similar to shell-less [[aplacophora]]n [[mollusc]]s, that it must have moved on a mollusc-like muscular foot, and that its feeding apparatus looked like a primitive form of the molluscan [[radula]], a tooth-bearing [[chitin]]ous "tongue". Hence he classified it as a "[[cladistics|sister]]" of the molluscs.&lt;ref name="ConwayMorris1985"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he briefly described the first articulated specimens of ''[[Halkieria]]'' in 1990, Conway Morris wrote of "the halkieriid-wiwaxiid body plan" and that the halkieriids might be close relatives of molluscs.&lt;ref name="ConwayMorrisPeel1990"/&gt;

Shortly after this in 1990 Butterfield published his first paper on ''Wiwaxia''. He argued that, since ''Wiwaxia''’s sclerites appeared  to be solid, they were not similar to the hollow sclerites of halkieriids. In fact he thought they were more similar to the chitinous bristles ([[setae]]) that project from the bodies of modern annelids and in some [[genus|genera]] form leaf-like scales that cover the back like roof tiles - in composition, in detailed structure, in how they were attached to the body via follicle-like pockets in the skin, and in overall appearance. He also contended that Wiwaxia’s feeding apparatus, instead of being mounted in the middle of its "head", was just as likely to be mounted in two parts on the sides of the "head", an arrangement that is common in polychaetes. He therefore classified ''Wiwaxia'' as a polychaete.&lt;ref name="Butterfield1990"&gt;{{cite journal

| jstor=2400789| issue=3 | doi=
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conway Morris and Peel (1995) largely accepted Butterfield's arguments and treated ''Wiwaxia'' as an ancestor or "aunt" of the polychaetes. However they maintained that Wiwaxia’s feeding apparatus was much more like a molluscan radula. They also argued that Wiwaxia was fairly closely related to and in fact descended from the halkieriids, as the sclerites are divided into similar groups, although those of halkieriids were much smaller, more numerous and hollow. They wrote that in 1994 Butterfield had found ''Wiwaxia'' sclerites that were clearly hollow. The cladogram they presented showed the halkieriids split into three groups: one as "aunts" of [[brachiopod]]s, animals whose modern forms have bivalve shells but differ from molluscs in having muscular stalks and a distinctive feeding apparatus, the [[lophophore]]; the second group of halkieriids as "aunts" of both ''Wiwaxia'' and [[annelid]] worms; and the earliest halkieriids as "great aunts" of all of these.&lt;ref name="ConwayMorrisPeel1995" /&gt;

Marine biologist Amélie H. Scheltema  ''et al.'' (2003) argued that ''Wiwaxia''’s feeding apparatus is very similar to the [[radula]]s of some modern shell-less [[aplacophora]]n [[mollusc]]s, and that the sclerites of the two groups are very similar. They concluded that ''Wiwaxia'' was a member of a [[clade]] that includes molluscs.&lt;ref name="www3.interscience.wiley.com"/&gt;

Danish zoologist Danny Eibye-Jacobsen (2004) regarded bristles as a feature shared by molluscs, annelids and brachiopods. Hence even if ''Wiwaxia''’s sclerites closely resembled bristles, which he doubted, this would not prove that ''Wiwaxia''’s closest relative were annelids. He also pointed out that the very different numbers of sclerites in the various zones of ''Wiwaxia''’s body do not correspond to any reasonable pattern of segmentation. Since in his opinion ''Wiwaxia'' lacked other clearly polychaete features, he regarded this as an argument against classifying ''Wiwaxia'' as a polychaete. In his opinion there were no strong grounds for classifying ''Wiwaxia'' as a proto-annelid or a proto-mollusc.&lt;ref name="EibyeJacobsen2004"/&gt;

Caron, Scheltema ''et al.'' (2006), in a paper about newly discovered and good specimens of ''[[Odontogriphus]]'', thought ''Wiwaxia'' bore little resemblance to polychaetes as it showed no signs of the segmentation, [[appendage]]s in front of the mouth, or "[[parapodia|legs]]" – all of which are typical polychaete features. On the other hand they thought the teeth on the feeding apparatus of both ''Wiwaxia'' and ''Odontogriphus'' strongly resembled those of a modern group of molluscs, [[Neomeniomorpha]]. Hence they classified ''Wiwaxia'' as an "aunt" and ''Odontogriphus'' as a "great aunt" of molluscs.&lt;ref name="CaronScheltemaSchanderRudkin2006" /&gt;

Butterfield returned to the debate in 2006, repeating the arguments he presented in 1990 for regarding ''Wiwaxia'' as an early polychaete and adding that, while bristles are a feature of several groups, they appear as a covering over the back only in polychaetes. He also questioned whether the two or three rows of teeth in ''Wiwaxia'' and ''Odontogriphus'' could function in the same way as the belt-like molluscan radula with its many tooth-rows; on the other hand one group of polychaetes uses a single two-part "jaw" to scrape food off a [[Substrate (biology)|substrate]]. While he agreed that ''Wiwaxia'' and ''Odontogriphus'' were very similar, he wrote, "… it certainly does not require that they be [[shoehorn]]ed into the same lineage. … the seemingly trivial distinction between these two taxa is exactly what is expected at the divergence points leading from a last common ancestor to extant phyla."&lt;ref name=Butterfield2006&gt;{{cite journal

Butterfield (2006) accepted that ''Wiwaxia'' and ''Odontogriphus'' were closely related, but argued that they were stem-group polychaetes rather than stem-group molluscs. In his opinion the feeding apparatus of these organisms, with consisted of two or at most four rows of teeth, could not perform the functions of the "belt-like" molluscan radula with their numerous tooth-rows; the different tooth-rows in both ''Wiwaxia'' and ''Odontogriphus'' tooth-rows also have noticeably different shapes, while those of molluscan radulae are produced one after the other by the same group of "factory" cells and therefore are almost identical. He also regarded lines running across the middle region of ''Odontogriphus'' fossils as evidence of external segmentation, since the lines are evenly spaced and run exactly at [[right angle]]s to the long axis of the body. As in his earlier papers, Butterfield emphasized the similarities of internal structure between ''Wiwaxia''’s sclerites and the bristles of polychaetes, and the fact that polychaetes are the only modern organisms in which some of the bristles form a covering over the back.&lt;ref name="Butterfield2006" /&gt;

In 2007 Conway Morris and Caron described a new fossil, ''[[Orthrozanclus]]'', which had a [[Biomineralization|mineralized]] shell like that of halkieriids, and unmineralized sclerites and long spines like those of ''Wiwaxia'' – and, like both of these, a soft underside which they interpreted as a muscular foot, and a similar arrangement of the sclerites into three [[concentric]] bands. Some of ''Orthrozanclus''’s sclerites appear to have been hollow, as the specimen includes what look like internal [[casting]]s. They took this find as evidence that the halkieriids, ''Wiwaxia'' and ''[[Orthrozanclus]]'' were very closely related and formed the group "halwaxiids". However the simplest "family tree" faces an obstacle: the siphogonuchitids appear in earlier rocks and had ''mineralized'' sclerites. Hence Conway Morris and Caron found it necessary to consider two more complex family trees, concluding that "Hypothesis 1" fitted the available data better, but fell apart if there were [[sensitivity analysis|minor changes]] in the characteristics used:&lt;ref name="ConwayMorrisCaron2007" /&gt;
#''Odontogriphus'', which had no sclerites or shells, was an "aunt" of the molluscs and the halwaxiids were a "sister" group to molluscs. ''Wiwaxia'', with only unmineralized armor, was a surviving member of the most primitive halwaxiids. The siphogonuchitids developed mineralized sclerites but grouped into a simpler "chain mail" arrangement. Halkieriids then regained the more complex three-band "chain mail" arrangement and also developed shells. ''Orthrozanclus'' lost one of the shells and its sclerites lost the mineralization. Because the siphogonuchitids appear in this family tree between ''Wiwaxia'' and the other halwaxiids, the halwaxiids are not [[monophyletic]] in this tree.&lt;ref name="ConwayMorrisCaron2007" /&gt;
#In "Hypothesis 2" the halwaxiids are [[monophyletic]] and the siphogonuchitids are their nearest non-halwaxiid relatives. The halwaxiids plus siphogonuchitids form a "sister" group to both the annelids and brachiopods, and the molluscs are the "aunts" of all of them.&lt;ref name="ConwayMorrisCaron2007" /&gt;

Conway Morris and Caron (2007) published the first description of ''[[Orthrozanclus]] reburrus''. This resembled the halkieriids in having concentric bands of sclerites, although only two and not mineralized; and ''one'' shell at what was presumed to be the front and which was similar in shape to ''Halkieria''’s front shell. It also had long spines rather like those of ''Wiwaxia''. Conway Morris and Caron regarded this creature as evidence that the "halwaxiids" were a valid [[taxon]] and were [[monophyletic]], in other words shared a common ancestor with each other and with no other organism. They published ''two'' cladograms, representing alternative hypotheses about the evolution of the [[lophotrochozoa]], the lineage that includes molluscs, annelids and brachiopods:&lt;ref name="ConwayMorrisCaron2007" /&gt;
# This is the more likely, although it falls apart if the organisms' characteristics are changed even slightly:&lt;ref name="ConwayMorrisCaron2007" /&gt;
#*''Kimberella'' and ''Odontogriphus'' are early, primitive molluscs, without sclerites or any kind of mineralized armor.
#*''Wiwaxia'', the siphogonotuchids, ''Orthrozanclus'' and ''Halkeria'' form a side-branch of the mollusc family tree, which diverged in that order. This would mean that: ''Wiwaxia'' was the first of them to have sclerites, which were unmineralized; the siphogonotuchids were the first to have mineralized sclerites, although the scleritome was simpler; halkieriids then develop more complex scleritomes, while in ''Orthrozanclus'' the scleritome became unmineralized again and the rear shell vanished or became so  small that it has not been seen in fossils. This hypothesis faces the difficulty that siphogonotuchids appear in earlier rocks and have simpler scleritomes than the other three groups.&lt;ref name="ConwayMorrisCaron2007" /&gt;
#*The annelids and brachiopods evolved from the other main branch of the family tree, which did not include the molluscs.
# The alternative view is:
#*''Kimberella'' and ''Odontogriphus'' are early, primitive lophotrochozoans.
#*The siphogonotuchids, ''Halkeria'', ''Orthrozanclus'' and ''Wiwaxia'' form a group that is closer to the shared ancestor of annelids and brachiopods than it is to the molluscs. The siphogonotuchids are the first of the group to become distinctive, with ''two'' types of mineralized sclerites and a "shell" made of fused sclerites. Halkieriids had three types of sclerites  and two one-piece shells. In ''Orthrozanclus'' the sclerites became unmineralized and in ''Wiwaxia'' the shells were lost.&lt;ref name="ConwayMorrisCaron2007" /&gt;

==Halkieriids and siphogonotuchids==
{{further|Halkieriid}}
Most of the debate has been about halkieriids' relationship to [[mollusc]]s, [[annelid]]s and [[brachiopod]]s. However a paper published in 2008 argued that halkieriids were closely related to [[chancelloriidae|chancelloriid]]s, which have been generally regarded as [[sponge]]s.

===Relationship to Molluscs, Annelids and Brachiopods===
Halkieriid [[sclerite]]s were known for a long time as elements of the [[small shelly fossils]]. The first articulated specimens, with all their hard parts together, were collected in 1989 and were described briefly in 1990 by Conway Morris and Peel (1990).&lt;ref name="ConwayMorrisPeel1990"&gt;{{ cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same authors produced a more detailed analysis in 1995, which divided the halkieriids into three groups: one as "aunts" of [[brachiopod]]s, animals whose modern forms have bivalve shells but differ from molluscs in having muscular stalks and a distinctive feeding apparatus, the [[lophophore]]; the second group of halkieriids as "aunts" of both ''[[Wiwaxia]]'' and annelid worms; and the earliest halkieriids as "great aunts" of all of these.&lt;ref name="ConwayMorrisPeel1995" /&gt;

In 2003 Cohen, Holmer and Luter supported the halkieriid-brachiopod relationship, suggesting that brachiopods may have arisen from a halkieriid lineage that developed a shorter body and larger shells, and then folded itself and finally grew a stalk out of what used to be the back.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal

Vinther and Nielsen (2005) proposed instead that ''Halkieria'' was a [[crown group]] mollusc, in other words more similar to modern molluscs than to annelids, brachiopods or any intermediate groups. They argued that: ''Halkieria''’s sclerites resembled those of the modern [[solenogaster]] [[aplacophora]]n shell-less molluscs, of some modern [[polyplacophora]]n molluscs, which have several shell plates, and of the [[Ordovician]] polyplacophoran ''[[Echinochiton]]''; ''Halkieria''’s shells are more similar to the shells of [[conchifera]]n molluscs, since shells of both of these groups show no trace of the canals and pores seen in polyplacophoran shell plates; the bristles of brachiopods and annelids are similar to each other but not to ''Halkieria''’s sclerites.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal

However Conway Morris (2006) criticized Vinther and Nielsen's classification of ''Halkieria'' as a crown group mollusc, on the grounds that the growth of the spicules in the aplacophorans and polyplacophorans is not similar to the method of growth deduced for the complex halkieriid sclerites; in particular, he said, the hollow spines of various molluscs are not at all like the halkieriid sclerites with their complex internal channels. Conway Morris repeated his earlier conclusion that halkieriids were close to the ancestors of both molluscs and brachiopods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In their description of the newly discovered ''[[Orthrozanclus]]'' (2007), which has similarities to both ''Wiwaxia'' and the halkieriids, Conway Morris and Caron also took account of the siphogonuchitids, a group known only from isolated mineralized sclerites that resemble those of the halkieriids. They proposed the two "family trees" described above:
# The halkieriids formed part of a "sister" group to the molluscs.  This hypothesis implies that the halwaxiids were not [[monophyletic]], since the siphogonuchitids appear between ''Wiwaxia'' and the halkieriids. Nevertheless, Conway Morris and Caron found that this [[phylogeny]] fitted the available data better, although it was not robust.
# The siphogonuchitids plus the halwaxiids formed a "sister" group to the annelids and brachiopods, while the molluscs were "aunts" of all of these.&lt;ref name="ConwayMorrisCaron2007" /&gt;

===Relationship to chancelloriids===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Chancelloriid scleritomes 01.png| thumb | right | 250px | [[Chancelloriidae|Chancelloriid]] [[sclerite|scleritomes]] ]] --&gt;
Porter (2008) revived an early 1980s idea that the sclerites of ''Halkieria'' are extremely similar to those of [[chancelloriidae|chancelloriid]]s. These were sessile, bag-like, [[Radial symmetry#Radial symmetry|radially symmetric]] organisms with an opening at the top.&lt;ref name="Porter2008ChancelloriidsHalkieriids" /&gt;

Since their fossils show no signs of a gut or other organs, chancelloriids were originally classified as some kind of [[sponge]]. Butterfield and Nicholas (1996) argued that they were closely related to sponges on the grounds that the detailed structure of chancellorid sclerites is similar to that of fibers of [[spongin]], a [[collagen]] [[protein]], in  modern keratose (horny) [[demosponge]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal

| issue=6
}}&lt;/ref&gt; However Janussen, Steiner and Zhu (2002) opposed this view on several grounds, including that: the [[silica]]-based spines of demosponges are solid, while chancellorid sclerites are hollow, probably made of [[aragonite]], and filled with soft tissues connected to the rest of the animal at the bases of the sclerites; sponges have loosely bound-together skins called [[pinacoderm]]s, which are only one cell thick, while the skins of chancellorids were much thicker and show signs of connective structures called belt [[desmosome]]s. In their opinion the presence of belt desmosomes made chancellorids members of the [[Epitheliazoa]], the next higher [[taxon]] above the [[Porifera]], to which sponges belong. They thought it was difficult to say whether chancellorids were members of the [[Eumetazoa]], "true animals" whose tissues are organized into [[Germ layer]]s: chancellorids' lack of internal organs would seem to exclude them from the Eumetazoa; but possibly chancellorids were descended from Eumetazoans that lost these features after becoming [[Sessility (zoology)|sessile]] [[filter feeder|filter-feeders]].&lt;ref name="JanussenSteinerZhu2002"&gt;{{ cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sclerites of halkieriids and chancelloriids resemble each other at all levels: both have an internal "pulp cavity" and a thin external organic layer; the walls are made of the same material, [[aragonite]]; the arrangement of the aragonite fibers in each is the same, running mainly from base to tip but with each being closer to the surface at the end nearest the tip. It is extremely improbable that totally unrelated organisms could have developed such similar sclerites independently, but the huge difference in the structures of their bodies makes it hard to see how they could be closely related. This dilemma may be resolved in various ways:&lt;ref name="Porter2008ChancelloriidsHalkieriids"&gt;{{ cite journal

* One possibility is that chancelloriids evolved from [[bilaterian]] ancestors but then adopted a sessile lifestyle and rapidly lost all unnecessary features. However the gut and other internal organs have not been lost in other bilaterians that lost their external bilateral symmetry, such as [[echinoderm]]s, [[priapulid]]s, and [[kinorhynch]]s.&lt;ref name="Porter2008ChancelloriidsHalkieriids" /&gt;
* On the other hand, perhaps chancelloriids are similar to the organisms from which bilaterians evolved. That would imply that the earliest bilaterians had similar sclerites. However, there are no fossils of such sclerites before {{ma|542}}, while ''[[Kimberella]]'' from {{ma|555}} was almost certainly a bilaterian,&lt;ref name="Fedonkin1997"&gt;{{cite journal

* One solution to this [[dilemma]] may be that preservation of [[small shelly fossils]] by coatings of [[phosphate]] was common only  for a relatively short time, during the Early Cambrian, and that coelosclerite-bearing organisms were alive several million years before and after the time of phosphatic preservation. In fact there are over 25 cases of phosphatic preservation between {{ma|542}} and {{ma|521}}, but only one between {{ma|555}} and {{ma|542}}.&lt;ref name="Porter2008ChancelloriidsHalkieriids" /&gt;
* Alternatively, perhaps the common ancestor of both chancelloriids and halkieriids had very similar but unmineralized coelosclerites, and some intermediate groups independently incorporated aragonite into these very similar structures.&lt;ref name="Porter2008ChancelloriidsHalkieriids" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ Citation

As a family they would rotate three times a year to their homes and workstations in Alta, Utah, where they spent winters and [http://www.lachapellelegacy.org/David.html Randy/David] was homeschooled; the Olympic Mountains [[Blue Glacier]] Washington, where they spent summers; and  [[Kirkland, Washington]]. Dolores and Ed moved to [[Silverton, Colorado]] in 1973 initially because it was here that Ed carried out [[avalanche research]]. Later they would separate though they maintained their friendship and professional literary companionship. Ed set up life in Alaska.  Dolores, however, enjoyed the [[San Juan Mountains]]  in southwestern Colorado, the rest of her life.  She operated "Way of the Mountain center" from her home&lt;ref name=Fox/&gt; publishing, writing, teaching, skiing, sharing ceremony and music.

Dolores was first and foremost a philosopher and researcher. The extent of her research spanned a complex set of topics, which she tracked in a vast library of books and articles. She noted and cross-referenced every text in such a tight web of interrelated material that she would eventually include in her collection, over a dozen thick and hand-typed, three-ring binder compendiums linking it all together. This rare body of research includes hundreds of biographical files chronicling a rich lifetime of mountain climbs, as she climbed all [[Fourteener|14K]] (above 14,000 feet) mountains of [[Rocky Mountains|Colorado Rockies]] by age 20, letter correspondence with authors and poets such as [[Gary Snyder]] and [[Art Goodtimes]] and her overlapping years married to pioneering avalanche and snow scientist Ed LaChapelle. This body of wisdom was stored in [[Silverton, Colorado|Silverton]] awaiting the opportunity for better archiving and accessibility until July 2011 when the collection's steward, Ananda Foley, (equivalent of Dolores' daughter-in-law) arranged a proper home for this unique collection with [http://aspennature.org/about-aces Aspen Center for Environmental Studies]. Ananda has organized the biographical materials and stories of the LaChapelle lives. A posting of this project can be found at the [http://www.lachapellelegacy.org/Mntn-Film.html LaChapelle Legacy website]. She looks forward to hearing from persons interested in participating in this biographical project (info current as of July 2012).

In 2004 Dolores LaChapelle received the "Ski History Maker" award from the [[University of Utah]] as one of the ten women who figured most prominently in the history of skiing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Women who helped shape ski industry honored at U. ceremony |work=[[The Salt Lake Tribune]] |date=October 25, 2004 |page=C6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Of all the women in her field to receive this award, she was the "only back-country skier in the bunch", according to her close friend Peter.

LaChapelle died on January 21, 2007 after an enjoyable evening of Copper River salmon supper with [https://www.amazon.com/Raised-Rabbit-David-Lynn-Grimes/dp/B001F0TOCY David Grimes] who said they enjoying singing "[[Goodnight, Irene|Goodnight Irene, Goodnight]]" before she turned in for bed. Just before closing her door, she said to him "what a great song that is, isn't it?"

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19672">'''Ecological interface design''' ('''EID''') is an approach to [[user interface|interface]] design that was introduced specifically for complex sociotechnical, real-time, and dynamic systems. It has been applied in a variety of domains including [[process control]] (e.g. [[nuclear power plant]]s, petrochemical plants), [[aviation]], and [[medicine]].

EID differs from some interface design methodologies like [[user-centered design|User-Centered Design (UCD)]] in that the focus of the analysis is on the work domain or environment, rather than on the end user or a specific task. 

The goal of EID is to make constraints and complex relationships in the work environment perceptually evident (e.g. visible, audible) to the user.  This allows more of users' cognitive resources to be devoted to higher [[cognitive process]]es such as problem solving and decision making.  EID is based on two key concepts from [[cognitive engineering]] research: the Abstraction Hierarchy (AH) and the Skills, Rules, Knowledge (SRK) framework.

By reducing mental workload and supporting knowledge-based reasoning, EID aims to improve user performance and overall system reliability for both anticipated and unanticipated events in a complex system.

==Overview==
===Origin and history of EID===
Ecological interface design was proposed as a framework for interface design by [[Kim Vicente]] and [[Jens Rasmussen (human factors expert)|Jens Rasmussen]] in the late 80s and early 90s following extensive research into [[human reliability|human-system reliability]] at the [[Risø National Laboratory]] in Denmark (Rasmussen &amp; Vicente ''et al'', 1989; Vicente, 2001). The term ecological in EID originates from a school of psychology developed by [[J. J. Gibson|James J. Gibson]] known as [[ecological psychology]]. This field of psychology focuses on human-environment relationships, in particular in relation to human perception in actual environments rather than in laboratory environments. EID borrows from ecological psychology in that the constraints and relationships of the work environment in a complex system are reflected perceptually (through an interface) in order to shape user behaviour. In order to develop ecological designs, analytical tools developed earlier by researchers at the Risø National Laboratory were adopted, including the Abstraction Hierarchy (AH) and the Skills, Rules, Knowledge (SRK) framework. The EID framework was first applied and evaluated in nuclear power plant systems (Vicente &amp; Rasmussen, 1990, 1992). These tools are also used in [[Cognitive work analysis]]. To date, EID has been applied in a variety of complex systems including computer network management, anaesthesiology, military command and control, and aircraft (Vicente, 2002; Burns &amp; Hajdukiewicz, 2004).

===Motivation===
Rapid advances in technologies along with economic demands have led to a noticeable increase in the complexity of engineering systems (Vicente, 1999a). As a result, it is becoming more and more difficult for designers to anticipate events that may occur within such systems. Unanticipated events by definition cannot be specified in advance and thus cannot be prevented through training, procedures, or automation. A complex sociotechnical system designed based solely on known scenarios frequently loses the flexibility to support unforeseen events. System safety is often compromised by the operators’ inability to adapt to new and unfamiliar situations (Vicente &amp; Rasmussen, 1992). Ecological interface design attempts to provide the operators with the necessary tools and information to become active problem solvers as opposed to passive monitors, particularly during the development of unforeseen events. Interfaces designed following the EID framework aim to lessen [[mental workload]] when dealing with unfamiliar and unanticipated events, which are attributed to increased psychological pressure (Vicente, 1999b). In doing so, cognitive resources may be freed up to support efficient problem solving.

In addition to providing operators with the means to successfully manage unanticipated events, EID is also proposed for systems that require users to become experts (Burns &amp; Hajdukiewicz, 2004). Through the use of the Abstraction Hierarchy (AH) and the Skills, Rules, Knowledge (SRK) framework, EID enables novice users to more easily acquire advanced [[mental model]]s that generally take many years of experience and training to develop. Likewise, EID provides a basis for continuous learning and distributed, collaborative work (Vicente, 1999b). When faced with complex sociotechnical systems, it is not always possible for designers to ask operators what kinds of information they would like to see since each person understands the system at a different level (but rarely fully) and will provide very different answers. The EID framework allows designers to determine what kinds of information are required when it is not possible or feasible to ask users (Burns &amp; Hajdukiewicz, 2004). It is not the intention of EID to replace existing design methodologies such as UCD and [[task analysis]], but to complement them.

==UCD and EID: Why use EID at all?==

As we can see from today’s windows based interfaces User-Centered Design (UCD) has done an excellent job of identifying user preferences and limitations and incorporating them into the interfaces. In the pre-UCD era, interface design was almost an afterthought to a program and was completely dependent on the programmers while totally neglecting the end user. 

===Benefits of UCD===
UCD adds three key ideas:

1.	That Interface Design is a field on its own because it bridges between humans and the program/environment.

2.	That an understanding of human perception, cognition, and behavior is critical to designing interfaces.

3.	That much can be learned by getting feedback from the actual users of the interface, at the early design stages, and then testing through various points in the design (Burns &amp; Hajdukiewicz, 2004)

But there are some problems in this approach as well. 

===How is EID relevant?===
The UCD approach commonly focuses on single user interactions between the user and the interface which is not enough to deal with today’s increasingly complex systems where centralized control of information is needed and it is displayed on a variety of interfaces in varying detail. EID is a preferable addition to the complex systems’ design process when even very experienced users do not have a complete understanding of how the entire complex system (power plant, nuclear plant, petrochemical refinery etc.) works. It is a known fact{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} that users don’t always understand or even feel the need to understand all the relationships behind the complex processes that they control via their interfaces. 

Furthermore, the users are not always aware of the constraints that affect the system that they work with, and discovering these constraints can take some extra effort (Burns &amp; Hajdukiewicz, 2004). EID incorporates this constraint based style in the design approach where it examines the constraints of the user domain before getting user input. EID focuses on understanding the complex system – its build, its architecture, and its original intent and then relaying this information to the end user thereby reducing their learning curve and helping them achieve higher level of expertise.  

The constraint based style in interface design also facilitates the handling of unanticipated events because, regardless of the event, the constraint is broken and it can be seen by the user who in turn can proactively work with the interface to restore the constraint and fix the system. 

This does not in any way take away the usefulness of UCD but stresses the fact that EID offers some unique insight into the design process and it could be used in conjunction with other cognitive engineering techniques to enhance the user interfaces and increase human reliability in human-machine interactions.

==The abstraction hierarchy (AH)==
The abstraction hierarchy (AH) is a 5-level functional decomposition used for modelling the work environment, or more commonly referred to as the work domain, for complex sociotechnical systems (Rasmussen, 1985). In the EID framework, the AH is used to determine what kinds of information should be displayed on the system interface and how the information should be arranged. The AH describes a system at different levels of abstraction using how and why relationships. Moving down the model levels answers how certain elements in the system are achieved, whereas moving up reveals why certain elements exist. Elements at highest level of the model define the purposes and goals of the system. Elements at the lowest levels of the model indicate and describe the physical components (i.e. equipment) of the system. The how and why relationships are shown on the AH as means-ends links. An AH is typically developed following a systematic approach known as a [[Work domain analysis|Work Domain Analysis]] (Vicente, 1999a). It is not uncommon for a Work Domain Analysis to yield multiple AH models; each examining the system at a different level of physical detail defined using another model called the Part-Whole Hierarchy (Burns &amp; Hajdukiewicz, 2004).

Each level in the AH is a complete but unique description of the work domain.

===Functional purpose===
The functional purpose (FP) level describes the goals and purposes of the system. An AH typically includes more than one system goal such that the goals conflict or complement each other (Burns &amp; Hajdukiewicz, 2004). The relationships between the goals indicate potential trade-offs and constraints within the work domain of the system. For example, the goals of a [[refrigerator]] might be to cool food to a certain temperature while using a minimal amount of electricity.

===Abstract function===
The abstract function (AF) level describes the underlying laws and principles that govern the goals of the system. These may be [[law (principle)|empirical laws]] in a physical system, [[law|judicial laws]] in a social system, or even [[economics|economic principles]] in a commercial system. In general, the laws and principles focus on things that need to be conserved or that flow through the system such as mass (Burns &amp; Hajdukiewicz, 2004). The operation of the refrigerator (as a [[heat pump]]) is governed by the [[second law of thermodynamics]].

===Generalised function===
The generalised function (GF) level explains the processes involved in the laws and principles found at the AF level, i.e. how each abstract function is achieved. Causal relationships exist between the elements found at the GF level. The [[refrigeration cycle]] in a refrigerator involves pumping heat from an area of low temperature (source) into an area of higher temperature (sink).

===Physical function===
The physical function (PFn) level reveals the physical components or equipment associated with the processes identified at the GF level. The capabilities and limitations of the components such as maximum capacity are also usually noted in the AH (Burns &amp; Hajdukiewicz, 2004). A refrigerator may consist of heat exchange pipes and a [[gas compressor]] that can exert a certain maximum pressure on the cooling medium.

===Physical form===
The physical form (PFo) level describes the condition, location, and physical appearance of the components shown at the PFn level. In the refrigerator example, the heat exchange pipes and the gas compressor are arranged in a specific manner, basically illustrating the location of the components. Physical characteristics may include things as colour, dimensions, and shape.

==Causal Abstraction Hierarchy==

The hierarchy described before is a ''functional'' Abstraction Hierarchy representation. A ''functional'' Abstraction Hierarchy emphasizes the "means-ends" or "how/why" links of the hierarchy. These connections are direct and illustrated across the five levels of the Abstraction Hierarchy. 

As the systems get more and more complex, we need to follow the flow structure as well as to understand how the system works. This is when a ''causal'' Abstraction Hierarchy representation becomes necessary. As the flow patterns become increasingly complex and it becomes increasingly difficult to derive the flows directly from the system diagram, we add causal models to the functional models.

The causal models help to detail the flow structure and understand more complex flow patterns within a specified Abstraction Hierarchy level. A ''causal'' Abstraction Hierarchy representation has the same structure as a ''functional'' Abstraction Hierarchy representation but with causal links drawn. Causal links are also known as "within the level" links. These links show how the processes and flows are connected within each level. 

The two representations are closely related but are usually developed separately because doing so results in a clearer model which captures most of the system constraints. 

In very elaborate flow systems causal models can be used to simplify or abstract the flows. In such a scenario we may find it easier to identify the main feed and product lines at first, then control lines, emergency supply lines, or emergency shunting lines (Burns &amp; Hajdukiewicz, 2004). Causal links are most useful at the Generalized Function and the Abstract Function levels which show flows of materials, processes, mass, or energy.

==The Skills, Rules, Knowledge (SRK) framework==
The Skills, Rules, Knowledge (SRK) framework or SRK taxonomy defines three types of behaviour or psychological processes present in operator information processing (Vicente, 1999a). The SRK framework was developed by [[Jens Rasmussen (human factors expert)|Rasmussen]] (1983) to help designers combine information requirements for a system and aspects of human cognition. In EID, the SRK framework is used to determine how information should be displayed to take advantage of human perception and psychomotor abilities (Vicente, 1999b). By supporting skill- and rule-based behaviours in familiar tasks, more cognitive resources may be devoted to knowledge-based behaviours, which are important for managing unanticipated events. The three categories essentially describe the possible ways in which information, for example, from a human-machine interface is extracted and understood:

===Skill-based level===
A skill-based behaviour represents a type of behaviour that requires very little or no conscious control to perform or execute an action once an intention is formed; also known as a [[Piaget's theory of cognitive development|sensorimotor behaviour]]. Performance is smooth, automated, and consists of highly integrated patterns of behaviour in most skill-based control (Rasmussen, 1990). For example, bicycle riding is considered a skill-based behaviour in which very little attention is required for control once the skill is acquired. This [[automaticity]] allows operators to free up cognitive resources, which can then be used for higher cognitive functions like problem solving (Wickens &amp; Hollands, 2000).

===Rule-based level===
A rule-based behaviour is characterised by the use of rules and procedures to select a course of action in a familiar work situation (Rasmussen, 1990). The rules can be a set of instructions acquired by the operator through experience or given by supervisors and former operators.

Operators are not required to know the underlying principles of a system, to perform a rule-based control. For example, hospitals have highly-proceduralised instructions for fire emergencies. Therefore, when one sees a fire, one can follow the necessary steps to ensure the safety of the patients without any knowledge of fire behaviour.

===Knowledge-based level===
A knowledge-based behaviour represents a more advanced level of reasoning (Wirstad, 1988). This type of control must be employed when the situation is novel and unexpected. Operators are required to know the fundamental principles and laws by which the system is governed. Since operators need to form explicit goals based on their current analysis of the system, cognitive workload is typically greater than when using skill- or rule-based behaviours.

In [[astronomy]] and [[celestial navigation]], an '''ephemeris''' (plural: '''ephemerides'''; {{ety|la|ephemeris|diary}}, {{ety|gre|''εφημερίς'' (ephemeris)|diary, journal}}{{sfn|ephemeris|1992}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://perseus.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.27:9:113.LSJ|title=Liddell &amp; Scott Dictionary on Perseus at University of Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ephemeris|title=Dictionary − ephemeris|publisher=[[Merriam-Webster]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ephemeris|url=http://www.lexilogos.com/latin/gaffiot.php?q=ephemeris|work=Dictionnaire Gaffiot latin-français}}&lt;/ref&gt;) gives the positions of naturally occurring [[astronomical objects]] as well as [[artificial satellites]] in the [[sky]] at a given [[time]] or times. Historically, positions were given as printed [[table (information)|table]]s of [[quantity|values]], given at regular intervals of date and time. Modern ephemerides are often computed electronically from mathematical models of the motion of astronomical objects and the Earth. Even though the calculation of these tables was one of the [[history of computing|first applications of mechanical computers]], printed ephemerides are still produced, as they are useful when computational devices are not available.

The astronomical position calculated from an ephemeris is given in the [[Spherical coordinate system|spherical polar coordinate system]] of [[right ascension]] and [[declination]]. Some of the astronomical phenomena of interest to astronomers are [[eclipse]]s, [[apparent retrograde motion]]/planetary stations, planetary {{linktext|ingress}}es, [[sidereal time]], positions for the mean and true [[Lunar node|nodes of the moon]], the [[phases of the Moon]], and the positions of minor [[celestial bodies]] such as [[2060 Chiron|Chiron]].

Ephemerides are used in celestial navigation and astronomy. They are also used by some [[astrologers]].

*13th century – the ''[[Alfonsine Tables]]'' were compiled in Spain to correct anomalies in the ''Tables of Toledo'', remaining the standard European ephemeris until the ''[[Prutenic Tables]]'' almost 300 years later.
*13th century AD - the ''[[Dresden Codex]]'', an extant Mayan ephemeris
*1408 – [[Chinese astronomy|Chinese]] ephemeris table (copy in [[Pepysian Library]], Cambridge, UK (refer book '1434'); Chinese tables believed known to [[Regiomontanus]]).
*1496 – the ''Almanach Perpetuum'' of [[Abraham Zacuto|Abraão ben Samuel Zacuto]] (one of the first books published  with a [[movable type]] and [[printing press]] in [[Portugal]])
*1504 – While shipwrecked on the island of Jamaica, [[Christopher Columbus]] successfully predicted a lunar eclipse for the natives, using the ephemeris of the German astronomer [[Regiomontanus]].
*1531 – Work of [[Johannes Stöffler]] is published posthumously at Tübingen, extending the ephemeris of Regiomontanus through 1551.
*1551 – the ''[[Prutenic Tables]]'' of [[Erasmus Reinhold]] were published, based on [[Copernicus]]'s theories.
*1554 – [[Johannes Stadius]] published ''Ephemerides novae et auctae'', the first major ephemeris computed according to Copernicus' [[heliocentric model]], using parameters derived from the ''[[Prutenic Tables]]''.  Although the Copernican model provided an elegant solution to the problem of computing apparent planetary positions (it avoided the need for the [[equant]] and better explained the [[apparent retrograde motion]] of planets), it still relied on the use of [[epicycles]], leading to some inaccuracies – for example, periodic errors in the position of Mercury of up to ten degrees.  One of the users of Stadius's tables is [[Tycho Brahe]].
*1627 – the ''[[Rudolphine Tables]]'' of [[Johannes Kepler]] based on elliptical planetary motion became the new standard.
*1679 – ''La [[Connaissance des Temps]] ou calendrier et éphémérides du lever &amp; coucher du Soleil, de la Lune &amp; des autres planètes'', first published yearly by [[Jean Picard]] and still extant.
*1975 – [[Owen Gingerich]], using modern planetary theory and digital computers, calculates the actual positions of the planets in the 16th Century and graphs the errors in the planetary positions predicted by the ephemerides of Stöffler, Stadius and others. According to Gingerich, the error patterns "are as distinctive as fingerprints and reflect the characteristics of the underlying tables.  That is, the error patterns for Stöffler are different from those of Stadius, but the error patterns of Stadius closely resemble those of [[Maestlin]], [[Giovanni Antonio Magini|Magini]], [[David Origanus|Origanus]], and others who followed the Copernican parameters."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gingerich |first=Owen |date=1975 |title="Crisis" versus Aesthetic in the Copernican Revolution |url=https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/4258973/Crisis%20vs%20Aesthetic%20OGingrich.pdf |journal=Vistas in Astronomy |publisher=[[Elsevier BV]] |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=85–95 |access-date=23 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern ephemeris ==
For scientific uses, a modern planetary ephemeris comprises software that generates positions of planets and often of their satellites, [[asteroid]]s, or [[comet]]s, at virtually any time desired by the user.

Typically, such ephemerides cover several centuries, past and future; the future ones can be covered because the field of [[celestial mechanics]] has developed several accurate theories. Nevertheless, there are [[Secular variation|secular phenomena]] which cannot adequately be considered by ephemerides. The greatest uncertainties in the positions of planets are caused by the perturbations of numerous [[asteroid]]s, most of whose masses and orbits are poorly known, rendering their effect uncertain. Reflecting the continuing influx of new data and observations, [[NASA]]'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory ([[JPL]]) has revised its [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory Development Ephemeris|published ephemerides]] nearly every year for the past 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;[[Georgij A. Krasinsky]] and [[Victor A. Brumberg]], ''Secular Increase of Astronomical Unit from Analysis of the Major Planet Motions, and its Interpretation'' [http://iau-comm4.jpl.nasa.gov/GAKVAB.pdf Celestial Mechanics and Dynamical Astronomy 90: 267–288, (2004)].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Solar system]] ephemerides are essential for the navigation of [[spacecraft]] and for all kinds of space observations of the [[planet]]s, their [[natural satellite]]s, [[star]]s, and [[Galaxy|galaxies]].

Scientific ephemerides for sky observers mostly contain the positions of celestial bodies in [[right ascension]] and [[declination]], because these coordinates are the most frequently used on star maps and telescopes. The [[Equinox (celestial coordinates)|equinox]] of the coordinate system must be given. It is, in nearly all cases, either the actual equinox (the equinox valid for that moment, often referred to as "of date" or "current"), or that of one of the "standard" equinoxes, typically [[J2000.0]], [[B1950.0]], or J1900. Star maps almost always use one of the standard equinoxes.

Scientific ephemerides often contain further useful data about the moon, planet, asteroid, or comet beyond the pure coordinates in the sky, such as elongation to the sun, brightness, distance, velocity, apparent diameter in the sky, phase angle, times of rise, transit, and set, etc.
Ephemerides of the planet [[Saturn]] also sometimes contain the apparent inclination of its ring.

[[Celestial navigation]] serves as a backup to the [[Global Positioning System]]. Software is widely available to assist with this form of navigation; some of this software has a self-contained ephemeris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = American Practical Navigator: An Epitiome of Navigation | date = 2002 | page = 270 | publisher = National Imagery and Mapping Agency | location = Bethesda, MD | url = http://msi.nga.mil/NGAPortal/MSI.portal?_nfpb=true&amp;_pageLabel=msi_portal_page_62&amp;pubCode=0002}}&lt;/ref&gt; When software is used that does not contain an ephemeris, or if no software is used, position data for celestial objects may be obtained from the modern ''[[Nautical Almanac]]'' or ''Air Almanac''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Almanacs and Other Publications — Naval Oceanography Portal| accessdate = 11 November 2016| url = http://www.usno.navy.mil/USNO/astronomical-applications/publications | publisher = [[United States Naval Observatory]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An ephemeris is usually only correct for a particular location on the Earth. In many cases, the differences are too small to matter. However, for nearby [[asteroid]]s or the [[Moon]], they can be quite important.

[[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) navigation satellites transmit electronic ephemeris data consisting of health and exact location data. A GPS receiver can use the transmissions from multiple such satellites to calculate its own location using [[trilateration]].

Other modern ephemerides recently created are the EPM (Ephemerides of Planets and the Moon), from the Russian Institute for Applied Astronomy of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pitjeva|first=Elena V.|title=The dynamical model of the planet motions and EPM ephemerides|journal=Highlights of Astronomy|date=August 2006|volume=14|pages=470|doi=10.1017/S1743921307011453|bibcode=2007HiA....14..470P}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the INPOP (''{{lang|fr|Intégrateur numérique planétaire de l'[[Observatoire de Paris]]}}'') by the French [[IMCCE]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=INPOP10e, a 4-D planetary ephemeris|url=http://www.imcce.fr/inpop/|publisher=IMCCE|accessdate=2 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fall protection allows his men to go home at the end of the day.webm|thumb|A video on the value of fall protection measures]]
'''Fall protection''' is the use of controls designed to protect personnel from [[Falling (accident)|falling]] or in the event they do fall, to stop them without causing severe injury. Typically, fall protection is implemented when working at height, but may be relevant when working near any edge, such as near a pit or hole, or performing work on a steep surface.

There are four generally accepted categories of fall protection: fall elimination, fall prevention, [[fall arrest]] and administrative controls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ellis|first1=J. Nigel|title=Introduction to fall protection|date=2011|publisher=[[American Society of Safety Engineers]]|isbn=9781885581587|page=28|edition=4th}}&lt;!--|accessdate=24 March 2016--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the US Department of Labor, falls account for 8% of all work-related trauma injuries leading to death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bickrest|first1=Ed|title=Fall Protection: Failure is Not an Option|url=http://ehstoday.com/ppe/fall-protection/falls-remain-occupational-hazard-0309|website=EHS Today|accessdate=24 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Federal statutes, standards and regulations in the United States pertaining to the requirements for employers to provide fall protection are administered by [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Duty to have fall protection. 1926.501|url=https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=STANDARDS&amp;p_id=10757|website=Occupational Safety &amp; Health Administration|publisher=United States Dept. of Labor|accessdate=30 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Falls in the workplace ==
Falls from elevations were the fourth leading cause of workplace death from 1980 through 1994, with an average of 540 deaths per year accounting for 10% of all occupational fatalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2000-116/|title=Worker Deaths by Falls: A Summary of Surveillance Findings and Investigative Case Reports|last=|first=|date=|website=U.S. [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]]|page=xi|language=en-us|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Falls are a concern for oil and gas workers, many of whom must work high on a [[derrick]].  A study of falls over the period 2005–2014 found that in 86% of fatal falls studied, fall protection was required by regulation, but it was not used, was used improperly, or the equipment failed.  Many of the fatalities were because, although the workers were wearing harnesses, they neglected to attach them to an anchor point.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mason|first=Krystal L.|last2=Retzer|first2=Kyla D.|last3=Hill|first3=Ryan|last4=Lincoln|first4=Jennifer M.|date=2017-01-01|title=Occupational Fatalities Resulting from Falls in the Oil and Gas Extraction Industry, United States, 2005–2014|url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/66/wr/mm6616a2.htm|journal=[[Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report]]|language=en-us|volume=66|issue=16|pages=417–421|doi=10.15585/mmwr.mm6616a2|issn=0149-2195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of fall protection ==
In most work-at-height environments, multiple fall protection measures are used concurrently.

=== Fall elimination ===
Fall [[Hazard elimination|elimination]] is often the preferred way of providing fall protection.  This entails finding ways of completing tasks without working at heights.

=== Fall prevention ===
{{main|Fall prevention}}
* Fall guarding is the use of guard rails or other barricades to prevent a person from falling. These barricades are placed near an edge where a fall-hazard can occur, or to surround a weak surface (such as a skylight on a roof) which may break when stepped on.
* Fall restraint is a class of [[personal protective equipment]] to prevent persons who are in a fall hazard area from falling, e.g., fall restraint lanyards. Typically, fall restraint will physically prevent a worker from approaching an edge.

=== Fall arrest ===
{{main article|Fall arrest}}
Fall arrest is the form of fall protection that stops a person who has fallen.

=== Administrative controls ===
[[Administrative controls]] are used along with other measures, but they do not physically prevent a worker from going over an edge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fall Protection|url=https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=STANDARDS&amp;p_id=10758|website=United States Department of Labor|publisher=Occupational Safety and Health Administration|accessdate=24 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of administrative controls include placing a safety observer or warning line near an edge, or enforcing a safety policy which trains workers and requires them to adhere to other fall protection measures, or prohibiting any un-restrained worker from approaching an edge.

A '''heartbeat message''' in signal processing is a message sent from an originator to a destination that enables the destination to identify if and when the originator fails or is no longer available.&lt;ref name="att01"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.google.com/patents/about?id=gVQ3AAAAEBAJ |title=US Patent 4,710,926 |accessdate=2009-12-10 |author=Brown|date=1987-12-01|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Heartbeat messages are typically sent non-stop on a [[periodic_function|periodic]] or recurring basis from the originator's start-up until the originator's shutdown. When the destination identifies a lack of heartbeat messages during an anticipated arrival period, the destination may determine that the originator has failed, shutdown, or is generally no longer available.  Heartbeat messages may be used for [[high-availability]] and [[fault tolerance]] purposes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35228">The '''military funding of science''' has had a powerful transformative effect on the practice and products of [[scientific research]] since the early 20th century.  Particularly since [[World War I]], [[military technology|advanced science-based technologies]] have been viewed as essential elements of a successful military.

World War I is often called "the chemists’ war", both for the extensive [[Poison gas in World War I|use of poison gas]] and the importance of [[nitrates]] and advanced [[high explosive]]s.   Poison gas, beginning in 1915 with [[chlorine]] from the powerful German dye industry, was used extensively by the Germans and the British ; over the course of the war, scientists on both sides raced to develop more and more potent chemicals and devise countermeasures against the newest enemy gases.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Robert and Jeremy Paxman.  ''A Higher Form of Killing: The Secret History of Chemical and Biological Warfare''.  2002.  Chapter 1.&lt;/ref&gt;  Physicists also contributed to the war effort, developing wireless communication technologies and sound-based methods of detecting [[U-boat]]s, resulting in the first tenuous long-term connections between academic science and the military.&lt;ref&gt;Kevles, Daniel J.  ''The Physicists: The History of a Scientific Community in Modern America''.  New York: Alfred K. Knopf, 1971. pp 137-138.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[World War II]] marked a massive increase in the military funding of science, particularly physics.  In addition to the [[Manhattan Project]] and the resulting [[nuclear weapon|atomic bomb]], British and American work on [[radar]] was widespread and ultimately highly influential in the course of the war; radar enabled detection of enemy ships and aircraft, as well as the radar-based [[proximity fuze]].  Mathematical [[cryptography]], [[meteorology]], and [[aerospace engineering|rocket science]] were also central to the war effort, with military-funded wartime advances having a significant long-term effect on each discipline.  The technologies employed at the end&amp;mdash;[[jet aircraft]], radar and proximity fuzes, and the atomic bomb&amp;mdash;were radically different from pre-war technology; military leaders came to view continued advances in technology as the critical element for success in future wars.  The advent of the [[Cold War]] solidified the links between military institutions and academic science, particularly in the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]], so that even during a period of nominal peace military funding continued to expand.  Funding spread to the [[social sciences]] as well as the [[natural sciences]], and whole new fields, such as [[digital computing]], were born of military patronage.  Following the [[Cold War (1985-1991)|end of the Cold War]] and the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], military funding of science has decreased substantially, but much of the American [[military-scientific complex]] remains in place.

The sheer scale of military funding for science since World War II has instigated a large body of historical literature analyzing the effects of that funding, especially for American science.  Since [[Paul Forman]]’s 1987 article “Behind quantum electronics: National security as a basis for physical research in the United State, 1940-1960,” there has been an ongoing historical debate over precisely how and to what extent military funding affected the course of scientific research and discovery.&lt;ref&gt;Forman, Paul.  "Behind quantum electronics: National security as basis for physical research in the United States, 1940-1960," ''Historical Studies in the Physical and Biological Sciences'', Vol. 18, Pt. 1, pp 149-229.&lt;/ref&gt;  Forman and others have argued that military funding fundamentally redirected science—particularly physics—toward applied research, and that military technologies predominantly formed the basis for subsequent research even in areas of basic science; ultimately the very culture and ideals of science were colored by extensive collaboration between scientists and military planners.  An alternate view has been presented by [[Daniel Kevles]], that while military funding provided many new opportunities for scientists and dramatically expanded the scope of physical research, scientists by-and-large retained their intellectual autonomy.

==Science and military technology before the modern era==
[[Image:Replica catapult.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Replica catapult at [[Château des Baux]], [[France]]]]
While there were numerous instances of military support for scientific work before the 20th century, these were typically isolated instances; knowledge gained from technology was generally far more important for the development of science than scientific knowledge was to technological innovation.&lt;ref&gt;Hacker, Barton C.  "The Machines of War: Western Military Technology 1850-2000."  ''History and Technology'', Vol. 21, No. 3, September 2005, pp 255-300.  p 255.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Thermodynamics]], for example, is a science partly born from military technology: one of the many sources of the [[first law of thermodynamics]] was [[Count Rumford]]’s observation of the heat produced by boring [[cannon]] barrels.&lt;ref&gt;von Baeyer, Hans Christian.  ''Warmth Disperses and Time Passes: The History of Heat''.  New York: The Modern Library, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;  Mathematics was important in the development of the Greek [[catapult]] and other weapons,&lt;ref&gt;Hacker, "The Machines of War," footnote 1.&lt;/ref&gt; but analysis of [[ballistics]] was also important for the development of mathematics, while [[Galileo]] tried to promote the telescope as a military instrument to the military-minded [[Republic of Venice]] before turning it to the skies while seeking the [[patronage]] of the [[Medici]] court in Florence.&lt;ref&gt;Biagioli, Mario.  ''Galileo, Courtier: The Practice of Science in the Culture of Absolutism''.  Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;  In general, craft-based innovation, disconnected from the formal systems of science, was the key to military technology well into the 19th century.

[[Image:Interchangeable parts.gif|thumb|left|200px|Interchangeable gun parts, illustrated in the 1832 ''Edinburgh Encyclopaedia'']]
Even craft-based military technologies were not generally produced by military funding.  Instead, craftsmen and inventors developed weapons and military tools independently and actively sought the interest of military patrons afterward.&lt;ref&gt;Hacker, "The Machines of War," p 256.&lt;/ref&gt;  Following the rise of [[engineering]] as a profession in the 18th century, governments and military leaders did try to harness the methods of both science and engineering for more specific ends, but frequently without success.   In the decades leading up to the [[French Revolution]], French artillery officers were often trained as engineers, and military leaders from this mathematical tradition attempted to transform the process of weapons manufacture from a craft-based enterprise to an organized and standardized system based on engineering principles and [[interchangeable parts]] (pre-dating the work of [[Eli Whitney]] in the U.S.).  During the Revolution, even natural scientists participated directly, attempting to create “weapons more powerful than any we possess” to aid the cause of the new French Republic, though there were no means for the revolutionary army to fund such work.&lt;ref&gt;Gillispie, Charles Coulston.  "Science and secret weapons development in Revolutionary France, 1792–1804."  ''Historical Studies in the Physical and Biological Sciences'', Vol. 23, No. 1, pp 35–152.  Quote from excerpt of [[Georges Cuvier]]’s eulogy of [[Claude-Louis Berthollet]], p 35.&lt;/ref&gt;  Each of these efforts, however, was ultimately unsuccessful in producing militarily useful results.  A slightly different outcome came from the longitude prize of the 18th century, offered by the British government for an accurate method of determining a ship’s [[longitude]] at sea (essential for the safe navigation of the powerful British navy): intended to promote—and financially reward—a scientific solution, it was instead won by a scientific outsider, the clockmaker [[John Harrison]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Sobel, Dava]].  ''[[Longitude: The True Story of a Lone Genius Who Solved the Greatest Scientific Problem of His Time]]''.  Penguin, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the naval utility of [[astronomy]] did help increase the number of capable astronomers and focus research on developing more powerful and versatile instruments.

Through the 19th century, science and technology grew closer together, particularly through electrical and acoustic inventions and the corresponding mathematical theories.  The late 19th and early 20th centuries witnessed a trend toward military mechanization, with the advent of repeating rifles with [[smokeless powder]], long-range artillery, [[high explosive]]s, [[machine gun]]s, and mechanized transport along with [[telegraph]]ic and later [[wireless telegraph|wireless]] battlefield communication.  Still, independent inventors, scientists and engineers were largely responsible for these drastic changes in military technology (with the exception of the development of [[battleship]]s, which could only have been created through organized large-scale effort).&lt;ref&gt;Hacker, “The Machines of War,” pp 256-257.&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War I and the interwar years==

[[World War I]] marked the first large-scale mobilization of science for military purposes.  Prior to the war, the American military ran a few small laboratories as well as the [[United States Bureau of Standards|Bureau of Standards]], but independent inventors and industrial firms predominated.&lt;ref&gt;Kevles, ''The Physicists'', pp 103-104.&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly in Europe, military-directed scientific research and development was minimal.  The powerful new technologies that led to [[trench warfare]], however, reversed the traditional advantage of fast-moving offensive tactics; fortified positions supported by machine guns and artillery resulted in high attrition but strategic stalemate.  Militaries turned to scientists and engineers for even newer technologies, but the introduction of [[tank]]s and [[aircraft]] had only a marginal impact; the [[Poison gas in World War I|use of poison gas]] made a tremendous psychological impact, but decisively favored neither side.  The war ultimately turned on maintaining adequate supplies of materials, a problem also addressed by military-funded science&amp;mdash;and, through the international chemical industry, closely related to the advent of chemical warfare.

The Germans introduced gas as a weapon in part because [[naval blockade]]s limited their supply of [[nitrate]] for explosives, while the massive German [[dye]] industry could easily produce [[chlorine]] and [[organic chemical]]s in large amounts.  Industrial capacity was completely mobilized for war, and [[Fritz Haber]] and other industrial scientists were eager to contribute to the German cause; soon they were closely integrated into the military hierarchy as they tested the most effective ways of producing and delivering weaponized chemicals.  Though the initial impetus for gas warfare came from outside the military, further developments in chemical weapon technology might be considered military-funded, considering the blurring of lines between industry and nation in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Harris and Paxman, ''A Higher Form of Killing'',  pp 11-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:British 55th Division gas casualties 10 April 1918.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Poison gas casualties from the [[Battle of Estaires]], April 10, 1918]]
Following the first chlorine attack by the Germans in May 1915, the British quickly moved to recruit scientists for developing their own gas weapons.  Gas research escalated on both sides, with chlorine followed by [[phosgene]], a variety of [[tear gas]]es, and [[mustard gas]].  A wide array of research was conducted on the physiological effects of other gases, such and [[hydrogen cyanide]], [[arsenic]] compounds, and a host of complex organic chemicals.  The British built from scratch what became an expansive research facility at [[Porton Down]], which remains a significant military research institution into the 21st century.  Unlike many earlier military-funded scientific ventures, the research at Porton Down did not stop when the war ended or an immediate goal was achieved.  In fact, every effort was made to create an attractive research environment for top scientists, and chemical weapons development continued apace&amp;mdash;though in secret&amp;mdash;through the interwar years and into World War II.  German military-backed gas warfare research did not resume until the Nazi era, following the 1936 discovery of [[tabun (nerve agent)|tabun]], the first nerve agent, through industrial [[insecticide]] research.

In the United States, the established tradition of engineering was explicitly competing with the rising discipline of physics for World War I military largess.  A host of inventors, led by [[Thomas Edison]] and his newly created [[Naval Consulting Board]], cranked out thousands of inventions to solve military problems and aid the war effort, while academic scientists worked through the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] (NRC) led by [[Robert Millikan]].  [[Submarine]] detection was the most important problem that both the physicists and inventors hoped to solve, as German [[U-boat]]s were decimating the crucial naval supply lines from the U.S. to England.  Edison’s Board produced very few useful innovations, but NRC research resulted in a moderately successful sound-based methods for locating submarines and hidden ground-based artillery, as well as useful navigational and photographic equipment for aircraft.  Because of the success of academic science in solving specific military problems, the NRC was retained after the war’s end, though it gradually decoupled from the military.&lt;ref&gt;Kevles, ''The Physicists'', pp 102-154&lt;/ref&gt;

Many industrial and academic chemists and physicists came under military control during the Great War, but post-war research by the Royal Engineers Experimental Station at Porton Down and the continued operation of the National Research Council were exceptions to the overall pattern; wartime chemistry funding was a temporary redirection of a field largely driven by industry and later medicine, while physics grew closer to industry than to the military.  The discipline of modern meteorology, however, was largely built from military funding.  During World War I, the French civilian meteorological infrastructure was largely absorbed into the military.  The introduction of military aircraft during the war as well as the role of wind and weather in the success or failure of gas attacks meant meteorological advice was in high demand.  The French army (among others) created its own supplementary meteorological service as well, retraining scientists from other fields to staff it.  At war's end, the military continued to control French meteorology, sending weathermen to French colonial interests and integrating weather service with the growing air corps; most of the early-twentieth century growth in European meteorology was the direct result of military funding.&lt;ref&gt;Pyenson, Lewis and Susan Sheets-Pyenson.  ''Servants of Nature: A History of Scientific Institutions, Enterprises, and Sensibilities''.  New York: HarperCollins Publishers, 1999.  pp 309-311.&lt;/ref&gt;   World War II would result in a similar transformation of American meteorology, initiating a transition from an [[apprenticeship]] system for training weathermen (based on intimate knowledge of local trends and geography) to the university-based, science-intensive system that has predominated since.

==World War II==
{{see also|Technology during World War II}}
If World War I was the chemists’ war, World War II was the physicists’ war.  As with other [[total war]]s, it is difficult to draw a line between military funding and more spontaneous military-scientific collaboration during World War II.  Well before the [[Polish September Campaign|Invasion of Poland]], [[nationalism]] was a powerful force in the German physics community (see [[Deutsche Physik]]); the military mobilization of physicists was all but irresistible after the rise of [[National Socialism]].  German and Allied investigations of the possibility of a nuclear bomb began in 1939 at the initiative of civilian scientists, but by 1942 the respective militaries were heavily involved.  The [[German nuclear energy project]] had two independent teams, a civilian-controlled team under [[Werner Heisenberg]] and a military-controlled led by [[Kurt Diebner]]; the latter was more explicitly aimed at producing a bomb (as opposed to a power reactor) and received much more funding from the Nazis, though neither was ultimately successful.&lt;ref&gt;The extent to which Heisenberg’s team was devoted to aiding the Nazi’s by producing an atomic bomb is a matter of some historical dispute.  However, most recent scholarship suggests that the stagnation of the German project stemmed from Heisenberg’s doubts about the feasibility rather than the desirability of a Nazi bomb.  See: Rose, Paul Lawrence.  ''Heisenberg and the Nazi Atomic Bomb Project: A Study in German Culture''.  Berkeley: University of California Press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the U.S., the [[Manhattan Project]] and other projects of the [[Office of Scientific Research and Development]] resulted in a much more extensive military-scientific venture, the scale of which dwarfed previous military-funded research projects.  Theoretical work by a number of British and American scientists resulted in significant optimism about the possibility of a [[nuclear chain reaction]]. As the physicists convinced military leaders of the potential of nuclear weapons, funding for actual development was ratcheted up rapidly.  A number of large laboratories were created across the United States for work on different aspects of the bomb, while many existing facilities were reoriented to bomb-related work; some were university-managed while others were government-run, but all were ultimately funded and directed by the military.&lt;ref&gt;[[Los Alamos National Laboratory]], the University of Chicago’s [[Metallurgical Laboratory]] (now [[Argonne National Laboratory]]), [[Hanford Site]] (now defunct), and [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] were all created during the Manhattan Project, while Berkeley’s [[Radiation Laboratory]] and smaller labs across the country became part of the project as well.  Among others, see: Smyth, Henry DeWolf.  [[Smyth Report|''Atomic Energy for Military Purposes: The Official Report on the Development of the Atomic Bomb under the Auspices of the United States Government, 1940-1945]]''.   Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1945. Rhodes, Richard. ''The Making of the Atomic Bomb''.  New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;  The May 1945 surrender of Germany, the original intended target for the bomb, did virtually nothing to slow the project’s momentum.  After Japan’s surrender immediately following the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]], many scientists returned to academia or industry, but the Manhattan Project infrastructure was too large—and too effective—to be dismantled wholesale; it became the model for future military-scientific work, in the U.S. and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Kevles, ''The Physicists'', pp. 324-348.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other wartime physics research, particularly in [[rocket]]ry and radar technology, was less significant in popular culture but much more significant for the outcome of the war.  German rocketry was driven by the pursuit of ''[[Wunderwaffe]]n'', resulting in the [[V-2 rocket|V-2]] [[ballistic missile]]; the technology as well as the personal expertise of the German rocketry community was absorbed by the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. rocket programs after the war, forming the basis of long-term military funded rocketry, ballistic missile, and later space research.  Rocket science was only beginning to make impact by the final years of the war.  German rockets created fear and destruction in London, but had only modest military significance, while air-to-ground rockets enhanced the power of American air strikes; [[jet aircraft]] also went into service by the end of the war.&lt;ref&gt;Hacker, ''The Machines of War,'' p. 263.&lt;/ref&gt;  Radar work before and during the war provided even more of an advantage for the Allies.  British physicists pioneered [[long-wave radar]], developing an effective system for detecting incoming German air forces.  Work on potentially more precise [[short-wave radar]] was turned over to the U.S.; several thousand academic physicists and engineers not participating the Manhattan Project did radar work, particularly at MIT and Stanford, resulting in [[microwave]] radar systems that could resolve more detail in incoming flight formations.  Further refinement of microwave technology led to proximity fuzes, which greatly enhanced the ability of the U.S. Navy to defend against Japanese bombers.  Microwave production, detection and manipulation also formed the technical foundation to complement the institutional foundation of the Manhattan Project in much post-war defense research.

==American Cold War science==
In the years immediately following World War II, the military was by far the most significant patron of university science research in the U.S., and the national labs also continued to flourish.&lt;ref&gt;Geiger, Roger.  "Science, Universities, and National Defense, 1945-1970," ''Osiris'' (2nd series), Vol. 7, 1992, ''Science after '40'', pp 26-48.  p 26.&lt;/ref&gt;  After two years in political limbo (but with work on nuclear power and bomb manufacture continuing apace) the Manhattan Project became a permanent arm of the government as the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]].  The Navy—inspired by the success of military-directed wartime research—created its own R&amp;D organization, the [[Office of Naval Research]], which would preside over an expanded long-term research program at [[Naval Research Laboratory]] as well as fund a variety of university-based research.  Military money following up the wartime radar research led to explosive growth in both [[electronics]] research and electronics manufacturing.&lt;ref&gt;Forman, "Behind quantum electronics," pp 159-160.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] became an independent service branch from the Army and established its own research and development system, and the Army followed suit (though it was less invested in academic science than the Navy or Air Force).  Meanwhile, the perceived communist menace of the Soviet Union caused tensions—and military budgets—to escalate rapidly.

The [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] primarily funded what has been broadly described as “physical research,” but to reduce this to merely chemistry and physics is misleading.  Military patronage benefited a large number of fields, and in fact helped create a number of the modern [[scientific discipline]]s.  At [[Stanford University|Stanford]] and [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], for example, electronics, [[aerospace engineering]], [[nuclear physics]], and [[materials science]]&amp;mdash;all physics, broadly speaking&amp;mdash;each developed in different directions, becoming increasingly independent of parent disciplines as they grew and pursued defense-related research agendas.  What began as interdepartmental laboratories became the centers for graduate teaching and research innovation thanks to the broad scope of defense funding.  The need to keep up with corporate technology research (which was receiving the lion’s share of defense contracts) also prompted many science labs to establish close relationships with industry.&lt;ref&gt;Leslie, Stuart.  ''The Cold War and American Science: The Military-Industrial-Academic Complex at MIT and Stanford''.  New York: Columbian University Press, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Computing===
The complex histories of [[history of computer science|computer science]] and [[history of computer hardware|computer engineering]] were shaped, in the first decades of digital computing, almost entirely by military funding.  Most of the basic component technologies for digital computing were developed through the course of the long-running [[Whirlwind (computer)|Whirlwind]]-[[Semi Automatic Ground Environment|SAGE]] program to develop an automated radar shield.  Virtually unlimited funds enabled two decades of research that only began producing useful technologies by the end of the 50s; even the final version of the SAGE command and control system had only marginal military utility.  More so than with previously-established disciplines receiving military funding, the culture of computer science was permeated with a [[Cold War]] military perspective.  Indirectly, the ideas of computer science also had a profound effect on [[psychology]], [[cognitive science]] and [[neuroscience]] through the mind-computer analogy.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, Paul  ''The Closed World: Computers and the Politics of Discourse in Cold War America''.  Cambridge: MIT Press, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geosciences and astrophysics===
The [[Outline of earth science|history of earth science]] and the [[history of astrophysics]] were also closely tied to military purposes and funding throughout the Cold War.  American [[geodesy]], [[oceanography]], and [[seismology]] grew from small sub-disciplines in into full-fledged independent disciplines as for several decades, virtually all funding in these fields came from the Department of Defense.  A central goal that tied these disciplines together (even while providing the means for intellectual independence) was the [[figure of the Earth]], the model of the earth’s [[geography]] and [[gravitation]] that was essential for accurate ballistic missiles.  In the 1960s, geodesy was the superficial goal of the satellite program [[Corona (satellite)|CORONA]], while military [[reconnaissance]] was in fact a driving force.  Even for geodetic data, new secrecy guidelines worked to restrict collaboration in a field that had formerly been fundamentally international; the Figure of the Earth had geopolitical significance beyond questions of pure geoscience.  Still, geodesists were able to retain enough autonomy and subvert secrecy limitations enough to make use of the findings of their military research to overturn some of the fundamental theories of geodesy.&lt;ref&gt;Cloud, John.  "Crossing the Olentangy River: The Figure of the Earth and the Military-Industrial-Academic-Complex, 1947-1972," ''Studies in the History and Philosophy of Modern Physics'', Vol. 31, No. 3, pp 371-404. 2000
Cloud, John.  "Imaging the World in a Barrel: CORONA and the Clandestine Convergence of the Earth Sciences," ''Social Studies of Science'', Vol. 31, No. 2, pp 231-251.  April 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;  Like geodesy and satellite photography research, the advent of [[radio astronomy]] had a military purpose hidden beneath official astrophysical research agenda.  Quantum electronics permitted both revolutionary new methods of analyzing the universe and&amp;mdash;using the same equipment and technology&amp;mdash;the monitoring of Soviet electronic signals.&lt;ref&gt;van Keuren, David K.  "Cold War Science in Black and White: US Intelligence Gathering and Its Scientific Cover at the Naval Research Laboratory, 1948-62," ''Social Studies of Science'', Vol. 31, No. 2, pp 207-229.  April 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Military interest in (and funding of) seismology, meteorology and oceanography was in some ways a result of the defense-related payoffs of physics and geodesy.  The immediate goal of funding in these fields was to detect clandestine [[nuclear testing]] and track [[nuclear fallout|fallout radiation]], a necessary precondition for treaties to limit the nuclear weapon technology earlier military research had created.  In particular, the feasibility of monitoring underground nuclear explosions was crucial to the possibility of a [[Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty|comprehensive]] rather than [[Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty]].&lt;ref&gt;Barth, Kai-Henrik.  "The Politics of Seismology: Nuclear Testing, Arms Control, and the Transformation of a Discipline," ''Social Studies of Science'', Vol. 33, No. 5, pp 743-781.  October 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;  But the military-funded growth of these disciplines continued even when no pressing military goals were driving them; as with other natural sciences, the military also found value in having ‘scientists on tap’ for unforeseen future R&amp;D needs.&lt;ref&gt;Mukerji, Chandra.  ''A Fragile Power: Scientists and the State''.  Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biological sciences===
The [[biology|biological sciences]] were also affected by military funding, but, with the exception of nuclear physics-related medical and genetic research, largely indirectly.  The most significant funding sources for basic research before the rise of the military-industrial-academic complex were philanthropic organizations such as the [[Rockefeller Foundation]].  After World War II (and to some extent before), the influx of new industrial and military funding opportunities for the physical sciences prompted philanthropies to divest from physics research&amp;mdash;most early work in high-energy physics and biophysics had been the product of foundation grants&amp;mdash;and refocus on biological and medical research.

The [[social sciences]] also found limited military support from the 1940s to the 1960s, but much defense-minded social science research could be—and was—pursued without extensive military funding.  In the 1950s, social scientists tried to emulate the interdisciplinary organizational success of the physical sciences’ Manhattan Project with the synthetic [[behavioral science movement]].&lt;ref&gt;Though somewhat related, "behavioral science" in this context should not be confused with the [[behavioral sciences]] or [[radical behaviorism|behaviorism]], the strictly mechanistic approach to psychology promoted by B. F. Skinner.  See: Robin, Ron.  ''The Making of the Cold War Enemy: Culture and Politics in the Military-Intellectual Complex''.  Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;  Social scientists actively sought to promote their usefulness to the military, researching topics related to [[propaganda]] (put to use in [[Korean War|Korea]]), decision making, the psychological and sociological causes and effects of [[communism]], and a broad constellation of other topics of Cold War significance.  By the 1960s, economists and political scientists offered up [[modernization theory]] for the cause of Cold War [[nation-building]]; modernization theory found a home in the military in the form of [[Project Camelot]], a study of the process of revolution, as well as in the [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy administration]]’s approach to the [[Vietnam War]].  Project Camelot was ultimately canceled because of the concerns it raised about scientific [[Objectivity (science)|objectivity]] in the context of such a politicized research agenda; though natural sciences were not yet susceptible to implications of the corrupting influence of military and political factors, the social sciences were.&lt;ref&gt;For modernization theory, and its role in the Vietnam War, see: Latham, Michael E.  ''Modernization as Ideology: American Social Science and "Nation-Building" in the Kennedy Era''.  Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2000.
For Project Camelot, see: Solovey, Mark.  "Project Camelot and the 1960s Epistemological Revolution: Rethinking the Politics-Patronage-Social Science Nexus," ''Social Studies of Science'', Vol. 31, No. 2, April 2001, pp 171-206.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical debate==
Historian [[Paul Forman]], in his seminal 1987 article, proposed that not only had military funding of science greatly expanded the scope and significance of American physics, it also initiated "a qualitative change in its purposes and character."&lt;ref&gt;Forman, "Behind quantum electronics," p 150.&lt;/ref&gt;  Historians of science were beginning to turn to the Cold War relationship between science and the military for detailed study, and Forman’s “distortionist critique” (as [[Roger Geiger]] has described it) served to focus the ensuing debates.&lt;ref&gt;Geiger, Roger.  "Review of ''The Cold War and American Science: The Military-Industrial-Academic Complex at MIT and Stanford''," ''Technology and Culture'', Vol. 34 pp 629-631.  1994.&lt;/ref&gt;  Forman and others (e.g., [[Robert Seidel]], Stuart Leslie, and for the history of the social sciences, [[Ron Robin]]) view the influx of military money and the focus on applied rather than basic research as having had, at least partially, a negative impact on the course of subsequent research.  In turn, critics of the distortionist thesis, beginning with [[Daniel Kevles]], deny that the military "seduced American physicists from, so to speak, a 'true basic physics'."&lt;ref&gt;Kevles, Daniel J.  "Cold war and hot physics: Science, security, and the American state, 1945-56," ''Historical Studies in the Physical and Biological Sciences'', Vol. 20, No. 2, pp 239-264.  1990.&lt;/ref&gt;  Kevles, as well as Geiger, instead view the effects of military funding relative to such funding simply being absent—rather than put to alternate scientific use.&lt;ref&gt;Geiger, “Science, Universities, and National Defense, 1945-1970.”  See also: Geiger, Roger.  ''Knowledge &amp; Money: Research Universities and the Paradox of the Marketplace''.  Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2004.
In Geiger’s broad analysis of the relationship between political economy and academic research, the character and purpose of funding sources play little role, and there is no discussion of the distinctiveness of military funding.  Rather, such funding is significant only in the context of ‘[[crowding out (economics)|crowding out]]’ other economic forces.&lt;/ref&gt;  Most recent scholarship has moved toward a tempered version of Forman's thesis, in which scientists retained significant autonomy despite the radical changes brought about by military funding.&lt;ref&gt;Hounshell, David A.  "Epilogue: Rethinking the Cold War; Rethinking Science and Technology in the Cold War; Rethinking the Social Study of Science and Technology," ''Social Studies of Science'', Vol. 31, No. 2, April 2001, pp 289-297.&lt;/ref&gt;

:''For information about the form of substance abuse known as ''huffing'', see [[inhalant]].  For the Transformers character, see [[Huffer (Transformers)]]. For the surname, see [[Huffer (surname)]]''

In [[aviation]], a '''huffer''' is an external engine that creates large volumes of pressurized air used to start large gas [[turbine]] [[jet engines]] on some types of [[aircraft]].

The huffer works by blowing compressed air via flexible hose to the aircraft's [[bleed air]] system.  From there, the air flows via a pilot controlled valve to the engine's starter motor.  The starter motor converts the energy of the moving air to rotational torque.  The starter motor is linked via shaft to the N2 or core of the engine and spins the compressor and first stage turbine. Once there is enough air flowing through the [[Gas compressor|compressor]] and the [[combustion chamber]] to light the engine, fuel in the form of vaporized [[kerosene]] starts flowing and an igniter similar to a [[spark plug]] ignites the fuel. Then fuel flow is increased to spin the engine up to its normal idle speed, at which point the engine is self-sustaining and no longer needs the support of the starter.

In some earlier jet engines, the air from the huffer acted directly on the compressor or turbine blades to cause them to spin without the need for the air starter motor.

Some aircraft turbine engines do not use compressed air to start, but instead are started using an electric starter motor. This is attached to the main turbine shaft and does the same job as the air starter motor. The application of the huffer is primarily seen when an aircraft's [[Auxiliary Power Unit]] is not working, or to military aircraft, many of which use a huffer to save on weight.

== History of anthropogenic nitrogen inputs ==
Approximately 78% of earth's atmosphere is N gas (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), which is an inert compound and biologically unavailable to most organisms. In order to be utilized in most biological processes, N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; must be converted to reactive N (Nr), which includes inorganic reduced forms (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;), inorganic oxidized forms (NO, NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, and NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;), and organic compounds ([[urea]], [[amine]]s, and [[protein]]s).&lt;ref name="gallo2003"/&gt; N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; has a strong triple bond, and so a significant amount of energy (226 kcal mol&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) is required to convert N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to Nr.&lt;ref name="gallo2003"/&gt; Prior to industrial processes, the only sources of such energy were solar radiation and electrical discharges.&lt;ref name="gallo2003"/&gt; Utilizing a large amount of metabolic energy and the enzyme [[nitrogenase]], some [[bacteria]] and [[cyanobacteria]] convert atmospheric N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, a process known as biological [[nitrogen fixation]] (BNF).&lt;ref name="Schles"&gt;Schlesinger, W. H. 1997. ''Biogeochemistry : An analysis of global change'', San Diego, CA.&lt;/ref&gt; The anthropogenic analogue to BNF is the [[Haber-Bosch]] process, in which H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is reacted with atmospheric N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at high temperatures and pressures to produce NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=smil&gt;Smil, V. 2001. ''Enriching the earth : Fritz Haber, Carl Bosch, and the transformation of world food production''. MIT Press, Cambridge, MA.&lt;/ref&gt; Lastly, N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is converted to NO by energy from [[lightning]], which is negligible in current temperate ecosystems, or by [[fossil fuel]] combustion.&lt;ref name="gallo2003"/&gt;

Until 1850, natural BNF, cultivation-induced BNF (e.g., planting of [[leguminous]] crops), and incorporated organic matter were the only sources of N for agricultural production.&lt;ref name=smil/&gt; Near the turn of the century, Nr from [[guano]] and [[sodium nitrate]] deposits was harvested and exported from the arid Pacific islands and South American deserts.&lt;ref name=smil/&gt; By the late 1920s, early industrial processes, albeit inefficient, were commonly used to produce NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name="gallo2003"/&gt; Due to the efforts of [[Fritz Haber]] and [[Carl Bosch]], the Haber-Bosch process became the largest source of nitrogenous fertilizer after the 1950s, and replaced BNF as the dominant source of NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; production.&lt;ref name=smil/&gt; From 1890 to 1990, anthropogenically created Nr increased almost ninefold.&lt;ref name="gallo2003"/&gt; During this time, the human population more than tripled, partly due to increased food production.

Since the [[industrial revolution]], an additional source of anthropogenic N input has been [[fossil fuel]] combustion, which is used to generate energy (e.g., to power automobiles). During combustion of [[fossil fuel]]s, high temperatures and pressures provide energy to produce NO from N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; oxidation.&lt;ref name="gallo2003"/&gt; Additionally, when [[fossil fuel]] is extracted and burned, fossil N may become reactive (i.e., NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; emissions).&lt;ref name="gallo2003"/&gt; During the 1970s, scientists began to recognize that N inputs were accumulating in the environment and affecting ecosystems.&lt;ref name="gallo2003"/&gt;

== Impacts of anthropogenic inputs on the nitrogen cycle ==
Between 1600 and 1990, global reactive nitrogen (Nr) creation had increased nearly 50%.&lt;ref name=gallocowl&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1639/0044-7447(2002)031[0064:RNATWY]2.0.CO;2|year=2002|volume=31|pages=64|title=Reactive Nitrogen and the World: 200 Years of Change|last1=Galloway|first1=James N.|last2=Cowling|first2=Ellis B.|journal=AMBIO: A Journal of the Human Environment|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, atmospheric emissions of Nr species reportedly increased 250% and deposition to marine and terrestrial ecosystems increased over 200%.&lt;ref name=gallocowl/&gt; Additionally, there was a reported fourfold increase in riverine dissolved inorganic N fluxes to coasts.&lt;ref name=gallocowl/&gt; Nitrogen is a critical limiting nutrient in many systems, including forests, wetlands, and coastal and marine ecosystems; therefore, this change in emissions and distribution of Nr has resulted in substantial consequences for aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Vitousek | first1 = P. | last2 = Howarth | first2 = R. | doi = 10.1007/BF00002772 | title = Nitrogen limitation on land and in the sea: How can it occur? | journal = Biogeochemistry | volume = 13 | issue = 2 | year = 1991 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="raba"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1639/0044-7447(2002)031[0102:NIAE]2.0.CO;2|year=2002|volume=31|pages=102|title=Nitrogen in Aquatic Ecosystems|last1=Rabalais|first1=Nancy N.|authorlink1=Nancy Rabalais|journal=AMBIO: A Journal of the Human Environment|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Atmosphere===
Atmospheric N inputs mainly include oxides of N (NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;), ammonia (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), and nitrous oxide (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) from aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems,&lt;ref name="Schles"/&gt; and NO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; from [[fossil fuel]] and biomass combustion.&lt;ref name="gallo2003"/&gt;

In [[agroecosystem]]s, fertilizer application has increased microbial [[nitrification]] (aerobic process in which microorganisms oxidize ammonium [NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] to nitrate [NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;]) and [[denitrification]] (anaerobic process in which microorganisms reduce NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; to atmospheric nitrogen gas [N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]). Both processes naturally leak nitric oxide (NO) and nitrous oxide (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) to the atmosphere.&lt;ref name="Schles"/&gt; Of particular concern is N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, which has an average atmospheric lifetime of 114–120 years,&lt;ref&gt;[[John T.

===Biosphere===

Terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems receive Nr inputs from the atmosphere through wet and dry deposition.&lt;ref name="gallo2003"/&gt; Atmospheric Nr species can be deposited to ecosystems in precipitation (e.g., NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, organic N compounds), as gases (e.g., NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and gaseous nitric acid [HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]), or as aerosols (e.g., ammonium nitrate [NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]).&lt;ref name="gallo2003"/&gt; Aquatic ecosystems receive additional nitrogen from [[surface runoff]] and [[river]]ine inputs.&lt;ref name="raba"/&gt;
 
Increased N deposition can acidify soils, streams, and lakes and alter forest and grassland productivity. In grassland ecosystems, N inputs have produced initial increases in productivity followed by declines as critical thresholds are exceeded.&lt;ref name="gallo2003"/&gt; Nitrogen effects on [[biodiversity]], [[carbon cycling]], and changes in species composition have also been demonstrated. In highly developed areas of near shore coastal ocean and estuarine systems, rivers deliver direct (e.g., [[surface runoff]]) and indirect (e.g., groundwater contamination) N inputs from agroecosystems.&lt;ref name="raba"/&gt; Increased N inputs can result in [[freshwater acidification]] and [[eutrophication]] of marine waters.

====Terrestrial ecosystems====

=====Impacts on productivity and nutrient cycling=====

Much of terrestrial growth in temperate systems is limited by N; therefore, N inputs (i.e., through deposition and fertilization) can increase N availability, which temporarily increases N uptake, plant and microbial growth, and N accumulation in plant biomass and [[soil organic matter]].&lt;ref name=aber89&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/1311067 Aber, J.

NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;, the product of nitrification, is highly mobile and can be leached from the soil, along with positively charged alkaline minerals such as calcium and magnesium.&lt;ref name="Schles"/&gt; In acid soils, mobilized aluminium ions can reach toxic concentrations, negatively affecting both terrestrial and adjacent aquatic ecosystems.

A 15-year study of chronic N additions at the Harvard Forest Long Term Ecological Research ([[LTER]]) program has elucidated many impacts of increased nitrogen deposition on nutrient cycling in temperate forests. It found that chronic N additions resulted in greater leaching losses, increased pine mortality, and cessation of biomass accumulation.&lt;ref name=magill/&gt; Another study reported that chronic N additions resulted in accumulation of non-photosynthetic N and subsequently reduced photosynthetic capacity, supposedly leading to severe carbon stress and mortality.&lt;ref name=bauer/&gt; These findings negate previous hypotheses that increased N inputs would increase NPP and [[carbon sequestration]].

=====Impacts on plant species diversity=====

Many plant communities have evolved under low nutrient conditions; therefore, increased N inputs can alter biotic and abiotic interactions, leading to changes in community composition. Several nutrient addition studies have shown that increased N inputs lead to dominance of fast-growing plant species, with associated declines in species richness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Laura Foster Huenneke |author2=Steven P.

In a more recent experimental study of N fertilization and disturbance (i.e., tillage) in old field succession, it was found that species richness decreased with increasing N, regardless of disturbance level. Competition experiments showed that competitive dominants excluded competitively inferior species between disturbance events. With increased N inputs, competition shifted from belowground to aboveground (i.e., to competition for light), and patch colonization rates significantly decreased. These internal changes can dramatically affect the community by shifting the balance of competition-colonization tradeoffs between species.&lt;ref name=wiltil/&gt; In patch-based systems, regional coexistence can occur through tradeoffs in competitive and colonizing abilities given sufficiently high disturbance rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Hastings | first1 = A. | title = Disturbance, coexistence, history, and competition for space | doi = 10.1016/0040-5809(80)90059-3 | journal = Theoretical Population Biology | volume = 18 | issue = 3 | pages = 363–373 | year = 1980 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; That is, with inverse ranking of competitive and colonizing abilities, plants can coexist in space and time as disturbance removes superior competitors from patches, allowing for establishment of superior colonizers. However, as demonstrated by Wilson and Tilman, increased nutrient inputs can negate tradeoffs, resulting in competitive exclusion of these superior colonizers/poor competitors.&lt;ref name=wiltil/&gt;

====Aquatic ecosystems====

Aquatic ecosystems also exhibit varied responses to nitrogen enrichment. NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; loading from N saturated, terrestrial ecosystems can lead to [[Ocean acidification|acidification]] of downstream freshwater systems and [[eutrophication]] of downstream marine systems. [[Freshwater acidification]] can cause aluminium toxicity and mortality of pH-sensitive fish species. Because marine systems are generally nitrogen-limited, [[Nutrient pollution|excessive N inputs]] can result in water quality degradation due to toxic algal blooms, oxygen deficiency, habitat loss, decreases in [[biodiversity]], and fishery losses.&lt;ref name=raba/&gt;

=====Acidification of freshwaters=====

Atmospheric N deposition in terrestrial landscapes can be transformed through soil microbial processes to biologically available nitrogen, which can result in surface-water [[Freshwater acidification|acidification]], and [[Biodiversity loss|loss of biodiversity]].

=====Eutrophication of marine systems=====

Urbanization, deforestation, and agricultural activities largely contribute sediment and nutrient inputs to coastal waters via rivers.&lt;ref name=raba/&gt; Increased nutrient inputs to marine systems have shown both short-term increases in productivity and fishery yields, and long-term detrimental effects of [[eutrophication]].

The increased primary (i.e., phytoplankton, macroalgae, etc.) production leads to a flux of carbon to bottom waters when decaying organic matter (i.e., senescent primary production) sinks and is consumed by aerobic bacteria lower in the water column. As a result, oxygen consumption in bottom waters is greater than diffusion of oxygen from surface waters. Additionally, certain algal blooms termed harmful algal blooms (HABs) produce toxins that can act as neuromuscular or organ damaging compounds. These algal blooms can be harmful to other marine life as well as to humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Skulberg|first=Olav M.|last2=Codd|first2=Geoffrey A.|last3=Carmichael|first3=Wayne W.|date=1984-01-01|title=Toxic Blue-Green Algal Blooms in Europe: A Growing Problem|jstor=4313034|journal=Ambio|volume=13|issue=4|pages=244–247}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=V.H.|last2=Tilman|first2=G.D.|last3=Nekola|first3=J.C.|title=Eutrophication: impacts of excess nutrient inputs on freshwater, marine, and terrestrial ecosystems|journal=Environmental Pollution|volume=100|issue=1–3|pages=179–196|doi=10.1016/s0269-7491(99)00091-3|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Integration ==
The above system responses to reactive nitrogen (Nr) inputs are almost all exclusively studied separately; however, research increasingly indicates that nitrogen loading problems are linked by multiple pathways transporting nutrients across system boundaries.&lt;ref name=gallo2003/&gt; This sequential transfer between ecosystems is termed the nitrogen cascade.&lt;ref name=gallocowl/&gt; ([http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20050802102955/http://www.unep.org/GEO/yearbook/yb2003/089.htm see illustration from United Nations Environment Programme]). During the cascade, some systems accumulate Nr, which results in a time lag in the cascade and enhanced effects of Nr on the environment in which it accumulates. Ultimately, anthropogenic inputs of Nr are either accumulated or denitrified; however, little progress has been made in determining the relative importance of Nr accumulation and [[denitrification]], which has been mainly due to a lack of integration among scientific disciplines.&lt;ref name=gallo2003/&gt;&lt;ref name=davseit&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Davidson | first1 = E.

Various methods in immunochemistry have been developed and refined, and been used in scientific study, from [[virology]] to [[molecular evolution]].

One of the earliest examples of immunochemistry is the [[Wasserman test]] to detect [[Syphilis]]. [[Svante Arrhenius]] was also one of the pioneers in the field; he published ''Immunochemistry'' in 1907 which described the application of the methods of physical chemistry to the study of the theory of [[toxin]]s and [[antitoxins]].

Immunochemistry is also studied from the aspect of using [[antibodies]] to label [[epitopes]] of interest in cells ([[immunocytochemistry]]) or tissues ([[immunohistochemistry]])

'''Industrial design''' is a process of [[design]] applied to [[Product (business)|products]] that are to be manufactured through techniques of [[mass production]].{{sfn|Heskett|1980|pp=10-11}}{{sfn|Kirkham|1999}} Its key characteristic is that design is separated from manufacture: the creative act of determining and defining a product's form and features takes place in advance of the physical act of making a product, which consists purely of repeated, often automated, replication.{{sfn|Heskett|1980|p=10}}{{sfn|Noblet|1993|pp=21-22}} This distinguishes industrial design from [[craft]]-based design, where the form of the product is determined by the product's creator at the time of its creation.{{sfn|Noblet|1993|p=21}}

All manufactured products are the result of a design process, but the nature of this process can take many forms: it can be conducted by an individual or a large team; it can emphasize intuitive [[creativity]] or calculated [[Evidence-based design|scientific decision-making]], and often emphasizes both at the same time; and it can be influenced by factors as varied as [[Raw material|material]]s, [[Manufacturing process management|production processes]], [[business strategy]] and prevailing social, commercial or aesthetic attitudes.{{sfn|Heskett|1980|p=10}} The role of an industrial designer is to create and execute design solutions for problems of form, function, usability, [[physical ergonomics]], marketing, brand development, sustainability, and sales.&lt;ref&gt;de Noblet, J., ''Industrial Design'', Paris: A.F.A.A. (1993)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Precursors===
For several millennia before the onset of [[industrialisation]], design, technical expertise, and manufacturing were often done by individuals [[Craft production|craftsmen]], who determined the form of a product at the point of its creation, according to their own manual skill, the requirements of their clients, experience accumulated through their own experimentation, and knowledge passed on to them through training or [[apprenticeship]].{{sfn|Noblet|1993|p=21}}

The [[division of labour]] that underlies the practice of industrial design did have precedents in the pre-industrial era.{{sfn|Heskett|1980|pp=10-11}} The growth of trade in the medieval period led to the emergence of large workshops in cities such as [[Florence]], [[Venice]], [[Nuremberg]] and [[Bruges]], where groups of more specialized craftsmen made objects with common forms through the repetitive duplication of models which defined by their shared training and technique.{{sfn|Heskett|1980|p=11}} Competitive pressures in the early 16th century led to the emergence in [[Italy]] and [[Germany]] of [[pattern books]]: collections of [[engravings]] illustrating decorative forms and motifs which could be applied to a wide range of products, and whose creation took place in advance of their application.{{sfn|Heskett|1980|p=11}} The use of [[Technical drawing|drawing]] to specify how something was to be constructed later was first developed by [[architects]] and [[shipwrights]] during the [[Italian Renaissance]].{{sfn|Baynes|1991|p=108}}

In the 17th century, the growth of artistic patronage in centralized monarchical states such as [[France]] led to large government-operated manufacturing operations epitomised by the [[Gobelins Manufactory]], opened in [[Paris]] in 1667 by [[Louis XIV]].{{sfn|Heskett|1980|p=11}} Here teams of hundreds of craftsmen, including specialist artists, decorators and engravers, produced sumptuously decorated products ranging from [[tapestries]] and [[furniture]] to [[metalwork]] and [[Coach (carriage)|coaches]], all under the creative supervision of the King's leading artist [[Charles Le Brun]].{{sfn|Heskett|1980|pp=11-12}} This pattern of  large-scale royal patronage was repeated in the court porcelain factories of the early 18th century, such as the [[Meissen porcelain]] workshops established in 1709 by the [[Grand Duchy of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach|Grand Duke of Saxony]], where patterns from a range of sources, including court goldsmiths, sculptors and engravers, were used as models for the vessels and figurines for which it became famous.{{sfn|Heskett|1980|p=12}} As long as reproduction remained craft-based, however, the form and artistic quality of the product remained in the hands of the individual craftsman, and tended to decline as the scale of production increased.{{sfn|Heskett|1980|pp=12-13}}

===Birth of industrial design===
The emergence of industrial design is specifically linked to the growth of industrialisation and mechanisation that began with the [[industrial revolution]] in [[Great Britain]] in the mid 18th century.{{sfn|Heskett|1980|pp=10-11}}{{sfn|Kirkham|1999}} The rise of industrial manufacture changed the way objects were made, [[urbanisation]] changed patterns of [[consumerism|consumption]], the [[imperialism|growth of empires]] broadened tastes and diversified markets, and the emergence of a wider [[middle class]] created demand for fashionable styles from a much larger and more heterogeneous population.{{sfn|Benton|2000|p=380}}

The first use of the term "industrial design" is often attributed to the industrial designer [[Joseph Claude Sinel]] in 1919 (although he himself denied this in interviews), but the discipline predates 1919 by at least a decade.  [[Christopher Dresser]] is considered among the first independent industrial designers.&lt;ref name=dresser&gt;{{cite web|title=Christopher Dresser|url=http://design.designmuseum.org/design/christopher-dresser|website=Design Museum|accessdate=9 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140920154512/http://design.designmuseum.org/design/christopher-dresser|archive-date=20 September 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Industrial design's origins lie in the industrialization of consumer products. For instance the [[Deutscher Werkbund]], founded in 1907 and a precursor to the [[Bauhaus]], was a state-sponsored effort to integrate traditional crafts and industrial mass-production techniques, to put [[Germany]] on a competitive footing with Great Britain and the [[United States]].

The earliest use of the term may have been in [[The Art Journal|''The Art Union'', A monthly Journal of the Fine Arts]], 1839.

{{Quotation|Dyce's report to the Board of Trade on foreign schools of Design for Manufactures. Mr Dyces official visit to France, Prussia and Bavaria for the purpose of examining the state of schools of design in those countries will be fresh in the recollection of our readers. His report on this subject was ordered to be printed some few months since, on the motion of Mr Hume.

The school of St Peter, at Lyons was founded about 1750 for the instruction of draftsmen employed in preparing patterns for the silk manufacture. It has been much more successful than the Paris school and having been disorganized by the revolution, was restored by Napoleon and differently constituted, being then erected into an Academy of Fine Art: to which the study of design for silk manufacture was merely attached as a subordinate branch. It appears that all the students who entered the school commence as if they were intended for artists in the higher sense of the word and are not expected to decide as to whether they will devote themselves to the Fine Arts or to Industrial Design, until they have completed their exercises in drawing and painting of the figure from the antique and from the living model. It is for this reason, and from the fact that artists for industrial purposes are both well paid and highly considered (as being well instructed men) that so many individuals in France engage themselves in ''both'' pursuits.}}

''The Practical Draughtsman's Book of Industrial Design'' by [[Jacques-Eugène Armengaud]] was printed in 1853.&lt;ref name=practical&gt;{{cite web|title=The practical draughtsman's book of industrial design : forming a complete course of mechanical, engineering, and architectural drawing by Armengaud, aîné (Jacques-Eugène), 1810-1891|url=https://archive.org/details/practicaldraught00arme|website=Internet Archive|accessdate=14 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The subtitle of the (translated) work explains, that it wants to offer a "complete course of mechanical, engineering, and architectural drawing." The study of those types of technical drawing, according to Armengaud, belong to the field of industrial design.  This work paved the way for a big expansion in the field drawing education in France, the United Kingdom and the United States.

[[Robert Lepper]] helped to establish one of the country's first industrial design degree programs in 1934 at [[Carnegie Institute of Technology]].&lt;ref name="Carnegie Mellon magazine - Winter 2002"&gt;[http://www.cmu.edu/magazine/02winter/newsbriefs.html "Newsbriefs: Lepper show runs at Warhol."] Carnegie Mellon Magazine. Winter 2002. Retrieved January 17, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
[[Product design]] and industrial design overlap in the fields of [[user interface design]], [[information design]], and [[interaction design]]. Various [[schools]] of industrial design specialize in one of these aspects, ranging from pure art colleges and design schools (product styling), to mixed programs of engineering and design, to related disciplines such as exhibit design and interior design, to schools that almost completely subordinated aesthetic design to concerns of usage and ergonomics, the so-called ''functionalist'' school.&lt;ref&gt;Pulos, Arthur J., ''The American Design Adventure 1940-1975'', Cambridge, Mass:MIT Press (1988), p. 249 ({{ISBN|9780262161060}})&lt;/ref&gt; Except for certain functional areas of overlap between industrial design and engineering design, educational programs in the U.S. for engineering design require accreditation by the Accreditation Board for Engineering and Technology (ABET)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abet.org/accreditation/ Abet.org]&lt;/ref&gt; in contrast to programs for industrial design which are accredited by the National Association of Schools of Art and Design (NASAD).&lt;ref&gt;[http://nasad.arts-accredit.org/index.jsp?page=About+NASAD Nasad.arts-accredit.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150812143443/http://nasad.arts-accredit.org/index.jsp?page=About+NASAD |date=2015-08-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Institutions===
Most industrial designers complete a design or related program at a vocational school or university. Relevant programs include graphic design, interior design, industrial design, architectural technology, and drafting  Diplomas and degrees in industrial design are offered at vocational schools and universities worldwide. Diplomas and degrees take two  to four years of study. The study results in a [[Bachelor of Industrial Design]] (B.I.D.), [[Bachelor of Science]] (B.Sc) or [[Bachelor of Fine Arts]] (B.F.A.). Afterwards, the bachelor programme can be extended to postgraduate degrees such as [[Master of Design]], [[Master of Fine Arts]] and others to a [[Master of Arts]] or [[Master of Science]].

==Definition==

Industrial design studies function and form—and the connection between product, user, and environment. Generally, industrial design professionals work in small scale design, rather than overall design of complex systems such as buildings or ships. Industrial designers don't usually design motors, electrical circuits, or gearing that make machines move, but they may affect technical aspects through usability design and form relationships. Usually, they work with other professionals such as engineers who design the mechanical aspects of the product assuring functionality and manufacturability, and with marketers to identify and fulfill customer needs and expectations.

Design, itself, is often difficult to describe to non-designers and engineers, because the meaning accepted by the design community is not made of words. Instead, the definition is created as a result of acquiring a critical framework for the analysis and creation of artifacts. One of the many accepted (but intentionally unspecific) definitions of design originates from [[Carnegie Mellon School of Design|Carnegie Mellon's School of Design]], "Design is the process of taking something from its existing state and moving it to a preferred state" (Simon, Herbert A. "The sciences of the artiﬁcial." Cambridge, MA (1969, 1981, 1996)). This applies to new artifacts, whose existing state is undefined, and previously created artifacts, whose state stands to be improved.

Industrial design can overlap significantly with [[engineering design]], and in different countries the boundaries of the two concepts can vary, but in general [[engineering]] focuses principally on functionality or utility of products, whereas industrial design focuses principally on ''aesthetic and user-interface'' aspects of products. In many jurisdictions this distinction is effectively defined by [[Regulation and licensure in engineering|credentials and/or licensure]] required to engage in the practice of engineering.&lt;ref name=mcadc&gt;{{cite web|title=The Difference Between Industrial Design And Design Engineering|url=http://design.designmuseum.org/design/christopher-dresser|website=MCADC Cafe|accessdate=9 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140920154512/http://design.designmuseum.org/design/christopher-dresser|archive-date=20 September 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "Industrial design" as such does not overlap much with the engineering sub-discipline of [[industrial engineering]], except for the latter's sub-specialty of [[ergonomics]].

At the 29th General Assembly in Gwangju, South Korea, 2015, the Professional Practise Committee unveiled a renewed definition of industrial design as follows:
"Industrial Design is a strategic problem-solving process that drives innovation, builds business success and leads to a better quality of life through innovative products, systems, services and experiences."
An extended version of this definition is as follows:
"Industrial Design is a strategic problem-solving process that drives innovation, builds business success and leads to a better quality of life through innovative products, systems, services and experiences. Industrial Design bridges the gap between what is and what’s possible. It is a trans-disciplinary profession that harnesses creativity to resolve problems and co-create solutions with the intent of making a product, system, service, experience or a business, better. At its heart, Industrial Design provides a more optimistic way of looking at the future by reframing problems as opportunities. It links innovation, technology, research, business and customers to provide new value and competitive advantage across economic, social and environmental spheres.
Industrial Designers place the human in the centre of the process. They acquire a deep understanding of user needs through empathy and apply a pragmatic, user centric problem solving process to design products, systems, services and experiences. They are strategic stakeholders in the innovation process and are uniquely positioned to bridge varied professional disciplines and business interests. They value the economic, social and environmental impact of their work and their contribution towards co-creating a better quality of life. "&lt;ref name="ICSID 2015 in Gwangju"&gt;[http://www.icsid.org/about/about/articles31.htm ICSID web：DEFINITION OF INDUSTRIAL DESIGN] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070317224506/http://www.icsid.org/about/about/articles31.htm |date=2007-03-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design process==

Although the process of design may be considered 'creative,' many analytical processes also take place. In fact, many industrial designers often use various design methodologies in their creative process. Some of the processes that are commonly used are user research, sketching, comparative product research, model making, prototyping and testing. These processes are best defined by the industrial designers and/or other team members. Industrial designers often utilize 3D software, [[computer-aided industrial design]] and CAD programs to move from concept to production. They may also build a prototype first and then use [[industrial CT scanning]] to test for interior defects and generate a CAD model. From this the manufacturing process may be modified to improve the product.

Product characteristics specified by industrial designers may include the overall form of the object, the location of details with respect to one another, [[colors]], texture, form, and aspects concerning the [[Ergonomic|use of the product]]. Additionally they may specify aspects concerning the production process, [[material selection|choice of materials]] and the way the product is presented to the consumer at the [[point of sale]]. The inclusion of industrial designers in a product development process may lead to added value by improving [[usability]], lowering production costs and developing more appealing products.

Industrial design may also focus on technical concepts, products, and processes. In addition to [[aesthetics]], usability, and ergonomics, it can also encompass engineering, usefulness, market placement, and other concerns—such as psychology, desire, and the emotional attachment of the user. These [[Architectural design values|values]] and accompanying aspects that form the basis of industrial design can vary—between different schools of thought, and among practicing designers.

==Industrial design rights==
{{Main article|Industrial design rights}}

Industrial design rights are [[intellectual property]] rights that make exclusive the visual design of objects that are not purely utilitarian.  A design patent would also be considered under this category.  An industrial design consists of the creation of a shape, configuration or composition of pattern or color, or combination of pattern and color in three-dimensional form containing aesthetic value. An industrial design can be a two- or three-dimensional pattern used to produce a product, industrial commodity or handicraft. Under the [[Hague Agreement Concerning the International Deposit of Industrial Designs]], a [[WIPO]]-administered treaty, a procedure for an international registration exists. An applicant can file for a single international deposit with WIPO or with the national office in a country party to the treaty. The design will then be protected in as many member countries of the treaty as desired.

==Examples of iconic industrial design==

A number of industrial designers have made such a significant impact on culture and daily life that their work is documented by historians of social science. [[Alvar Aalto]], renowned as an [[architect]], also designed a significant number of household items, such as chairs, stools, lamps, a tea-cart, and vases. [[Raymond Loewy]] was a prolific American designer who is responsible for the [[Royal Dutch Shell]] corporate logo, the original [[BP]] logo (in use until 2000), the [[PRR S1]] steam locomotive, the [[Studebaker Starlight]] (including the later iconic bulletnose), as well as [[Schick (razors)|Schick]] electric razors, [[Electrolux]] refrigerators, short-wave radios, [[Le Creuset]] French ovens, and a complete line of modern furniture, among many other items.

[[Richard A. Teague]], who spent most of his career with the [[American Motor Company]], originated the concept of using interchangeable body panels so as to create a wide array of different vehicles using the same stampings. He was responsible for such unique automotive designs as the [[AMC Pacer|Pacer]], [[AMC Gremlin|Gremlin]], [[AMC Matador|Matador coupe]], [[Jeep Cherokee (XJ)|Jeep Cherokee]], and the complete interior of the [[Eagle Premier]].

Milwaukee's [[Brooks Stevens]] was best known for his [[Milwaukee Road]] [[Skytop Lounge]] car  and [[Oscar Mayer]] [[Wienermobile]] designs, among others.

[[Viktor Schreckengost]] designed bicycles manufactured by Murray bicycles for Murray and Sears, Roebuck and Company. With engineer Ray Spiller, he designed the first truck with a cab-over-engine configuration, a design in use to this day. Schreckengost also founded The Cleveland Institute of Art's school of industrial design.

[[Oskar Barnack]] was a German optical engineer, precision mechanic, industrial designer, and the father of 35mm photography. He developed the [[Leica Camera|Leica]], which became the hallmark for photography for 50 years, and remains a high-water mark for mechanical and optical design.

[[Charles and Ray Eames]] were most famous for their pioneering furniture designs, such as the [[Eames Lounge Chair Wood]] and [[Eames Lounge Chair]]. Other influential designers included [[Henry Dreyfuss]], [[Eliot Noyes]], [[John Vassos]], and [[Russel Wright]].

[[Dieter Rams]] is a German industrial designer closely associated with the consumer products company [[Braun (company)|Braun]] and the [[Functionalism (architecture)|Functionalist]] school of industrial design.

Many of [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]'s recent iconic products were designed by Sir [[Jonathan Ive]].

'''Jean Hani''' (1917-2012) was a French philosopher and [[Traditionalist School|Traditionalist]] author, and a professor of Greek civilization and literature at the [[University of Picardie Jules Verne|University of Amiens]].

==Life and Works==
Very little is known about Jean Hani's personal life other than his year of birth. [[Jean Borella]]'s mention of the author's modesty and his older age "studious retirement" seem to agree with this scarcity of information.&lt;ref name="borellahani"&gt;"Regard sur l'œuvre de Jean Hani" in ''Connaissance des Religions'', Dec. 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

Born in 1917, Hani proved a bright secondary student, pursuing his university studies in Classical Literature, and finally obtaining a doctorate with a dissertation about the influence of [[Ancient Egyptian religion|Egyptian religion]] on the thought of [[Plutarch]].&lt;ref name=hanithese&gt;''La religion Egyptienne dans la pensée de Plutarque'', Paris, Les belles lettres, 1976. Library record at Paris Sorbonne IV, 1971, Worldcat ref. 490686029&lt;/ref&gt; Appointed a lecturer at the [[University of Picardie Jules Verne|University of Amiens]], he founded the Centre de Recherches sur l'Antiquité Classique, and he led for many years a Séminar of History of Greek religion.&lt;ref name=borellahani/&gt; After his retirement, in addition to his prolific activity as an author of [[Traditionalist School|Traditional]] works, he became a frequent collaborator of journals like [[:fr:Connaissance des religions|''Connaissance des Religions'']] and [[:fr:Vers la tradition|''Vers la tradition'']]. Hani has been praised for his studies on Christian symbolism, particularly on the mass&lt;ref&gt;''The Divine Liturgy: Insights Into Its Mystery'', 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and the esoterism of Christian architecture.&lt;ref name="borellahani"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Symbolism of the Christian Temple'', 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Three kinds of works may be discerned within Hani's production: works of Classical philology, works dealing with history of religions and works dealing with traditional and sacred symbolism. The first group is represented by his annotated translations of [[Plutarch]], published partly within the well-known [[Collection Budé]].&lt;ref&gt;Plutarque, ''Oeuvres morales Tome VIII : Traités 42-45''. He also collaborated in Plutarque, ''Oeuvres morales Tome II : Traités 10-14''.&lt;/ref&gt; The second group is represented by his doctoral dissertation mentioned above.&lt;ref name="hanithese"/&gt; And the third group includes works like ''Le Symbolisme du temple chrétien'' (1962), ''Les Métiers de Dieu'' (1975), ''La Divine liturgie'' (1981) and ''La Royauté sacrée'' (1984)&lt;ref name="biblio"&gt;See bibliography below.&lt;/ref&gt; where his mastery of traditional hermeneutics and exegesis is firmly established. These books have been translated into English and several other European languages.&lt;ref name="biblio"/&gt;

According to [[Jean Borella]],&lt;ref name="borellahani"/&gt; the principles expounded in ''Le Symbolisme du temple chrétien'' have already been put into practice in the establishment of some contemporary monastic foundations.{{examples|date=October 2011}} Borella also considers Hani to be the first author in academia to successfully marry [[René Guénon|Guénon]]'s insights to the contemporary study of Hellenistic religions and Christianity.&lt;ref name="borellahani"/&gt;

In mechanical engineering, a '''kinematic chain''' is an assembly of [[Rigid body|rigid bodies]] connected by [[Joint (mechanics)|joints]] to provide constrained (or desired) motion that is the [[mathematical model]] for a [[mechanical system]].&lt;ref name=Reuleaux1876&gt;[[Franz Reuleaux|Reuleaux, F.]], 1876 [https://books.google.com/books?id=WUZVAAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=kinematics+of+machinery&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=qpn4Tse-E9SasgLcsZytDw&amp;ved=0CEQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=kinematics%20of%20machinery&amp;f=false ''The Kinematics of Machinery,''] (trans. and annotated by A. B. W. Kennedy), reprinted by Dover, New York (1963)&lt;/ref&gt;  As in the familiar use of the word [[chain]], the rigid bodies, or links, are constrained by their connections to other links.  An example is the simple open chain formed by links connected in series, like the usual chain, which is the [[kinematic]] model for a typical robot [[manipulator (device)|manipulator]].&lt;ref name="McCarthy2010"&gt;J. M. McCarthy and G. S. Soh, 2010, [https://books.google.com/books?id=jv9mQyjRIw4C&amp;pg=PA231&amp;lpg=PA231&amp;dq=geometric+design+of+linkages&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=j6TS1043qE&amp;sig=R5ycw5DximWrQOEVshfiytflD6Q&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=0Zj4TuiCFvCGsgKyvO3FAQ&amp;ved=0CGAQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=geometric%20design%20of%20linkages&amp;f=false ''Geometric Design of Linkages,''] Springer, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mathematical models of the connections, or joints, between two links are termed [[kinematic pair]]s.  Kinematic pairs model the hinged and sliding joints fundamental to [[robotics]], often called ''lower pairs'' and the surface contact joints critical to [[cam]]s and [[gear]]ing, called ''higher pairs.''  These joints are generally modeled as [[holonomic constraints]].  A [[kinematic diagram]] is a schematic of the mechanical system that shows the kinematic chain.

The modern use of kinematic chains includes compliance that arises from flexure joints in precision mechanisms, link compliance in [[compliant mechanism]]s and [[micro-electro-mechanical systems]], and cable compliance in cable robotic and [[tensegrity]] systems.&lt;ref&gt;Larry L. Howell, 2001, [https://books.google.com/books/about/Compliant_mechanisms.html?id=tiiSOuhsIfgC Compliant mechanisms], John Wiley &amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Slocum, 1992, [https://books.google.com/books?id=uG7aqgal65YC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Precision Machine Design], SME&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mobility formula ==
The [[degrees of freedom (mechanics)|degrees of freedom]], or ''mobility,'' of a kinematic chain is the number of parameters that define the configuration of the chain.&lt;ref name="McCarthy2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Uicker2003&gt;J. J. Uicker, G. R. Pennock, and J. E. Shigley, 2003, '''Theory of Machines and Mechanisms,''' Oxford University Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;
A system of ''n'' rigid bodies moving in space has ''6n'' degrees of freedom measured relative to a fixed frame.   This frame is included in the count of bodies, so that mobility does not depend on link that forms the fixed frame.  This means the degree-of-freedom of this system is ''M''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;6(''N''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1), where ''N''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 is the number of moving bodies plus the fixed body.

Joints that connect bodies impose constraints.   Specifically, hinges and sliders each impose five constraints and therefore remove five degrees of freedom.  It is convenient to define the number of constraints ''c'' that a joint imposes in terms of the joint's freedom ''f'', where ''c''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;6&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''f''.  In the case of a hinge or slider, which are one degree of freedom joints, have ''f''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 and therefore ''c''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;6&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;5.

The result is that the mobility of a kinematic chain formed from ''n'' moving links and ''j'' joints each with freedom  ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''i''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;...,&amp;nbsp;''j,''  is given by

: &lt;math&gt; M = 6n - \sum_{i=1}^j (6 - f_i) =  6(N-1 - j) + \sum_{i=1}^j  f_i &lt;/math&gt;

Recall that ''N'' includes the fixed link.

==Analysis of kinematic chains==
The constraint equations of a kinematic chain couple the range of movement allowed at each joint to the dimensions of the links in the chain, and form [[algebraic equations]] that are solved to determine the configuration of the chain associated with specific values of input parameters, called [[degrees of freedom (mechanics)|degrees of freedom]].

The constraint equations for a kinematic chain are obtained using [[rigid transformation]]s [Z] to characterize the relative movement allowed at each joint and separate rigid transformations [X] to define the dimensions of each link.   In the case of a serial open chain, the result is a sequence of rigid transformations alternating joint and link transformations from the base of the chain to its end link, which is equated to the specified position for the end link.   A chain of ''n'' links connected in series has the kinematic equations,

: &lt;math&gt;[T] = [Z_1][X_1][Z_2][X_2]\cdots[X_{n-1}][Z_n],\!&lt;/math&gt;

where [''T''] is the transformation locating the end-link—notice that the chain includes a "zeroth" link consisting of the ground frame to which it is attached. These equations are called the [[forward kinematics]] equations of the serial chain.&lt;ref&gt;J. M. McCarthy, 1990, ''Introduction to Theoretical Kinematics,'' MIT Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kinematic chains of a wide range of complexity are analyzed by equating the kinematics equations of serial chains that form loops within the kinematic chain.  These equations are often called ''loop equations''.

The complexity (in terms of calculating the [[forward kinematics|forward]] and [[inverse kinematics]]) of the chain is determined by the following factors:
* Its [[topology]]: a serial chain, a [[parallel manipulator]], a [[tree (graph theory)|tree]] structure, or a [[graph theory|graph]].
* Its [[Euclidean geometry|geometrical]] form: how are neighbouring [[kinematic pair|joints]] spatially connected to each other?

'''Explanation'''

Two or more rigid bodies in space are collectively called a rigid body system. We can hinder the motion of these independent rigid bodies with kinematic constraints. Kinematic constraints are constraints between rigid bodies that result in the decrease of the degrees of freedom of rigid body system.&lt;ref name="Uicker2003"/&gt;

==Synthesis of kinematic chains==
The constraint equations of a kinematic chain can be used in reverse to determine the dimensions of the links from a specification of the desired movement of the system.  This is termed ''kinematic synthesis.''&lt;ref name="Hartenberg1964"&gt;R. S. Hartenberg and J. Denavit, 1964, ''Kinematic Synthesis of Linkages,'' McGraw-Hill, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the most developed formulation of kinematic synthesis is for [[four-bar linkage]]s, which is known as [[Burmester theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Suh, C. H., and Radcliffe, C. W., '''Kinematics and Mechanism Design,''' John Wiley and Sons, New York, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sandor,G.N.,andErdman,A.G.,1984,AdvancedMechanismDesign:AnalysisandSynthesis, Vol. 2. Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, NJ.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, K. H., '''Kinematic Geometry of Mechanisms,''' Oxford Engineering Science Series, 1979&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ferdinand Freudenstein]] is often called the father of modern kinematics for his contributions to the kinematic synthesis of [[Linkage (mechanical)|linkages]] beginning in the 1950s.  His use of the newly developed computer to solve ''Freudenstein's equation'' became the prototype of [[computer-aided design]] systems.&lt;ref name="Hartenberg1964"/&gt;

This work has been generalized to the synthesis of spherical and spatial mechanisms.&lt;ref name="McCarthy2010"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5063">'''Les Automatistes''' were a group of [[Québécois (word)|Québécois]] artistic dissidents from [[Montreal]], [[Quebec]], Canada. The movement was founded in the early 1940s by painter [[Paul-Émile Borduas]]. Les Automatistes were so called because they were influenced by [[Surrealism]] and its theory of [[surrealist automatism|automatism]]. Members included [[Marcel Barbeau]], [[Roger Fauteux]], [[Claude Gauvreau]], [[Jean-Paul Riopelle]], [[Pierre Gauvreau]], [[Fernand Leduc]], [[Jean-Paul Mousseau]], and [[Marcelle Ferron]] and [[Françoise Sullivan]]. 

The movement may have begun with an exhibition Borduas gave in Montreal in 1942. However, les Automatistes were soon being exhibited in [[Paris]] and [[New York City|New York]] also. Though it began as a visual arts group, it also spread to other forms of expression, such as drama, poetry and dance. The title les Automatistes came from journalist [[Tancrède Marcil]] Jr., in a review of their second exhibit in Montreal (February 15 to March 1, 1947), which appeared in ''Le Quartier Latin'' (the [[Université de Montréal]]'s student journal).

In 1948 [[Paul-Émile Borduas|Borduas]] published a collective [[manifesto]] called the [[Refus global]], an important document in the cultural history of Quebec and a declaration of artistic independence and the need for expressive freedoms. Its denunciation of the Catholic Church's authority was particularly scandalous and resulted in the group's public humiliation. This ultimately lead to a kind of martyrdom but was initially devastating. Although the group dispersed soon after the manifesto was published, the movement continues to have influence, and may be considered a forerunner of the [[Quiet Revolution]]. 

Alongside [[Lyrical abstraction|Lyrical Abstract]] painters in France, the Automatistes favoured a fluid, painterly technique over the comparatively reserved, hard-edge abstraction so popular in the U.S. and Eastern Europe at the time. Much like a nonfigurative [[Group of Seven (artists)|Group of Seven]], they were looking to create a distinctively Canadian artistic identity. Heavily influenced by Surrealist manifestos and poetry, their work was largely stream-of-consciousness inspired, believing this to be a truer means of communicating subconscious emotions and sensory experiences; they wanted to be liberated from intention, reason, and any kind of structure, in order to communicate a universal human experience without bias. This resulted in increasingly crude or intuitive methods such as applying paint with palette knives and fingers and painting blindfolded, their efforts contradicting their claims of working without intention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Automatiste Revolution|last = Nasgaard|first = Roald|publisher = D&amp;M Publishers Inc.|year = 2009|isbn = |location = Vancouver, BC|pages = |first2 = Ray|last2 = Ellenwood}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media==
In 1954, the Automatistes were the subject of the NFB/CBC documentary series ''[[On the Spot (Canadian TV series)|On the Spot]]'' in an episode entitled ''Artist in Montreal.''&lt;ref name="Ohayon"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.nfb.ca/2010/04/14/on-the-spot-the-nfb-in-the-early-days-of-television/|title=On the Spot: The NFB in the early days of television|last=Ohayon|first=Albert|date=April 14, 2010|work=NFB.ca|publisher=[[National Film Board of Canada]]|accessdate=15 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9817">'''Limiting similarity''' (informally "limsim") is a concept in [[theoretical ecology]] and [[community ecology]] that proposes the existence of a maximum level of [[ecological niche|niche]] overlap between two given [[species]] that will allow continued coexistence.

This concept is a corollary of the [[competitive exclusion principle]], which states that, controlling for all else, two species competing for exactly the same resources cannot stably coexist. It assumes normally-distributed resource utilization curves ordered linearly along a resource axis, and as such, it is often considered to be an oversimplified model of species interactions. Moreover, it has theoretical weakness, and it is poor at generating real-world predictions or falsifiable hypotheses. Thus, the concept has fallen somewhat out of favor except in didactic settings (where it is commonly referenced), and has largely been replaced by more complex and inclusive theories.

==History==

In 1932, [[Georgii Gause]] created the competitive exclusion principle based on experiments with cultures of [[yeast]] and [[paramecium]].&lt;ref&gt;Gause, GF. 1932. Experimental studies on the struggle for existence. Journal of Experimental Biology 9: 389–402.&lt;/ref&gt;  The principle maintains that two species with the same [[ecological niche]]s cannot stably coexist. That is to say, when two species compete for identical resource access, one will be competitively superior and it will ultimately supplant the other. Over the next half century, limiting similarity slowly emerged as a natural outgrowth of this principle, aiming (but not necessarily succeeding) to be more quantitative and specific.

Noted ecologist and evolutionary biologist [[David Lack]] said retrospectively that he had already begun to mull around with the ideas of limiting similarity as early as the 1940s, but it wasn't until the end of the 1950s that the theory began to be built up and articulated.&lt;ref&gt;Lack, D. 1973. My life as an amateur ornithologist. Ibis 115: 421–434.&lt;/ref&gt; [[G. Evelyn Hutchinson]]'s famous "Homage to Santa Rosalia" was the next foundational paper in the history of the theory. Its subtitle famously asks, "Why are there so many kinds of animals?", and the address attempts to answer this question by suggesting theoretical bounds to speciation and niche overlap. For the purposes of understanding limiting similarity, the key portion of Hutchinson's address is the end where he presents the observation that a seemingly ubiquitous ratio (1.3:1) defines the upper bound of morphological character similarity between closely related species.&lt;ref&gt;Hutchinson, GE. 1959. Homage to Santa Rosalia, or Why are there so many kinds of animals?. The American Naturalist 93(870): 145–159.&lt;/ref&gt; While this so-called ''Hutchinson ratio'' and the idea of a universal limit have been overturned by later research, the address was still foundational to the theory of limiting similarity.

[[Robert MacArthur|MacArthur]] and [[Richard Levins|Levins]] were the first to introduce the term 'limiting similarity' in their 1967 paper. They attempted to lay out a rigorous quantitative basis for the theory using [[probability theory]] and the [[Competitive Lotka–Volterra equations|Lotka–Volterra competition equations]].&lt;ref&gt;MacArthur, R and R Levins. 1967. The Limiting Similarity, Convergence, and Divergence of Coexisting Species. The American Naturalist 101(921): 377–385.&lt;/ref&gt; In doing so, they provided the ultimate theoretical framework on which many subsequent studies were based.

==Theory==

As proposed by MacArthur and Levins in 1967, the theory of limiting similarity is rooted in the Lotka–Volterra competition model. This model describes two or more populations with logistic dynamics, adding in an additional term to account for their biological interactions. Thus for two populations, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;:

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
{dx_1 \over dt} &amp; = r_1x_1\left({K_1-x_1-\alpha_{12}x_2 \over K_1}\right), \\[6pt]
{dx_2 \over dt} &amp; = r_2x_2\left({K_2-x_2-\alpha_{21}x_1 \over K_2}\right).
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where

*''α''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; represents the effect species 2 has on the population of species 1
*''α''&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt; represents the effect species 1 has on the population of species 2
*''dy/dt'' and ''dx/dt'' represent the growth of the two populations with time;
*''K''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''K''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; represent these species’ respective carrying capacities
*''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; represent these species’ respective growth rates

MacArthur and Levins examine this system applied to three populations, also visualized as resource utilization curves, depicted below. In this model, at some upper limit of competition ''α'', between two species ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, the survival of a third species ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; between the other two is not possible. This phenomenon is termed limiting similarity.  Evolutionary, if two species are more similar than some limit ''L'', a third species will converge towards the nearer of the two competitors. If the two species are less similar than some limit ''L'', a third species will evolve an intermediate phenotype.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
[embedded graph: U v R. x1, x2, x3 curves.]

For each resource R, U represents the probability of utilization per unit time by an individual. At some level of overlap between species ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, the survival of a third species ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is no longer possible.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

May&lt;ref&gt;May, R. M. 1973. Stability and Complexity in Model Ecosystems. Princeton: Princeton Univ. Press&lt;/ref&gt; extended this theory when considering species with different carrying capacities, concluding that coexistence was unlikely if the distance between the modes of competing resource utilization curves ''d'' was less than the standard deviation of the curves ''w''.

==Applied examples==

It is of note that the theory of limiting similarity does not easily generate falsifiable predictions about natural phenomenon. However, many studies have tried to test the theory by making the highly suspect assumption that [[character displacement]] can be used as a close proxy for niche incongruence.&lt;ref&gt;Abrams P. 1983. The Theory of Limiting Similarity. Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics 14: 359–376.&lt;/ref&gt; One recent [[paleoecology|paleoecological]] study, for example, used [[fossil]] proxies of [[gastropod]] body size to determine levels of character displacement over 42,500 years during the [[Quaternary]]. They found little evidence of character displacement, and they concluded that "limiting similarity, as seen in both ecological character displacement and community-wide character displacement, is a transient ecological phenomenon rather than a long-term evolutionary process".&lt;ref&gt;Huntley JW, Yanes Y, Kowalewski M, Castillo C, Delgado-Huertas A, Ibanez M, Alonso MR, Ortiz JE and T de Torres. 2008. Testing limiting similarity in Quaternary terrestrial gastropods. Paleobiology 34(3): 378–388.&lt;/ref&gt; Other theoretical and empirical studies tend to find results that similarly play down the strength and role of limiting similarity in ecology and evolution. For example, Abrams (who is prolific on the subject of limiting similarity) and Rueffler find in 2009 that "there is no absolute limit to similarity; there is always some range of mortality rates of one species allowing coexistence, given a fixed mortality of the other species".&lt;ref&gt;Abrams PA and C Rueffler. 2009. Coexistence and limiting similarity of consumer species competing for a linear array of resources. Ecology 90(3): 812–822.&lt;/ref&gt;

What a lot of studies examining limiting similarity find are the weaknesses in the original theory that are addressed below.

==Criticism==

The key weakness of the theory of limiting similarity is that it is highly system specific and thus difficult to test in practice. In actual environments, one resource axis is inadequate and a specific analysis must be done for each given pair of species. In practice it is necessary to take into account:
*individual variations in resource utilization curves within a species and how these should be weighted in calculating a common curve
*whether the resource in question is a present in a deterministic or stochastic distribution and if this changes over time
*effects of intraspecific competition vs interspecific competition
While these complications don't invalidate the concept, they render limiting similarity exceedingly difficult to test in practice and useful for little more than didacticism.  

Furthermore, Hubbell and Foster point out that extinction via competition can take an extremely long time and the importance of limiting similarity in extinction may even be superseded by speciation.&lt;ref&gt;Hubbell, S. P. and Foster, R.B. (1986). Biology, chance, and history and the structure of tropical rain forest tree communities. In: Diamond, J. and Case, T.J. eds. Community ecology. Harper and Row, New York, pp. 314–329.&lt;/ref&gt; Also, from a theoretical standpoint, small changes in carrying capacities can allow for nearly completely overlapping resource utilization curves and in practice carrying capacity can be difficult to determine. Many studies that attempt to explore limiting similarity (including Huntley et al. 2007) resort to examining character displacement as a proxy for niche overlap, which is suspect at best. While a useful-if simple-model, limiting similarity is nearly untestable in reality.

In [[geography]], a '''linear settlement''' is a (normally small to medium-sized) settlement or group of buildings that is formed in a long line.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thesaurus.english-heritage.org.uk/thesaurus_term.asp?thes_no=1&amp;term_no=68988 English heritage thesaurus] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070914043943/http://thesaurus.english-heritage.org.uk/thesaurus_term.asp?thes_no=1&amp;term_no=68988 |date=2007-09-14 }}, 23-05-2013&lt;/ref&gt; Many follow a transport route, such as a road, river, or canal though some form due to physical restrictions, such as coastlines, mountains, hills or valleys. Linear settlements may have no obvious centre, such as a road junction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ngfl-cymru.org.uk/vtc/settlement_wales/eng/Linearsettlemen/ Linear settlements], 23-05-2013&lt;/ref&gt; Linear settlements have a long and narrow shape.

In the case of settlements built along a route, the route predated the settlement, and then the settlement grew up at some way station or feature, growing along the transport route. Often, it is only a single street with houses on either side of the road. [[Mileham]], [[Norfolk]], [[England]] is a good example of this. Later development may add side turnings and districts away from the original main street. Places such as [[Southport]], England developed in this way.

A linear settlement is in contrast with [[ribbon development]], which is the outward spread of an existing [[town]] along a main street.

==Linear villages==
A ''linear village''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/33028%20Outlane geograph, SE0817 : Outlane - a linear village], 23-05-2013&lt;/ref&gt; or a ''chain village''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pg.geo.uj.edu.pl/documents/3189230/4676039/2003_112_161-172.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[village]] that is also a linear settlement.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2224">The '''Margolus–Levitin theorem''', named for [[Norman Margolus]] and [[Lev B. Levitin]], gives a fundamental limit on [[quantum computation]] (strictly speaking on all forms on computation). The processing rate cannot be higher than 6 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;33&lt;/sup&gt; operations per second per [[joule]] of energy. Or stating the bound for one bit:

:A quantum system of energy ''E'' needs at least a time of &lt;math&gt;\frac{h}{4 E}&lt;/math&gt; to go from one state to an orthogonal state, where ''h'' is [[Planck's constant]] (6.626 &amp;times; 10&lt;sup&gt;−34&lt;/sup&gt; [[joule|J]]·[[second|s]]) and ''E'' is average energy.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2838">'''Description'''
&lt;br&gt;
The Master of Arts in Theological Studies (MATS) satisfies a variety of broad academic and [[vocational]] purposes. It can be suited to the [[pastor]], [[layman]] or beginning academic as an entry level Master's Degree in [[theology]]. It is often geared toward individuals seeking an introductory [[graduate degree]] in religion for service in a supportive role in their local [[Local church|congregation]]. Depending upon the school, the program can vary from as little as 36 [[semester]]/54 quarter hours up to 48 [[semester]]/72 quarter hours typically. It may or may not include a [[thesis]], [http://edglossary.org/capstone-project/ capstone] or summation. Frequently, it is a classwork only degree.

'''Programs of Study'''
&lt;br&gt;
The degree may take several differing forms such as:
M.A.T.S. (General [[theology]] degree non-specified)
[[Biblical Studies]]
[[Systematic Theology]]
[[Old Testament]]
[[New Testament]]
[[Historical Theology]]
[[Christian Apologetics]]

'''[[Accreditation]]'''
&lt;br&gt;
The Master of Arts in Theological Studies is a degree recognized by [http://www2.ed.gov/admins/finaid/accred/accreditation_pg6.html accrediting agencies] such as the [[Association of Theological Schools|ATS]] ([[Association of Theological Schools]]), [[Transnational Association of Christian Colleges and Schools|TRACS]] ([[Transnational Association of Christian Colleges and Schools|the Transnational Association of Christian Colleges and Schools]]), the [[Association for Biblical Higher Education|ABHE]] ([[Association for Biblical Higher Education]]) and other accrediting bodies. It is classified as a Category D: Basic Program Oriented Toward General Theological Studies&lt;ref&gt;http://docs.ats.edu/uploads/accrediting/documents/accrediting-standards-architecture.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[Association of Theological Schools in the United States and Canada|ATS]] ([[Association of Theological Schools]]).

'''Degree Status'''
&lt;br&gt;
While requiring only about 1/2 to 2/3 of the credit hours that are required of a [[Master of Divinity|M.Div]] ([[Master of Divinity]]), it is generally considered equal as a prerequisite for entering advanced degree programs such as for an [[Master of Sacred Theology|STM]] ([[Master of Sacred Theology]]) or [[Doctor of Philosophy|doctoral studies]]. However, the student will likely be required to know (or learn remedially) [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Hebrew]], [[Latin]], [[German language|German]] or another [[modern language]] in order to enter an advanced degree program if they haven't learned these yet.

In 2015, with 767.355 visitors, The Royal Fine Arts Museum of Belgium was considered as the 82th museum in the world (Top 100 Art Museum Attendance).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=The Art Newspaper|first=|date=April 2016|title=Visitor figures 2015 - The grand totals: exhibition and museum attendance numbers worldwide|url=http://www.museus.gov.br/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Visitor-Figures-2015-LO.pdf|journal=The Art Newspaper|volume=278|pages=15|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[2016 Brussels bombings|bombing attack in Brussels in March 2016]], the museum lost 40% of its attendance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lachambre.be/kvvcr/showpage.cfm?section=qrva&amp;language=fr&amp;cfm=qrvaXml.cfm?legislat=54&amp;dossierID=54-b097-903-0399-2016201712798.xml|title=La Chambre des représentants de Belgique|website=www.lachambre.be|access-date=2018-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2016, the institution rebuilt its position.

== Work ==
Michel Draguet studied [[Art history|Art History]] at [[Université libre de Bruxelles]] from 1983 to 1987. In 1987, he gets his master's degree in Art History and Archeology with a dissertation related to ''"The Concept of Space in the roots of Abstract Art : Kandinsky, Mondran, Malévitch"''. This dissertation won the Masui Prise in 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://users.skynet.be/fondation.masui/|title=FONDATION|website=users.skynet.be|access-date=2018-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Interiors of the Royal Museums of Fine Arts in Belgium 01.JPG|alt=The main hall of the Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium|thumb|305x305px|The main hall of the Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium]]From 1989 to 1993, Michel Draguet was a Research Fellow at the [[National Fund for Scientific Research|Belgian National Fund for Scientific Research]] (FNRS).

In 1990, Michel Draguet gets his PhD (''Origins of Abstract Art from Kandinsky to Malévitch (1911—1918)'') with the Greatest distinction. From 1993 to 1995, Michel Draguet is a Postdoctoral Researcher at the [[National Fund for Scientific Research|Belgian National Fund for Scientific Research]] (FNRS).

=== Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium ===
[[File:Musées Royaux des Beaux-Arts Belgique 1101.jpg|thumb|353x353px|Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium]]
The Museums’ collections trace the history of the visual arts – painting, sculpture and drawing – from the 15th to the 21st centuries. They preserve the works of the [[Flemish primitives|Flemish Primitives]], of [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Pieter Bruegel]], [[Peter Paul Rubens]], [[Jacob Jordaens|Jacques Jordaens]], [[Jacques-Louis David|Jacques Louis David]], [[Auguste Rodin]], [[James Ensor]], [[Paul Gauguin]], [[Fernand Khnopff]], [[Henry Moore]], [[Paul Delvaux]], [[René Magritte]], [[Marcel Broodthaers]], [[Jan Fabre]] and many others. This jewel among Belgium's cultural institutions comprises several entities: the [[Oldmasters Museum|Musée Old Masters Museum]], the Musée Modern Museum, the [[Wiertz Museum|Musée Wiertz Museum]] and the [[Constantin Meunier|Musée Meunier Museum]], the [[Magritte Museum|Musée Magritte Museum]] and the [[Fin-de-Siècle Museum|Musée Fin-de-Siècle Museum]].

Michel Draguet repositioned the [[Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium]] nationally as well as internationally through a redeployment of the collection focused on the specificity of Belgian creation as well as on the particularity of Belgian reception of European creation.

In 2009, he created the [[Magritte Museum]] with, for the first time in Belgium, a private-public partnership (with [[Engie|GDF-Suez]]) on competencies. The selection of works exhibited in the [[Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium]] is constantly expanding with a changing selection of external loans. With the support of Belgian and foreign museums as well as private collectors, works are being made available that have previously never been exhibited. The visitor can thus discover many treasures that are still in private possession. Since its creation, this museum, measuring 2500 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, has welcomed more than two million visitors and thus contributed to the economic and cultural development of the Belgian capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.lalibre.be/debats/ripostes/brandir-l-importance-economique-de-la-culture-pour-la-defendre-544aa05a3570fe7cfbf80d01|title=Brandir l'importance économique de la culture pour la défendre ?|last=Libre.be|first=La|access-date=2018-05-09|language=fr}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Magritte Museum]] has already received 8 nominations and prizes. Every year more than 300,000 visitors come here from all over the world to discover the life and the works of [[René Magritte]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.musee-magritte-museum.be/uploads/pages/files/magritte_museum_key_figures_2009_2017.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:BRX-musée-magritte.3.JPG|alt=Magritte Museum|thumb|277x277px|Magritte Museum]]
In 2013, Michel Draguet inaugurated the [[Fin-de-Siècle Museum|Fin-de-siècle Museum]] as first chapter of a new conception of a museum of Modern Art. Famous visual artists like [[Constantin Meunier]], [[James Ensor]], [[Henri Evenepoel]], [[Fernand Khnopff]], [[Léon Spilliaert]] and [[George Minne|Georges Minne]] testify to the effervescent activity of this period, reflected also in all other creative fields: literature, opera, music, architecture, photography and poetry ([[Maurice Maeterlinck]], [[Émile Verhaeren|Emile Verhaeren]], [[Octave Maus]], [[Victor Horta]], [[Henry van de Velde|Henry Van de Velde]], [[Maurice Kufferath]], [[Guillaume Lekeu]] and others). [[Art Nouveau]] architecture is evoked by means of a 3D reconstruction of six buildings Art Nouveau. This was the first introduction of new technologies inside de Museum. Located at the heart of Brussels, where between 1884 and 1914 the exhibitions of ''Les XX'' and ''La Libre Esthétique'' made the city one of the artistic capitals of the late 19th century, this museum is distinguished by its multidisciplinary nature, through a partnership formed with the [[Royal Library of Belgium|Royal Library]], the [[La Monnaie|Théâtre Royal de la Monnaie]], the [[Royal Museums of Art and History]], [[Cinematek]], the [[Bibliotheca Wittockiana]], the [[King Baudouin Foundation]] and the [[Brussels Capital Region]] for housing the Gillion Crowet collection, which is one of the museum's highlights.The [[Fin-de-Siècle Museum]], which was applauded internationally when it opened,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lepoint.fr/culture/belgique-bruxelles-s-offre-un-musee-fin-de-siecle-06-12-2013-1765553_3.php&lt;/ref&gt; welcomed 170,000 visitors during its first operating year.

Michel Draguet also initiate a highly popular yet challenging exhibition program from ancient masters to contemporary art mounting up to eight major shows per year. The quality and quantity of this program has been supported by a renewing strategy to the public in its diversity. In this way, Draguet initiate “Museum on measure”: a program dedicated to fragilized public supported by charity.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.article27.be/IMG/pdf/accompagner_les_publics_socialement_fragilises_au_musees_2013.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In parallel, the educational services have developed a range of new activities and the social programs have been extended. This is a result of the increase in partnerships between the public and private sectors .

Among the highlights of the programme have been large exhibitions such as “Art Nouveau Bing”, “Rubens in Brussels”, “CoBrA”, “Alechinsky”, “Leon Spilliaert” “Jordaens and Antiquity”, “The Flemish Primitives in  Brussels”, “Andres Serrano”, “Marc Chagall”, “Kandinsky and Europe”, “Symbolism in Belgium” and “Stanley Kubrick Photographer”. Michel Draguet introduced also a wide spectrum of new exhibition formats with from small “cabinet exhibitions” on such artists Pierre Lahaut, [[Jules Schmalzigaug]], [[Hiroshi Sugimoto]], and others. He placed permanent installation of contemporary artist inside the [[Oldmasters Museum|OldMasters]] department like [[David Altmejd]] or [[Jan Fabre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fine-arts-museum.be/en/the-collection|title=The collection – Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium|website=www.fine-arts-museum.be|language=en|access-date=2018-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For many years now, the [[Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium]]  has been the most popular art institution in Belgium. In 2015, the Museum had its best attended year so far with a total of 767.355 visitors.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.museus.gov.br/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Visitor-Figures-2015-LO.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; This strategy was accompanied by a significant increase in corporate funding. From 2005 until 2017, the number of visitors has doubled and the turnover tripled, thereby reducing the State contribution from 54.4% of the global budget to 32%. And this has been achieved during a period of very severe budgetary cuts: 11% in 2013 and 2014, 30% for the period 2015-2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.lejournaldesarts.fr/michel-draguet-reconduit-la-direction-des-musees-royaux-des-beaux-arts-de-belgique-132655|title=Michel Draguet reconduit à la direction des Musées royaux des beaux-arts de Belgique - 28 avril 2017 - lejournaldesarts.fr|website=Le Journal Des Arts|language=fr|access-date=2018-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The online and digital outreach of the [[Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium]] is considered as pioneer. In this perspective, Draguet initiated the ''[https://www.fine-arts-museum.be/en/exhibitions/bruegel-unseen-masterpieces Bruegel. Unseen Masterpieces]'' project which allows members of the public to delve into the works of [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]] († Brussels, 1569). While the artist and his paintings are instantly recognizable worldwide, every composition also depicts a whole host of characters - some surprising, others familiar - and vignettes that provide the subtext of history, which are masterpieces worthy of exploration in their own right.

Drawing on a wide spectrum of virtual and on-site experiences, this unique initiative offers everyone the chance to immerse themselves in Bruegel’s works by honing in on the details of each painting and accessing expert knowledge. By delving deeper into the artist’s world, the viewer will discover the unexpected elements in Bruegel’s works which constitute the pinnacle of the Flemish master’s craft. The [[Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium]] launched this project jointly with the [[Google Cultural Institute]] in anticipation of the 450thanniversary of [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder|Bruegel]]’s death, in 2019. The project brings together major international museums, many of which are European, around the focal figure of Bruegel the Elder. This innovative concept is the fruit of in-depth thinking on current transformations in the field of museology as it adapts to the digital era.

The ''[https://www.fine-arts-museum.be/en/exhibitions/bruegel-unseen-masterpieces Bruegel. Unseen Masterpieces]'' virtual exhibitions' can be accessed on the [[Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium]]’s interactive screens, on their mobile app and on the [[Google Cultural Institute]] platform.

=== Royal Museums of Art and History ===
[[File:Park of the Cinquantenaire - Royal Museums of Art and History, Brussels, 2010 (HDR 1).jpg|thumb|339x339px|Royal Museums of Art and History of Belgium]]
From 1st August 2010 till 28 February 2014, Michel Draguet was designated temporary Director-General of the [[Royal Museums of Art and History]].&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This entity includes the [[Cinquantenaire Museum|Museum of Antiquities]], the Museum of Non-European Civilizations, the Museum of the Decorative Arts, the Chinese Pavilion, the Japanese Tower, [[Halle Gate]], and the [[Musical Instrument Museum (Brussels)|Museum of Musical Instruments]].

He was charged to manage this institution, which was then in crisis, to overhaul its accounts and structure. Under his leading, the museum put together a restructuring plan that, starting with the merging of the support staff, created enough flexibility to allow modernization of the administrative organizations of both entities – the [[Royal Museums of Art and History]] and [[Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium|Royal Museums of Fine Arts]].

Michel Draguet initiated a large project of redeployment of both institutions. The home of the former would house collections of a more universalist nature, on the model of the [[Louvre]] and [[British Museum]], and that of the latter would offer a more “national” foundation that broadens to embrace a European dynamic comprising the very future of Brussels as the capital of what is today a common space. From there came the idea of redeploying the collections in accordance with two guidelines: first, to bring the federal collections together in one place; second, to develop theme-based museums that complement rather than compete with one another.

Together the [[Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium|Royal Museums of Fine Arts]] and [[Royal Museums of Art and History|Art and History]] welcome more than 1.1 million visitors a year: this is the equivalent of the population of Brussels. Merged, the two institutions would increase their attractiveness to the public: by reorganizing the presentation of the collections between the different institutions; by creating poles of scientific excellence based on the strong points of the collections; by creating new museum entities that offer a new dimension for marketing the city of Brussels; and by rationalizing the teams and practices employed. For the [[Royal Museums of Art and History]], the entities proposed are as follows : a Museum of Non-European Civilizations, which would initially be a world museum through the eyes of Europeans, on the basis of which a new intercultural dialogue could be initiated; a Museum of Antiquities as a platform for the European identity; and a Museum of Music that will broaden the perspectives of the current [[Musical Instrument Museum (Brussels)|Museum of Musical Instruments]]. Plus a few heritage assets – the Chinese Pavilion, the Japanese Tower and [[Halle Gate]] – which contribute to the attractiveness of the city.

His plan for redeployment of both the collections and personnel that would culminate in the fusion of the two entities was discussed at the Belgian Parliament in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.dekamer.be/kvvcr/showpage.cfm?section=qrva&amp;language=fr&amp;cfm=qrvaXml.cfm?legislat=53&amp;dossierID=53-b054-669-0249-2011201205948.xml&lt;/ref&gt; Without initiative from the politics and considering that his Secretary of State was not supporting the reforme led by him and by the Chairman of [[BELSPO|Belspo]] [http://plus.wikimonde.com/wiki/Philippe_Mettens Philippe Mettens], Michel Draguet decided to step down in April 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dekamer.be/kvvcr/showpage.cfm?section=qrva&amp;language=fr&amp;cfm=qrvaXml.cfm?legislat=53&amp;dossierID=53-b054-669-0249-2011201205948.xml|title=La Chambre des représentants de Belgique|website=www.dekamer.be|access-date=2018-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14052">In contemporary art, '''monumental sculpture''' is large sculpture regardless of purpose, carrying a sense of permanent, solid, objects, rather than the temporary or fragile assemblages used in much contemporary sculpture. In ancient and medieval sculpture, size is normally taken as the criterion for definition, although smaller architectural sculptures may also be labelled monumental sculpture. In the [[Early Modern period]] a specific funerary function may be attributed to monumental sculpture.

Historically monumental sculpture (using the size criterion) in a culture, is regarded as of great significance. A culture may cease to produce monumental sculpture due to [[societal collapse]] or [[aniconism]], usually religiously motivated.[[File:Moissac Abbaye portail sud.jpg|thumb|[[Romanesque art|Romanesque]] portal of [[Moissac]] Abbey; a classic example of what is meant by "monumental sculpture" in ancient and medieval art history.]]
[[File:Venezia - Chiesa dei SS. Giovanni e Paolo (S. Zanipolo) - Foto G. Dall'Orto 2 lug 2006 - 08.jpg|thumb|Medieval and Renaissance wall tombs in [[Santi Giovanni e Paolo, Venice]]. In discussing the [[Early Modern period]], the term may mean specifically sculptures that are [[memorial]]s.]]

==Defining ''monumental''==
The term ''monumental sculpture'' is often used in [[art history]] and [[Art criticism|criticism]], but not always consistently. It combines two concepts, one of function, and one of size, and may include an element of a third more subjective concept. It is often used for all sculptures that are large. Human figures that are perhaps half life-size or above would usually be considered monumental in this sense by art historians,&lt;ref&gt;For example, none of the figures in sculptures at the [[Santo Domingo de Silos Abbey]] are larger than this, and they are described by [[Meyer Schapiro]] as "one of the largest groups of monumental carving in Spanish [[Romanesque art]]". Schapiro, 29&lt;/ref&gt; although in [[contemporary art]] a rather larger overall scale is implied.  Monumental sculpture is therefore distinguished from small portable [[figurine]]s, small metal or [[ivory]] [[relief]]s, [[diptych]]s and the like.

It is also used of sculpture that is architectural in function, especially if used to create or form part of a [[monument]] of some sort, and therefore capitals and reliefs attached to buildings will be included, even if small in size. Typical functions of monuments are as grave markers, [[tomb monument]]s or [[memorial]]s, and expressions of the power of a ruler or community, to which churches and so religious statues are added by convention, although in some contexts monumental sculpture may specifically mean just [[funerary art|funerary]] sculpture for [[church architecture|church monuments]].  A related idea is that of permanence, emphasized in some discussions of the term.&lt;ref&gt;Gilibert, 2-4&lt;/ref&gt;

The third concept that may be involved when the term is used is not specific to sculpture, as the other two essentially are.  The entry for "Monumental" in "A Dictionary of Art and Artists" by [[Peter Murray (art historian)|Peter and Linda Murray]] describes it as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=Monumental|title=A Dictionary of Art and Artists|edition=Revised|publisher=Penguin|year=1968|author=Peter and Linda Murray}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"The most overworked word in current art history and criticism.  It is intended to convey the idea that a particular work of art, or part of such a work, is grand, noble, elevated in idea, simple in conception and execution, without any excess of virtuousity, and having something of the enduring, stable, and timeless nature of great architecture. ... It is not a synonym for 'large'.&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

However, this does not constitute an accurate or adequate description of the use of the term for sculpture, though many uses of the term that essentially mean either large or "used in a memorial" may involve this concept also, in ways that are hard to separate.  For example, when [[Meyer Schapiro]], after a chapter analysing the carved capitals at [[Moissac]], says: "in the [[Tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] of the south portal [''(right)''] the sculpture of Moissac becomes truly monumental.  It is placed above the level of the eye, and is so large as to dominate the entire entrance.  It is a gigantic semi-circular relief ...",&lt;ref&gt;Schapiro, 201&lt;/ref&gt; size is certainly the dominant part of what he means by the word, and Schapiro's further comments suggest that a lack of "excess of virtuousity" does not form part of what he intends to convey.  Nonetheless, parts of the Murray's concept ("grand, noble, elevated in idea") are included in his meaning, although "simple in conception and execution" hardly seems to apply.

==Meaning in different contexts==
The term 'Monumental Sculptures' has acquired various meanings over the years, but these different meanings have not caused much difficulty in classification, as the various interpretations incorporate the changing nature of sculptures through temporal and spacial landscapes in this category.&lt;ref&gt;The Getty [http://www.getty.edu/vow/AATFullDisplay?find=monumental&amp;logic=AND&amp;note=&amp;english=N&amp;prev_page=1&amp;subjectid=300073760 Art &amp; Architecture Thesaurus Online] definition only refers to "Very large, comparable to a typical monument in massiveness", but the notes below on the many reference works consulted give a range of different emphases on size and function.&lt;/ref&gt;  The term may be used differently for different periods in history, with breaks occurring around the [[Renaissance]] and the early 20th century. The ancient and medieval sculpture size is normally taken as the criterion for definition, although smaller architectural sculptures can also be addressed by the term. In the [[Early Modern period]] a specific funerary function may have been meant, but the meaning of size was once again adopted while referring to contemporary sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;For examples, concerned with funerary sculpture only are:''The Silent Rhetoric of the Body A History of Monumental Sculpture and Commemorative Art in England, 1720–1770'', by Matthew Craske, Yale UP, {{ISBN|0-300-13541-6}}, {{ISBN|978-0-300-13541-1}} [http://www.yalebooks.co.uk/yale/display.asp?K=9780300135411&amp;bic=AFKB&amp;sort=SORT_DATE/d&amp;ds=Sculpture&amp;m=9&amp;dc=44]{{dead link|date=March 2018|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}, and several of the titles covered on the [http://www.churchmonumentssociety.org/newfile30.htm bibliography page] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090101112536/http://www.churchmonumentssociety.org/newfile30.htm |date=2009-01-01 }} of the website of the Church Monuments Society. For contemporary sculpture, see the [[New York Times]] of August 30, 1981, [https://www.nytimes.com/1981/08/30/nyregion/art-art-s-role-in-government-architecture-is-explore.html "Arts role in government architecture is explore"] by Helen Harrison. All accessed April 29, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The relevant chapters in Parts 2-4 of ''The Oxford History of Western Art'' are titled as follows: "Monumental Sculpture to c.1300", "Monumental Sculpture 1300–1600", "Free-standing Sculpture c.1600–c.1700", "Forms in Space c.1700–1770", "Sculptures and Publics" (1770–1914)[http://www.oup.com/uk/catalogue/?ci=9780192804150 OUP Catalogue]{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In art history==

===Appearance of monumental sculpture in a culture===
In [[archeology]] and art history the appearance, and sometimes disappearance, of monumental sculpture (using the size criterion) in a culture, is regarded as of great significance, though tracing the emergence is often complicated by the presumed existence of sculpture in wood and other perishable materials of which no record remains;&lt;ref&gt;See for example Martin Robertson, ''A shorter history of Greek art'', p. 9, Cambridge University Press, 1981, {{ISBN|0-521-28084-2}}, {{ISBN|978-0-521-28084-6}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=BoUsvD1_VNQC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;dq=%22monumental+sculpture%22&amp;ei=iiL3SbqpFZS6M8Hm0eQD Google books]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[totem pole]] is an example of a tradition of monumental sculpture in wood that would leave no traces for archaeology.  The ability to summon the resources to create monumental sculpture, by transporting usually very heavy materials and arranging for the payment of what are usually regarded as full-time sculptors, is considered a mark of a relatively advanced culture in terms of social organization.
[[File:Nim Li Punit stela.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Maya stela]]]]

In [[Ancient Egypt]], the [[Great Sphinx of Giza]] probably dates to the 3rd millennium BC and may be older than the [[Pyramids of Egypt]].  Recent unexpected discoveries of Ancient Chinese [[bronze age]] figures at [[Sanxingdui]], some more than twice human size, have disturbed many ideas held about early Chinese civilization, since only much smaller bronzes were previously known.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nga.gov/education/chinatp_san.shtm NGA, Washington] feature on exhibition.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some undoubtedly advanced cultures, such as the [[Indus Valley civilization]], appear to have had no monumental sculpture at all, though producing very sophisticated figurines and seals.  The [[Mississippian culture]] seems to have progressing towards its use, with small stone figures, when it collapsed.  Other cultures, such as Ancient Egypt and the [[History of Easter Island|Easter Island culture]], seem to have devoted enormous resources to very large-scale monumental sculpture from a very early stage&lt;ref&gt;Bruce G. Trigger, "Monumental Architecture: A Thermodynamic Explanation of Symbolic Behaviour Author", World Archaeology, vo.22, no.2, 1990, pp.119-132. &lt;/ref&gt;.

===Disappearance of monumental sculpture===
There may be a number of reasons why a culture ceases to produce monumental sculpture. The most common is [[societal collapse]], as occurred in Europe during the so-called [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]] or the [[Classic Maya collapse]] in [[Mesoamerica]].  Another may be [[aniconism]], usually religiously motivated, as followed the [[Muslim conquests]].  Both the rise of Christianity (initially) and later the [[Protestant Reformation]] brought a halt to religious monumental sculpture in the regions concerned, and greatly reduced production of any monumental sculpture for several centuries.&lt;ref&gt; Post, Chandler Rathfon, A History of European and American Sculpture: From the Early Christian Period to the Present Day, Volume l, Harvard University Press, London, 1921 p. 248&lt;/ref&gt; [[Byzantine art]], which had largely avoided the societal collapse in the [[Western Roman Empire]], never resumed the use of monumental figurative sculpture, whether in religious or secular contexts, and was to ban even two-dimensional religious art for a period in the [[Byzantine iconoclasm]].

==Contemporary work==
Monumental sculpture is still used within the stoneworking and funeral trades to cover all forms of grave headstones and other funerary art, regardless of size.  In contemporary art, however, it is used to refer to all large sculptures regardless of purpose, and also carries a sense of permanent, solid, objects, rather than the temporary or fragile assemblages used in much contemporary sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;See for example, several uses of the term in [http://www.sculpture.org.uk/blog/monumentally-virtual-ephemerally-physical-directions-in-new-sculpture-and-new-media "Monumentally Virtual, Ephemerally Physical: Directions in new sculpture and new media"], blogpost by Joseph Taylor McRae, Lecturer in Computer Games Arts and editor of Art/Games Journal, published on May 25th, 2016, by the [[Cass Sculpture Foundation]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Sculptures covered by the term in modern art are likely to be over two metres in at least one dimension, and sufficiently large not to need a high [[plinth]], though they may have one.  Many are still commissioned as [[public art]], often for placing at outdoor sites.

Based at the [[Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute]], the project uses [[knockout mice]] most of which were generated by the [[International Knockout Mouse Consortium]]. For each mutant line, groups of seven male and seven female mice move through a standard analysis pipeline aimed at detecting traits that differ from healthy [[C57BL/6]] mice.&lt;ref name="pmid22961258"/&gt; The pipeline collects many measurements of viability, fertility, body weight, infection, hearing, morphology, haematology, behaviour, blood chemistry and immunity and compares them to [[wild type]] [[Scientific control|controls]] using a statistical [[mixed model]].&lt;ref name="pmid23300663"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Karp NA, Melvin D, Mott RF |title=Robust and sensitive analysis of mouse knockout phenotypes |journal=[[PLoS ONE]] |volume=7 |issue=12 |pages=e52410 |year=2012 |pmid=23300663 |pmc=3530558 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0052410 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These data are immediately shared among the scientific and medical research community through a bespoke [[open access]] database,&lt;ref name=portal&gt;[http://www.sanger.ac.uk/mouseportal/ Mouse Resources Portal], [[Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute]].&lt;/ref&gt; and summaries are displayed in other online resources, including the [[Mouse Genome Informatics]] database and the Wikipedia-based [[Gene Wiki]].&lt;ref name="pmid23870131"/&gt;

As of July 2013, the MGP reports having over 900 mutant lines openly available to the international research community,&lt;ref name="pmid23870131"/&gt; and have "substantively complete" analysis for over 650 mutant lines,&lt;ref name=portal/&gt; of which over 75 per cent have at least one abnormal phenotype.&lt;ref name="pmid22961258"/&gt; Among these are new discoveries of genes implicated in disease, including finding:

'''New media studies''' is a relatively young academic discipline that explores the intersections of computing, science, the humanities, and the visual and performing arts. [[Janet Murray]], a prominent researcher in the discipline, describes this intersection as "a single new medium of representation, the digital medium, formed by the braided interplay of technical invention and cultural expression at the end of the 20th century". The main factor in defining [[new media]] is the role the Internet plays; new media is effortlessly spread instantly. The category of new media is occupied by devices connected to the Internet, an example being a smartphone or tablet. Television and cinemas are commonly thought of as new media but are ruled out since the invention was before the time of the internet.

New media studies examines ideas and insights on media from communication theorists, programmers, educators, and technologists. Among others, the work of [[Marshall McLuhan]] is viewed as one of the cornerstones of the study of media theory. McLuhan’s slogan, "[[the medium is the message]]" (elaborated in his 1964 book, ''[[Understanding Media: The Extensions of Man]]''),&lt;ref&gt;Originally published in 1964 by Mentor, New York; reissued 1994, MIT Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts with an introduction by [[Lewis H. Lapham|Lewis Lapham]]&lt;/ref&gt; calls attention to the intrinsic effect of communications media.

A program in new media studies may incorporate lessons, classes, and topics within [[communication]], [[journalism]], [[computer science]], [[Computer programming|programming]], [[graphic design]], [[web design]], [[human-computer interaction]], [[media theory]], [[linguistics]], [[information science]], and other related fields. 

New media studies is the academic discipline which examines how our relationship with media has changed with the onset of global connectivity and the popularity of digital and user generated content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Manovich|first1=Lev|title=The Practice of Everyday (Media) Life|jstor=10.1086/596645|website=Chicago Journals|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|ref=The Practice of Everyday (Media) Life}}&lt;/ref&gt; New media studies seeks to connect [[computer sciences]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Manovich|first1=Lev|title=Culture Software|url=http://manovich.net/content/04-projects/070-cultural-software/67-article-2011.pdf|website=manovich.net|accessdate=9 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and innovations in [[new media]] with [[social sciences]] and the [[philosophy of technology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Murray|first1=Janet H.|title=Toward a Cultural Theory of Gaming|url=http://homes.lmc.gatech.edu/~murray/PC0403_Murray.pdf|website=Georgia Tech|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, Inc.|accessdate=9 October 2015|ref=Toward a Cultural Theory of Gaming}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Major figures ===
[[Marshall McLuhan]] is known in the study of media theory for coining the phrase, "[[the medium is the message]]" in its effect in communication in media. The medium affects how the media is delivered by the person and how the other person is receiving that media, while the characteristics of the medium effects the content in its delivery. McLuhan’s work challenged how media changed in the post-modern era which can also relate to present day use of media and its medium. Interface is defined as the common boundary of 2 bodies, spaces, or phases. Other Major works that also invoke his standpoint in the study of New Media including:

* ''[[The Mechanical Bride]]'' (1951) - Which includes many short essays that analyze forms of media such as advertising, or newspaper in relation to society.
* ''[[The Gutenberg Galaxy]]'' (1962) - In this book, McLuhan Writes about technology like the printing press or electronic media changing how people share stories in their day-to-day lives.

[[Lev Manovich]] has written books on the topic of new media, and according to his personal page "has appeared on the top 25 people shaping the Future of Design,"  He has published nine different books regarding the topic of new media. Manovich believes in the five general principles of new media, as he discusses in his 2001 book, ''The Language of New Media'' they are:

* Numerical Representation: essentially means that "all new media objects can be described mathematically and can be manipulated via algorithms."&lt;ref name = "Sorapure"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Five Priniciples of New Media: Or, Playing Lev Manovich|url = http://kairos.technorhetoric.net/8.2/coverweb/sorapure/|website = Kairos|accessdate = 2016-01-05|last = Sorapure|first = Madeleine|issn = 1521-2300}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Modularity: are "elements can that be independently modified and reused in other works".&lt;ref name="Sorapure" /&gt;
* Automation: "Automation is seen in computer programs that allow users to create or modify media objects using templates or algorithms".&lt;ref name="Sorapure" /&gt;
* Variability:  is "a new media object is not something fixed once and for all, but something that can exist in different, potentially infinite versions".&lt;ref name="Sorapure" /&gt;
* Transcoding: Designates the blend of computer and culture, of "traditional ways in which human culture modeled the world and the computer's own means of representing it".&lt;ref name="Sorapure" /&gt;
[[Henry Jenkins]] came up with the convergence culture in the field on new media studies: "By convergence, I mean the flow of content across multiple media platforms, the cooperation between multiple media industries, and the migratory behavior of media audiences who would go almost anywhere in search of the kinds of entertainment experiences they wanted."

[[Janet Murray]] is a professor at the School of Literature, Media, and Communications at the Georgia Institute of Technology. Murray is also a part of several design projects such as; a digital edition of the [[Warner Bros.|Warner Brothers]] classic, [[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]. Janet works exclusively as a member of Georgia Tech's experimental game lab. Janet is also the author of the book ''Hamlet on the Holodeck; The Future of Narrative in Cyberspace''. Along with this book, she is also a guest writer in ''The New Media Reader,'' where she is credited for writing one of the two introductions in the book called, ''Inventing the Medium''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Inventing the Medium|url = https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/inventing-medium|website = MIT Press|accessdate = 2015-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Hamlet on the Holodeck; The Future of Narrative in Cyberspace'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Inventing the Digital Medium: An Interview with Janet Murray (Part One)|url = http://henryjenkins.org/2012/02/an_interview_with_janet_murray.html|website = henryjenkins.org|accessdate = 2015-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Murray asks whether the computer can provide the basis for an expressive narrative form. The book acts as a textbook. It is designed to help designers in training develop a greater sense of understanding towards digital media. This book is also a theory of media change over the years. It really goes into depth on the relationship between technology and culture. Murray has ideas with a unique spin on them. She offers new thoughts and theories on new media studies, and this is what led to her being such a successful author.&lt;ref&gt;http://henryjenkins.org/2006/06/welcome_to_convergence_culture.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effects of technology ==
In an article from the [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]] (NCBI), there was a study involving a virtual reality environment that simulated ATM training for persons with acquired brain injury. Their conclusion of this study proves that virtual reality can be a useful tool in which it could easily be accessed online. Basically this helped conveniently providing training opportunities almost anywhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Usability of a virtual reality environment simulating an automated teller machine for assessing and training persons with acquired brain injury|journal = Journal of NeuroEngineering and Rehabilitation|date = 2010-04-30|issn = 1743-0003|pmc = 2881048|pmid = 20429955|pages = 19|volume = 7|doi = 10.1186/1743-0003-7-19|first = Kenneth NK|last = Fong|first2 = Kathy YY|last2 = Chow|first3 = Bianca CH|last3 = Chan|first4 = Kino CK|last4 = Lam|first5 = Jeff CK|last5 = Lee|first6 = Teresa HY|last6 = Li|first7 = Elaine WH|last7 = Yan|first8 = Asta TY|last8 = Wong}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a book called ''Critical Terms for Media Studies'', the author illustrates his take on new media in technology: "technology---a focus on the mechanical aspects of media and the way that innovations and inventions transform the condition of both individual and social experience."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Critical Terms for Media Studies, the introduction|url = http://www.press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/532554.html|website = www.press.uchicago.edu|accessdate = 2016-01-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Terminology ==
* Strategies vs Tactics - The term strategies refers to the methods a producer intended for their creation to be used. The term tactics is referring to the ways individuals actually utilize a creation, regardless of the creators intentions, in order to make it more useful to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Practice of Everyday (Media) Life: From Mass Consumption to Mass Cultural Production?|jstor = 10.1086/596645|journal = Critical Inquiry|date = 2009-01-01|pages = 319–331|volume = 35|issue = 2|doi = 10.1086/596645|first = By|last = Lev Manovich}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[wiktionary:hypermediated|Hypermediated]] - Hypermediation is a concept in new media studies that refers to a form of [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/mediate mediation] in which media is connected in a very close way.  Mediation, in this sense, deals with using indirect sources to create a direct connection between different types of media.  This process is often done by the use of [[HTML|hypertext]] and through the [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/networked Networked] approach to new media.  An example of hypermediation would be an online shopper who buys a particular item, then in turn gets links to related items, then articles related to those items etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Hypermediated?|url = https://www.englishforums.com/English/Hypermediated/nwpnn/post.htm|website = www.englishforums.com|accessdate = 2015-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Hypermediation: Commerce as Clickstream|url = http://www.nicholascarr.com/?page_id=134|website = Nicholas Carr|accessdate = 2015-10-16|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Web 2.0]] - Web 2.0 is the concept of websites geared toward content created by users. Web 2.0 allows the web to be used as a platform. It also enables the users to control their own data. [[Tim O'Reilly]] and Dale Dougherty invented the phrase Web 2.0 at the Media Conference in 2004. Some examples of Web 2.0 are [[AdSense|Google AdSense]], Flickr, [[BitTorrent]], [[Napster]] and [[Wikipedia]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oreilly.com/pub/a/web2/archive/what-is-web-20.html retrieved 2015-10-08&lt;/ref&gt;
*Networking is a term that defines the transformation of old media to new media through communication that enables users to produce or compute material of their own on the internet.  It's a medium that consists of blogs, emails, and social media networks which allows more global connections to reach many to share ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Lister et al. (2009) New Media: A Critical Introduction p. 30-35, Publisher Routledge 2 Parks Square, Milton Park, Abingdon, Oxon Ox14 4Rn Simultaneously published in the USA and Canada&lt;/ref&gt;
*Commodification of Experience - The packaging of human experience in some form to be sold back to the consumer. This is a common term in study of the role new media plays. An example of the top-down ideal. Common examples include cable subscriptions, vacation resort packages, memberships and, more abstractly, one's presence on social media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Commodifying Human Experience: An Interview with Jeremy Rifkin|url = http://www.alternet.org/story/79/commodifying_human_experience%253A_an_interview_with_jeremy_rifkin|newspaper = AlterNet|date = 2000-03-31|access-date = 2015-10-16|first = Tamara|last = Straus}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*Simulation is a term that can be defined as a virtual representation of reality. For example, according to New Media and Visual Culture, virtually, things seem real based on experience, but they are not real because they have not actually happened. French theorist, [[Jean Baudrillard]], believed that simulation was the modern stage of simulacrum.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.success.com/article/old-school-networking-with-new-media-methods retrieved 2015-10-04&lt;/ref&gt;
* Virtual - Lev Manovich describes a [[virtual world]] as an interactive world created by a computer that many people can access at one time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Manovich|first1=Lev|title=Computer as an Illusion Machine|url=http://atc.berkeley.edu/bio/Lev_Manovich/|website=The Art, Technology, and Culture Colloquim|publisher=The University of California|accessdate= 2015-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; A virtual world is an [[interactive]] and [[digital media|digital]] space. Virtual worlds are often created as a [[simulation]] of something which already exists in the physical world.&lt;ref&gt;http://manovich.net/content/04-projects/016-the-aesthetics-of-virtual-worlds/13_article_1996.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

      <comment>/* Examples */ "and sprinted away" is technically not a clause, as it does not contain a subject</comment>

      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4082">In [[grammar]], '''parallelism''', also known as '''parallel structure''' or '''parallel construction''', is a balance within one or more sentences of similar phrases or [[clause]]s that have the same grammatical structure.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gary Blake]] and [[Robert W. Bly]], ''The Elements of Technical Writing'', pg. 71. [[New York City|New York]]: [[Macmillan Publishers (United States)|Macmillan Publishers]], 1993. {{ISBN|0020130856}}&lt;/ref&gt; The application of parallelism affects readability and may make texts easier to process.&lt;ref&gt;For the point about processing, see Carlson, Katy. ''Parallelism and Prosody in the Processing of Ellipsis Sentences''. Routledge, 2002, [https://books.google.com/books?id=lIJ7quEJl8gC&amp;pg=PA4 pp. 4–6].&lt;/ref&gt;

Parallelism may be accompanied by other figures of speech such as [[antithesis]], [[Anaphora (rhetoric)|anaphora]], [[asyndeton]], [[Climax (figure of speech)|climax]], [[epistrophe]], and [[symploce]].&lt;ref name=examples/&gt; 

== Examples ==
Compare the following examples:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Lacking parallelism !! Parallel
|-
| "She likes cooking, jogging, and ''to read''."
| "She likes cooking, jogging, and reading."

"She likes to cook, jog, and read."
|-
| "He likes ''baseball'' and running."
| "He likes playing baseball and running."

"He likes to play baseball and to run."
|-
| "The dog ran across the yard, jumped over the fence, and ''sprinted away''."
| "The dog ran across the yard, jumped over the fence, and sprinted down the alley."
|}

All of the above examples are grammatically correct, even if they lack parallelism: "cooking", "jogging", and "to read" are all grammatically valid conclusions to "She likes", for instance. The first nonparallel example has a mix of [[gerund]]s and [[infinitive]]s. To make it parallel, the sentence can be rewritten with all gerunds or all infinitives. The second example pairs a gerund with a regular noun. Parallelism can be achieved by converting both terms to gerunds or to infinitives. The final phrase of the third example does not include a definite location, such as "across ''the yard''" or "over ''the fence''"; rewriting to add one completes the sentence's parallelism.

==In rhetoric==
{{see|Parallelism (rhetoric)}}
Parallelism is often used as a [[rhetorical device]]. Examples:

*"'''The inherent vice''' of capitalism is the unequal sharing of blessings. '''The inherent virtue''' of Socialism is the equal sharing of miseries." — [[Winston Churchill]], House of Commons, 22 October 1945&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.winstonchurchill.org/resources/quotes/vice-of-capitalism/ "Vice of Capitalism"]. ''[[International Churchill Society]]''. Retrieved 15 January 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; 
*"Let every nation know, whether it wishes us well or ill, that we shall '''pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe''' to assure the survival and the success of liberty." — [[John F.

The '''''q''-exponential distribution''' is a [[probability distribution]] arising from the maximization of the [[Tsallis entropy]] under appropriate constraints, including constraining the domain to be positive.  It is one example of a [[Tsallis distribution]]. The ''q''-exponential is a generalization of the [[exponential distribution]] in the same way that Tsallis entropy is a generalization of standard [[Entropy (statistical thermodynamics)|Boltzmann–Gibbs entropy]] or [[entropy (information theory)|Shannon entropy]].&lt;ref&gt;Tsallis, C. Nonadditive entropy and nonextensive statistical mechanics-an overview after 20 years. Braz. J. Phys. 2009, 39, 337–356&lt;/ref&gt; The exponential distribution is recovered as &lt;math&gt;q \rightarrow 1.&lt;/math&gt;

Originally proposed by the statisticians [[George Box]] and [[David Cox (statistician)|David Cox]] in 1964,&lt;ref name=boxcox&gt;{{cite journal |last=Box |first=George E. P. |authorlink=George E. P. Box |last2=Cox |first2=D. R. |authorlink2=David Cox (statistician) |title=An analysis of transformations |journal=[[Journal of the Royal Statistical Society]], Series B |volume=26 |issue=2 |pages=211–252 |year=1964 |mr=192611 |jstor=2984418 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and known as the reverse [[Box–Cox transformation]] for &lt;math&gt;q=1-\lambda,&lt;/math&gt; a particular case of [[power transform]] in statistics.

==Characterization==

===Probability density function===
The ''q''-exponential distribution has the probability density function

:&lt;math&gt;(2-q) \lambda e_q(-\lambda x)&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;e_q(x) = [1+(1-q)x]^{1/(1-q)}&lt;/math&gt;

is the [[Tsallis statistics#q-exponential|''q''-exponential]] if {{nowrap|''q'' ≠ 1}}. When {{nowrap|1=''q'' = 1}}, ''e''&lt;sub&gt;''q''&lt;/sub&gt;(x) is just exp(''x'').

==Derivation==
In a similar procedure to how the [[exponential distribution]] can be derived using the standard Boltzmann–Gibbs entropy or Shannon entropy and constraining the domain of the variable to be positive, the ''q''-exponential distribution can be derived from a maximization of the Tsallis Entropy subject to the appropriate constraints.

==Relationship to other distributions==
The ''q''-exponential is a special case of the [[generalized Pareto distribution]] where
:&lt;math&gt; \mu = 0,\quad \xi = \frac{q-1}{2-q} ,\quad \sigma = \frac{1}{\lambda (2-q)}.&lt;/math&gt;

The ''q''-exponential is the generalization of the [[Lomax distribution]] (Pareto Type II), as it extends this distribution to the cases of finite support. The Lomax parameters are:
:&lt;math&gt; \alpha = \frac{2-q}{q-1} ,\quad \lambda_\mathrm{Lomax} = \frac{1}{\lambda (q-1)}. &lt;/math&gt;

As the Lomax distribution is a shifted version of the [[Pareto distribution]], the ''q''-exponential is a shifted reparameterized generalization of the Pareto. When {{nowrap|''q'' &gt; 1}}, the ''q''-exponential is equivalent to the Pareto shifted to have support starting at zero. Specifically, if
:&lt;math&gt;X \sim \operatorname{\mathit{q}-Exp}(q,\lambda) \text{ and }
       Y \sim \left[\operatorname{Pareto}\left(x_m = \frac{1}{\lambda (q-1)}, \alpha = \frac{2-q}{q-1}\right) -x_m\right],&lt;/math&gt;
then &lt;math&gt;X \sim Y.&lt;/math&gt;

==Generating random deviates==
Random deviates can be drawn using [[inverse transform sampling]]. Given a variable ''U'' that is uniformly distributed on the interval (0,1), then
:&lt;math&gt;X = \frac{-q' \ln_{q'}(U)}{\lambda} \sim \operatorname{\mathit{q}-Exp}(q,\lambda)&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\ln_{q'}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Tsallis statistics#q-logarithm|''q''-logarithm]] and &lt;math&gt; q' = \frac{1}{2-q}.&lt;/math&gt;

== Applications ==

Being a [[power transform]], it is a usual technique in statistics for stabilizing the variance, making the data more normal distribution-like and improving the validity of measures of association such as the Pearson correlation between variables. 
It has been found to be an accurate model for train delays&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Modelling train delays with ''q''-exponential functions|author=Keith Briggs and Christian Beck|journal=Physica A|volume=378|pages=498-504}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
It is also found in atomic physics and quantum optics, for example processes of molecular condensate creation via transition through the Feshbach resonance.&lt;ref name='sun-16pra2'&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1103/PhysRevA.94.033808|title=Landau-Zener extension of the Tavis-Cummings model: Structure of the solution|author1=C.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26974">'''Religion and environmentalism''' is an emerging interdisciplinary subfield in the academic disciplines of [[religious studies]], [[religious ethics]], the [[sociology of religion]], and [[theology]] amongst others, with [[environmentalism]] and [[ecology|ecological]] principles as a primary focus.

==General overview==
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2012}}

===Crisis of values===
This subfield is founded on the understanding that, in the words of Iranian-American [[Philosophy|philosopher]] [[Hossein Nasr|Seyyed Hossein Nasr]], "the environmental crisis is fundamentally a crisis of [[value (personal and cultural)|values]]," and that [[religion]]s, being a primary source of values in any [[culture]], are thus implicated in the decisions humans make regarding the [[Natural environment|environment]].

===Burden of guilt===
[[History|Historian]] [[Lynn Townsend White, Jr.|Lynn White, Jr.]] first made the argument in a 1966 lecture before the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], subsequently published in the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', that [[Western Christianity]], having de-[[sacralized]] and instrumentalized [[nature]] to human ends, bears a substantial "burden of guilt" for the contemporary environmental crisis. White's essay stimulated a flurry of responses, ranging from defenses of [[Christianity]] to qualified admissions to complete agreement with his analysis.

===Eastern religions and indigenous peoples===
Some proposed that [[Eastern religions]], as well as those of [[indigenous peoples]], [[Neopaganism|neo-pagans]], and others, offered more [[Environmentally friendly|eco-friendly]] [[World view|worldviews]] than Christianity.  A third, more obscure camp, argued that while White's theory was  indeed correct, this was actually a benefit to society, and that thinning the populations of weaker plant and animal species via environmental destruction would lead to the [[evolution]] of stronger, more productive creatures.  See [[Kaitiaki]] in [[Māori religion]].

===Religion and ecology===
By the 1990s, many scholars of religion had entered the debate and begun to generate a substantial body of literature discussing and analyzing how nature is valued in the world's various religious systems. A landmark event was a series of ten conferences on Religion and Ecology organized by [[Yale University]] professors Mary Evelyn Tucker and John Grim and held at the [[Harvard University]] Center for the Study of World Religions from 1996 to 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Ecology and Religion|last = Tucker|first = Mary Evelyn|publisher = Island Press|year = 2013|isbn = 978-1-59726-707-6|location = Washington|pages = 6|last2 = Grim|first2 = John}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://fore.yale.edu/religions-of-the-world-and-ecology-archive-of-conference-materials/|title=Religions of the World and Ecology: Archive Of Conference Materials|last=|first=|date=|website=Forum on Religion and Ecology at Yale|access-date=November 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 800 international scholars, religious leaders, and environmentalists participated in the conference series. The conferences concluded at the United Nations and at the American Museum of Natural History with more than 1,000 people in attendance. Papers from the conferences were published in a series of ten books (The Religions of the World and Ecology Book Series), one for each of the world's major religious traditions.

From these conferences, Tucker and Grim would form The Yale Forum on Religion and Ecology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fore.yale.edu/|title=The Yale Forum on Religion and Ecology|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Forum has been instrumental in the creation of scholarship, in forming environmental policy, and in the greening of religion. In addition to their work with the Forum, Tucker and Grim's work continues in the ''Journey of the Universe'' film, book, and educational DVD series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.journeyoftheuniverse.org/|title=Welcome - Journey Of The Universe|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It continues to be the largest international multireligious project of its kind.

An active Religion and Ecology group has been in existence within the [[American Academy of Religion]] since 1991, and an increasing number of universities in [[North America]] and around the world are now offering courses on religion and the environment.&lt;ref&gt;“Religion and Ecology Group.” American Academy of Religion. https://papers.aarweb.org/content/religion-and-ecology-group Accessed July 28, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Recent scholarship on the field of religion and ecology can be found in the peer-reviewed academic journal ''Worldviews: Global Religions, Culture, and Ecology'' and in reference works such as the encyclopedia ''The Spirit of Sustainability''.

===Religion and nature===
Other landmarks in the emerging field was the publication of the ''Encyclopedia of Religion and Nature'' in 2005, which was edited by [[Bron Taylor]].  Taylor also led the effort to form the International Society for the Study of Religion, Nature and Culture, which was established in 2006, and began publishing the quarterly ''Journal for the Study of Religion, Nature, and Culture'' in 2007.

==Religions and the environment==
===Buddhism===
The best asset religion offers is the moral framework by which practitioners must abide.&lt;ref name="ecodharma.com"&gt;Eco-Dharma Center. (N.d.) Buddhism and Ecology. Catalan Pyrenees: Nick Day. Retrieved February 18, 2010, from http://www.ecodharma.com/influences-articles/buddhism-ecology.&lt;/ref&gt; Since many environmental problems have stemmed from human activity, it follows that religion might hold some solutions to mitigating destructive patterns. [[Buddhism]] idealizes and emphasizes interconnection,&lt;ref name="Tucker, M.E. 1998"&gt;Tucker, M.E. &amp; Williams, D.R. (Eds.). (1998). Buddhism and Ecology: The Interconnection of Dharma and Deeds. Cambridge: [[Harvard University Press]].&lt;/ref&gt; thereby creating a mindset that creates a productive and cooperative relationship between humans and nature. That all actions are based on the premise of interconnection makes the Buddhist mindset effective in cultivating modesty, compassion, and balance among followers, which may ultimately mitigate the harm done to the environment.

One benefit of the Buddhist interconnected mindset is the inevitable humility that ensues. Because humans are entwined with natural systems, damage done upon the [[Earth]] is also harm done to humans.&lt;ref name="Badiner, A.H. 1990"&gt;Badiner, A.H. (1990). Dharma Gaia. United States of America: Parallax Press.&lt;/ref&gt; This realization is quite modifying to a human race that historically pillages the Earth for individual benefit. When rational humans minimize the split between humanity and nature and bridge the gaps,&lt;ref name="ecodharma.com"/&gt; only then will a mutual respect emerge in which all entities coexist rather than fight. Buddhism maintains that the reason for all suffering comes from attachment.&lt;ref&gt;Knierim, T. (Last modified 2009). Four Noble Truths. Big View. Retrieved February 24, 2010, from {{cite web |url=http://www.thebigview.com/buddhism/fourtruths.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091111202249/http://www.thebigview.com/buddhism/fourtruths.html |archivedate=2009-11-11 |df= }} .&lt;/ref&gt; When release from the tight grasp humanity has on individuality and separateness occurs, then oneness and interconnection is realized. So rather than emphasizing winners and losers, humanity will understand its existence within others; this results in a modesty that ends egoic mind.

Another benefit of Buddhist practice to the environment is the compassion that drives all thinking.&lt;ref name="ecodharma.com"/&gt; When humans realize that they are all connected, harm done to another will never benefit the initiator.&lt;ref name="Badiner, A.H. 1990"/&gt; Therefore, peaceful wishes for everyone and everything will ultimately benefit the initiator. Through accepting that the web of life is connected&lt;ref name="Tucker, M.E. 1998"/&gt;—if one entity benefits, all benefit&lt;ref name="Badiner, A.H. 1990"/&gt;—then the prevailing mindset encourages peaceful actions all the time. If everything depends on everything else, then only beneficial events will make life situations better. Acceptance of compassion takes training and practice, which is also encouraged by Buddhist moral conduct in the form of mediation. This habitual striving for harmony and friendship among all beings creates a more perfect relationship between humanity and nature.

Lastly, Buddhist mindset relies on taking the middle road or striving for balance. [[Siddhartha Gautama]], the founder of Buddhism, spent his life searching for the outlet of human suffering, eventually concluding that a balance must be established between self-destruction and self-indulgence.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, J. (Producer) &amp; Bertolucci, B (Director). (1994). [[Little Buddha]]. United States of America: Buena Vista Home Entertainment.&lt;/ref&gt; While modern, industrial humans emphasize economic and social aspects of life and lastly environmental aspects, this view is lopsided.&lt;ref name="Badiner, A.H. 1990"/&gt; When human preferences are leveled with environmental preferences—giving a voice to natural systems as well as human systems—then can balance and harmony be realized.

Therefore, using this idealized and disciplined framework that Buddhism has to offer can create lasting solutions to amending the broken relationship between humanity and nature. What ensues is an ethic, rather than a short-term policy or technological fix.&lt;ref name="Badiner, A.H. 1990"/&gt; When never-ending consumption patterns cease for the betterment of the world as a whole, then all systems will harmoniously interact in a non-abusive way.&lt;ref name="Badiner, A.H. 1990"/&gt; Without needing to adopt a new religion, just recognizing and accepting this mindset can help to heal the environmental injuries of the past.

Buddhists today are involved in spreading environmental awareness. In a meeting with the U.S Ambassador to the Republic of India [[Timothy J. Roemer]], the [[Dalai Lama]] urged the U.S to engage China on climate change in [[Tibet]].&lt;ref&gt;The Guardian Newspaper from http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/us-embassy-cables-documents/220120&lt;/ref&gt; The Dalai Lama has also been part of a series on discussions organised by the [[Mind and Life Institute]]; a non profit organisation that specializes on the relationship between [[science]] and Buddhism. The talks were partly about ecology, ethics and interdependence and issues on global warming were brought up &lt;ref&gt;[http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/10/21/on-climate-ethics-cow-burps-and-the-dalai-lama/ On Climate, Ethics, Cow Burps and the Dalai Lama] October 21, 2011 NYT&lt;/ref&gt;

===Christianity===
{{main|Christian views on environmentalism}}

[[Christianity]] has a historic concern for nature and the natural world. At the same time, ecological concerns operate in tension with [[anthropocentrism|anthropocentric]] values, such as the [[Biblical]] notion of human dominion over the Earth. ([[Book of Genesis|Gen]] 1:28) A broad range of Christian institutions are engaged in the [[environmental movement]] and contemporary environmental concerns.

====Latter Day Saint movement====
[[Mormon]] environmentalists find theological reasons for stewardship and conservationism through biblical and additional scriptural references including a passages from the [[Doctrine and Covenants]]: "And it pleaseth God that he hath given all these things unto man; for unto this end were they made to be used, with judgment, not to excess, neither by extortion" ([[Doctrine and Covenants|D&amp;C]] 59:20).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/59.20?lang=eng|title=Doctrine and Covenants 59:20|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Latter Day Saint movement]] has a complex relationship with environmental concerns, involving not only the religion but politics and economics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.patheos.com/Resources/Additional-Resources/Mormon-Belief-and-the-Environment.html "Mormon Belief and the Environment"], by [[George B. Handley]] in [[Patheos]] September 15, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;(1998) ''New Genesis: A Mormon Reader on Land and Community'' Editors: [[Terry Tempest Williams]], Gibbs M. Smith, William B. Smart {{ISBN|978-0-87905-843-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of [[environmentally friendly]] policies, [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] has a history of utilizing elements of conservationist policies for their [[Meeting house|meetinghouses]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mormonnewsroom.org/ConservationPractices/|title=Timeline of Construction Practices|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The church first placed [[solar panels]] on a church meetinghouse in the [[Tuamotus|Tuamotu Islands]] in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/700027829/Mormon-Church-unveils-solar-powered-meetinghouse.html|title=Mormon Church unveils solar powered meetinghouse|first=Scott|last=Taylor|date=28 April 2010|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the church unveiled five [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]] certified meetinghouse prototypes that are that will be used as future meetinghouse designs around the world, the first one having been completed in 2010 in [[Farmington, Utah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sltrib.com/news/ci_14968222|title=Utah Local News - Salt Lake City News, Sports, Archive - The Salt Lake Tribune|first=The Salt Lake|last=Tribune|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120104095531/http://www.sltrib.com/news/ci_14968222|archivedate=2012-01-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hinduism===
In [[Hinduism]], practitioners and scholars find traditional approaches to the natural environment in such concepts as [[dharmic]] ethics or [[prakrti]] (material creation), the development of [[ayurveda]], and readings of [[vedas|vedic literature]]. Hindu [[environmental activism]] also may be inspired by [[Gandhian philosophy]] and practical struggles, such as the [[Bishnoi]] community in Rajasthan &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author =Jain, Pankaj|title=Dharma and Ecology of Hindu Communities: Sustenance and Sustainability|publisher=[[Ashgate Publishing]]|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Chipko]] resistance to [[forestry]] policies in [[Uttar Pradesh]], India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Chappl and Tucker|title=Hinduism and Ecology: The intersection of earth, sky and water|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mahatma Gandhi played a major role in Indian environmentalism, and has been called the "father of Indian environmentalism".&lt;ref&gt;Sanford, Whitney. ''Gandhi's Agrarian Legacy: Practicing Food, Justice, and Sustainability in India''. Journal for the Study of Religion, March 2013, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; Gandhi's environmental thought parallels his social thoughts in that environmental sustainability and social inequalities should be managed in similar fashions.&lt;ref&gt;Sanford, Whitney. ''Gandhi's Agrarian Legacy: Practicing Food, Justice, and Sustainability in India''. Journal for the Study of Religion, March 2013, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; His non-violent teachings left a lasting impact, even agriculturally. Contemporary agrarian practices use the Bhagavad-Gita to establish practices that are deemed non-violent.&lt;ref&gt;Sanford, Whitney. ''Gandhi's Agrarian Legacy: Practicing Food, Justice, and Sustainability in India''. Journal for the Study of Religion, March 2013, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islam===
{{See also|Islamic Foundation for Ecology and Environmental Science}}
Through the tradition from the [[Quran]] and the prophets, the environment was made sacred. It is believed that God did not create the environment for a random reason, but rather a reflection of truth. One can gain profound knowledge from nature thus, human beings are to preserve it and look after it.  Many chapters in the  Quran, refer to the beauties of nature as well as the headings of many chapters indicating the importance of it, such as: "The Sun", "Dawn", and "Morning Hours". Thus man is God's representative on this planet, if he is not charged with sustaining it, then at least he must not destroy it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=The Holy Quran and the Environment| year=2010| chapter=The Relationship between The Environment and Man| chapterurl=http://www.rissc.jo/index.php/english-publications.html| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129013542/http://rissc.jo/index.php/english-publications.html| archivedate=2010-11-29| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Islam]], the concept of a [[Hima (environmental protection)|hima]] or "inviolate zone" refers to a piece of land that has been set aside to prevent cultivation or any use other than [[Spirituality|spiritual]] purposes.

===Judaism===
{{Main|Judaism and environmentalism}}

In [[Judaism]], the natural world plays a central role in [[Jewish law]], literature, and liturgical and other practices. {{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} Within the diverse arena of Jewish thought, beliefs vary widely about the human relation to the environment, though the rabbinic tradition has put Judaism primarily on an [[anthropocentrism|anthropocentric]] trajectory. However, a few contemporary Jewish thinkers and rabbis in the USA and [[Israel]] emphasized that a central belief in Judaism is that the Man (Ha Adam - האדם whose root comes from Haadama (earth) - האדמה, in [[Hebrew language]]), should keep the Earth in the same state as he received it from God, its eternal and actual "owner" (especially for the land of [[Israel]]), thus the people today should avoid polluting it and keep it clean for the future generations. According to this opinion, Judaism is clearly in line with the principles of environmental protection and [[sustainable development]].

In Jewish law (''halakhah''), ecological concerns are reflected in Biblical protection for fruit trees, rules in the [[Mishnah]] against harming the public domain, [[Talmud]]ic debate over noise and smoke [[Nezikin|damages]], and contemporary [[responsa]] on agricultural pollution. In [[Conservative Judaism]], there has been some attempt to adopt [[ecokashrut]] ideas{{Clarify|date=July 2011}} developed in the 1970s by Rabbi [[Zalman Schachter-Shalomi]]. In addition, Jewish activists have recruited principles of ''halakhah'' for environmental purposes, such as the injunction against unnecessary destruction, known as [[bal tashkhit]]. {{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

In contemporary Jewish liturgy, ecological concerns have been promoted by adapting a [[kabbalah|kabbalistic]] [[ritual]] for the holiday of trees, [[Tu Bishvat]]. Biblical and rabbinic texts have been enlisted for prayers about the environment, especially in [[Orthodox Judaism]] and [[Jewish Renewal]] movements.

In the U.S., a diverse coalition of Jewish environmentalists undertakes both educational and policy advocacy on such issues as [[biodiversity]] and [[global warming]].&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite web|title=About COEJL|publisher=Coalition on the Environment and Jewish Life, New York|url=http://www.coejl.org/~coejlor/about/|accessdate=2008-01-08}} and the [http://jewcology.org/map-of-initiatives/ Jewcology map of Jewish environmental initiatives].&lt;/ref&gt; Jewish environmentalists are drawn from all branches of religious life, ranging from Rabbi [[Arthur Waskow]] to the Orthodox group Canfei Nesharim.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite pressrelease|url=http://canfeinesharim.org/who_we_are/in_news.php?page=13141|title=Canfei Nesharim Named One of North America’s Most Innovative Jewish Nonprofits|publisher=Canfei Nesharim|date=2007-10-08|accessdate=2008-01-08|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071108231605/http://canfeinesharim.org/who_we_are/in_news.php?page=13141|archivedate=2007-11-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Israel, [[Secular Jewish culture|secular Jews]] have formed numerous governmental and [[non-governmental organizations]] to protect nature and reduce pollution. While many Israeli environmental organizations make limited use of Jewish religious teachings, a few do approach Israel's environmental problems from a Jewish standpoint, including [http://www.earthday.org/partner/heschel-center-environmental-learning-and-leadership the Heschel Center for Environmental Learning and Leadership], named after [[Abraham Joshua Heschel]].

===Taoism===
[[Taoism]] offers many ideas that are in line with environmentalism, such as [[wu wei]], [[moderation]], [[compassion]] and Taoist [[animism]]. Parallels were found between Taoism and [[deep ecology]]. Pioneer of environmentalism [[John Muir]] was called "the Taoist of the West". Rosenfeld wrote 'Taoism is environmentalism'.&lt;ref name="Zai 2015"&gt;Dr Zai, J. [https://books.google.com/books?id=-WzMCQAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover1 ''Taoism and Science: Cosmology, Evolution, Morality, Health and more''].

Baird Earth's Insights: A Multicultural Survey of Ecological Ethics from the Mediterranean Basin to the Australian Outback Callicott&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jainism===
In [[Jainism]], the ancient and perhaps timeless philosophical concepts, like ''Parasparopagraho Jivanam'', were more recently compiled into a [http://www.jainology.org/publications/jain-delaration-on-nature Jain Declaration on Nature], which describes the religion's inherent [[Biocentrism (ethics)|biocentrism]] and deep ecology. ({{cite encyclopedia |title=Parasparopagraho Jivanam|encyclopedia=Wikipedia|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasparopagraho_Jivanam}})

'''Shalva''' (The Israel Association for Care and Inclusion of Persons with Disabilities) ([[Hebrew]]: שַׁלְוָה) is a registered [[non-profit organization]]&lt;ref name="shalva on the Israeli Corporations Authority"&gt;{{cite web|title=Israeli Corporations Authority|url=http://index.justice.gov.il/Units/RasutHataagidim/units/RashamAmutot/services/Pages/amuttview.aspx|website=Israeli Corporations Authority|accessdate=28 January 2015|ref=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; that supports and empowers individuals with [[disabilities]] and their families in [[Israel]]. The organization works with a wide range of individuals with disabilities: [[mental retardation]], [[developmental delays]], [[learning disabilities]], attention deficit disorders, the [[Autism spectrum]], [[special needs]] with recognized [[Disability|handicaps]] (children with minor to severe [[Intellectual disability|retardation]], [[Down syndrome]], [[Fragile X syndrome]]), and more.

Founded by [[Kalman Samuels]] in 1990, the organization offers a range of programs to approximately 2000 individuals with disabilities including [[infants]], [[children]], and [[youth]] and their families. Non-denominational and free of charge, Shalva offers a range of therapies, inclusive educational frameworks, recreational programs, vocational training, respite and family support.  Shalva advocates for the inclusion of persons with disabilities through employment programs, community initiatives, and  disability research.  Shalva collaborates with communities worldwide as well as government, academic, and cultural institutions to pioneer innovative therapy solutions around the common goal of improving the lives of people with disabilities and promoting their inclusion in society.  The organization is supported by a wide network of [[volunteering|volunteers]] from the broader community as well as National Service volunteers. 

Shalva's programs have been distinguished by several awards, among them: the President of Israel Prize for Excellence (1994); the Mayor of Jerusalem Award for Exceptional Service (1999); the Shalem Fund Award for “Israel’s most unique program for the mentally challenged” (2004); the Knesset Speaker’s Quality of Life Prize for Leadership and Public Excellence (2005); the Ruderman Foundation Prize for the integration of children with special needs (2012); and Consultant Status for the United Nations Economic and Social Council (2018).  The organization’s management standards are recognized by the ISO 9001/2001 certification and Midot’s Seal for Outstanding Eﬀectiveness. 
==Background==
As [[parents]] of a child with disabilities,&lt;ref name="Never stop dreaming"&gt;{{cite news|title=Never stop dreaming|url=http://www.cjnews.com/news/%E2%80%98never-stop-dreaming%E2%80%99-says-dad-child-special-needs|accessdate=28 January 2015|work=The Canadian Jewish News|date=May 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kalman and Malki Samuels understood the need for the founding of an organization that would ease the burdens of families of children with disabilities. Their son, Yossi Samuels, was born a healthy child in 1977 however, after receiving a faulty [[DPT vaccine|DPT vaccination]], he was rendered [[blindness|blind]], [[deaf]], and [[hyperactive]]. He was isolated in his own world without a method of communication. Based on their personal experience with the day-to-day challenges of raising a family and the constant need to care for a child with special needs, they decided to establish Shalva in 1990.

The first center was established in a private apartment in the [[Har Nof]] neighborhood in [[Jerusalem]] and catered to a few dozen local children. As a greater need emerged, the organization bought an additional facility on an adjacent street and began expanding its programs; the building was later called ”Beit Nachshon” in memory of [[Nachshon Wachsman]] who was kidnapped and murdered by [[terrorists]] in 1994.&lt;ref name="Esther Wachsman, Mother of slain soldier presents Gilad Shalit with Spirit of Hope Award"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Friedson|first1=Felice|title=Esther Wachsman, Mother of slain soldier presents Gilad Shalit with Spirit of Hope Award|url=http://www.jewishjournal.com/live_from_the_arab_spring/article/mother_of_slain_soldier_presents_gilad_shalit_with_spirit_of_hope_award|accessdate=30 January 2015|work=Jewish Journal|date=March 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the years, programs with innovative therapies were developed for infants, and the organization began to support [[research]] in various subjects in its field.&lt;ref name="Israel joins validation of test to detect Down syndrome"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Siegel-Itzkovich|first1=Judy|title=Israel joins validation of test to detect Down syndrome|url=http://www.jpost.com/Health-and-Science/Israel-joins-validation-of-test-to-detect-Down-syndrome|accessdate=30 January 2015|work=The Jerusalem Post|date=March 3, 2012|ref=Israel joins validation of test to detect Down syndrome}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, Shalva's programs are housed in the Shalva National Center in the [[Bayit VeGan|Bayit Vegan]] near the [[Shaare Zedek Medical Center]]. 

=='''The Shalva National Center'''==
[[File:National Park for Inclusion at Shalva.jpg|thumb]]
Construction of the Shalva National Center began in 2008,&lt;ref name="Realizing a challenging dream"&gt;{{cite news|title=Realizing a challenging dream|url=http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Columnists/Editors-Notes-Realizing-a-challenging-dream|accessdate=28 January 2015|work=The Jerusalem Post|date=11 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; neighboring the [[Shaare Zedek Medical Center]] in Jerusalem. The 220,000 sq.ft center opened its doors on September 2016 and has disability accessible facilities such as an auditorium, sports center, therapeutic and recreational swimming pools, fitness rooms, inclusive playgrounds and more.

The calendar began with year one in what is 38 BC,&lt;ref name="Roth, Norman"&gt;Roth, Norman. ''Medieval Iberia An Encyclopedia''.

The use of the Caesar Era probably began in Iberia in the 3rd century. The reason for its particular popularity is unknown. Official usage ceased in different parts of the Iberian peninsula at different times: in [[Kingdom of Aragon|Aragon]] in 1349, [[Kingdom of Valencia|Valencia]] 1358, [[Crown of Castile|Castile]] 1383 and [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]] 1422. While the year officially began on 1 January under the Spanish era, that was changed to 25 December when the ''Anno Domini'' system was adopted. (The church, however, used 11 January.)&lt;ref name="Roth, Norman"/&gt;

'''Stendhal syndrome''', '''Stendhal's syndrome''', '''hyperkulturemia''', or '''Florence syndrome''' is a [[psychosomatic]] disorder that causes [[Tachycardia|rapid heartbeat]], dizziness, [[Syncope (medicine)|fainting]], confusion and even [[hallucination]]s when an individual is exposed to an experience of great personal significance, particularly viewing [[art]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1136/bcr.06.2008.0317| title = Stendhal syndrome: A case of cultural overload| journal = Case Reports| volume = 2009| pages = bcr0620080317| year = 2009| last1 = Nicholson | first1 = T.

==History==
[[File:Stendhal.jpg|thumb|upright|Stendhal syndrome was named after Marie-Henri Beyle (1783–1842), better known by his penname [[Stendhal]].]]
The illness is named after the 19th-century French author [[Stendhal]] (pseudonym of Marie-Henri Beyle), who described his experience with the phenomenon during his 1817 visit to [[Florence]] in his book ''Naples and Florence: A Journey from Milan to Reggio''.

When he visited the [[Basilica of Santa Croce, Florence|Basilica of Santa Croce]], where [[Niccolò Machiavelli]], [[Michelangelo]] and [[Galileo Galilei]] are buried, he was overcome with emotion. He wrote:{{quote|I was in a sort of ecstasy, from the idea of being in Florence, close to the great men whose tombs I had seen. Absorbed in the contemplation of sublime beauty ... I reached the point where one encounters celestial sensations ... Everything spoke so vividly to my soul. Ah, if I could only forget. I had palpitations of the heart, what in Berlin they call 'nerves'. Life was drained from me. I walked with the fear of falling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url = https://books.google.com/?id=OxyNfsmXfYEC&amp;pg=PA196 | title=Interfaces of Performance | editor-first1=Maria |editor-last1= Chatzichristodoulou | editor-first2=Janis |editor-last2= Jefferies |editor-first3=Rachel |editor-last3= Zerihan | publisher = Ashgate Publishing, Ltd. |year= 2009 |page= 196 |isbn= 9781409486145 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
He had been shown the frescoes in the church including those by [[Giotto]], and modern writers frequently attribute his emotions mistakenly to the latter rather than powerful historical associations of the tombs. {{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

Although psychiatrists have long debated whether it really exists, its effects on some sufferers are serious enough for them to require treatment in hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/05/15/world/florence-s-art-makes-some-go-to-pieces.html |title=Florence's Art Makes Some Go to Pieces |location=Italy; Florence (Italy) |work=The New York Times |date=15 May 1989 |accessdate=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The staff at Florence's Santa Maria Nuova hospital are accustomed to dealing with tourists suffering from dizzy spells and disorientation after admiring the statue of David, the masterpieces of the Uffizi Gallery and other treasures of the Tuscan city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/italy/7914746/Scientists-investigate-Stendhal-Syndrome-fainting-caused-by-great-art.html |title=Scientists investigate Stendhal Syndrome – fainting caused by great art |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=London |date=28 July 2010 |accessdate=24 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even though there are many descriptions of people becoming dizzy and fainting while taking in Florentine art, especially at the aforementioned [[Uffizi]] in Florence, dating from the early 19th century on, the syndrome was only named in 1979, when it was described by Italian psychiatrist [[Graziella Magherini]], who observed and described more than 100 similar cases among tourists and visitors in Florence. There is no scientific evidence to define the Stendhal syndrome as a specific psychiatric disorder; on the other hand there is evidence that the same cerebral areas involved in emotional reactions are activated during the exposure to artworks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |last1=Innocenti |first1=Claudia |last2=Fioravanti |first2=Giulia |last3=Spiti |first3=Raffaello |last4=Faravelli |first4=Carlo |title=La sindrome di Stendhal fra psicoanalisi e neuroscienze |journal=Rivista di Psichiatria |date=1 March 2014 |volume=49 |issue=2 |pages=61–66  |doi=10.1708/1461.16139|pmid=24770571 |issn=2038-2502  |trans-title=[The Stendhal syndrome between psychoanalysis and neuroscience]. |language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; ''TLA'' is an [[acronym]] for [[Temporal Logic of Actions]].

For design and documentation, TLA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; fulfills the same purpose as informal [[technical specifications]]. However, TLA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; specifications are written in a formal language of [[logic]] and mathematics, and the precision of specifications written in this language is intended to uncover design flaws before system implementation is underway.&lt;ref name="precise-spec"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Since TLA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; specifications are written in a formal language, they are amenable to finite [[model checking]]. The model checker finds all possible system behaviours up to some number of execution steps, and examines them for violations of desired [[Invariant (computer science)|invariance]] properties such as [[Safety (distributed computing)|safety]] and [[liveness]]. TLA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; specifications use basic [[set theory]] to define safety (bad things won't happen) and [[temporal logic]] to define liveness (good things eventually happen).

TLA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is also used to write [[Automated theorem proving|machine-checked proofs of correctness]] both for [[algorithms]] and mathematical theorems. The proofs are written in a declarative, hierarchical style independent of any single theorem prover backend. Both formal and informal structured mathematical proofs can be written in TLA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;; the language is similar to [[LaTeX]], and tools exist to translate TLA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; specifications to LaTeX documents.&lt;ref name="lamport-proofs"&gt;

TLA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; was introduced in 1999, following several decades of research into a verification method for concurrent systems. A toolchain has since developed, including an [[interactive development environment|IDE]] and distributed model checker. The pseudocode-like language [[PlusCal]] was created in 2009; it [[Source-to-source compiler|transpiles]] to TLA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and is useful for specifying sequential algorithms. TLA&lt;sup&gt;+2&lt;/sup&gt; was announced in 2014, expanding language support for proof constructs. The current TLA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; reference is [http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/tla/hyperbook.html The TLA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; Hyperbook] by Leslie Lamport.

==History==
[[File:Amir Pnueli.jpg|thumb|alt=Portrait of an Israeli man in his sixties. His hair is short and balding, and he is wearing glasses with a dress shirt and jacket.|[[Amir Pnueli]] applied temporal logic to computer science, for which he received the 1996 [[Turing award]].]]
Modern [[temporal logic]] was developed by [[Arthur Prior]] in 1957, then called tense logic. Although [[Amir Pnueli]] was the first to seriously study the applications of temporal logic to [[computer science]], Prior speculated on its use a decade earlier in 1967:
: "The usefulness of systems of this sort [on discrete time] does not depend on any serious metaphysical assumption that time is discrete; they are applicable in limited fields of discourse in which we are concerned only with what happens next in a sequence of discrete states, e.g. in the working of a digital computer."
Pnueli researched the use of temporal logic in specifying and reasoning about computer programs, introducing [[linear temporal logic]] in 1977. LTL became an important tool for analysis of concurrent programs, easily expressing properties such as [[mutual exclusion]] and freedom from [[deadlock]].&lt;ref name="temporal-logic-history"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Concurrent with Pnueli's work on LTL, academics were working to generalize [[Hoare logic]] for verification of multiprocess programs. [[Leslie Lamport]] became interested in the problem after [[peer review]] found an error in a paper he submitted on mutual exclusion. Ed Ashcroft introduced [[Invariant (computer science)|invariance]] in his 1975 paper "Proving Assertions About Parallel Programs", which Lamport used to generalize [[Robert W. Floyd|Floyd]]'s method in his 1977 paper "Proving Correctness of Multiprocess Programs". Lamport's paper also introduced [[Safety (distributed computing)|safety]] and [[liveness]] as generalizations of [[partial correctness]] and [[Divergence (computer science)|termination]], respectively.&lt;ref name="lamport-proving"&gt;

 | accessdate = 22 May 2015}}
&lt;/ref&gt; This method was used to verify the first concurrent [[Garbage collection (computer science)|garbage collection]] algorithm in a 1978 paper with [[Edsger Dijkstra]].&lt;ref name="lamport-garbage"&gt;
{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

Lamport first encountered Pnueli's LTL during a 1978 seminar at [[Stanford]] organized by [[Susan Owicki]]. According to Lamport, "I was sure that temporal logic was some kind of abstract nonsense that would never have any practical application, but it seemed like fun, so I attended." In 1980 he published "'Sometime' is Sometimes 'Not Never'", which became one of the most frequently-cited papers in the temporal logic literature.&lt;ref name="lamport-sometime"&gt;
{{cite web
 | last = Lamport
 | first = Leslie

 | url = http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/pubs/pubs.html#sometime
 | accessdate = 22 May 2015}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Lamport worked on writing temporal logic specifications during his time at [[SRI International|SRI]], but found the approach to be impractical:

[[File:Leslie Lamport.jpg|thumb|alt=Portrait of a Caucasian man in his seventies with medium-length gray hair and a full gray beard, wearing glasses and a T-shirt.|TLA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; was developed by computer scientist and 2013 Turing award recipient [[Leslie Lamport]].]]
: "However, I became disillusioned with temporal logic when I saw how Schwartz, Melliar-Smith, and Fritz Vogt were spending days trying to specify a simple [[FIFO (computing and electronics)|FIFO queue]] - arguing over whether the properties they listed were sufficient. I realized that, despite its aesthetic appeal, writing a specification as a conjunction of temporal properties just didn't work in practice."

His search for a practical method of specification resulted in the 1983 paper "Specifying Concurrent Programming Modules", which introduced the idea of describing state transitions as boolean-valued functions of primed and unprimed variables.&lt;ref name="lamport-spec"&gt;
{{cite web
 | last = Lamport

 | title = The Writings of Leslie Lamport: Specifying Concurrent Programming Modules
 | url = http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/pubs/pubs.html#spec
 | accessdate = 22 May 2015}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Work continued throughout the 1980s, and Lamport began publishing papers on the [[temporal logic of actions]] in 1990; however, it was not formally introduced until "The Temporal Logic of Actions" was published in 1994. TLA enabled the use of [[Action language|actions]] in temporal formulas, which according to Lamport "provides an elegant way to formalize and systematize all the reasoning used in concurrent system verification."&lt;ref name="lamport-actions"&gt;
{{cite web

 | accessdate = 22 May 2015}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

TLA specifications mostly consisted of ordinary non-temporal mathematics, which Lamport found less cumbersome than a purely temporal specification. TLA provided a mathematical foundation to the specification language TLA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, introduced with the paper "Specifying Concurrent Systems with TLA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;" in 1999.&lt;ref name="tlaplus-original"/&gt; Later that same year, Yuan Yu wrote the TLC [[model checker]] for TLA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; specifications; TLC was used to find errors in the [[cache coherence]] protocol for a [[Compaq]] multiprocessor.&lt;ref name="tlcoriginal"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; and the TLA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; proof system (TLAPS) in 2012.&lt;ref name="tlaps-survey"/&gt; TLA&lt;sup&gt;+2&lt;/sup&gt; was announced in 2014, adding some additional language constructs as well as greatly increasing in-language support for the proof system.&lt;ref name="tla2guide" /&gt; Lamport is engaged in creating an updated TLA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; reference, "The TLA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; Hyperbook". The incomplete work is [http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/tla/hyperbook.html available] from his official website. Lamport is also creating [http://lamport.azurewebsites.net/video/videos.html The TLA+ Video Course], described therein as "a work in progress that consists of the beginning of a series of video lectures to teach programmers and software engineers how to write their own TLA+ specifications".

==Language==
TLA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; specifications are organized into modules. Modules can extend (import) other modules to use their functionality. Although the TLA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; standard is specified in typeset mathematical symbols, existing TLA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; tools use [[LaTeX]]-like symbol definitions in [[ASCII]]. TLA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; uses several terms which require definition:
* ''State'' - an assignment of values to variables
* ''Behaviour'' - a sequence of states
* ''Step'' - a pair of successive states in a behavior
* ''Stuttering step'' - a step during which variables are unchanged
* ''Next-state relation'' - a relation describing how variables can change in any step
* ''State function'' - an expression containing variables and constants that is not a next-state relation
* ''State predicate'' - a Boolean-valued state function
* ''Invariant'' - a state predicate true in all reachable states
* ''Temporal formula'' - an expression containing statements in temporal logic

===Safety===
TLA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; concerns itself with defining the set of all correct system behaviours. For example, a one-bit clock ticking endlessly between 0 and 1 could be specified as follows:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="text"&gt;
VARIABLE clock

Init == clock \in {0, 1}

Tick == IF clock = 0 THEN clock' = 1 ELSE clock' = 0

Spec == Init /\ [][Tick]_&lt;&lt;clock&gt;&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The next-state relation '''Tick''' sets ''clock''′ (the value of ''clock'' in the next state) to 1 if ''clock'' is 0, and 0 if ''clock'' is 1. The state predicate '''Init''' is true if the value of ''clock'' is either 0 or 1. '''Spec''' is a temporal formula asserting all behaviours of one-bit clock must initially satisfy '''Init''' and have all steps either match '''Tick''' or be stuttering steps. Two such behaviours are:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="text"&gt;
0 -&gt; 1 -&gt; 0 -&gt; 1 -&gt; 0 -&gt; ...

1 -&gt; 0 -&gt; 1 -&gt; 0 -&gt; 1 -&gt; ...
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The safety properties of the one-bit clock - the set of reachable system states - are adequately described by the spec.

===Liveness===
The above spec disallows strange states for the one-bit clock, but does not say the clock will ever tick. For example, the following perpetually-stuttering behaviours are accepted:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="text"&gt;
0 -&gt; 0 -&gt; 0 -&gt; 0 -&gt; 0 -&gt; ...

1 -&gt; 1 -&gt; 1 -&gt; 1 -&gt; 1 -&gt; ...
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

A clock which does not tick is not useful, so these behaviours should be disallowed. One solution is to disable stuttering, but TLA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; requires stuttering always be enabled; a stuttering step represents a change to some part of the system not described in the spec, and is useful for [[Refinement (computing)|refinement]]. To ensure the clock must eventually tick, weak [[Unbounded nondeterminism#Fairness|fairness]] is asserted for '''Tick''':

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang="text"&gt;
Spec == Init /\ [][Tick]_&lt;&lt;clock&gt;&gt; /\ WF_&lt;&lt;clock&gt;&gt;(Tick)
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Weak fairness over an action means if that action is continuously enabled, it must eventually be taken. With weak fairness on '''Tick''' only a finite number of stuttering steps are permitted between ticks. This temporal logical statement about '''Tick''' is called a liveness assertion. In general, a liveness assertion should be ''machine-closed'': it shouldn't constrain the set of reachable states, only the set of possible behaviours.&lt;ref name="machine-closure"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Operators===

TLA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is based on [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|ZF]], so operations on variables involve set manipulation. The language includes set [[Element (mathematics)|membership]], [[Union (set theory)|union]], [[Intersection (set theory)|intersection]], [[Relative complement|difference]], [[powerset]], and [[subset]] operators. [[First-order logic]] operators such as {{math|&amp;or;}}, {{math|&amp;and;}}, {{math|&amp;not;}}, {{math|&amp;rArr;}}, {{math|&amp;harr;}}, {{math|&amp;equiv;}} are also included, as well as [[universal quantification|universal]] and [[existential quantification|existential]] quantifiers {{math|&amp;forall;}} and {{math|&amp;exist;}}. [[Epsilon calculus|Hilbert's {{math|&amp;epsilon;}}]] is provided as the CHOOSE operator, which uniquely selects an arbitrary set element. Arithmetic operators over [[real number|reals]], [[integers]], and [[natural numbers]] are available from the standard modules.

Temporal logic operators are built into TLA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. Temporal formulas use &lt;math&gt;\Box P&lt;/math&gt; to mean ''P'' is always true, and &lt;math&gt;\Diamond P&lt;/math&gt; to mean ''P'' is eventually true. The operators are combined into &lt;math&gt;\Box \Diamond P&lt;/math&gt; to mean ''P'' is true infinitely often, or &lt;math&gt;\Diamond \Box P&lt;/math&gt; to mean eventually ''P'' will always be true. Other temporal operators include weak and strong fairness. Weak fairness WF&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;(''A'') means if action ''A'' is enabled ''continuously'' (i.e. without interruptions), it must eventually be taken. Strong fairness SF&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;(''A'') means if action ''A'' is enabled ''continually'' (repeatedly, with or without interruptions), it must eventually be taken.

&lt;nowiki&gt; &lt;/nowiki&gt;Temporal existential and universal quantification are included in TLA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, although without support from the tools.

User-defined operators are similar to [[Macro (computer science)|macros]]. Operators differ from functions in that their domain need not be a set: for example, the [[Element (mathematics)|set membership]] operator has the [[category of sets]] as its domain, which is [[set of all sets|not a valid set]] in ZFC (since its existence leads to [[Russell's paradox]]). Recursive and anonymous user-defined operators were added in TLA&lt;sup&gt;+2&lt;/sup&gt;.

===Data structures===
The foundational data structure of TLA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is the set. Sets are either explicitly enumerated or constructed from other sets using operators or with &lt;code&gt;{x \in S : p}&lt;/code&gt; where ''p'' is some condition on ''x'', or &lt;code&gt;{e : x \in S}&lt;/code&gt; where ''e'' is some function of ''x''. The unique [[empty set]] is represented as &lt;code&gt;{}&lt;/code&gt;.

[[Function (mathematics)|Functions]] in TLA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; assign a value to each element in their domain, a set. &lt;code&gt;[S -&gt; T]&lt;/code&gt; is the set of all functions with f[''x''] in ''T'', for each ''x'' in the [[Domain of a function|domain]] set ''S''. For example, the TLA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; function &lt;code&gt;Double[x \in Nat] == x*2&lt;/code&gt; is an element of the set &lt;code&gt;[Nat -&gt; Nat]&lt;/code&gt; so &lt;code&gt;Double \in [Nat -&gt; Nat]&lt;/code&gt; is a true statement in TLA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. Functions are also defined with &lt;code&gt;[x \in S |-&gt; e]&lt;/code&gt; for some expression ''e'', or by modifying an existing function &lt;code&gt;[f EXCEPT ![v&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;] = v&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;/code&gt;.

[[Record (computer science)|Records]] are a type of function in TLA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. The record &lt;code&gt;[name |-&gt; "John", age |-&gt; 35]&lt;/code&gt; is a record with fields name and age, accessed with &lt;code&gt;r.name&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;r.age&lt;/code&gt;, and belonging to the set of records &lt;code&gt;[name : String, age : Nat]&lt;/code&gt;.

[[Tuples]] are included in TLA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. They are explicitly defined with &lt;code&gt;&lt;&lt;e&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,e&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,e&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;/code&gt; or constructed with operators from the standard Sequences module. Sets of tuples are defined by [[Cartesian product]]; for example, the set of all pairs of natural numbers is defined &lt;code&gt;Nat \X Nat&lt;/code&gt;.

==Standard modules==
TLA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; has a set of standard modules containing common operators. They are distributed with the syntactic analyzer. The TLC model checker uses Java implementations for improved performance.

* '''FiniteSets''': Module for working with [[finite sets]]. Provides ''IsFiniteSet(S)'' and ''Cardinality(S)'' operators.
* '''Sequences''': Defines operators on [[tuples]] such as ''Len(S)'', ''Head(S)'', ''Tail(S)'', ''Append(S, E)'', [[concatenation]], and [[Filter (higher-order function)|filter]].
* '''Bags''': Module for working with [[multisets]]. Provides primitive set operation analogues and duplicate counting.
* '''Naturals''': Defines the [[Natural numbers]] along with inequality and arithmetic operators.
* '''Integers''': Defines the [[Integers]].
* '''Reals''': Defines the [[Real numbers]] along with division and [[infinity]].
* '''RealTime''': Provides definitions useful in [[real-time system]] specifications.
* '''TLC''': Provides utility functions for model-checked specifications, such as logging and assertions.

Standard modules are imported with the &lt;code&gt;EXTENDS&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;INSTANCE&lt;/code&gt; statements.

==Tools==

===IDE===
[[File:TLA IDE screenshot.png|thumb|alt=Screenshot of IDE|TLA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; IDE in typical use showing spec explorer on the left, editor in the middle, and parse errors on the right.]]
An [[integrated development environment]] is implemented on top of [[Eclipse (software)|Eclipse]]. It includes an editor with error and [[syntax highlighting]], plus a [[GUI]] front-end to several other TLA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; tools:
* The SANY syntactic analyzer, which parses and checks the spec for syntax errors.
* The [[LaTeX]] translator, to generate [[Prettyprint|pretty-printed]] specs.
* The PlusCal translator.
* The TLC model checker.
* The TLAPS proof system.
The IDE is distributed in [http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/tla/toolbox.html The TLA Toolbox].

===Model checker===
[[File:TLC one-bit clock states.png|thumb|alt=Finite state machine diagram of one-bit clock|States and transitions discovered by TLC for the one-bit clock.]]
The TLC [[model checker]] builds a [[finite state]] model of TLA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; specifications for checking [[invariant (computer science)|invariance properties]]. TLC generates a set of initial states satisfying the spec, then performs a [[breadth-first search]] over all defined state transitions. Execution stops when all state transitions lead to states which have already been discovered. If TLC discovers a state which violates a system invariant, it halts and provides a state trace path to the offending state. TLC provides a method of declaring model symmetries to defend against [[combinatorial explosion]].&lt;ref name="tlcoriginal"/&gt; It also [[parallel computing|parallelizes]] the state exploration step, and can run in distributed mode to spread the workload across a large number of computers.&lt;ref name="tlcdistributed"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

As an alternative to exhaustive breadth-first search, TLC can use depth-first search or generate random behaviours. TLC operates on a subset of TLA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;; the model must be finite and enumerable, and some temporal operators are not supported. In distributed mode TLC cannot check liveness properties, nor check random or depth-first behaviours. TLC is [http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/tla/tlc.html available] as a command line tool or bundled with the TLA toolbox.

===Proof system===
The TLA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; Proof System, or TLAPS, [[Automated theorem proving|mechanically checks]] proofs written in TLA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. It was developed at the [[Microsoft Research]]-[[INRIA]] Joint Centre to prove correctness of concurrent and distributed algorithms. The proof language is designed to be independent of any particular theorem prover; proofs are written in a declarative style, and transformed into individual obligations which are sent to back-end provers. The primary back-end provers are [[Isabelle (proof assistant)|Isabelle]] and Zenon, with fallback to [[Satisfiability modulo theories|SMT]] solvers CVC3, Yices, and Z3. TLAPS proofs are hierarchically structured, easing refactoring and enabling non-linear development: work can begin on later steps before all prior steps are verified, and difficult steps are decomposed into smaller sub-steps. TLAPS works well with TLC, as the model checker quickly finds small errors before verification is begun. In turn, TLAPS can prove system properties which are beyond the capabilities of finite model checking.&lt;ref name="tlaps-survey"/&gt;

TLAPS does not currently support reasoning with real numbers, nor most temporal operators. Isabelle and Zenon generally cannot prove arithmetic proof obligations, requiring use of the SMT solvers.&lt;ref name="tlaps-unsupported"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; TLAPS has been used to prove correctness of [[Paxos (computer science)#Byzantine Paxos|Byzantine Paxos]], the Memoir security architecture, and components of the [[Pastry (DHT)|Pastry distributed hash table]].&lt;ref name="tlaps-survey"/&gt; It is [https://tla.msr-inria.inria.fr/tlaps/content/Home.html distributed separately] from the rest of the TLA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; tools. TLA&lt;sup&gt;+2&lt;/sup&gt; greatly expanded language support for proof constructs.

[[Amazon Web Services]] has used TLA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; since 2011. TLA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; model checking uncovered bugs in [[DynamoDB]], [[Amazon S3|S3]], [[Amazon Elastic Block Store|EBS]], and an internal distributed lock manager; some bugs required state traces of 35 steps. Model checking was also used to verify aggressive optimizations. In addition, TLA&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; specifications were found to hold value as documentation and design aids.&lt;ref name="awsorig"/&gt;&lt;ref name="awschose"&gt;

'''''The Last Mixed Tape''''' is an Irish based daily [[music blog]] founded in February 2014 by critic and journalist Stephen White. The site is composed of reviews, interviews, and news features all written by White, specifically about the Dublin music scene. Although the site is listed as a blog, White has on several occasions distanced himself from the term, preferring to be called a "critic".

The website promotes and critiques the artists coming out of Ireland's independent scene, spanning several genres including [[Indie Music|indie]], [[Electronic music|electronic]], [[post punk]], [[noise pop]] and [[alternative rock]].

==Writing Style &amp; Criticism==
Although White champions Irish indie music, he has been known to be harder on pop acts coming out of the country resulting in a controversial rant about Irish act [[Kodaline]] in which he likened them to "vanilla ice-cream".&lt;ref name="kodaline"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.podcastchart.com/podcasts/the-last-mixed-tape/episodes/the-last-mixed-tape-podcast-episode-two |title=  The Last Mixed Tape Podcast Episode Two | publisher= podccastchart.com |accessdate= 2015-04-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He has also expressed his dislike of [[Hozier (musician)|Hozier]] and referred to his debut album as "uncontrollably melodramatic",&lt;ref name=podcast /&gt; a view not shared by his peers. This has continued to earn the Last Mixed Tape a controversial reputation within the Irish music scene with White's reviews of [[The Coronas]] album 'Trust The Wire' and [[The Strypes]] album 'Spitting Image' being seen as unfair.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://thelastmixedtape.com/2017/06/17/review-the-strypes-spitting-image/|title=Review {{!}} The Strypes – Spitting Image|date=2017-06-17|website=The Last Mixed Tape|access-date=2017-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The Last Mixed Tape continued to earn a negative reputation following a review of [[The Script|the Script’]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s [[Freedom Child]] album, which was described as “toxic” and left “a bad taste”.

==Awards and nominations==
Since its first year ''the Last Mixed Tape'' was nominated for six music blogging awards, the Blog Awards Ireland in 2014, 2015 &amp; 2016&lt;ref name="blogawards"&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.blogawardsireland.com/best-music-blog-finalists-2014/ |title=  Blog Awards Best Music Blog 2014 Finalists | publisher= blogawardsireland.com |accessdate= 2015-04-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and at the Web Awards Ireland in 2014, 2015 &amp; 2016, losing out on all occasions.&lt;ref name="webawards"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://webawards.ie/2014-finalists/ |title=  Web Awards 2014 Finalists | publisher= webawards.ie |accessdate= 2015-04-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9707">'''Thermo-mechanical fatigue''' (short '''TMF''') is the overlay of a cyclical mechanical loading, that leads to [[Fatigue (material)|fatigue]] of a material, with a cyclical thermal loading. Thermo-mechanical fatigue is an important point that needs to be considered, when constructing turbine engines or gas turbines.

==Failure Mechanisms==
There are three mechanisms acting in thermo-mechanical fatigue
*'''[[Creep (deformation)|Creep]]''' is the flow of material at high temperatures
*'''[[Fatigue (material)|Fatigue]]''' is crack growth and propagation due to repeated loading
*'''Oxidation''' is a change in the chemical composition of the material due to environmental factors. The oxidized material is more brittle and prone to crack creation.

Each factor has more or less of an effect depending on the parameters of loading. In phase (IP) thermo-mechanical loading (when the temperature and load increase at the same time) is dominated by creep. The combination of high temperature and high stress is the ideal condition for creep. The heated material flows more easily in tension, but cools and stiffens under compression. Out of phase (OP) thermo-mechanical loading is dominated by the effects of oxidation and fatigue. Oxidation weakens the surface of the material, creating flaws and seeds for crack propagation. As the crack propagates, the newly exposed crack surface then oxidizes, weakening the material further and enabling the crack to extend. A third case occurs in OP TMF loading when the stress difference is much greater than the temperature difference. Fatigue alone is the driving cause of failure in this case, causing the material to fail before oxidation can have much of an effect.&lt;ref&gt;Nagesha, A et al. [https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.msea.2010.05.082 "A comparative study of isothermal and thermomechanical fatigue on type 316L(N) austenitic stainless steel"] '''Materials Science and Engineering: A''', 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

TMF still is not fully understood. There are many different models to attempt to predict the behavior and life of materials undergoing TMF loading. The two models presented below take different approaches.

==Models of Thermo-Mechanical Fatigue==
There are many different models that have been developed in an attempt to understand and explain TMF. This page will address the two broadest approaches, constitutive and phenomenological models. Constitutive models utilize the current understanding of the microstructure of materials and failure mechanisms. These models tend to be more complex, as they try to incorporate everything we know about how the materials fail. These types of models are becoming more popular recently as improved imaging technology has allowed for a better understanding of failure mechanisms. Phenomenological models are based purely on the observed behavior of materials. They treat the exact mechanism of failure as a sort of "black box". Temperature and loading conditions are input, and the result is the fatigue life. These models try to fit some equation to match the trends found between different inputs and outputs.

===Damage Accumulation Model===
The damage accumulation model is a constitutive model of TMF. It adds together the damage from the three failure mechanisms of fatigue, creep, and oxidation.

&lt;math&gt; \frac {1} {N_f} = \frac {1} {N_f^{fatigue}} + \frac {1} {N_f^{oxidation}} + \frac {1} {N_f^{creep}}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;N_f &lt;/math&gt; is the fatigue life of the material, that is, the number of loading cycles until failure. The fatigue life for each failure mechanism is calculated individually and combined to find the total fatigue life of the specimen.&lt;ref&gt;Changan, Chai et al. [http://www.tms.org/pubs/journals/JOM/9904/Cai/Cai-9904.htm "Recent Developments in the Thermomechanical Fatigue Life Prediction of Superalloys"], '''JOM''', April 1999&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.efatigue.com/hightemp/background/tmf.html "Thermo Mechanical Technical Background"]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fatigue====
The life from fatigue is calculated for isothermal loading conditions. It is dominated by the strain applied to the specimen.

&lt;math&gt; \frac {\Delta \epsilon_m} {2} = C(2N_f^{fatigue})^d &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; are material constants found through isothermal testing. Note that this term does not account for temperature effects. The effects of temperature are treated in the oxidation and creep terms..

====Oxidation====
The life from oxidation is affected by temperature and cycle time.

&lt;math&gt; \frac {1} {N_f^{oxidation}} = \left(\frac {h_{cr}\delta_0} {B\Phi^{oxidation}K_p^{eff}}\right)^{\frac {-1} {\beta}} \frac {2(\Delta \dot{\epsilon_m})^{\frac {2} {\beta} +1}} {\epsilon^{1-\alpha / \beta}}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; K_p^{eff} = \frac {1} {t_c} \int_0^t D_0 exp \left(\frac {-Q} {RT(t)} \right) dt&lt;/math&gt;

and &lt;math&gt; \Phi^{oxidation} = \frac {1} {t_c} \int_0^t exp \left[-\frac {1} {2} \left(\frac{(\dot{\epsilon_{th}} / \dot{\epsilon_m}) + 1} {\dot{\zeta}^{oxidation}} \right)^2 \right] dt&lt;/math&gt;

Parameters are found by comparing fatigue tests done in air and in an environment with no oxygen (vacuum or argon). Under these testing conditions, it has been found that the effects of oxidation can reduce the fatigue life of a specimen by a whole order of magnitude. Higher temperatures greatly increase the amount of damage from environmental factors.&lt;ref&gt;Heckel, T. K. et al. [http://www.springerlink.com/content/7232j3t772580465/fulltext.html "Thermomechanical Fatigue of the TiAl Intermetallic Alloy TNB-V2"] '''Experimental Mechanics''', 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

====Creep====
&lt;math&gt; D^{creep} = \Phi^{creep} \int_0^t Ae^{(-\Delta H/RT(t))} \left(\frac {\alpha_1 \bar{\sigma} + \alpha_2 \sigma_H} {K} \right)^m dt &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\Phi^{creep} = \frac {1} {t_c} \int_0^t exp \left[ -\frac {1}{2} \left( \frac {(\dot{\epsilon_{th}}/ \dot{\epsilon_m})-1} {\dot{\zeta}^{creep}} \right)^2 \right] dt&lt;/math&gt;

====Benefit====
The damage accumulation model is one of the most in-depth and accurate models for TMF. It accounts for the effects of each failure mechanism.

====Drawback====
The damage accumulation model is also one of the most complex models for TMF. There are several material parameters that must be found through extensive testing.&lt;ref&gt;Minichmayr, Robert et al. [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6V35-4NCJCRP-2&amp;_user=571676&amp;_coverDate=02%2F29%2F2008&amp;_alid=1572321743&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=high&amp;_orig=search&amp;_origin=search&amp;_zone=rslt_list_item&amp;_cdi=5721&amp;_sort=r&amp;_st=13&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_ct=1&amp;_acct=C000029040&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=571676&amp;md5=be6d57b6fac5d812e66d17e3afabb53b&amp;searchtype=a "Thermo-mechanical fatigue life assessment of aluminum components using the damage rate model of Sehitoglu"] '''International Journal of Fatigue''', 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Strain-Rate Partitioning===
Strain-rate partitioning is a phenomenological model of thermo-mechanical fatigue. It is based on observed phenomenon instead of the failure mechanisms. This model deals only with inelastic strain and ignores elastic strain completely. It accounts for different types of deformation and breaks strain into four possible scenarios:&lt;ref&gt;Zhuang, W. Z. et al. [http://hdl.handle.net/1947/3887 "Thermo-mechanical fatigue life prediction: A critical review"] '''Defence Science and Technology Organisation Publications''', 1998&lt;/ref&gt;
*PP – plastic in tension and compression
*CP – creep in tension and plastic in compression
*PC – plastic in tension and creep in compression
*CC – creep in tension and compression

&lt;!-- [Insert Image] --&gt;

The damage and life for each partition is calculated and combined in the model

&lt;math&gt;\frac {1} {N_f} = \frac {F_{pp}} {N'_{pp}} + \frac {F_{cc}} {N'_{cc}} + \frac {F_{pc}} {N'_{pc}} + \frac {F_{cp}} {N'_{cp}}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; F_{pp}=\frac {\Delta \epsilon_{pp}} {\Delta \epsilon_{inelastic}},   F_{cc}=\frac {\Delta \epsilon_{cc}} {\Delta \epsilon_{inelastic}},   F_{pc}=\frac {\Delta \epsilon_{pc}} {\Delta \epsilon_{inelastic}},   F_{cp}=\frac {\Delta \epsilon_{cp}} {\Delta \epsilon_{inelastic}} &lt;/math&gt;

and &lt;math&gt;N'_{pp} &lt;/math&gt; etc., are found from variations of the equation &lt;math&gt; \Delta \epsilon_{inelastic} = A_{pp}(N'_{pp})^{C_{pp}} &lt;/math&gt;

where A and C are material constants for individual loading.

====Benefit====
Strain-Rate Partitioning is a much simpler model than the damage accumulation model. Because it breaks down the loading into specific scenarios, it can account for different phases in loading.

====Drawback====
The model is based on inelastic strain. This means that it does not work well with scenarios of low inelastic strain, such as brittle materials or loading with very low strain.
This model can be an oversimplification. Because it fails to account for oxidation damage, it may overpredict specimen life in certain loading conditions.

==Looking Forward==
The next area of research is attempting to understand TMF of composites. The interaction between the different materials adds another layer of complexity.

Zhang and Wang are currently investigating the TMF of a unidirectional fiber reinforced matrix. They are using a finite element method that accounts for the known microstructure. They have discovered that the large difference in the thermal expansion coefficient between the matrix and the fiber is the driving cause of failure, causing high internal stress.&lt;ref&gt;Zhang, Junqian and Fang Wang [http://ijd.sagepub.com/content/19/7/851.abstract "Modeling of Damage Evolution and Failure in Fiber-Reinforced Ductile Composites Under Thermomechanical Fatigue Loading"] '''International Journal of Damage Mechanics''', 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Workshops for Careers in the Arts''' was a [[professional training]] program especially designed for artistically talented teenagers which took place on the campus of [[The George Washington University]] in a joint collaboration. Designated a pilot program, Workshops for Careers in the Arts was created in June 1968 by [[Peggy Cooper Cafritz]] and Mike Malone as a means toward the establishment of a [[public high school]] for [[the arts]] in [[Washington, D.C.]].

There were three departments in the school program at the start of its formation. They were in [[Drama]]/[[Theatre]], [[Dance]], and [[Visual Arts]]/[[Painting]]. These departments serviced qualified area students after their normal home school day, on weekends during the academic year, and full time during the summer months. Roughly ninety (90) students were enrolled during the inaugural years. Funding eventually became increasingly available as [[lobbying]], [[grants]], [[Matriculation|enrollment]], [[contributions]], and stellar reputations regarding the program significantly increased.

Students were accepted on the basis of recommendations from area Principals, Teachers, Parents, interviews, and auditions. Talented students who could not otherwise afford such training were given top priority. Workshops for Careers in the Arts enrolled and had diverse students from all over the Washington Metropolitan region. No student was required to pay a tuition.

Upon leaving the program, the students were encouraged to continue their career training. Workshops for Careers in the Arts students began to achieve collegiate full [[scholarships]] and receive [[contracts]] toward higher education. The George Washington University, The Washington School of Ballet, The North Carolina School of the Arts, The Juilliard School and Howard University were some of the very first illustrious [[institutions]] to receive Workshops for Careers in the Arts [[graduates]]. Some graduates had opportunities to start professional careers in their field soon after their departure from the program.

Workshops for Careers in the Arts showed the need for and the results of specialized [[vocational training]] in the arts. As more successful Workshops for Careers in the Arts years past, which included the need for an additional space location on Georgia Avenue at Morton Street, N.W., the Washington community made this opportunity available to their young people on a much broader scale. In the process during 1974, the Duke Ellington High School at Western High School in Washington, D.C. was born. The goal was achieved.

[[Duke Ellington School of the Arts]] was established as an [[accredited]] four (4) year public high school [[curriculum]], combining arts and [[academics]] in the Nation's Capital.

Thanks to the brilliant Staff, Faculty, Students, and Alumni of Workshops for Careers in the Arts.
