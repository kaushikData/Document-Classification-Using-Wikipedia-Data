On October 20, 1981, a [[truck bomb]] exploded outside a [[Portuguese Jewish]] synagogue in the centre of [[Antwerp]], [[Belgium]]. Three people were killed and 106 wounded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Jewish Targets: Recent Attacks | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/07/world/jewish-targets-recent-attacks.html | publisher = The New York Times | date = 1986-09-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bombing==
The explosion blew in the doors and stained-glass windows of the synagogue and smashed storefronts and windows for blocks around.&lt;ref name=NYT1981&gt;{{cite news | title = 2 Killed By Bomb at Antwerp Synagogue | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1981/10/21/world/2-killed-by-bomb-at-antwerp-synagogue.html | publisher = The New York Times | date = 1981-10-21 | first=Paul | last=Lewis}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bomb had been concealed in a delivery truck parked overnight with one wheel removed, as if it had broken down.

The attack took place on a Tuesday morning in the [[Antwerp diamond district|diamond district of Antwerp]], shortly before [[Simchat Torah]] religious services were to begin. It followed by one year the [[1980 Paris synagogue bombing]], which took place on the eve of Simchat Torah. The bombing was condemned as "diabolically wicked" by Belgian [[prime minister]] of the time, [[Mark Eyskens]].&lt;ref name=NYT1981 /&gt;

The Palestinian terror group [[Black September Organization|Black September]] claimed responsibility for the attack.&lt;ref name="UPI"/&gt;

'''African Prisons Project''' (APP) is a charity organization working in Africa with the goal of bringing dignity and hope to prison inmates by improving access to education, healthcare, justice and reintegration into the community. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/law/gallery/2011/oct/17/uganda-capital-punishment|title=The African Prisons Project in Uganda|date=2011-10-17|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded in 2004 by the British activist [[Alexander McLean (activist)|Alexander McLean]], who is currently the director.

== Organizational history ==
[[Image:Donated books arriving at Kamiti Prison.JPG|thumb|220px|Donated books arriving at Kamiti Prison]]
In 2004, [[Alexander McLean (activist)|Alexander McLean]] was volunteering at the [[Mulago Hospital|Mulago hospital]] in [[Kampala]], [[Uganda]]. He worked with a group of prisoners from Luzira Upper Prison. McLean observed that prison inmates were chained to their beds, with no opportunity for sanitation and no proper medical care. Despite of being terminally ill, many patients were left unsupervised. 

[[Alexander McLean (activist)|McLean]] visited the prison during his stay. He purchased materials to renovate the prison's infirmary, and with the support of the prison authorities, supervised the prisoners while they were renovating their own infirmary. One of the questions McLean posed to the inmates was about their needs, he observed an expressed desire for education. 

[[Alexander McLean (activist)|McLean]] returned to the UK where he fundraised and collected books to provide health care facilities to prisons in Uganda and for the establishment of a library at Luzira Upper Prison, to bring education about the law to prison inmates.  This event marked the beginning of  APP. Today, McLean is a member of the [[Tearfund]] Inspired Individuals Programme, along with [[Philemon Ministries|Kelvin Mwikya]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inspiredindividuals.org/index.cfm?i=6818&amp;mid=4&amp;ministryid=21620 |title=Alexander McLean (Uganda) |publisher=Inspired Individuals |date= |accessdate=2011-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Projects ==
APP is a growing UK charity and registered [[NGO]] in East Africa, with permanent bases in [[Kampala]] and [[Nairobi]], the APP community consists of local full-time staff members and a small group of permanent volunteers in the UK. There are a number of projects that APP is leading on, as part of the recently launched 2017 - 2020 strategy. A key priority area of work is establishing the world’s first prison-based law college and law firm, in addition to launching the Okimanyi Project in Kenya.   

As APP continues to evolve and offer basic health and education services, the organization will continue to focus on access to justice and creating robust programmatic structures which will be handed over to Ugandan Prisons Service (UPS) as a legacy project.

{{citation needed|date=February 2011}}

== Condemned Choirs ==
While working in the condemned section of Luzira Maximum Security Proson, McLean observed that groups of condemned prisoners, male and female, had formed choirs to sing at Sunday services, but had also been singing anti-death penalty songs. McLean mentioned to the British volunteer Martyn Ryan, that he would like to record these songs.{{citation needed|date=February 2011}} 

Martyn Ryan and his son Ben Ryan gathered up a group of volunteers in the UK and the team headed to Uganda in December 2007. They spent several days in the prison, recording songs by three separate choirs. Upon return to the UK, the volunteers mixed and produced an album, ''Freedom Cry''. APP used the album to raise awareness of the ongoing constitutional challenge against Uganda's death penalty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.condemnedchoirs.co.uk/ |title=from Luzira Prison, Uganda |publisher=Condemned Choirs |date=2009-03-26 |accessdate=2011-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awards ==
APP and McLean have won several high-profile awards.

* In 2006, McLean was named the Charity Times Volunteer of the Year in the [[UK Charity Awards]]. The award was presented to McLean by [[Prince Edward, Earl of Wessex]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.charitytimes.com/pages/charity_times_awards/pages/2006_finalists/2006_winners/volunteer_of_the_year.htm |title=UK Charity Awards 2006 Volunteer of the Year |publisher=Charitytimes.com |date= |accessdate=2011-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Following the death of [[Alexander the Great]] in 323&amp;nbsp;BC, the Macedonian's conquests were divided amongst the [[diadochi]] at the [[Partition of Babylon]]. The former [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid]] satrapy of [[Medes|Media]] was divided into two states: The greater (southern) part – ''Media Magna'' was assigned to [[Peithon]], one of Alexander's bodyguards. The smaller (northern) region, which had been the sub-satrapy of [[Matiene]], became ''Media Atropatene'' under [[Atropates]], the former Achaemenid governor of all Media, who had by then become father-in-law of [[Perdiccas]], regent of Alexander's designated successor.

Shortly thereafter, Atropates refused to pay allegiance to [[Seleucus I Nicator|Seleucus]], and made Media Atropatene an independent kingdom. It subsequently lost the ''Media'' prefix in the name and came to be known simply as ''Atropatene''. 
The dynasty Atropates founded would rule the kingdom for several centuries, first independently, then as vassals of the [[Parthian Empire|Arsacids]] (who called it 'Aturpatakan'). It was eventually annexed by the Arsacids, who then lost it to the [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanids]], who again called it 'Aturpatakan'. At some time between 639 and 643 the Arabs under the [[Rashidun]] took control of the area during the reign of [[Umar]]. Atropatene formed a separate province of the early Islamic caliphate and was considered to have had strategic importance. It was during the Arab period that [[Middle Iranian languages|Middle Iranian]] (i.e. Parthian and Middle Persian) ''Aturpatakan'' became ''Adarbaygan'', ''Adarbayjan'' or ''Azerbaijan''.

The '''Basic Flying Training School''' is a unit of the [[Belgian Air Component]] located at [[Beauvechain Air Base]].  It consists of 5th Squadron and [[9 Squadron (Belgian Air Force)|9th Squadron]]. Both operate the [[Aermacchi SF.260|SF 260]] "M" &amp; "D" models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mil.be/aircomp/units/index.asp?LAN=nl&amp;FILE=&amp;ID=1314&amp;MENU=1387&amp;PAGE=1 |title=Basic Flying Training School |accessdate=19 December 2011|publisher=Belgian Defence}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main mission of the school is to provide Phase II pilot training (5th Squadron) to the student pilots of the [[Belgian Air Component]]. After successfully completing this course, the students will continue their Phase IIb at 2/8 Sqn in Cazaux (France). After this Phase IIb, the students are assigned to one of three possible [[Tracking (education)|"tracks"]]: fighter, transport or helicopter.

The school also provides a number of courses for confirmed pilots (9th Squadron).

The military glider centre is also part of the BFTS. This small unit, based at [[Goetsenhoven Military Airfield|Goetsenhoven]] operates [[L-21A Super Cub|Piper Cub]]'s in support of the Belgian Air Cadets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.belgian-wings.be/Webpages/Navigator/Belgian_Aviation_History/orbat_010704.htm |title=MCZV/CMVV|accessdate=19 December 2011|publisher=www.belgian-wings.be}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Battle of Domažlice''' ({{lang-cs|Bitva u Domažlic}}) or '''Battle of Taus''' ({{lang-de|Schlacht bei Taus}}) or '''Battle of Tausch''' was fought on 14 August 1431 as the part of the 5th crusade against [[Hussite]]s. The crusade was sent to [[Bohemia]] after negotiations, held in [[Pressburg]] and [[Cheb]], between Hussites and the [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|emperor Sigismund]] had failed.

[[File:Bitva u Domažlic (Battle of Domažlice).jpg|thumb|upright|left|Hussites persecuting the German soldiers after the Battle of Domažlice, romantic painting]]

== Outcome ==
{{Campaignbox Hussite Wars}}

The Imperial army was besieging the city of [[Domažlice]] since 8 August, when the sight of the approaching and singing Hussite relief army led by [[Prokop the Bald]] and hearing their battle hymn "[[Ktož jsú boží bojovníci]]" ("Ye Who are Warriors of God"), led to mass panicking among the crusaders, who fled through the [[Bohemian Forest]]. The Hussites immediately set after the fleeing Imperial army and annihilated its remnants completely. Reportedly, 8,000 wagons and all the equipment of the crusaders were captured. The crusader army was accompanied by [[papal legate]] [[Julian Cesarini]] who escaped, but lost his whole luggage in the retreat, including the secret correspondence and the [[Papal bull]] charging him to hire crusaders.&lt;ref&gt;John William Mears. "Heroes of Bohemia: Huss, Jerome and Zisca." (1879)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Blacklist Studio''' ({{zh|c=黑名單工作室}}) was a group of [[Taiwan]]ese musicians who came together and released a ground-breaking album in 1989 called ''Songs of Madness'' ({{zh|c=抓狂歌}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Play That Indie Music|url=http://taiwanreview.nat.gov.tw/ct.asp?xItem=137786&amp;CtNode=1337|publisher=Taiwan Review|accessdate=2012-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reportedly five years in the making, this work came out at a critical juncture in [[History of Taiwan|Taiwan's history]], two years after the lifting of the decades-long [[martial law]]. The album was critical in the formation of the genre known as [[New Taiwanese Song]].

Its members included [[Wang Ming Hui]] ({{zh|c=王明輝}}), [[Chen Ming Chang]] ({{zh|c=陳明章}}), [[Lin Wei Zhe]]({{zh|c=林暐哲}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Storytelling Guitarist - Chen Ming-chang Rediscovers His Youth|url=http://www.taiwan-panorama.com/en/show_issue.php?id=201180008100E.TXT&amp;table=3&amp;cur_page=1&amp;distype=text|publisher=Taiwan Panorama|accessdate=2012-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first album's notes reveal the seriousness with which the group assessed its own role in Taiwan's musical development.  They believed that [[Taiwanese music]] ought to reflect the times, that it was important for the new generations to "correctly" see the relationship between the [[mother tongue]] and themselves.  Unlike virtually all other previous works, their songs sought to engage post-World War II social changes in a frank, [[Realism (arts)|realist]] way.

The songs' styles cover [[Taiwanese folk]], [[hip hop music|rap]], and [[Rock and roll|rock]].  One song has a clip of the [[Republic of China]] [[national anthem]].  Another samples environmental sounds from the street.  Most of the songs told stories, sometimes through humorous or ironic dialogues between ordinary citizens.  [[Taiwanese Minnan|Taiwanese]] is used extensively in many of the songs.

'''"Chi sarà con te"''' ([[English language|English]] translation: "Who Will Be With You") was the [[Italy|Italian]] entry in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1973]], performed in [[Italian language|Italian]] by [[Massimo Ranieri]].

The song is a ballad, with Ranieri describing his feelings as he waits for a date to arrive. Unusually, however, he describes them to the imagined presence of a former lover (who apparently dated him one year previously). He wonders how his own date will go and also how hers will turn out. This was quite a disappointing performance considering the song selection. Most other countries would allow the singer to perform their winning song from the national contest to sing it in the ESC. Massimo would have been better off singing "Erba di Casa Mia", which he could have a better chance of winning or getting higher than a miserable 13th place.

The song was performed tenth on the night (following [[Yugoslavia]]'s [[Zdravko Čolić]] with "[[Gori vatra]]" and preceding [[Luxembourg]]'s [[Anne-Marie David]] with "[[Tu te reconnaîtras]]"). At the close of voting, it had received 74 points, placing 13th in a field of 17.

It was succeeded as [[Italy in the Eurovision Song Contest|Italian representative]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1974|1974 Contest]] by [[Gigliola Cinquetti]] with "[[Sì (song)|Sì]]".

Some people consider the melodic structure of this song to a very high degree similar to the sixth palaced son of the 1968 [[Festival di Sanremo]] ''Quando m'innamoro'', which was there interpreted by [[Anna Identici]] and [[The Sandpipers]], but more successful in the version of [[Gigliola Cinquetti]] and a global success as ''Man without Love'' by [[Engelbert Humperdinck (singer)|Engelbert Humperdinck]].{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

{{Politics}}

The '''Commonwealth Parliamentary Association''' ('''CPA'''), previously known as the '''Empire Parliamentary Association''',  is an organisation which works to support [[good governance]], [[democracy]] and [[human rights]]. 

As of 1989, the CPA acknowledges as [[Patron]] – the [[Head of the Commonwealth]], [[Elizabeth II|Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth II]] – and as Vice-Patron, by rotation [[Heads of State]] or Heads of Government of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth national government]] hosting its upcoming annual Commonwealth Parliamentary Conference. The Association's supreme authority is the [[General Assembly]], constituted by delegates to the annual Commonwealth Parliamentary Conference.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wikinewsindia.com/tag/commonwealth-parliamentary-conference/ www.wikinewsindia.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151005085040/http://www.wikinewsindia.com/tag/commonwealth-parliamentary-conference/ |date=2015-10-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The business and activities of the CPA are managed by an Executive Committee, which reports to the General Assembly. The CPA's funds are derived from membership fees paid by its [[Executive (government)|branches]], as well as from two [[trust fund]]s and benefactors.

The official publication of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association is ''The Parliamentarian'', the [[Magazine|Journal]] of Commonwealth Parliaments. The organisation administers the Commonwealth Women Parliamentarians (CWP), a network across the Commonwealth which promotes greater representation for women in Parliament, the CPA Small Branches network, representing parliaments and legislatures with populations below 500,000 people, and the [[Commonwealth Youth Parliament]], an annual gathering of young people hosted by a Commonwealth Parliament.

The Commonwealth Parliamentary Association (CPA) currently has approximately 180 branches and is divided into nine regions – [[Africa]]; [[Asia]]; [[Australia]]; [[British Overseas Territories|British Islands and Mediterranean]]; [[Canada]]; [[Caribbean]], [[Atlantic Ocean|Americas and Atlantic]]; [[India]]; [[Pacific]], and [[South-East Asia]]. The CPA Headquarters Secretariat is based in [[London]].

[[File:Taking on the narcotics trade in Helmand.jpg|thumb|alt=Bust-length photograph of a man in uniform.|Lieutenant Colonel Abdul Qadir, Director of the Helmand Counter Narcotics Police.]]
The '''Counter Narcotics Police of Afghanistan''' ('''CNPA''') is specialist force under the [[Interior Minister of Afghanistan|Afghan Ministry of Interior Affairs]] created in January 2003. The CNPA is the lead agency for counter narcotics investigations in Afghanistan and has an establishment of some 3000 officers.  Candidates for the 5-week long Counter Narcotics Course must have completed an 8-week basic police course and are carefully selected.

The busiest and most successful CNPA unit in Afghanistan is situated in [[Lashkar Gah]], the provincial capital of [[Helmand Province]].  The [[United Kingdom]] funds a retired police officer to work in the Helmand Provincial Reconstruction Team to assist the CNPA with their training and development programme.  The operations advisor for Helmand CNPA is a senior British military officer who provides guidance on intelligence-led operations and also accompanies the CNPA on interdiction operations throughout Helmand Province, providing direction on evidence gathering and intelligence exploitation.

The Director of the Helmand Counter Narcotics Police is Lieutenant Colonel Abdul Qadir.  In addition to seizing drugs and arresting those involved in drug trafficking, Lt Col Qadir's team targets those involved in facilitating heroin production, including opium dealers and suppliers/distributors of precursor chemicals.
Very often the CNPA officers and their families will live in the same neighbourhood as those involved in drug trafficking. This poses a huge security problem as the officers fear retribution if they take action.

'''DFS-Kopernikus 3''' (or '''Deutscher Fernmelde Satellit-3''' and '''HellasSat 1''') was a [[communications satellite]] operated by [[Deutsche Telekom]].

== Satellite ==
The DFS series of satellites debuted in 1989 with the third being launched in 1992. Ordered in 1983 and produced by the GESAT consortium of [[Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm|MBB]] (flight segment prime contractor), [[Siemens]] (overall prime contractor), [[ANT Nachrichtentechnik]] (payload), [[Standard Elektrik Lorenz]] (digital switching equipment), and [[Dornier Flugzeugwerke|Dornier]] Systems (ground control system), DFS spacecraft are smaller than TV-Sat: on-station mass of DFS is {{convert|850|kg|lb}} with a {{convert|15.4|m|ft}} solar array span providing up to 1.5 kilowatts of electrical power. The satellite also used a propulsion system S400.

The communications payload includes ten 14/11-12 [[GHz]] [[transponder]]s with five spares and one experimental 30/20&amp;nbsp;GHz transponder with one spare. At the end of 1994 DFS 1-3 were stationed at 33.5 degrees east, 28.5 degrees east, and 23.5 degrees east, respectively. Like TV-Sat, the DFS Kopernikus series has been concluded.

DFS 3 was leased to the Greek company [[Hellas Sat]] in 2002 as a stop-gap measure. It was retired in 2003.

== Launch ==
DFS-Kopernikus 3 was launched by a [[Delta (rocket family)|Delta]] rocket from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]], [[Florida]], [[United States]], at 09:47 UTC on October 12, 1992.&lt;ref name="nssdc"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/spacecraftDisplay.do?id=1992-066A|title=DFS Kopernikus 3 |work=NSSDC Master Catalog|accessdate=May 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''"Die ganze Welt braucht Liebe"''' (The whole world needs love) was the [[Austria in the Eurovision Song Contest|Austrian]] entry in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1958]], performed in [[German Language|German]] by [[Liane Augustin]].

The song was performed ninth on the night (following [[Germany]]'s [[Margot Hielscher]] with "[[Für zwei Groschen Musik]]" and preceding [[Switzerland]]'s [[Lys Assia]] with "[[Giorgio (song)|Giorgio]]"). The song is a ballad, in which Augustin sings that the entire world needs love and asks if it should be any different for her. She answers her own rhetorical question in the negative.

At the close of voting, the song had received 8 points, placing it fifth in a field of 10. The song was succeeded as [[Austria in the Eurovision Song Contest|Austrian representative]] in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1959]] by [[Ferry Graf]] singing "[[Der K und K Kalypso aus Wien]]".

'''''Drückender Tango''''' (''Oppressive Tango'') is a collection of short stories by [[Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel Prize]]-winning author [[Herta Müller]]. It was Müller's second book, published in 1984 in [[Bucharest]].&lt;ref name="Haines and Marven" /&gt; After its publication, Müller was no longer allowed to publish her work in Romania and she moved to Germany.&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt; Reviews in Germany had been positive for ''Drückender Tango'', by contrast with the criticism it received in the Romanian press.&lt;ref name="Nobel" /&gt; Today, it has been described as one of Muller's best-known books.&lt;ref name="Telegraph" /&gt;

The stories are mainly about the harshness of life in a small village in the [[Socialist Republic of Romania]], which was still under the control of [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]] at the time they were written.&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nobel" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Telegraph" /&gt; Urban life is also featured.&lt;ref name="Haines and Marven" /&gt; The name of the collection may be in reference to Romanian-born German poet [[Paul Celan]]'s ''[[Todesfuge]]'' (1948), which was translated as ''Tangoul mortii'' (''Death Tango'') in Romania.{{sfn|Haines|Marven|2013|p=43}}

'''''Front Line''''' is a weekly English radio program produced by [[China Radio International]] discussing about life in modern China.  The flavor of the program is much like [[National Public Radio|NPR's]] ''[[Morning Edition]]'' and ''[[All Things Considered]]''.  The program combines news, analysis, commentary, interviews, and special features, but from a Chinese perspective.

The program airs on [[Round the Clock (radio)|Round the Clock]] and is available on the podcasts through the [[WRN Broadcast|World Radio Network]] on the Monday edition in the United States, Tuesday edition in Beijing.

The host of ''Front Line'' is [[Wu Jia]].

==Examples of topics discussed==
===Beauty Salon Scam===
In October 2006, Front Line discussed about how a woman was scammed into buying skin treatment from a beauty salon that claimed that the treatment will permanently make her look younger.  The treatment turned out to be a stem cell injection that caused many problems for the buyer.  The problems amounted to huge spots on her face accompanied by serious itching.  At first she did not think the problems were caused by the treatment until many months later.  Eventually after countless doctors visits, the woman eventually traced the problem back to the beauty salon.  The woman did receive compensation.  However, the consequences of the treatment cannot be erased.

===Mice Love Rice Scandal===
Sometime in the middle of 2006, Front Line discussed about how [[Yang Chengang]] came into trouble with the copyright holders of a song he wrote that became an instant hit throughout Asia.  Yang Chengang was a school teacher in China and the artist of the popular song "[[Mice Love Rice]]".  In the mid 1990s, he sold the copyright of the song to [[Emperor Entertainment Group]] and then later signed another agreement with another record label.  When the second record label distributed his song, the original copyright holder Emperor Entertainment Group sued the other record label only to find out that Yang Chengang was the one who double sold the song.

===Garbage Collector raises Four Orphaned Daughters===
In another October 2006 program, Front Line discussed how a garbage collector found 4 abandoned baby girls.  The story was a touching story of how this person spent all of his savings to feed these children.  In the end, his neighbors noticed this person and donated some personals for his cause.  This influenced the decision of the orphan center to not take custody of the four girls, but rather make an exception to the rule by providing money and food to support them.

'''Ha-Comedy Store''' (Hebrew: הקומדי סטור, 'The Comedy Store') was an Israeli entertainment program which was broadcast on the Israeli  [[Channel 2 (Israel)|Channel 2]] between the years [[1994 in television|1994]]-[[1996 in television|1996]]. In its prime it starred [[Zvika Hadar]], [[Assaf Ashtar]], [[Ruby Duenyas]], [[Gil Sassover]] and [[Itai Segev]].

The show scheduled weekly consisted different short [[non-sense]] styled skits including recurring nooks, such as "JoJo Ticked-Off" (החלסטרה של ז'וז'ו, ''HaKhalastra shel Zhozho'') and "Jacques' Bulletin" (המבזק של ז'ק, ''HaMivzak shel Zhak'') and music segments which were mostly parodies of famous Israeli songs.

During the first seasons, the show won a great success, and coined a number of unique expressions to the Hebrew language such as "Laflaf" (לפלף, 'nerd'; plural 'laflafim' לפלפים), "[[Jojo Khalastra|Khalastra]]" (חלסטרה, a slang word used by 'JoJo' to describe his resent and anger at various things on his nook 'JoJo Ticked-Off'). The character which is mostly remembered and identified with the show is apparently Jojo Halastra, played by Tzvika Hadar, which was a parody on the Israeli ''[[Ars (slang)|Ars]]''.

In 1995 a "Ha-Comedy Store" album was released containing all of the most popular songs and skits.

After the third season the shows' popularity descended after some of the actors left the show.

These centers may also provide geographic areas of specializations, offer internship or study-abroad opportunities, and/or give support services to university students.

One of the earliest centers for international studies was founded in 1935 at [[Yale University]]. The Yale Institute for International Studies sought to establish a central point of contact for teaching and research on international affairs, societies, and cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=MacMillan Center expands commitment to graduate education with conference travel grants |url=https://macmillan.yale.edu/news/macmillan-center-expands-commitment-graduate-education-conference-travel-grants |website=Yale MacMillan Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1960s, it was renamed the Concilium on International and Area Studies, and later became the Yale Center for International and Area Studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=History |url=https://macmillan.yale.edu/overview/history |website=Yale MacMillan Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars felt that scholars at the institute conducted too much research as individuals rather than in groups. Eight of these scholars moved to [[Princeton University]] where they founded the [[Center of International Studies]] in 1951.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=International Studies, The Center of, |url=http://etcweb.princeton.edu/CampusWWW/Companion/center_international_studies.html |website=A Princeton Companion}}&lt;/ref&gt; Institutes similar to those at Yale and Princeton soon emerged in the 1950s at [[Harvard University]] and the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]].

"'''Jalla Dansa Sawa'''" (meaning Come on and dance together) is a 2013 song by [[Sweden|Swedish]] singer of Iranian origin [[Behrang Miri]] which was performed in [[Melodifestivalen 2013]]. In the vocals, he is accompanied by [[Malmö]] local artists the American-Swede [[Loulou Lamotte]] and Italian-Swede [[Oscar Zia]], a contestant in the 2012 series of Swedish ''[[X Factor (Sweden)|X Factor]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.svt.se/melodifestivalen/behrang Svt.se: ] {{sv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A song co-written by Anderz Wrethov, Firas Razak Tuma, Tacfarinas Yamoun and by Behrang Miri himself, it is a [[multilingualism|trilingual]] song in [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[French language|French]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]].

"Jalla dansa sawa" was first performed in the 2013 Melodifestivalen fourth semi-final held on 23 February 2013 in [[Malmö Arena]], [[Malmö]] coming 3rd/4th that qualified it to Andra Chansen (Second Chance) round that was held in [[Löfbergs Lila Arena]], [[Karlstad]] on 2 March 2013. In a duel with [[Anton Ewald]] song "[[Begging (Anton Ewald song)|Begging]]", it failed to move on to the finals of the competition.

Despite this, the song gained great popularity with the Swedish public and the single was released immediately after the competition reaching number four on [[Sverigetopplistan]], the official Swedish Singles Chart.

==Music video==
A music video was released with added [[English language]] lyrics&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Ono1W5yqO8 "Jalla dansa sawa" English-version music video directed by Fernando Illezca]&lt;/ref&gt; replacing most of the basic Swedish lyrics with English ones, in addition to adding a long introduction footage in [[Persian language]] alluding to Behrang Miri's infancy. The music video ends with footage and slogans in [[Spanish language]] alluding to popular protests in Latin America. The music video also keeps most original refrain sections in [[Swedish language|Swedish]], [[French language|French]] and [[Arabic language|Arabic]] making the song even more appealing internationally.

The English language version music video is directed and produced by Fernando Illezca.

The music video makes additional references for Miri's activism in immigration issues, with further references to social justice, gentrification, racial discrimination, censorship and grass roots popular revolts, and other issues.

[[image:JokerMagazineLogo.jpg|thumb|right|200px|''Joker'']]
'''''Joker''''' is a [[Slovenia]]n monthly [[magazine]]. Started as a [[Computer and video games|computer gaming]] magazine, it has expanded into reviewing books, movies, educational articles of a general nature and much more. Known for having an interesting writing style which also includes [[archaism|archaic]] and [[neologism|neologistic]] [[Slovene language|Slovene]] words.

''Joker'' was founded in May 1992 under the wing of ''[[Moj mikro]]''. The first edition was [[duotone]] and because of poor sales it was cancelled. In September 1993 it was revived as a [[a5 paper size|half-sized]] addition to ''Moj Mikro''. In January 1994 it had grown into an independent magazine of full size format. A [[compact disc]] was added in December 1995 and a website was launched in March 1996. In December 2000 ''Joker'' became the first Slovenian magazine and one of the first in the world to include a [[DVD]] with every copy. Since 2015 Joker has also a digital edition for iOS and Android.

It also has a [http://www.joker.si/ website] with an archive containing much of the content from the magazine and one of the largest Slovenian online message boards called [http://www.joker.si/mn3njalnik/ mn3njalnik]. [http://www.joker.si/mn3njalnik/index.php?showforum=17 Gnojišče] is sub forum on this board and is the Slovenian equivalent of [[4chan#.2Fb.2F|/b/]].

'''"L'amour s'en va"''' ("Love goes away") was the [[Monaco|Monegasque]] entry in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1963]], composed and performed in [[French language|French]] by French singer and actress [[Françoise Hardy]].

==Background==
Hardy had had her breakthrough as an 18-year-old in late 1962 with the [[yé-yé]] hit "[[Tous les garçons et les filles (song)|Tous les garçons et les filles]]", which sold some 700,000 copies in France alone,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infodisc.fr/S_ToutTemps.php?debut=250 Bestsellers Les Meilleures Ventes Tout Temps de 45 T. / Singles, InfoDisc] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081113170508/http://www.infodisc.fr/S_ToutTemps.php?debut=250 |date=2008-11-13 }}, accessed on line April 30, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; and she would go on to become one of the [[francophone]] world's most successful and popular artists of the 1960s - as well as an influential [[fashion icon]].

"L'amour s'en va" is in the ''chanson'' style, popular in the early years of the Contest. Hardy sings about a relationship which is conducted in the knowledge that love is a fleeting thing - however this does not seem to matter to either of the lovers involved, as they ''"chase after it"''. Hardy also recorded the song in Italian and German, as "L'amore va" and "Die Liebe geht", respectively.

The song was performed fifteenth on the night (following Belgium's [[Jacques Raymond]] with "[[Waarom?]]" and preceding [[Luxembourg]]'s [[Nana Mouskouri]] with "[[À force de prier]]"). At the close of voting, it had received 25 points, placing 5th in a field of 16. "L'amour s'en va" however went on to win Hardy the prestigious French award [[Grand Prix du Disque]] in 1963 and some forty years after its original release the song still counts as one of her signature tunes.

It was succeeded as [[Monaco in the Eurovision Song Contest|Monegasque representative]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1964|1964 Contest]] by [[Romuald Figuier|Romuald]] with "[[Où sont-elles passées]]".

The '''Ministry of Regional and Local Government, Housing and Rural Development''' (MRLGHRD) is a ministry of the [[Government of Namibia]]. The ministry, under its current minister [[Charles Namoloh]] is responsible for regional governance (Regional Councils) and local governance (Local Authorities) and therewith plays an important role in the decentralisation process of the Namibian government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |url         = http://www.mrlgh.gov.na/
 |title       = Ministry of Regional and Local Government, Housing and Rural Development
 |publisher   = Government of Namibia
 |accessdate  = 27 December 2013
 |deadurl     = yes

 |archivedate = 14 July 2007
 |df          = 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Directorates==
The ministry is divided into five directorates:

The program is implemented by this directorate.

=== Rural Development === 
Supports development outside Namibian towns, especially in defined growth point. Its aim is to provide a high living standards the rural population and therewith reduce the rate of rural-urban migration.

=== Directorate for Decentralisation Coordination ===
Supports the ongoing decentralisation process within the Namibian government system and oversees the process of handing various mandates from central government to regional and local authorities annually.

=== Finance, Human Resources, Administration and Information Technology === 
Is the administrative directorate of the ministry and ensures its efficient service delivery.

==Agencies==
The MRLGHRD can create semi-independent agencies to operate within its directorates. Currently the following agency exists:
=== Local Economic Development Agency (LEDA) ===
The Local Economic Development Agency came into being with the launch of the Namibian Local Economic Development White Paper in July 2011. It has since hosted an annual conference for LED practitioners at Local Authorities and Regional Councils throughout Namibia. The agency supports the decentralised Namibian government authorities in creating enabling business environments. Its services are categorised as capacity building, LED strategy development, LED strategy implementation, funding and networking. The agency currently has offices in [[Windhoek]] and [[Oshakati]].

The '''Iraqi National Guard''' (NG; {{lang-ar|الحرس الوطني, al-Ḥaras al-Waṭanī}}) was part of the new [[Military of Iraq]] but has since been absorbed by the [[Iraqi Army]] controlled by the [[Iraqi interim government|interim government]]. Following the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], United States [[Coalition Provisional Authority]] Chief [[Paul Bremer]] disbanded the military apparatus of [[Iraq]] as existed under [[Saddam Hussein]]. As the security situation in occupied Iraq deteriorated and the [[Iraqi insurgency (Iraq War)|Iraqi insurgency]] became increasingly active, the U.S. set up, recruited and trained the new security force in order to combat the insurgency. Despite attacks by insurgent and terrorist groups, the Iraqi National Guard was able to recruit many Iraqis from the vast ranks of the unemployed. The force has been used to assist Coalition troops in combatting the insurgency. However, there have been several instances where they have refused to take military action against fellow Iraqis, such as in [[Fallujah]], deserted, or allegedly aided the resistance. 

In September 2004, a senior member, General Talib al-Lahibi was arrested on suspicion of having links with insurgent groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/3691540.stm |title=Middle East &amp;#124; US arrests senior Iraqi commander |publisher=BBC News |date=2004-09-26 |accessdate=2012-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2004, it was announced that the Iraqi National Guard would be dissolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/4133039.stm |title=Middle East &amp;#124; Iraq to dissolve National Guard |publisher=BBC News |date=2004-12-29 |accessdate=2012-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; At this time its strength was officially over 40,000 men.

==New National Guard==
In 2016 the [[Iraqi parliament]] approved a draft law &lt;ref&gt;http://www.sotkurdistan.net/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;id=43679:%D9%86%D8%B5-%D9%82%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%88%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AD%D8%B1%D8%B3-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%88%D8%B7%D9%86%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%82%D9%8A&amp;Itemid=211&lt;/ref&gt; to recreate a National Guard. The draft law has raised disputes between political parties, and parliament has not yet set a date to take further action. Supporters believe the proposal eventually will be approved. &lt;ref&gt; http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2016/01/iraq-sunnis-join-shiite-popular-mobilization-forces.html#ixzz4UzEnBklK.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.alhurra.com/a/iraq-national-guards/280316.html Arabic only&lt;/ref&gt;

More details: [[Visa requirements for Northern Cypriot citizens]]]]

'''Northern Cypriot passports''' are issued to citizens of the self-declared state of [[Northern Cyprus]] (TRNC) for the purpose of international travel. The passport is valid in only a few countries in the world due to the [[Foreign relations of Northern Cyprus|limited international recognition of Northern Cyprus]]. A Northern Cypriot passport is valid in [[Anguilla]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gov.ai/immigration/forms/Immigration_visa_requirements_anguilla_2007.pdf Anguilla Official Website] Visa Requirements for Anguilla&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pakistan]], [[Tanzania]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://immigration.go.tz/module1.php?id=31 Tanzania, Official Government Website, Visa] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304090034/http://immigration.go.tz/module1.php?id=31 |date=2016-03-04 }} Name of the Country: Northern Cyprus&lt;/ref&gt; [[Turkey]], and the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.trncinfo.com/index.asp?page=272  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528043841/http://www.trncinfo.com/index.asp?page=272 |date=May 28, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=WQ&amp;reference=E-2015-005940&amp;format=XML&amp;language=EN European Parliament]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Turkish Cypriot]]s are also issues [[Turkish passport]]s.&lt;ref name=anthro&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Psychology Press| isbn = 978-0-415-30409-2| last = Conference| first = Association of Social Anthropologists| title = Human Rights in Global Perspective: Anthropological Studies of Rights, Claims and Entitlements| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bagvCwvAGVsC&amp;pg=PA84 |date = 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 1994 entry to the [[United Kingdom]] was easier on an "unrecognised" TRNC passport then a Turkish passport. Many [[Kurdish people|Kurds]] and other political dissidents paid high prices to obtain TRNC passports which they used to enter the UK visa-free and claim [[political asylum|asylum]].&lt;ref name=anthro /&gt;

The '''Otakars''' (or von Traungaus) were a medieval dynasty ruling the Imperial [[March of Styria]] from 1056 to 1192.

==History==
The dynasty began with Otakar I, probably a son or son-in-law of [[Aribo of Austria|Aribo]] (c.850{{spaced ndash}}909), margrave in [[March of Pannonia|Pannonia]] under King [[Arnulf of Carinthia|Arnulf]]. Otakar was Count of [[Steyr]] in the [[Traun (river)|Traungau]], in what is today [[Upper Austria]]. Together with Margrave [[Luitpold, Margrave of Bavaria|Luitpold]], he may have been killed at the 907 [[Battle of Pressburg]]. His descendant [[Ottokar I of Styria|Ottokar I]] (died 1064), Count in the [[Chiemgau]], became ruler of the [[Carantania]]n march in 1056.

The Carantanian march, then subject to the [[Duchy of Carinthia]], was subsequently named [[March of Styria]] ({{lang-de|Steiermark}}) after the dynasty's original seat at Steyr. In 1180 Margrave [[Ottokar IV, Duke of Styria|Ottokar IV]] gained the ducal title from Emperor [[Frederick I, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick I Barbarossa]], thereby establishing the [[Duchy of Styria]]. The reign of the Otakars however ended with the extinction of the line upon Duke Ottokar's death in 1192. In the [[Georgenberg Pact]] of 1186 he had agreed that his lands should pass to [[Leopold V, Duke of Austria|Leopold V]], the [[House of Babenberg|Babenberg]] Duke of [[Archduchy of Austria|Austria]].

[[Image:WWIchartX.svg|thumb|450px|A diagrammatic illustration of European political alliances just before World War I.]] 
The '''powder keg of Europe''' or '''Balkan powder keg''' was the [[Balkans]] in the early part of the 20th century preceding [[World War I]]. There were a number of overlapping claims to territories and [[spheres of influence]] between the major European powers such as the [[Russian Empire]], the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], the [[German Empire]] and, to a lesser degree, the [[Ottoman Empire]], the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Kingdom of Italy]].  

In addition to the imperialistic ambitions and interests in this region, there was a growth in nationalism with the indigenous peoples of this region leading to the formation of the independent states of [[Greece]], [[Serbia]], [[Montenegro]], [[Bulgaria]], [[Romania]] and [[Albania]].

== Background ==
{{see also|History of the Balkans|Rise of nationalism in the Ottoman Empire}}
== Irredentism in the Balkans and the Great Powers ==
Within these nations there were movements to create "greater" nations, that is to enlarge the boundaries of the state beyond those areas where the national ethnic group was in the majority (''[[irredentism]]'').  This led to conflict between the newly independent nations and the empire from which they split, the [[Ottoman Empire]]. Additionally, it led to differences between the Balkan nations who wished to gain territory at the expense of their neighbours.  Both the conflict with the Ottoman Empire and between the Balkan nations led to the [[Balkan Wars]] in 1912–13. 

In a different vein, the ideology of [[Pan-Slavism]] in Balkans gained popularity; the movement built around it in the region sought to unite all of the [[Slavs]] of the Balkans into one nation, [[Yugoslavia]].  This, however, would require the union of several Balkan states and territory which was part of Austria-Hungary.  For this reason, Pan-Slavism was strongly opposed by Austria-Hungary, while it was supported by Russia which viewed itself as leader of all Slavic nations.

To complicate matters, in the years preceding [[World War I]], there existed a tangle of [[Great Power]] alliances, both formal and informal, public and secret.  Following the [[Napoleonic Wars]] there had existed a [[Balance of power in international relations|"balance of power"]] to, in theory, prevent major wars.  This theory held that opposing combinations of powers in Europe would be evenly matched entailing that any general war  would be far too costly for any nation to risk entering.  This system began to fall apart as the Ottoman Empire which had been seen as a check on Russian power began to crumble, and as Germany, which had been a loose [[confederation]] of minor states, was united into a major power.  Not only did these changes lead to a realignment of power, but of interests as well.

All these factors, and many others, conspired to bring about the First World War.  As is insinuated by the name "the powder keg of Europe," the Balkans were not the major issue at stake in the war, but were merely the catalyst that led to the conflagration.  The Chancellor of Germany in the late 19th century, [[Otto von Bismarck]], correctly predicted it would be the source of major conflict in [[Europe]].

The powder keg "exploded" causing the [[First World War]], which began with a conflict between imperial Austria-Hungary and Pan-Slavic Serbia.  [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria]], a member of the Austrian royal family, was assassinated by a Bosnian of Serb extraction, a member of the [[Young Bosnia]] movement.  Austria-Hungary then issued an [[ultimatum]] to Serbia intended to provoke it to war through extreme demands.  The Serbian government reservedly accepted all of the conditions of the ultimatum, except for condition number six which demanded the inclusion of Austria-Hungary in Serbia's judicial inquiry into the assassination.  

Serbia indicated this would be unconstitutional and a violation of its sovereignty, and Austria-Hungary used it as a [[casus belli]] to invade Serbia.  With Germany fully supporting them, the Austro-Hungarians partially [[mobilization|mobilized]] their army against Serbia, which had already begun mobilizing before replying to the Austro-Hungarian [[July Ultimatum]].  Russia then began mobilizing in support of Serbia, though not bound by treaty to do so.  Due to the system of European alliances, this led to a series of escalating Austrian and Russian mobilizations and eventually Britain and France were also obliged to mobilize and declare war.

The term [[public diplomacy]] was first coined and used by Edmund Gullion in 1965 and the concept developed gradually.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;{{rp|528}} More recently, the definition of public diplomacy differs according to different authors. Taehwan Kim in his article "Paradigm Shift in Diplomacy: A Conceptual Model for Korea's "New Public Diplomacy"" defines it as "a diplomatic practice or field of academic research which includes non-conventional actors (such as NGOs or civil societies) to promote diplomacy of the people".&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;{{rp|529}} As the importance of public diplomacy increases, South Korea is putting more efforts to engage in the new trend of diplomacy. Muzaffar S. Abduazimov in his article "Public Diplomacy: Reappraising the South Korean Case through an Evolutionary Approach" presents four evolutionary periods of South Korean public diplomacy: origins (late 1940s-late 1980s), diversification (early 1990s), polycentrism (early 2000s), and institutionalization (2011–present).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Abduazimov|first=Muzaffar S.|date=Autumn 2017|title=Public Diplomacy: Reappraising the South Korean Case through an Evolutionary Approach|url=https://www.ekoreajournal.net/issue/view_pop.htm?Idx=3761|journal=Korea Journal|volume=57 |issue=3|pages=83–111|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Categories ==
Diverse realms of public diplomacy exist within South Korea including knowledge diplomacy, [[cultural diplomacy]], Korean studies diplomacy, corporate diplomacy and sports and tourism diplomacy.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;{{rp|531}}
# Knowledge Diplomacy&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;{{rp|545}}
Knowledge diplomacy is a sub-category of public diplomacy which utilizes a nation's successful policies, institutions, and values, accumulated and formulated through its own historical development, as [[soft power]] assets. As information becomes the most important asset for people in the 21st century, there exists a race to acquire more information which is dispersed in massive quantity with diverse methods. Under the given circumstances, it is imperative to note that abundant information is likely to contribute to miscommunication and misunderstanding which can further lead to potential conflicts. Thus, disseminating correct information and knowledge through communication is essential. When South Korea attempts to practice knowledge diplomacy, its dissemination of Korean Values should not conflict with the universal values.

== South Korea's soft power through the Korean Wave and Hallyu ==
{{Original research section|date=July 2017}}

The creators of ''Hallyu'' or the [[Korean Wave]] attempt to create it so that people from other countries will like it is by focusing on the commonalities between Korea and other countries.&amp;nbsp; The thought process behind that technique of packaging is the fact that the Koreans feel if people from other countries see them as similar people they are more likely to have a positive opinion of Korea and Korean culture/pop culture; Kuwahara calls this technique of focusing on similarities "psychic distance".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kuwahara|first=Yasue|date=2014|title=Korean Wave: Korean Popular Culture in Global Context|url=|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp; Another goal of looking the psychic distance is the attempt to make the products more easily marketable. &amp;nbsp;The Koreans want to get rid of any obstacle or tentativeness that people from other countries may have about Korea and they see the use of ''Hallyu'' as a way to accomplish that goal.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&amp;nbsp; The Korean government also had the goal of affecting other countries through these uses of their pop culture.

Kuwahara indicates that Korea used "soft power" to impact other countries; soft power simply means anything except military used to influence other countries.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&amp;nbsp; Due to the fact that Korea can not truly compete against other countries like the United States and China with very large and powerful militaries, this use of soft power through promotion of the Korean pop culture is a viable option for them in terms of their relationships with other countries.&amp;nbsp; Age and newness also play roles in the effect that this technique has on other countries in the eyes of the Koreans. Additionally, Hallyu "has enlarged the circle of [South Korean] public diplomacy actors, structurally transforming it from solely state-led activity into polycentric framework of public and private partnership", leading it to polycentrism period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Abduazimov|first=Muzaffar S.|date=Autumn 2017|title=Public Diplomacy: Reappraising the South Korean Case through an Evolutionary Approach|url=https://www.ekoreajournal.net/issue/view_pop.htm?Idx=3761|journal=Korea Journal|volume=57 |issue=3|pages=100|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== South Korea's MOFA and public diplomacy ==
The South Korean Ministry of Foreign Affairs is initiating a new approach to expand its public diplomatic practices. There is a separate section in the website of [http://www.mofa.go.kr/trade/cultural/public/index.jsp?menu=m_30_170_100#confirm South Korean MOFA on public diplomacy] to provide information on what public diplomacy is, on the historical background and on the initiatives being taken. Moreover, there exists a [http://www.publicdiplomacy.go.kr/index.jsp public diplomacy portal] under the MOFA which will enable more people to engage in the development of South Korea's public diplomacy.

== Shortcomings ==
* Drawbacks regarding cultural diplomacy
One of the prominent obstacles is that "cultural diplomacy is largely dominated by cultural contents, which the government tends to rely on the private sector to produce".&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cho|first1=YunYoung|title=Public Diplomacy and South Korea's Strategies|journal=The Korean Journal of International Studies|volume=10|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The limited source of investment is problematic in that the private industry is relatively volatile to changes in circumstances such as the economic situation in the market or changes in the corporation's own situations.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Furthermore, the [[Korean Wave]] "may push South Korea into a narrow trap of cultural diplomacy" blocking the enhancement of other public diplomatic sectors.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kim|first1=Taehwan|title=Paradigm Shift in Diplomacy: A Conceptual Model for Korea's "New Public Diplomacy"|journal=Korea Observer|date=2012|volume=43|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; This problem is rooted in the fact that the public sector is reluctant to initiate a policy to establish a concrete plan on public diplomacy but rather rely on the already existing contents in the private market, and thus, "it is hard to expect that ideas based on its current strategy could develop into actual policies".&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

* South Korean government's lack of concrete strategy for public diplomacy
To investigate deeper in the public sector's lack of leadership considering public diplomacy, it can be found that South Korea's government lacks a consistent conception or concrete strategy for public diplomacy that will enable South Korea to reinforce its stance in soft power.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The current situation is that there is an absence of systematic co-operation among the major organizations relevant to public diplomacy or even the organizations itself to deal with public diplomacy effectively which makes the decision making process and the policy implementation to be inefficient.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The situation even exacerbates when there exists ministerial jurisdictional rivalry over public diplomacy because several ministries try to expand their rights over popular sectors such as the Korean Wave and this leads to the overlapping jurisdiction over the same sector.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; The seriousness of this situation can be explained by Taehwan Kim's analysis: "There are one presidential council, three ministries and at least twenty-four public organizations pursuing public diplomacy and wanting to lead the policies and activities of public diplomacy".&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; 
	The government is in an advantageous position to strengthen its cultural influence in varying regions in that the influence is not limited to certain economic restraints that the private sector faces and that the influence can be in different shapes depending on the cultural or other features of a certain nation. For example, the private sector faces limits when they aim to impress the Western society and the African society at the same time with their limited business items. However, the government can initiate a public diplomatic plan which will respectively handle different regions in the world.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; When the government is only concentrated in attempting to gain benefits from the cultural diplomacy founded by the private sector rather than creating a plan on their own, the systematic growth of public diplomacy becomes a more difficult task.

* Lack of systematic co-operation between the government and the civil society
The lack of systematic co-operation between the government and the public hinders the firm founding of public diplomacy and the application in the society as a whole. Because of this, the most important aspect in public diplomacy which is a communication channel between the government and the public to facilitate public diplomacy with mutual assistance is lacking.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; [[Joseph Nye]] categorizes the three dimensions of public diplomacy that, he claims, "help a nation accomplish its goals through diplomatic activities: daily communication; strategic communication; and the sustainable relationship among individuals through academic activities, exchanges, training, seminars and diverse media channels".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nye|first1=Joseph|title=Soft Powers: Means to Success in World Politics|date=2004|publisher=New York: PublicAffairs}}&lt;/ref&gt; These activities that the public needs to work on to create a content that will boost the public diplomacy is not available unless the government takes the initiative to form a systematic ground to lay the cornerstone for discussion and expand the participation in realms of public diplomacy which are not being dealt with to the fullest extent until now.

'''Radiofax''' was an independent [[shortwave]] radio station that broadcast from [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] between 1988 and 1992. It carried talk programmes on science, technology and media news, as well as contemporary popular music. "Britain's Number Two Shortwave Station," (the [[BBC World Service]] being number one) was forced to broadcast from various locations in Ireland because all of their requests for a licence from the British government had been refused. Founder and sponsor Trevor Brook subsequently took the licence battle to the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] in [[London]] and the [[European Court of Human Rights]] in [[Strasbourg]]. 

The station operated on various mediumwave and [[shortwave]] frequencies including 1611, 3910, 6205, 6225 and 12255&amp;nbsp;kHz.

The '''Roman Catholic Diocese of Djibouti''' ({{lang-la|Gibuten(sis)}}) is the Latin sole [[diocese]] in the country of [[Djibouti]] in the [[Horn of Africa]].

It is exempt, i.e. directly subject to the [[Holy See]] and its missionary [[Roman Congregation for the Evangelization of Peoples]].

It has its [[Cathedral]] episcopal see, the [[Our Lady of the Good Shepherd Cathedral, Djibouti]] (French Marian Cathédrale de Notre-Dame du Bon-Pasteur; dedicated to the [[Our Lady of the Good Sheperd]]), in the national capital [[Djibouti City]].

== Statistics ==
As per 2014, it pastorally served 5,000 Catholics (0.6% of 850,000 total) on 23,200 km² in 5 parishes and a mission with 4 diocesan priests and 29 lay religious (1 brother, 28 sisters).

'''Sky+ HD''' is the brand name of the [[High-definition television|HDTV]] service launched by [[Sky plc]] on 22 May 2006 in the United Kingdom and Ireland to enable high definition channels on [[Sky (UK and Ireland)|Sky]] to be viewed. For the first 2&amp;nbsp;years after launch, the service was branded '''Sky HD'''. The service requires the user to have a Sky+ HD [[Digibox]] and an [[HD ready]] TV. A subscription to the original HD pack carries an extra fee of £10.25 (€15.00 in Ireland) a month in addition to the standard Sky subscription, allowing customers to view HD channels corresponding to the channel packs subscribed to. Additional Pay-Per-View events on Sky Box Office HD are not available to customers unless they subscribe to the Sky HD pack.

As of June 2014, subscription numbers for Sky+HD stood at over 5.2&amp;nbsp;million, an increase from 4.8&amp;nbsp;million the year before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.trustnet.com/Investments/Article.aspx?id=201407250700133172N |title=BSkyB Results for the twelve months ended 30 June 2014 |publisher=BSkyB |date=25 July 2014 |accessdate=30 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Launched in May 2006, Sky HD brought high-definition television to the consumer market, initially consisting of nine HD channels. Prices on launch were announced as £299 for a HD set-top box, with an additional £10 a month HD subscription on top of any existing packages.&lt;ref name="guardian_skyhd_launch"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2006/mar/24/bskyb.broadcasting |title=Sky to launch HDTV in May |work=The Guardian |date=24 March 2006 |accessdate=1 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Customers who [[pre-order]]ed by paying a [[deposit account|deposit]] before 6 April 2006 were the first to receive the service, with installations starting on 21 May 2006 following over 40,000 advance orders of the service; the number of Sky+HD pre-orders surpassed the total sales in the first year of Sky+.&lt;ref name="preorders_40k"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://dtg.org.uk/news/news.html?id=1646 |title=Sky HD advance orders hit 40,000 |work=DTG |date=5 May 2006 |accessdate=1 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The HD package launched with a one-year minimum subscription duration.

The launch line-up consisted of [[Sky1|Sky1 HD]], [[Sky Arts|Sky Arts HD]], [[Sky Movies|Sky Movies 9 HD]], [[Sky Movies|Sky Movies 10 HD]], [[Sky Sports|Sky Sports HD]], [[Discovery HD]], [[National Geographic Channel HD]], [[Sky Box Office|Sky Box Office HD 1]] and [[Sky Box Office|Sky Box Office HD 2]] (now Sky Movies Box Office).

In January 2010, customers started being offered the Sky+ HD box as standard, with the HD package being optional at the same subscription price. The Sky+ box was subsequently withdrawn, meaning the Sky+ HD became part of a standard installation. As of late 2013, the £10.25/month HD pack stopped being offered to new customers, instead suggesting customers subscribe to the Family package, then carrying a £5/month premium over the cost of the regular Variety package.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sky.com/products/ways-to-watch/sky-plus-hd/|title=Sky+HD – Movies, Sport and Entertainment in Stunning HD|work=sky.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Access to HD versions of Sky Sports and Sky Movies requires a separate HD pack subscription, priced at £5.25 per month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sky.com/shop/tv/high-definition/|title=HD TV|work=sky.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sky+]] recording facilities are included as part of a standard Sky TV subscription package, yet entails a fee of £10.25/month if a customer does not subscribe to any Sky TV package. Viewers who do not take a subscription Sky TV package or the Sky+ service will still receive all free SD and HD channels, but cannot use the recording facilities. Uptakers of the subscription-free [[Freesat from Sky]] service are provided with a recorder-less box branded 'SkyHD' rather than Sky+ HD, given SkyHD boxes provided by Freesat from Sky do not contain hardware for recording.

As of November 2016, Sky offered over 50 HD channels, more than any competitor.&lt;ref name="howmanyhdchannels"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.choose.co.uk/guide/who-offers-the-best-hd-tv-package.html |title=Where's best for HD TV? |work=Choose |date=15 November 2016 |accessdate=25 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous [[Free-to-air|FTA]] HD channels are available which do not require a subscription, only an HD capable digibox such as the Sky+ HD box, including [[BBC One|BBC One HD]], [[BBC Two|BBC Two HD]] and [[Channel 4|Channel 4 HD]].

==On Demand==
{{Main|On Demand (Sky)}}
On 27 March 2007, Sky launched its ''Sky Anytime on TV'' Push-[[Video on Demand]] service for owners of Sky+ HD set top boxes. Programmes in high definition and standard definition are recorded overnight to a reserved 140GB of disk space, to give the effect of video on demand.

This has also been used to bring viewers high-definition programmes from channels that at the time didn't broadcast in HD. These have included [[Sky News]] (''Technofile'', ''Diana: The Last Word''), [[Disney Channel (UK and Ireland)|Disney Channel]] (''[[High School Musical 2]]'') and [[Nickelodeon (UK and Ireland)|Nickelodeon]] (''[[iCarly]]'').

==Set top boxes==
[[File:Sky hd 001.jpg|thumb|300px|An original Sky+ HD Digibox (V.1) backpanel]]
The first generation of Sky+ HD Digibox were produced by [[Technicolor SA|Thomson]], with Sky subsequently adding Samsung, Pace and Amstrad as manufacturers afterwards. In 2009, a manufacturing fault led to a batch of up to 90,000 units manufactured by Pace requiring replacement; Sky offered customers 3 months free HD pack subscription for the inconvenience.&lt;ref name="Pace recall"&gt;
{{cite news

|title=Fault hits 90,000 Sky+ HD boxes
|publisher=Digital Spy
|date=14 February 2009
|accessdate=1 July 2017
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For connectivity with [[HD ready]] televisions, the box outputs via a [[HDMI]] connector (adapters to [[Digital Visual Interface]] are available). The box is [[High-bandwidth Digital Content Protection]] (HDCP) compliant. Sky boxes manufactured prior to January 2008 also had analogue component connections ([[YPbPr]]), but as the HDCP copy protection cannot be applied to this type of output it is no longer included. Traditional standard-definition (SD) connections are available via [[SCART]] and [[S-Video]]. All programming is currently output from both HDMI and SD connections, although individual broadcasters have the option to require HDCP (and therefore HDMI) in the future.

All HD channels are broadcast in [[1080i]] format (though the box can be set to scale this to [[720p]] if the user wishes), using the [[H.264/MPEG-4 AVC]] compression standard, from [[Astra 2A]], [[Astra 2E]], [[Astra 2F]] and [[Eutelsat 28A]] satellites at [[Astra 28.2°E|28.2°E]] and 28.5°E in a new [[Digital Video Broadcasting|DVB]] transmission standard, [[DVB-S2]]. [[BBC HD]] was initially broadcast using [[DVB-S]] but switched to DVB-S2 on 6 June 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pryde |first=Alix |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/bbcinternet/2011/06/changes_to_bbc_hd_channels_on.html |title=Changes to BBC HD channels on satellite on 6th June |publisher=BBC |date=2 June 2011 |accessdate=26 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Version 5 EPG ([[electronic program guide]]) is almost identical to the one found on Sky+, with the exception being that by pressing ''TV Guide'' and then number 2 on the [[remote control]], listings for only the HD channels are shown. An update was sent to the HD boxes early on 20 March 2007, which also included code for Sky Anytime (now OnDemand).
Version 8 of the Sky Guide, dubbed the Sky+ HD guide, included a Mini TV, improved search functions and a refreshed interface. 

[[File:Sky DRX895w.jpg|thumb|right|Sky+ HD DRX895W Set Top Box, with remote and power cable]]
On 1 October 2010, Sky began the process of downloading [[open-source software]] to Sky+ HD receivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.broadbandtvnews.com/2010/10/01/sky-adopts-open-source-set-top-software/|title=Sky adopts open source set-top software|publisher=Broadband TV News|date=1 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the majority of software upgrades made by Sky, the open source licences require Sky to notify customers that the download has taken place. Subscribers are notified with an on-screen message that refers them to a dedicated section of the Sky website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.sky.com/opensourcesoftware/SkyHD/|title=opensourcesoftware|publisher=British Sky Broadcasting|accessdate=2 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The website also includes a download of the open source components including the building environment. Sky says that it has found a number of Open Source Software developments that provide capabilities that benefit the software used in the Sky+ HD box.

Sky also manufactured a standard Sky HD box without a hard drive, aimed primarily at customers subscribing to Sky Multiroom, as a cheaper alternative to receive HD channels if record and playback were not required.

==Developments==
===Increase in HD channels===
In over three years since launch, the number of HD channels available has increased significantly, thus Sky+ HD is the world's largest HD offering outside North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sky brought an update to its Sky+ app, this features a similar looking design to the Sky+HD box bringing the services more in line with one another.

On 30 July 2009, Sky confirmed the launch of a "pull" video-on-demand (VOD) service for 2010, adding to the current Sky Anytime "push" VOD service.&lt;ref name="Sky 3D" /&gt; The service, delivered by broadband internet, will utilise the Ethernet port of existing Sky+ HD boxes. Sky's Anytime+ will only be available to Sky broadband at launch but sky say it will be on all service providers in the near future. Although the service may be similar to [[DirecTV]]'s VOD offering that also uses an operating system built by [[NDS Group]]. NDS Group was formally a [[Permira]]/[[News Corporation]] company, but currently part of [[Cisco]]. Sky have started the phased roll-out of the new guide software for this service.

On 29 April 2010, BSkyB revealed that their new video-on-demand service would be named '''[[Sky Anytime+]]'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://paidcontent.co.uk/article/419-sky-christens-true-vod-service-sky-anytime-as-arpu-rockets/|title=Sky Christens True VOD Service "Sky Anytime+" As ARPU Rockets|publisher=paidContent:UK|date=29 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; "It will be a broad offering at launch with a large range of content across the range of content that we show," CEO Jeremy Darroch said. "[It will feature] progressive download using the broadband return pathway and the hard disc in a combined way. All of the boxes are VOD-ready, so we'll be able to roll it out to all of the box population." Sky Anytime+ began a staggered roll out from 26 October 2010. In March 2011 it was confirmed by Sky that the Thomson Sky HD boxes would not be suitable for the new Anytime+ service. Customers with Thomson boxes are being offered New boxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://corporate.sky.com/media/press_releases/2010/sky_introduces_anytimeplus.htm|title=Sky Introduces Sky Anytime+|publisher=British Sky Broadcasting|date=22 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 February 2011, BSkyB introduced a new EPG for Sky HD subscribers which switched the standard definition channels with the high definition simulcast. For example, Sky News HD, which was on channel 517, switched to channel 501. The same happened for other non-regional HD channels, including Syfy, Comedy Central, Sky Sports, E4 and Sky1.

===3D===
Following demonstrations in December 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
  | title = Interview: How Sky 3D is drawing closer

  | accessdate = 27 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sky announced on 30 July 2009 its intention to launch a [[Digital 3D|3D]] channel during 2010, featuring a broad selection of 3D programming, which is expected to include movies, entertainment and sport.&lt;ref name="Sky 3D"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hexus.net/ce/items/entertainment/19532-sky-launch-3d-tv-2010-following-record-skyhd-growth/?set_mobile_full_site_cookie=1|title=Sky to launch 3D TV in 2010 following record Sky+HD growth|publisher=British Sky Broadcasting|work=Hexus|date=30 July 2009|accessdate=1 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Existing Sky+ HD receivers will automatically be compatible with the new 3D service, although customers will require a new 3D compatible HDTV set to view in 3D. A 3D trailer has been in circulation in UK cinemas for the new service.
It is thought that it will use the new [[Multiview Video Coding|MVC]] video codec. The first programme that was broadcast by Sky in 3D was the [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] vs [[Manchester United]] football match on Sunday 31 January 2010. The 3D match was available in nine hand-picked pubs in England and in Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.skysports.com/football/news/11979/5889013/sky-makes-3d-history |work=Sky Sports |title=Sky makes 3D history |date=28 January 2010 |accessdate=1 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Monday 29 March 2010, [[Sky 3D]] appeared on the EPG at number 217, showing "Programs Start on Saturday". Sky launched its 3D services on 3 April with the Manchester United vs [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]] football match being broadcast in over a thousand pubs across England in 3D.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thedrum.com/news/2010/04/03/13335-sky-television-claim-first-3d-broadcast-as-a-success|title=Sky Television claim first 3D broadcast as a success|publisher=The Drum|date=3 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of October 2014 Sky 3D is on channel 170.
From 9 June 2015 customers wanting to access Sky's 3D content will only be able to do so via its on-demand channels. To this end, there will be a new 3D segment in the Sky Box Sets, Movies, Store and TV Guide sections.
