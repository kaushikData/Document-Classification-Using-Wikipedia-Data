[[File:Triangle.tif|thumb|Henderson's 3S Understanding]]

'''3S Understanding''' is a [[curriculum]] structure that was created by [[James G. Henderson]]. 3S Understanding is a mixture of three components that can be diagrammed as a triangle. The three Ss are Subject Matter, Self-learning, and Social Learning.

Henderson and Gornik’s ''Reflective Teaching: Professional Artistry Through Inquiry'' examines 3S understanding and teaching for democratic living. It goes in depth about subject learning, self-learning, and social learning. Henderson writes the book with the ideas and also presents several real life examples. It goes through teacher reflection and how teachers should be constantly refining their practice.

The manual on 3S Understanding and how to apply it to a curriculum is ''Transformative Curriculum Leadership'' by Henderson. It will be one of the most important documents in the study. Henderson outlines what 3S Understanding is, what it is based on, and how to implement it. The author discusses how to design and plan lessons, how to teach the lessons, evaluation of the lessons, and organization. Henderson even goes on to discuss how the community and school can get involved and help expand and support this form of curriculum.

== Understanding by Design ==
''Understanding by Design'' by Wiggins and McTighe takes on the heavy task of getting students to not merely gain factual knowledge but to understand what they are learning. The authors talk about using [[backward design]] to focus on the goals and then determine what the students need to do to show they have achieved the goals. Wiggins and McTighe describe the goal of backward design as, "lessons, unite, and courses should be logically inferred from the results sought, not derived from the methods, books, and activities with which we are most comfortable".&lt;ref name="wiggmc"&gt;Wiggins, G., &amp; McTighe, J. (2005). Understanding by design (2nd Ed.). Alexandria, VA: Association for Supervision and Curriculum Development.&lt;/ref&gt; They also delve into the idea of being able to use information and apply it to different situations. Helping the students to understand how they are learning and their [[Metacognition|metacognitive]] ability is integral in 3S understanding. The self aspect of 3S understanding desires for the student to see themselves as a lifelong learner. Wiggins and McTighe cover the subject matter and social aspects of 3S understanding.

== 21st Century Skills ==
The [[21st Century Skills]] and 21st Century Themes are becoming more prevalent in education as time goes on. The connection 21st Century skills have with 3S understanding is that sense of being a self-learner. Students need to see themselves as constantly learning through life as they develop skills in a fast changing world. The authors report:
Achieving education’s goals in our time is shaped by the increasingly powerful [[Technology|technologies]] we have for communicating, [[Collaboration|collaborating]], and learning. And learning assumes a central role throughout life.&lt;ref name="trilling"&gt;Trilling, B., &amp; Fadel, C. (2009). 21st Century skills: Learning for life in our times. San Francisco, CA: Jossey-Bass.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Subject matter ==

The [[Course (education)|subject]] is the base curriculum and standards that are used by the school, state, and nation. They are inherent in every curriculum but James Henderson goes further in describing what he sees as subject. He says, “Teaching for [[Democracy|democratic]] living requires the use of thinking-centered, performance-based activities".&lt;ref name="professional9"&gt;Henderson, J.G. (2001). Reflective teaching: Professional artistry through inquiry (3rd Ed.). Upper Saddle River, NJ: Merrill Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; Teaching subject matter is important but it needs to focus on student thinking and [[Educational assessment|assessment]]. Henderson gives many forms of performance-based learning: [[Collaborative learning]], [[Learning by teaching#Peer Learning and Teaching in Higher Education|peer teaching]], [[project-based learning]], understanding performances, infusion of [[Critical thinking|critical]] and [[Creativity|creative]] thinking, and authentic problems that have real-world significance.&lt;ref name="professional9" /&gt; Henderson also discusses the importance of [[Constructivism (learning theory)|constructivist learning]] and how drawing from past experiences and applying it to the present is important. The students will gain more meaning from the material if it has some meaning to them.

== Self-learning ==

The second S is for Self-Learning and it represents the students’ view of themselves as lifelong learners. It is important for students to see themselves as constantly learning from others and from themselves. Everything that a student experiences, every person that they talk to, and everything they do impacts their beliefs and knowledge. If a teacher can help a student to realize that then they can help the student to grow to be active participants in a democratic society. Henderson also talks about [[Early childhood#Social-emotional growth and development|social-emotional growth]] and how it can be accomplished by fostering, “caring and supportive learning environments that invite active student participation in classroom and school management activities”.&lt;ref name="professional9" /&gt; It is important for students to make good choices and to know how to express [[emotion]].

== Social learning ==

The third S stands for Social Learning which gives the student understanding of their [[society]]. It helps them think about “[[Equity (economics)|equity]], [[Multiculturalism|diversity]], and [[Civic virtue|civility]] issues”.&lt;ref name="professional9" /&gt; Equity has to do with the [[:wikt:equality|equality]] of people and the ideas of fair and just. Henderson suggests that [[stereotype]]s are squashed at an early age and that grading should encourage all students. Diversity should celebrate human differences and diversity should be seen as something good. Civility focuses on the right to have different opinions and to listen to everyone’s opinion even if it is different.&lt;ref name="professional9" /&gt;

== Paradigms ==

3S Understanding is built upon the curriculum wisdom [[paradigm]] which is an expansion of the constructivist best practice paradigm.&lt;ref name="gornik"&gt;Henderson, J. G. &amp; Gornik, R. (2007). Transformative curriculum leadership. (3rd Ed.).Upper Saddle River, NJ: Merrill Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; The paradigm that Henderson is looking to get away from is the standardized management paradigm. He compares the two by saying standardized management’s problem solving cycle is, “[[Goal setting|goal-setting]], [[Decision making|decision-making]], and reflecting activities aligned to high-stakes standardized tests” while curriculum wisdom’s is “goal-setting, decision-making, and reflecting activities that facilitate student’s subject matter meaning making in a context of active democratic living”.&lt;ref name="gornik" /&gt; The difference is the last part of each explanation. One focuses on the high-stakes standardized tests while the other focuses on taking what the student is learning and applying it to themselves and the society they live in.

Henderson and Kessen’s Curriculum Wisdom book is about one of the three educational paradigms that Henderson says are inherent in one another; they are the standardized management paradigm, the constructivist best practice paradigm, and the curriculum wisdom paradigm. Curriculum wisdom has to do with expanding upon the subject matter the student is learning. The curriculum wisdom paradigm is a “concise way to convey the subtle and complex challenges of approaching curriculum work as envisioning and enacting a good educational journey”.&lt;ref name="kesson"&gt;Henderson, J. G. &amp; Kesson, K. R. (2004). Curriculum Wisdom. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Merrill Prentice Hall.&lt;/ref&gt; It is putting the subject matter in context with how it is meaningful to their lives. In essence the argument is that people need to know the subject matter, how to use it in their lives, and how to be a good member of society.

== Transformative standards ==

The paradigms are revisited when Henderson talks about [[Learning standards|standards]]. Standards are an important topic in education and seeing the Transformative Standards he puts forth shows them in a new light. Received standards stress the importance of “standardized factual knowledge and skills, knowledge and skills that are testable with a large population, and criteria based on a predetermined metric based on [[counting]]”.&lt;ref name="gornik" /&gt; These standards are not based on the students or what they have learned. Henderson’s Transformative Standards are based on student understanding and wisdom. Taking what the student knows of the subject and allowing them to show their understanding through demonstration and performances.&lt;ref name="gornik" /&gt;

== Six facets of understanding ==

Important in creating a curriculum with 3S understanding is to include Henderson’s Six Facets of Understanding. Wisdom is having knowledge and knowing how to apply it. Henderson gives ways to assess if a student understands and shows wisdom on a topic. He says a student who really understands, “can explain, can interpret, can apply, sees in perspective, demonstrates [[empathy]], and reveals [[Self-knowledge (psychology)|self-knowledge]]”.&lt;ref name="gornik" /&gt; Many of these ways to see if a student understands are not normally used in the classroom. The reason is because 3S understanding requires more of the student while at the same time gives them more. It may seem like more work for the student but actually the student is connecting the work to themselves and their surroundings. It will stimulate students more and seeing themselves as lifelong learners will motivate them to acquire knowledge and wisdom.

==Example: Integrated Curriculum==
[[Integrative learning|Integrated curricula]] like teaching for 3S understanding are becoming more popular all around the world. The article "Japan's National Curriculum Reforms: Focus on Integrated Curriculum" was an excellent source of information on curriculum infusion. It was geared toward helping to implement the integration into school systems. Japan wanted their children to grow up to be well-balanced adults. This article provided excellent insight into why the basic standards are not enough anymore. Arani says:
On this basis, the optional courses increase; the teacher’s role changes; and the school should teach the students how to think, decide, and organize their thoughts, as well as how to gain the skills for learning, research, and collection and analysis of data. The school should also teach the students how to learn while being in contact with their surroundings, and how to relate all the learning with the society, and the daily life.&lt;ref name="arani"&gt;Arani, M. (2008). Japan's National Curriculum Reforms: Focus on Integrated Curriculum Approach. Retrieved from http://www.eric.ed.gov/PDFS/ED505389.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Children need to learn to think more independently. They need to be able to understand what is happening around them in their environment. The rich culture all around them needs to be coupled with the problems and issues around them as well. [[Japan]] has realized and acted on the realization that basic knowledge base curriculum does not work anymore. The world is a changing place and teachers need to integrate the world into their students’ educations. It relates to the self and social learning aspects of 3S understanding that help set it apart. This is an excellent example of the democratic self and social understanding discussed by Henderson.

==Example: The Curriculum Infusion of Real Life Issues==
The Curriculum Infusion of Real Life Issues Model is about taking issues that students face in their everyday lives and addressing them. There are many issues that students can face as they grow into adults. Ignoring them in the classroom is not the right way to go about producing responsible adults. The authors include issues such as [[bullying]], drugs and alcohol, smoking, violence, and [[sexually transmitted disease]]s. It would be productive if teachers can acknowledge and support students when they face problems like these. Students and teachers can develop more of an interpersonal bond and even help their communities grow. The authors describe the curriculum infusion, “It makes classes more relevant to students by addressing their real world concerns and connects teachers more closely to the students and communities where they work."&lt;ref name="glick"&gt;Glick, R., Joleaud, B., &amp; Messerer, J. (2006). Curriculum infusion of real life issues. Retrieved from http://www.neiu.edu/~k12pac/5HandbookRevision06%5B1%5D.11_22.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528050533/http://www.neiu.edu/~k12pac/5HandbookRevision06%5B1%5D.11_22.pdf |date=2010-05-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Included in the authors' research are topics such as diversity, environment, and prevention. This is another example of self and social understanding being used in conjunction with subject matter. It shows that there is more to students’ lives than simply subject matter.

==Example: "More Like Real Life"==
The article “More Like Real Life: Motivational Methods of Teaching in [[High school|Upper Secondary School]]” is helpful in understanding how teachers and students interact. It is a [[Sweden|Swedish]] article but is important to understand the relationship between teacher and student for real life inclusion methods. The authors write, “Both the school and the working force of teachers need a new conception of what knowledge is Carlgren would like to see a new knowledge movement based on a way of viewing knowledge that ‘instead of knowledge being seen as a substance, is seen as a relationship between humanity and the world.’” &lt;ref name="jansson"&gt;Ivarsson-Jansson, E., Cooper, K., Augusen, H., &amp; Frykland, M. (2009). More like real life: motivational methods of teaching in upper secondary school. Retrieved from http://www.eric.ed.gov/PDFS/ED511180.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; This shows how important it is for students to see that they are a part of the world. They need to take what they know and connect it to their surroundings. People are a part of something bigger than themselves and need to understand the relationship they have with the world. The article also discusses a study done at a high school where everyone was from a different place. The high school recruited students from everywhere.  It was the perfect place to have a study on school and its effect on a student’s culture. The study found that students created a culture and working community of their own. They were able to understand each other and work together in their school activities. After school activities played an important role in the study. It gave the student more of a bond between each other and allowed the teachers to get involved in their lives. It was perfect to help understand how integrating real life issues could help students, parents, the community, and teachers in a school system. This article explores how schools have an effect on students and how students and teachers have an effect on each other. [[Social studies]] is very involved with social and self-understanding and the 3S Curriculum model would fit easily and with great results.

The '''Académie des Beaux-Arts''' (ABA) is a [[school]] in [[Kinshasa]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. The school is devoted to teaching the [[art]]s, and was founded in 1943 as the ''École Saint-Luc à Gombe Matadi'' by Belgian catholic missionary [[Marc Wallenda]]. In 1949 the school moved to present-day Kinshasa and in 1957 it was renamed as the '''Académie des Beaux-Arts'''. During the education reforms of 1981 the school was integrated into the national technical university system.

The school offers programs in [[metalworking]], [[interior decorating]], [[visual communications]], [[sculpture]], [[painting]], et cetera.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3011">{{inline|date=May 2018}}'''Adult education''' ({{lang-de|Erwachsenenbildung}}) in [[Nazi Germany]] was institutional continuing education for persons who had completed their schooling.  After the synchronization of university extension programs (Volkshochschulen) and their municipal or private sponsors, the [[German Labor Front]] (DAF) made its influence felt in two ways.  Within its National Socialist [[Strength Through Joy]] organization, it founded the [[German Public Instruction Agency]] (Deutsche Volksbildungswerk; DVW) in 1935.  Moreover, after 1933 it used the Office for Vocational Education and Business Management to influence commercial education.  The [[German Institute for National Socialist Technical Vocational Training]] (Dinta) gave rise to the German Vocational Education Agency (Deutsches Berufserziehungswerk), which organized "practice groups" (''Übungsgemeinschaften'') that by 1938 had 2 million participants; its workplace programs involved another 1.3 million.  These operations should be distinguished from the "community schooling" (''Gemeinschaftsschulung'') of employers, foremen, and workers through courses in the German Labor Front's Reich schools.

Above all, adult education had functions not provided by the mass organizations of National Socialism, with their "ideological orientation and selection" and their military training.  The adult education offerings had more to do with the economic predicament and the demand for continuing education and ideological orientation than with political schooling.  During the war, new areas of activity arose through the combining of work with vocational or general-educational correspondence courses, as well as through continuing education for persons with war-related disabilities.  In 1943, the DVW established a night school (''Abendoberschule'') in [[Munich]].  It supported social and cultural courses given by so-called guardians of public instruction (''Volksbildungswarte'') in the workplaces.

The 300 offices for public instruction also attempted to mobilize the rural population for culture.  Their program of instruction was largely based on a model curriculum created in 1939 by Reich and ''[[Gau (country subdivision)|Gau]]'' work groups for adult education.  Instead of consolidation of adult education taking place through Reich legislation, a goal aimed at in 1933, the DVW gained dominance through the financial resources made available from DAF dues; in 1943 it was upgraded to a leadership office (Führungsamt) in the DAF.  Adult education should not be underestimated as an integrating element, even if its educational offerings primarily served the collective increase of power.

The '''Bachelor of Theology''' degree ('''BTh''', '''ThB''', or '''BTheol''') is a three- to five-year [[undergraduate degree]] in [[Theology|theological]] disciplines.&lt;ref&gt;[https://study.com/articles/Bachelors_Degree_in_Theology_Program_Overview.html Bachelor's Degree in Theology: Program Overview], Study.com&lt;/ref&gt;  Candidates for this degree typically must complete course work in [[Greek language|Greek]] or [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], as well as [[systematic theology]], [[biblical theology]], ethics, [[homiletics]], [[hermeneutics]] and [[Christian ministry]].  It does not require a [[thesis]] but is often a year longer than a [[Bachelor of Religious Education]] or [[Bachelor of Arts]].  In some denominations, notably the [[Church of England]], it is considered sufficient for formal [[ordination]].

In some schools, the BTh is a three-year degree for mature students pursuing ordination, who do not hold a degree and for whom the requirement of a [[Master of Divinity]] has been waived.

'''Barbara Goette''' (26 July 1908 – 23 October 1997) was an academic who lived in Germany and then Australia. She was the private secretary of [[Ludwig Roselius]]&lt;ref name="r1" /&gt; from 1935 to 1943 who created the [[Böttcherstraße]], [[Café HAG]] and financed [[Focke-Wulf]].

== Life and career ==

Barbara matriculated in Kassel in 1928 and began studying mathematics, physics and philosophy at Freiburg University and then Kiel where she took her state examinations in 1934/35. She met Dr [[Ludwig Roselius]] through the marriage of her brother to his youngest daughter and he suggested she work for the concern. Barbara became his companion, carer, confidante and collaborator.&lt;ref&gt;Pfliegensdörfer, D. Ludwig Roselius ... wie ihn keiner kennt. Werkstattberichte des Forschungsschwerpunkts Arbeit und Bildung Universität Bremen; 5, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18/9/1936 during a meeting in Berlin, the RLM recommended reconstruction of Focke-Wulf with 50% going to the Reich (state) and 50% to a large electronics concern.&lt;ref&gt;OMGUS document declassified per Executive Order 12958, Section 3.5 NND Project Number: NND 775058 By: NND Date: 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

A short time later the Roselius concern became majority shareholder with 46% and Lorenz (ITT) secured 27.8%. The aircraft company was reconstituted as [[Focke-Wulf]] Flugzeugbau GmbH. Barbara was instrumental in assisting with this and the [[Böttcherstrasse]] was reclassified as 'degenerate art'.&lt;ref&gt;Volker Bergmann, Willi Elmers, Manfred Fittgau, Michael Jung, Dieter Pfliegensdörfer, Michael Wolf unter Mitarbeit von Wolfgang Günther. Wellblech und Windkanal: Steintor, 1989 {{ISBN|3-926028-51-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Dr Roselius died in May 1943 she lectured in English at the Humboldt Hochschule in Berlin until the premises were demolished during a bombing raid. In 1944 she started studying for her Ph.D. in philosophy at Kiel where she met Dr J.P. Leidig and they married in February 1945. Shortly after the war she acted as an interpreter for the military police in [[Gunzenhausen]], [[Bavaria]].&lt;ref&gt;Radio Bremen Online, 2011. Kaffee, Kunst, Kommerz - Das Leben des Ludwig Roselius. Accessed 25 May 2012. Pinguin Film Berlin, 13 January 2011. &lt;www.radiobremen.de/vide021856-popup.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950 the family settled in Adelaide, Australia. Dr Leidig died in 1957 and Barbara was left with two sons. She never remarried and taught mathematics at Woodlands for 23 years. One year she had 4 out of the top 10 students in South Australia in her class and she received a congratulatory phone call from the Adelaide University Mathematics Department. She also worked as mathematics teacher until she was 81 at the Muirden College matriculation centre.&lt;ref&gt;The West Australian News: "Returning to Adelaide." (Perth, WA: 1879-1954), viewed 30 Sept. 2012. http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article 47842318&lt;/ref&gt;

A comprehensive posthumous interview by the Australian Our Time Channel 44 program (episode 188) on the life of Barbara Goette went Australia wide in 2015 and is available for viewing as referenced below.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fv82pXnNmrM&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=11m43s&lt;/ref&gt;

== Writings and Publications ==

While still employed by the Roselius concern, Barbara wrote many articles on Dr Roselius including, '[[Ludwig Roselius]] creates the [[Böttcherstraße]]' and 'Politics and Propaganda'. These were to be published by the Angelsachsen-Verlag in better times to come. An unpublished essay 'Ludwig the Philosopher' appears in the book that her son Ludwig wrote with Kevin Lower as researcher and Karen Collins as main editor. This book is a biography dealing mainly with Barbara's life in Germany during the Third Reich.&lt;ref&gt;Leidig, Ludwig. Bombshell. sbpra, 2013,{{ISBN|978-1-62516-346-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1944 Barbara risked her life by writing exactly the things that had infuriated Hitler in 1936 when he had attacked Dr Roselius and the Böttcherstrasse at the September Nuremberg Party Rally. This ten page essay was approved in September 1944 and was finally published by the Bremen Yearbook in 1951 and is included in the reference section. The controversial aspects were
* The Paula Becker-Modersohn museum which was the first museum in the world dedicated to a female artist and labelled 'degenerate art' by the Nazis.
* The 'Tree of Life' by [[Bernhard Hoetger]] depicting a Nordic sacrifice.
* Hoetger's architecture again 'degenerate'.
It was late 1935 when the SS newspaper 'Das Schwarze Korps' launched a vitriolic attack on Ludwig Roselius' Böttcherstrasse.&lt;ref&gt;Das Schwarze Korps; 24/10/1935; pages 11,34&lt;/ref&gt;

== Movie ==

In a film version, based on the biographical book Bombshell ({{ISBN|9781625163462}}), Barbara Götte and her boss [[Ludwig Roselius]] hatch out a plot to blow up Hitler's [[Focke-Wulf Fw 200]] while he was flying back to Germany from Smolensk in early 1943. The bomb fails to ignite and the Gestapo suspect that Roselius is involved. On the evening of 15/5/1943 in the [[Hotel Kaiserhof (Berlin)]] there is a violent confrontation between Hitler and Roselius - Barbara later returns from a ball to find Roselius dead.&lt;ref&gt;Ludwig Leidig LinkedIn - screenplay based on the book Bombshell {{ISBN|9781625163462}} - registered with WGA in LA; registration no. 1851846; effective date 7/23/2016; registrant Ludwig Leidig&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4251">'''Blue Velvet''' is an [[online]] [[digital history]] project about the city of [[New Orleans]] both before and after [[Hurricane Katrina]].
The project was published in the fifth issue of ''[[Vectors Journal of Culture and Technology in a Dynamic Vernacular]]'', entitled "Difference."  The full title of the project is "Blue Velvet: Redressing New Orleans in Katrina's Wake."

== Creation and design ==
Blue Velvet was created through the collaboration of [[David Theo Goldberg]], Director of the University of California Humanities Research Institute ([[UCHRI]]), and a graduate research assistant, Stefka Hristova.  These two were assisted in the implementation of the site by the digital artist and designer [[Erik Loyer]], currently creative director of the journal.

Blue Velvet was conceived as a multimedia presentation of a journal article which Goldberg had previously published, "Deva-stating Disasters: Race in the Shadow(s) of New Orleans"&lt;ref&gt;Goldberg, David Theo “Deva-stating Disasters: Race in the Shadow(s) of New Orleans,” Du Bois Review 3:1 (2006).
&lt;/ref&gt; and which had been noticed by Tara McPherson, one of the founding editors of Vectors.  From the first meeting, the group became aware that "the writing had to be envisaged in a more creative and experimental form,"&lt;ref&gt;Interview with Goldberg, http://erikloyer.com/index.php/blog/david_theo_goldberg_discusses_blue_velvet_in_interview_the_threat_of_race_s/ at 3'30"&lt;/ref&gt; both as a result of the kinds of material they planned to use and the architecture of the site. 

The design of the site was the result of "intense weekly conversations over something like a year"&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vectorsjournal.org/index.php?page=8|2&amp;projectId=82&lt;/ref&gt; and includes images, text, video, and sound files.  The project is set to the composition "Apparition," written by [[Liu Sola]].

== Content ==
The content of the project is available through two different presentations.  The first presentation, the main project [http://vectors.usc.edu/issues/5/bluevelvet/], is an interactive, linear presentation of text organized in the form of 24 "arguments."  The second presentation is an interactive index [http://vectors.usc.edu/issues/05_issue/bluevelvet/prjindex/] which allows the reader to navigate the text of the project independently. The project examines the effect of the hurricane on the city, and "underscores...that the tragic events that unfolded in New Orleans and along the Gulf Coast were possible precisely because of years of neoliberal policies that underwrote the necessary conditions for such devastation in the first place."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vectorsjournal.org/index.php?page=7&amp;pageContinue=914&amp;projectId=82&lt;/ref&gt;

== Arguments and key phrases ==
The reader progresses through the project argument by argument by clicking on key phrases associated with each argument.  This gives the reader access to the maps, images, graphs, videos and audio files as well as the text of each argument.  The arguments and key phrases composing Blue Velvet are:

'''Cartilage conduction''' is a pathway in which [[sound]] signals are transmitted to the [[inner ear]]. This pathway is distinct from conventional sound pathways such as air or bone. Therefore, cartilage conduction it referred to as the third auditory pathway.

==Overview==
Since approximately 450 years ago, two pathways have been acknowledged for transmitting sound to the inner ear; one is air conduction and the other is bone conduction. In 2004, Hiroshi Hosoi, a professor at Nara Medical University, discovered the phenomenon of cartilage vibration in the inner ear.&lt;ref&gt;Hosoi H, Yanai S, Nishimura T, et al. Development of cartilage conduction hearing aid, Archives of Materials Science and Engineering 2010; 42: 104-110&lt;/ref&gt; By attaching a [[vibrator (mechanical)|vibrator]] to aural cartilage, sound was found be transmitted into the inner ear well. He proposed the novel concept that cartilage has a unique characteristic capable of transmitting sound.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/tv/scienceview/201605020600/# |title=NHK　Science View　May 11, 2016　The Leading Edge: A New Sound Transmission Pathway |access-date=2016-12-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220152959/http://www3.nhk.or.jp/nhkworld/en/tv/scienceview/201605020600/# |archive-date=2016-12-20 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because sound transmission via pathways that use air or bone are respectively called air conduction and [[bone conduction]], the new pathway is referred to as '''cartilage conduction'''. This unique pathway has attracted the attention of several researchers and companies such that some [[hearing aid]] prototypes using cartilage conduction have been tested for use in [[smartphone]] and [[earphone]].

==Cartilage conduction in daily life==
One can hear a leathery sound when cleaning one’s [[ear canal]] using a cotton-tipped swab. This is an example of sound transmitted via cartilage conduction. In cartilage conduction, sound (vibration) energy stimulates the cartilages of the external auditory canal and induces air vibration. This air vibration can be then transmitted into the inner ear via the [[eardrum]] and [[middle ear]], which in turn activates the [[cochlear nerve]]. Air vibration created from cartilage conduction is combined with sound from air conduction at the ear canal, and thus an amplified sound is perceived. This same phenomenon can be experienced when a telephone receiver is pressed against one’s ear when it is difficult to hear the person on the other end of the call.

==Practical tools utilizing cartilage conduction==
1) Hearing aid

Cartilage conduction can be particularly useful for patients with disorders of the [[outer ear]], including aural [[atresia]], where conventional air conduction hearing aids cannot be used. The basic premise of cartilage conduction hearing aids is that cartilage located outside the ear canal is vibrated, such that the vibration can be transmitted despite the presence of any outer ear disorders. Because hearing contributes to language development, the practical availability of cartilage conduction hearing aids would be beneficial to children who suffer from disorders of the outer ear. Currently, a cartilage conduction hearing aid is being developed by RION CO., LTD.

2) Smartphone/Cell phone

Recently, a smartphone prototype using the benefits of cartilage conduction has been manufactured by ROHM Co., Ltd.&lt;ref&gt;Tanaka, M. Application of Cartilage Conduction to Smart-phone. Proc. of 20th International Federation of Oto-Rhino-Laryngological Societies (IFOS) World congress, No. ME72805 (2013)&lt;/ref&gt; This type of the smartphone provides clearer sound compared with conventional phones, even under noisy circumstances. Furthermore, the [[sound pressure level]] can be easily modified by adjusting the physical pressure level of the smartphone pressed against the outer ear. Importantly, the cartilage vibration, which is a sound source, can be heard only by oneself but not by others because sound from cartilage vibration cannot be leaked outside. This makes talking in public easy. In addition, the smartphone’s surface can be kept clean because one’s face or ear does not directly contact the smartphone’s surface. The cartilage conduction phone can also be used simultaneously with conventional air conduction hearing aids, which is good news for hearing-impaired people.

3) Earphone

The ear canal is not physically occluded by an earphone that operates via cartilage conduction. As such, this type of earphone allows one to hear alarm signals. Similar to the cartilage conduction smartphones, no sound is leaked from this type of earphone. Prototypes of such earphones have been manufactured by ROHM Co, Ltd.

4) Robot

Cartilage conduction has been considered for communicating with [[robots]]. Currently, loudspeaker systems are used to convey sounds produced by robots. However, such loudspeakers generate loud noises in a room filled with many robots that simultaneously emit speech sounds. Therefore, a man-to-man communication system is needed to overcome this problem. Cartilage conduction can realize better communication than loudspeaker systems.

==Cartilage conduction is distinct from bone conduction==
It was initially thought that cartilage conduction was a type of bone conduction. However, several studies demonstrated that the mechanisms of cartilage conduction differ from that of bone conduction.&lt;ref&gt;Nishimura T, Hosoi H, Saito O, et al. Is cartilage conduction classified into air or bone conduction? Laryngoscope 2014; 124:1214-1219&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shimokura R, Hosoi H, Nishimura T, et al. Cartilage conduction hearing. J.Acoust.Soc.Am. 2014; 135(4):1959-1966&lt;/ref&gt; Bone conduction is attributed to bone vibration at the skull, which is transmitted to the inner ear. In contrast, cartilage conduction is accounted for by sound (vibration) energy stimulating the cartilage at the external auditory canal to create sonic waves in the ear canal. Such sonic wave energy passes through the eardrum and the middle ear before finally activating the auditory nerve. These different mechanisms would explain the following observed differences between cartilage and bone pathways:

1. A variety of sound pressure levels can be created by contact pressure in cartilage conduction compared with that in bone conduction.

2. A sound in cartilage conduction is more stereophonic than that in bone conduction.

3. Frequency characteristics are different between cartilage and bone conduction.

The '''Chubb Fellowship''' is a [[fellow]]ship based and administered through [[Timothy Dwight College]], one of [[Yale University]]'s twelve [[residential colleges of Yale University|residential colleges]], and is one of Yale's highest honors for a visiting lecturer. In 1936, [[Hendon Chubb]] established a fund for “…the encouragement and aid of students interested in government and public affairs.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://chubbfellowship.org/about/history_past_fellows|title = History and Past Fellows - Yale Chubb Fellowship|date = |accessdate = 2015-02-02|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1949, Chubb and the Master of [[Timothy Dwight College]] collaborated to create a visiting fellowship program as the principal means to achieve this goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://chubbfellowship.org/about/history_past_fellows|title = History and Past Fellows, Chubb Fellowship |date = |accessdate = |website =Timothy Dwight College |publisher =Yale University |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Code for America''' is a [[non-partisan]], non-political [[501(c)(3)]] [[organization]] founded in 2009 to address the widening gap between the public and private sectors in their effective use of technology and design. According to its website, the organization works with residents and governments in solving community problems.&lt;ref name="About"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://codeforamerica.org/about/|title=About Code for America|accessdate=2014-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization began by enlisting technology and design professionals to work with [[local government|city governments]] in the [[United States]] in order to build [[open-source software|open-source]] applications and promote [[transparency (humanities)|openness]], [[participation (decision making)|participation]], and efficiency in government, and has grown into a cross-sector network of practitioners of civic innovation and a platform for "[[civic hacking]]".&lt;ref name="WhatWeDo"&gt;{{cite web |title=What We Do |url=http://codeforamerica.org/what-we-do/ |accessdate=2011-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through five programs, Code for America helps government work more like the Internet. 
* The largest program by numbers is the Brigade, which comprises local groups of civic hackers and other community volunteers who meet regularly to support the technology, design, and open data efforts of their local governments. Over 5,000 people in the US are involved in a Code for America Brigade. 
* Through the Fellowship program, small teams of developers and designers work with a city, county or state government for a year, building open source apps and helping spread awareness of how contemporary technology works among the government workforce and leadership. 
* Through the Accelerator, Code for America provides seed funding, office space, and mentorship to civic startups. 
* Code for America also runs a Peer Network for innovators in local government.  
* Lastly, Code for All (part of Code for America) organizes similar efforts outside the US, particularly Brigades and fellowship programs in countries around the world.&lt;ref name="About" /&gt;

The ''[[Washington Post]]'' described Code for America as "the technology world's equivalent of the [[Peace Corps]] or [[Teach for America]]". The article goes on to say, "They bring fresh blood to the solution process, deliver agile coding and software development skills, and frequently offer new perspectives on the latest technology—something that is often sorely lacking from municipal government IT programs. This is a win-win for cities that need help and for technologists that want to give back and contribute to lower government costs and the delivery of improved government service."&lt;ref name="Washington Post"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/on-innovations/code-for-america-an-elegant-solution-for-government-it-problems/2011/12/16/gIQAXrIu2O_story.html/ |title=Code for America: An elegant solution for government IT problems |first=Vivek |last=Wadhwa |publisher=Washington Post |date=2011-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[New York Times]]'' described Code for America as "a new nonprofit project... which aims to import the efficiency of the Web into government infrastructures" and "[tries] to make working in government fun and creative".&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/07/06/changing-government-and-tech-with-geeks/ |title=Changing Government and Tech With Geeks |first=Nick |last=Bilton |publisher=New York Times |date=2010-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Founding and history==
[[File:Code for America building 2013-04-13 12-27.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Code for America building in San Francisco]]

In 2009, the founder [[Jennifer Pahlka]] was working with [[O'Reilly Media]] at the [[Gov 2.0 Summit]] in [[Washington, DC]]. A conversation with Andrew Greenhill, the Mayor's Chief of Staff of the [[Tucson|City of Tucson]], sparked the initial idea for Code for America, when he said "You need to pay attention to the local level, because cities are in major crisis. Revenues are down, costs are up—if we don't change how cities work, they're going to fail."&lt;ref name="FastCompany"&gt;{{cite web |title=How an Army of Techies Is Taking On City Hall |url=http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/151/icitizen-bonus.html?page=0,0 |first=Anya |last=Kamenetz |publisher=Fast Company |date=2010-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two began discussing plans for a program that eventually became Code for America, "a one-year fellowship recruiting developers to work for city government".&lt;ref name="FastCompany"/&gt; With support from web entrepreneur Leonard Lin, [[Tim O'Reilly]] of O'Reilly Media, and technologist [[Clay A. Johnson]], among others, the organization was launched in September 2009.&lt;ref name="FastCompany"/&gt;

==Fellowship program==

Code for America connects city governments and web professionals through the Code for America Fellowship program.&lt;ref name="Mashable"&gt;{{cite web |title=Code for America Chooses 20 Developers as Fellows |url=http://mashable.com/2010/11/02/code-for-america-fellows/ |publisher=Mashable |date=2010-11-02 |accessdate=2011-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first year of the fellowship program began in January 2011. Twenty fellows were selected from 360 applicants, resulting in a 5.6% acceptance rate.&lt;ref name="GovTech"&gt;{{cite web |title=Code for America Fellows to Work with City Governments |url=http://www.govtech.com/education/Code-for-America-Programmers-City-Governments.html |publisher=Government Technology |date=2010-11-03 |accessdate=2011-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Boston]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Washington, DC]], and [[Seattle]] were the four cities selected to participate in the 2011 program.&lt;ref name="FastCompany 2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fastcompany.com/1714303/code-for-america-kicks-off-hacker-version-of-teach-for-america |title=Hacker Driven Code for America Kicks Off Today |date=2011-01-05 |accessdate=2011-01-15 |publisher=Fast Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 4, 2012 Code for America began its second year fellowship program with 26 fellows and eight cities: Austin, Chicago, Detroit, Honolulu, Macon, New Orleans, Philadelphia, and Santa Cruz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=codeforamerica.org/2012|url=http://codeforamerica.org/2012|work=2012|publisher=Code for America|accessdate=20 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2016 Code for America fellowship program is running in partnership with six cities: Kansas City, Missouri; Long Beach, California; New Orleans, Louisiana; New York City, New York; Salt Lake County, Utah; and Seattle, Washington.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://archive.codeforamerica.org/governments/2016-announcement/|title=The 2016 CfA Fellowship {{!}} Code for America|newspaper=Code for America|access-date=2016-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Projects==

The inaugural 2011 fellowship program launched four projects in [[Boston]], [[Seattle]], [[Philadelphia]], and [[Washington, DC]].&lt;ref name="FastCompany 2"/&gt; Each city partners with a team of five [[Web development|web programmers]] or [[web designers|designers]] selected for the fellowship. Over a period of 11 months, the fellows and city government collaborate to develop a [[application software|web application]] to solve a civic problem identified by the city in their project proposals.&lt;ref name="GovTech"/&gt; The completed software applications are released as [[Open-source software|open-source]] for any city government to use or adapt.&lt;ref name="Mashable"/&gt;

The [[Civic Commons]] project focuses on reducing public [[Information technology|IT]] costs by helping government entities share code and [[best practices]].&lt;ref name="DC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.film.dc.gov/DC/OCTO/About+OCTO/News+Room/Civic+Commons+Launched+to+Help+Government+Share+Technology+and+Cut+Costs|title=Civic Commons Launched to Help Government Share Technology and Cut Costs|publisher=DC.gov|accessdate=2011-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://civiccommons.org/about/|title=Code for America Commons - About|publisher=Civic Commons|accessdate=2011-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was launched in September 2010 after the Washington, DC project fell through due to a change in administration. Code for America Commons, as it is now called, is a coordinated effort between Code for America, [[OpenPlans]], and the District of Columbia's Office of the Chief Technology Officer (OCTO).  In March 2011, Code for America Commons helped make the Federal IT dashboard freely available to all levels of government, thereby providing local governments with tools to monitor project effectiveness and evaluate the allocation of resources.&lt;ref name=CFA-PR&gt;{{cite web|url=http://codeforamerica.org/press/itdb/|title=Cost-Saving IT Dashboard Software Now Available to All Levels of Government|accessdate=2011-04-20|publisher=Code for America|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20120205191217/http://codeforamerica.org/press/itdb/|archivedate=2012-02-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2011 Code for America announced the receipt of a $1.5 million grant from [[Google]] and the formation of two new programs: Accelerator and Brigade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Google Awards $1.5 Million To Code For America|url=http://informationweek.com/news/government/leadership/232300535|work=Google Awards $1.5 Million To Code For America|publisher=InformationWeek|accessdate=14 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Code for America Brigades are local groups of volunteers who build civic apps on open data in cities around the world.

In 2011, CFA coders developed an "Adopt a Hydrant" website, so that volunteers in Boston can sign up to shovel out [[fire hydrants]] after storms. The system has also been implemented in Providence, Rhode Island, Anchorage, Alaska, and Chicago. Honolulu has created a similar website, "Adopt-A-Siren", for its [[Civil defense siren|tsunami sirens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

In 2012, fellows at Code for America created [http://hnlgovanswers.herokuapp.com Honolulu Answers], a web application that provides simple, to-the-point answers to citizens' questions. The web application was populated with citizen input at a write-a-thon, which became a unique model for civic engagement. Both Honolulu Answers and the write-a-thon model have since been redeployed in a dozen cities around the world, including as [http://answers.oaklandnet.com Oakland Answers] and [http://durbananswers.herokuapp.com Durban Answers].

A '''commencement speech''' or '''commencement address''' is a speech given to [[graduation|graduating]] students, generally at a [[university]], generally in the [[United States]], although the term is also used for [[secondary education]] institutions.

The "commencement" is a ceremony in which degrees or diplomas are conferred upon graduating students. A commencement speech is typically given by a notable figure in the community, during the ''commencement exercise''.  The person giving such a speech is known as a '''commencement speaker'''. Very commonly, colleges or universities will invite politicians, important citizens, or other noted speakers to come and address the graduating class.

A commencement speech is less bound by the structure found in other forms of public address, like eulogies or wedding speeches. The speaker accordingly enjoys a unique freedom to express him or herself. Executive speechwriter Anthony Trendl writes

{{blockquote|A commencement speech, simply, is an opportunity to share your experience, values and advice. The precise form is up to you. This affords the speaker a platform to say amazing, unlimited things.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Anthony |last=Trendl |url=http://commencementspeechwriter.com/what-s-a-commencement-speech-.html |title=What Makes a Commencement Speech?}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14655">"'''Factory model schools'''", "'''factory model education'''", or "'''industrial era schools'''" are terms used to describe educational organization and facilities. The terms emerged in the mid to late-20th century as a rhetorical device used by speakers and writers advocating for a change to the American public education system. Generally speaking when people use one of the terms, they are referencing characteristics of European education that emerged in the late 18th Century and then in North America in the mid-19th century that include top-down management, standardization, outcomes designed to meet societal needs, age-based classrooms, efficiency, and a focus on producing results. The phrase is typically used in the context of discussing what the author identifies as negative aspects of public (or government-funded) school. For example, the factory model of schools are "designed to create docile subjects and factory workers".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/23/opinion/brooks-the-relationship-school.html ''The Relationship School'', David Brooks, NY Times, March 22, 2012].  Retrieved 2017-02-17&lt;/ref&gt; It is also used to suggest the structure and look of American schools hasn't changed in 100 years as Secretary of Education [[Betsy DeVos]] has in tweets and speeches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://twitter.com/BetsyDeVosED/status/971161379179843584|title=Does this look familiar?

==History of the Terms==
The first public use of the term "factory model schools" to describe K-12 education was by Dr. Howard Lamb in a speech in September, 1972. ''The Greenville News'' reported: "The educational institutions are producing teachers for the 1920 factory model schools, Lamb said." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Greenville School System Lauded for Work in Human Relations Area|last=Robinson|first=Gretchen|date=September 16, 1972|work=The Greenville News|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, Theresa Jablonski, in a 1970 editorial in the ''News Herald'' (Franklin, Pennsylvania), referenced "factory model of education" to describe college classrooms. Although it's likely that neither Jablonski or Lamb originated the term, their usage represents the terms' first appearance in the media.

In a 1989 piece in ''The Phi Delta Kappa,'' "The Horse is Dead", Dr Leslie A. Howard connected the term to Horace Mann's experiences in Prussia in 1843 but offered no references or evidence for the connection. Howard's piece was cited in numerous educational philosophy and theory texts in the 1980s and 1990s. The phrase has been used by education leaders including Marilyn Roth of the [[National Education Association]], in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Montana's 'archaic' school system needs radical change, teachers told|last=Carter|first=Dan|date=October 16, 1987|work=The Montana Standard|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Al Shanker, the president of the [[American Federation of Teachers]], referenced the concept in a 1989 speech, "The Revolution that is Overdue: From Information Factory to Learning and Teaching in Restructuring Schools."&lt;ref&gt;Shanker, Al. (1989) Speech. "The Revolution that is Overdue: From Information Factory to Learning and Teaching in Restructuring Schools." Retrieved March 3, 2018. [https://reuther.wayne.edu/files/64.62.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Ted Dintersmith, author of &lt;u&gt;What School Could Be: Insights and Inspiration from Teachers across America&lt;/u&gt; (2018), used the term in a graphic to describe the evolution of the American education system. In the graphic, "factory model" is connected to the year 1893 (the year the NEA [[Committee of Ten]] published their final report) and the goal of training "factory workers." The Committee of Ten report makes no mention of factories or factory workers. Authors will also draw connections between child-labor laws, factories, and the spread of tax-funded schools and compulsory education laws such as [[Seth Godin]] in his book, &lt;u&gt;Stop Stealing Dreams&lt;/u&gt; (2004).

[[John Taylor Gatto]]'s book ''The Underground History of Education'' published in 2001 linked the "factory school" model to a number of cultural ills and also connected Mann to Prussian factories. Gatto's text has been cited by multiple non-fiction books on education including &lt;u&gt;The End of Average&lt;/u&gt; by Todd Rose (2015) and &lt;u&gt;Schools on Trial&lt;/u&gt; by Nikhil Goyal (2016), both of which use the phrase to advocate a particular set of changes. Gatto does not explain how he reached the conclusion Mann wanted schools that worked like factories.

=="Factory Model" as a Metaphor==

In some cases, authors have used the term "factory model" as a [[metaphor]]. As a modern example, the animation and text of [[Ken Robinson (educationalist)|Sir Ken Robinson]]'s [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDZFcDGpL4U&amp;feature=youtu.be TedTalk] compares students in schools to materials in a factory and references children's "date of manufacturing" as a sorting mechanism. This clearest example of this in historical writing is in the research of Raymond E. Callahan, especially in ''Education and the Cult of Efficiency'' (1962).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Education and The Cult of Efficiency|last=Callahan|first=Raymond E.|publisher=The University of Chicago Press|year=1962|isbn=|location=Chicago, IL|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Callahan explored the relationship between public education and the emerging concept of [[Scientific management|Scientific Management]] in the 1910s and included quotes by school leaders who spoke of children as the "raw goods" schools were meant to mold into something better. The most prolific user of this analogy was [[Ellwood Patterson Cubberley]]. He saw the logical, methodical approach of scientific management as a way for public education to adapt to influxes of immigrants, white female students, and Black American children that were entering into the system and ensure the best outcomes. Cubberley wrote numerous guides for school administrators as well as a history book and was one of the most widely read educational authors of the 1910s and 1920s. He frequently used the metaphor of school as a factory and it's not uncommon for modern day authors to take his and his contemporaries' comments out of context.

A theory that deeply informed school leaders during this period was the work of [[Frederick Winslow Taylor|Frederick Taylor]]. His approach to time management was known as Taylorism and it influenced multiple aspects of American society, including education. An example of its adoption in the home are the experiences of [[Lillian Moller Gilbreth|Lillian]] and [[Frank Bunker Gilbreth Sr.|Frank Gilbreth]], whose scientific approach to parenting was described in their son's book [[Cheaper by the Dozen|Cheaper By the Dozen]]. In schools, this philosophical approach - that any problem could be solved by breaking it down into smaller units and considering time costs - was used in a variety of ways. For example, a group of English teachers in 1913 aggregated how much time they spend grading papers and used their findings to appeal to school leaders for more time to grade and provide feedback.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Report on the cost and labor of English teaching by a committee of the Modern Language Association of America and the National Council of Teachers of English|last=|first=|publisher=|year=1913|isbn=|location=https://archive.org/details/reportoncostlabo00moderich|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While teachers would use Tayalorism to their advantage and to plead their case, they also spoke up against it and its impact on their work. In 1903, [[Margaret Haley]] chided school administrators for failing to recognize teachers' hard work and a tendency toward "factory-izing education" and "making the teacher an automaton, a mere factory hand, whose duty it is to carry out mechanically and unquestioningly the ideas and orders of those clothed with the authority of position."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PoBrRQAACAAJ&amp;dq=Woman's+True+Profession&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjluNWanpTaAhXG11MKHfB3CtUQ6AEIKTAA|title=Woman's "true" Profession: Voices from the History of Teaching|last=Hoffman|first=Nancy|date=1981|publisher=Feminist Press|isbn=9780912670720|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haley used quotations around the phrase "factory-izing education" in her speech, suggesting she saw it as a metaphor, and not a direct comparison.

Although the phrase "factory model" didn't become a part of educational discourse until the 1980s, [[David Tyack|David B. Tyack]], a leader in the field of educational history, provided a context for it in his history of American urban education, &lt;u&gt;The One Best System&lt;/u&gt; (1974). "Just as eighteenth-century theologians could think of God as a clock-maker without derogation, so the social engineers searching for new organizational forms used the words 'machine' and 'factory' without investing them with the negative associations they evoke today."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The One Best System|last=Tyack|first=David B.|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1974|isbn=|location=Boston, Mass|pages=41–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; This idea that school leaders spoke about factories as a frame of reference is also explained in &lt;u&gt;Pillars of the Republic, Common Schools and American Society, 1780-1860&lt;/u&gt; by Carl Kaestle (1983).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://play.google.com/books/reader?id=-EJX9uzPs0sC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;pg=GBS.PT86.w.0.1.195|title=Pillars of the Republic: Common Schools and American Society, 1780-1860|last=Kaestle|first=Carl|date=2011-04-01|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|isbn=9781429931717|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Schools thus became in some respects like factories, but not necessarily because they were mimicking factories, or preparing children to work in factories. Rather, both the workplace and the schools, as well as other nineteenth-century institutions, were partaking of the same ethos of efficiency, manipulation, and mastery. (p. 90)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Problems with and Critiques of the Terms==
Setting aside that school leaders around the turn of 20th century used factories as a metaphor and not a philosophical foundation, there are at least two problems with the terms.

=== Historical Documentation ===
Horace Mann presented his thoughts following his trip to Prussia in a report to the Massachusetts Board of Education. He filed several reports and his 7th submission focused on his experiences in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=PU-cAAAAMAAJ&amp;rdid=book-PU-cAAAAMAAJ&amp;rdot=1|title=Mr. Mann's Seventh Annual Report: Education in Europe|date=1844|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Filed in 1844, the report contains no reference to Prussian factories nor mention of concepts like efficiency, trained workers, or docile children. While this alone isn't sufficient to refute claims about a factory model mentality informing the development of American schools, it does challenge claims by authors like Taylor Gatto that Mann was eager to replicate a model of education that would train children to work in factories. Likewise, the final report by the National Education Association's Committee of Ten makes no reference to factory skills or to modeling schools after factories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=XpxBAAAAIAAJ&amp;rdid=book-XpxBAAAAIAAJ&amp;rdot=1|title=Report of the Committee of Ten on Secondary School Studies [appointed at the Meeting of the National Educational Association July 9, 1892: With the Reports of the Conferences Arranged by this Committee and Held December 28-30, 1892|last=Studies|first=National Educational Association (U S. ) Committee of Ten on Secondary School|date=1893|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The "Look" of Factories ===
Factories that existed around the time of Mann and the spread of the common school movement don't resemble factories in the way we think of them today.

'''Fair Opportunity Project'''&lt;ref&gt;https://www.fairopportunityproject.org/&lt;/ref&gt; is a centralized platform of free [[college admission]]s and [[Student financial aid|financial aid]] resources. The resources provided by Fair Opportunity Project have been downloaded in 36 countries and are featured on 52 other websites. [[Luke Heine]] and [[Cole Scanlon]] founded the [[non-profit organization]] to improve the likelihood that young people from any background have equal information on the college and financial aid application process.

== History ==
Fair Opportunity Project was founded in April 2016. It was a [[United States of America|nation]]-wide effort to provide free college admissions resources building off of Luke Heine’s Midwest Information Parity Project that was sent to 6,000 principals and superintendents&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thecrimson.com/article/2015/11/12/midwest-club-college-guide/&lt;/ref&gt; in nine states.  In 2016, Fair Opportunity Project worked with various college students, high school counselors, and advisors to write a free 70-page college admissions and financial aid guide including successful college essays, free online videos, scholarship websites, and much more.

== Growth ==
Since sending out the first batch of guide to 57,000 public schools, Fair Opportunity Project has launched video modules and translated the guide into Spanish and Mandarin. In Fall 2017, the guide was sent to 64,000 public schools, awarded Forbes 30 under 30,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.forbes.com/profile/fair-opportunity-project/&lt;/ref&gt; and featured in Thrillest,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thrillist.com/lifestyle/nation/these-college-students-are-doing-amazing-things&lt;/ref&gt; the Harvard Ed Magazine,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gse.harvard.edu/news/ed/17/08/when-students-help-students&lt;/ref&gt; and the Harvard Gazette.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2018/01/harvard-students-develop-admissions-guide/|title=Harvard students develop admissions guide|date=2018-01-23|work=Harvard Gazette|access-date=2018-02-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''FEMRITE – Uganda Women Writers' Association''' is an [[NGO]] based in [[Kampala, Uganda]], whose programmes focus on developing and publishing women writers in Uganda and—more recently—in the East African region.&lt;ref name="ww-fr"&gt;"[http://www.wworld.org/about/affiliates/femrite.htm Affiliates: FEMRITE]."  Women's World.&lt;/ref&gt;  FEMRITE has likewise expanded its concerns to East African issues regarding the environment, literacy, education, health, women's rights and [[good governance]].&lt;ref name="femrite-programs"&gt;[http://www.femriteug.org/?view=3 "Programmes"], FEMRITE – Uganda Women Writers' Association. Retrieved 22 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
FEMRITE was founded in 1995 by [[Mary Karoro Okurut]], currently (as of 2011) a member of the 8th Parliament of [[Uganda]], but at that time a lecturer at [[Makerere University]]. Okurut was joined by [[Lillian Tindyebwa]], [[Ayeta Anne Wangusa]], [[Susan Kiguli]], [[Martha Ngabirano]], [[Margaret Ntakalimaze]], [[Rosemary Kyarimpa]], [[Hilda Twongyeirwe]], [[Philomena Rwabukuku]] and [[Judith Kakonge]].&lt;ref name="femrite-history"&gt;[http://www.femriteug.org/?view=21 "History of FEMRITE"].

FEMRITE – Uganda Women Writers' Association. Retrieved 22 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Of FEMRITE’s origins and mission, Kyomuhendo, in a 2003 interview with ''[[Feminist Africa]]'', stated: "To talk about FEMRITE is to talk about Uganda's literary scene, about Ugandan politics, and especially about the connections between women, politics and writing in Uganda."&lt;ref name="femrite-earlyyears-goretti"&gt;Kyomuhendo, Goretti.

==Biography==
Genevieve Taggard was born to James Taggard and Alta Arnold, both of whom were school teachers. Her parents were both active members of the [[Disciples of Christ]], and at age two her parents moved to [[Honolulu|Honolulu, Hawaii]], where they became missionaries and founded a school in which they also taught.

Genevieve Taggard began writing poetry at the early age of 13. In 1914 the family left Hawaii, and Taggard enrolled at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. Here she became an active member of the socialist political and literary community. She graduated in 1919 upon which she moved to [[New York City]] in 1920.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/poets/s_z/taggard/bio.htm|title=Genevieve Taggard: Biographical Note|website=www.english.illinois.edu|access-date=2018-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once in New York she started working for the publisher [[B. W. Huebsch]] and in 1921 she co-founded the journal ''The Measure'' along with fellow writer and friend [[Maxwell Anderson]]. In the same year she married poet and novelist [[Robert Wolf (poet)|Robert Wolf]] with whom she had her only child Marcia Wolf (later Liles). Upon living in New York for most of the 1920s she assumed a teaching position at [[Mount Holyoke College]], where she taught from 1929 to 1930.

In 1931, she was a [[Guggenheim Fellow]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gf.org/fellows/14464-genevieve-taggard]{{dead link|date=March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1932, she accepted a professorship at [[Bennington College]]. In 1934 Taggard and Wolf divorced, and the following year she married [[Kenneth Durant (journalist)|Kenneth Durant]].&lt;ref&gt;Edward T. James, Janet Wilson James, Paul S. Boyer, ''Notable American Women, 1607–1950: A Biographical Dictionary, Volume 3'', Harvard University Press, 1971, p422. {{ISBN|0-674-62734-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1934, she moved on to teach at [[Sarah Lawrence College]], where she remained until 1947, a year before her death.

Her poems were published in ''[[The Nation]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenation.com/authors/genevieve-taggard|title=Page not found|publisher=}}{{dead link|date=March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Kenyon Review]]'', ''[[The New Yorker]]'', ''[[The New Republic]]''.

During the 1930s, sparked in part by the [[Great Depression]], but also largely by her philanthropic upbringing and her commitment to socialism, her poetry began to reflect her political and social views much more prominently. During this time a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] allowed her to spend a year in [[Majorca]], [[Spain]] and [[Antibes]], [[France]]. The experience of Spain in its time shortly before the Spanish Civil War gave further rise and inspiration to her cause of raising social and political awareness of civil rights issues.

Her papers are held at [[Dartmouth College]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ead.dartmouth.edu/html/ml60.html|title=The Papers of Genevieve Taggard at Dartmouth College: Full Finding Aid|website=ead.dartmouth.edu|access-date=2018-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[New York Public Library]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nypl.org/sites/default/files/archivalcollections/pdf/mss2942.pdf |title=GT Papers|date= August 2011|website=nypl.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7026">The '''Howison Lectures in Philosophy''' are a lecture series established in 1919 by friends and former students of [[George Howison]], who served as the Mills Professor of Intellectual and Moral Philosophy and Civil Polity at the [[University of California, Berkeley]].

{{cquote|Professor Howison held the reasoned conviction that this world to its very depth is kindred to the human spirit; that it is a community of free persons, finite and infinite, sustained by the vision of the Perfect; and all his great powers were directed to awaken in others a loyalty to these ideas. And those, it would seem, would most speak from a foundation in his memory who were able to share with him this high purpose and conviction.|author=Founding donors of the Howison Lectures in Philosophy}}

[[File:ACPP road.jpg|thumb|The learning alliance Academic Cooperation Palestine Project (ACPP) hosts research partnerships around sensitive issues related to the Israeli Separation Wall.]]

A '''learning alliance''' is a diverse network of individuals committed to improving knowledge on a specific research topic.&lt;ref&gt;Lundy, M. 2004. Learning alliances with development partners: a framework for out scaling research results. In: Pachico, D. (ed.) Scaling Up and Out: Achieving Widespread Impact Through Agricultural Research. Cali, Colombia: International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT)&lt;/ref&gt; Learning alliances are often made up of small networks of public, private and/or civil society actors seeking to further social or political change.

==Learning alliance structure==

Learning alliances consist of a series of facilitated meetings or informal exchanges between [[stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]] with a common advocacy interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://learningalliance.ch/LearningAllianceWallMonitoring.html|title=Learning Alliance Wall Monitoring|work=learningalliance.ch}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individual actors or groups share knowledge on a topic in order to improve the validity, accuracy and dissemination of their analysis.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Lundy, Mark; Gottret, Maria Veronica (2006). Learning Alliances: An approach for Building Multi-stakeholder Innovation Systems in Smits, S.J., P.B. Moriarty and Sijbesma, C. (eds.) (2007) Learning Alliances: Scaling up innovations in water, sanitation and hygiene sector. Delft, the Netherlands, IRC International Water and Sanitation Centre (Technical Paper Series No 47). p.2&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the humanitarian sector==

Learning Alliances in the humanitarian sector often place importance on improving the capacity of disadvantaged social groups to solve problems on their own behalf.&lt;ref&gt;Lundy, Mark, Maria Verónica Gottret, and Jacqueline Ashby. 2005. "Learning Alliances: An Approach for Building Multi-Stakeholder Innovation Systems," ILAC Brief, no. 8 (2005). P.2&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Lundy, M. 2004. Learning alliances with development partners: a framework for out scaling research results. In: Pachico, D. (ed.) Scaling Up and Out: Achieving Widespread Impact Through Agricultural Research. Cali, Colombia: International Center for Tropical Agriculture (CIAT).&lt;/ref&gt; The learning alliance concept has ties to the field of [[Participatory Action Research]], or PAR, an approach to social research that emphasizes participation and action by community members.&lt;ref&gt;Flood, R. L. (2007). The Relationship of "Systems Thinking" to Action Research. In P. R. al., Handbook of Action Research.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[humanitarian]], [[Human development (humanity)|development]] and [[social research]] fields, the term Learning Alliance has been used by international aid groups to describe cross-boundary [[stakeholder networks]] focused on improving local civil society capacity.&lt;ref&gt;LearningAlliance.ch. 2014. Web resource.  http://learningalliance.ch/LearningAllianceWallMonitoring.html. Accessed April 1, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

== Academic literature==
The Learning Alliance approach was first discussed in literature in 1994 investigating what [[Michael Gibbons (sociologist)|Michael Gibbons]] called [[mode two]] knowledge production.&lt;ref&gt;Gibbons, Michael; Camille Limoges; Helga Nowotny; Simon Schwartzman; Peter Scott; Martin Trow (1994). The new production of knowledge: the dynamics of science and research in contemporary societies. London: Sage Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; Mode two knowledge production involves multidisciplinary teams that work together on specific problems in the real world, in contrast to mode one knowledge production, “which is motivated by scientific knowledge alone... and which is not bothered by the applicability of its findings”.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} [[Gibbons]] noted that this type of research “promotes the interaction of multiple actors with multi-layered sources of knowledge to cope with the complexity of fostering continuous technological, social and institutional innovations to respond to rapidly changing contexts and demands”.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Examples of learning alliances ==
In 2012 the United Nations Barrier Monitoring Unit (BMU) launched a formal Learning Alliance called the Academic Cooperation Palestine Project (ACPP) to enhance the educational and technical capacity of Palestinian researchers.  &lt;ref&gt;Golay, Francois et al. ‘Academic Cooperation to Foster Research and Advocacy Competences in the Occupied Palestinian Territory (West Bank). In Bolay Jean-Claude (eds.) Technologies for Sustainable Development. Springer: Cham, Switzerland, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; ACPP hosted local and international research partnerships around sensitive issues related to the Israeli Separation Wall, including land degradation, water rights and land title controls.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Relief and Works Agency. 2012. Barrier Monitoring Unit. Online Resource. http://www.unrwa.org/userfiles/2012061311624.pdf . Accessed April 1, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; ACPP is now called the WALL Learning Alliance.&lt;ref&gt;Wall Monitoring. The WALL Learning Alliance. Online Resource. http://learningalliance.ch/LearningAllianceWallMonitoring.html Accessed April 1, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the Digital Learning Alliance group formed to “improve economic growth in underserved areas of the U.S. by advocating for personalized education through the use of digital learning technologies”.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.digitallearningalliance.org&lt;/ref&gt;

The Learning Alliance, started in 2009 in the United States, was organized to further literacy among school children&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thelearningalliance.org/get-to-know-tla/history|title=Our History - The Learning Alliance|website=www.thelearningalliance.org|access-date=2017-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  In Indian River County, Florida, the Alliance worked with parents, community leaders, educators, and concerned citizens to achieve 90 percent literacy by third grade by 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tcpalm.com/story/specialty-publications/vero-beach/2017/11/22/literacy-project-gaining-national-attention-its-success-county-school-children/870331001/|title=Literacy project gaining national attention for its success with county school children|work=TCPalm|access-date=2017-11-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2017, through professional development opportunities, book drives, and after school and summer programs, literacy had increased to 56 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tcpalm.com/story/specialty-publications/vero-beach/2017/11/22/literacy-project-gaining-national-attention-its-success-county-school-children/870331001/|title=Literacy project gaining national attention for its success with county school children|work=TCPalm|access-date=2017-11-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Following a learning alliance structure, the group meets monthly.

[[File:Latin Public School.jpg|thumb|right|Boston Latin School, the oldest public high school in the United States.]]

The following are the '''oldest public high schools in the United States''' that are still in operation.  While some of these schools have operated as [[private school]]s in the past, all are currently [[Public school (government funded)|public school]]s. The list does not include schools that have closed or consolidated with another school to form a new institution. The list is ordered by date of creation, and currently includes schools formed before 1870.

'''Manila Waldorf School''' is the first [[Waldorf school]] in the [[Philippines]].  The school was founded in 1994 as a kindergarten, and currently has over 200 students from kindergarten up to Grade 12.

The Manila Waldorf School, Inc. (MWSI) is a private non-stock, non-profit educational foundation recognized by the Department of Education since 1994.  MWSI is part of the non-traditional educational movement.  Its philosophy is based on the teachings of the Austrian philosopher Dr. [[Rudolf Steiner]] on the development stages of childhood and adolescence.  MWSI is recognized by the [[Goetheanum]] in Dornach, Switzerland as an authentic Waldorf or Steiner school.

MWSI offers Parent-Toddler (Paslitan); Kindergarten (Palaruan); Grade School (Paaralan); and High School (Kawayan).  MWSI is located in Timberland Heights, [[San Mateo, Rizal]] just 15 minutes away from the Batansang Pambansa in Quezon City.  It also has a satellite kindergarten school situated in E. Rodriguez, Quezon City.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16933">The '''Minnesota State Knowledge Bowl Meet''' is an annual, two-day academic quiz competition sponsored by the Minnesota Service Cooperatives, which is Minnesota's governing body of [[Knowledge Bowl]].&lt;ref&gt;McCormack, Diane. [http://www.pineandlakes.com/stories/011807/news_20070118046.shtml Knowledge Bowl students must be smart, and quick] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715084215/http://www.pineandlakes.com/stories/011807/news_20070118046.shtml |date=2011-07-15 }}. ''Lake Country Echo'', January 18, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  The State Meet is held in April at Cragun's Resort in [[Brainerd, Minnesota|Brainerd]].

==Format==
The 48 teams that qualify for the Minnesota State Knowledge Bowl Meet are ordered by enrollment size and then are evenly divided, with the larger 24 schools in Class AA, and the smaller 24 schools in Class A. All schools from the Metro Region (Region XI) are automatically placed in Class AA. If one private school qualifies, it is automatically placed in Class AA, regardless of size. If two private schools qualify, the larger is placed in Class AA, and the smaller in Class A. If three private schools qualify, the larger two are placed in Class AA, and the smallest is placed in Class A, and so on.

The first day of the State Knowledge Bowl Meet begins in the evening with a banquet, at which all the teams are introduced. Following the banquet is the written round which consists of 60 questions. Once the written rounds are scored, the teams are ranked. In the event of a tie after the written round, certain questions will be used to break the tie. The state meet is "power-ranked," that is, teams are grouped together by their current standing as follows:

*Room 1: #1-2-3
*Room 2: #4-5-6
*Room 3: #7-8-9
*Room 4: #10-11-12
*Room 5: #13-14-15
*Room 6: #16-17-18
*Room 7: #19-20-21
*Room 8: #22-23-24

Teams are power ranked for five, 45-question oral rounds. At the end, the team with the highest total score is the State Champion. The top 3 teams receive trophies, and the top 6 teams receive medals. If there is a tie among the top 6 following the fifth and final oral round, it is broken by a 15-question "overtime." The Heritage Spirit Award is given to one team from each class that demonstrates a positive attitude and sportsmanship as voted on by the readers, computer operators, coaches, and other teams.

===Historical format===
In 2007, the State Tournament began using strength-of-scoring, or "SOS". After the last oral rounds, teams receive 1.5 extra points for each round they have competed in the top room, 1 extra point for each round in the second room, and 0.5 extra points for each round in the third room. This was done both to help break ties and to recognize that scoring points is harder in top rooms.

Prior to 2000, there was a "championship round," in which the top three teams (after five oral rounds) competed head-to-head to determine who would be champion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.district112.org/chs/Activities/AcademicTeams/ Chaska Academic Teams Online&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, the state meet was not split into two classes until 1996.

Regarding how the State Tournament ended up in the Brainerd resort area, former Metro ECSU Knowledge Bowl coordinator Marilyn McGowan says "It all hinges on a measles outbreak in Thief River Falls the year the tournament was to be held there and the state health department said we would have to cancel our plans to have it there.  Thus, at the last minute, it was moved to Cragun's.  The original plan was to have each ECSU region host it with it being held throughout the state.  However, it worked so well holding it in a resort without the temptations of a city, that it has been held at a Brainerd lakes resort ever since the episode with the measles outbreak.  We have also been at Madden's and Breezy Point."

The 1984 tournament had five oral rounds like today's, but in 1986 and 1987 only four oral rounds were played (in addition to the written round and championship round). In 1991 and before, oral rounds consisted of 60 questions.  In 1992 the change was made to 45 questions per round.

In 2013, only four oral rounds were used. Due to inclement weather across the state, the Friday schedule was moved back by a couple of hours to allow for late arrivals; the fifth oral round was eliminated to keep the meet more on schedule. It should be noted that this weather caused some schools to not be able to attend at all. Only 21 AA teams attended, instead of the usual 24.

==State champions and runners-up==
Blanks indicate incomplete records.  A second score by a team name indicates score in championship round (through 1999) or score in tiebreaker round (2000 and after).

The '''National League for Nursing''' ('''NLN''') is a national organization for faculty nurses and leaders in [[nurse education]].  It offers faculty development, networking opportunities, testing services, nursing research grants, and public policy initiatives to more than 40,000 individual and 1,200 education and associate members.&lt;ref&gt;http://nln.org/about&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission==
The National League for Nursing promotes excellence in nursing education to build a strong and diverse nursing workforce to advance the health of our nation and the global community.

==History==
The NLN was founded in 1893 as the '''American Society of Superintendents of Training Schools for Nurses''' and was the first organization for nursing in the U.S. In 1912, it was renamed the '''National League for Nursing Education (NLNE)''' and released the first '''Standard Curriculum for Schools of Nursing''' in 1917.
 
In 1942, the NLNE created individual membership, enabling African-American nurses to participate in the organization. &lt;ref&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://nln.org/about&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 1952, the NLNE combined with the '''National Organization for Public Health Nursing''' and the '''Association for Collegiate Schools of Nursing''' as the '''National League for Nursing''', and the United States Department of Education (USDE) recognized the NLN, including it on the initial list of recognized accrediting agencies. This allowed the NLN to assume responsibility for the accreditation of nursing schools in the U.S.
[[File:Willie Mae Jones 1955.jpg|alt=Willie Mae Jones|thumb]]
At this time the NLN included African-American nurses in positions, including the board of directors. Willie Mae Jackson Jones (pictured), of the Community Nursing Services of Montclair, New Jersey, served as the first African-American in the organization, as a member of the first NLN board of directors. &lt;ref&gt;Fondiller, SH (March 2000). "A Retrospective on Civil Rights: Pride and Progress". Nursing and Health Care Perspectives. 21 (2): 62. Retrieved 16 February 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, [[Dr. Lillian Holland Harvey]], the Dean of the Tuskegee Institute School of Nursing, was also on the board of directors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nursing.ua.edu/?page_id=3535|title=Dr. Lillian Holland Harvey {{!}} Capstone College of Nursing - The University of Alabama|website=nursing.ua.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Accrediting Commission ==
In 1996, the NLN Board of Governors approved establishment of an independent entity within the organization to be known as the '''National League for Nursing Accrediting Commission (NLNAC)'''. In 1997, the NLNAC began operations with sole authority and accountability for carrying out the responsibilities inherent to the accreditation processes. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;http://www.acenursing.org/acen-history-of-accreditation/&lt;/ref&gt; Fifteen Commissioners were appointed: nine nurse educators, three nursing service representatives, and three public members. The Commissioners assumed responsibilities for the management, financial decisions, policy-making, and general administration of the NLNAC. &lt;ref&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.acenursing.net/resources/ACEN%20Bylaws%20October%202017.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The NLNAC was incorporated as a subsidiary of the NLN in 2001, and twelve years later, the name of the NLNAC was changed to the '''Accreditation Commission for Education in Nursing (ACEN)''', the name under which the subsidiary continues to operate. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; On December 1, 2014, Marsal P. Stoll, EdD, MSN, was appointed the chief executive officer of the ACEN. &lt;ref&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.acenursing.org/marsal-stoll-named-acen-ceo/&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 2014, the NLN created an additional commission for nursing education accreditation, the '''Commission for Nursing Education Accreditation (CNEA)'''. On July 1, 2014, Judith A. Halstead, PhD, RN, FAAN, ANEF, was appointed executive director of the CNEA. &lt;ref&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.nln.org/newsreleases/judyhalstead.htm&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Both organizations operate to support the interests of nursing education through accreditation.  A core difference is that the ACEN is recognized by the USDE. This recognition includes the ACEN being recognized by the USDE as an “institutional” accreditation agency, and as such the nursing program offered by the “institution” can be eligible for Higher Education Reauthorization Act, Title IV funds through the ACEN. &lt;ref&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;https://www2.ed.gov/admins/finaid/accred/accreditation_pg9.html&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
 
A collection of papers including proceedings of annual conventions, meeting minutes, biographical data of early leaders, correspondence, and photos are held at the National Library of Medicine in Bethesda, Maryland. &lt;ref&gt;"National League for Nursing Records 1894-1952". National Library of Medicine.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''&lt;u&gt;Accredited Programs&lt;/u&gt;'''

The number of accredited programs awarding academic degrees, diplomas or certificates by the NLNAC as of 2010:
* Clinical Doctorate — 2
* Nursing Doctorate — 1
* Master of Nursing — 197
* Baccalaureate — 234
* Associate — 673
* Diploma — 53
* Practical Nursing — 162

==Testing==
The NLN provides the '''Total Assessment Program (TAP)''' for NCLEX Success, which is a comprehensive testing services program for nurse educators, students, and practitioners. TAP is a complete preparation package to assess students’ abilities and achievement prior to admission, after specific courses, and at the completion of nursing programs. The TAP package consists of Pre-Admission Exams; Achievement Exams, including Practice Tests and Remediation; Pre-NCLEX Readiness Exams; Live Review; and Question Review Bank (QRB).

===Transition from Middlesex to Kingston===
In April 2010, Middlesex University decided to close down Philosophy, its highest research-rated subject. Middlesex students and staff, and thousands of their supporters in the UK and around the world, campaigned to save it. The website set up as part of the effort to do so is still running today and is continually updated vis-à-vis related campaigns and issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://savemdxphil.com/|title=Save Middlesex Philosophy|website=Save Middlesex Philosophy|accessdate=2 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2010/jun/10/middlesex-philosophers-celebrate-survival|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|author=Frederika Whitehead|title=Middlesex Philosophers Celebrate Survival|accessdate=2 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://reclamationsjournal.org/issue03_peter_osborne.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110817010229/http://reclamationsjournal.org/issue03_peter_osborne.htm |archivedate=17 August 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Background and project===
Broadly speaking, Osborne's project has followed the conception and function of philosophy as ‘its own time comprehended in thought’ ([[Hegel]]). (At a talk at the ICA that was held in response to the (then) plans to close the philosophy department when Osborne and the CRMEP was based at Middlesex, he spoke of the fact that as a practise, philosophy is not [[quantifiable]]; that is, it is not something that is easily measurable by time.)

Osborne completed his doctoral thesis at the [[University of Sussex]] in England in 1988. Entitled ''The carnival of philosophy: philosophy, politics and science in Hegel and Marx'',&lt;ref name=phd/&gt; it no doubt formed some of the material for the more recently published ''How to Read Marx'' ([[Granta]] magazine, 2005), the fifth chapter of which recalls its title. A central influence on Osborne's thought has been the work of German [[philosopher]] [[Theodor W. Adorno]], who figures in his early essays concerning the problem of modernity and the crisis in the visual arts&lt;ref&gt;'Adorno and the metaphysics of modernism: the problem of a "postmodern" art', in Andrew Benjamin (ed.), The Problem of Modernity: Adorno and Benjamin (London: Routledge, 1989), 23-48; 'Torn Halves: Avant-Garde and Popular Culture in the 1980s', News from Nowhere, 7, issue on 'The Politics of Modernism'; Aesthetic Autonomy and the Crisis of Theory: Greenberg, Adorno, and the Problem of Postmodernism in the Visual Arts, new formations No. 9 Winter 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

Osborne's first book, ''The Politics of Time: Modernity and Avant-Gard''e ([[Verso Books]], 1995, reprinted 2011) was reflective of his general understanding of the modern European tradition of philosophy as being "first and foremost a philosophy of time",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radicalphilosophy.com/pdf/highlight147_3.pdf] {{dead link|date=December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; stemming from the work of Immanuel Kant, as founder of modern philosophy. Osborne discussed the politics of time in relation to contemporary art in a discussion organised by the Frieze Art Foundation and held in conjunction with the London [[Frieze Art Fair]] in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20081003223854/http://www.friezefoundation.org/talks/detail/its_about_time/]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a recent exchange with his colleague Eric Alliez at the Stanley Picker Gallery on 27 April 2007, Osborne explained that at "the end of the Eighties, my project became to "mediate ''[[Aesthetic Theory]]'' with the history of contemporary art since the 1960s" (understanding Adorno's project as "the project of mediating the transdisciplinary post-Kantianism of Benjamin's thought with the history of [[modernism]]") specifically, through the reinvention of 'the [[dialectic]] of construction and expression' (''Philosophy and Contemporary Art After Adorno and Deleuze: An Exchange'')&lt;ref&gt;Gest: Laboratory of Synthesis 1, edited by Robert Garnett &amp; Andrew Hunt, Bookworks (2008), p38, p37.&lt;/ref&gt;). The late work of Adorno anticipates the breakdown of the difference between the arts that Osborne is interested in coming to terms with (see Art Theory and [[Aesthetics]], below).

The follow-up to "The Politics of Time", ''Philosophy in Cultural Theory'', was concerned with what is currently (2011) being pursued further by the CRMEP; namely, the transdisciplinary status of philosophy, as opposed to its traditional self-understanding as a self-contained discipline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://speculativehumbug.wordpress.com/2010/06/11/osborne-and-hallward-on-philosophy-disciplinarity-and-taking-power/|title=Philosophy, as an activity, is constituted in its engagement with the non-philosophical|work=Speculative Humbug|accessdate=2 December 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110819062825/http://speculativehumbug.wordpress.com/2010/06/11/osborne-and-hallward-on-philosophy-disciplinarity-and-taking-power/#|archive-date=19 August 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://backdoorbroadcasting.net/2010/04/from-structure-to-rhizome/ ''From Structure to [[Rhizome]] Transdisciplinarity in French thought, 1945 to the present: histories, concepts, construction''s] ([http://www.radicalphilosophy.com Radical Philosophy Journal], issues 165 and 167)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Art theory and aesthetics===
''Conceptual Art'' ([[Phaidon Press]], 2002), constituted an authoritative survey of the art of the late Sixties and early Seventies (and beyond). [[Conceptual art]] challenged the aesthetic definition of the work of art, and attempted but failed to be absolutely anti-aesthetic. However secretly it triumphed, by rendering explicit to subsequent generations of artists the conceptual aspect of all art.

For Osborne, a crucial juncture in the transformation of the [[ontology]] of the work of art (what art most fundamentally is) is marked by the work of American artist [[Robert Smithson]]. According to this view, the traditional practise of art according to mediums ([[painting]], [[sculpture]], [[architecture]]) is understood to have been historically destroyed ontologically by a transcategorial practise and field&amp;nbsp;— inaugurated by work like Smithson's. This is intimated in the title for a lecture he gave on Smithson at the Centre for Contemporary Art in 2008: 'An interminable avalanche of categories': conceptual issues in the work of Robert Smithson (or, once more, against 'sculpture'), as part of a series of lectures given by significant art historians under the title ''Cornerstones''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wdw.nl/event.php?act_id=142%20] {{dead link|date=December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wdw.nl/project.php?id=165 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227121323/http://www.wdw.nl/project.php?id=165 |archivedate=27 February 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Osborne later made the speculative claim elsewhere that "contemporary art is [[post-conceptual]] art" in a public lecture delivered at the Fondazione Antonio Ratti (FAR), Villa Sucota, in [[Como, Italy]], 9 July 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fondazioneratti.org/mat/mostre/Contemporary%20art%20is%20post-conceptual%20art%20/Leggi%20il%20testo%20della%20conferenza%20di%20Peter%20Osborne%20in%20PDF.pdf|format=PDF|title=Contemporary art is post-conceptual art|author=Peter Osborne|location=Kingston University, London|date=9 July 2010 |website=Fondazioneratti.org|accessdate=2 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a claim made at the level of the ontology of the work of art (rather than say at the descriptive level of style or movement). Around the same time, he gave a lecture in conjunction with ''Pavilion'' on the concept of the contemporary and the work of The Atlas Group entitled ''The Fiction of the Contemporary: Speculative Collectivity and the Global Transnational''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vimeo.com/9087032|title=PETER OSBORNE: THE FICTION OF THE CONTEMPORARY: SPECULATIVE COLLECTIVITY AND THE GLOBAL TRANSNATIONAL|work=Vimeo.com|accessdate=2 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently published an essay in issue 15 of the ''Pavilion Journal for Politics and Culture'', entitled: ''Imaginary Radicalisms: Notes on the [[Libertarianism]] of Contemporary Art''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pavilionmagazine.org/archive.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727165621/http://pavilionmagazine.org/archive.html |archivedate=27 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Osborne published ''Anywhere or Not at All: Philosophy of Contemporary Art,'' which develops the speculative claim "contemporary art is post-conceptual art".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.versobooks.com/books/1430-anywhere-or-not-at-all|title=Anywhere or Not at All: Philosophy of Contemporary Art|publisher=Verso Books|access-date=2 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''portfolio strategy''' is a method for continuously improving educational opportunities in urban K-12 school systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.msdf.org/blog/2012/11/portfolio-schools-a-comprehensive-approach-to-district-improvement/|title=Portfolio Schools: A Comprehensive Approach to District Improvement|website=Michael &amp; Susan Dell Foundation|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The strategy entails managing a portfolio of schools by separating school oversight from school operations and by holding a school's status as contingent, rather than permanent, based on the school's performance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/ED532895.pdf Lake, Robin (2009), Performance Management in Portfolio Districts]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hill|first1=Paul|last2=Campbell|first2=Christine|last3=Guthrie|first3=James|title=Strife and Progress: Portfolio Strategies for Managing Urban Schools|date=2013|publisher=Brookings Institution Press|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=978-0-8157-2427-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The portfolio strategy in practice can be reduced to seven interrelated components: choice, autonomy, talent, varied supports, accountability, funding, and public engagement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crpe.org/research/portfolio-strategy/seven-components|website=Center on Reinventing Public Education|accessdate=11 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Childcare}}
A '''pre-school playgroup''', or in everyday usage just a '''playgroup''', is an organised group providing care and socialisation for children under five. The term is widely used in the [[United Kingdom]]. Playgroups are less formal than the [[preschool education]] of [[nursery school]]s. They do not provide full-time care, operating for only a few hours a day during school term time, often in the mornings only. They are staffed by [[nursery nurse]]s or volunteers, not by nursery teachers, and are run by private individuals or charities, rather than by the state or companies.

In the United Kingdom, since around the 1980s, the traditional territory of the playgroup has been encroached on by the expansion of more formal nursery education, and playgroups often now cater only for two- and three-year-olds before they move onto a nursery school. Over the same period there has been an increase in the state supervision of playgroups.

==Playgroups in the United States==
In the United States, a playgroup is an organization of parents with the expressed intent to have the children come together and play.  There are playgroups that cater to specific categories of parents, particularly including [[stay at home dad]]s, stay at home moms, and working moms.  In areas of the US where [[homeschooling]] is popular, it is not unusual to see groups especially for homeschooling families.  These can be part of local or even national playgroups.  Churches, rec centers, and other community organizations sometimes sponsor weekly or monthly playgroups.  Age limits are determined by the individual group.  Some groups have upper age limits and some do not.  It is not unusual to see groups where, in addition to activities for the children, there are social events for the whole family or for parents only.  In highly mobile communities, playgroups can be an important tool for building the social network of young families who have recently relocated to the area. There are a number of resources online for parents to find playgroups in their area - including [http://www.playgroupsusa.com Playgroups USA] and [http://www.socialtoddler.com Social Toddler] - both directories and social networks for parents in playgroups.

==International Playgroups in the Netherlands==

In The Netherlands, international or expatriate parents form small groups, local to their area, for the purpose of providing a play space for babies and toddlers up to the age of 4-5, as well as offering a support network for the parents themselves.  Meetings are usually held weekly in a hall or other public venue, and the groups usually organize other social activities such as Ladies Nights Out, visits to local parks and zoos, summer barbecues etc.  In Maastricht, for example, the Maastricht International Playgroup  was established more than 10 years ago as a way to cater to the needs of expatriate families living in and around the area.

Another International Playgroup is [http://firstfriendsvoorhout.blogspot.com First Friends] in Voorhout (in the Leiden area).

==Playgroups in Australia==
Playgroup Australia is the national peak and administrative body for playgroups in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.playgroupaustralia.com.au/files/pdf/playgroupAU_page_Vision_and_Mission.pdf|title=Vision and Mission|publisher=Playgroup Australia|format=PDF|accessdate=2010-06-29|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130503225437/http://playgroupaustralia.com.au/files/pdf/playgroupAU_page_Vision_and_Mission.pdf|archivedate=2013-05-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Playgroup is an informal session where mums, dads, grand parents, caregivers, children and babies meet together in a relaxed environment.&lt;ref name="whatis"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Playgroup Australia|date=December 4, 2008|title=What is a Playgroup?|accessdate=2008-12-04|url=http://www.playgroupaustralia.com.au/go/what-is-a-playgroup|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090113155117/http://www.playgroupaustralia.com.au/go/what-is-a-playgroup|archivedate=January 13, 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Playgroups are set up and run by parents and caregivers, with children choosing from a range of activities set up to meet their varying needs. Activities at playgroup are either free or low cost, and may include Music and singing, Imaginative play,
Outdoor and free play, Art and craft activities or Outings.&lt;ref name="whatis" /&gt;

Playgroup can be held anywhere that is safe for children and where groups of people can meet - community and neighbourhood centres, health clinics, women's centres, preschools and kindergartens, church halls and even in someone's house. In a playgroup, parents and caregivers stay to interact with the other adults; and to play with the children. No child is too young for playgroup. All children from 0–5 years, including babies, love new experiences and benefit from developing sensory, social and communication skills through activities at playgroup.

March 2003 saw a dramatic increase in the number of mothers attending playgroup. &lt;ref name="whatis" /&gt;

==Playgroups in Hong Kong==
In Hong Kong, pre-school children (0 – 3 years) join playgroups to study (mostly foreign languages) in an interactive environment before they go on to kindergartens.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14915">The '''Sir Robert Rede's Lecturer''' is an annual appointment to give a public lecture, the '''Sir Robert Rede's Lecture''' (usually '''Rede Lecture''') at the [[University of Cambridge]].&lt;ref&gt;See [http://janus.lib.cam.ac.uk/db/node.xsp?id=Glossary%2FRede%20Lectures]. The series was put on its current footing in 1858.&lt;/ref&gt; It is named for [[Robert Rede|Sir Robert Rede]], who was [[Chief Justice of the Common Pleas]] in the sixteenth century.

==Initial series==
The initial series of lectures ranges from around 1668 to around 1856. In principle, there were three lectureships each year, on Logic, Philosophy and Rhetoric. These differed from the later individual lectures, in that they were appointments to a lectureship for a period of time, rather than an appointment for a one-off annual lecture. There was also a Mathematics lectureship which dated from an earlier time, while another term used was "Barnaby Lecturer", as the lecturers were elected on [[St Barnabas Day]]. A selection of the lecturers, who tended to have studied at Cambridge and be appointed after becoming Fellows of a College, is given below, with a full listing given in the sources.

'''''Rock Manager''''' is a [[business simulation game]] for [[Microsoft Windows]].

==Gameplay==
Rock Manager puts the player in control of a [[rock band]] with the task of making them into rockstars.

Play starts with putting a band together. The player chooses from a list of musicians with all tastes and styles. Record a demo in a studio, adding effects to the song to make is fit the band's image. With a demo in hand, it's up to the player to bag a record deal, arrange gigs, promote the record and go on the road. But it is important to keep an eye on the musicians and keep them happy or the band might self-destruct.

Options are selected using an icon system, but recording and practicing takes place in real time.

There are five styles of music you can use: [[Rock music|Rock]], [[Pop music|Pop]], [[Dance]], [[Punk rock|Punk]] and [[heavy metal music|Heavy metal]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18179">The '''Schools Interoperability Framework''', '''Systems Interoperability Framework''' (UK), or '''SIF''', is a data-sharing [[open standard|open]] [[specification]] for academic institutions from kindergarten through workforce.  This specification is being used primarily in the United States, Canada, the UK, Australia, and New Zealand; however, it is increasingly being implemented in India, and elsewhere.

The specification comprises two parts: an [[XML]] specification for [[data modeling|modeling]] educational data which is specific to the educational locale (such as North America, Australia or the UK), and a [[service-oriented architecture]] (SOA) based on both direct and brokered [[RESTful]]-models for sharing that data between institutions, which is international and shared between the locales.

SIF is not a product, but an industry initiative that enables diverse applications to interact and share data.  {{As of | 2007 | March}}, SIF was estimated{{by whom?|date=October 2018}} to have been used in more than 48 US states and 6 countries, supporting five million students.

The specification was started and maintained by its [[Standards organization|specification body]], the [[Schools Interoperability Framework Association]], renamed the Access For Learning Community (A4L) in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Dian Schaffhauser|url= https://thejournal.com/articles/2015/06/02/sif-association-remakes-itself-to-focus-on-data-usage-in-schools.aspx|title= SIF Association remakes itself|publisher= The Journal|date= June 2, 2015|accessdate= December 20, 2017}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Traditionally, the standalone applications used by public school districts have the limitation of data isolation; that is, it is difficult to access and share their data.  This often results in redundant data entry, [[data integrity]] problems, and inefficient or incomplete reporting.  In such cases, a student's information can appear in multiple places but may not be identical, for example, or decision makers may be working with incomplete or inaccurate information. Many district and site technology coordinators also experience an increase in technical support problems from maintaining numerous proprietary systems.  SIF was created to solve these issues.&lt;ref&gt;Marty Weil, [https://web.archive.org/web/20070630075656/http://content.scholastic.com/browse/article.jsp?id=11263 Scholastic Article, January 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Schools Interoperability Framework (SIF) began as an initiative chiefly championed initially by Microsoft to create "a blueprint for educational software interoperability and data access."  It was designed to be an initiative drawing upon the strengths of the leading vendors in the K-12 market to enable schools' IT professionals to build, manage and upgrade their systems. It was endorsed by close to 20 leading K-12 vendors of student information, library, transportation, food service applications and more. The first pilot sites began in the summer of 1999, and the first SIF-based products began to show up in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;[http://xml.coverpages.org/sif.html Historical references (has some brokenlinks)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the beginning it was not clear which approach would become the national standard in the [[United States]]. Both SIF and [[Electronic Data Interchange|EDI]] were vying for the position in 2000 but SIF began taking the lead in 2002 or so. In 2000, the National School Boards Association held a panel discussion during its annual meeting on the topic of SIF.

In 2007 in the United Kingdom [[Becta]] has championed the adoption of SIF as a national standard for schools data interchange.

In 2008 it was announced that in the UK the standard will become known as the "Systems Interoperability Framework". This reflects the intention in the UK to develop SIF to be used in other organizations beyond just schools.

==Strengths==
Some features of SIF that make it well-suited for data interoperability are:
*It is an XML standard that exists built entirely and specifically for the exchange of K-12 education-related information.  It is worth noting that although the standard is documented in XML, data can be exchanged and presented in [[JSON]] format which is favored by app developers;
*Case studies show significant dollar savings for schools and districts;
*Many school districts require that K-12 data vendors use SIF, and some states like Oklahoma are even legislating its use;
*Many vendors in the K-12 space already have SIF agents that have met SIF certification criteria and several brokers (sometimes known as Zone Integration Servers, or "ZIS") are available in the market. With many SIF agents available &amp; capable of interacting with or without brokers, barriers for school district use have been significantly reduced;

==Members==
The SIF specification is supported by the [[Access For Learning Community|A4L]] community.    A4L members collaborate on a variety of technical solutions and standards which include but are not limited to the Schools Interoperability Framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sifinfo.org/us/members-list.asp|title=SIF Association Members List|publisher=SIF Association|accessdate=August 28, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090701201638/http://www.sifinfo.org/us/members-list.asp|archivedate=July 1, 2009|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Members include districts, states, vendors, non-profits, and various government agencies.

==Criticism==
SIF has all the pains and challenges that come with any [[service-oriented architecture|SOA]] specification and data model.  When building specifications via consensus not everyone is always happy and sometimes the end product isn't perfect. Also given all the moving parts in modeling the entire K12's enterprise the specification has many points of possible failure. This is not particular to SIF but to any record-level, automated system moving standardized data from one source to another in a heterogeneous environment.  Out-of-the-box interoperability and ease of use and implementation were part of a 12-18 month focus from 2007 and through 2009.

==How SIF Works==
SIF  2.x relied on using a broker called a Zone Integration Server (ZIS) to manage communication between applications.  SIF 3.x and SIF 2.8+ allows for both brokered and direct communication between applications.

===Brokered===
Rather than have each application vendor try to set up a separate connection to every other application, SIF has defined the set of rules and definitions to share data within a "SIF Zone"&amp;mdash; or ''Environment'' which is a logical grouping of applications in which software application agents communicate with each other through a central communication point. Zones are managed by an enterprise data broker sometimes called a Zone Integration Server (ZIS). A single ZIS can manage multiple Zones. However, the current infrastructure specification supports [[Representational state transfer|RESTful]] connections directly between applications AND/OR utilizing a brokered environment.

Data travels between applications as a series of standardized messages, queries, and events written in XML or JSON and sent using [[Internet protocols]]. The SIF specification defines such events and the "choreography" that allows data to move back and forth between the applications.&lt;ref&gt;[[Live distributed object|early models]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Direct===
Direct SIF allow one application to communicate directly to another via simple REST calls to PUT, POST, GET, or DELETE resources. This is ideal for simple environments with two or maybe three players where complex choreographies are not necessary. It is easier to implement than a brokered environment in two- or three-node situations.

===Interface Code===
SIF Agents are pieces of software that exist either internal to an application or installed next to it.  The SIF Agents function as extensions of each application and serve as the intermediary between the software application and the SIF Zone. In brokered environments, the broker keeps track of the Agents registered in the environment and its Zones and manages transactions between Agents, enabling them to provide data and respond to requests. The broker controls all access, routing, and security within the system. Standardization of the behavior of the Agents and the broker means that SIF can add standard functionality to a Zone by simply adding SIF-enabled applications over time.

===Vertical interoperability===
"Vertical interoperability" is a situation in which SIF agents at different levels of an organization communicate using a SIF Zone. Vertical interoperability involves data collection from multiple agents (upward) or publishing of information to multiple agents (downward). For example, a state-level data warehouse may listen for changes in district-level data warehouses and update its database accordingly. Or a state entity may wish to publish teacher certification data to districts. The three pieces of the SIF specification that deal directly with vertical interoperability are the Student Locator object, the Vertical Reporting object, and the Data Warehouse object.
A good example of this would be the Century Consultants SIS Agent working with the Pearson SLF Agent sending student data to the State Agency and getting Student Testing Identifiers in return.

==SIF in relation to other standards==
SIF was designed before [[REST]], [[SOAP]], [[namespaces]], and [[web service]] standards were as mature as they are today. As a result, it has a robust SOA that is more vetted than the current SOAP specifications but does not use the SOAP or WS standards. The 2.0 SIF Web Services specification began the process of joining these two worlds, and the 3.0 Infrastructure specification completes the transformation to a [[Service-Oriented Architecture|SOA]] specification using modern tools.

The 2.0 Web Services specification allows for more generalized XML messaging structures typically found in [[enterprise messaging system]]s that use the concept of an [[enterprise service bus]].  Web service standards are also designed to support secure public interfaces and [[XML appliance]]s can make the setup and configuration easier.  The SIF 2.0 Web Services specification allows for the use of Web Services to communicate in and out of the Zone.

The 3.0 Infrastructure allows any data payload to be moved across it and is designed around [[RESTful]] design patterns.  It allows both brokered and direct exchanges in a RESTful manner utilizing either XML or JSON payloads.

===CEDS===
Starting with SIF 3.0 the SIF Specification relies entirely-unless impossible or not practical- on the Common Education Data Standards [[Common Education Data Standards|CEDS]] for its controlled vocabulary and element definition. This allows it to transport CEDS over the wire and be compatible with other CEDS-compliant data sets.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150713224121/https://www.sifassociation.org/NewsRoom/Documents/CEDS_and_SIF_From_Architecture_to_Solution.pdf SIF announces relationship to CEDS]&lt;/ref&gt;

===LISS (Australia)===
A similar standard LISS supports vendor integration 'within' a school site. This overcomes some limitations where a school has elected to use a Zone integration server (not a requirement in SIF 3.x implementations) LISS&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liss.org.au www.liss.org.au] Lightweight Interoperability Standard for Schools]&lt;/ref&gt; Lightweight Interoperability Standard for Schools connects primarily smaller, 'local' modules, such as timetabling, roll call, reporting or others, to the main admin system on a given school site. LISS works either across the web, or via a local network, and has a simpler format.

===Other Standards===
SIFA is also working closely with the Postsecondary Electronic Standards Council ([[PESC]]), [[SCORM]], and other standards organizations.

==Versions==
In August 2013 the SIF Association announced the release of the SIF Implementation Specification 3.0.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sifassociation.org/Resources/Developer-Resources/SIF-3-0/Pages/default.aspx SIF 3 Version]&lt;/ref&gt; The SIF Implementation Specification (North America) 3.0 is made up of a globally utilized reference infrastructure and North America data model focusing on supporting the [http://ceds.ed.gov Common Education Data Standards (CEDS)] initiative.&lt;ref&gt;[http://CEDS.ed.gov Common Education Data Standards(CEDS)]&lt;/ref&gt; The new 3.0 infrastructure allows the transport of various data models including those from the other global SIF communities as well as data from the numerous “alphabet soup” data initiatives that are populating the education landscape.  In essence – education now can utilize “one wire with one plug” – not the never-ending proprietary API’s and “one off” connections. The specification fully supports RESTful Web Services and SOAP-based protocols.

The Australian 3.4 Data Model specification had came out in Fall of 2016,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://specification.sifassociation.org/Implementation/AU/3.4/|title=Systems Interoperability Framework™ SIF Implementation Specification (Australia) 3.4|publisher=Systems Interoperability Framework|date=October 19, 2016|accessdate=December 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a 3.1.2 release of the Global SIF Infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://specification.sifassociation.org/Implementation/Infrastructure/3.2.1/changes.xhtml|title=Infrastructure (Global) 3.2.1 Changes|publisher=Systems Interoperability Framework|date=June 2016|accessdate=December 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The version 2.7 specification is the previous 2.x version of SIF. Most of the SIF implementations in the United States and abroad are 2.x deployments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://specification.sifassociation.org/Implementation/US/2.7M/html/|title=Schools Interoperability Framework™ SIF Data Model Implementation Specification (NA) 2.7 Migration|publisher=Schools Interoperability Framework|date=March 2014|accessdate=December 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===SIF Express===
The SIF 3.2 Release includes the SIF XPress Roster and the SIF Xpress Student Record Exchange (SRE). These are the result of work being done by various members of the association (vendors, agencies, regional centers) on a more easily adopted, easier to implement sub-set of the specification that handles the roster and basic uses cases.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150713223750/https://www.sifassociation.org/Events/Presentation%20Archive/WEBINAR%20-%20SIF%20xPress.pdf SIF XPress explained]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150402132011/https://www.sifassociation.org/NewsRoom/Press%20Releases/The%20SIF%20Association%20publishes%20tools%20to%20make%20SIF%20Simple.pdf SIF Simple press release]&lt;/ref&gt;
=== Privacy ===
The Access for Learning community has recently started taking strong leadership in the education Privacy space globally.   The association has created and supports an organization called the Student Data Privacy Consortium, or SDPC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SDPC|url=https://secure2.cpsd.us/a4l/|website=Student Data Privacy Consortium|publisher=A4L|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Shoulder to Shoulder''' ('''StoS''') or '''Hombro a Hombro''' is a grassroots, community-based, non-profit [[non-governmental organization]] (NGO) registered in [[Honduras]] since 1996. The organisation develops and improves [[health]] and [[education]]al programs, aiming to help poor Hondurans achieve quality [[health care]] and sustained [[social development]]. To date, StoS has created and continued on some notable educational programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indeed.com/cmp/Shoulder-to-Shoulder |title=Shoulder to Shoulder |publisher=Indeed.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Library Program==

Reading materials in Honduran schools are very limited and students are prohibited from even touching the few [[Children's literature|storybook]]s that must be kept in possession by the teacher at all times. As such, the StoS [[library]] program was started in 2007, with around 75 donated books housed in the [[Santa Lucia]] clinic, in order to provide an avenue for children to engage in creative learning through books. Eventually, the library expanded to include an exercise class, English lessons, movie night, and a [[Book discussion club|book club]] for young adults.

A newer and bigger library was subsequently built in the same area in March 2009, which contains storage closets, bathrooms, a [[computer lab]] with online research capabilities, crafts, games, toys and books (along with a borrowing system established). Activities such as story hour, [[geography]] club and a [[life skills]] course for scholarship students are conducted weekly. Overall, the StoS library program has and will continue to benefit the cognitive learning abilities of the Honduran community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shouldertoshoulder.org/library.htm|title=Library Program|publisher=ShoulderToShoulder.org|date=|accessdate=2011-09-17}}{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Girls’ Leadership Project (Yo Puedo)==

The aim of this project was to help promote the role of females in Honduran society. StoS first trained a group of Honduran [[teacher]]s, using Training of Trainers (TOT) sessions that emphasized on enhancing the socio-economic capital of poor women in the surrounding poorest communities, who are seldom educated beyond third grade and almost never beyond sixth grade. The teachers would impart their knowledge to, and guide, the selected Honduran girls, who would then apply this knowledge to the initiation and undertaking of small-scale, home-based businesses that meet community needs. This helps to develop the girls’ [[self-esteem]] and groom their potential as leaders.

The results of Yo Puedo were very desirable; besides the gains in specific skills from the different projects that girls undertook, they also became more outgoing and spontaneous. Expressing more interest and performing better in their academics, almost all showcased a desire to continue their education beyond sixth grade. Communication between the community and the school increased too, due to the enhanced social involvement of the female students. Most importantly, there was a change in [[gender]] perceptions by the males: boys, who were initially upset about the program, gradually supported and even [[Volunteering|volunteer]]ed for it.

Sustenance of effort and interest in the project is achieved through ongoing one-on-one consultations between teachers and girls in various schools, as well as continuous participation from US volunteers. Girls are also reinvesting their earnings to continue the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shouldertoshoulder.org/girls_leadership.html|title=Girls Leadership Project|publisher=ShoulderToShoulder.org|date=|accessdate=2011-09-17|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111026101227/http://shouldertoshoulder.org/girls_leadership.html|archivedate=2011-10-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Limitations of Projects==

StoS’s projects focus mainly on tackling the issue of quality and quantity of education in Honduras, but other major obstacles to obtaining education in the country still remain, namely family [[poverty]], indigenous [[discrimination]] and [[gender inequality]].

'''Steve Ellner''' (born December 21, 1946) has taught economic history and political science at the [[Universidad de Oriente]] in Puerto La Cruz, Venezuela since 1977. He is the author of numerous books and journal articles on Venezuelan history and politics, specifically in the area of political parties and organized labor. In addition, Ellner was a frequent contributor to ''[[Commonweal (magazine)|Commonweal]]'' magazine beginning in the 1980s and more recently ''[[In These Times]]'' and ''[[NACLA Report on the Americas]]'' and has written op-ed articles in the ''[[New York Times]]'' and the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. He frequently lectures on Venezuelan and Latin American political developments in the U.S. and elsewhere. Nearly all his academic works have been translated and published in Spanish.

== Early life ==

Ellner was born in New York City where his paternal grandfather and grandmother arrived from Austria and Finland respectively. His grandfather, Joseph Ellner, was a writer and editor of ''The Gipsy Patteran''.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Ellner (ed.), ''The Gipsy Patteran’’. London, 1926.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1954, Ellner’s family moved to Connecticut.

Throughout his university education, Ellner majored in Latin American history. He received his BA at [[Goddard College]] in Vermont, his MA at [[Southern Connecticut State University]] and his PhD at the [[University of New Mexico]], where his advisor was the prominent historian Edwin Lieuwen. In the 1960s, Ellner actively participated in [[Students for a Democratic Society (SDS)]] and later the American Independent Movement (AIM) in New Haven, Connecticut and the [[United Farm Workers]] boycott committee in Albuquerque, New Mexico.

Ellner is married to Carmen Hercilia Sánchez and has two children.

== Academic career ==

In addition to being a full-time professor at the UDO, Ellner has been a visiting professor at the Universidad Central de Venezuela (1994-2001), [[St. John Fisher College]] in Rochester, NY (2001), Georgetown University (2004), Duke University (2005), Universidad de Buenos Aires (2010), the Australian National University (2013) and Tulane University (2015), and has taught at the [[School of International and Public Affairs]] of Columbia University (2011) and Johns Hopkins University (2012). Ellner is a participating editor of ‘‘[[Latin American Perspectives]]’’ and a member of the advisory board of ‘‘[[Science &amp; Society]]’’.

Ellner centered his research on the internal currents of political parties and the labor movement that often gave rise to schisms in subsequent decades. In his dissertation and subsequent articles, he traced the left-leaning factions within the social democratic [[Democratic Action]] party (AD) in the 1940s that were the seeds of splits in the 1960s giving rise to the Revolutionary Left Movement (MIR), the [[People's Electoral Movement (Venezuela)]] and internal blocs in succeeding decades.&lt;ref&gt;Ellner, The Venezuelan Left in the Era of the Popular Front, 1936-45.” ''Journal of Latin American Studies'', vol. 11, no. 1 (May 1979), pp. 183-184.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, his ''Venezuela’s Movimiento al Socialismo: From Guerrilla Defeat to Innovative Politics'' demonstrates that the most avid and committed supporters of the armed struggle in the 1960s ended up breaking with the [[Communist Party of Venezuela]](PCV) to form the [[Movement for Socialism (Venezuela)|Movement for Socialism]] (MAS) in 1971 and other parties.&lt;ref&gt;Ellner, ''Venezuela's Movimiento al Socialismo: From Guerrilla Defeat to Electoral Politics''. Durham, NC, 1988, pp. 43-49.&lt;/ref&gt; Ellner concludes that internal party tensions prior to the era of neoliberalism in the 1990s went beyond personality clashes and personal ambitions and had political and even ideological implications. This thesis runs counter to widely held assertions reflected in scholarly writing that political disputes within and between establishment parties in Venezuela during those years were largely devoid of issues of substance.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Coppedge, ''Strong Parties and Lame Ducks: Presidential Partyarchy and Factionalism in Venezuela''. Stanford, CA, 1994. {{ISBN|0-8047-2278-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In several works beginning in 1989,&lt;ref&gt;Ellner, “Venezuela: No Exception.” ''NACLA: Report on the Americas,’’ vol. 23, no. 1 (May 1989), pp. 8-10.&lt;/ref&gt; Ellner employed the concept of “Venezuelan exceptionalism” to describe what he considered to be an exaggerated view of the attractiveness of the nation’s liberal democracy since the outset of the modern democratic period in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;Ellner, ''Organized Labor in Venezuela, 1958-1991: Behavior and Concerns in a Democratic Setting''. Wilmington, DE, 1993, pp. 86-91.&lt;/ref&gt; Ellner claimed that Venezuela’s status as an oil exporter and its democratic stability convinced many scholars and Venezuelans in general that the nation was not susceptible to the military coups and political and social disorders that plagued its Latin American neighbors in the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;David Smilde, “Introduction,” in Smilde and Daniel Hellinger (eds.) ''Venezuela’s Bolivarian Democracy: Participation, Politics, and Culture under Chávez.'' Durham, NC, 2011, pp. 3-4. {{ISBN|978-0-8223-5041-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Ellner argued that Venezuela’s relatively high degree of social mobility did not necessarily reduce levels of social tension and conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Ellner, ''Rethinking Venezuelan Politics: Class, Conflict and the Chávez Phenomenon'', Boulder, CO, 2008, pp. 7-9.&lt;/ref&gt; He also contended that the depiction of Venezuela as a “model” or “showcase” democracy overlooked alleged violations of democratic norms and human rights during the post-1958 period.&lt;ref&gt;Ellner and Miguel Tinker Salas, “The Venezuelan Exceptionalism Thesis: Separating Myth and Reality,” in Ellner and Tinker Salas (eds.), ''Venezuela: Hugo Chávez and the Decline of an “Exceptional Democracy.”'' Lanham, MD, 2007, pp. 8-10.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, unlike Venezuelan President Hugo Chávez and many of his followers,&lt;ref&gt;Richard Gott, ''In the Shadow of the Liberator: Hugo Chávez and the Transformation of Venezuela.’’London, 2000, pp. 40-41. {{ISBN|1-85984-775-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ellner pointed to certain advances in the area of national development and social reforms, which according to him were reversed as a result of the implementation of neoliberal policies after 1989.&lt;ref&gt;Ellner, ''Rethinking Venezuelan Politics…,'' pp. 98-99.&lt;/ref&gt; Other writers in the 1990s also analyzed “Venezuelan exceptionalism” from distinct perspectives.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel H. Levine, “Goodbye to Venezuelan Exceptionalism.” ''Journal of Interamerican Studies and World Affairs'', vol. 36, no. 4 (Winter, 1994), pp. 145-182.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Terry Lynn Karl, ''The Paradox of Plenty: Oil Booms and Petro-States.'' Berkeley, CA, 1997. {{ISBN|0-520-07168-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the election of [[Hugo Chávez]] in 1998, Ellner specialized in the Chavista government and movement. In his ''Rethinking Venezuelan Politics'', Ellner draws on the thesis of British historian [[E.P. Thompson]]&lt;ref&gt;E.P. Thompson, ''The Making of the English Working Class’’. New York, Vintage Books, 1966. {{ISBN|978-0394703220}}&lt;/ref&gt; that the banners of political struggles defeated at a given historical moment often resurface many years later in revised form.&lt;ref&gt;Ellner,''Rethinking Venezuelan Politics…,'' p. 223.&lt;/ref&gt; Ellner traces struggles in Venezuela from the colonial period to the present and argues that grasping the importance of these experiences is essential in order to understand the Chávez phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;Kim Scipes, Review of ''Rethinking Venezuelan Politics''. MRZINE (Monthly Review), August 17, 2008. http://mrzine.monthlyreview.org/2008/scipes170708.html&lt;/ref&gt; Previously, Ellner had argued that the first half of the twentieth century was characterized by an important degree of historical continuity in spite of the major regime changes that took place during the period.&lt;ref&gt;Ellner, “Venezuelan Revisionist Political History, 1908-1958: New Motives and Criteria for Analyzing the Past.” ''Latin American Research Review'', vol. 30, no. 2, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;

Just as he highlighted issues of substance in his analysis of party factionalism in Venezuela, Ellner argued that concrete socio-economic policies, more than Chávez’s style, accounted for the political tensions that led to the coup of April 2002.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Di John, ''From Windfall to Curse? Oil and Industrialization in Venezuela, 1920 to the Present.'' University Park, PA, 2009, p. 127. {{ISBN|978-0-271-03553-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the concluding chapter of ''Rethinking Venezuelan Politics'', Ellner wrote: “The cause-and-effect relationship between popular and nationalist measures of an economic nature, on the one hand, and the… reaction of privileged sectors, on the other hand, was anything but subtle.”&lt;ref&gt;Ellner, ''Rethinking Venezuelan Politics…,'' p. 216.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sujatha Fernandes, ''Who Can Stop the Drums? Urban Social Movements in Chávez’s Venezuela.'' Durham NC, 2010, p. 3. {{ISBN|978-0-8223-4677-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[George Ciccariello-Maher]], ''We Created Chávez: A People’s History of the Venezuelan Revolution.'' Durham N.C., 2013, pp. 180-181. {{ISBN|978-0-8223-5439-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another thesis in his works on the presidencies of Chávez and his successor [[Nicolás Maduro]] concerns the challenges facing the government due to conflicting demands, interests and visions of Chavistas of different class backgrounds.&lt;ref name=webb&gt;Jeffery R. Webber, “Where is Venezuela Going.” ''Against the Current,'' no. 144 (January–February 2010). http://www.solidarity-us.org/node/2619.&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, Ellner points to three social groups with a following within the Chavista movement: the organized working class, the middle class and the “marginalized and semi-marginalized sectors” consisting of members of the informal economy, workers in firms with less than about ten employees and much of the rural work force.&lt;ref name=webb/&gt; An additional aspect of the complexity of the Chávez phenomenon is the movement’s ties with an emerging bourgeoisie&lt;ref&gt;Evaristo Marcano, “Interview with Steve Ellner: Can a Country have a Revolutionary State and a Capitalist Economy?” in ''Venezuelanalysis'' (April 20, 2014).  http://venezuelanalysis.com/analysis/10627&lt;/ref&gt; that are designed to undermine the power of the [[Venezuelan Federation of Chambers of Commerce]] (FEDECAMARAS), which spearheaded two attempts to topple the Chávez government in 2002-2003.&lt;ref&gt;Nicolas Kozloff, ''Hugo Chávez: Oil, Politics, and the Challenge to the U.S.'' New York, 2006, p. 70. {{ISBN|978-1-4039-8409-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Ellner suggests that the establishment of these links, while understandable from political and economic viewpoints, is conducive to unethical conduct.&lt;ref&gt;Ellner, “Venezuela: Chavistas Debate the Pace of Change.” ''NACLA: Report on the Americas,'' vol 47, no. 1 (Spring 2014), p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

In stressing the importance of the internal diversity of a socialist movement that rejects the orthodox Marxist notion of the primacy of the proletariat, Ellner is admittedly influenced by the theories of [[Ernesto Laclau]],&lt;ref&gt;Ellner, “Revolutionary and Non-Revolutionary Paths of Radical Populism: Directions of the Chavista Movement in Venezuela.” ''Science &amp; Society'', vol. 69, no. 2 (April 2005)&lt;/ref&gt; who has been referred to as a “post Marxist.” &lt;ref&gt;Philip Goldstein, ''Post-Marxist Theory: An Introduction''. Albany, New York, 2005, pp. 53-65. {{ISBN|079146301X}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his edited ''Latin America’s Radical Left'', Ellner and other authors examine the complexity and heterogeneity of the twenty-first century Latin American left in power throughout the continent.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Burbach, "The Radical Left's Turbulent Transitions: An Overview," in Ellner (editor),''Latin America’s Radical Left: Challenges and Complexities of Political Power in the Twenty-First Century''. Lanham, MD, 2014, pp. 38-40. {{ISBN|978-1-4422-2949-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a Historical Materialism article titled “Implications of Marxist State Theory and How They Play Out in Venezuela” &lt;ref&gt;Steve Ellner, “Implications of Marxist State Theory and How They Play Out in Venezuela.” ‘‘Historical Materialism’’, no. 2, 2017.  https://venezuelanalysis.com/analysis/13386&lt;/ref&gt; and elsewhere, Ellner explores theoretical dimensions of the class policies of the Chavista governments. These included populist initiatives favoring non-privileged sectors and pragmatic ones designed to win over or neutralize businesspeople. By implementing them, the Chavista leaders appeared to backtrack from stated goals.

Ellner goes on to argue that issues regarding the state in capitalist societies raised in the debate between Nicos Poulantzas and Ralph Miliband in Europe in the early 1970s  &lt;ref&gt;Ralph Miliband, “Poulantzas and the Capitalist State. ‘‘New Left Review’’, November–December 1973. https://newleftreview.org/I/82/ralph-miliband-poulantzas-and-the-capitalist-state&lt;/ref&gt; shed light on the relationship between the state and social classes in Venezuela and the predicaments facing Chavista governments. Three issues in particular stand out: whether the bourgeoisie (or sectors of it) displays a sense of “class-consciousness”; the viability of tactical and strategic alliances between the left and groups linked to the capitalist structure; and whether democratic socialism is to be achieved through stages, abrupt revolutionary changes, or ongoing state radicalization over a period of time. According to Ellner, Poulantzas’s concept of the state as a “strategic battlefield” &lt;ref&gt;Nicos Poulantzas, ‘‘State, Power, Socialism’’. London: New Left Books, 1978, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; lends itself to the strategy of the gradual radicalization of the state, which was advocated by some who were close to Chávez and Maduro and which was embodied in the term “process of change” (‘‘proceso de cambio’’).

[[File:Stiftung Ettersberg.jpg|thumb|Stiftung Ettersberg]]
The '''Stiftung Ettersberg''' is legally established foundation, located in [[Weimar]], Germany. It is mission is the comparative study of European dictatorships and their transition to democracy.

== History ==
The idea for the creation of the Stiftung Ettersberg goes back to the Spanish writer and dramatist [[Jorge Semprún]]. As a former prisoner of [[Buchenwald Concentration Camp]] he suggested in 1994, on the occasion of the Friedenspreis des Deutschen Buchhandels (peace prize of the German booktrade) award, to make use of the Ettersberg, on which Buchenwald Concentration Camp and afterwards the Soviet Special Camp No. 2 had been set up, as a point of reference symbolizing Germany’s double experience of dictatorship. He encouraged to take advantage of it with a European perspective in order to further the idea of democratic development in Central and Eastern Europe and of a European integration.
The then minister-president of Thuringia, Dr [[Bernhard Vogel]], took up this idea. On his initiative the Thuringian state government established the Stiftung Ettersberg, located in Weimar, in spring 2002 and the appointment of the executive board and the advisory council of the foundation.

== Mission ==
The foundation is devoted to the comparative study of European [[dictatorship]]s in the 20th century as well as their democratic transition. Its object is to contribute to the historical coming to terms with and the comparative analysis of dictatorships of fascist, national socialist and communist provenance as well as authoritarian regimes; it is to elucidate their mechanisms of rule and their driving forces. Moreover, it is dedicated to reveal the significance of opposition and resistance against authoritarian and totalitarian suppression and it keeps alive the memory of the victims of dictatorial violence. Besides, it is concerned with the problems of “coping” with the past and questions of transition from dictatorship to democracy as well as the stability conditions of liberal democracies.
Accordingly, it is the task of the Stiftung Ettersberg to prospectively pursue historical research which does not only perform work of memory but goes beyond this by making successive generations sensitive for the latent danger to freedom and democracy. The Stiftung Ettersberg attempts to foster the international and interdisciplinary dialogue between political scholars, historians, and researchers in the field of social and cultural studies in Europe. It endeavours to disseminate national experiences internationally and thereby to make a contribution to the stabilisation of liberal democracy throughout Europe. It also aims at being a platform of international encounters, reflection, remembrance, encouragement and last but not least of a critical analysis of contemporary developments.

From a European angle, the Stiftung Ettersberg organises international symposia, scientific conferences and colloquia, of which the results are issued in our own publication serial. In [[Thuringia]], in the heart of Europe, the foundation promotes the dialogue between prolific university institutes, scientific and pedagogical institutions and other initiatives that operate in the field of dictatorship research and democratic transition processes. It organises exhibitions and initiates competitions for students on issues such as experience of dictatorship, stabilisation and endangering of democracy.

'''Student-centered learning''', also known as '''learner-centered education''', broadly encompasses methods of [[teaching]] that shift the focus of instruction from the [[teacher]] to the [[student]]. In original usage, student-centered learning aims to develop learner autonomy and independence &lt;ref&gt;Jones, Leo. (2007). The Student-Centered Classroom. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; by putting responsibility for the learning path in the hands of students by imparting them with skills and basis on how to learn a specific subject and schemata required to measure up to the specific performance requirement.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, C. R. (1983). Freedom to Learn for the 80's. New York: Charles E. Merrill Publishing Company, A Bell &amp; Howell Company.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pedersen, S., &amp; Liu, M. (2003). Teachers’ beliefs about issues in the implementation of a student-centered learning environment. Educational Technology Research and Development, 51(2), 57-76.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hannafin"&gt;Hannafin, M. J., &amp; Hannafin, K. M. (2010).

In Learning and instruction in the digital age (pp. 11-23). Springer US.&lt;/ref&gt; Student-centered instruction focuses on skills and practices that enable [[lifelong learning]] and independent problem-solving.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Teaching Nursing: Developing a Student-centered Learning Environment|page= 5

|first1=Lynne E.|last1=Young|first2=Barbara L. |last2=Paterson |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Student-centered learning theory and practice are based on the [[Constructivism (philosophy of education)|constructivist learning theory]] that emphasizes the learner's critical role in constructing meaning from new information and prior experience.

Student-centered learning puts students' interests first, acknowledging [[student voice]] as central to the learning experience.  In a student-centered [[learning space]], students choose what they will learn, how they will learn, and how they will assess their own learning.&lt;ref name="hannafin"/&gt; This is in contrast to [[traditional education]], also dubbed "teacher-centered learning", which situates the teacher as the primarily "active" role while students take a more "passive", receptive role. In a teacher-centered classroom, teachers choose what the students will learn, how the students will learn, and how the students will be assessed on their learning.  In contrast, student-centered learning requires students to be active, responsible participants in their own learning and with their own pace of learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Student Centered Classroom: Vol 1: Social Studies and History|page=19
|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=1317919491|isbn=1317919491
|first=Eli|last=Johnson|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Usage of the term "student-centered learning" may also simply refer to educational mindsets or instructional methods that recognize individual differences in learners.&lt;ref&gt;Student-Centered Learning. (2014). Education Reform Glossary. http://edglossary.org/student-centered-learning/&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, student-centered learning emphasizes each student's interests, abilities, and learning styles, placing the teacher as a facilitator of learning for individuals rather than for the class as a whole.

==Background==
&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:Carlrogers.jpg|thumb|Student-centered learning theorist Carl Rogers]] --&gt;
Theorists like [[John Dewey]], [[Jean Piaget]] and [[Lev Vygotsky]], whose collective work focused on how students learn, have informed the move to student-centered learning. [[Carl Rogers]]' ideas about the formation of the individual also contributed to student-centered learning. Rogers wrote that "the only learning which significantly influences behavior [and education] is self discovered".&lt;ref name="Kraft, R. G. 1994 Pg. 41"&gt;Kraft, R. G. (1994). Bike riding and the art of learning. In L. B. Barnes, C. Roland Christensen, &amp; A. J. Hansen (Eds.), Teaching and the case method. Boston: Harvard Business School Press, Pg. 41&lt;/ref&gt; [[Maria Montessori]] was also a forerunner of student-centered learning, where preschool children learn through independent self-directed interaction with previously presented activities.

[[Self-determination theory]] focuses on the degree to which an individual’s behavior is self-motivated and 'self-determined'. When students are given the opportunity to gauge their learning, learning becomes an incentive.

Student-centered learning means inverting the traditional teacher-centered understanding of the learning process and putting students at the centre of the learning process.  In the ''teacher-centered'' classroom, teachers are the primary source for knowledge. On the other hand, in ''student-centered'' classrooms, active learning is strongly encouraged.  Armstrong (2012) claimed that "traditional education ignores or suppresses learner responsibility".{{sfn|Armstrong|2012|p=2}}

A further distinction from a teacher-centered classroom to that of a student-centered classroom is when the teacher acts as a [[facilitator]], as opposed to instructor. In essence, the teacher’s goal in the learning process is to guide students into making new interpretations of the learning material, thereby 'experiencing' content, reaffirming Rogers' notion that "significant learning is acquired through doing".&lt;ref name="Kraft, R. G. 1994 Pg. 41"/&gt;

Through peer-to-peer interaction, collaborative thinking can lead to an abundance of knowledge.  In placing a teacher closer to a peer level, knowledge and learning is enhanced, benefitting the student and classroom overall. According to [[Lev Vygotsky]]'s theory of the [[zone of proximal development]] (ZPD), students typically learn vicariously through one another. [[Instructional scaffolding|Scaffolding]] is important when fostering independent thinking skills. Vygotsky proclaims, "Learning which is oriented toward developmental levels that have already been reached is ineffective from the viewpoint of the child's overall development. It does not aim for a new stage of the developmental process but rather lags behind this process."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mind in Society|page=89

==Student-centered assessment==
One of the most critical differences between student-centered learning and teacher-centered learning is in assessment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pedagogies for Student-Centered Learning: Online and On-Ground
|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=1451489536|isbn=1451489536
|first=Cari|last= Crumly|year=2014|page=26|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Student-centered learning typically involves more [[formative assessment]] and less [[summative assessment]] than teacher-centered learning.{{sfn|Crumly|2014|p=26}}  In student-centered learning, students participate in the evaluation of their learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Technological Change and Societal Growth: Analyzing the Future|page=182

|editor-last=Coakes|editor-first=Elayne |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that students are involved in deciding how to demonstrate their learning. Developing assessment that supports learning and motivation is essential to the success of student-centered approaches.

==Application to higher education==
[[File:Shimer College class discussion 1967.jpg|thumb|A student-centered class at [[Shimer College]]]]

Student-centered [[learning environment]]s have been shown to be effective in higher education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=International Journal of Teaching and Learning in Higher Education

A research university in [[Hong Kong]] sought to promote student-centered learning across the entire university by employing the following methods:{{sfn|Kember|2009|pp=10,12}}
* Analysis of good practice by award-winning teachers, in all faculties, to show how they made use of active forms of student learning.
* Subsequent use of the analysis to promote wider use of good practice.
* A compulsory teacher training course for new junior teachers, which encouraged student-centered learning.
* Projects funded through teaching development grants, of which 16 were concerned with the introduction of active learning experiences.
* A program-level quality enhancement initiative which utilized a student survey to identify strengths and potential areas for improvement.
* Development of a model of a broadly based teaching and learning environment influencing the development of generic capabilities to provide evidence of the need for an interactive learning environment.
* The introduction of program reviews as a quality assurance measure.

The success of this initiative was evaluated by surveying the students.  After two years, the mean ratings indicating the students' perception of the quality of the teaching and learning environment at the university all rose significantly.{{sfn|Kember|2009|p=12}} The study is one of many examining the process of implementing student-centered pedagogies in large institutions of higher education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|chapter=Time for Student-Centred Learning?|first1=K.|last1=Geven|first2=A.|last2=Attard

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3564">'''The Symbolic Globe''' is a monument, since November 1995 situated on the piazza of [[UNESCO]] in Paris, France, surrounded by the flags of all nations, pointing out that this is the headquarters of the international organization. The Symbolic Globe was originally conceived for the United Nations Summit on Social Development, March 1995.[http://www.iisd.ca/wssd95.html] During the Summit, it was built in the centre of Copenhagen by the delegates, who had come from every corner of the earth.

Transferred to the piazza of UNESCO in Paris, the Symbolic Globe was inaugurated on 7 November 1995 by [[Federico Mayor]].

==Appearance==
It is inspired by the logo of [[the United Nations]] and formed as a [[minimal structure]], fifteen meters in diameter. The idea was conceived by [[Erik Reitzel]], and the Danish Ministry of Culture financed its realization.

The word "symbol" comes from the old Greek ''symbolon'', which actually means sign or token. In ancient Greece, when friends separated, the host would break an object and give a piece of it to each guest. When they met again, each one would bring his/her fragment and put the object back together again. By recreating the object, they demonstrated their links of friendship as guests. This idea of sharing and friendship would then be perpetuated during the United Nations Summit in Copenhagen. The 10.000 delegates, originating from all the countries of the world, would each receive a ''symbolon'' enabling them to put together a lasting structure: the Symbolic Globe. It is probably the first time that the people of the world have worked together to erect a bearing structure and to experience the joy of constructing.

Erik Reitzel's experience with minimal structures was utilized, in particular his experience from building the external lift tower of la [[Grande Arche]] in Paris. A completely new building system had to be developed based on the use of special joints, rods, and bracing wires which are easy to mount, demount and transport. The development of the building system was a result of interaction between his research, education, and practice.

The greater part of the Symbolic Globe was made from a special sort of aluminium (type 7075) by contractor Emil Nielsen Smithy.

{{nihongo|'''''Theme Aquarium'''''|テーマ アクアリウム}} is a [[simulation video game]] published by [[Electronic Arts Square]], in which the player creates and controls a sea life [[Public aquarium|aquarium]]. It was originally released on 17 December 1998 for [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] only in [[Japan]].&lt;ref name=PSN&gt;"[http://www.gamefaqs.com/console/psx/data/574984.html ''Theme Aquarium'' Release Information for PlayStataion]" ''[[GameFAQs]]''. Retrieved December 29, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The game was later ported to [[Microsoft Windows]] under the name '''''Aquarium''''' and was released in [[Europe]].&lt;ref name=PC&gt;"[http://themeworld.simgames.net/aquarium/ ''Theme Aquarium'']" ''Theme World''. Retrieved December 29, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gameplay ==
The gameplay is very similar to the other games in the ''Theme'' series, and the graphics are similar to ''[[Theme Hospital]]''. In ''Theme Aquarium'', the player begins with an expanse of empty floor space and the task is to construct a maritime attraction for visitors which must be filled with interesting and appropriate creatures at the same time as dealing with all the attendant challenges of running a profitable business. There are two ways of getting fish and other sea life, either by buying them off sellers or by catching them yourself. Dolphin shows can also be created and serve as the star attraction of the aquarium. Staff must be hired to maintain the aquarium and also to take proper care and attention to the animals.

== Development ==
In a 1999 interview, [[Bullfrog Productions]] co-founder [[Les Edgar]] stated that ''Theme Aquarium'' was produced and tested in the United Kingdom, but implemented in Japan. His intention was to "cross barriers" between the United Kingdom and Japan, and produce a game suitable for both markets, as, due to the success of ''[[Theme Park (video game)|Theme Park]]'' and ''[[Populous (video game)|Populous]]'' in Japan, he thought Bullfrog were more successful than other companies in producing games that were successful there. He commented that it sold well in Japan, but would not in the United Kingdom, and that the idea of having the producers in the United Kingdom and the development team in Japan worked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|magazine=Edge|publisher=[[Future plc]]|ISSN=1350-1593|department=Audience|pages=120–125|issue=74|date=August 1999|title=An Audience With Les Edgar|location=Bath}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, Bullfrog programmer Jonty Barnes asked fourteen ex-colleagues about the game, none of whom were familiar with it, with one describing it as "one of those obscure titles", although he also stated that it was known that it was intended for a Japan-only release on the [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|magazine=[[Retro Gamer]]|publisher=[[Imagine Publishing]]|location=Bournemouth|ISSN=1742-3155|title=Revisiting Bullfrog: 25 Years On|pages=60–67|issue=110|date=December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other versions ==

=== Windows port ===
The game was originally intended to only be released in Japan, however Electronic Arts later developed an English version of the game.&lt;ref name="PC" /&gt; This version however was not to be on PlayStation, the game's original platform, but rather on Microsoft Windows. Not only was the English version on a different platform but it was also renamed. It was released simply as ''Aquarium'' on 15 December 2000&lt;ref name=EU&gt;"[http://uk.gamespot.com/pc/strategy/aquarium/similar.html?mode=versions ''Aquarium'' for PC – Release Summary]" ''[[GameSpot]]''. Retrieved December 29, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; only in Europe.

A "Collector's Edition" version was released a year later on 5 October 2001.&lt;ref name="EU" /&gt;

=== PlayStation Network release ===
''Theme Aquarium'' has been released as a [[List of PSone Classics (Japan)|PSone Classic]] in Japan, allowing it to be played on [[PlayStation 3]] and [[PlayStation Portable]]. It was released on 24 September 2009 and is available to download from the [[PlayStation Network]] store.&lt;ref name=JP&gt;"[http://www.jp.playstation.com/software/title/jp0006npjj00293_000000000000000001.html Software Catagloue – ''Theme Aquarium'']" ''PlayStation.com(Japan)''.

The  '''Ukrainian Free University''' ({{lang-ua|Український Вільний Університет}}, {{lang-de|Ukrainische Freie Universität}}, {{lang-la|Universitas Libera Ukrainensis}}) is a private graduate university located in [[Munich]], [[Germany]].

==History==
The Ukrainian Free University (UFU) was established in [[Vienna]], January 17, 1921.&lt;ref name= Bohachevsky-Chomiak &gt;Bohachevsky-Chomiak, Martha.  Feminists Despite Themselves: Women in Ukrainian Community Life, 1884-1939. Canadian Institute of Ukrainian Studies, University of Alberta, Edmonton, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|245}} The  idea to organize  a Ukrainian university-in-exile came from Ukrainian academics, some of  whom had held chairs at universities in the Russian and Austro-Hungarian Empires.&lt;ref name= Bohachevsky-Chomiak /&gt;{{rp|305}}  UFU was  transferred in the  fall of 1921 to Prague, Czechoslovakia.&lt;ref name=Ukrainian&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CU%5CK%5CUkrainianFreeUniversity.htm|title= Ukrainian Free University – Internet Encyclopedia of Ukraine }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The host government granted UFU full academic accreditation and provided the University with financial support. UFU received wide recognition during its Prague period for significant and productive teaching, research  and publications.&lt;ref name=Ukrainian&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CU%5CK%5CUkrainianFreeUniversity.htm|title= Ukrainian Free University – Internet Encyclopedia of Ukraine }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

After the  Second  World War, UFU established its seat in Munich, Germany.&lt;ref name="Subtelny, Orest. page 65"&gt;Subtelny, Orest. Ukrainians  in North America, An Illustrated History. University of Toronto Press, Toronto 1991, page 193.&lt;/ref&gt; The  September 16, 1950 Free State of Bavaria [[Ministerial decree]] guaranteed degree granting privileges. In the ensuing period various Bavarian university laws  and ministerial decrees reaffirmed  this academic  privilege. Federal German and Bavarian governmental financial support contributed towards worthwhile research, publishing and  teaching activities. The University became a recognized Western European scholarly  centre, specializing in the  study of Ukraine within the USSR and of Ukrainians in the diaspora. Emphasis  was  placed on the study of Ukrainian history, literature, culture, law and politics. German and  Bavarian financial aid ceased in the  years following Ukrainian independence, as it  was  assumed that patronage of the  University  would be assured by Ukraine.The Ukrainian Ministry of Education  recognized UFU doctoral  decrees in November 1992. To date, Ukrainian governmental funding have not materialized. Thus, since 2009, the Ukrainian Free  University relies entirely on its own resources.

Over the years, the University has evolved from a "university-in-exile" to a full-fledged, though highly specialized, European Union graduate school. Nevertheless, UFU has retained much of its remarkableness and  singularity. In its research and publishing  activities the University focuses primarily on Ukraine and things Ukrainian.

== Academic structures ==
The University has three academic structures. The Faculty of Ukrainian Studies concentrates on interdisciplinary Ukrainian studies . Culture, literature and history constitute the core of  Ukrainian studies.  The  Faculty of Philosophy houses the remaining humanitarian disciplines, such as philosophy, fine arts, music, teacher training and  religion.  The Faculty of Government and  Political Economy unites such social science disciplines as political science, economics and business, sociology, psychology and legal studies.&lt;ref name=Ukrainian&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CU%5CK%5CUkrainianFreeUniversity.htm|title= Ukrainian Free University – Internet Encyclopedia of Ukraine }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Academic programs ==
UFU is the only private university in the world which, while located outside of Ukraine, offers graduate programs of study in the social sciences and the humanities, primarily in Ukrainian language.  In fact, in order to be able to matriculate at UFU one must demonstrate fluency in Ukrainian.  Masters programs require two to three semesters of  course work, an MA  thesis and  an oral thesis  defense.  Doctoral programs stipulate three semesters of course work, a doctoral dissertation,  philosophy commprehensives and  an oral thesis  defense.Dissertations are normally written in Ukrainian.  In exceptional cases permission may be granted to  write in another language.  Winter Semester teaching period runs from early November to mid December and from the end of January until early March.  Summer Semester teaching period is from early May until the end of July.

Most UFU faculty members also hold simultaneously permanent academic positions at European Union, American, Canadian and Ukrainian institutions of higher learning.&lt;ref name=Ukrainian&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.encyclopediaofukraine.com/display.asp?linkpath=pages%5CU%5CK%5CUkrainianFreeUniversity.htm|title= Ukrainian Free University – Internet Encyclopedia of Ukraine }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Victor Saul Navasky''' (born  July 5, 1932) is an American journalist, editor and academic. He is publisher emeritus of ''[[The Nation]]'' and George T. Delacorte Professor Emeritus of Professional Practice in Magazine Journalism at [[Columbia University]]. He was editor of ''The Nation'' from 1978 until 1995 and its publisher and editorial director from 1995 to 2005. Navasky's book ''Naming Names'' (1980) is considered a definitive take on the [[Hollywood blacklist]]. For it he won a 1982 [[National Book Award for Nonfiction]].&lt;ref name=nba1982&gt;
[https://www.nationalbook.org/awards-prizes/national-book-awards-1982 "National Book Awards – 1982"]. [[National Book Foundation]]. Retrieved 2012-03-11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;
This was the [[List of winners of the National Book Award#General Nonfiction|award for paperback "General Nonfiction"]]. &lt;br&gt;From 1980 to 1983 in [[National Book Awards#History|National Book Awards history]] there were several nonfiction subcategories including General Nonfiction, with dual hardcover and paperback awards in most categories. Most of the paperback award-winners were reprints, including this one.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==

Navasky was born in New York City, the son of Esther (Goldberg) and Macy Navasky.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/29/books/chapters/0529-1st-navasky.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0&lt;/ref&gt; In 1946, when he was in the eighth grade, he helped to raise money for the [[Irgun Zvai Leumi]] — by passing a contribution basket at performances of [[Ben Hecht]]’s play, ''A Flag is Born''.&lt;ref&gt;Victor Navasky, "El Sid," ''Tablet Magazine,'' August 12, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

He is a graduate of [[Swarthmore College]] (1954), where he was elected to [[Phi Beta Kappa]] and received high honors in the social sciences. While serving in the [[United States Army]] from 1954 to 1956, he was stationed at [[Fort Richardson (Alaska)|Fort Richardson]] in [[Alaska]]. Following his discharge, he enrolled in [[Yale Law School]] on the [[GI Bill]] and received his [[LL.B.]] in 1959. While at Yale, he co-founded and edited the political satire magazine ''[[Monocle (satirical magazine)|Monocle]]''.

==Career==
Before joining ''The Nation,'' Navasky was an editor at ''The New York Times Magazine.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hamm|first=Theodore|author2=Williams Cole |title=Victor Navasky: A Life on the Left|journal=The Brooklyn Rail|date=August–September 2002|url=http://brooklynrail.org/2002/08/express/victor-navasky-a-life-on-the-left}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also wrote a monthly column about the publishing business ("In Cold Print") for the ''Times'' Book Review.

Navasky was named the editor of ''The Nation'' in 1978. In that forum, for many years, he was immortalized in [[Calvin Trillin]]'s Uncivil Liberties column as "the wily and parsimonious Victor S. Navasky," or "The W. &amp; P." for short.

In 1994, while on a year's leave of absence from ''The Nation'', he served first as a fellow at the [[Harvard Institute of Politics|Institute of Politics]] at [[Harvard University|Harvard]]'s [[Kennedy School of Government]] and then as a senior fellow at the [[Freedom Forum Media Studies Center]] at [[Columbia University]]. When he returned to ''The Nation'', he led a group of investors in buying the magazine, and became its publisher.

Navasky has also served as a [[Guggenheim Fellowship|Guggenheim]] Fellow, a visiting scholar at the [[Russell Sage Foundation]] and [[Ferris Visiting Professor of Journalism]] at [[Princeton University]]. He has taught at a number of colleges and universities and has contributed articles and reviews to numerous magazines and journals of opinion.

In addition to his ''Nation'' responsibilities, Navasky is also Director of the George T. Delacorte Center for Magazine Journalism at [[Columbia University]], a member of the Board of [[Independent Diplomat]], and a regular commentator on the public radio program [[Marketplace (radio program)|Marketplace]].

In 2005, Navasky was named chairman of the ''[[Columbia Journalism Review]]'' (CJR).  This appointment engendered some controversy; as Navasky's name did not appear on the masthead, critics on the political right saw this as hiding that, despite the magazine's purported lack of political bias, a "major left-wing polemicist is calling the shots at CJR without any mention on the masthead."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nysun.com/new-york/nation-publisher-navasky-takes-reins-of-cjr/14745/|title=Nation Publisher Navasky Takes Reins of CJR|accessdate=September 1, 2010 |author= |last=Gershman |first=Jacob |authorlink= |date=June 2, 2005 |work= |publisher=New York Sun |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Navasky received the [[George Polk Awards|George Polk Book Award]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brooklyn.liu.edu/polk/press/2005.html|title=George Polk Awards for Journalism press release|accessdate=November 15, 2006 |author= |last= |first= |authorlink= |work= |publisher=Long Island University |pages= |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; given annually by [[Long Island University]] to honor contributions to journalistic integrity and investigative reporting.  He serves on the boards of the [[Authors Guild]], [[International PEN]] and the [[Committee to Protect Journalists]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3452">'''Walter William Laird ''' (26 July 1920 &amp;ndash; 30 May 2002) was a major influence in the development of Latin American dancing in Britain after the [[Second World War]]. He was [[World Latin Dance Champions|World Professional Latin Dance Champion]] three times. He coached many successful dancers including [[Allan Tornsberg]], [[Vibeke Toft]], [[Espen Salberg]], [[Jukka Haapalainen]], [[Sirpa Suutari]] and [[Donnie Burns]],  [[Peter Maxwell]] &amp; [[Lynn Harman]] were amongst his first major champions and a couple on which much of his ultimate technique was developed. Laird was a Fellow and Examiner of the [[International Dance Teachers Association|IDTA]], and until 2000, he was Secretary (and later President) of the Ballroom Dancers' Federation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/aug/03/guardianobituaries.arts Guardian Obituary]&lt;/ref&gt;

Laird first danced with his sister Joan in the 1930s. His professional partner during the war and after was Andé Lyons (née Ashcroft, and subsequently Andé Tyrer). They met when Andé was sent to the [[Royal Aircraft Establishment]], [[Farnborough, Hampshire|Farnborough]] as a [[shorthand typist]]. One day she took dictation from Walter Laird, who was a scientist working there. At the end of the dictation, he asked her if she was keen on dancing. 

:"By this time, the Americans were in force in the area. Like most of the girls, I now knew how to [[Jitterbug|Jitter Bug]] (later called the [[Jive (dance)|Jive]]), and I was having a great time! My answer to him was that I loved dancing and that I was pretty good at it too! We made a date and to my horror it turned out Walter was a professional ballroom dancer. I soon realised that I was well out of my depth. However, Walter offered to teach me to dance properly as he thought that I had potential. So that was how my second career was born!" &lt;ref&gt;Dancing through the War years http://www.bbc.co.uk/ww2peopleswar/stories/66/a4165166.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

The Laird–Lyons partnership was entirely traditional ballroom dancing. Laird did not switch to Latin until some time after the war. Laird's three world championships (1962&amp;ndash;1964) were in partnership with Lorraine Reynolds (now Rohdin), known professionally as 'Lorraine'. Later Walter married Julie, who continues the dance school in South London. One of Laird's greatest achievements was his ''Technique of Latin dancing'', first published in 1961; further editions in 1964, 1972, 1977, 1983, 1988, 2003. Initially Laird followed the traditional descriptive format, but in 1972 edition he published the results of a major analysis of Latin dance, and used a tabular form, including a column for 'action used' to help definition. This edition was widely influential, and has since been accepted by many dance teacher organisations as a definitive work.&lt;ref&gt;Wainwright, Lyndon [1997] ''The story of British popular dance''. International Dance Publications, Brighton.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wendell Earl Dunn, Sr.''' (born October 5, 1894, near [[Summit, South Dakota]]; died July 26, 1965, [[Baltimore, Maryland]], age 70) was a noted educator, longtime principal of [[Forest Park High School (Maryland)|Forest Park High School]] in Baltimore (1935–1961), and President of the [[Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools]].&lt;ref&gt;Dunn And Ziefle To End Long Educational Careers. ''Baltimore Sun''. Jun 12, 1961; p 30&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early Years in South Dakota==
[[File:moncenaloissons.jpg|thumb|left|[[Moncena Dunn (inventor)|Moncena Dunn]], Lois Woodward Dunn, sons Wendell (right) and [[Everett Dunn|Everett]] (left) ca 1896]]
Wendell Dunn was the son of Moncena and Lois Woodward Dunn. [[Moncena Dunn (inventor)|Moncena Dunn]] (1867–1944) was a farmer, optometrist, and inventor of the patented Dunn Ballot (fraud-proof coupon ballot).&lt;ref&gt;US Patent number: 830979. Filing date: Jan 19, 1905. Issue date: Sep 1906. Title: Absentee balloting system. Inventor: Moncena Dunn&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wisconsin Man Has New Form of Ballot. Chicago Tribune. Aug 1, 1914&lt;/ref&gt; After a boyhood on a prairie homestead near [[Summit, South Dakota]], Wendell Dunn earned an A.B. in transportation from the [[University of Wisconsin]] in 1916. He helped pay his way through college playing professional baseball as a second baseman in the [[Illinois–Indiana–Iowa League|Three-I League]] and as a cornetist and violinist in musical ensembles. He began his career in education after serving in the Army in World War I, during which time he attended officers candidate school. His first school post was as a high school science teacher in [[Pierre, South Dakota]], from 1918 to 1919. During that time he supplemented his income by ghostwriting speeches for state legislators, sometimes penning remarks on both sides of a debate question. Dunn then served as superintendent of the [[Blunt, South Dakota]], school district for four years before beginning a seven-year tenure as principal of the [[Aberdeen, South Dakota]] Senior High School. From 1924 to 1930 he was a professor of economics and American history at the Black Hills Teachers College in [[Spearfish, South Dakota]]. In 1927 he earned his M.A. in education from the [[University of Wisconsin]]. He moved to Baltimore in 1931. He had studied during summer 1921 at the [[Johns Hopkins University]].&lt;ref&gt;Wendell E. Dunn, Former High School Principal, Dies. ''Baltimore Sun''. July 27, 1965, p40&lt;/ref&gt;

==Baltimore teaching career and later life==
Dunn served in the Baltimore City School System for 30 of the 43 years he was an educator. The head of numerous local and regional educational groups, he was a vice principal of [[Baltimore City College]] and principal of [[Patterson Senior High (Baltimore, Maryland)|Patterson Senior High]] before assuming the post at Forest Park in 1935. In 1938, he was elected president of the Maryland State Teachers' Association.&lt;ref&gt;''The School Executive'', Volume 58 – Page 33, 1938&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 25, 1955, Dunn was elected president of the [[Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools]], the first principal of a public high school to receive this honor. He was named by educators from New York, Maryland, New Jersey, Delaware and the District of Columbia at the opening session of the organization's sixty-ninth annual convention.&lt;ref&gt;Educators elect president.'' New York Times''. November 26, 1955.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dunn died July 26, 1965, after a long illness, four days after the death of his wife. He had made a lasting impression on the lives of many of his students. One wrote, &lt;blockquote&gt;Whatever the subject he touched upon, he seemed to go to its core. He spoke our language—with us, never down to us—raising us with his ease and flow of words to an understanding of the ethics and responsibilities that awaited us even as young adults. We are widely scattered today, but wherever we are, we hold the memory of a man who helped to give us direction, who earned the respect and esteem of his students, a mentor to thousands who stand a little straighter because of his guidance.&lt;ref&gt;Shirley Balser. Wendell E. Dunn. ''Baltimore Sun''. July 31, 1965 p 10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He was the brother of civil engineer [[Everett Dunn]].

'''Winifred Louise Ward''' (October 29, 1884{{En dash}}August 16, 1975) was a professor at [[Northwestern University]] most notable for having done significant work in the field of children's theatre and pioneering the idea of creative dramatics.

==Early life and education==
Winifred Louise Ward was born October 29, 1884 in [[Eldora, Iowa]], the youngest daughter of Frances Allena ''Dimmick'' and George W. Ward, a prominent Eldora lawyer. While growing up, she spent many summers in [[Washington, D.C.]], where she was afforded the opportunity to watch theatrical performances that influenced her throughout her career. She received her [[bachelor's degree]] in 1905 from Northwestern University, under the guidance of [[Northwestern University School of Communication#History|Robert McClean Cumnock]]. She then returned to her hometown where she directed plays until becoming a teacher of reading, drama and physical education in the public schools of Adrian, Michigan from 1908 to 1916. In 1918, after receiving her [[Ph.D.]] in [[Pedagogy|Education]] from the [[University of Chicago]], Ward accepted an appointment to the faculty of [[Northwestern University School of Communication|Northwestern’s School of Oratory]] ([[Communication studies|Communications]]). She remained at Northwestern for the rest of her long and distinguished career.&lt;ref name=NULib&gt;{{cite web|title=Guide to the Winifred Ward (1884-1975) Papers|url=http://findingaids.library.northwestern.edu/catalog/inu-ead-nua-archon-1144|website=Northwestern University Library|publisher=Northwestern University|accessdate=26 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TfC/&gt;

==The Mother of Creative Drama ==
Ward founded the field of [[Creative Drama]], a classroom teaching method that places a heavy emphasis on self-expression, literature appreciation, and proficiency in spoken [[English language|English]]. It is noted for having a complete lack of scripts. In her own words, "instead of memorizing set speeches and acting parts in the way the teacher directs, the children develop plays out of their own thoughts and imaginations and emotions".&lt;ref name=TfC&gt;{{cite web|title=Theater for Children |url=http://www.northwestern.edu/magazine/northwestern/winter2003/features/communication/sidebar1.htm |website=Northwestern Magazine |publisher=Northwestern University |accessdate=26 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When Winifred Ward first started working with Creative Drama, she used the phrase "Creative Dramatics" which is now less often used.

Winifred Ward is often dubbed the mother of creative drama; the “systematic approach to dramatic activity and learning.”&lt;ref name=Rosenberg&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rosenberg|first1=Helane S.|title=Creative drama and imagination : transforming ideas into action|date=1987|publisher=Holt, Rinehart, and Winston|location=New York|isbn=978-0030640513}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AATE Awards"/&gt;

In 1924, Ward was appointed supervisor of the newly created creative dramatics curricula of the Evanston Public Schools. The next year Ward founded The Children’s Theatre of Evanston, created with “double purpose of providing a worthy service to Evanston and giving the Speech students a laboratory in the study of theater for youth.”&lt;ref name=NULib/&gt; In 1944 she organized the first national Children’s Theater Conference, which later became the [[American Alliance for Theatre and Education]] (AATE).&lt;ref name="AATE Awards"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of American Alliance for Theatre and Education|url=http://www.aate.com/history|publisher=American Alliance for Theatre and Education|accessdate=26 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ward retired as an assistant professor from Northwestern in 1950.  For the next twenty years, she wrote, taught drama workshops around the country, and participated in numerous conferences and conventions related to her field. She died in [[Evanston, Illinois]] on August 16, 1975.

==Ward's philosophy==
Rooted in the [[progressive education]] movement of the 1930s, Ward sought to educate the whole child, with the notion that, “the child could achieve an understanding of self and society.”&lt;ref name=Rosenberg/&gt; Ward’s method emphasizes storytelling that grows from nonverbal movement and pantomime, eventually becoming dialogue and characterization and ultimately an integrated drama. Stories told from literature, popular culture, poems, and fairy tales are a hallmark of Ward’s work. Ward emphasized the study of characters as a vital phase for understanding multiple perspectives both in drama and in life. Her workshops often culminated in informal performances for invited guests. Ward believed that creative drama was one way to create productive members of a democratic society.

'''World Poetry Day''' is celebrated on 21 March, and was declared by [[UNESCO]] (the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization) in 1999. Its purpose is to promote the reading, writing, publishing and teaching of [[poetry]] throughout the world and, as the original UNESCO declaration says, to "give fresh recognition and impetus to national, regional and international poetry movements".

It was generally celebrated in October, but in the latter part of the 20th century the world community celebrated it on the 15th, the birthday of [[Virgil]], the Roman [[Epic poetry|epic poet]] and poet laureate under [[Augustan literature (ancient Rome)|Augustus]]. The tradition to keep an October date for national or international poetry day celebrations still holds in many countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.rcn.com/alana.interport/poetday.html 41 countries observed World Poetry Day on 15 October 1951. Ref. cited: The International Who's Who in Poetry 1978-79. Ernest Kay, Ed. International Biographical Council, Cambridge, England.]&lt;/ref&gt; The United Kingdom generally uses the first Thursday in October, which in 2018 falls on October 4,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalpoetryday.co.uk/ National Poetry Day, United Kingdom]&lt;/ref&gt; but elsewhere a different October, or even sometimes a November date, is celebrated.
