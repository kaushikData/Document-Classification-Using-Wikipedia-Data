==Plot==
Having recently witnessed the death of her husband from a neurological disease, Dr. Anne Turner is diagnosed with a near-identical illness and determines to end her life once her condition has reached a critical point.

With her family at logger heads, Anne must also face the fury of her best friend, whose opposing views bring them into direct conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00h62w9|title=A Short Stay in Switzerland - BBC One|website=BBC|accessdate=13 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Abāmūn of Tarnūt''' is a saint and was a [[martyr]] of the fourth-century [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Coptic Church]]. He is known only from his name being mentioned in the ''[[Synaxarion]]'' of Mikhail of Atrib (c.1240). His feast day is 3 August (27 [[Epip]]).

== Legend ==
Abāmūn was from the city of Tarnut. He came to [[Upper Egypt]], and was a witness to the persecution of Christians at that time. He presented himself to Arianus, the governor of [[Ansena]], as a Christian. The governor tortured Abāmūn through a variety of methods, including blows, nails in the body, iron combs, and stringing him up. Thereafter, Arianus sent Abāmūn to [[Alexandria]]. There, Abāmūn's example inspired a number of other Christians to accept [[martyr]]dom.

One of the others who was inspired by Abāmūn's example was a girl named Theophila. She criticized the governor and his allies, specifically including criticism of their [[idolatry]]. For this, she was cast into the fire. The fire did not harm her, however, so she was subsequently beheaded.

Abāmūn himself had his limbs cut off and was beheaded.

== Church of Saint Abamūn ==
The church of Saint Abamūn, while bearing his name, may not necessarily be devoted to Abāmūn of Tarnūt. There was another martyr of similar description who bore the same first name, and because the church only mentions a Christian name, it cannot be sure whether the church was dedicated to Abāmūn of Tarnūt or [[Abāmūn of Tukh]], who was also mentioned in the ''[[Synaxarion]]'' of Mikhail of Atrib. There is yet another Abamun, included in ''[[Les Martyrs d'Égypte]]'' by [[Hippolyte Delehaye]], who seems to be this individual, as he was stated to have been martyred in Alexandria.

'''Action theory''' (or '''theory of action''') is an area in [[philosophy]] concerned with [[Theory|theories]] about the processes [[Causality|causing]] [[Will (philosophy)|willful]] [[Motor system|human bodily movements]] of a more or less complex kind. This [[List of academic disciplines|area of thought]] involves epistemology, ethics, metaphysics, jurisprudence, and philosophy of mind, and has attracted the strong interest of philosophers ever since [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' (Third Book). With the advent of [[psychology]] and later [[neuroscience]], many theories of action are now subject to [[empirical test]]ing.

Philosophical action theory, or the '''philosophy of action''', should not be confused with [[sociological]] theories of [[social action]], such as the [[Action theory (sociology)|action theory]] established by [[Talcott Parsons]].

== Overview ==
Basic action theory typically describes action as behavior caused by an ''agent'' in a particular ''situation''. The agent's ''desires'' and ''beliefs'' (e.g. my wanting a glass of water and believing the clear liquid in the cup in front of me is water) lead to bodily behavior (e.g. reaching over for the glass). In the simple theory (see [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]]), the desire and belief jointly cause the action. [[Michael Bratman]] has raised problems for such a view and argued that we should take the concept of intention as basic and not analyzable into beliefs and desires.

In some theories a desire plus a belief about the means of satisfying that desire are always what is behind an action. Agents aim, in acting, to maximize the satisfaction of their desires. Such a theory of prospective rationality underlies much of [[economics]] and other [[social science]]s within the more sophisticated framework of [[rational choice]]. However, many theories of action argue that rationality extends far beyond calculating the best means to achieve one's ends. For instance, a belief that I ought to do X, in some theories, can directly cause me to do X without my having to want to do X (i.e. have a desire to do X). Rationality, in such theories, also involves responding correctly to the reasons an agent perceives, not just acting on wants.

While action theorists generally employ the language of [[causality]] in their theories of what the nature of action is, the issue of what causal determination comes to has been central to controversies about the nature of [[free will]].

Conceptual discussions also revolve around a precise definition of [[Action (philosophy)|action]] in philosophy. Scholars may disagree on which bodily movements fall under this category, e.g. whether thinking should be analysed as action, and how complex actions involving several steps to be taken and diverse intended consequences are to be summarised or decomposed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2204">'''Ark Megaforms''' (негуманоиды Ковчега) are a fictional alien race from the [[Noon Universe]] created by [[Boris and Arkady Strugatsky]]. Their homeworld is [[Ark (Noon Universe)|Ark]] (Ковчег), a planet officially discovered 2160 AD in the course of "Ark Project".

Ark Megaforms are mentioned only in one book - ''"[[Space Mowgli]]"''.

==Appearance==
No information on the appearance of Ark Megaforms has ever been recorded, although members of ER-2 group, the humans that discovered them, recall strange 600-meter-tall structures that appeared somewhere behind the mountains every time they tried to contact the Megaforms. They looked like colossal segmented (insect-like) antennas at 100-meter amplitude. No connection between these structures and Megaforms was ever confirmed.

==Technological Advancement==
No exact data available. It is assumed that the intellectual abilities of Megaforms surpass those of humans: megaforms were able to directly communicate with a human ([[List of minor Noon Universe characters#Semyonov, Pierre|Pierre "The Kid" Semyonov]]) and adapt his body to the harsh environment of their home planet.

==Background==
No data available. Apparently, the Megaforms are a so-called "closed civilization" which avoids contact with the entire outside world; probably that was the reason why they had completely cleared ("sterilized") the whole surface of the planet from all other living organisms.

==Ark Megaforms and Humans==
Megaforms directly contacted ER-2 explorer group led by [[Gennady Komov]] and demanded their immediate withdrawal from the planet Ark. No other direct contact was ever recorded. 

[[Minor personalities of the Noon Universe#Semyonov, Piere|Piere Semyonov]], better known under the nickname "Little One", was a son of Alexander Semyonov and Maria-Luisa Semyonova whose spaceship was shot down in 2147 by the [[Wanderers (Noon Universe)|Wanderers]]' guard satellite orbiting the Ark. It is unclear why Megaforms saved the boy. Later they used Pierre as their proxy in communication with the [[progressors]] visiting the planet.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3946">'''Computational irreducibility''' is one of the main ideas proposed by [[Stephen Wolfram]] in his book ''[[A New Kind of Science]]''.

==The idea==
Wolfram terms the inability to shortcut a program (e.g., a [[system]]), or otherwise describe its behavior in a simple way, "computational irreducibility". The [[empiricism|empirical]] [[fact]] is that the world of simple programs contains a great diversity of [[behavior]], but, because of [[undecidable problem|undecidability]], it is impossible to [[predict]] what they will do before essentially running them. The idea demonstrates that there are occurrences where theory's predictions are effectively not possible. Wolfram states several [[phenomena]] are normally computationally irreducible.

Computational irreducibility explains observed limitations of existing mainstream science. In cases of computational irreducibility, only observation and experiment can be used. Computational irreducibility may also provide a scientifically-based resolution for [[free will]].

==Implications==

* There is no easy theory for any behavior that seems [[Complexity|complex]].
* Complex behavior features can be captured with models that have simple underlying structures.
* An overall system's behavior based on simple structures can still exhibit behavior indescribable by reasonably "simple" laws.

==Analysis==

Israeli and Goldenfeld found that some less complex systems behaved simply and predictably (thus, they allowed [[approximation]]s). However, more complex systems were still computationally irreducible and unpredictable. It is unknown what conditions would allow complex phenomena to be described simply and predictably.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8540">'''Cranial electrotherapy stimulation''' ('''CES''') is a form of [[neurostimulation]] that delivers a small, pulsed, [[alternating current]] via electrodes on the head.&lt;ref name=Rosa2017&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rosa|first1=MA|last2=Lisanby|first2=SH|title=Somatic treatments for mood disorders.|journal=Neuropsychopharmacology|date=January 2012|volume=37|issue=1|pages=102–16|doi=10.1038/npp.2011.225|pmid=21976043|pmc=3238088}}&lt;/ref&gt; CES is used with the intention of treating a variety of conditions such as [[anxiety]], [[clinical depression|depression]] and [[insomnia]].&lt;ref name=Rosa2017/&gt; CES has been suggested as a possible treatment for [[headache]]s, [[fibromyalgia]], [[smoking cessation]], and opiate withdrawal,&lt;ref name=Rosa2017/&gt; but there is little evidence of effectiveness for many of these conditions and the evidence for use in acute [[depression (mood)|depression]] is not sufficient to justify it.&lt;ref name=Kavirajan/&gt;

==Medical uses==
A 2014 Cochrane review found insufficient evidence to determine whether or not CES with alternating current is safe and effective for treating depression.&lt;ref name=Kavirajan&gt;{{vcite2 journal |vauthors=Kavirajan HC, Lueck K, Chuang K |title=Alternating current cranial electrotherapy stimulation (CES) for depression |journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev |volume=7 |issue= |pages=CD010521 |year=2014 |pmid=25000907 |doi=10.1002/14651858.CD010521.pub2 |quote=Rigorous clinical trial evidence is lacking on the use of cranial electrotherapy stimulation (CES) in acute depression. Thus, at present, there is insufficient evidence on which to base decisions for using CES in treatment of acute depression}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2018 systematic review found that evidence is insufficient that CES has clinically important effects on fibromyalgia, headache, neuromusculoskeletal pain, degenerative joint pain, depression, or insomnia; low-strength evidence suggests modest benefit in patients with anxiety and depression.&lt;ref name="pmid29435567"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Shekelle PG, Cook IA, Miake-Lye IM, Booth MS, Beroes JM, Mak S| title=Benefits and Harms of Cranial Electrical Stimulation for Chronic Painful Conditions, Depression, Anxiety, and Insomnia: A Systematic Review. | journal=Ann Intern Med | year= 2018 | volume= 168 | issue= 6 | pages= 414-421 | pmid=29435567 | doi=10.7326/M17-1970 | pmc= | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&amp;tool=sumsearch.org/cite&amp;retmode=ref&amp;cmd=prlinks&amp;id=29435567  }} &lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Electrodes are placed on the ear lobes, maxilla-occipital junction, mastoid processes or temples.&lt;ref name =pscna&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kirsch|first1=DL|last2=Nichols|first2=F|title=Cranial electrotherapy stimulation for treatment of anxiety, depression, and insomnia.|journal=The Psychiatric clinics of North America|date=March 2013|volume=36|issue=1|pages=169–76|doi=10.1016/j.psc.2013.01.006|pmid=23538086}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the long history of CES, its underlying principles and mechanisms are still not clear.&lt;ref name=Rosa2017/&gt;

CES stimulation of 1 mA (milliampere) has shown to reach the thalamic area at a radius of 13.30&amp;nbsp;mm. CES has shown to induce changes in the electroencephalogram, increasing alpha relative power and decreasing relative power in delta and beta frequencies.&lt;ref name =pscna/&gt;{{Relevance inline|date=July 2016}}

CES has also shown to reach cortical and subcortical areas of the brain, in electromagnetic tomography and [[functional MRI]] studies.&lt;ref name =pscna/&gt; CES treatments have been found to induce changes in neurohormones and neurotransmitters that have been implicated in psychiatric disorders: substantial increases in beta endorphins, adrenocorticotrophic hormone, and serotonin; moderate increases in melatonin and norepinephrine, modest or unquantified increases in cholinesterase, gamma-aminobutyric acid, and dehydroepiandrosterone, and moderate reductions in cortisol.&lt;ref name =pscna/&gt;

==History==
Low intensity electrical stimulation is believed to have originated in the studies of galvanic currents in humans and animals as conducted by [[Giovanni Aldini]], [[Alessandro Volta]] and others in the 18th century. Aldini had experimented with galvanic head current as early as 1794 (upon himself) and reported the successful treatment of patients suffering from [[melancholia]] using [[Direct current|direct]] low-intensity currents in 1804.&lt;ref name=Zaghi&gt;Soroush Zaghi, Mariana Acar, Brittney  Hultgren, Paulo S. Boggio, and Felipe Fregni. "Noninvasive Brain Stimulation  with Low-Intensity Electrical Currents:  Putative Mechanisms of Action for Direct  and Alternating Current Stimulation." Neuroscientist. 2010 Jun;16(3):285-307 {{doi|10.1177/1073858409336227}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CES was initially studied for insomnia and called electrosleep therapy;&lt;ref&gt;Appel, C. P. (1972). Effect of electrosleep: Review of research. Goteborg Psychology Report, 2, 1-24&lt;/ref&gt; it is also known as cranial-electro stimulation&lt;ref&gt;Iwanovsky, A., &amp; Dodge, C. H. (1968). Electrosleep and electroanesthesia–theory and
clinical experience. Foreign Science Bulletin, 4 (2), 1-64&lt;/ref&gt;  and transcranial electrotherapy.&lt;ref name=Gibson&gt;Gibson TH, Donald E. O'Hair. Cranial application of low level transcranial  electrotherapy vs. relaxation instruction in anxious patients. American Journal of  Electromedicine. 1987;4(1):18-21&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to the rise of pharmaceutical treatments for depression, anxiety and insomnia, such as [[Prozac]] in the 1980s and [[Ambien]] in the 1990s, CES was not a well-known treatment for doctors and patients. During the mid-2000s, the combination of pharmaceutical brands becoming generic and Internet advertising caused CES devices to gain popularity. In 2011, the devices received media attention from the ''Wall Street Journal''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703779704576073762463762744|title=Using Electricity, Magnets for Mental Illness|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|date=January 11, 2011|accessdate=February 23, 2016|author=Melinda Beck}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulation==
In the United States, CES technology is classified by the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) as a Class III medical device and must be dispensed by or on the order of a licensed [[Health care provider|healthcare practitioner]], i.e., a  physician, psychiatrist, nurse practitioner, psychologist, physician assistant, or occupational therapist who has an appropriate electrotherapy license, dependent upon state regulations.&lt;ref name=Medscape&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/758820 |title= Electrical Stimulators Need High-Risk Rating, Says FDA Panel |author= Shelley A |date= February 17, 2012 |accessdate= February 21, 2015 |publisher= Medscape Medical News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States requires a prescription for CES devices from a licensed healthcare practitioner. The FDA says that there are 11 CES devices cleared for marketing in the United States.&lt;ref name=FDA_CFR&gt;[http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfCFR/CFRSearch.cfm?FR=882.5800 21CFR882.5800, Part 882 ("Neurological Devices")]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psychiatrictimes.com/neuropsychiatry/fda-panel-votes-curtail-cranial-electrotherapy-stimulators FDA Panel Votes to Curtail Cranial Electrotherapy Stimulators], Psychiatric Times&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2014, the FDA announced that it "has determined that there is sufficient information to establish special controls, and that these special controls, together with general controls, will provide a reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness for CES devices. In this action, FDA is withdrawing the proposed rule and proposed order to call for PMAs for CES devices. FDA plans to issue a proposed order in the future for the reclassification of the CES device into class II."&lt;ref name=FDA2014&gt;[https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2014/06/12/2014-13756/neurological-devices-withdrawal-of-proposed-effective-date-of-requirement-for-premarket-approval-for Neurological Devices; Withdrawal of Proposed Effective Date of Requirement for Premarket Approval for Cranial Electrotherapy Stimulator Devices], Federal Register&lt;/ref&gt;

It is often a community based role, aiming to help families cope with death through recognizing it as a natural and important part of life. The role can supplement and go beyond hospice. Practitioners perform a large variety of service, including but not limited to creating death plans, and providing spiritual, psychological, and social support before and just after death. Their role can also include more logistical activities, helping with services, planning funerals and memorial services, and guiding mourners in their rights and responsibilities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The presence of the role of a modern death midwife has been evolving in recent years, including a controversy over the regulation process for the position and the use of the term "midwife" as opposed to doula, and bills proposed to regulate the process and provide licenses for death doulas. The terms "End of Life Guide," "Home Funeral Guide" and "Celebrant" are also used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.homefuneralalliance.org/what-we-call-ourselves.html|title=National Home Funeral Alliance- What we call ourselves|last=|first=|date=|website=homefuneralalliance.org|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The field has also seen a significant rise in interest, especially in the organization INELDA, which trains hospitals along with individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/end-of-life-doulas_us_591cbce2e4b03b485cae51c2|title=A Growing Movement Of 'Death Doulas' Is Rethinking How We Die|last=Blumberg|first=Antonia|date=2017-06-05|work=Huffington Post|access-date=2017-12-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical role of death midwives ==

=== Women in burials ===
Women have long had a hand in handling the affairs of the deceased, especially in tasks in parallel with the [[natural burial]] movement. Historically, women have most often cared for the dead, doing the bulk of the preparation work for the burial. It was seen as part of the woman's role in a family to care for the deceased, just as she cared for the children and the sick. However, it was the rise of the practice of embalming and the [[funeral industry]] that pushed women out of the practice around the time of the Civil War.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://splinternews.com/the-death-midwife-women-were-the-original-undertakers-1793852178|title=The death midwife: Women were the original undertakers|last=Aran|first=Isha|work=Splinter|access-date=2017-11-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This traditional role of women in burials has given rise to the modern female-led death midwife movement. Many aim to reconnect people with historical death practices of caring for their own.  Death midwives promote family-led home-based care and empower families to take back the responsibility and privilege of bathing, dressing, and mourning loved ones in the privacy of their own homes. They also advise about alternatives to the industry standard of [[cremation]] or [[embalming]],&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; such as green or natural burial.

=== History of palliative care doulas in clinical medicine ===
The rise of death midwives is a relatively new movement, with private certification programs following the legacy of pilot programs in clinical care. One of the first movements was started out of New York in 2000, a volunteer program focused on pairing so-called "doulas" with terminally ill people. The program was funded by the Shira Ruskay Center of the Jewish Board of Family and Children's Services and [[Nyu medical center|NYU Medical Center]], and began pairing five volunteers with patients. The program was ultimately named "Doula to Accompany and Comfort." The volunteers went through training on both clinical and spiritual aspects,  including but not limited to the complexities of end of life health care, physical issues like incontinence and disorientation, and hope in the face of death.&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/01/25/nyregion/in-death-watch-for-stranger-becoming-a-friend-to-the-end.html|title=In Death Watch for Stranger, Becoming a Friend to the End|last=Kleinfield|first=N. R.|date=2004|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-11-20|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next major clinical implementation of the death doula methodology was at the [[Baylor College of Medicine|Baylor]] Supportive and Palliative Care Service and Clinical Ethics Committee shortly after the establishment of the New York program. Members of this department including palliative care nurses, chaplains, and therapists worked together to create a program with in consultation with the New York program. From there, a program involving a 6-week training program was formed to work hand in hand with clinical medicine, wherein doulas are referred by nurses, social workers, and therapists, and must be specifically ordered by the doctor. After being ordered, volunteer trained doulas are matched by the hospital's revered to individual cases. While the Doula to Accompany and Comfort program provided outpatient services as well as inpatient, the Baylor program is only for inpatients.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Corporon|first=Kathleen|date=October 2011|title=Comfort and caring at the end of life: Baylor's doula program|journal=Proceedings (Baylor University. Medical Center)|volume=24|issue=4|pages=318–319|issn=0899-8280|pmc=3205157|pmid=22046067}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal controversy ==

=== College of Midwives of British Columbia ===
There has been controversy over the label of "Death Midwife." The College of Midwives of British Columbia has called for death midwives to stop using the label of midwife, specifically with the Canadian Integrative Network for Death Education and Alternatives ([[CINDEA]]). The basis of the case is that Louise Aerts, the executive director of the College of Midwives, claims that the term "midwife" is specifically reserved for the traditional sense of the word in relation to birth. The Health Professions Act protects its usage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/college-of-midwives-death-midwives-1.3666406|title=The good (mid)wife? B.C. College of Midwives says 'death midwives' can't use title|work=CBC News|access-date=2017-11-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, the CINDEA website has recently added the following disclaimer to their website: "The role and practices of death midwives are frequently referred to on this website. Death midwives are not conventional midwives (who deal with birthing) or health professionals, nor are they registered with any of the Colleges of Midwives in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cindea.ca/|title=CINDEA|website=www.cindea.ca|access-date=2017-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;"

=== Senate Bill 796 ===
There is currently no national body that oversees certification requirements for death midwifery, and little regulation. In comparison, there are multiple regulatory bodies that ensure the education and practices of traditional midwives, such as The Nursing and Midwifery Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nmc.org.uk/|title=The Nursing &amp; Midwifery Council|website=www.nmc.org.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there have been a few measures to regulate and license the practice of being a death midwife. In 2009, Senator Vicki Walker from Oregon introduced SB 796. The bill aims to regulate "death care consultants," in other words, death midwives and related professions. After the bill passed in July, death doulas were required to be licensed by the Oregon Mortuary and Cemetery board. The test they must pass to gain a license covers Oregon and federal laws related to the care of dead bodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/radio/day6/episode-230-omar-khadr-gets-bail-mayweather-vs-pacquiao-death-doulas-and-more-1.3047873/death-midwives-help-families-cope-with-end-of-life-care-1.3047933|title=Death midwives help families cope with end-of-life care|work=CBC Radio|access-date=2017-11-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Responsibilities==
The role of a death midwife is to educate and empower families to exercise their innate right to care for their own dead. Death midwives or doulas "provide emotional, spiritual, and physical support at an intensely personal and crucial time. They assist people in finding meaning, creating a legacy project, and planning for how the last days will unfold. Doulas also guide and support loved ones through the last days of life and ease the suffering of grief in its early stages".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://inelda.org/|title=Home - INELDA|website=INELDA|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Death is a situation that no one can completely prepare for. Additionally, many people don't have much experience with people close to them dying.  Because of this, when it comes to the time to deal with dying there are a lot of questions and uncertainty. [[Pain management]] is only one part of [[End-of-life care|end of life care]]; another part, of equal or greater importance at the end of their life, is the psychological aspects,
including the management of close relationships.&lt;ref&gt;Steinhauser, K. E.&lt;/ref&gt; A doula's support can relieve stress and burdensome tasks from the family in order to provide care for the dying individual but also gives the individual psychological and emotional support in the process.

Although the specific responsibilities of a death doula vary from certification program to program, there are certain parallels through each. The services provided by a death doula can generally be broken down into two categories.

=== Information ===
* providing the family with information about a broad spectrum of end-of-life choices, including home funerals and natural burials
* providing the family with information about advance directives and other forms, especially those needed for home funerals

=== Support ===
* building a relationship with the terminally ill, and advocating for their needs and wishes
* providing spiritual and emotional support for the terminally ill and their family

Many people who become death midwives are “volunteers who feel strongly about creating a safe space." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baldwin|first=Paula K.|date=2017-04-26|title=Death Cafés: Death Doulas and Family Communication|url=http://www.mdpi.com/2076-328X/7/2/26|journal=Behavioral Sciences|language=en|volume=7|issue=2|pages=26|doi=10.3390/bs7020026|pmid=28445392|pmc=5485456}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are caring individuals who want to support patients in their end of life stages. Another reason people are attracted to this field is that “they want the contact, the involvement and they are drawn to the mission-making sure someone is not facing this [death process] alone”.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://modernloss.com/death-doula/|title=The Death Doula|date=2014-07-10|work=Modern Loss|access-date=2017-12-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; People who become death doulas are there because they want to help the family and the patient through the whole process, as a neutral third party.

== Certification ==
There are many private organizations that offer a certification program, including the non-profit A Sacred Passing,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.asacredpassing.com/about-us/|title=About A Sacred Passing - Death Doula Services &amp; Training|work=A Sacred Passing|access-date=2017-11-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; the funeral home Sacred Crossings,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sacredcrossings.com/the-art-of-death-midwifery/|title=The Art of Death Midwifery {{!}} Sacred Crossings|website=sacredcrossings.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond Hospice,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://beyondhospice.com/|title=Beyond Hospice|website=beyondhospice.com|access-date=2017-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Earth Traditions,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.earthtraditions.org/death-midwife/|title=Death Midwife Directory|website=Earth Traditions|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; non-profit INELDA, the International End of Life Doula Association,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://inelda.org/|title=home - INELDA|website=INELDA|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Quality of Life Care. The International End of Life Doula Association (INELDA) was founded in 2015. Their [[mission statement]] says they are “dedicated to bringing deeper meaning and greater comfort to dying people and loved ones in the last days of life”. They emphasize the need for a doula certification process to create a standard for the field. Anyone can become a death doula and training opportunities are offered internationally. The steps included for certification include hands-on work in the field with evaluations and exams to display sufficient knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;http://inelda.org&lt;/ref&gt;

Certification is not available in traditional educational environments; it usually is offered in shorter, paid training sessions. The Doula Program in New York is a volunteer organization that focuses on the relationship between the doula and the dying. Instead of certification, volunteers submit an application in a pool of around 300, and around 12 are admitted each cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.doulaprogram.org/about-us-program.php|title=Doula Program to Accompany &amp; Comfort - Program Description|website=www.doulaprogram.org|access-date=2017-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Public certification programs associated with hospitals and more closely tied with clinical care are restricted to a few pilot programs. These often involve training spanning multiple weeks similarly to the private programs, however, they are often more related to palliative care and putting the terminally ill patient in a more comfortable situation through clinical means and mental health counseling rather than focusing so much on the spiritual and emotional support aspect. These programs include Baylor University Medical Center's Support and Palliative Care Service's Doula to Accompany and Comfort Program, as well as [[New York University Medical Center's]] Department of Social Services nonsectarian volunteer doula program.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== "Doula" name derivation ==
The term Doula originally came from ancient Greece, where the term was used to define an individual as a servant or in some extreme cases, a slave. The term doula was more commonly used again in roughly the 1960s where it often defined an individual who assisted in the birthing process.  This individual was often a woman, one that not only helped during the birthing process but also provided support for women before and after the birth as well.  Recently the term Death Doula has been coined to refer to a trained person who provides a dying individual and their family with assistance and resources.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Associated fields ==

=== Hospice care ===
The role of a death midwife is consistent with the more holistic approach taken in hospice care. As a result, some hospitals and hospice centers that deal with end of life patients have had their own staff's counselors go through death doula training. This can be carried out through the organization International End of Life Doula Association (INELDA), which provides training sessions across four countries.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/end-of-life-doulas_us_591cbce2e4b03b485cae51c2|title=A Growing Movement Of 'Death Doulas' Is Rethinking How We Die|last=Blumberg|first=Antonia|date=2017-06-05|work=Huffington Post|access-date=2017-11-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Alternative death care movement ===
The death midwife phenomenon is associated with the "Death Positive" movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2018-03-24|title=Death-positive movement|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Death-positive_movement&amp;oldid=832240679|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has also been linked to increasing interest in alternative methods of dealing with remains, including green burials, conservation burials, and home burials.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt;  Death doulas are trained to have the knowledge to provide the family with after-life alternative death care options. A goal of many death doulas is to provide information about alternatives to cremation or conventional burial, such as natural or green burial, and "flameless cremation" or alkaline hydrolysis, which is legal in 14 states.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/alkaline-hydrolysis-an-eco-friendly-burial-technique-2017-8|title=People have started dissolving loved ones' dead bodies as a greener alternative to burying or cremating them|work=Business Insider|access-date=2018-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other environmentally sustainable methods of final disposition are being developed, including human composting, or "recomposition."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.recompose.life/|title=HOME|website=Recompose|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Distributed cognition''' is an approach to [[cognitive science]] research that deploys models of the extended mind (see, for example, the paper ''[[The Extended Mind]]'') by taking as the fundamental unit of analysis  "a collection of individuals and artifacts and their relations to each other in a particular work practice" &lt;ref&gt;Yvonne Rogers and Judi Ellis. [http://www.dourish.com/classes/ics234bs03/14-RogersEllis-DistCog.pdf Distributed Cognition: an alternative framework for analysing and explaining collaborative working]. Published in Journal of Information Technology, 1994, vol 9(2), 119-128.&lt;/ref&gt;. "DCog" is a specific approach to distributed cognition (distinct from other meanings&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s13164-013-0131-x |issn=1878-5158 |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=1–24 |last1=Michaelian |first1=Kourken |last2=Sutton |first2=John |title=Distributed Cognition and Memory Research: History and Current Directions |journal=Review of Philosophy and Psychology |accessdate=2015-11-22 |date=2013-02-20 |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13164-013-0131-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;) which takes a computational perspective towards goal-based activity systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Perry|first1=Mark|title=Some simple definitions in Distributed Cognition (DCog)|url=http://people.brunel.ac.uk/~cssrmjp/homefiles/home.html|accessdate=22 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dcog frameworks employed were originally developed in the mid-1980s by [[Edwin Hutchins]], who continues to be the leading pioneer and whose research is based at the University of California at San Diego.

Using insights from [[sociology]], [[cognitive science]], and the psychology of [[Vygotsky]] (cf. [[cultural-historical psychology]]) it emphasizes the ways that cognition is off-loaded into the environment through social and technological means. It is a framework for studying cognition rather than a type of cognition. This framework involves the coordination between individuals, artifacts and the environment. 
According to Zhang &amp; Norman (1994),&lt;ref&gt;Zhang, J. &amp; Norman, D.A. (1994) "[https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1207/s15516709cog1801_3 Representations in Distributed Cognitive Tasks]", Cognitive Science, 18, 87-122.&lt;/ref&gt;  the distributed cognition approach has three key components:
# [[Embodied cognition|Embodiment]] of information that is embedded in representations of interaction
# Coordination of [[Enactivism|enaction]] among [[embodied agent]]s
# Ecological contributions to a cognitive ecosystem

'Dcog' studies the "propagation of representational states across media" (Rogers and Ellis, ibid.). Mental content is considered to be non-reducible to individual cognition and is more properly understood as off-loaded and extended into the environment, where information is also made available to other agents (Heylighen, Heath, &amp; Overwalle, 2003). It is often understood as an approach in specific opposition to earlier and still prevalent "brain in a vat" models which ignore "situatedness, embodiment and enaction" as key to any cognitive act (Ibid.).

These representation-based frameworks consider distributed cognition as "a cognitive system whose structures and processes are distributed between internal and external representations, across a group of individuals, and across space and time" (Zhang and Patel, 2006). In general terms, they consider a distributed cognition system to have two components: internal and external representations. In their description, internal representations are knowledge and structure in individuals' minds while external representations are knowledge and structure in the external environment (Zhang, 1997b; Zhang and Norman, 1994).

DCog studies the ways that memories, facts, or knowledge is embedded in the objects, individuals, and tools in our environment. DCog is a useful approach for (re)designing the technologically mediated social aspects of cognition by putting emphasis on the individual and his/her environment, and the media channels with which people interact, either in order to communicate with each other, or socially coordinate to perform complex tasks. Distributed cognition views a system of cognition as a set of representations propagated through specific media, and models the interchange of information between these representational media. These representations can be either in the [[mental space]] of the participants or external representations available in the environment.

These interactions can be categorized into three distinct types of processes:  
# Cognitive processes may be distributed across the members of a social group.
# Cognitive processes may be distributed in the sense that the operation of the cognitive system involves coordination between internal and external (material or environmental) structure.
# Processes may be distributed through time in such a way that the products of earlier events can transform the nature of related events.

==Early research==
[[John Milton Roberts]] thought that [[social organization]] could be seen as cognition through a [[community]] {{Harv|Roberts|1964}}. He described the cognitive aspects of a society by looking at the present information and how it moves through the people in the society.

Daniel L. Schwartz (1978) proposed a distribution of cognition through culture and the distribution of beliefs across the members of a society.{{Citation needed|date=August 2013}}

In 1998, Mark Perry from [[Brunel University London]] explored the problems and the benefits brought by distributed cognition to "understanding the organisation of information within its contexts." He considered that distributed cognition draws from the [[information processing]] metaphor of cognitive science where a [[system]] is considered in terms of its inputs and outputs and tasks are decomposed into a [[problem space]] (Perry, 1998). He believed that information should be studied through the representation within the media or artifact that represents the information. Cognition is said to be "socially distributed" when it is applied to demonstrate how interpersonal processes can be used to coordinate activity within a social group.

In 1999, [[Gavriel Salomon]] stated that there were two classes of distributive cognition: shared cognition and off-loading{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}. Shared cognition is that which is shared among people through common activity such as conversation where there is a constant change of cognition based on the other person's responses. An example of off-loading would be using a calculator to do [[arithmetic]] or a creating a grocery list when going shopping. In that sense, the cognitive duties are off-loaded to a material object.

Later, John Sutton (2006)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1075/pc.14.2.05sut| volume = 14| issue = 2| pages = 235–247| last = Sutton| first = John| title = Distributed cognition: Domains and dimensions| journal = Pragmatics &amp; Cognition| date = 2006-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; defined five appropriate domains of investigation for research in Dcog:
# External cultural tools, artifacts, and symbol systems.
# Natural environmental resources.
# Interpersonal and social distribution or [[Instructional scaffolding|scaffolding]].
# Embodied capacities and skills.
# Internalized cognitive artifacts.

==Applications==
The application area of DCog is systems design and implementation in specific work environments. Its main method is [[field research]], going into the workplace and making rigorous observations, e.g. through capturing work performances with video, studying and coding the recorded activities using qualitative research methods to codify the various ways in which cognition is distributed in the local environment, through the social and technical systems with which the workers engage.

Distributed cognition as a theory of learning, i.e. one in which the development of knowledge is attributed to the system of thinking agents interacting dynamically with artifacts, has been widely applied in the field of [[distance education|distance learning]], especially in relation to [[computer-supported collaborative learning]] (CSCL) and other computer-supported learning tools. For example, in the field of teaching English Composition, Kevin LaGrandeur has argued that CSCL provides a source of common memory, collaborative space, and a cognitive artifact (tool to enhance cognition) that allows students to more easily build effective written compositions via explicit and implicit machine-human collaboration. Distributed cognition illustrates the process of interaction between people and technologies in order to determine how to best represent, store and provide access to digital resources and other artifacts.

[[Collaborative tagging]] on the [[World Wide Web]] is one of the most recent developments in technological support for distributed cognition. Beginning in 2004&lt;ref&gt;Mika,Peter.(2005)[http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.60.2861&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf] "Ontologies are us:
A united model of social networks and semantics" Referenced 20 March 2014&lt;/ref&gt; and quickly becoming a standard on websites, collaborative tagging allows users to upload or select materials (e.g. pictures, music files, texts, websites) and associate tags with these materials. Tags can be chosen freely, and are similar to keywords. Other users can then browse through tags; a click on a tag connects a user to similarly tagged materials. Tags furthermore enable [[tag cloud]]s, which graphically represent the popularity of tags, demonstrating co-occurrence relations between tags and thus jump from one tag to another.

Dcog has also been used to understand learning and communication in clinical settings and to obtain an integrated view of clinical workplace learning. It has been observed how medical actors use and connect gestural practices, along with visual and haptic structures of their own bodies and of artifacts such as technological instruments and computational devices. In so doing they co-construct complex, multimodal representations that go beyond the mental representations usually studied from a cognitive perspective of learning (Pimmer, Pachler &amp; Genewein, 2013).&lt;ref&gt;Pimmer, C., Pachler, N., &amp; Genewein, U. (2013) "Reframing Clinical Workplace Learning Using the Theory of Distributed Cognition". Academic Medicine, 88(9), 1239–1245.&lt;/ref&gt;

Distributed cognition can also be seen through cultures and communities. Learning certain habits or following certain traditions is seen as cognition distributed over a group of people. Exploring distributed cognition through community and culture is one way to understand how it may work.

With the new research that is emerging in this field, the overarching concept of distributed cognition enhances the understanding of interactions between individual human beings and artifacts such as technologies and machines, and complex external environments.{{Nonspecific|date=August 2013}} This concept has been applied to educational research in the areas of [[Distributed Leadership|distributed leadership]] and distributed instruction{{Nonspecific|date=November 2015}}.

==Metaphors and examples==
Distributed cognition is seen when using paper and pencil to do a complicated arithmetic problem. The person doing the problem may talk with a friend to clarify the problem, and then must write the partial answers on the paper in order to be able to keep track of all the steps in the calculation. In this example, the parts of distributed cognition are seen in:
* setting up the problem, in collaboration with another person,
* performing manipulation/arithmetic procedures, both in one's head and by writing down resulting partial answers.

The process of working out the answer requires not only the perception and thought of two people, it also requires the use of a tool (paper) to extend an individual's memory. So the intelligence is distributed, both between people, and a person and an object.

Another well-researched site for analyzing distributed cognition and applying the discovered insights towards the design of more optimal systems is aviation, where both cockpits and air traffic control environments have been studied as scenes that technologically and socially distribute cognition through systems of externalized representational media. It is not the cognitive performance and expertise of any one single person or machine that is important for the continued operation or the landing and takeoff of airplanes. The cognition is distributed over the personnel, sensors, and machinery both in the plane and on the ground, including but not limited to the controllers, pilots and crew as a whole&lt;ref&gt;Hutchins, E. (1995). How a Cockpit Remembers Its Speeds. Cognitive Science, 19(3), 265-288.&lt;/ref&gt;.

Hutchins also examined  another scene of distributed cognition within the context of navigating a US navy vessel.&lt;ref&gt;Caroll, J. M., (2003). HCI Models, Theories, and Frameworks: Toward a Multidisciplinary Science. Morgan Kaufmann.&lt;/ref&gt; In his book on USS Palau,&lt;ref&gt;Hutchins, E. (1995). [https://books.google.com/books?id=CGIaNc3F1MgC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Cognition in the wild]. Bradford: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; he explains in detail how distributed cognition is manifested through the interaction between crew members as they interpret, process, and transform information into various representational states in order to safely navigate the ship. In this functional unit, crew members (e.g. pelorus operators, bearing takers, plotters, and the ship's captain) play the role of actors who transform information into different representational states (i.e. triangulation, landmark sightings, bearings, and maps). In this context, navigation is embodied through the combined efforts of actors in the functional unit.

In his study on process, representation and taskworld, Mark Perry (1998) demonstrated how distributed cognition analysis can be conducted in a field study. His example was design analysis in [[Civil engineering]]. In this work, he showed how an information processing approach can be applied by carrying a detailed analysis of the background of the study - goals and resources, inputs and outputs, representations and processes, and transformational activity, "how information was transformed from the design drawings and site onto tables of measurements (different representations)" and then onto "a graphical representation" which provided a clearer demonstration of the relationship between the two data sets (Perry, 1998).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1752">An '''emergent algorithm''' is an [[algorithm]] that exhibits [[Emergence|emergent behavior]].  In essence an emergent algorithm implements a set of simple ''building block'' behaviors that when combined exhibit more complex behaviors.  One example of this is the implementation of [[Fuzzy logic|fuzzy]] motion controllers used to adapt robot movement in response to environmental obstacles.&lt;ref&gt;Emergent behaviors of a fuzzy sensory-motor controller evolved by genetic algorithm, Systems, Man, and Cybernetics, Part B: Cybernetics, IEEE Transactions on (Volume: 31, Issue: 6)&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''emergent algorithm''' has the following characteristics: {{dubious|date=May 2013}}

* it achieves predictable [[global effect]]s
* it does not require [[global visibility]]
* it does not assume any kind of [[centralized control]]
* it is self-stabilizing

Other examples of emergent algorithms and models include [[cellular automata]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference

'''Exobiology Radiation Assembly''' (ERA) was an experiment that investigated the biological effects of space radiation, on board the [[European Retrievable Carrier]] (EURECA), an unmanned 4.5 tonne satellite with a payload of 15 experiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/nmc/experimentDisplay.do?id=1992-049B-03 | title = Exobiology and Radiation Assembly (ERA) | accessdate = 2013-07-22 | date = 1992 | work = [[ESA]] | publisher = [[NASA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was an [[astrobiology]] mission developed by the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA).

It was launched 31 July 1992 by [[STS-46]] - ''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis]]'', and put into an orbit at an altitude of 508&amp;nbsp;km. EURECA was retrieved on 1 July 1993 by [[STS-57]]- ''[[Space Shuttle Endeavour]]'' and returned to Earth for further analysis.

==Objectives==
The general goal of the experiment was to study the response of dehydrated and metabolically dormant microorganisms (spores of ''[[Bacillus subtilis]]'', cells of ''[[Deinococcus radiodurans]]'', [[conidia]]l spores of ''[[Aspergillus|Aspergillus species]]'') and cellular constituents ([[plasmid]] [[DNA]], [[protein]]s, [[Purple membrane (microbiology)|purple membranes]], [[amino acid]]s, [[urea]]) to the extremely dehydrating conditions of outer space, in some cases in combination with irradiation by [[Ultraviolet|solar UV light]].&lt;ref name=Dose&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0273-1177(95)00280-R |title=ERA-experiment 'space biochemistry' |year=1995 |last1=Dose |first1=K. |last2=Bieger-Dose |first2=A. |last3=Dillmann |first3=R. |last4=Gill |first4=M. |last5=Kerz |first5=O. |last6=Klein |first6=A. |last7=Meinert |first7=H. |last8=Nawroth |first8=T. |last9=Risi |first9=S. |last10=Stridde |first10=C. |journal=Advances in Space Research |volume=16 |issue=8 |pages=119–29 |pmid=11542696|bibcode = 1995AdSpR..16..119D |display-authors=8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Results==
The Exobiology Radiation Assembly (ERA) provided information on the exposure of [[invertebrates]], [[microorganism]]s and [[Organic compound|organic molecules]] to long-term exposure to [[outer space]] conditions, such as ultraviolet (UV) radiation, [[cosmic radiation]] and [[Vacuum#Outer space|vacuum]].

[[Spore]]s of different strains of ''[[Bacillus subtilis]]'' and the ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' [[plasmid]] [[pUC19]] were exposed to selected conditions of space (space vacuum and/or defined wavebands and intensities of solar ultraviolet radiation). After the approximately 11 months lasting mission, their responses were studied in terms of survival, [[mutagenesis]] in the ''his'' (''B. subtilis'') or ''[[lac operon|lac]]'' [[Locus (genetics)|locus]] (pUC19), induction of [[DNA]] strand breaks, efficiency of [[DNA repair]] systems, and the role of external protective agents. The data were compared with those of a simultaneously running ground control experiment:&lt;ref name=Dose/&gt;&lt;ref name='Horneck'&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=11542695 |year=1995 |last1=Horneck |first1=G |last2=Eschweiler |first2=U |last3=Reitz |first3=G |last4=Wehner |first4=J |last5=Willimek |first5=R |last6=Strauch |first6=K |title=Biological responses to space: Results of the experiment 'Exobiological Unit' of ERA on EURECA I |volume=16 |issue=8 |pages=105–18 |journal=Advances in Space Research |doi=10.1016/0273-1177(95)00279-N|bibcode = 1995AdSpR..16..105H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*The survival of spores treated with the vacuum of space, however shielded against solar radiation, is substantially increased, if they are exposed in multilayers and/or in the presence of [[glucose]] as protective. 
*All spores in "artificial meteorites", i.e. embedded in [[clay]]s or simulated [[Martian soil]], are killed. 
*Vacuum treatment leads to an increase of [[mutation frequency]] in spores, but not in [[plasmid]] DNA. 
*Extraterrestrial solar [[ultraviolet]] radiation is [[mutagen]]ic, induces strand breaks in the DNA and reduces survival substantially. 
*Action [[spectroscopy]] confirms results of previous space experiments of a synergistic action of  [[Vacuum#Outer space|space vacuum]] and [[Ultraviolet|solar UV radiation]] with [[DNA]] being the critical target.
*The decrease in viability of the microorganisms could be correlated with the increase in [[DNA repair#DNA damage|DNA damage]]. 
*The purple membranes, amino acids and urea were not measurably affected by the dehydrating condition of open space, if sheltered from solar radiation. Plasmid DNA, however, suffered a significant amount of strand breaks under these conditions.&lt;ref name=Dose/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31337">An '''expression vector''', otherwise known as an '''expression construct''', is usually a [[plasmid]] or virus designed for [[gene expression]] in cells. The [[vector (molecular biology)|vector]] is used to introduce a specific [[gene]] into a target cell, and can commandeer the cell's mechanism for [[protein synthesis]] to produce the [[protein]] [[Genetic code|encoded]] by the gene.  Expression vectors are the basic tools in [[biotechnology]] for the [[protein production|production of proteins]].

The [[Vector (molecular biology)|vector]] is engineered to contain regulatory sequences that act as [[Enhancer (genetics)|enhancer]] and [[Promoter (biology)|promoter]] regions and lead to efficient transcription of the gene carried on the expression vector.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sci.sdsu.edu/~smaloy/MicrobialGenetics/topics/in-vitro-genetics/expression-vectors.html sci.sdsu.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of a well-designed expression vector is the efficient production of protein, and this may be achieved by the production of significant amount of stable [[messenger RNA]], which can then be [[Translation (biology)|translated]] into protein. The expression of a protein may be tightly controlled, and the protein is only produced in significant quantity when necessary through the use of an [[inducer]], in some systems however the protein may be expressed constitutively. ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' is commonly used as the host for [[protein production]], but other cell types may also be used. An example of the use of expression vector is the production of [[insulin]], which is used for medical treatments of [[diabetes]].

==Elements of expression vectors==

An expression vector has features that any [[Vector (molecular biology)|vector]] may have, such as an [[origin of replication]], a [[selectable marker]], and a suitable site for the insertion of a gene such as the [[multiple cloning site]]. The cloned gene may be transferred from a specialized [[cloning vectors|cloning vector]] to an expression vector, although it is possible to clone directly into an expression vector. The cloning process is normally performed in ''[[Escherichia coli (molecular biology)|Escherichia coli]]'', and vectors used for protein production in organisms other than ''E.coli'' may have, in addition to a suitable origin of replication for its propagation in ''E. coli'', elements that allow them to be maintained in another organism, and these vectors are called [[shuttle vector]]s.

===Elements for expression===
{{further information|Transcription (genetics)|Translation (biology)}}
An expression vector must have elements necessary for gene expression. These may include a [[Promoter (genetics)|promoter]], the correct translation initiation sequence such as a [[ribosomal binding site]] and [[start codon]], a [[termination codon]], and a [[Terminator (genetics)|transcription termination sequence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Principles of Gene Manipulation |chapter=Chapter 8: Expression E. coli of cloned DNA molecules |authors=RW Old, SB Primrose |publisher=Blackwell Scientific Publications }}&lt;/ref&gt; There are differences in the machinery for protein synthesis between prokaryotes and eukaryotes, therefore the expression vectors must have the elements for expression that is appropriate for the chosen host.  For example, prokaryotes expression vectors would have a [[Shine-Dalgarno sequence]] at its translation initiation site for the binding of ribosomes, while eukaryotes expression vectors would contain the [[Kozak consensus sequence]].

The [[Promoter (genetics)|promoter]] initiates the [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] and is therefore the point of control for the expression of the cloned gene. The promoters used in expression vector are normally [[Enzyme induction and inhibition|inducible]], meaning that protein synthesis is only initiated when required by the introduction of an [[inducer]] such as [[IPTG]]. Gene expression however may also be constitutive (i.e. protein is constantly expressed) in some expression vectors. Low level of constitutive protein synthesis may occur even in expression vectors with tightly controlled promoters.

===Protein tags===
{{main article|Protein tag}}
After the expression of the gene product, it is usually necessary to purify the expressed protein; however, separating the protein of interest from the great majority of proteins of the host cell can be a protracted process. To make this purification process easier, a [[Protein tag|purification tag]] may be added to the cloned gene. This tag could be [[Polyhistidine-tag|histidine (His) tag]], other marker peptides, or a [[fusion protein|fusion partners]] such as [[glutathione S-transferase]] or [[maltose-binding protein]]. Some of these fusion partners may also help to increase the solubility of some expressed proteins. Other fusion proteins such as [[green fluorescent protein]] may act as a [[reporter gene]] for the identification of successful cloned genes.

===Others===
The expression vector is [[transformation (genetics)|transformed]] or [[Transfection|transfected]] into the host cell for protein synthesis. Some expression vectors may have elements for transformation or the insertion of DNA into the host chromosome, for example the [[agrobacterium|''vir'' genes]] for [[Plant transformation vector|plant transformation]], and [[integrase]] sites for chromosomal integration .

Some vectors may include targeting sequence that may target the expressed protein to a specific location such as the [[periplasmic space]] of bacteria.

==Expression/Production systems==
Different organisms may be used to express a gene's target protein, and the expression vector used will therefore have elements specific for use in the particular organism. The most commonly used organism for [[protein production]] is the bacterium ''[[Escherichia coli]]''. However, not all proteins can be successfully expressed in ''E. coli'', or be expressed with the correct form of post-translational modifications such as glycosylations, and other systems may therefore be used.

===Bacterial===
[[File:pGEX-3X cloning vector.png|thumb|An example of a bacterial expression vector is the pGEX-3x plasmid]]
The expression host of choice for the expression of many proteins is ''Escherichia coli'' as the production of heterologous protein in ''E. coli'' is relatively simple and convenient, as well as being rapid and cheap. A large number of ''E. coli'' expression plasmids are also available for a wide variety of needs. Other bacteria used for protein production include ''[[Bacillus subtilis]]''.

Most heterologous proteins are expressed in the cytoplasm of ''E. coli''. However, not all proteins formed may be soluble in the cytoplasm, and incorrectly folded proteins formed in cytoplasm can form insoluble aggregates called [[inclusion bodies]]. Such insoluble proteins will require refolding, which can be an involved process and may not necessarily produce high yield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Methods in Enzymology |year= 2009 |volume= 463 |pages=259–82 |doi= 10.1016/S0076-6879(09)63017-2 |title=Refolding solubilized inclusion body proteins |author= Burgess RR |pmid=19892177}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proteins which have [[disulphide bonds]] are often not able to fold correctly due to the reducing environment in the cytoplasm which prevents such bond formation, and a possible solution is to target the protein to the [[periplasmic space]] by the use of an N-terminal [[Signal peptide|signal sequence]]. Another possibility is to manipulate the redox environment of the cytoplasm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=SHuffle, a novel Escherichia coli protein expression strain capable of correctly folding disulfide bonded proteins in its cytoplasm |authors=Julie Lobstein, Charlie A Emrich, Chris Jeans, Melinda Faulkner, Paul Riggs, and Mehmet Berkmen |journal=Microbial Cell Factory|date= 2012|volume= 11|page= 56 |pmc=3526497 |pmid=22569138 |doi=10.1186/1475-2859-11-56}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other more sophisticated systems are also being developed; such systems may allow for the expression of proteins previously thought impossible in ''E. coli'', such as [[glycosylated]] proteins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=N-linked glycosylation in Campylobacter jejuni and its functional transfer into E. coli |vauthors=Wacker M, Linton D, Hitchen PG, Nita-Lazar M, Haslam SM, North SJ, Panico M, Morris HR, Dell A, Wren BW, Aebi M |journal=Science |volume=298 |issue=5599 |pages=1790–1793 |year=2002 |pmid=12459590 |doi=10.1126/science.298.5599.1790}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Industrial production of recombinant therapeutics in Escherichia coli and its recent advancements |vauthors=Huang CJ, Lin H, Yang X |journal=J Ind Microbiol Biotechnol |volume=39 |issue=3 |pages=383–99 |year=2012 |pmid=22252444 |doi=10.1007/s10295-011-1082-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Recombinant protein expression in Escherichia coli: advances and challenges|authors=Germán L.

The promoters used for these vector are usually based on the promoter of the [[lac operon|''lac'' operon]] or the [[T7 phage|T7]] promoter,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dubendorff JW, Studier FW |title=Controlling basal expression in an inducible T7 expression system by blocking the target T7 promoter with lac repressor |journal=Journal of Molecular Biology |year=1991 |volume=219 |issue=1 |pages=45–59 |pmid=1902522 |doi=10.1016/0022-2836(91)90856-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they are normally regulated by the ''lac'' [[Operator (biology)|operator]]. These promoters may also be hybrids of different promoters, for example, the [[Tac-Promoter]] is a hybrid of [[trp operon|''trp'']] and ''lac'' promoters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=deBoer H. A., Comstock, L. J., Vasser, M. |year=1983|title= The tac promoter: a functional hybrid derived from trp and lac promoters |journal= Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA |volume=80 |pages=21–25 |pmid=6337371 |issue=1 |pmc=393301 |doi=10.1073/pnas.80.1.21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Note that most commonly used ''lac'' or ''lac''-derived promoters are based on the [[LacUV5|''lac''UV5]] mutant which is insensitive to [[catabolite repression]]. This mutant allows for expression of protein under the control of the ''lac'' promoter when the [[growth medium]] contains glucose since glucose would inhibit gene expression if wild-type ''lac'' promoter is used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Silverstone AE, Arditti RR, Magasanik B |title= Catabolite-insensitive revertants of lac promoter mutants |year=1970 |journal= Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA |volume=66 |issue=3 |pages=773–9 |pmid=4913210 |pmc=283117 |doi=10.1073/pnas.66.3.773}}&lt;/ref&gt; Presence of glucose nevertheless may still be used to reduce background expression through residual inhibition in some systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://wolfson.huji.ac.il/expression/procedures/bacterial/Glucose%20supression.pdf |title=Use of glucose to control basal expression in the pET System |author1=Robert Novy |author2=Barbara Morris |journal=inNovations |number=13 |pages=6–7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of ''E. coli'' expression vectors are the pGEX series of vectors where [[glutathione S-transferase]] is used as a fusion partner and gene expression is under the control of the tac promoter,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Single-step purification of polypeptides expressed in Escherichia coli as fusions with glutathione S-transferase |vauthors=Smith DB, Johnson KS |journal=Gene |year=1988 |volume=67|issue=1 |pages=31–40|pmid=3047011 |doi=10.1016/0378-1119(88)90005-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=GST Gene Fusion System |url=http://wolfson.huji.ac.il/purification/PDF/Tag_Protein_Purification/GST/PHARMACIA_GST_Gene_Fusion_System_Handbook.pdf |work=Amersham Pharmacia biotech }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gelifesciences.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/catalog/en/GELifeSciences/products/AlternativeProductStructure_16996/28954653 |title=pGEX Vectors |publisher= GE Healthcare Lifesciences }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the pET series of vectors which uses a [[T7 phage|T7]] promoter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=  http://lifeserv.bgu.ac.il/wb/zarivach/media/protocols/Novagen%20pET%20system%20manual.pdf |title=pET System manual |work=Novagen }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible to simultaneously express two or more different proteins in ''E. coli'' using different plasmids. However, when 2 or more plasmids are used, each plasmid needs to use a different antibiotic selection as well as a different origin of replication, otherwise one of the plasmids may not be stably maintained. Many commonly used plasmids are based on the [[ColE1]] replicon and are therefore incompatible with each other; in order for a ColE1-based plasmid to coexist with another in the same cell, the other would need to be of a different replicon, e.g. a p15A replicon-based plasmid such as the pACYC series of plasmids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=E. coli Plasmid Vectors: Methods and Applications |author1=Nicola Casali |author2=Andrew Preston |series = Methods in Molecular Biology|volume=Volume No.: 235 |page=22 |isbn=978-1-58829-151-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another approach would be to use a single two-cistron vector or design the coding sequences in tandem as a bi- or poly-cistronic construct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.embl.de/pepcore/pepcore_services/cloning/cloning_methods/dicistronic_cloning/index.html |title=Cloning Methods - Di- or multi-cistronic Cloning |work=EMBL }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Translation of a synthetic two-cistron mRNA in Escherichia coli |vauthors=Schoner BE, Belagaje RM, Schoner RG |journal= Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A |year=1986 |volume=83 |issue=22|pages=8506–10 |pmid= 3534891 |pmc=386959 |doi=10.1073/pnas.83.22.8506}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yeast===
A yeast commonly used for protein production is ''[[Pichia pastoris]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Recombinant protein expression in Pichia pastoris |vauthors=Cregg JM, Cereghino JL, Shi J, Higgins DR |journal=Molecular Biotechnology |year=2000 |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=23–52 |pmid= 11098467 |doi=10.1385/MB:16:1:23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of yeast expression vector in ''Pichia'' are the pPIC series of vectors, and these vectors use the [[AOX1]] promoter which is inducible with [[methanol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tools.invitrogen.com/content/sfs/brochures/B-067202_Pichia_Flyer.pdf |title=Pichia pastoris Expression System |work=Invitrogen }}&lt;/ref&gt; The plasmids may contain elements for insertion of foreign DNA into the yeast genome and signal sequence for the secretion of expressed protein. Proteins with disulphide bonds and glycosylation can be efficiently produced in yeast. Another yeast used for protein production is ''[[Kluyveromyces lactis]]'' and the gene is expressed, driven by a variant of the strong [[lactase]] LAC4 promoter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.neb.com/~/media/Catalog/All-Products/B1A99D5EBC6E45B3B876E40A8ECCED3F/Datacards%20or%20Manuals/manualE1000.pdf |title=K. lactis Protein Expression Kit |work=New England BioLabs Inc. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'' is particularly widely used for gene expression studies in yeast, for example in [[yeast two-hybrid system]] for the study of protein-protein interaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fields S, Song O |title=A novel genetic system to detect protein-protein interactions |journal=Nature |volume=340 |issue=6230 |pages=245–6 |year=1989 |pmid=2547163 |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v340/n6230/abs/340245a0.html
|doi=10.1038/340245a0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The vectors used in yeast two-hybrid system contain fusion partners for two cloned genes that allow the transcription of a reporter gene when there is interaction between the two proteins expressed from the cloned genes.

===Baculovirus===
[[Baculovirus]], a rod-shaped virus which infects insect cells, is used as the expression vector in this system. Insect cell lines derived from [[Lepidopteran]]s (moths and butterflies), such as ''[[Spodoptera frugiperda]]'', are used as host. A cell line derived from the [[cabbage looper]] is of particular interest, as it has been developed to grow fast and without the expensive serum normally needed to boost cell growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=HINK|first=W. F.|date=1970-05-02|title=Established Insect Cell Line from the Cabbage Looper, Trichoplusia ni|url=http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/226466b0|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=226|issue=5244|pages=466–467|doi=10.1038/226466b0|issn=1476-4687}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Zheng G-L, Zhou H-X, Li C-Y|date=2014|title= Serum-free culture of the suspension cell line QB-Tn9-4s of the cabbage looper, Trichoplusia ni, is highly productive for virus replication and recombinant protein expression|journal= Journal of Insect Science |volume=14|issue=1|page=24 |url= https://academic.oup.com/jinsectscience/article-lookup/doi/10.1093/jis/14.1.24 |pmid= 25373171 |doi=10.1093/jis/14.1.24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[shuttle vector]] is called bacmid, and gene expression is under the control of a strong promoter pPolh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tools.invitrogen.com/content/sfs/manuals/bevtest.pdf |title=Guide to Baculovirus Expression Vector Systems (BEVS) and Insect Cell Culture Techniques|work=Invitrogen }}&lt;/ref&gt; Baculovirus has also been used with mammalian cell lines in the [[BacMam]] system.&lt;ref name="Kost2002"/&gt;

Baculovirus is normally used for production of [[glycoproteins]], although the glycosylations may be different from those found in vertebrates. In general, it is safer to use than mammalian virus as it has a limited host range and does not infect vertebrates without modifications.

===Plant===
Many plant expression vectors are based on the [[Ti plasmid]] of ''[[Agrobacterium tumefaciens]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Techniques in plant molecular biology--progress and problems |vauthors=Walden R, Schell J |journal=European Journal of Biochemistry |year= 1990 |volume=192 |issue=3 |pages=563–76 |pmid= 2209611|doi=10.1111/j.1432-1033.1990.tb19262.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; In these expression vectors, DNA to be inserted into plant is cloned into the [[T-DNA Binary system|T-DNA]], a stretch of DNA flanked by a 25-bp direct repeat sequence at either end, and which can integrate into the plant genome. The T-DNA also contains the selectable marker. The ''Agrobacterium'' provides a mechanism for [[transformation (genetics)|transformation]], integration of into the plant genome, and the promoters for its ''vir'' genes may also be used for the cloned genes.  Concerns over the transfer of bacterial or viral genetic material into the plant however have led to the development of vectors called intragenic vectors whereby functional equivalents of plant genome are used so that there is no transfer of genetic material from an alien species into the plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mpc02lNJRs8C&amp;pg=PT629&amp;lpg=PT629#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Principles of Plant Genetics and Breeding|author= George Acquaah |date=16 August 2012|publisher= John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc |isbn=9781118313695 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plant viruses may be used as vectors since the ''Agrobacterium'' method does not work for all plants. Examples of plant virus used are the [[tobacco mosaic virus]] (TMV), [[potato virus X]], and [[cowpea mosaic virus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Use of viral vectors for vaccine production in plants |author1=M Carmen Cañizares |author2=Liz Nicholson |author3=George P Lomonossoff |journal=Immunology and Cell Biology |year=2005 |volume=83 |pages= 263–270 |doi=10.1111/j.1440-1711.2005.01339.x |pmid=15877604 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The protein may be expressed as a fusion to the coat protein of the virus and is displayed on the surface of assembled viral particles, or as an unfused protein that accumulates within the plant. Expression in plant using plant vectors is often constitutive,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=How Do You Make A Transgenic Plant? |url=http://cls.casa.colostate.edu/transgeniccrops/how.html |work=Department of Soil and Crop Sciences at Colorado State University }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a commonly used constitutive promoter in plant expression vectors is the [[cauliflower mosaic virus]] (CaMV) 35S promoter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Fütterer J. |author2=Bonneville J. M. |author3=Hohn T |title=Cauliflower mosaic virus as a gene expression vector for plants |journal=Physiologia Plantarum
|volume = 79 |issue = 1 |pages = 154–157 |date= May 1990 |doi= 10.1111/j.1399-3054.1990.tb05878.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Cauliflower Mosaic Virus 35S Promoter: Combinatorial Regulation of Transcription in Plants |vauthors=Benfey PN, Chua NH |journal=Science |year=1990 |volume=250|issue=4983 |pages=959–66 |pmid=17746920 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/site/feature/data/plants2001/PDFs/250-4983-959.pdf |doi=10.1126/science.250.4983.959}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mammalian===
Mammalian expression vectors offer considerable advantages for the expression of mammalian proteins over bacterial expression systems - proper folding, post-translational modifications, and relevant enzymatic activity. It may also be more desirable than other eukaryotic non-mammalian systems whereby the proteins expressed may not contain the correct glycosylations. It is of particular use in producing membrane-associating proteins that require chaperones for proper folding and stability as well as containing numerous post-translational modifications. The downside, however, is the low yield of product in comparison to prokaryotic vectors as well as the costly nature of the techniques involved. Its complicated technology, and potential contamination with animal viruses of mammalian cell expression have also placed a constraint on its use in large-scale industrial production.&lt;ref name="mammalian"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Gene Expression in Mammalian Cells and its Applications|author= Kishwar Hayat Khan |journal= Adv Pharm Bull. |year= 2013 |volume= 3 |issue=2 |pages= 257–263 |pmid=24312845 |pmc=3848218 | doi= 10.5681/apb.2013.042 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultured mammalian cell lines such as the [[Chinese hamster ovary cell|Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)]], [[COS cells|COS]], including human cell lines such as [[HEK cell|HEK]] and [[HeLa]] may be used to produce protein. Vectors are [[transfected]] into the cells and the DNA may be integrated into the genome by [[homologous recombination]] in the case of stable transfection, or the cells may be transiently transfected. Examples of mammalian expression vectors include the [[adenoviral]] vectors,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Current Topics in Microbiology and Immunology |year= 1992 |volume=158 |pages=39–66 |title=Expression of heterologous sequences in adenoviral vectors |author=Berkner KL |pmid=1582245 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the pSV and the pCMV series of plasmid vectors, [[vaccinia]] and [[retroviral]] vectors,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Clin Microbiol Rev |year=1990 |volume= 3 |issue=2|pages= 153–170 |pmc=358149|title=Vaccinia virus vectors: new strategies for producing recombinant vaccines |author=D E Hruby |pmid=2187593 |doi=10.1128/cmr.3.2.153}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as baculovirus.&lt;ref name="Kost2002"&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=11906750|doi=10.1016/S0167-7799(01)01911-4|title=Recombinant baculoviruses as mammalian cell gene-delivery vectors|year=2002|last1=Kost|first1=T|journal=Trends in Biotechnology|volume=20|issue=4|pages=173–180|last2=Condreay|first2=JP}}&lt;/ref&gt; The promoters for [[cytomegalovirus]] (CMV) and [[SV40]] are commonly used in mammalian expression vectors to drive gene expression. Non-viral promoter, such as the elongation factor (EF)-1 promoter, is also known.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Gene |year=1990 |volume=91 |issue=2 |pages=217–23 |title=Use of the human elongation factor 1 alpha promoter as a versatile and efficient expression system |author=Kim DW1, Uetsuki T, Kaziro Y, Yamaguchi N, Sugano S |pmid =2210382 |doi=10.1016/0378-1119(90)90091-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cell-free systems===
''E. coli'' [[cell lysate]] containing the cellular components required for transcription and translation are used in this ''in vitro'' method of protein production. The advantage of such system is that protein may be produced much faster than those produced ''in vivo'' since it does not require time to culture the cells, but it is also more expensive. Vectors used for ''E. coli'' expression can be used in this system although specifically designed vectors for this system are also available. Eukaryotic cell extracts may also be used in other cell-free systems, for example, the [[wheat germ]] cell-free expression systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Current Protocols in Protein Science |year= 2006 |chapter=Chapter 5:Unit 5.18. Wheat Germ Cell-Free Expression System for Protein Production |doi= 10.1002/0471140864.ps0518s44 |vauthors=Vinarov DA, Newman CL, Tyler EM, Markley JL, Shahan MN |isbn= 9780471140863}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mammalian cell-free systems have also been produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Methods Mol Biol |year= 2015 |volume=1261 |pages=129–40 | doi= 10.1007/978-1-4939-2230-7_7 |title=Cell-free protein synthesis systems derived from cultured mammalian cells |author=Brödel AK1, Wüstenhagen DA, Kubick S |pmid=25502197 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==

===Laboratory use===
Expression vector in an expression host is now the usual method used in laboratories to produce proteins for research. Most proteins are produced in ''E. coli'', but for glycosylated proteins and those with disulphide bonds, yeast, baculovirus and mammalian systems may be used.

===Production of peptide and protein pharmaceuticals===
Most protein [[pharmaceuticals]] are now produced through recombinant DNA technology using expression vectors. These peptide and protein pharmaceuticals may be hormones, vaccines, antibiotics, antibodies, and enzymes.&lt;ref name="pharmaceutical"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZhlApPkxpuAC&amp;pg=PA693&amp;lpg=PA693&amp;dq=&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Handbook of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology |author=Shayne Cox Gad |page=693 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |year=2007 |isbn= 978-0-471-21386-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first human recombinant protein used for disease management, insulin, was introduced in 1982.&lt;ref name="pharmaceutical"/&gt; Biotechnology allows these peptide and protein pharmaceuticals, some of which were previously rare or difficult to obtain, to be produced in large quantity. It also reduces the risks of contaminants such as host viruses, toxins and [[prions]]. Examples from the past include [[prion]] contamination in [[growth hormone]] extracted from [[pituitary gland]]s harvested from human cadavers, which caused [[Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease]] in patients receiving treatment for [[dwarfism]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Parents sue over contaminated human growth hormone |author=Alexander Dorozynski |journal=British Medical Journal |year=2002 |volume= 324 |issue=7349 |page=1294|pmc=1123268 |pmid=12039815 |doi=10.1136/bmj.324.7349.1294/b}}&lt;/ref&gt; and viral contaminants in clotting [[factor VIII]] isolated from human blood that resulted in the transmission of viral diseases such as [[hepatitis]] and [[AIDS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZhlApPkxpuAC&amp;pg=PA738&amp;lpg=PA738&amp;dq=&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Handbook of Pharmaceutical Biotechnology |author=Shayne Cox Gad |page=738 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn= 978-0-471-21386-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A00E4DA1F3EF931A15756C0A9659C8B63&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=1=2157 | title = 2 Paths of Bayer Drug in 80's: Riskier One Steered Overseas |vauthors=Bogdanich W, Koli E | date = 2003-05-22 | work = The New York Times }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such risk is reduced or removed completely when the proteins are produced in non-human host cells.

===Transgenic plant and animals===

In recent years, expression vectors have been used to introduce specific genes into plants and animals to produce [[transgenic]] organisms, for example in [[agriculture]] it is used to produce [[transgenic plants]]. Expression vectors have been used to introduce a [[vitamin A]] precursor, [[beta-carotene]], into rice plants. This product is called [[golden rice]]. This process has also been used to introduce a gene into plants that produces an [[insecticide]], called [[Bacillus thuringiensis|Bacillus thuringiensis toxin]] or [[Bacillus thuringiensis|Bt toxin]] which reduces the need for farmers to apply insecticides since it is produced by the modified organism. In addition expression vectors are used to extend the ripeness of tomatoes by altering the plant so that it produces less of the chemical that causes the tomatoes to rot.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bionetonline.org/english/content/ff_cont3.htm bionetonline.org]&lt;/ref&gt; There have been [[Genetically modified food controversies|controversies]] over using expression vectors to modify crops due to the fact that there might be unknown health risks, possibilities of companies patenting certain [[genetically modified food]] crops, and ethical concerns. Nevertheless, this technique is still being used and heavily researched.

[[Transgenic animals]] have also been produced to study animal biochemical processes and human diseases, or used to produce pharmaceuticals and other proteins. They may also be engineered to have advantageous or useful traits. [[Green fluorescent protein]] is sometimes used as tags which results in animal that can fluoresce, and this have been exploited commercially to produce the fluorescent [[GloFish]].

===Gene therapy===
{{main article|Vectors in gene therapy}}
[[Gene therapy]] is a promising treatment for a number of diseases where a "normal" gene carried by the vector is inserted into the genome, to replace an "abnormal" gene or supplement the expression of particular gene. Viral vectors are generally used but other nonviral methods of delivery are being developed. The treatment is still a risky option due to the viral vector used which can cause ill-effects, for example giving rise to [[insertional mutation]] that can result in cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/medicine/genetherapy.shtml |title=Gene therapy |work=Human Genome Project }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2003/oct/17/research.sciencenews |title=Doctors discover why gene therapy gave boys cancer |author=Ian Sample |work=Guardian |date=17 October 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there have been promising results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2013/apr/30/gene-therapy-trials-heart-patients|title= Pioneering gene therapy trials offer hope for heart patients|author=Sarah Boseley |work=Guardian |date=30 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Fischer | first1 = A. | last2 = Hacein-Bey-Abina | first2 = S. | last3 = Cavazzana-Calvo | first3 = M. | doi = 10.1038/ni0610-457 | title = 20 years of gene therapy for SCID | journal = Nature Immunology | volume = 11 | issue = 6 | pages = 457–460 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20485269| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Special Protocol Assessment''' ('''SPA''') is an advanced declaration from the [[Food and Drug Administration]] that an uncompleted Phase III [[clinical trial|trial]]'s design, clinical endpoints, and [[statistics|statistical analyses]] are acceptable for FDA approval.  The purpose of a SPA is to allow a company to run or initiate a clinical trial of an experimental drug without fear that the FDA will object to the trial design itself, in the event that the company subsequently applies for product approval.

Three types of protocols related to [[PDUFA]] products are eligible for this special protocol assessment under the PDUFA goals:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/GuidanceComplianceRegulatoryInformation/Guidances/ucm080571.pdf FDA Guidance for SPA - May 2002]&lt;/ref&gt;
# animal carcinogenicity protocols, 
# final product stability protocols, 
# clinical protocols for [[phase III trial|phase 3 trial]]s whose data will form the primary basis for an efficacy claim if the trials had been the subject of discussion at an end-of-phase 2/pre-phase 3 meeting with the [[FDA review division|review division]], or in some cases, if the division agrees to such a review because the division is aware of the developmental context in which the protocol is being reviewed and the questions are being answered.

The clinical protocols for phase 3 trials can relate to efficacy claims that will be part of an original [[new drug application]] (NDA) or [[Biologic License Application]] (BLA) or that will be part of an efficacy supplement to an approved NDA or BLA.

'''Fatma Sultan''' (1559–1580; [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]]: فاطمہ سلطان) was an Ottoman [[princess]], daughter of [[Sultan]] [[Selim II]] (reign 1566–74) of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. She was the granddaughter of [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] (reign 1520–66) and [[Roxelana|Hürrem Sultan]], sister of Sultan [[Murad III]] (reign 1574–95) and aunt of Sultan [[Mehmed III]] (reign 1595–1603).

'''François-Louis Schmied''' (born November 8, 1873 in [[Geneva]]; died January 1941 in [[Tahannaout|Tahanaout]], [[Morocco]]), was a French painter, [[Wood engraving|wood engraver]], [[Printing|printer]], editor, [[illustrator]], and bookbinder of Swiss origin.

Of Swiss origin, François-Louis Schmied established himself in [[France]], where he was later naturalized, and ultimately was exiled in Morocco around 1931 or 1932.  He is considered a major artist in the [[Les Arts Décoratifs|Art Deco]] style, particularly in the area of publishing for bibliophiles.&lt;ref&gt;François-Louis Schmied : une figure de l'Art déco, in [http://www.universalis.fr/encyclopedie/francois-louis-schmied ''Encyclopédia Universalis''], version 10 (DVD) - excerpt online.&lt;/ref&gt; He is the father of engraver Théo Schmied, who directed François-Louis Schmied's workshop beginning in 1924.

In 1910 Schmied was commissioned to engrave and print Paul Jouve's illustrations for The Jungle Book by Rudyard Kipling. This book was finally published in 1919 and brought Schmied considerable attention. The success of the production allowed Schmied to expand his operations, purchase a Stanhope handpress, and hire a group of craftsmen who helped Schmied execute some of his most famous and pioneering works such as Les Climats (1924), Daphne (1924), and Le Cantique des Cantiques (1925).

Schmied books were very expensive to produce and were always printed in a very limited edition, usually numbering no more than 100-200 copies. His marketing strategy was to display sheets of his work in progress at an annual Parisian art fair and seek out the subscription of wealthy bibliophiles and other interested organizations. During the "Roaring 20s" it was not difficult to find suitable patrons, but with the onset of The Great Depression, the economic climate could no longer support Schmied's expensive projects and eventually he was forced to sell off virtually all his assets and close down his shop.

[[File:Paradiso Canto 31.jpg|thumb|upright|right|300px|[[Dante Alighieri|Dante]] and [[Beatrice Portinari|Beatrice]] gaze upon the highest heavens; from [[Gustave Doré]]'s illustrations to the ''[[Divine Comedy]]''.]]

'''Heaven''', or '''the heavens''', is a common [[Religious cosmology|religious, cosmological]], or [[transcendence (philosophy)|transcendent]] place where beings such as [[Deity|gods]], [[angel]]s, [[spirit]]s, [[saint]]s, or [[Veneration of the dead|venerated ancestors]] are said to originate, be [[throne|enthroned]], or live. According to the beliefs of some religions, heavenly beings can descend to earth or [[Incarnation|incarnate]], and earthly beings can ascend to heaven in the [[afterlife]], or in exceptional cases [[Entering heaven alive|enter heaven alive]].

Heaven is often described as a "higher place", the [[Sacred|holiest]] place, a [[Paradise]], in contrast to [[hell]] or the [[Underworld]] or the "low places", and [[Universal reconciliation|universally]] or conditionally accessible by earthly beings according to various standards of [[divinity]], [[good and evil|goodness]], [[piety]], [[faith]], or other [[virtue]]s or [[orthodoxy|right beliefs]] or simply the [[will of God]]. Some believe in the possibility of a heaven on Earth in a [[World to Come]].

Another belief is in an [[axis mundi]] or [[world tree]] which connects the heavens, the terrestrial world, and the [[underworld]]. In [[Indian religions]], heaven is considered as ''[[Svarga|Svarga loka]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.spiritualresearchfoundation.org/spiritual-research/afterlife/life-after-death/|title=Life After Death Revealed - What Really Happens in the Afterlife|work=SSRF English|access-date=2018-03-22|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and the soul is again subjected to [[Reincarnation|rebirth]] in different living forms according to its ''[[karma]]''. This cycle can be broken after a soul achieves ''[[Moksha]]'' or ''[[Nirvana]]''. Any place of existence, either of humans, souls or deities, outside the tangible world (heaven, hell, or other) is referred to as ''[[otherworld]].''

== Etymology ==
[[File:Beowulf - heofones.jpg|thumb|"heofones," an ancient Anglo-Saxon word for heavens in the ''Beowulf'']]

The modern English word ''heaven'' is derived from the earlier ([[Middle English]]) ''heven'' (attested 1159); this in turn was developed from the previous [[Old English]] form ''heofon''. By about 1000, ''heofon'' was being used in reference to the [[Christianization|Christianized]] "place where God dwells", but originally, it had signified "sky, firmament"&lt;ref&gt;The Anglo-Saxons knew the concept of Paradise, which they expressed with words such as ''[[neorxnawang]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; (e.g. in ''[[Beowulf]]'', c. 725). The English term has cognates in the other [[Germanic languages]]: [[Old Saxon]] ''heƀan'' "sky, heaven" (hence also [[Middle Low German]] ''heven'' "sky"), [[Old Norse|Old Icelandic]] ''himinn'', [[Gothic language|Gothic]] ''himins''; and those with a variant final ''-l'': [[Old Frisian]] ''himel, himul'' "sky, heaven", Old Saxon and [[Old High German]] ''himil'', [[Old Saxon]] and [[Middle Low German]] ''hemmel'', [[Old Dutch]] and [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ''hemel'', and modern [[German language|German]] ''Himmel''. All of these have been derived from a [[Linguistic reconstruction|reconstructed]] [[Proto-Germanic]] form *''hemina-''.&lt;ref name=BARNHART346&gt;Barnhart (1995:357).&lt;/ref&gt; or ''*hemō''.&lt;ref name=Kroonen&gt;Guus Kroonen: ''Etymological Dictionary of Proto-Germanic'' (= ''Leiden Indo-European Etymological Dictionary Series'', vol. 11). Brill, Leiden and Boston 2009, s. v. "Hemina- ~ *Hemna-". First published online: October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The further derivation of this form is uncertain. A connection to [[Proto-Indo-European]] ''*ḱem-'' "cover, shroud", via a reconstructed ''*k̑emen-'' or  ''*k̑ōmen-'' "stone, heaven", has been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;Gerhard Köbler, ''Altenglisches Wörterbuch.'' [http://www.koeblergerhard.de/aewbhinw.html Fourth edition, online 2014], s. v. "heofon".&lt;/ref&gt; Others endorse the derivation from a Proto-Indo-European root ''*h₂éḱmō'' "stone" and, possibly, "heavenly vault" at the origin of this word, which then would have as [[cognate]]s [[Ancient Greek]] ἄκμων (ákmōn "anvil, pestle; [[meteorite]]"), [[Persian language|Persian]] آسمان‎ (''âsemân, âsmân'' "stone, sling-stone; sky, heaven") and [[Sanskrit]] अश्मन् (''aśman'' "stone, rock, sling-stone; [[thunderbolt]]; the [[firmament]]").&lt;ref name=Kroonen /&gt; In the latter case English ''[[hammer]]'' would be another cognate to the word.

[[File:Ruins from a temple in Naffur.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Ruins of the [[Ekur]] temple in [[Nippur]], believed by the ancient Mesopotamians to be the "Dur-an-ki", the "mooring-rope" of heaven and earth.{{sfn|Hundley|2015|page=452}}{{snf|Black|Green|1992|page=74}}]]
{{Main article|Ancient Mesopotamian religion}}

The ancient Mesopotamians regarded the sky as a series of domes (usually three, but sometimes seven) covering the [[flat earth]].{{sfn|Nemet-Nejat|1998|page=180}} Each dome was made of a different kind of precious stone.{{sfn|Nemet-Nejat|1998|page=203}} The lowest dome of heaven was made of [[jasper]] and was the home of the [[star]]s.{{sfn|Lambert|2016|page=118}}{{sfn|Hundley|2015|page=451}} The middle dome of heaven was made of ''saggilmut'' stone and was the abode of the [[Igigi]].{{sfn|Lambert|2016|page=118}}{{sfn|Hundley|2015|page=451}} The highest and outermost dome of heaven was made of ''luludānītu'' stone and was personified as [[Anu|An]], the god of the sky.{{sfn|Stephens|2013}}{{sfn|Lambert|2016|page=118}}{{sfn|Hundley|2015|page=451}} The [[Astronomical object|celestial bodies]] were equated with specific deities as well.{{sfn|Nemet-Nejat|1998|page=203}} The planet [[Venus]] was believed to be [[Inanna]], the goddess of love, sex, and war.{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|pages=108–109}}{{sfn|Nemet-Nejat|1998|page=203}} The [[sun]] was her brother [[Utu]], the god of justice, and the [[moon]] was their father [[Sin (mythology)|Nanna]].{{sfn|Nemet-Nejat|1998|page=203}}

In ancient Near Eastern cultures in general and in Mesopotamia in particular, humans had little to no access to the divine realm.{{sfn|Hundley|2015|pages=451–452}}{{sfn|Wright|2000|page=29}} Heaven and earth were separated by their very nature;{{sfn|Hundley|2015|page=451}} humans could see and be affected by elements of the lower heaven, such as stars and storms,{{sfn|Hundley|2015|page=451}} but ordinary mortals could not go to heaven because it was the abode of the gods alone.{{sfn|Wright|2000|page=29}}{{sfn|Lange|Tov|Weigold|2011|page=808}}{{sfn|Hundley|2015|page=451}} In the ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'', [[Gilgamesh]] says to [[Enkidu]], "Who can go up to heaven, my friend? Only the gods dwell with Shamash forever."{{sfn|Lange|Tov|Weigold|2011|page=808}} Instead, after a person died, his or her soul went to [[Kur]] (later known as [[Irkalla]]), a dark shadowy [[underworld]], located deep below the surface of the earth.{{sfn|Wright|2000|page=29}}{{sfn|Choksi|2014}}

All souls went to the same afterlife,{{sfn|Wright|2000|page=29}}{{sfn|Choksi|2014}} and a person's actions during life had no impact on how he would be treated in the world to come.{{sfn|Wright|2000|page=29}}{{sfn|Choksi|2014}} Nonetheless, funerary evidence indicates that some people believed that Inanna had the power to bestow special favors upon her devotees in the afterlife.{{sfn|Choksi|2014}}{{sfn|Barret|2007|pages=7–65}} Despite the separation between heaven and earth, humans sought access to the gods through [[oracle]]s and [[omen]]s.{{sfn|Hundley|2015|page=452}} The gods were believed to live in heaven,{{sfn|Hundley|2015|page=452}}{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=94}} but also in their temples, which were seen as the channels of communication between earth and heaven, which allowed mortal access to the gods.{{sfn|Hundley|2015|page=452}}{{snf|Black|Green|1992|page=174}} The [[Ekur]] temple in [[Nippur]] was known as the "Dur-an-ki", the "mooring-rope" of heaven and earth.{{snf|Black|Green|1992|pages=53, 74}} It was widely thought to have been built and established by Enlil himself.{{snf|Black|Green|1992|page=74}}

=== Canaanites and Phoenicians ===
{{Main article|Canaanite religion}}

Almost nothing is known of [[Bronze Age]] (pre-1200 BC) Canaanite views of heaven, and the archaeological findings at [[Ugarit]] (destroyed c. 1200 BC) have not provided information. The 1st century Greek author [[Philo of Byblos]] may preserve elements of [[Iron Age]] [[Phoenicia]]n religion in his ''[[Sanchuniathon]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Attridge, Harold. W., and R. A. Oden, Jr. (1981), ''Philo of Byblos: The Phoenician History: Introduction, Critical Text, Translation, Notes'', CBQMS '''9''' (Washington: D. C.: The Catholic Biblical Association of America).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hurrians and Hittites ===
{{Further|Hittite mythology}}
The ancient [[Hittites]] believed that some deities lived in Heaven, while others lived in remote places on earth, such as mountains, where humans had little access.{{sfn|Hundley|2015|pages=451–452}} In the Middle Hittite myths, heaven is the abode of the gods. In the [[Song of Kumarbi]], [[Alalu]] was king in heaven for nine years before giving birth to his son, [[Anu]]. Anu was himself overthrown by his son, [[Kumarbi]].&lt;ref&gt;Harry A. Hoffner, Gary M. Beckman - 1990&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- In Hittite belief El Elyon was known as Alalu. This divinity is believed to have taken as spouse Beruth (Bereshit, = "the Beginning"), and through entering time in this way his nature split. In some ways he is considered to have housed "[[Heavenly host|the Hosts of sky]]", the divine family of El, known as the [[Elohim]]. In other texts he was seen as descending from time to time to the divine mountain which supported the firmament, which is how the Elohim or Gods came to descend to mortal realms. In this way, the creation by the Elohim was seen as filling the heights. Thus in this way Shamayim comprised the "God Beyond God". Not much is known of his character or personality, as he was superseded and displaced from his authority by his son, El, whose personality fused with El Elyon, and in the Phoenician area Ba'al Hadad [[syncretism|syncretised]] with Shamayim to become known as Ba'al Shamayim ("Lord of heights"), --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sabatino Moscati Face of the Ancient Orient 2001 Page 174 "The first, called 'Kingship in Heaven', tells how this kingship passes from Alalu to Anu, ... was king in heaven, Alalu was seated on the throne and the mighty Anu, first among the gods,"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moscatti, Sabatino (1968), "The World of the Phoenicians" (Phoenix Giant)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=1EEtmT9Tbj4C&amp;dq=review+sabatino+phoenicians&amp;pg=PP1&amp;q=review+Sabatino+phoenicians|title=The Phoenicians|publisher=|isbn=9781850435334|last1=Moscati|first1=Sabatino|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Abrahamic religions ==
=== Hebrew Bible ===
As in ancient Near Eastern cultures, in the Hebrew Bible, the universe is commonly divided into two realms: heaven (''šāmayim'') and earth (''’ereṣ'').{{sfn|Hundley|2015|page=452}} Sometimes a third realm is added: either "sea" ({{bibleverse|Exodus|20:11}}, {{bibleverse|Genesis|1:10}}), "water under the earth" ({{bibleverse|Exodus|20:4}}, {{bibleverse|Deuteronomy|5:8}}), or sometimes a vague "land of the dead" that is never described in depth ({{bibleverse|Job|26:5}}, {{bibleverse|Psalm|139:8}}, {{bibleverse|Amos|9:2}}).{{sfn|Hundley|2015|page=452}} The structure of heaven itself is never fully described in the Hebrew Bible,{{sfn|Hundley|2015|page=453}} but the fact that the Hebrew word ''šāmayim'' is plural has been interpreted by scholars as an indication that the ancient Israelites envisioned the heavens as having multiple layers, much like the ancient Mesopotamians.{{sfn|Hundley|2015|page=453}} This reading is also supported by the use of the phrase "heaven of heavens" in verses such as {{bibleverse|Deteronomy|10:14}}, {{bibleverse|1 Kings|8:27}}, and {{bibleverse|2 Chronicles|2:6}} and {{bibleverse-nb|2 Chronicles|6:18}}.{{sfn|Hundley|2015|page=453}}

In line with the typical view of most Near Eastern cultures, the Hebrew Bible depicts heaven as a place that is inaccessible to humans.{{sfn|Hundley|2015|pages=452–453}} Although some prophets are occasionally granted temporary visionary access to heaven, such as in {{bibleverse|1 Kings|22:19-23}}, {{bibleverse|Job|1:6-12}} and {{bibleverse-nb|Job|2:1-6}}, and {{bibleverse|Isaiah|6}}, they hear only God's deliberations concerning the earth and learn nothing of what heaven is like.{{sfn|Hundley|2015|page=453}} There is almost no mention in the Hebrew Bible of heaven as a possible afterlife destination for human beings, who are instead described as "resting" in [[Sheol]] ({{bibleverse|Genesis|25:7-9}}, {{bibleverse|Deuteronomy|34:6}}, {{bibleverse|1 Kings|2:10}}).{{sfn|Hundley|2015|page=455}} The only two possible exceptions to this are [[Enoch (ancestor of Noah)|Enoch]], who is described in {{bibleverse|Genesis|5:24}} as having been "taken" by God, and the prophet [[Elijah]], who is described in {{bibleverse|2 Kings|2:11}} as having ascended to heaven in a chariot of fire.{{sfn|Hundley|2015|page=453}} According to Michael B. Hundley, the text in both of these instances is ambiguous regarding the significance of the actions being described{{sfn|Hundley|2015|page=453}} and in neither of these cases does the text explain what happened to the subject afterwards.{{sfn|Hundley|2015|page=453}}

The [[Yahweh|God of the Israelites]] is described as ruling both heaven and earth ({{bibleverse|Genesis|14:19}} {{bibleverse-nb|Genesis|22}} {{bibleverse-nb|Genesis|24:3}}, {{bibleverse|Psalm|146:6}}).{{sfn|Hundley|2015|page=453}} Other passages, such as {{bibleverse|1 Kings|8:27}} state that even the vastness of heaven cannot contain God's majesty.{{sfn|Hundley|2015|page=453}} A number of passages throughout the Hebrew Bible indicate that heaven and earth will one day come to an end ({{bibleverse|Psalm|102:26-27}}, {{bibleverse|Isaiah|13:5}}, {{bibleverse-nb|Isaiah|14:26}}, {{bibleverse-nb|Isaiah|24:18}}, {{bibleverse-nb|Isaiah|51:6}}, {{bibleverse|Jeremiah|4:23-28}}, and {{bibleverse|Zephaniah|1:2-3}} and {{bibleverse-nb|Zephaniah|18}}).{{sfn|Hundley|2015|page=453}} This view is paralleled in other ancient Near Eastern cultures, which also regarded heaven and earth as vulnerable and subject to dissolution.{{sfn|Hundley|2015|page=453}} However, the Hebrew Bible differs from other ancient Near Eastern cultures in that it portrays the God of Israel as independent of creation and unthreatened by its potential destruction.{{sfn|Hundley|2015|page=453}} Because most of the Hebrew Bible concerns the God of Israel's relationship with his people, most of the events described in it take place on earth, not in heaven.{{sfn|Hundley|2015|pages=453–454}} The [[Deuteronomist|Deuteronomistic source]], [[Deuteronomistic History]], and [[Priestly source]] all portray the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] as the sole channel of communication between earth and heaven.{{sfn|Hundley|2015|page=454}}

=== Second Temple Judaism ===
During the period of the [[Second Temple]] ({{circa}} 515 BC – 70 AD), the Jewish people lived under the rule of first the Persian [[Achaemenid Empire]], then the Greek kingdoms of the [[Diadochi]], and finally the [[Roman Empire]].{{sfn|Wright|2000|pages=98–138}} Their culture was profoundly influenced by those of the peoples who ruled them.{{sfn|Wright|2000|pages=98–138}} Consequently, their views on existence after death were profoundly shaped by the ideas of the Persians, Greeks, and Romans.{{sfn|Wright|2000|pages=115–117}}{{sfn|Sanders|1993|page=170}} The idea of the [[immortality of the soul]] is derived from Greek philosophy{{sfn|Sanders|1993|page=170}} and the idea of the [[resurrection of the dead]] is derived from Persian cosmology.{{sfn|Sanders|1993|page=170}} By the early first century AD, these two seemingly incompatible ideas were often conflated by Jewish thinkers.{{sfn|Sanders|1993|page=170}} The Jews also inherited from the Persians, Greeks, and Romans the idea that the human soul originates in the divine realm and seeks to return there.{{sfn|Wright|2000|pages=98–138}} The idea that a human soul belongs in heaven and that the earth is merely a temporary abode in which the soul is tested to prove its worthiness became increasingly popular during the [[Hellenistic period]] (323 – 31 BC).{{sfn|Hundley|2015|page=455}} Gradually, some Jews began to adopt the idea of heaven as the eternal home of the righteous dead.{{sfn|Hundley|2015|page=455}}

=== New Testament and early Christianity ===
{{main article|Heaven (Christianity)}}
[[File:Francesco Botticini - The Assumption of the Virgin.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[Assumption of the Virgin (Botticini)|Assumption of the Virgin]] by [[Francesco Botticini]] at the National Gallery London, shows three hierarchies and nine orders of angels, each with different characteristics.]]

Descriptions of heaven in the [[New Testament]] are more fully developed than those in the Old Testament, but are still generally vague.{{sfn|Hundley|2015|pages=455–456}} As in the Old Testament, in the New Testament, God is described as the ruler of heaven and earth, but his power over the earth is challenged by [[Satan]].{{sfn|Hundley|2015|page=455}} Sayings of [[Jesus]] recorded in the [[Gospel of Mark|Gospels of Mark]] and [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] speak of the "[[Kingdom of God]]" ({{lang-grc-gre|βασιλεία τοῦ θεοῦ}}; {{lang|grc-Latn|basileía tou theou}}), while the [[Gospel of Matthew]] more commonly uses the term "[[Kingdom of Heaven (Gospel of Matthew)|Kingdom of Heaven]]" ({{lang-grc-gre|βασιλεία τῶν οὐρανῶν}}; {{lang|grc-Latn|basileía tōn ouranōn}}).{{sfn|Sanders|1993|page=169}}{{sfn|Casey|2010|pages=212–226}}&lt;ref name=France101&gt;''The Gospel of Matthew'' by R.T.

Because God's Kingdom was believed to be superior to any human kingdom, this meant that God would necessarily drive out the Romans, who ruled Judea, and establish his own direct rule over the Jewish people.{{sfn|Sanders|1993|page=169}}{{sfn|Casey|2010|pages=215–216}} In the teachings of the historical Jesus, people are expected to prepare for the coming of the Kingdom of God by living moral lives.{{sfn|Sanders|1993|pages=170, 198–204}} Jesus's commands for his followers to adopt lifestyles of [[moral perfectionism]] are found in many passages throughout the Synoptic Gospels, particularly in the [[Sermon on the Mount]] in {{bibleverse|Matthew|5-7}}.{{sfn|Sanders|1993|pages=198–204}} Jesus also taught that, in the Kingdom of Heaven, there would be a reversal of roles in which "the last will be first and the first will be last" ({{bibleverse|Mark|10:31}}, {{bibleverse|Matthew|19:30}}, {{bibleverse|Matthew 20:16}}, and {{bibleverse|Luke|13:30}}).{{sfn|Sanders|1993|page=196}} This teaching recurs throughout the recorded teachings of Jesus, including in the admonition to be like a child in {{bibleverse|Mark|10:13-16}}, {{bibleverse|Matthew|19:30}}, and {{bibleverse|Luke|18:15-17}}, the [[Rich man and Lazarus|Parable of the Rich Man and Lazarus]] in {{bibleverse|Luke|16:19-31}}, the [[Parable of the Workers in the Vineyard]] in {{bibleverse|Matthew|20:1-16}}, the [[Parable of the Great Banquet]] in {{bibleverse|Matthew|22:1-10}}, and the [[Parable of the Prodigal Son]] in {{bibleverse|Luke|15:11-32}}.{{sfn|Sanders|1993|pages=196–198}}

Traditionally, [[Christianity]] has taught that heaven is the location of the [[throne of God]] as well as the holy [[angels]],&lt;ref name=JPII&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/audiences/1999/documents/hf_jp-ii_aud_21071999_en.html|title=21 July 1999 - John Paul II|publisher=|accessdate=31 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Ehrman 2006"&gt;Ehrman, Bart. Peter, Paul, and Mary Magdalene: The Followers of Jesus in History and Legend. Oxford University Press, USA. 2006. {{ISBN|0-19-530013-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; although this is in varying degrees considered [[metaphor]]ical. In traditional Christianity, it is considered a state or condition of existence (rather than a particular place somewhere in the [[cosmos]]) of the supreme fulfillment of [[Divinization (Christian)|theosis]] in the [[beatific vision]] of the [[Godhead in Christianity|Godhead]]. In most [[Christian denominations|forms of Christianity]], heaven is also understood as the abode for the redeemed dead in the [[afterlife]], usually a temporary stage before the [[resurrection of the dead]] and the [[saint]]s' return to [[the New Earth]].

The [[Resurrection of Jesus|resurrected Jesus]] is said to have [[Ascension of Jesus|ascended to heaven]] where [[Session of Christ|he now sits]] at the [[Right Hand of God]] and will return to earth in the [[Second Coming]]. Various people have been said to have [[Entering heaven alive|entered heaven while still alive]], including [[Enoch (ancestor of Noah)|Enoch]], [[Elijah]] and [[Jesus in Christianity|Jesus]] himself, after his resurrection. According to [[Roman Catholicism|Roman Catholic teaching]], [[Mary, mother of Jesus]], is also said to have been [[Assumption of Mary|assumed into heaven]] and is titled the [[Queen of Heaven]].

In the 2nd century AD, [[Irenaeus]] of Lyons recorded a belief that, in accordance with {{bibleverse||John|14:2}}, those who in the [[afterlife]] see the [[Salvation in Christianity|Saviour]] are in different mansions, some dwelling in the heavens, others in [[paradise]] and others in "[[New Jerusalem|the city]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf01.ix.vii.xxxvii.html Irenaeus, ''Adversus haereses'', book V, chapter XXXVI, 1-2]&lt;/ref&gt;

While the word used in all these writings, in particular the New Testament Greek word [[wikt:οὐρανός|οὐρανός]] (''ouranos''), applies primarily to the [[sky]], it is also used metaphorically of the dwelling place of God and the [[Blessing#Christianity|blessed]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dou%29rano%2Fs|title=Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon,οὐρα^νός|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://studybible.info/strongs/G3772|title=G3772 οὐρανός - Strong's Greek Lexicon|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, though the English word "heaven" still keeps its original physical meaning when used, for instance, in allusions to the stars as "lights shining through from heaven", and in phrases such as [[heavenly body]] to mean an astronomical object, the heaven or happiness that Christianity looks forward to is, according to Pope John Paul II, "neither an abstraction nor a physical place in the clouds, but a living, personal relationship with the [[Holy Trinity]]. It is our meeting with the [[God the Father|Father]] which takes place in the risen [[Christ]] through the communion of the [[Holy Spirit]]."&lt;ref name="JPII"/&gt;

=== Rabbinical Judaism ===
{{Main article|Heaven (Judaism)|Olam Haba}}

While the concept of heaven (''malkuth hashamaim'' מלכות השמים, the [[Kingdom of God|Kingdom of Heaven]]) is much discussed within the [[Christianity|Christian]] and [[Islam]]ic religions, the [[Jewish eschatology|Jewish concept of the afterlife]], sometimes known as ''olam haba'', the World-to-come, is not discussed so often. The [[Torah]] has little to say on the subject of survival after death, but by the time of the rabbis two ideas had made inroads among the Jews: one, which is probably derived from Greek thought,&lt;ref name=deLange/&gt; is that of the [[immortal soul]] which returns to its creator after death; the other, which is thought to be of Persian origin,&lt;ref name=deLange/&gt; is that of [[resurrection of the dead]].

Jewish writings{{Which|date=June 2010}} refer to a "new earth" as the abode of mankind following the resurrection of the dead. Originally, the two ideas of [[immortality]] and resurrection were different but in rabbinic thought they are combined: the soul departs from the body at death but is returned to it at the [[Resurrection of the Dead|resurrection]]. This idea is linked to another rabbinic teaching, that men's good and bad actions are rewarded and punished not in this life but after death, whether immediately or at the subsequent resurrection.&lt;ref name=deLange/&gt; Around 1 CE, the [[Pharisees]] are said to have maintained belief in resurrection but the [[Sadducees]] are said to have denied it (Matt. 22:23).

The [[Mishnah]] has many sayings about the [[World to Come]], for example, "Rabbi Yaakov said: This world is like a lobby before the World to Come; prepare yourself in the lobby so that you may enter the banquet hall."&lt;ref&gt;Pirkei Avot, 4:21&lt;/ref&gt;

Judaism holds that the [[Righteous gentiles|righteous of all nations]] have a share in the World-to-come.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewfaq.org/olamhaba.htm|title=Judaism 101: Olam Ha-Ba: The Afterlife|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Nicholas de Lange]], [[Judaism]] offers no clear teaching about the destiny which lies in wait for the individual after death and its attitude to life after death has been expressed as follows: "For the future is inscrutable, and the accepted sources of knowledge, whether experience, or reason, or revelation, offer no clear guidance about what is to come. The only certainty is that each man must die - beyond that we can only guess."&lt;ref name=deLange&gt;Nicholas de Lange, ''Judaism'', Oxford University Press, 1986&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Tracey R. Rich of the website "Judaism 101", Judaism, unlike other world-religions, is not focused on the quest of getting into heaven but on life and how to live it.&lt;ref&gt;"Some people look at these teachings and deduce that Jews try to "earn our way into heaven" by performing the mitzvot. This is a gross mischaracterization of our religion. It is important to remember that unlike some religions, Judaism is not focused on the question of how to get into heaven. Judaism is focused on life and how to live it." [http://www.jewfaq.org/olamhaba.htm Olam Ha-Ba: The World to Come] Judaism 101; websource 02-11-2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Kabbalah Jewish mysticism ====

In order from lowest to highest, the [[heaven in Judaism|seven heavens, ''Shamayim'' (שָׁמַיִם)]], according to the [[Talmud]], are listed alongside the [[angel]]s who govern them:&lt;ref&gt;The Seven Heavens in the Talmud.(see Ps. lxviii. 5).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=1521&amp;letter=A#4364|title=ANGELOLOGY - JewishEncyclopedia.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# '''Vilon''' (וִילוֹן) or '''Araphel''' (עֲרָפֶל) The first heaven, governed by [[Archangel]] [[Gabriel]], is the closest of heavenly realms to the Earth; it is also considered the abode of [[Adam (Bible)|Adam]] and [[Eve]].
# '''Raqia''' (רָקִיעַ): The second heaven is dually controlled by [[Zachariel]] and [[Raphael (archangel)|Raphael]]. It was in this heaven that [[Moses]], during his visit to Paradise, encountered the angel [[Nuriel]] who stood "300 [[parasang]]s high, with a retinue of 50 myriads of angels all fashioned out of water and fire". Also, Raqia is considered the realm where the fallen angels are imprisoned and the planets fastened.&lt;ref&gt;''The Legends of the Jews'' I, 131, and II, 306.&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''[[Third heaven|Shehaqim]]''' (שְׁחָקִים, ''Shechaqim''): The third heaven, under the leadership of [[Haniel|Anahel]], serves as the home of the [[Garden of Eden]] and the [[Tree of Life (Judeo-Christian)|Tree of Life]]; it is also the realm where [[manna]], the holy food of angels, is produced.&lt;ref&gt;''The Legends of the Jews'' V, 374.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Second Book of Enoch]]'', meanwhile, states that both Paradise and hell are accommodated in Shehaqim with hell being located simply "on the northern side".
# '''Maon''' (מִעוּן): The fourth heaven is ruled by the Archangel [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]], and according to [[Talmud]] Hagiga 12, it contains the heavenly [[Jerusalem]], the Temple, and the Altar.
# '''Makon''' (מִכּוּן, ''Makhon''): The fifth heaven is under the administration of [[Samael]]. It is also where the [[Ishim (angel)|Ishim]] and the [[Song-Uttering Choirs]] reside.
# '''Zebul''' (זִבּוּל): The sixth heaven falls under the jurisdiction of [[Sachiel]].
# '''Araboth''' (עֲרֵבוּת, ''Aravoth''): The seventh heaven, under the leadership of [[Cassiel]], is the holiest of the seven heavens because it houses the Throne of Glory attended by the Seven Archangels and serves as the realm in which God dwells; underneath the throne itself lies the [[Guf|abode]] of all unborn human souls. It is also considered the home of the [[Seraphim]], the [[Cherubim]], and the [[Hayyoth]].&lt;ref&gt;Ginzberg, Louis. Henrietta Szold (trans.). ''The Legends of the Jews''.

=== Islam ===
[[File:Mohammed´s Paradise.jpg|thumb|[[Persian miniature]] depicting the artist's impression of [[Jannah]]]]
{{Main article|Jannah}}

The [[Quran]] contains many references to an afterlife in Eden for those who do good deeds. Regarding the concept of heaven ([[Jannah]]) in the Quran, verse 35 of Surah Al-Ra’d says, "The parable of the Garden which the righteous are promised! Beneath it flow rivers. Perpetual is the fruits thereof and the shade therein. Such is the End of the Righteous; and the end of the unbelievers is the Fire."{{Cite quran|13|35}} Islam rejects the concept of [[original sin]], and Muslims believe that all human beings are born pure. Children automatically go to heaven when they die, regardless of the religion of their parents.

The concept of heaven in [[Islam]] differs in many respects to the concept in [[Judaism]] and [[Christianity]]. Heaven is described primarily in physical terms as a place where every wish is immediately fulfilled when asked. Islamic texts describe immortal life in heaven as happy, without negative emotions. Those who dwell in heaven are said to wear costly apparel, partake in exquisite banquets, and recline on couches inlaid with gold or precious stones. Inhabitants will rejoice in the company of their parents, spouses, and children. In Islam if one's good deeds outweigh one's sins then one may gain entrance to heaven. Conversely, if one's sins outweigh their good deeds they are sent to hell. The more good deeds one has performed the higher the level of heaven one is directed to. It has been said that the lowest level of heaven, the first one, is already over one-hundred times better than the greatest life on Earth. Houses are built by angels for the occupants using solid gold.

Verses which describe heaven include: {{Cite quran|13|35|style=ns}}, {{Cite quran|18|31|style=ns}}, {{Cite quran|38|49|end=54|style=ns}}, {{Cite quran|35|33|end=35|style=ns}}, {{Cite quran|52|17|end=27|style=ns}}, {{Cite quran|78|31|end=34|style=ns}}.

Islamic texts refer to several levels of heaven: [[Firdaus]] or [[Paradise]], 'Adn (Eden), Jannatun-Na'iim (heaven of delight), Ma'wa (refuge), Darussalaam (home of peace), Daarul-Muqaamah (home of permanence), Al-Muqqamul Amin (the secure place) &amp; Jannattul-Khuld (heaven of immortality).

==== Ahmadiyya ====

According to the [[Ahmadiyya]] view, much of the imagery presented in the Quran regarding heaven, but also hell, is in fact metaphorical. They propound the verse which describes, according to them how the life to come after death is very different from the life here on earth. The Quran says: {{cite quran|56|62|quote=From bringing in your place others like you, and from developing you into a form which at present you know not.}} According to [[Mirza Ghulam Ahmad]], the founder of [[Ahmadiyya]] sect in Islam, the soul will give birth to another rarer entity and will resemble the life on this earth in the sense that this entity will bear a similar relationship to the soul, as the soul bears relationship with the human existence on earth. On earth, if a person leads a righteous life and submits to the will of God, his or her tastes become attuned to enjoying spiritual pleasures as opposed to carnal desires. With this, an "embryonic soul" begins to take shape. Different tastes are said to be born which a person given to carnal passions finds no enjoyment. For example, sacrifice of one's own's rights over that of other's becomes enjoyable, or that forgiveness becomes second nature. In such a state a person finds contentment and Peace at heart and at this stage, according to Ahmadiyya beliefs, it can be said that a soul within the soul has begun to take shape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=iU1Yn4sSXEkC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=elementary+study+of+islam#v=onepage&amp;q=elementary%20study%20of%20islam&amp;f=false | title=An Elementary Study of Islam | author=Mirza Tahir Ahmad| page=50 |publisher=Islam International Publications |isbn=978-1-85372-562-3| year=1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bahá'í Faith ===
{{Main article|Bahá'í Faith}}

The [[Bahá'í Faith]] regards the conventional description of heaven (and hell) as a specific place as symbolic. The [[Bahá'í literature|Bahá'í writings]] describe heaven as a "spiritual condition" where closeness to God is defined as heaven; conversely [[hell]] is seen as a state of remoteness from God. [[Bahá'u'lláh]], the founder of the Bahá'í Faith, has stated that the nature of the life of the soul in the afterlife is beyond comprehension in the physical plane, but has stated that the soul will retain its consciousness and individuality and remember its physical life; the soul will be able to recognize other souls and communicate with them.&lt;ref name="lafd"&gt;{{cite book | title = Life After Death: A study of the afterlife in world religions | last = Masumian | first = Farnaz | publisher = Oneworld Publications | location = Oxford | year = 1995 | isbn = 978-1-85168-074-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For Bahá'ís, entry into the next life has the potential to bring great joy.&lt;ref name="lafd" /&gt; Bahá'u'lláh likened death to the process of birth. He explains: "The world beyond is as different from this world as this world is different from that of the child while still in the [[womb]] of its mother."&lt;ref name="gwb"&gt;{{cite book |author=Bahá'u'lláh |authorlink=Bahá'u'lláh |year=1976 |title=Gleanings from the Writings of Bahá'u'lláh |publisher=Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location=Wilmette, Illinois, USA |isbn=978-0-87743-187-9 | page = 157 |url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/GWB/gwb-81.html#pg157 |accessdate=2016-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The analogy to the womb in many ways summarizes the Bahá'í view of earthly existence: just as the womb constitutes an important place for a person's initial physical development, the physical world provides for the development of the individual [[Soul (spirit)|soul]]. Accordingly, Bahá'ís view life as a preparatory stage, where one can develop and perfect those qualities which will be needed in the next life.&lt;ref name="lafd" /&gt; The key to spiritual progress is to follow the path outlined by the current [[Manifestation of God]], which Bahá'ís believe is currently Bahá'u'lláh. Bahá'u'lláh wrote, "Know thou, of a truth, that if the soul of man hath walked in the ways of God, it will, assuredly return and be gathered to the glory of the Beloved."&lt;ref name="gwb2"&gt;{{cite book |author=Bahá'u'lláh |authorlink=Bahá'u'lláh |year=1976 |title=Gleanings from the Writings of Bahá'u'lláh |publisher=Bahá'í Publishing Trust |location=Wilmette, Illinois, USA |isbn=978-0-87743-187-9 | page = 162 |url=http://reference.bahai.org/en/t/b/GWB/gwb-82.html#gr7 |accessdate=2016-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bahá'í teachings state that there exists a hierarchy of souls in the [[afterlife]], where the merits of each soul determines their place in the hierarchy, and that souls lower in the hierarchy cannot completely understand the station of those above. Each soul can continue to progress in the afterlife, but the soul's development is not entirely dependent on its own conscious efforts, the nature of which we are not aware, but also augmented by the grace of God, the [[prayer]]s of others, and good deeds performed by others on Earth in the name of that person.&lt;ref name="lafd" /&gt;

== Chinese religions ==
{{Main article|Tian}}
[[File:天-oracle.svg|150px|thumb|right|Chinese [[Zhou Dynasty]] [[Oracle script]] for ''tian'', the character for "heaven" or "sky".]]

In the native [[China|Chinese]] [[Confucian]] traditions, heaven ([[Tian]]) is an important concept, where the ancestors reside and from which emperors drew their mandate to rule in their dynastic propaganda, for example.

Heaven is a key concept in Chinese mythology, philosophies and religions, and is on one end of the spectrum a synonym of ''[[Shangdi]]'' ("Supreme Deity") and on the other naturalistic end, a synonym for [[nature]] and the sky. The Chinese term for "heaven", ''[[Tian]]'' (天), derives from the name of the supreme deity of the [[Zhou Dynasty]]. After their conquest of the [[Shang Dynasty]] in 1122 BC, the Zhou people considered their supreme deity ''Tian'' to be identical with the [[Shang Dynasty|Shang]] supreme deity ''Shangdi''.&lt;ref&gt;Herrlee Creel "The Origin of the Deity T'ien" (1970:493-506)&lt;/ref&gt; The Zhou people attributed heaven with anthropomorphic attributes, evidenced in the etymology of the Chinese character for heaven or sky, which originally depicted a person with a large cranium. heaven is said to see, hear and watch over all men. heaven is affected by man's doings, and having personality, is happy and angry with them. Heaven blesses those who please it and sends calamities upon those who offend it.&lt;ref name="Joseph Shih pp 99-138"&gt;Joseph Shih, "The Notion of God in the Ancient Chinese Religion," Numen, Vol. 16, Fasc. 2, pp 99-138, Brill: 1969&lt;/ref&gt; Heaven was also believed to transcend all other spirits and gods, with [[Confucius]] asserting, "He who offends against Heaven has none to whom he can pray."&lt;ref name="Joseph Shih pp 99-138"/&gt;

Other philosophers born around the time of Confucius such as [[Mozi]] took an even more theistic view of heaven, believing that heaven is the divine ruler, just as the [[Emperor of China|Son of Heaven]] (the King of Zhou) is the earthly ruler. Mozi believed that spirits and minor gods exist, but their function is merely to carry out the will of heaven, watching for evil-doers and punishing them. Thus they function
as angels of heaven and do not detract from its monotheistic government of the world. With such a high monotheism, it is not surprising that [[Mohism]] championed a concept called "universal love" (''jian'ai'', 兼愛), which taught that heaven loves all people equally and that each person should similarly love all human beings without distinguishing between his own relatives and those of others.&lt;ref&gt;Homer Dubs, "Theism and Naturalism in Ancient Chinese Philosophy," Philosophy of East and West, Vol 9, No 3/4, pp 163-172, University of Hawaii Press: 1960.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Mozi]]'s ''Will of Heaven'' (天志), he writes:

{{quote box 
| quote="I know Heaven loves men dearly not without reason. Heaven ordered the sun, the moon, and the stars to enlighten and guide them. Heaven ordained the four seasons, Spring, Autumn, Winter, and Summer, to regulate them. Heaven sent down snow, frost, rain, and dew to grow the five grains and flax and silk that so the people could use and enjoy them. Heaven established the hills and rivers, ravines and valleys, and arranged many things to minister to man's good or bring him evil. He appointed the dukes and lords to reward the virtuous and punish the wicked, and to gather metal and wood, birds and beasts, and to engage in cultivating the five grains and flax and silk to provide for the people's food and clothing. This has been so from antiquity to the present."

Original Chinese: 「且吾所以知天之愛民之厚者有矣，曰以磨為日月星辰，以昭道之；制為四時春秋冬夏，以紀綱之；雷降雪霜雨露，以長遂五穀麻絲，使民得而財利之；列為山川谿谷，播賦百事，以臨司民之善否；為王公侯伯，使之賞賢而罰暴；賊金木鳥獸，從事乎五穀麻絲，以為民衣食之財。自古及今，未嘗不有此也。」
| source=Mozi, ''Will of Heaven'', Chapter 27, Paragraph 6, ca. 5th Century BC

}}

[[Mozi]] criticized the Confucians of his own time for not following the teachings of Confucius. By the time of the later [[Han Dynasty]], however, under the influence of [[Xun Kuang|Xunzi]], the Chinese concept of heaven and Confucianism itself had become mostly naturalistic, though some Confucians argued that heaven was where ancestors reside. Worship of heaven in China continued with the erection of shrines, the last and greatest being the [[Temple of Heaven]] in Beijing, and the offering of prayers. The ruler of China in every Chinese dynasty would perform annual sacrificial rituals to heaven, usually by slaughtering two healthy bulls as a sacrifice.

== Indic religions ==
=== Buddhism ===
{{main|Buddhist cosmology}}

In [[Buddhism]] there are several heavens, all of which are still part of ''[[Saṃsāra (Buddhism)|samsara]]'' (illusionary reality). Those who accumulate good [[karma]] may be reborn&lt;ref&gt;(but no soul actually goes through rebirth; see [[anatta]])&lt;/ref&gt; in one of them. However, their stay in heaven is not eternal—eventually they will use up their good karma and will undergo [[rebirth (Buddhism)|rebirth]] into another realm, as a human, animal or other being. Because heaven is temporary and part of ''samsara'', Buddhists focus more on escaping the cycle of rebirth and reaching [[Nirvana (Buddhism)|enlightenment]] (''nirvana''). Nirvana is not a heaven but a mental state.

According to [[Buddhist cosmology]] the universe is impermanent and beings transmigrate through a number of existential "planes" in which this human world is only one "realm" or "path".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.many-lives.com/lives/paradise.html|title=The Jivamala - Salvation Versus Liberation, The Limitations of the Paradise or Heavenly Worlds|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These are traditionally envisioned as a vertical continuum with the heavens existing above the human realm, and the realms of the animals, [[hungry ghost]]s and hell beings existing beneath it. According to Jan Chozen Bays in her book, ''Jizo: Guardian of Children, Travelers, and Other Voyagers'', the realm of the ''[[asura]]'' is a later refinement of the heavenly realm and was inserted between the human realm and the heavens. One important Buddhist heaven is the ''[[Trāyastriṃśa]]'', which resembles [[Mount Olympus|Olympus]] of Greek mythology.

In the [[Mahayana]] world view, there are also [[pure land]]s which lie outside this continuum and are created by the Buddhas upon attaining enlightenment. Rebirth in the pure land of Amitabha is seen as an assurance of Buddhahood, for once reborn there, beings do not fall back into cyclical existence unless they [[Bodhisattva|choose to do so]] to save other beings, the goal of Buddhism being the obtainment of enlightenment and freeing oneself and others from the birth–death cycle.

The [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]] word ''[[Bardo]]'' means literally "[[intermediate state]]". In [[Sanskrit]] the concept has the name ''antarabhāva''.

==== According to Anguttara Nikaya ====


'''Brahmāloka'''

Here the denizens are Brahmās, and the ruler is Mahābrahmā

After developing the four Brahmavihāras, King Makhādeva rebirths here after death. The monk Tissa and Brāhmana Jānussoni were also reborn here.

For a monk, the next best thing to Nirvana is to be reborn in this Brahmāloka.

The lifespan of a Brahmās is not stated but is not eternal.

'''Parinirmita-vaśavartin''' or '''Paranimmita-vasavatti'''

The heaven of devas "with power over (others') creations".  These devas do not create pleasing forms that they desire for themselves, but their desires are fulfilled by the acts of other devas who wish for their favor.  The ruler of this world is called Vaśavartin (Pāli: Vasavatti), who has longer life, greater beauty, more power and happiness and more delightful sense-objects than the other devas of his world.  This world is also the home of the devaputra (being of divine race) called [[Mara (demon)|Māra]], who endeavors to keep all beings of the Kāmadhātu in the grip of sensual pleasures. Māra is also sometimes called Vaśavartin, but in general these two dwellers in this world are kept distinct. The beings of this world are {{convert|4500|ft|m}} tall and live for 9,216,000,000 years (Sarvāstivāda tradition). 

'''Nimmānarati'''

The world of devas "delighting in their creations".  The devas of this world are capable of making any appearance to please themselves.  The lord of this world is called Sunirmita (Pāli Sunimmita); his wife is the rebirth of [[Visakha|Visākhā]], formerly the chief [[Upasaka|upāsikā]] (female lay devotee) of the Buddha. The beings of this world are {{convert|3750|ft|m}} tall and live for 2,304,000,000 years (Sarvāstivāda tradition). 

'''[[Tushita|{{IAST|Tuṣita}}]]''' 

The world of the "joyful" devas.  This world is best known for being the world in which a [[Bodhisattva]] lives before being reborn in the world of humans. Until a few thousand years ago, the Bodhisattva of this world was Śvetaketu (Pāli: Setaketu), who was reborn as Siddhārtha, who would become the Buddha [[Gautama Buddha|Śākyamuni]]; since then the Bodhisattva has been Nātha (or Nāthadeva) who will be reborn as Ajita and will become the Buddha [[Maitreya]] (Pāli Metteyya).  While this Bodhisattva is the foremost of the dwellers in {{IAST|Tuṣita}}, the ruler of this world is another deva called {{IAST|Santuṣita}} (Pāli: Santusita). The beings of this world are {{convert|3000|ft|m}} tall and live for 576,000,000 years (Sarvāstivāda tradition). Anāthapindika, a Kosālan householder and benefactor to the Buddha's order was reborn here.

'''Yāma'''

The denizens here have a lifespan of 144,000,000 years.

'''Tāvatimsa'''

The ruler of this heaven is [[Indra]] or Shakra, and the realm is also called Trayatrimia.

Each denizen addresses other denizens as the title "mārisa".

The governing hall of this heaven is called Sudhamma Hall.

This heaven has a garden Nandanavana with damsels, as its most magnificent sight.

Ajita the Licchavi army general was reborn here. Gopika the Sākyan girl was reborn as a male god in this realm.

Any Buddhist reborn in this realm can outshine any of the previously dwelling denizens because of the extra merit acquired for following the Buddha's teachings.

The denizens here have a lifespan of 36,000,000 years.

'''[[Four Heavenly Kings|Cātummahārājika]]'''

The heaven "of the Four Great Kings". Its rulers are the four Great Kings of the name, {{IAST|Virūḍhaka विरुद्धक}}, {{IAST|Dhṛtarāṣṭra धृतराष्ट्र}}, {{IAST|Virūpākṣa विरुपाक्ष}}, and their leader [[Vaisravana|{{IAST|Vaiśravaṇa वैश्यवर्ण}}]]. The devas who guide the Sun and Moon are also considered part of this world, as are the retinues of the four kings, composed of [[Kumbhanda|{{IAST|Kumbhāṇḍas कुम्भाण्ड}}]] (dwarfs), [[Gandharva गन्धर्व|Gandharva गन्धर्वs]] (fairies), [[Naga नाग (mythology)|Nāgas]] (snakes) and [[Yaksha|{{IAST|Yakṣas यक्ष}}]] (goblins).  The beings of this world are {{convert|750|ft|m}} tall and live for 9,000,000 years (Sarvāstivāda tradition) or 90,000 years (Vibhajyavāda tradition).

==== Tibetan Buddhism ====

There are 5 major types of heavens.
# '''Akanishtha''' or '''Ghanavyiiha''' &lt;br&gt; This is the most supreme heaven wherein beings that have achieved Nirvana live for eternity.
# '''Heaven of the Jinas'''
# '''Heavens of Formless Spirits''' &lt;br&gt; These are 4 in number.
# '''Brahmaloka''' &lt;br&gt; These are 16 in number, and are free from sensuality.
# '''Devaloka''' &lt;br&gt; These are 6 in number, and contain sensuality.

=== Hinduism ===
{{Main article|Hindu cosmology}}
Attaining heaven is not the final pursuit in Hinduism as heaven itself is ephemeral and related to physical body. Only being tied by the bhoot-tatvas, heaven cannot be perfect either and is just another name for pleasurable and mundane material life. According to [[Hindu cosmology]], above the earthly plane, are other planes: (1) Bhuva [[Loka]], (2) [[Swarga]] Loka, meaning Good Kingdom, is the general name for heaven in Hinduism, a heavenly [[paradise]] of pleasure, where most of the Hindu Devatas ([[Deva (Hinduism)|Deva]]) reside along with the king of Devas, Indra, and beatified mortals. Some other planes are Mahar Loka, Jana Loka, Tapa Loka and Satya Loka. Since heavenly abodes are also tied to the cycle of birth and death, any dweller of heaven or hell will again be recycled to a different plane and in a different form per the karma and "maya" i.e. the illusion of Samsara. This cycle is broken only by self-realization by the Jivatma. This self-realization is [[Moksha]] (Turiya, Kaivalya).

The concept of moksha is unique to Hinduism and is unparalleled. Moksha stands for liberation from the cycle of birth and death and final communion with Brahman. With moksha, a liberated soul attains the stature and oneness with [[Brahman]] or [[Paramatma]]. Different schools such as Vedanta, Mimansa, Sankhya, Nyaya, Vaisheshika, and Yoga offer subtle differences in the concept of Brahman, obvious Universe, its genesis and regular destruction, Jivatma, Nature (Prakriti) and also the right way in attaining perfect bliss or moksha.

In the [[Vaishnava]] traditions the highest heaven is [[Vaikuntha]], which exists above the six heavenly lokas and outside of the mahat-[[tattva]] or mundane world. It's where eternally liberated souls who have attained moksha reside in eternal sublime beauty with [[Lakshmi]] and [[Narayana]] (a manifestation of [[Vishnu]]).

In the [[Nasadiya Sukta]], the heavens/sky Vyoman is mentioned as a place from which an overseeing entity surveys what has been created. However, the Nasadiya Sukta questions the omniscience of this overseer.

=== Jainism ===
{{Main article|Jain cosmology}}
[[File:Jain Universe.jpg|thumb|300px| Structure of Universe per the Jain Scriptures.]]

The shape of the Universe as described in Jainism is shown alongside. Unlike the current convention of using North direction as the top of map, this uses South as the top. The shape is similar to a part of human form standing upright.

The ''Deva Loka'' (heavens) are at the symbolic "chest", where all souls enjoying the positive karmic effects reside. The heavenly beings are referred to as ''devas'' (masculine form) and ''devis'' (feminine form). According to Jainism, there is not one heavenly abode, but several layers to reward appropriately the souls of varying degree of karmic merits. Similarly, beneath the "waist" are the ''Narka Loka'' (hell). Human, animal, insect, plant and microscopic life forms reside on the middle.

The pure souls (who reached Siddha status) reside at the very south end (top) of the Universe. They are referred to in Tamil literature as தென்புலத்தார் ([[Kural]] 43).

=== Sikh Religion ===

As per Sikh thought, heaven and hell are not places for living hereafter, they are part of spiritual topography of man and do not exist otherwise. They refer to good and evil stages of life respectively and can be lived now and here during our earthly existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=rFm9_Jc1ykcC&amp;pg=PA271 | title=A Complete Guide to Sikhism | publisher=Unistar Books | last=Singh | first=Jagraj | year=2009 | pages=271 | isbn=978-8-1714-2754-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Bhagat Kabir]] rejects the otherworldly heaven in [[Guru Granth Sahib]] and says that one can experience heaven on this Earth by doing company of holy people.

{{Quotation|&lt;poem&gt;He claims to know the Lord, who is beyond measure and beyond thought; By mere words, he plans to enter heaven. I do not know where heaven is. Everyone claims that he plans to go there. By mere talk, the mind is not appeased. The mind is only appeased, when egotism is conquered. As long as the mind is filled with the desire for heaven, He does not dwell at the Lord's Feet. Says Kabeer, unto whom should I tell this? The Company of the Holy is heaven.&lt;/poem&gt;|Bhagat Kabir|Guru Granth Sahib 325|&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.srigranth.org/servlet/gurbani.gurbani?Action=Page&amp;Param=325|title=Sri Granth: Sri Guru Granth Sahib}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Mesoamerican religions ==
{{main article|Aztec mythology}}
The [[Nahua people]] such as the [[Aztec mythology|Aztecs]], [[Chichimecs]] and the [[Toltecs]] believed that the heavens were constructed and separated into 13 levels. Each level had from one to many Lords living in and ruling these heavens. Most important of these heavens was Omeyocan (Place of Two). The [[Thirteen Heavens]] were ruled by [[Ometeotl]], the dual Lord, creator of the Dual-Genesis who, as male, takes the name Ometecuhtli (Two Lord), and as female is named Omecihuatl (Two Lady).

== Polynesia ==
{{Main article|Polynesian mythology}}
In the [[creation myth]]s of [[Polynesian mythology]] are found various concepts of the heavens and the underworld. These differ from one island to another. What they share is the view of the universe as an egg or coconut that is divided between the world of humans (earth), the upper world of heavenly gods, and the underworld. Each of these is subdivided in a manner reminiscent of [[Dante]]'s [[Divine Comedy]], but the number of divisions and their names differs from one Polynesian culture to another.&lt;ref&gt;Craig, Robert D. ''Dictionary of Polynesian Mythology''. Greenwood Press: New York, 1989. {{ISBN|0-313-25890-2}}. Page 57.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Māori ===

In [[Māori mythology]], the heavens are divided into a number of realms. Different tribes number the heaven differently, with as few as two and as many as fourteen levels. One of the more common versions divides heaven thus:

# Kiko-rangi, presided over by the gods Toumau
# Waka-maru, the heaven of sunshine and rain
# Nga-roto, the heaven of lakes where the god [[Maru (mythology)|Maru]] rules
# [[Hauora]], where the spirits of newborn children originate
# Nga-Tauira, home of the servant gods
# Nga-atua, which is ruled over by the hero [[Kaha'i|Tawhaki]]
# Autoia, where human souls are created
# Aukumea, where spirits live
# Wairua, where spirit gods live while waiting on those in
# Naherangi or Tuwarea, where the great gods live presided over by [[Rehua]]

The Māori believe these heavens are supported by pillars. Other Polynesian peoples see them being supported by gods (as in [[Hawaii]]). In one [[Tahiti]]an legend, heaven is supported by an [[octopus]].

=== Paumotu, Tuamotus ===

[[File:Paumotuheavens.gif|thumb|right|An 1869 illustration by a [[Tuamotus|Tuomatuan chief]] portraying nine heavens.]]
The Polynesian conception of the universe and its division is nicely illustrated by a famous drawing made by a [[Tuamotus|Tuomotuan]] chief in 1869. Here, the nine heavens are further divided into left and right, and each stage is associated with a stage in the evolution of the earth that is portrayed below. The lowest division represents a period when the heavens hung low over the earth, which was inhabited by animals that were not known to the islanders. In the third division is shown the first murder, the first burials, and the first canoes, built by [[Laka|Rata]]. In the fourth division, the first coconut tree and other significant plants are born.&lt;ref&gt;Young, J.L. "The Paumotu Conception of the Heavens and of Creation", ''Journal of the Polynesian Society'', 28 (1919), 209–211.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theosophy ==
{{Main article|Theosophy (Blavatskian)}}
It is believed in [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]] of [[Helena Blavatsky]] that each religion (including Theosophy) has its own individual heaven in various regions of the upper [[astral plane]] that fits the description of that heaven that is given in each religion, which a [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] that has been [[good and evil|good]] in their previous life on Earth will go to. The area of the upper astral plane of Earth in the upper atmosphere where the various heavens are located is called [[The Summerland|''Summerland'']] (Theosophists believe [[hell]] is located in the lower astral plane of Earth which extends downward from the surface of the earth down to its [[Center of the earth|center]]). However, Theosophists believe that the soul is recalled back to Earth after an average of about 1400 years by the ''[[Sanat Kumara#Sanat Kumara's cosmic bureaucracy|Lords of Karma]]'' to incarnate again. The final heaven that souls go to billions of years in the future after they finish their [[reincarnation|cycle of incarnations]] is called ''Devachan''.&lt;ref&gt;[[C.W. Leadbeater|Leadbeater, C.W.]] ''Outline of Theosophy'' Wheaton, Illinois, USA:1915 Theosophical Publishing House&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism of the belief in heaven ==
[[Anarchism|Anarchist]] [[Emma Goldman]] expressed this view when she wrote, "Consciously or unconsciously, most theists see in gods and devils, heaven and hell; reward and punishment, a whip to lash the people into obedience, meekness and contentment."&lt;ref&gt;Goldman, Emma. [http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/Anarchist_archives/goldman/philosophyatheism.html "The Philosophy of Atheism"]. ''Mother Earth'', February 1916.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many people consider [[George Orwell]]'s use of Sugarcandy Mountain in his novel ''[[Animal Farm]]'' to be a literary expression of this view. In the book, the animals were told that after their miserable lives were over they would go to a place in which "it was Sunday seven days a week, clover was in season all the year round, and lump sugar and linseed cake grew on the hedges".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.k-1.com/Orwell/site/$country=us$/opinion/essays/rhodi.html Opinions: Essays: Orwell's Political Messages] by Rhodri Williams.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.netcharles.com/orwell/articles/animal-farm-background-info.htm Background information for George Orwell's Animal Farm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061115114013/http://www.netcharles.com/orwell/articles/animal-farm-background-info.htm |date=2006-11-15 }} at Charles' George Orwell Links.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some have argued that a belief in a reward after death is poor motivation for moral behavior while alive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://daphne.palomar.edu/mlane/ATHEIST/atheist_philosophy.htm The Atheist Philosophy] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070113162422/http://daphne.palomar.edu/mlane/ATHEIST/atheist_philosophy.htm |date=January 13, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.quotedb.com/quotes/204 Quote by Albert Einstein] at Quote DB.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]] wrote, "It is rather more noble to help people purely out of concern for their suffering than it is to help them because you think the Creator of the Universe wants you to do it, or will reward you for doing it, or will punish you for not doing it. The problem with this linkage between religion and morality is that it gives people bad reasons to help other human beings when good reasons are available."&lt;ref&gt;[[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]] at the 2006 [[Beyond Belief: Science, Religion, Reason and Survival|Beyond Belief]] conference ([http://beyondbelief2006.org/watch/watch.php?Video=Session%209 watch here] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070516005026/http://beyondbelief2006.org/watch/watch.php?Video=Session%209 |date=May 16, 2007 }}).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Neuroscience ==

In [[Inside the Neolithic Mind]], Lewis-Williams and Pearce argue that a tiered structure of heaven, along with similarly structured [[Inferno (Dante)|circles of hell]], is neurally perceived by members of many cultures around the world and through history. The reports are so similar across time and space that Lewis-Williams and Pearce argue for a neuroscientific explanation, accepting the percepts as real neural activations and subjective percepts during particular [[altered states of consciousness]].

Many people who come close to death and have [[near death experience]]s report meeting relatives or entering "the Light" in an otherworldly dimension, which share similarities with the religious concept of heaven. Even though there are also reports of distressing experiences and negative life-reviews, which share some similarities with the concept of hell, the positive experiences of meeting or entering "the Light" is reported as an immensely intense feeling state of love, peace and joy beyond human comprehension. Together with this intensely positive-feeling state, people who have near death experiences also report that consciousness or a heightened state of awareness seems as if it is at the heart of experiencing a taste of "heaven".&lt;ref&gt;Jorgensen, Rene. ''Awakening After Life'' BookSurge, 2007 {{ISBN|1-4196-6347-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Postmodern views ==
* [[Mind uploading]]
* [[Omega Point (Tipler)]]

== Representations in arts ==
Works of [[fiction]] have included numerous different conceptions of heaven and hell. The two most famous descriptions of heaven are given in [[Dante Alighieri]]'s ''[[Paradiso (Dante)|Paradiso]]'' (of the ''[[Divine Comedy]]'') and [[John Milton]]'s ''[[Paradise Lost]]''.

'''Hugh I, Count of Blois''', also known as ''Hugh I of Châtillon'' (b. 1198c - d. 9 April 1248)&lt;ref name="Evergates223"&gt;Theodore Evergates, ''The Aristocracy in the County of Champagne, 1100-1300'', (University of Pennsylvania Press, 2007), 223.&lt;/ref&gt; was [[Count of Blois]] from 1230 to 1241, and [[Count of Saint Pol]] (as Hugh V) from 1226 to 1248.

Hugh was son of [[Walter III of Châtillon|Gaucher III of Châtillon]] and Elisabeth (1180–1212), daughter of [[Hugo IV, Count of Saint-Pol]].&lt;ref name="Evergates223" /&gt; He married Agnes of Bar-le-Duc, daughter of Thibaut I of Bar-le-Duc and Hermesend of Bar-sur-Seine, in 1216.&lt;ref name="Evergates223" /&gt; By 1225, Agnes was dead and Hugh married Marie.&lt;ref name="Evergates223" /&gt;

In 1226, Hugh married [[Mary, Countess of Blois|Marie of Avesnes]], daughter of [[Walter II of Avesnes]] and [[Margaret of Blois]].&lt;ref name="Evergates223" /&gt; They had 5 children:
#[[John I of Châtillon|John I]] (d. 1280), [[Count of Blois]]&lt;ref name="Evergates254"&gt;Theodore Evergates, ''The Aristocracy in the County of Champagne, 1100-1300'', 254.&lt;/ref&gt;
#[[Guy III, Count of Saint-Pol|Guy III]] (d. 1289), [[Count of Saint Pol]]&lt;ref name="Evergates254" /&gt;
#Gaucher IV (d. 1261), lord of Chatillon, [[Crécy]] and [[Crèvecœur-en-Brie|Crèvecœur]]&lt;ref name="Evergates254" /&gt;. His son was: [[Gaucher V de Châtillon]].
#Hugh (d. 1255)&lt;ref name="Evergates254" /&gt;
#Basile (d. 1280), became Abbess of Notre Dame du Val in 1248

Through his marriage Hugh became the first count of Blois from the house of Châtillon. It marked the end of the first [[dynasty]] of Blois that lasted over 400 years. After the death of Marie, Hugh married Mahaut, sister of [[Baldwin III, Count of Guînes]].

In 1226 the Cisterian nunnery Pont-aux-Dames in Couilly was founded by Hugh.&lt;ref name="Lester157-158"&gt;Anne E. Lester, ''Creating Cistercian Nuns: The Women's Religious Movement and Its Reform in Thirteenth Century Champagne'', (Cornell University Press, 2011), 157-158.&lt;/ref&gt; Later Hugh, with the assistance of Philip Mécringes, founded a Cistercian nunnery at Troissy called ''L'Amour-Dieu'' in 1232.&lt;ref name="Lester157-158" /&gt;

Hugh intended to follow the pious king [[Louis IX of France|Louis IX]] when he started on the [[Seventh Crusade]], but he died in 1248.&lt;ref name="Lester157-158"  /&gt;

'''Hugo Fidel Cázares''' (born March 24, 1978 in [[Los Mochis]], [[Sinaloa]], [[Mexico]]) is a [[southpaw]] professional [[boxing|boxer]] in the [[Super flyweight]] (115 [[pound (mass)|lb]]) division. He is the former WBA Super Flyweight champion, WBO and [[Lineal championship|Lineal]] Light Flyweight champion. His record is 35-7-2 (23 [[knockout|KOs]]).

==Junior Flyweight division==
On April 30, 2005, Cazares won the [[World Boxing Organization|WBO]] and vacant [[Lineal championship|Lineal]] junior flyweight titles by defeating reigning WBO champion [[Nelson Dieppa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cyberboxingzone.com/boxing/jrfly.htm|title=Hugo Cázares - Lineal Jr. Flyweight Champion|publisher=The Cyber Boxing Zone Encyclopedia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cazares defended the title twice in 2005, against former champion [[Alex Sánchez (boxer)|Alex Sánchez]] and Kaichon Sor Vorapin. In 2006, he defended the title two additional times against Domingo Guillen and a rematch with Dieppa. In 2006, he successfully defended his title for a fifth time against Wilfrido Valdez.

In his next bout, Cazares lost the WBO junior flyweight title by split decision to [[Iván Calderón (boxer)|Iván Calderón]] in Calderon's home territory of Puerto Rico. Cazares dropped Calderon in the 8th round. Cazares then defeated former champion [[Kermin Guardia]] before facing Calderon in a rematch. Cazares lost the rematch by technical decision in the 7th round after Calderon sustained a cut from an accidental clash of heads.

==Super Flyweight division==
Cazares then moved up two divisions and scored three straight victories, including a win over former champion [[Roberto Vasquez]]. On September 30, 2009, Cazares faced WBA Super Flyweight champion [[Nobuo Nashiro]]. The bout ended in a 12-round draw. The two faced off in a rematch, this time Cazares defeated Nashiro by unanimous decision as he captured the WBA Super Flyweight title. Cázares successfully defended his title three times in 2010 with victories over Everardo Morales, Alberto Rossel, and Hiroyuki Hisataka.

===Carl Frampton vs Hugo Cazares===
After Hugo's defeat to [[Tomonobu Shimizu]], he won five fights in a row over, Adnan Garcia, Daniel Diaz, Rey Perez, Gabriel Altarejos and [[Julio Cesar Miranda]].

On the 4th of April 2014, Hugo Cazares came to undefeated [[Carl Frampton]]'s home city of [[Belfast]] in [[Northern Ireland]] and faced him in a final eliminator for [[Leo Santa Cruz]]'s [[World Boxing Council|WBC]] Super-Bantamweight World Championship, in the [[Odyssey Arena]] in front of an estimated crowd of 9,000 fans.

Hugo entered to [[Maroon 5]]'s song, "One More Night" and received a largely hostile reception from the pro-Frampton  [[Belfast]] crowd. Unfortunately for Hugo Cazares, his night ended early as he lost to [[Carl Frampton]] by [[KO]] in the 2nd Round.

'''Hussein Sheikh Abdirahman''' (1941 – c. May 16, 2016) was a Somali judge and politician. Abdirahman served as the [[Ministry of Defence (Somalia)|Minister of Defence]] from 1989 to 1990 under [[President of Somalia|President]] [[Siad Barre]].&lt;ref name=hiiraan&gt;{{cite news|first=|last=|title=Former Somali defense minister dies in US  |url=http://www.hiiraan.com/news4/2016/May/105490/former_somali_defense_minister_dies_in_us.aspx |work=Hiiraan Online |date=2016-05-17 |accessdate=2016-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the first [[civilian]] to be appointed Minister of Defence during the Barre regime, as all of Abdirahman's predecessors had been members of the [[Somali Armed Forces|military]].&lt;ref name=hiiraan/&gt;

Abdirahman was born in 1941 in [[Aware, Ethiopia|Aware]], a town in the [[Aware (woreda)|Aware]] [[Districts of Ethiopia|district]] of [[Somali Region]], [[Ethiopia]].&lt;ref name=hiiraan/&gt;

Abdirahman spent much of his career working in Somalia's justice system before entering politics. At various times during his career, Abdirahman served as the chief of the [[magistrates court]] of [[Mogadishu]], Attorney General, the commissioner of [[Sanaag]] region, and the chief of the [[appeals court]] of [[Mudug]] region.&lt;ref name=hiiraan/&gt;

Abdirahman's judicial career was noticed by President Siad Barre, the leader of the country's [[military junta]].&lt;ref name=hiiraan/&gt; In 1989, Barre appointed Abdirahman as Defence Minister, becoming the first civilian to head the defence ministry under Barre's rule.&lt;ref name=hiiraan/&gt; The appointment of Abdirahman sparked criticism against Barre, because Abdirahman had no military experience at the time.&lt;ref name=hiiraan/&gt; Abdirahman headed the Ministry of Defence from 1989 until 1990.

In 1991, Abdirahman immigrated from Somalia to the [[United States]] following the collapse of Barre's rule.&lt;ref name=hiiraan/&gt; He settled in [[Minnesota]], where he became a community leader for the [[Somali American]] community in [[Minneapolis]], as well as around the U.S.&lt;ref name=hiiraan/&gt;

Abdirahman died at a hospital in the [[Minneapolis]], [[Minnesota]], after being hospitalized for several months.&lt;ref name=hiiraan/&gt; His family announced his death on Monday, May 16, 2016.&lt;ref name=hiiraan/&gt;

'' '''Independence''' '', a 35-ton [[schooner]], was the first ship constructed in [[South Australia]]n waters. The crew of the visiting American sealing brig {{ship||Union|1802 ship|2}}, under the command of Capt. [[Isaac Pendleton]], built her between April and August 1803 at what is now known as [[American River, South Australia|American River]] on [[Kangaroo Island]]. Daniel Wright, the ship's carpenter, was in charge of the construction of ''Independence''.

On 15 June 1805, ''Independence'' set sail from Sydney for the [[Antipodes Islands]] and was never seen again. The ''[[Sydney Gazette]]'' reported the loss on 16 March 1806.

==Prehistory==
In 1802, Capt. [[Isaac Pendleton]] of Stonington, Connecticut was commissioned by [[Fanning &amp; Coles]] of New York to sail ''Union'' to the waters of [[New Holland (Australia)|New Holland]] in search of seal skins. "Her commander (Captain Isaac Pendleton) was …left unrestricted, and at perfect liberty to act on all occasions as his judgment should direct, to make the most profitable voyage he could of it for his owners."&lt;ref&gt;Fanning 1989:230-231 quoted in Dappert &amp; Moffatt 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In early 1803, whilst sealing in [[King George Sound]] near what is now [[Albany, Western Australia]] Pendleton met the French explorer, [[Nicolas Baudin]], who recommended [[Kangaroo Island]] as a place where seals could be found in plenitude.

Arriving in what is now known as [[Eastern Cove (South Australia)|Eastern Cove]] on the north coast of Kangaroo Island, Pendleton took the decision to winter here and, presumably to increase the quantity of skins that could be taken to Sydney, construct a smaller vessel to work alongside ''Union'' in its sealing activities.

==Construction==
As was common practice at the time, ''Union'' carried the frame of a small schooner. This, possibly with the addition of some locally sourced timber, was used to build a smaller vessel. It appears&lt;ref&gt;Dappert &amp; Moffat 2007&lt;/ref&gt; that Baudin had lost a longboat whilst surveying the coastline of Kangaroo Island and his carpenters had found suitable timber to rebuild the longboat near what is now the town of American River. As the new vessel was to be smaller than ''Union'', it would have better access to shallow waters. Thus was born ''Independence''.

No plans of ''Independence'' are known to exist. In fact, it is possible the original ''Independence'' was built without plans.

==Reconstruction==
In May 2013, the Rebuild Independence Group, a volunteer group based in [[American River, South Australia|American River]], was formed to set about reconstructing the ''Independence''.&lt;ref name=RIG&gt;{{cite web|title=Rebuild Independence |url=http://www.rebuildindependence.org/home|work=|publisher=Rebuild Independence Group (RIG)|accessdate=26 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He represented [[Dufferin (provincial electoral district)|Dufferin]] in the [[Legislative Assembly of Ontario]] from 1875 to 1879, from 1890 to 1894 and from 1898 to 1904 and in the [[House of Commons of Canada]] from 1904 to 1909 as a [[Conservative Party of Canada (historical)|Conservative]] member. From 1890 to 1894, he was a member of the provincial Conservative Equal Rights Party.

He was born near Elizabethtown (later [[Brockville, Ontario|Brockville]]) in [[Canada West]] in 1843, the son of [[Ireland|Irish]] immigrants. He graduated as an [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] from [[Victoria University in the University of Toronto|Victoria University]] in 1866. Barr served as an associated [[coroner]] for [[Grey County, Ontario|Grey County]]. He was Deputy Master in the South Grey County [[Orange Lodge]]. Barr first set up practice in Horning's Mills but later moved to [[Shelburne, Ontario|Shelburne]]. In 1880, he married Ermina E. Palmer. After being reelected in 1879, he was unseated after an appeal. He was later reelected several times to the provincial and federal assemblies. He died in office in 1909.

'''''Le Juif errant''''' (''The [[Wandering Jew]]'') is a [[grand opera]] by [[Fromental Halévy]], with a [[libretto]] by [[Eugène Scribe]] and [[Jules-Henri Vernoy de Saint-Georges]].

The opera is based extremely loosely on themes of the novel ''[[Le Juif Errant|Le Juif errant]]'', by [[Eugène Sue]]. Whilst the novel is set in 19th century Paris and the Wandering Jew is incidental to the main story-line, the opera begins in Amsterdam in 1190 and the Jew Ahasuerus, (spelled Ashvérus&lt;ref&gt;Sue's spelling of the name was 'Ahasvérus', a version also used by [[Edgar Quinet]]. However, Scribe's version of the name can be found in earlier literature (e.g. [https://archive.org/stream/ahasvrus00quingoog#page/n10/mode/1up in 1834])&lt;/ref&gt; in the opera), is a leading character.

==Performance history==
''Le Juif errant'' was premiered at the [[Salle Le Peletier]] of the [[Paris Opera]] on 23 April 1852, and had 48 further performances over two seasons. The music was sufficiently popular to generate a ''Wandering Jew [[Mazurka]]'', a ''Wandering Jew [[Waltz]]'', a ''Wandering Jew [[Polka]]''&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, (1991), p. 259.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- in the United States? This could presumably also be confirmed at memory.loc.gov/ammem/mussmquery.html even more easily! --&gt; and in France just in the several months after the opera was premiered an even more considerable quantity of piano works, including several "Grande fantaisie dramatique" and similar titles, based on the opera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/BibliographieDeLaFrance1852Bibliographie/Bibliographie_de_la_France_1852_bibliographie_bnf-OCR#page/n1129/mode/2up|title=Bibliographie de la France (1852): bibliographie|publisher=|accessdate=22 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''lemures'' can be traced to the [[Proto-Indo-European language|PIE]] stem *''{{PIE|lem-}}'', which also appears in the name of the Greek monster [[Lamia]].&lt;ref name="eiec"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |first1=Edgar C. |last1=Polomé |first2=Douglas Q. |last2=Adams |editor-first1=J.

==Description==
''Lemures'' may represent the wandering and [[vengeful spirit]]s of those not afforded proper burial, funeral rites or affectionate cult by the living: they are not attested by tomb or votive inscriptions. Ovid interprets them as vagrant, unsatiated and potentially vengeful ''[[Manes|di manes]]'' or ''[[parentalia|di parentes]]'', ancestral gods or spirits of the underworld. To him, the rites of their cult suggest an incomprehensibly archaic, quasi-magical and probably very ancient rural tradition.

''Lemures'' were formless and liminal, associated with darkness and its dread. In [[Roman Republic|Republican]] and [[Roman Empire|Imperial Rome]], May 9, 11, and 13 were dedicated to their placation in the household practices of ''Lemuralia'' or ''[[Lemuria (festival)|Lemuria]]''. The head of household (''[[paterfamilias]]'') would rise at midnight and cast black beans behind him with averted gaze; the ''Lemures'' were presumed to feast on them. Black was the appropriate colour for offerings to [[chthonic]] deities. [[William Warde Fowler]] interprets the gift of beans as an offer of life, and points out that they were a ritual pollution for priests of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]].&lt;ref&gt;W. Warde Fowler, ''The Roman Festivals of the period of the Republic'', MacMillan (New York, 1899) – available at Questia: see ''Mensis Maius'', 106–10: [https://www.questia.com/read/23313966?title=The%20Roman%20Festivals%20of%20the%20Period%20of%20the%20Republic%3a%20An%20Introduction%20to%20the%20Study%20of%20the%20Religion%20of%20the%20Romans]&lt;/ref&gt; The ''lemures'' themselves were both fearsome and fearful: any malevolent shades dissatisfied with the offering of the ''paterfamilias'' could be startled into flight by the loud banging of bronze pots.&lt;ref&gt;Thaniel, G. (1973). Lemures and Larvae, ''The American Journal of Philology'', 94.2, 182–187.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Beard, M., North, J., Price, S. (1998). ''Religions of Rome'', Vol 1, 31, 50, Cambridge.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In scientific Latin==
The Lemures inspired [[Carl Linnaeus|Linnaeus]]'s Modern Latin backformation [[Lemur]] (denoting a type of primates).  According to Linnaeus' own explanation, the name was selected because of the nocturnal activity and slow movements of the slender loris.&lt;ref&gt;A.R. Dunkel, J.S. Zijlstra, and C.P. Groves, C.P. (2011/2012). "Giant Rabbits, Marmosets, and British Comedies: Etymology of Lemur Names, part 1" Lemur News 16 (2100/12) 64–70. ISSN 1608-1439.[http://www.aeecl.org/lemurnews/lemurnews2011_16.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Being familiar with the works of [[Virgil]] and [[Ovid]] and seeing an analogy that fit with his naming scheme, Linnaeus adapted the term "lemur" for these nocturnal primates.&lt;ref&gt;W. Blunt and W.T. Stearn, ''Linnaeus: The Compleat Naturalist'' (Princeton University Press, 2002), p. 252. 978-0-691-09636-0&lt;/ref&gt; However, it has been commonly and falsely assumed that Linnaeus was referring to the ghost-like appearance, [[Tapetum lucidum|reflective eyes]], and ghostly cries of lemurs.&lt;ref&gt;Dunkel et. al, "Giant Rabbits, Marmosets, and British Comedies," p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Goethe]]'s ''[[Goethe's Faust|Faust]]'', a chorus of Lemurs who serve [[Mephistopheles]] dig Faustus' grave.&lt;ref&gt; Goethe, ''Faust'' 11515-11611.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In English Daemonologie==
{{main|Daemonologie}}
In the book by King James I of England, ''Daemonologie, In Forme of a Dialogie, Divided into three Bookes'' ''(Daemonologie)'', it is written, "Nowe I returne to my purpose: As to the first kinde of these spirites, that were called by the auncients by diuers names, according as their actions were. For if they were spirites that haunted some houses, by appearing in diuers and horrible formes, and making greate dinne: they were called ''Lemures'' or ''Spectra''. If they appeared in likenesse of anie defunct to some friends of his, they wer called ''vmbræ mortuorum'': And so innumerable stiles they got, according to their actiones, as I haue said alreadie. As we see by experience, how manie stiles they haue given them in our language in the like maner: Of the appearing of these spirites, wee are certified by the Scriptures, [marginal note - ''Esay''. 13. ''Iere''. 50] where the Prophet ESAY 13. and 34. cap. threatening the destruction of ''Babell'' and ''Edom'': declares, that it shal not onlie be wracked, but shall become so greate a solitude, as it shall be the habitackle of Howlettes, and of ZIIM and IIM, which are the proper Hebrewe names for these Spirites. The cause whie they haunte solitarie places, it is by reason, that they may affraie and brangle the more the faith of suche as them alone hauntes such places. For our nature is such, as in companies wee are not so soone mooued to anie such kinde of feare, as being solitare, which the Deuill knowing well inough, hee will not therefore assaile vs but when we are weake: And besides that, GOD will not permit him so to dishonour the societies and companies of Christians, as in publicke times and places to walke visiblie amongst them. On the other parte, when he troubles certaine houses that are dwelt in, it is a sure token either of grosse ignorance, or of some grosse and slanderous sinnes amongst the inhabitantes thereof: which God by that extraordinarie rod punishes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=King James I of England|title=Daemonologie, In Forme of a Dialogie, Divided into three Bookes|date=1603|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/25929}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Florence Linda Agostini''' ({{née|'''Platt'''}}; 12 September 1905{{spaced ndash}}27 August 1934), known posthumously as the "'''Pyjama Girl'''", was an English Australian homicide victim found on a stretch of road in [[Albury]], [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]], in September 1934.

==Life==
Linda Agostini was born Florence Linda Platt in [[Forest Hill, London|Forest Hill]], a suburb of [[South London|South East London]], on 12 September 1905. As a teenager, Platt worked at a confectionery store in [[Surrey]] before travelling to [[New Zealand]] at the age of 19 after what was rumoured to be a broken romance.  Platt remained in New Zealand until 1927 when she moved to Australia to live in [[Sydney]].&lt;ref name=adb&gt;{{Citation  | first=Bruce   | last=Pennay   | title =Agostini, Linda (1905 - 1934)    | publisher =[[Australian National University]]  | work=[[Australian Dictionary of Biography]]  | url =http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A130703b.htm | accessdate = 2007-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; There she worked at a movie theatre in the city and lived in a boarding house on Darlinghurst Road in [[Kings Cross, New South Wales|Kings Cross]] where accounts tell she entertained young, attractive men. Platt was a heavy drinker and a [[Jazz Age]] party-goer who had difficulty adjusting to stability. Her marriage to Italian-born Antonio Agostini (1903-1969) in a Sydney registry office during 1930 was the beginning of an unhappy marriage that would see the couple leave for [[Melbourne]] to remove Linda from the influence of her Sydney friends.

==Discovery and initial investigation==
Agostini disappeared from friends and family in late August 1934, around a week before the unidentified Pyjama Girl was found in Splitter's Creek, near [[Albury]], on the [[New South Wales]] side of the border with [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]].

The victim's body was discovered by a local man named Tom Griffith.  Griffith had been leading a prize bull along the side of Howlong Road near Albury when he saw the body in a [[culvert]] running under the road and noticed a strong smell of kerosene. Slightly concealed and badly burnt, the body would not have been visible to anybody driving by.

The victim's head was wrapped in a towel. She had been shot and badly beaten. In a detail that came to define the case, she was wearing yellow silk pyjamas with a Chinese dragon motif – in [[Great Depression in Australia|Depression-era Australia]], such clothing was luxurious, youthful and bohemian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media| medium=Motion Picture| title=Australia Today – The Pyjama Girl Murder Case| year=1939| url=http://aso.gov.au/titles/newsreels/australia-today-pyjama-girl/clip1/| publisher=[[Australian Screen Online]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It soon became apparent that the body was of a petite woman in her twenties, but her identity could not be established.  After the initial investigation failed to identify her, the body was taken to [[Sydney]] where it was put on public exhibition. She was preserved in a bath of [[formalin]] for this purpose at the Sydney University Medical School, until 1942, when her body was transferred to police headquarters where it remained until 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title='Pyjama girl' murderer sentenced| work=Australia Through Time| edition=7th| publisher=Random House Australia| year=1999| isbn=978-0091838157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several names were suggested for the identity of the dead woman, among them Anna Philomena Morgan and Linda Agostini. Both women were missing, both bore a likeness to the Pyjama Girl and both were of the right age.  However, New South Wales police satisfied themselves that neither of the missing women was the Pyjama Girl and she remained unidentified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=The Pyjama Girl murder| work=[[The Daily Telegraph (Sydney)|The Daily Telegraph]]| date=5 November 2015| url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/special-features/the-pyjama-girl-murder/story-fnknbqfy-1227591025452| subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 2004 book ''The Pyjama Girl Mystery: A True Story of Murder, Obsession and Lies'', historian Richard Evans suggests that Agostini was murdered around the same time as the Albury victim, and most likely in the confines of the couple's Melbourne townhouse, but that she was not the Pyjama Girl.&lt;ref name=AHN&gt;{{cite journal| first=Alexandra| last=Heller-Nicholas| title=The Unknown Soldier of the War Against Women| work=[[Overland (magazine)|Overland]]| date=30 July 2014| url=https://overland.org.au/2014/07/the-unknown-soldier-of-the-war-against-women/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reopening of the case==
In 1944, ten years after the body had been discovered, the forensic evidence was re-examined and the [[Forensic dentistry|dental analysis]] of the victim was matched to Linda Agostini.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt;

Tony Agostini had recently returned to Sydney after being held in internment camps at [[Orange, New South Wales|Orange]], [[Hay, New South Wales|Hay]] and [[Loveday, South Australia|Loveday]] from 1940 to 1944. The [[police commissioner]], William MacKay, who had known him before the war when he worked as a waiter at the restaurant that MacKay frequented, interviewed him. Noticing that Agostini seemed to be in a nervous state, MacKay asked him what had come over him. Tony Agostini then confessed to killing his wife.

In his statement, Agostini admitted that he had accidentally shot and killed his wife when they were living in Melbourne. Worried that he might be accused of murder, he had driven the body over the state border to Albury and had dumped it in the culvert. He had poured [[petrol]] over the body and set fire to it, to destroy the evidence.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt;

The identification came just as public confidence in the New South Wales Police Force began to wane at their failure to catch the decade's most prolific killer. The circumstances under which Antonio Agostini "confessed" to killing his wife in their Melbourne townhouse are still very dubious today.

The arrest of Agostini was a sensation, as it meant that the Pyjama Girl had been identified. He was charged with murder and was extradited to Melbourne, where he was tried for murder. He was acquitted but was found guilty of manslaughter instead, and was sentenced to six years' imprisonment. He was released in 1948 and deported to [[Italy]], where he died in 1969.

==New evidence==
The case might have been left there, but Richard Evans, a Melbourne historian, casts doubt on its conclusion. In his 2004 book ''The Pyjama Girl Mystery: A True Story of Murder, Obsession and Lies'', Evans points out discrepancies with the evidence, calling Antonio Agostini's conviction the result of "police corruption and a miscarriage of justice".&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Richard (2004). ''The Pyjama Girl Mystery'' (1st ed.). Scribe Publications Pty Ltd. {{ISBN|978-1920769369}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pyjama Girl had brown eyes; Agostini's were blue. The victim had a different bust size to that of Linda Agostini and Agostini had a different shaped nose.

Evans points out that 125 women were originally on the police's list of possible identities, but that these other leads remained "uneliminated and untraced".&lt;ref name=AHN/&gt;

==Adaptations==
The case was turned into a short film, ''[[The Pyjama Girl Murder Case]]'' in 1939 by director [[Rupert Kathner]].

A film entitled ''[[La ragazza dal pigiama giallo]]'' (''The Pyjama Girl Case''), directed by Italian [[Flavio Mogherini]], was produced in 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0075834/| title=La ragazza dal pigiama giallo| publisher=[[Internet Movie Database]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; A book written by [[Hugh Atkinson (novelist)|Hugh Geddes]], based on the film and bearing the same title, appeared in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;Geddes, Hugh, ''The Pyjama Girl Case'', Sun Books Pty., Ltd., {{ISBN|0-7251-0299-3}}, Melbourne, 1978&lt;/ref&gt;

A short film by Canberra film maker Huck Tyrrell, entitled ''Roadside'', was produced in 1998 and inspired by the murder. In the film the victim returns as a hitch-hiker who tells her story to the unsuspecting driver and eventually leads him to her remains.

In 2013, the [[HotHouse Theatre|Hothouse Theatre]] in Albury/Wodonga commissioned a play entitled ''The Pyjama Girl'' from Canberra playwright Emma Gibson which it performed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Commissions| url=http://www.hothousetheatre.com.au/artistic-development/commissions/| publisher=HotHouse Theatre| accessdate=14 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many notable human fatalities have resulted from [[aviation accidents and incidents]].

Those killed as part of a sporting, political or entertainment group who flew together when the accident took place are usually only listed under the group sections; however, some are also listed as individuals.

==Background==

The British incarcerated her and her mother (Elizabeth Cecilia van Zyl)&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; in a concentration camp following the refusal of her father, Hermanus Egbert Pieter van Zyl&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;, a [[Boer]] Commando combatant, to surrender. Because of her father's refusal to surrender, Lizzie and her mother were labled as 'undesirables', and placed on the lowest food rations. Activist [[Emily Hobhouse]] used her death as an example of the hardships the Boer women and children faced in the British concentration camps during the war. She describes Lizzie as "a frail, weak little child in desperate need of good care", who was placed on the lowest rations and, after a month, was moved to the new hospital about {{convert|50|km|mi|abbr=off}} away from the concentration camp, suffering from starvation.  Initially the publishers of Hobhouse's reports refused to publish the photograph.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

According to Hobhouse, she was treated harshly in the hospital. Unable to speak English, she was labelled an "idiot" by an English-speaking doctor and her nurses, who were unable to understand her. One day she started calling for her mother; a lady went over to comfort her, but "was brusquely interrupted by one of the nurses who told her not to interfere with the child as she was a nuisance." Lizzie died in 1901 at seven years of age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boer.co.za/boerwar/hellkamp.htm|title=The Concentration Camps|publisher=Boer.co.za|date=21 May 1995|accessdate=3 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Photo==

The photo of the emaciated van Zyl reportedly was passed from British author [[Arthur Conan Doyle]], who served as a volunteer doctor during the Boer War, to [[Joseph Chamberlain]].&lt;ref name="lewis"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbctransgenerational.com/articles.html |title=Lizzy van Zyl |author=Hélène Opperman Lewis |accessdate=25 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both Doyle and Chamberlain were proponents of the Boer Wars; Doyle wrote a short work ''The War in South Africa: Its Cause and Conduct'', that justified the war.

The photo was used as [[propaganda]], author Hélène Opperman Lewis states, to convince the British public that Boer children were neglected by their parents. The image was released with the detail that it was taken when van Zyl and her mother entered the camp. Chamberlain was quoted in ''[[The Times]]'' on 5 March 1902, saying that Lizzie's mother was prosecuted for mistreatment.&lt;ref name="lewis"/&gt; 

Hobhouse investigated the case and was unable to find any evidence of the case or prosecution of Lizzie's mother. She located the photographer, a man named Mr. de Klerk (also a camp inmate at the time),&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; who confirmed that the photograph was taken two months after Lizzie had arrived at the camp.&lt;ref name="lewis"/&gt;

'''Luke the Dog''' (1913-1926) was a [[Staffordshire Bull Terrier]] that performed as a recurring character in American silent comedy [[Short film|shorts]] between 1914 and 1920. He was also the personal pet of actress [[Minta Durfee]] and her husband, the comedian and director [[Roscoe Arbuckle|Roscoe "Fatty" Arbuckle]].&lt;ref name="Dog Actors"&gt;Admin. (2012). [http://dogactors.com/2012/luke-the-pitbull/  Luke the Pitbull",] December 26, 2012. Dog Actors: Dogs on the Big Screen; retrieved September 16, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In the early 1900s, before the [[American Kennel Club]] officially recognized the types of dogs in the United States commonly referred to as "[[pit bulls]]", Luke's breed was identified as an Irish or English Staffordshire Bull Terrier.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Although Luke never attained the stardom of the various dogs that portrayed  [[Rin Tin Tin]], [[Pete the Pup]], or [[Lassie]], he accomplished stunts on camera that those later canine colleagues may have found difficult or impossible to duplicate. Luke for six years gained widespread popularity among movie audiences, appearing in [[Film reel|one-]] and [[Film reel|two-reelers]] for [[Keystone Studios]], Comique Film Company, and Joseph M. Schenck Productions.&lt;ref name="Luke IMDb"&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1832937/ "Luke the Dog",] [[Internet Movie Database]] (IMDb), a subsidiary of [[Amazon.com]], Seattle, Washington; retrieved September 16, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; The bull terrier shared screen time not only with Arbuckle and Durfee but also with other stars and top supporting players of the silent era, including [[Mabel Normand]], [[Buster Keaton]], [[Al St. John]], [[Molly Malone (actress)|Molly Malone]], [[Joe Roberts]],  [[Betty Compson]], and [[Edgar Kennedy]].

==Early life==
Luke the Dog was born in late 1913, reportedly at the home of film director [[Wilfred Lucas]] in [[Los Angeles, California]]. It was there where Minta Durfee and Roscoe Arbuckle were said to have acquired Luke as a six-week-old puppy.&lt;ref name="Dog Actors"/&gt; Several sources about the dog's early life state that Director Lucas gave the puppy to Minta in lieu of extra money or hazard pay she had earned for performing a dangerous stunt while filming.&lt;ref name="Dog Actors"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Arbuckle's Dog"&gt;Kelly, Kate. [http://americacomesalive.com/2015/07/07/roscoe-fatty-arbuckles-dog-luke/ "Roscoe (Fatty) Arbuckle’s Dog, Luke",] America Comes Alive! New York; retrieved September 15, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of those same sources also state that Minta and Roscoe even named their new pet after the tight-fisted director, dubbing him Luke as a familiar form of "Lucas"&lt;ref name="Arbuckle's Dog"/&gt; The cited timing of the dog's birth in the latter part of 1913 seems consistent with Luke's physical appearance in his film debut in the short ''[[Lover's Luck]]'', released in mid-September 1914 and likely completed in August that year.&lt;ref name="Luke IMDb"/&gt; In the "[[Film reel|one-reeler]]", which features both Roscoe and Minta, Luke can be seen in the background in several scenes, tethered next to his doghouse. Luke's size in the short shows a dog of his breed nearing maturity.&lt;ref&gt;[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=rZm0hdDqQTM "Lover's Luck (1914) Al St. John - Roscoe Arbuckle",] posted by Al St. John Official, YouTube; retrieved September 17, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film career==
While Luke was originally given to Minta Durfee, Roscoe Arbuckle quickly became the dominant figure in the dog's daily life, for it was "Fatty" who invested the most time training the animal to do tricks.&lt;ref name="Salute to Luke"&gt;"Lea" (2017).

He has one very brief scene in that 1915 one-reeler, but at least the young dog is no longer relegated to the background. In the scene he quietly sits on a bench and receives a few affectionate pats from [[Mabel Normand]] as she goes into her backyard to hang laundry. In Luke's third film, ''[[Fatty's Faithful Fido]]'', released just two months after ''Mabel and Fatty's Wash Day'', he is finally allowed to display the success of his training and his remarkable athleticism.&lt;ref name="Arbuckle's Dog"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ben Mankiewicz, [https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=ClDoHUCvrYw "shorts featuring dogs tcm intro, middle, outro",] Turner Classic Movies (TCM), posted by tcmfanatic.

[[File:Luke_and_St._John,_Fatty's_Faithful_Fido,_1915.jpg|thumb|left|Luke catches [[Al St. John]] on a rooftop and refuses to release him in ''Fatty's Faithful Fido'', 1915.]]Luke performs a series of stunts in ''[[Fatty's Faithful Fido]]'' that are among the most impressive of his career. He gives chase to fellow cast member [[Al St. John]], who in the one-reeler plays Fatty's rival for the attention of a young woman portrayed by Minta. After repeated confrontations with his competitor, Fatty sics Luke on him. St. John's character panics and flees, but he cannot get away from the dog no matter what he does.&lt;ref name="Fido"&gt;[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=EfohcqwCilg ""Fatty's Faithful Fido" -- Keystone Comedy (March 20, 1915)",] posted by Matt Barry, YouTube; retrieved September 15, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Luke during the chase climbs a tall ladder propped against a wall, missteps and plunges off a building's roof, recovers, crosses another ladder between rooftops, jumps from one roof to another, grabs the coat of Fatty's rival in his teeth and tears it off his body, and then grabs the desperate man's necktie and starts choking him. St. John finally manages to escape but only when Luke is distracted by a passing cat. Soon, though, the dog resumes tracking his two-legged quarry. Later in the day Luke finally finds St. John at a community dance and charges into the event after him. The film ends with the dog, St. John, and Fatty falling through a hole in the floor and landing together in a large laundry tub of water.&lt;ref name="Fido"/&gt;


Luke has his longest screen time in a single film in ''[[Fatty's Plucky Pup]]'', also released in 1915.&lt;ref name="TCMPlucky"&gt;[https://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/552780/Fatty-s-Plucky-Pup/articles.html ''Fatty's Plucky Pup'',] Turner Classic Movies (TCM), [[Turner Broadcasting System]], a subsidiary of Time Warner, New York, N.Y.; retrieved September 20, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; He performs in almost every scene of the 26-minute two-reeler.&lt;ref name="IMDbPup"&gt;[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=v8bdWalp2Yk "Roscoe 'Fatty' Arbuckle~Fatty's Plucky Pup~1915 Keystone Film/Fotoplayer Soundtrack",] YouTube; retrieved September 20, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; In the short's first part, Luke proves to be an elusive terror for two [[dogcatcher]]s trying to capture him with large nets; and in its second part he rescues Fatty's girlfriend Lizzie from a pair of crooks, who kidnap her with the help of the same two dogcatchers.&lt;ref name="TCMPlucky"/&gt; The "plucky pup" tracks the crooks; turns the tables on the dogcatchers by becoming their pursuer; and finally leads Fatty to save Lizzie in the nick of time, which also leads a carload of bumbling [[Keystone Cops]] to arrest the evil foursome.&lt;ref name="IMDbPup"/&gt; One of the interesting visual effects used in ''Fatty's Plucky Pup'' relied on the use of a [[treadmill]] in combination with the [[carousel]]-like "[[cyclorama]]" often used by cameramen at Keystone Studios' facilities in [[Edendale, Los Angeles, California|Edendale, California]].&lt;ref name="Cyclorama"&gt;[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=FiZiLXDfgas "Mack Sennett's Cyclorama on Glendale Blvd @ Effie",] posted by ValleySpringLaneHC, YouTube; a film clip showing the cyclorama (around 1915) operating at [[Mack Sennett]]'s Keystone Studios; retrieved September 20, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; There are sequences in the short that show Luke in close-up and running at breakneck speed through the countryside. The dog in reality is running on a treadmill positioned between a stationary camera and the cyclorama's rotating platform that has background scenery painted on a huge central cylinder. The cyclorama, which can be seen in operation at Keystone in a surviving period film clip, creates an effective but cartoonish simulation that Luke is dashing across the landscape.&lt;ref name="Cyclorama"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The top rotational speed of the cyclorama could not match the top running speed of Luke for filming by a stationary camera. Given the speed that the dog demonstrated on film, a treadmill was likely positioned  in front of the cyclorama to produce the noted visual effect, including the sequence of Fatty cycling past Luke.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In a later short, ''The Butcher Boy'' in 1917, Luke is shown running on a treadmill in a segment titled [https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=O0AD8___Aq4 "A job for Luke".] YouTube; retrieved September 22, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:The_Cook,_1918,_with_Arbuckle,_Luke,_and_Keaton.jpg|thumb|right|Roscoe "Fatty" Arbuckle, Luke, and [[Buster Keaton]] in ''The Cook'', 1918]]
[[File:Fatty and Mabel Adrift 1916.jpg|thumb|left|Luke's popularity with audiences had risen to a point by 1916 that the stunt dog was included on a theater poster promoting the Keystone short ''Fatty and Mabel Adrift''.]] By 1916, Luke began to demonstrate that his athletic abilities were not limited to racing on the ground and vaulting through the air; he was equally proficient in water. Playing Arbuckle's faithful companion again in the two-reeler ''[[Fatty and Mabel Adrift]]'', Luke chases Fatty's frequent nemesis, Al St. John, into the ocean, not hesitating to dive into the surf and pursue the villain well past the breaking waves and into deeper water. Later in the film, Luke swims beachward to get help for Fatty and Mabel, whose honeymoon seaside cottage has been set adrift and is sinking.&lt;ref&gt;[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=lLidW6gKRVk "''Fatty and Mabel Adrift'' (1916)",] posted by "A cinema history" and available for free viewing by the general public on YouTube; retrieved September 15, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the completion of ''Fatty and Mabel Adrift'', Arbuckle left Keystone Studios to make films independently. Luke, of course, followed Roscoe and continued to appear in such films as ''[[The Butcher Boy (1917 film)|The Butcher Boy]]'' (1917), ''[[The Cook]]'' (1918), and ''[[The Hayseed]]'' (1919). In its review of ''The Butcher Boy'' in April 1917, the entertainment trade publication ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' complimented the film and observed, "The cast fits the star [Arbuckle], and not the least important member is 'Luke,' the bull terrier. It is a wonder."&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/variety46-1917-04#page/n123/mode/2up Film Reviews: ''The Butcher Boy'',] ''Variety'' (New York, N.Y.), April 20, 1917, page 24.

Luke's reliability and experience as a performer earned him a top salary during his career of $150 a week, the equivalent of over $3,100 a week in the year 2017.&lt;ref&gt;Article about [http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/161697|0/Fatty-s-Faithful-Fido.html ''Fatty's Faithful Fido'',] TCM; retrieved September 18, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm "CPI Inflation Calculator",] Bureau of Labor Statistics, United States Department of Labor, Washington, D.C.; retrieved September 18, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; His last two performances were in 1920, both uncredited: ''[[The Garage (1920 film)|The Garage]]'' with Arbuckle and Fatty's comedic protégé Buster Keaton and ''[[The Scarecrow (1920 film)|The Scarecrow]]'' with only Keaton.&lt;ref name="IMDb Luke"/&gt; In those final shorts, a stockier, more muscular Luke continues to display his considerable prowess as a man-chaser. Keaton's character in ''The Scarecrow'' runs from what he mistakenly thinks is a [[Rabies|rabid]] dog, which he had seen "frothing" at the mouth. Actually, Luke had just eaten a cream pie and remnants of the cream remained around his snout. When Keaton dashes away, the "mad" dog relentlessly pursues him over brick walls, up ladders again, around the top of a building, over planks, through windows, down a garbage chute, and through haystacks.&lt;ref&gt;[https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=KWN5Em8wciI "The Scarecrow (1920) - Buster Keaton - Edward F.

==Later years and death==
[[File:The Scarecrow 1920.jpg|thumb|left|Luke with Keaton in the 1920 short ''The Scarecrow'', the dog's final film]]The talented canine continued to spend most of his time with Roscoe until Arbuckle and Minta separated in 1921 and finally divorced in 1925. Minta gained custody of Luke as part of the couple's separation agreement and divorce settlement, although Roscoe did have visitation rights to see him.&lt;ref name="Salute to Luke"/&gt; That arrangement may explain why the veteran stunt dog did not appear again on screen after his work with Keaton in ''The Scarecrow'' in 1920.

A [[Roscoe Arbuckle|scandal]] that rocked Arbuckle's personal and professional life in 1921 may have also affected Luke's career and be another reason for his apparent retirement from performing.

==Fictional character biography==

===Scorpion===
Mac Gargan was a [[private investigator]] initially hired by [[J. Jonah Jameson]] to find out how Peter Parker is able to obtain incredible pictures of [[Spider-Man]]&lt;ref&gt;''Amazing Spider-Man'' #19&lt;/ref&gt;. Gargan's efforts set off Peter's spider-sense and the teen easily evades the detective. Jameson then decides to hire Gargan as the subject of a barely-tested process that would endow him with the useful characteristics of a particular animal with the help of Dr. [[Farley Stillwell]]. Dr. Stillwell also outfits him with a club-like mechanical tail. In this case, a [[scorpion]] is the base for the purposes of creating a powerful agent capable of defeating Spider-Man as the scorpion is a natural predator of the spider. The Scorpion proves to be more than a match for Spider-Man, defeating him twice, but the mutagenic treatment seriously affects Gargan's mind, driving him [[Insanity|insane]] as the predatory instincts of the scorpion take over. He promptly turns on his benefactor but Spider-Man intervenes, and finally defeats the Scorpion in their third battle&lt;ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #20"&gt;''Amazing Spider-Man'' #20&lt;/ref&gt;. The Scorpion becomes a professional criminal and returns to indulge in a vendetta against Spider-Man and Jameson, only to be defeated again&lt;ref&gt;''Amazing Spider-Man'' #29&lt;/ref&gt;.

He is later hired by a spy ring to follow [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agent [[Sharon Carter]], but is defeated by [[Captain America]]&lt;ref&gt;''Captain America'' #122&lt;/ref&gt;. Scorpion is acquired by Mr. Kline, who creates an android duplicate of him&lt;ref&gt;''Daredevil'' #82&lt;/ref&gt;. The real Scorpion and Mr. Hyde launch a campaign of terror against S.H.I.E.L.D. agents, but are defeated by Captain America and the [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]]&lt;ref&gt;''Captain America'' #151-152&lt;/ref&gt;. After being released from prison for good behavior, the Scorpion hunts down Spider-Man and tries drowning him in a cement vat, hoping to use the boost to his reputation to become an underworld boss. Scorpion learns that Spider-Man survived the encounter, and the [[Jackal (Marvel Comics)|Jackal]] gives him Spider-Man's location. The Scorpion arrives at a hospital room with Peter Parker and his [[Aunt May]]. Not recognizing Spider-Man in his civilian identity, he threatens May and demands to know where Spider-Man is. After she faints, Scorpion rampages through the hospital. A furious Spider-Man beats the Scorpion and makes him apologize to May&lt;ref&gt;''Amazing Spider-Man'' #145-146&lt;/ref&gt;.

The Scorpion fights [[Ms. Marvel]] after a botched revenge attempt against Jameson; the Scorpion becomes more psychotic than usual after this, resulting in his being dumped in acid&lt;ref&gt;''Ms. Marvel'' #1-2&lt;/ref&gt;. In the sewers, his sanity deteriorating, Scorpion comes to believe that his costume cannot be taken off. After a quick encounter, Spider-Man proves that his belief of being a monster is only in his mind&lt;ref&gt;''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #21&lt;/ref&gt;. Gargan forms an extortion racket to sabotage the ''[[Daily Bugle]]'', but is thwarted by Spider-Man and Captain America&lt;ref&gt;''Marvel Team-Up'' #106&lt;/ref&gt;. He is freed from prison by agents of [[Egghead (Marvel Comics)|Egghead]], who wants him to join the third [[Masters of Evil]] alongside [[Whirlwind (comics)|Whirlwind]] and [[Moonstone (comics)|Moonstone]]. The team fight the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] but are defeated&lt;ref&gt;''Avengers'' #222&lt;/ref&gt;. Scorpion kidnaps Jameson's bride Marla Madison on their wedding day but she is rescued by Spider-Man&lt;ref&gt;''Amazing Spider-Man Annual'' #18&lt;/ref&gt;. Jonah publicly confesses to his role in creating the Scorpion when the [[Hobgoblin (comics)|Hobgoblin]] tries to use that secret to blackmail him.&lt;ref&gt;''Amazing Spider-Man'' #251&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his encounters with other foes, Scorpion has always had a special hatred for Spider-Man and Jameson, which extends to when he attempts to become a mercenary for [[Justin Hammer]], who has the Scorpion's battlesuit modified. He ruins his prospects on his first mission, to capture a war hero, when he cannot resist creating a [[hostage situation]] simply to bring Jameson to him for revenge. In reaction, Hammer sends [[Blacklash]] and [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]] to subdue Gargan and confiscate the tail enhancement equipment for abrogating his contract&lt;ref&gt;''Amazing Spider-Man'' #318-319&lt;/ref&gt;.

During the ''[[Acts of Vengeance]]'', he tries to enter Canada to avoid the Super Power Registration Act. The [[Tinkerer]] meets him at the airport and provides him with a modified scorpion tail for his costume. He, [[Asp (comics)|Asp]], [[Nekra]], and [[Owl (Marvel Comics)|Owl]] (who are under the control of [[Llan the Sorcerer]]) are repelled by [[Alpha Flight]] and [[Gamma Flight]]&lt;ref&gt;''Alpha Flight'' #79-80&lt;/ref&gt;. He is then hired by the [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]] to kill a depowered Spider-Man. He is defeated by the [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]]&lt;ref&gt;''Amazing Spider-Man'' #342-343&lt;/ref&gt;. The Scorpion's constant defeats at the hands of Spider-Man drive him to depression. He wanders the sewers, his mind becoming clearer than it had been since his transformation, and decides to quit being the Scorpion. He encounters a depressed and crisis-ridden Spider-Man. Ignoring Gargan's plea that he is a changed man, Spider-Man beats him savagely&lt;ref&gt;''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #215-216&lt;/ref&gt;. In his next appearance, Gargan is back to being psychopathic. He battles and is defeated by Spider-Man's clone [[Ben Reilly]]&lt;ref&gt;''Spider-Man Unlimited'' #13&lt;/ref&gt;.

Scorpion temporarily works for [[Roxxon Energy Corporation|Roxxon]] and helps them in their phony "rehabilitation therapy". Roxxon updates the Scorpion's powers and costume and promises he will get back at his enemies. Spider-Man convinces Scorpion that he is only being used. Scorpion then turns on Roxxon and is then defeated by Spider-Man&lt;ref&gt;''Spider-Man Unlimited'' #22&lt;/ref&gt;. Gargan reappears in the aftermath of the [[Secret War (comics)|Secret War]] that was organized by [[Nick Fury]] against [[Latveria]]. He is among the supervillains who were supplied with enhanced technology by Latverian dictator [[Lucia von Bardas]] and sent to attack the heroes involved in Fury's Secret War. The villains' technologies are hijacked by von Bardas, supplying her with power, potentially at the cost of the villains' lives, but the assembled heroes defeat von Bardas and apprehend Scorpion and the others{{Issue|date=April 2009}}.

===Venom===

{{Main|Venom (Marvel Comics character)}}
Later on through circumstances yet to be revealed, [[Norman Osborn]] reveals Spider-Man's true identity to Gargan and gives him orders to kidnap Peter's [[Aunt May]] should Osborn ever be captured and imprisoned. When Spider-Man defeats Osborn, he is imprisoned and Gargan carries out Osborn's orders in kidnapping Aunt May. Gargan eventually summons Peter and tells him the only way he can see his aunt again is to break Norman out of jail. Shortly thereafter, the [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] symbiote approaches Gargan,&lt;ref&gt;''Marvel Knights: Spider-Man'' #9&lt;/ref&gt; offering him new abilities, and Gargan becomes bonded with the creature.{{issue|date=September 2018}} This would later give him an extra edge as part of Norman Osborn's [[Sinister Six|Sinister Twelve]].&lt;ref&gt;''Marvel Knights: Spider-Man'' #10&lt;/ref&gt; Even with these additional powers he is still swiftly defeated by Spider-Man, as the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] deal with the rest of the Twelve.&lt;ref&gt;''Marvel Knights: Spider-Man'' #11&lt;/ref&gt; Though incarcerated,&lt;ref&gt;''Marvel Knights: Spider-Man'' #12&lt;/ref&gt; Gargan is unfazed, as with his new powers come the respect of becoming an "A-list" villain at last.{{issue|date=September 2018}}

Alongside Spider-Man and other villains and heroes, Venom is [[Beyond!|kidnapped by other-dimensional forces]]. He succeeds in killing Spider-Man, who is really the original [[Space Phantom]] in disguise.&lt;ref&gt;''Beyond!'' #1&lt;/ref&gt; For his crimes, the [[Inhumans]] matriarch [[Medusa (comics)|Medusa]] orders his execution and almost carries it out herself. Later, he tries to kill the other participants for the "[[Beyonder]]'s" wish fulfillment prize for the winner,&lt;ref&gt;''Beyond!'' #2&lt;/ref&gt; but fails and is returned to Earth alongside the rest of the group.&lt;ref&gt;''Beyond!'' #6&lt;/ref&gt;

===Thunderbolts===
Gargan later becomes a member of a sub-group of the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]&lt;ref&gt;''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War]]'' #4&lt;/ref&gt;, which has been drafted by the Avengers to hunt down the members of the fugitive Secret Avengers and is currently run by the Commission for Superhuman Activities&lt;ref&gt;''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War: Choosing Sides]]'' #1&lt;/ref&gt;. It is then revealed that he has been outfitted with electrical implants by the government to keep the Venom symbiote in check&lt;ref&gt;''Heroes for Hire'' vol. 2 #2&lt;/ref&gt;. As a Thunderbolt, he is seen as a hero by the general public and has his own action figures&lt;ref&gt;''Thunderbolts'' #110&lt;/ref&gt;. Gargan displays his new raw power as Venom in a battle with [[Jack Flag]], after pummeling Flag for a bit, the hero manages to stab Gargan, who is protected by the symbiote. Gargan becomes enraged and ferociously man-handles Flag, and is about to eat him when his electrical implants kick in and temporarily subdue him, allowing Flag to live&lt;ref name="Thunderbolts #111"&gt;''Thunderbolts'' #111&lt;/ref&gt;. Gargan expresses fear of the control the symbiote possesses over him, yet he has become addicted to the raw unearthly power it brings to him and cannot even begin to imagine life without it, similar to a drug addict&lt;ref&gt;''Thunderbolts'' #112&lt;/ref&gt;. An attack from [[Steel Spider]] and [[Shadowoman|Sepulchre]] makes him lose control again, briefly becoming a huge monster once more, while Moonstone is incapacitated and thus cannot coordinate control of his electrical implants&lt;ref&gt;''Thunderbolts'' #114&lt;/ref&gt;. Afterwards he returns to a normal form with no ill effects. He also bites off and devours Steel Spider's arm during a fight&lt;ref&gt;''Thunderbolts'' #115&lt;/ref&gt;.

Gargan is later ordered by Norman Osborn to hunt down [[Namor]]. After shooting him with a Thunderbolts-supplied weapon, Gargan disables Namor by ripping off his feet-wings. The Sub-Mariner manages to render Gargan unconscious and then rips out the symbiote's tongue&lt;ref&gt;''[[Sub-Mariner]]'' 2007 limited-series{{Issue|date=December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;, although the symbiote easily makes a new one. Gargan begins to hallucinate that the symbiote is speaking to him, telling him to "feed (it)". He later attacks and devours a guard and declares that "the only way out of Thunderbolts Mountain is when I decide to let you die"&lt;ref&gt;''Thunderbolts'' #118&lt;/ref&gt;. It is later revealed that the psychic criminal [[Blue Streak (comics)#Bluestreak (psychic)|Bluestreak]] is controlling Gargan's actions, although it is uncertain whether the symbiote was actually speaking to him or not&lt;ref&gt;''Thunderbolts'' #119&lt;/ref&gt;. Venom goes up against the [[Andreas von Strucker|Swordsman]], who stabs Gargan through the chest, using his powers to force the symbiote away from his sword. Gargan is wounded, but lives&lt;ref&gt;''Thunderbolts'' #120&lt;/ref&gt;. After healing, he retains his monstrous form, rarely returning to his usual size.

==="New Ways to Die"===
Gargan reappears during the "New Ways to Die" story arc of ''The Amazing Spider-Man'', no longer possessing the knowledge of Spider-Man's secret identity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=16246 |title=CBR News: Enemies at the Gates: Wacker Talks "Amazing Spider-Man" |publisher=Comic Book Resources |date= |accessdate=2011-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Gargan and the Thunderbolts are called back to New York to capture Spider-Man. While on a search for the wall-crawler, Gargan's symbiote senses a former host nearby. Gargan suspects that it is Spider-Man but instead finds [[Eddie Brock]] at the F.E.A.S.T center (a soup kitchen). The Venom symbiote attempts to leave Gargan to re-bond with Brock, much to Gargan's (and Brock's) dismay. Upon making contact with Brock, his skin is shown to be caustic to his former symbiote, and as a white substance seeps out of his pores covering his body, Brock becomes Anti-Venom and battles Gargan. With some help from Spider-Man, Anti-Venom subdues Venom and nearly destroys the symbiote&lt;ref&gt;{{Comic book reference| writer=[[Dan Slott]]| penciller=[[John Romita Jr.]]| story="New Ways to Die"|title=[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]| volume=| issue=#569| date=August 2008|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]| page=| panel=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Norman Osborn uses a sample of Anti-Venom's DNA from Mac Gargan and creates a poisonous counter to its healing powers by combining the sample with the immune system of [[Freak (Marvel Comics)#Freak (Spider-Man villain)|Freak]]. Mac Gargan is injected with the "cure" and is given a new Scorpion battlesuit, which contains the venom, until the symbiote can recover&lt;ref&gt;''Amazing Spider-Man'' #572&lt;/ref&gt;. Anti-Venom tracks down Gargan at Oscorp. After a grueling battle "Ven-orpion" injects the toxin into Anti-Venom and seemly kills the suit. He then attempts to kill Brock but the symbiote tries holding him back, still feeling love for its former host. The symbiote gains its strength and breaks though the Scorpion suit. Gargan gives up but promises that he will get past this problem and will someday finish Brock&lt;ref&gt;''Amazing Spider-Man'' #573&lt;/ref&gt;.

===''Secret Invasion''===
Gargan was seen being thrown from Thunderbolt Mountain by [[Captain Marvel (Khn'nr)|Captain Marvel]]&lt;ref&gt;''[[Secret Invasion]]'' #3&lt;/ref&gt;. Gargan was later seen with the other Thunderbolts in Washington. The [[Skrull]]s attempt to trick him into killing normal humans in order to find out which of them are Skrulls&lt;ref&gt;''Thunderbolts'' #123&lt;/ref&gt;. Osborn attempted to prevent the symbiote from killing anyone by threatening to kill Mac Gargan and promising to help satisfy his "urges" later, only for Gargan to reveal that the threat he appeared to pose to civilians was a ruse in order to draw out a disguised Skrull. Venom played a huge part in fighting the Skrulls. He was seen slashing and eating the Skrulls all at once&lt;ref&gt;''Thunderbolts'' #124&lt;/ref&gt;. He soon joins the Thunderbolts and the remaining heroes for the final battle against the Skrulls. During the battle, he was a force to be reckoned with&lt;ref&gt;''Secret Invasion'' #7&lt;/ref&gt;.

Venom, along with most of the Thunderbolts team, attempts to kill partner [[Songbird (comics)|Songbird]] on the orders of Osborn. Facing Venom, Songbird was defeated and almost eaten by Venom, but escaped with help from the Swordsman&lt;ref&gt;''Thunderbolts'' #127&lt;/ref&gt;.

===''Dark Reign''===
[[File:Dark Reign Sinister Spider-Man.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Mac Gargan as Spider-Man. Art By [[Mike Deodato Jr]].]]
Norman Osborn forms his [[Dark Avengers]], providing new identities to some of his former Thunderbolts. After feeding a [[Skrull]] to a hungry Venom that has become more bestial than human, Osborn gives him a medication that resets the symbiote to the size it was when it possessed Spider-Man originally. Gargan can transform into his larger Venom form at will.

Norman introduces Gargan and the symbiote as the Amazing Spider-Man in his new Avengers&lt;ref&gt;''Dark Avengers'' #1&lt;/ref&gt;. During their first mission against [[Morgan le Fay (Marvel Comics)|Morgana le Fay]], Morgana transforms "Venom-Spidey" into a giant, demonic monster who then tries to eat [[Ares (Marvel Comics)|Ares]]&lt;ref&gt;''Dark Avengers'' #2&lt;/ref&gt;. Venom later coughs up Ares; however, Morgana's magic continues to affect Venom, causing him to lose and gain control of himself randomly&lt;ref&gt;''Dark Avengers'' #3&lt;/ref&gt;. After Morgana is defeated in the past by Iron Patriot and [[Doctor Doom]], Mac returned to his "Spider-Man" form with only a slight headache. [[Bullseye (comics)|Hawkeye]] promised to kill Mac one day for trying to eat him while he was under Morgana's control&lt;ref&gt;''Dark Avengers'' #4&lt;/ref&gt;. Once they arrive home, he is seen arguing with Hawkeye&lt;ref&gt;''Dark Avengers'' #5&lt;/ref&gt;.

Later, attempting to find out Norman Osborn's plans for his son [[Harry Osborn|Harry]], the real Spider-Man, with the aid of the [[Invisible Woman]], manages to capture Gargan by using a sonic generator and takes his place to infiltrate the Dark Avengers. Gargan is thrown into the [[Negative Zone]]&lt;ref&gt;''Amazing Spider-Man'' #596&lt;/ref&gt;, but is later seen back with the Dark Avengers.

Against Osborn's wishes, Gargan is seen heading out into the city to "fight crime" solo. At one point, he is seen defeating a bank robber called General Wolfram. After making out with two girls at once and getting cheered by a large crowd, he takes the robber to an abandoned rooftop and consumes his arm. He then takes the money Wolfram stole and swings away. Gargan is then seen at a [[strip club]] with the money and discovers his new favorite stripper. After getting reprimanded by Norman Osborn for eating Wolfram's arm, Gargan kills the stripper and places her dead body in J. Jonah Jameson's bed while he is gone in an attempt to frame him for her murder. At the same time, Redeemer visits the injured General Wolfram and recruits him alongside other villains who have had limbs bitten off by Gargan (namely Dementoid, Doctor Everything, Eleven, and Hippo) in a plan to take down "Spider-Man" (who is believed to be the root of their problem)&lt;ref&gt;''Dark Reign: Sinister Spider-Man'' #1&lt;/ref&gt;. In another attempt to antagonize Jameson, Gargan instigates a turf war between two rival street gangs, hoping to wear Jameson down through stress and exhaustion from continuously putting out stories to cover the crime wave. At the same time, the Redeemer arms his group with cybernetic limbs to defeat Spider-Man. J. Jonah Jameson goes to Osborn for help and is given Spider-Man to help solve the city's gang problem&lt;ref&gt;''Dark Reign: Sinister Spider-Man'' #2&lt;/ref&gt;.

Gargan continues to instigate the gang war and aggravate Jameson in person. A bomb threat is placed by Redeemer to lure Spider-Man into an intervention, though Gargan instead devours Hippo and Eleven, badly injures Dementoid, and beats Doctor Everything into submission before turning him over to the police. He then eats Redeemer's limbs. With Redeemer, Wolfram, and Dementoid the only ones still remaining of the group (albeit hospitalized), Redeemer sends photos of Gargan's actions to Jameson in an attempt to expose him as a cannibalistic psychopath to the world&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''Dark Reign: Sinister Spider-Man'' #3&lt;/ref&gt;. Jameson first goes to Osborn, who decides to cut Gargan loose by sending Bullseye and [[Daken]] (in their old costumes) to kill him. At the Big Apple Festival, the two attack him, with Dementoid, General Wolfram, and both gangs involved in the turf war entering the fray to try to kill Spider-Man. Gargan ends up defeating all of them, and J. Jonah Jameson shoots a gun in the air to stop the fight. As a result, everyone credits Jameson and Spider-Man with successfully working together to stop criminals and save the festival. Gargan later returns to Avengers Tower, where he is visited by Norman Osborn. Osborn informs him that Bullseye and Daken will get over being hurt, but warns Gargan that if he goes out of control again, he will suit up as the Iron Patriot and take care of him personally&lt;ref&gt;''Dark Reign: Sinister Spider-Man'' #4&lt;/ref&gt;.

During the opening chapter of ''[[Utopia (comics)|Utopia]]'', the Dark Avengers are sent into San Francisco to quell the mutant riots and battle any X-Men they can find. Tension is shown to exist between the Avengers and Osborn's own [[Dark X-Men]]. When [[Namor]] and [[Emma Frost]] are revealed to be [[double agent]]s on [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops']] side and defect with [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Cloak and Dagger]], an irate Osborn gathers the Dark Avengers and the remaining Dark X-Men, Gargan included, ordering them to bring him Namor's head and Emma Frost's heart and to make sure that Cyclops sees them do it&lt;ref&gt;''Dark Avengers #8''&lt;/ref&gt;. The Dark Avengers and Dark X-Men attack Utopia and battle the X-Men, with Venom facing off against [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]]. Due to the sheer number of X-Men, Osborn is forced to retreat when informed that the only way to win would be to kill all the mutants on the island, an option which is not politically viable&lt;ref&gt;''Dark Avengers/Uncanny X-Men: Exodus''&lt;/ref&gt;.

Gargan later begins to show signs that his medications are making him emotionally unstable. On a mission with the Dark Avengers, Osborn takes Gargan off the case when he notices Gargan's outbursts&lt;ref name="Dark Avengers #10"&gt;''Dark Avengers'' #10&lt;/ref&gt;. [[Molecule Man]] turns Gargan and his symbiote into an inert pile of goo&lt;ref&gt;''Dark Avengers'' #11&lt;/ref&gt;. He is later restored by the [[Sentry (Robert Reynolds)|Sentry]]{{Issue|date=January 2010}}.

==="Siege"===
During the "[[Siege (comics)|Siege]]" storyline, Mac Gargan is with the Dark Avengers when Norman Osborn makes plans to invade [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]]. Mac Gargan and the rest of the Avengers protest. For fighting alongside the Initiative, Osborn promises to give the team their freedom from servitude. As a result, Gargan is among the mass of soldiers to launch an attack on Asgard following [[Loki (comics)|Loki]]'s setup. He and the rest of the Avengers manage to overwhelm [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]&lt;ref&gt;''Siege'' #1&lt;/ref&gt;. While fighting Ms. Marvel and Spider-Man after they arrive, Gargan is forcefully removed from the Venom symbiote, which takes over Ms. Marvel until Spider-Man defeats it&lt;ref&gt;''Siege: Spider-Man'' #1&lt;/ref&gt;. He, along with the other Dark Avengers, are arrested after Norman Osborn falls from power&lt;ref&gt;''Siege'' #4&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Return as Scorpion===
During the "[[Spider-Man: Big Time|Big Time]]" storyline, Mac Gargan is seen at the Raft superprison, having been separated from the Venom symbiote: the symbiote's removal was causing medical problems due to the side effects from his original genetic mutation. [[Alistair Smythe]] breaks him out of the Raft&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #650&lt;/ref&gt;. Gargan was then fitted with a new Scorpion suit by Smythe, which included a life-support system to stabilize Gargan's condition. Smythe convinced Gargan to join him in his plan for revenge on J. Jonah Jameson&lt;ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #651"&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #651&lt;/ref&gt;. Scorpion joins Alistair Smythe, a new villain named Fly-Girl, and some unnamed cyborg minions (each wanting revenge on Jameson) in attacking the launch site of [[John Jameson (comics)|John Jameson]]'s latest space mission, where they sabotage the launch and hold John Jameson for ransom&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #652&lt;/ref&gt;.

During the ''[[Ends of the Earth (Marvel Comics)|Ends of the Earth]]'' storyline, Scorpion is seen guarding one of Doctor Octopus' facilities. [[Titanium Man]] enters it and ends up fighting Scorpion. Titanium Man is defeated by Scorpion despite his best efforts&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man: Ends of the Earth'' #1&lt;/ref&gt;.

During the ''[[Dying Wish]]'' storyline, Scorpion hears the call-to-arms from Peter Parker (while trapped in Doctor Octopus' dying body) to save him and apprehend Doctor Octopus (occupying Spider-Man's body) in order to save his loved ones from Doctor Octopus' final sinister scheme&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #699&lt;/ref&gt;. Scorpion and [[Hydro-Man]] accompany Peter Parker in Doctor Octopus' body to Stark Industries to look for [[Iron Man|Tony Stark]] only to end up in a trap set by Doctor Octopus in Spider-Man's body. When finding a safe area containing Spider-Man's friends and relatives, Scorpion plans to have his final revenge on J. Jonah Jameson. Upon accessing the memories of Spider-Man loving Aunt May - and the times Scorpion threatened her - Doctor Octopus in Spider-Man's body retaliates by punching Scorpion so hard in the jaw (the only unprotected part of his body) that it breaks off from his head&lt;ref&gt;''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #700&lt;/ref&gt;.

Scorpion was later seen in the Raft's infirmary with Boomerang and Vulture. Scorpion now sported a metal apparatus that replaced his missing jaw. Alistair Smythe's mini-Spider-Slayers heal and enhance them, and Smythe gives them an offer to kill Spider-Man&lt;ref&gt;''The Superior Spider-Man'' #11&lt;/ref&gt;. While Boomerang fights Spider-Man, Scorpion is convinced by Smythe to go after Mayor Jameson again&lt;ref&gt;''The Superior Spider-Man'' #12&lt;/ref&gt;.

During the ''[[Secret Wars (2015 comic book)|Secret Wars]]'' storyline, Scorpion is among the villains at [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]]'s viewing party of the incursion between Earth-616 and Earth-1610&lt;ref&gt;''Secret Wars'' #1&lt;/ref&gt;.

As part of the ''[[All-New, All-Different Marvel]]'' event, Scorpion was secretly hired by Tiberius Stone of [[Alchemax]] to further test Alchemax's Spider-Slayers during Tiberius' trip to a foreign country to sell them. During Scorpion's test of Alchemax's Spider-Slayers, Scorpion encountered [[Spider-Man 2099]]&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;''Spider-Man 2099'' vol. 2 #3&lt;/ref&gt;. When Scorpion thought that Spider-Man 2099 was his Spider-Man in a different costume, he attacks him with the aid of the Spider-Slayers. Spider-Man 2099 was able to use his holographic assistant to project a hologram of Spider-Man over Scorpion causing the Spider-Slayers to attack Scorpion until he turned them off twice&lt;ref&gt;''Spider-Man 2099'' vol. 2 #4&lt;/ref&gt;.

Scorpion later doubles working for Black Cat's gang when he and a man named Lee Price partake in a black market sale that also involved Tombstone's gang&lt;ref&gt;''Venom'' vol. 3 #1&lt;/ref&gt;. When at Black Cat's hideout, Scorpion accuses Lee Price of botching up the black market sale which Lee Price denied leading Black Cat to demand an explanation after hearing about some information from her spies at the New York City Police Department telling her what they know. After Lee Price leaves following his explanation, Scorpion becomes suspicious towards Lee&lt;ref&gt;''Venom'' vol. 3 #2&lt;/ref&gt;. While confiding his suspicions, Mac Gargan dons a new version of the Scorpion armor&lt;ref&gt;''Venom'' vol. 3 #3&lt;/ref&gt;. He then meets Price at the apartment of a Daily Bugle reporter, who had evidence against Black Cat. When Lee reminds him that they should scare the reporter, Scorpion attacks him causing Lee to transform into Venom and the two begin to fight. During the fight, Scorpion is nearly killed until Spider-Man intervenes, who mistook Venom for Flash Thompson&lt;ref&gt;''Venom'' vol. 3 #4-5&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Personality==
Before he assumed the identity of the Scorpion, Mac Gargan was a skilled, if somewhat greedy and unscrupulous, private investigator, who admitted that he would go through anything "just so long as the pay is good!"&lt;ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #20"/&gt; His greed still motivated him as a supervillain, albeit in a twisted way: while awaiting an official "offer" from the Thunderbolts, Gargan squeezed his agent for financial details on a proposed book, TV and movie deal ("How many back points? And residuals? Fantastic. That foreign ''and ''domestic?"), demanded certain talent for the writing (including [[Eric Guggenheim|the screenwriting brother]] of [[Marc Guggenheim|the comic's writer]]) and, finally, Gargan killed six "capekiller" [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] agents sent to bring him in - because while he intended to cooperate, his agent had told him that the rights to his life story would be "worth a little more" if Gargan "goosed up the body count" before joining the Thunderbolts&lt;ref&gt;''Civil War: Choosing Sides'' #1 (Dec. 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;.

He is emotionally disturbed as a result of the procedure in which he acquired his powers, and retains little of his former rationality. He is typically easily outsmarted by Spider-Man and is not very good at cooperating with other supervillains or following instructions as Justin Hammer learned. His most prominent weakness is his explosive temper and irrational hatred toward J. Jonah Jameson, to the point where he has been known to ignore the orders of whomever he is working for, in order to attack the ''Daily Bugle's'' publisher{{Issue|date=November 2009}}. None of this has changed with his bonding to the Venom symbiote, or with his new career serving under Norman Osborn with the Thunderbolts or the Dark Avengers: in fact, the symbiote seems to have only made him even more irrational, and his new career as a "hero" has done nothing to curtail his lingering hatred of Jameson{{Issue|date=November 2009}}. He nearly blew his cover as Spider-Man when he started a drug war and photographs of him engaging in cannibalism wound up in J. Jonah Jameson's hands, putting his employer [[Norman Osborn]]'s plans and the "heroic" status of his entire [[Dark Avengers]] team in jeopardy, just to pursue vengeance against Jameson (now the Mayor of New York) yet again. His ill-conceived and poorly thought-out plan failed, and he was forced to publicly make peace with Jameson in his Spider-Man guise, greatly embarrassing him, though he secretly fantasized about killing Jameson during the whole time while they were shaking hands{{Issue|date=November 2009}}.

The years of being outsmarted and beaten, despite his physical superiority over Spider-Man, complement the similar hatred possessed by the symbiote, and has allowed it to almost completely control Gargan. Unlike the other Venoms, Mac very seldom refers to himself as "we" instead of "I". Gargan has even engaged in [[cannibalism]] as Venom, severing and devouring the arm of the still-living [[Steel Spider]]. After getting "the taste of flesh", he is seen displaying even more signs of cannibalism such as eating Skrulls, consuming the bones of [[Swarm (comics)|Swarm]], devouring Eleven and the limbs of criminals, and trying to eat Ares. When the symbiote is dormant in his body he has expressed nausea and fear of the organism&lt;ref&gt;''[[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]]'' #112&lt;/ref&gt;. Unlike [[Eddie Brock]], any inhibitions Gargan had about harming innocent bystanders has been eliminated with his bonding to the symbiote, most likely because he had such little regard for others to begin with. Gargan's [[#Scorpion|previous identity]] has not been completely degraded. His [[Symbiote (comics)|symbiote]] once sprouted a scorpion-like tail, although he has not had it since. Also, when he learned there was a [[Scorpion (Carmilla Black)|new hero]] calling herself the Scorpion, Gargan-Venom attacked her to protect his trademark while it still lasted. Also, for a brief time, Gargan wore a new Scorpion suit while the symbiote regenerated after Anti-Venom's attack, although initially he was hesitant about wearing it alongside the symbiote.

==Powers and abilities==
===As Scorpion===
Mac Gargan, as the Scorpion, was given superhuman powers through chemical and radiological treatments, include splicing his genetics with a scorpion's DNA, which produced mutagenic effects. As the result, he has [[arachnid]]-like powers similar to Spider-Man's such as superhuman strength, speed, agility, reflexes, stamina, and durability, and also can scale walls (he also punches holes in walls as a way to climb). He also has an exceptionally strong grip, reminiscent of a real scorpion's pincers. He wears a full-body battlesuit composed of two layers of light steel mesh separated by a thin layer of insulated rubber. In addition to his superhuman physique, he was traditionally armed with a cybernetically-controlled, seven-foot mechanical tail, with a tool steel articulated framework which can whip at 90 miles per hour. The tail has in the past been equipped with projectile weapons, usually an electric generator, although it has also been equipped with a spike at its tip, which can squirt an acidic spray, and a low-density plasma energy projector. The Scorpion can use his tail as an extra leg, or he can coil it behind him to spring himself a distance of at least 30 feet. The Scorpion is substantially stronger and more durable than Spider-Man, though is a much less skilled hand-to-hand combatant.

===As Venom===
With the Venom symbiote, Mac Gargan retains his superhuman abilities, some of which have increased substantially beyond the original levels. The costume can even emulate the tail of Gargan's Scorpion costume. It can also be used as a fifth limb{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}. As Venom, Gargan has gained the ability to shoot webbing and climb walls like Spider-Man, and can disguise himself as other people or blend in with his background. He is undetectable by Spider-Man's "spider-sense". His skill as a hand-to-hand combatant has increased due to the influence of the alien symbiote, which has superior instincts and fighting experience. The costume can also heal grave injuries suffered by the host with incredible speed. Mac (as Venom) has claws on his fingers which can be used as weapons to slash his foes. He can also create tendrils to incapacitate his enemies.

When injured or enraged, Venom now has the ability to increase its mass and physical strength in order to meet whatever threat it is facing with equal force, an ability inconsistently hinted in the past, such as when Venom battled the [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]]. During these times it is not clear that Gargan has any control over the symbiote, for had it not been for the technology restraining Venom, he would have eaten [[Jack Flag]]. Also, during a battle with the [[Steel Spider]], Gargan attacks innocent bystanders&lt;ref name="Thunderbolts #111"/&gt;.

===As Spider-Man===
A special "medication" provided by Norman Osborn allowed Venom to assume a smaller, more human-looking form similar to when Spider-Man had control of the symbiote. From this form, he is able to switch back to his larger, more feral form whenever he pleases. As Spider-Man, Mac seems to be even more agile than when he was as Venom. He also still has all of Venom's powers, minus the claws, tongue, and teeth, which he can regrow at will&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;. His "medication" has also been shown to decrease his will to fight, making him more sympathetic&lt;ref name="Dark Avengers #10"/&gt;.

===Return as Scorpion===
After Smythe breaks him out of the Raft, Gargan is fitted with a new Scorpion suit. The suit is larger than its predecessor, and cybernetically wired into Gargan, making him a [[cyborg]]. It is equipped with a more powerful tail, mechanical pincers, and is bulletproof. Smythe also altered Gargan's biology, giving him a "scorpion-sense" to match Spider-Man's spider-sense. The suit is also very tough, allowing Gargan to withstand a fall at terminal speed&lt;ref name="Amazing Spider-Man #651"/&gt;. The armor leaves Mac's jaw unprotected, which Doctor Octopus in Spider-Man's body exploited to punch his jaw clean off&lt;ref&gt;''Amazing Spider-Man'' #700&lt;/ref&gt;. Following his employment by Alchemax, he has gained a new jaw to replace the jaw he lost&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;.

==Other versions==
===Exiles===
In one of the many realities visited by the [[Exiles (Marvel Comics)|Exiles]], Mac Gargan is one of the many superhumans that form the [[Heroes for Hire]], and is part of the ''Avengers Package'', which also includes the Black Widow and the Black Knight. After being hired to protect Tokyo from [[Moses Magnum]] and [[Namorita]], Scorpion is killed by the murderous, teenage counterpart of [[Magik (comics)|Magik]].&lt;ref&gt;''Exiles'' #26-27&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ultimate Marvel===
The [[Ultimate Marvel]] comics feature '''Maximus Gargan''', a tattoed Mexican mob boss that worked with the [[Prowler (comics)|Prowler]] (Aaron Davis).&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;''Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man'' vol. 2, #6&lt;/ref&gt; This Gargan is the second villain to take on the alias of Scorpion, the first being a deranged, imperfect clone of Peter Parker. He is shown to have very resistant skin, but may have other powers as well.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Once he arrived at New York, Gargan set his sights on becoming the new "Kingpin of New York", but was stopped by the efforts of an un-easy alliance of [[Spider-Man (Miles Morales)|Spider-Man]] and Prowler.&lt;ref&gt;''Ultimate Comics: Spider-Man'' #10&lt;/ref&gt;

===''JLA/Avengers''===
In the last issue of ''[[JLA/Avengers]]'', Scorpion is among the enthralled villains defending Krona's stronghold, and is defeated by [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]].&lt;ref&gt;''JLA/Avengers'' #4&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Marvel Zombies''===
A zombified Scorpion appears in ''[[Marvel Zombies: Dead Days]]'' and ''[[Marvel Zombies 3]]''. He is a member of the [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]]'s undead alliance. As such, he searches New York and the surrounding areas for food of any kind. He is on friendly terms with the zombie [[Diablo (Marvel Comics)|Diablo]]. He is eventually killed by [[Machine Man]].&lt;ref&gt;''Marvel Zombies'' #3 (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Spider-Man: Reign''===
Gargan appears as the Scorpion (in a highly advanced costume) in ''[[Spider-Man: Reign]]'' as a member of the [[Sinister Six|Sinner Six]]&lt;!--YES, it IS Sinner Six, see [[Spider-Man: Reign]]. Do not edit this out! --&gt;. He dies when he is punted from an [[Empire State Building]] window by Spider-Man.&lt;ref&gt;''Spider-Man: Reign'' #1-4&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Spider-Verse''===
In the ''[[Spider-Verse]]'', the Earth-001 version of Scorpion is a member of Verna's [[Hounds (comics)|Hounds]]. Alongside the Earth-001 version of Rhino, Scorpion accompanied Verna to Earth-21205 to hunt Hobgoblin (who was the identity of that world's Peter Parker). They were stopped by the Spider-Woman of Earth-65.&lt;ref&gt;''Spider-Verse Team-Up'' #2&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other media==

===Television===
* Scorpion appeared in the 1960s ''[[Spider-Man (1967 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' animated series, voiced by [[Carl Banas]].&lt;ref name="TVoS"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Voices of Scorpion|url=http://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/characters/Spider-Man/Scorpion/|publisher=Behind The Voice Actors}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is introduced in the episode "Never Step on a Scorpion" in which his creation is shown. It is revealed that his villainy is apparently due to the experiment making his evil nature increase. Scorpion returns in the episode "Sting of the Scorpion" where he breaks out of prison to wreak revenge on [[J. Jonah Jameson]] by kidnapping him. Scorpion accidentally takes a formula which makes him grow to 20 feet tall while breaking into Stillwell's home and trying to find the formula that gave him his superhuman strength, but [[Spider-Man]] gives him the antidote and he is jailed again.
* Scorpion appeared in ''[[Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends]]''.&lt;ref name="TVoS"/&gt; Seen in the episode "Attack of the Arachnoid", he was thwarted by the Spider-Friends (Spider-Man, [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]] and [[Firestar (comics)|Firestar]]) at the beginning of the episode. When Spider-Man ends up in jail for Zolton's actions to frame the real Spider-Man, Scorpion took this opportunity to deliver payback to Spider-Man only to be defeated.

[[Image:spidermanep2.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Scorpion in the 1990s ''Spider-Man'' animated series.]]
* Scorpion appeared in the 1990s ''[[Spider-Man (1994 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' animated series, voiced initially by [[Martin Landau]] (until his [[Academy Award]] win and subsequent lack of availability) and later by [[Richard Moll]].&lt;ref name="TVoS"/&gt; Mac Gargan is initially depicted as a neurotic, plump, and balding private eye working for J. Jonah Jameson. In an attempt to discover Spider-Man's real identity, Jameson convinces Gargan to be transformed into a capable superhero by Dr. Stillwell using the [[Neogenic Recombinator]]. As Scorpion, he is able to defeat Spider-Man by pulling a water tower onto Spider-Man, but before he can unmask the wall-crawler, he is overcome with pain as he undergoes further uncontrolled mutations that give him green skin, yellow eyes, and talon-like fingers which also drives him insane. Believing more radiation may stop his transformation and return him to normal, he attempts to gain access to a nuclear reactor (where he plans to release it would have destroyed all of New York City) but is found and defeated by Spider-Man, resulting in Scorpion being sent to jail. Scorpion reappears as a member of the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]]'s [[Sinister Six|supervillain team]] (alongside the [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]], the [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]], [[Mysterio (comics)|Mysterio]] and [[Doctor Octopus]]) to kill Spider-Man though he is again defeated by Spider-Man. Desperate to find a cure to his condition, Scorpion kidnaps Stillwell but Stillwell destroys the Neogenic Recombinator to prevent the creation of other beings like Scorpion. After meeting the [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]], Scorpion kidnaps Vulture from an exploding building to hold hostage, believing Vulture to be smart enough to undo his Scorpion transformation. Eventually, [[Alistair Smythe]], requiring Scorpion's genetic code to further his own experiments, holds the [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]] hostage to coerce Spider-Man into bringing Scorpion. Scorpion eventually manages to escape Smythe's clutches due to Vulture attacking and attempts to stay away from crime. Scorpion's final appearance is again as a member of the Insidious Six who attempt to locate the [[Red Skull]]'s [[doomsday device]] for Kingpin. At the end of the episode, he is shown to have escaped the police.
* Mac Gargan is alluded in ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)|The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' animated series.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} In the [[series finale]] "Final Curtain", the Chameleon (disguised as Norman Osborn) thanks the private investigator on the phone for investigating [[Donald Menken]]'s address.

[[Spider-Man]] interrupts the deal and attaches Gargan to the back of the Ferry with webbing. He is then knocked into the bay by a runaway car in the ensuing destruction. In a mid-credits scene, Gargan is physically-scarred with a mechanical brace attached to his right arm (a reference to some version of Scorpion, in which his right arm is designed like a Scorpion's stinger) and meets Adrian Toomes in prison, and says he has comrades on the outside who want to join forces to get revenge on Spider-Man. When Mac mentions the rumor that Toomes knows Spider-Man's identity, Toomes denies it.

Spider-Man is easily defeated by the combined forces of the Sinister Six, but not killed because, as it is revealed at the end of the game, Otto is aware of his secret identity. The Sinister Six then split up to fulfill their respective tasks, with Rhino and Scorpion being sent to poison the city's reservoir. Spider-Man stops them, but Scorpion injects him with his poison, which causes him strange hallucinations before it would eventually kill him. However, Spider-Man manages to create and inject himself with an antidote just in time. Rhino and Scorpion are later seen at the docks, fighting some [[Silver Sable|Sable]] Interational mercenaries and trying to destroy the medical deliveres for the people infected with Devil's Breath virus. [[Miles Morales]] encounters the two while there and manages to escape, warning Peter Parker about it. Spider-Man later arrives at the docks and manages to defeat Rhino and Scorpion, trapping them in a container until the police would take them back into custody.

{{distinguish|text=the [[Mau-Mau Uprising]] in Kenya (1952–1960) or the [[Maji Maji Rebellion]] in German East Africa (1905–1907). For other uses of the term maimai, see [[Maimai (disambiguation)]]}}
[[File:Mai Mai Katanga.jpg|thumb|Mai-Mai fighters surrendering their weapons to United Nations personnel in Northern Katanga, 2006]]
The term '''Mai-Mai''' or '''Mayi-Mayi''' refers to any kind of community-based militia group active in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (DRC), formed to defend their local territory against other armed groups. Most were formed to resist the invasion of [[Rwanda]]n forces and Rwanda-affiliated Congolese rebel groups, but some may have formed to exploit the war for their own advantage by [[looting]], [[cattle rustling]] or [[banditry]].

Groups that fall under the umbrella term "Mai-Mai" include armed forces led by warlords, traditional tribal elders, village heads, and politically motivated resistance fighters.  Because Mai Mai have had only the most tenuous internal cohesion, different Mai-Mai groups allied themselves with a variety of domestic and foreign government and guerrilla groups at different times. The term Mai-Mai does not refer to any particular movement, affiliation or political objective but to a broad variety of groups.

Mai-Mai were particularly active in the eastern Congolese provinces bordering Rwanda, [[North Kivu]] and [[South Kivu]] (the "[[Kivus]]"), which were under the control of the Rwanda-allied [[Banyamulenge]]-dominated rebel faction, the [[Rally for Congolese Democracy–Goma]] (RCD-Goma). While militias have long been common in the Kivus, particularly among the minority [[Batembo]] and [[Babembe]] ethnic groups, the recent wars and conflicts caused large numbers of town dwellers to form Mai-Mai. Although the Mai-Mai, either as a group or as individual groups, were not party to the 1999 [[Lusaka Accord]] meant to end the war, they remained one of the most powerful forces in the conflict and the lack of cooperation from some groups has been problematic for the peace process.

==Mai-Mai in North and South Kivu==
[[File:Zaire 97 kivus.jpg|thumb|The East-central DRC, showing Kivu]]
According to a 2001 UN report, 20,000 to 30,000 Mai-Mai were active in the two Kivu provinces.  The two most powerful and well-organized Mai-Mai groups in the Kivus were led by Generals Padiri and Dunia, but now it is another ''Mai-Mai'' group which is called [[Mai-Mai Yakutumba]] which was organized in 2007 by General Yakutumba, ex-Mai-Mai in 2001. They were reported to have received aid from the government of the Democratic Republic of Congo and are widely viewed by other Mai Mai groups as the leaders, though not the commanders, of the Kivu Mai-Mai.  A number of smaller Mai-Mai groups, such as the [[Mudundu 40]]/[[Front de Résistance et de Défense du Kivu]] (FRDKI) and [[Mouvement de Lutte contre l'Agression au Zaïre]]/[[Forces Unies de Résistance Nationale contre l'Agression de la Républíque Démocratique du Congo]] (MLAZ/FURNAC), were reported to cooperate with the [[Rwanda]]n military and [[Rally for Congolese Democracy–Goma]] (RCD-Goma).

Walikale and Masisi north of Goma were the centres of Mai-Mai activity in North Kivu.  In South Kivu, there have historically been concentrations around [[Walungu]] and [[Bunyakiri]] south of [[Lake Kivu]], around [[Uvira]] and [[Mwenaga]] at the northern end of [[Lake Tanganyika]], further south around [[Fizi]], and around [[Shabunda]], between the Rwandan border and Kindu.

A Mai-Mai leader, Colonel Mayele, was arrested by UN forces in October 2010, allegedly being the leader behind mass rapes in the Walikale region of North Kivu province.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/world/2010/1007/1224280566201.html Congo rebel chief arrested over mass rape – The Irish Times – Thu, Oct 07, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mai-Mai in Katanga==
{{Main|Mai-Mai Kata Katanga}}
A former leader of the Mai-Mai, [[Gédéon Kyungu Mutanga]], turned himself over to [[MONUC]] troops in May 2006. He was found guilty of numerous war crimes between October 2003 and May 2006 and was sentenced to death by the Kipushi Military Tribunal in [[Katanga Province]] on 6 March 2009.&lt;ref name="RO060309"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.radiookapi.net/index.php?i=53&amp;a=22549| title=Kipushi : Kyungu Mutanga alias Gédéon condamné à la peine capitale| work=[[Radio Okapi]]| date=2009-03-06|accessdate = 2009-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; He escaped from prison in September 2011 and formed the [[Mai-Mai Kata Katanga]] ("Secede Katanga").&lt;ref name=bbc1&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-23422038|title=Katanga: Fighting for DR Congo's cash cow to secede|publisher=bbcnews.com|accessdate=12 September 2013|date=11 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other Mai-Mai groups==

There was a large Mai-Mai presence in [[Maniema]], in particular around [[Kindu]] and [[Kalemie]].  [[Province Orientale]] also hosts a number of Mai-Mai, but these groups were apparently involved in long-standing ethnic disputes.

''Mai-Mai Gedeon'' is also commanded by Gedeon Kyungu Mutanga and loosely tied to his Mai-Mai Kata Katanga.&lt;ref name=bbc1/&gt; The ''Corak Kata Katanga'' also known as the Co-ordination for a Referendum on Self-determination for Katanga, composed mainly of former Katanga Tigers, a separatist group active in the 1960s.&lt;ref name=bbc1/&gt; They claim to be behind the attack on the Katanga airport in February 2011. It is unclear to what extent all these groups are co-ordinated.&lt;ref name=bbc1/&gt; 

==Mai-Mai and the mountain gorillas==

In May 2007, Mai-Mai killed two [[wildlife officer]]s in [[Virunga National Park]] and threatened to kill [[mountain gorilla]]s if the government retaliated. The Mai-Mai are also suspected of the killings of nine mountain gorillas, with the use of machetes, and automatic weapons. In an October 2012 incident, Mai-Mai killed two park staff and a soldier, while three soldiers were injured. From 1990 to 2018 some 170 Virunga Rangers have died in such attacks, according to the WWF.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wwf.panda.org/wwf_news/?206549/WWF-Deeply-Saddened-By-Death-Of-Virunga-Park-Protectors WWF deeply saddened by death of Virunga park protectors (''WWF'' article)]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Six Virunga Park Rangers were reported to have been killed in Virunga National Park. Five rangers and a driver were killed in an ambush and a sixth ranger was injured in the Central section of the vast reserve on Monday April 9 2018. Officials suspected the attacks were by the Mai-Mai. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/weather/2018/apr/09/six-virunga-park-rangers-killed-in-drc-wildlife-sanctuary&lt;/ref&gt;

was an American [[Islam in the United States|Muslim]] minister and [[human rights activists|human rights activist]]. To his admirers he was a courageous advocate for the rights of blacks, a man who indicted white America in the harshest terms for its crimes against black Americans; detractors accused him of preaching [[racism]] and violence. He has been called one of the greatest and most influential [[African Americans]] in history.

His father was killed when he was six and his mother was placed in a mental hospital when he was thirteen, after which he lived in a series of [[foster home]]s. In 1946, at age 20, he went to prison for [[larceny]] and breaking and entering. While in prison, he became a member of the [[Nation of Islam]] (NOI), changing his birth name '''Malcolm Little''' to Malcolm{{nbsp}}X because, he later wrote, ''Little'' was the name that "the white slavemaster{{nbsp}}... had imposed upon {{interp|his|orig=my}} paternal forebears". After his parole in 1952, he quickly rose to become one of the organization's most influential leaders, serving as the public face of the controversial group for a dozen years. In his autobiography, Malcolm{{nbsp}}X wrote proudly of some of the social achievements the Nation made while he was a member, particularly its free [[Drug rehabilitation|drug rehabilitation program]]. The Nation promoted [[black supremacy]], advocated the [[Black separatism|separation of black and white Americans]], and rejected the [[civil rights movement]] for its emphasis on [[Racial integration|integration]].

By March 1964, Malcolm{{nbsp}}X had grown disillusioned with the Nation of Islam and its leader [[Elijah Muhammad]]. Expressing many regrets about his time with them, which he had come to regard as largely wasted, he embraced [[Sunni Islam]]. After a period of travel in Africa and the Middle East, which included completing the [[Hajj]], he also became known as '''el-Hajj Malik el-Shabazz'''.{{efn-ua|{{lang-ar|الحاجّ مالك الشباز}}; {{IPA-ar|al-ħad͡ʒː&amp;nbsp;malik&amp;nbsp;aʃːabaːz}}. This name includes the [[honorific]] [[El-Hajj]], given on completion of the [[Hajj]] to [[Mecca]]. {{cite book |title=Islam: A Very Short Introduction |publisher=Oxford University Press |author=Malise Ruthven |year=1997 |isbn=978-0-19-285389-9 |page=147 }} }} He repudiated the Nation of Islam, disavowed racism and founded [[Muslim Mosque, Inc.]] and the [[Organization of Afro-American Unity]]. He continued to emphasize [[Pan-Africanism]], black self-determination, and black self-defense.

On February 21, 1965, he was assassinated by three members of the Nation of Islam.

[[File:1930 census Little.gif|thumb|right|1930 United States Census return listing the Little family (lines 59ff.)|alt=A ledger with names, ages, and other personal information]]

Malcolm Little was born May{{nbsp}}19, 1925, in [[Omaha, Nebraska]], the fourth of seven children of [[Grenada]]-born [[Louise Little (activist)|Louise Helen Little]] (née Norton) and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]-born Earl Little.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Watson |first1=Clarence |last2=Akhtar |first2=Salman |authorlink2=Salman Akhtar |chapter=Ideology and Identity: Malcolm X |title=The African American Experience: Psychoanalytic Perspectives |editor-last=Akhtar |editor-first=Salman |year=2012 |location=Lanham, Md. |publisher=Jason Aronson |page=120 |isbn=978-0-7657-0835-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Earl was an outspoken [[Baptist]] [[Laity|lay]] speaker, and he and Louise were admirers of [[Pan-Africanism|Pan-African]] activist [[Marcus Garvey]]. Earl was a local leader of the [[Universal Negro Improvement Association]] (UNIA) and Louise served as secretary and "branch reporter", sending news of local UNIA activities to ''[[Negro World]]''; they inculcated self-reliance and [[black pride]] in their children.&lt;ref&gt;Marable, ''Malcolm{{nbsp}}X'', pp.{{nbsp}}20–30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Perry, pp.{{nbsp}}2–3.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Ted |last=Vincent |title=The Garveyite Parents of Malcolm X |journal=[[The Black Scholar]] |volume=20 |number=2 |date=March–April 1989 |pages=10–13 |jstor=41067613 |subscription=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Malcolm{{nbsp}}X later said that white violence killed four of his father's brothers.&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm{{nbsp}}X, ''Autobiography'', pp.{{nbsp}}3–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of [[Ku Klux Klan]] threats{{mdashb}}Earl's UNIA activities were said to be "spreading trouble"&lt;ref&gt;DeCaro, pp.{{nbsp}}43–44.&lt;/ref&gt;{{mdashb}}the family relocated in 1926 to [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]], and shortly thereafter to [[Lansing, Michigan]].&lt;ref&gt;Natambu, p.{{nbsp}}3.&lt;/ref&gt; There the family was frequently harassed by the [[Black Legion (political movement)|Black Legion]], a white [[racism in the United States|racist]] group. When the family home burned in 1929, Earl accused the Black Legion.&lt;ref&gt;Natambu, p.{{nbsp}}4.&lt;/ref&gt;

When Malcolm was six, his father died in what was officially ruled a [[streetcar]] accident, though his mother Louise believed Earl had been murdered by the Black Legion. Rumors that white racists were responsible for his father's death were widely circulated and were very disturbing to Malcolm X as a child. As an adult, he expressed conflicting beliefs on the question.&lt;ref&gt;Marable, ''Malcolm{{nbsp}}X'', p.{{nbsp}}29.&lt;/ref&gt; After a dispute with creditors, Louise received a life insurance benefit
(nominally $1,000{{mdashb}}about ${{Inflation|US|1|1931|r=0}},000 in {{#expr:{{CURRENTYEAR}}-1}} dollars{{Inflation-fn|US|group=upper-alpha}}) in payments of $18 per month;&lt;ref&gt;Marable, ''Malcolm{{nbsp}}X'', p.{{nbsp}}32&lt;/ref&gt; the issuer of another, larger policy refused to pay, claiming her husband Earl had committed suicide.&lt;ref&gt;Natambu, p.{{nbsp}}10.&lt;/ref&gt; To make ends meet Louise rented out part of her garden, and her sons hunted game.&lt;ref&gt;Marable, ''Malcolm{{nbsp}}X'', p.{{nbsp}}32.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1937 a man Louise had been dating{{mdashb}}marriage had seemed a possibility{{mdashb}}vanished from her life when she became pregnant with his child.&lt;ref&gt;Marable, ''Malcolm{{nbsp}}X'', p.{{nbsp}}35.&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1938 she had a [[Mental breakdown|nervous breakdown]] and was committed to [[Kalamazoo Regional Psychiatric Hospital|Kalamazoo State Hospital]]. The children were separated and sent to [[Foster care|foster homes]]. Malcolm and his siblings secured her release 24 years later.&lt;ref&gt;Marable, ''Malcolm{{nbsp}}X'', pp.{{nbsp}}35–36, 265&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Perry, pp.{{nbsp}}33–34, 331.&lt;/ref&gt;

After a short time in [[Flint, Michigan|Flint]], Michigan, he moved to New York City's [[Harlem]] neighborhood in 1943, where he engaged in drug dealing, gambling, [[Racket (crime)|racketeering]], robbery, and [[Procuring (prostitution)|pimping]].&lt;ref&gt;Perry, pp.{{nbsp}}62–81.&lt;/ref&gt;

When Little was in prison, he met fellow convict John Bembry,&lt;ref&gt;Natambu, p.{{nbsp}}121.&lt;/ref&gt; a self-educated man he would later describe as "the first man I had ever seen command total respect … with words".&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm{{nbsp}}X, ''Autobiography'', p.{{nbsp}}178; ellipsis in original.&lt;/ref&gt; Under Bembry's influence, Little developed a voracious appetite for reading.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, pp.{{nbsp}}108–110, 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

At this time, several of his siblings wrote to him about the [[Nation of Islam]], a relatively new religious movement preaching black self-reliance and, ultimately, the return of the [[African diaspora]] to Africa, where they would be free from white American and European domination.&lt;ref&gt;Natambu, pp.{{nbsp}}127–128, 132–138.&lt;/ref&gt; He showed scant interest at first, but after his brother Reginald wrote in 1948, "Malcolm, don't eat any more pork and don't smoke any more cigarettes. I'll show you how to get out of prison",&lt;ref&gt;Natambu, pp.{{nbsp}}128–129.&lt;/ref&gt; he quit smoking and began to refuse pork.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, p.{{nbsp}}113.&lt;/ref&gt; After a visit in which Reginald described the group's teachings, including the belief that white people are devils, Little concluded that every relationship he'd had with whites had been tainted by dishonesty, injustice, greed, and hatred.&lt;ref&gt;Natambu, pp.{{nbsp}}134–135.&lt;/ref&gt; Little, whose hostility to religion had earned him the prison nickname "Satan",&lt;ref&gt;Perry, pp.{{nbsp}}104–106.&lt;/ref&gt; became receptive to the message of the Nation of Islam.&lt;ref&gt;Natambu, p.{{nbsp}}136.&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 1948, Little wrote to [[Elijah Muhammad]], the leader of the Nation of Islam. Muhammad advised him to renounce his past, humbly bow in prayer to [[God in Islam|God]], and promise never to engage in destructive behavior again.&lt;ref name=Natambu138&gt;Natambu, pp.{{nbsp}}138–139.&lt;/ref&gt; Though he later recalled the inner struggle he had before bending his knees to pray,&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm{{nbsp}}X, ''Autobiography'', p.{{nbsp}}196.&lt;/ref&gt; Little soon became a member of the Nation of Islam,&lt;ref name=Natambu138 /&gt;
maintaining a regular correspondence with Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, p.{{nbsp}}116.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] opened a file on Little after he wrote a letter from prison to [[Harry S. Truman|President Truman]] expressing opposition to the [[Korean War]] and declaring himself a Communist.&lt;ref&gt;Marable, ''Malcolm{{nbsp}}X'', p.{{nbsp}}95.&lt;/ref&gt; That year, Little also began signing his name "Malcolm{{nbsp}}X".&lt;ref&gt;Marable, ''Malcolm{{nbsp}}X'', p.{{nbsp}}96.&lt;/ref&gt; He explained in his autobiography that the Muslim's "X" symbolized the true African family name that he could never know. "For me, my 'X' replaced the white slavemaster name of 'Little' which some blue-eyed devil named Little had imposed upon my paternal forebears."&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm{{nbsp}}X, ''Autobiography'', p.{{nbsp}}229.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early ministry ===

{{Nation of Islam}}

After his parole in August 1952,&lt;ref&gt;Marable, ''Malcolm{{nbsp}}X'', p.{{nbsp}}98.&lt;/ref&gt; Malcolm{{nbsp}}X visited Elijah Muhammad in Chicago.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, pp.{{nbsp}}142, 144–145.&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1953 he was named assistant minister of the Nation's Temple Number One in Detroit.&lt;ref&gt;Natambu, p.{{nbsp}}168.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn-ua|Nation of Islam Temples were numbered according to the order in which they were established.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, pp.{{nbsp}}141–142.&lt;/ref&gt; }} Later that year he established Boston's Temple Number{{nbsp}}11;&lt;ref&gt;Perry, p.{{nbsp}}147.&lt;/ref&gt; in March 1954, he expanded Temple Number{{nbsp}}12 in Philadelphia;&lt;ref&gt;Perry, p.{{nbsp}}152.&lt;/ref&gt; and two months later he was selected to lead [[Mosque No. 7|Temple Number{{nbsp}}7]] in Harlem,&lt;ref&gt;Perry, p.{{nbsp}}153.&lt;/ref&gt; where he rapidly expanded its membership.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, pp.{{nbsp}}161–164.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1953, the FBI began surveillance of him, turning its attention from Malcolm{{nbsp}}X's possible communist associations to his rapid ascent in the Nation of Islam.&lt;ref&gt;Carson, p.{{nbsp}}95.&lt;/ref&gt;

During 1955, Malcolm{{nbsp}}X continued his successful recruitment of members on behalf of the Nation of Islam. He established temples in [[Springfield, Massachusetts|Springfield]], Massachusetts (Number{{nbsp}}13); [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]], Connecticut (Number{{nbsp}}14); and [[Atlanta]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] (Number{{nbsp}}15). Hundreds of African Americans were joining the Nation of Islam every month.&lt;ref&gt;Marable, ''Malcolm{{nbsp}}X'', pp.{{nbsp}}122–123.&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides his skill as a speaker, Malcolm{{nbsp}}X had an impressive physical presence. He stood {{convert|6|ft|3|in|m}} tall and weighed about {{convert|180|lb|kg}}.&lt;ref name=Marable301&gt;Marable, "Rediscovering Malcolm's Life", p.{{nbsp}}301.&lt;/ref&gt; One writer described him as "powerfully built",&lt;ref&gt;Lincoln, p.{{nbsp}}189.&lt;/ref&gt; and another as "mesmerizingly handsome … and always spotlessly well-groomed".&lt;ref name=Marable301 /&gt;

=== Marriage and family ===
In 1955, [[Betty Shabazz|Betty Sanders]] met Malcolm{{nbsp}}X after one of his lectures, then again at a dinner party; soon she was regularly attending his lectures. In 1956 she joined the Nation of Islam, changing her name to Betty{{nbsp}}X.&lt;ref&gt;Rickford, pp.{{nbsp}}36–45, 50–51.&lt;/ref&gt; One-on-one dates were contrary to the Nation's teachings, so the couple courted at social events with dozens or hundreds of others, and Malcolm{{nbsp}}X made a point of inviting her on the frequent group visits he led to New York City's museums and libraries.&lt;ref&gt;Rickford, pp.{{nbsp}}61–63.&lt;/ref&gt;

Malcolm{{nbsp}}X proposed during a telephone call from Detroit in January 1958, and they married two days later.&lt;ref&gt;Shabazz, Betty, "Malcolm{{nbsp}}X as a Husband and Father", Clarke, pp.{{nbsp}}132–134.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rickford, pp.{{nbsp}}73–74.&lt;/ref&gt; They had six daughters:

=== Hinton Johnson incident ===
The American public first became aware of Malcolm{{nbsp}}X in 1957, after Hinton Johnson,{{efn-ua|Some sources, including ''The Autobiography of Malcolm{{nbsp}}X'', give the name ''Johnson Hinton'', but Benjamin Karim (one of Malcolm{{nbsp}}X's top aides) and former ''[[Newsweek]]'' editor and Malcolm{{nbsp}}X biographer Peter Goldman both give the name ''Hinton Johnson''.&lt;ref&gt;Karim, pp.{{nbsp}}47–48.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Abdullah |first=Zain |date=Autumn 2012 |title=Narrating Muslim Masculinities: The Fruit of Islam and the Quest for Black Redemption  |journal=Spectrum: A Journal on Black Men |volume=1 |issue=1 |page=169 |doi=10.2979/spectrum.1.1.141 |subscription=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} a Nation of Islam member, was beaten by two New York City police officers.&lt;ref name=Marable127&gt;Marable, ''Malcolm{{nbsp}}X'', p.{{nbsp}}127.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Perry164&gt;Perry, p.{{nbsp}}164.&lt;/ref&gt; On April{{nbsp}}26, Johnson and two other passersby{{mdashb}}also Nation of Islam members{{mdashb}}saw the officers beating an African-American man with nightsticks.&lt;ref name=Marable127 /&gt; When they attempted to intervene, shouting, "You're not in Alabama...this is New York!"&lt;ref name=Perry164 /&gt; one of the officers turned on Johnson, beating him so severely that he suffered brain contusions and subdural hemorrhaging. All four African-American men were arrested.&lt;ref name=Marable127 /&gt; Alerted by a witness, Malcolm{{nbsp}}X and a small group of Muslims went to the police station and demanded to see Johnson.&lt;ref name=Marable127 /&gt; Police initially denied that any Muslims were being held, but when the crowd grew to about five hundred, they allowed Malcolm{{nbsp}}X to speak with Johnson.&lt;ref name=Perry165&gt;Perry, p.{{nbsp}}165.&lt;/ref&gt; Afterward, Malcolm{{nbsp}}X insisted on arranging for an ambulance to take Johnson to Harlem Hospital.&lt;ref name=Marable128&gt;Marable, ''Malcolm{{nbsp}}X'', p.{{nbsp}}128.&lt;/ref&gt;

Johnson's injuries were treated and by the time he was returned to the police station, some four thousand people had gathered outside.&lt;ref name="Perry165" /&gt; Inside the station, Malcolm{{nbsp}}X and an attorney were making bail arrangements for two of the Muslims. Johnson was not bailed, and police said he could not go back to the hospital until his [[arraignment]] the following day.&lt;ref name=Marable128 /&gt; Considering the situation to be at an impasse, Malcolm{{nbsp}}X stepped outside the station house and gave a hand signal to the crowd. Nation members silently left, after which the rest of the crowd also dispersed.&lt;ref name=Marable128 /&gt; One police officer told the ''[[New York Amsterdam News]]'': "No one man should have that much power."&lt;ref name=Marable128 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Perry, p.{{nbsp}}166.&lt;/ref&gt; Within a month the New York City Police Department arranged to keep Malcolm{{nbsp}}X under surveillance; it also made inquiries with authorities in other cities in which he had lived, and prisons in which he had served time.&lt;ref&gt;Marable, ''Malcolm{{nbsp}}X'', p.{{nbsp}}132.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[grand jury]] declined to indict the officers who beat Johnson. In October, Malcolm{{nbsp}}X sent an angry telegram to the police commissioner. Soon the police department assigned undercover officers to infiltrate the Nation of Islam.&lt;ref&gt;Marable, ''Malcolm{{nbsp}}X'', pp.{{nbsp}}134–135.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Increasing prominence ===
By the late 1950s, Malcolm{{nbsp}}X was using a new name, Malcolm Shabazz or Malik el-Shabazz, although he was still widely referred to as Malcolm{{nbsp}}X.&lt;ref&gt;Marable, ''Malcolm{{nbsp}}X'', pp.{{nbsp}}135, 193.&lt;/ref&gt; His comments on issues and events were being widely reported in print, on radio, and on television,&lt;ref name="Perry, pp. 174–179"&gt;Perry, pp.{{nbsp}}174–179.&lt;/ref&gt; and he was featured in a 1959 New York City television broadcast about the Nation of Islam, ''[[The Hate That Hate Produced]]''.&lt;ref name="Perry, pp. 174–179" /&gt;

In September 1960, at the [[United Nations General Assembly]] in New York City, Malcolm{{nbsp}}X was invited to the official functions of several African nations. He met [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] of Egypt, [[Ahmed Sékou Touré]] of Guinea, and [[Kenneth Kaunda]] of the [[Zambian African National Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;Natambu, pp.{{nbsp}}231–233.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fidel Castro]] also attended the Assembly, and Malcolm{{nbsp}}X met publicly with him as part of a welcoming committee of Harlem community leaders.&lt;ref&gt;Marable, ''Malcolm{{nbsp}}X'', p.{{nbsp}}172.&lt;/ref&gt; Castro was sufficiently impressed with Malcolm{{nbsp}}X to suggest a private meeting, and after two hours of talking, Castro invited Malcolm{{nbsp}}X to visit Cuba.&lt;ref&gt;Lincoln, p.{{nbsp}}18.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Advocacy and teachings while with Nation ===
From his adoption of the Nation of Islam in 1952 until he broke with it in 1964, Malcolm{{nbsp}}X promoted the [[#Beliefs of the Nation of Islam|Nation's teachings]]. These included the beliefs:
* that black people are the original people of the world&lt;ref name=Lomax55&gt;Lomax, ''When the Word Is Given'', p.{{nbsp}}55.&lt;/ref&gt;
* that white people are "devils"&lt;ref name=Perry115&gt;Perry, p.{{nbsp}}115.&lt;/ref&gt;
* that [[Black supremacy|blacks are superior]] to whites, and
* that the demise of the white race is imminent.&lt;ref name=Lomax57&gt;Lomax, ''When the Word Is Given'', p.{{nbsp}}57.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many whites and some blacks were alarmed by Malcolm{{nbsp}}X and the statements he made during this period. He and the Nation of Islam were described as hatemongers, black supremacists, racists, violence-seekers, segregationists, and a threat to improved race relations. He was accused of being [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]].&lt;ref&gt;Lomax, ''When the Word Is Given'', p.{{nbsp}}172.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the goals of the [[civil rights movement]] was to end [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchisement]] of African Americans, but the Nation of Islam forbade its members from participating in voting and other aspects of the political process.&lt;ref&gt;Natambu, p.{{nbsp}}260.&lt;/ref&gt; Civil rights organizations denounced him and the Nation as irresponsible extremists whose views did not represent African Americans.&lt;ref&gt;Marable, ''Malcolm{{nbsp}}X'', p.{{nbsp}}162.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Natambu, pp.{{nbsp}}215–216.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,811191-1,00.html |title=The Black Supremacists |work=Time |date=August 10, 1959 |accessdate=October 2, 2014 |subscription=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Malcolm{{nbsp}}X was equally critical of the civil rights movement.&lt;ref&gt;Lomax, ''When the Word Is Given'', pp.{{nbsp}}79–80.&lt;/ref&gt; He labeled [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] a "chump" and other civil rights leaders "stooges" of the white establishment.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, p.{{nbsp}}203.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn-ua|King expressed mixed feelings toward Malcolm{{nbsp}}X. "He is very articulate{{nbsp}}... but I totally disagree with many of his political and philosophical views{{nbsp}}... I don't want to seem to sound self-righteous{{nbsp}}... or that I think I have the only truth, the only way. Maybe he does have some of the answer{{nbsp}}... I have often wished that he would talk less of violence, because violence is not going to solve our problem. And in his litany of articulating the despair of the Negro without offering any positive, creative alternative, I feel that Malcolm has done himself and our people a great disservice{{nbsp}}... [U]rging Negroes to arm themselves and prepare to engage in violence, as he has done, can reap nothing but grief."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://playboysfw.kinja.com/martin-luther-king-jr-part-2-of-a-candid-conversation-1502358645 |accessdate=June 19, 2018 |title=The Playboy Interview: Martin Luther King |last=Haley |first=Alex |authorlink=Alex Haley |date=January 1965 |work=[[Playboy]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; }} He called the 1963 [[March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom|March on Washington]] "the farce on Washington",&lt;ref&gt;Cone, p.{{nbsp}}113.&lt;/ref&gt; and said he did not know why so many black people were excited about a demonstration "run by whites in front of a statue of a president who has been dead for a hundred years and who didn't like us when he was alive".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/malcolmx/timeline/timeline2.html |title=Timeline |accessdate=November 11, 2017 |date=May 19, 2005 |work=[[Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X: Make It Plain]], [[American Experience]] |publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050526135314/https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/malcolmx/timeline/timeline2.html |archivedate=May 26, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the civil rights movement fought against [[Racial segregation in the United States|racial segregation]], Malcolm{{nbsp}}X advocated the complete [[Black separatism|separation]] of African Americans from whites. He proposed that [[Back-to-Africa movement|African Americans should return to Africa]] and that, in the interim, a separate country for black people in America should be created.&lt;ref name=Lomax149-152&gt;Lomax, ''When the Word Is Given'', pp.{{nbsp}}149–152.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Supremacy78&gt;Malcolm{{nbsp}}X, ''End of White World Supremacy'', p.{{nbsp}}78.&lt;/ref&gt; He rejected the civil rights movement's strategy of [[nonviolence]], expressing the opinion that black people should defend and advance themselves "[[by any means necessary]]".&lt;ref name="Lomax 173-174"&gt;Lomax, ''When the Word Is Given'', pp.{{nbsp}}173–174.&lt;/ref&gt; His speeches had a powerful effect on his audiences, who were generally African Americans in [[Northern United States|northern]] and [[Western United States|western]] cities. Many of them{{mdashb}}tired of being told to wait for freedom, justice, equality and respect&lt;ref&gt;Natambu, p.{{nbsp}}182.&lt;/ref&gt;{{mdashb}}felt that he articulated their complaints better than did the civil rights movement.&lt;ref name=Cone99-100&gt;Cone, pp.{{nbsp}}99–100.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=West&gt;{{cite book |last1=West |first1=Cornel |authorlink1=Cornel West |editor1-last=Sayres |editor1-first=Sohnya |editor2-last=Stephanson |editor2-first=Anders |editor3-last=Aronowitz |editor3-first=Stanley |editor3-link=Stanley Aronowitz |editor4-last=Jameson |editor4-first=Fredric |editor4-link=Fredric Jameson  |title=The 60s Without Apology |year=1984 |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |location=Minneapolis |isbn=978-0-8166-1336-6 |page=51 |chapter=The Paradox of the Afro-American Rebellion }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Malcolm{{nbsp}}X is widely regarded as the second most influential leader of the Nation of Islam after Elijah Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;Cone, p.{{nbsp}}91.&lt;/ref&gt; He was largely credited with the group's dramatic increase in membership between the early 1950s and early 1960s (from 500 to 25,000 by one estimate;{{efn-ua|"Estimates of the Black Muslim membership vary from a quarter of a million down to fifty thousand.

He inspired the boxer Cassius Clay (later known as [[Muhammad Ali]]) to join the Nation,&lt;ref&gt;Natambu, pp.{{nbsp}}296–297.&lt;/ref&gt; and the two became close;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=David |last=Remnick |authorlink=David Remnick |title=King of the World: Muhammed Ali and the Rise of an American Hero |year=1999 |origyear=1998 |publisher=Vintage Books |location=New York |isbn=978-0-375-70229-7 |page=165 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In January 1964, Clay brought Malcolm{{nbsp}}X and his family to Miami to watch him train for [[Muhammad Ali vs. Sonny Liston#Liston vs. Clay|his fight against Sonny Liston]].&lt;ref&gt;Rickford, p.{{nbsp}}165.&lt;/ref&gt;
When Malcolm{{nbsp}}X left the Nation of Islam, he tried to convince Clay to join him in converting to [[Sunni Islam]], but Clay instead broke ties with him{{mdashb}}which Clay later described as one of his greatest regrets.{{efn-ua|"Turning my back on Malcolm was one of the mistakes that I regret most in my life. I wish I'd been able to tell Malcolm that I was sorry, that he was right about so many things. But he was killed before I got the chance... I might never have become a Muslim if it hadn't been for Malcolm. If I could go back and do it over again, I would never have turned my back on him."&lt;ref&gt;Ali, p.{{nbsp}}85.&lt;/ref&gt; }}

&lt;!--this paragraph needs to be expanded--&gt;Malcolm{{nbsp}}X mentored and guided Louis{{nbsp}}X (later known as [[Louis Farrakhan]]), who eventually became the leader of the Nation of Islam.&lt;ref&gt;Manning, ''Malcolm{{nbsp}}X''.&lt;/ref&gt; Malcolm{{nbsp}}X also served as a mentor and confidant to Elijah Muhammad's son, [[Warith Deen Mohammed|Wallace D. Muhammad]]; the son told Malcolm X about his skepticism toward his father's "unorthodox approach" to Islam.&lt;ref&gt;Marsh, p.{{nbsp}}101.&lt;/ref&gt; Wallace Muhammad was excommunicated from the Nation of Islam several times, although he was eventually readmitted.&lt;ref&gt;Marsh, pp.{{nbsp}}58–59, 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disillusionment and departure ==
During 1962 and 1963, events caused Malcolm{{nbsp}}X to reassess his relationship with the Nation of Islam, and particularly its leader, Elijah Muhammad.

=== Lack of NOI response to LAPD violence ===
In late 1961, there were violent confrontations between NOI members and police in South Central Los Angeles, and numerous Muslims were arrested. They were acquitted, but tensions had been raised. Just after midnight on April{{nbsp}}27, 1962, two [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] officers shoved and beat several Muslims outside Temple Number 27 without provocation. A large crowd of angry Muslims came outside from the mosque. The officers attempted to intimidate the crowd. One officer was disarmed by the crowd; his partner was shot in the elbow by a third officer. More than 70 backup officers arrived. They raided the mosque and randomly beat NOI members. Police officers shot seven Muslims, including William X Rogers, who was hit in the back and paralyzed for life, and Ronald Stokes, a Korean War veteran, who was shot from behind while raising his hands over his head to surrender, killing him.&lt;ref name=Branch&gt;Branch, pp.{{nbsp}}3–20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Marable205&gt;Marable, ''Malcolm{{nbsp}}X'', pp.{{nbsp}}205–210.&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of Muslims were indicted after the event, but no charges were made against the police. Furthermore, the coroner ruled that Stokes's killing was justified. To Malcolm{{nbsp}}X, the desecration of the mosque and the violence demanded action, and he used what Farrakhan later called his "gangsterlike past" to rally the more hardened of the NOI members to take violent action against the police. Malcolm{{nbsp}}X sought Elijah Muhammad's approval but was denied. Malcolm{{nbsp}}X was stunned by this response. Malcolm{{nbsp}}X also spoke of the NOI starting to work with civil rights organizations, local black politicians, and religious groups, another initiative blocked by Muhammad. Louis{{nbsp}}X saw this as an important turning point in the deteriorating relationship between Malcolm{{nbsp}}X and Muhammad.&lt;ref name=Branch/&gt;&lt;ref name=Marable205/&gt;

=== Sexual misbehavior by Elijah Muhammad ===
Rumors were circulating that Muhammad was conducting extramarital affairs with young Nation secretaries{{mdashb}}which would constitute a serious violation of Nation teachings. After first discounting the rumors, Malcolm{{nbsp}}X came to believe them after he spoke with Muhammad's son [[Warith Deen Mohammed|Wallace]] and with the women making the accusations. Muhammad confirmed the rumors in 1963, attempting to justify his behavior by referring to precedents set by Biblical prophets.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, pp.{{nbsp}}230–234.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== NOI response to his remarks on Kennedy assassination ===
[[File:Malcolm X March 26 1964 cropped retouched.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|right|Malcolm X before a 1964 press conference|alt=Malcolm X before a 1964 press conference]]

On December{{nbsp}}1, 1963, when asked for a comment about the [[John F. Kennedy assassination|assassination of President John F. Kennedy]], Malcolm{{nbsp}}X said that it was a case of "[[wikt: come home to roost|chickens coming home to roost]]". He added that "chickens coming home to roost never did make me sad; they've always made me glad."&lt;ref name=Times63-12-02&gt;{{Cite news |title=Malcolm X Scores U.S. and Kennedy |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1963/12/02/archives/malcolm-x-scores-us-and-kennedy-likens-slaying-to-chickens-coming.html |newspaper=The New York Times |page=21 |date=December 2, 1963 |accessdate=June 19, 2018 |subscription=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote, "in further criticism of Mr. Kennedy, the Muslim leader cited the murders of [[Patrice Lumumba]], Congo leader, of [[Medgar Evers]], civil rights leader, and of the [[16th Street Baptist Church bombing|Negro girls bombed]] earlier this year in a [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]] church. These, he said, were instances of other 'chickens coming home to roost'."&lt;ref name=Times63-12-02 /&gt; The remarks prompted a widespread public outcry. The Nation of Islam, which had sent a message of condolence to the Kennedy family and ordered its ministers not to comment on the assassination, publicly censured their former shining star.&lt;ref&gt;Natambu, pp.{{nbsp}}288–290.&lt;/ref&gt; Malcolm{{nbsp}}X retained his post and rank as minister, but was prohibited from public speaking for 90 days.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, p.{{nbsp}}242.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Media attention to Malcolm{{nbsp}}X over Muhammad ===

Malcolm{{nbsp}}X had by now become a media favorite, and some Nation members believed he was a threat to Muhammad's leadership. Publishers had shown interest in Malcolm{{nbsp}}X's autobiography, and when [[Louis Lomax]] wrote his 1963 book about the Nation, ''When the Word Is Given'', he used a photograph of Malcolm{{nbsp}}X on the cover. He also reproduced five of his speeches, but featured only one of Muhammad's{{mdashb}}all of which greatly upset Muhammad and made him envious.&lt;ref name=Perry214 /&gt;

=== Departure from NOI ===

On March{{nbsp}}8, 1964, Malcolm{{nbsp}}X publicly announced his break from the Nation of Islam. He was still a Muslim, he said, but felt that the Nation had "gone as far as it can" because of its rigid teachings. He said he was planning to organize a [[Black nationalism|black nationalist]] organization to "heighten the political consciousness" of African Americans. He also expressed a desire to work with other civil rights leaders, saying that Elijah Muhammad had prevented him from doing so in the past.&lt;ref name=Times64-03-09&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1964/03/09/archives/malcolm-x-splits-with-muhammad-suspended-muslim-leader-plans-black.html |title=Malcolm X Splits with Muhammad |accessdate=June 19, 2018 |last=Handler |first=M.

== Activity after leaving NOI ==
[[File: MLK and Malcolm X USNWR cropped.jpg|thumb|right|Malcolm X's only meeting with [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], March{{nbsp}}26, 1964|alt=Malcolm X and Martin Luther King speak to each other thoughtfully as others look on]]

After leaving the Nation of Islam, Malcolm{{nbsp}}X founded [[Muslim Mosque, Inc.]] (MMI), a religious organization,&lt;ref&gt;Perry, pp.{{nbsp}}251–252.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm{{nbsp}}X, ''Malcolm{{nbsp}}X Speaks'', pp.{{nbsp}}18–22.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Organization of Afro-American Unity]] (OAAU), a secular group that advocated [[Pan-Africanism]].&lt;ref&gt;Perry, pp.{{nbsp}}294–296.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm{{nbsp}}X, ''By Any Means Necessary'', pp.{{nbsp}}33–67.&lt;/ref&gt; On March{{nbsp}}26, 1964, he met [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] for the first and only time{{mdashb}}and only long enough for photographs to be taken{{mdashb}}in Washington, D.C., as both men attended the [[United States Senate|Senate's]] debate on the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|Civil Rights bill]].{{efn-ua|"There was no time for substantive discussions between the two. They were photographed greeting each other warmly, smiling and shaking hands."&lt;ref&gt;Cone, p.{{nbsp}}2.&lt;/ref&gt; }}{{efn-ua|"Camera shutters clicked. The next day, the ''Chicago Sun-Times'', the ''New York World-Telegram and Sun'', and other dailies carried a picture of Malcolm and Martin shaking hands."&lt;ref&gt;Perry, p.{{nbsp}}255.&lt;/ref&gt; }} In April, Malcolm{{nbsp}}X gave a speech titled "[[The Ballot or the Bullet]]", in which he advised African Americans to exercise their right to vote wisely but cautioned that if the government continued to prevent African Americans from attaining full equality, it might be necessary for them to take up arms.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, pp.{{nbsp}}257–259.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm{{nbsp}}X, ''Malcolm{{nbsp}}X Speaks'', pp.{{nbsp}}23–44.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the weeks after he left the Nation of Islam, several [[Sunni Islam|Sunni Muslims]] encouraged Malcolm{{nbsp}}X to learn about their faith. He soon converted to the Sunni faith.&lt;ref&gt;Marable, ''Malcolm{{nbsp}}X'', pp.{{nbsp}}300–301.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Perry, p.{{nbsp}}261.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pilgrimage to Mecca ===

In April 1964, with financial help from his half-sister Ella Little-Collins, Malcolm{{nbsp}}X flew to [[Jeddah]], Saudi Arabia, as the start of his [[Hajj]], the pilgrimage to [[Mecca]] obligatory for every Muslim who is able to do so. He was delayed in Jeddah when his U.S. citizenship and inability to speak [[Arabic language|Arabic]] caused his status as a Muslim to be questioned.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, pp.{{nbsp}}262–263.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;DeCaro, p.{{nbsp}}204.&lt;/ref&gt; He had received [[Abdul Rahman Hassan Azzam]]'s book ''The Eternal Message of Muhammad'' with his visa approval, and he contacted the author. Azzam's son arranged for his release and lent him his personal hotel suite. The next morning Malcolm{{nbsp}}X learned that [[Faisal of Saudi Arabia|Prince Faisal]] had designated him as a state guest.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, pp.{{nbsp}}263–265.&lt;/ref&gt; Several days later, after completing the Hajj rituals, Malcolm{{nbsp}}X had an audience with the prince.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, p.{{nbsp}}267.&lt;/ref&gt;

Malcolm{{nbsp}}X later said that seeing Muslims of "all colors, from blue-eyed blonds to black-skinned Africans," interacting as equals led him to see Islam as a means by which racial problems could be overcome.&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm{{nbsp}}X, ''Autobiography'', pp.{{nbsp}}388–393; quote from pp.{{nbsp}}390–391.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Africa ===
[[File:Malcolm X NYWTS 4.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|right|Malcolm X, after his 1964 pilgrimage to Mecca|alt=Malcolm X in 1964]]

Malcolm{{nbsp}}X had already visited the [[United Arab Republic]] (a short-lived political union between Egypt and Syria), Sudan, Nigeria, and Ghana in 1959 to make arrangements for a tour of Africa by Elijah Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;Lomax, ''When the Word Is Given'', p.{{nbsp}}62.&lt;/ref&gt; After his journey to Mecca in 1964, he visited Africa a second time. He returned to the United States in late May&lt;ref&gt;Natambu, p.{{nbsp}}303.&lt;/ref&gt; and flew to Africa again in July.&lt;ref&gt;Carson, p.{{nbsp}}305.&lt;/ref&gt; During these visits he met officials, gave interviews, and spoke on radio and television in Egypt, Ethiopia, [[Tanganyika]], Nigeria, Ghana, Guinea, Sudan, Senegal, Liberia, Algeria, and Morocco.&lt;ref&gt;Natambu, pp.{{nbsp}}304–305.&lt;/ref&gt; In Cairo, he attended the second meeting of the [[Organization of African Unity]] as a representative of the OAAU.&lt;ref&gt;Marable, ''Malcolm{{nbsp}}X'', pp.{{nbsp}}360–362.&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of this third visit, he had met with essentially all of Africa's prominent leaders;&lt;ref name=Natambu308 /&gt; [[Kwame Nkrumah]] of Ghana, [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] of Egypt, and [[Ahmed Ben Bella]] of Algeria had all invited Malcolm{{nbsp}}X to serve in their governments.&lt;ref name=Natambu308&gt;Natambu, p.{{nbsp}}308.&lt;/ref&gt; After he spoke at the [[University of Ibadan]], the Nigerian Muslim Students Association bestowed on him the honorary [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]] name ''Omowale'' ("the son who has come home").&lt;ref&gt;Perry, p.{{nbsp}}269.&lt;/ref&gt; He later called this his most treasured honor.&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm{{nbsp}}X, ''Autobiography'', p.{{nbsp}}403.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== France and United Kingdom ===
On November{{nbsp}}23, 1964, on his way home from Africa, Malcolm{{nbsp}}X stopped in Paris, where he spoke in the [[Maison de la Mutualité|Salle de la Mutualité]].&lt;ref&gt;Bethune, Lebert, "Malcolm{{nbsp}}X in Europe", Clarke, pp.{{nbsp}}226–231.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm{{nbsp}}X, ''By Any Means Necessary'', pp.{{nbsp}}113–126.&lt;/ref&gt; A week later, on November{{nbsp}}30, Malcolm{{nbsp}}X flew to the United Kingdom, and on December{{nbsp}}3 took part in a [[Debate#Oxford-Style debate|debate]] at the [[Oxford Union]] Society. The motion was taken from a statement made earlier that year by [[Barry Goldwater presidential campaign, 1964|U.S. presidential candidate]] [[Barry Goldwater]]: "Extremism in the Defense of Liberty is No Vice; Moderation in the Pursuit of Justice is No Virtue".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/1964-republican-convention-revolution-from-the-right-915921/?all |title=1964 Republican Convention: Revolution from the Right |first=Rick |last=Perlstein |authorlink=Rick Perlstein |date=August 2008 |work=[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian Magazine]] |accessdate=June 20, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Malcolm{{nbsp}}X argued for the affirmative, and interest in the debate was so high that it was televised nationally by the [[BBC]].&lt;ref&gt;Bethune, "Malcolm{{nbsp}}X in Europe", Clarke, pp.{{nbsp}}231–233.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brothermalcolm.net/2003/mx_oxford/index.html |title=Malcolm X Oxford Debate |accessdate=October 2, 2014 |author=Malcolm X |date=December 3, 1964 |publisher=Malcolm X: A Research Site }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February{{nbsp}}5, 1965, Malcolm{{nbsp}}X flew to Britain again,&lt;ref&gt;Carson, p.{{nbsp}}349.&lt;/ref&gt; and on February{{nbsp}}8 he addressed the first meeting of the Council of African Organizations in London.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, p.{{nbsp}}351.&lt;/ref&gt; The next day he tried to return to France, but was refused entry.&lt;ref&gt;Natambu, p.{{nbsp}}312.&lt;/ref&gt;

On February{{nbsp}}12, he visited [[Smethwick]], near [[Birmingham]], where the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] [[Smethwick in the 1964 general election|had won the parliamentary seat]] in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1964|1964 general election]]. The town had become a byword for racial division after Conservative supporters used the slogan, "If you want a nigger for a neighbour, vote [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]]." In Smethwick he compared the treatment of ethnic minority residents with the treatment of Jews under Hitler, saying: "I would not wait for the fascist element in Smethwick to erect gas ovens."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.irr.org.uk/news/black-british-history-remembering-malcolms-visit-to-smethwick/ |title=Black British History: Remembering Malcolm's Visit to Smethwick |accessdate=October 2, 2014 |last=Kundnani |first=Arun |date=February 10, 2005 |work=Independent Race and Refugee News Network |publisher=[[Institute of Race Relations]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/15/britains-most-racist-election-smethwick-50-years-on |title=Britain's Most Racist Election: The Story of Smethwick, 50 Years On |first=Stuart |last=Jeffries |date=October 15, 2014 |work=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=April 17, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Return to United States ===
After returning to the U.S., Malcolm{{nbsp}}X addressed a wide variety of audiences. He spoke regularly at meetings held by MMI and the OAAU, and was one of the most sought-after speakers on college campuses.&lt;ref&gt;Terrill, p.{{nbsp}}9.&lt;/ref&gt; One of his top aides later wrote that he "welcomed every opportunity to speak to college students".&lt;ref&gt;Karim, p.{{nbsp}}128.&lt;/ref&gt; He also addressed public meetings of the [[Socialist Workers Party (United States)|Socialist Workers Party]], speaking at their Militant Labor Forum.&lt;ref name=Perry277-278&gt;Perry, pp.{{nbsp}}277–278.&lt;/ref&gt; He was interviewed on the subjects of segregation and the Nation of Islam by [[Robert Penn Warren]] for Warren's 1965 book ''[[Who Speaks for the Negro?]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Robert Penn Warren Center for the Humanities|title=Malcolm X|url=http://whospeaks.library.vanderbilt.edu/interview/malcolm-x|publisher=Robert Penn Warren's ''[[Who Speaks for the Negro?]]'' Archive|accessdate=March 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Death threats and intimidation from Nation of Islam ==

Throughout 1964, as his conflict with the Nation of Islam intensified, Malcolm{{nbsp}}X was repeatedly threatened.

In February, a leader of Temple Number Seven ordered the bombing of Malcolm{{nbsp}}X's car.&lt;ref&gt;Karim, pp.{{nbsp}}159–160.&lt;/ref&gt; In March, Muhammad told Boston minister Louis{{nbsp}}X (later known as [[Louis Farrakhan]]) that "hypocrites like Malcolm should have their heads cut off";&lt;ref&gt;Kondo, p.{{nbsp}}170.&lt;/ref&gt; the April{{nbsp}}10 edition of ''[[Muhammad Speaks]]'' featured a cartoon depicting Malcolm{{nbsp}}X's bouncing, severed head.&lt;ref&gt;Friedly, p.{{nbsp}}169.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.columbia.edu/cu/ccbh/mxp/images/sourcebook_img_111.jpg |title=On My Own |accessdate=October 2, 2014 |last=Majied |first=Eugene |date=April 10, 1964 |work=[[Muhammad Speaks]] |publisher=[[Nation of Islam]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June{{nbsp}}8, FBI surveillance recorded a telephone call in which Betty Shabazz was told that her husband was "as good as dead".&lt;ref&gt;Carson, p.{{nbsp}}473.&lt;/ref&gt; Four days later, an FBI informant received a tip that "Malcolm{{nbsp}}X is going to be bumped off."&lt;ref&gt;Carson, p.{{nbsp}}324.&lt;/ref&gt; (That same month the Nation sued to reclaim Malcolm{{nbsp}}X's residence in [[East Elmhurst, Queens|East Elmhurst]], [[Queens]], New York. His family was ordered to vacate&lt;ref&gt;Perry, pp.{{nbsp}}290–292.&lt;/ref&gt; but on February{{nbsp}}14, 1965{{mdashb}}the night before a hearing on postponing the eviction{{mdashb}}the house was destroyed by fire.)&lt;ref&gt;Perry, pp.{{nbsp}}352–356.&lt;/ref&gt;

On July{{nbsp}}9 Muhammad aide John Ali (suspected of being an undercover FBI agent)&lt;ref name=Lomax198&gt;Lomax, ''To Kill a Black Man'', p.{{nbsp}}198.&lt;/ref&gt; referred to Malcolm{{nbsp}}X by saying, "Anyone who opposes the Honorable Elijah Muhammad puts their life in jeopardy."&lt;ref&gt;Evanzz, p.{{nbsp}}248.&lt;/ref&gt; In the December{{nbsp}}4 issue of ''Muhammad Speaks'', Louis{{nbsp}}X wrote that "such a man as Malcolm is worthy of death".&lt;ref&gt;Evanzz, p.{{nbsp}}264.&lt;/ref&gt;

The September 1964 issue of ''[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]]'' dramatized Malcolm{{nbsp}}X's defiance of these threats by publishing a photograph of him holding an [[M1 carbine]] while peering out a window.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120114124627/http://www.usnews.com/usnews/culture/articles/921123/archive_018698.htm |url=https://www.usnews.com/usnews/culture/articles/921123/archive_018698.htm |title=The Legacy of Malcolm X |last1=Lord |last2=Thornton |last3=Bodipo-Memba |date=November 15, 1992 |work=U.S. News&amp;nbsp;&amp; World Report |page=3 |archivedate=January 14, 2012 |accessdate=March 20, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JaT6tBKGK3sC&amp;pg=PA38 |last=Massaquoi |first=Hans J. |title=Mystery of Malcolm X |work=[[Ebony (magazine)|Ebony]] |date=September 1964 |pages=38–40, 42, 44–46 |accessdate=April 4, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Funeral ===
The public viewing, February{{nbsp}}23{{ndash}}26 at Unity Funeral Home in Harlem, was attended by some 14,000 to 30,000 mourners.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, p.{{nbsp}}374. Alex Haley, in his Epilogue to ''The Autobiography of Malcolm{{nbsp}}X'', says 22,000 (p. 519).&lt;/ref&gt;
For the funeral on February{{nbsp}}27, loudspeakers were set up for the overflow crowd outside Harlem's thousand-seat Faith Temple of the [[Church of God in Christ]],&lt;ref name=Rickford252&gt;Rickford, p.{{nbsp}}252.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;DeCaro, p.{{nbsp}}291.&lt;/ref&gt; and a local television station carried the service live.&lt;ref name=Times65-02-28&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1965/02/28/archives/harlem-is-quiet-as-crowds-watch-malcolm-x-rites-murdered-leader-of.html |title=Harlem Is Quiet as Crowds Watch Malcolm X Rites |accessdate=June 19, 2018 |last=Arnold |first=Martin |date=February 28, 1965 |page=1 |newspaper=The New York Times |subscription=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the civil rights leaders attending were [[John Lewis (Georgia politician)|John Lewis]], [[Bayard Rustin]], [[James Forman]], [[James Farmer]], [[Jesse Gray]], and [[Andrew Young]].&lt;ref name=Rickford252 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;DeCaro, p.{{nbsp}}290.&lt;/ref&gt; Actor and activist [[Ossie Davis]] delivered the eulogy, describing Malcolm{{nbsp}}X as "our shining black prince{{nbsp}}... who didn't hesitate to die, because he loved us so":
&lt;blockquote&gt;There are those who will consider it their duty, as friends of the Negro people, to tell us to revile him, to flee, even from the presence of his memory, to save ourselves by writing him out of the history of our turbulent times. Many will ask what Harlem finds to honor in this stormy, controversial and bold young captain{{mdashb}}and we will smile. Many will say turn away{{mdashb}}away from this man, for he is not a man but a demon, a monster, a subverter and an enemy of the black man{{mdashb}}and we will smile. They will say that he is of hate{{mdashb}}a fanatic, a racist{{mdashb}}who can only bring evil to the cause for which you struggle! And we will answer and say to them: Did you ever talk to Brother Malcolm? Did you ever touch him, or have him smile at you? Did you ever really listen to him? Did he ever do a mean thing? Was he ever himself associated with violence or any public disturbance? For if you did you would know him. And if you knew him you would know why we must honor him{{nbsp}}...

=== Reactions ===
Reactions to Malcolm{{nbsp}}X's assassination were varied. In a telegram to Betty Shabazz, [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] expressed his sadness at "the shocking and tragic assassination of your husband".&lt;ref name="stan" /&gt; He said,
&lt;blockquote&gt;While we did not always see eye to eye on methods to solve the race problem, I always had a deep affection for Malcolm and felt that he had a great ability to put his finger on the existence and root of the problem. He was an eloquent spokesman for his point of view and no one can honestly doubt that Malcolm had a great concern for the problems that we face as a race.&lt;ref name="stan"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://kingencyclopedia.stanford.edu/encyclopedia/documentsentry/telegram_from_martin_luther_king_jr_to_betty_al_shabazz/ |title=Telegram from Martin Luther King Jr. to Betty al-Shabazz |last=King Jr. |first=Martin Luther |authorlink=Martin Luther King Jr. |publisher=The Martin Luther King Jr. Research and Education Institute |date=February 26, 1965 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160201130347/http://kingencyclopedia.stanford.edu/encyclopedia/documentsentry/telegram_from_martin_luther_king_jr_to_betty_al_shabazz/ |archivedate=February 1, 2016 |accessdate=May 28, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Elijah Muhammad]] told the annual [[Saviours' Day|Savior's Day]] convention on February{{nbsp}}26, "Malcolm{{nbsp}}X got just what he preached", but denied any involvement with the murder.&lt;ref&gt;Evanzz, p.{{nbsp}}301.&lt;/ref&gt; "We didn't want to kill Malcolm and didn't try to kill him", Muhammad said. "We know such ignorant, foolish teachings would bring him to his own end."&lt;ref&gt;Clegg, p.{{nbsp}}232.&lt;/ref&gt;

Writer [[James Baldwin]], who had been a friend of Malcolm{{nbsp}}X's, was in London when he heard the news of the assassination. He responded with indignation towards the reporters interviewing him, shouting, "You did it! It is because of you—the men that created this white supremacy—that this man is dead. You are not guilty, but you did it&amp;nbsp;... Your mills, your cities, your rape of a continent started all this."&lt;ref&gt;DeCaro, p.{{nbsp}}285.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[New York Post]]'' wrote that "even his sharpest critics recognized his brilliance{{mdashb}}often wild, unpredictable and eccentric, but nevertheless possessing promise that must now remain unrealized".&lt;ref&gt;Rickford, p.{{nbsp}}247.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that Malcolm{{nbsp}}X was "an extraordinary and twisted man" who "turn[ed] many true gifts to evil purpose" and that his life was "strangely and pitifully wasted".&lt;ref name=Times65-02-22&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1965/02/22/archives/malcolm-x.html |title=Malcolm X |accessdate=June 19, 2018 |date=February 22, 1965 |page=20 |newspaper=The New York Times |subscription=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' called him "an unashamed demagogue" whose "creed was violence."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,839291,00.html |title=Death and Transfiguration |date=March 5, 1965 |journal=Time |accessdate=October 2, 2014 |subscription=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside of the U.S., and particularly in Africa, the press was sympathetic.&lt;ref name=Rickford248&gt;Rickford, p.{{nbsp}}248.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Daily Times of Nigeria]]'' wrote that Malcolm{{nbsp}}X would "have a place in the palace of martyrs".&lt;ref name=Evanzz305&gt;Evanzz, p.{{nbsp}}305.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Ghanaian Times]]'' likened him to [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]], [[Medgar Evers]], and [[Patrice Lumumba]], and counted him among "a host of Africans and Americans who were martyred in freedom's cause".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1965/02/26/archives/malcolm-called-a-martyr-abroad-rowan-asserts-murder-was.html |title=Malcolm Called a Martyr Abroad |accessdate=June 19, 2018 |last=Kenworthy |first=E.

In a weekly column he wrote for the ''[[New York Amsterdam News]]'', King reflected on Malcolm{{nbsp}}X and his
assassination:
&lt;blockquote&gt; Malcolm{{nbsp}}X came to the fore as a public figure partially as a result of a TV documentary entitled, ''The Hate that Hate Produced''. That title points to the nature of Malcolm's life and death.

Malcolm{{nbsp}}X was clearly a product of the hate and violence invested in the Negro's blighted existence in this nation. ...

In his youth, there was no hope, no preaching, teaching or movements of non-violence. ...

It is a testimony to Malcolm's personal depth and integrity that he could not become an underworld Czar, but turned again and again to religion for meaning and destiny. Malcolm was still turning and growing at the time of his brutal and meaningless assassination. ...

Like the murder of Lumumba, the murder of Malcolm{{nbsp}}X deprives the world of a potentially great leader. I could not agree with either of these men, but I could see in them a capacity for leadership which I could respect, and which was just beginning to mature in judgment and statesmanship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fultonhistory.com/Newspaper%2024/New%20York%20NY%20Amsterdam%20News/New%20York%20NY%20Amsterdam%20News%201965/New%20York%20NY%20Amsterdam%20News%201965%2000216_1.pdf |title=The Nightmare of Violence |last=King Jr. |first=Martin Luther

=== Allegations of conspiracy ===
[[File:Louis Farrakhan, smiling.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|[[Louis Farrakhan]] in 2005|alt=Louis Farrakhan in 2005]]
Within days, the question of who bore responsibility for the assassination was being publicly debated. On February{{nbsp}}23, James Farmer, the leader of the [[Congress of Racial Equality]], announced at a news conference that local drug dealers, and not the Nation of Islam, were to blame.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, p.{{nbsp}}371.&lt;/ref&gt; Others accused the [[New York City Police Department|NYPD]], the FBI, or the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]], citing the lack of police protection, the ease with which the assassins entered the Audubon Ballroom, and the failure of the police to preserve the crime scene.&lt;ref&gt;Marable, "Rediscovering Malcolm's Life", pp.{{nbsp}}305–306.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Perry, p.{{nbsp}}372.&lt;/ref&gt; Earl Grant, one of Malcolm{{nbsp}}X's associates who was present at the assassination, later wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[A]bout five minutes later, a most incredible scene took place. Into the hall sauntered about a dozen policemen. They were strolling at about the pace one would expect of them if they were patrolling a quiet park. They did not seem to be at all excited or concerned about the circumstances.&lt;p&gt;I could hardly believe my eyes. Here were New York City policemen, entering a room from which at least a dozen shots had been heard, and yet not one of them had his gun out! As a matter of absolute fact, some of them even had their hands in their pockets.&lt;ref&gt;Grant, Earl, "The Last Days of Malcolm{{nbsp}}X", Clarke, p.{{nbsp}}96.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the 1970s, the public learned about [[COINTELPRO]] and other secret FBI programs established to infiltrate and disrupt civil rights organizations during the 1950s and 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Kondo, pp.{{nbsp}}7–39.&lt;/ref&gt; John Ali, national secretary of the Nation of Islam, was believed to have been an FBI undercover agent.&lt;ref name="Lomax198" /&gt; Malcolm{{nbsp}}X had confided to a reporter that Ali exacerbated tensions between him and Elijah Muhammad and that he considered Ali his "archenemy" within the Nation of Islam leadership.&lt;ref name=Lomax198 /&gt; Ali had a meeting with Talmadge Hayer, one of the men convicted of killing Malcolm{{nbsp}}X, the night before the assassination.&lt;ref&gt;Evanzz, p.{{nbsp}}294.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Shabazz family are among those who have accused Louis Farrakhan of involvement in Malcolm{{nbsp}}X's assassination.&lt;ref&gt;Rickford, pp.{{nbsp}}437, 492–495.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Evanzz, pp.{{nbsp}}298–299.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Friedly, p.{{nbsp}}253.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kondo, pp.{{nbsp}}182–183, 193–194.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marable, "Rediscovering Malcolm's Life", p.{{nbsp}}305.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1993 speech Farrakhan seemed to acknowledge the possibility that the Nation of Islam was responsible:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Was Malcolm your traitor or ours? And if we dealt with him like a nation deals with a traitor, what the ''hell'' business is it of yours? A nation has to be able to deal with traitors and cutthroats and turncoats.&lt;ref&gt;Rickford, p.{{nbsp}}492.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/brotherministerthemartyrdomofmalcolmx_c0098f.htm |title=Brother Minister: The Martyrdom of Malcolm X |accessdate=October 2, 2014 |last=Wartofsky |first=Alona |date=February 17, 1995 |work=The Washington Post }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a ''[[60 Minutes]]'' interview that aired during May 2000, Farrakhan stated that some things he said may have led to the assassination of Malcolm{{nbsp}}X. "I may have been complicit in words that I spoke", he said. "I acknowledge that and regret that any word that I have said caused the loss of life of a human being."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/farrakhan-admission-on-malcolm-x/ |title=Farrakhan Admission on Malcolm X |accessdate=October 2, 2014 |date=May 14, 2000 |work=[[60 Minutes]] |publisher=[[CBS News]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; A few days later Farrakhan denied that he "ordered the assassination" of Malcolm{{nbsp}}X, although he again acknowledged that he "created the atmosphere that ultimately led to Malcolm{{nbsp}}X's assassination".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.finalcall.com/artman/publish/Perspectives_1/article_9611.shtml |title=Farrakhan Responds to Media Attacks |accessdate=October 2, 2014 |date=May 15, 2000 |work=[[The Final Call]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

No consensus has been reached on who was responsible for the assassination.&lt;ref&gt;Natambu, pp.{{nbsp}}315–316.&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2014, an online petition was started using the [[We the People (petitioning system)|White House online petition mechanism]] to call on the government to release without alteration any files they still held relating to the murder of Malcolm X.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/editorials/2015/01/09/release-government-files-malcolm-assassination/q5NgGT963h83acy481vv5K/story.html |title=Release Government Files on Malcolm X Assassination |work=The Boston Globe |date=January 10, 2015 |accessdate=November 11, 2017 |subscription=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophy ==
Except for his autobiography, Malcolm{{nbsp}}X left no published writings. His philosophy is known almost entirely from the many speeches and interviews he gave from 1952 until his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Kelley |first=Robin D. G. |authorlink=Robin D.G.

While he was a member of the Nation of Islam, Malcolm{{nbsp}}X taught its beliefs, and his statements often began with the phrase "The Honorable Elijah Muhammad teaches us that..."&lt;ref name=Lomax80-81&gt;Lomax, ''When the Word Is Given'', pp.{{nbsp}}80–81.&lt;/ref&gt; It is virtually impossible now to discern whether Malcolm{{nbsp}}X's personal beliefs at the time diverged from the teachings of the Nation of Islam.&lt;ref&gt;Terrill, p.{{nbsp}}184.&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn-ua|"'I'll be honest with you,' Malcolm{{nbsp}}X said to me. 'Everybody is talking about differences between the Messenger and me. It is absolutely impossible for us to differ.{{'"}}&lt;ref&gt;Lomax, ''When the Word Is Given'', p.{{nbsp}}91.&lt;/ref&gt; }} After he left the Nation in 1964, he compared himself to a ventriloquist's dummy who could only say what Elijah Muhammad told him to say.&lt;ref name=Lomax80-81 /&gt;{{efn-ua|On a radio program in December 1964, Malcolm{{nbsp}}X said "all of my former statements were prefaced by 'the Honorable Elijah Muhammad teaches thus and so.' They weren't my statements, they were his statements, and I was repeating them."&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm{{nbsp}}X, ''Last Speeches'', p.{{nbsp}}104.&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Malcolm{{nbsp}}X taught that black people were the original people of the world,&lt;ref name=Lomax55 /&gt; and that white people were a race of devils who were created by an evil scientist named [[Yakub (Nation of Islam)|Yakub]].&lt;ref name=Perry115 /&gt; The Nation of Islam believed that black people were superior to white people and that the demise of the white race was imminent.&lt;ref name=Lomax57 /&gt; When questioned concerning his statements that white people were devils, Malcolm{{nbsp}}X said: "history proves the white man is a devil."&lt;ref&gt;Lomax, ''When the Word Is Given'', p.{{nbsp}}67.&lt;/ref&gt; "Anybody who rapes, and plunders, and enslaves, and steals, and drops hell bombs on people&amp;nbsp;... anybody who does these things is nothing but a devil."&lt;ref&gt;Lomax, ''When the Word Is Given'', p.{{nbsp}}171.&lt;/ref&gt;

Malcolm{{nbsp}}X said that Islam was the "true religion of black mankind" and that Christianity was "the white man's religion" that had been imposed upon African Americans by their slave-masters.&lt;ref&gt;Lomax, ''When the Word Is Given'', pp.{{nbsp}}24, 137–138.&lt;/ref&gt; He said that the Nation of Islam followed Islam as it was practiced around the world, but the Nation's teachings varied from those of other Muslims because they were adapted to the "uniquely pitiful" condition of black people in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm{{nbsp}}X, ''Speeches at Harvard'', p.{{nbsp}}119.&lt;/ref&gt; He taught that [[Wallace Fard Muhammad]], the founder of the Nation, was God incarnate,&lt;ref&gt;DeCaro, pp.{{nbsp}}166–167.&lt;/ref&gt; and that Elijah Muhammad was his Messenger, or [[Prophet]].{{efn-ua|Malcolm{{nbsp}}X told Lewis Lomax that "The Messenger is the Prophet of Allah."&lt;ref&gt;Lomax, ''When the Word Is Given'', p.{{nbsp}}80.&lt;/ref&gt; On another occasion, he said, "We never refer to the Honorable Elijah Muhammad as a prophet."&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm{{nbsp}}X, ''Last Speeches'', p.{{nbsp}}46.&lt;/ref&gt; }}

While the [[civil rights movement]] fought against [[Racial segregation in the United States|racial segregation]], Malcolm{{nbsp}}X advocated the complete [[Black separatism|separation]] of blacks from whites. The Nation of Islam proposed the establishment of a separate country for African Americans in the southern&lt;ref name=Lomax149-152 /&gt; or southwestern United States&lt;ref&gt;Lincoln, p.{{nbsp}}95.&lt;/ref&gt; as an interim measure until African Americans could return to Africa.&lt;ref name=Supremacy78 /&gt; Malcolm{{nbsp}}X suggested the United States government owed [[Reparations for slavery|reparations]] to black people for the unpaid labor of their [[Slavery in the United States|ancestors]].&lt;ref&gt;Lincoln, p.{{nbsp}}96.&lt;/ref&gt; He also rejected the civil rights movement's strategy of [[nonviolence]], advocating instead that black people should defend themselves.&lt;ref name="Lomax 173-174" /&gt;

{{quote box|width=23em|The common goal of 22 million Afro-Americans is respect as ''human beings''.... We can never get civil rights in America until our ''human rights'' are first restored. We will never be recognized as citizens there until we are first recognized as ''humans''...

Just as the violation of ''human rights'' of our brothers and sisters in South Africa and Angola is an international issue and has brought the racists of South Africa and Portugal under attack from all other independent governments at the United Nations, once the miserable plight of the 22 million Afro-Americans is also lifted to the level of ''human rights'' our struggle then becomes an international issue, and the direct concern of all other civilized governments. We can then take the racist American Government before the World Court and have the racists in it exposed and condemned as the criminals that they are.|salign=right|source=—Malcolm{{nbsp}}X&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm{{nbsp}}X, "The Negro's Fight", ''[[The Egyptian Gazette]]'', August 25, 1964. Reprinted as "Racism: The Canver That Is Destroying America" in Clarke, pp.{{nbsp}}302–306.&lt;/ref&gt; }}

After leaving the Nation of Islam, Malcolm{{nbsp}}X announced his willingness to work with leaders of the civil rights movement,&lt;ref name=Times64-03-09 /&gt; though he advocated some changes to their policies. He felt that calling the movement a struggle for ''civil rights'' would keep the issue within the United States while changing the focus to ''human rights'' would make it an international concern. The movement could then bring its complaints before the United Nations, where Malcolm{{nbsp}}X said the emerging nations of the world would add their support.&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm{{nbsp}}X, ''Malcolm{{nbsp}}X Speaks'', pp.{{nbsp}}33–35.&lt;/ref&gt;

Malcolm{{nbsp}}X argued that if the U.S. government was unwilling or unable to protect black people, black people should protect themselves. He said that he and the other members of the OAAU were determined to defend themselves from aggressors, and to secure freedom, justice and equality "by whatever means necessary".&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm{{nbsp}}X, ''By Any Means Necessary'', pp.{{nbsp}}43, 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Malcolm X NYWTS.jpg|left|upright=0.75|thumb|Malcolm X at a 1964 press conference|alt=Malcolm X is surrounded by reporters with microphones, while a television camera captures the scene]]

Malcolm{{nbsp}}X stressed the global perspective he gained from his international travels. He emphasized the "direct connection" between the domestic struggle of African Americans for equal rights with the independence struggles of [[Third World]] nations.&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm{{nbsp}}X, ''Malcolm{{nbsp}}X Speaks'', p.{{nbsp}}90.&lt;/ref&gt; He said that African Americans were wrong when they thought of themselves as a minority; globally, black people were the majority.&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm{{nbsp}}X, ''Malcolm{{nbsp}}X Speaks'', p.{{nbsp}}117.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his speeches at the Militant Labor Forum, which was sponsored by the [[Socialist Workers Party (United States)|Socialist Workers Party]], Malcolm{{nbsp}}X criticized capitalism.&lt;ref name=Perry277-278 /&gt; After one such speech, when he was asked what political and economic system he wanted, he said he did not know, but that it was no coincidence the newly independent countries in the Third World were turning toward [[socialism]].&lt;ref name=Cone284&gt;Cone, p.{{nbsp}}284.&lt;/ref&gt; When a reporter asked him what he thought about socialism, Malcolm{{nbsp}}X asked whether it was good for black people. When the reporter told him it seemed to be, Malcolm{{nbsp}}X told him, "Then I'm for it."&lt;ref name=Cone284 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Perry, p.{{nbsp}}277.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although he no longer called for the separation of black people from white people, Malcolm{{nbsp}}X continued to advocate black nationalism, which he defined as self-determination for the African-American community.&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm{{nbsp}}X, ''Malcolm{{nbsp}}X Speaks'', pp.{{nbsp}}38–41.&lt;/ref&gt; In the last months of his life, however, Malcolm{{nbsp}}X began to reconsider his support for black nationalism after meeting northern African revolutionaries who, to all appearances, were white.&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm{{nbsp}}X, ''Malcolm{{nbsp}}X Speaks'', pp.{{nbsp}}212–213.&lt;/ref&gt;

After his Hajj, Malcolm{{nbsp}}X articulated a view of white people and racism that represented a deep change from the philosophy he had supported as a minister of the Nation of Islam. In a famous letter from Mecca, he wrote that his experiences with white people during his pilgrimage convinced him to "rearrange" his thinking about race and "toss aside some of [his] previous conclusions".&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm{{nbsp}}X, ''Autobiography'', p.{{nbsp}}391.&lt;/ref&gt; In a conversation with [[Gordon Parks]], two days before his assassination, Malcolm said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[L]istening to leaders like [[Gamal Abdel Nasser|Nasser]], [[Ahmed Ben Bella|Ben Bella]], and [[Kwame Nkrumah|Nkrumah]] awakened me to the dangers of racism. I realized racism isn't just a black and white problem. It's brought bloodbaths to about every nation on earth at one time or another.

Brother, remember the time that white college girl came into the restaurant{{mdashb}}the one who wanted to help the [Black] Muslims and the whites get together{{mdashb}}and I told her there wasn't a ghost of a chance and she went away crying? Well, I've lived to regret that incident. In many parts of the African continent I saw white students helping black people. Something like this kills a lot of argument. I did many things as a [Black] Muslim that I'm sorry for now. I was a zombie then{{mdashb}}like all [Black] Muslims{{mdashb}}I was hypnotized, pointed in a certain direction and told to march. Well, I guess a man's entitled to make a fool of himself if he's ready to pay the cost. It cost me 12 years.

That was a bad scene, brother. The sickness and madness of those days{{mdashb}}I'm glad to be free of them.&lt;ref name=Parks&gt;Parks, Gordon, "Malcolm{{nbsp}}X: The Minutes of Our Last Meeting", Clarke, p.{{nbsp}}122.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the late 1960s, increasingly radical black activists based their movements largely on Malcolm{{nbsp}}X and his teachings. The [[Black Power]] movement,&lt;ref name="Marable301" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sales, p.{{nbsp}}187.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Black Arts Movement]],&lt;ref name=Marable301 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Woodard |first=Komozi |title=A Nation Within a Nation: Amiri Baraka (LeRoi Jones) &amp; Black Power Politics |year=1999 |publisher=University of North Carolina Press |location=Chapel Hill, N.C. |isbn=978-0-8078-4761-9 |page=62 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the widespread adoption of the slogan "[[Black is beautiful]]"&lt;ref&gt;Cone, p.{{nbsp}}291.&lt;/ref&gt; can all trace their roots to Malcolm{{nbsp}}X.

In 1963 Malcolm{{nbsp}}X began a collaboration with [[Alex Haley]] on his life story, ''[[The Autobiography of Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X]]''.&lt;ref name=Perry214&gt;Perry, p.{{nbsp}}214.&lt;/ref&gt; He told Haley, "If I'm alive when this book comes out, it will be a miracle."&lt;ref&gt;Haley, "Epilogue", ''Autobiography'', p.{{nbsp}}471.&lt;/ref&gt; Haley completed and published it some months after the assassination.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, p.{{nbsp}}375.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the late 1980s and early 1990s, there was a resurgence of interest in his life among young people. [[Hip hop music|Hip-hop]] groups such as [[Public Enemy (band)|Public Enemy]] adopted Malcolm{{nbsp}}X as an icon,&lt;ref&gt;Sales, p.{{nbsp}}5.&lt;/ref&gt; and his image was displayed in hundreds of thousands of homes, offices, and schools,&lt;ref&gt;Marable, "Rediscovering Malcolm's Life", pp.{{nbsp}}301–302.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as on T-shirts and jackets.&lt;ref&gt;Sales, p.{{nbsp}}3.&lt;/ref&gt; This wave peaked in 1992 with the release of the film ''[[Malcolm X (1992 film)|Malcolm{{nbsp}}X]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Sales, p.{{nbsp}}4.&lt;/ref&gt; an adaptation of ''The Autobiography of Malcolm&amp;nbsp;X''.

In 1998 ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' named ''The Autobiography of Malcolm{{nbsp}}X'' one of the ten most influential nonfiction books of the 20th century.&lt;ref name=time1&gt;{{cite news |url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,988496,00.html |title=Required Reading: Nonfiction Books |last=Gray |first=Paul |date=June 8, 1998 |work=Time  |accessdate=March 28, 2016 |subscription=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- Yes, the title of Paul Gray's article is "Required Reading", not "Ten Most Influential Nonfiction Books of the 20th Century".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6038">'''Microbial symbiosis in marine animals''' was not discovered until 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cavanaugh|first1=Colleen|title=Microbial Symbiosis: Patterns of Diversity in the Marine Environment|journal=Integr Comp Biol Integrative and Comparative Biology|date=1994|volume=34|issue=1|pages=79–89|url=http://icb.oxfordjournals.org/content/34/1/79.full.pdf+html|accessdate=May 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the time following, [[symbiotic]] relationships between [[marine invertebrates]] and [[chemoautotrophic]] bacteria have been found in a variety of ecosystems, ranging from shallow coastal waters to deep-sea [[hydrothermal vent]]s. The type of marine animal vary greatly, for example, sponges, sea squirts, corals, worms, and algae all host a variety of unique symbionts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Li|first1=Zhiyong|title=Advances in Marine Microbial Symbionts in the China Sea and Related Pharmaceutical Metabolites|journal=Marine Drugs|date=2009|volume=7|issue=2|pages=113–129|url=http://www.mdpi.com/1660-3397/7/2/113/htm|accessdate=1 June 2015|doi=10.3390/md7020113|pmid=19597576|pmc=2707038}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each symbiotic relationship displays a unique ecological niche, which in turn can lead to entirely new species of host species and symbiont.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cavanaugh|first1=Colleen|title=Microbial Symbiosis: Patterns of Diversity in the Marine Environment|journal=Integr Comp Biol Integrative and Comparative Biology|date=1994|volume=34|issue=1|pages=79–89|url=http://icb.oxfordjournals.org/content/34/1/79.full.pdf+html|accessdate=1 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is particularly interesting that it took so long to discover the marine microbial symbiosis because nearly every surface submerged in the oceans becomes covered with [[biofilm]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Armstrong|first1=Evelyn|last2=Yan|first2=Liming|last3=Boyd|first3=Kenneth|last4=Phillip|first4=Wright|last5=Burgess|first5=J|title=The symbiotic role of marine microbes on living surfaces|journal=Hydrobiologia|date=2001|volume=461|issue=1–3|pages=37–40|doi=10.1023/A:1012756913566}}&lt;/ref&gt; including a large number of living organisms. Many marine organisms display symbiotic relationships with microbes. [[Epibiotic]] bacteria have been found to live on crustacean larvae and protect them from fungal infections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Armstrong|first1=Evelyn|last2=Yan|first2=Liming|last3=Boyd|first3=Kenneth|last4=Phillip|first4=Wright|last5=Burgess|first5=J|title=The symbiotic role of marine microbes on living surfaces|journal=Hydrobiologia|date=2001|volume=461|issue=1–3|pages=37–40|doi=10.1023/A:1012756913566}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other microbes in deep-sea vents have been found to prevent the settlement of barnacles and tunicate larvae.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Armstrong|first1=Evelyn|last2=Yan|first2=Liming|last3=Boyd|first3=Kenneth|last4=Phillip|first4=Wright|last5=Burgess|first5=J|title=The symbiotic role of marine microbes on living surfaces|journal=Hydrobiologia|date=2001|volume=461|issue=1–3|pages=37–40|doi=10.1023/A:1012756913566}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most notable display of marine symbiotic relationship would be coral. Coral reefs are home to a variety of [[dinoflagellate]] symbiont,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baker|first1=Andrew|title=Flexibility and Specificity in Coral-Algal Symbiosis: Diversity, Ecology, and Biogeography of Symbiodinium|journal=Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics|date=200|volume=34|pages=661–689|jstor=30033790|doi=10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.34.011802.132417}}&lt;/ref&gt; these symbionts give coral its bright coloring and are vital for the survival of the reef. The symbionts provide the coral with food in exchange for protection. If the waters warm or become too acidic, the symbionts are expelled, the [[Coral bleaching|coral bleaches]] and if conditions persist the coral will die. This in turn leads to the collapse of the entire reef ecosystem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Baker|first1=Andrew|title=Flexibility and Specificity in Coral-Algal Symbiosis: Diversity, Ecology, and Biogeography of Symbiodinium|journal=Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics|date=200|volume=34|pages=661–689|jstor=30033790|doi=10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.34.011802.132417}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Microbial biotechnology ==
Marine invertebrates are the hosts of a wide spectrum of bioactive metabolites, which have vast potential as drugs and research tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Haygood|first1=Margo|last2=Schmidt|first2=Eric|last3=Davidson|first3=Seana|last4=Faulkner|first4=John|title=Microbial Symbionts of Marine Invertebrates: Opportunities for Microbial Biotechnology|journal=J.

'''Moustache''', sometimes abbreviated to '''Mous''', (September 1799 &amp;ndash; 11 March 1812)&lt;ref group=nb name="death"/&gt;  was a [[France|French]] [[poodle]] who is reputed to have played a part in the [[French Revolutionary Wars|French Revolutionary]] and [[Napoleonic Wars]]. His story is recounted in many publications but may be partly  [[fiction]]alised.  Moustache is said to have been born in [[Falaise, Calvados|Falaise]], [[Normandy]], [[France]] in 1799 and to have joined a [[grenadier]] regiment at [[Caen]].  He followed the regiment through the [[Italian campaigns of the French Revolutionary Wars|Italian Campaign]] of the Revolutionary Wars and is said to have alerted the regiment to a surprise night attack by [[Austria]]n forces.  He is reported to have been present at the [[Battle of Marengo]], during which he lost an ear, and with a [[cuirassier]] regiment at the [[Battle of Austerlitz]].

At Austerlitz Moustache was apparently responsible for the discovery of an Austrian spy, and the recovery of the regiment's standard from the Austrians.  As a result of wounds taken at Austerlitz Moustache had a leg amputated and was reportedly rewarded with a medal by [[Marshal of France|Marshal]] [[Jean Lannes]].  He is later said to have followed a unit of [[dragoon]]s to [[Spain]] where he fought in several actions of the [[Peninsular War]].  Seeing action in the [[Sierra Morena]] and later, with a gunboat unit, at the [[Siege of Badajoz (1812)|Battle of Badajoz]], where he was killed by a cannonball.  Moustache was interred beneath a gravestone on the battlefield but his memorial is said to have been smashed and his bones burned after the war.

==Historical sources==
One of the earliest written accounts of Moustache's life is that written by Arna Cano and published in ''[[The Kaleidoscope]]'' magazine of [[Liverpool]] in January 1826.  This, published twenty years after the dog's death, may be [[fiction|partially fictionalised]].  A similar story is recounted in a detailed French-language account written by Alain de Fivas and published in 1864.  Moustache is mentioned in at least eleven English, French and German publications.{{#tag:ref|These works include those listed in the references and further reading.&lt;ref name="PHP"/&gt;|group=nb}}  The story presented here is drawn largely from the Cano and de Fivas accounts and notes any disagreement with the other accounts.

==Early life==
Moustache, a black [[poodle]], was born in [[Falaise, Calvados|Falaise]] in [[Normandy]], [[France]] in approximately September 1799.&lt;ref name="fivas169"&gt;{{Harvnb|de Fivas|1864|p=169}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cano234"&gt;{{Harvnb|Cano|1826|p=234}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  At the age of six months Cano states that he was sent to [[Caen]] to live with a [[grocer]] and whilst there encountered a group of [[grenadier]]s on parade.&lt;ref name="cano234"/&gt;  He goes on to say that Moustache followed behind the regiment, which had no other dogs, as it left the town and, on the approval of the [[drum major]], was allowed to accompany the unit on campaign.&lt;ref name="cano234"/&gt;  The regiment was headed to [[Italy]] as part of the [[Italian campaigns of the French Revolutionary Wars|Italian Campaign]] fought by France against [[Austria]] during the [[French Revolutionary Wars]].

Though Moustache was not a trained military dog, he apparently took to military life well, comfortably crossing the [[Great St Bernard Pass]] through the [[Alps]] with [[First Consul]] [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]'s army in spring 1800.&lt;ref name="fivas170"&gt;{{Harvnb|de Fivas|1864|p=170}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is during this stage that one of Moustache's most famous actions is reputed to have taken place.  Whilst the regiment was encamped near [[Belbo]] the Austrians are said to have mounted a surprise night attack on the camp in stormy weather conditions.&lt;ref name="cano234"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fivas170"/&gt;  It is claimed that Moustache noticed the approaching Austrian troops and barked to alert the grenadiers, who stood to, and repulsed the attack.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news|title=The Use of Dogs in War|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1889/04/07/106344614.pdf|newspaper=The New York Times|accessdate=14 August 2010 | date=7 April 1889}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other sources place this event as occurring in [[Alexandria]], [[Egypt]] during the [[French Campaign in Egypt and Syria|Egyptian campaign]] against the [[Ottoman Empire]].&lt;ref name="brimmer256"&gt;{{Harvnb|Brimmer|1937|p=256}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  This variant may have been inspired by Napoleon's letter to General [[Auguste de Marmont]] just prior to the 1799 [[Battle of Abukir (1799)|Battle of Abukir]] when Marmont was in Alexandria.  It urged Marmont to provide an attack warning system by securing "a large quantity of dogs which can be made use of by posting them in front of your fortifications".&lt;ref name="brimmer256"/&gt;  After this event, the Colonel of the grenadier regiment is said to have formally placed Moustache on the roll as a grenadier and gave him a collar bearing the regiment's name.&lt;ref name="fivas170"/&gt;  Additionally, he ordered that Moustache receive the [[field ration]]s entitled to a grenadier and that he be combed by the unit's barber once per week.

==Austrian campaigns==
===Battle of Marengo===
Both Cano and de Fivas say that whilst en route to [[Spinetta Marengo]] Moustache took part in a small engagement between a company of his regiment and some Austrians.  He was standing at the front of the company when he received a [[bayonet]] wound to his left shoulder.&lt;ref name="cano234"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fivas170"/&gt;  Moustache spent several days recovering in the hospital of the regimental surgeon.&lt;ref name="fivas171"&gt;{{Harvnb|de Fivas|1864|p=171}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Though he was not fully recovered from the wound, still having a limp, Moustache is said to have taken to the field with the regiment on 14 June 1800 at the [[Battle of Marengo]].&lt;ref name="fivas171"/&gt;  During the battle he persistently barked at the Austrian forces and was only dissuaded from attacking them by their fixed bayonets.&lt;ref name="cano234"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fivas171"/&gt;

Moustache did engage in close combat with one opponent - a [[Pointing breed|pointer]] owned by an Austrian corporal that approached the French lines.&lt;ref name="cano234"/&gt;  De Fivas says that Moustache quickly pounced on the larger, stronger dog and fought with him for some time before a musket shot killed the pointer.&lt;ref name="fivas171"/&gt;  Cano states that Moustache was also wounded by the shot, losing an ear.&lt;ref name="cano234"/&gt;  Moustache deserted the grenadiers shortly after the French victory at Marengo, apparently because one of them attempted to chain him to a [[Guardhouse|sentry box]], and instead joined a company of mounted [[cuirassier]]s.&lt;ref name="cano234"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fivas171"/&gt;

===Battle of Austerlitz===
According to de Fivas, Moustache was responsible for the discovery of an Austrian spy in the French camp just prior to the [[Battle of Austerlitz]].  The dog is alleged to have leapt to his feet and barked at the Austrian to alert French soldiers.&lt;ref name="fivas171"/&gt;  Some sources state that this event occurred around the time of the earlier battles of Marengo or Abukir.&lt;ref name="PHP"&gt;{{cite web|title=Army dogs|url=http://www.poodlehistory.org/PARMY.HTM|publisher=Poodle History Project|accessdate=14 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moustache's greatest achievement is said to have taken place at Austerlitz.  De Fivas states that Moustache went into battle with the cuirassiers and was present when the regimental [[standard bearer]] was surrounded by Austrian soldiers.&lt;ref name="fivas172"&gt;{{Harvnb|de Fivas|1864|p=172}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The standard bearer apparently killed three Austrians before he was himself cut down, wrapping the flag around him as he fell to prevent its capture.&lt;ref name="fivas172"/&gt;  It is at this point that de Fivas alleges that Moustache confronted the five or six remaining Austrians and was about to be bayoneted when the group was hit by a blast of artillery [[grapeshot]].&lt;ref name="fivas172"/&gt;  Moustache, wounded in the leg, is reputed to have torn the flag off the body of the standard bearer and returned it to the French camp.&lt;ref name="fivas172"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mustache, the Military Poodle|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1888/12/02/103186427.pdf|accessdate=23 October 2010|newspaper=The New York Times|date=2 December 1888}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recognition of this action  [[Marshal of France|Marshal]] [[Jean Lannes]] is reported to have ordered that Moustache's old collar be replaced with a copper medal on a piece of red ribbon.&lt;ref name="fivas172"/&gt;  De Fivas states that this medal was engraved with the words "II perdit une jambe à la bataille d'Austerlitz, et sauva le drapeau de son régiment" on the front, and "Moustache, chien français : qu'il soit partout respecté et chéri comme un brave" on the reverse,&lt;ref name="fivas172"/&gt; which translates to "He lost a leg at the Battle of Austerlitz and saved the regimental flag" and "Moustache, A French dog: Everywhere respected and cherished as a hero" respectively.  At least one other source says instead that the medal was silver and had a [[Flag of France|tricolore]] collar.&lt;ref name="PHP"/&gt;

Moustache later had to have his wounded leg amputated.&lt;ref name="fivas172"/&gt;  Other rewards he is said to have received for this event include an order being issued that whichever regiment he presented himself at would have to feed him the rations of a serving soldier and that he was placed on the regimental books and was to receive the pay and rations of a soldier.&lt;ref name="PHP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fivas172"/&gt;  A further legend says that Moustache was presented to Napoleon himself and demonstrated to have performed a trick whereby he would cock his leg whenever France's enemies were mentioned.&lt;ref name="PHP"/&gt;

===Battle of Essling===
At the [[Battle of Essling]], Moustache was supposed to have found a mate. Upon joining the front lines, a fellow Poodle was spotted amongst the enemy. During the course of the battle, the two met and the female Poodle accompanied Moustache back to the French camp. This relationship lasted about a year and together the pair produced puppies which were looked after by the women of the camp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Tales of the Wars; or, Naval and Military Chronicle|volume=1|year=1836|publisher=William Mark Clark|page=110|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Zb8BAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA110&amp;dq=Moustache+french+poodle+army#v=onepage&amp;q=Moustache%20french%20poodle%20army&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spanish campaign==
Moustache is said to have left the cuirassiers after he was struck by a cavalryman with the flat of his sword.&lt;ref name="fivas173"&gt;{{Harvnb|de Fivas|1864|p=173}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  De Fivas says that he attached himself to a unit of [[dragoon]]s which he followed to [[Spain]], taking part in two campaigns with them during which he would walk ahead of their column and bark warnings whenever he heard a noise.&lt;ref name="fivas173"/&gt;  During a battle in the [[Sierra Morena]] mountain range in southern Spain Moustache is alleged to have led back to camp the horses of dragoons killed on the battlefield.&lt;ref name="fivas173"/&gt;  Shortly after this he is said to have been secretly taken by a Colonel who wished to own him.  After spending seventeen days in captivity the dog apparently escaped by an open window and joined with a gunboat crew.&lt;ref name="fivas173"/&gt;  Afterwards he participated in the [[Battle of Badajoz (1812)|Battle of Badajoz]] where he was struck by a cannonball and killed on 11 March 1812, at the age of twelve years.{{#tag:ref|The 1811 date given in Cano and de Fivas is presumably an error as the Siege of Badajoz took place in March–April 1812 and Moustache would only be 11 years old in 1811.|name="death"|group=nb}}

Moustache was reputedly buried on the battlefield alongside his medal and ribbon with a [[gravestone]] engraved with the words "Ici repose le brave Moustache" ("Here lies the brave Moustache").&lt;ref name="fivas173"/&gt;  Though he was wounded many times in his life it is said that all of his wounds were to his front.&lt;ref name="fivas170"/&gt;  After the allied victory over the French in the [[Peninsular War]], it is alleged that the Spanish destroyed his gravestone and the [[Spanish Inquisition|Inquisition]] ordered his bones to be dug up and burned.&lt;ref name="fivas173"/&gt;

'''Nora Isabella Samuelli''' (July 9, 1914 – December 1986) was a [[Romanians|Romanian]] spy for the United States while employed at its Legation in [[Bucharest]] during the [[Cold War]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc86515/m1/1453|title=S. 618 (89th)|accessdate=August 22, 2013|author=89th Congress (1965)|date=November 7, 1965|work=Legislation|publisher=digital.library.unt.edu|quote=A bill for the relief of Nora Isabella Samuelli.}}&lt;/ref&gt; – authorizes Private Bill 89-203, under which Samuelli will be held and considered to have been lawfully admitted for permanent residence to the United States as of July 31, 1963, upon payment of the required visa fee.

==Background==
In 1949, Nora Samuelli and her sister, Annie, were arrested as spies in [[Bucharest]] by the then Communist government. After "nine months of torture and interrogation, the two sisters were sentenced to long prison terms. Then in 1961, after 11 years and 340 days (July 24, 1949 – June 14, 1961) in separate security prisons and cells, the two were quietly ransomed out by a relative in the United States, and exiled as stateless refugees. While Annie was granted British citizenship within only a few months, it took three years, two presidents and the passage of Bills on her behalf in the US Congress for Nora to receive the same privilege in America."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tkinter.smig.net/romania/References/WomanBehindBars/index.htm Profile of Annie Samuelli, Nora's sister (excerpt from ''WOMAN BEHIND BARS IN ROMANIA''. Frank Cass: London, 1997] {{ISBN|0-7146-4217-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two Private Bills of 1965 which benefited Nora Samuelli were:
* a) 89-203, which granted her permanent residency under the Immigration and Nationality Act (passed Congress on November 7, 1965).{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}
* b) [https://digital.library.unt.edu/ark:/67531/metadc86515/m1/1414 89-108], which awarded her $38,114.90 (USD) compensation under as "a gratuity for sacrifices sustained by her [Samuelli]" (i.e. 12 years imprisonment; see above) and eligible to be covered under the Civil Service Retirement Act (passed on September 29, 1965). {{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

==Death==
Nora Samuelli died in December 1986 in [[Washington, D.C.]], aged 72. &lt;!-- cause?? --&gt;{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

'''Hermogenes''', or '''Germogen''' ({{lang-ru|Гермоге́н}}) (secular name '''Yermolay''') (before 1530 – February 17, 1612) was the [[List of Metropolitans and Patriarchs of Moscow|Patriarch of Moscow and all Russia]] from 1606. It was he who inspired the popular uprising that put an end to the [[Time of Troubles]]. Hermogenes was glorified by the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] in 1913. [[File:Hermogenes.jpg|thumb|250px|''Patriarch Hermogenes refusing to bless the Poles'' painting by [[Pavel Chistyakov]] (1860).]]

At the [[Holy Synod]] of 1589, which established the patriarchy in [[Moscow]], Hermogenes was appointed [[Metropolitan bishop|Metropolitan]] of the newly conquered city of [[Kazan]]. During the following two decades, he gained renown for a number of Muslim [[Volga Tatars]] converted to [[Eastern Orthodoxy]].

In 1606, Hermogenes was summoned by [[False Dmitry I]] to take part in the [[Governing Senate|Senate]] recently instituted in [[Moscow]]. There he learnt about the tsar's design to marry a [[Roman Catholic]] woman, [[Marina Mniszech]], and firmly declared against such an alliance. At that he was exiled from the capital, only to return with great honours several months later, when the false tsar had been deposed, and [[Ignatius of Moscow|Patriarch Ignatius]] followed suit.
[[File:1000 Germogen.jpg|left|175px|thumb|Hermogenes at the [[Millennium of Russia|Millennium Monument]] in [[Novgorod]]]]
==Patriarch of Moscow==
The new tsar, [[Vasily IV]], helped Hermogenes to become [[Patriarch of Moscow and all the Rus']]: Metropolitan Hermogenes was elected to the primatial See, and on July 3, 1606 he was installed as Patriarch by the assembly of the holy hierarchs at [[Dormition Cathedral, Moscow|Moscow's Dormition cathedral]]. Metropolitan Isidore handed the Patriarch the staff of the holy hierarch Peter, and the Tsar gave as a gift to the new Patriarch a [[panagia]], embellished with precious stones, a white klobuk and staff. In the ancient manner, Patriarch Hermogenes made his entrance riding upon a [[donkey]]. During Vasily's reign, Hermogenes generally supported the tsar's efforts to pacify the country and anathemized [[Ivan Bolotnikov]] and his army. 
===Time of Troubles===
{{see|Time of Troubles}}
When Vasily was dethroned and the Poles took hold of the [[Moscow Kremlin]], Hermogenes staunchly opposed their plans to put [[Wladyslaw IV]] on the Russian throne, unless he converted to Orthodoxy. Despite knife threats from some of the boyars, he refused to sign any petitions to the Polish king, thus preventing Wladyslaw from coronation.&lt;ref&gt;Maureen Perrie. ''Pretenders and Popular Monarchism in Early Modern Russia''. Cambridge University Press, 1995. {{ISBN|0-521-47274-1}}. Page 210.&lt;br&gt;Robert Auty, Dimitri Obolensky. ''Companion to Russian Studies''. Cambridge University Press, 1981. {{ISBN|0-521-28038-9}}. Page 108.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1610 Hermogenes distributed letters to various Russian towns, urging the populace to rise against the Poles. When the volunteer army under [[Prokopy Lyapunov]] finally approached Moscow, he defied the Polish exhortations to anathemize the army. Despite being threatened with death penalty, he cursed the [[Roman Catholics]] and showed support for Lyapunov. After that, he was arrested and thrown into the [[Chudov Monastery]]. There he heard about the new volunteer army, mustered by [[Kuzma Minin]] and commanded by [[Prince Pozharsky]], and blessed them both. Thereupon the patriarch was beaten and starved to death.&lt;ref&gt;Reverend R Thornton. ''Lives of Eminent Russian Prelates''. Kessinger Publishing, 2004. {{ISBN|1-4179-4649-0}}. Page 3.&lt;br&gt;"He endured to the end and was accounted worthy of the crown of martyrdom: inflexible alike to prayers and threats, he was starved to death in prison, to be a pledge of deliverance to his country". -- A N Mouravieff. ''A History of the Church of Russia'', 1842, reprinted 2004. {{ISBN|1-4179-1250-2}}. Page 166.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and legacy==
The body of Hermogenes was buried in the Chudov monastery, but in 1654 was transferred to the Moscow Dormition cathedral. The purported relics of Patriarch Germogen were accidentally found in one of the [[crypt]]s of the [[Chudov Monastery]] during the 1913 repair works. In connection with the [[Romanov]] Dynasty Tercentenary, celebrated that same year, he was [[Russian Orthodox Church#Canonization|canonized]] as a [[hieromartyr]] and transferred to the nearby [[Dormition Cathedral, Moscow|Dormition Cathedral]].

The Russian Orthodox Church commemorates him on February 17, the day of his death, and May 12, the day of his recognized glorification.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ocafs.oca.org/FeastSaintsViewer.asp?FSID=101358 Orthodox Church in America]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{gr icon}} ''[http://www.synaxarion.gr/gr/sid/3132/sxsaintinfo.aspx Ὁ Ἅγιος Ἑρμογένης ὁ Ἱερομάρτυρας Πατριάρχης Μόσχας].'' 12 Μαΐου.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1520">'''Philip Augustus Knaut''' (1716 &amp;ndash; December 28, 1781) was a [[Germany|German]]-born merchant and political figure in [[Nova Scotia]]. He was a member of the [[Nova Scotia House of Assembly]] for Lunenburg from 1758 to 1781.

He was born in the [[Electorate of Saxony]] and first came to Nova Scotia with [[Edward Cornwallis]] in 1749. In 1750, he married Anna Grob. Knaut settled in [[Lunenburg, Nova Scotia|Lunenburg]] in 1753, where he became one of the first shopkeepers there. He was [[justice of the peace]], an officer in the militia and [[coroner]]; he also operated a [[sawmill]]. [[Benjamin Gerrish]] chose Knaut as his agent at Lunenburg for trading with the [[First Nations]] people. Knaut married Jane Brimner in 1781 after the death of his first wife. He died in office in Lunenburg. [[John Newton (Nova Scotia politician)|John Newton]], collector of impost and excise at Halifax, who had married Knaut's daughter Catherine, inherited control of Knaut's estate.

'''Pou''' is a [[digital pet|virtual pet]] game for [[BlackBerry 10]], [[iOS]] and [[Android (operating system)|Android]] developed and published by Paul Salameh (listed as Zakeh on the Google Play Store).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.digitaljournal.com/pr/1430883 |title=Report: Famous Mobile Apps Now Discussed in Chatwing 3.0 - Press Release |newspaper=Digital Journal |date=2013-08-24 |accessdate=2013-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.wamda.com/2013/05/the-24-year-old-lebanese-entrepreneur-behind-pou-top-mobile-kids-game |title=How a 24-year-old Lebanese entrepreneur found global success by beating Tamagotchi at their own game {{!}} Wamda.com |first=Nina |last=Curley |date=2013-05-16 |newspaper=Wamda.com |accessdate=2014-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; It features a rounded, triangular alien character whose default color is brown. In the game the character can be fed, cleaned, exercised, suited, and put to sleep. There are also mini games within the app and coins can be earned to purchase costumes, decorations, and modifications of the game environment by playing the mini game or by reaching the achievements. It is somewhat similar to [[Tamagotchi]], a fad game that required caring for a simulated creature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tecmundo.com.br/como-fazer/43363-como-instalar-e-jogar-o-pou-sucesso-do-android-no-computador.htm |title=Como instalar e jogar o Pou, sucesso do Android, no computador |trans-title=How to install and play the Pou, success of Android on your computer |newspaper=TecMundo |first=Caroline |last=Hecke |language=Portuguese|date=2013-08-16 |accessdate=2013-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also interact with other Pous by visiting them when the game is connected to the internet or play games with other Pous as opponent via selected mini games which as Pou-vs-Pou (PvP) capability the game connectivity is either [[Wi-Fi]], [[Bluetooth]], or even via [[Internet]]. It has user account in order to save and back-up the game progress state, in case the device is cleared. The last game progress can be resumed by logging in the user's account. The user can also transfer Pou from one device to another regardless of platform by logging out his/her account from the device and logging into other device; however the application version must be same between the two devices. In 2014, multilingual support was added.

With the success of the game, it has been copied using the name Mou on [[Windows Phone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://poudownload.com/download-pou-for-windows-phone/ |title=New Pou for Windows Phone called Mou! |website=Pou Download |date=2013-10-30 |accessdate=2013-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.windowsphone.com/es-es/store/app/mou/c032d62c-7f6a-4538-8150-f77034dcf335 |title=Mou - Windows Phone |website=Windows Phone (Spain) |language=Spanish |date=2013-10-30 |accessdate=2013-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Professor Emil Hamilton''' is a fictional comic book character appearing in books published by [[DC Comics]], usually as a supporting character in stories featuring [[Superman]].

==Publication history==
Created by writer [[Marv Wolfman]] and artist [[Jerry Ordway]], Professor Emil Hamilton first appeared in ''[[Adventures of Superman (comic book)|Adventures of Superman]]'' #424 (January 1987). His depictions in various incarnations range from that of a trusted ally to Superman and his colleagues to one who is cautious and mistrustful of Superman and his power, to an unambiguous villain. The character was named after [[Edmond Hamilton]], who wrote stories about Superman and other characters from the 1940s to the 1960s.

==Fictional character biography==
Emil Hamilton first appeared in ''[[Adventures of Superman (comic book)|Adventures of Superman]]'' #424 (January 1987), as an apparent villain, using his gadgets to attack Superman in an attempt to gain funding by proving that they worked. A former employee of [[S.T.A.R. Labs]] and the US Government, it transpired he had been driven insane when all his research was bought up by [[Lex Luthor]], who took credit for the inventions. He was placed in a mental health facility and responded well to treatment. On his release, he set up a laboratory in [[Suicide Slum]] and quickly became Superman's "scientific advisor", eking out a general living as a technical consultant. He was responsible for creating many devices that aided Superman, including the [[Phantom Zone]] Projector and early Superman Robots, as well as helping Superman during such problems as the 'Krisis of the Krimson Kryptonite', when red [[kryptonite]] created by [[Mister Mxyzptlk]] shut down Superman's powers; until Superman's powers were restored, Hamilton provided him with various machinery such as a force field belt and an armoured suit to allow him to continue as a hero. Later, another force field belt Emil provides allows Superman to get around the power-blocking talents of the artificial life forms 'Psi-Phon' and 'Dreadnaught'.&lt;ref&gt;''Adventures of Superman'' #442 (July 1988). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

Emil's first time turning evil is when the immortal 'Mister Z' brainwashes him into assisting in an attack on Superman.&lt;ref&gt;''Adventures of Superman'' #484 (November 1991). DC Comics&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, Superman is fighting the alien monster Doomsday. Working with [[Bibbo]], another ally of the Man of Steel, Emil sets up a powerful laser and scores a direct strike on the monster. It does little to stop it.&lt;ref&gt;''Superman: The Man of Steel'' #19 (January 1993). DC Comics&lt;/ref&gt; The two combatants seemingly fall dead and Emil creates a CPR unit for the hero. Bibbo is injured while using it and Hamilton takes over. Their efforts fail and Superman is declared dead.&lt;ref&gt;''Adventures of Superman'' #498 (January 1993). DC Comics&lt;/ref&gt; This failure causes feelings of intense guilt that not even Hamilton's long-term female friend Mildred Krantz can help him overcome.&lt;ref&gt;''Superman: The Man of Steel'' #20 (February 1993). DC Comics&lt;/ref&gt; After the hero's return, Emil helps in the investigation of a Superman 'corpse duplicate'.&lt;ref&gt;''Superman'' (vol. 2) #95 (December 1994). DC Comics&lt;/ref&gt; He lost an arm during the "Fall of Metropolis" storyline, but replaced it with a self-designed cybernetic [[prosthesis]].

He also provided [[Superboy (Kon-El)|Superboy]] with the visor that duplicated Superman's vision powers (x-ray and heat vision). This helps Superboy get a start on a heroic career in Hawaii. Hamilton would also enjoy time in that state as well.&lt;ref&gt;''Superboy'' (vol. 4) #1-3 (February–April 1994). DC Comics&lt;/ref&gt; He spends time with Superman, assisting him in restoring in [[Fortress of Solitude]] and saving the lives of the citizens of the Bottle City of [[Kandor (comics)|Kandor]].&lt;ref&gt;''Superman'' (vol. 2) #117 (November 1996). DC Comics&lt;/ref&gt;

===Villainy===
Many years later, when [[Steel (John Henry Irons)|John Henry Irons]] returned to [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]], just prior to the [[Brainiac 13|B13 Event]], Hamilton felt he was being sidelined, as Superman now had access to a scientific genius who was also a fellow superhero. He disappeared during the B13 Event when Metropolis was transformed into a future version of itself.

He eventually resurfaced as the '''Overmind''', the leader of a cyberpunk gang plotting the return of Brainiac 13. He claimed, however, that the B13-technology in his prosthetic arm was controlling his actions. Presumably this claim held some truth, as he later returned to his role as Superman's advisor using his innate understanding of the futuristic technology now available to him.

Hamilton, together with several other scientific geniuses and robotic beings ([[Automan (comics)|Automan]], [[Brainstorm (comics)|Brainstorm]], [[Doctor Cyber]], [[Ford (comics)|Ford]], and [[Demolition Team|Rosie the Riveter]]), was for a brief period part of the composite cybernetic being called [[Enginehead (comics)|Enginehead]]. However (if this story is still canon), the being seems to have been divided into the individual personalities again shortly after the events of the series.&lt;ref&gt;''Enginehead'' #1-6 (June–November 2004). DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2005 storyline it was revealed that Hamilton was, in fact, the villain named '''Ruin''', who had been targeting Superman's loved ones.&lt;ref&gt;''Adventures of Superman'' #636 (March 2005), DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; Ruin claimed to have discovered that Superman was sucking the sun dry of its solar energy, and that, in 4.5 billion years, it would mean the end of life on Earth. The identity of Ruin had been kept a mystery, until it seemed that Clark's friend, and former [[President of the United States]], [[Pete Ross]] was Ruin.&lt;ref&gt;''Adventures of Superman'' #640 (July 2005), DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; Pete Ross claimed innocence, but he became even more suspect when he escaped from custody. It turned out that it had been Hamilton who had framed Ross and kidnapped him again from prison. Hamilton then confronted and revealed himself to Superman, seemingly killing the 5th dimension imp [[Mister Mxyzptlk]] in the process when he tried to save Superman.&lt;ref&gt;''Adventures of Superman'' #646 (January 2006), DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; Superman defeated the insane Hamilton and saved Pete, [[Lana Lang]], and their child. Superman later cleared Ross' name and reputation, and Hamilton was apparently imprisoned.&lt;ref&gt;''Adventures of Superman'' #647 (February 2006), DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the events chronicled in the "[[Infinite Crisis]]" storyline, Ruin was one of many superhuman criminals who joined the villainous [[Secret Society of Super Villains|Society]] organized by [[Alexander Luthor Jr.]].

The pre-"[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]" version of Emil Hamilton appears during the 2015 "[[Convergence (comics)|Convergence]]" storyline. He has seemingly reformed, having made a home in the pre-"Flashpoint" [[Gotham City]] on the planet Telos, and repaired his friendship with [[Jimmy Olsen]]. Emil spent time rebuilding the Whiz Wagon, a flying, multi-purpose vehicle, as self-imposed reformation therapy.&lt;ref&gt;''Convergence: Superman'' #1 (April 2015), DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
Emil Hamilton is a normal human being and thus, has no inherent super powers, though he is a brilliant scientist and inventor, having designed and built devices such as a force-field generator. However, as Ruin he dons a "power suit." The suit allows Ruin to take advantage of his knowledge of Superman's weaknesses. Powerful blasts of Kryptonian red sunlight can be fired from the suit, which essentially sap Superman of all his powers. Also, Ruin is able to transport himself to the Phantom Zone (though at a detriment to his health), and reemerge anywhere, effectively allowing him to teleport. If the suit is forcibly removed from Hamilton's body, it self-destructs with a massive force, apparently enough to destroy a small city, although enough time elapsed between the removal and the explosion for Superman to get it to a safe distance using his superspeed.

Emil has designed various prosthetic arms with unusual abilities, including one that acted as a [[sunscreen]] dispenser.

==Other versions==
Professor Hamilton made an appearance in the ''[[Elseworlds]]'' tale, ''[[JLA: The Nail]]''.&lt;ref&gt;''JLA: The Nail'' #2 (September 1998), DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; In this story, Hamilton still operates S.T.A.R. labs, but it is a secret-alien research facility in [[Smallville, Kansas]] that includes various heroes and villains who have been publicly identified as aliens to increase paranoia among the population (it is unclear if Hamilton is a willing part of the propaganda program or genuinely believes the idea that metahumans are alien invaders). Hamilton also appeared in ''[[Elseworld's Finest: Supergirl and Batgirl]]'', featuring [[Batgirl]] and [[Supergirl]], having previously worked with Lex Luthor to create a new solar battery only to be disgraced when he tried to reveal the truth about the project (it actually uses the corpse of the infant Kal-El as a power source).&lt;ref&gt;''Elseworld's Finest: Supergirl and Batgirl'' #1 (September 1998), DC Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; He also appears in the ''[[Smallville (TV show)|Smallville]]'' Season Eleven comic, a continuation of the TV series.

==In other media==

===Television===
* Dr. Emil Hamilton appeared in two episodes of ''[[Lois and Clark: The New Adventures of Superman]]'' (both in the second season), as a S.T.A.R. Labs scientist, played by [[John Pleshette]]. In the episode "That Old Gang of Mine", Hamilton had used the DNA of [[Al Capone]] (portrayed by [[William Devane]]) to regenerate the criminal as part of an experiment that would reprogram him as a good citizen, though this also led to Al Capone making Hamilton recreate [[John Dillinger]] (portrayed by [[Robert Clohessy]]) and [[Bonnie and Clyde]] (portrayed by [[Amy Hathaway]] and [[Joseph Gian]]) as part of a plot to take over Metropolis. The clones are defeated by Superman and arrested by the police as Hamilton goes quietly with Detective Wolfe. In the episode "Return of the Prankster", Hamilton explains to Lois Lane and Clark Kent how [[Prankster (comics)|Prankster]]'s light ray causes paralysis, and makes special contact lenses for Superman to use in order to defeat Prankster.
* Professor Hamilton was a regular in ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'', voiced by [[Victor Brandt]]. He is the director of S.T.A.R. Labs. He constructs things such as [[Kryptonite]]-resistant suits from [[lead]] and inter-[[dimension]]al warps, as well as working a [[Phantom Zone]] projector in the episode "Blasts from the Past". After [[Darkseid]]'s brainwashing of Superman in the third season's finale "Legacy", Hamilton begins to feel a growing distrust of [[metahuman]]s.
* In the [[DC Animated Universe]] show ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'', Professor Hamilton (voiced by [[Robert Foxworth]]) had secretly become a confederate of [[Amanda Waller]], the leader of [[Project Cadmus]]. Hamilton is Cadmus' expert geneticist who uses [[cloning]] and other such methods to create metahumans loyal and subservient to that organization. This includes a clone of Supergirl in the season one episode "Fearful Symmetry" named [[Power Girl|Galatea]], who would be of primary importance in the Cadmus Project's endeavors against the Justice League. Superman finally discovers Hamilton's betrayal of trust in Season 2 of ''JLU''. Hamilton is unrepentant of his actions, and makes it clear that he believes Superman can never be fully trusted again, comparing Superman to [[Lucifer]]. In one surprising moment, Galatea hugs Hamilton referring to him as "Daddy". After Galatea's defeat, Hamilton was never seen again.
* There were two Professor Hamiltons in the live-action TV series ''[[Smallville]]'':
:: '''Steven Hamilton''' was introduced in the [[Smallville (season 1)|first season]], portrayed by [[Joe Morton]]. He was hired by [[Lex Luthor (Smallville)|Lex Luthor]] to examine the effects of kryptonite, and later to produce a cure for the effects of the deadly Nicodemus flower during his work for Cadmus Labs. In the [[Smallville (season 2)|second season]], he dies from overexposure to kryptonite. The series has given no indication of any relationship between Steven and Emil Hamilton other than a shared surname.

[[File:EmilHamiltonSmallville.jpg|thumb|right|Emil Hamilton on ''[[Smallville (TV series)|Smallville]]'']]
:: In the [[Smallville (season 8)|season eight]] episode "Identity", Emil Hamilton's name was seen in a ''[[Daily Planet]]'' article about the mysterious "Red-Blue Blur", [[Clark Kent (Smallville)|Clark Kent's]] earliest superhero identity, which had been sighted around the city of [[Metropolis (comics)|Metropolis]]. His first on-screen appearance is in the episode "Bulletproof", where he is played by [[Alessandro Juliani]], who went on to appear in a total of 14 episodes. He appears as a private doctor hired by [[Green Arrow (Smallville)|Oliver Queen]] for his [[Justice League (Smallville)|team]] who saves the [[Martian Manhunter (Smallville)|Martian Manhunter's]] life following being shot by a corrupt police officer.

:: In "Beast", after Clark loses the use of his powers to [[Parasite (comics)|Parasite]], Hamilton equips Clark with a fast, high-tech car. In [[Smallville (season 10)|season ten]], he regularly assists the Justice League, he is subject to interrogation by proponents of the Vigilante Registration Act, attends Clark's bachelor party, and has a short-lived romance with [[Tess Mercer]] ([[Cassidy Freeman]]).

* In the TV series ''[[Supergirl (TV series)|Supergirl]]'', Sarah Robson portrays [[Department of Extranormal Operations|DEO]] Doctor '''Amelia Hamilton''', a female version of the character.

===Film===
* Dr. Emil Hamilton was portrayed by [[Richard Schiff]] in [[Zack Snyder]]'s 2013 film, ''[[Man of Steel (film)|Man of Steel]]''. In this version, he is a [[DARPA]] scientific adviser for the [[U.S. military]], who is hired to view the Kryptonian [[Fortress of Solitude|scout ship]] found in the [[Arctic]]. He later attends the interrogation of [[Lois Lane]] and Superman, and plays a crucial part in the film's climax, in which he helps destroy the Kryptonian [[world engine]] that threatened to destroy all human life, though Hamilton sacrifices his own life in the process.
* An alternate universe version of Emil Hamilton appears in ''[[Justice League: Gods and Monsters]]'', voiced by [[Trevor Devall]]. He is part of LexCorp's "Project Fair Play", a weapons contingency program that would destroy the Justice League if necessary. Professor Hamilton is seen discussing the project with the other scientists involved (consisting of [[Will Magnus]], [[Steel (John Henry Irons)|John Henry Irons]], [[Mister Terrific (Michael Holt)|Michael Holt]], [[Pat Dugan]], [[Doctor Light (Kimiyo Hoshi)|Kimiyo Hoshi]], [[Bumblebee (comics)|Karen Beecher]], [[T. O. Morrow|Thomas Morrow]], and [[Stephen Shin]]) before they are attacked and killed by the Metal Men with the exception of Will Magnus (who secretly orchestrated the attack).

===Video games===
* In the 1999 video game ''[[Superman 64]]'', Professor Hamilton appears as a supporting character alongside Jimmy Olsen and Lois Lane, but they are captured by Lex Luthor in the beginning of the game.

'''Robotman''' ('''Clifford "Cliff" Steele''', called '''Automaton''' in first two appearances) is a [[fictional character]], a [[cyborg]] [[superhero]] in the {{DC Universe}}. He is best known as a member of the [[Doom Patrol]], being the only character to appear in every version of the team since he, and the team, were introduced together in June 1963.

Robotman has appeared in numerous cartoon television shows and films. Robotman made his first live adaptation as a guest star on the ''[[Titans (2018 TV series)|Titans]]'' television series for the new DC streaming service played by Jake Michaels. He will be part of the main cast of the upcoming ''[[Doom Patrol (TV series)|Doom Patrol]]'' television series on the DC streaming service. Riley Shanahan will take over from Michaels in Doom Patrol. [[Brendan Fraser]] provides the voice of Robotman and will portray Cliff Steele in the upcoming series.

==Publication history==
Robotman first appeared in ''[[My Greatest Adventure]]'' #80 (June 1963) and was created by [[Arnold Drake]] and [[Bruno Premiani]]. According to Drake, the issue's co-writer [[Bob Haney]] was not brought on to the project until after Robotman was created.&lt;ref name="back65"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Browning|first=Michael |title=The Doom Patrol Interviews: Arnold Drake|journal=[[Back Issue!]]|issue=65 |pages=38-41 |publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|date=July 2013|location=Raleigh, North Carolina}}&lt;/ref&gt; He commented on the character's original name, Automaton: "That name was pretty stupid. I've been responsible for a lot of stupid things, but that was one of the stupidest, so, within two issues, I figured that out and changed his name to Robotman."&lt;ref name="back65"/&gt;

Robotman was the only original member of the Doom Patrol to appear with the team's second incarnation, which debuted in ''[[Showcase (comics)|Showcase]]'' #94-96 (Aug. 1977 - Jan. 1978). The reboot was accompanied by Robotman getting a new body, which was designed by artist [[Joe Staton]] at writer [[Paul Kupperberg]]'s request. Kupperberg explained, "I was looking to update the strip, I suppose, [and] wanted to put my mark on it. There was nothing wrong with the original body designed by Bruno Premiani. In fact, ain't no one come up with a better design. Like the team's roster, I should have left that alone, too."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Browning|first=Michael |title=The Doom Patrol Interviews: Paul Kupperberg |journal=[[Back Issue!]]|issue=65 |page=43 |publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]] |date=July 2013|location=Raleigh, North Carolina}}&lt;/ref&gt; Staton said he patterned Robotman's new body after a young [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]]'s [[fanzine]] contribution (''[[Contemporary Pictorial Literature]]'') of the robot character [[Rog-2000]] "as a joke".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Johnson|first=Dan|title=Showcase Presents... Again|journal=[[Back Issue!]]|issue=71|page=51|publisher=[[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|date=April 2014|location=Raleigh, North Carolina}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fictional character biography==
Robotman is one of the founding members of [[Doom Patrol|the Doom Patrol]], along with [[Negative Man (comics)|Negative Man]] and [[Elasti-Girl]]. He is unique for being the only character to appear in every version of the Doom Patrol.&lt;ref name="dc-doom"&gt;{{Citation | last = Beatty | first = Scott | author-link = Scott Beatty | contribution = Doom Patrol | editor-last = Dougall  | editor-first = Alastair  | title = The DC Comics Encyclopedia  | pages = 109  | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]  | place = New York  | year = 2008 | ISBN = 0-7566-4119-5 | oclc = 213309017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pre-Crisis on Infinite Earths===

'''Cliff Steele''' became Robotman, initially dubbed '''Automaton''',&lt;ref name=toon&gt;[http://toonopedia.com/robotmn2.htm Robotman (1963)] at [[Don Markstein's Toonopedia]]. [https://www.webcitation.org/6bCPU2B2j?url=http://toonopedia.com/robotmn2.htm Archived] from the original on August 31, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; after the daredevil and race car driver was in an accident during the [[Indianapolis 500]], destroying his body. Caulder subsequently placed Cliff's intact brain into a robotic body. After the operation, Cliff suffered from frequent [[depression (mood)|depression]] because he viewed himself as less than human. A background serial in ''Doom Patrol'' #s 100, 101, 103 &amp; 105 (December 1965 &amp;ndash; August 1966, within 30 months of his introduction) retconned that Caulder made a mistake in the operation, causing Steele to go on a rampage, which Caulder corrected when he recruited Steele for the Patrol.

Sales of ''Doom Patrol'' had waned, and the creative team chose to kill off the entire team, including Robotman, in the final issue, ''Doom Patrol'' #121 (September–October 1968). The Doom Patrol sacrificed their lives to [[Madame Rouge]] and [[General Zahl]] (who pushed the actual kill button) to save the small fishing village of Codsville, [[Maine]].

In ''[[Showcase (comics)|Showcase]]'' #94 (Sept. 1977), it was revealed that Cliff's brain had survived and that [[Will Magnus]], the robotics expert who created the [[Metal Men]], had recovered Cliff's brain and built him a new body. Cliff then joined a new Doom Patrol headed by a woman claiming to be Niles Caulder's wife, Arani. Refusing to believe that Niles was dead, she formed this new team to search for him and took his place as leader, calling herself [[Celsius (comics)|Celsius]], due to her heat-and-cold-based powers.

===Post-Crisis on Infinite Earths===

Robotman's origin remained largely the same as his pre-Crisis origin save for the fact that it was revealed that [[Chief (comics)|Niles Caulder]]) had caused the accident that destroyed Cliff Steele's body. Cliff Steel was born in Brooklyn &lt;ref&gt;Secret Origins Annual vol 2 #1 (1987)&lt;/ref&gt;.

This team was eventually almost all killed in action, with Cliff voluntarily committing himself to an asylum in ''Doom Patrol'' (Vol. 2) #19 (Feb. 1989), having fallen into a state of depression due to his condition and the loss of his teammates. In particular, he was angry about being in a metal body and unable to enjoy the feeling and senses that humans take for granted. Caulder sent Magnus round to try to help Cliff. Magnus introduced him to a person with "worse problems than [his]": a woman called [[Crazy Jane]]. Cliff became Jane’s guardian, eventually falling in love with her. Near the end of [[Grant Morrison]]'s creative run on the title, Robotman’s human brain was revealed to have been replaced with a CPU, making him a robot in reality.

In [[Rachel Pollack]]'s creative run, Cliff's artificial brain began to malfunction so [[Dorothy Spinner]]'s Imaginary Friends "rebuilt" Cliff's old brain.&lt;ref name="vert-ency"&gt;{{Citation  | last = Irvine | first = Alex | author-link = Alexander C. Irvine | contribution = Doom Patrol | editor-last = Dougall  | editor-first = Alastair  | title = The Vertigo Encyclopedia  | pages = 61–63 | publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]  | place = New York  | year = 2008 | ISBN = 0-7566-4122-5 | oclc = 213309015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cliff later met and began a relationship with a bisexual, transgender woman named [[Coagula|Kate Godwin]]. At one point, Kate and Cliff merged and shared his memories.

===Blackest Night===
In the Doom Patrol's [[Blackest Night]] tie-in storyline, Robotman and [[Negative Man]] are attacked by [[Valentina Vostok|Negative Woman]], who has been revived as a member of the [[Black Lantern Corps]]. While they try to fight off their former comrade, Cliff is approached by his own brainless corpse, which has also been revived as a Black Lantern.&lt;ref&gt;''Doom Patrol'' (Vol. 5) #4&lt;/ref&gt;
Cliff correctly surmises that the ring powers his corpse, but finds removing it only causes a new body to regenerate instead. He and Negative Man trick the Black Lanterns into entering a warp gate to a [[Justice League|JLA]] checkpoint then try to put the incident behind them.

===The New 52===
In September 2011, [[The New 52]] rebooted DC's continuity. In this new timeline, a different version of the character debuted in the ''[[My Greatest Adventure]]'' miniseries in October 2011, written by [[Matt Kindt]]. This version of Cliff Steele is an adventurer and daredevil who agrees to be injected with experimental [[nanomachines]] designed to improve and repair his body. When he is involved in a fatal car crash during a high-speed race, the nanomachines respond by creating a robotic body in order to encase and protect his still living brain. Though he is initially distraught over his condition, the nanomachines prevent him from being able to kill himself. After coming to terms with his new body, he becomes a freelance hero, assisted by a woman named Maddy, who was involved in the nanomachine project and blames herself for Cliff's condition.

Cliff has since re-appeared as a supporting character in the Metal Men comic featured in the Legends of Tomorrow anthology.

===DC Rebirth===
In the "[[Young Animal (DC Comics)|DC Rebirth]]" reboot, Cliff has reappeared as a member of the latest incarnation of the Doom Patrol, in the iteration both his origin and romance with [[Crazy Jane]] return. When the universe was reset after the events of ''[[Milk Wars]]'', Cliff regained his human body.

==Powers and abilities==
Cliff's original mechanical body possessed superhuman strength, speed, and endurance. It was also equipped with electromagnetic feet that enabled him to scale metal walls, heating coils in his hands that enabled him to melt metals, an oxygen tank that could sustain his brain in an emergency, and a video communicator strapped to his chest that allowed Caulder to maintain contact with the team in the field, complete with visual information. Later bodies have featured various other functions, such as tools and weapons systems.

In the early comics, Cliff boasted of superior sight and hearing, though at the start of Grant Morrison's run, he complained of the crudity of mechanical senses as compared to human ones.

The post-reboot version of Cliff's robotic body is nanomachine based, allowing him to change its shape and abilities when needed. In addition, the nanomachines allow his body to repair itself from even the most severe damage. He is capable of flight, as well as underwater travel. His body boasts a wide array of sensors as well as greatly enhanced senses, and is able to recharge itself by consuming and processing organic material.

==In other media==
[[Image:TT robotman.jpg|220px|right|thumb|Robotman as depicted on ''[[Teen Titans (TV series)|Teen Titans]]''.]]
* Robotman has appeared in the two-part ''[[Teen Titans (TV series)|Teen Titans]]'' episode "Homecoming" voiced by [[Peter Onorati]]. He is shown as a member of the [[Doom Patrol]] along with overseer [[Mento (comics)|Mento]], [[Elasti-Girl]] and [[Negative Man]]. It was revealed that he was the second Robotman in "Homecoming: Part 1", when [[Beast Boy]] called him "Cliff", referencing his real name. In the TT origins episode "Go" [[Beast Boy]] referred to [[Cyborg (comics)|Cyborg]] as "Robotman 2.0".

* Robotman (alongside Doom Patrol members [[Chief (comics)|Chief]], [[Negative Man]], and [[Elasti-Girl]]), made an appearance in the ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold]]'' episode "The Last Patrol!" voiced by [[Henry Rollins]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comicsalliance.com/2009/09/17/henry-rollins-to-join-the-doom-patrol-in-batman-the-brave-and/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-05-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726120553/http://www.comicsalliance.com/2009/09/17/henry-rollins-to-join-the-doom-patrol-in-batman-the-brave-and/ |archivedate=2011-07-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In this version, he has become very downcast about the fact that he is almost indestructible and is constantly trying to commit suicide. Following the Doom Patrol's break-up, he ended up being a crash dummy for a car company. While walking out by the docks, he has a run-in with Arsenal and dares Arsenal to finish him off. Just then, Batman and the Doom Patrol arrive and help fend off Arsenal before being hit with knock-out gas by General Zahl. He and the other Doom Patrol members sacrifice their lives to stop the bomb at Codsville.

* Robotman appears in the "Doom Patrol" segments of ''[[DC Nation Shorts]]'' voiced by [[David Kaye (voice actor)|David Kaye]].

* Robotman will appear in the upcoming series ''[[Titans (2018 TV series)|Titans]]'', portrayed by Jake Michaels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://comicbook.com/dc/2018/02/22/titans-jake-michaels-robotman-doom-patrol/|title='Titans' Casts the Doom Patrol's Robotman (Exclusive)|last=Burlingame|first=Russ|date=|website=Comicbook.com|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rembrandt, bue squartato, 1655, 01.JPG|thumb|''Slaughtered Ox'', 1655. Oil on panel. 95.5 x 68.8 cm. Louvre, Paris]]

'''''Slaughtered Ox''''', also known as '''''Flayed Ox''''', '''''Side of Beef''''', or '''''Carcass of Beef''''', is a 1655 oil on [[beech]] panel [[still life]] painting by [[Rembrandt]]. It has been in the collection of the [[Louvre]] in Paris since 1857.  A similar painting is in [[Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum]], Glasgow, possibly by Rembrandt himself but probably by one of his pupils, perhaps [[Fabritius]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://artuk.org/discover/artworks/the-carcase-of-an-ox-85827 The Carcase of an Ox], ArtUK&lt;/ref&gt;  Other similar paintings by Rembrandt or more likely his circle are held by museums in Budapest and Philadelphia.  

The work follows in a tradition of artworks showing butchery, for example [[Pieter Aertsen]]'s ''[[A Meat Stall with the Holy Family Giving Alms]]'' (1551) and [[Annibale Carracci]]'s ''[[Butcher's Shop]]'' (c. 1583), and perhaps more specifically [[Joachim Beuckelaer]]'s ''[[:File:Joachim Beuckelaer - Slaughtered Pig - WGA2122.jpg|Slaughtered Pig]]'' (1563).  Rembrandt made a drawing of a similar scene c. 1635.  Another pre-1655 painting of a slaughtered ox (the example in Edinburgh, now attributed to Rembrandt's circle but formerly to Rembrandt) was perhaps inspired by a lost earlier work by Rembrandt himself.  In northern Europe, November was traditionally the time for slaughtering livestock, before winter made feed difficult to find.  

The painting measures {{convert|95.5|x|68.8|cm}}, and is signed and dated "Rembrandt f. 1655".  It shows the butchered carcass of a bull or an ox, hanging in a wooden building, possibly a stable or lean-to shed.  The carcass is suspended by its two rear legs, which are tied by ropes to a wooden crossbeam.  The animal has been decapitated and flayed of skin and hair, the chest cavity has been stretched open and the internal organs removed, revealing a mass of flesh, fat, connective tissue, joints, bones, and ribs.  The carcass is carefully coloured, and given texture by [[impasto]].  In the background, a woman appears behind a half-open door, lifting the painting from [[still life]] into a [[genre painting]], a scene of everyday life.  It is sometimes considered a [[vanitas]] or [[memento mori]]; some commentators make references to the killing of the fatted calf in the biblical story of the [[Prodigal Son]], others directly to the [[Crucifixion of Jesus]].

The painting was possibly owned by Christoffel Hirschvogel in 1661. It was viewed by [[Joshua Reynolds]] in the collection of [[Pieter Locquet]] in Amsterdam in 1781, and later owned by [[Louis Viardot]], who sold it to the [[Louvre]] in 1857 for 5,000 francs.

The work's muscular depiction inspired [[Honoré Daumier]], [[Eugène Delacroix]], a series of works by  [[Chaim Soutine]], and [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]].  Most particularly, Bacon's ''[[Figure with Meat]]'' depicts [[Pope Innocent X]], as painted by [[Velazquez]], accompanied by ghostly echoes of the carcass from Rembrandt's painting.

'''Swarm''' ('''Fritz von Meyer''') is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. The character has been depicted as a former [[Nazi]] sympathizer and has been mainly featured as an enemy of [[Spider-Man]]. His entire body is composed of [[bee]]s surrounding his skeleton.

==Publication history==
{{Expand section|date=December 2012}}
Swarm first appeared in ''[[Champions (1975 team)|Champions]]'' #14 (July 1977). He was created by [[Bill Mantlo]] and [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]].

==Fictional character biography==
Fritz von Meyer was born in [[Leipzig]], [[Germany]] and became one of [[Adolf Hitler]]'s top scientists. Escaping capture after [[World War II]], he became a [[beekeeper]] or apiarist in [[South America]] and discovered a colony of mutated [[bee]]s. Intrigued by their intelligence and passive nature, von Meyer attempted to enslave the queen bee but failed and the bees devoured him, leaving only his skeleton. The bees' unique qualities caused his consciousness to be absorbed into them, allowing von Meyer to manipulate the hive to do his will, although some of his skeletal remains are inside the swarm itself. His consciousness merged with the hive to the extent that they are one being, calling himself/themselves "Swarm".

Swarm battled the [[Champions (1975 team)|Champions]].&lt;ref&gt;''Champions'' #14–15 (1977)&lt;/ref&gt; After being defeated, Swarm resurfaced to battle the original [[Spider-Man]] (Peter Parker).&lt;ref&gt;''Spectacular Spider-Man'' #36–37&lt;/ref&gt; In the first of many fights, Spider-Man prevailed against him by dosing his own costume in a new type of [[insecticide]] that hurt the bees if they got too close to the web-slinger. Swarm lost his/their skeleton in this battle, but returned to fight again (no longer having the skeleton but still possessing von Meyer's consciousness), first teaming with [[Kraven the Hunter]] against [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]] and [[Firestar (comics)|Firestar]],&lt;ref&gt;''Spider-Man Family Amazing Friends'' #1&lt;/ref&gt; then against Spider-Man,&lt;ref&gt;''Lethal Foes of Spider-Man'' #3–4&lt;/ref&gt; but feedback from a weapon fired by the [[Rhino (comics)|Rhino]] caused Swarm's bee body to disperse temporarily.

Swarm next appears when a Super-Collider from [[Iron Fist (comics)|Rand Industries]] gets activated and called his/their attention.&lt;ref&gt;''Secret Defenders'' #18&lt;/ref&gt; Swarm decided mankind should be exterminated so insects can rule the world. [[Doctor Druid]] convinced Swarm that mankind will exterminate themselves and the age of insects can begin.&lt;ref&gt;''Secret Defenders'' #19&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, Swarm was tired of waiting and returned to New York, after a psychic wave generated by [[Onslaught (comics)|Onslaught]] disrupted the psychic field that bound him and his bees together. He forced a group of scientists investigating energy fields to help him not only restore his original field, but expand it to grant him control of every bee on Earth. As [[New York City]] was invaded by bees, the second [[Ben Reilly|Spider-Man]] (Ben Reilly) tracked the bees to their destination and — taking advantage of the fact that the swarms' instinctive memory of Peter's use of Raid caused them to automatically flinch away from Spider-Man — infiltrated the building and contacted the scientists. By claiming that the scientists' equipment was having trouble broadcasting a sufficiently powerful signal through the dome of bees, Spider-Man was able to trick Swarm into allowing the construction of a device designed to negate the vibrational frequency that the bees created to allow themselves to fly, presenting it as a means of boosting the power of the existing signal. With the bees now grounded, Spider-Man subsequently recovered the queen of Swarm's hive and left her in the care of the authorities, reasoning that without her, Swarm wouldn't be a future threat.&lt;ref&gt;''Sensational Spider-Man'' #9–10&lt;/ref&gt;

Now back with an internal skeleton, Swarm felt that the fall of the criminal organization [[Pride (comics)|Pride]] allowed access to their former territory, specifically [[Los Angeles]]. However, he/they are defeated by the [[Runaways (comics)|Runaways]], protectors of the city, when his/their body of bees' mental link is disrupted by electrical blasts.&lt;ref&gt;''Runaways'' vol. 2 #7&lt;/ref&gt;

Swarm regained control over his colony and joins the [[Chameleon (comics)|Chameleon]]'s Exterminators&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; to kill Spider-Man now that Parker's true identity is revealed. Swarm attacks [[Mary Jane Watson]] but Mary Jane sprays Swarm with water while a co-worker smashes Swarm's skeleton, but the bees reformed around the skeleton as Stark Industries bodyguards take him/them away.

When [[Kraven the Hunter (Alyosha Kravinoff)|Alyosha Kravinoff]] began collecting a [[zoo]] of animal themed superhumans, Swarm is in one of the cages.&lt;ref&gt;''The Punisher War Journal'' vol. 2 #15&lt;/ref&gt; He fought [[Gargoyle (comics)|Gargoyle]] as the [[Punisher]] passes them and escaped.

Swarm next turns up in [[Denver]], [[Colorado]], having amassed enough bees to become giant-sized. The [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]] face him/them unsuccessfully until [[Norman Osborn]] dispatches [[Mac Gargan|Venom]] devouring Swarm's bones. Osborn speculated this was, by now, a minor inconvenience that shouldn't prevent Swarm's return.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;''Thunderbolts'' #122&lt;/ref&gt;

Next, Swarm turns up in [[Buenos Aires]] having his intelligence again. He fought the [[Mighty Avengers (comics)|Mighty Avengers]] by creating 'avatars' made of bees. Notably, the Avengers roster included the [[Hank Pym|Wasp]], [[Cassandra Lang|Stature]] and [[Amadeus Cho]]. Stature placed an inhibitor collar on the queen bees which caused Swarm's intelligence to somehow disperse.&lt;ref&gt;''Mighty Avengers'' #24&lt;/ref&gt;

He was briefly seen trying to launch an attack of the [[Jean Grey|Jean Grey School for Higher Learning]] only to be almost instantly thwarted by the [[X-Men]]'s [[List of Marvel Comics characters: K#Krakoa|Krakoa]], the [[Bamf]]s, and [[Doop (comics)|Doop]].&lt;ref&gt;''Wolverine and the X-Men'' #18&lt;/ref&gt;

Swarm later formed his own incarnation of the [[Sinister Six]] with [[8-Ball (comics)|8-Ball]], [[Delilah (comics)|Delilah]], [[Killer Shrike]], [[Melter]] and [[Squid (Marvel Comics)|Squid]]. They attack Spider-Man and the students of the Jean Grey School for Higher Learning. Swarm gets dispersed by [[Hellion (Marvel Comics)|Hellion]] which caused the other members to surrender.&lt;ref name="Spider-Man and the X-Men #4"&gt;''Spider-Man and the X-Men'' #4&lt;/ref&gt;

Swarm later attacked New York but was defeated by [[Squirrel Girl]] and her ally Koi Boi covering him with water and turning bags full of his constituent bees in to the police.&lt;ref name="Unbeatable Squirrel Girl #7"&gt;''Unbeatable Squirrel Girl #7&lt;/ref&gt;

Swarm later appeared as a member of the Hateful Hexad alongside Bearboarguy, [[Gibbon (comics)|Gibbon]], [[Ox (comics)|Ox]], [[Squid (Marvel Comics)|Squid]] and [[White Rabbit (comics)|White Rabbit]]. During the disastrous battle against Spider-Man and [[Deadpool]], the battle is crashed by Itsy Bitsy.&lt;ref&gt;''Spider-Man/Deadpool'' #9&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
Swarm is a composite being of hundreds of thousands of bees driven by a human intelligence. He is technically intangible, as his body is merely an aggregate of tiny forms. He can fly through the air and assume any shape and size he desires. He can mentally influence the actions of other bees, the full range of which may extend over hundreds of yards in radius. At first, Swarm seemed capable of only controlling other bees, but he has exhibited the ability to communicate/control other insects as well. Fritz von Meyer's skeleton, the focal point of his consciousness, remained behind as his only remains until being devoured by Venom.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

==Other versions==

===''Marvel Fairy Tales''===

Swarm recently appeared and fought Spider-Man in ''[[Marvel Adventures]]''. He/they supposedly wanted to take over the world (or at least kill a few jocks), but it looked like he/they just wanted some ice cream.&lt;ref&gt;''Marvel Adventures'' #38&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ultimate Marvel===

==In other media==

===Television===
* A version of Swarm appeared in ''[[Spider-Man and His Amazing Friends]]'', voiced by [[Al Fann]]. This version was originally a beehive irradiated from the alien energy from a fallen meteorite. In the episode "Swarm", Swarm is given sentience via the meteorite. Wanting a hive mind throughout the universe, Swarm uses its eye blast ability to increase the size of bees and mutate humans into insect hybrid drones. When [[Spider-Man]], [[Firestar (comics)|Firestar]] and [[Iceman (comics)|Iceman]] fight Swarm, the mutated drone hybrids (which included [[Flash Thompson]] and [[Aunt May|May Parker]]) turn Firestar and Iceman into insect drone hybrids as well, however, were unable to turn Spider-Man due to the web-slinger's irradiated blood. After Spider-Man used a lead-lined room to restore Firestar and Iceman back to normal, the Spider-Friends launch the meteorite back into space, thus there was enough to distance for the bees and hybrids from the meteor's radiation, reversing all of Swarm's effects.
* An adapted iteration of Swarm appears in the ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' animated series,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://tv.ign.com/articles/122/1223457p1.html | title= Ultimate Spider-Man: Make Way for Iron Man! | first= Eric | last= Goldman | date= 20 April 2012| publisher= IGN.com | accessdate= 23 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; voiced by [[Eric Bauza]] (in "Swarm"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Swarm|series=Ultimate Spider-Man|network=Disney XD|season=2|number=11|airdate=June 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by [[Drake Bell]] (in "Sandman Returns").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode|title=Sandman Returns|series=Ultimate Spider-Man|network=Disney XD|season=2|number=24|airdate=October 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This version is '''Michael Tan''', a disgruntled and immature employee of [[Stark Industries]] that assumes the Swarm form via self-replicating nanobots. In his self-titled episode "Swarm", Michael's project to control technology as a personal extension is turned down and fired by [[Iron Man]]. Michael activates his device, vowing that Spider-Man and Iron Man will regret this before scattering his own molecules. Unknown to anyone, his molecules then fuses with Spider-Man's Spider-Tracer which turns himself into self-replicating nanobots. When Spider-Man faces the [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]] and uses the Spider-Tracer, something goes wrong as Juggernaut is surrounded by self-replicating nanobots. Spider-Man and Iron Man later fight Swarm, finding out that Michael is now the self-replicating nanobot villain. Intent on assimilating technology due to believing he's the future, Swarm splits into two to simultaneously attack Spider-Man and Iron Man until re-combining into one again. Swarm is eventually stopped when Spider-Man uses Iron Man's [[Iron Man's armor|arc reactor]] to amplify the Spider-Tracer's interface with a nullifying frequency as the web-slinger and Iron Man are thrown at Swarm. With Swarm neutralized, Iron Man confiscates the inactive nanobots to attempt Michael's reconfiguration. In the episode "Sandman Returns", Swarm attacks a [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] facility to assimilate the technology, resulting in a fight with Spider-Man and [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]]. Swarm targets Sandman's containment suit, forcing Spider-Man to get the containment suit off Sandman. Sandman then pummels Swarm into submission. In the episode "HYDRA Attacks" [Pt. 1], Swarm has a cameo appearance as one of the S.H.I.E.L.D. [[Helicarrier|Tri-Carrier]]'s prisoners. One of [[Doctor Octopus]]'s miniature Octobots overrides Swarm's nanobots; Swarm is presumably killed during the process. Spider-Man and [[Amadeus Cho]] realize Swarm's nanobots have been altered to convert the S.H.I.E.L.D. Tri-Carrier into [[Arnim Zola]]'s [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA Island]].

===Video Games===
* During [[Marvel's Spider-Man (video game)|Marvel's Spider-Man]], Swarm is referenced during one of J. Jonah Jameson's podcasts, as "a Nazi made of bees."

===Toys===
* An [[action figure]] of Swarm was released in 1997 as part of the Spider-Man: Spider Force toy line. It was molded in a translucent yellow plastic, and featured a removable cape and hood, and snap-on bee armor. This armor could also be assembled to create a 'giant' bee accessory.

===Theatre===
* Swarm appears in the [[Broadway musical]] ''[[Spider-Man: Turn Off the Dark]]'', played by Gerald Avery. He is featured as a member of the [[Sinister Six]].

'''''The Eagle with Two Heads''''' (French title '''''L'Aigle à deux têtes''''') is a French film directed by [[Jean Cocteau]] released in [[1948 in film|1948]].  It was adapted from his own play ''[[L'Aigle à deux têtes]]'' which was first staged in 1946, and it retained the principal actors from the first Paris production.

==Synopsis==
On the 10th anniversary of the assassination of the king, his reclusive widow, the Queen, arrives to spend the night at the castle of Krantz. Stanislas, a young [[anarchist]] poet who seeks to assassinate her, enters her room, wounded; he looks exactly like the dead king, and the Queen shelters him instead of handing him over to the police. She sees him as the welcome embodiment of her own death, calling him [[Azrael]] (the angel of death).  An ambiguous love develops between them, uniting them in a bid to outwit the machinations of the court politicians, represented by the Comte de Foëhn, the chief of police, and Édith de Berg, the Queen's companion.  In order to remain true to their ideals and to each other, the Queen and Stanislas have to play their parts in a bizarre private tragedy, which the world will never understand.

==Cast==
*[[Edwige Feuillère]] as  the Queen
*[[Jean Marais]] as  Stanislas
*[[Silvia Monfort]] as  Édith de Berg
*[[Jean Debucourt]] as  Félix de Willenstein
*[[Jacques Varennes]] as  Comte de Foëhn
*[[Ahmed Abdallah (actor)|Ahmed Abdallah]] as  Tony
*[[Yvonne de Bray]] as  La présidente

==Production==
[[L'Aigle à deux têtes|Cocteau's play]] was produced in Paris in 1946 and 1947, and his decision to make a prompt adaptation for the cinema allowed him to retain the principal actors who had enjoyed personal successes with their roles, especially Edwige Feuillère and Jean Marais.  Cocteau declared his intention of following the three-act structure of the play closely, citing his admiration of the methods of [[Ernst Lubitsch]],&lt;ref&gt;Jean Cocteau, in ''Combat'', 21 August 1947, quoted in [[Claude-Jean Philippe]], ''Jean Cocteau''. (Paris: Seghers, 1989) p.160: "À l'exemple de Lubitsch, que j'admire beaucoup, le film suivra la pièce de très près. Je l'ai construit autour des trois scènes principales".&lt;/ref&gt; but he opened out some of the scenes into a wider variety of locations. Filming began in October 1947 at the Château de [[Vizille]],&lt;ref&gt;René Gilson, ''Jean Cocteau cinéaste''. (Paris: Éditions des Quatre-Vents, 1988) p.26.&lt;/ref&gt; and further shots were filmed at the Studio d'Épinay on the outskirts of Paris.

[[Christian Bérard]] supervised the art direction, and the sumptuous sets and costumes (executed by [[Georges Wakhévitch]] and [[Marcel Escoffier]] respectively) evoked a royal palace in an imaginary kingdom of 19th century middle-Europe.  [[Georges Auric]] expanded the music which he had written for the stage production into a full score for the film.

==Reception==
The film was released in Paris in September 1948. Its reception among French critics was mixed. It was appreciated for the sumptuous quality of its spectacle and for the elevated performances of its actors.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Louis Chauvet, ''Le Figaro'', 26 August 1948, quoted in Claude-Jean Philippe, ''Jean Cocteau''. (Paris: Seghers, 1989) p.162: "Les personnages parlent une langue toujours belle, et mêmes leurs attitudes sont belles".&lt;/ref&gt;  Others however felt that its artificiality belonged to another age and another medium, and that Cocteau had not sufficiently emancipated his film from its theatrical origins.&lt;ref&gt;André Bazin, ''Parisien'', 29 September 1948, quoted in Claude-Jean Philippe, ''Jean Cocteau''. (Paris: Seghers, 1989) p.160: "''L'Aigle à deux têtes'' laisse indifférent comme un motif décoratif habilement inspiré du style d'une autre époque".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jean Néry, ''L'Écran français'', quoted in Claude-Jean Philippe, ''Jean Cocteau''. (Paris: Seghers, 1989) p.162: "Il n'a pas su (ou pas voulu) s'émanciper des disciplines théâtrales".&lt;/ref&gt;

When the film was shown in New York in 1948 and in London in 1949, the reviewers of both ''[[The New York Times]]'' and ''[[The Times]]'' shared a similar perplexity about the film's meaning and purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Bosley Crowther, "L'Aigle à deux têtes", in ''New York Times'', 30 December 1948: "It sometimes helps if a reviewer has a faint idea of what a film he is reviewing is supposed to be about... Unfortunately, Mr Cocteau neglected to make it clear... Plenty of money and taste have plainly been spent on a handsome physical production. Hapsburg {{sic}} splendor is in the sets and the costumes which Miss Feuillere fills out are lovely and flattering. But they all add up to nothing."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'' (London), 10 November 1949, p.7, col.C: "The passion of Cocteau for history and for legend, his conception of illusion and reality, his preoccupations with death and doom, his romantic mysticism, so heavy and overcharged that it is difficult to remember that he is a French and not a Teutonic director - all these are indeed present in this new film, but fitfully, as it were, as inadequate exponents of the mood and the motive of the initial impulse. The play may have made things clearer...".&lt;/ref&gt; The film has in general not enjoyed the same attention as the others which Cocteau directed in the 1940s.

'''Traian Brăileanu''' or '''Brăilean'''&lt;ref name="ac-h22"&gt;Andrei Corbea-Hoișie, "'Wie die Juden Gewalt schreien': Aurel Onciul und die antisemitische Wende in der Bukowiner Öffentlichkeit nach 1907", in ''East Central Europe'', Vol. 39, Issue 1, 2012, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; (September 14, 1882 – October 3, 1947) was an [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]]-born Romanian sociologist and politician. A native of the [[Bukovina]] region, he attended [[Chernivtsi University|Czernowitz University]], where he studied philosophy and classical languages, subsequently earning a doctorate. Ending up as a translator in Vienna, he fought for Austria during World War I. At the conclusion of hostilities, returned to the renamed [[Cernăuți]], now part of [[Greater Romania]]. There, he soon became a professor of sociology, leading a "Cernăuți School" of academics during the interwar period.

Meanwhile, he was involved in [[Romanian nationalism|nationalist politics]], supporting [[Alexandru Averescu]], [[Nicolae Iorga]] and, ultimately, the extremist [[Iron Guard]], of which he was among the most prominent intellectual backers. A theoretician of [[organicism]], [[corporatism]], and [[antisemitism]], he inspired the creation of ''[[Iconar]]'', a literary society, and founded the review ''Însemnări Sociologice''. He was elected to the [[Romanian Senate]] in 1937, and reached the apex of his political career during the short-lived [[National Legionary State]] of 1940–1941. He served as [[Ministry of National Education (Romania)|Education]] and [[Ministry of Culture and National Patrimony|Arts Minister]] under this regime, targeting the country's [[Romanian Jews|Jewish community]] and his various political opponents. In the wake of the [[Legionnaires' rebellion and Bucharest pogrom|Legionnaires' rebellion]], he was arrested, tried and acquitted, but later arrested again and interned.

Freed yet again in 1944, he was placed under house arrest following the [[King Michael Coup]] that August, and, increasingly ill with ulcers, was tried before one of the [[Romanian People's Tribunals]] in 1946. Given a twenty-year sentence, he died the following autumn at [[Aiud prison]], shortly before the establishment of a [[Communist Romania|communist regime]] that suppressed his publications for the more than four decades of its existence.

==Biography==

===Origins and education===
Born in [[Bilca]], [[Suceava County]], a village located in [[Duchy of Bukovina|Austrian-ruled Bukovina]] not far from [[Rădăuți]], Brăileanu was the ninth of twelve siblings. His father Gheorghe (1839–1902) was the director of the local primary school for at least forty years.&lt;ref&gt;Trebici, p. 385; Vintilă (2010), pp. 511&amp;ndash;512. See also Nastasă (2007), p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; Gheorghe's father Ioan, born in 1807, had been a simple peasant, but two of his sons became teachers, and the third a [[Romanian Orthodox]] priest.&lt;ref&gt;Vintilă (2010), p. 511&lt;/ref&gt; Traian's mother, Maria (''née'' Polonic) was the daughter of a shoemaker from [[Suceava]], and married his father in 1865. The first serious tragedy in his life came when his sister Ilenuța died, leaving the entire family despondent.&lt;ref name="v512"&gt;Vintilă (2010), p. 512&lt;/ref&gt; Another two beloved siblings died of [[diphtheria]] in late 1893, leaving him a mature individual at an early age.&lt;ref name="v513"&gt;Vintilă (2010), p. 513&lt;/ref&gt; His mother predeceased his father, so that both parents had died by the time he was twenty.&lt;ref name="v514"&gt;Vintilă (2010), p. 514&lt;/ref&gt; The young Traian was a voracious reader, his interests including classical literature, German literature, other European literatures in German translation, Romanian literature and Romanian history, including [[Alexandru Dimitrie Xenopol]]'s ''Istoria românilor''.&lt;ref name="v513"/&gt; He was attached to his brother Constantin, who settled in the [[Romanian Old Kingdom]], which he represented as consul at [[Bitola]] and [[Thessaloniki]]; an employee of the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Romania)|Romanian Foreign Ministry]], his son was killed in action during World War I.&lt;ref name="t385"&gt;Trebici, p. 385&lt;/ref&gt;

Brăileanu attended three grades of primary school in his native village, followed by a fourth grade in 1892–1893 at Rădăuți, where he and a number of Romanian classmates spent the year perfecting their German and preparing for admission to the local [[Eudoxiu Hurmuzachi National College|German High School]].&lt;ref&gt;Vintilă (2010), pp. 514–515&lt;/ref&gt; He passed the entrance examination easily, entering the school in the autumn of 1893.&lt;ref name="v515"&gt;Vintilă (2010), p. 515&lt;/ref&gt; German was the language of instruction; Latin and Greek the principal subjects. Upon graduation in 1901, he was fluent in all three. Entering [[Chernivtsi University|Czernowitz University]], he took courses in philosophy and classical philology, the subjects of his degree.&lt;ref&gt;Trebici, p. 385. See also Bruja (2006), p. 223&lt;/ref&gt; His professors included [[Richard Wahle]] and [[Ion G. Sbiera]].&lt;ref&gt;Bruja (2006), p. 223; Vintilă (2010), pp. 516–517&lt;/ref&gt; Initially, he shared a rented room with two older sisters of his, who were attending a [[normal school]].&lt;ref name="v516"&gt;Vintilă (2010), p. 516&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1902, after starting his second year of university, he went to the Romanian capital [[Bucharest]] to bury his father, who had sought medical treatment there.&lt;ref name="v519"&gt;Vintilă (2010), p. 519&lt;/ref&gt;

As a student, he was associated with ''[[Societatea Academică Junimea]]'', a Romanian youth movement. In December 1901, already a member of the local chapter, he was selected as editor-in-chief of its satirical-humorous newsletter. Under his aegis it appeared bimonthly, and some issues were written entirely by Brăileanu.&lt;ref&gt;Vintilă (2010), pp. 518–519&lt;/ref&gt; In 1904, he was named president of the society's literary section. In this capacity, together with [[Ion Nistor]] and [[George Tofan]], he founded ''[[Junimea Literară]]'', a literary journal. There, he published a short story, a series of humorous sketches and several poems.&lt;ref&gt;Bruja (2006), p. 223; Trebici, p. 385; Vintilă (2010), p. 520. See also Cândea, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; The magazine had a nationalist and ''[[Sămănătorul|Sămănătorist]]'' agenda, and, according to Nistor, sought to counterbalance Austria's "hatred and contempt for all things [Romanian]".&lt;ref&gt;Filipovici, pp. 259–260&lt;/ref&gt; Another member, [[Romulus Cândea]], described the society and its magazine as preservers of "the nationalist flame" and "the Romanianist line".&lt;ref&gt;Cândea, pp. 46–47&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon graduation, Brăileanu became a teacher at a German-language high school in Czernowitz, but, not finding the daily routine suitable to his studies, left after completing the 1905–1906 academic year.&lt;ref name="v521"&gt;Vintilă (2010), p. 521&lt;/ref&gt; He then performed his military service in the [[Imperial-Royal Landwehr|Austrian Army]], first at Czernowitz and then at the officers' school in [[Lviv|Lemberg]].&lt;ref&gt;Vintilă (2010), pp. 521–522&lt;/ref&gt; For a time, he held a series of low-paid jobs, including that of journalist.&lt;ref&gt;Vintilă (2010), p. 522&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1908, he was penning articles for various newspapers secretly run by [[Aurel Onciul]], a controversial leader of the [[Democratic Peasants' Party (Bukovina)|Democratic Peasants' Party]].&lt;ref name="ac-h22"/&gt; In November 1909, Brăileanu obtained a doctorate in philosophy ''magna cum laude'', his adviser being Wahle.&lt;ref name="t385"/&gt; The same year, he became engaged to Emilia Silion, of an old Bukovina family; the couple, who married in 1910, had three sons and a daughter.&lt;ref&gt;Trebici, p. 385; Vintilă (2010), p. 522&lt;/ref&gt;

===Academic beginnings===
Thanks to his elder brother, in 1909 he obtained a position as translator at the Romanian Legation in Vienna, where he remained until 1914. During this period, he took courses at the [[University of Vienna]] and undertook research at its library. In 1912, he published a work of [[epistemology]], followed by one on [[ethics]] (''Die Grundlegung zu einer Wissenschaft der Ethik'') in 1919.&lt;ref&gt;Herseni, p. 560; Trebici, p. 386&lt;/ref&gt; During that interval, he became especially interested in the work of [[Vasile Conta]], a 19th-century metaphyisician and political thinker. Writing in 1915, Ana Conta Kernbach identified Brăileanu as one of "the few young men who are researching [Conta's] work".&lt;ref&gt;Ana Conta Kernbach, "Biografia lui B. Conta (urmare)", in ''[[Viața Românească]]'', Nr. 10–11–12/1915, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon the outbreak of World War I, Brăileanu was drafted into the Austrian Army. Wounded, he was hospitalized in [[Bohemia]], then moved to Lemberg with his regiment, after which he returned to Vienna. Meanwhile, his wife and the two children had taken refuge in [[Siret]] and then in Suceava, later returning to Austria. The union of Bukovina with Romania occurred at the end of World War I, and he immediately left Vienna for his native province, upon his older brother's urging.&lt;ref name="v523"&gt;Vintilă (2010), p. 523&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 1919, Brăileanu was a librarian at his alma mater in what was now Cernăuți. He occupied this role until 1921, while in 1920, he became a lecturer. In 1924, he was named full professor at the department of sociology, ethics and politics.&lt;ref&gt;Bruja (2006), pp. 223, 224–226; Nastasă (2007), pp. 117–118, 259; (2010), p. 367; Trebici, p. 386&lt;/ref&gt; As an academic, his objective was to write survey texts of sociology, then ethics and finally politics. His introduction to sociology, published in 1923,&lt;ref name="t386"&gt;Trebici, p. 386&lt;/ref&gt; was noted for on the sociological work of Conta, whom he identified as the founder of [[Romanian philosophy]], and a personal guide. Following Conta, Brăileanu described a [[Holism|holistic]] social system of [[organic unity]], grouping "social tissues", for which he eventually coined the term "human community". While ethics dealt with individual behavior, the community was the inextricable object of sociology.&lt;ref&gt;Herseni, pp. 560–562&lt;/ref&gt; His first major success, this work drew positive reviews from, among others, [[Nicolae Iorga]].&lt;ref name="v527"/&gt; Nicknamed "[[Socrates]]" by his admiring students, he was known to appreciate the term, considering the Greek philosopher a model.&lt;ref name="v512"/&gt;

Politically, he was, after 1919, involved in nationalist movements within the nascent [[Greater Romania]]. Brăileanu was at first a follower of [[Alexandru Averescu]] and his [[People's Party (interwar Romania)|People's League]], the Bukovina wing of which he led. He was involved in a lengthy dispute with a Nicolai Mitenco, after deposing him as editor of ''Țărănimea'' newspaper and "purging" the party of undesirables.&lt;ref&gt;Bruja (2006), pp. 228–230&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1924, with an article he published in ''[[Societatea de Mâine]]'', Brăileanu sought to identify the political problems of Greater Romania as they affected Bukovina's society. It suggested that, in the new political climate, "entirely stunted by the supremacy of timely politics, or what we call politicking", Romanian intellectuals were "caving in to a despotic domination by the bankers".&lt;ref&gt;Brăileanu, pp. 480, 481&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed that the [[Bukovina Jews]] were a parasitical class, 90% of whom "made a living from the stupidity of the native population", and justified [[economic antisemitism]] as a reaction to historical "imbalance". Nonetheless, he argued in favor of complete [[Jewish assimilation]], including "long processes of interbreeding" with Romanians and a renewed social organization, based on the "[[division of labor]]" (with references to Conta and [[Émile Durkheim]]).&lt;ref&gt;Brăileanu, p. 480&lt;/ref&gt;

===Joining the Iron Guard===
Brăileanu eventually quit the People's League due to internal maneuvers that displeased him. Then, he entered the [[Democratic Nationalist Party (Romania)|Democratic Nationalist Party]] of Iorga, whom he sincerely respected, and organized the party's Bukovina chapter from 1922 to 1925. He left this party too, unhappy with certain mergers it had undergone.&lt;ref&gt;Bruja (2006), p. 224; Trebici, p. 387; Vintilă (2010), p. 525&lt;/ref&gt; Progressively, Brăileanu identified with the extreme right, claiming that the political mainstream took a "soft attitude" toward ethnic minorities.&lt;ref&gt;Bruja (2006), p. 224; Heinen, p. 168&lt;/ref&gt; He migrated to the antisemitic [[National-Christian Defense League]] (LANC), which he left following a disagreement with its leader [[A. C. Cuza]].&lt;ref&gt;Bruja (2006), p. 224; Heinen, p. 116&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1926–1927, Brăileanu was member of the small political group called "Statutory LANC", which, as academic Lucian Butaru noted, was home to "shady figures of the Romanian political and cultural life", including [[Ion Zelea Codreanu]] and [[Corneliu Șumuleanu]].&lt;ref&gt;Butaru, p. 102. See also Heinen, p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, he presided over a commission which investigated the clashes between Romanian authorities in Bukovina and Jewish students who had failed the [[Romanian Baccalaureate]]. He wrote an angry report, noting that Jews were ignorant of "the history and geography of the fatherland", and claiming that the riots were "premeditated".&lt;ref&gt;Livezeanu, pp. 82–83&lt;/ref&gt; His antisemitic bias was brought up publicly by [[Mayer Ebner]], the Jewish community spokesman, and may have led to Brăileanu's eventual dismissal.&lt;ref&gt;Livezeanu, p. 83. See also Clark, p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; This came in July 1927, when the governing [[National Liberal Party (Romania, 1875)|National Liberal Party]] reasserted control over his university.&lt;ref&gt;Coresp., "Ingerințe și la Universitatea din Cernăuți", in ''[[Adevărul]]'', July 12, 1927, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

Brăileanu was one of the editors of [[Gheorghe Alexianu]]'s ''Bucovina'', a review of law, sociology, and criminology,&lt;ref&gt;Ileana-Stanca Desa, Dulciu Morărescu, Ioana Patriche, Cornelia Luminița Radu, Adriana Raliade, Iliana Sulică, ''Publicațiile periodice românești (ziare, gazete, reviste). Vol. IV: Catalog alfabetic 1925–1930''. [[Editura Academiei]], Bucharest, 2003, {{ISBN|973-27-0980-4}}, p. 111&lt;/ref&gt; and contributed to [[Ion Petrovici]]'s philosophical journal, ''Minerva'', with an essay on the sociology of [[Vilfredo Pareto]].&lt;ref&gt;C. D. Fortunescu, "Recenzii. Reviste", in ''Arhivele Olteniei'', Nr. 32–33/1927, pp. 397–398&lt;/ref&gt; By then, his sociological work intertwined with his politics. As noted by historian Lucian Nastasă, he was one of the Romanian academics whose work exemplifies "strongly nationalistic and extremist ideologies".&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1928 ''Politica'', considered the first Romanian volume of political theory,&lt;ref name="v527"/&gt; he suggested the establishment of a [[military dictatorship]] to consolidate the Romanian monarchy.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, p. 143; Volovici, p. 162&lt;/ref&gt;

Brăileanu most likely joined the [[Iron Guard]] (or "Legionary Movement"), a radical antisemitic and [[Fascism|fascist]] group, upon its founding in 1927.&lt;ref&gt;Bruja (2008), p. 297; Livezeanu, p. 82; Vintilă (2010), p. 526; Volovici, p. 70. Heinen (p. 116) believes that this affiliation only happened in 1930&lt;/ref&gt; He entered its senate in 1930, helping to consolidate the movement's intellectual prestige,&lt;ref&gt;Heinen, pp. 125, 155, 193–194&lt;/ref&gt; and is seen by some as its most important theoretician after [[Nae Ionescu]].&lt;ref name="v527"&gt;Vintilă (2010), p. 527&lt;/ref&gt; Possibly radicalized under the influence of racial [[Eugenics|eugenicist]] [[Iordache Făcăoaru]],&lt;ref&gt;Butaru, pp. 234–235&lt;/ref&gt; Brăileanu's views on minority issues were recast into a [[Scientific racism|scientifically racist]] sociological theory, which postulated that Jews were not capable of being integrated into any other nation.&lt;ref&gt;Volovici, p. 162&lt;/ref&gt; His support for [[racial determinism]] led him to conclude that "the variation of social types" was only a historical action of environmental and demographic factors, and that, in all other respects, individuals of the same race were identical.&lt;ref&gt;Herseni, pp. 561–564&lt;/ref&gt;

Brăileanu also founded the literary society ''[[Iconar]]'', noted for its strong [[xenophobia]], which eventually divided itself into a far-right wing, under Brăileanu, and a more moderate one, supportive of the National Liberals.&lt;ref&gt;Filipovici, pp. 261–262. See also Clark, p. 147&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in 1936 for [[Marta Rădulescu]]'s ''Revista Mea'', he demanded a neo-traditionalist and nationalist revival in Romanian art, placed in service to "the Church and the State", and rejecting "kike commercialism".&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, pp. 423–424; Traian Sandu, "À régime nouveau, Panthéon littéraire nouveau. Écrire l'histoire d'une littérature légionnaire à venir", in ''Cahiers de la Nouvelle Europe'', Vol. 198, 2008 (''Actes du colloque Frontières de l'histoire littéraire, organisé à Paris les 9 et 10 novembre 2007 par Jean Bessière et Judit Maar''), p. 125&lt;/ref&gt; According to literary historian Rodica Ilie, his call to "purge Romanian society of corrupting influences" was a "trope" shared by extreme nationalists and communists of the day, the latter of whom targeted "bourgeois seductions" rather than "Jewish spirituality".&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Rodica Ilie, [http://tara-barsei.ro/wp-content/uploads/2009/02/ilie2007.pdf "Diversitate artistică și ideologică în avangarda românească. Fenomenul «alogen» evreiesc"], in ''Țara Bârsei'', Nr. 6/2007, p. 246&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the interval, Brăileanu carried on with his research, writing textbooks of sociology and ethics for the high school level. A translator from German and Greek, he was especially drawn to [[Immanuel Kant]] and [[Aristotle]]. Brăileanu's translation of the ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' appeared in 1930,&lt;ref name="t386"/&gt; being hailed by philosopher [[Tudor Vianu]] as one of the prime achievements of its era,&lt;ref&gt;[[Tudor Vianu]], "Mișcarea filozofică în Deceniul Restaurației", in ''[[Revista Fundațiilor Regale]]'', Nr. 6/1940, p. 736&lt;/ref&gt; but criticized by [[Ernest Bernea]] as "confusing" and "fragmentary".&lt;ref&gt;[[Ernest Bernea]], "Dări de seamă. Immanuel Kant: ''Critica rațiunii practice''", in ''Țara Bârsei'', Nr. 4/1935, p. 401&lt;/ref&gt; There followed more works on ethics (1935–1936) and the history of sociological doctrines (1936–1937).&lt;ref name="t386"/&gt; From 1931 to 1933, he was dean of the Philosophy and Letters Faculty. He had ties to foreign sociologists, and in 1937 became a member of the [[Columbia University]]-affiliated [[Academy of Political Science]].&lt;ref&gt;Bruja (2006), p. 223; Trebici, p. 387&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, from 1933 he was assistant professor in the history of philosophy department, replacing the deceased [[Vasile Gherasim]].&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), p. 117; (2010), pp. 366–367. See also Trebici, p. 386, Vintilă (2010), p. 523&lt;/ref&gt; He was made a commander of the [[Order of the Crown (Romania)|Order of the Crown]] in 1933.&lt;ref&gt;Bruja (2006), p. 223; Vintilă (2010), p. 523&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Însemnări Sociologice'' and senatorial mandate===
Brăileanu ultimately became the unchallenged leader of a sociological school at Cernăuți, akin to those led by [[Dimitrie Gusti]] at Bucharest, [[Virgil Bărbat]] at [[Cluj]] and [[Petre Andrei]] at [[Iași]].&lt;ref&gt;Vintilă (2012), p. 483&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, he founded ''Însemnări Sociologice'' magazine. As noted by various historians, it should be seen as largely dedicated to supporting the Iron Guard platform.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, pp. 130–131, 143, 145–146, 155, 162; Heinen, pp. 167, 168; Ornea, p. 58; Valentin Săndulescu, "«Sămânţa aruncată de diavol»: Presa legionară şi construirea imaginii inamicilor politici (1927–1937)", in ''Studia Universitatis Petru Maior. Series Historia'', Vol. 7, 2007, p. 160; Volovici, pp. 162–163&lt;/ref&gt; Brăileanu's articles there combined a condemnation of the [[multi-party system]] with the theory of "[[Jewish Bolshevism|Judaeo-communist revolution]]", arguing that the former would inevitably lead to the latter, and proposed instead a [[Corporatism|corporate state]] headed by the Guard.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, pp. 58–59&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leon Volovici]] concludes that ''Însemnări Sociologice'' "did not differ from Legionary propaganda", with its ample references to "the Internationale of the ''yids''", [[Anti-Masonry|anti-Masonic]] lore, and calls for [[racial segregation]] ("complete, biological and spiritual separation from the Jews").&lt;ref&gt;Volovici, pp. 162–163&lt;/ref&gt;

Brăileanu himself proudly acknowledged that there was little difference between his Guardist credo and his sociological work, describing ''Însemnări Sociologice'' as providing "Legionary doctrine" with "all the support of social science". "Doctrines", he argued, always took precedence over scientific observation, since "they determine the lives of individuals and peoples."&lt;ref&gt;Săndulescu, pp. 148–150&lt;/ref&gt; Brăileanu's writings, including his articles in teachers' magazines,&lt;ref&gt;C. D. Fortunescu, "Recenzii. Publicații periodice", in ''Arhivele Olteniei'', Nr. 86–87/1936, p. 532&lt;/ref&gt; shifted toward developing a Romanian "[[elite theory]]" and the role of state [[pedagogy]] in cultivating a fresh political establishment. His idea of corporatism differed from that espoused by [[Mihail Manoilescu]], arguing a strong dictatorship by an "ascetic elite", with a charismatic leader, could set up the Romanian corporations, but never the other way around.&lt;ref&gt;Heinen, pp. 165, 167. See also Ioanid, p. 126&lt;/ref&gt; He saw his "meritocratic aristocracy" embodied in [[Ion Moța]] and the other five Iron Guard men who left as volunteers for the [[Spanish Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;Clark, p. 213&lt;/ref&gt;

Invoking the examples set by [[Italian fascism]] and [[Nazism]], Brăileanu argued that educating the masses to accept leadership and social selection "without a murmur" was far more beneficial than perpetuating [[universal suffrage]].&lt;ref&gt;Ioanid, p. 126&lt;/ref&gt; In a June 1937 article for ''[[Buna Vestire]]'', he identified international fascism as the quintessential enemy of communism and Jewishness, and postulated that freedom was only possible within nationalism.&lt;ref name="gadcomu"&gt;{{ro icon}} Grigore Adriana Diana, [http://www.historia.ro/exclusiv_web/grigore-adriana-diana/articol/comunismul-nu-prins-romania-interbelica-cauza-miscarii-le "Comunismul nu a prins în România interbelică din cauza Mișcării Legionare"], in ''Historia'', April 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike other Guard intellectuals, he was skeptical of territorial expansionism, writing that, as Greater Romania, the Romanian state had reached its "[[natural border]]s" and economic self-sufficiency.&lt;ref&gt;Heinen, p. 190&lt;/ref&gt; His complaint was that the entity had not yet become a "[[nation state]]".&lt;ref name="gadcomu"/&gt;

Like the rest of the Guard, Brăileanu found himself in conflict with [[King of Romania|King]] [[Carol II of Romania|Carol II]] and the political factions who supported him, leading to a series of violent clashes and retaliatory murders. In 1936, he was one of 50 "nationalist luminaries" invited at the Guard's student congress in [[Târgu Mureș]].&lt;ref&gt;Țurlea, pp. 193–194&lt;/ref&gt; The event ended with mass arrests for conspiracy, during which time Brăileanu was asked to serve as the Guard's defense witness.&lt;ref&gt;Țurlea, p. 198&lt;/ref&gt; According to one report, ''Însemnări Sociologice'' was banned in February 1937.&lt;ref&gt;Vintilă (2010), p. 530&lt;/ref&gt; The Guard itself was also outlawed, but reemerged under the guise of the "Everything for the Country Party". Although by then a secondary figure, cut off from the major political centers,&lt;ref&gt;Heinen, p. 168&lt;/ref&gt; Brăileanu was deeply involved in its creation, in recruiting youth, and in organizing charity campaigns, his activities closely monitored by the [[Romanian Police]].&lt;ref&gt;Bruja (2008), ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; He was particularly enthusiastic about the Guard's work-camp network, deeming them the "formative school of the Legionary Romanian".&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, p. 374&lt;/ref&gt; Brăileanu was still the inspiration behind ''Iconar'', described in police records as "a camouflaged Legionary newspaper of the defunct Iron Guard".&lt;ref&gt;Bruja (2008), p. 299&lt;/ref&gt;  Other magazines he edited included ''Cugetări'', ''Poporul'', ''Gazeta Poporului'' and ''Înălțarea'', the last at [[Sibiu]] between 1940 and 1941.&lt;ref&gt;Bruja (2006), p. 223; Vintilă (2010), p. 531&lt;/ref&gt;

Brăileanu was sent to the [[Senate (Romania)|Romanian Senate]] following the [[Romanian general election, 1937|general election of December 1937]],&lt;ref&gt;Vintilă (2010), p. 528&lt;/ref&gt; having presented himself on Legionary lists for both Cernăuți and [[Câmpulung Moldovenesc]].&lt;ref&gt;Săndulescu, p. 154&lt;/ref&gt; Nationally, the split vote resulted in minority rule by a LANC successor, the [[National Christian Party]] (PNC), with the king's endorsement. Writing in ''Însemnări Sociologice'' in January 1938, Brăileanu complained that the PNC's antisemitic program was incomplete, since it failed to target liberal democracy, "that which has made kikes all-powerful". The LANC, he noted, had been too moderate, "demagogic and corrupt"; the Iron Guard would need to reemerge and "turn chaos to order".&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; He nevertheless displayed his and his party's loyalty toward the king, explaining for ''Buna Vestire'' that "the monarch represents the supreme principle of order and the political hierarchy".&lt;ref&gt;Ioanid, p. 125&lt;/ref&gt;

Brăileanu eventually lost his Senate seat the establishment of a single-party regime, the [[National Renaissance Front]] (FRN), in February 1938. He withdrew from political life, while his ''Iconar'' disciples sought a rapprochement with the FRN chapter in [[Ținutul Suceava]].&lt;ref&gt;Radu Florian Bruja, "''Suceava'' – o gazetă ținutală în slujba regimului autoritar carlist", in Raduț Bîlbîie, Mihaela Teodor (eds.), ''Elita culturală și presa (Congresul Național de istorie a presei, ediția a VI-a)'', [[Editura Militară]], Bucharest, 2013, {{ISBN|978-973-32-0922-5}}, p. 211&lt;/ref&gt; He focused on a synthesis of his [[sociological theory]], with ''Teoria Comunității Omenești'' ("The Theory of Human Community"), published in 1939 by Editura Cugetarea (second edition 1941).&lt;ref&gt;Larionescu, p. 389&lt;/ref&gt; The work also signified his distancing from both holism and the mainline, [[Positivism|positivist]], sociological school of Bucharest, turning to [[phenomenological sociology]] and [[pragmatism]], with more or less explicit borrowings from [[Edmund Husserl]] and [[William James]].&lt;ref&gt;Larionescu, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iron Guard Minister===
[[File:Alexandru Bassarab - Naşterea.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Alexandru Bassarab]]'s propaganda art: ''Nașterea'' ("Birth"), depicting the [[Archangel Michael]] watching over the crib of future Guard leader [[Corneliu Zelea Codreanu]]]]
Due to the [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina]] in the summer of 1940, Brăileanu was obliged to flee his home, and his entire personal library was lost.&lt;ref name="v532"&gt;Vintilă (2010), p. 532&lt;/ref&gt; He then entered the [[University of Bucharest]] as a professor.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, pp. 159, 312; Vintilă (2010), p. 532&lt;/ref&gt; From his new home in Bucharest, Brăileanu was consulted by the FRN regime and [[Prime Minister of Romania|Prime Minister]] [[Ion Gigurtu]], helping them draft Romania's first set of [[Antisemitic laws in Romania|antisemitic laws]].&lt;ref&gt;Butaru, pp. 294–295&lt;/ref&gt; A month later, the FRN dictatorship crumbled, and Carol II abdicated; the Guard seized the opportunity and proclaimed its [[National Legionary State]], with [[Ion Antonescu]] as the ''[[Conducător]]''. Brăileanu took over two ministerial portfolios, fused into one: the [[Ministry of National Education (Romania)|Ministry of Education and Religious Affairs]] and the [[Ministry of Culture and National Patrimony|Ministry of the Arts]]. His deputy was a Bucharest sociologist, [[Traian Herseni]].&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p. 159; Trebici, pp. 387–388; Săndulescu, p. 157; Turcuș &amp; Turcuș, pp. 268, 269&lt;/ref&gt; The staff he appointed also included other Guard affiliates: Făcăoaru, [[Haig Acterian]], [[Vasile Băncilă]], [[Dan Botta]], [[Eugen Chirnoagă]], [[Vladimir Dumitrescu]], and [[Radu Gyr]].&lt;ref&gt;Boia, pp. 159–160; Săndulescu, pp. 157–161&lt;/ref&gt;

Reportedly, Brăileanu's appointment prefigured later conflicts between the Guard and Antonescu: the latter disliked Brăileanu's radicalism, but yielded to pressures from [[Horia Sima]], the Guard Commander.&lt;ref&gt;Săndulescu, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; After assuming office, Brăileanu ordered changes in his ministry, but upheld and expanded upon the Gigurtu laws, equating interwar democracy with "the establishment of foreign and Kike rule".&lt;ref&gt;''Final Report'' of the [[Wiesel Commission|International Commission on the Holocaust in Romania]]. [[Polirom]], Iași, 2004, {{ISBN|973-681-989-2}}, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt; On his orders, Jewish students were expelled from Romanian high schools, excepting only those who could present proof that they were the direct descendants of war veterans;&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p. 171&lt;/ref&gt; he allowed for the creation of a private-run, fully segregated, Jewish educational system.&lt;ref name="rfb(09)299"&gt;Bruja (2009), p. 299&lt;/ref&gt; This policy enlisted protests from Jewish community leaders such as [[Wilhelm Filderman]] and [[Alexandru Șafran]]. Their protests, which went unanswered, noted that Brăileanu's criteria for segregation were more intransigent than the [[Nuremberg Laws]] in [[Nazi Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;Săndulescu, p. 163&lt;/ref&gt;

Brăileanu similarly ordered the segregation of Jewish actors, who were sacked from all Romanian theaters, public or private, "without restriction or exception". They could only be employed by "Jewish theaters", which had to advertise their racial makeup, and could only perform in plays screened for "anti-patriotic" content.&lt;ref&gt;Săndulescu, p. 162&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking at the time, the minister intimated his goal of outlawing [[Judaism]], and hinted at the possibility of destroying [[synagogue]]s, finding that these were "too many, if compared to the number of kikes."&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, pp. 414–415&lt;/ref&gt; One other decree issued during his term banned Romanian pupils from purchasing schoolbooks from Jewish-owned businesses, while another dismissed eleven Jewish high school teachers.&lt;ref&gt;Vintilă (2010), pp. 532–533&lt;/ref&gt;

Brăileanu also went after one of his FRN predecessors, the left-wing sociologist Andrei, declaring him an undesirable, banned from teaching in all public schools.&lt;ref&gt;Petru P. Andrei, "Omul și personalitatea lui Petre Andrei", in ''Transilvania'', Nr. 11/2011, p. 11; Stelian Neagoe, "Moartea purta cămașă verde", in ''[[Magazin Istoric]]'', November 1970, pp. 90–91&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1940, he countersigned the order to arrest Andrei, who was thus shamed into committing suicide.&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p. 186; Dumitru Stan, "Sociologia academică ieșeană de la origini la Petre Andrei", in ''Transilvania'', Nr. 11/2011, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; Brăileanu annoyed Antonescu by insisting on minute details of cultural and religious policy: he wanted to rename villages whose name still honored [[Ion G. Duca]], demanded the removal of frescoes depicting Carol II, and also proposed to shut down the Bucharest Crematorium, which he saw as anti-Christian.&lt;ref&gt;Săndulescu, p. 161&lt;/ref&gt; According to various reports, his Ministry encouraged the display of propaganda material in high schools, allowing teachers to put up portraits of the Guard's assassinated founder, [[Corneliu Zelea Codreanu]].&lt;ref&gt;Ștefan, pp. 41–43&lt;/ref&gt; The Guard was allowed to recruit young students, grouped into "Cross Brotherhoods"; teachers were prevented from interfering with their paramilitary activities, even when students skipped classes.&lt;ref name="mșt43–44"&gt;Ștefan, pp. 43–44&lt;/ref&gt; Enlistment therein was facilitated by rumors that non-members would be barred from entering universities.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, pp. 236–237&lt;/ref&gt;

Brăileanu's other decrees lifted [[academic freedom]], allowing the Ministry to intervene in college policy, and prioritized the academic employment of people who, like himself, were known Guard members or had been jobless since the Soviet occupation.&lt;ref&gt;Bruja (2009), ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; He disbanded the National Student Front, the sole student association established under the FRN, and lifted bans on other student associations.&lt;ref&gt;Bruja (2009), p. 299; Vintilă (2010), p. 534&lt;/ref&gt; However, these were effectively centralized into the National Union of Christian Students, which answered directly to Brăileanu, and the Student Front property was handed over to the Guard.&lt;ref name="rfb(09)299"/&gt; Creating "review boards" presided over by Herseni, Chirnoagă and Făcăoaru,&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p. 172; Bruja (2009), ''passim''; Săndulescu, pp. 164–166&lt;/ref&gt; Brăileanu also presided over the purge of former FRN men, Jews, and known leftists, and personally stripped [[George Călinescu]],&lt;ref&gt;C. Popescu-Cadem, ''Document în replică'', Mihail Sadoveanu City Library, Bucharest, 2007, {{ISBN|978-973-8369-21-4}}, p. 336&lt;/ref&gt; [[Iorgu Iordan]]&lt;ref&gt;Boia, pp. 185–186&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bazil Munteanu]]&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), p. 358&lt;/ref&gt; of their university chairs. He also ordered the immediate pensioning of all teachers aged 65 and over. This measure was designed to hurt Iorga, who had emerged as a major adversary of the Guard.&lt;ref&gt;Bruja (2009), pp. 298, 299&lt;/ref&gt;

Brăileanu's tenure at the twin Ministries is described by historian Marian Ștefan as a "vast program for the political influencing of both teaching body and youth."&lt;ref&gt;Ștefan, p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; He was applauded by Sima as a "doctrinaire of nationalism" and "one of the prime representatives of our race".&lt;ref&gt;Bruja (2006), p. 224&lt;/ref&gt; Co-opted on the Guard's executive committee, or "Legionary Forum",&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, p. 330&lt;/ref&gt; he was still particularly interested in the creation of a new Guardist elite. Unlike Sima, he saw in it a conservative rather than revolutionary force,&lt;ref&gt;Bruja (2009), pp. 299–300&lt;/ref&gt; lecturing on the topic and having his ideas reprinted in ''[[Universul]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Volovici, p. 163&lt;/ref&gt; He also attended to problems of school organization, took steps to enhance theological education,&lt;ref name="v533"&gt;Vintilă (2010), p. 533&lt;/ref&gt; and envisaged a state-sponsored translation program of the classics.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dionisie Pippidi]], "O colecție națională a scriitorilor greci și latini", in ''[[Revista Fundațiilor Regale]]'', Nr. 12/1940, pp. 639–641&lt;/ref&gt; Like Sima and painter [[Alexandru Bassarab]], he also promoted the ideal of a new "Legionary art", which advertised itself as the true representative of Romanian values.&lt;ref&gt;"Artă și ideologie: expoziția ''Munca legionară''", in ''Studii și Cercetări de Istoria Artei'', Vol. I, 2011, pp. 202–203&lt;/ref&gt; He described Codreanu as the national "educationist" and "great reformer of our times",&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, pp. 384–385&lt;/ref&gt; and overall a "holy torch" of the Romanian people.&lt;ref&gt;Săndulescu, p. 158&lt;/ref&gt;

===Downfall===
Together with Sima and Herseni, Brăileanu sought to establish full Guardist control over cultural institutes such as ''[[Accademia di Romania]]'', but their moves were vetoed by Antonescu, who favored a more conservative approach.&lt;ref&gt;Turcuș &amp; Turcuș, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; Brăileanu had a tense relationship with another one of Antonescu's proteges, [[Sextil Pușcariu]], who led the Romanian Institute in Berlin and had been given discretionary powers.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Daniela Olărescu, [http://www.arhivelenationale.ro/images/custom/image/serban/RA%201%202009/14%20olarescu,%20daniela.pdf "Sextil Puşcariu – preşedintele Institutului român din Berlin: un subiect tabu?"], in ''Revista Arhivelor'', Vol. LXXXVI, Issue 1, 2009, p. 182&lt;/ref&gt; Antonescu also asked Brăileanu to tone down his purge of academia, and the latter threatened with his resignation.&lt;ref&gt;Bruja (2009), p. 300&lt;/ref&gt; Horrified by the Guard's assassinations of Iorga and [[Virgil Madgearu]], in late November, he again tendered his resignation, but was persuaded to reverse his decision—allegedly, he agreed so that he could spare the country even greater chaos.&lt;ref name="v534"&gt;Vintilă (2010), p. 534&lt;/ref&gt;

The Guard and Antonescu still clashed over issues of political control, until, in January 1941, tensions exploded as the [[Legionnaires' rebellion and Bucharest pogrom|Legionary rebellion]]. During these events, the "Cross Brotherhoods" were activated in various schools, and some of their members took up arms against Antonescu's more conservative faction.&lt;ref name="mșt43–44"/&gt; The university student corps was also highly active during the events, and later organized an underground movement against Antonescu.&lt;ref&gt;Săndulescu, pp. 166–168&lt;/ref&gt; Within seven days, however, Antonescu had retaken control of the country and purged his government of Guardist ministers. Brăileanu's immediate successor was an apolitical figure, [[Radu R. Rosetti]], who proceeded to undo the politicization of schools and universities. However, as Rosetti himself noted, the Ministry was in effect under Antonescu's direct control.&lt;ref&gt;Ștefan, p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; Faced with ministerial suggestions for toning down the repression of Jews, Antonescu remained adamant that segregation was a valuable policy, and devised a system for its perpetuation.&lt;ref&gt;Săndulescu, pp. 168–169&lt;/ref&gt;

Arrested during the counter-coup,&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, p. 346; Trebici, p. 388&lt;/ref&gt; Brăileanu was jailed in a former Bucharest barracks.&lt;ref name="v536"&gt;Vintilă (2010), p. 536&lt;/ref&gt; He was sought after as an expert in Nazi Germany: in May, [[Ernst Krieck]], the racial scientist, invited him over as a [[visiting scholar]].&lt;ref&gt;Werner Mority, "Außenbeziehungen der Universität", in Wolfgang Uwe Eckart, Volker Sellin, Eike Wolgast (eds.), ''Die Universität Heidelberg im Nationalsozialismus'', [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]], Heidelberg, 2006, {{ISBN|978-3-540-21442-7}}, p. 168&lt;/ref&gt; Brăileanu was tried in June 1941 for "corrupting the youth"&lt;ref name="v536"/&gt; or "encouraging dissent among the military".&lt;ref name="sand171"&gt;Săndulescu, p. 171&lt;/ref&gt; After acting as his own attorney,&lt;ref name="v536"/&gt; he was acquitted of the more serious charge of treason, but sentenced to six months in jail for the lesser accusation.&lt;ref name="sand171"/&gt; A nephew of his, Virgil Procopovici, who had been visibly active in the Guard, was also detained at that time.&lt;ref name="ln(10)473"&gt;Nastasă (2010), p. 473&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1942, when rumors spread that Sima was preparing to return from exile with Nazi support, Brăileanu was re-arrested, alongside some 1,500 other Guard figures, and interned at [[Târgu Jiu]].&lt;ref&gt;Lazăr, p. 18. See also Boia, p. 200; Săndulescu, pp. 172–173; Vintilă (2010), p. 536&lt;/ref&gt; He arrived there together with his former subordinates Gyr and [[Petre P. Panaitescu]], and found themselves cold-shouldered by left-wing inmates. One of these was journalist [[Zaharia Stancu]], who made a point of noting that Brăileanu looked "ill and profoundly miserable."&lt;ref&gt;Săndulescu, pp. 172–173&lt;/ref&gt; Unusually, Brăileanu shared lodgings with a group of Jewish inmates such as Alexandru Albescu. Despite pleas from prominent members of the establishment, he was not released, whereas other detainees, including Gyr, left in February 1943.&lt;ref&gt;Lazăr, pp. 18–19&lt;/ref&gt;

Brăileanu was again freed in the spring of 1944 and repeatedly offered a chance to emigrate, which he declined. The year 1941 marked the end of Brăileanu's teaching career;&lt;ref name="t386"/&gt; he was forced to retire following his acquittal.&lt;ref name="v536"/&gt; Meanwhile, he continued his studies from 1941 to 1945, especially working on translations.&lt;ref name="t388"&gt;Trebici, p. 388&lt;/ref&gt; In 1944, the official publishing company, Casa Școalelor, issued his Romanian version of the ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]''—according to literary critic [[Adrian Marino]], it was a "failed attempt", and "downright impossible".&lt;ref&gt;[[Adrian Marino]], "Note. ''Arta poetică'' intr'o nouă versiune", in ''[[Revista Fundațiilor Regale]]'', Nr. 2/1945, p. 472&lt;/ref&gt; Philosopher Cristian Ducu also notes Brăileanu's inconsistent translation of the term ''ergon'', which results in "grave errors at the conceptual level."&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Cristian Ducu, [http://www.srfa.ro/rrfa/pdf/rfa-IV-1-ducu.pdf "Rolul argumentului funcției în etica aristotelică"], in ''Revista de Filosofie Analitică'', Vol. IV, Issue 1, 2010, p. 71&lt;/ref&gt;

===Postwar trial and death===
Following the [[King Michael Coup]] of August 1944, General [[Nicolae Rădescu]], soon to become prime minister, pointed to Brăileanu as among those guilty of the "national disaster" that had befallen the country. He was placed under house arrest, and was held under permanent watch in the room where he lay bedridden with a duodenal ulcer.&lt;ref name="v536"/&gt; In 1945, he was removed from his house, detained and taken to police headquarters. Hospitalized following a hemorrhage, he remained under medical care until his trial.&lt;ref name="v536"/&gt; This took place in May of the following year, when Brăileanu and Antonescu were among the 24 politicians brought before [[Romanian People's Tribunals]], collectively charged with "bringing disaster upon the country".&lt;ref&gt;[[Dennis Deletant]], ''Hitler's Forgotten Ally: Ion Antonescu and His Regime, Romania, 1940–1944''. [[Palgrave Macmillan]], London, 2006, {{ISBN|1-4039-9341-6}}, pp. 250, 347–348. See also Cesereanu, pp. 75–77; Trebici, p. 388; Vintilă (2010), p. 536&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, the [[Romanian Communist Party|Communist Party]] organ, ''[[Scînteia]]'', described Brăileanu as "flushed out, disjointed, his baldness sowed with grey bristle hairs as on a worn-out brush, his mouth toothless, words emerging inconsistent, gelatinous".&lt;ref&gt;Cesereanu, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; As argued by political scientist [[Ruxandra Cesereanu]], such portrayals meant to induce the notion that Brăileanu was already dead to the world, a "living corpse".&lt;ref&gt;Cesereanu, pp. 76–77&lt;/ref&gt;

Brăileanu was sentenced to twenty years' imprisonment; another official jailed at the same trial was [[Ion Petrovici]], a successor of his at the Education Ministry.&lt;ref name="t388"/&gt; First held at [[Văcărești prison]] before being moved to [[Aiud prison]],&lt;ref name="v536"/&gt; Brăileanu continued working on translations of Aristotle, as well as on a memoir covering the early part of his life.&lt;ref&gt;Trebici, pp. 386, 388&lt;/ref&gt; In 1947, he developed a severe ulcer and, gravely ill, was taken to the [[Brașov]] prison hospital. In June, a committee of doctors decided he did not require a hospital stay, and he was returned to Aiud.&lt;ref name="v536"/&gt; He died there, most likely on October 3.&lt;ref name="ln(10)473"/&gt; Shortly before, the prison doctor had refused to send him for an operation, and he was not allowed to access a package his relatives had sent.&lt;ref&gt;Vintilă (2010), pp. 536–537&lt;/ref&gt; His family managed to bring the body to Bucharest, where he was buried at an Orthodox ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;Trebici, p. 388; Vintilă (2010), p. 536&lt;/ref&gt; Others who occupy the same gravesite include his wife, who lived until 1972, and his father.&lt;ref name="t388"/&gt;

Publication and analysis of his works was entirely suppressed under the [[Communist Romania|communist regime]] that followed his death.&lt;ref&gt;Larionescu, p. 389; Trebici, p. 388&lt;/ref&gt; Some exceptions were made under the [[National communism in Romania|national communism]] of the 1980s, when Mihu Achim recovered him as a reference for "national sociology".&lt;ref&gt;Larionescu, pp. 389, 396&lt;/ref&gt; By 1990, following the anticommunist [[Romanian Revolution of 1989|Romanian Revolution]], Brăileanu's works were again the object of public scrutiny. Controversially, sociologist [[Dan Dungaciu]] published a piece honoring Brăileanu and his theory of the elites in a May 1993 issue of ''Mișcarea'', the [[neo-fascist]] newspaper.&lt;ref&gt;[[George Voicu]], "Teme antisemite în discursul public", in ''[[Sfera Politicii]]'', Nr. 82/2000, pp. 49, 55&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, the [[Romanian Academy]]'s sociological institute held a session dedicated to Brăileanu.&lt;ref&gt;Trebici, p. 383&lt;/ref&gt; His ancestral home in Bilca was reopened as a local museum.&lt;ref&gt;Irina Oberländer-Târnoveanu, Aurelia Duțu (eds.), ''Muzee și colecții din România''. [[cIMeC - Institutul de Memorie Culturală|cIMeC]], Bucharest, 2009, {{ISBN|978-973-7930-24-8}}, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;

Brăileanu's one daughter was married to his assistant Leon Țopa (1912–1996).&lt;ref&gt;Nastasă (2007), p. 162; (2010), p. 330&lt;/ref&gt; Late in his life, Țopa was interviewed by Dungaciu, arguing that Brăileanu should be understood as a sociologist, beyond his political commitments.&lt;ref&gt;Vintilă (2010), p. 537&lt;/ref&gt; Brăileanu's nephew Virgil Procopovici survived both his jailing under Antonescu and a renewed communist imprisonment from 1948, and, in 1999, reemerged as a legatee of the Iron Guard, republishing Guardist literature that he had kept hidden for the previous 50 years.&lt;ref name="ln(10)473"/&gt;

'''Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation''' ('''TENS''' or '''TNS''') is the use of electric current produced by a device to stimulate the nerves for therapeutic purposes. TENS, by definition, covers the complete range of transcutaneously applied currents used for nerve excitation although the term is often used with a more restrictive intent, namely to describe the kind of pulses produced by portable stimulators used to treat pain.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Robertson|Robertson]]{{pn|date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The unit is usually connected to the skin using two or more electrodes. A typical battery-operated TENS unit is able to modulate pulse width, frequency and intensity.  Generally TENS is applied at high frequency (&gt;50&amp;nbsp;[[Hz]]) with an intensity below motor contraction (sensory intensity) or low frequency (&lt;10&amp;nbsp;Hz) with an intensity that produces motor contraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| edition = Third| publisher = Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins| isbn = 0781744849| last = Robinson| first = Andrew J|author2=Lynn Snyder-Mackler | title = Clinical Electrophysiology: Electrotherapy and Electrophysiologic Testing| date = 2007-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the use of TENS has proved effective in clinical studies, there is controversy over which conditions the device should be used to treat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=DeSantana JM, Walsh DM, Vance C, Rakel BA, Sluka KA | title = Effectiveness of Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation for Treatment of Hyperalgesia and Pain | journal = Curr Rheumatol Rep | volume = 10 | issue = 6 | pages = 492–499. | date = December 2008 | pmid = 19007541 | pmc = 2746624 | doi = 10.1007/s11926-008-0080-z }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical uses==

===Pain===
TENS devices available to the domestic market are used as a non-invasive nerve stimulation intended to reduce both acute and chronic [[pain]]. One review from 2007 felt that the evidence supports a benefit in chronic musculoskeletal pain&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Johnson M, Martinson M | title = Efficacy of electrical nerve stimulation for chronic musculoskeletal pain: A meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials | journal = Pain | volume = 130 | issue = 1–2 | pages = 157–165 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17383095 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1016/j.pain.2007.02.007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Results from a task force on neck pain in 2008 found no clinically significant benefit to TENS for the treatment of neck pain when compared to a placebo treatment. A 2010 review did not find evidence to support the use of TENS for chronic low back pain.&lt;ref name=Review2010&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dubinsky RM, Miyasaki J | title = Assessment: Efficacy of transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation in the treatment of pain in neurologic disorders (an evidence-based review): Report of the Therapeutics and Technology Assessment Subcommittee of the American Academy of Neurology | journal = Neurology | volume = 74 | issue = 2 | pages = 173–176 | year = 2009 | pmid = 20042705 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1212/WNL.0b013e3181c918fc }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Khadilkar A, Odebiyi DO, Brosseau L, Wells GA | title = Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) versus placebo for chronic low-back pain | journal = The Cochrane Library | issue = 4 | pages = CD003008 | year = 2008 | pmid = 18843638 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD003008.pub3 | editor1-last = Brosseau | editor1-first = Lucie }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is tentative evidence that it may be useful for painful [[diabetic neuropathy]].&lt;ref name=Review2010/&gt; As of 2015, the efficacy of TENS therapy for [[phantom limb pain]] is not known as no [[randomized controlled trial]]s have been performed.&lt;ref name=CochranePhantomPain&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Johnson MI, Mulvey MR, Bagnall AM |title=Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) for phantom pain and stump pain following amputation in adults|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=8|issue=|pages=CD007264|date=August 2015|pmid=26284511|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD007264.pub3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In principle, an adequate intensity of stimulation is necessary to achieve pain relief with TENS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bjordal JM, Johnson MI, Ljunggreen AE | title = Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) can reduce postoperative analgesic consumption. A meta-analysis with assessment of optimal treatment parameters for postoperative pain | journal = European Journal of Pain | volume = 7 | issue = 2 | pages = 181–188 | year = 2003 | pmid = 12600800 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1016/S1090-3801(02)00098-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rakel B, Frantz R | title = Effectiveness of transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation on postoperative pain with movement | journal = The Journal of Pain | volume = 4 | issue = 8 | pages = 455–464 | year = 2003 | pmid = 14622666 | doi = 10.1067/S1526-5900(03)00780-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An analysis of treatment fidelity (meaning that the delivery of TENS in a trial was in accordance with current clinical advice, such as using "a strong but comfortable sensation" and suitable, frequent treatment durations) showed that higher fidelity trials tended to have a positive outcome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bennett MI, Hughes N, Johnson MI | title = Methodological quality in randomised controlled trials of transcutaneous electric nerve stimulation for pain: Low fidelity may explain negative findings | journal = Pain | volume = 152 | issue = 6 | pages = 1226–1232 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21435786 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1016/j.pain.2010.12.009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A few studies have shown objective evidence that TENS may modulate or suppress pain signals in the brain. One used [[Evoked potential|evoked cortical potentials]] to show that electric stimulation of peripheral A-beta sensory fibers reliably suppressed A-delta fiber [[nociceptive]] processing.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ellrich J, Lamp S | title = Peripheral Nerve Stimulation Inhibits Nociceptive Processing: An Electrophysiological Study in Healthy Volunteers | journal = [[Neuromodulation: Technology at the Neural Interface]] | volume = 8 | issue = 4 | pages = 225–232 | year = 2005 | pmid = 22151549 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1111/j.1525-1403.2005.00029.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two other studies used [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI): one showed that high-frequency TENS produced a decrease in pain-related cortical activations in patients with carpal tunnel syndrome,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kara M, Ozçakar L, Gökçay D, Ozçelik E, Yörübulut M, Güneri S, Kaymak B, Akinci A, Cetin A | title = Quantification of the Effects of Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation with Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging: A Double-Blind Randomized Placebo-Controlled Study | journal = Archives of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation | volume = 91 | issue = 8 | pages = 1160–1165 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20684895 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1016/j.apmr.2010.04.023 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while the other showed that low-frequency TENS decreased shoulder impingement pain and modulated pain-induced activation in the brain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kocyigit F, Akalin E, Gezer NS, Orbay O, Kocyigit A, Ada E | title = Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Effects of Low-frequency Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation on Central Pain Modulation | journal = The Clinical Journal oF Pain | volume = 28 | issue = 7 | pages = 581–588 | year = 2012 | pmid = 22699130 | pmc =  | doi = 10.1097/AJP.0b013e31823c2bd7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A head-mounted TENS device called Cefaly was approved by the United States [[Food and Drug Administration]], on March 11, 2014, for the [[prevention of migraines]]. The Cefaly device was found effective in preventing migraine attacks in a randomized sham-controlled trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Schoenen J, Vandersmissen B, Jeangette S, Herroelen L, Vandenheede M, Gérard P, Magis D | date = Feb 2013 | title = Migraine prevention with a supraorbital transcutaneous stimulator: a randomized controlled trial | url = | journal = Neurology | volume = 80 | issue = 8| pages = 697–704 | doi = 10.1212/WNL.0b013e3182825055 | pmid=23390177}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first TENS device which the FDA approved for pain prevention, as opposed to pain suppression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/newsevents/newsroom/pressannouncements/ucm388765.htm|title=FDA allows marketing of first medical device to prevent migraine headaches|work=fda.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study performed on healthy human subjects demonstrates that repeated application of TENS can create analgesic tolerance and reduce its efficacy.&lt;ref name="Liebano Rakel Vance Walsh 2011 pp. 335–342"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Liebano | first=Richard E. | last2=Rakel | first2=Barbara | last3=Vance | first3=Carol G.T. | last4=Walsh | first4=Deirdre M. | last5=Sluka | first5=Kathleen A. | title=An investigation of the development of analgesic tolerance to TENS in humans | journal=Pain | publisher=Ovid Technologies (Wolters Kluwer Health) | volume=152 | issue=2 | year=2011 | issn=0304-3959 | doi=10.1016/j.pain.2010.10.040 | pages=335–342}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Labor pain===
Studies have stated that TENS "has been shown not to be effective in postoperative and labour pain."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=McQuay HJ, Moore RA, Eccleston C, Morley S, Williams AC | title = Systematic review of outpatient services for chronic pain control | journal = Health Technology Assessment | volume = 1 | issue = 6 | pages = i-iv, 1–135 | date = July 1997 | pmid = 9483161 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=van der Spank JT, Cambier DC, De Paepe HM, Danneels LA, Witvrouw EE, Beerens L | title = Pain relief in labour by transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) | journal = Archives of gynecology and obstetrics | volume = 264 | issue = 3 | pages = 131–136 | year = 2000 | pmid = 11129512 | doi = 10.1007/s004040000099 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dentistry ===
TENS has been extensively used in non-odontogenic orofacial pain relief.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The effects of ULF-TENS stimulation on gnathology: the state of the art|journal = Cranio: The Journal of Craniomandibular Practice|date = 2014-04-01|issn = 0886-9634|pmid = 24839723|pages = 118–130|volume = 32|issue = 2|doi = 10.1179/0886963413Z.00000000018|first = Nicolae|last = Chipaila|first2 = Fabrizio|last2 = Sgolastra|first3 = Alessandro|last3 = Spadaro|first4 = Davide|last4 = Pietropaoli|first5 = Chiara|last5 = Masci|first6 = Ruggero|last6 = Cattaneo|first7 = Annalisa|last7 = Monaco}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, TENS and ultra low frequency-TENS (ULF-TENS) are commonly employed in diagnosis and treatment of [[temporomandibular joint dysfunction]] (TMD).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Further [[Clinical trial|clinical studies]] are required to determine its efficacy.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==History==
Electrical stimulation for pain control was used in [[ancient Rome]], 63 A.D. It was reported by [[Scribonius Largus]] that pain was relieved by standing on an electrical fish at the seashore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Jensen JE, Conn RR, Hazelrigg G, Hewett JE | title = The use of transcutaneous neural stimulation and isokinetic testing in arthroscopic knee surgery | journal = The American Journal of Sports Medicine | volume = 13 | issue = 1 | pages = 27–33 | year = 1985 | pmid = 3872082 | doi = 10.1177/036354658501300105 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 16th through the 18th century various [[electrostatic]] devices were used for headache and other pains. [[Benjamin Franklin]] was a proponent of this method for pain relief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation for pain relief|url=http://www.medicinenet.com/transcutaneous_electrical_nerve_stimulation/article.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 19th century a device called the electreat, along with numerous other devices were used for pain control and cancer cures. Only the electreat survived into the 20th century, but was not portable, and had limited control of the stimulus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is TENS-Therapy?|url=http://www.biocenter24.com/What-is-TENS-Therapy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Development of modern TENS unit is generally credited to [[C. Norman Shealy]].{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

===Modern===
The first modern, patient-wearable TENS was patented in the United States in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;Maurer, D "Transcutaneous stimulator and stimulation method" {{US patent|3817254}}, Publication date June 18, 1974&lt;/ref&gt; It was initially used for testing the tolerance of [[chronic pain]] patients to electrical stimulation before [[spinal Cord Stimulator|implantation of electrodes in the spinal cord dorsal column]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Burton C | title = Instrumentation for dorsal column stimulator implantation | journal = Surgical neurology | volume = 2 | issue = 1 | pages = 39–40 | year = 1974 | pmid = 4810453 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The electrodes were attached to an implanted receiver, which received its power from an antenna worn on the surface of the skin. Although intended only for testing tolerance to electrical stimulation, many of the patients said they received so much relief from the TENS itself that they never returned for the implant.

A number of companies began manufacturing TENS units after the commercial success of the [[Medtronic]] device became known. The neurological division of Medtronic, founded by Don Maurer, Ed Schuck and Charles Ray, developed a number of applications for implanted electrical stimulation devices for treatment of epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, and other disorders of the nervous system.

Today many people confuse TENS with [[electrical muscle stimulation]] (EMS). EMS and TENS devices look similar, with both using long electric lead wires and electrodes. TENS is for blocking pain, where EMS is for stimulating muscles.

== Research ==
As reported, TENS has different effects on the brain.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A recent [[Randomized controlled trial|RCT]] shown that sensory [[Ultra low frequency|ULF]]-TENS applied on the skin proximally to [[trigeminal nerve]], reduced the effect of acute mental stress assessed by [[heart rate variability]] (HRV).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Monaco|first=Annalisa|last2=Cattaneo|first2=Ruggero|last3=Ortu|first3=Eleonora|last4=Constantinescu|first4=Marian Vladimir|last5=Pietropaoli|first5=Davide|date=2017-05-01|title=Sensory trigeminal ULF-TENS stimulation reduces HRV response to experimentally induced arithmetic stress: A randomized clinical trial|journal=Physiology &amp; Behavior|volume=173|pages=209–215|doi=10.1016/j.physbeh.2017.02.014|issn=1873-507X|pmid=28213205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Safety==
There are several anatomical locations where TENS electrodes are [[Contraindication|contraindicated]]:
*Over the eyes due to the risk of increasing [[intraocular pressure]]&lt;ref name=safe/&gt;
*Transcerebrally&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Bracciano | first = AG | title = Physical Agent Modalities: Theory and Application for the Occupational Therapist | edition = 2 | publisher = SLACK Incorporated| year = 2008| isbn = 1556426496 | page = 232|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aOjp8mbRTn4C&amp;pg=PA232}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*On the front of the neck due to the risk of an acute [[hypotension]] (through a [[vasovagal response]]) or even a [[laryngospasm]]&lt;ref name=safe/&gt;&lt;ref name=val159/&gt;
*Through the chest using an anterior and posterior electrode positions,&lt;ref name=safe/&gt; or other transthoracic applications understood as "across a thoracic diameter"; this does not preclude coplanar applications&lt;ref name=val159/&gt;
*Internally, except for specific applications of dental, vaginal, and anal stimulation that employ specialized TENS units&lt;ref name=safe/&gt;
*On broken skin areas or wounds, although it can be placed around wounds&lt;ref name=safe&gt;[[#Watson|Watson]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=1IPj7rYI2u0C&amp;pg=PA266 p. 266]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Over a [[tumor]]/[[malignancy]] (based on [[in vitro]] experiments where electricity promotes cell growth)&lt;ref name=safe/&gt;&lt;ref name=val159/&gt;
* Directly over the spinal column

TENS used across an artificial [[Artificial pacemaker|cardiac pacemaker]] (or other indwelling stimulator, including across its leads) may cause interference and failure of the implanted device. Serious accidents have been recorded in cases when this principle was not observed. A 2009 review in this area suggests that electrotherapy, including TENS, "are best avoided" in patients with pacemakers or [[implantable cardioverter-defibrillator]]s (ICDs). They add that "there is no consensus and it may be possible to safely deliver these modalities in a proper setting with device and patient monitoring", and recommend further research. The review found several reports of ICDs administering inappropriate treatment due to interference with TENS devices, but notes that the reports on pacemakers are mixed: some non-programmable pacemakers were inhibited by TENS, but others were unaffected or auto-reprogrammed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Digby GC, Daubney ME, Baggs J, Campbell D, Simpson CS, Redfearn DP, Brennan FJ, Abdollah H, Baranchuk A | title = Physiotherapy and cardiac rhythm devices: a review of the current scope of practice | journal = Europace | volume = 11 | issue = 7 | pages = 850–859 | year = 2009 | pmid = 19411677 | doi = 10.1093/europace/eup102 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of TENS is likely to be less effective on areas of numb skin/decreased sensation due to nerve damage. It may also cause skin irritation due to the inability to feel currents until they are too high.&lt;ref name=safe/&gt; There's an unknown level of risk when placing electrodes over an [[infection]] (possible spreading due to muscle contractions), but cross contamination with the electrodes themselves is of greater concern.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Robertson|Robertson]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=XBUEfp5ZfcgC&amp;pg=PA160 p. 160]&lt;/ref&gt; TENS should also be used with caution in people with epilepsy or pregnant women; do not use over area of the uterus as the effects of electrical stimulation over the developing fetus are not known.&lt;ref name=val159&gt;[[#Robertson|Robertson]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=XBUEfp5ZfcgC&amp;pg=PA159 p. 159]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Watson|Watson]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=1IPj7rYI2u0C&amp;pg=PA265 p. 265]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''USS ''Grayling'' (SS-209)''', a [[Tambor-class submarine|''Tambor''-class]] [[submarine]], was the fourth ship of the [[United States Navy]] to be named for the [[Arctic grayling|grayling]].

Her keel was laid down at the [[Portsmouth Navy Yard]] in [[Kittery, Maine]] on 15 December 1939. She was [[ship naming and launching|launched]] on 4 September 1940 sponsored by Mrs. Marion Barnes Bryant Leary wife of Rear Admiral [[Herbert F. Leary]], and [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 1 March 1941 with Lieutenant Commander Eliot Olsen in command.

==Pre-World War II==

After conducting tests and sea trials, she was called upon 20 June 1941 to assist in the search for submarine [[USS O-9 (SS-70)|''O-9'' (SS-70)]], which had failed to surface after a practice dive off [[Isles of Shoals]]. ''O-9'' was subsequently discovered on the bottom, but rescue efforts failed; ''Grayling'' participated 22 June in the memorial services for those lost.

Joining the [[U.S. Atlantic Fleet|Atlantic Fleet]], ''Grayling'' sailed on shakedown cruise on 4 August to [[Morehead City, North Carolina]], and [[Saint Thomas, United States Virgin Islands|St. Thomas]], [[U.S. Virgin Islands]], returning to [[Portsmouth Naval Shipyard|Portsmouth]] on 29 August. After final acceptance, she departed 17 November, armed at [[Newport, Rhode Island]], and sailed for duty with the Pacific Fleet. ''Grayling'' transited the [[Panama Canal]] on 3 December and moored at [[San Diego, California]], on 10 December.

==Start of War, and Raising of Nimitz's Flag==

''Grayling'' sailed for [[Pearl Harbor]] on 17 December, arrived 24 December, and had the honor of being chosen for the Pacific Fleet change of command ceremony on 31 December 1941. The ceremony would normally have taken place on a battleship, but all the fleets battleships had been either sunk or damaged during the attack 3 weeks earlier. On that day, Admiral [[Chester Nimitz]] hoisted his flag aboard ''Grayling'' as Commander, [[U.S. Pacific Fleet|Pacific Fleet]] and began the [[United States Navy]]'s long fighting road back in the Pacific.

==COMSUBPAC Patrols, 1942==

After the ceremonies, ''Grayling'' stood out of [[Pearl Harbor]] on her first war patrol 5 January 1942. Cruising the Northern [[Gilbert Islands]], ''Grayling'' failed to register a kill, but gained much in training and readiness, returning to [[Pearl Harbor]] on 7 March.

Her second patrol, beginning 27 March, was more successful. Cruising off the coast of [[Japan]] itself, ''Grayling'' sank her first ship 13 April, sending the cargo freighter ''Ryujin Maru'' to the bottom. She returned to [[Hawaii]] on 16 May.

''Grayling'' returned to action in June as all available ships were pressed into service to oppose the Japanese advance on [[Midway Island]]. As part of Task Group 7.1, ''Grayling'' and her sister submarines were arranged in a fan-like reconnaissance deployment west of Midway, helping to provide knowledge of Japanese movements. During this deployment the ''Grayling'' was mistaken for a Japanese cruiser by Army Air Force B-17s which attacked her. A quick crash dive avoided damage.

As Naval planners established a submarine blockade of [[Chuuk Lagoon|Truk]] in connection with the offensive in the [[Solomon Islands]], ''Grayling'' began her third war patrol 14 July 1942 around the Japanese stronghold. She damaged a Japanese submarine tender 13 August, but was forced to return to [[Pearl Harbor]] 26 August by fuel leaks.

At [[Pearl Harbor]], ''Grayling'' repaired and was fitted with surface [[radar]], after which she began her fourth patrol on 19 October. Although attacked by gunfire and six separate [[depth charge]] runs by Japanese destroyers, ''Grayling'' succeeded 10 November in sinking a 4000-ton cargo ship southwest of [[Chuuk Lagoon|Truk]]. She also destroyed an enemy [[schooner]] on 4 December before putting into [[Fremantle submarine base]], [[Western Australia]], 13 December.

==Deployment to Australia, 1943==

Changing her base of operations to [[Australia]], ''Grayling'' stood out of [[Fremantle, Western Australia|Fremantle]] on 7 January 1943 on her fifth patrol, this time in Philippine waters. She sank cargo ship ''Ushio Maru'' west of [[Luzon]] on 26 January and damaged another Japanese ship the next day. After sinking a [[schooner]] on 24 February, ''Grayling'' returned to Fremantle.

''Grayling'' left [[Australia]]n waters on 18 March on her sixth war patrol and cruised in the [[Tarakan Island|Tarakan]] area and the [[Verde Island Passage]]. There, she attacked and sank cargo ship ''Shanghai Maru'' on 9 April and damaged four other ships before returning to [[Fremantle, Western Australia|Fremantle]] on 25 April.

Her seventh war patrol, commencing 18 May, took ''Grayling'' into the waters off northwest [[Borneo]], where she damaged a freighter and two smaller ships before returning to her base 6 July.

==Loss==

Under the command of Lt. Cdr. Robert M. Brinker, ''Grayling'' began her eighth and last war patrol in July, 1943,  from [[Fremantle, Western Australia|Fremantle]]. She made two visits to the coast of the [[Philippines]], delivering supplies and equipment to guerrillas at [[Pucio Point]], [[Pandan Bay]], [[Panay]], 31 July and 23 August 1943. Cruising in the Philippines area, ''Grayling'' recorded her last kill, the passenger-cargo ''Meizan Maru'' on 27 August in the [[Tablas Strait]], but was not heard from again after 9 September. She was scheduled to make a radio report on 12 September, which she did not, and all attempts to contact her failed. ''Grayling'' was officially reported "lost with all hands" 30 September 1943.

On 27 August 1943, Japanese ships witnessed a torpedo attack, and the next day a surfaced [[submarine]] was seen, both in the [[Tablas Strait]] area, and then on 9 September a surfaced American [[submarine]] was seen inside [[Lingayen Gulf]]. All of these sightings correspond with ''Grayling'''s orders to patrol the approaches to [[Manila]]. On 9 September 1943, Japanese passenger-cargo vessel ''Hokuan Maru'' reported a [[submarine]] in shallow water west of [[Luzon]]. The ship made a run over the area and “noted an impact with a submerged object.” No additional data are available.

Assuming she survived this incident, no other recorded Japanese attacks could have sunk ''Grayling''. Her loss may have been operational or by an unrecorded attack. The only certainty, therefore, is that ''Grayling'' was lost between 9 September and 12 September 1943 either in [[Lingayen Gulf]] or along the approaches to [[Manila]]. ComTaskFor71 requested a transmission from ''Grayling'' on 12 September, but did not receive one.

''Grayling'' was credited with five major kills, totaling 20,575&amp;nbsp;tons. All but the first of ''Grayling'''s eight war patrols were declared "successful". She received six [[battle stars]] for [[World War II]] service.

'''Initiative 1000''' (I-1000) of 2008 established the [[U.S. state]] of [[Washington (state)|Washington]]'s Death with Dignity Act ([[Revised Code of Washington|RCW]] 70.245&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news
|title=Chapter 70.245 RCW, The Washington death with dignity act
|url=http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?cite=70.245
|work=[[Washington State Legislature]]
}}&lt;/ref&gt;), which legalizes [[medical aid in dying]] with certain restrictions. Passage of this [[initiative]] made Washington the second U.S. state to permit some [[Terminal illness|terminally ill]] patients to determine the time of their own death. The effort was headed by former Governor [[Booth Gardner]].

The measure was approved in the November 4, 2008 general election. 1,715,219 votes (57.82%) were cast in favor, 1,251,255 votes during the united electorate (42.18%) against. There were 2,966,474 votes total.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; 30 of the state's 39 counties voted in favor of the initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vote.wa.gov/Elections/WEI/ResultsByCounty.aspx?ElectionID=26&amp;RaceID=101369&amp;CountyCode=%20&amp;JurisdictionTypeID=-2&amp;RaceTypeCode=M&amp;ViewMode=Results |title= November 4, 2008 General Election  |accessdate=2009-03-17 |publisher=[[Secretary of State of Washington]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, the similar [[initiative]] 119 was rejected by Washington [[voters]] by a margin of 54 percent to 46 percent. I-119 would have allowed doctors to prescribe a [[Death|lethal]] dosage of medication, and also to administer it if the terminally ill patient could not self-administer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Unlike that initiative, I-1000 requires the patient to ingest the medication unassisted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The initiative is based on [[Oregon Ballot Measure 16 (1994)|Oregon Measure 16]], which [[Oregon]] voters passed in 1994 but was not implemented until 1997.  At that time, Oregon was the only other state to have enacted similar legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oregon.gov/DHS/ph/pas/ |title=State of Oregon web site: Death with Dignity Act}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, Vermont became the third state to enact similar legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deathwithdignity.org/category/vermont}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, California became the fourth state to enact similar legislation. All states on the west coast now have similar legislation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacbee.com/news/local/health-and-medicine/article82660497.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Specific provisions in the initiative==
The official ballot summary for the measure, slightly amended following a February 2008 court challenge, is, "This measure would permit [[terminally ill]], [[Competence (law)|competent]], adult Washington residents medically predicted to die within six months to request and self-administer lethal medication prescribed by a physician. The measure requires two oral and one written request, two physicians to diagnose the patient and determine the patient is competent, a waiting period, and physician verification of an informed patient decision. Physicians, patients and others acting in good faith compliance would have criminal and civil immunity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Initiative Measure 1000 "The Washington Death with Dignity Act"
|date=2008-01-24 |url=http://www.secstate.wa.gov/elections/initiatives/text/i1000.pdf |work=[[Secretary of State of Washington]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Provisions in the law include:

* The patient must be an adult (18 or over) [[Residency (domicile)|resident]] of the state of Washington
* The patient must be mentally competent, verified by two physicians (or referred to a mental health evaluation)
* The patient must be terminally ill with less than 6 months to live, verified by two physicians. 
* The patient must make voluntary requests, without [[coercion]], verified by two physicians
* The patient must be informed of all other options including [[palliative]] and hospice care
* There is a 15-day waiting period between the first oral request and a written request
* There is a 48-hour waiting period between the written request and the writing of the prescription 
* The written request must be signed by two independent witnesses, at least one of whom is not related to the patient or employed by the health care facility
* The patient is encouraged to discuss with family (not required because of confidentiality laws)
* The patient may change their mind at any time and rescind the request
* The attending physician may sign the patient's death certificate which must list the underlying terminal disease as the cause of death

==Supporters==

The campaign was run by a coalition that includes former Washington governor, [[Booth Gardner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The name of the official political advocacy group working on the campaign was changed from "It's My Decision" to "YES on 1000".

State Senator [[Darlene Fairley]], who chairs the Death with Dignity Disabilities Caucus, said that "as a matter of personal control and autonomy, it makes sense to let patients themselves decide what kind of medical care they want to receive and how long they want to suffer with a terminal illness."

State Representative [[Jamie Pedersen]], chair of LGBT for 1000, said, "people facing terminal illnesses gain peace of mind from knowing that their end-of-life choices will be respected. Everyone deserves that respect and can appreciate its importance." Organizations that supported I-1000 include the [[American Medical Student Association]], the American Medical Women's Association, the Lifelong AIDS Association, the [[ACLU]], the National Women's Law Center, the Washington Chapter of the [[National Association of Social Workers]], and the Washington State Public Health Association.

The Washington State Psychology Association was [[Neutrality (philosophy)|neutral]] on I-1000, but found that "patients choose aid in dying because of a desire for [[autonomy]] and the wish to avoid loss of [[dignity]] and control, not because of a poor mental state, lack of resources or social support," and "the law has had a positive effect in terms of significant improvements in palliative care."

The ''Newcastle News'' endorsed the measure in an October 7, 2008, editorial. "Some opponents of I-1000 will refer to the life-death option as assisted suicide, but this has no resemblance to suicide. It is a humane end to a life that is already ending," the editorial said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Opposition==

'''The Coalition Against Assisted Suicide''' opposed the measure. It included doctors and nurses, disability rights advocates and organizations, [[hospice]] workers, [[minorities]], [[right-to-life]] organizations, the [[Catholic Church]] and other [[Christian]] organizations, and politicians.{{who|date=August 2013}}

The organization held that the danger of making doctors the agents of a patient's death far outweighed any advantages to assisted suicide, or safeguards in the initiative's text. They felt that legalization of assisted suicide would put pressure on minorities, the disabled, and the poor.
 
Actor [[Martin Sheen]] appeared in television ads opposing Initiative 1000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

'''[[Not Dead Yet]]''', a disabilities advocacy group which joined with the Coalition Against Assisted Suicide, objected to the measure, arguing that it discriminates against and targets the disabled.
