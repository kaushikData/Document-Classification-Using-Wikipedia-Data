'''''A Prairie Home Companion''''' is a 2006 American [[Ensemble cast|ensemble]] [[comedy film]] directed by [[Robert Altman]] and is his final film. The film is a fictional representation of behind-the-scenes activities at the long-running [[A Prairie Home Companion|public radio show of the same name]]. The film received mostly positive reviews and was a moderate box office success on its small budget.

The film features an [[ensemble cast]] including [[Meryl Streep]], [[Kevin Kline]], [[Tommy Lee Jones]], [[Woody Harrelson]], [[Lily Tomlin]], [[Garrison Keillor]], [[Virginia Madsen]], [[John C. Reilly]], and [[Lindsay Lohan]].

==Plot==
{{More plot|date=October 2015}}
A long-running live radio show is in danger of being canceled by new owners of the company that holds both radio station "WLT" and the theater where the show is broadcast. The film takes place on the night of the show's last performance. The show has two visitors: an angel calling herself Asphodel ([[Virginia Madsen]]) comes to comfort the people who work on the show and to escort one of them to the afterlife, while "the Axeman" ([[Tommy Lee Jones]]), a representative of the new owners, arrives to judge whether the show should be canceled. He makes it clear that the show is not what he considers modern popular programming, and though he too is escorted by the angel, the show is shut down anyway. In an [[epilogue]] at the end of the film the former cast members are reunited at [[Mickey's Diner]]. Their conversation pauses as they are joined by Asphodel.

==Production notes==
{{refimprove section|date=December 2016}}
To receive insurance for the shoot, [[Robert Altman]] had to hire [[Paul Thomas Anderson]] as a "backup" director to observe filming at all times and be prepared to take over for Altman in case of his incapacity. Using the working title ''The Last Show'', [[principal photography]] for the film began on June 29, 2005, at the [[Fitzgerald Theater]] in [[St. Paul, Minnesota]] (the usual venue for the radio show). Filming ended on July 28, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;The film was the second major picture (after ''[[North Country (film)|North Country]]'', starring [[Charlize Theron]] and Harrelson) to be filmed in [[Minnesota]] in 2005.{{cn|date=December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indiewire.com/ots/2006/02/daily_dispatch_3.html Indie Wire] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060611214920/http://www.indiewire.com/ots/2006/02/daily_dispatch_3.html |date=June 11, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/07/27/AR2005072702372_pf.html|work=The Washington Post|first=Peter|last=Kaufman|title=Radio for the Eyes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/07/23/movies/MoviesFeatures/23prai.html?ex=1279771200&amp;en=3fa151765fc0ec7f&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss|work=The New York Times|first=David|last=Carr|title=Lake Wobegon Goes Hollywood (or Is It Vice Versa?), With a Pretty Good Cast|date=July 23, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Because the Fitzgerald is a rather small building, other stage theaters in the [[Minneapolis-St. Paul]] region had been considered as stand-ins, but in the end, the necessary film equipment was crammed into the structure.{{cn|date=December 2016}} The lack of space led to the basement also being used for some sets.{{cn|date=December 2016}} Set design had to make the show more visually interesting, and fake dressing rooms were used in the film.{{cn|date=December 2016}} The movie's production designer noted that Keillor's actual dressing room is "about the size of a very, very small bathroom."{{cite quote|date=December 2016}} 

[[Mickey's Diner]], a downtown St. Paul landmark, is also featured in the film.{{cn|date=December 2016}}

On November 1, 2005, the ''[[Star Tribune]]'' reported that an early screening in [[New York City]] for film distributors resulted in a heavy bidding war.{{full|date=December 2016}} [[Picturehouse (company)|Picturehouse]] bought the rights, and company president Bob Berney, "aiming to capitalize on the name recognition of the 31-year-old radio program, recommended that the title revert to ''A Prairie Home Companion''. 'At the screening, Garrison said that to broaden the film's appeal, they were thinking about changing the name to ''[[Savage Love]]'', so we may have an argument there,' Berney said."{{cite quote|date=December 2016}}

==Reception==

===Critics===
''A Prairie Home Companion'' opened the 2006 [[South by Southwest]] film festival on March 10, then premiered in [[St. Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]], on May 3, 2006, at the [[Fitzgerald Theater]], which had projection and sound equipment brought in for that purpose. The film's stars arrived in ten horse-drawn carriages. [[Brian Williams]] of ''[[NBC Nightly News]]'' anchored his newscast from neighboring [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]], that night so that he would be able to attend.

Critics' general reaction to the film was favorable, and it garnered an 82% fresh rating at [[Rotten Tomatoes]]. [[Roger Ebert]] awarded the film four out of four stars, saying, "What a lovely film this is, so gentle and whimsical, so simple and profound",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060608/REVIEWS/60606001|work=Chicago Sun-Times|title=A Prairie Home Companion | date=June 8, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later added the film to his "Great Movies" list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20081112/REVIEWS08/811129987/1004|work=Chicago Sun-Times|title=A Prairie Home Companion (2006) | date=November 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael Medved]] (himself a radio host) gave the film one and a half stars out of four, saying, "The entertainment value stands somewhere between thin and nonexistent" and "[it may be] the worst movie ever made that pooled the talents of four (count ‘em – four!) Oscar winners".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.michaelmedved.com/pg/jsp/eot/home.jsp Michael Medved's Movie Minute] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080311114306/http://www.michaelmedved.com/pg/jsp/eot/home.jsp |date=2008-03-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Desson Thomson]] from ''[[The Washington Post]]'' fell in between, saying in a review headlined "Honey, You Could Ask for More" (a reference to the theme song of the radio show and film) that while the movie had its strengths, it was weaker than it should have been.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/08/AR2006060801841.html|work=The Washington Post|first=Desson|last=Thomson|title=Honey, You Could Ask for More|date=June 9, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Awards===

=== Box office ===

The '''Amman Citadel Inscription''' is the oldest known inscription in the so-called [[Ammonite language]]. It was discovered in 1961 in the [[Amman Citadel]], and first published in full in 1968 by [[Siegfried Horn]].&lt;ref&gt;Horn, p2&lt;/ref&gt;  The inscription is now in the [[Jordan Archaeological Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;Horn, p2&lt;/ref&gt; It is the third longest Semitic stone inscription ever found, after the [[Mesha Stele]] and the [[Siloam inscription]].&lt;ref&gt;Horn, p2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The inscription is carved into a white [[limestone]] block of approximately 26 × 19 cm (10′ × 7½′) in size, with parts of the inscription lost. Most letters are clearly visible, and the stone has few traces of [[erosion]] and was therefore probably not exposed to the elements.

The inscription contains eight lines. The left and right sides of the inscription are missing parts, and the bottom line does not seem to include the end of the inscription. The top line is thought to be the beginning of the inscription since there is space above it.

In the eight lines, 93 letters are shown, which are interpreted to be spread between about 33 words.&lt;ref&gt;Horn, p2-3&lt;/ref&gt; The size and shape of individual letters vary considerably, suggesting that the inscription comes from a novice scribe. Numerous letters have unusual shapes, for example the [[heth|''ḥēt'']] has only two cross beams, compared to the usual three (𐤇), similar to the [[Mesha stele]]. The [[teth|''ṭēt'']] is only a crossbar in a circle (instead of the usual 𐤈), and the [[ayin|''ʿayin'']] is already slightly open upwards (𐡏 instead of 𐤏), which occurs in Phoenician inscriptions only from the 5th century.

It is understood to be a building inscription, although due to the fragmented nature of the inscription, the translation remains uncertain.

'''Autofiction''' is a term used in [[literary criticism]] to refer to a form of fictionalized [[autobiography]].

[[Serge Doubrovsky]] coined the term in 1977 with reference to his novel ''Fils''. [[Philippe Vilain]] distinguishes autofiction from [[autobiographical novel]]s in that autofiction requires a [[first-person narrative]] by a [[protagonist]] who has the same name as the author.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Vilain |first1=Philippe |last2=Herman|first2=Jeanine |editor1=Villa Gillet |editor2=Le Monde |title=The Novelist's Lexicon: Writers on the Words That Define Their Work |doi=10.7312/vill15080.9 |jstor=10.7312/vill15080.9|year=2011|publisher=Columbia University Press|pages=5–7|chapter=AUTOFICTION|isbn=0231150806}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Autofiction combines two mutually inconsistent narrative forms, namely autobiography and fiction. An author may decide to recount his/her life in the third person, to modify significant details or 'characters', using fiction in the service of a search for self. It has parallels with [[Faction (literature)|faction]], a [[genre]] devised by [[Truman Capote]] to describe his [[novel]] ''[[In Cold Blood]]''.  

Autofiction is principally a genre associated with contemporary [[France|French]] authors, among them: [[Christine Angot]], [[Marguerite Duras]], [[Guillaume Dustan]], [[Alice Ferney]], [[Annie Ernaux]], [[Hervé Guibert]], [[Amélie Nothomb]], [[Olivia Rosenthal]], [[Anne Wiazemsky]], [[Édouard Louis]] and [[Vassilis Alexakis]]. [[Catherine Millet]]'s 2002 memoir ''[[The Sexual Life of Catherine M.]]'' famously used autofiction to explore  the author's sexual experiences.

In India, autofiction has been associated with the works of [[Hainsia Olindi]] and postmodern [[Tamil people|Tamil]] writer [[Charu Nivedita]]. His novel [[Zero degree]], a groundbreaking work in Tamil literature and his recent Novel ''Marginal Man'' are examples of this genre.&lt;ref&gt;[http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/news-by-industry/et-cetera/My-novel-was-treated-like-a-song-of-freedom-Charunivedita/articleshow/6944370.cms My novel was treated like a song of freedom: Economic Times Interview]&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese author [[Hitomi Kanehara]] wrote a novel titled ''[[Autofiction (novel)|Autofiction]]''.

In Indian Urdu fiction novels of Rahman Abbas considered major work of autofiction. Specially his two novels 'Nakhalistan Ki Talash' (Search of an Oasis) and 'Khuda Ke Saaye Mein Ankh Micholi' (Hide &amp; Seek in the Shadow of God).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youthkiawaaz.com/2015/11/urdu-writer-rahman-abbas/ Too ‘Obscene’ For Islamic Orthodoxy: An Urdu Writer’s Experience Of Writing His 1st Novel], YKA - Youth Ki Awaaz, 13 November 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Caldo galego''' or simply '''caldo''' (in [[Galician language|Galician]]), also known as '''caldo gallego''' (in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]), meaning literally '''Galician broth''', is a traditional soup dish from [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cooks.com/rec/search/0,1-0,caldo_gallego,FF.html|title=Caldo Gallego - Recipes |website=Cooks.com|accessdate=2 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is similar to [[caldo verde]], popular in neighboring [[Portugal]].

Ingredients include ''repolo'' ([[cabbage]]), ''verzas'' ([[collard greens]]), ''[[Rapini|grelos]]'', or ''navizas'' (sweet [[turnip]] greens); potatoes; [[white bean]]s; and ''unto'' (lard). Additionally it can contain fatty pork, ''[[chorizo]]'', ham, or bacon (''compango'').

It is served hot as a starter, often as part of ''xantar'' (lunch), and sometimes dinner. Traditionally it was usually served in ''cuncas'' (earthen bowls).

==Variations==
Depending on the availability of seasonal ingredients there are several variations:
*'''Caldo branco''' includes chickpeas and beans.
*'''Caldo chirlo''' or '''vigueiro'''
*'''Caldo de castañas''' uses [[chestnut]]s

The '''cognitive revolution''' was an intellectual movement that began in the 1950s as an interdisciplinary study of the mind and its processes, which became known collectively as  [[cognitive science]]. The relevant areas of interchange were between the fields of [[psychology]], [[anthropology]], and [[linguistics]] using approaches developed within the then-nascent fields of [[artificial intelligence]], [[computer science]], and [[neuroscience]]. A key goal of early [[cognitive psychology]] was to apply the [[scientific method]] to the study of human cognition by designing experiments that used computational models of artificial intelligence to systematically test theories about human mental processes in a controlled laboratory setting.&lt;ref name=Thagard&gt;{{cite web|last1=Thagard|first1=Paul|title=Cognitive Science|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/cognitive-science/|website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|accessdate=8 December 2017|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Five major ideas from the cognitive revolution==
In his book ''[[The Blank Slate]]'' (2002), psychologist [[Steven Pinker]] identified five key ideas that made up the cognitive revolution:&lt;ref name=Pinker-2003-31&gt;Pinker 2003, p.31&lt;/ref&gt;
#"The mental world can be grounded in the physical world by the concepts of information, computation, and feedback."&lt;ref name=Pinker-2003-31 /&gt;
#"The mind cannot be a [[blank slate]] because blank slates don't do anything."&lt;ref&gt;Pinker 2003, p.34&lt;/ref&gt;
#"An infinite range of behavior can be generated by finite combinatorial programs in the mind."&lt;ref&gt;Pinker 2003, p.36&lt;/ref&gt;
#"Universal mental mechanisms can underlie superficial variation across cultures."&lt;ref&gt;Pinker 2003, p.37&lt;/ref&gt;
#"The mind is a complex system composed of many interacting parts."&lt;ref&gt;Pinker 2003, p.39&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical background ==

=== Response to behaviorism ===

The cognitive revolution in psychology took form as [[cognitive psychology]], an approach in large part a response to [[behaviorism]], the predominant school in scientific psychology at the time. Behaviorism was heavily influenced by [[Ivan Pavlov]] and [[E. L. Thorndike]], and its most notable early practitioner was [[John B. Watson]], who proposed that psychology could only become an objective science were it based on observable behavior in test subjects. Methodological behaviorists argued that because mental events are not publicly observable, psychologists should avoid description of [[mental process]]es or the [[mind]] in their theories. However, [[B. F. Skinner]] and other radical behaviorists objected to this approach, arguing that a science of psychology must include the study of internal events.&lt;ref&gt;Mecca Chiesa: Radical Behaviorism: The Philosophy &amp; The Science&lt;/ref&gt; As such, behaviorists at this time did not reject cognition (private behaviors), but simply argued against the concept of the mind being used as an explanatory fiction (rather than rejecting the concept of mind itself).&lt;ref&gt;Skinner, B.F. Beyond  Freedom and Dignity. page 24 Hardback edition&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitive psychologists extended on this philosophy through the experimental investigation of mental states that allow scientists to produce theories that more reliably predict outcomes.

The traditional account of the "cognitive revolution", which posits a conflict between behaviorism and the study of mental events, was challenged by [[Jerome Bruner]] who characterized it as:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
...an all-out effort to establish [[Meaning (linguistic)|meaning]] as the central concept of psychology [...]. It was not a revolution against behaviorism with the aim of transforming behaviorism into a better way of pursuing psychology by adding a little mentalism to it. [...] Its aim was to discover and to describe formally the meanings that human beings created out of their encounters with the world, and then to propose hypotheses about what [[meaning-making]] processes were implicated. (Bruner, 1990, Acts of Meaning, p. 2)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It should be noted however that behaviorism was to a large extent restricted to North America and the cognitive reactions were in large part a reimportation of European psychologies. [[George Mandler]] has described that evolutionary history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mandler|first=George|title=Origins of the cognitive (r)evolution|journal=Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences|year=2002|volume=38|pages=339–353|doi=10.1002/jhbs.10066|pmid=12404267|issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==

Lachman, Lachman and Butterfield were among the first to imply that cognitive psychology has a revolutionary origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authors=Lachman, Roy, Lachman, Janet L. and Butterfield, Earl C.|year=1979|title=Cognitive Psychology and Information Processing: An Introduction|location=Hillsdale, NJ|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates}}&lt;/ref&gt; After this, proponents of information processing theory and later [[Cognitivism (psychology)|cognitivists]] believed that the rise of cognitivism constitutes a [[paradigm shift]]. Despite the belief, many have stated both unwittingly and wittingly that cognitive psychology links to behaviorism.

Leahey said that cognitive scientists believe in a revolution because it provides them with an origin myth which constitutes a beginning that will help in legitimizing their science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Leahey, T. H.|year=1992|title=The mythical revolutions of American psychology|journal=American Psychologist|volume=47|issue=2|pages=308–318|url=http://www.le.ac.uk/pc/jrb/Approach/Leahey92.pdf|doi=10.1037/0003-066X.47.2.308}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others have said that cognitivism is behaviorism with a new language, slightly bent model and new concerns which aim at description, prediction and control of behavior. The change from behaviorism to cognitivism was gradual. Rather a slowly evolving science which took the origins of behaviorism and built on it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Roediger, R. |year=2004|title= What happened to behaviorism|publisher=American Psychological Society, 17, Presidential Column|url=http://www.psychologicalscience.org/index.php/uncategorized/what-happened-to-behaviorism.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The evolution and building has not stopped, see [[Postcognitivism]].

{{Original research|date=October 2012}}

In [[social science]] generally and [[linguistics]] specifically, the '''cooperative principle''' describes how effective communication in [[conversation]] is achieved in common social situations, that is, how listeners and speakers must act cooperatively and mutually accept one another to be understood in a particular way. As phrased by [[Paul Grice]], who introduced it, "Make your contribution such as is required, at the stage at which it occurs, by the accepted purpose or direction of the talk exchange in which you are engaged."&lt;ref name="grice"&gt;{{cite book|last= Grice|first= Paul|year=1975|chapter=Logic and conversation |title=Syntax and semantics|volume=3: Speech acts |pages=41–58 |editor1-last=Cole|editor1-first=P.|editor2-last=Morgan |editor2-first=J. |publisher=Academic Press |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though phrased as a [[Linguistic prescription|prescriptive]] command, the principle is intended as a [[Linguistic description|description]] of how people normally behave in conversation. Jeffries and McIntyre describe Grice's maxims as "encapsulating the assumptions that we prototypically hold when we engage in conversation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jeffries|first1=Lesley|last2=McIntyre|first2=Daniel|title=Stylistics|date=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cooperative principle can be divided into four maxims, called the Gricean maxims, describing specific rational principles observed by people who obey the cooperative principle; these principles enable effective communication.&lt;ref name=Kordic&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kordić, Snježana |authorlink=Snježana Kordić |title=Konverzacijske implikature |trans-title=Conversational implicatures |url=http://bib.irb.hr/datoteka/446883.KONVERZACIJSKE_IMPLIKATURE.PDF |language=Serbo-Croatian |journal=Suvremena lingvistika |volume=17 |issue=31-32 |page=89 |year=1991 |issn=0586-0296 |oclc=440780341 |id={{ZDB|429609-6}} |archivedate=2 September 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6ANNqArFh?url=http://bib.irb.hr/datoteka/446883.KONVERZACIJSKE_IMPLIKATURE.PDF |accessdate=9 February 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Grice proposed four conversational maxims that arise from the [[pragmatics]] of natural [[language]].&lt;ref name=Kordic/&gt; Applying the Gricean maxims is a way to explain the link between utterances and what is understood from them.

==Obeying the cooperative principle==
{{cns|text=Those who obey the cooperative principle in their language use will make sure that what they say in a conversation furthers the purpose of that conversation.|date=January 2018}}

{{cns|text=The cooperative principle goes both ways: speakers observe the cooperative principle, and listeners assume that speakers are observing it. This allows for the possibility of ''[[implicature]]s'', which are meanings that are not explicitly conveyed in what is said, but that can nonetheless be inferred.|date=January 2018}}

==Grice's maxims==

===Maxim of quality===
====Supermaxim:====
* ''Try to make your contribution one that is true.''

==== Submaxims: ====
# Do not say what you believe to be false.
# Do not say that for which you lack adequate [[evidence]].&lt;ref&gt;For arguments that Grice's maxim is best understood in terms of knowledge, see {{cite journal |last1=Benton |first1=Matthew A. |title=Gricean Quality |journal=Nous |date=2016 |volume=50 |issue=4 |pages=689-703 |doi=10.1111/nous.12065 |url=https://doi.org/10.1111/nous.12065 |accessdate=10 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Maxim of quantity===
# Make your contribution as informative as is required (for the current purposes of the exchange).
# Do not make your contribution more informative than is required.

===Maxim of relation===
* ''Be relevant.''
With respect to this maxim, Grice writes, "Though the maxim itself is terse, its formulation conceals a number of problems that exercise me a good deal: questions about what different kinds and focuses of relevance there may be, how these shift in the course of a talk exchange, how to allow for the fact that subjects of conversations are legitimately changed, and so on. I find the treatment of such questions exceedingly difficult, and I hope to revert to them in later work."&lt;ref name="grice"/&gt;

===Maxim of manner===
====Supermaxim:====
* ''Be perspicuous.''

==== Submaxims: ====
# Avoid obscurity of expression.
# Avoid ambiguity.
# Be brief (avoid unnecessary [[Verbosity|prolixity]]).
# Be orderly.

==Explanation==
These maxims may also be understood as describing the assumptions listeners normally make about the way speakers will talk, rather than prescriptions for how one ought to talk. Philosopher [[Kent Bach]] writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...[W]e need first to get clear on the character of Grice's maxims. They are not sociological generalizations about speech, nor they are moral prescriptions or proscriptions on what to say or communicate. Although Grice presented them in the form of guidelines for how to communicate successfully, I think they are better construed as presumptions about utterances, presumptions that we as listeners rely on and as speakers exploit (Bach 2005).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Gricean maxims generate implicatures. If the overt, surface meaning of a sentence does not seem to be consistent with the Gricean maxims, and yet the circumstances lead us to think that the speaker is nonetheless obeying the cooperative principle, we tend to look for other meanings that could be implied by the sentence.

Grice did not, however, assume that all people should constantly follow these maxims. Instead, he found it interesting when these were not respected, namely either "flouted" (with the listener being expected to be able to understand the message) or "violated" (with the listener being expected to not note this). Flouting would imply some other, hidden meaning. The importance was in what was ''not'' said. For example, answering ''It's raining'' to someone who has suggested playing a game of tennis only disrespects the maxim of relation on the surface; the reasoning behind this "fragment" sentence is normally clear to the interlocutor (the maxim is just "flouted").

==Flouting the maxims==
It is possible to flout a maxim and thereby convey a different meaning than what is literally spoken.&lt;ref name="grice" /&gt; Many times in conversation, this flouting is manipulated by a speaker to produce a negative pragmatic effect, as with [[sarcasm]] or [[irony]]. One can flout the maxim of quality to tell a clumsy friend who has just taken a bad fall that her gracefulness is impressive and obviously intend to mean the complete opposite. Likewise, flouting the maxim of quantity may result in ironic understatement, the maxim of relevance in blame by irrelevant praise, and the maxim of manner in ironic ambiguity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kaufer|first=D. S.|year=1981|title=Understanding ironic communication|url=|journal=Journal of Pragmatics|volume=5|pages=495–510|doi=10.1016/0378-2166(81)90015-1|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Gricean maxims are therefore often purposefully flouted by [[comedian]]s and writers, who may hide the complete truth and manipulate their words for the effect of the story and the sake of the reader's experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/lexicon_valley/2014/06/20/at_least_ten_ducks_why_this_caption_is_funny_explained_by_gricean_maxims.html|title="Look At All These Ducks There Are At Least Ten." Why Is This Funny?|last1=McCulloch|first1=Gretchen|website=[[Slate (magazine)]]|publisher=[[The Slate Group]]|accessdate=20 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{citation needed span|text=Speakers who deliberately flout the maxims usually intend for their listener to understand their underlying implication. In the case of the clumsy friend, she will most likely understand that the speaker is not truly offering a compliment. Therefore, cooperation is still taking place, but no longer on the literal level. Conversationalists can assume that when speakers intentionally flout a maxim, they still do so with the aim of expressing some thought. Thus, the Gricean maxims serve a purpose both when they are followed and when they are flouted.|date=January 2018}}

==Criticism ==
Grice's theory is often disputed by arguing that cooperative conversation, like most social behaviour, is culturally determined, and therefore the Gricean maxims and the cooperative principle cannot be universally applied due to intercultural differences. Keenan claims that the [[Malagasy people|Malagasy]], for example, follow a completely opposite cooperative principle in order to achieve conversational cooperation. In their culture, speakers are reluctant to share information and flout the maxim of quantity by evading direct questions and replying on incomplete answers because of the risk of losing face by committing oneself to the truth of the information, as well as the fact that having information is a form of prestige.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Keenan |first=Elinor Ochs. |year=1976 |title=On the universality of conversational postulates |journal=Language in Society |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=67–80. |doi=10.1017/s0047404500006850}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Harnish points out&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Harnish |first=R. |year=1976 |chapter=Logical form and implicature |title=An Integrated Theory of Linguistic Ability |editor=Bever T G |editor2=Katz J J |editor3=Langendoen, D T |publisher=New York: Crowel.}}&lt;/ref&gt; that Grice only claims his maxims hold in conversations where his cooperative principle is in effect. The Malagasy speakers choose not to be cooperative, valuing the prestige of information ownership more highly. 
(It could also be said in this case that this is a less cooperative communication system, since less information is shared)

Another criticism is that the Gricean maxims can easily be misinterpreted to be a guideline for [[etiquette]], instructing speakers on how to be moral, polite conversationalists. However, the Gricean maxims, despite their wording, are only meant to describe the commonly accepted traits of successful cooperative communication. [[Geoffrey Leech]] introduced the [[politeness maxims]]: tact, [[generosity]], approbation, modesty, [[consensus|agreement]], and [[sympathy]].

{{Anthropology of religion}}
{{Medical anthropology}}
A '''dukun''' is a [[Malay language|Malay]] term for [[shaman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Graham Harvey|author2=Robert J. Wallis|title=Historical Dictionary of Shamanism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GQOyAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA129|date=5 February 2007|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-6459-7|pages=129–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their societal role is that of a [[traditional healer]], [[spirit medium]], custom and tradition experts and on occasion [[Magician (paranormal)|sorcerers]] and masters of [[black magic]]. In common usage the dukun is often confused with another type of shaman, the [[pawang]]. It is often mistranslated into English as "witch doctor" or "medicine man". Many self-styled dukun in Indonesia are simply scammers and criminals, preying on gullible and superstitious people who were raised to believe in the supernatural.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Yeung|first1=Kenneth|title=Something Wicked This Way Comes|url=http://indonesiaexpat.biz/featured/something-wicked-this-way-comes/|accessdate=17 September 2017|agency=Indonesia Expat|publisher=PT Koleksi Klasik Indonesia|date=23 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dukun is the very epitome of the [[kejawen]] or [[kebatinan]] belief system indigenous to [[Java]]. Very strong and ancient beliefs of [[animism]], [[ancestor worship]] and [[shamanism]] are held by the people of the [[Malay world|Nusantara]]. While medical doctors and revivalist Islam and Christianity have caused a decrease in the prominence of dukun, they remain highly respected and somewhat feared figures in Indo-Malay society, even in the most orthodox Muslim-dominant areas. In the pre-colonial past, dukun were exempt from paying taxes, as with [[Hindu]] priests and [[Buddhist]] monks.

Many highly prominent and highly educated Indonesians, Malaysians and Singaporeans, even those with Western doctorate and masters levels degrees will still consult dukun or soothsayers. Indonesians who are known to have employed dukun include former President [[Sukarno]], former president [[Suharto]], former president [[Megawati Sukarnoputri]], [[Hamengkubuwono IX|Sultan Hamengkubuwana IX]] and [[Hamengkubuwono X|Sultan Hamengkubuwana X]] and many more.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}}

Dukun are most common on the island of [[Java]], though the island of [[Madura]] is especially feared for being very powerful practitioners of dark magic, and [[Bali]] is well regarded for its dukun. The [[Dayak people]] of [[Kalimantan]] are also feared for their use of dukun when [[head-hunting]]. In [[Sabah]], the Kadayan community are known for their dukun who are said to look waif-like with red eyes.

In common practice, a dukun is consulted when a person perceives they have an issue that has a [[supernatural]] or [[paranormal]] association. If a dukun is not known to the individual, their family or friends, word of mouth often creates a situation where the dukun will appear as if summoned, most especially in the case of [[Spirit possession|possessions]].

==Becoming a dukun==
The dukun's knowledge is passed down orally, but the specific customs differ from one community to another. Initiates may voluntarily decide to learn the dukun's craft, or the position might be inherited. [[Proto-Malay]] dukun often serve the dual role of both shaman and village chief, known as a ''tok batin''. Dukun who inherited their knowledge from their parent or grandparent is held in higher esteem than one who served as another dukun's disciple. Typically the initiation ritual involves meditation at a mountain, waterfall, cemetery or some other location away from people. In some communities, such as the Kadayan of [[Sabah]], dukun are also required to learn [[silat]] before they can be initiated. The purpose is both for the purpose of self-defence and for the spiritual training.

==Range of roles==
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Een shamaan op Zuid-Boeroe bezweert boze geesten de kinderen te verlaten waarbij hij een geldstuk en een sirihnoot offert TMnr 10001031.jpg|thumb|Shaman exorcising evil spirits occupying children, [[Buru]], [[Indonesia]] (1920).]]

Dukun have a number of titles and ascribed abilities - the dukun roles below are sometimes taken up by dukuns with specific titles and roles, rather than any one dukun utilizing all of the roles below.

===Medicinal and curative===
The dukun's primary role is that of a healer. They may use herbalism, incantations (''jampi''), chants (''[[mantra]]''), animal parts, inanimate objects, [[spiritual communication]] or guidance, prayers, offerings, the [[keris]] or any combination to effect their curatives.

===Exorcism===
Dukun are believed to be able to communicate directly with malevolent and benevolent spirits. Spirits are said not to resist the dukun in their removal from their 'host', as they are enthralled that a living being can communicate with them.

===Divination and soothsaying===
Dukun are most famous for prophetic visions. This is often the result of consulting spirits relating to one’s deceased family who often provide insight into what is likely to happen.

===Charms and blessings===
Dukun will occasionally bless an individual or a business, to keep away termites or spirits or demons, or over a piece of land to ensure a good harvest.

===Spiritual communications===
Dukun are alleged to see normally invisible spirits and communicate as easily as though the spirit were physically present. Many spirits are supposed to speak archaic Javanese or Sundanese and the Dukun may be able to speak these languages during momentary spiritual possessions, despite not having prior knowledge of these languages.

===Sorcery===
Dukun are generally benevolent shamans. On occasion, some practitioners may be employed to cast revenge [[curse|hexes]] and [[incantations]].

Some known incantations include:

'''Jengges''': Offerings such as incense and opium are arranged in a half-circle, as are nails, glass and needles. The dukun then asks the spirits to embed the items in the victim’s stomach.

'''Gendam ''': The dukun chants the victim's name so that the target cannot rest until they are cured by another dukun.

'''Naruga''': The dukun implants an emotional suggestion in the victim. It may be benevolent such as a love spell, or malevolent- causing the target to murder someone else.

'''Santet''': The dukun causes the target to have chronic diarrhea. 

'''Sirep''': The dukun causes people to fall under a deep, unshakable slumber.

'''Tenung''': This ritual involves creating a half circle of food offerings, including opium and incense, while chanting for the destruction of the victim. The target suffers headaches, vomiting and illness until remedied by another dukun.

'''Susuk''': The dukun implants an enchanted metal needle into the patient's body. The dukun will use a spirit to implant the needle without leaving a wound. Originally a primitive form of skin-tightening, this procedure is supposed to make the patient more attractive. Mostly used by women, it could also be used for making a person less physically vulnerable

== Society, belief and violence ==
=== Fraud and assault ===
Many dukun have been jailed for fraud and sexual assault in Indonesia. Sometimes, dukun have been killed in revenge attacks or by people thinking bad luck was caused by a dukun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wargadiredja|first1=Arzia Tivany|title=Sex, Scandal, and Murder: Indonesia's Witchcraft Industry Rides Out a Tough Year|url=https://www.vice.com/en_id/article/zm3ejj/sex-scandal-and-murder-indonesias-witchcraft-industry-rides-out-a-tough-year|accessdate=17 September 2017|publisher=VICE|date=15 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1998 East Java ninja scare ===
{{See|1998 East Java ninja scare}}

The 1998 East Java ninja scare was an outbreak of [[mass hysteria]] in [[East Java]], [[Indonesia]], in which the local population believed they were being targeted by sorcerers known as ninja, who were blamed for mysterious killings of religious leaders by assassins dressed in black. As many as 150-300 “sorcerers” were killed between February and October, with the most deaths occurring between August and September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/20/world/fears-of-sorcerers-spur-killings-in-java.html|title=Fears of Sorcerers Spur Killings in Java|first=Nicholas D.|last=Kristof|date=20 October 1998|publisher=|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Education act of 1872''' removed state funding of non-government schools, and created a new Education Department to control government schools in what later became the [[State of Victoria]].

==Contemporary reporting==
On 17 December 1872 the Act went through the [[Parliament of Victoria|Parliament]]. The [[The Argus (Australia)|Argus]] reported the next day on the close of the Parliamentary session:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"...we must acknowledge that the (Parliamentary) session has been by no means a barren one. If the Education Act of 1872 had been the solitary law added to the Statute
book during its continuance, that alone would be sufficient to make it memorable in the annals of Victoria. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
When we consider the difficulties which attend all attempts to deal with the much vexed question of public instruction, the prejudices which have to be overcome, and the sectarian enmity which has to be encountered, we may well be grateful that the Government measure passed through the ordeal it had to undergo in both Houses without the sacrifice of any of those vital principles it was and is intended to establish.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
For the first time in this colony, the young will now have an opportunity of acquiring the rudiments of education unmixed with the leaven of sectarianism, and every child, no matter what its parents' circumstances may be, will receive at the hands of the state that key which, rightly used, unlocks whole stores of knowledge, from whose ample treasures the patient and industrious may freely help themselves. If due effect be given to the compulsory clauses, none will grow up in that gross ignorance which is such a fruitful mother of crime, which fills our gaols, and yearly robs honest industry of a large portion of its reward.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Of course, a great deal will depend on the manner in which the new act is worked ; but if care be taken to administer it in the spirit which actuated its framers, we confidently expect to see the most beneficial effects flow from its operation."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Many Spanish and Portuguese festivals include costumed figures known as '''''gigantes y cabezudos''''', roughly, "Giants and Big-Heads"; in [[Portuguese language|portuguese]] '''''gigantones e cabeçudos'''''; in [[Valencian]], "Gegants i cabuts";  in [[Catalan language|Catalan]], ''gegants i capgrossos''; or in [[Basque language|Basque]], "erraldoi eta buruhandiak". The main feature of these figures is typically their [[papier maché]] [[mask|head]]; bodies are covered in clothing matching the costume's theme.

==''Gigantes''==
[[File:Gigantes pamplona jorge urdanoz.jpg|thumb|''Gigantes'' of [[Pamplona]], Spain]]
[[File:Els Gegants de Lleida.JPG|thumb|The Giants of [[Lleida]], Spain]]
The [[giant (mythology)|giants]] are usually hollow figures several meters tall, with a painted paper maché head and arms, the rest of the body being covered in [[cloth]] and other clothing. Their frame is usually made of wood or aluminum, with [[Carton#Carton-pierre|carton-pierre]]—a mixture of papier-mâché and [[plaster of paris]]— used to make the head and hands. The frame of the body is hidden by cloth, and the arms typically have no structural element to allow them to swing in the air when the giant is turned.

Within the frame is an individual controlling the giant. He carries a harness on his shoulder that is linked to the internal structure, and will move and shake the giant in a [[dance]], usually accompanied by a local [[marching band]]. Typically, these dances will include at least two giants, the male ''gigante'' and the female giantess, called ''giganta'' or ''gigantona'', though some towns have multiple couples.

The figures usually depict [[archetype]]s of the town, such as the [[bourgeois]] and the [[peasant]] woman, or historical figures of local relevance, such as a founding [[king]] and [[Queen consort|queen]], or pairs of [[Moors|Moorish]] and Christian nobles.
[[File:Mare de Déu de la Salut 21.jpg|thumb|Gegants at [[La Mare de Déu de la Salut Festival]] from [[Algemesí]].]]

==''Cabezudos''==
''Cabezudos'' are smaller figures, usually to the human scale, that feature an oversized, carton-pierre head. The heads are worn with a matching costume. The person dressed as cabezudo will use one hand to hold his head, while the other hand carries a [[whip (implement)|whip]] or [[pig bladder]], used to frighten children or young women. Seeing through the "mouth" of the head, he will chase after these people, though he might pause to calm a frightened child.

As with the giants, the cabezudos typically represent archetypes of their town.

==''Zarzuela''==
''Gigantes y cabezudos'' is also the title of an 1898 [[zarzuela]], with music by [[Manuel Fernández Caballero]], set in [[Zaragoza|Saragossa]] and featuring a contemporary event: the Spanish army's return from the disastrous defeat of the [[Cuban War of Independence]]. The action unfolds during the festival of the [[Fiestas del Pilar]], and concludes with a rousing [[Jota (music)|jota]] focusing on the stereotypically strong, hardy character of the [[Aragon]]ese, comparing them to the ever-battling "Gigantes" and "Cabezudos".

"'''Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau'''" ({{IPA-cy|heːn wlɑːd və n̥adaɪ̯}}) is the [[national anthem]] of [[Wales]].&lt;ref name= "Anthem genedlaethol"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wales.com/about-wales/facts-about-wales/welsh-national-anthem |title=Welsh National Anthem |publisher=[[Welsh Government]] |year=2014 |accessdate=24 May 2014 |work=wales.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; The title – taken from the first words of the song – means "Old Land of My Fathers" in [[Welsh Language|Welsh]], usually rendered in English as simply "Land of My Fathers". The words were written by [[Evan James (poet)|Evan James]] and the tune composed by his son, [[James James]], both residents of [[Pontypridd]], [[Glamorgan]], in January 1856.&lt;ref name="Anthem genedlaethol"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC Anthem"&gt;{{cite web|title= Welsh anthem – The background to Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/music/sites/anthem/pages/anthem-background.shtml | accessdate =3 December 2010 |publisher=[[BBC Cymru Wales]] |date= 1 December 2008 |work= Wales history}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest written copy survives and is part of the collections of the [[National Library of Wales]].&lt;ref name = "BBC Anthem" /&gt;
[[File:Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau.ogg|thumb|"Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau", recorded in 1899]]

==Origins==
''Glan Rhondda'' (Banks of the [[River Rhondda|Rhondda]]), as it was known when it was composed, was first performed in the [[vestry]] of the original Capel Tabor, [[Maesteg]] (which later became a [[working men's club]]), in either January or February 1856, by Elizabeth John from [[Pontypridd]], and it soon became popular in the locality.&lt;ref name="BBC Anthem"/&gt;

[[James James]], the composer, was a harpist who played his instrument in the public house which he ran, for the purpose of dancing.&lt;ref name="BBC Anthem"/&gt; The song was originally intended to be performed in 6/8 time, but had to be slowed down to its present tempo when it began to be sung by large crowds.

==Popularity==
The popularity of the song increased after the [[Llangollen]] [[Eisteddfod|festival]] of 1858. Thomas Llewelyn of [[Aberdare]] won a competition for an unpublished collection of Welsh airs with a collection that included ''Glan Rhondda''. The adjudicator of the competition, "Owain Alaw" ([[John Owen (Owain Alaw)|John Owen]], 1821–83) asked for permission to include ''Glan Rhondda'' in his publication, ''Gems of Welsh melody'' (1860–64). This volume gave ''Glan Rhondda'' its more famous title, "Hen wlad fy nhadau", and was sold in large quantities and ensured the popularity of the anthem across the whole of Wales.&lt;ref name="BBC Anthem" /&gt;

At the [[Bangor, Gwynedd|Bangor]] Eisteddfod of 1874 "Hen Wlad fy Nhadau" gained further popularity when it was sung by [[Robert Rees (singer)|Robert Rees]] ("Eos Morlais"), one of the leading Welsh soloists of his day.&lt;ref name="National Anthem"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://webapps.rhondda-cynon-taf.gov.uk/heritagetrail/big_anthem_fawr/anthem_baf.htm | title = The History of the National Anthem | work = Rhondda Cynon Taf Library Services | place = UK | accessdate = 27 December 2011 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110928063648/http://webapps.rhondda-cynon-taf.gov.uk/heritagetrail/big_anthem_fawr/anthem_baf.htm | archivedate = 28 September 2011 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was increasingly sung at patriotic gatherings and gradually it developed into a national anthem.&lt;ref name="BBC Anthem" /&gt;

"Hen wlad fy nhadau" was also one of the first [[Welsh language|Welsh-language]] songs recorded when Madge Breese sang it on 11 March 1899, for the [[Gramophone Company]], as part of the first recording in the Welsh language.&lt;ref name= "BBC Anthem" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.gtj.org.uk/index.php?id=5182&amp;L=0&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=103 | title = The first known recording of Hen Wlad fy Nhadau | publisher = Gathering the Jewels | place = UK}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1905, "Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau" became the first national anthem to be sung at the start of a sporting event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Welsh national anthem |url=http://www.wales.com/en/content/cms/English/About_Wales/Wales_Fact_File/WelshNationalAnthem/WelshNationalAnthem.aspx |publisher=[[Welsh Government]] |year=2015 |accessdate=24 March 2015 |work=Wales.com website |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150216034510/http://www.wales.com/en/content/cms/English/About_Wales/Wales_Fact_File/WelshNationalAnthem/WelshNationalAnthem.aspx |archivedate=16 February 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "BBC Anthem 2"&gt;{{cite web|title=The anthem in more recent years|url= http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/music/sites/anthem/pages/anthem-today.shtml |accessdate=3 December 2010 |publisher= BBC |date=1 December 2008 |work=[[BBC Cymru Wales|Wales]] History}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although crowds singing anthems during matches was commonplace, there was no precedent for the anthem to be sung before a game commenced in any sport.{{refn|group=n|In the United States, singing of patriotic songs before games was first observed in the years following the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], with "[[The Star-Spangled Banner]]" occasionally being sung before baseball games. However, the song's pregame use did not become customary until the 1920s, and "The Star-Spangled Banner" did not become the official national anthem until 1931.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/espn/story/_/id/6957582/the-history-national-anthem-sports-espn-magazine |title=The song remains the same |first1=Luke |last1=Cyphers |first2=Ethan |last2=Trex |publisher=''[[ESPN The Magazine]]'' |date=8 September 2011 |accessdate=10 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} The [[Wales national rugby union team|Welsh national rugby team]] were playing host to the first touring [[The Original All Blacks|New Zealand team]], who to that point were unbeaten.

The New Zealand team started every match with the [[Haka (sports)| Haka]], and [[Welsh Rugby Union]] administrator [[Tom Williams (rugby player, born 1860)|Tom Williams]], suggested that Wales player [[Teddy Morgan]] lead the crowd in the singing of the anthem as a response.

In 1978 as part of their album, also called "Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau", [[Geraint Jarman|Geraint Jarman a'r Cynganeddwyr]] recorded a version of the Welsh national anthem using electric guitars, inspired by Jimi Hendrix's rendition of the ''Star-Spangled Banner''. Jarman's version, played by Welsh guitarist [[Tich Gwilym]] is one of the most famous modern versions of the song.&lt;ref name ="BBC Anthem 2" /&gt;

==Usage==
Tradition has established "Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau" as an unofficial Welsh anthem&lt;ref name="Anthem genedlaethol"/&gt; since 1905, when it was first sung by fans at rugby games, although the official anthem at the time was "[[God Bless the Prince of Wales]]". "Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau" slowly established itself as the more popular anthem over the next four decades, and was sung along with "God Bless the Prince of Wales" and "God Save the Queen" before sporting events until 1975, when sports officials decided that "Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau" should be sung alone. Like other British anthems, it has not been established as a national anthem by law, but it has been used as a national anthem at official governmental ceremonies, including the opening of the Welsh Assembly, and at receptions of the British monarchy since the 1970s.&lt;ref name="BBC Anthem" /&gt;&lt;ref name= "BBC Anthem 2" /&gt; It is recognised and used as an anthem at both national and local events in Wales. 

Usually this will be the only anthem sung: only the first stanza and chorus are usually sung (and in the Welsh language). ''[[God Save the Queen]]'', the national anthem of the United Kingdom, is sometimes played alongside "Hen Wlad fy Nhadau" during official events with a royal connection.&lt;ref name="BBC Anthem 2" /&gt;

The existence of a separate national anthem for Wales has not always been apparent to those from outside the country. In 1993 the newly appointed [[Secretary of State for Wales]] [[John Redwood]] was embarrassingly videotaped opening and closing his mouth during a communal singing of the national anthem, clearly ignorant of the words but unable to mime convincingly;&lt;ref name="WAEoW"&gt;{{cite book |last1 =Davies |first1 =John | last2 =Jenkins | first2 = Nigel | title= The Welsh Academy Encyclopaedia of Wales |year= 2008 |publisher= University of Wales Press | location= Cardiff| page= 364 | isbn = 978-0-7083-1953-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; the pictures were frequently cited as evidence of his unsuitability for the post. According to [[John Major]]'s autobiography, the first thing Redwood's successor [[William Hague]] said, on being appointed, was that he had better find someone to teach him the words. He found [[Ffion Hague|Ffion Jenkins]], and later married her.&lt;ref name="BBC Anthem 2" /&gt;

The tune of "Hen Wlad fy Nhadau" has been used for the anthems of [[Cornwall]] (''[[Bro Goth Agan Tasow]]''), [[Brittany]] (''[[Bro Gozh ma Zadoù]]''),&lt;ref name="WAEoW" /&gt; and [[Y Wladfa]] (''Gwlad Newydd y Cymry'', [[Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau#Gwlad Newydd y Cymry|see below]]).

==Lyrics==
(First stanza)

&lt;poem&gt;Mae hen wlad fy nhadau yn annwyl i mi,
Gwlad beirdd a chantorion, enwogion o fri;
Ei gwrol ryfelwyr, gwladgarwyr tra mad,
Dros ryddid collasant eu gwaed.

(Chorus)
:Gwlad, gwlad, pleidiol wyf i'm gwlad.
:Tra môr yn fur i'r bur hoff bau,
:O bydded i'r hen iaith barhau.

(Second stanza)
Hen Gymru fynyddig, paradwys y bardd,
Pob dyffryn, pob clogwyn, i'm golwg sydd hardd;
Trwy deimlad gwladgarol, mor swynol yw si
Ei nentydd, afonydd, i fi.

(Chorus)

(Third stanza)
Os treisiodd y gelyn fy ngwlad tan ei droed,
Mae hen iaith y Cymry mor fyw ag erioed,
Ni luddiwyd yr awen gan erchyll law brad,
Na thelyn berseiniol fy ngwlad.&lt;/poem&gt;

(Chorus)

&lt;poem&gt;The land of my fathers is dear unto me, 
Land of poets and singers, and people of stature, 
Its warring defenders, so gallant and brave,
For freedom their life's blood they gave

:Land!, Land!, Faithful I am to my land!
:While seas serves as a wall
:For this land so pure,
:O, long may our language endure.

O land of the mountains, the bard's paradise,
Whose precipice, valleys are fair to my eyes,
Green murmuring forest, far echoing flood
Fire the fancy and quicken the blood

For tho' the fierce foeman has ravaged your realm,
The old speech of Wales he cannot o'erwhelm,
Our passionate poets to silence command,
Nor banish the harp from your strand.&lt;/poem&gt;

For freedom shed their blood.

:Nation [or country], Nation, I am faithful to my Nation.
:While the sea [is] a wall to the pure, most loved land,
:O may the old language [''[[videlicet|sc.]]'' Welsh] endure.

Old mountainous Wales, paradise of the bard,&lt;br&gt;
Every valley, every cliff, to my look is beautiful.&lt;br&gt;
Through patriotic feeling, so charming is the murmur&lt;br&gt;
Of her brooks, rivers, to me.

If the enemy oppresses my land under his foot, &lt;br&gt;
The old language of the Welsh is as alive as ever.&lt;br&gt;
The muse is not hindered by the hideous hand of treason,&lt;br&gt;
Nor [is] the melodious harp of my country.

:Land, land, true I am to my land,

Old land of the mountains, the Eden of bards,&lt;br&gt;
Each gorge and each valley a loveliness guards;&lt;br&gt;
Through love of my country, charmed voices will be &lt;br&gt;
Its streams, and its rivers, to me.

Though foemen have trampled my land 'neath their feet, &lt;br&gt;
The language of Cambria still knows no retreat;&lt;br&gt;
The muse is not vanquished by traitor's fell hand,&lt;br&gt;
Nor silenced the harp of my land.

[[File:Royal Badge of Wales (2008).svg|thumb|170px|The [[Royal Badge of Wales]]]]
The Welsh poet [[Dylan Thomas]] is often quoted as saying "The land of my fathers. My fathers can have it!" in reference to Wales. However, this is misleading, as it was a villainous character in one of Thomas' short stories that spoke this line.

[[Gwynfor Evans]] named his history of Wales ''Land of my fathers: 2,000 years of Welsh history''. It was a translation of the Welsh original, ''Aros Mae''.

The [[One pound (British coin)|£1 coins]] minted in 1985, 1990, 1995 and 2000 with a Welsh emblem on the reverse, also bear the edge inscription &lt;small&gt;PLEIDIOL WYF I'M GWLAD&lt;/small&gt; ("I am devoted to my country"), from the refrain of "Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visitwales.co.uk/about-wales-guide-to-wales-culture-people-and-language/welsh-history/welsh-national-anthem/ |title=Welsh National Anthem|publisher=[[Welsh Government]] |year=2012 |accessdate=1 July 2012 |work=[[Visit Wales]] website}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new [[Royal Badge of Wales]] adopted in 2008 features this motto.

== ''Gwlad Newydd y Cymry'' ==
[[File:Gwladnewyddycymry.jpg|thumb|200px|A printed version of ''Gwlad Newydd y Cymry'']]
A version of "Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau" was written by Lewis Evans, a migrant from Wales to [[Y Wladfa]], a Welsh-speaking settlement in [[Patagonia]], South America. The version penned by Evans is called ''Gwlad Newydd y Cymry'' (The New Country of the Welsh). ''Gwlad Newydd y Cymry'' is played to the same tune as "Hen Wlad Fy Nhadau".

=== Lyrics ===
The lyrics to ''Gwlad Newydd y Cymry'' are as follows;

&lt;poem&gt;Y mae Patagonia yn annwyl i mi,
Gwlad newydd y Cymry mwyneiddlon yw hi;
Anadlu gwir ryddid a gawn yn y wlad,
O gyrhaedd  gormesiaeth a brad:
:Gwlad, gwlad, pleidiol wyf i'm gwlad,
:Tra haul y nen uwchben ein pau,
:O! bydded i'r Wladfa barhau.

Bu'r Cymry yn gorwedd dan ddirmyg yn drwch,
Wel, diolch am Wladfa i'n codi o'r llwch;
Ein heniaith a gadwn mewn urddas a bri,
Tra'r Gamwy'n ddysgleiriol ei lli:
: (chorus)

'Chaiff Cymro byth mwyach ymostwng i Sais,-
Terfynodd ei orthrwm - dystawyd ei lais;
Y Wladfa fawrygwn tra'r Andes wen fawr,
A'i choryn yn 'stafell y wawr:
: (chorus)&lt;/poem&gt;

As a cultural category with its sets of associated practices ''hygge'' has more or less the same meanings in Danish and Norwegian, but the notion is more central in Denmark than Norway.&lt;ref name=Gullestad1992note&gt;{{ cite book | author = Gullestad, Marianne | year = 1992 | title = The art of social relations: essays on culture, social action and everyday life in modern Norway|chapter=Home Decoration as Popular Culture | isbn = 8200216527 | place = Oslo |language=English | publisher = Scandinavian University Press | url = https://urn.nb.no/URN:NBN:no-nb_digibok_2015102906007;page=248 | page = 235| postscript=. [note 12 for chapter III]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The emphasis on ''hygge'' as a part of Danish culture is a recent phenomenon, dating to the late 20th century.

== Etymology ==
The word ''hygge'' comes from a Danish word meaning "to give courage, comfort, joy".&lt;ref name=FalkogTorpHygge&gt;{{ cite book | author = [[Hjalmar Falk|Falk, Hjalmar]] &amp; [[Alf Torp|Torp, Alf]] | year = 1903 | title = Etymologisk Ordbog over det norske og det danske Sprog|chapter=Hygge | place = Kristiania |language=Norwegian| publisher = Aschehoug | url = https://urn.nb.no/URN:NBN:no-nb_digibok_2014090924004;page=324 | page = 315}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Hygge'' stems from ''hyggja'' which means to think in [[Old Norse]].&lt;ref name=FalkogTorpHygge/&gt; ''Hygge'' is built from the [[Old Norse]] word ''hugr'' which later became the [[Hug (folklore)|''hug'']] which means the soul, mind, consciousness.&lt;ref name=FalkogTorpHug&gt;{{ cite book | author = [[Hjalmar Falk|Falk, Hjalmar]] &amp; [[Alf Torp|Torp, Alf]] | year = 1903 | title = Etymologisk Ordbog over det norske og det danske Sprog|chapter=Hu | place = Kristiania |language=Norwegian | publisher = Aschehoug | url = https://urn.nb.no/URN:NBN:no-nb_digibok_2014090924004;page=312 | page = 303}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Swedish Hygge is a harvested forest area.

But it is also speculated that ''hygge'' might originate from the word ''hug''. ''Hug'' comes from the 1560s word ''hugge'', which means "to embrace". The word ''hugge'' is of unknown origin but is highly associated with an Old Norse term, ''hygga'', which means "to comfort", which comes from the word ''hugr'', meaning "mood". In turn, the word comes from the Germanic word ''hugyan'', which relates to the Old English ''hycgan'', meaning "to think, consider".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/958463988|title=The little book of hygge : the Danish way to live well|last=Wiking|first=Meik|isbn=9780241283912|oclc=958463988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It first appeared in Danish writing in the 19th Century and has since evolved into the cultural idea known in Denmark and Norway today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-34345791|title=Hygge: A heart-warming lesson from Denmark|last=Parkinson|first=Justin|date=2015-10-02|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-05-25|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; While hygge has exactly the same meaning in Norwegian as in Danish and is a widely used word in Denmark (including in its derived forms, such as ''hyggelig''), the emphasis specifically on "hygge" as an important part of their cultural identity is mostly a recent Danish phenomenon; in Norway "hygge" is just a word, similar in status to "cozy" in English-speaking countries.

== Use ==
In both Danish and Norwegian, ''hygge'' refers to "a form of everyday togetherness", "a pleasant and highly valued everyday experience of safety, equality, personal wholeness and a spontaneous social flow".&lt;ref&gt;[https://heinz.sdu.dk:8443/ws/files/38094393/Linnet%20Phd%20dissertation.pdf ''Interweavings – A cultural phenomenology of everyday consumption and social atmosphere within Danish middleclass families'', Jeppe Trolle Linnet, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

The noun ''hygge'' includes something nice, cozy, safe and known, referring to a psychological state.&lt;ref&gt;Hjalmar Falk og Alf Torp (1903): ''Etymologisk ordbog over det norske og det danske sprog''. Aschehoug, Kristiania, s. 315&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Collins English Dictionary|''Collins'' ''English Dictionary'']] defines the word as "a concept, originating in Denmark, of creating cosy and convivial atmospheres that promote wellbeing".&lt;ref name="collins"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/word-lovers-blog/new/top-10-collins-words-of-the-year-2016,323,HCB.html|title=Top 10 Collins Word of the Year 2016|date=2016-11-03|publisher=collinsdictionary.com|accessdate=2016-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Broadway musical [[Frozen (musical)|Frozen]], there is a song called ‘Hygge’, which is all about being comfortable.

In Australian soap opera ''[[Neighbours]]'', [[Jemima Davies-Smythe]] incorporates Hygge into a resdesign of her half-brother [[Karl Kennedy]]'s living room.

'''''I Am Legend''''' is a 1954 science fiction horror novel by American writer [[Richard Matheson]]. It was influential in the development of the zombie-vampire genre and in popularizing the concept of a worldwide apocalypse due to disease. The novel was a success and was adapted into the films ''[[The Last Man on Earth (1964 film)|The Last Man on Earth]]'' (1964), ''[[The Omega Man]]'' (1971), ''[[I Am Legend (film)|I Am Legend]]'' (2007), and the direct-to-video production ''[[I Am Omega]]'' (2007). It was also an inspiration behind ''[[Night of the Living Dead]]'' (1968).

==Plot summary==
Robert Neville is the apparent sole survivor of a [[pandemic]] whose symptoms resemble [[Vampire|vampirism]]. It is said that the pandemic was caused by a war, and that it was spread by dust storms in the cities and an explosion in the [[mosquito]] population. The narrative details Neville's daily life in [[Los Angeles]] as he attempts to comprehend, research, and possibly cure the disease, to which he is [[immunity (medical)|immune]]. Neville's past is revealed through [[Flashback (narrative)|flashback]]s; the disease claimed his wife and daughter, and he was forced to kill his wife after she seemingly rose from the dead as a vampire and attacked him. Before he killed her, Neville says he did try to keep her with him but gives no details about this.

Neville survives by barricading himself inside his house after sunset, and he is further protected by garlic, mirrors, and [[crucifix]]es. Swarms of vampires, led by Neville's neighbor, Ben Cortman, regularly surround his house, trying to find ways to get inside. During the day, he scavenges for supplies and searches out the inactive vampires, driving stakes into their hearts to kill them. He finds brief solace in a stray dog that finds its way to his house. Desperate for company, Neville slowly earns the dog's trust with food and brings it into the house.  Despite his efforts, the dog proves to be infected and dies a week later.

After bouts of [[Depression (mood)|depression]] and [[alcoholism]], Neville decides to find out the scientific cause of the pandemic. He obtains books and other research materials from a library, and through painstaking research discovers the root of the disease in a strain of [[bacteria]] capable of infecting both deceased and living hosts. His experiments also reveals that the infection creates an allergic reaction to garlic in the host. He further discovers that the vampires are affected by mirrors and crosses because of "[[Conversion disorder|hysterical blindness]]", the result of previous [[Operant conditioning|psychological conditioning]] of the infected. Driven [[insanity|insane]] by the disease, the infected now react as they believe they should when confronted with these items. Even then, their reaction is constrained to the beliefs of the particular person; for example, a [[Christian]] vampire would fear the cross, but a [[Jews|Jewish]] vampire would not.

Neville also discovers more efficient means of killing the vampires, other than just driving a stake into their hearts. This includes exposing them to direct sunlight (which kills the bacteria) or inflicting deep wounds on their bodies so that the bacteria switch from being [[Anaerobic organism|anaerobic]] [[Symbiosis|symbionts]] to [[Aerobic organism|aerobic]] [[Parasitism|parasites]], rapidly consuming their hosts when exposed to air. He is now killing such large numbers of vampires in his daily forays that his nightly visitors have diminished significantly.

After three years, Neville sees an apparently uninfected woman, Ruth, in broad daylight, and captures her. After some convincing, Ruth tells him her story of how she and her husband survived the pandemic (though her husband was killed two weeks earlier). Neville is puzzled by the fact that she is upset when he speaks of killing vampires; he thinks that if her story of survival was true, she would have become hardened to the act. He attempts to test whether she is a vampire by exposing her to garlic, which causes her to recoil violently.  At night Neville is startled awake and finds Ruth fully clothed at the front door of the house. Suspicious, he questions her motives, but relates the trauma of his past, whereupon they comfort each other. Ruth reluctantly allows him to take a [[Sampling (medicine)#blood|blood sample]] but knocks him unconscious when the sample reveals that she is infected.

When he wakes, Neville discovers a note from Ruth confessing that she is actually infected and that Neville was responsible for her husband's death. Ruth admits that she was sent to spy on him.  It turns out that only the infected created from reanimated corpses are utterly feral, but not those who were alive when they were infected.  The living-infected have slowly overcome their disease until they can spend short periods of time in sunlight, and are attempting to build a new society. They have developed medication which helps them to overcome the most severe symptoms of the infection. Ruth warns Neville that her people will attempt to capture him, and that he should leave his house and escape to the mountains.

Neville cannot bring himself to leave his house, however, and assumes that he will be captured and treated fairly by the new society.  Infected members of the new society eventually attack the house. During the attack, the members of the new society violently dispatch the feral vampires outside the house, and Neville becomes alarmed at the grim enjoyment they appear to take from this task. Realising that the intention of the attackers may be to kill him rather than to capture him, he tries to defend himself with a pistol, leading to one of the infected shooting and badly injuring him.

Neville wakes in a barred cell where he is visited by Ruth, who informs him that she is a ranking member of the new society but, unlike the others, does not resent him. Ruth attempts to present a façade of indifference to Neville, but is unable to maintain it during her discussion with him. After discussing the effects of Neville's vampire-killing activities on the new society, she acknowledges the need for Neville's execution and gives him pills, claiming they will "make it easier". Fatally injured, Neville accepts his fate and asks Ruth not to let this society become heartless. Ruth kisses him and leaves.

Neville goes to his prison window and sees the infected waiting for his execution. He now sees that the infected view him with the same hatred and fear that he once felt for the vampires; he realizes that he, a remnant of old humanity, is now a legend to the new race born of the infection:  Just as vampires are monsters that hunt humans during the time of day they are not active (night), he is a feared monster that hunts the vampires during the daylight hours when they are asleep. He recognizes that their desire to kill him is not something he can condemn. As the pills take effect, he thinks: "[I am] a new superstition entering the unassailable fortress of forever. I am legend."

==Critical reception==
As related from ''[[In Search of Wonder]]'' (1956), [[Damon Knight]] wrote:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Knight|first=Damon|year=1967|title=In Search of Wonder|location=Chicago|publisher=Advent}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The book is full of good ideas, every other one of which is immediately dropped and kicked out of sight.  The characters are child's drawings, as blank-eyed and expressionless as the author himself in his back-cover photograph. The plot limps.  All the same, the story could have been an admirable minor work in the tradition of ''[[Dracula]]'', if only the author, or somebody, had not insisted on encumbering it with the year's most childish set of 'scientific' rationalizations.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Galaxy Science Fiction|''Galaxy'']] reviewer [[Groff Conklin]] described ''Legend'' as "a weird [and] rather slow-moving first novel&amp;nbsp;... a horrid, violent, sometimes exciting but too often overdone tour de force."&lt;ref&gt;"Galaxy's 5 Star Shelf", ''[[Galaxy Science Fiction]]'', January 1955, p.121&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anthony Boucher]] praised the novel, saying "Matheson has added a new variant on the Last Man theme&amp;nbsp;... and has given striking vigor to his invention by a forceful style of storytelling which derives from the best hard-boiled crime novels".&lt;ref&gt;"Recommended Reading," ''[[The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction|F&amp;SF]]'', November 1954, p.99.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dan Schneider (writer)|Dan Schneider]] from ''International Writers Magazine: Book Review'' wrote in 2005:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hackwriters.com/iamlegend.htm |title=I am Legend by Richard Matheson |last=Schneider |first=Dan |publisher=hackwriters.com |date=1953-01-05 |accessdate=2013-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;...&amp;nbsp;despite having vampires in it, [the novel] is not a novel on vampires, nor even a horror nor sci-fi novel at all, in the deepest sense. Instead, it is perhaps the greatest novel written on human loneliness. It far surpasses [[Daniel Defoe]]’s ''[[Robinson Crusoe]]'' in that regard. Its insights into what it is to be human go far beyond genre, and is all the more surprising because, having read his short stories--which range from competent but simplistic, to having classic ''[[The Twilight Zone|Twilight Zone]]'' twists (he was a major contributor to the original TV series)--there is nothing within those short stories that suggests the supreme majesty of the existential masterpiece ''I Am Legend'' was aborning.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2012, the [[Horror Writers Association]] gave ''I Am Legend'' the special Vampire Novel of the Century Award.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.horror.org/blog/?p=2453 2011 Bram Stoker Award™ winners and Vampire Novel of the Century Award winner]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
Although Matheson calls the assailants in his novel "vampires", and though their condition is transmitted through blood and garlic is an [[Apotropaic magic|apotropaic]]-like repellant, there is little similarity between them and vampires as developed by [[John William Polidori]] and his successors, who come straight out of the [[gothic fiction]] tradition. In ''I Am Legend'', the "vampires" share more similarities with zombies, and the novel influenced the [[zombie]] genre and popularized the concept of a worldwide [[Zombie#Zombie apocalypse|zombie apocalypse]].&lt;ref name="books.google.co.uk"&gt;Deborah Christie, Sarah Juliet Lauro, ed. (2011).

{{Quote|''I Am Legend'' is the product of an anxious artistic mind working in an anxious cultural climate. However, it is also a playful take on an old archetype, the vampire (the reader is even treated to Neville’s reading and put-down of [[Bram Stoker]]'s ''[[Dracula]]''). Matheson goes to great lengths to rationalize or naturalize the vampire myth, transplanting the monster from the otherworldly realms of folklore and Victorian supernaturalism to the test tube of medical inquiry and rational causation. With ''I Am Legend'', Matheson instituted the germ theory of vampirism, a take on the old archetype which has since been tackled by other writers (notably, [[Dan Simmons]] in ''Children of the Night'' from 1992).}}

== Adaptations==
===Comics===
&lt;!-- [[Richard Matheson's I Am Legend]] links here --&gt;
The book has also been adapted into a [[comic book]] [[Limited series (comics)|miniseries]] titled ''Richard Matheson's I Am Legend'' by [[Steve Niles]] and Elman Brown. It was published in 1991 by [[Eclipse Comics]] and collected into a [[Trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]] by [[IDW Publishing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{gcdb series|id=22085|title=I Am Legend}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{comicbookdb|type=title|id=11626|title=I Am Legend}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Radio play===
A nine-part abridged reading of the novel performed by [[Angus MacInnes]] was originally broadcast on [[BBC Radio 4 Extra|BBC Radio 7]] in January 2006&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiolistings.co.uk/programmes/i/i_/i_am_legend.html |title=BBC Radio 7 - I am Legend |publisher=Radiolistings.co.uk |accessdate=2015-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and repeated in January 2018.

===Films===
''I Am Legend'' has been adapted to a feature-length film four times (one of which does not credit Matheson as the source). Differing from the book, each of them portrays the Neville character as an accomplished scientist. The first three adaptations show him finding a remedy and passing it on. Adaptations differ from the novel by setting the events three years after the disaster, instead of happening “in the span of” three years. Also adaptations are set in the near future, a few years after the film's release, while the novel is set twenty years after its publication date.

In [[1964 in film|1964]], [[Vincent Price]] starred as Dr. Robert Morgan (rather than "Neville") in ''[[The Last Man on Earth (1964 film)|The Last Man on Earth]]'' (the original title of this [[Italy|Italian]] production was ''L'ultimo uomo della Terra''). Matheson wrote the original screenplay for this adaptation, but due to later rewrites did not wish his name to appear in the credits; as a result, Matheson is credited under the pseudonym "Logan Swanson".&lt;ref name="WiaterBradley2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Stan Wiater|author2=Matthew R. Bradley|author3=Paul Stuve|title=The Twilight and Other Zones: The Dark Worlds of Richard Matheson|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YLsunUB90q4C&amp;pg=PA176|accessdate=3 June 2013|year=2009|publisher=Kensington Publishing Corporation|isbn=978-0-8065-3113-7|pages=177–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''The Omega Man''====
{{Main|The Omega Man}}
In [[1971 in film|1971]], a far different version was produced, titled ''[[The Omega Man]]''. It starred [[Charlton Heston]] (as Robert Neville) and [[Anthony Zerbe]]. Matheson had no influence on the screenplay for this film,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/omega_man_the |title=Omega Man, The |publisher=Sf-encyclopedia.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and although the premise remains, it deviates from the novel in several ways, removing the infected people's vampiric characteristics, except their sensitivity to light. In this version, the infected are portrayed as nocturnal, black-robed, [[Albinism|albino]] mutants, known as The Family. Though intelligent, they eschew modern technology, believing it (and those who use it, such as Neville) to be evil and the cause of humanity's downfall.

====''I Am Legend''====
{{Main|I Am Legend (film)}}
In 2007, a third adaptation of the novel was produced, this time titled ''[[I Am Legend (film)|I Am Legend]]''. Directed by [[Francis Lawrence]] and starring [[Will Smith]] as Robert Neville, this film uses both Matheson's novel and the 1971 ''Omega Man'' film as its sources.&lt;ref&gt;end credits: "Based on the screenplay by John &amp; Joyce Corrington, and the novel by Richard Matheson"&lt;/ref&gt; This adaptation also deviates significantly from the novel. In this version, the infection is caused by a virus originally intended to cure [[cancer]]. Some vampiric elements are retained, such as sensitivity to [[Ultraviolet|UV light]] and attraction to blood. The infected are portrayed as nocturnal, feral creatures of limited intelligence who hunt the uninfected with [[berserker]]-like rage. Other creatures, such as dogs, are also infected by the virus. The ending of the film was also altered to portray Neville as sacrificing his life to save humanity, rather than being executed for crimes against the surviving vampiric humans, although a deleted ending for the film was closer in spirit to the book.&lt;ref name="books.google.co.uk"/&gt; The film takes place in New York City in the years 2009 and 2012 rather than Los Angeles in 1975–1977.

====''I Am Omega''====
{{Main|I Am Omega}}
[[The Asylum]] production ''I Am Omega'' is a 2007 American feature length [[direct-to-video]] release starring [[Mark Dacascos]]. The film takes place in a post-apocalyptic Los Angeles, which is overrun by savage, [[cannibalism|cannibalistic]] humans who have degenerated into a feral subspecies as the result of a genetic virus. Once again, the adaption deviates from the novel and does not credit Matheson.

In this adaption, "Renchard" has been forced to live in a daily struggle for survival against the mutants. Renchard is contacted via [[webcam]] by Brianna (Jennifer Lee Wiggins), another survivor who was stranded in Los Angeles while trying to find Antioch, a community of survivors. Renchard is forced to aid her and two others escape the city in which he has strategically placed time bombs, set to go off in 24 hours.

This film was rushed into production by The Asylum and released a month prior to the bigger budget Francis Lawrence project.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2281">The '''Indigenous Voices Awards''' are a [[Canada|Canadian]] literary award program, created in 2017 to honour [[indigenous literatures in Canada]].&lt;ref name=cbc&gt;[https://www.cbc.ca/news/indigenous/indigenous-writers-prize-1.4362221 "New literary prize for Indigenous writers to offer $25K in awards"]. [[CBC News]], October 19, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

The awards grew out of a 2017 controversy, when a group of Canadian writers were criticized for campaigning on [[Twitter]] in favour of a prize supporting [[cultural appropriation]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://quillandquire.com/omni/crowdfunded-indigenous-voices-awards-formally-launches-with-focus-on-emerging-talent/ "Crowdfunded Indigenous Voices Awards formally launches, with focus on emerging talent"]. ''[[Quill &amp; Quire]]'', October 30, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Toronto lawyer Robin Parker launched a [[crowdfunding]] campaign to create a new prize for [[First Nations]], [[Métis people|Métis]] and [[Inuit people|Inuit]] writers in Canada. The crowdfunding campaign was set with a goal of $10,000, but ultimately attracted over $140,000 in donations.&lt;ref name=cbc/&gt;

The awards honour both published and unpublished work by indigenous writers. The first winners were announced in May 2018.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cbc.ca/books/billy-ray-belcourt-aviaq-johnston-among-winners-of-2018-indigenous-voices-awards-1.4685412 "Billy-Ray Belcourt, Aviaq Johnston among winners of 2018 Indigenous Voices Awards"].

The {{Nihongo|'''Japan National Tourism Organization'''|国際観光振興機構|Kokusai Kankō Shinkō Kikō}}, '''JNTO''', provides information about [[Japan]] to promote travel to and in the country. It was established in 1964 and its headquarters are in [[Yotsuya]], [[Shinjuku|Shinjuku-ku]], [[Tokyo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.jnto.go.jp/eng/contact/regional_offices.html|title=JNTO Offices|website=www.jnto.go.jp|language=en|access-date=2018-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The JNTO operates Tourist Information Centers (TICs) as well as a [[website]]. It disseminates information about transportation, lodging, food and beverage, and sight-seeing as well as published tourism statistics and market reports. It also provides support for international conventions and incentive events&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.jnto.go.jp/eng/about/|title=About JNTO|website=www.jnto.go.jp|language=en|access-date=2018-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  

JNTO is an [[Independent Administrative Institution]] of the [[government of Japan]]. Its [[publication]]s and website assist in preparing travel itineraries within Japan, providing a wide range of travel information in English and other languages on transportation, accommodations, shopping and events. The materials are updated frequently.

While traveling in Japan, visitors may take advantage of the nationwide "i" Information System, which numbered 113 outlets in 2004. Each "i" center is an information source for the area it represents. The "i" centers are ordinarily located at [[railway station]]s or in city centers, and are easily recognized by their logo, a red question mark with the word "information" printed underneath.

JNTO sponsors a Goodwill Guide Program, through which some 47,000 bilingual volunteers assist visitors from abroad. They earn the right to wear the program's identifying badge, a white pigeon superimposed upon a globe. Throughout Japan, there are 77 Systematized Goodwill Guide groups (SGG) consisting mostly of students, housewives and retirees who engage in a variety of activities using their foreign language skills. Some groups offer a free preset walking tour, for which the visitor only needs to go to a pre-established place at a certain date and time, while others are available to meet tourists on request. There is no charge for the service of the Goodwill Guides, as they are volunteers, only their travel expenses and their admissions to tourist facilities, and for shared meals.

Services of professional guides and [[Interpreting|interpreters]] may be retained through the ''Japan Guide Association'' or the ''Japan Federation of Licensed Guides''. JNTO administers Licensed Guide Interpreter Examination. A total of some 1,550 licensed guide-interpreters are registered with these organizations, each carrying a registration card issued by the governor of the relevant prefecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.jnto.go.jp/eng/arrange/travel/guide/guideservice.html|title=Guide Services|website=www.jnto.go.jp|language=en|access-date=2018-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Branches==
JNTO maintains 20 offices around the world. Overseas offices provide up-to-date information on travel to and within Japan, place publicity in the media and cooperate with journalists, participate in travel fairs and exhibitions, assist the local travel industry in developing tours, and conduct tourism-related research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.jnto.go.jp/eng/about/|title=About JNTO|website=www.jnto.go.jp|language=en|access-date=2018-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Land of Unreason''''' is a [[fantasy]] novel  by American writers [[Fletcher Pratt]] and [[L. Sprague de Camp]]. It was first published in the fantasy magazine ''[[Unknown (magazine)|Unknown Worlds]]'' for October, 1941 as "The Land of Unreason". Revised and expanded, it was first published in book form by [[Henry Holt and Company]] in 1942. It has been reprinted numerous times since by various publishers, including by [[Ballantine Books]] in January 1970 as the tenth volume of the [[Ballantine Adult Fantasy series]]. An [[E-book]] edition was published by [[Victor Gollancz Ltd|Gollancz]]'s [[SF Gateway]] imprint on September 29, 2011 as part of a general release of de Camp's works in electronic form.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orionbooks.co.uk/authors/de-camp-l.-sprague2 Orion Publishing Group's L. Sprague de Camp webpage]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Land-of-Unreason-ebook/dp/B005HRT7N2 Amazon.com entry for e-book edition]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Fred Barber, an American staying as a guest in an English country home during World War II, consumes a bowl of milk left as an offering for the fairies, substituting liquor in its place. The rightful recipient of the offering, drunk and offended at the substitution, takes vengeance by kidnapping Barber off to the Land of Faerie as a changeling, a fate normally reserved for infants. He finds Faerie beset by a menace echoing the war in his own world. Trapped in a magical realm where rationality as he knows it is turned upside-down and failure to follow the rules can have dire consequences, Barber undertakes a quest in the service of [[Oberon (Fairy King)|Oberon]], the fairy king, in order to be returned to his own world. The outcome, befitting a realm in which nothing is as expected, is one that neither he nor the reader anticipates, for Fred Barber is not quite the man he thinks he is...

==Reception==
[[Orville Prescott]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' found the novel "much less successful" than ''[[The Incomplete Enchanter]]'', saying that "Successful fantasy requires a deft delicacy of touch quite lacking in the heavy-handed technique" used here.&lt;ref&gt;"Books of the Times", ''[[The New York Times]]'', June 17, 1942&lt;/ref&gt; Another ''Times'' reviewer, [[Beatrice Sherman]], however, praised ''Land'' for its "piquant style that combines the medieval phrasing of the fairy-folk's conversation, the very modern talk and turns of thought of the changeling hero, and descriptions practical and poetical of the eerie magic scenery".&lt;ref&gt;"Robust Fantasy", ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'', June 28, 1942&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[New Worlds (magazine)|New Worlds]]'' reviewer James Cawthorn declared the novel a "witty exploration of the world of Shakespeare's ''[[A Midsummer Night's Dream]]''".&lt;ref&gt;"not without Merritt," ''[[New Worlds (magazine)|New Worlds]]'' 200, April 1970, p.31&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ron Goulart]] described ''Land'' as "a screwball comedy . . . an affable novel, and for all its preoccupation with drinking and jumping into bed, a gentle one."&lt;ref&gt;"Books", ''[[Venture Science Fiction]]'', August 1970, p.106&lt;/ref&gt; [[Baird Searles]] noted the novel's "Alice-in-Wonderland surrealism, particularly when the inhabitants of Fairyland get going on logic-chopping and semantics. But the logic of this novel is illogic; the reason for it unreason; somehow it all hangs together triumphantly nonetheless".&lt;ref&gt;"On Books", ''[[Isaac Asimov's Science Fiction Magazine]]'', May 1979, p.15.&lt;/ref&gt; [[E. F. Bleiler]] found it "one of the better semihumorous heroic fantasies, a good child of ''[[Phantastes]]'', with clever integration of incident and theme".&lt;ref name=EFB&gt;E. F. Bleiler, ''The Guide to Supernatural Fiction'', Kent State University Press, 1983 (p.416)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ProjectLapels.jpeg|thumb|Wikimedia project lapel pins]]
A '''lapel pin'''  is a small [[brooch|pin]] worn on clothing, often worn on the [[Jacket lapel|lapel]] of a jacket. Lapel pins can be ornamental or can indicate wearer's affiliation with an organization or cause. Before the popularity of wearing lapel pins, [[boutonnière]]s were worn.{{fact|date=November 2015}}

== Popular usage ==
[[File:Wikipedia Globe Pin.jpg|130px|right|thumb|A Wikipedia lapel pin]]

Lapel pins are frequently used as symbols of achievement and belonging in different organizations. Lapel pins from the organization are often collected by members and non-members alike.

Businesses also use lapel pins to designate achievement and membership. Lapel pins are a common element of employee recognition programs, and they are presented to individuals as a symbol of an accomplishment. Like fraternity and sorority pins, these lapel pins instill a sense of belonging to an elite group of performers at the organization. Businesses also award lapel pins to employees more frequently to boost employee morale, productivity, and [[employee engagement]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baudville.com/recognition-used-recognition-to-boost-associate-morale/article-view/78 "Esurance Uses Lapel Pin Recognition to Boost Associate Morale" ]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Soviet Union]] had great production of these. Besides pins showing political figures and as souvenirs for tourist spots, there were pins for various sports, cultural, and political gatherings and for technical achievements of the Soviet Union. The pins had countercultural meanings as well; for example, the pin featuring the robot spacecraft [[Kosmos 186]] (which approached and docked with Kosmos 188) had a sexual connotation.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

In recent years, [[pin trading|pin collecting and trading]] has also become a popular hobby. Demand for pin designs based on popular cartoon characters and themes such as [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]], [[Betty Boop]], and [[Hard Rock Cafe]] has surged and led to the creation of pin trading events and other social activities. [[Disney pin trading]] is a prime example of this.&lt;ref&gt;[http://craft-project.com/2008/06/27/have-you-try-for-pin-collecting/ Pin collecting hobby]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural significance==
[[File:HK Sheung Wan 上環 摩羅上街 Lower Lascar Row 2nd market Chairman Mao badges June-2012.JPG|thumb|[[Chairman Mao badge]]s from [[China]]]]

In the [[USSR]] and the [[People's Republic of China]], the prominent lapel pins with portraits of [[Lenin]] and [[Mao Zedong]], respectively, were worn by youth as well as by Communist party members or people who felt like showing their official political [[credo]]. In [[Czechoslovakia]], the [[Chairman Mao badge|Mao badges/pins]] were worn in the late 1960s and early 1970s by non-conformist youth as a prank and a way to provoke the "normalisationist" reactionaries of the purged post-1968 Communist Party of Czechoslovakia.

In the 1970s, initiates of [[Prem Rawat|Guru Maharaj Ji]] extensively used buttons, sometimes quite large, with images of the guru's face on them.&lt;ref&gt;Elman, Richard.

==Design==
Pin design starts off very similar to animation. Everything is hand drawn with a blue line. It is done either digitally or on paper with a light-box to plan out all of the elements and artwork that make up the design. Once the design is approved, it is inked, colored, and placed on a mechanical sheet, which is like a blueprint for the pin, with appropriate measurements and call-outs for manufacturing the parts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pinusa.com/process.html Pin USA process]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process==
'''Step 1: Stamping Molding'''

Molds the metal surface to form the design.

'''Step 2: Outline Cutting'''
* Cutting molds are made separately, then cut to the exact outline of the design.
* Additional outline cutting molds may be required depending on the complexity of the design. * If a center hole or cut-out is required, an additional cut-through mold must be used.

'''Step 3: Attachment'''

Solder attachment onto the back of each piece.

'''Step 4: Plating'''

Plating now can be processed. The quality of plating varies with the length of time the metal is soaked in the plating liquid.

'''Step 5: Polishing'''

The metal surface is then polished until it is smooth and shiny. This applies to copper material only. Iron can be polished if required, but this will incur a surcharge.

'''Step 6: Coloring'''
* Soft enamel is carefully inserted by hand, one color at a time, using different sized syringes. * Drying. * To prevent defects, a high degree of skill is required in order to keep each color and the correct amount of enamel in the proper area.

'''Step 7: Cleaning'''

Excess color and impurities are then wiped off the metal surfaces.

'''Step 8: Baking'''

The metal piece is baked at approximately 450F for 12 to 15 minutes.

'''Step 9: Epoxy Coating'''

Clear epoxy is then applied to the surface to protect the enamel from color fading and cracking. (Epoxy coating is optional and provided according to customer’s requirements)

* The standard colors are based on the Pantone Chart.
* Bolder designs are recommended in order to prevent any unsatisfactory coloring caused by lines and figures that are too thin or too small.
* General enamel coloring requires a surrounding metal space to ensure good quality painting results. Therefore, it is usually necessary to allow for a blank metal rim (0.3mm minimum).

For budget considerations, iron material can be used instead of copper, but without polishing.

==Modern manufacturing process==
[[File:Vendeur de Pin's.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A lapel pin vendor in Paris]]

Almost all manufacturing is currently done in China, specifically in and around [[Kunshan]], a satellite city in the greater [[Suzhou]] region that is administratively at the county-level in southeast Jiangsu, China, just outside [[Shanghai]]. Inexpensive labor in China has made non-Chinese production of lapel pins non-existent.

In the die struck manufacturing process, there are five basic types of pins: cloisonné, soft enamel, photo etched, screen printed and 4-color printed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Custom Lapel Pins Style  | accessdate = 2012-12-02 | url = http://www.thepinpeople.com/custompinstyles/ | work = | publisher = The Pin People}}&lt;/ref&gt; In all processes, the outer shape of the pin is stamped out from a sheet of steel, aluminum, copper, brass, or iron. In the case of cloisonne and soft enamel, the shape and the design are stamped out.

'''Cloisonné'''&lt;br /&gt;
Sometimes called epola or hard enamel, [[cloisonné]] is stamped out from a sheet of copper. The stamping leaves recessed areas, or pools, which are filled with [[vitreous enamel|enamel]] powder and high fired at 800 – 900 degrees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Custom Products  | accessdate = 2009-02-23 | url = http://condorcreations.com/price/ | work = | publisher = Condor Creations | date = February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After cooling, the surface of the pin is ground down to a smooth finish and then the copper is plated.

'''Soft enamel'''&lt;br /&gt;
This process is like epola and cloisonné in that strips of metal separate areas of color. Unlike cloisonné, the areas of color rest below the metal strip surface, which can be felt when you run your finger over the surface. Like the photo etched process, the top can be covered with protective [[epoxy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Materials |accessdate=2009-02-23 |url=http://deltaspark.com/main/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=16&amp;Itemid=37 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100117013132/http://deltaspark.com/main/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=16&amp;Itemid=37 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2010-01-17 |work= |publisher=Delta Spark |date=January 2008 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt; so that the piece appears smooth.

'''Photo etched'''&lt;br /&gt;
In the photo etch process, only the shape of the piece is stamped out. The design on the face of the pin is chemically etched into the base metal, then color-filled by hand and baked before being polished. In the final step, a thin coat of clear epoxy can be applied to the surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Photo Etched Lapel pins  | accessdate = 2009-02-23 | url = http://www.allaboutpins.com/photoetched.html | work = | publisher = All About Pins | date = August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Photo Dome'''&lt;br /&gt;
This process begins by printing the art or design on vinyl or paper and then applying it to a metal pin base. The vinyl is then coated with an epoxy dome that protects the art from wear and the elements. This process is gaining in popularity because of advances in printing resolutions and the ability to complete these pins quickly in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Rush Pins  | accessdate = 2012-03-17 | url = http://www.pinsfast.com/rush-pins | work = | publisher = Pins Fast  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Screen printed'''&lt;br /&gt;
[[Screen printing]], a.k.a. silk screening is produced by applying each color to the metal base using a "silk screen" process. These are blocks of solid color.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Silk Screen Printed Lapel pins |accessdate=2009-02-23 |url=http://www.lapelpinsexpress.com/silkscreen.html |work= |publisher=Lapel Pin Express |date=2008-08-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090125032525/http://lapelpinsexpress.com/silkscreen.html |archivedate=2009-01-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A very thin epoxy coat protects the color material from scratching.

'''4-Color process'''&lt;br /&gt;
4-colors process, a.k.a. [[offset printing]], allows for bleeds and blends of colors, as is used in magazines. The colors are printed in the traditional CMYK process. This style is can be used for complex art and photo reproduction. An unlimited amount of colors can be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Printed Lapel Pins  | accessdate = 2009-02-23 | url = http://www.hilapelpins.com/printed-pins/printed-pins.htm | work = | publisher = Kunshan Huain Lapel Pins | date = 2009-01-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pin embellishments==
*'''Pin on pin''' – A pin is riveted on top of another pin to give the design a 3-D look.
*'''Dangler pin''' – Dangle pins have an extension to the base of the pin that dangles (hangs) from one or more small loops or chains.
*'''Bobble pin''' – A bobble pin is an upside-down dangler pin that uses a spring instead of a chain.
*'''Flocking''' – A flocked pin has an area that is fuzzy.
*'''Lenticular pin''' – A lenticular pin has two or more images that can change when it is tilted back and forth.
*'''LED pin''' – A LED is a light-up pin that flashes when activated. The light-up element has been used less in recent years due to difficulties in battery replacement and bulkiness.
*'''Slider pin''' – A slider pin has a movable piece that slides back and forth across the base of a pin.
*'''Spinner Pin''' – A spinner pin has a spinning mechanism that moves a piece of the pin 360 degrees.

==Backside==
The backside of a lapel pin holds the pin in place, and attachment pieces come in a variety of styles.&lt;ref&gt;Pins Clasps http://pins.com/support-m/pin-clasps&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''[[Clutch (pin fastener)|Butterfly clutch]]''' – One of the most popular modern methods of attaching pins is the butterfly clutch, sometimes called a military clutch. The back of the pin has a small prong attached and when the butterfly clutch is squeezed and pulled up from the prong the pin is released from the clutch. Butterfly clutches may be made out of metal, plastic, or rubber.
*'''Jewelry clutch''' – The jewelry clutch, or tie tack, is a simple but elegant design. The clutch locks into place when it covers the prong.
*'''Safety clasp''' – A safety clasp is similar to a safety pin in design. A long pin prong tucks under a small hook or clasp to hold the pin in place.
*'''Magnetic clasp''' – Magnetic clasps are composed of a small disc magnet that is attracted to another magnet that is attached to the back of the pin. Although this method is generally less secure, it is designed to prevent hole punctures in garments.
*'''Screw and nut''' – A screw and nut clasp is one of the most secure. The prong is threaded so that the nut screws into place to hold the pin firmly.
*'''Stick pin''' – A stick pin has a thin needle with a collar that slides up and down the needle to secure or release the pin.

==Additional markings==
[[File:UCLA pins on baseball cap.jpg|290px|right|thumb|UCLA lapel pins on a baseball cap]]

*'''Back stamp''' – A pin's back stamp contains information about the pin and can include copyright information and edition size.
*'''Artist proof''' – Artist proof pins (or AP pins) are created during a manufacturing run to verify quality. AP pins have a small AP stamped on their back. Some collectors value the AP markings, but most AP pins have minimal difference in secondary value because the markings are not normally visible.

'''Legislative violence''' broadly refers to any [[violence|violent]] clashes between members of a [[legislature]], often physically, inside the legislature and triggered by divisive issues and tight votes. Such clashes have occurred in many countries across time, and notable incidents still regularly occur.

Although the sight of brawling politicians is incongruous with a legislature's stately image, its occupants, like in any other workplace, are still prone to [[stress (biology)|stress]] and [[anger]]. The confrontational nature of politics, regardless of their location, and the high stakes involved often add to the simmering tensions.&lt;ref name="bbc 2004"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/3560977.stm "When politicians attack..."], [[BBC News]], March 23, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

All that is needed is an excuse, and that is too often found.}}

[[File:Vincenzo Camuccini - La morte di Cesare.jpg|upright=1.3|thumb|''Morte de Césare'' (Death of Caesar) by [[Vincenzo Camuccini]]]]
Roman general and [[Roman dictator|dictator]] [[Julius Caesar]] was famously [[Assassination of Julius Caesar|assassinated]] by a group of senators on the [[Ides of March]], 44 BC during a meeting of the [[Roman Senate]]. The senators, led by [[Gaius Cassius Longinus|Cassius]] and [[Marcus Junius Brutus|Brutus]] and calling themselves [[Liberatores]], had conspired in secret to kill Caesar and considered various ways to do so. Ultimately, they decided to kill him during a meeting of the senate, since only senators would be allowed in the meeting and Caesar would be alone. The senators drafted a fake petition requesting that Caesar hand over power to senate; Caesar called a meeting of the senate to read it. When Caesar met the senators at the [[Theatre of Pompey]], they stabbed him repeatedly with daggers concealed under their [[toga]]s, killing him. Caesar's assassination led to a [[civil war]] for control of the [[Roman Republic|republic]], ending ultimately with the rise of [[Augustus|Caesar Augustus]] and the founding of the [[Roman Empire]].

In January 1988, there was a riot in the [[Tamil Nadu]] state legislative assembly over a vote of majority for [[Janaki Ramachandran]], who was serving as [[Chief Minister (India)|Chief Minister]] following the death in December 1987 of her husband [[MGR]]. The [[ADMK]] party had split, with most [[Member of the Legislative Assembly (India)|MLAs]] supporting her and some supporting [[Jayalalithaa]]'s bid to become Chief Minister instead. The [[Indian National Congress|Congress]] party with its 60 MLAs was able to play "kingmaker".&lt;ref name="businessline"&gt;[http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/opinion/columns/rasheeda-bhagat/pepper-spray-pales-against-past-tn-assembly-events/article5690057.ece Both riots]&lt;/ref&gt; While the Congress-led Central Government in New Delhi ordered them to vote against Janaki, some Congress MLAs chose to resign instead, allowing the Janaki government to survive the majority vote. A riot ensued in the legislature, with members clubbing each other with microphone stands and footwear, which was finally ended by riot police who stormed the legislature and beat up everybody with their batons.&lt;ref name="businessline" /&gt; The Janaki faction was however dismissed by the Central Government under [[Article 356]] of the Indian Constitution, having survived just 24 days in office. The state was placed under [[President's rule]] for a year, until the next scheduled state assembly elections in January 1989.

During a dispute over the conduct of British soldiers on [[Bloody Sunday (1972)|Bloody Sunday]] on the day before, Independent Socialist MP [[Bernadette Devlin]] punched the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] Home Secretary [[Reginald Maudling]]. Her aggression was in response to the comments made by Maudling, who was maintaining that the British Army had fired at Bloody Sunday protesters in self-defence, contrary to the testimonies of civilian eyewitnesses (including Devlin herself). She argued that she was being denied the right to speak. Her actions resulted in her being banned from the House of Commons for six months.

In the aftermath of a rancorous debate with Labour MPs over the [[Aircraft and Shipbuilding Industries Act 1977|Aircraft and Shipbuilding Industries Bill]], Conservative [[Michael Heseltine]] was enraged by a group who began singing ''[[The Red Flag]]''. He seized the chamber's [[ceremonial mace]] and brandished it over his head, but was restrained by [[Jim Prior]], and after his departure legislative action was suspended for the day.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/82544.stm Mace – Commons]", BBC News, published December 22, 2005, accessed June 25, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== February 15th 1798 ===
[[File:Lyon-griswold-brawl.jpg|thumb|''Congressional Pugilists'', a 1798 political cartoon depicting the fight between Griswold and Lyon.]]
Federalist Congressman [[Roger Griswold]] of [[Connecticut]] attacked [[Vermont]] Representative [[Matthew Lyon]] with a [[hickory]] walking stick in the chambers of the [[United States House of Representatives]]. Griswold struck Lyon repeatedly about the head, shoulders and arms, while Lyon attempted to shield himself from the blows. Lyon then turned and ran to the fireplace, took up a pair of metal tongs, and having armed himself thus returned to the engagement. Griswold then tripped Lyon and struck him in the face while he lay on the ground, at which point the two were separated. After a break of several minutes, however, Lyon unexpectedly pursued Griswold again with the tongs, and the brawl was re-ignited.

The two men had a prior history of conflict. On January 30 of that year, Griswold had publicly insulted Lyon by calling him a coward, and Lyon had retaliated by spitting in Griswold's face. As a result of Lyon's actions in that case, he became the first Congressman to have charges filed against him with that body's ethics committee, although he escaped censure through a vote in the House.

John Wilson, the speaker of the [[Arkansas House of Representatives]] and president of the Arkansas Real Estate Bank, stabbed Representative J. J. Anthony to death during a legislative dispute on the floor of the chamber.&lt;ref&gt;Lindsey, William D.''Religion and Public Life in the Southern Crossroads: Showdown States'' Rowman Altamira, 2005,  pp.11&lt;/ref&gt; Anthony had suggested that bounties for the killing of wolves be administered by the president of the state bank, a responsibility comically beneath an official of Wilson's stature. Incensed, he drew a bowie knife and attacked Anthony, who was unable to defend himself despite drawing a knife of his own. Although Wilson was expelled from his office, he was later acquitted of murder.&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Joshua.''Washington'' Arcadia Publishing, 2014,  pp.14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Encyclopedia of Arkansas"&gt;[http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=2958   accessdate = February 19, 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Caning of Charles Sumner}}
Congressman [[Preston Brooks]] of [[South Carolina]] famously assaulted [[Charles Sumner]] of [[Massachusetts]] for a previous speech of his, saying his uncle [[Andrew Butler]] took "a mistress who, though ugly to others, is always lovely to him; though polluted in the sight of the world, is chaste in his sight—I mean, the harlot, Slavery."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

  | accessdate = March 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; After having consulted with fellow South Carolina Congressman [[Laurence Keitt]] on the situation, Brooks and Keitt decided that Sumner had the social status of a "drunkard" and was thus unworthy of the traditional challenge to a [[duelling|duel]]. Brooks (accompanied by Keitt), approached and confronted Sumner as he sat writing at his desk in the almost empty Senate chamber. As Sumner began to stand up, Brooks began beating Sumner severely on the head with a thick [[gutta-percha]] cane with a gold head before he could reach his feet. Sumner was knocked down and trapped under the heavy desk (which was bolted to the floor), but Brooks continued to bash Sumner until he ripped the desk from the floor. By this time, Sumner was blinded by his own blood, and he staggered up the aisle and collapsed, lapsing into unconsciousness. Brooks continued to beat the motionless Sumner until he broke his cane, then quietly left the chamber. Several other senators attempted to help Sumner, but were blocked by Keitt, who had jumped into the aisle, brandishing a pistol and shouting, "Let them be!"&lt;ref&gt;Donald, David Herbert ''Charles Sumner and the Coming Civil War'' New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1960, pp.293-96&lt;/ref&gt; Keitt was censured for his actions and resigned in protest, but was overwhelmingly re-elected to his seat by his South Carolina constituency within a month.&lt;ref name="bioguide.congress.gov"&gt;[http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=K000054 KEITT, Laurence Massillon, (1824–1864)]&lt;/ref&gt; For several decades following, Senators often carried walking [[Walking stick|canes]] and even [[revolver]]s in the Senate Chamber, fearing a similar assault.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

=== 5 February 1858 ===
Congressman Laurence Keitt of South Carolina was involved in another incident of legislative violence less than two years later, starting a massive brawl on the House floor during a tense late-night debate. Keitt became offended when [[Pennsylvania]] Congressman (and later [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]]) [[Galusha A. Grow]] stepped over to the Democratic side of the House chamber while delivering an anti-slavery speech. Keitt dismissively interrupted Grow's speech to demand he sit down, calling him a "black [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] puppy". Grow indignantly responded by telling Keitt that “No negro-driver shall crack his whip over me.” Keitt became enraged and went for Grow's throat, shouting that he would "choke him for that". A large brawl involving approximately 50 representatives erupted on the House floor, ending only when a missed punch from Rep. [[Cadwallader Washburn]] of [[Wisconsin]] upended the [[hairpiece]] of Rep. [[William Barksdale]] of [[Mississippi]]. The embarrassed Barksdale accidentally replaced the wig backwards, causing both sides to erupt in spontaneous laughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Filibuster | author=Allan L.

=== 5 April 1860 ===
During an anti-slavery speech by Illinois Republican [[Owen Lovejoy]] on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives on April 5, 1860, Lovejoy condemned the Democratic Party for its racist views and steadfast support of slavery. As Lovejoy gave his speech condemning the evils of slavery, several of the Democrats present in the audience, such as [[Roger Atkinson Pryor]], grew irate and incensed over Lovejoy's anti-slavery remarks and threatened him with physical harm, brandishing pistols and canes, with several Republicans rushing to Lovejoy's defense.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qMEv8DNXVbIC&amp;pg=PA193&amp;lpg=PA193&amp;dq=%22The+principle+of+enslaving+human+beings+because+they+are+inferior%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=YA6W9JoaPr&amp;sig=aO15r4OJEVD8bQUIjM34u42GjXg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiM9vuXwsrLAhWJeD4KHWvpAUcQ6AEIHjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%22The%20principle%20of%20enslaving%20human%20beings%20because%20they%20are%20inferior%22&amp;f=false|title=His Brother's Blood: Speeches and Writings, 1838–64|first1=Owen|last1=Lovejoy|first2=William Frederick|last2=Moore|first3=Jane Ann|last3=Moore|first4=Paul|last4=Simon|publisher=University of Illinois Press|location=Illinois|chapter=Debate on Slavery, Conducted under Hostile Conditions in Congress, April 5, 1860|pages=191–200|isbn=0-252-02919-4|date=2004|accessdate=March 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 24 February 1887 ===
The [[Indiana General Assembly]] experienced [[Black Day of the Indiana General Assembly|a massive brawl]] between Democrats and Republicans in the [[Indiana Senate]] and [[Indiana House of Representatives]]. The event began as an attempt by Democratic Governor [[Isaac P. Gray]] to be elected to the United States Senate and his own party’s attempt to thwart him. Gray was a former Republican who had been elected Governor by popular vote but was scorned as a turncoat by his new party, who maneuvered desperately (and unsuccessfully) to try to prevent his eligibility for the Senate seat. When Gray went over the head of the Democrats in arranging a [[midterm election]] for a new Lieutenant Governor, Republican Robert S. Robertson was elected with a majority of the popular vote, a situation the Democrats refused to accept despite a ruling from the [[Indiana Supreme Court]]. The matter came to a head when Robertson attempted to enter the Senate chamber to be sworn in and take his seat presiding over the session; he was attacked, beaten, and thrown bodily from the chamber by the Democrats, who then locked the chamber door, beginning four hours of intermittent mass brawling that spread throughout the [[Indiana Statehouse]]. The fight ended only after Republicans and Democrats began brandishing pistols and threatening to kill each other and the Governor was forced to deploy the [[Indianapolis Police Department]] to restore order. Subsequently, the Republican controlled House of Representatives refused to communicate with the Democratic Senate, ending the legislative session and leading to calls for United States Senators to be [[Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|elected by popular vote]].

=== 20 February 1902 ===
During a debate on a bill dealing with the [[Philippines|Philippine Islands]], Senator [[Benjamin Tillman]] of [[South Carolina]] accused Senator [[John L. McLaurin]] of South Carolina of "treachery" for siding with the Republicans in support of Philippine annexation, and alleged that McLaurin had been granted control of government patronage in South Carolina. Upon receiving word of this statement, McLaurin entered the Senate Chamber and denounced Tillman, upon which Tillman attacked him. During the fight, other senators were hit by the punches. As a result, the Senate went into closed session to debate the matter. Both senators apologized to the Senate, but almost came to blows immediately thereafter. On February 28, the Senate voted 54 to 12, with 22 abstentions, to [[Censure]] both Tillman and McLaurin. McLaurin did not seek reelection, while Tillman served in the Senate until 1918.

=== 4 March 1985 ===
On the House of Representatives chamber floor, Democrat [[Thomas Downey]] of New York confronted [[Robert Dornan]], a California Republican, and Dornan grabbed Downey's tie in response. Downey approached Dornan in response to a speech Downey had given two days earlier before the [[Conservative Political Action Conference]], in which he called Downey a "[[Draft evasion|draft-dodging]] wimp" because of Downey's repeated denouncement of US-backed antigovernment [[Contras]] rebels in [[Nicaragua]]. During the [[Vietnam War]], Downey received a medical deferment from the [[Conscription in the United States|draft]] because of a [[perforated eardrum]]. Downey had also been active in protesting the war. The Dornan-Downey beef originated two years earlier, when Downey spoke against Dornan's nomination for a position at the [[Arms Control and Disarmament Agency]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/lifestyle/1985/03/06/duel-on-the-hill/a66a3746-68c3-471a-8314-c9a30390dd46/|title=Duel on the Hill|last=Romano|first=Lois|date=1985-03-06|work=The Washington Post|access-date=2017-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Downey speech was made on Saturday, 2 March. On Monday afternoon, 4 March, Downey confronted Dornan, attracting dozens of viewers. Dornan claims Downey grabbed him by the shoulder and turned him around, asking if he had actually called him a wimp. Dornan answered "I did and you are." The exchange became heated, and at some point Dornan accused Downey of having cost him the job two years earlier. According to Downey, as he began to walk away, Dornan grabbed him by the tie and collar and threatened him with "bodily harm." Dornan claimed he was just straightening Downey's tie knot, saying later, "I like all the members to look elegant on the floor, you know." Dornan, according to himself and other witnesses, then told Downey to "get out of my face." After, Downey went to the [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] [[Tip O'Neill]] to tell him what had happened.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

After the incident, Downey released a statement and stated through a spokesman that he would not speak to reporters "until Dornan apologizes." His spokesman also said that Downey was considering filing a complaint with the [[Sergeant at Arms of the United States House of Representatives|House Sergeant at Arms]]. Several witnesses spoke about the incident. Democratic Congressman [[Mike Lowry]] said, "Dornan grabbed Downey roughly by the collar, and I mean aggressively. None of this straighten-the-tie baloney. And he told Downey, 'Don't let me catch you off the floor, where you are protected by the sergeant at arms.' I really think Downey restrained himself." Republican Representative [[Chris Smith (New Jersey politician)|Chris Smith]] of New Jersey, who witnessed the altercation, said, "I found it humorous that Downey had to run up to the Speaker when it was over to tell all. It was like a little classroom act . . . Very childish . . . I think he's made much to-do about nothing."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The day after the incident, House Speaker Tip O'Neill condemned the behavior, and said he told Dornan, "You can settle it on the street, but don't settle it on the House floor." He also told reporters that "discipline" would ensue if "anything like that" happened again. That day, Downey stated again, "Congressman Dornan owes me and the House of Representatives an apology." Dornan responded, "Apologize for what? For calling him a wimp? I am willing to concede that perhaps he just walks, talks and acts like a little arrogant wimp. But maybe it's disinformation. Maybe he really wears a black leather jacket by night that I don't know about."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Lhokpu''', also ''Lhobikha'' or ''Taba-Damey-Bikha'', is one of the autochthonous languages of [[Bhutan]] spoken by the [[Lhop people]]. It is spoken in southwestern Bhutan along the border of [[Samtse District|Samtse]] and [[Chukha District]]s. Van Driem (2003) leaves it unclassified as a separate branch within the [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan language family]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Driem|first1=George van|title=Languages of the Himalayas : an ethnolinguistic handbook of the greater Himalayan Region : containing an introduction to the symbiotic theory of language|date=2001|publisher=Brill|location=Leiden|isbn=978-9004103900}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
George van Driem (2001:804)&lt;ref&gt;van Driem, George. 2001. Languages of the Himalayas. Leiden: Brill&lt;/ref&gt; notes that Lhokpu, although unclassified, may be more closely related to the [[Kiranti languages]] than to [[Lepcha language|Lepcha]]. Gerber, et al. (2016)&lt;ref&gt;Gerber, Pascal, Tanja Gerber, Selin Grollmann. 2016. ''[https://www.academia.edu/30259338/Links_between_Lhokpu_and_Kiranti_some_observations Links between Lhokpu and Kiranti: some observations]''. Kiranti Workshop. CNRS Université Paris Diderot, 1-2 Dec 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; also notes a particularly close relationship between Lhokpu and Kiranti. Furthermore, van Driem (2001:804-805) notes that [[Dzongkha]], the national language of [[Bhutan]], may in fact have a Lhokpu [[substratum]].

Grollmann &amp; Gerber (2017)&lt;ref&gt;Grollmann, Selin and Pascal Gerber. 2017. ''[https://www.academia.edu/32861274/Linguistic_evidence_for_a_closer_relationship_between_Lhokpu_and_Dhimal Linguistic evidence for a closer relationship between Lhokpu and Dhimal: Including some remarks on the Dhimalish subgroup]''. Bern: University of Bern.&lt;/ref&gt; consider Lhokpu to have a particularly close relationship with [[Dhimal language|Dhimal]] and [[Toto language|Toto]].

==Name==
Lhokpu is spoken by the [[Lhop people|Lhop]]—a [[Dzongkha]] term meaning "Southerners"—, who "represent the aboriginal [gdung] Dung population of western Bhutan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Driem|first1=George van|title=Dzongkha = rdoṅ-kha|date=1998|publisher=Research School, CNWS|location=Leiden|isbn=978-9057890024|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Locations==
According to the ''[[Ethnologue]]'', Lhokpu is spoken in Damtey, Loto Kuchu, Lotu, Sanglong, Sataka, and Taba villages, located between Samtsi and Phuntsoling, in [[Samtse District]], [[Bhutan]].

==Culture==
The [[Lhop people]] are animists rather than Buddhists, burying their dead rather than cremating them as Buddhists do. Their society is [[matrilineal]] and [[matrilocal]].&lt;ref&gt;Gwendolyn Hyslop. 2016. Worlds of knowledge in Central Bhutan: Documentation of 'Olekha.

[[File:Entrevista de Guayaquil.jpg|thumb|The [[Guayaquil conference]] (1822) between [[Simón Bolívar]] and [[José de San Martín]], the greatest ''libertadores'' (liberators) of Spanish America.]]

'''''Libertadores''''' ({{IPA-es|liβeɾtaˈðoɾes|lang}}, {{IPA-pt|libeʁtaˈdoɾis|lang}}, "Liberators") refers to the principal leaders of the [[Latin American wars of independence]] from [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]]. They are named that way in contrast with the ''[[Conquistador]]s'', who were so far the only Spanish/Portuguese peoples recorded in the South American history.&lt;ref&gt;Pigna, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

They were largely bourgeois ''[[Criollo people|criollo]]s'' (local-born people of European, mostly of Spanish or Portuguese, ancestry) influenced by [[liberalism]] and in most cases with military training in the [[metropole]] ([[Motherland|mother country]]).

==Legacy==
The flags of [[Flag of Venezuela|Venezuela]], [[Flag of Colombia|Colombia]] and [[Flag of Ecuador|Ecuador]] follow Francisco de Miranda's design of 1806. Also, [[Bolivia]] was named after Bolivar, who in turn was president of Colombia, Peru, Bolivia and twice of Venezuela. San Martín served as "President Protector" of Peru.

In what today is part of Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Nicaragua and Costa Rica, Iturbide, a military leader revolted aginst the Viceroyalty of New Spain, founded an indepent nation where he accended as Emperor Aguistin I.

The names of ''libertadores'' are used all over South America to name anything from towns and places to institutions and sports clubs. Also, the most prestigious international club football competition in South America is named the [[Copa Libertadores]] in their honour.

The '''Limestone Tombs of Kamhantik''' is an excavated remains of a thousand-year-old [[barangay]] (a term used to connote a polity during the classical era) found in the jungles of Mount Maclayao in Sitio Kamhantik within the [[Buenavista Protected Landscape]] of [[Mulanay]], [[Quezon]], [[Philippines]]. It is widely believed that pre-colonial [[Tagalog people]] were responsible for the creation of the tombs.

It is composed of fifteen limestone coffins that can be dated back from the period of 10th to 14th century based on one of [[National Museum of the Philippines|National Museum]]'s top archaeologist "a complex archaeological site with both habitation and burial remains from the period of approximately 10th to the 14th century ... the first of its kind in the Philippines having carved limestone tombs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1,000-year-old village found in Philippines|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/philippines/9556537/1000-year-old-village-found-in-Philippines.html|website=telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=May 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, after carbon-dating the human bones found on the site, it was known that the age of the site is much older, between 890-1030 AD.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tK2sjO7GHkI&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery==
The archaeological site is part of 280 hectares (692 acres) of forest land that was declared a government-protected area in 1998 to keep away treasure hunters and slash-and-burn farmers. Treasure hunters looking for gold exposed some of the limestone tombs years ago, but it was only in 2011 that [[Manila]]-based archaeologists started to unearth the graves and artifacts and realize the significance of the find. Numerous fragments with peculiar inscriptions were found throughout the site. Experts noted that the tombs used to have lids that were most likely decorated with various pre-colonial designs. However, the lids, skeletons, and other death goods that were suppose to be within the tombs have already been taken by treasure hunters before scientists managed to fully study the site. Locals at the foothills of the mountain have cited white-skinned foreigners who went to the mountains years ago as the likely culprits. The National Museum of the Philippines deemed that the stolen Filipino treasures may now be in private collections or museums around the world, without anyone knowing that they were illegally taken from the Philippines and its people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Remains of 1,000-year old village unearthed in Philippines|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/remains-1-000-year-old-village-unearthed-philippines-article-1.1163639|website=NYDailyNews|accessdate=May 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The site is the focal property of the Buenavista Protected Landscape, which is being nominated by locals in the tentative list of the Philippines for designation in the [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage List]]. 

Past archaeological discoveries have shown Filipinos of that era used wooden coffins in the country's mountainous north and earthen coffins and jars elsewhere, according to Dizon, who has done extensive archaeological work and studies in the Philippines and 27 other countries over the past 35 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/remains-1-000-year-old-village-unearthed-philippines-article-1.1163639|title=Remains of 1,000-year old village unearthed in Philippines|last=|first=|date=September 20, 2012|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mythology==
It is widely believed by the locals of Lumanay (the town encompassing the archaeological site) that the Kamhantik tombs were built by their Tagalog ancestors with the help from enchanted beings, called anitos, sent by Bathala, the supreme deity of the Tagalog ethnic people. Prior to scientific discovery, the ruins were already much known to the Lumanay townsfolk, and they consider the ruins as one of the most sacred places for the anitos, and therefore, a [[dambana]]. Due to this belief, it was only recently when the area was known to scientists. The townsfolk do not traverse the area much as they considered it too sacred, and they might disturb the anitos living within the forest and the ruins, the reason why the area was looted by white foreigners without the knowledge of the townsfolk. It was only discovered in 2011 that the area has been looted. All sarcophagi seals of the tombs were taken away, along with all sacred objects and almost all bone fragments inside the tombs.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tK2sjO7GHkI&lt;/ref&gt;

Members contribute their own ideas and projects which are discussed with the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.azcentral.com/story/money/business/2014/10/25/local-motors-printing-car-chandler/17941815/|title=Local Motors makes crowd-sourced and 3-D cars|access-date=2016-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Co-creation is a technique used by Local Motors, [[General Electric]], and [[Lego|LEGO]] to enhance new product development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/joannmuller/2015/07/01/big-ideas-small-scale-how-ge-is-using-the-wisdom-of-crowds-to-design-better-appliances/#10903f7b76dd|title=Big Ideas, Small Scale: How GE Is Using The Wisdom Of Crowds To Design Better Appliances|last=Muller|first=Joann|access-date=2016-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://leaderlab.com/lego-open-innovation-co-creation-and-mass-customization/|title=Network meeting 25/11: LEGO engaging consumers in Open innovation, co-creation and mass-customization. {{!}} Leaderlab|website=leaderlab.com|access-date=2016-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Select organizations have partnered with the company to facilitate co-creation of their products including [[United States Army|US Army]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ref.army.mil/news3_cocreate.html|title=REF Rapid Equipping Force - United States Army|website=www.ref.army.mil|access-date=2016-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Domino's Pizza|Domino’s]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/dalebuss/2015/10/21/dominos-gets-into-the-car-business-with-dpx-pizza-delivery-vehicle/#39e77a6e4724|title=Domino's Gets Into the Car Business With DXP Pizza-Delivery Vehicle|last=Buss|first=Dale|access-date=2016-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Airbus Group, Inc.|Airbus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popsci.com/airbus-drone-design-contest-winners|title=Look At These Wild Drone Concepts Airbus Thinks Are The Future|access-date=2016-07-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local Motors uses Co-designing type of customer co-creation in which the selective process is made by its community and some features such as frame and structure are scoped by the company. Firstly, users create drawing designs and the decorative ideas on their own style. Although the users are novices or experts, all users can participate in this step. After that users present their designs on the website, the best design selected by people in the community will be developed by the company. Finally, the company will launch the co-designing car into the market. Using Co-creation method, company gains customer’s engagement and loyalty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cattaleeya.com/2017/01/04/local-motors/|title=" Local Motors " New generation of product co-creation – Cattaleeya|access-date=2017-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the biggest community driven competitions was hosted by Local Motors in collaboration with [[Airbus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cocreate.localmotors.com/blog/post/meet-the-judges-for-the-airbus-cargo-drone-challenge/2044/|title=Meet the judges for the Airbus Cargo Drone Challenge {{!}} Local Motors|date=2016-06-06|language=en-us|access-date=2016-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Propositions==
The propositions that Local Motors offer are:

- The car is produced and designed using the co-designing type of co-creation, which is called crowdsourcing.
- The car was produced in 18 months, which is faster than the usual process by five times.
- They are road legal cars.
- The wheels are strong off-road wheels and are grade 8, which are used in the military.
- About $ 3 million was spent to develop the car, which is less than the amount spent on commercial models by the automakers. The company achieved to spend about 3 million dollars by rethinking the car’s features, so they designed a five-point seat belt, which costs $10, instead of developing an airbag, which will cost them $6 million.

'''Local eGovernment''' is [[eGovernment]] as it relates to [[local government]], police, fire, national park and transport authorities.

== Local eGovernment in England ==
The [[UK government]]’s objective was that all of public services in [[England]] should be capable of being delivered electronically by 31 December 2005. The ''Modernising Government'' White Paper of March 1999 proposed "all dealings with government being deliverable electronically by 2008." Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] then announced on 30 March 2000 that the target date had been brought forward from 2008 to 2005.

Electronic delivery is defined as delivery through internet protocols and other ICT methods and includes delivery by telephone if the officer receiving the call can access electronic information and/or update records online there and then.

The average local authority achieved a reported 97% e-enablement by 31 December 2005, though it is suspected the actual figure is much lower.  The target also applied to the Civil Service, which achieved a reported 96%.

=== Objectives and performance management ===
==== Implementing Electronic Government (IEG) Statements ====
From December 2001 to April 2006 local authorities were required to publish an ''IEG Statement'' on their degree of e-enablement (electronic enablement). The measures include BVPI 157 and the Priority Outcomes.

==== Best Value Performance Indicator (BVPI) 157 ====
BVPI 157 measures the percentage of 'interactions' provided by a local authority that are e-enabled. The figure must be published annually as part of the Best Value performance management framework. The figure is calculated by considering the following ten types of interaction as they apply to the services provided by the local authority:
*providing information
*collecting revenue
*providing benefits and grants
*consultation
*regulation (such as issuing licences)
*applications for services
*booking venues, resources and courses
*paying for goods and services
*providing access to community, professional or business networks
*procurement
Local authorities may use a proprietary list of services, but are required to validate their list against the ''Local Government Services List'' (LGSL).
BVPI 157 forms part of the annual IEG statement.

==== Priority Outcomes ====
To guide local authorities in implementing eGovernment, the Department for Transport, Local Government and the Regions (and its successor the Office of the Deputy Prime Minister (ODPM)) issued a list of key targets, most commonly referred to as the Priority Outcomes or PSOs (Priority Service Outcomes). The list was issued in the snappily entitled document ''Defining E-government Outcomes for 2005 to Support the Delivery of Priority Services &amp; National Strategy Transformation Agenda for Local Authorities in England – Version 1.0''.
In September 2004, detailed guidance on the Priority Outcomes was issued in the document ''Priority Outcomes - Explanatory Notes for Practitioners'', published  by the IDeA (Improvement and Development Agency) and endorsed by the ODPM.

Priority Outcomes are rated with three levels of obligation:
*''Required'' = To be implemented (available for use) by Dec 2005
*''Good'' = To be approved for funding and being actively implemented by Dec 2005 and implemented by April 1, 2006
*''Excellent'' = Voluntary for authorities that have implemented required and good outcomes early.

The following technologies are recommended in Priority Outcomes: Explanatory Notes for Practitioners as those likely to be essential in the achievement of the Priority Outcomes:
*[[Customer relationship management]] system:
**Customer database (single view of info on each customer, citizen and business)
**Customer tracking (across access channels and from contact to resolution)
**Data warehousing (central repository for data, including legacy data)
*[[Middleware]] and [[web services]] (manages flow of data between all systems, including external)
*[[Document management system]]:
**Workflow, messaging and e-forms (gets work to the right people at the right time)
**Document and records management (e-storage of all documents and info)
*[[Content management]] (system for publishing of content to all access channels)
*Security, [[authentication]] and [[smartcard]]s (for security of information)
*e-Payments (system for receiving payments to the council)
*[[e-procurement|e-Procurement]] (system for internal/external buying processes)
*[[Geographic information system|Geographic Information System]] (GIS) (access to geographical data through maps)
*Local land and property gazetteer (database of land and property information)
*Access channels (websites, call centres, [[internet kiosk|kiosks]], [[digital TV]], mobile phones, etc.)

==== Socitm Insight Better Connected reports ====
Local authority websites are also subject to assessments by Socitm (Society of Information Technology Management) Insight in their annual ''Better Connected'' reports.

'''Low German''' or '''Low Saxon''' (Low German of Germany: ''Plattdütsch, Plattdüütsch, Plattdütsk, Plattdüütsk, Plattduitsk, Plattduitsch, Plattdietsch'' or ''Neddersassisch'' or ''Nedderdüütsch''; [[Dutch Low Saxon|Low Saxon of the Netherlands]]: ''Nedersaksies''; [[German language|High German]]: ''Plattdeutsch, Niedersächsisch'' or ''Niederdeutsch'' (in a stricter sense); {{lang-nl|Nederduits}}; (also other dialectal variants)) is a [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic language]] spoken mainly in [[Northern Germany]] and the northeastern part of the [[Netherlands]]. It is also spoken to a lesser extent in the [[German diaspora]] worldwide (e.g. [[Plautdietsch]]).

Low German is most closely related to [[Frisian languages|Frisian]] and [[English language|English]], with which it forms the [[Ingvaeonic languages|Ingvaeonic]] group of the West Germanic languages. Like [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ([[Istvaeonic languages|Istvaeonic]]), it is spoken north of the [[Benrath line|Benrath]] and [[Uerdingen line|Uerdingen]] [[isogloss]]es, while (Standard) [[German language|German]] ([[Irminonic languages|Irminonic]]) is spoken south of those lines. Like Frisian, English, Dutch and the [[North Germanic languages]], Low German has not undergone the [[High German consonant shift]], as opposed to German.

The Low German dialects spoken in the Netherlands are mostly referred to as Low Saxon, those spoken in northwestern Germany ([[Lower Saxony]], [[Westphalia]], [[Schleswig-Holstein]], [[Hamburg]], and [[Bremen (state)|Bremen]]) as either Low German or Low Saxon, and those spoken in northeastern Germany ([[Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania]], [[Saxony-Anhalt]], and [[Brandenburg]]) mostly as Low German. This is because northwestern Germany and the northeastern Netherlands were the area of settlement of the [[Saxons]], while Low German spread to northeastern Germany through eastward migration of Low German-speakers.

It has been estimated that Low German has approximately 6.7 million native speakers – 5 million in Germany, primarily Northern Germany,&lt;ref name="Gechattet wird auf Plattdeusch"/&gt; and 1.7 million in the Netherlands.&lt;ref name=TOLoE/&gt; A 2005 study by H. Bloemhof, ''Taaltelling Nedersaksisch'', showed 1.8 million spoke it daily in the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;Bloemhoff, H. (2005). Taaltelling Nedersaksisch.

Numbers of speakers of their children dropped in the same period from 8% to 2%.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.its-nijmegen.nl/pdf/NTR12%20dialect1995-2011.pdf|title=Ontwikkelingen in het gebruik van Fries, streektalen en dialecten in de periode 1995-2011|last=Driessen|first=Geert|date=2012|website=Radboud University Nijmegen|access-date=2017-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Variants of Low German are spoken in most parts of [[Northern Germany]], for instance in the states of [[Lower Saxony]], [[North Rhine-Westphalia]], [[Hamburg]], [[Bremen]], [[Schleswig-Holstein]], [[Mecklenburg-Vorpommern]], [[Saxony-Anhalt]], and [[Brandenburg]]. Small portions of northern [[Hesse]] and northern [[Thuringia]] are traditionally Low Saxon-speaking too.
Historically, Low German was also spoken in formerly German parts of [[Poland]] as well as in [[East Prussia]] and the [[Baltic States]] of [[Estonia]] and [[Latvia]]. The [[Baltic Germans]] spoke a distinct Low German dialect, which has influenced the [[Estonian vocabulary#Tables of word origin|vocabulary]] and phonetics of both [[Estonian language|Estonian]] and [[Latvian language|Latvian]] languages.
The historical {{lang|de|[[Sprachraum]]}} of Low German also included contemporary northern [[Poland]], [[East Prussia]] (the modern [[Kaliningrad Oblast]] of [[Russia]]), a part of western [[Lithuania]], and the [[Baltic Germans|German communities]] in the Baltic states, most notably the [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic]] cities of modern [[Latvia]] and [[Estonia]]. German speakers in this area fled the [[Red Army]] or were [[Flight and expulsion of Germans (1944–50)|forcibly expelled]] after the border changes at the end of [[World War II]].

The language was also formerly spoken in the outer areas of what is now the city-state of [[Berlin]], but in the course of urbanisation and national centralisation in that city, the language has vanished (the Berlin dialect itself is a northern outpost of [[High German languages|High German]], though it has some Low German features). Under the name ''Low Saxon'', there are speakers in the Dutch north-eastern provinces of [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]], [[Drenthe]], [[Stellingwarfs|Stellingwerf]] (part of [[Friesland]]), [[Overijssel]], and [[Gelderland]], in several dialect groups per province.

Today, there are still speakers outside Germany and the Netherlands to be found in the coastal areas of present-day [[Poland]] (minority of [[ethnic German]] [[East Pomeranian dialect|East Pomeranian]] speakers who were not expelled from [[Province of Pomerania (1815–1945)|Pomerania]], as well as the regions around [[Braniewo]]).{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} In the Southern [[Jutland]] region of Denmark there may still be some Low German speakers in some [[German as a minority language|German minority]] communities, but the Low German and [[North Frisian language|North Frisian]] dialects of [[Denmark]] can be considered [[Moribund language|moribund]] at this time.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

===Outside Europe and the Mennonites===
{{Main|Plautdietsch|East Low German}}

There are also immigrant communities where Low German is spoken in the Western hemisphere, including [[Canada]], the [[United States]], [[Mexico]], [[Belize]], [[Venezuela]], [[Bolivia]], [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]], [[Paraguay]] and [[Uruguay]]. In some of these countries, the language is part of the [[Mennonite]] religion and culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Platdietsch |accessdate=2008-02-29 |date=2008-01-27 |url=http://www.plautdietsch.ca/}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are Mennonite communities in [[Ontario]], [[Saskatchewan]], [[Alberta]], [[British Columbia]], [[Manitoba]], Kansas and [[Minnesota]] which use Low German in their religious services and communities. These Mennonites are descended from primarily Dutch settlers that had initially settled in the [[Vistula delta]] region of [[Prussia]] in the 16th and 17th centuries before moving to newly-acquired [[Russia]]n territories in [[Ukraine]] in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, and then to the [[Americas]] in the 19th and early 20th centuries. The types of Low German spoken in these communities and in the [[Midwest]] region of the [[United States]] have diverged since emigration. The survival of the language is tenuous in many places, and has died out in many places where assimilation has occurred. Members and friends of the Historical Society of North German Settlements in Western New York ([[Bergholz, New York|Bergholz, NY]]), a community of Lutherans who trace their immigration from Pomerania in the 1840s, hold quarterly "Plattdeutsch lunch" events, where remaining speakers of the language gather to share and preserve the dialect. Mennonite colonies in [[Paraguay]], [[Belize]], and [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]], [[Mexico]] have made Low German a "co-official language" of the community.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

==Nomenclature==
There are different uses of the term "Low German":

#A specific name of any [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic]] [[variety (linguistics)|varieties]] that neither have taken part in the [[High German consonant shift]] nor classify as [[Low Franconian languages|Low Franconian]] or [[Anglo-Frisian languages|Anglo-Frisian]]; this is the scope discussed in this article.
#A broader term for the closely related, continental [[West Germanic languages]] unaffected by the High German consonant shift, nor classifying as [[Anglo-Frisian languages|Anglo-Frisian]], and thus including [[Low Franconian]] varieties spoken in Germany such as Kleverlandish, but not those in the Netherlands, thus excluding [[Dutch language|Dutch]].

In Germany, native speakers of Low German call their language {{lang|nds|Platt}}, {{lang|nds|Plattdüütsch}} or {{lang|nds|Nedderdüütsch}}. In the Netherlands, native speakers refer to their language as {{lang|nds|dialect}}, {{lang|nds|plat}}, {{lang|nds|nedersaksies}}, or the name of their village, town or district.

Officially, Low German is called {{lang|de|Niederdeutsch}} (Nether or Low German) by the German authorities and {{lang|nl|Nedersaksisch}} (Nether or Low Saxon) by the Dutch authorities. {{lang|de|Plattdeutsch}}, {{lang|de|Niederdeutsch}} and {{lang|nl|Platduits}}, {{lang|nl|Nedersaksisch}} are seen in linguistic texts from the German and Dutch linguistic communities respectively.

In Danish it is called {{lang|da|Plattysk}}, {{lang|da|Nedertysk}} or, rarely, {{lang|da|Lavtysk}}. Mennonite Low German is called {{lang|pdt|[[Plautdietsch language|Plautdietsch]]}}.

"Low" refers to the flat plains and coastal area of the [[Northern European Lowlands|northern European lowlands]], contrasted with the mountainous areas of central and southern Germany, [[Switzerland]], and [[Austria]], where [[High German languages|High German]] (Highland German) is spoken.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. the definition of ''high'' in the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (Concise Edition): "[…] situated far above ground, sea level, etc; upper, inland, '''as […] High German'''".&lt;/ref&gt; Etymologically however, ''Platt'' meant "clear" in the sense of a language the simple people could understand. In Dutch and German, the word {{lang|nl|Plat}} can also mean "improper", "rude" or "too simple" which is why the term is not popular in the Netherlands.

The colloquial term {{lang|de|Platt}} denotes both Low German dialects and any non-[[standard language|standard]] Western variety of [[German language|German]]; this use is chiefly found in northern and Western Germany and is not considered to be [[linguistics|linguistically]] correct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philhist.uni-augsburg.de/lehrstuehle/germanistik/sprachwissenschaft/ada/runde_1/f20/|title=Mundart/Platt|website=www.philhist.uni-augsburg.de|accessdate=6 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[ISO 639-2]] language code for Low German (Low Saxon) has been '''nds''' ({{lang|de|'''n'''ie'''d'''er'''s'''ächsisch}} or {{lang|nl|'''n'''e'''d'''er'''s'''aksisch, '''n'''e'''d'''der'''s'''assisch}}) since May 2000.

== Classification ==
Low German is a part of the continental [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic]] [[dialect continuum]]. To the West, it blends into the [[Low Franconian languages]], including [[Dutch language|Dutch]]. A distinguishing feature between the Southern Low Franconian varieties and Low German varieties is the plural of the verbs. Low German varieties have a common verbal plural ending, whereas Southern Low Franconian varieties have a different form for the second person plural. Northern Low Franconian varieties, including standard [[Dutch language|Dutch]], have also developed a common verbal plural ending.

To the South, Low German blends into the [[High German languages|High German]] dialects of [[Central German]] that have been affected by the [[High German consonant shift]]. The division is usually drawn at the [[Benrath line]] that traces the ''{{lang|nds|maken}} – {{lang|de|machen}}'' [[isogloss]].

To the East, it abuts the [[Kashubian language]] (the only remnant of the [[Pomeranian language]]) and, since the expulsion of nearly all Germans from the Polish part of [[Pomerania]] following the Second World War, also by the [[Polish language]]. 
[[East Pomeranian dialect|East Pomeranian]] and [[Central Pomeranian dialect|Central Pomeranian]] are dialects of Low German.

To the North and Northwest, it abuts the [[Danish language|Danish]] and the [[Frisian languages]]. Note that in Germany, Low German has replaced the Frisian languages in many regions. [[Saterland Frisian language|Saterland Frisian]] is the only remnant of East Frisian language and is surrounded by Low German, as are the few remaining [[North Frisian language|North Frisian]] varieties, and the Low German dialects of those regions have influences from Frisian substrates.

Some classify the northern dialects of Low German together with [[English language|English]] and [[Frisian languages|Frisian]] as the ''[[North Sea]] Germanic'' or ''[[Ingaevones|Ingvaeonic]]'' languages. However, most exclude Low German from that group often called [[Anglo-Frisian languages]] because some distinctive features of that group of languages are only partially observed in Low German, for instance the [[Ingvaeonic nasal spirant law]]  (some dialects have ''us'', {{lang|gml|os}} for "us" whereas others have {{lang|de|uns}}, {{lang|nl|ons}}), and because other distinctive features do not occur in Low German at all, for instance the [[palatalization (sound change)|palatalization]] of /k/ (compare palatalized forms such as English ''cheese'', Frisian {{lang|fy|tsiis}} to non-palatalized forms such as Low German {{lang|nds|Kees}} or {{lang|nds|Kaise}}, Dutch {{lang|nl|kaas}}, German {{lang|de|Käse}}).

=== A language or a mere dialect? ===
The question of whether Low German, as spoken today, should be considered a separate language, rather than a dialect of [[German language|German]] or even [[Dutch language|Dutch]], has been a point of contention. [[Linguistics]] offers no simple, generally accepted criterion to decide this question.

Scholarly arguments have been put forward in favour of classifying Low German as a German dialect.&lt;ref&gt;J. Goossens: "Niederdeutsche Sprache. Versuch einer Definition", in: J. Goossens (ed.), ''Niederdeutsch. Sprache und Literatur'', vol. 1, Neumünster 1973.&lt;/ref&gt; As said, these arguments are not linguistic but rather socio-political and build mainly around the fact that Low German has no official standard form or use in sophisticated media. The situation of Low German may thus be considered a "pseudo-dialectized [[Ausbausprache, Abstandsprache and Dachsprache|abstand language]]" ("scheindialektisierte Abstandsprache").&lt;ref&gt;W. Sanders: ''Sachsensprache — Hansesprache — Plattdeutsch. Sprachgeschichtliche Grundzüge des Niederdeutschen'', Göttingen 1982, p. 32, paraphrasing [[Heinz Kloss]]: "Abstandsprachen und Ausbausprachen", in: J. Göschel et al. (edd.), ''Zur Theorie des Dialekts'', Wiesbaden 1976, pp. 301–322.&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, [[Old Saxon]] and [[Middle Low German]] are generally considered separate languages in their own rights. Since Low German has undergone a strong decline since the 18th century, the perceived similarities with High German or Dutch may often be direct adaptations from the dominating standard language, resulting in a growing incapability of speakers to speak correctly what was once Low German proper.&lt;ref&gt;Hubertus Menke: "Niederdeutsch: Eigenständige Sprache oder Varietät einer Sprache?", in: Eva Schmitsdorf et al. (edd.), ''Lingua Germanica. Studien zur deutschen Philologie. Jochen Splett zum 60. Geburtstag'', Waxmann, Münster et al. 1998, pp. 171–184, in particular p. 180.&lt;/ref&gt;

Others have argued for the independence of today's Low German dialects, taken as continuous outflow of the Old Saxon and Middle Low German tradition.&lt;ref&gt;Hubertus Menke: "Niederdeutsch: Eigenständige Sprache oder Varietät einer Sprache?", in: Eva Schmitsdorf et al. (edd.), ''Lingua Germanica. Studien zur deutschen Philologie. Jochen Splett zum 60. Geburtstag'', Waxmann, Münster et al. 1998, pp. 171–184, in particular p. 183f.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Legal status ===
Low German has been recognized by the Netherlands and by Germany (since 1999) as a [[regional language]] according to the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]]. Within the official terminology defined in the charter, this status would not be available to a dialect of an official language (as per article 1a), and hence not to Low German in Germany if it were considered a dialect of German. Advocates of the promotion of Low German have expressed considerable hope that this political development will at once lend legitimacy to their claim that Low German is a separate language, and help mitigate the functional limits{{clarify|date=July 2017}} of the language that may still be cited as objective criteria for a mere dialect (such as the virtually complete absence from legal and administrative contexts, schools, the media, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [http://www.ins-bremen.de/de/sprache/politik.html Institut für niederdeutsche Sprache – Sprachenpolitik]&lt;/ref&gt;

At the request of [[Schleswig-Holstein]], the German government has declared Low German as a [[regional language]]. German offices in Schleswig-Holstein are obliged to accept and handle applications in Low German on the same footing as Standard High German applications.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schleswig-holstein.de/DE/Landesregierung/I/_startseite/Artikel/2016/Material_2016/160609_Sprachencharta_Material/160609_Sprachenchartabericht.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&amp;v=1 Sprachenchartabericht of the regional government of Schleswig-Holstein for 2016], p. 14 f.&lt;/ref&gt; The {{lang|de|[[Bundesgerichtshof]]}} ruled in a case that this was even to be done at the patent office in [[Munich]], in a [[Bavaria|non–Low German region]], when the applicant then had to pay the charge for a translator,&lt;ref&gt;Cf. the German Wikipedia article on [[:de:Niederdeutsche Sprache#Stellung des Niederdeutschen|Niederdeutsche Sprache]].&lt;/ref&gt; because applications in Low German are considered "{{lang|de|nicht in deutscher Sprache abgefasst}}" (not written in the German language).

==History==
{{Main|History of Low German}}

===Old Saxon===
{{Main|Old Saxon}}
'''Old Saxon''', also known as '''Old Low German''', is a [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic]] language. It is documented from the 9th century until the 12th century, when it evolved into [[Middle Low German]]. It was spoken on the north-west coast of Germany and in [[Denmark]] (Schleswig-Holstein) by [[Saxon people]]s. It is closely related to Old [[Anglo-Frisian]] ([[Old Frisian]], [[Old English]]),  partially participating in the [[Ingvaeonic nasal spirant law]].

Only a few texts survive, predominantly in baptismal vows the Saxons were required to perform at the behest of [[Charlemagne]]. The only literary texts preserved are ''[[Heliand]]'' and the [[Old Saxon Genesis]].

===Middle Low German===
{{Main|Middle Low German}}
The Middle Low German language is an ancestor of modern Low German. It was spoken from about 1100 to 1600. The neighbouring languages within the [[dialect continuum]] of the [[West Germanic languages]] were [[Middle Dutch]] in the West and [[Middle High German]] in the South, later substituted by [[Early New High German]]. Middle Low German was the [[lingua franca]] of the [[Hanseatic League]], spoken all around the [[North Sea]] and the [[Baltic Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;Sanders, W. (1982) Sachsensprache, Hansesprache, Plattdeutsch. Sprachgeschichtliche Grundzüge des Niederdeutschen. Göttingen: Vandenhoeck &amp; Rupprecht.&lt;/ref&gt; It had a significant influence on the [[Scandinavian languages]]. Based on the language of [[Lübeck]], a standardized written language was developing, though it was never codified.

===Contemporary===
There is a distinction between the [[Germany|German]] and the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] Low Saxon/Low German situation.

====Germany====
After mass education in [[Germany]] in the 19th and 20th centuries, the slow decline which Low German had been experiencing since the end of the [[Hanseatic League]] turned into a free fall. The decision to exclude Low German in formal education was not without controversy, however. On one hand, proponents of Low German advocated that since it had a strong cultural and historical value and was the native language of students in northern Germany, it had a place in the classroom. On the other hand, High German was considered the language of education, science, and national unity, and since schools promoted these values, High German was seen as the best candidate for the language of instruction.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Langer, Nils and Robert Langhanke|title=How to Deal with Non-Dominant Languages – Metalingusitic Discourses on Low German in the Nineteenth Century|journal=Linguistik Online|volume=58.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, regional languages and dialects were thought to limit the intellectual ability of their speakers. Because of Low German’s archaic features and constructions, historical linguists considered it “backwards.” It wasn’t until the efforts of proponents such as Klaus Groth that this impression changed. Groth’s publications demonstrated that Low German was a valuable language in its own right, and he was able to convince others that Low German was suitable for literary arts and was a national treasure worth keeping.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Through the works of advocates like Groth, both proponents and opponents of Low German in formal education saw the language’s innate value as the cultural and historical language of northern Germany. Nevertheless, the opponents claimed that it should simply remain a spoken and informal language to be used on the street and in the home, but not in formal schooling. According to them, it simply did not match the nationally unifying power of High German. As a result, while Low German literature was deemed worthy of being taught in school, High German was chosen as the language of scholarly instruction. With High German the language of education and Low German the language of the home and daily life, a stable diglossia developed in Northern Germany.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Various Low German dialects are understood by 10 million people, but many fewer are [[Native language|native speakers]]. Total users in all countries are 301,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Low Saxon|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/language/nds|website=Ethnologue|accessdate=28 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[KDE]] project supports Low German (nds) as a language for its computer desktop environment,&lt;ref&gt;http://l10n.kde.org/stats/gui/trunk-kde4/nds/ {{Dead link|date=April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; as does the [[GNOME]] Desktop Project. [[Open-source software|Open source]] software has been translated into Low German; this used to be coordinated via a page on Sourceforge,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120701012935/http://nds.sourceforge.net/|title=Linux op Platt|date=1 July 2012|publisher=|accessdate=6 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; but as of 2015, the most active project is that of KDE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nds.i18n.kde.org/|title=Hartlich willkamen bi KDE op Platt|website=nds.i18n.kde.org|accessdate=6 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Netherlands====
In the early 20th century, scholars in the Netherlands argued that speaking dialects hindered language acquisition, and it was therefore strongly discouraged. As education improved, and mass communication became more widespread, the Low Saxon dialects further declined, although decline has been greater in urban centres of the Low Saxon regions. When in 1975 dialect folk and rock bands such as [[Normaal]] and {{ill|Boh Foi Toch|nl}} became successful with their overt disapproval of what they experienced as "misplaced Dutch snobbery" and the Western Dutch contempt for (speakers of) Low Saxon dialects, they gained a following among the more rurally oriented inhabitants, launching Low Saxon as a sub-culture. They inspired contemporary dialect artists and rock bands, such as {{ill|Daniël Lohues|nl}}, {{ill|Mooi Wark|Nl}}, {{ill|Jovink en de Voederbietels|Nl}}, {{ill|Hádiejan|Nl}}
Nonetheless, the position of the language is vulnerable according to UNESCO.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Between 1995 and 2011 the numbers of speakers among parents dropped from 34% in 1995 to 15% in 2011. Numbers of speakers of their children dropped in the same period from 8% to 2%.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Low Saxon is still spoken more widely than in Northern Germany. A 2005 study showed that in the [[Tweante]] region 62% of the inhabitants used Low Saxon daily, and up to 75% regularly.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017|reason=apart from missing a source for this statement, the number of speakers in the Twente region may not be representative for the numbers elsewhere in the Low Saxon dialect area.}} Efforts are made in Germany and in the Netherlands to protect Low German as a [[regional language]].

==Sound change==
As with the [[Anglo-Frisian language]]s and the [[North Germanic languages]], Low German has not been influenced by the [[High German consonant shift]] except for old {{IPA|/ð/}} having shifted to {{IPA|/d/}}. Therefore, a lot of Low German words sound similar to their English counterparts. One feature that does distinguish Low German from English generally is final devoicing of obstruents, as exemplified by the words 'good' and 'wind' below. This is a characteristic of Dutch and German as well and involves positional neutralization of voicing contrast in the coda position for obstruents (i.e. t = d at the end of a syllable.) This is not used in English except in the [[Yorkshire dialect]], where there is a process known as ''[[Yorkshire assimilation]]''.&lt;ref&gt;See John Wells, ''Accents of English'', pages 366-7, Cambridge University Press, 1981&lt;/ref&gt;

For instance: ''water'' {{IPA|[wɒtɜ, ˈwatɜ, ˈwætɜ]}}, ''later'' {{IPA|[ˈlɒːtɜ, ˈlaːtɜ, ˈlæːtɜ]}}, ''bit'' {{IPA|[bɪt]}}, ''dish'' {{IPA|[dis, diʃ]}}, ''ship'' {{IPA|[ʃɪp, skɪp, sxɪp]}}, ''pull'' {{IPA|[pʊl]}}, ''good'' {{IPA|[ɡou̯t, ɣɑu̯t, ɣuːt]}}, ''clock'' {{IPA|[klɔk]}}, ''sail'' {{IPA|[sɑi̯l]}}, ''he'' {{IPA|[hɛi̯, hɑi̯, hi(j)]}}, ''storm'' {{IPA|[stoːrm]}}, ''wind'' {{IPA|[vɪˑnt]}}, ''grass'' {{IPA|[ɡras, ɣras]}}, ''hold'' {{IPA|[hoˑʊl(t)]}}, ''old'' {{IPA|[oˑʊl(t)]}}.

The table below shows the relationship between Low German consonants which were unaffected by this [[chain shift]] and their equivalents in other West Germanic languages. Contemporary Swedish and Icelandic shown for comparison; Eastern and Western North Germanic languages, respectively.

''Notes'':
:&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; German {{lang|de|Kerl}} is a loanword from Low German
:&lt;nowiki&gt;**&lt;/nowiki&gt; The series {{lang|de|Wief}}–{{lang|nl|wijf}}, etc. are [[cognates]], not semantic equivalents. The meanings of some of these words have shifted over time. For example, the correct equivalent term for "wife" in modern Dutch, German and Swedish is {{lang|nl|vrouw}}, {{lang|de|Frau}} and {{lang|sv|fru}} respectively; using {{lang|nl|wijf}}, {{lang|de|Weib}} or {{lang|sv|viv}} for a human is considered archaic in Swedish and nowadays derogatory in Dutch and German, comparable to "[[wicked girl]]". No cognate to {{lang|de|Frau}} / {{lang|nl|vrouw}} / {{lang|sv|fru}} has survived in English (compare Old English {{lang|ang|[[Wikt:frowe#Old English|frōwe]]}} "lady"; the English word ''[[wikt:frow|frow]]'' "woman, lady" rather being a borrowing of the Middle Dutch word).
:&lt;nowiki&gt;***&lt;/nowiki&gt; Pronounced ''shepp'' since the 17th century

==Grammar==
{{Refimprove|date=May 2016}}
{{improve|reason=Besides being unsourced, the article is wrong (or at best incomplete and misleading). Also, as there are different Low German dialects with different grammar, it probably makes more sense to give the dialectal grammar in articles like [[Northern Low Saxon]], [[Low Prussian dialect]], [[Westphalian language]] etc.|date=October 2017}}
Generally speaking, Low German [[grammar]] shows similarities with the [[grammar]]s of [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[Frisian languages|Frisian]], [[English language|English]], and [[Scots language|Scots]], but the [[dialect]]s of Northern [[Germany]] share some features (especially [[lexicon|lexical]] and [[syntax|syntactic]] features) with [[German language|German]] dialects.

===Nouns===
Low German [[declension]] has only two morphologically marked [[noun]] cases, where [[accusative]] and [[dative]] together constitute an [[oblique case]], and the genitive case has been lost.

{|class="wikitable"
|+Example case marking: ''Boom'' (tree), ''Bloom'' (flower), ''Land'' (land)
|-
! rowspan="2" | &amp;nbsp; !! colspan="2" | Masculine !! colspan="2" | Feminine !! colspan="2" | Neuter
|-
! Singular !! Plural !! Singular !! Plural !! Singular !! Plural
|-
!Nominative
| en Boom, '''de''' Boom || Bööm, de Bööm || nö Bloom, de Bloom || Blomen, de Blomen || en Land, dat Land || Lannen, de Lannen
|-
!Oblique
| en Boom, '''den''' Boom || Bööm, de Bööm || nö Bloom, de Bloom || Blomen, de Blomen || en Land, dat Land || Lannen, de Lannen
|}

===Dative den/dän===
In most modern dialects, the [[nominative]] and [[oblique case]]s are primarily distinguished only in the [[Grammatical number|singular]] of [[grammatical gender|masculine]] [[noun]]s. In some Low German dialects, the genitive case is distinguished as well (e.g. varieties of Mennonite Low German.)  It is marked in the masculine gender by changing the masculine definite determiner 'de' from ''de'' to ''den/dän''.  By contrast, German distinguishes four cases: nominative, accusative, genitive, and dative.  So, for example, the definite article of the masculine singular has the forms:  der (nom), den (acc), des (gen), and dem (dat.)  Thus case marking in Low German is simpler than in [[German language|German]].

===Verbs===
In Low German verbs are conjugated for person, number, and tense. Verb conjugation for person is only differentiated in the singular. There are five tenses in Low German: [[present tense]], [[preterite]], [[perfect (grammar)|perfect]], and [[pluperfect]], and in Mennonite Low German the [[present perfect]] which signifies a remaining effect from a past finished action. For example, "Ekj sie jekomen", "I am come", means that the speaker came and he is still at the place to which he came as a result of his completed action.

{|class="wikitable"
|+Example verb conjugation: slapen, "to sleep"
|-
! rowspan="2" | &amp;nbsp; !! colspan="2" | Present !! colspan="2" | Preterite !! colspan="2" | Perfect
|-
! Singular !! Plural !! Singular !! Plural !! Singular !! Plural
|-
!1st Person
| ik slaap || wi slaapt/slapen || ik sleep || wi slepen || ik heff slapen || wi hebbt/hebben slapen
|-
!2nd Person
| du slöppst || ji slaapt/slapen || du sleepst || ji slepen || du hest slapen || ji hebbt/hebben slapen
|-
!3rd Person
| he, se, dat slöppt || se slaapt/slapen || he, se, dat sleep || se slepen ||he, se, dat hett slapen || se hebbt/hebben slapen
|}

Unlike [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[German language|German]], and southern Low German, the northern dialects form the participle without the prefix ''ge-'', like the [[Scandinavian languages]], [[Frisian languages|Frisian]] and [[English language|English]]. Compare to the German past [[participle]] '''ge'''schlafen. This past [[participle]] is formed with the [[auxiliary verb]]s ''hebben'' "to have" and ''wesen/sien'' "to be". It should be noted that ''e-'' is used instead of ''ge-'' in most Southern (below [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]] in the [[Netherlands]]) [[dialect]]s, though often not when the past [[participle]] ends with ''-en'' or in a few oft-used words like ''west'' (been).

The reason for the two conjugations shown in the plural is regional: dialects in the central area use -t while the dialects in [[East Frisia]] and the dialects in [[Mecklenburg]]{{Examples|date=February 2010}} and further east use -en. The -en suffix is of Dutch influence. The -t ending is however more often encountered, even in areas where -en endings were prominent due to the fact that these -t endings are seen as ''kennzeichnend Niederdeutsch'', that is to say ''a well-known feature of Low German''.

There are 26 verb affixes.

There is also a progressive form of verbs in present, corresponding to the same in the Dutch language.
It is formed with ''wesen'' (to be), the preposition ''an'' (at) and "dat" (the/it).

{|class="wikitable"
|-
! &amp;nbsp; !! colspan="1" | Low German !! colspan="1" | Dutch !! colspan="1" | English
|-
!Main form
| Ik bün an't Maken. || Ik ben aan het maken. || I am making.
|-
!Main form 2
| Ik ''do'' maken.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; || - || -
|-
!Alternative form
| Ik bün an'n Maken.&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; || Ik ben aan het maken. || -
|-
!Alternative form 2
| Ik bün maken.&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; || Ik ben makende. || I ''am'' making.
|}

: &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Instead of ''wesen, sien'' (to be) Saxon uses ''doon'' (to do) to make to present continuous.
: &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Many see the ''{{'}}n'' as an old dative ending of ''dat'' which only occurs when being shortened after prepositions. This is actually the most frequently-used form in colloquial Low German.
: &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; This form is archaic and mostly unknown to Low German speakers. It is the same pattern as in the English example "I am making." The present participle has the same form as the infinitive: ''maken'' is either "to make" or "making".

=== Adjectives ===
The forms of Low German’s adjectives are distinct from other closely related languages such as German and English. These forms fall somewhere in between these two languages. Unlike German, Low German does not have a distinction for strong and weak forms of adjectives. However, its adjectives still do have endings, whereas English adjectives do not. The adjectives in Low German make a distinction between singular and plural to agree with the nouns that it modifies.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Platt and Old Saxon: Plattdeutsch (Low German) in its Modern and Historical Forms|last=Biddulph|first=Joseph|publisher=Cyhoeddwr JOSEPH BIDDULPH Publisher|year=2003|isbn=|location=Wales|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To express the difference between the singular and plural, Low German uses the following adjective endings:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!Adjective Ending
!Example
!Gloss
|-
| (zero)
|lütt
|small
|-
| -e (singular)
|dat lütte Huus
|the small house
|-
| -en (plural)
|de lütten Hüüs
|the small houses
|}

=== Personal pronouns ===
Like German, Low German maintains the historical Germanic distinction between the second person singular and second person plural. In English and German, this distinction would translate to “thou” and “du” referring to one person, and “ye” and “ihr” referring to more than one person. The second person pronouns for each case are given below to further illustrate this distinction.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
|-
!Case
! colspan="2" |Singular
! colspan="2" |Plural
|-
|Nominative
|du
|“thou”
|ji
|“ye”
|-
|Accusative
|di
|“thee”
|jug
|“you”
|-
|Dative
|di
|“thee”
|jug
|“you”
|-
|Genitive
|din, dinen
|“thy”, “thine”
|jug’
|“your”
|}

In the genitive (possessive) case, the pronoun functions in the same way as an adjective and so it may take an ending if needed to match the singular or plural status of the noun it is modifying. So, for example, if “you” possess multiple books, then [dinen] would be used to express that the singular second person possesses multiple objects: the books. If several people in the second person (“you all”) possessed multiple books, then [jug’] would be used instead.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Phonology==

===Consonants===
Since there is no standard Low German, there is no standard Low German consonant system. However, one trait present in the whole Low German speaking area,&lt;ref name="Adams1975"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Adams|1975|p=289}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the [[Relative articulation#Advanced and retracted|retraction]] of {{IPA|/s z/}} to {{IPA|[{{IPA link|s̠}} {{IPA link|z̠}}]}}.&lt;ref name="Adams1975"/&gt; 

The table shows the consonant system of North Saxon, a West Low Saxon dialect.&lt;ref&gt;R.E. Keller, ''German Dialects. Phonology and Morphology'', Manchester 1960&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writing system==
Low German is written using the [[Latin alphabet]]. There is no true standard [[orthography]], only several locally more or less accepted orthographic guidelines, those in the [[Netherlands]] mostly based on [[Dutch language|Dutch]] orthography, and those in [[Germany]] mostly based on German orthography. To the latter group belongs the standard orthography devised by [[Johannes Sass]]. It is mostly used by modern official publications and internet sites, especially the Low German Wikipedia. This diversity, a result of centuries of official neglect and suppression, has a very fragmenting and thus weakening effect on the language as a whole, since it has created barriers that do not exist on the spoken level&lt;ref&gt;Dieter Stellmacher: ''Niederdeutsche Grammatik - Phonologie und Morphologie''. In: Gerhard Cordes &amp; Dieter Möhn: ''Handbuch zur niederdeutschen Sprach- und Literaturwissenschaft''. Berlin: Erich Schmidt Verlag 1983, p.239.&lt;/ref&gt;.{{citation needed|reason=It is not obvious that orthographic diversity has a weakening effect.|date=December 2015}}  Interregional and international communication is severely hampered by this. Most of these systems aim at representing the [[phonetic]] ([[allophone|allophonic]]) output rather than underlying ([[phoneme|phonemic]]) representations, but trying to conserve many [[etymology|etymological]] spellings. Furthermore, many writers follow guidelines only roughly. This adds numerous idiosyncratic and often inconsistent ways of spelling to the already existing great orthographic diversity.

In 2011, writers of the Dutch Low Saxon Wikipedia developed a spelling that would be suitable and applicable to all varieties of Low Saxon in the Netherlands, although the semi-official dialect institutes have not picked up on this, or indicated that they{{Which|date=October 2014}} believed that yet another writing system will only further confuse dialect writers rather than suit them.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}} The new spelling was introduced to the Dutch Low Saxon Wikipedia to unify the spelling of categories, templates and comparable source code writings.

In 2018, a team of writers from both the Dutch and the German Low Saxon Wikipedia completed the [[New Saxon Spelling]], which aims to unite the different spelling systems of the Netherlands and Germany. Unlike traditional spelling systems, this spelling does not focus on correct display of pronunciation, but instead seeks mutual legibility for both German and Dutch readers of Low Saxon, based on etymology. Readers may apply their own pronunciation. As such, it can be seen as an extension of the [[Algemeyne Schrievwies']] by Reinhard Franz Hahn.

'''Maria Popova''' ({{lang-bg|Мария Попова}}; born 28 July 1984) is a Bulgarian-born writer, blogger, literary and cultural critic living in [[Brooklyn]], New York.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; She is known for her speeches and her [[blog]] BrainPickings.org, which features her writing on culture, books, philosophy and eclectic subjects on and off the Internet.

== Early life ==
Popova's parents are ethnic Bulgarians who met in Russia when they were both foreign exchange students in the early 1980s. Popova was born in Bulgaria in 1984. Her mother studied [[library science]], while her father studied engineering and eventually became an [[Apple computers|Apple]] salesman.&lt;ref name="WhoWhom"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://whoandwhom.com/maria-popova/ | title=Maria Popova - Editor of Brain Pickings | work=Who &amp; Whom | date= December 10, 2012 | accessdate=October 1, 2013 | last=Hawk | first=Antiq}}&lt;/ref&gt; During Popova's childhood, one of her grandmothers often read to her from a collection of encyclopedias.&lt;ref name="GreatDiscontent"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://thegreatdiscontent.com/maria-popova | title=Maria Popova | work=The Great Discontent | date= November 27, 2012 | accessdate=October 1, 2013 | last=Walker | first=Alissa}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of her influence, Popova was exposed to a vast amount of knowledge at a young age, which fueled her curiosity about the world.&lt;ref name="WhoWhom"/&gt; Popova first worked when she was 8 years old, making [[martenitsa]]s having set up a [[lemonade stand]]-esque shop on the street to sell them.&lt;ref name="Bundle"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bundle.com/article/brain-pickings-blogger-maria-popova-im-not-a--11733/ | title=Brain Pickings blogger Maria Popova: 'I'm not a big believer in saving' | work=Bundle | date= June 24, 2010 | accessdate=October 5, 2013 | last=Wolinetz | first=Geoff |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121028055101/http://www.bundle.com/article/brain-pickings-blogger-maria-popova-im-not-a--11733/ |archivedate= October 28, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Education and work ===

Popova graduated from the [[American College of Sofia]] in [[Bulgaria]] in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Бонева-Благоева|first1=Йорданка|title=Как блогърката Мария Попова от Brain Pickings избира Американския колеж за свое училище|url=http://www.danybon.com/chastno-obrazovanie/maria-popova-acs/|date=16 December 2015|language=bg-BG}}&lt;/ref&gt; She attended the [[University of Pennsylvania]], where she earned a degree in Communications, though her grandmother wanted her to get an [[MBA]].&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/02/fashion/maria-popova-has-some-big-ideas.html?pagewanted=all | title=She's Got Some Big Ideas | work=The New York Times | date= November 30, 2012 | accessdate=December 1, 2012 | last=Feiler | first=Bruce}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "MotherJones"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.motherjones.com/media/2011/12/maria-popova-interview | title=Maria Popova's Beautiful Mind | publisher=Mother Jones and the Foundation for National Progress | work=Mother Jones | date=January 2012 | accessdate=2012-12-01 | last=Levintova | first=Hannah}}&lt;/ref&gt; Popova paid for her tuition by working four part-time jobs on top of a full college course load: as an advertising representative for ''[[The Daily Pennsylvanian]]'', as an intern for a local writer, as an employee for a work-study job at the [[Annenberg Center for the Performing Arts]], and as a staff member for a small start-up advertising agency in Philadelphia.&lt;ref name="Bundle"/&gt;

In 2005, while Popova worked at an advertising agency, she noticed that her co-workers were circulating information within the advertising industry around the office for inspiration. However, Popova thought creativity was better sparked with exposure to information outside of the industry one was familiar with. In an effort to stir creativity, she regularly sent emails to the entire office containing five things that had nothing to do with advertising, but were meaningful, interesting, or important.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; Because of the popularity of the emails, Popova felt that there was an "intellectual hunger for that sort of cross-disciplinary curiosity and self-directed learning."&lt;ref name="GreatDiscontent"/&gt;

Popova told her boss that she would start her own mailing for inspiration, and called this mailing ''Brain Pickings''.&lt;ref name="WhoWhom"/&gt; She then enrolled in a night class to learn web design, took Brain Pickings online, and let the project grow organically.&lt;ref name="GreatDiscontent"/&gt;

=== Relocation to the U.S. ===

After Popova graduated from the University of Pennsylvania, she got a job and applied for a visa to stay in the United States. However, 2007 was the year the "Visagate" scandal occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Now You See It, Now You Don't: What's Really At Stake In The Visa Bulletin Controversy|url=http://www.ilw.com/articles/2007,0724-endelman.shtm|website=Immigration Daily}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, though Popova filed for a visa on the first day, she was in the two-thirds of the applicants who were unsuccessful. Instead, she received an OPT, which allows a year's worth of work with a company. At the end of 2008, she returned for a while to Bulgaria, where she and some friends organized TEDxBG, modeled after [[TED Talks]].  When the visa application process opened up again, she successfully secured a visa and moved to Los Angeles in January 2010, but disliked it immensely. Popova then moved to New York later that year, where she still resides today.&lt;ref name="MotherJones"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Предай нататък|url=http://www.capital.bg/light/lica/2010/05/20/904012_predai_natatuk/|accessdate=20 September 2016|work=Capital|date=20 May 2010|language=bg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Popova is most notable for ''Brain Pickings'', a popular blog that began as a weekly email to seven of her friends around 2006.&lt;ref name="On Being with Krista Tippett"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.onbeing.org/program/maria-popova-cartographer-of-meaning-in-a-digital-age/7580| title= Maria Popova - Cartographer of Meaning in a Digital Age | website = On Being with Krista Tippett| accessdate= June 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Now a website, Twitter feed, and weekly digest, Brain Pickings covers a wide variety of cultural topics: history, current events, and images and texts from the past.&lt;ref name="MotherJones"/&gt; It includes several sections and has graphics, photographs, and illustrations in addition to written content.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;

As of December 2012, the blog was receiving 1.2 million visitors a month.&lt;ref name="obs2012"&gt;{{cite web| url= https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2012/dec/30/maria-popova-brain-pickings-internet |title=Maria Popova: why we need an antidote to the culture of Google | date=29 December 2012 |work=''[[The Observer]]| first=Kathy|last= Sweeney | accessdate=2013-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among its followers are [[William Gibson]], [[Josh Groban]], [[Drew Carey]], [[Guy Spier]], [[David Eagleman]], [[Mia Farrow]], [[Biz Stone]], and [[Evan Williams (Internet entrepreneur)|Evan Williams]].&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; [[Anne-Marie Slaughter]] describes Popova's blog as "like walking into the [[Museum of Modern Art]] and having somebody give you a customized, guided tour."&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;

===Side projects and partnerships===

In addition to running Brain Pickings, Popova has a number of side projects. She maintains a newsletter, a [[Twitter]] account, and has numerous [[Google Plus]] subscribers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Maria Popova (brainpicker) on Twitter|url=https://twitter.com/brainpicker|publisher=Twitter, Inc.|accessdate=27 October 2013|author=Maria Popova}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Maria Popova - Google+|url=https://plus.google.com/102222722824849858928/posts|publisher=Maria Popova|accessdate=27 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2012, she created the "Literary Jukebox", a sub-site where she matches quotes from books with songs. "Music, for me, is an enormous trigger of mnemonic associations – of time, place, mood, emotion, the smell of fresh-cut grass behind your best friend’s house when you were 18 and first heard that song."&lt;ref name="LibraryJournal"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://reviews.libraryjournal.com/2013/08/in-the-bookroom/qa-maria-popova-on-literary-jukebox/ | title=Q&amp;A: Maria Popova on Literary Jukebox | work=Library Journal | date=August 9, 2013 | accessdate=October 5, 2013 | last=Klose | first=Stephanie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Popova also has various partnerships with prominent organizations. She is an [[MIT]] Futures of Entertainment Fellow.&lt;ref name="Atlanticcontribs"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theatlantic.com/maria-popova/# | title=Maria Popova| publisher=The Atlantic Monthly Group | work=The Atlantic | accessdate=December 1, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Popova serves as the editorial director at the higher education [[social network]] [[Lore (company)|Lore]], run by Noodle.&lt;ref name="Lifehacker"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://lifehacker.com/5942623/im-maria-popova-and-this-is-how-i-work | title=I'm Maria Popova and this is how I work | publisher=Gawker Media | work=Lifehacker.com | date=September 12, 2012 | accessdate=December 1, 2012 | author=Miller, Tessa}}&lt;/ref&gt; She edits ''Explore'', a partnership site with the Noodle educational search company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Explore|url=http://explore.noodle.org/|publisher=Noodle.org|accessdate=27 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Popova has also written for ''[[The Atlantic]]'', ''[[Wired UK]]'', ''[[Good Worldwide|Good Magazine]]'', ''[[The Huffington Post]]'', and [[Nieman Foundation for Journalism|Nieman Journalism Lab]].&lt;ref name= "MotherJones"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nebo"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.neboagency.com/blog/art-curation-interview-maria-popova/ | title=The Art of Curation: An Interview with Maria Popova from BrainPickings | work=Nebo | date=April 20, 2010 | accessdate=October 5, 2013 | last=Allison | first=Chris}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Content selection and output===
Popova filters through the large amounts of content she reads each day through a detailed selection process. When choosing content for Brain Pickings, she asks herself three things: 
{{quote|Is it interesting enough to leave the reader with something – a thought, an idea, a question – after the immediate fulfillment of the self-contained reading or viewing experience? Is it evergreen in a way that makes it just as interesting in a month or a year? Am I able to provide enough additional context – historical background, related past articles, complementary reading or viewing material – or build a pattern around it to make it worth for the reader?&lt;ref name= "FromYourDesks"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://fromyourdesks.com/2011/10/11/maria-popova/ | title=Maria Popova. | work=From Your Desks | date=October 11, 2011 | accessdate=October 5, 2013 | last=Donnelly | first=Kate}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
 
When choosing material to publish on Brain Pickings, she aims to "share content that is meaningful. Often, it’s timeless."&lt;ref name="Fastcompany"/&gt; Popova also seeks out content that has narrative. As she states, "Curation is a form of pattern recognition – pieces of information or insight which over time amount to an implicit point of view."&lt;ref name="Marco"/&gt; Popova publishes this information in tweet form when she does not have much to add.  On the other hand, she publishes this as blog posts when she feels she can deepen the subject with historical background or additional materials.&lt;ref name="Marco"/&gt;

===Awards and recognitions===
Maria Popova has received numerous instances of media recognition for her work. In 2012, she was named number 51 of the 100 most creative people in business by [[Fast Company (magazine)|''Fast Company'' magazine]].&lt;ref name="Fastcompany"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.fastcompany.com/most-creative-people/2012/maria-popova | title=How to make the Internet more personal | publisher=Mansueto Ventures LLC. | work=FastCompany.com | accessdate=December 1, 2012 | last=Kaganskiy | first=Julia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Popova was featured in ''30 under 30'' by Forbes as one of the most influential individuals in Media and was listed on “The 140 Best Twitter Feeds of 2012 List” by [[Time (magazine)|''Time'' magazine]].&lt;ref name="Forbes"&gt;{{cite web | url= https://www.forbes.com/pictures/eeji45eegdf/maria-popova-28-founder-and-editor-brainpickings/ | title=30 Under 30, Media | publisher=Forbes.com LLC | work=Forbes.com | date=December 17, 2012 | accessdate=October 1, 2013 | last=Bercovici | first=Jeff}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://techland.time.com/2012/03/21/the-140-best-twitter-feeds-of-2012/slide/maria-popova/ | title=Maria Popova | publisher=Time Inc | work=Time.com | date=March 15, 2012 | accessdate=October 5, 2013 | last=Townsend | first=Allie}}&lt;/ref&gt; Popova’s work has also been spotlighted and profiled in publications such as ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;

== Criticism ==

===Affiliate advertising===
Popova has been very vocal about her dislike for traditional advertising, and has repeatedly expressed her pride on being advertising-free: 
{{quote|It doesn’t put the reader’s best interests first – it turns them into a sellable eyeball, and sells that to advertisers. As soon as you begin to treat your stakeholder as a bargaining chip, you’re not interested in broadening their intellectual horizons or bettering their life. I don’t believe in this model of making people into currency. You become accountable to advertisers, rather than your reader.&lt;ref name="PaidContent"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://paidcontent.org/2013/02/14/the-brainpickings-brouhaha-and-the-problem-with-affiliate-links/ | title=The Brainpickings brouhaha and the problem with affiliate links | work=paidContent | date=February 14, 2013 | accessdate=October 5, 2013 | last=Ingram | first=Mathew}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 2013, Popova received criticism on how she championed her site to be "ad-free" and a "labor of love" that requires reader donations to sustain itself, while she covertly received revenue from affiliate advertising from Amazon. Tom Bleymaier, founder of a startup in Palo Alto, California, wrote a post on an anonymous [[Tumblr]] blog calling Popova out for her actions. Using his own calculations, Bleymaier extrapolated that Popova could make anywhere between $240,000 and $432,000 a year with these affiliate advertisements.&lt;ref name="Reuters"/&gt;

This received much media attention from sources such as [[Reuters]] and [[PandoDaily]].&lt;ref name="Reuters"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2013/02/13/blogonomics-maria-popova-edition/ | title=Blogonomics, Maria Popova edition | publisher=Thomson Reuters | work=Reuters.com | date=February 14, 2013 | accessdate=October 1, 2013 | last=Salmon | first=Felix}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PandoDaily"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://pandodaily.com/2013/02/14/dear-jonah-lehrer-and-maria-popova-just-own-up-and-apologize/| title=Dear Jonah Lehrer and Maria Popova: Just own up and apologize | publisher=PandoDaily | work=pandodaily.com | date=February 14, 2013 | accessdate=October 1, 2013 | last=Mckenzie | first=Hamish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Popova herself responded to the Reuters article written by Felix Salmon in an email where she addressed factual errors concerning the amount of income from the affiliate advertisements mentioned in the Reuters article.

This incident has sparked a more general debate on the Internet about whether or not affiliate advertisements are "sneaky" or "deceptive". Popova has since updated her donation page on Brain Pickings to acknowledge the fact that she receives income from affiliate advertisements.&lt;ref name="PandoDaily" /&gt;

===Curator's Code===
In 2012, Popova created ''The Curator's Code'', a project by Popova with input from designer Kelli Anderson. The Curator’s Code is a code of conduct for curators on the web to use. This proposed method is an attempt to codify source attribution on the internet  to ensure that the intellectual labor of information discovery is honored.&lt;ref name="NYT2"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/12/business/media/guidelines-proposed-for-content-aggregation-online.html?pagewanted=all | title=A Code of Conduct for Content Aggregators | work=The New York Times | date= March 11, 2012 | accessdate=October 1, 2013 | last=Carr | first=David}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the code, the "via" symbol indicates direct discovery, where the "hat tip" symbol indicates an indirect link of discovery.

The Curator's Code was controversial, and received mixed responses. The announcement of this project elicited feedback from people who "worry about the meaning of curation".&lt;ref name="Marco"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.marco.org/2012/03/12/not-a-curator | title=I'm not a curator | publisher=Marco Arment | work=Marco.org | date= March 12, 2012 | accessdate=October 1, 2013 | last=Arment | first=Marco}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a blog post, Marco Arment stated that "codifying 'via' links with confusing symbols is solving the wrong problem".&lt;ref name="Marco"/&gt; Most criticism of The Curator’s Code voiced uncertainty about its ability to solve the problems of online attribution. A few critics argued that the problems of online attribution are not due to a lack of codified syntax, but rather due to the "economics and realities of online publishing".&lt;ref name="Marco"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1679">'''Mount Killaraus''' is a [[legend]]ary [[mountain]] in [[Ireland]], most famous for being the source of the stones of [[Stonehenge]] in [[Arthurian legend]].

[[Geoffrey of Monmouth]] records the story in his ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]''. He describes how [[Ambrosius Aurelianus|Aurelius Ambrosius]] returned from his exile in [[Brittany]] and burnt [[Vortigern]] in his tower. Rallying the Britons, he triumphed over the [[Saxon people|Saxon]] invaders and executed their leader, [[Hengist]]. Following the victory he decided to set up a great memorial to his triumph at a place called Mount Ambrius. When his carpenters and masons were unable to come up with a suitable awe-inspiring design, Ambrosius commissioned [[Merlin (wizard)|Merlin]] to create one.

Merlin’s solution was to import a [[stone circle]] called the Giant's Round from its home atop Mount Killaraus. [[giant (mythology)|Giants]] from [[Africa]] had originally brought the stones to Killaraus. They would pour water over the stones and use it to fill baths in which they cured their sick. [[Uther Pendragon]] went with 15,000 men to retrieve the stones but they proved too heavy to move. Laughing, Merlin transported them to [[Salisbury Plain]] using his magic and set them up just as they were. According to Geoffrey, they have stood there ever since as Stonehenge.

[[File:Nakamal.jpg|thumb|A small nakamal on [[Pentecost Island]].]]
A '''nakamal''' (a [[Bislama]] word from vernacular terms such as [[Raga language|Raga]] ''gamali'') is a traditional meeting place in [[Vanuatu]]. It is used for gatherings, ceremonies and the drinking of [[kava]].

A nakamal is found in every significant Vanuatu community, but the design of the nakamal and the traditions surrounding it vary between areas.

==Traditional nakamals==
In north and central Vanuatu, the nakamal generally takes the form of a large building, assembled from traditional materials with the help of the entire community, under the direction of a particular chief. Entry to the nakamal is often restricted to men, and the building may be used as a sleeping and living area for unmarried men and boys and for male visitors to the village. Significantly, most nakamals lack a lockable door, indicating that all friendly visitors are welcome, although there may be a low barrier across the entrance to keep out animals.

In front of a nakamal there is often a flattened clearing, or ''nasara'', used for dances and outdoor gatherings.

In southern Vanuatu, a nakamal may be a large, sheltered outdoor space, such as under a banyan tree.

In Vanuatu's capital [[Port Vila]], the assembly building of the national council of chiefs ([[Malvatumauri]]) is designed in the form of a traditional nakamal.

==Nakamals as kava bars==
The nakamal's most prominent function nowadays is as a place for the preparation and drinking of [[kava]]. In urban Vanuatu, and in neighbouring [[New Caledonia]], the term ''nakamal'' may be used for a kava bar where the drink is sold, although in rural Vanuatu a traditional nakamal (where kava preparation is a communal activity and money does not usually change hands) is distinct from a kava bar.

An urban 'nakamal' or kava bar at which kava is available for sale is advertised by a coloured light displayed at the entrance.

'''Nora''' is a theatre show directed by [[Haris Pasovic]] and produced by the [[East West Theatre Company]] based in [[Sarajevo]], [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.miningtv.com/video/ihCv1Ak2eD4&amp;feature=youtube_gdata/NORA.html/ MiningTV: ''Nora Trailer by East West Sarajevo''], cited December 14, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The show is based on [[Henrik Ibsen]]'s play ''[[A Doll's House]]'', which was translated into [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]] by Munib Delalic.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eastwest.ba/nora/ East West Theatre Company: ''Nora''], cited December 14, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Nora'' is the story of a young successful couple who seemingly live a perfect life but suffer from marital problems under the surface.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.culture.in.mk/story.asp?id=29101/ Republic of Macedonia: ''Cult Director Haris Pasovic Brings Two Plays at Ohrid Summer'']{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, cited December 14, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The story focuses on Nora and Torvald Helmer, who, as in Ibsen's original, are a successful married couple who live a handsome and sophisticated lifestyle. At first glance, the life of Nora and Torvald is a modern model of a happy marriage. Torvald is a rising star in the financial world who is careful to preserve the couple's public image, enjoys luxury cars and collects expensive watches. At the same time he enjoys a blissful family life, alongside an attractive wife and a five-year-old daughter. His wife Nora also enjoys shopping, clothes, shoes, perfumes, watches, exclusive brands, and luxury lingerie. Their sex life is quite liberal and extravagant.

Things change when Nora’s old friend Christine suddenly comes back into Nora’s life. From an ascetic, hard working young woman, Christine soon transforms into a [[femme fatale]] who, powered by ambition and greed, mercilessly climbs the social ladder. Her lover, Helene Krogstad (who in Ibsen’s original is a male character) blackmails both Nora and Torvald. Dr. Rank, a friend of the Helmers, is dying of a terminal disease and decides to admit to Nora and that he is in love with her. A financial crisis begins to beguile Torvald while Nora slowly loses her composure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://2009.desirefestival.eu/?p=166&amp;langswitch_lang=en/ DESIRÉ central station 2009: ''Haris Pasovic, theater director ahead of its time''], cited December 14, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The show premiered in Sarajevo and toured Macedonia during the [[Ohrid Summer Festival]]. It was also played during the opening of the International Theatre Festival Desire in Subotica&lt;ref&gt;[http://2009.desirefestival.eu/?p=166&amp;langswitch_lang=en/ eKapija: ''Nora''], cited December 14, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Not the Nine O'Clock News''''' was a British television comedy [[sketch show]] which was broadcast on [[BBC Two|BBC2]] from 1979 to 1982. Originally shown as a comedy alternative to the ''[[BBC Nine O'Clock News|Nine O'Clock News]]'' on [[BBC One|BBC1]], it featured satirical sketches on current news stories and popular culture, as well as parody songs, comedy sketches, re-edited videos, and spoof television formats. The show featured [[Rowan Atkinson]], [[Pamela Stephenson]], [[Mel Smith]], and [[Griff Rhys Jones]], as well as [[Chris Langham]] in the first series.

==Format==
The format was a deliberate departure from the ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'' [[Stream of consciousness (narrative mode)|stream-of-consciousness]] meta-comedy, returning to a more conventional sketch show format. Sketches were mostly self-contained, lasting from a few seconds to a few minutes and often had a degree of naturalism in performance. The series launched the careers of several high-profile actors and writers, and also led to other comedic series including ''[[Blackadder]]'', ''[[Mr. Bean]]'', and ''[[Alas Smith and Jones]]''.

The series benefited from video editing and recording techniques. The pace was enhanced by jump-cutting between library clips, usually of politicians, royalty, or celebrities. Then-PM [[Margaret Thatcher]] complained when, by adroit image editing, the show implied she had crashed a car. Effects used in pop videos, provided by the [[Quantel Paintbox]], were often a highlight of the musical numbers.

==History==
===Background===
''Not the Nine O'Clock News'' was [[Television producer|produced]] by [[John Lloyd (producer)|John Lloyd]]. Lloyd pitched the idea to the heads of BBC Comedy and Light Entertainment and was given a six-show series on condition that he collaborate with Sean Hardie, who had worked in [[Current affairs (news format)|current affairs]] at the BBC. The idea came from the then-recent publication of ''[[The New York Times#Interruptions|Not The New York Times]]'', a spoof of the famed paper which was not circulating at the time because of a general strike occurring in the city, leaving it with no papers.&lt;ref&gt;Jim Dwyer, [https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/15/nyregion/15about.html?_r=0 In 1978, a Faux Paper Was Real Genius], ''New York Times'', 14 November 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, Lloyd and Hardie were considering doing a lampoon of actuality programmes ''à la'' ''[[The Frost Report]]'' with [[Rowan Atkinson]] portraying an old-fashioned host attacking liberal and/or modern trends. The show was to be called ''Sacred Cows'' but the news show was chosen because of its larger quantity of sources. As well as the homage to ''Not The New York Times'', the show's name derived from its schedule, as it originally aired on [[BBC Two|BBC2]] at the same time as the ''[[BBC Nine O'Clock News|Nine O'Clock News]]'' on [[BBC One|BBC1]].

===Aborted first series===
Aside from Atkinson, the original cast comprised [[Christopher Godwin]], [[John Gorman (musician)|John Gorman]], [[Chris Langham]], [[Willoughby Goddard]], and [[Jonathan Hyde]], and the first episode of a planned series of shows was scheduled for 2 April 1979. The episode also featured [[Chris Emmett]] (impersonating [[Denis Healey]]), [[Robert Llewelyn]] (impersonating [[Bob Hope]]) and Hertz Rental (narrating general elections in Greenland). As the show was originally scheduled to air in ''[[Fawlty Towers]]''' timeslot, [[John Cleese]] was to have introduced the first episode in a sketch referring to a technicians' strike then in progress that hindered the production of the show, explaining (in character as [[Basil Fawlty]]) that there was no show that week so a "tatty revue" would be broadcast instead. However the [[United Kingdom general election, 1979|1979 general election]] intervened, and the show was pulled as too political, being replaced with repeats of American sitcom ''[[Rhoda]]''.&lt;ref name="BBC Guide to Comedy"&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/guide/articles/n/notthenineoclock_7774885.shtml BBC Guide to Comedy], by [[Mark Lewisohn]], URL accessed 17 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The sketch with Cleese was broadcast later that year, when the final episode of ''[[Fawlty Towers]]'' went out during the broadcast run of the first series of ''Not the Nine O'Clock News'', though the significance of the sketch was lost. This link is included on the [[DVD region code#2|Region 2]] ''Fawlty Towers'' DVD boxset. Basil's waiter Manuel also appeared at the end of the unaired episode, trying to get a joke about the Ayatollah's contact lenses. Other sketches of the unaired first episode were also lifted or remade on episodes throughout the show. Healey's and Hope's impressions were achieved by the use of "talking head" puppets, which in the mid-80s would become a characteristic staple of ''[[Spitting Image]]'', which Lloyd produced in its early series.

===In production===
Lloyd and Hardie decided to recast the show, retaining Langham and Atkinson. They wanted to bring in a woman. [[Victoria Wood]] turned the show down. Lloyd met Pamela Stephenson at a party and she agreed to join. Atkinson, Langham, and Stephenson were joined by Mel Smith,&lt;ref name="BBC Guide to Comedy"/&gt; who was scheduled to work on the pilot, but he declined after reading the script (he called the finished episode in retrospect as "the worst half hour of TV" he ever saw). The first series was criticised for being "a poor mix of stand up, and a mild portion of sketches" and newspaper reviews referred it to as "extremely offensive" and that "should not be allowed on TV", ratings were dismal as well: the first episode had fewer than one million viewers. However the network controller reportedly liked the programme so much, that a second series of seven episodes was commissioned.

For the second series, Langham was replaced by [[Griff Rhys-Jones]], who had already appeared in minor roles, aside from having directed ''The Atkinson People'' radio show.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.screenonline.org.uk/tv/id/570920/index.html BFI Screenonline], URL accessed 17 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The second series won the [[Silver Rose]] at the [[Montreux Festival]]&lt;!-- in 1980 ? --&gt; and a [[BAFTA]] award for Best Light Entertainment Programme in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080253/awards Awards at IMDb.com], URL accessed 17 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The show's later series achieved improved ratings.

''Not the Nine O'Clock News'' became a stage show in Oxford and London in 1982, but the main performers decided to end the project while it was a success: Stephenson began a Hollywood film career, Atkinson recorded the first series of ''[[Blackadder]]'' in 1983, and Smith and Jones became a double act in ''[[Alas Smith and Jones]]''.  An American adaptation, ''[[Not Necessarily the News]]'' ran for seven years, from 1983&amp;ndash;90 on the [[HBO|Home Box Office]] cable television channel.&lt;ref name="BBC Guide to Comedy"/&gt;

===Content===
Satire was a key theme in the show's comedy.  One spoof news element for example might include a routine announcement that [[NASA]] had once again announced a delay in the launch of its [[space shuttle]] owing to technical difficulties, as the screen showed the shuttle on its launch pad with oxygen streaming off the tanks, overlaid with the sound of a car engine turning over but not starting.  An opening graphic featured the same blue screen and white analog clock ticking down to 9:00 p.m. as preceded the original [[BBC Nine O'Clock News|Nine O'Clock News]], followed by an announcement of the time in similar voice and, in parody, the announcement that this was "definitely ''not'' the Nine O'Clock News."  Skits could include things like a group of rural Americans at a barbecue singing a several minutes of comical implausibles like "I'm prepared to believe that that Nixon wasn't a crook; I'm prepared to believe [[Love Story (novel)|Love Story]]'s a readable book..." and finally concluding, "I believe that the devil is ready to repent; - but I can't believe [[Ronald Reagan]] is president."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmWLJmbytkk Not the Nine O'Clock News - I Believe...]. Retrieved 7 March 2017&lt;/ref&gt;  

===Legacy===
The show is credited with bringing [[alternative comedy]] to British television: Lloyd once commented he wanted to do a "modern, working-class" comedy in contrast to other shows of the time such as ''[[The Two Ronnies]]''. This also happened at a time that the ''[[National Lampoon (magazine)|National Lampoon]]'' magazine, ''[[The Second City]]'' troupes and ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' became showcases of alternative comedy in North America.

In 2005, Rowan Atkinson, Mel Smith, Pamela Stephenson, Chris Langham, and John Lloyd reunited to talk to Sue MacGregor about the show. Langham's departure was touched upon, with Lloyd seeming to take the blame, though Atkinson had campaigned for Langham to be kept in the cast (Langham actually refused to speak to his former cast-mates for a number of years after he was fired, until appearing as a regular on ''Smith &amp; Jones'' in the 1990s). ''The Reunion'' was broadcast on [[BBC Radio 4|Radio 4]] on 31 July 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/news/2005/07/29/20823.shtml The BBC's Comedy Blog entry for the 29th&amp;nbsp;of July 2005]. Retrieved 17 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

A documentary featuring the cast reminiscing about the making of the programme was shown on [[BBC 2]] on 28 December 2009,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2009/11_november/23/christmas.shtml BBC Press release for Christmas 2009]. Retrieved 24 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt; before one of the 1995 compilation shows was aired (despite a "complete episode" being billed in television listings). The documentary was repeated on 3 August 2013, just over two weeks after the death of Mel Smith.

==Crew==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Notthenine.jpg|thumb|The cast of ''Not the Nine O'Clock News'' (from left) Jones, Atkinson, and Smith, with Stephenson at the front.]] --&gt;The main writers included [[Colin Bostock-Smith]], [[Andy Hamilton]], [[Peter Brewis]], [[Richard Curtis]], and [[Clive Anderson]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0080253/fullcredits Cast list] at IMDb.com, URL accessed 17 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt; However, the producers accepted scripts for sketches from a wide range of writers and ensured the show remained topical by recording sketches only days before broadcast. [[Howard Goodall]] (subsequently composer of the ''[[Red Dwarf]]'', ''[[Blackadder]]'', and ''[[The Vicar of Dibley]]'' theme music) was musical director. Bill Wilson directed the first three series, Geoff Posner the fourth.

==Episodes==
A total of 27 episodes of 25–30 minute duration were produced over four series.

* 16 October–20 November 1979: six episodes (and 1 unaired pilot episode)
* 31 March–12 May 1980: seven episodes
* 27 October–15 December 1980: eight episodes
* 1 February–8 March 1982: six episodes

The series has rarely been repeated; eight re-cut and condensed (to make it "faster and funnier than ever"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A401851 The BBC H2G2 Page for "Not the Nine O'clock News"]. Retrieved 17 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt;) "episodes" made for a video edition in 1995 are shown instead. This is primarily because the original episodes in their entirety lampooned events that were in the news at the time.

==Commercial releases==

===Video and DVD===
Two highly edited videos of the show, entitled ''Nice Video, Shame about the Hedgehog'' and ''The Gorilla Kinda Lingers'', were released in 1995.

In August 2003 these videos were released on DVD under the title of ''The Best of Not the Nine O'Clock News: Volume One''. ''The Best of Not the Nine O'Clock News: Volume Two'' came a year later. Both of these are available in one set, unavailable separately, in [[DVD region code#Region codes and countries|Region 1]].

===Records===
Three vinyl albums were released at the time the series was screening, entitled ''Not the Nine O'Clock News'', ''Hedgehog Sandwich'', and ''The Memory Kinda Lingers'' respectively. These albums were very successful, with the first two both reaching the top ten of the UK albums chart, a rare feat for a [[spoken word album]].

The original version of ''The Memory Kinda Lingers'' was a double LP. The second disc is titled ''Not in Front of the Audience'' and is a live recording of the cast's stage show. ''Hedgehog Sandwich'' and the first disc of ''The Memory Kinda Lingers'' were later combined on a [[BBC]] double-length [[Compact audio cassette|cassette]] and double-CD set.

"The Ayatollah Song" [[A-side and B-side#B.2FW|b/w]] "Gob on You" (as featured in the TV show) and "I Like Trucking" [[A-side and B-side#B.2FW|b/w]] "Supa Dupa" were also released as singles.

(The 1980 single "Typing Pool" by 'Pam and the Paper Clips' (EMI 5015), is variously ascribed to [[Pamela Stephenson]] and NtNON. It was written by Roger and [[Nigel Planer]].)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.musicaltaste.com/showsong.php?songtitle=Typing%20Pool&amp;performer=Pam%20and%20the%20Paper%20Clips&amp;song_id=2427 Musical Taste listing and clip]. Retrieved 17 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Books and miscellaneous===
Three books were released to tie in with the series: ''Not! the Nine O'Clock News'', a collection of classic material rewritten and restructured as a [[parody]] of the short-lived ''[[NOW! (1979-81 magazine)|Now!]]'' magazine; ''Not the Royal Wedding'' (the royal wedding in question being the [[Wedding of Charles, Prince of Wales, and Lady Diana Spencer|marriage]] of [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Charles]] and [[Diana, Princess of Wales|Diana]]); and ''Not the General Election'', a tie-in with the [[United Kingdom general election, 1983|1983 General Election]]. The first was reprinted in 1995 as ''Not for Sale''. ''Not the Royal Wedding'' was promoted by a little-known radio spinoff, ''Not the Nuptials'', transmitted on BBC Radio 1.&lt;ref name="Worthington 2012"&gt;{{cite book |last=Worthington |first=Tim |date=2012 |title=Fun At One: The Story Of Comedy At BBC Radio 1 |url= |location= |publisher=Lulu Press |page= |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same station had also previously produced a behind-the-scenes documentary on ''Not the Nine O'Clock News'' as part of their magazine series ''Studio B15''.&lt;ref name="Worthington 2012"/&gt;

Two 'page-a-day' tear-off calendars, edited by [[John Lloyd (producer)|John Lloyd]] and containing several contributions from [[Douglas Adams]], were released in the early 1980s (''Not 1982'' and ''Not 1983''). Also published around this time was a spoof Orwellian edition of ''[[The Times]]'' newspaper, ''Not The 1984 Times'', which although widely assumed to be, was not actually connected to the series.

They apply principles used in organizing communities developing open-source software for organizing group efforts innovating with human culture. New open-source religions may develop their rituals, praxes, or systems of beliefs through a continuous process of refinement and dialogue among participating practitioners. Organizers and participants often see themselves as part of a more generalized [[free culture movement|open-source and free-culture movement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Crumm |first1=David |title=Open Source Religion |url=http://zero.newassignment.net/assignmentzero/open_source_religion |website=Assignment Zero |publisher=Assignment Zero |accessdate=22 January 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080103115009/http://zero.newassignment.net/assignmentzero/open_source_religion |archivedate=January 3, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==

In 1994, with his essay, "The Holy War: Mac vs. DOS," the scholar and novelist [[Umberto Eco]] popularized the use of religious metaphors in comparing [[operating system]] design and user experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eco|first1=Umberto|title=The Holy War: Mac vs. DOS|journal=Espresso|date=September 30, 1994|url=http://cliffarnold.com/macvdos.pdf|accessdate=11 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 1990s, the term "open-source religion" began appearing in technology magazines as a reference to the open-source [[Linux]] operating system's organizing principle and as an analogy for highlighting the philosophical differences between advocates of open-source vs. proprietary software .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Liebmann|first1=Lenny|title=Say Hello to the 'Lintel' Reformation|journal=Computerworld|date=May 10, 1999|volume=33|issue=19|page=34|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=90foRW8FHpkC&amp;pg=PT31&amp;dq=%22Open+Source+Religion%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=KIAAVfW0JYmbyQSr6IHIBA&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;f=false|accessdate=11 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Foster|first1=Ed|title=Apple padlocks UI decor|journal=InfoWorld|date=June 6, 2001|volume=23|issue=24|page=12|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_TgEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA12&amp;dq=%22Open+Source+Religion%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=KIAAVfW0JYmbyQSr6IHIBA&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;f=false|accessdate=11 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, [[Daniel Kriegman]] began describing a religion he invented called Ozacua (later Yoism) as "the world's first opensource religion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ozacua: the Living Religion (5 April 2001) |url=http://www.ozacua.com/ |website=ozacua.com |publisher=Daniel Kriegman |accessdate=11 March 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010419072235/http://www.ozacua.com/ |archivedate=April 19, 2001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lovink|first1=Geert|title=Dark Fiber: Tracking Critical Internet Culture|date=2002|publisher=MIT Press|isbn=0-262-12249-9|page=334|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p_7YWf9WpwYC&amp;pg=PA334&amp;dq=%22Open+Source+Religion%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=KIAAVfW0JYmbyQSr6IHIBA&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=religion&amp;f=false|accessdate=11 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of an "open source religion" was further expanded upon by the media theorist, [[Douglas Rushkoff]] in his book, ''Nothing's Sacred: The Truth about Judaism'' (2003), where he offered the following description as an introduction to [[Open Source Judaism]]:
:An open source religion would work the same way as open source software development: it is not kept secret or mysterious at all. Everyone contributes to the codes we use to comprehend our place in the universe. We allow our religion to evolve based on the active participation of its people....An open source relationship to religion would likewise take advantage of the individual points of view of its many active participants to develop its more resolved picture of the world and our place within it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rushkoff|first=Douglas|title=Nothing Sacred: The Truth about Judaism|year=2004|publisher=Three Rivers Press|location=USA|page=111|isbn=1400051398|url=http://www.rushkoff.com/nothing-sacred/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Discordianism, Copyleft, and open-source software===
[[File:Principia Discordia page "00075-Page 00088".jpg|thumb|Page of the Principia Discordia that includes the following Copyright disclaimer, "Ⓚ ALL RIGHTS REVERSED – Reprint what you like," the earliest example of what would become a declaration of [[copyleft]].]]
[[File:Circled latin capital letter k.svg|thumb|Discordian reference to the mythological Kallisti, or [[Apple of Discord]], by way of a kosher food symbol in place of a conventional Copyright symbol.]]
Before the coinage of the term [[open-source]] in 1998 or even the birth of the [[Free Software]] movement, the ''[[Principia Discordia]]'', a [[Discordian]] religious text written by [[Malaclypse the Younger|Greg Hill]] with [[Kerry Wendell Thornley]], included the following Copyright disclaimer in its 4th edition (1970), "Ⓚ ALL RIGHTS REVERSED – Reprint what you like." By the summer of 1970, the implications of the disclaimer were being discussed in other [[Underground Press|underground publications]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Clutterbuck|first1=Brenton|title=Chasing Eris: An Interlude on Copyleft|url=http://historiadiscordia.com/chasing-eris-an-interlude-on-copyleft/|website=Historia Discordia|accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:Commercial publishers are not likely to be interested in the ''Principia'' due, at least, to the counter copyright on it–for, if they had a good seller, then other publishers could print it out from under them. Consequently publication and distribution will have to occur spontaneously, thru the “underground”, as alternative cultures learn to meet their own needs and provide their own services. This non-commercial limitation of the ''Principia'' is to provide less limitations in other respects, and it is not an accident. The ''Principia'' is not simply a handbook, it is a demonstration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=The Greater Poop|date=July–August 1970|issue=30|page=1|url=http://historiadiscordia.com/greg-hills-discordian-newsletter-the-greater-poop/greg_hill-197007_08-the_greater_poop-poop30_page_00001/|accessdate=19 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Via the counterculture, by the mid-1970s, the concept had influenced a generation of Discordians including the nascent hacker culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Buxton|first1=Kristin|title=The Lifecycle of the Principia Discordia: The dissemination of the religion disguised as a joke and joke disguised as a religion|url=http://www.lazaruscorporation.co.uk/articles/principia-discordia|website=The Lazarus Corporation|accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project to create [[Tiny BASIC]] was proposed in Bob Albrecht and [[Dennis Allison]]'s ''[[Dr. Dobb's Journal|Dr. Dobb's Journal of Tiny BASIC Calisthenics &amp; Orthodontia]]'', a journal of the [[Homebrew Computer Club]], a small group of computer hobbyists who began meeting in 1975 around [[Silicon Valley]]. The first lines of the source code for Tiny Basic as released in 1976 by [[Li-Chen Wang]] stated ‘(ↄ) COPYLEFT ALL WRONGS RESERVED’. In 1984/5 programmer [[Don Hopkins]] sent [[Richard Stallman]] a letter labeled "[[Copyleft]]—[[all rights reversed]]". Stallman chose the phrase to identify his free software method of distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Open Sources: Voices from the Open Source Revolution |last= Stallman |first= Richard  |year= 1999 |publisher= O'Reilly Media |isbn= 1-56592-582-3 |pages= 59}}&lt;/ref&gt; The relationship between Discordianism and "Kopyleft" remain part of the culture of Discordianism, as explained by the Discordian Rev. Dr. Jon Swabey in his ''Apocrypha Discordia.''
:Discordianism and the concept of KopyLeft go hand in hand. Although just a small part of the counter-culture gestalt, I believe that the ''Principia Discordia'' was probably one of the earliest expressions and strongest champions of this idea, which has since seen such concepts as the [[Open Source Software]] initiative, with endeavours such as the [[Linux]] Operating System.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Swabey|first1=Jon|title=Apocrypha Discordia|date=2001|url=http://www.23ae.com/files/apocrypha2.pdf|accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Open-source in established religious traditions==
For established traditions whose canonical works, records of discourse, and inspired artworks reside in the [[public domain]], keeping these works open and available in the face of proprietary interests has inspired several open-source initiatives. Open access to resources and [[adaptive reuse]] of shared materials under [[open content]] licensing provide a structure by which communities can innovate new religious systems collaboratively under the aegis of copyright law. For some religious movements, however, [[public access]] and [[literacy]], and the potential of adaptive reuse also provide an opportunity for innovation and reform within established traditions. In an interview by [[Alan Jacobs (academic)|Alan Jacobs]] in ''[[The Atlantic]]'' magazine on open-source religion, Aharon Varady (founding director of the [[Open Siddur Project]]) explained that "cultures breathe creativity like we breathe oxygen" arguing that open-source provides one possible strategy for keeping a tradition vibrant while also preserving historical works as non-proprietary during a period of transition from analog to digital media.&lt;ref  name="jacobs"&gt;{{cite web|last=Jacobs|first=Alan|title=The Potential and Promise of Open-Source Judaism|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/06/the-potential-and-promise-of-open-source-judaism/258394/|work=The Atlantic Magazine Online|publisher=The Atlantic Magazine|accessdate=5 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Open-source Judaism===
Although a work of radical 1960s Jewish counterculture rather than an explicitly religious work, the satirical songbook ''Listen to the mocking bird'' (Times Change Press, 1971) by [[the Fugs]]' [[Tuli Kupferberg|Naphtali "Tuli" Kupferberg]] contains the earliest explicit mention of "copyleft" in a copyright disclaimer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kupferberg|first1=Naphtali|title=Listen to the Mocking Bird: Satiric Songs to Tunes You Know|date=1971|publisher=Times Change Press|location=Washington, New Jersey|url=https://archive.org/stream/2917619.0001.001.umich.edu#page/2/mode/2up|accessdate=11 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later [[Open Source Judaism|open-source efforts in Judaism]] begin to appear in 1988 with the [[free software]] code written for calculating the Hebrew calendar included in [[Emacs]]. After the popularization of the term "[[open-source]]" in 1998, essays and manifestos linking open-source and Judaism began appearing in 2002 among Jewish thinkers familiar with trends in new media and open-source software. In August 2002, Aharon Varady proposed the formation of an "[[Open Siddur Project|Open Siddur]]," an open-source licensed [[user-generated content]] project for digitizing liturgical materials and writing the code needed for the [[web-to-print]] publishing of [[Siddur]]im (Jewish prayer books).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Varady |first1=Aharon |title=update 2002-08-08 |url=http://aharon.varady.net/omphalos/2002/08/update-2002-08-08 |website=Aharon's Omphalos |publisher=Aharon Varady |accessdate=16 June 2014 }} and {{cite web|last=Varady |first=Aharon |title=The Open Siddur Project |url=http://varady.net/open_siddur/ |work=Aharon Varady's Homepage |publisher=The Internet Archive's Wayback Machine |accessdate=5 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021013153654/http://varady.net/open_siddur/ |archivedate=October 13, 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, media theorist [[Douglas Rushkoff]] began articulating his understanding of open-source in Judaism. "The object of the game, for me," Rushkoff explained, "was to recontextualize Judaism as an entirely Open Source proposition."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rushkoff |first1=Douglas |title=Open-Source Religion |url=http://www.g4tv.com/screensavers/features/44075/OpenSource_Religion.html |website=G4 TV - The Screen Savers |publisher=G4 TV |accessdate=23 January 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312093353/http://www.g4tv.com/screensavers/features/44075/OpenSource_Religion.html |archivedate=March 12, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Open-Source Judaism.svg|thumb|Open-Source Judaism logo]]
The term "Open Source Judaism" first appeared in [[Douglas Rushkoff]]'s book ''Nothing Sacred: The Truth about Judaism'' (2003). Rushkoff employed the term "Open Source" to describe a democratic organizational model for collaborating in a commonly held source: the [[Hebrew Bible]] and other essential works of [[Rabbinic Judaism]]. Rushkoff conceived of Judaism as essentially an open-source religion which he conceived as, "the contention that religion is not a pre-existing truth but an ongoing project. It may be divinely inspired, but it is a creation of human beings working together. A collaboration."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rushkoff|first=Douglas|title=Nothing Sacred: The Truth about Judaism|year=2004|publisher=Three Rivers Press|location=USA|isbn=1400051398|url=http://www.rushkoff.com/nothing-sacred/}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Rushkoff, open-source offered the promise of enacting change through a new culture of collaboration and improved access to sources. "Anyone who wants to do Judaism should have access to Judaism. Judaism is not just something that you do, it's something you enact. You've got to learn the code in order to alter it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lehmann-Haupt|first=Rachel|title=Is Judaism Becoming Irrelevant?|url=http://www.alternet.org/story/16146/is_judaism_becoming_irrelevant|accessdate=7 December 2013|newspaper=AlterNet|date=2003-06-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2003 publication of Rushkoff's book ''Nothing Sacred: The Truth about Judaism''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.rushkoff.com/nothingsacred.html|title=Nothing Sacred: The Truth about Judaism|author=Douglas Rushkoff|publisher=Three Rivers Press|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an online forum dedicated to "Open Source Judaism" inspired several online projects in creating web applications for generating custom made [[haggadah|haggadot]] for [[Passover]], however neither content nor code for these were shared under [[free content|free-culture]] [[license compatibility|compatible]] [[open content]] terms.

Beginning with the [[Open Siddur Project]] in 2009, open-source projects in Judaism began to publicly share their software code with open-source licenses and their content with [[free content|free-culture]] [[license compatibility|compatible]] [[open content]] licenses. The explicit objectives of these projects also began to differ from Rushkoff's "Open Source Judaism." Rather than seek reforms in religious practices or doctrines, these projects used Open Content licenses to empower users to access and create their own resources from a common store of canonical texts and associated translations and metadata. By 2012, [[Open Source Judaism|open-source projects in Judaism]] were mainly active in facilitating collaboration in sharing resources for transcribing and translating existing works in the Public Domain, and for adaptation and dissemination of works being shared by copyright owners under Open Content licenses.&lt;ref name="jacobs"/&gt;

===Open-source Yoga===
Following proprietary claims on Yoga movements by some Yoga instructors, Open Source Yoga Unity was formed in 2003 to assert that Yoga movements reside in the [[public domain]]. The organization provides a common voice, and the pooling of resources, to legally resist the application of a proprietary [[Copyright]] to any Yoga style thereby "ensuring its continued natural unfettered practice for all to enjoy and develop." The organization explains, that "while we appreciate the teachings of yoga teachers, we do not believe that they have the legal right to impose control over another's Yoga teaching or practice."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Open Source Yoga Unity|url=https://www.facebook.com/yogaunity/info?tab=page_info|website=Open Source Yoga Unity Facebook Page|publisher=Facebook|accessdate=22 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Open Source Yoga Unity v. Bikram Choudhury (2005), the organization settled out of court, avoiding a federal court hearing to determine whether Bikram Choudhury’s copyrighted sequence of 26 poses and two breathing exercises could be legally protected.&lt;ref&gt;Open Source Yoga Unity v. Bikram Choudhury (N.D. Cal., 4/1/05, No. C 03–3182 PJH)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Open-source Wicca===
Concerned with the lack of a source text containing documentation on [[Wicca]] in the tradition of [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]], Dr. [[Leo Ruickbie]] self-published ''Open Source Wicca: The Gardnerian Tradition'' (2007) for "putting you back in control of spirituality." The work, a collection of "the original foundation documents of Wicca" authored between 1949 and 1961, was published [http://www.witchology.com/contents/opensourcewicca/gardnerianindex.php digitally] and in print under a [[Creative Commons]] [[Attribution (copyright)|Attribution]] license.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ruickbie|first1=Leo|title=Open Source Wicca|url=http://p2pfoundation.net/Open_Source_Wicca|publisher=Leo Ruickbie|accessdate=23 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Open-source in establishing new religions==
Several projects aiding individuals and communities in formulating their own belief systems cite inspiration from ideas common to the [[open-source movement]] and self-identify as open-source religions or religious initiatives. The establishment of new religions through open-source methods is closely related to [[chaos magic]], which emphasizes the pragmatic use of belief systems and the creation of new and unorthodox methods,&lt;ref name="New Encyclopedia of the Occult"&gt;{{cite book|last=Greer|first=John Michael|title=The New Encyclopedia of the Occult|year=2003|publisher=Llewellyn Publications|location=St. Paul, MN|isbn=9781567183368|pages=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; the difference being that any knowledge gained through such innovation is shared openly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=A.o.C.|first1=Fra.|title=Open Source Magic|url=http://osogd.org/library/the-aerodynamic-biscuits/142-2/|publisher=Open Source Order of the Golden Dawn|accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yoism===
[[File:Yoism symbol.svg|thumb|Yoism]]
According to its founder, [[Daniel Kriegman]], Yoism (founded 1994) combines rational inquiry, empiricism, and science with [[Spinoza]]n or [[Einstein]]ian [[pantheism]].&lt;ref name=DemocratAndChronile&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.yoism.org/?q=node/409|title=Civil commitment still evolving in N.Y.|author=Gary Craig|date=2011-04-11|publisher=Rochester Democrat and Chronicle}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url= http://www.yoism.org/?q=node/395|title=Open to Revisions|first=Sam|last=Kean|date=May–June 2009|work=Search Magazine|accessdate=2010-09-19|quote=[Daniel Kriegman] based the [...] religion on a cocktail of rational inquiry, empiricism, and science.

===Belief Genome Project===
The Belief Genome Project aims to use [[crowdsourcing]] to catalog all beliefs as a resource for those wishing to build and discover their own belief system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jones|first1=Sidian M.S.|title=Open Source Religion Basics|url=http://www.opensourcereligion.net/page/open-source-religion-basics|website=OpenSourceReligion.net|publisher=Sidian M.S. Jones|accessdate=23 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project is an initiative of the [https://web.archive.org/web/20100402231809/http://www.opensourcereligion.net/ Open Source Religion Social Network] , a website established in 2009 by Sidian M.S. Jones which he described as "a system for the mixing of religious and non-religious beliefs in an individual, even across multiple religions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jones|first1=Sidian M.S.|title=Open Source Religion|url=http://opensourcereligion.net|website=OpenSourceReligion.net|publisher=Sidian M.S. Jones|accessdate=23 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human Worship===

Human Worship, or Open Religion, is an "eternal tradition of considering [[Human]] absolute, highest value", "considering God as Human continuation to infinity through Soul", described in its sacred book, shared in [[public domain]] by the formula "[[All rights reserved]] for [[God]]. Open Soul Holy [[Scripture]] of Human Worship is word of God, common heritage of Humankind, published anonymously, free for copying".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Open Soul: Holy Scripture of Human Worship|url=https://www.academia.edu/34660139/Open_Soul_Holy_Scripture_of_Human_Worship|website=Academia.edu|accessdate=5 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The blessing gesture and sacred sign of Open Religion is the [[circle]] or [[zero]],  with the human in the center of [[coordinates]]. Human Worshippers bow to every human [[soul]], laying the hand on [[heart]] and saying "Believe in yourself!". They organize "soul societies" for [[missionary]] work, [[friendship]], [[love]] and common [[joy]]. Also they believe in every human  having the capacity to be a [[prophet]], every human action to be [[prayer]] and all consequences as [[revelation]] from God, claiming that practical experience inspires true [[faith]] and [[skeptics]] are the same holy persons as prophets.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10492">'''Peter Herrmann''' is a social philosopher of German origin. Between 1995 and 2013 he worked in [[Ireland]] where he occupied at the end the position of a senior research fellow at [[University College Cork]], School of Applied Social Studies. 2013 he moved to [[Rome]], Italy where he worked independently, but in close connection with the Italian research institute [[EURISPES]]. From 2015 to 2017 he worked as Professor for Economics at Bangor College of Central South University of Forestry &amp; Technology, ChangSha, PRC, and as Senior Foreign Expert. School of Public Affairs, Dept. of Social Security and Risk Management, Zhejiang University, HangZhou, P.R.China. In September 2017 he commenced a one-year research position at the Max Planck Institute for Social Law and Social Policy in Munich, Bavaria, from where he changed in October 2018 to the Faculty of Economics and Sociology at the University of Lodz in Poland.

Besides, he is associate professor at the Department of Social Sciences of the University of Eastern Finland [www.uef.fi]  and he holds a permanent visiting professorship as honorary associate professor at the Corvinus University [http://www.uni-corvinus.hu/index.php?id=44509] (Faculty of Social Sciences and International Relations, Institute of World Economy) in Budapest, Hungary. Since November 2013 he is also Visiting Scholar at the Department of Chinese Studies at NUI Maynooth [https://www.maynoothuniversity.ie/chinese/chinese-studies-staff] , Ireland.

Until 2013 he had been director of the independent research institute ESOSC (European Social, Organisational and Science Consultancy) with headquarter in Aghabullogue, Ireland. After the move to Italy the work of the institute had been discontinued.

== Personal life ==
Herrmann was born into a bourgeois family and had been brought up in a protestant milieu, however without being embedded in a strictly religious environment.
During his youth he had been politically engaged in different ways, distancing himself increasingly from his family background.
At the end of his studies he married – from the marriage, which had been later divorced, he has one daughter, Franziska Herrmann, who lives in Germany.

== Academic career ==

Herrmann studied sociology ([[Bielefeld]]), political science ([[Leipzig]]) and economics ([[Hamburg]]). 1981 he obtained the diploma in sociology from the university in Bielefeld [https://www.uni-bielefeld.de/(en)/index.html] and his doctorate in philosophy in 1992 from the university in Bremen [http://www.uni-bremen.de/en.html] .
At the institute for local social policy and non-profit organisations in Bremen, Herrmann analysed in close cooperation with [[Rudolph Bauer]] and Jürgen Blandow the politics and policies of non-governmental organisations.
He focused on the meaning of the process of European integration for national social policy and the impact on the third sector.

== Research ==

While studying sociology, Herrmann concentrated on sociology of organisations – this had been also the subject of his PhD-dissertation, titled “Society and organisation. An analysis of modern society” (Rheinfelden/Berlin: Schäuble, 1994). This work integrated topics of social policy, civil society, theory of modernisation and general philosophy. His methodological thinking had been and still is influenced by historical and dialectical materialism, systems theory and the theory of civilisation. Against this background he undertook several studies, especially in the area of European integration.

Based on Herrmann’s experience gained from the work at the Platform of Social NGOs [http://www.socialplatform.org] and the European Social Action Network (ESAN), he took an increasingly critical position towards the subtle mechanisms of the process of European integration.

At a very early stage Herrmann discussed and theorised processes he saw as “politics bypassing the nation state” (see European Integration between Institution Building and Social Process. Contributions to a Theory of Modernisation and NGOs in the Context of the Development of the EU; New York: Nova Science, 1998 [https://books.google.com/books?id=6WtMgD-pQSUC&amp;pg=PA9&amp;lpg=PA9&amp;dq=European+Integration+between+Institution+Building+and+Social+Process&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=-0FNzbsvEZ&amp;sig=SnRfRB96LiA_jp0y3AN1SkHScXc&amp;hl=it&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwAGoVChMInYqmqOytyAIVyKWICh19SwqU#v=onepage&amp;q=European%20Integration%20between%20Institution%20Building%20and%20Social%20Process&amp;f=false]) and which became later known under the term “[[multilevel governance]]”.

The close cooperation with the European Foundation on Social Quality and later International Association for Social Quality www.socialquality.eu, namely with Laurent van der Maesen, pushed his analytical interest towards the search for alternatives. His thorough research, geared against political voluntarism and based in a systematic analysis of forms of government and the respective social policy gave important impulses for the debates on social quality thinking.

Research visits in – amongst others – Australia (at the Cairns Institute [http://www.jcu.edu.au/cairnsinstitute/]), Austria, France, Germany, Hungary (there at the ELTE - Eötvös Loránd university [http://www.elte.hu/en]  in connection with [[Zsuzsa Ferge]]), Sweden, Taiwan (on invitation of the Institute of Humanities and Social Science) and Turkey (at ODTÜ - Orta Doğu Teknik Üniversitesi [http://www.metu.edu.tr/] , supported by TÜBİTAK - Türkiye bilimsel ve Teknolojik Arastirma) strengthened his critical attitude towards traditional approaches of social policy. Increasingly important had been his orientation on a critique of political economy.

Beyond the contacts mentioned before, further cooperation is important and three references are crucial.
Together with the Austrian political scientist and one of the founders of quantitative world systems research, [[Arno Tausch]], Herrmann elaborated some publications. This acquainted Herrmann more with [[world-systems theory]]. It also meant strengthening his orientation on a critique of political economy. With Herrmann’s cooperation with the French Marxist economist [[Paul Boccara]] he linked his work closely with the question of the general role of the state. The common work contributed not least to Herrmann’s orientation on the work of the French regulationist approach.

Based on this work he had been able to strengthen the attempts of locating the work on [[Social Quality]] within the framework of world systems theory. Currently his work focuses on establishing a political economic perspective as essential part of the social quality approach. Of special importance is the regulationist theory which is at the same time developed further by being applied within a different framework.

Moreover, Herrmann is correspondent to the Max Planck Institute for Social Policy and Social Law [http://www.mpisoc.mpg.de/2285/en] (previously Max-Planck Institute for Foreign and International Social Law) in [[Munich]], Germany. This allowed him to study more closely the ambiguity of social and human rights law – issues he discussed in particular in his collaboration with [[Hans F. Zacher]]. Especially with reference to Zacher he worked on the consideration of the “pre-legal” determination of law, thus allowing nit least an integration with political economy.

His academic work is not least expressed in his engagement as member of the scientific council of the German branch of attac [https://web.archive.org/web/20150714051300/http://www.attac-netzwerk.de/das-netzwerk/wissenschaftlicher-beirat/startseite/] and in the EuroMemo Group [http://www.euromemo.eu]  – a network of economists that is looking for alternative policies.

The different connections, Herrmann established over time, based on the wide range of topics, linked him since 2011 also to the work of the Eurasian Center for Big History and System Forecasting at the Moscow State University, in particular collaborating with [[Andrey Korotayev]] and [[Leonid Grinin]], Russia, the All-Russian Centre of Living Standard [https://web.archive.org/web/20040505045234/http://www.vcug.ru/ Moscow], and the Plekhanov Russian University of Economics [http://eng.rea.ru], Moscow.

== Current activities ==

After his move to [[Rome]], Italy, Herrmann developed independently, but also as member of the scientific council of EURISPES [www.eurispes.eu] (Istituto di Studi Politici, Economici e Sociali), his research. Important contacts for further developments could be established to the University La Sapienza [http://en.uniroma1.it], Rome, the university Pontificia Università San Tommaso d’Aquino – Angelicum https://web.archive.org/web/20180314052843/http://pust.it/ of the Vatican www.vatican.va, the Hungarian academy of science http://mta.hu/english/, namely Ferenc Bodi. Furthermore he developed working relations to the research unit Centro de Investigaciones de Política Internacional (CIPI) [http://www.cipi.cu] at the foreign ministry in [[Cuba]] as well as to the School of Public Affairs, Department of Social Security and Risk Management at Zhejiang University [http://www.zju.edu.cn/english/] and the Bangor College at CSUFT Central South University of Forestry and Technology [http://english.csuft.edu.cn] in the People's Republic of [[China]] where he is working from early 2015.
According to his entries on [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Peter_Herrmann researchgate], his work is currently focusing on issues of digitisation. While he sees it in part as challenge around social security and employment law. his main interest aims on clarifying the meaning of ongoing processes for the existing mode of production.

In 2015 he donated his books (as far as they had not been lost during the various moves) to EURIPSES [www.eurispes.ie], hoping that they will be in this way available for the wider public for research.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26828">'''Polka in the United States''' refers to [[polka]]—a [[music]] and [[dance]] style that originated in Europe in the 1830s and came to American society when people immigrated from [[Eastern Europe]]. A fast style in 2/4 time, and often associated with the pre–[[World War II]] era, polka remains a dynamic "[[niche market|niche]]" music in America.

==Description==
Several polka genres exist in the United States, each with its own unique characteristics and performers. Though these polka genres vary, all are unified in the expression of ethnicity by performers and participants. Polka enthusiasts gather to enjoy their love of the music and dance and to honor their heritage at polka festivals. Modern media enables these fans to stay connected and share their passion. Though it passed its heyday in the 1950s&lt;ref name="Greene"&gt;Greene, Victor, ''A Passion for Polka''. Berkeley and Los Angeles, CA: University of California Press, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; the polka remains an active music form with distinct genres, leading performers, and active organizations. Where it is popular, the polka is a manifestation of the culture of those who participate in it. It is the state dance of Wisconsin.&lt;ref name="WisBB"&gt;[http://legis.wisconsin.gov/lrb/bb/09bb/symbolsgallery.htm Wisconsin Blue Book, 2009-2010] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111120221608/http://legis.wisconsin.gov/lrb/bb/09bb/symbolsgallery.htm |date=2011-11-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Polka genres==
Although author Charles Keil admits that "there are as many styles of polka as there are polka localities",&lt;ref name="KeilDeeper"&gt;Keil, Charles, ''Deeper Polka'', Ethnomusicology Forum 14.1 (2005): 118-120&lt;/ref&gt; he and his wife have divided American polka music into three major genres:

# Slavic, with its subgenres, Polish-American, Czech-American, and Slovenian-American
# Germanic, with its subgenres, German-American 
# Southwestern, with its subgenres, Mexican-American and Papago-Pima&lt;ref name="KeilHappy"&gt;Keil Charles, ''Polka Happiness'', Philadelphia, PE: Temple University Press, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

The two Slavic genres are found in eastern and midwestern America, the Germanic genres in midwestern and western America, and the Southwestern genres in southwestern America. The different genres are united by the characteristic 2/4 time signature that exists in all polkas as well as by instruments and lyrics that are similar throughout all styles. Polka bands across all genres typically include an accordion or concertina, wind instruments, and drums. The lyrics sung by these bands are united by their discussion of joy, religion, and ethnic culture.&lt;ref name="Jackson"&gt;Jackson, David, ''Just Another Day in a New Polonia: Contemporary Polish-American Polka Music'', Popular Music and Society 26.4 (2003): 529-540&lt;/ref&gt; Differences stem from variations in instrumentation, tempo, and the popularity of the genre in various places.

===Polish-American===
The Polish-American style of polka is perhaps the most popular today.&lt;ref name="BessmanMonarch"&gt;Bessman, Jim, ''Monarchs of the U.S. Polka Mainstream'', Billboard 108.31 (1996): 1, 110-112&lt;/ref&gt; Polish Polka bands do not only play polkas, but also play [[oberek]]s, [[waltz]]es, and sometimes tangos. In fact, the "Polish polka" as we know it was never danced in Poland. Rather, different forms of polka existed in Polish folk dancing. This popularity is due in part to the fact that performers in this genre have worked to appeal to a larger audience by adding covers of modern music alongside normal polkas in their albums and performances. For example, the polka band Toledo Polka Motion includes a cover of the Beatles' "I'm a Loser" along with traditional pieces such as "Pod Krakowem" on one of their albums.&lt;ref name="Jackson"/&gt; Polka star [[Jimmy Sturr]] has even included recordings with stars such as [[Willie Nelson]] to get the country music audience interested in polka. The hotspots for Polish-American polka are mostly in cities near the Great Lakes (especially Chicago) and some East Coast cities.&lt;ref name="March"&gt;March, Richard, ''Review: Slovenian- and Polish-American "Polka" Music'', The Journal of American Folklore 102.403 (1989): 81-85&lt;/ref&gt;

Polish-American polka can be subdivided into Chicago-style and Eastern-style. The typical Chicago-style polka band includes one or two trumpets, an accordion, a concertina, drums, a bass, and sometimes a clarinet, saxophone, or fiddle.&lt;ref name="BessmanMonarch"/&gt; This style is connected to the '50s rock-and-roll era and is sometimes referred to as "push" style because of the intense "bellow-shaking" of the accordion.&lt;ref name="BessmanMonarch"/&gt; A secondary style of Chicago-style polka music is referred to as "honky" style; this consists of a trumpet, clarinet (doubling on saxophone), concertina or accordion, upright bass (or bass guitar), &amp; drums. It is performed in a dixieland style, and sung primarily in the Polish language. Most polka artists add a piano on recordings for embellishment. The modern giants of Chicago-style are [[Lenny Gomulka]] and the late [[Eddie Blazonczyk]]. Both were highly influenced by the style of [[Walter Jagiello|Li'l Wally Jagiello]], a polka performer of an earlier generation. Another influential early pioneer of Chicago-style polkas was Marion Lush who has been called the "Golden Voice" of polkas due to his distinctive vocal stylings. (Lush died in 1993.) Blazonczyk was the leader of a band called the Versatones, who released over 50 albums.&lt;ref name="Jackson"/&gt; (Blazonczyk died in 2012.) Gomulka was a member of the Versatones until 1980 when he formed his own band, the Chicago Push.&lt;ref&gt;Bessman, Jim. "Chicago Push Forges 'Irresistible' Polka." Billboard 108.37 (1996): 12&lt;/ref&gt; Some other popular modern Chicago-style polka bands include Crusade, the Polka Family, the Dynatones, and Toledo Polka Motion.&lt;ref name="March"/&gt; In important venue for live performances of polka music was Club 505 at 13505 S Brainard Ave in the Hegewisch neighborhood on the Southeast side of Chicago. A live broadcast from Club 505 from 1959 can be heard on YouTube.

Eastern-style polka is similar to Chicago style but is played at a faster tempo, usually includes a bigger section of horns and reeds, and is connected to big-band era music rather than rock-and-roll. The most popular Eastern-style performer (and probably the most popular polka artist in America today) is [[Jimmy Sturr]], winner of 15 [[Grammy Award]]s in the polka category.&lt;ref name="Meredith"&gt;Meredith, Bill, ''Jimmy Knows Polka'', Jazziz 23.6 (2006): 48&lt;/ref&gt; Other important Eastern-style performers include Frank Wojnarowski, Bernie Witkowski, and the Connecticut Twins.&lt;ref name="March"/&gt;

===Slovenian-American===
The [[Slovenian-style polka|Slovenian style]] is generally played at a faster tempo and features different instrumentation. Whereas the Polish style utilizes trumpets and concertinas, the main melody instruments in the Slovenian band are the accordion and tenor saxophone. (often doubling on flute &amp; clarinet during waltzes)  A button accordion or "button box" is sometimes used instead of the piano accordion or chromatic accordion and offers a different sound.  The Slovenian style also adds a banjo or guitar to bolster the rhythm section (most commonly banjo for polkas and guitar for waltzes). The epicenter of the Slovenian-American style of polka is undoubtedly Cleveland and northeast Ohio, but it is also popular in Pennsylvania and in many other cities in the Great Lakes region. The most influential figure in Slovenian-American polka is [[Frankie Yankovic]], who helped "Americanize" the Slovenian polka and worked for years to popularize it, appearing throughout the country and even performing on [[The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson]]. Other important Slovenian-style pioneers include Tony Jalovec - The Polka Maestre - Johnny Pecon, Lou Trebar, Johnny Vadnal (along with brothers Tony, Frankie, and Richie),Tony Jalovec-Polka Maestre-Canada, Kenny Bass, and Eddie Habat. The torchbearers of Slovenian-American or "Cleveland-Style" polka today include Jeff Pecon (Johnny's son), Joey Tomsick, Don Wojtila, Eddie Rodick, Bob Kravos and Eric Noltkamper. Like their Polish counterparts, these bands have also expanded their repertoire over the years to include a variety of styles of music including polkas, waltzes, American standards, Latin dances ([[Cha-cha-cha (music)|cha cha]]s, [[Tango music|tango]]s, etc.), [[line dance]]s, and rock 'n roll.

===German-American===
German-American bands resist being termed "polka bands" because they perform not only polkas but also [[waltz]]es, [[schottische]]s, [[Ländler|laendlers]], and various other ethnic forms of music.&lt;ref name="Leary"&gt;Leary, James, ''Review: Czech- and German-American "Polka" Music'', The Journal of American Folklore 101.401 (1988): 339-345&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the Modern day German-American bands have even been known to incorporate Country &amp; Western and/or Rock &amp; Roll into their repertoire. They prefer the term "old-time." Their style is also sometimes known as "Dutchmen," a name derived from a band named The [[Six Fat Dutchmen]].&lt;ref name="Leary"/&gt; This is a contrast to Polish-American and Slovenian-American bands, which generally do not object to the term "polka band".&lt;ref name="March"/&gt; German-American bands are also comparatively more traditional than the Slavic genres, with less modern American influence in their albums. Because of this, their recordings are much rarer and harder to come by than recordings of Slavic-style performers. The German-American sound is often described with the term "oom-pa-pa" and is characterized by an emphasis on brass (especially the tuba), accompanied by drums and reed instruments (including the accordion or concertina, although for the most part the concertina is usually favored over the accordion in German-American bands).&lt;ref name="Leary"/&gt; German-American style bands perform primarily in the so-called "polka belt" of North and South Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas.&lt;ref name="deHilster"&gt;deHilster, Addie, ''Polka in the Plains'', South Central Music Bulletin 2.2 (2004): 8-12&lt;/ref&gt; One important German-American performer is [[Lawrence Welk]], who began his career as a band leader in South Dakota with an ethnic German-style ensemble called Welk's Novelty Orchestra. He later added more popular music to his band's repertoire, which enabled him to spread the polka throughout America by way of his famous television show.&lt;ref name="deHilster"/&gt; Other important modern German-American bands include the Hoolerie Dutchmen, the Jolly Swiss Boys, Happy Hans,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.happyhansmusic.com/&lt;/ref&gt; and the Jerry Schneider Band.&lt;ref name="Leary"/&gt;

===Czech-American===
Czech-American style polka is similar to German-American style in many ways. Its performers call their bands "old-time," use the same brass-heavy instrumentation, and are popular in the same "polka belt."&lt;ref name="Leary"/&gt; Czech-American bands tend to be even more traditional than German-American bands, playing numerous authentic Czech pieces (polkas, waltzes, and schottisches).&lt;ref name="deHilster"/&gt; Another unique aspect of many Czech bands is their family structure. Some Czech bands perpetuate a family structure through several generations. An example is the Masopust Polka Band,&lt;ref name="Masopust Polka Band"&gt;[https://sites.google.com/a/masopust.us/masopustpolkaband/home Masopust Polka Band Website]&lt;/ref&gt; which was started by the Masopust family in the late nineteenth century and still plays today.&lt;ref name="deHilster"/&gt; Important Czech performers include the Harold Schultz Orchestra, the Greiner Brothers Orchestra, the Capital City Czech Choraliers of Nebraska, the Czechlanders Orchestra of Nebraska, Ernie Kucera, and Al Grebnik.&lt;ref name="Leary"/&gt;

===Mexican-American===
Not as obviously related to the polka as the four genres above, Mexican-American polka is called "[[conjunto]]".&lt;ref name="deHilster"/&gt; The conjunto sound originated from the Czech and German influence on Mexican-Americans in Texas and northern Mexico. Conjunto bands play some polkas, but their most popular musical form is the ''[[ranchera]],'' a form similar to polka. The instrumentation involves a combination of accordion, [[bajo sexto]] (a Mexican twelve-string guitar), bass, and drums.&lt;ref name="BessmanMonarch"/&gt; Important modern performers in the genre include Los Hermanos Bernal, Santiago Jimenez, [[Flaco Jimenez]], [[Esteban Jordan]], Valerio Longoria, and [[Tony De La Rosa (Tejano musician)|Tony De La Rosa]] among many others.

===Papago-Pima===
Papago-Pima style is more commonly referred to as "chicken scratch" and is associated with the Native American [[Tohono O'odham]] tribe (who were once the Papago).&lt;ref name="BessmanMonarch"/&gt; This tribe was influenced by the music of the Germans who settled in southern Arizona, the most popular area for this genre. Papago-Pima performers use a saxophone, accordion, guitar, electric bass, and drums in their performances and commonly perform music that follows the form of the schottische (a dance with the same cultural origins as polka).&lt;ref name="Sturman"&gt;Sturman, Janet, ''Borderlands: From Conjunto to Chicken Scratch. Music from the Rio Grande Valley of Texas and Southern Arizona'', ''[[Yearbook for Traditional Music]]'', 27 (1995): 194-197&lt;/ref&gt; The most important modern performers in this genre are Southern Scratch, the Joaquin Brothers, Papago Raiders, the Molinas, and T.O. Brave.

===Other genres===
While Keil's six genres cover the majority of polka performers, other polka bands combine these genres or exist outside of them altogether. [[Brave Combo]] is one important modern group that plays a combination of these three genres with a very modern edge. Started in 1979 by [[Carl Finch]], this band is the ultimate in appealing to a wider, younger audience. In addition to accordion, tuba, woodwinds, drum, and trumpet, the instrumentation of the band includes guitar, electric horn, and harmonica. According to Finch, the genre of the band has "no restrictions." They play everything from Polish-style to rancheras to Greek music.

To appeal to younger audiences, the band uses album covers that make the band look like a rock group and edgy album titles such as ''Kick Ass Polkas''.&lt;ref name="White"&gt;White, Timothy, ''Brave Combo's Kick-Ass Bohemianism'', Billboard 113.34 (2001): 3&lt;/ref&gt; Their music is popular enough in the polka world that their 1999 album, ''Polkasonic'', won a Grammy in the polka category. Brave Combo is an example of the way some polka bands have tried to break free of the restrictions of genre and adapt to modern culture.

==Polka organizations==
From tiny ethnic dance halls to larger-scale national organizations, there is a huge network of people working to keep the polka alive. One Web site lists a total of 49 formal polka clubs nationwide, and there are many other smaller organizations [http://www.polkabob.com/p-clubs.html]. The largest organizations today include the [[International Polka Association]] (IPA), the United States Polka Association, the Polka Lovers Klub of America (Po.L.K. of A.), the Cleveland-Style Polka Hall of Fame, the Penn-Ohio Polka Pals, and the Wisconsin Polka Boosters.&lt;ref name="Greene"/&gt; Modern communication has also allowed polka fans to organize through national newsletters such as the Polish-American Journal, and the Post Eagle. Polka news is even available online at [https://web.archive.org/web/20071217132301/http://www.poloniatoday.com/polka.htm Polonia Today]. Radio stations have been organized to perpetuate the popularity of the polka. (although nowadays, most polka shows have been limited to airing on independent &amp; [[Brokered programming|time-brokered]] AM stations, small-market college FM stations, and a handful of Internet only polka stations.) One survey conducted in 1989 counted a total of 354 stations that played polka music in 32 states.&lt;ref name="Greene"/&gt; (By September 2012, that number had dropped to 221 stations in 27 states.)   Another triumph for the polka community came in 1985 when the [[National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences]] formed a polka category so that polka artists could be recognized at the Grammy Awards ceremony.&lt;ref name="Greene"/&gt;

===The International Polka Association===

The longest-standing and most influential polka organization by far is the Chicago-based International Polka Association (IPA). Beginning as an "International Polka Convention" in the mid-1960s, the IPA was officially established in 1968 with Leon Kozicki as the "organization builder" and John Hyzny as the "entrepreneur".&lt;ref name="KeilHappy"/&gt; According to its charter, its goals are "to promote, maintain, and advance public interest in polka entertainment".&lt;ref name="KeilHappy"/&gt; Today, the IPA still carries out yearly conventions every summer to allow polka fans to gather and to present the annual Polka Music Awards. The IPA established the Polka Music Hall of Fame in 1968 to honor worthy performers. In 1982, a building was established to house the [[Polka Hall of Fame|Polka Music Hall of Fame and Museum]].&lt;ref name="KeilHappy"/&gt;

==Polka festivals==
Throughout the United States (and especially through the so-called "polka belt"), polka fans gather to participate in polka festivals. Many of these festivals are arranged by organizations such as the IPA and the United States Polka Association. Others, such as Polish-style performer Eddie Blazoncyzk's "Polka Fireworks" festival in Pittsburgh, are run by polka stars or polka fans.&lt;ref name="Horak"&gt;Horak, Terri, ''Festivals Drawing Growing Fan Base'', Billboard 108.31 (1996): 1, 111&lt;/ref&gt;

These festivals usually last several days and involve performances, dancing, jam sessions, beer, ethnic food, athletic events, parades, and polka masses.&lt;ref name="Horak"/&gt; Though many festival attendees belong to an older generation, there are also a substantial number of young participants.&lt;ref name="Horak"/&gt; Polka music and polka festivals are often described as "happy" and "joyful" by their organizers and participants. In their book Polka Happiness, Charles and Angeliki Keil describe the aspects of these "polka parties" that allow them to bring joy to people of all ages. A wide variety of people are accepted and people are encouraged to dance with many different partners. The musicians dance as well as perform. The live bands perform a variety of more modern music as well as traditional polkas. Participants drink enough to get "silly or happy," but not enough to get drunk.&lt;ref name="KeilHappy"/&gt;

The Nebraska Czechs of Wilber (P.O. Box 652  Wilber, Nebraska 68465) have sponsored the annual Wilber Czech Days Festival since 1962. The Czech Festival includes music, dancing, museum, costumes, refreshments, a pageant and large parades on Saturday and Sunday of the festival.  The Nebraska Czechs of Wilber organization was formed in 1962 to perpetuate the Czech heritage and culture, develop tourism and to boost the economy of Wilber. On July 17th, 1963, Wilber was proclaimed ‘Czech Capital of Nebraska.’  On July 10th, 1987, Wilber was proclaimed, ‘Czech Capital of the U.S.A.’  The festival is always held the first full weekend of August.  http://www.nebraskaczechsofwilber.com/czech-days/

Other Polka Festivals include, the United States Polka Association Convention, [[The Annual Minnesota State Polka Festival]], Milwaukee Polish Fest, International Polka Association Convention, [[Pulaski Polka Days]], [[New Glarus, Wisconsin|New Glarus]] Polkafest, [[Wisconsin Dells Polish Fest]], Frankenmuth Summer Music Fest, [http://oregonalpenfest.com Oregon's Alpenfest Swiss-Bavarian festival], Polkamotion by the Ocean, Houghton Lake Polka Festival, SloveneFest, and Tony Petkovsek's Thanksgiving Polka Weekend.

==Polka masses==
Beginning in the early 1970s, the phenomenon of "polka masses" began appearing. Polka masses are usually held by members of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] who consider the polka an important part of their ethnic heritages. The first polka mass was created by Father George Balasko in 1972 and the idea was spread by Father Frank Perkovich throughout the '70s and '80s.&lt;ref name="Walser"&gt;Walser, Robert, ''The Polka Mass: Music of Postmodern Ethnicity'', American Music 10.2 (1992): 183-202&lt;/ref&gt; Both were polka musicians. In composing a polka mass, a musician either alters the lyrics of polka pieces to become more appropriate for a spiritual setting or creates an entirely new piece of polka-style music to sing with the usual sacred text.&lt;ref name="Walser"/&gt; Robert Walser argues that the exuberant polka music motivates participants to "worship more vigorously." He also asserts that the polka mass "brings the community into the church" because it involves music and lyrics that the congregations are more familiar with.&lt;ref name="Walser"/&gt;

==Polka music as an expression of culture==
Polka music is obviously associated with various ethnic groups throughout America. This is evident in the division of the polka genres into specific ethnic styles. Dr. Ann Hetzel Gunkel describes the polka as a means of protecting ethnic heritage from the invasion of "American mass culture." She even argues that polka music can be perceived as a "radical alternative" to "mainstream culture".&lt;ref name="Gunkel"&gt;Gunkel, Ann, ''The Polka Alternative: Polka as Counterhegemonic Ethnic Practice'', Popular Music and Society 27.4 (2004): 407-427&lt;/ref&gt; A good example of this is the polka mass. It allows entire communities to choose an alternate approach to worship that helps them preserve their ethnic origins.&lt;ref name="Walser"/&gt; Another example of a resistance to mass culture is the status of polka stars. Popular polka performers are not viewed as sex symbols &lt;ref name="KeilHappy"/&gt; or idolized in the same way that pop stars of today are idolized.&lt;ref name="Gunkel"/&gt; Instead, the performers work to establish a feeling of community by interacting and dancing with their audience. This expression of ethnicity is especially important as America continues to homogenize through media and the culture of capitalism. Sheltered communities that were once saturated with culture are forced to join modern American culture. Keeping the polka alive allows these communities to establish a tangible aspect of their culture that can be maintained amidst the changes American society faces.

Dr. Gunkel also asserts that the polka serves to resist not only American mass culture in general but also the loss of religion that exists in our society.&lt;ref name="Gunkel"/&gt; The ethnic cultures associated with polka music are also associated with the Catholic Church. Lyrics used with polka music often reflect this association—many contain references to God, the virgin Mary, and religion in general.&lt;ref name="Gunkel"/&gt; The union of polka music with a religious experience in the polka mass is another example of the way polka music allows its participants to maintain their religion in a society that continues to disregard it. The effort to protect the polka is not merely an effort to perpetuate something that brings many people joy but is also an effort to preserve a threatened culture.

Charles Keil describes the paradox that "polka is a modern urban style that enables traditional cultures to persist".&lt;ref name="Gunkel"/&gt; Polka enthusiasts have to mediate between the desire to preserve their culture and the desire to keep the polka alive through future generations. This involves establishing a balance between traditionalism and modernism. An example of this conflict is the language polka music is performed in. Performers have to face the decision of performing and recording in Polish to appease those who prefer a more traditional approach and performing and recording in English to attract a wider, younger audience. English has become more and more popular, but many performers still learn several pieces with Polish lyrics.&lt;ref name="Jackson"/&gt; Another example of performer response to this conflict is the practice of performing and recording covers of popular non-polka music along with traditional polka music. The problem of attracting a broader audience while still preserving cultural heritage is an ongoing challenge in the polka world. The demographic for polka music in the USA currently consists primarily of married males between the ages of 60-85 with a median age of 74.

== The future of polka music and dance==

Though many would agree with expert Richard March that the efforts of polka artists to reach a broader audience are "doomed," the polka still has a strong base of enthusiastic supporters.&lt;ref name="March"/&gt;

The future employment of polka artists is closely related to the future popularity of the polka dance.

Potential limits to the popularity of the polka dance come from the relationship between footwear and the dance floor. The polka depends of a smooth dance surface, the most preferred dance venues once had sprung hardwood floors with a smooth finish. The most preferred footwear had leather soles, so dances could turn easily, and a rubber heel, so they could stop.
Those floors are getting rare. Modern flooring can supply the smoothness. And modern footwear can ease the impact, just as the old floors did.

Most styles of polka depend on low friction soles. Modern plastic soled footwear provides far greater traction that the leather soles common before the 1960s. A higher traction sole, during a turning polka, twists and stresses ankles, knees and hips more. Dancing more than a few polkas in running shoes can cause pain wherever legs are weakest, the knees of this typist. A common solution, for the enthusiast, is buying a pair of leather soled dancing shoes. But expecting beginners to spend about $100 for dance shoes, just to see if they like to polka or waltz, is an unreasonable strategy to hang the future of the polka on. And many dance shoes lack the cushion that the sprung floor used to provide.

A very short term solution is to cover the soles, '''not''' the heels, of running shoes with knee high nylon stockings. It looks weird, but one pair of nylons can last through 5 or 6 dances or lessons. The nylon reduces the sole's friction with the floor while the running shoe cushions impact so smooth concrete becomes an acceptable dance surface. Leaving the shoe's heel exposed lets the dancer stop the turns in the same way the older footwear did. Recycling knee highs with runs for this use is perfect.

"'''Queen of the Nile'''" is episode 143 of the [[American television]] anthology series ''[[The Twilight Zone]]''. In this episode, a journalist becomes romantically involved with a dangerous, secretly centuries-old movie star.

==Opening narration==
{{cquote|Jordan Herrick, syndicated [[columnist]], whose work appears in more than a hundred newspapers. By nature a cynic, a disbeliever, caught for the moment by a lovely vision. He knows the vision he's seen is no dream; she is Pamela Morris, renowned movie star, whose name is a household word and whose face is known to millions. What Mr. Herrick does not know is that he has also just looked into the face—of the Twilight Zone.}}

==Plot==
[[Columnist]] Jordan Herrick visits actress Pamela Morris, a woman known for her beauty and vitality, for an interview. In Pamela's manor he notices a painting of her that is dated 1940. Pamela still looks just as she did in the painting. When questioned on this, she says the painter drew her when she was a child with a projection of what she would look like as an adult, and deflects questions about her age. Pamela and Jordan flirt during the interview and make dinner plans for that night. As Jordan is leaving, an old woman who Pamela introduced as her mother, Mrs. Draper, warns him to never come back. Mrs. Draper says Pamela is many centuries old and that she is actually Pamela's daughter.

During his date with Pamela, Jordan mentions what Mrs. Draper had said. Pamela claims Mrs. Draper is mentally ill, but after the date, Herrick calls his editor and asks him to research Pamela's first film, ''The Queen of the Nile''. The editor reveals that the film was a [[remake]] of a silent movie filmed on location in Egypt. Leading lady Constance Taylor was apparently killed in a cave-in near the end of the shooting. The editor compares photos of Constance and Pamela in the same role and says they look alike. Jordan asks the editor to dig up articles on every man Pamela has ever been involved with.

Jordan returns to the manor and confronts Pamela with his discovery. Pamela drugs Jordan's coffee and then places a [[Scarabaeus sacer|scarab beetle]] on his unconscious body. The beetle drains his life until he has turned to dust. She then applies the scarab to her own chest.

The episode ends with another young and handsome columnist arriving to interview Pamela, starting the cycle once again. In the closing narration, it is hinted that Miss Morris is actually [[Cleopatra|Cleopatra VII]], and that she has lived for more than 2,000 years.

==Closing narration==
{{cquote|Everyone knows Pamela Morris, the beautiful and eternally young movie star. Or does she have another name, even more famous, an Egyptian name from centuries past? It's best not to be too curious, lest you wind up like Jordan Herrick, a pile of dust and old clothing discarded in the endless eternity of the Twilight Zone.}}

==Production notes==
{{Original research|section|date=May 2017}}Apparently, in the original first-draft script, a handsome young policeman turns up at the end of the story, asking Pamela Morris as to the whereabouts of the now missing Jordan Herrick. She begins to flatter and flirt with the cop, setting him up to start the cycle all over again.

The '''Sawlumin inscription''' ({{lang-my|စောလူးမင်း ကျောက်စာ}} {{IPA-my|sɔ́lúmɪ́ɴ tɕaʊʔ sà|}}) is one of the oldest surviving stone inscriptions in [[Myanmar]]. The slabs were mainly inscribed in [[Burmese script|Burmese]], [[Pyu script|Pyu]], [[Mon script|Mon]] and [[Pali language|Pali]], and a few lines in [[Sanskrit]]. According to an early analysis, the stele was founded in 1079 by King [[Saw Lu]] of [[Pagan Kingdom|Pagan (Bagan)]].

==Discovery==
Three broken slabs of the inscription were discovered in [[Myittha Township]], [[Mandalay Region]] on 17 November 2013 and a fourth piece was found on 27 November 2013. A fifth piece is still missing. The found four pieces were rejoined and currently stands in Petaw monastery. The slab size is {{convert|1.75|m|ft}} in height, and {{convert|1.06|m|ft}} in breadth.&lt;ref name="elevenmyanmar1"/&gt;&lt;ref name=nbhm-2&gt;Bee Htaw Monzel 2014: 2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Initial analyses==
The initial readings of the slabs threatened to upend the current understanding of Pagan-era dates. The initial reports claimed that the inscription was founded by King [[Saw Lu]], and contained the year 415 [[Burmese calendar|ME]] (1053/54 CE), presumably as its inscription date.&lt;ref name="elevenmyanmar1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elevenmyanmar.com/xmlnews/content/ancient-stone-inscription-found-myittha |title=Ancient stone inscription found in Myittha &amp;#124; Eleven News |publisher=Elevenmyanmar.com |date=2013-12-14 |accessdate=2014-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=irr-1&gt;{{cite web|author=Zarni Mann | url=http://www.irrawaddy.org/burma/discovery-fill-historical-record-little-known-burmese-king.html | title=Discovery Could Fill Out Historical Record on Little-Known Burmese King | publisher=Irrawaddy.org | date=2014-01-15 | accessdate=2014-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the initial reports conjectured that the fifth script might be [[Northern Thai language|Tai-Yuan]],&lt;ref name="elevenmyanmar1"/&gt; Gon (Khun or Kengtung) Shan,&lt;ref name=irr-1/&gt; over two centuries earlier than the earliest known evidence of a Tai-Shan script.

However, at least one subsequent analysis does not agree with some of the initial readings. According to Bee Htaw Monzel, the slabs were indeed founded by Saw Lu and mainly inscribed in Burmese, Pyu, Mon and Pali, and a few lines of Sanskrit.&lt;ref name=nbhm-20&gt;Bee Htaw Monzel 2014: 20&lt;/ref&gt; His analysis finds that the Mon and Pyu versions state 441 as the year of inscription, and that the Pyu version also gives the 10th month and the 3rd day.&lt;ref name=nbhm-18&gt;Bee Htaw Monzel 2014: 18&lt;/ref&gt;

Bee Htaw Monzel's translation of the extant inscriptions can be summarized as:&lt;ref name=nbhm-20-21&gt;Bee Htaw Monzel 2014: 20–21&lt;/ref&gt;
* King Saw Lu reconstructed the recently ravaged pagoda in Myittha, which was originally built by his grandfather;
* The king dedicated the reconstructed pagoda on Wednesday, full moon of Pyatho 441 ME (unexplained translation of year 441, 10th month, 3rd day);&lt;ref group=note&gt;It is unclear how Bee Htaw Monzel (Bee Htaw Monzel 2014: 21) came up with Wednesday, full moon of Pyatho 441 ME from his own reading of year 441, 10th month, 3rd day. His analysis does not explain where he got the full moon day or how the 3rd day could be translated as Wednesday. At any rate, the full moon of Pyatho 441 ME would have been ''Monday'', 9 December 1079. If the 3rd day were read as the 3rd day of the month, the date would be the 3rd waxing of Pyatho 441 ME (Wednesday, 27 November 1079).&lt;/ref&gt;
* The king donated a statue of the Buddha in the size of the king's own body along with 10 persons, oxen and paddy fields to care for the pagoda

==Significance==
Whether the inscription was inscribed in 1079 CE (or 1052 as initially reported), the inscription, if the readings are confirmed, appears to be the earliest evidence of the Burma Mon script. (The currently accepted date of the earliest Burma Mon is 1093 CE.&lt;ref name=mat-2005-167-178-197-200/&gt;)

Furthermore, the initial reading of 415 [[Burmese calendar|ME]] (25 March 1053 to 25 March 1054 CE) as the date of the inscription's foundation would have upended the current understanding of the early Pagan period.

* If 1053/54 proves to be the inscription date, it would be:
:#One of the earliest extant inscriptions of the [[Burmese script]]. Its inscription date would be 60 years earlier than the [[Myazedi inscription]] ({{circa}} 1112/1113), one of the oldest known stone inscriptions in [[Burma]] (Myanmar).&lt;ref name="elevenmyanmar1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mmtimes.com/index.php/national-news/9128-mysterious-language-stumps-researchers.html |title=Mysterious language stumps researchers |publisher=Mmtimes.com |date=2013-12-22 |accessdate=2014-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The earliest known inscription of Burmese—the copper-gilt umbrella inscription of the [[Mahabodhi Temple]] in India—is dated to 1035 CE. According to a recast stone inscription from the late 18th century, the Burmese script was already in use by 984 CE.&lt;ref name=mat-2005-167-178-197-200&gt;Aung-Thwin 2005: 167–178, 197–200&lt;/ref&gt;)
:#The earliest instance of the ''Burma Mon'' script. The earliest evidence of the predecessor script to the modern [[Mon script]] is dated to 1093 CE.&lt;ref name=mat-2005-167-178-197-200/&gt; (The Mon script of [[Dvaravati]] or [[Hariphunchai|Haripunjaya]] (both in present-day Thailand) is presumably earlier than the 11th century but so far there is no evidence to prove any linkage between the two Mon scripts.&lt;ref name=mat-2005-167-178-197-200/&gt;)

* If 1053/54 proves to be the inscription date, and if it was inscribed during Saw Lu's reign as king, it would mean that:
:# King Saw Lu was already reigning in 1053/1054 as opposed to the currently accepted reign date of 1077/78–1084.
:# The Myazedi inscription and most of the [[Burmese chronicles]] are incorrect about the chronology of early Pagan kings. Only the ''[[Maha Yazawin]]'' chronicle, which says Saw Lu reigned between 1035 and 1061, would be correct with respect to Saw Lu's reign. Currently, mainstream scholarship accepts ''[[Zatadawbon Yazawin]]'s'' dates, which agree with Myazedi's dates, as the most authoritative chronicle for the early Pagan period chronology.&lt;ref group=note&gt;(Maha Yazawin 2006: 346–349): Among the four major chronicles, only ''Zatadawbon Yazawin's'' dates line up with Anawrahta's inscriptionally verified accession date of 1044 CE. (Aung-Thwin 2005: 121–123): In general, ''Zata'' is considered "the most accurate of all Burmese chronicles, particularly with regard to the best-known Pagan and Ava kings, many of whose dates have been corroborated by epigraphy."&lt;/ref&gt;

* If the fifth script, currently speculated as the [[Northern Thai language|Tai-Yuan]],&lt;ref name="elevenmyanmar1"/&gt; Gon (Khun or Kengtung) Shan&lt;ref name=irr-1/&gt; or an early [[Nāgarī script]],&lt;ref name="decoding tablet"/&gt; is confirmed to be an early form of Tai-Shan script,
:#it would be the oldest, Tai/Shan script, predating the [[Thai script]], believed to be derived from Khmer in 1293, by over 240 years. Moreover, it would mean the Tai-Yuan or the Gon/Khun script existed 240 years prior to the founding of the [[Lan Na]] kingdom in 1292. Most of the Shan scripts came into existence in the late 16th century only.
:#the Tai/Shan speakers were sufficiently prominent in the early Pagan period that their script was used in a royal inscription. This contradicts the current understanding that Shan speakers moved in en masse to Kachin and Shan hills only in the mid-to-late 13th century.&lt;ref name=vbl-114-115&gt;Lieberman 2003: 114–115&lt;/ref&gt;
:#Burmese and northern Thai chronicles' claim that [[Anawrahta]]'s realm encompassed Kengtung and Chiang Mai regions could be reconsidered. (Both ''Chiang Mai'' and ''Chaing Saen'' chronicles say their rulers paid tribute to [[Anawrahta]], the father of Saw Lu.&lt;ref name=oiei-375-376&gt;Oriental 1900: 375–376&lt;/ref&gt; But the claims of the chronicles, which were written centuries after Anawrahta's time, are not accepted by mainstream scholarship.)

==Current status==
As of April 2014, about 60 percent of the tablets had been deciphered. They{{who|date=June 2015}} have deciphered all of the Mon and Pali text and about 10 percent of Pyu. A copy of text in the Nagari writing system used in northern India and Nepal has been sent to the Archaeological Survey of India for deciphering.&lt;ref name="decoding tablet"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.mmtimes.com/index.php/national-news/10163-set-in-stone-myanmar-asks-for-help-decoding-tablet.html | title=Set in stone: Myanmar asks for help decoding tablet | work=Mmtimes.com | agency=24 April 2014 | accessdate=17 May 2014 | author=Shwegu Thitsar}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Indian department replies that the inscription is not preserved in better condition. Some letters are peeled off and some are worn out. Only few letters in lines 6 and 7 are well preserved. The Indian department reveals that the inscription is engraved in early Nagari characters, retaining some of the features of Siddhamatrika or Kutila scripts.&lt;ref name="NBHM"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.facebook.com/download/1461668840773786/Myittha%2Breport%2Beng%2Bfinal.pdf | title=Myittha Slab Inscription of King Saw Lu | accessdate=4 September 2014 | author=Nai Bee Htaw Monzel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sexposition scene in Game of Thrones.png|thumb|right|The scene that caused a critic to coin the word "sexposition": In ''[[Game of Thrones]]'', [[Petyr Baelish]] ([[Aidan Gillen]]) explains his character's childhood and goals to two actresses who are simulating sexual activity.]]
In visual media such as television and film, '''sexposition''' is the technique of providing [[exposition (literary technique)|exposition]] against a backdrop of sex or nudity.&lt;ref name="Guardian 11 March 2012"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hann|first=Michael|title=How 'sexposition' fleshes out the story|url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2012/mar/11/sexposition-story-tv-drama?newsfeed=true|accessdate=March 29, 2012|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=March 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Financial Times]]'' defined sexposition as "keeping viewers hooked by combining complex plot exposition with explicit sexual goings-on".&lt;ref name=ft_lunch /&gt; Its purpose, according to [[James Poniewozik]], is to divert the audience and give characters something to do while exposition is being delivered, which is what distinguishes sexposition from merely gratuitous titillation.&lt;ref name="Guardian 11 March 2012" /&gt;

==Etymology==
The term was coined in 2011 by the blogger and critic Myles McNutt&lt;ref&gt;Originally in: {{cite web|last=McNutt|first=Myles|title=Game of Thrones – "You Win or You Die"|url=http://cultural-learnings.com/2011/05/29/game-of-thrones-you-win-or-you-die/ |work=cultural-learnings.com |date=May 29, 2011|accessdate=March 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; to describe scenes in the [[HBO]] TV series ''[[Game of Thrones]]''&lt;ref name="Guardian 11 March 2012" /&gt; in which characters reveal crucial information related to plot and character development during intimate scenes. Author [[George R. R. Martin]] said this technique is in line with the purpose of sexuality in the ''[[A Song of Ice and Fire]]'' books, and acknowledged that this technique allows for the exposition of motivations and incentives not available to the TV show.&lt;ref name=ft_lunch&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/bd1e2638-a8b7-11e1-a747-00144feabdc0.html#axzz1wYzURCl0 | title=Lunch with the FT: George RR Martin | work=Financial Times | date=June 2, 2012 | accessdate=June 4, 2012 | author=Berwick, Isabel }}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "sexposition" has since been retroactively applied to similar practices in many earlier works, including the older HBO shows ''[[Deadwood (TV series)|Deadwood]]'' and ''[[The Sopranos]]'' (frequently set in a strip club), many older cop films (likewise) and even the 1930s comic strip ''[[Jane (comic strip)|Jane]]''. According to critic Poniewozik, the novelty of the practice is not the nudity, but the manner in which it accompanies exposition, for which older TV shows with less complex plots did not have as much need.&lt;ref name="Guardian 11 March 2012"/&gt;

==Criticism==
Critics have  disapproved of sexposition because, in their view, it uses inappropriate tactics, insults the audience's intelligence by appealing and succumbing to carnality and covers up the screenwriter's failure to build cohesive narratives, having to rely on long drawn out sequences of exposition made watchable only through appeals to sexuality.&lt;ref name="Guardian 11 March 2012" /&gt; Some criticize sexposition for catering almost exclusively to heterosexual men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2014/06/16/game_of_thrones_fails_the_female_gaze_why_does_prestige_tv_refuse_to_cater_erotically_to_women |title="Game of Thrones" fails the female gaze: Why does prestige TV refuse to cater erotically to women? |publisher=Salon |accessdate=January 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neil Marshall]], director of the second-season episode "[[Blackwater (Game of Thrones)|Blackwater]]", recalled that he was repeatedly urged to add more full-frontal nudity during filming. The producer told him, according to the director, that "[e]veryone else in the series is drama side. I represent the pervy side of the audience", an experience that Marshall described as "pretty surreal" to happen on the set of a major network production.&lt;ref name="plumb20120601"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.empireonline.com/news/story.asp?NID=34164 | title=Neil Marshall Game Of Thrones Podcast | work=Empire | date=June 1, 2012 | accessdate=June 1, 2012 | author=Marshall, Neil}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Game of Thrones'' showrunner David Benioff admitted that he does "pay less attention to intricate plot points delivered during sex scenes", while co-creator [[D. B. Weiss]] disagreed, countering that "Sex grabs people's attention. But once it has their attention, it tends not to let go of it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://www.motherjones.com/media/2013/03/hbo-game-thrones-season-3-interview-david-benioff-dan-weiss | title="Game of Thrones" Creators on Shark, Sexposition, and Season 3 | work=Mother Jones | issue=March/April 2013 |date=March 5, 2013 | accessdate=March 7, 2013 | author=Mechanic, Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the effect is reportedly different for different directors, they say "Every one of those sex scenes is there because we wanted that particular scene in the show. There is not a sex scene quota from HBO."&lt;ref name="egner20130329"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/03/29/your-game-of-thrones-questions-answered/ | title=Your ‘Game of Thrones’ Questions, Answered | work=The New York Times | date=2013-03-29 | accessdate=March 29, 2013 | author=Egner, Jeremy}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' reported before the seventh season in 2017 that "Even if Benioff and Weiss don’t always admit it, the show has changed. Scenes in which exposition is delivered in one brothel or another, for example, have been pared back".&lt;ref name="daddario2017"&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=D'Addadio |first=Daniel |date=2017-07-10 |title='Game of Thrones': Inside the World's Most Popular Show |url=http://time.com/game-of-thrones-2017/ |magazine=Time |access-date=2017-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Satire==
Fan site Winter is Coming cited an April 2012 skit on ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' when discussing Marshall's anecdote.&lt;ref name="wic20120601"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://winteriscoming.net/2012/06/blackwater-director-neil-marshall-on-nudity-and-creating-the-battle/ | title="Blackwater" director Neil Marshall on nudity and creating the battle | work=Winter is Coming | date=June 1, 2012 | accessdate=June 1, 2012 | author=Ours is the Fury}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aired more than a month before the Marshall interview was published, the skit purported to be an episode of ''[[HBO First Look]]'' featuring Adam Friedberg, 13 year-old "creative consultant" to ''Game of Thrones''. Played by [[Andy Samberg]], the teenage boy was proud of "mak[ing] sure there are lots of boobs" and various sexual acts during expository scenes. Author Martin ([[Bobby Moynihan]]) called Friedberg "a visionary. He knows that even when I didn't write sex into a scene, I was definitely thinking about it."&lt;ref name="snl20120414"&gt;{{cite episode | title=HBO First Look: Game of Thrones | series=Saturday Night Live | url=http://gawker.com/5902076/snl-explains-the-nudity-in-game-of-thrones | credits=Samberg, Andy; Moynihan, Bobby; Killam, Taran | network=NBC | airdate=April 14, 2012 | number=721  | season=37}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sims20120415"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.avclub.com/articles/josh-brolingotye,71972/ | title=Josh Brolin/Gotye, S37/E19 | work=A.V.

The '''Sinulog-Santo Niño Festival''' is an annual cultural and religious festival held on the third Sunday of January in [[Cebu City]], and is the centre of the [[Santo Niño de Cebú|Santo Niño]] Catholic celebrations in the Philippines.

The festival is considered to be first of most popular festivals in the [[Philippines]], with every celebration of the festival routinely attracting around 1 to 2 million people from all over the Philippines every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Gavilan |first=Jodesz |title=FAST FACTS: Things to know about Sinulog |url=http://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/iq/119173-fast-facts-sinulog-festival |work=[[Rappler]] |date=January 16, 2016 |accessdate=March 10, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from the religious aspect of the festival, Sinulog is also famous for its [[block party|street parties]], usually happening the night before and the night of the main festival.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.everythingcebu.com/attractions/festivals/top-sinulog-parties/ Top Sinulog Parties!]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events and highlights==

==Etymology==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2011}}
The word ''Sinulog'' comes from the Cebuano adverb ''sulog'' which roughly means "like water current movement;" it describes the forward-backward movement of the Sinulog dance. The dance consists of two steps forward and one step backward, done to the sound of drums. The dance is categorized into Sinulog-base, Free-Interpretation, and street dancing. Candle vendors at the Basilica continue to perform the traditional version of the dance when lighting a candle for the customer, usually accompanied by songs in the native language.

Sinulog is the ritual prayer-dance honoring Señor Santo Niño or the [[Child Jesus]]. An image of the Child Jesus is said to be the baptismal gift the Portuguese conquistador Ferdinand Magellan gave Hara Amihan (Humanay) of Zebu (now Cebu) in April 1521. The image, believed to be miraculous, is housed at the Basilica Minore del Santo Niño in downtown Cebu City.

The Sinulog dance moves are basically two steps forward and one step backward as the dancer sways to a distinct rhythm of drums. This movement resembles the current (Sulog) of what was known as Cebu’s Pahina River.

According to historical accounts, the Cebu natives already danced the Sinulog in honor of their animist idols long before the arrival of Magellan who led a Spanish expedition on April 7, 1521. Magellan did not live long after he introduced Christianity. He died in a failed assault on nearby Mactan island at the hands of a local chieftain named Lapu-Lapu.

Survivors of Magellan's expedition left behind the image to be discovered 44 years later.

The expedition led by Miguel Lopez de Legazpi bombarded the native settlement when they arrived on April 28, 1565. In one of the burning huts, one of Legazpi's men, Juan Camus, discovered the image of the Santo Niño inside a wooden box beside other idols. This time however, Legazpi discovered that the natives already dance the Sinulog honoring the Santo Niño.&lt;ref&gt;http://cebu.sunstar.com.ph/sinulog/history/#sthash.ZfFOEFk0.dpuf&lt;/ref&gt;

Today the Sinulog commemorates the Filipino people's acceptance of Christianity (specifically, Roman Catholicism), and their rejection of their former animist beliefs. The first of these conversions happened in 1521 on the island of Cebu, when Rajah Humabon and his queen Amihan (Humamay) were baptized along with their subjects, becoming Carlos and Juana of Cebu.

==History==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2011}}

On March 16, 1521, the Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan arrived and planted the cross on the shores of Cebu, claiming the territory for Spain. He presented the image of the Child Jesus to the Rajah, Humabon. Hara Humamay (or Amihan in some versions) was later named, Queen Juana in honor of Juana, mother of Carlos I. Along with the rulers of the island, some 800 natives were also baptized to the Roman Catholic Church. At the moment of receiving the holy image, it was said that Queen Juana danced with joy bearing this image of the child Jesus. With the other natives following her example, this moment was regarded as the first Sinulog.

This event is frequently used as basis for most Sinulog dances, which dramatize the coming of the Spaniards and the presentation of the Santo Niño to the Queen. A popular theme among Sinulog dances is Queen Juana holding the Santo Niño in her arms and using it to bless her people who were often afflicted with sickness believed to be caused by demons and other evil spirits.

The Sinulog dance steps are believed to originate from Rajah Humabon's adviser, Baladhay. It was during Humabon's grief when Baladhay fell sick. Humabon ordered his native tribe to bring Baladhay into a room where the Santo Niño was enthroned, along with the other pagan gods of the native Cebuanos. After a few days passed, Baladhay was heard shouting and was found dancing with utmost alertness. Baladhay was questioned as to why was he was awake and shouting. Pointing to the image of the Santo Niño, Baladhay explained that he had found on top of him a small child trying to wake him and tickling him with the midrib of the coconut. Greatly astonished, he scared the child away by shouting. The little child got up and started making fun of Baladhay. In turn, Baladhay danced with the little child and explained that he was dancing the ''movements of the river.'' To this day, the two-steps forward, one-step backward movement is still used by Santo Niño devotees who believe that it was the Santo Niño's choice to have Baladhay dance.

===Arrival of López de Legazpi===
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2011}}
The [[Augustinian]] friars that accompanied López de Legazpi in his expedition proclaimed the statue performed miracles and built a church on the site where it was found. The church was called San Agustin Church, later renamed to [[Basilica Minore del Santo Niño]].

===Letter to the King of Spain===
After Juan Camus found the Santo Niño in the burning village, López de Legazpi was said to have included the incident in his report, entitled "Relation of Voyage to the Philippine Islands":

:''"Your Excellency should know that on that day when we entered this village ([[Cebu City]]), one of the soldiers went into a large and well-built house of an indio where he found an image of the Child Jesus (whose most holy name I pray may be universally worshipped). This was kept in its cradle, all gilded, just as if it were brought from Spain: and only the little cross, which is generally placed upon the globe in his hands, was lacking. The image was well kept in that house, and many flowers were found before it, and no one knows for what object or purpose. The soldier bowed down before it with all reverence and wonder, and brought the image to the place where the other soldiers were. I pray to the Holy Name of his image, which we found here, to help us and to grant us victory, in order that these lost people who are ignorant of the precious and rich treasure, which was in their possession, may come to knowledge to him.''"

==Today==
Since the 16th century, there is great devotion to the Santo Niño in Philippine popular piety, particularly in the Visayas. Pilgrims from different parts of Cebu and the rest of the Philippines make their yearly journey to the church to take part in the procession and festival. Starting in 1980, the Cebu City government organized the Sinulog Festival and eventually gave incentives also to tribal dance groups. The first Sinulog parade was held in 1980, organized by Dávid Odilao, then Regional Director of the Ministry of Sports, and Youth Development. The parade was composed of students dressed in Knitted Filipiniana costumes, dancing the Sinulog to the beating of drums.

The idea caught and thus, under the direction of the Cebu City Mayor Florentino Solon with the help of several influential Cebuanos, Odilao turned over the Sinulog project to the Cebu City Historical Committee under Kagawad Jesus Garcia. It was the task of the Committee to conceptualize the Sinulog festival and make it into a yearly event from then on.

In 1981 the following year, the concept of the Sinulog Parade was actualized involving not just Cebu but also representatives from other provinces in the Philippines . Marking its difference from another popular festival, the [[Ati-Atihan]] in Aklan, the Sinulog focuses not on the ritual itself but on the historical aspects of the dance, which, as it has been said, represents the link the country's embrace of Christian faith.

2010-2014 Peace and Order during Sinulog celebration was an issue for years. Gangs and fraternity wars were rampant during night times. The organization of AITF under the leadership of PCI Franz Georsua became the key to a peaceful and more meaningful celebration after controlling most of the street crimes during the said event.

==Sinulog coat of arms==
[[File:Sinulog 2010 Harrywad15.JPG|thumbnail|The coat of arms as part of the Sinulog Foundation logo]]
The Cebu City Historical Committee, which was responsible for the conceptualization of the Sinulog as a provincial event, decided to adopt a logo for the Sinulog to identify it as an institutionalized yearly event. They turned to the coat of arms of the Santo Niño which consisted of a two-headed hawk that was the mark of the ruling [[House of Habsburg]] in Europe. The emblem represented the twin purpose of the Habsburg dynasty as "Champion of Catholicism and Defender of the Faith." At the time when Spain sent expeditions to the Philippines, they were under the Habsburg dynasty. The committee viewed that using the image of the Santo Niño as part of the symbol as [[sacrilege]].&lt;ref name="coa"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Herrera|first1=Christine|title=‘Bypassed’ Cebu to hold grand Sinulog|url=http://manilastandardtoday.com/news/-main-stories/top-stories/167030/-bypassed-cebu-to-hold-grand-sinulog.html|accessdate=20 March 2016|publisher=The Standard|date=31 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sinulog committee then incorporated the two-headed eagle to a native warrior's shield. The native shield is supposed to symbolize the Philippines resistance to colonization while the Santo Niño's coat of arms printed on its face represented the country's acceptance of Roman Catholicism.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

'''''The Fire Thief''''' was written by [[Terry Deary]] and is the first book in The Fire Thief Trilogy. The book is about [[Prometheus]], the Greek [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] who, in Greek mythology, is said to have stolen fire from the gods and given it to humans.

The story tells of [[Prometheus]] when he is chained to a rock and about to have his liver ripped out by the [[Furies|Fury]], but instead he is freed by the hero Hercules. He grabs the Fury, breaks its neck and runs away after he has been freed from the mountain he was chained to, by his cousin [[Zeus]], the Greek god of lightning and ruler of the sky. Zeus sends him on a quest to find a true human hero. He gives Prometheus a ring because he promised that Prometheus will always be chained to that rock. This means that Zeus can always find him as well. Prometheus travels into the future with a pair of magical wings. He lands in Eden City and is helped by Uncle Edward and young Jim, a pair of robbers. The Fury is bent on revenge and Theus must complete this task while avoiding the Fury, who is supposed to eat his liver everyday for eternity. There, Jim and Uncle Edward stay at Storm Inn where they meet January Storm. They came to Eden City to steal riches from the Mucklethrift Manor. They usually put a play on and while they are doing it, Jim goes and steals the riches. When Prometheus came, he was strong so he could help the robbers carry the coffin which they put the stolen goods in. They are successful but Mayor Walter Tweed catches them and demands to get 1/3 of the stolen riches. The Mayor makes a fake deal with the Uncle Edward pretending that the police would not catch the robbers, Uncle Edward and Jim.

The other two books in the series are ''[[Flight of the Fire Thief (novel)|Flight of the Fire Thief]]'' (2006) and ''The Fire Thief Fights Back'' (2007).

==Poems and rhymes in The Fire Thief==
A famous rhyme in the Fire Thief book is chanted by imaginary mythological character in the book:

''"The boy stood on the burning deck, picking his nose like crazy. He rolled them into little balls, and flicked them 'till he felt hazy!"''

The rhyme is used by the creatures as a joke to taunt Jim.

The '''''Metamorphoses''''' of [[Apuleius]], which [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]] referred to as '''''The Golden Ass''''' (''Asinus aureus''),&lt;ref&gt;St. Augustine, ''The City of God'' 18.18.2''''&lt;/ref&gt; is the only [[ancient Roman]] [[novel]] in [[Latin]] to survive in its entirety.&lt;ref name="Evans2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=James Evans|title=Arts and Humanities Through the Eras|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d2pYAAAAYAAJ|year=2005|publisher=Thomson/Gale|isbn=978-0-7876-5699-7|page=78|quote=The "Golden Ass," the only Latin novel to survive in its entirety}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The protagonist of the novel is called Lucius.&lt;ref&gt;''The Golden Ass'' 1.24&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the novel, he is revealed to be from [[Madauros|Madaurus]],&lt;ref&gt;''The  Golden Ass'' 11.27&lt;/ref&gt; the hometown of Apuleius himself. The plot revolves around the protagonist's curiosity (''curiositas'') and insatiable desire to see and practice magic. While trying to perform a spell to transform into a [[bird]], he is accidentally transformed into an [[donkey|ass]]. This leads to a long journey, literal and metaphorical, filled with [[The Golden Ass#Inset stories|inset tales]]. He finally finds [[salvation]] through the intervention of the goddess [[Isis]], whose cult he joins.

==Origin==
[[File:Apuleius Metamorphoses c. 65.jpg|thumb|Lucius takes human form, in a 1345 illustration of the ''Metamorphoses'' (ms. Vat. Lat. 2194, [[Biblioteca Apostolica Vaticana]]).]]
The date of composition of the ''Metamorphoses'' is uncertain. It has variously been considered by scholars as a youthful work preceding Apuleius' ''Apology'' of 158/9 AD, or as the climax of his literary career and perhaps as late as the 170s or 180s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=S. J. Harrison |title=Apuleius: A Latin Sophist |origyear=2000 |edition=revised paperback |year=2004 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=0-19-927138-0 |pages=9–10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Apuleius adapted the story from a [[Greek language|Greek]] original of which the author's name is said to be Lucius of [[Patrae]] (the name of the lead character and narrator). This Greek text has been lost, but there is Λούκιος ἢ ὄνος (''Loúkios è ónos'', ''Loukios/Lucius'' or ''The Ass''), a similar tale of disputed authorship, traditionally attributed to [[Lucian of Samosata]], a contemporary of Apuleius. This surviving Greek text appears to be an abridgement or epitome of "Lucius of Patrae's" text. Possibly the original lost story was written by Lucian and the abridged version was later transmitted under his name.

==Plot==
'''Book One'''

The prologue establishes an audience and a speaker, who defines himself by location, education, and occupation.  The narrator journeys to Thessaly on business.  On the way, he runs into Aristomenes and an unnamed traveler.  The unnamed traveler refuses to believe Aristomenes' story. The narrator scolds the unnamed traveler and tells a short story about a sword swallower.  He promises Aristomenes a free lunch if he will retell [[The Golden Ass#Aristomenes' Tale|his tale]]. The narrator believes Aristomenes' tale and becomes more eager to learn about magic.  The narrator arrives at Hypata, where he stays with Milo, a family friend and miser, and his wife Pamphile.  Photis, Milo's servant, takes the narrator to the baths, after which the narrator goes to the marketplace.  There, he buys some fish and runs into his old friend Pytheas, who is now a [[magistrate]]. Pytheas reveals the narrator's name as Lucius.  Pytheas says that Lucius overpaid for the fish and humiliates the fish-monger by trampling on the fish. Lucius returns to Milo's house, hungry and empty-handed.  Milo asks Lucius about his life, his friends, and his wanderings.  Lucius goes to sleep hungry.

'''Book Two'''

The next morning, Lucius meets his aunt Byrrhena in the town, and she warns him that Milo's wife is an evil witch who will kill Lucius. Lucius, however, is interested in becoming a witch himself. He then returns to Milo's house, where he repeatedly makes love to the slave-girl Fotis (also spelled Photis&lt;ref&gt;Apuleius, Lucius; Walsh, P.G. (Trans) (1994). ''The Golden Ass''. New York: Oxford UP. {{ISBN|978-0-19-283888-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The next day, Lucius goes to his aunt's home for dinner, and there meets Thelyphron, who relates [[The Golden Ass#Thelyphron's Tale|his tale]] of how witches cut off his nose and ears. After the meal, Lucius drunkenly returns to Milo's house in the dark, where he encounters three robbers, whom he soon slays before retiring to bed.

'''Book Three'''

[[File:Lucius Spots the Transformation.jpeg|200px|thumb|right| Lucius spies Milo's wife transforming into a bird. Illustration by [[Jean de Bosschère]]]]

The next morning, Lucius is abruptly awoken and arrested for the murder of the three men. He is taken to court where he is laughed at constantly and witnesses are brought against him. They are just about to announce his guilt when the widow demands to bring out the dead bodies; but when the three bodies of the murdered men are revealed, they turn out to be puffed-up wineskins. It then turns out that it was a prank played by the town upon Lucius, to celebrate their annual Festival of Laughter.  Later that day, Lucius and Photis watch Milo's wife perform her witchcraft and transform herself into a bird. Attempting to copy her, Lucius accidentally turns himself into an [[Donkey|ass]], at which point Photis tells him that the only way for him to return to his human state is to eat a rose. She puts him in the stable for the night and promises to bring him roses in the morning, but during the night Milo's house is raided by a band of thieves, who steal Lucius the ass, load him up with their plunder, and leave with him.

'''Book Four'''

On a break in his journey with the bandits, Lucius the ass trots over to a garden to munch on what seem to be roses (but are actually poisonous rose-laurels) when he is beaten by the gardener and chased by dogs. The thieves reclaim him and he is forced to go along with them; they talk about how their leader Thrasileon has been killed while dressed as a bear. The thieves then kidnap a young woman, Charite, who is housed in a cave with Lucius the ass. Charite starts crying, so an elderly woman who is in league with the thieves begins to tell her the story of [[Cupid and Psyche]].

Psyche is the most beautiful woman on earth, and Venus jealously arranges for Psyche's destruction, ordering her son Cupid to arrange for her to fall in love with a worthless wretch. An oracle tells Psyche's parents to expose her on a mountain peak, where she will become the bride of a powerful, monstrous being. Psyche is left on the mountain, and carried away by a gentle wind.

'''Book Five'''

The elderly woman continues telling the story of Cupid and Psyche. Cupid, Venus's son, secretly preserves Psyche; Cupid becomes Psyche's mysterious husband, who is invisible to her by day and only visits her at night. Psyche's jealous sisters arouse her curiosity and fear about her husband's identity; Psyche, against Cupid's commands, looks at him by lamplight at night; Cupid abandons Psyche, who wanders in search of him, and takes revenge on her wicked sisters.

'''Book Six'''

The elderly woman finishes telling the story of Cupid and Psyche, as Psyche is forced to perform various tasks for Venus (including an errand to the underworld) with the help of Cupid and an assortment of friendly creatures, and is finally reunited with her husband. Lucius the ass and Charite escape from the cave but they are caught by the thieves, and sentenced to death.

[[File:Charite kisses.jpeg|200px|thumb|left| Charitë embraces Tlepolemus while Lucius looks on. From an illustration by Jean de Bosschère]]
'''Book Seven'''

A man appears to the thieves and announces that he is the renowned thief Haemus the [[Thracians|Thracian]], who suggests that they should not kill the captives but sell them. Haemus later reveals himself secretly to Charite as her fiancé Tlepolemus, and gets all of the thieves drunk. When they are asleep he slays them all. Tlepolemus, Charite and Lucius the ass safely escape back to the town. Once there, the ass is entrusted to a horrid boy who torments him but the boy is later killed by a she-bear. Enraged, the boy's mother plans to kill the ass.

'''Book Eight'''

A man arrives at the mother's house and announces that Tlepolemus and Charite are dead, caused by the scheming of the evil Thrasillus who wants Charite to marry him. After hearing the news of their master's death, the slaves run away, taking the ass Lucius with them. The large group of travelling slaves is mistaken for a band of robbers and attacked by farmhands of a rich estate. Several other misfortunes befall the travelers until they reach a village. Lucius as the narrator often digresses from the plot in order to recount several scandal-filled stories that he learns of during his journey. Lucius is eventually sold to a [[catamite]] priest. He is entrusted with carrying the statue of a goddess on his back while he follows around the group of sinful priests. While engaging in lewd activity with a local boy, the group of priests is discovered by a man in search of a stolen ass who mistakes Lucius' braying for that of his own animal. The priests flee to a new city where they are well received by one of its chief citizens. They are preparing to dine when his cook realizes that the meat that was to be served was stolen by a dog. The cook, at the suggestion of his wife, prepares to kill Lucius in order to serve his meat instead.

[[File:Lucius Encounters the Murderous Wife.jpg|200px|thumb|right| Lucius encounters the murderous wife. Illustration by Jean de Bosschère]]
'''Book Nine'''

Lucius' untimely escape from the cook coincides with an attack by rabid dogs, and his wild behavior is attributed to their viral bites. The men barricade him in a room until it is decided that he is no longer infected. The band of priests packs up and moves out. The narrative is interrupted by [[The Golden Ass#Tale of the Wife's Tub|The Tale of the Wife's Tub]]. After the arrest of the priests Lucius is sold into labor, driving a baker's mill-wheel. Lucius, though bemoaning his labor as an ass, also realizes that this state has allowed him to hear many novel things with his long ass-ears. [[The Golden Ass#The Tale of the Jealous Husband|The Tale of the Jealous Husband]] and [[The Golden Ass#The Tale of the Fuller's Wife|The Tale of the Fuller's Wife]] mark a break in the narrative. The theme of the two intervening stories is adultery, and the text appropriately follows with the adultery of the baker's wife and the subsequent murder of the baker. Lucius the ass is then auctioned off to a farmer. The Tale of the Oppressive Landlord is here told. The farmer duly assaults a legionary who makes advances on his ass (Lucius), but he is found out and jailed.

[[File:Lucius is returned to human form at the procession of Isis.jpg|200px|thumb|right| Lucius is returned to human form during the [[procession of Isis]]. From an Illustration by Jean de Bosschère]]

'''Book Ten'''

Lucius comes into the legionary's possession, and after lodging with a decurion Lucius recounts [[The Golden Ass#Tale of the Murderous Wife|Tale of the Murderous Wife]]. He is then sold to two brothers, a confectioner and a cook, who treated him kindly. When they go out Lucius secretly eats his fill of their food. At first a source of vexation, when the ass was discovered to be the one behind the disappearing food it was much laughed at and celebrated. Again he was sold, and he was taught many amusing tricks. Rumor spread, and great fame came to the ass and his master. As it happened, a woman was so enamored of the sideshow ass that she paid off his keeper and took him to bed with her. The Tale of the Jealous Wife is aired. The murderess depicted in this tale is precisely she whom Lucius is made to mate with at the Shows. After an enactment of the judgment of Paris and a brief but important digression, the time comes for Lucius to make his much awaited appearance. At the last moment he decides against this, fearing for his life, and he runs away to Cenchreae eventually to nap on the beach.

'''Book Eleven'''

Lucius wakes up in a panic during the first watch of the night.  Considering Fate to be done tormenting him, he takes the opportunity to purify himself by seven consecutive immersions in the sea.  He then offers a prayer to the Queen of Heaven, for his return to human form, citing all the various names the goddess is known by to people everywhere (Venus, Ceres, Paphos, Proserpine, etc.).  The Queen of Heaven appears in a vision to him and explains to him how he can be returned to human form by eating the crown of roses that will be held by one of her priests during a religious procession the following day. In return for his redemption, Lucius is expected to be initiated through the ''[[Navigium Isidis]]'' into Isis' priesthood (Isis being the Queen of Heaven's true name, according to her). Lucius follows her instructions and is returned to human form and, at length, initiated into her priesthood.  Lucius is then sent to his ancestral home, Rome, where he continues to worship Isis, under the local name, Campensis.  After a time, he is visited once more by the goddess who speaks again of mysteries and holy rites which Lucius comes to understand as a command to be initiated into the [[cult of Isis]]. He does so.  Shortly afterwards, he receives a third vision. Though he is confused, the god appears to him and reassures him that he is much blessed and that he is to become once more initiated that he might supplicate in Rome as well. The story concludes with the goddess, Isis, appearing to Lucius and declaring that Lucius shall rise to a prominent position in the legal profession and that he shall be appointed to the College of Pastophori that he might serve Osiris and Isis' mysteries.  Lucius is so happy that he goes about freely exposing his bald head.

==Inset stories==

Similar to other [[picaresque]] novels, ''The Golden Ass'' features several shorter stories told by characters encountered by the protagonist. Some act as independent short stories, while others interlock with the original novel's plot developments.

===Aristomenes' Tale===

At the beginning of Book One, Lucius encounters two men arguing on the road about the truth of one's story. Lucius is interested, and offers the teller a free lunch for his tale.

Aristomenes goes on business for cheese and he runs into his friend Socrates, who is disheveled and emaciated.  Aristomenes clothes Socrates and takes him to the bathhouse.  Aristomenes berates Socrates for leaving his family.  While they're eating lunch, Socrates tells about his affair with Meroë.  Socrates tells Aristomenes that Meroë is an ugly witch who turns her ex-lovers into rather unfortunate animals.  Aristomenes doesn't believe Socrates' tale but is nevertheless afraid.  Aristomenes barricades the door and they both go to bed. In the middle of the night, Meroë and Panthia break in, cut open Socrates, drain his blood, rip out his heart, and replace it with a sponge. Before leaving, they urinate on Aristomenes.  The witches spare Aristomenes because they want him to bury Socrates in the land. Aristomenes fears that he will be blamed for the death of his friend and attempts to hang himself, but is comically stopped when the rope is revealed to be too rotten to support his weight.  In the morning, Socrates wakes up and everything seems to be normal. They continue travelling and reach a stream, where Socrates bends to take a drink, which causes the sponge to fall out and him to die. Aristomenes buries Socrates in the ground, and then proceeds on his way.

===Thelyphron's Tale===

In Book Two, Thelyphron hesitantly relates a story requested at a dinner party that was previously popular with his friends:

While a University student, Thelyphron partakes in many wanderings and eventually runs out of funds. At Larissa, he encounters a large sum being offered to watch over a corpse for the night. When he asks, a citizen tells him that shape-shifting witches are quite common in the area, using pieces of human flesh to fuel incantations. Thelyphron takes the job for a thousand drachme and is warned to stay very alert all through the night. The widow is at first hesitant, taking inventory of the body's intact parts. Thelyphron requests a meal and some wine, to which she promptly refuses and leaves him with a lamp for the night. A&amp;nbsp;weasel enters the room and Thelyphron quickly chases it out, then falls into a deep sleep. At dawn, Thelyphron awakes and to his relief finds the body intact. The widow enters, and calls for Thelyphron to be paid, satisfied with the intact corpse. Thanking the widow, Thelyphron is suddenly attacked by the crowd and narrowly escapes. He witnesses an elder of the town approach the townspeople and claim that the widow had poisoned her husband to cover up a love affair. The widow protests, and a necromancer is called to bring back the deceased for the only truly reliable testimony. The corpse awakes, and affirms the widow's guilt. The corpse does thank Thelyphron for his trouble; during the night the witches entered as small animals, putting Thelyphron to sleep and stealing pieces of his ears and nose. The witches cleverly replace the missing flesh with wax to delay discovery. Thelyphron touches his nose and ears to find wax fall out of where they once were. The crowd laughs at Thelyphron's humiliation.

===Tale of Cupid and Psyche===
{{Main article|Cupid and Psyche}}

In Book Four, an elderly woman tells the story to comfort the bandits' captives. The story is continued through Books Five and Six.

Psyche, the most beautiful woman in the world is envied by her family as well as by Venus. An oracle of Venus demands she be sent to a mountaintop and wed to a murderous beast. Sent by Venus to destroy her, Cupid falls in love and flies her away to his castle. There she is directed to never seek to see the face of her husband, who visits and makes love to her in the dark of night. Eventually, Psyche wishes to see her sisters, who jealously demand she seek to discover the identity of her husband. That night, Psyche discovers her husband is Cupid while he is sleeping, but wakes and scars him with her candle. Infuriated, he flies to heaven and leaves her banished from her castle. In attempted atonement, Psyche seeks the temple of Venus and offers herself as a slave. Venus assigns Psyche four impossible tasks. First, she is commanded to sort through a great hill of mixed grains. In pity, many ants aid her in completing the task. Next, she is commanded to retrieve wool of the dangerous golden sheep. A&amp;nbsp;river god aids Psyche and tells her to gather clumps of wool from thorn bushes nearby. Venus next requests water from a cleft high beyond mortal reach. An eagle gathers the water for Psyche. Next, Psyche is demanded to seek some beauty from [[Proserpina]], Queen of the Underworld. Attempting to kill herself to reach the underworld, Psyche ascends a great tower and prepares to throw herself down. The tower speaks, and teaches Psyche the way of the underworld. Psyche retrieves the beauty in a box, and, hoping to gain the approval of her husband, opens the box to use a little. She is put into a coma. Cupid rescues her, and begs Jupiter that she may become immortal. Psyche is granted Ambrosia, and the two are forever united.

The story is the best-known of those in ''The Golden Ass'' and frequently appears in or is referred to directly in later literature.

===Tale of the Wife's Tub===

[[File:The Wife's Tub.jpg|200px|thumb|right|The Wife and her lover near the Tub. Illustration by Jean de Bosschère]]

In the course of a visit to an inn in Book Nine, a smith recounts an anecdote concerning his wife's deceit:

During the day, her husband absent at his labors, the smith's wife is engaged in an adulterous affair. One day, however, the smith, work finished well ahead of schedule, returns home prematurely&amp;nbsp;— obviously to his wife's great consternation. Panicked, the faithless woman hides her lover in an old tub. After absorbing his spouse's efforts at distraction, which take the form of bitter reproaches that his coming back so early betokens a laziness that can only worsen their poverty, the smith announces that he has sold the tub for six drachmae; to this his wife responds by saying that she has in fact already sold it for seven, and has sent the buyer into the tub to inspect it. Emerging, the lover complains that his supposed purchase is in need of a proper scrubbing if he is to close the deal, so the cuckolded smith gets a candle and flips the tub to clean it from underneath. The canny adulteress then lies atop of the tub and, her lover pleasuring her the while, instructs her hapless husband as to where he should apply his energies. To add insult to injury, the ill-used man eventually has to deliver the tub to the lover's house himself.

===The Tale of the Jealous Husband===

In Book Nine, a baker's wife of poor reputation is advised by a female 'confidant' to be wary of choosing her lover, suggesting she find one very strong of body and will. She relates the story of one of the wife's previous school friends:

Barbarus, an overbearing husband, is forced leave on a business trip, and commands his slave, Myrmex, to watch his wife, Aretë, closely to assure she is being faithful during his time away. Barbarus tells Myrmex that any failure will result in his death. Myrmex is so intimidated that he does not let Aretë out of his sight. Aretë's looks, however, charm Philesietaerus who vows to go to any lengths to gain her love. Philesietaerus bribes Myrmex with thirty gold pieces and the promise of his protection for allowing him a night with Aretë. Becoming obsessed with gold, Myrmex delivers the message to Aretë and Philesietaerus pays Myrmex a further ten pieces. While Aretë and Philesietaerus are making love, Barbarus returns but is locked out of the house. Philesietaerus leaves in a hurry, leaving behind his shoes. Barbarus does not notice the strange shoes until the morning, at which point he chains Myrmex's hands and drags him through town, screaming, while looking for the shoes' owner. Philesietaerus spots the two, runs up, and with great confidence shouts at Myrmex, accusing him of stealing his shoes. Barbarus allows Myrmex to live, but beats him for the 'theft'.

===The Tale of the Fuller's Wife===

In Book Nine the baker's wife attempts to hide her lover from her husband, and entertains to her husband's story of the Fuller:

While coming home with the Baker for supper, the Fuller interrupts his wife's love-making with a lover. She frantically attempts to hide her lover in a drying cage in the ceiling, hidden by hanging clothes soaked in sulphur. The lover begins to sneeze, and at first the Fuller excuses his wife. After a few sneezes, the Fuller gets up and turns over the cage to find the lover waiting. The Fuller is talked out of beating the young man to death by the Baker, who points out that the young man will shortly die from the sulphur fumes if left in the cage. The Fuller agrees and returns the lover to the cage.

The tale is used to contrast the earlier tale told to the Baker's wife of high suspicion and quick judgments of character by her 'auntie' with the overly naive descriptions of nefarious people by her husband.

===Tale of the Murderous Wife===

In Book Ten a woman condemned to public humiliation with Lucius tells him her crimes:

A man goes on a journey, leaving his pregnant wife and infant son. He commands his wife that if she bears a daughter, the child is to be killed. The child is indeed a daughter, and in pity, the mother convinces her poor neighbours to raise her. Her daughter grows up ignorant of her origin, and when she reaches a marriageable age, the mother tells her son to deliver her daughter's dowry. The son begins preparation to marry the girl off to a friend, and lets her into his home under the guise of her being an orphan to all but the two of them. His wife, however, is unaware the girl is his sister, and believes he keeps her as a mistress. His wife steals her husband's signet ring and visits their country home accompanied by a group of slaves. She sends a slave with the signet to fetch the girl and bring her to the country home. The girl, aware that the husband is her brother, responds immediately, and on arrival at the country home is flogged by the wife's slaves, and put to death by a torch placed 'between her thighs'. The girl's brother takes the news and falls gravely ill. Aware of suspicions around her, his wife asks a corrupt doctor for instant poison. Accompanied by the doctor, she brings the poison to her husband in bed. Finding him surrounded by friends, she first tricks the doctor into drinking from the cup to prove to her husband the drink is benign, and giving him the remainder. Unable to return home in time to seek an antidote, the doctor dies telling his wife what happened and to at least collect a payment for the poison. The doctor's widow asks for payment but first offers the wife the remainder of her husband's collection of poisons. Finding that her daughter is next of kin to her husband for inheritance, the wife prepares a poison for both the doctor's widow and her daughter. The doctor's widow recognizes early the symptoms of the poison and rushes to the Governor's Home. She tells the Governor the whole of the connected murders and dies. The wife is sentenced to death by wild beasts and to have public intercourse with Lucius the ass.

==Overview==

[[File:George Cruikshank - Tristram Shandy, Plate IV. The long-nosed Stranger of Strasburg.jpg|200px|thumb|right|The episodic structure of ''The Golden Ass'' inspired the style of ''humorous travel'' in picaresque novels such as ''[[Tristram Shandy]]'' (pictured) and [[The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling|''Tom Jones'']].]]

The text is a precursor to the literary genre of the episodic [[picaresque novel]], in which [[Francisco de Quevedo|Quevedo]], [[François Rabelais|Rabelais]], [[Giovanni Boccaccio|Boccaccio]], [[Miguel de Cervantes|Cervantes]], [[Voltaire]], [[Daniel Defoe|Defoe]] and many others have followed. It is an imaginative, irreverent, and amusing work that relates the ludicrous adventures of one Lucius, a virile young man who is obsessed with [[magic (paranormal)|magic]]. Finding himself in [[Thessaly]], the "birthplace of magic," Lucius eagerly seeks an opportunity to see magic being used. His overenthusiasm leads to his accidental transformation into an [[donkey|ass]]. In this guise, Lucius, a member of the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] country aristocracy, is forced to witness and share the miseries of [[slavery|slaves]] and [[poverty|destitute]] freemen who are reduced, like Lucius, to being little more than beasts of burden by their [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]] at the hands of wealthy landowners.

''The Golden Ass'' is the only surviving work of literature from the ancient Greco-Roman world to examine, from a first-hand perspective, the abhorrent condition of the lower classes. Yet despite its serious subject matter, the novel remains imaginative, witty, and often [[sexually explicit]]. Numerous amusing stories, many of which seem to be based on actual [[folklore|folk tales]], with their ordinary themes of simple-minded husbands, [[adultery|adulterous]] wives, and clever lovers, as well as the magical transformations that characterize the entire novel, are included within the main narrative. The longest of these inclusions is the tale of [[Cupid and Psyche]], encountered here for the first but not the last time in [[Western literature]].

===Style===
Apuleius' style is innovative, mannered, baroque and exuberant, a far cry from the more sedate Latinity familiar from the schoolroom. In the introduction to his translation of ''The Golden Ass'', Jack Lindsay writes:

{{quote|Let us glance at some of the details of Apuleius' style and it will become clear that English translators have not even tried to preserve and carry over the least tincture of his manner&amp;nbsp;... Take the description of the baker's wife: ''saeva scaeva virosa ebriosa pervicax pertinax''...&amp;nbsp; The nagging clashing effect of the rhymes gives us half the meaning. I quote two well-known versions: "She was crabbed, cruel, cursed, drunken, obstinate, niggish, phantasmagoric." "She was mischievous, malignant, addicted to men and wine, forward and stubborn." And here is the most recent one (by [[Robert Graves|R. Graves]]): "She was malicious, cruel, spiteful, lecherous, drunken, selfish, obstinate." Read again the merry and expressive doggerel of Apuleius and it will be seen how little of his vision of life has been transferred into English.}}

Lindsay's own version is: "She was lewd and crude, a toper and a groper, a nagging hag of a fool of a mule."

Sarah Ruden's recent translation is: "A fiend in a fight but not very bright, hot for a crotch, wine-botched, rather die than let a whim pass by &amp;ndash; that was her."&lt;ref&gt;Apuleius (Sarah Ruden, translator). The Golden Ass. New Haven &amp; London: Yale University Press, 2011. p. 195&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Apuleius' vocabulary is often eccentric and includes some [[archaism|archaic]] words. However, S. J. Harrison argues that some archaisms of [[syntax]] in the transmitted text may be the result of textual corruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = S. J. Harrison|editor = W. H. Keulen|title = Lectiones Scrupulosae: Essays on the Text and Interpretation of Apuleius' Metamorphoses in Honour of Maaike Zimmerman|series = ''Ancient Narrative'' Supplementum|year = 2006|publisher = Barkhuis|location = Groningen|isbn = 90-77922-16-4|pages = 59–67|chapter = Some Textual Problems in Apuleius' ''Metamorphoses''|display-editors = etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Final book===
{{further information|Mysteries of Isis}}
In the last book, the tone abruptly changes. Driven to desperation by his asinine form, Lucius calls for divine aid, and is answered by the goddess [[Isis]]. Eager to be initiated into the [[mystery cult]] of Isis, Lucius abstains from forbidden foods, bathes and purifies himself. Then the secrets of the cult's books are explained to him and further secrets revealed, before going through the process of initiation which involves a trial by the elements in a journey to the underworld. Lucius is then asked to seek initiation into the cult of [[Osiris]] in Rome, and eventually becomes initiated into the ''pastophoroi'', a group of priests that serves Isis and Osiris.&lt;ref&gt;Iles Johnson, Sarah, ''Mysteries'', in ''Ancient Religions'' pp. 104–5, The Belknap Press of Harvard University (2007), {{ISBN|978-0-674-02548-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptations and influence==

The style of autobiographical confession of suffering in ''The Golden Ass'' influenced [[Augustine|Augustine of Hippo]] in the tone and style—partly in Polemic—of his ''[[Confessions (St. Augustine)|Confessions]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Walsh, P.G. (1994). Introduction. ''The Golden Ass''. Oxford: Oxford UP. {{ISBN|978-0-19-954055-6}}&lt;!--WorldCat says this ISBN belongs to a 2008 edition, see https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/191752420 --&gt; p. xi&lt;/ref&gt; Scholars note that Apuleius came from the M'Daourouch in Algeria, where Augustine would later study. Augustine refers to Apuleius and ''The Golden Ass'' particularly derisively in [[City of God (book)|''City of God'']].

In 1517, [[Niccolò Machiavelli]] wrote [[The Golden Ass (Machiavelli)|his own version]] of the story, as a [[terza rima]] poem. It was uncompleted at the time of his death.&lt;ref&gt;Patapan, Haig (2006). ''Machiavelli in Love: The Modern Politics of Love and Fear''. Oxford: Lexington Press. {{ISBN|978-0-7391-1250-2}} p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1708, [[Charles Gildon]] published an adaptation of ''The Golden Ass'', titled ''The New Metamorphosis''. A year later in 1709, he published a re-adaptation, titled ''The Golden Spy'', which is regarded as the first, fully-fledged [[Novel of circulation|it-narrative]] in English.&lt;ref&gt;Wu, Jingyue (2017), ‘ “Nobilitas sola est atq; unica Virtus”: Spying and the Politics of Virtue in ''The Golden Spy; or, A Political Journal of the British Nights Entertainments'' (1709)’, ''Journal for Eighteenth-Century Studies'' 40:2 (2017), p.237-253 doi: 10.1111/1754-0208.12412&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1821, [[Charles Nodier]] published "Smarra ou les Demons de la Nuit" influenced by a lecture of Apuleius.

In 1883, [[Carlo Collodi]] published ''[[The Adventures of Pinocchio]]'' which includes an episode in which the puppet protagonist is transformed into an ass. Another character who is transformed alongside him is named Lucignolo ([[Candlewick (character)|Candlewick]] or Lampwick), a possible allusion to Lucius. The episode is frequently featured in its subsequent adaptations.

In 1915, [[Franz Kafka]] published the short story ''[[The Metamorphosis]]'' under a quite similar name, about a young man's unexpected transformation into an "Ungeziefer", a verminous bug.

In 1956, C. S. Lewis published the allegorical novel, ''[[Till We Have Faces]]'', retelling the Cupid–Psyche myth of books four through six from the point of view of Orual, Psyche's jealous ugly sister. The novel revolves upon the threat and hope of meeting the divine face to face. It has been called Lewis's "most compelling and powerful novel".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Filmer |first1=Kath |year=1993 |title=The Fiction of C. S. Lewis: Mask and Mirror |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=s_q-DAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA120&amp;dq=%22till+we+have+faces%22+%22most+compelling%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22till%20we%20have%20faces%22%20%22most%20compelling%22&amp;f=false |location=Basingstoke |publisher=Macmillan Press |page=120 |isbn=9781349225378 |access-date=27 October 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, comic-book artist [[Georges Pichard]] adapted the text into a [[graphic novel]] titled ''Les Sorcières de Thessalie''.

In April 1999, the [[Canadian Opera Company]] produced an operatic version of ''The Golden Ass'' by [[Randolph Peters]], the libretto of which was written by celebrated Canadian author [[Robertson Davies]]. An operatic production of ''The Golden Ass'' also appears as a plot device in Davies's novel ''[[A&amp;nbsp;Mixture of Frailties]]'' (1958).

In 1999, comic-book artist [[Milo Manara]] adapted the text into a fairly abridged graphic novel version named ''Le metamorfosi o l'asino d'oro''.

In the fantasy novel ''[[Silverlock]]'' by [[John Myers Myers]], the character Lucius Gil Jones is a composite of Lucius, Gil Blas in ''[[Gil Blas]]'' by [[Alain-René Lesage]], and Tom Jones in ''[[The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling]]'' by [[Henry Fielding]].

'''The Kipling Society''' is a [[literary society]] open to everyone interested in the work and life of British author [[Rudyard Kipling]] (1865-1936). The Kipling Society focuses on Kipling and his place in English Literature, and as such attracts members from all over the world, both general readers and academic researchers.  

The Society’s activities include: regular meetings in the UK, a programme of lectures in London, and a formal Annual Luncheon with a distinguished guest speaker, as well as conferences. The Society publishes ''The Kipling Journal'' quarterly,  and hosts a comprehensive website, which includes a Readers’ Guide to Kipling’s works.  In addition, it runs an essay writing competition for schools, answers enquiries from the public (schools, publishers and writers), and works with the media. In 2014 it contributed to programmes commemorating the centenary of the [[First World War]]. The Society is a Registered Charity (No. 278885) and its activities are managed by a Council and run by the Secretary and honorary officers: The Hon. Secretary, John Lambert; Chair, Mary Hamer; Deputy Chair, John Radcliffe; President, Roger Ayers; Librarian, John Walker; Journal Editor, Janet Montefiore. 
 
==History and Aims==
Founded in 1927 while Kipling was still alive, the society is one of the oldest and most enduring literary societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Alliance of Literary Societies|url=http://www.allianceofliterarysocieties.org.uk/id11.html|accessdate=2014-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Kipling Society was founded by J H C Brooking and a few fellow enthusiasts, including Kipling's school-friends Major General L C Dunsterville and G C Beresford, who featured in ''Stalky &amp; Co.'' as "Stalky" and "M'Turk".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carrington|first1=Charles|title=Rudyard Kipling: His Life and Work|date=1986 |origyear=1955|publisher=Penguin|location=London|pages=58, 62}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its aims are to promote interest in the works, life and times of Rudyard Kipling and to act as a physical and virtual meeting place for all those interested in him; to make the archive of existing knowledge accessible through its library and website; to foster new research and to support scholarly editions of previously unpublished work.

==Membership and Meetings==
Membership is open to anyone with an interest in the life and works of Rudyard Kipling. Members receive a copy of the quarterly Kipling Journal, and have access to the Society’s regular meetings, and to the Members’ pages of the Society’s web-site. The Society holds five meetings a year in central London, providing lectures and discussions on a range of Kipling-related topics. Meetings and seminars are also held in other parts of Britain from time to time.

==''The Kipling Journal''==
''The Kipling Journal'' is sent quarterly to all members of the Kipling Society and from January 2015 is peer-reviewed.{{cn|date=May 2015}} It includes articles, membership news, Society events, and the texts of talks given by invited speakers. Every issue of the journal is available online via the website except articles published within two years of the current date. 

==Conferences==
The Society organises conferences in partnership with academic institutions. These have attracted international scholars and been significant in developing thinking about Kipling’s work.{{cn|date=May 2015}}

''Kipling in America, 1892-1896'' was held at Marlboro College, Vermont, on October 7, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= The Boston Globe|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/arts/books/2013/10/07/vermont-hosts-kipling-society-meeting-outside-united-kingdom/gt0gC9nipwx26lcQcdEYQL/story.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; This symposium on Kipling's four years in [[Brattleboro, Vermont]] after his marriage to the American Caroline Balestier, focused on the influence of Kipling’s time in America on his work.
 
''Rudyard Kipling: an international writer'' was hosted by the [[Institute of English Studies]] at [[University of London]] in October 2011. This coincided with the launch of ''The Cambridge Companion to Kipling'' and many of its contributors were also speakers.
 
''The Kent Conference'' was held at the [[University of Kent]] in September 2007. The conference was organised to mark the centenary of Kipling's Nobel Prize for Literature. It was directed by Dr Jan Montefiore and sponsored by the Kipling Society.

''Post-Colonial Kipling'' was held at [[Magdalene College]], [[Cambridge University]] in September 2001, a century after the publication of ''Kim''. There were four major themes, Kipling: a post-colonial assessment, Kipling and women, Kipling and film, and Kipling in translation.

==The Kipling Library==
The Society maintains a research library of over 1,300 items which can be consulted by members. Kipling’s works were published in a variety of different editions during his lifetime and many of these are owned by the library.

The {{nihongo|'''''Ultra Series'''''|ウルトラシリーズ|Urutora Shirīzu}} is the collective name for all the shows produced by [[Tsuburaya Productions]] featuring [[Ultraman (character)|Ultraman]], his many brethren, and the myriad Ultra Monsters. The Ultra Series is one of the prominent [[tokusatsu]] superhero genre productions from Japan, along with [[Toei Company|Toei]] produced series ''[[Kamen Rider Series|Kamen Rider]]'', ''[[Super Sentai]]'' and the ''[[Metal Hero Series|Metal Heroes]]''. The Ultra Series is also one of the most well known examples of the ''daikaiju'' (大怪獣, "giant monster") genre, along with [[Toho]]'s ''[[Godzilla]]'' series, and [[Daiei Film]]'s ''[[Gamera]]'' series. However, the Ultra Series also falls into the ''kyodai hīro'' (巨大ヒーロー, "giant hero") subgenre of tokusatsu shows.

==The Ultramen==
{{Multiple issues|
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2015}}

}}
As revealed in ''[[Mega Monster Battle: Ultra Galaxy]]'', the Ultramen are a technologically advanced civilization who were originally identical to humans. They were evolved into their current state of being following the activation of the Plasma Spark, which replaced their dead sun. [[Ultraman (character)|Ultraman]] and his many kin are usually red-and-silver (although several color variations have been seen in recent years) and have glowing yellow almond-shaped dome eyes (although there are exceptions to both the shape and color) and various abilities, most notably firing energy beams from their crossed hands and flight. They share a strong cultural sense of justice and duty, a majority of Ultramen joining the {{nihongo|Space Garrison|宇宙警備隊|Uchū Keibitai}} to maintain peace in the universe from invaders and monsters.

The Ultramen that are sent to other worlds are given Color Timers, or "warning lights", which blink with increasing frequency and turn from blue to red if an Ultraman's energy supply dwindles or he is mortally wounded. Due to human pollution and the light filtering effects of the atmosphere, an Ultraman can remain active on Earth for a limited span of minutes before their energy is depleted and they die. This forces an Ultraman to either assume a human form or merge with a human host body. The latter process has healing properties that include reviving a recently dead person with their own lifeforce.

Ultra beings also appear to be near-impossible to permanently kill, as several times an Ultra being has been killed only to be revived by another member of their species. As when Mebius' allies revived him with their energy after his defeat by Empire, an Ultraman can be revived with a massive energy infusion. Ultramen always try to avoid battles in inhabited areas or near innocent bystanders, and try minimize collateral property damage. If these concerns cannot be met, a city like Tokyo could be destroyed.

==The Ultraman phenomenon==
The show ''[[Ultraman]]'' was followed by many other series. Sequels to the original series are: ''[[Ultra Seven]]'' (1967, [[Tokyo Broadcasting System|TBS]]), ''[[The Return of Ultraman]]'' (1971, TBS), ''[[Ultraman Ace]]'' (1972, TBS), ''[[Ultraman Taro]]'' (1973, TBS), ''[[Ultraman Leo]]'' (1974, TBS), ''[[Ultraman 80]]'' (1980, TBS), ''[[Ultraman Tiga]]'' (1996, [[Mainichi Broadcasting System|MBS]]), ''[[Ultraman Dyna]]'' (1997, MBS), ''[[Ultraman Gaia]]'' (1998, MBS), and ''[[Ultraman Cosmos]]'' (2001, MBS). Recently the studio tried a reinvention of the hero through the "Ultra N Project", which involved three heroes: Ultraman Noa (the "mascot" of the Ultra N Project, who appears in stage shows as well as the final episode of ''Ultraman Nexus'') in late 2003, ''[[Ultraman Nexus]]'' (2004, [[Chubu-Nippon Broadcasting|CBC]]), and ''[[Ultraman (2004 film)|ULTRAMAN]]'' (2004, Shochiku Productions). This was followed by a return to old-school style series in the form of ''[[Ultraman Max]]'' (2005, CBC). In the course of the ''Max'' series, another new hero known as Ultraman Xenon was also introduced. April 2006 saw the 40th anniversary series, ''[[Ultraman Mebius]]'', which signalled a long-awaited return to the original universe. Another hero was also introduced: ''[[Ultraman Hikari]]'', formerly known as Hunter Knight Tsurugi.

The franchise has also been in the movie theaters, starting with ''[[Ultraman Zearth]]'' and ''Ultraman Zearth 2,'' ''[[Ultraman Tiga: The Final Odyssey]],'' released in 2000, as well as ''ULTRAMAN,'' a movie that opened in December 2004. The straight-to-video market also saw the release of ''[[Ultraman Neos]]'' in 2000, as well as special features for Ultraman Tiga, Dyna, and Gaia, who have teamed up in theatrical features (Tiga and Dyna once, as well as the three of them all together). The ''Ultraman Mebius and Ultra Brothers'' movie opened in September 2006.

Foreign productions include the 1987 [[Hanna-Barbera]] co-production ''[[Ultraman: The Adventure Begins]]'' (in [[Japanese language|Japanese]], ''Ultraman USA''), an animated movie; ''[[Ultraman: Towards the Future]]'' (in Japanese, ''Ultraman Great''), an Australian 1991 production and ''[[Ultraman: The Ultimate Hero]]'' (in Japanese, ''Ultraman Powered''), produced in the [[United States]] in 1993. Ultraman series have also been dubbed into various languages, including English, Spanish (only ''Ultra Q'', the original ''Ultraman'', ''Ultra Seven'', ''Return of Ultraman'', ''Ultraman Great'' &amp; ''Ultraman Tiga'' were known to be translated into [[Spanish language|Spanish]]), Portuguese  (''Ultraman'', ''Ultra Seven'', ''Return of Ultraman'' and ''Ultraman Tiga'' in [[Brazil]]), [[Korean language|Korean]], [[Malay language|Malay]], [[Standard Chinese|Mandarin]], [[Indonesian Language|Indonesian]], [[Cantonese]] and [[Filipino language|Filipino]] (''Ultraman Tiga'', ''Ultraman Dyna'', ''Ultraman Gaia'', ''Ultraman Nexus'', ''Ultraman Max'' and ''Ultraman Mebius''). Also of note is the [[American English]] dub of ''Ultraman Tiga'' by [[4Kids Entertainment]] that aired in 2002. The dub considerably distorted the characterization and general mood of the series, and it achieved only limited success.

In 1993, Tsuburaya Productions and [[Toei Company]] co-produced ''[[Ultraman vs. Kamen Rider]],'' a crossover with the original Ultraman and Toei's ''[[Kamen Rider]]''. This direct-to-video feature is co-copyrighted by both Toei (and its subordinates, Toei Video and Ishinomori Productions) and Tsuburaya Productions.

At present, Tsuburaya Productions accepts 36 Ultramen as official (counting Ultraman Legend, the combined form of Ultramen Cosmos and Justice, as a separate entity). This figure does not account for Thai-produced Ultramen. (The figure is 38 if Next, Noa, and Nexus are counted as separate entities—it has been revealed in ''Nexus'' that all three are a single being with various modes used by different hosts.) In 2013, the Ultra Series was cited in the [[Guinness Book of World Records]] as the record-holder for the most number of spinoff shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tsuburaya-prod.co.jp/pressrelease/130912-guinness/ |title="最も派生テレビシリーズが作られたテレビ番組"として『ウルトラマン』が世界記録に認定 &amp;#124; 株式会社 円谷プロダクション |publisher=Tsuburaya-prod.co.jp |date=2013-07-10 |accessdate=2013-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ultraman brand generated $7.4 billion in merchandising revenue from 1966 to 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.4kidsentertainment.com/properties/ultraman.html|title=Properties-Ultraman |website=4kidsentertainment.com|accessdate=January 1, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050228095359/http://www.4kidsentertainment.com/properties/ultraman.html|archivedate=February 28, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The government of [[Malaysia]] banned the printing of an ''Ultraman'' book because it compared the character of Ultraman King (from the film ''[[Mega Monster Battle: Ultra Galaxy]]'') with "[[Allah]]", the Arabic word for God, even though it is commonly used in [[Malaysian language|Malaysian]] to refer to any "God". The [[Ministry of Home Affairs (Malaysia)|Ministry of Home Affairs]] stated that the comparison may "confuse Muslim children and damage their faith".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stout|first1=David|title=A Japanese Superhero Is Apparently Destroying Malaysia|url=http://time.com/15265/ultraman-banned-malaysia-allah/|website=Time|accessdate=December 7, 2017|date=March 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, ''[[Ultraman Ginga S: Showdown! Ultra 10 Warriors!!]]'' and ''[[Ultraman X: Here It Comes! Our Ultraman]]'' were released on January 8, 2017 in the United States as a double feature; this was the first North American theatrical release of an Ultraman feature film in its entire 50-year history. ''Ultraman Max'', ''Ultraman 80'', ''Ultraman Neos'', ''Ultraman Nexus'', ''Ultraseven X'', ''The Ultraman'' and more series began airing in the United States on the [[Toku (TV network)|TOKU]] channel.

At the Tokyo Comic Con on December 7, 2017, Tsuburaya Productions revealed that an anime adaptation of the [[Ultraman (manga)|manga]] was planned for release in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Foywonder|title=Teaser Trailer for Ultraman CGI Anime Movie Coming in 2019|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/261737/teaser-trailer-ultraman-cgi-anime-movie-coming-2019/|website=Dread Central|accessdate=December 7, 2017|date=December 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Ultra multiverse==

Although the different Ultra series and movies take place in different continuities, that does not mean that they take place in different canons. A major plot aspect of the Ultra Series is the multiverse, which is a collection of countless bubble-shaped universes. This was first hinted at in ''[[Ultraman Tiga]]'', and then again in ''[[Ultraman Dyna]]'', when the title character gets sucked into a wormhole that transports him throughout the multiverse. The multiverse was first glimpsed in the 2010 film ''[[Ultraman Zero: The Revenge of Belial]]'' when Ultraman Zero has to travel through it in order to get to his destination. The multiverse has become a bigger and bigger element of the plot over time, and the Ultras are now often seen traveling through the multiverse. In fact, the 2012 film ''[[Ultraman Saga]]'' takes place in four different universes.

=="Digital Ultra" Japanese DVD release==
In Japan, there have been several box sets that were released which would each contain a particular Ultra series. As of now,{{when|date=November 2015}} there are only four such box sets. The sets were released as part of the Digital Ultra movement where the shows would be re-released with digital remastering.

The following are the series which have been released as such:
*''Ultra Q''
*''Ultraman''
*''Ultra Seven''
*''Ultraman Jack''

The "Digital Ultra" re-release order of the series may not match the chronological order in which they were originally aired in Japan.

==Licensing rights dispute==
Ultraman's [[licensing]] rights outside [[Japan]] have been the subject of a prolonged legal dispute between Tsuburaya Productions and Chaiyo Productions (also called Tsuburaya Chaiyo Co Ltd) based in [[Thailand]]. Tsuburaya had previously collaborated with Chaiyo on the production of two movies, ''[[The 6 Ultra Brothers vs. the Monster Army]]'' and ''[[Jumborg Ace &amp; Giant]]''—the latter of which featured another Tsuburaya superhero, [[Jumborg Ace]]—in 1974. [[Sompote Sands|Sompote Saengduenchai]], founder/president of Chaiyo Productions, claimed and maintained that in 1976, the late Noboru Tsuburaya, Eiji's son, who had died in 1995, had given him and his company a contract which had given him rights to everything Ultraman outside Japanese territories in exchange for a monetary loan. The claim is rumored to have originated from a gamble held by a drunken Hajime Tsuburaya (Noboru's older brother) and Sompote Saengduenchai over the rights to the franchise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uni.2ch.net/test/read.cgi/rsfx/1143316019/|title=【三代目】円谷皐【次男】|publisher=Uni.2ch.net|date=|accessdate=2015-08-18|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150928175420/http://uni.2ch.net/test/read.cgi/rsfx/1143316019/|archivedate=2015-09-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=December 2017}}

In spite of the fact that the document failed to state clearly and specifically exactly what had been given to Tsuburaya in exchange for these rights, Japanese and Thai courts accepted this contract as real and binding because of the supposed [[hanko (stamp)|hanko]] of the late Noboru Tsuburaya in the document. Tsuburaya Productions insisted and maintained that the contract was a forgery (due to factual errors, including the faulty titles of the series in the document, such as ''[[Ultra Q]]'' being called ''"Ultraman 1: Ultra Q"'', ''[[Ultra Seven]]'' being called ''"Ultraman 3: Ultraman Seven"'', and Tsuburaya Productions being called "Tsuburaya Prod. and Enterprises", a name the company never did business under), and repeatedly contested the issue.

In the course of the legal battle, Sompote presented photos of himself sharing his photos of Thai Buddhist edifices stating that Eiji had based Ultraman's face on the said edifices, a claim which he has continued to hold since the dispute began. No other evidence supporting this claim was known to exist.

After an 8-year battle in the courts of both countries, Sompote Saengduenchai was awarded a favorable decision on April 27, 2004. The exact ruling fell into some dispute: Some said it only gave him merchandising rights for the first six Ultra Series (''[[Ultra Q]]'' through ''[[Ultraman Taro]]'') and ''[[Jumborg Ace]]'' outside Japan, and broadcasting rights of said shows within Thailand. Other accounts, usually reported in the Thai/Asian media, said that Chaiyo had gained the rights to those six shows everywhere outside Japan. The latter could be taken as Chaiyo's side of the story, as Tsuburaya was reported in the Japanese media to continue taking further action against them.

Tsuburaya decided not to market any of the disputed six Ultra Series outside Japan until it had completely settled the rights issues with Chaiyo, although the company continued to merchandise and distribute all of the Ultraman programs created after Ultraman Taro, including the theatrical feature ''[[Ultraman the Next]],'' throughout the world. Because of the copyright struggle, importing literature on Ultraman into [[Singapore]] and [[Malaysia]] was prohibited. It also resulted in a slight backlash against Thai Ultraman fans, who were assumed to be outright Chaiyo supporters.

In 2005 the American company BCI Eclipse announced they had acquired the DVD rights to ''[[Ultraman]]'' from Chaiyo. A 3-disc box set containing the first 20 episodes of the series was released on July 18, 2006, and a second 3-disc box set containing the remaining 19 episodes was released on November 7, 2006. Both sets feature the original Japanese [[monaural]] dialogue track as well as the [[English language|English]]-dubbed version produced by [[United Artists]] for [[North America]]n syndication. At certain times, the English dialogue track switched over to the Japanese dialogue for small periods of time. This was because BCI had used audio from older recordings in which several scenes had to be cut or shortened for the American broadcast in order to fit running time constraints.  Tsuburaya Productions still held on to the complete original English dubbing materials, which they had obtained from a warehouse in 1997, and refused to provide them for BCI. (Contrary to BCI's statements, the original English dubs were complete and uncut, except for a small cut in the conclusion of Episode 36, "Gift From The Sky.")

During the time of the legal battle, Chaiyo came up with three of their own Ultras: Ultraman Millennium, Dark Ultraman (an evil Ultra), and Ultraman Elite. These were not used for purposes other than stage shows and merchandise. Chaiyo also created a TV series he called "Project Ultraman", un-aired as of late March 2008, a joint project in China featuring his own Ultraman and attaching Hong Kong star, [[Ekin Cheng]] to the project.

On August 23, 2006, Tsuburaya Productions filed a new lawsuit against Chaiyo for copyright infringement and plagiarism (concerning their three original Ultraman characters), and the court case was taken to [[China]]. The Chinese courts in Beijing opened "The Ultraman Copyright Study Group" in response to the lawsuit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Johnson|first1=Bob|title=Ultraman in Dispute!|url=http://www.scifijapan.com/articles/2006/10/05/ultraman-in-dispute/|website=SciFi Japan|accessdate=2015-08-18|date=2006-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2007, the Thailand Intellectual Property Court ruled in favor of Tsuburaya Productions, ordering Chaiyo to cease and desist making commercial profits from Chaiyo-produced Ultraman characters such as Millennium, Dark, and Elite. The defendants were also fined [[Thai baht|THB]] 15,000,000 (approx. [[Japanese yen|JPY]] 50,904,959 or US$428,673.50 c. April 2007) plus interest and attorneys' fees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Thailand: Court orders Tsuburaya Chaiyo and Chaiyo Productions to stop making a commercial profit from new Ultraman characters|url=http://www.tmcnet.com/usubmit/2007/04/06/2467559.htm|website=TMCnet.com|accessdate=2015-08-18|date=2007-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2007/04/05/pda/business_30031118.html |title=Bangkok's Independent Newspaper |publisher=Nationmultimedia.com |date=2007-04-05 |accessdate=2015-08-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160104172131/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2007/04/05/pda/business_30031118.html |archivedate=2016-01-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Project Ultraman" went on hiatus as a result of the ruling, which implied that although Chaiyo owned the right to some of the Ultraman series, it did not own the right to Ultraman and his brothers, including the design. Chaiyo gained permission to merchandise the original series, but lost the right to create and market its own Ultraman, or even use the original, without Tsuburaya's consent.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

On February 5, 2008, Thailand's Supreme Court ruled in favor of Tsuburaya Productions of Japan after they made an appeal to the initial ruling. The ruling ended the long legal battle by finding Sompote Saengduenchai was not a co-creator of Ultraman. The decision ended Sompote's bid to continue his enterprise, and the court gave Sompote 30 days to stop profiteering from Ultraman. The final ruling saw Tsuburaya Productions as the sole copyright owner. Sompote was also required to pay THB 10,700,000 plus interest at the rate of 7.5 per cent a year starting from December 16, 1997, when the original lawsuit was filed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Final ruling in Ultraman case|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/search/page.news.php?clid=6&amp;id=30064541|website=The Nation|accessdate=August 9, 2017|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080215145850/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/search/page.news.php?clid=6&amp;id=30064541|archivedate=February 15, 2008|date=February 6, 2008|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the Thai Intellectual Property Court and the Tokyo District Court both ruled in favour of the Thai company. This led to the Tokyo District Court on September 30, 2010, ordering Tsuburaya Productions Co of Japan to pay damages of 16.36 million yen (Bt5.9 million) to Sompote Saengduenchai of Thailand for violating his overseas copyrights on Ultraman characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=THE NATION Published on October 7, 2010 |url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/home/2010/10/07/business/Thai-wins-Ultraman-copyright-case-in-Tokyo-30139555.html |title=Thai wins Ultraman copyright case in Tokyo |publisher=Nationmultimedia.com |date=2010-10-07 |accessdate=2013-09-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160104171724/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/home/2010/10/07/business/Thai-wins-Ultraman-copyright-case-in-Tokyo-30139555.html |archivedate=January 4, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the announcement of the ''[[Dragon Force: So Long, Ultraman]]'' movie in July 2017, the dispute on the ownership of the franchise has escalated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Aiken|first1=Keith|title=Chinese Ultraman Movie Latest Chapter in Ongoing Rights Dispute|url=http://www.scifijapan.com/articles/2017/07/28/chinese-ultraman-movie-latest-chapter-in-ongoing-rights-dispute/|website=SciFi Japan|accessdate=2 October 2017|date=28 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; But in November 20, 2017, through a Los Angeles court ruling by judge Judge Andre Birotte Jr, Tsuburaya won the lawsuit against Chaiyo and affiliate groups on the rights of the series after the jury concluded that the supposed agreement between Noboru Tsuburaya and Chaiyo was "not authentic".&lt;ref&gt;http://henshinjustice.com/blog/2017/11/22/the-fate-of-ultraman-rights-tsuburaya-defeats-chaiyo-in-latest-court-battle/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2017-11-26/tsuburaya-productions-wins-case-for-ultraman-international-licensing-rights/.124333&lt;/ref&gt; Despite UM Corporation and Chaiyo filing a counter-dispute,&lt;ref&gt;http://henshinjustice.com/blog/2018/03/14/ultraman-rights-challenged-once-again-tsuburaya-productions-back-in-court/&lt;/ref&gt; on April 18, 2018, the legal court came to a definite close where a final judgement states that the dispute and the document was deemed invalid, forbidding UMC to use the Ultra Series and all its related characters and forced them to pay Tsubaraya damages for its infringement of its rights.&lt;ref&gt;https://en.tsuburaya-prod.co.jp/news/395&lt;/ref&gt;
