'''222 Second Street''' is a {{convert|370|ft|adj=on}} office [[skyscraper]] in the [[South of Market (San Francisco)|South of Market District]] of [[San Francisco]], [[California]]. It is under lease by social networking company [[LinkedIn]] (headquartered in nearby [[Sunnyvale, California|Sunnyvale]]).

Developed by [[Tishman Speyer]] and designed by [[Thomas Phifer]], the high rise was planned to provide {{convert|450209|ft2}} of office space, {{convert|2209|ft2}} of ground floor retail, and {{Convert|8600|ft2|m2}} of open space accessible to the public, at the southern corner of Second and [[Howard Street (San Francisco)|Howard]] Streets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.socketsite.com/archives/2013/02/222_second_street_tower_ready_to_start_construction_thi.html |title=Second Street Tower Ready To Start Construction This Summer |work=SocketSite |date=February 19, 2013 |accessdate=August 31, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Construction began in August 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sf.curbed.com/archives/2013/08/13/leedrated_office_tower_breaks_ground_at_second_and_howard.php |title=LEED-Rated Office Tower Breaks Ground at Second and Howard |date=August 8, 2013 |first=Michael |last=Conrad |work=Curbed SF |accessdate=October 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; still without a tenant on hand.&lt;ref name="sfbusiness"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/print-edition/2016/03/25/linkedin-222-second-st-sf-hq-tishman-speyer.html|title=LinkedIn connects all its S.F. employees under one roof at Tishman Speyer’s tower at 222 Second St. - San Francisco Business Times|date=2016-03-25|website=San Francisco Business Times|access-date=2016-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2014, LinkedIn announced it was leasing the building for an undisclosed sum, to accommodate up to 2,500 of its employees,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/technology/article/LinkedIn-leases-skyscraper-under-construction-in-5422501.php |title=LinkedIn leases 26-story S.F. skyscraper |first=Benny |last=Evangelista |date=April 23, 2014 |work=San Francisco Chronicle}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the lease covering 10 years.&lt;ref name="sfbusiness"/&gt; The goal was to join all of its San Francisco based staff (1,250 as of January 2016) in one building, bring sales and marketing employees together with the [[research and development]] team.&lt;ref name="sfbusiness" /&gt;

The building was topped-out in August 2014&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sfhog.com/222-second-street-construction-progress-aug-2014/ |title=Crews Close To Topping Out 222 Second Street |work=SFHog |date=August 8, 2014 |first=Rob |last=Nicolo}}&lt;/ref&gt; and opened in March 2016,&lt;ref name="lang" /&gt; with LinkedIn staff moving in&lt;!--not a mistake--&gt; in stages until 2017.&lt;ref name="sfbusiness" /&gt;

The ground floor is open to the public during work hours, as a [[privately owned public space]].&lt;ref name="lang" /&gt; It features three large artworks by [[Frank Stella]],&lt;ref name="sfchronking" /&gt; in accordance with the developers' [[public art]] proposal to the city Planning Commission, with the purchase price of $1 million matching 1% of the total "construction hard costs".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://commissions.sfplanning.org/cpcpackets/222%202nd%20Street.pdf|title=Memo to the Planning Commission|last=Guy|first=Kevin|date=2014-07-02|website=|publisher=San Francisco Planning Department|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[San Francisco Chronicle]]'s architecture critic John King characterized the building as "severe yet sleek" and expressed appreciation for the arrangement of the "panes of overlapping glass 6 feet wide and 13 feet high [that] cover a form that begins as a squat 16-story rectangle and concludes as a 10-story square. On the lower four stories the shingled pattern fans to the right; the fifth floor panels are flat, side by side, and then the shingles resume in reverse, flipping tightly to the left. The upper floors reverse the pattern yet again."&lt;ref name="sfchronking"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/place/article/SF-skyline-s-new-LinkedIn-addition-is-built-by-7218875.php|title=SF skyline’s new LinkedIn addition is built by, for New Yorkers|last=King|first=John|date=2016-03-31|website=San Francisco Chronicle|access-date=2016-04-02}} {{closed access}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, while acknowledging their appeal in certain light situations ("a large-scale shuffle of vivid reflections"), King criticized their dark color (evoking a "dull gloom" on cloudy days).&lt;ref name="sfchronking" /&gt; And he chastised the building - "designed and built by New Yorkers" - as being aesthetically out of place on Second Street, "an alien presence in a well-established setting where other recent buildings have done their best to add to the ambiance".&lt;ref name="sfchronking" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sf.curbed.com/2016/4/1/11350454/darth-vader-linkedin-controversial-headquarters|title=A Look Inside LinkedIn's Controversial New Building|last=Keeling|first=Brock|date=2016-04-01|website=Curbed SF|access-date=2016-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, when sound passes through an acoustic board, the intensity of sound is decreased. The loss of sound energy is balanced by producing heat energy.

==Uses==
They are used in [[auditoriums]], [[hall]]s, [[seminar rooms]], [[libraries]], [[courts]] and wherever sound insulation is needed. Acoustic boards are also used in speaker boxes.

'''Advanced silicon etching''' ('''ASE''') is a [[deep reactive-ion etching]] (DRIE) technique to rapidly etch deep and high aspect ratio structures in silicon.
ASE was pioneered by Surface Technology Systems Plc. (STS) in 1994 in the UK. STS has continued to develop this process with even greater etch rates while maintaining side wall roughness and selectivity.
STS developed the switched process originally invented by Dr. Larmer at Bosch, Stuttgart.
ASE consists in combining the fast etch rates achieved in an [[isotropic]] Si etch (usually making use of an SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; [[plasma (physics)|plasma]]) with a deposition or [[passivation (chemistry)|passivation]] process (usually utilising a [[octafluorocyclobutane|C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;F&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;]] plasma condensation process) by alternating the two process steps. This approach achieves the fastest etch rates while maintaining the ability to etch [[anisotropy|anisotropically]], typically vertically in Microelectromechanical Systems ([[microelectromechanical systems]] (MEMS)) applications.
&lt;blockquote&gt;The ASE HRM is an evolution of the previous generations of ICP design, now incorporating a decoupled plasma source (patent pending). This decoupled source generates very high density plasma which is allowed to diffuse into a separate process chamber. Through careful chamber design, the excess ions that are detrimental to process control are reduced, leaving a uniform distribution of fluorine free-radicals at a higher density than that available from the conventional ICP sources. The higher fluorine free-radical density facilitates increased etch rates, typically over three times the etch rates achieved with the original Bosch process. Also, as a result of the reduction in the effect of localised depletion of these species, improved uniformity for many applications can be achieved.&lt;ref&gt;Hopkins et al. 2004 Developments in Si and SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; Etching for MEMS-based Optical Applications (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''AeA''' (formerly the '''American Electronics Association''') was a nationwide [[Non-profit organization|non-profit]] trade association that represented all segments of the technology industry. It lobbied governments at the state, federal, and international levels; provided access to capital and business opportunities; and offered select business services and networking programs.

In 2008 the AeA merged with the [[Information Technology Association of America]] (ITAA) to form [[TechAmerica]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.techamerica.org/aea-itaa-announce-merger AeA, ITAA Announce Merger] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326045812/http://www.techamerica.org/aea-itaa-announce-merger |date=March 26, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
AeA was founded in 1943 by [[David Packard]] and 25 of [[Hewlett-Packard]]'s suppliers to help lobby for government contracts. It was originally named the West Coast Electronic Manufacturers Association (WCEMA). In 1969, WCEMA changed its name to the Western Electronic Manufacturers Association (WEMA) to reflect the growing membership outside [[California]]. In 1977, the association once again changed its name to the American Electronics Association, in an effort to more accurately represent its 750 members nationwide.  A final name change occurred in 2001, as the American Electronics Association was shortened to AeA with the tagline "Advancing the Business of Technology."

AeA had 18 offices across the United States, and had two international offices in [[Brussels]] and [[Beijing]].  AeA had nearly 2,500 corporate members (and the 1.8&amp;nbsp;million employees they represent nationwide) at the time of the merger.  The membership was drawn from a wide range of high tech sectors, including the aerospace/defense, business related services, computers, medical equipment, semiconductors/electronic components, software, and telecommunications industries.  [http://www.aeanet.org/AboutAeA/aajl_historymain0807.asp]

Since 1959, AeA has awarded an annual [[David Packard Medal of Achievement|Medal of Achievement]] to a recipient selected for contributions and advances within the high-tech industry, their community, and humankind.&lt;ref name="info"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aeanet.org/Events/svcg_MOA2008OnlineBrochure.asp#Recipients|title=TechAmerica Medal of Achievement Honoring Paul Otellini|accessdate=2009-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AeA also produced an annual ''Cyberstates'' report which quantifies the high-tech industry on a state-by-state basis in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aeanet.org/cyberstate&lt;/ref&gt; s

On September 11, 2008, The Boards of Directors of AeA and the Information Technology Association of America (ITAA) announced that they are in discussions to merge the trade associations’ memberships and programs.

''(top left)'' 1&amp;nbsp;kW amplidyne motor-generator, ''(bottom left)'' 3&amp;nbsp;kW amplidyne motor-generator, ''(right)'' 5&amp;nbsp;kW amplidyne generator.]]
[[File:US2236984-Figure1.png|thumb|Figure 1 of the patent drawing]]

An '''amplidyne''' is an [[electromechanical]] [[amplifier]] invented prior to [[World War II]] by [[Ernst Alexanderson]]. It consists of an [[electric motor]] driving a DC [[electric generator|generator]]. The signal to be amplified is applied to the generator's [[field winding]], and its output voltage is an amplified copy of the field current. The amplidyne is used in industry in high power [[servo drive|servo]] and control systems, to amplify low power control signals to control powerful [[electric motor]]s, for example. It is now mostly obsolete.

==How an amplidyne works==
An amplidyne is an [[electric motor]] which turns a [[electric generator|generator]] on the same shaft. Unlike an ordinary [[motor-generator]], the purpose of an amplidyne is not to generate a steady voltage but to generate a voltage proportional to an input current, to [[amplifier|amplify]] the input. The motor provides the power, turning the generator at a constant speed, and the signal to be amplified is applied to the generator's [[field winding]]. The higher the current applied to the winding, the stronger the [[magnetic field]] and thus the higher the output voltage of the generator. So the output voltage of the generator is an amplified copy of the current waveform applied to the field winding. In a typical generator the load brushes are positioned perpendicular to the magnetic field flux. To convert a generator to an amplidyne, what would normally be the load brushes are connected together and the output is taken from another set of brushes that are parallel with the field. The perpendicular brushes are now called the 'quadrature' brushes. This simple change can increase the gain by a factor of 10,000 or more.

The amplidyne's frequency response is limited to low frequencies, it cannot even handle audio frequencies, so its use is limited to amplifying low frequency control signals in industrial processes.

Historically, amplidynes were one of the first amplifiers to generate very high power (tens of kilowatts), allowing precise [[feedback]] control of heavy machinery. [[Vacuum tubes]] of reasonable size were unable to deliver enough power to control large motors, but vacuum tube circuits driving the input of an amplidyne could be used to boost small signals up to the power needed to drive large motors. Early ([[World War II]] era) gun tracking and radar systems used this approach.

Amplidynes are now obsolete technology, replaced by modern [[power semiconductor device|power semiconductor]] electronic devices such as [[MOSFET]]s and [[IGBT]]s which can produce output power in the kilowatt range.

==Use in gun mount control systems==
[[File:Amplidynecircuit.gif|400px|right|thumb|Amplidyne circuit as used in U.S. Navy naval gun control. This is a high-power position servo system.]]

The amplidyne was first used in the US Navy in servo systems to control the electric motors rotating naval gun mounts, to aim the gun at a target. The system ''(diagram right)'' is a [[feedback control|feedback control system]] in which a feedback signal from a sensor representing the current position of the gun is compared with the control signal which represents the desired position, and the difference is amplified by the amplidyne generator to turn the gun mount motor. The components are:
*a [[synchro]] control transformer;
*an [[amplifier]];
*the amplidyne motor-generator, which is similar to a [[Ward Leonard control]] drive;
*and the follow-up DC motor which drives the load to be positioned.

Chapter 10 of the [[U.S. Navy]] manual ''Naval Ordnance and Gunnery, Volume 1'' (1957) explains the operation of the amplidyne:&lt;ref name=USN/&gt;
:"The synchro control transformer receives the order signal which indicates electrically what the position of the load should be. The rotor of the synchro control transformer is turned by the response shaft, which is geared to the load and so indicates what the position of the load actually is. The synchro compares the actual load position with the ordered position; and, if the two do not agree, it generates an alternating-current signal which is transmitted to the amplifier. The angular difference between the two positions is called the error, and the signal to the amplifier is the error signal. The error signal indicates by its electrical characteristics the size and direction of the error. If no error exists, the system is said to be in correspondence and the error signal is zero."&lt;ref name="USN"&gt;[http://www.eugeneleeslover.com/USNAVY/CHAPTER-10-D.html ''Naval Ordnance and Gunnery, Volume 1'', 1957, U.S. Navy Manual, Chapter 10.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Specifically, the phase of the control transformer's output (in phase with the synchro power source, or opposite phase)
provided the polarity of the error signal. A phase-sensitive demodulator, with the synchro AC power as its reference, created the DC error signal of the required polarity.

==Applications==
Amplidynes were initially used for electric elevators and to point [[naval artillery|naval guns]], and antiaircraft [[artillery]] radar such as [[SCR-584]] in 1942.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}
Later used to control processes in [[steel mill|steelworks]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

Used to remotely operate the [[control rod]]s in early nuclear submarine designs ([[S3G]] Triton).{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

[[Diesel-electric locomotive]] control systems. Early [[ALCO]] road-switcher locomotives used this technology.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8236">A '''building envelope''' is the physical separator between the conditioned and unconditioned environment of a [[building]] including the resistance to air, water, heat,&lt;ref&gt;Cleveland, Cutler J., and Christopher G. Morris. "Building envelopergy''. Expanded Edition. Burlington: Elsevier, 2009. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; light, and noise&lt;ref name="Syed" &gt;Syed, Asif. ''Advanced building technologies for sustainability''. Hoboken, N.J.: John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 2012. 115. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; transfer.

==Discussion==
The building envelope is all of the elements of the outer shell that maintain a dry, heated, or cooled indoor environment and facilitate its [[climate control]]. Building envelope design is a specialized area of architectural and engineering practice that draws from all areas of [[building science]] and indoor climate control.&lt;ref name="Syed" /&gt;

The many functions of the building envelope can be separated into three categories:&lt;ref name="Straube"&gt;Straube, J.F., Burnett, E.F.P. ''Building Science for Building Enclosures''. Building Science Press, Westford, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Support (to resist and transfer structural and dynamic loads)
* Control (the flow of matter and energy of all types)
* Finish (to meet desired esthetics on the inside and outside)

The control function is at the core of good performance, and in practice focuses, in order of importance, on rain control, air control, heat control, and vapor control.&lt;ref name="Straube"/&gt;

==Water and water vapor control==
Control of rain is most fundamental, and there are numerous strategies to this end, namely, perfect barriers, drained screens, and mass / storage systems.&lt;ref&gt;11. Straube, J.F. and Burnett, E.F.P., "Rain Control and Design Strategies". ''Journal of Thermal Insulation and Building Envelopes'', July 1999, pp. 41–56.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the main purposes of a [[roof]] is to resist water. Two broad categories of roofs are flat and pitched. [[Flat roof]]s actually slope up to 10° or 15° but are built to resist standing water. Pitched roofs are designed to shed water but not resist standing water which can occur during wind-driven rain or [[Ice dam (roof)|ice damming]]. Typically residential, pitched roofs are covered with an underlayment material beneath the roof covering material as a second line of defense. [[Domestic roof construction]] may also be ventilated to help remove moisture from leakage and condensation.

Walls do not get as severe water exposure as roofs but still leak water. Types of wall systems with regard to water penetration are ''barrier'', ''drainage'' and ''surface-sealed walls''.&lt;ref&gt;various authors. ''Guideline for condition assessment of the building envelope''. Reston, Va.: American Society of Civil Engineers, 2000. 4. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Barrier walls are designed to allow water to be absorbed but not penetrate the wall, and include concrete and some masonry walls. Drainage walls allow water that leaks into the wall to drain out such as [[cavity wall]]s. Drainage walls may also be ventilated to aid drying such as [[rainscreen]] and pressure equalization wall systems. Sealed-surface walls do not allow any water penetration at the exterior surface of the siding material. Generally most materials will not remain sealed over the long term and this system is very limited, but ordinary residential construction often treats walls as sealed-surface systems relying on the [[siding]] and an underlayment layer sometimes called [[housewrap]].

Moisture can enter basements through the walls or floor. [[Basement waterproofing]] and [[French drain|drainage]] keep the walls dry and a moisture barrier is needed under the floor.

==Air control==
{{main|Air barrier}}

Control of air flow is important to ensure indoor air quality, control energy consumption, avoid condensation (and thus help ensure durability), and to provide comfort. Control of air movement includes flow through the enclosure (the assembly of materials that perform this function is termed the air barrier system) or through components of the building envelope (interstitial) itself, as well as into and out of the interior space, (which can affect [[building insulation]] performance greatly). Hence, air control includes the control of windwashing&lt;ref&gt;Hens, Hugo S. L. C. ''Performance Based Building Design 2: From Timber-framed Construction to Partition Walls''. Berlin: Ernst, William &amp; Son, 2012. 10. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; (cold air passing through insulation) and convective loops which are air movements within a wall or ceiling that may result in 10% to 20% of the heat loss alone.&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.ornl.gov/sci/buildings/2012/1985%20B3%20papers/055.pdf Harrje, D. T, G. S. Dutt and K. J. Gadsby, "Convective Loop Heat Losses in Buildings". Oak Ridge National Laboratory. 1985. Print.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102121251/http://web.ornl.gov/sci/buildings/2012/1985%20B3%20papers/055.pdf |date=November 2, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The physical components of the envelope include the [[Foundation (architecture)|foundation]], [[roof]], [[wall]]s, [[door]]s, [[window]]s, [[ceiling]], and their related barriers and [[Building insulation|insulation]]. The dimensions, performance and compatibility of materials, fabrication process and details, connections and interactions are the main factors that determine the effectiveness and durability of the building enclosure system.

Common measures of the effectiveness of a building envelope include physical protection from weather and climate (comfort), indoor air quality (hygiene and public health), durability and energy efficiency. In order to achieve these objectives, all building enclosure systems must include a solid structure, a drainage plane, an air barrier, a thermal barrier, and may include a vapor barrier. Moisture control (e.g. [[damp proofing]]) is essential in all climates, but cold climates and hot-humid climates are especially demanding.&lt;ref&gt;Lstiburek, Joseph W., and John Carmody. ''Moisture Control Handbook: Principles and Practices for Residential and Small Commercial Buildings''. New York: Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1993. 88. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Thermal envelope==
The ''thermal envelope'', or heat flow control layer, is part of a building envelope but may be in a different location such as in a ceiling. The difference can be illustrated by understanding that an insulated attic floor is the primary thermal control layer between the inside of the house and the exterior while the entire roof (from the surface of the roofing material to the interior paint finish on the ceiling) comprises the building envelope.&lt;ref&gt;Vliet, Willem. ''The Encyclopedia of Housing''. Thousand Oaks, Calif.: Sage, 1998. 139. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Building envelope [[thermography]] involves using an infrared camera to view temperature anomalies on the interior and exterior surfaces of the structure. Analysis of infrared images can be useful in identifying moisture issues from water intrusion, or [[interstitial condensation]].&lt;ref&gt;Hunaidi, Osama. ''Leak Detection Methods for Plastic Water Distribution Pipes''. Denver, Colo.: AWWA Research Foundation, 1999. 57. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Other types of anomalies that can be detected are thermal bridging, continuity of insulation and air leakage, however this requires a temperature differential between the inside and outside ambient temperatures.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ired.co.uk Faulkner, Ray. ''Infrared Building Surveys''. Portsmouth, United Kingdom: iRed, 2017.]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''butterfly roof''' (sometimes called a '''V roof''' or Aysha roof){{Citation needed|date=March 2018}} is a form of [[roof]] characterised by an inversion of a standard roof form, with two roof surfaces sloping down from opposing edges to a valley near the middle of the roof.&lt;ref&gt;[http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/butterfly+roof The Free Dictionary definition]. Retrieved 2016-04-09&lt;/ref&gt; It is so called because its shape resembles a [[butterfly]]'s wings.&lt;ref name="PSL"&gt;[http://www.palmspringslife.com/Palm-Springs-Life/February-2009/Masters-of-Modernism-The-Butterfly-Effect/ Palm Springs Modernism - The Butterfly Effect, Morris Newman in Palm Springs Life, February 2009]. Retrieved 2016-04-09&lt;/ref&gt;  Butterfly roofs are commonly associated in the USA with 20th century [[mid-century modern]] architecture. They were also commonly used in Georgian and Victorian [[Terraced houses in the United Kingdom|terraced house architecture]] of British cities, where they are alternatively termed "London" roofs. The form has no gutter as rainwater can run off the roof in no more than two locations, at either end of the valley, often into a [[scupper]] or [[downspout]]. The form may be symmetrical, with the valley located in the center, or asymmetrical with an off-center valley.  The valley itself may be flat, with a central [[cricket (roofing)|roof cricket]] diverting water towards the valley ends, or sloping if the entire roof form is tilted towards one end of the valley. The roof also allows for higher perimeter walls, with [[clerestory]] windows allowing light penetration without impacting privacy.&lt;ref name="Curbed"/&gt;

==History==
The modern butterfly roof is commonly credited to be the creation of William Krisel and Dan Palmer in the late 1950s in [[Palm Springs, California]]. It has been estimated that starting in 1957, they created nearly 2,000 houses in a series of developments that were popularly known as the Alexander Tract, which has been described by historian Alan Hess as "the largest Modernist housing subdivision in the United States."&lt;ref name="PSL"/&gt; Krisel confirms that while his work popularized the form, he was not its originator.&lt;ref name="PSL"/&gt; The timeline of the emergence of the butterfly roof:&lt;ref name="Curbed"&gt;[http://www.curbed.com/2014/12/22/10009194/le-corbusiers-forgotten-invention-socals-iconic-butterfly-roof ''Le Corbusier's Forgotten Design: SoCal's Iconic Butterfly Roof'', Marni Epstein-M3rvis in Curbed, December 22, 2014]. Retrieved 2016-04-09&lt;/ref&gt;

* 1930:  [[Le Corbusier]], the Swiss-French architect, first used the butterfly roof form in his design of Maison Errazuriz, a vacation house in Chile.
* 1933:  [[Antonin Raymond]], the Czech-born architect, used this form on a house in Japan, whose design was featured in Architectural Record in 1934.
* 1943:  [[Oscar Niemeyer]] designs and builds the Pampulha Yacht Club, in [[Belo Horizonte]], Brazil, which was widely published.
* 1945:  [[Marcel Breuer]] used this form on his Geller House project in Long Island, New York, USA.
* 1957:  Krisel's first use of the form in Twin Palms neighborhood of Palm Springs, California, USA.

'''Gluteoplasty''' (Greek  ''gloutόs'', '''rump''' + ''plassein'', '''to shape''') denotes the [[plastic surgery]] and the [[liposuction]] procedures for the correction of the [[Congenital defect|congenital]], [[Trauma (medicine)|traumatic]], and acquired defects and deformities of the buttocks and the anatomy of the gluteal region; and for the aesthetic enhancement (by augmentation or by reduction) of the contour of the [[buttocks]].

The corrective procedures for buttcock augmentation and buttcock repair include the [[Surgery|surgical]] emplacement of a '''gluteal implant''' (buttock prosthesis); '''liposculpture''' (fat transfer and [[liposuction]]); and '''body contouring''' (surgery and liposculpture) to resolve the patient’s particular defect or deformity of the gluteal region. Moreover, in the praxis of [[Sexual reassignment surgery male-to-female|sexual reassignment surgery]], the prosthetic and liposculpture augmentation of the buttocks can be performed on [[Transsexualism|transsexual]] and [[transgender]] women to enhance the anatomic curvature of the gluteal region in order to establish the markedly feminine buttocks and hips that project more (to the rear and to the side) than do masculine hips.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

== Background ==
The functional purpose of the '''buttocks musculature''' is to establish a stable [[gait]] (balanced walk) for the man or the woman who requires the surgical correction of either a defect or a deformity of the gluteal region; therefore, the restoration of anatomic functionality is the therapeutic consideration that determines which '''gluteoplasty''' procedure will effectively correct the damaged muscles of the buttocks. The applicable techniques for [[Plastic surgery|surgical]] and correction include the surgical emplacement of gluteal implants; [[Flap (surgery)|autologous tissue-flaps]]; the excision (cutting and removal) of damaged tissues; lipoinjection augmentation; and [[liposuction]] reduction — to resolve the defect or deformity caused by a traumatic injury ([[blunt trauma|blunt]], [[penetrating trauma|penetrating]], [[blast injury|blast]]) to the buttocks muscles ([[gluteus maximus muscle|gluteus maximus]], [[gluteus medius muscle|gluteus medius]], [[Gluteus minimus muscle|gluteus minimus]]), and any deformation of the anatomic contour of the buttocks. Likewise, the corrective techniques apply to resolving the sagging skin of the body, and the muscle and bone deformities presented by the formerly [[Obesity|obese]] patient, after a massive weight loss (MWL) [[bariatric surgery]] procedure; and for resolving [[congenital defects]] and [[congenital deformity|congenital deformities]] of the gluteal region.&lt;ref name=EMedicine1271806&gt;{{EMedicine|article|1271806|Buttocks Contouring}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Surgical anatomy of the buttocks ==
;Muscular origins and insertions
[[Image:Gluteus maximus muscle.PNG|thumb|right|185px|'''Gluteoplasty:''' The surgical anatomy of the gluteus maximus muscle, as considered for a buttock-lift surgery.]]
Anatomically, the mass of each [[buttocks|buttock]] principally comprises two (2) muscles — the [[gluteus maximus muscle]] and the [[gluteus medius muscle]] — which are covered by a layer of [[adipose tissue|adipose body fat]]. The upper aspects of the buttocks end at the [[iliac crest]] (the upper edges of the wings of the [[ilium (bone)|ilium]], and the upper lateral margins of the [[greater pelvis]]), and the lower aspects of the buttocks end at the [[Gluteal sulcus|horizontal gluteal crease]], where the buttocks anatomy joins the rear, upper portion of the thighs. The gluteus maximus muscle has two (2) points of insertion: (i) the one-third (1/3) superior portion of the (coarse line) [[linea aspera]] of the thigh bone ([[femur]]), and (ii) the superior portion of the [[iliotibial tract]] (a long, fibrous reinforcement of the deep [[fascia lata]] of the thigh). The left and the right gluteus maximus muscles (the butt cheeks) are vertically divided by the [[intergluteal cleft]] (the butt-crack) which contains the [[Human anus|anus]].&lt;ref name=EMedicine1271806/&gt;

The [[gluteus maximus muscle]] is a large and very thick muscle (6–7&amp;nbsp;cm) located on the [[sacrum]], which is the large, triangular bone located at the base of the [[vertebral column]], and at the upper- and back-part of the [[pelvic cavity]], where it is inserted (like a wedge) between the two [[hip bone]]s. The upper part of the sacrum is connected to the final [[lumbar vertebrae|lumbar vertebra]] (L5), and to the bottom of the [[coccyx]] (tailbone). At its origin, the gluteus maximus muscle extends to include parts of the [[ilium (bone)|iliac bone]], the sacrum, the coccyx, the sacrosciatic ligament, and the [[tuberosity of the ischium]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Like every pelvic-area muscle, the gluteus maximus muscle originates from the pelvis; nonetheless, it is the sole pelvic muscle not inserted to the [[Human trochanter|trochanter]] (head of the femur), and is approximately aligned to the [[femur]] and the [[fascia lata]] (the [[deep fascia]] of the thigh); the tissues of the gluteus maximus muscle cover only the rear, lateral face of the trochanter, and there form a bursa (purse) that faces the interior of the [[thigh]].&lt;ref name="Gluteoplasty"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gonzalez |first1=Raul |title=Augmentation Gluteoplasty: The XYZ Method |journal=Aesthetic Plastic Surgery |volume=28 |issue=6 |pages=417–25 |year=2004 |pmid=15633021 |doi=10.1007/s00266-004-3130-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Innervation===
The motor innervation of the gluteus maximus muscle is performed by the [[inferior gluteal nerve]] (a branch nerve of the [[sacral plexus]]) and extends from the pelvis to the gluteal region, then traverses the [[greater sciatic foramen]] (opening) from behind and to the middle to then join the [[sciatic nerve]]. The inferior gluteal nerve divides into three (3) collateral branches: (i) the '''gluteus branch''', (ii) the '''perineal branch''', and (iii) the '''femoral branch'''. The first ramification — the gluteus branch — is a branch nerve that is very close to the emergence of the inferior gluteal nerve to the area, next to the inferior border of the [[pyramidalis muscle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Reid |first1=R. W. |title=Motor Points in Relation to the Surface of the Body |journal=Journal of Anatomy |volume=54 |issue=Pt 4 |pages=271–5 |year=1920 |pmid=17103903 |pmc=1262878 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As it arises, the inferior gluteal nerve then divides into four (4) or more '''fillets''' (bands of nerve fibres) that travel (in a crow’s-foot configuration) between the gluteus maximus muscle and its (front) anterior fascia; the thickest nerve-bands are the superior-most and the inferior-most fillets. The superior-most fillet runs almost vertically, near the sacrum, and innervates the superior portion of the gluteus muscle; the inferior-most fillet, which has the greatest calibre, travels very close and parallel to the [[sacrotuberous ligament]]; the inferior-most fillet provides fine-gauge branch-nerve ramifications that innervate the gluteus muscle through its anterior (front) face.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

In surgical and body contouring praxis, the plastic surgeon creates the '''implant-pocket''' — either for the gluteal prosthesis or for the injections of autologous fat — by undermining the gluteus maximus muscle with a dissection technique that avoids the [[sacrum]], the [[sacrotuberous ligament]], and the [[tuberosity of the ischium]]; which, if accidentally cut, might isolate the posterior (back) portion of the muscle and lead to denervation, the loss of nerve function and of innervation.&lt;ref name="Gluteoplasty"/&gt;

===Vascularization===
The [[superior gluteal artery]], the [[inferior gluteal artery]], the [[superior gluteal veins]], and the [[inferior gluteal veins]] irrigate the gluteus maximus muscle with [[arterial blood|arterial]] and [[venous blood|venous]] blood. The vascularization, the entrance of the blood vessels to the muscle tissues, occurs at the anterior (front) face of the muscle, very close to the [[sacrum]]. As the arteries and the veins enter the mass of the gluteal muscle, they divide into narrower blood-vessel ramifications (configured like the horizontal branches of a tree), most of which travel parallel to the muscle fibres.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

In surgical and body contouring praxis, the plastic surgeon effects the implant-pocket undermining of the gluteus maximus muscle by carefully separating the muscle fibres to avoid severing the pertinent blood vessels, which would interfere with the blood irrigation of the muscle tissue. Therefore, to create an implant-pocket, either for a gluteal prosthesis or for lipoinjection, a low-angle muscle-dissection is performed in order to avoid the risk of severing any major branch — [[Superior gluteal artery|superior]] or [[Inferior gluteal artery|inferior]] — of the gluteal artery, which travels very close to the [[sacrum]] and to the [[sacrotuberous ligament]].&lt;ref name="Gluteoplasty"/&gt;

== Surgical procedures ==

===Medical therapy===
The resolution of the defects and deformities of the muscles of the [[gluteal region]] (the buttocks and the thighs) of the human body cannot be realized with medical therapy; thus, for example, a treatment with cellulite-diminishing cream is ineffective for correcting the corresponding physical faults respectively presented by the man and by the woman patient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://milwaukeeplasticsurgery.com/body-procedures/butt-lift-augmentation/ |title=Brazilian Butt Lift |publisher=Dr. Mark Bosbous |access-date=23 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Surgical therapy===
While the resolution of the defects and deformities of the '''gluteal region''' can be realized surgically, the assessment of the degree of severity of the injury organizes treatment therapies into three types: (i) buttocks augmentation,  (ii) buttocks reduction, and (iii) contour irregularity treatments that combine surgery and liposculpture ([[liposuction]] and fat-injection).&lt;ref name=EMedicine1271806/&gt;

===Buttocks augmentation treatments===

====Gluteal implants====
The augmentation of the buttocks is realized with a '''gluteal implant''', which is emplaced under each [[gluteus maximus muscle]]; the insertion of the buttock prosthesis is through a midline incision (5–8-cm-wide) over the tailbone ([[coccyx]]). Augmentation with a gluteal implant is the method most effective for enlarging the buttocks of the man or of the woman whose body possesses few stores of excess [[adipose fat]] in the lower portion of the trunk, the [[buttocks]] and [[thigh]]s, the anatomic regions where the human body usually stores excess body fat. Post-operatively, because of the cutting (incising) into the flesh of the tailbone muscles, the full healing of the augmented tissues can be approximately 6–8 months, in the course of which the gluteal-muscle tissues relax, and the settled buttocks prostheses are integrated to the gluteal region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Flores-Lima |first1=Gerardo |last2=Eppley |first2=Barry L. |title=Body Contouring with Solid Silicone Implants |journal=Aesthetic Plastic Surgery |volume=33 |issue=2 |pages=140–6 |year=2009 |pmid=19123020 |doi=10.1007/s00266-008-9292-x }}&lt;/ref&gt; The implantation procedure can be performed upon a patient who is either [[sedation|sedated]] or [[Anaesthesia|anaesthetized]], either under [[general anaesthesia]] or under [[local anaesthesia]]. The usual operating-room time for a buttocks augmentation procedure is approximately 2 hours. The procedure can be managed either as an overnight in-patient treatment or as a hospital outpatient treatment. Given the nature of the surgical incisions to the gluteus maximus muscles, the therapeutic management of post-surgical pain (at the surgical-wound sites) and normal tissue-healing usually require a 4-6-week convalescence, after which the patient resumes his or her normal-life activities.&lt;ref name=EMedicine1271806/&gt;

====Lipoinjection====
The augmentation and contouring of the buttocks with [[Fat transfer|autologous-fat transfer]] (lipoinjection) therapy is realized with the excess [[Adipose fat|adipose-fat tissue]] harvested from the [[abdomen]], flanks, and [[thigh]]s of the patient. In 1987 Dr. Eduardo Krulig, a Venezuelan Plastic Surgeon describes the technique, using the name "Lipoinjection" for the first time, mentioning the regions of the body where the technique is useful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Krulig |first1=Eduardo |title=Lipo-injection |journal=American Journal of Cosmetic Surgery |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=123–9 |date=April 1987 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The gentle liposuction applied to harvest the autologous fat minimally disturbs the local tissues, especially the [[Connective tissue|connective-tissue layer]] between the skin and the immediate subcutaneous muscle tissues. Then, the harvested fat is injected to the pertinent body area of the gluteal region, through a fine-gauge cannula inserted through a small incision, which produces a short and narrow [[scar]]. Lipoinjection contouring and augmentation with the patient’s own body fat avoids the possibility of tissue rejection, and is physically less invasive than buttocks-implant surgery. Therefore, depending upon the health of the patient, the convalescence period allows him or her to resume daily, normal-life activities at 2-days post-operative, and the full spectrum of physical activity at 2-weeks post-operative. Furthermore, the liposuction harvesting of the patient’s excess body fat improves the aesthetic appearance of the body fat donor-sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rosique |first1=Rodrigo G. |last2=Rosique |first2=Marina J. F. |last3=De Moraes |first3=Carlos Gustavo |title=Gluteoplasty with Autologous Fat Tissue |journal=Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery |volume=135 |issue=5 |pages=1381–9 |year=2015 |pmid=25919253 |doi=10.1097/PRS.0000000000001167 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, [[Physiology|physiologically]], the human body’s normal, health-management chemistry does resorb (break down and eliminate) some of the injected adipose-fat tissue, and so might diminish the augmentation. According to the degree of diminishment of the volume and contour caused by the fat-resorption, the patient might require additional sessions of fat-transfer therapy to achieve the desired size, shape, and contour of the buttocks.&lt;ref name=EMedicine1271806/&gt;

====Body contouring====
The augmentation of the buttocks, by rearranging and enhancing the pertinent muscle and fat tissues of the gluteal region, is realized with a combined gluteoplasty procedure of '''surgery''' (subcutaneous [[Flap (surgery)|dermal-fat flaps]]) and '''liposculpture''' (fat-suction, fat-injection). Therapeutically, such a combined correction-and-enhancement procedure is a realistic and feasible lower-body-lift treatment for the man and for the woman patient who has undergone massive [[weight loss]] (MWL) in the course of resolving [[obesity]] with [[bariatric surgery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sozer |first1=S |last2=Agullo |first2=F |last3=Palladino |first3=H |title=Autologous augmentation gluteoplasty with a dermal fat flap |journal=Aesthetic Surgery Journal |volume=28 |issue=1 |pages=70–6 |year=2008 |pmid=19083509 |doi=10.1016/j.asj.2007.10.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Le Louarn |first1=Claude |last2=Pascal |first2=Jean François |title=Autologous Gluteal Augmentation after Massive Weight Loss |journal=Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery |volume=121 |issue=4 |pages=1515–6; author reply 1516–7 |year=2008 |pmid=18349690 |doi=10.1097/01.prs.0000305369.21408.92 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.drberan.com/procedures/body/butt-augmentation-in-new-york/|title=Butt Augmentation Surgery NYC {{!}} Butt Lift Westchester NY|website=www.drberan.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of the man or woman who presents under-projected, flat buttocks ([[Hypoplasia|gluteal hypoplasia]]), and a degree of gluteal-muscle ptosis (prolapsation, falling forward), wherein neither gluteal-implant surgery nor lipoinjection would be adequate to restoring the natural anatomic contour of the gluteal region, the application of a combined treatment of autologous dermal-fat flap surgery and lipoinjection can achieve the required functional correction and aesthetic contour.&lt;ref name=EMedicine1271806/&gt;

===Buttocks reduction treatments===
The methods for reducing the size of the buttocks include the varieties of [[liposuction]], such as '''lipectomy''' (with and without [[Medical ultrasonography|ultrasonic]] enhancement) to reduce excess body fat, and '''superficial liposculpture''', to reshape, refine, and re-establish the natural contour of the body. The usual buttocks-reduction treatment is lipectomy with applied [[tumescence]] and [[anaesthesia]], wherein the body fat is harvested by aspiration (suction) through a small-gauge cannula (2–4&amp;nbsp;mm) that is inserted through a small incision, either to the [[Intergluteal cleft|intergluteal sulcus]] (the butt-crack), or to the upper area of the [[gluteus maximus muscle]] proper.&lt;ref name=EMedicine1271806/&gt;

====Ultrasonic lipectomy====
Ultrasonically-assisted liposuction can quickly remove a large volume of [[Adipose fat|body fat]] for the correction of a notable occurrence of [[lipodystrophy]], a deposit of adipose fat to the buttocks and related anatomic areas. The [[Medical ultrasonography|ultrasonic]] liposuction machine liquefies the excess fat tissue, and so more readily facilitates its removal with conventional suction-lipectomy. The quick fat-harvesting allowed by the ultrasonic lipectomy technique has eliminated the larger (long and wide) surgical incisions that once were required for removing a large volume of adipose tissue. Nonetheless, because of the sensitivity of the gluteal-region tissues, the skin of the pertinent donor-site is cooled in order to prevent ultrasonic heat damage caused by the liquefying and removal of the excess adipose fat.&lt;ref name=EMedicine1271806/&gt;

====Superficial liposculpture====
Reshaping the buttocks with liposculpture is performed with a small cannula (2&amp;nbsp;mm) specifically for contouring superficial body fat, the configuration of which (number of open ports) is determined by the type and the degree of gluteal correction to be realized. To sculpt rounded contours to square-shaped buttocks muscles, superficial liposculpture allows the plastic surgeon to control the injection-rate of the fat-volume. Moreover, superficial [[liposuction]] can be combined with other treatment methods for contouring the gluteal region to achieve the required functional, anatomic correction, and the aesthetic enhancement sought by the patient, such as reshaping the lateral area of the buttocks into an athletic form.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Centeno |first1=Robert F. |last2=Young |first2=V. Leroy |title=Clinical Anatomy in Aesthetic Gluteal Body Contouring Surgery |journal=Clinics in Plastic Surgery |volume=33 |issue=3 |pages=347–58 |year=2006 |pmid=16818093 |doi=10.1016/j.cps.2006.05.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cuenca-Guerra |first1=Ramon |last2=Lugo-Beltran |first2=Ignacio |title=Beautiful Buttocks: Characteristics and Surgical Techniques |journal=Clinics in Plastic Surgery |volume=33 |issue=3 |pages=321–32 |year=2006 |pmid=16818091 |doi=10.1016/j.cps.2006.04.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The study ''Contouring the Gluteal Region with Tumescent Liposculpture'' (2011) indicated that effective, gluteal-region contouring is best achieved by tailoring the liposuction-reduction and the lipoinjection-augmentation techniques to the anatomic topography of the body areas to be corrected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Avendano-Valenzuela |first1=G. |last2=Guerrerosantos |first2=J. |title=Contouring the Gluteal Region With Tumescent Liposculpture |journal=Aesthetic Surgery Journal |volume=31 |issue=2 |pages=200–13 |year=2011 |pmid=21317118 |doi=10.1177/1090820X10394815 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the study ''Contouring of the Gluteal Region in Women: Enhancement and Augmentation'' (2011) indicated that natural contours of the buttocks and the thighs are effectively achieved with a combined gluteoplasty of selective liposuction and lipoinjection, which reduces the need for aggressive surgical procedures, decreases the risk of medical complications, abbreviates wound-recovery-time, and lessens post-operative scarring. Combined with any buttocks-correction method, superficial liposculpture facilitates the treatment of contour irregularities, the surgical revision of scars, and the correction of gluteal-region contour depressions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ali |first1=Ahmed |title=Contouring of the Gluteal Region in Women |journal=Annals of Plastic Surgery |volume=67 |issue=3 |pages=209–14 |year=2011 |pmid=21587056 |doi=10.1097/SAP.0b013e318206595b }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Surgical technique ==

===Surgical contouring of the gluteal region===

====Pre-operative matters====
To meet the functional requirements and the aesthetic expectations ([[body image]]) of the patient, the plastic surgeon establishes a realistic and feasible surgery plan by which to correct the anatomic contour deficiencies of the gluteal region. The surgeon and the patient determine the location of the surgical-wound [[scar]]s, and determine the best operative position, to allow the proper exposure of the pertinent anatomy to be corrected. Because the surgical procedure requires the [[tumescence]] and [[anaesthesia]] of the gluteal-region area to be corrected, the physician and the [[anaesthesiologist]] determine the volumes of the anaesthetic and [[tumescent]] fluids to be administered to the patient during the procedure, and so avoid the risks of drugs overdose and toxicity.&lt;ref name=EMedicine1271806/&gt;

====Intra-operative matters====
Once the patient is atop the operating table, the surgeon positions him or her to best expose the pertinent gluteal-region area that is to be corrected or contoured, or both; the usual operative position is the prone (face down) position, but the patient can also be positioned laterally (on his or her side). The surgical correction plan can be delineated and marked to the patient’s body when he or she is awake (before sedation or anaesthesia) or it can be delineated when the patient is on the operating table (already [[Sedation|sedated]] or [[Anaesthesia|anaesthetized]]). In operative praxis, the second option allows the plastic surgeon greater freedom to properly manipulate the patient into the position best suited for performing the body-contouring surgery.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

====Operative matters====
Once the patient is in the operative position, the surgeon begins the liposuction correction by making incisions to the marks of the surgical-correction plan, and then infiltrates (injects) a solution of anaesthesia- and tumescence-inducing drugs, usually a combination of [[lidocaine]] and [[epinephrine]]. The volume of the anaesthetic-tumescent solution is gradually infiltrated to the pertinent gluteal area, in order to avoid the nerves and the deeper anatomic structures of the gluteus maximus muscle. The particular anatomic features to be contoured determine the types of cannula (gauge, size, grade) used to effect and control the harvesting of excess adipose fat from the patient’s body.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}

For a lipoinjection augmentation, the surgeon first dissects and prepares the augmentation-pocket to which will be injected the autologous fat-tissue. The surgical creation (muscle dissection) of the augmentation-pocket avoids the gluteal innervation ([[superior gluteal nerve]] and [[inferior gluteal nerve]]) and the vascular system ([[Venous blood|venous]] and [[Arterial blood|arterial]]) of the [[gluteus maximus muscle]]. Afterwards, the surgeon [[Surgical suture|sutures]] the dissection-incision and secures it with adhesive tape to ensure that the augmentation-pocket remains open, as dissected, ready to receive the injections of adipose fat. For the revision of scars, with surgery and injections of autologous fat, or with allopathic synthetic fillers, the surgeon applies subcuticular closures to the incision wounds, which then are bandaged.&lt;ref name=EMedicine1271806/&gt;

====Post-operative matters====
After completing the surgical corrections and the lipoinjection contouring of the pertinent area(s) of the gluteal region, the surgeon thoroughly examines the patient to ensure his or her general recovery from the operation; and examines each surgical incision to ascertain that it is correctly sutured and taped, in order to facilitate the uneventful healing of the gluteus-muscle tissues, without medical complications. The patient is advised to avoid exercise and strenuous physical activity until 3-weeks post-operative; how to properly care for surgical-incision wounds; and how to wear a compression garment that will keep in place the surgically corrected tissues, and so ensure their healing as a whole anatomic unit of the gluteal region.&lt;ref name=EMedicine1271806/&gt;

====Follow-up and convalescence====
The physician advises the patient who has undergone a '''surgical contouring''' of the buttocks with gluteal implants, that, although immediate results can be observed, the final, corrected body contour usually is observed at 6-months post-operative, and at 1-year post-operative, depending upon the tissue-healing capabilities of the patient’s body. The '''liposculpture''' patient usually requires approximately 6 months, and occasionally 1 year before producing the final, corrected body contour. For both procedures, at approximately 1-month post-operative, marked aesthetic improvement is noticeable in the corrected body areas, as is the elimination of the initial, post-operative weight gain caused by the body’s retention of the infiltrated, [[Anaesthesia|anaesthetic]] and [[Tumescence|tumescent]], fluids. The patient is advised to wear a compression garment to contain swelling and to immobilize the corrected tissues, so that they heal as one anatomic unit of the gluteal region. Moreover, throughout the convalescence, to facilitate shrinking the skin to the new, corrected body contour, and to resolve unevenness, wrinkles to the skin, and localized swelling, the continual application of massage and (occasional) ultrasound treatments can facilitate the diminishment of the post-operative conditions.&lt;ref name=EMedicine1271806/&gt;

====Complications====
The surgical and liposculpture contouring of the human body presents possible medical complications such as: the psychological — unmet [[body image]] expectations of aesthetic improvement; the physical — uneven contour, local and general; the physiologic — toxic reactions to the [[Allergic reactions to anaesthesia|anaesthesic]] and the [[tumescence|tumescent]] drugs; and the nervous — [[paresthesia]], localized areas of perduring numbness in the corrected portion(s) of the gluteal region.&lt;ref name=EMedicine1271806/&gt; The medical complications possible to a '''surgical buttocks augmentation''' procedure, the submuscular emplacement of a gluteal implant, include [[infection]], [[Wound dehiscence|surgical-wound dehiscence]] that exposes the implant, revision surgery, rupture of the implant, [[seroma]] (a pocket of clear serous fluid), [[capsular contracture]], asymmetry of the corrected area, shifting of the implant, surgical over-correction, injury to the [[sciatic nerve]], and [[paresthesia]] (tingling skin). The medical complications possible to a '''liposclupture buttocks augmentation''' include the bodily resorption of some of the injected adipose fat, asymmetric contour of the corrected body area, an irregular contour to the body, seroma, [[abscess]] (pus enclosed by inflamed tissue), [[cellulitis]] (subcutaneous connective-tissue inflammation), and paresthesia.&lt;ref name=EMedicine1271806/&gt;

===Dangers===

Like most medical procedures, buttock augmentation come with risks some of which can be life threatening. A total of 413 Mexican plastic surgeons reported 64 deaths related to liposuction, with 13 deaths caused by gluteal lipoinjection. In Colombia, nine deaths were documented. Of the 13 deaths in Mexico, eight (61.6 percent) occurred during lipoinjection, whereas the remaining five (38.4 percent) occurred within the first 24 hours. In Colombia, six deaths (77.7 percent) occurred during surgery and three occurred (22.2 percent) immediately after surgery.[http://journals.lww.com/plasreconsurg/Abstract/2015/07000/Deaths_Caused_by_Gluteal_Lipoinjection___What_Are.11.aspx] Secondary lymphoedema of the lower extremities has been reported as an unusual side effect of liquid silicone injection on the hips and buttock while thromboembolism, implant displacement and explosion has also been listed as some of the dangers.[https://www.karger.com/Article/Abstract/77845][http://www.publichealth.com.ng/six-dangerous-side-effects-of-buttocks-augmentation-and-implants] The surgical and liposculpture contouring of the human body presents possible medical complications such as: the psychological — unmet [[body image]] expectations of aesthetic improvement; the physical — uneven contour, local and general; the physiologic — toxic reactions to the [[Allergic reactions to anaesthesia|anaesthesic]] and the [[tumescence|tumescent]] drugs; and the nervous — [[paresthesia]], localized areas of perduring numbness in the corrected portion(s) of the gluteal region.&lt;ref name=EMedicine1271806/&gt; The medical complications possible to a '''surgical buttocks augmentation''' procedure, the submuscular emplacement of a gluteal implant, include [[infection]], [[Wound dehiscence|surgical-wound dehiscence]] that exposes the implant, revision surgery, rupture of the implant, [[seroma]] (a pocket of clear serous fluid), [[capsular contracture]], asymmetry of the corrected area, shifting of the implant, surgical over-correction, injury to the [[sciatic nerve]], and [[paresthesia]] (tingling skin). The medical complications possible to a '''liposclupture buttocks augmentation''' include the bodily resorption of some of the injected adipose fat, asymmetric contour of the corrected body area, an irregular contour to the body, seroma, [[abscess]] (pus enclosed by inflamed tissue), [[cellulitis]] (subcutaneous connective-tissue inflammation), and paresthesia.&lt;ref name=EMedicine1271806/&gt;

=====Unmet expectations=====
In the surgical praxis of body contouring therapy, the patient’s [[Body image|body-image]] expectations can be different from the contoured body that is the outcome of the performed surgical operation. Such unmet aesthetic expectations can be avoided at the pre-operative consultation stage, whereby, with informed consent, the physician and the patient jointly establish a realistic and feasible surgery plan to achieve a mutually satisfactory corrective outcome (functional and aesthetic) of the operation to the gluteal region, the buttock- and thigh-areas.&lt;ref name=EMedicine1271806/&gt;

=====Contour problems=====
Contour problems of the corrected gluteal region can be prevented with the operational use of small-gauge cannulas (ca. 2.0&amp;nbsp;mm) specifically for superficial liposuction; and with the application of cross-pattern harvesting of the excess body fat, to avoid removing too much [[adipose fat]] tissue, which might disfigure the contour of the patient’s fat-donor area. The possible contour problems that might arise from ultrasonic liposuction are skin burns and hypertrophic scarring, which might occur if the fat-donor area skin is not cooled and protected during the fat harvest. To that end, the infusion of a tumescence-inducing solution to the fat-donor area(s) assists in cooling the patient’s skin during the ultrasonic lipo-harvesting; likewise, the application of moist towels, a skin protector, and the constant cooling-fluid infiltration of the cannula in an integrated sheath.&lt;ref name=EMedicine1271806/&gt;

=====Drug complications (anaesthetic and tumescent)=====
The infiltration of a solution of [[anaesthesia]]- and [[tumescence]]-inducing drugs can present medical complications such as a fluid overload of the tissues, the inadequate replacement of the infiltrated solution, and the partitioning (separation) of a single infiltration into several pools, which then are removed by suction lipectomy. Moreover, during anaesthesia, maintaining the patient’s stable blood pressure can be difficult, which increases the possibility of bleeding, and the possibility that [[Allergic reactions to anaesthesia|anaesthetic toxicity]] can occur if excessive doses are administered by infiltration; the symptoms are manifested as [[central nervous system]] (CNS) occurrences of drug-induced [[anxiety]], apprehension, restlessness, nervousness, disorientation, confusion, dizziness, blurred vision, tremors, [[nausea]], vomiting, shivering, and seizures; likewise, as manifestations of drowsiness, unconsciousness, respiratory depression, and respiratory arrest. Furthermore, the toxicity symptoms of a tumescence-inducing drug (e.g. [[epinephrine]]) might cause such CNS symptoms, for which reason the operative application of a tumescent drug is limited throughout the operation.&lt;ref name=EMedicine1271806/&gt;

=====Numbness (paresthesia)=====
Post-operatively, local areas of numbness ([[paresthesia]]) might occur in the contoured portion(s) of the gluteal region, and might perdure for a long time after the surgery. Hence, the patient is advised to facilitate the re-sensitizing of the numb area(s) with applications of gentle massage, to prevent the development of a [[neuroma]] complication, and to alleviate pain. Nonetheless, depending upon the tissue-healing capabilities of the patient, he or she can recover in full at 2-years post-operative.&lt;ref name=EMedicine1271806/&gt;

===Outcome===
The outcome of a buttocks-contouring procedure depends upon the specific defect or deformity that can be effectively corrected with liposculpture, [[Medical ultrasonography|ultrasonic]] or not. Nonetheless, depressed scars and deep [[Morphology (biology)|morphological]] defects are difficult to correct because of the curvature of the buttocks as an anatomic unit, and because of the scar-contracting elements of the tissues across the gluteal curvature. In such a case, although the injection of (autologous or artificial) tissue fillers to correct the defect or the deformity might be impermanent — it usually will remedy the functional and aesthetic shortcoming(s) required by the patient, which is the therapeutic purpose of gluteoplasty.&lt;ref name=EMedicine1271806/&gt;

'''Conditional text''' is content within a [[document]] that is meant to appear in some renditions of the document, but not other renditions. 

For example, a writer can produce [[Macintosh]] and [[Windows]] versions of the same [[software manual]] by marking Macintosh-specific content as "Macintosh only" and Windows-specific content as "Windows only." Everything that is not marked for one platform or the other, appears in the manuals for both platforms.

'''Continua Health Alliance''' is an international non-profit, open industry group of nearly 240 healthcare providers, communications, medical, and fitness device companies. 
Continua Health Alliance members aim to develop a system to deliver personal and individual healthcare. Continua was a founding member of Personal Connected Health Alliance which was launched in February 2014 with other founding members mHealth SUMMIT and [[Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society|HIMSS]].

==Overview==

Continua Health Alliance is an international not-for-profit industry organization enabling end-to-end, plug-and-play connectivity of devices and services for personal health management and healthcare delivery. Its mission is to empower information-driven health management and facilitate the incorporation of health and wellness into the day-to-day lives of consumers. Continua is a pioneer in establishing industry standards and security for connected health technologies such as smart phones, gateways and remote monitoring devices.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=August 2016}} Its activities include a certification and brand support program, events and collaborations to support technology and clinical innovation, as well as outreach to employers, payers, governments and care providers. With nearly 220 member companies reaching across the globe, Continua comprises technology, medical device and healthcare industry leaders and service providers dedicated to making personal connected health a reality.

Continua Health Alliance is working toward establishing systems of [[interoperable]] telehealth devices and services in three major categories: chronic [[Disease management (health)|disease management]], aging independently, and health and [[physical fitness]].

==Devices and services==

Continua Health Alliance version 1 design guidelines are based on proven connectivity [[technical standard]]s and include [[Bluetooth]] for wireless and [[USB]] for wired device connection. The group released the guidelines to the public in June 2009.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.continuaalliance.org/static/cms_workspace/Continua_Version_One_Design_Guidelines_Now_Available_final.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The group is establishing a [[product certification]] program using its recognizable [[logo]], the Continua Certified Logo program, signifying that the product is interoperable with other Continua-certified products. Products made under Continua Health Alliance guidelines will provide consumers with increased assurance of interoperability between devices, enabling them to more easily share information with caregivers and service providers.

Through collaborations with [[government agencies]] and other regulatory bodies, Continua works to provide guidelines for the effective management of diverse products and services from a global network of vendors. Continua Health Alliance products make use of the [[ISO/IEEE 11073 Personal Health Data (PHD) Standards]].

Continua design guidelines are not available to the public without signing a [[Non-disclosure agreement]]. Continua's guidelines help technology developers build end-to-end, plug-and-play systems more efficiently and cost effectively.

==Milestones==

Continua Health Alliance was founded on June 6, 2006&lt;ref&gt;http://continuaalliance.org/news-and-media/press-releases/founding-continua.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Continua Health alliance performed its first public demonstration of interoperability on October 27, 2008 at the Partners Center for Connected Health 5th Annual Connected Health Symposium in Boston.&lt;ref&gt;http://continuaalliance.org/static/binary/cms_workspace/Continua_Update_release_v_FINAL_2_.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Continua Health Alliance certified its first product, the Nonin 2500 PalmSAT handheld pulse oximeter with USB, on January 26, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nonin.com/News.aspx?NewsID=86&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of December 2014 there are more than 100 certified products.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.continuaalliance.org/products/certified-products.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Continua selected [[Bluetooth Low Energy]] and [[ZigBee]] wireless protocols as the wireless standards for its Version 2 Design Guidelines which have been released. Bluetooth Low Energy is to be used for low-power mobile devices. ZigBee will be used for networked low-power sensors such as those enabling independent living.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.continuaalliance.org/static/cms_workspace/Continua_06082009_vFINAL.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 2012, Continua invites non-members to request a copy of its Design Guidelines after signing a non-disclosure agreement.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.continuaalliance.org/products/design-guidelines.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Course Hero''' is an [[educational technology|education technology]] website company based in [[Redwood City, California]], which operates an online learning platform for students to access course-specific study resources contributed by a community of students and [[educator|educators]]. The [[crowdsourced]] learning platform contains practice problems, study guides, infographics, class notes, step-by-step explanations, essays, lab reports, videos, user-submitted questions paired with answers from tutors, and original materials created and uploaded by educators. Users either buy a subscription or upload original documents to receive unlocks that are used to view and download full Course Hero documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://pando.com/2012/05/10/course-hero-a-diy-education-startup-is-now-paying-students/|title=Course Hero, a DIY Education Startup, Is Now Paying Students*|date=2012-05-10|work=Pando|access-date=2018-06-09|language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Course Hero was founded by Andrew Grauer at Cornell University in 2006 for college students to share lectures, class notes, exams and assignments that usually went ignored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Leiber|first=Nick|title=2011 Finalists: America's Best Young Entrepreneurs|url=https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB123923520520403259|newspaper=BloombergBusinessweek|date=20 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He believed that information is valuable and can be even more useful if properly indexed and accessible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Chaker|first=Anne M.|title=Do Study Sites Make the Grade?|url=https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB123923520520403259|newspaper=Wall Street Journal|date=9 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The full website was launched in 2008 and the company is based in Redwood City, California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Course Hero: Crunchbase|url=http://www.crunchbase.com/organization/course-hero}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2014, the company raised $15 million in Series A Funding, with investors that included GSV Capital and IDG Capital. Seed investors SV Angel and Maveron also participated.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/news/2014/11/12/course-hero-raises-15m-for-crowd-sourced-study.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Features ==

===Study Documents===
In 2012 it was asserted that Course Hero provided access to over 7 million uploaded study documents. Students pay a monthly subscription to have immediate Premier Access to Course Hero or they can upload 40 documents to receive free access for a month. When a user has uploaded 40 documents, they can download up to 300 documents from Course Hero. However, it takes about three days to get Premier Access after submitting documents. User can search for documents by content, university or course subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Marty|first=Jerome|title=Course Hero Crowdsources Study Material From 2 Million Students|url=http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/224228|newspaper=Entrepreneur|date=3 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A philanthropic initiative called the Course Hero Knowledge Drive was introduced in September 2010 in which one book is donated to [[Books for Africa]] for every 10 study documents uploaded to the website. Since its inception, the Course Hero Knowledge Drive has donated over 200,000 books to students and schools abroad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = Course Hero Surpasses 200,000 Books Donated to Gambian Schools|url = https://www.booksforafrica.org/news/course-hero-surpasses-200000-books-donated-to-gambian-schools.html|newspaper = Books For Africa|date = 9 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tutoring Services===
Course Hero offers 24/7 access to online tutors. They can ask any question about a subject and a tutor will respond within 3 days. This access is charged per use via "credits" for Premier Users, but basic subscribers have to pay per question.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}

===Courses===
On April 17, 2012, Course Hero launched 22 free online courses in three "learning paths": Entrepreneurship, Business, and Web Programming. These courses use aggregated educational content from the web and consistently test students until they master their subject. Each course breaks down into roughly 6 sections, teaching a combination of videos and articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Constantine|first=Josh|title=Screw University, Course Hero Curates YouTube Into Free Business and Coding Classes|url=https://techcrunch.com/2012/04/12/course-hero/|newspaper=TechCrunch|date=12 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 7, 2012, Course Hero added a further 18 free skill-based courses to their catalog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Farr|first=Christina|title=Professors out, experts in! Course Hero adds 18 free skill-based courses|url=https://venturebeat.com/2012/08/07/course-hero-adds-18-courses/|newspaper=VentureBeat|date=7 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Course Hero also rewards students who complete 5 or more in either three offered learning paths. Prizes include the opportunity to pitch a business plan to SV Angel and $5,000 or a chance to get a job at Course Hero.

===Video Lectures and Educator Platform===
This is where educators can openly share knowledge and content through Course Hero&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://techcrunch.com/2012/04/12/course-hero/|title=Screw University, Course Hero Curates YouTube Into Free Business and Coding Classes|last=Constine|first=Josh|work=TechCrunch|access-date=2017-09-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;. You can search through a library of video lectures by university, subject or instructor. This part of the website also offers a free directory of digital courses that are available on the Internet.{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}

==Controversy==

===Copyright concerns===
The documents uploaded for sale are frequently the intellectual property of instructors, not of the students who post them/sell them. This includes exams and their keys, quizzes and their keys, study guides written by instructors.  To protect the rights of the copyright holders, the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] requires Course Hero to expeditiously remove content when it is flagged as infringing its copyright. However, the process to remove copyrighted material can be seen as overly burdensome and may be a subtle way to discourage people from following through on such claims.

===Cheating===
As Course Hero allows students to post previous homework and exam solutions from their classes, the website is often cited as an aid to student cheating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Foderaro|first=Lisa W.|title=Psst! Need the Answer to No. 7? Click Here.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/18/education/18cram.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=17 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is some debate about whether faculty who reuse the same homework/exams bear some of the blame, but websites like Course Hero are viewed as not necessarily blameless in the controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Young|first=Jeffrey R.|title=High-Tech Cheating Abounds, and Professors Bear Some Blame|url=http://chronicle.com/article/High-Tech-Cheating-on-Homework/64857/|newspaper=The Chronicle of Higher Education|date=28 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1743">A '''cruise ship ID card''' is a plastic card the size of a [[credit card]] that serves several functions for passengers on a [[cruise ship]]. Cruise ship ID cards are scanned at the entrances to the ship and at various points throughout the ship, either via [[magnetic strip]], RFID readers or [[bar code]] in order to identify the passenger, allow entry to and exit off the ship, allow entry into certain areas of the ship, including the passenger's cabin, bill purchases to the passenger, and various other functions.

==Information printed on card==
The information printed on the ship card may include:
* Name of cruise company
* Name of ship
* Dates of voyage
* Name of passenger
* Dining assignment
* [[Muster station]]

It is now rare for a picture of the passenger to be displayed on the card, but it is frequently scanned in the presence of a computer that will display a picture of the passenger on the screen.

==Functions==
Functions of a ship card may include:
* Access to ship (boarding and disembarkation at ports) - required by security at many ports to enter port, and required to exit ship&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Cruise Ship Tourism|author=Dowling, R.K.|date=2006|publisher=CABI|isbn=9781845930493|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gZ3_28wi_UkC|page=429|accessdate=2015-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Cabin door key
* Onboard charge account - since most cruise lines use a cashless system on board, the card is used to make purchases on the ship that are billed to the passenger at the end of the voyage
* Basic passenger information

[[Image:Accuracy of Navigation Systems.svg|300px|thumb]]
[[Image:Decca Navigator Mk 12.jpg|thumb|300px|The display head, or "decometer bowl", of a Decca Navigator Mk 12 (ca. 1962).  Not shown is the much larger receiver unit.]]
The '''Decca Navigator System''' was a [[hyperbolic navigation|hyperbolic]] [[radio navigation]] system which allowed ships and aircraft to determine their position by receiving radio signals from fixed navigational beacons. The system used phase comparison of two [[low frequency]] signals between 70 and 129 [[kilohertz|kHz]], as opposed to pulse timing systems like [[Gee (navigation)|Gee]] and [[LORAN]]. This made it much easier to implement the receivers using 1940s electronics, eliminating the need for a [[cathode ray tube]].

The system was invented in the US, but development was carried out by [[Decca Records|Decca]] in the UK. It was first deployed by the [[Royal Navy]] during [[World War II]] when the Allied forces needed a system which could be used to achieve accurate landings and was not known to the Germans and thus free of jamming. After the war, it was extensively developed around the UK and later used in many areas around the world. Decca's primary use was for ship navigation in coastal waters, offering much better accuracy than the competing LORAN system. Fishing vessels were major post-war users, but it was also used on aircraft, including a very early (1949) application of [[moving map display]]s. The system was deployed extensively in the [[North Sea]] and was used by helicopters operating to [[oil platform]]s.

The opening of the more accurate [[Loran-C]] system to civilian use in 1974 offered stiff competition, but Decca was well established by this time and continued operations into the 1990s. Decca was eventually replaced, along with Loran and similar systems, by the [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] during the 1990s. The Decca system in Europe was shut down in the spring of 2000, and the last worldwide chain, in Japan, in 2001.

== Principles of Operation ==
=== Overview ===
[[Image:Crude loran diagram.PNG|thumb|right|''The Decca Navigator principle.'' &lt;br&gt; The phase difference between the signals received from stations A (Master) and B (Slave) is constant along each hyperbolic curve. The foci of the hyperbola are at the transmitting stations, A and B.]]

The Decca Navigator System consisted of a number of land-based radio beacons organised into ''chains''. Each chain consisted of a [[master station]] and three (occasionally two) secondary stations, termed Red, Green and Purple. Ideally, the secondaries would be positioned at the vertices of an equilateral triangle with the master at the centre. The baseline length, that is, the master-secondary distance, was typically {{convert|60-120|nmi|km}}.

Each station transmitted a continuous wave signal that, by comparing the [[phase (waves)|phase]] difference of the signals from the master and one of the secondaries, resulted in a set of hyperbolic ''[[lines of position]]'' called a ''pattern''. As there were three secondaries there were three patterns, termed Red, Green and Purple. The patterns were drawn on nautical charts as a set of hyperbolic lines in the appropriate colour. Receivers identified which [[hyperbola]] they were on and a position could be plotted at the intersection of the [[hyperbola]] from different patterns, usually by using the pair with the angle of cut closest to orthogonal as possible.

=== Detailed Principles of Operation ===
When two stations transmit at the  [[phase-locked loop|phase-locked frequency]], the difference in phase between the two signals is constant along a hyperbolic path. Of course, if two stations transmit on the same frequency, it is practically impossible for the receiver to separate them; so instead of all stations transmitting at the same frequency, each chain was allocated a nominal frequency, 1f, and each station in the chain transmitted at a harmonic of this base frequency, as follows:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Station!! Harmonic !! Frequency (kHz)
|-
| Master || 6f || 85.000
|-
| Purple || 5f || 70.833
|-
| Red || 8f || 113.333
|-
| Green || 9f || 127.500
|}

The frequencies given are those for Chain 5B, known as the English Chain, but all chains used similar frequencies between 70&amp;nbsp;kHz and 129&amp;nbsp;kHz.

Decca receivers multiplied the signals received from the Master and each Slave by different values to arrive at a common frequency ([[least common multiple]], LCM) for each Master/Slave pair, as follows:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Pattern !! Slave Harmonic !! Slave Multiplier !! Master Harmonic !! Master Multiplier !! Common Frequency
|-
| Purple || 5f || ×6 || 6f || ×5 || 30f
|-
| Red || 8f || ×3 || 6f || ×4 || 24f
|-
| Green || 9f || ×2 || 6f || ×3 || 18f
|}

It was phase comparison at this common frequency that resulted in the hyperbolic lines of position. The interval between two adjacent hyperbolas on which the signals are in phase was called a ''lane''. Since the wavelength of the common frequency was small compared with the distance between the Master and Slave stations there were many possible lines of position for a given phase difference, and so a unique position could not be arrived at by this method.

Other receivers, typically for aeronautical applications, divided the transmitted frequencies down to the basic frequency (1f) for phase comparison, rather than multiplying them up to the LCM frequency.

=== Lanes and Zones ===
Early Decca receivers were fitted with three rotating ''Decometers'' that indicated the phase difference for each pattern. Each Decometer drove a second indicator that counted the number of lanes traversed &amp;ndash; each 360 degrees of phase difference was one lane traversed. In this way, assuming the point of departure was known, a more or less distinct location could be identified.

The lanes were grouped into ''zones'', with 18 green, 24 red, or 30 purple lanes in each zone. This meant that on the baseline (the straight line between the Master and its Slave) the zone width was the same for all three patterns of a given chain. Typical lane and zone widths on the baseline are shown in the table below (for chain 5B):

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Lane or Zone!! Width on Baseline
|-
| Purple lane || 352.1 m
|-
| Red lane || 440.1 m
|-
| Green lane || 586.8 m
|-
| Zones (all patterns)|| 10563 m
|}

The lanes were numbered 0 to 23 for red, 30 to 47 for green and 50 to 79 for purple. The zones were labelled A to J, repeating after J. A Decca position coordinate could thus be written: Red I 16.30; Green D 35.80. Later receivers incorporated a microprocessor and displayed a position in latitude and longitude.

=== Multipulse ===
''Multipulse'' provided an automatic method of lane and zone identification by using the same phase comparison techniques described above on lower frequency signals.

The nominally continuous wave transmissions were in fact divided into a 20-second cycle, with each station in turn simultaneously transmitting all four Decca frequencies (5f, 6f, 8f and 9f) in a phase-coherent relationship for a brief period of 0.45 seconds each cycle. This transmission, known as Multipulse, allowed the receiver to extract the 1f frequency and so to identify which lane the receiver was in (to a resolution of a zone).

As well as transmitting the Decca frequencies of 5f, 6f, 8f and 9f, an 8.2f signal, known as Orange, was also transmitted. The beat frequency between the 8.0f (Red) and 8.2f (Orange) signals allowed a 0.2f signal to be derived and so resulted in a hyperbolic pattern in which one cycle (360°) of phase difference equates to 5 zones.

Assuming that one’s position was known to this accuracy, this gave an effectively unique position.

=== Range and Accuracy ===
During daylight, ranges of around {{convert|400|nmi|km|-1}} could be obtained, reducing at night to 200 to {{convert|250|nmi|km|-1}}, depending on propagation conditions.

The accuracy depended on:
* Width of the lanes
* Angle of cut of the hyperbolic lines of position
* Instrumental errors
* Propagation errors (for example, [[Skywave]])

By day these errors could range from a few meters on the baseline up to a nautical mile at the edge of coverage. At night, skywave errors were greater and, on receivers without multipulse capabilities, it was not unusual for the position to jump a lane, sometimes without the navigator knowing.

Although in the days of differential [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] this range and accuracy may appear poor, in its day the Decca system was one of the few, if not the only, position fixing system available to many mariners. Since the need for an accurate position is less when the vessel is further from land, the reduced accuracy at long ranges was not a great problem.

== History==
=== Origins===
In 1936 William J. O'Brien, an engineer, contracted [[tuberculosis]] which put his career on hold for a period of two years. During this period he had the idea of position fixing by means of phase comparison of continuous wave transmissions. This was not the first such system, but O'Brien apparently developed his version without knowledge of the others, and made several advancements in the art that would prove useful. He initially imagined the system being used for aircraft testing, specifically the accurate calculation of ground speed. Some experiments were carried out in California in 1938, selecting frequencies with harmonic "beats" that would allow for station identification in a network of transmitters. Both the [[US Army]] and [[US Navy|Navy]] considered the idea too complicated and work ended in 1939.{{sfn|Blanchard|1991|p=301}}

O’Brien's friend, Harvey F. Schwarz, was chief engineer of the [[Decca Records|Decca Record company]] in England. In 1939 O’Brien sent him details of the system so it could be put forward to the British military. Initially [[Robert Watson-Watt]] reviewed the system but he did not follow it up, deeming it too easily jammed (and likely due to the existing work on the [[Gee (navigation)|Gee]] system, being carried out by Watt's group).{{sfn|Blanchard|1991|p=302}} However, in October 1941 the British Admiralty Signal Establishment (ASE) became interested in the system, which was then classified as ''Admiralty Outfit QM''. O’Brien brought the Californian equipment to the UK and conducted the first marine trials between [[Anglesey]] and the [[Isle of Man]], at frequencies of 305/610&amp;nbsp;kHz, on 16 September 1942.{{sfn|Blanchard|1991|p=301}}

Further trials were conducted in the northern [[Irish Sea]] in April 1943 at 70/130&amp;nbsp;kHz. It was decided that the original frequencies were not ideal, and a new system using a 14&amp;nbsp;kHz inter-signal spacing was selected. This led to the common 5, 6, 8 and 9''f'' frequencies, used throughout the life of the Decca system. 7''f'' was reserved for a [[Loran-C]]-like extension, but never developed.{{sfn|Blanchard|1991|p=302}}  A follow-up test was carried out in the [[Irish Sea]] in January 1944 to test a wide variety of upgrades and production equipment. By this time the competing Gee system was known to the Admiralty and the two systems were tested head-to-head under the code names QM and QH. QM was found to have better sea-level range and accuracy, which led to its adoption.{{sfn|Blanchard|1991|p=302}}

A three-station trial was held in conjunction with a large-scale assault and landing exercise in the [[Moray Firth]] in February/March 1944. The success of the trials and the relative ease of use and accuracy of the system resulted in Decca receiving an order for 27 ''Admiralty Outfit QM'' receivers. The receiver consisted of an electronics unit with two dials and was known to its operators as the "Blue Gasmeter Job". A Decca chain was set up, consisting of a master station at [[Chichester]] and slaves at [[Swanage]] and [[Beachy Head]]. A fourth decoy transmitter was located in the [[Thames Estuary]] as part of the deception that the invasion would be focussed on the [[Calais]] area.

21 minesweepers and other vessels were fitted with ''Admiralty Outfit QM'' and, on 5 June 1944, 17 of these ships used it to accurately navigate across the [[English Channel]] and to sweep the minefields in the planned areas. The swept areas were marked with buoys in preparation for the [[Normandy Landings]].

After the initial ship tests, Decca conducted tests in cars, driving in the [[A3 road|Kingston By-Pass]] area to verify receiver accuracy. In the car installation, it was found possible to navigate within an individual traffic lane. The company entertained high hopes that the system could be used in aircraft, to permit much more precise navigation in the critical airspace around airports and urban centres where traffic density was highest.

=== Deployment ===
After the end of [[World War II]] the Decca Navigator Co. Ltd. was formed (1945) and the system expanded rapidly, particularly in areas of [[British Empire|British influence]]; at its peak it was deployed in many of the world's major shipping areas. More than 15,000 receiving sets were in use aboard ships in 1970. There were 4 chains around England, 1 in Ireland and 2 in Scotland, 12 in Scandinavia (5 each in Norway and Sweden and 1 each in Denmark and Finland), a further 4 elsewhere in northern Europe and 2 in Spain.

In the late 1950s an experimental Decca chain was set up in the United States, in the New York area, to be used for navigating the [[Boeing Vertol CH-46 Sea Knight|Vertol 107]] helicopters of [[New York Airways]]. These helicopters were operating from the principal local airports—[[John F. Kennedy International Airport|Idlewild Airport]] on Long Island, [[Newark Liberty International Airport|Newark Airport]] in New Jersey, [[LaGuardia Airport]] in the Borough of Queens, nearer to Manhattan, and a site on the top of the (then) [[MetLife Building|PanAm Building]] on Park Avenue. Use of Decca was essential because its signals could be received down to sea level, were not subject to the line-of-sight limitations of [[VHF omnidirectional range|VOR]]/[[Distance measuring equipment|DME]] and did not suffer the slant-range errors that create problems with VOR/DME close to the transmitters. The Decca installations in the New York Airways helicopters included the unique Decca 'roller map' displays that enabled the pilot to see his or her position at a glance, a concept infeasible with VOR/DME.

This chain installation was considered highly controversial at the time, for political reasons. This led to the U.S. Coast Guard, under instructions from the Treasury Department to which it reported, banning the use of Decca receivers in ships entering New York harbour for fear that the system might create a de facto standard (as it had become in other areas of the world). It also served to protect the marketing interests of the Hoffman Electronics division of ITT, a principal supplier of VOR/DME systems, that Decca might have been poised to usurp.

This situation was exacerbated by the workload problems of the Air Traffic Controllers Association (ATCA), under its executive director Francis McDermott, whose members were forced to use radar data on aircraft positions, relaying those positions by radio to the aircraft from their control locations. An example of the problem, cited by experts, was the [[1960 New York mid-air collision|collision of a Douglas DC8 and a Lockheed Constellation over Staten Island, New York]],&lt;ref&gt;http://specialcollection.dotlibrary.dot.gov/Document?db=DOT-AIRPLANEACCIDENTS&amp;query=(select+719)&lt;/ref&gt; that—according to some experts—could have been avoided if the aircraft had been Decca-equipped and could not only have determined their positions more precisely but would not have suffered from the rho-theta position errors inherent in VOR/DME.

Other chains were established in Japan (6 chains); Namibia and South Africa (5 chains); India and Bangladesh (4 chains); Canada (4 chains around [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] and [[Nova Scotia]]); North-West Australia (2 chains); the [[Persian Gulf]] (1 chain with stations in Qatar and the United Arab Emirates and a second chain in the north of the Gulf with stations in Iran) and the Bahamas (1 chain). Four chains were planned for Nigeria but only two were built and these did not enter into public service. Two chains in Vietnam were used during the [[Vietnam War]] for helicopter navigation, with limited success.
During the Cold War period, following WWII, the R.A.F. established a confidential chain in Germany. The Master station was in [[Bad Iburg]] near Osnabrück and there were two Slaves. The purpose of this chain was to provide accurate air navigation for the corridor between Western Germany and Berlin in the event that a mass evacuation of allied personnel may be required. In order to maintain secrecy, frequencies were changed at irregular intervals.

=== Decca, Racal, and the closedown ===
[[Image:Decca Navigator Mk 21.jpg|thumb|Decca Navigator Mk. 21, with the Decometer dials prominent.]]
[[File:Decca Receiver Philips.jpg|thumb|An ''ap'' Decca receiver Mk II from the 1980s which could be purchased instead of leased. It could store 25 waypoints.]]

The headquarters of Decca Navigator were at New Malden, Surrey, just off the Kingston by-pass. There was a Decca School, at [[Brixham]], [[Devon]], where employees were sent on courses from time to time. [[Racal]], the UK weapons and communications company, acquired Decca in 1980. Merging Decca's radar assets with their own, Racal began selling off the other portions of the company, including avionics and Decca Navigator.

A significant amount of income from the Decca system was due to the receivers being leased to users, not sold outright. This guaranteed predictable annual income. When the patents on the original technology lapsed in the early 1980s, new receivers were quickly built by a number of companies. In particular, Aktieselskabet Dansk Philips ('Danish Philips', ''ap'') introduced receivers that could be purchased outright, and were much smaller and easier to use than the current Decca counterparts. The "ap" versions directly output the longitude and latitude to two decimals  (originally in datum [[ED50]] only) instead of using the "deco meter" displays, offering accuracy better than ±9.3 m, much better than the Decca units. This also eliminated the need for the special charts printed with Decca lanes and zones.

Decca sued ap for infringement and, in the ensuing court battle, Decca lost the monopoly. That signalled the beginning of the end for the company. Income dwindled and eventually, the UK [[Department for Transport|Ministry of Transport]] stepped in, having the [[Trinity House|lighthouse authorities]] take responsibility for operating the system in the early 1990s.

A ruling from the European Union forced the UK government to withdraw funding. The [[general lighthouse authority]] ceased Decca transmissions at midnight on 31 March 2000. The Irish chain provided by [[Bord Iascaigh Mhara|Bórd Iascaigh Mhara]] continued transmitting until 19 May 2000. Japan continued operating their [[Hokkaidō]] chain until March 2001, the last Decca chain in operation.

== Other applications ==

=== Delrac ===
In the immediate post-war era, Decca began studying a long-range system like Decca, but using much lower frequencies to enable reception of [[skywave]]s at long distances. In February 1946 the company proposed a system with two main stations located at [[Shannon Airport]] in Ireland and [[Gander International Airport]] in [[Newfoundland]] (today part of Canada). Together, these stations would provide navigation over the main [[great circle route]] between London and New York. A third station in [[Bermuda]] would provide general ranging information to measure progress along the main track.{{sfn|Blanchard|1991|p=303}}

Work on this concept continued, and in 1951 a modified version was presented that offered navigation over very wide areas. This was known as '''Delrac''', short for "Decca Long Range Area Cover". A further development, including features of the [[General Post Office]]'s [[POPI]] system, was introduced in 1954, proposing 28 stations that provided worldwide coverage.{{sfn|Blanchard|1991|p=303}} The system was predicted to offer {{convert|10|mile|m}} accuracy at {{convert|2000|mile|km}} range 95% of the time. Further development was ended in favour of the Dectra system.{{sfn|Blanchard|1991|p=304}}

=== Dectra ===
In the early 1960s the [[Radio Technical Commission for Aeronautics]] (RTCA), as part of a wider [[ICAO]] effort, began the process of introducing a standard long-range radio navigation system for aviation use. Decca proposed a system that could offer both high-accuracy at short ranges and trans-Atlantic navigation with less accuracy, using a single receiver. The system was known as '''Dectra''', short for "Decca Track".{{sfn|Blanchard|1991|p=304}}

Unlike the Delrac system, Dectra was essentially the normal Decca Navigator system with the modification of several existing transmitter sites.{{sfn|Blanchard|1991|p=304}} These were located at the East Newfoundland and Scottish chains, which were equipped with larger antennas and high-power transmitters, broadcasting 20 times as much energy as normal chain stations. Given that the length of the chain baselines did not change, and were relatively short, at long distance the signal offered almost no accuracy. Instead, Dectra operated as a track system;  aircraft would navigate by keeping themselves within the signal defined by a particular Decca lane.{{sfn|Blanchard|1991|p=305}}

The main advantage of Dectra compared to other systems being proposed for the RTCA solution was that it could be used for both medium-range navigation over land, as well as long-range navigation over the Altlantic. In comparison, the [[VOR/DME]] system that ultimately won the competition offered navigation over perhaps a 200&amp;nbsp;mile radius, and could not offer a solution to the long-distance problem.{{sfn|Blanchard|1991|p=305}} Additionally, as the Decca system provided an X and Y location, as opposed to the angle-and-range VOR/DME, Decca proposed offering it with their Decca Flight Log moving map display to further improve ease of navigation. In spite of these advantages, the RTCA ultimately chose VOR/DME for two primary reasons; VOR offered coverage over about the same range as Decca, about 200&amp;nbsp;miles, but did so with a single transmitter instead of Decca's four, and Decca's frequencies proved susceptible to interference from static due to lightning, while VOR's higher frequencies were not quite as sensitive.{{sfn|Blanchard|1991|p=303}}

Decca continued to propose that Dectra be used for the long-range role. In 1967 they installed another transmitter in Iceland to provide ranging along the Scotland-Newfoundland track, with a second proposed to be installed on the [[Azores]]. They also installed Dectra receivers with Omnitrac computers and a lightweight version of the Flight Log on a number of commercial airliners, notably a [[BOAC]] [[Vickers VC10]]. The Omnitrac could take inputs from Decca (and Dectra), Loran-C, VOR/DME, an air data computer and doppler radars and combine them all to produce a lat/long output along with bearing, distance-to-go, bearing and an autopilot coupling.&lt;ref&gt;"Dectra in Iceland", Decca Navigator News, October 1967&lt;/ref&gt; Their efforts to standardize this were eventually abandoned as [[inertial navigation system]]s began to be installed for these needs.{{sfn|Blanchard|1991|p=305}}

===Hi-Fix===
A more accurate system named Hi-Fix was developed using signalling in the 1.6&amp;nbsp;MHz range. It was used for specialised applications such as precision measurements involved with oil-drilling and by the [[Royal Navy]] for detailed mapping and surveying of coasts and harbours. The Hi-Fix equipment was leased for a period with temporary chains established to provide coverage of the area required, Hi-Fix was commercialised by Racal Survey in the early 1980s. An experimental chain was installed with coverage of central London and receivers placed in London buses and other vehicles to demonstrate an early vehicle location and tracking system. Each vehicle would report its location automatically via a conventional VHF two-way radio link, the data added to a voice channel.

Another application was developed by the Bendix Pacific division of Bendix Corporation, with offices in North Hollywood, California, but not deployed: PFNS—Personal Field Navigation System—that would enable individual soldiers to ascertain their geographic position, long before this capability was made possible by the satellite-based GPS (Global Positioning System).

A further application of the Decca system was implemented by the U.S. Navy in the late 1950s and early 1960s for use in the Tongue of the Ocean/Eleuthera Sound area near The Bahamas, separating the islands of Andros and New Providence. The application was for sonar studies made possible by the unique characteristics of the ocean floor.

An interesting characteristic of the Decca VLF signal discovered on BOAC, later British Airways, test flights to Moscow, was that the carrier switching could not be detected even though the carrier could be received with sufficient strength to provide navigation.{{clarify|date=March 2014}} Such testing, involving civilian aircraft, is quite common and may well not be in the knowledge of a pilot.

The 'low frequency' signalling of the Decca system also permitted its use on submarines. One 'enhancement' of the Decca system was to offer the potential of keying the signal, using Morse code, to signal the onset of nuclear war. This option was never taken up by the UK government. Messages were clandestinely sent, however, between Decca stations thereby bypassing international telephone calls, especially in non-UK chains.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2832">'''Design for Verification''' ('''DfV''') is a set of engineering guidelines to aid designers in ensuring right first time manufacturing and assembly of large-scale components. The guidelines were developed as a tool to inform and direct designers during early stage design phases to trade off estimated measurement uncertainty against [[Engineering tolerance|tolerance]], cost, [[Manufacturing|assembly]], measurability and product requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212827116310095|title=Design for Verification The 9th International Conference on Digital Enterprise Technology – Intelligent Manufacturing in the Knowledge Economy Era | doi=10.1016/j.procir.2016.10.017 | volume=56|journal=Procedia CIRP|pages=61–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Increased competition in the aerospace market has placed additional demands on aerospace manufacturers to reduce costs, increase product flexibility and improve manufacturing efficiency. There is a knowledge gap within the sphere of digital to physical dimensional verification and on how to successfully achieve dimensional specifications within real-world assembly factories that are subject to varying environmental conditions. The '''DfV''' framework is an engineering principle to be used within low rate and high value and complexity manufacturing industries to aid in achieving high productivity in assembly via the effective dimensional verification of large volume structures, during final assembly. The '''DfV''' framework has been developed to enable engineers to design and plan the effective dimensional verification of large volume, complex structures in order to reduce failure rates and end-product costs, improve process integrity and efficiency, optimise metrology processes, decrease tooling redundancy and increase product quality and conformance to specification. The theoretical elements of the '''DfV''' methods were published in 2016, together with their testing using industrial case studies of representative complexity. The industrial tests published on [[ScienceDirect]] proved that by using the new Design for Verification methods alongside the traditional ‘[[Design for X]]’ toolbox, the resultant process achieved improved tolerance analysis and synthesis, optimized large volume metrology and assembly processes and more cost effective tool and jig design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2212827116310095|title=Design for Verification (DfV) | doi=10.1016/j.procir.2016.10.017 | volume=56|journal=Procedia CIRP|pages=61–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''DockNET''' is an intelligent control system for [[cargo]] handling developed by Portsystem in [[Sweden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.portsystem.com/it-system/|title=About: DockNET|accessdate=October 14, 2011|publisher=Portsystem}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The control system was created for being able to analyze, communicate, supervise, direct, record and to document everything that happens in and around a loading door hole in a modern cargo terminal. Cargo terminals often suffer damage to loading houses and vehicles incurred in connection with drive into and away from the loading house. This is usually not just mistake out of the driver, but lack of communication between driver and loading dock. DockNET solves this lack of communication and secures while running the work environment and cargo handling. The result is increased efficiency where technology makes everything measurable around the loading space.

[[Vincent Lamberti]] was granted the original patents related to the manufacturing of Dove in the 1950s, while he worked for the Lever brothers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Levin|first=Jay|title=Farewell to the father of Dove soap: Researcher Vincent Lamberti, 86, of Upper Saddle River, dies|url=http://www.northjersey.com/news/farewell-to-the-father-of-dove-soap-researcher-vincent-lamberti-86-of-upper-saddle-river-dies-1.841570|work=NorthJersey.com|accessdate=18 July 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160930101234/http://www.northjersey.com/news/farewell-to-the-father-of-dove-soap-researcher-vincent-lamberti-86-of-upper-saddle-river-dies-1.841570|archivedate=30 September 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Products include: antiperspirants/deodorants, body washes, beauty bars, lotions/moisturizers, hair care, and facial care products. Dove is primarily made from synthetic [[surfactant]]s, vegetable oils (such as palm kernel) and salts of animal fats (tallow). In some countries, Dove is derived from [[tallow]], and for this reason it is not considered [[vegan]], unlike [[Vegetarian soap|vegetable oil based soaps]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unilever.com/PIOTI/EN/p4.asp?selectCountry=UK&amp;language=EN&amp;productid=3053409 Product information on the internet]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vegetarian-restaurants.net/OtherInfo/Vegetarian-Newsletter-2.htm http://www.thepetitionsite.com/takeaction/737024543&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dove Campaign for Real Beauty ==
{{Main|Dove Campaign for Real Beauty}}
In 2004, Dove began its [[Dove Campaign for Real Beauty|Campaign for Real Beauty]], followed by the creation of the Dove Self-Esteem Fund in 2006, by Geyner Andres Gaona and ''Amy''. The campaign has been criticized as hypocritical in light of the highly sexualized images of women presented in the advertising of [[Axe (brand)|Axe]], which like Dove is produced by Unilever.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kurtzleben|first=Danielle|title=Do Dove and Axe Sell the Same Message?|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2013/04/18/unilever-faces-criticism-for-real-beauty-ad-campaign|work=US News and World Report|accessdate=21 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Taylor|first=Corina|title=Dove’s Real Beauty is bogus|url=http://o.canada.com/life/doves-real-beauty-is-bogus/|work=Canada.com|accessdate=21 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ad controversy ==

In May 2011, Dove prompted criticism and accusations of racism after publishing an [[advertisement|ad]] for their body wash showing three women with different skin tones side by side in front of a "before and after" image of cracked and smooth skin, with a black woman below the "before" and a white woman below the "after".

In 2017, a 3-second video for Dove [[body lotion]] posted on their U.S. Facebook page prompted criticism and accusations of racism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/08/dove-apologises-for-ad-showing-black-woman-turning-into-white-one|title=Dove apologises for ad showing black woman turning into white one|last=Slawson|first=Nicola|date=2017-10-08|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The video clip showed a black woman removing her T-shirt to reveal a white woman, who then lifts her own T-shirt to reveal an Asian woman. The full 30 second TV commercial version included seven women of different races and ages. The ad sparked criticism, leading Dove to remove the ad, saying it “deeply regret[ed] the offence it caused.” Dove further stated that the "video was intended to convey that Dove body wash is for every woman and be a celebration of diversity..." The black woman in the ad, Lola Ogunyemi, said the ad had been misinterpreted and defended Dove.&lt;ref&gt;Nicola Slawson: [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/oct/08/dove-apologises-for-ad-showing-black-woman-turning-into-white-one Dove apologises for ad showing black woman turning into white one] [[The Guardian]], 8&amp;nbsp;October 2017;&lt;br&gt;Maggie Astor: [https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/08/business/dove-ad-racist.html Dove Drops Ad After It Draws Criticism for Being Racist] ''[[The New York Times]]'';&lt;br&gt;Casey Quackenbush: [http://time.com/4974075/dove-apology-racist-ad/ Dove Apologizes After Body Wash Ad Is Slammed For Being Racist] [[Time Magazine]];&lt;br&gt;Jeff Wicks: [https://www.timeslive.co.za/news/south-africa/2017-10-09-dove-extends-olive-branch-over-racist-ad/ Dove extends olive branch over 'racist' ad] [[The Times (South Africa)|The Times]], 9&amp;nbsp;October 2017;&lt;br&gt;Natasha Bach: [http://fortune.com/2017/10/09/racist-dove-facebook-ad-taken-down/ Dove Removes 'Racist' Ad That Seemed to Suggest Black Women Were Dirty] [[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]];&lt;br&gt;Daniel Politi: [http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2017/10/08/dove_apologizes_for_ad_that_shows_black_woman_turning_into_a_white_woman.html Dove Apologizes for Ad That Shows Black Woman Turning Into a White Woman] [[Slate (magazine)|Slate]], 8&amp;nbsp;October 2017;&lt;br&gt;Whitney Kimball: [https://jezebel.com/what-was-doves-thought-process-on-this-racial-transform-1819262866 What Was Dove's Thought Process on This Racial Transformation Ad] [[Jezebel]], 8&amp;nbsp;October 2017;&lt;br&gt;Biba Kang: [https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/dove-racist-advert-facebook-apology-racism-colourism-makeup-beauty-products-a7988961.html Dove’s apology for its Facebook advert is insulting to people of colour – ‘sorry you’re offended’ really isn’t enough.] [[Independent (newspaper)|Independent]], 8&amp;nbsp;October 2017.&lt;br&gt;[https://www.cnbc.com/2017/10/09/dove-faces-pr-disaster-over-ad-that-showed-black-woman-turning-white.html Dove faces PR disaster over ad that showed a black woman turning white] [[CNBC]], 9&amp;nbsp;October 2017.&lt;br&gt;Lola Ogunyemi: [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/oct/10/i-am-woman-racist-dove-ad-not-a-victim I am the woman in the 'racist Dove ad'.

The '''Electronic Commerce Directive''' 2000/31/EC is a [[European Union Directive]] of the [[European Parliament]] and of the Council from 8 June 2000. It regulates certain legal aspects of [[information society]] services in the [[Internal Market]], in particular [[electronic commerce]] and '''mere conduit'''.

==Overview==
The Electronic Commerce Directive, adopted in 2000, sets up an Internal Market framework for electronic commerce. Its aim is to provide [[legal certainty]] for business and consumers. It establishes harmonised rules on issues such as the transparency and information requirements for online [[service provider]]s, commercial communications, electronic contracts and limitations of [[legal liability|liability]] of intermediary service providers.&lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/internal_market/e-commerce/directive_en.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

== Liability of intermediaries ==
The E-Commerce Directive makes several provisions on the liability of any service normally provided for [[remuneration]], at a distance, by electronic means and at the individual request of a recipient of services (intermediary).&lt;ref&gt;The definition of an information society service to which this liability regime refers to, according to article 2(a) of the Electronic Commerce Directive 2000 and article 1(2) of EU directive 98/34/EC.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== "Mere conduit" ===
Where an information society service is provided that consists of the transmission in a communication network of information provided by a recipient of the service, or the provision of access to a communication network, Member States shall ensure that the service provider is not liable for the information transmitted, on condition that the provider:
* does not initiate the transmission;
* does not select the receiver of the transmission; and
* does not select or modify the information contained in the transmission.
The acts of transmission and of provision of access include the automatic, intermediate and transient storage of the information transmitted in so far as this takes place for the sole purpose of carrying out the transmission in the communication network, and provided that the information is not stored for any period longer than is reasonably necessary for the transmission.

=== "Caching" ===
Where an information society service is provided that consists of the transmission in a communication network of information provided by a recipient of the service, Member States shall ensure that the service provider is not liable for the automatic, intermediate and temporary storage of that information, performed for the sole purpose of making more efficient the information's onward transmission to other recipients of the service upon their request, on condition that:
* the provider does not modify the information;
* the provider complies with conditions on access to the information;
* the provider complies with rules regarding the updating of the information, specified in a manner widely recognized and used by industry;
* the provider does not interfere with the lawful use of technology, widely recognized and used by industry, to obtain data on the use of the information; and
* the provider acts expeditiously to remove or to disable access to the information it has stored upon obtaining actual knowledge of the fact that the information at the initial source of the transmission has been removed from the network, or access to it has been disabled, or that a court or an administrative authority has ordered such removal or disablement.

=== Hosting ===
Where an information society service is provided that consists of the storage of information provided by a recipient of the service, Member States shall ensure that the service provider is not liable for the information stored at the request of a recipient of the service, on condition that:
* the provider does not have actual knowledge of illegal activity or information and, as regards claims for damages, is not aware of facts or circumstances from which the illegal activity or information is apparent; or
* the provider, upon obtaining such knowledge or awareness, acts expeditiously to remove or to disable access to the information.

Article 14 forms the basis for [[notice and take down]] procedures by online hosts under EU law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = The Role of Internet Intermediaries in Advancing Public Policy Objectives| publisher = OECD Publishing| date = 4 October 2011| pages = 146| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=1HcH18cqJh0C&amp;dq=notice+and+notice+canada&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s | isbn = 9789264115637}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''EmoSPARK''' is an [[artificial intelligence]] console created in [[London, United Kingdom]] by Patrick Levy-Rosenthal. The device uses facial recognition and language analysis to evaluate human emotion and convey responsive content according to the emotion.&lt;ref name=wired&gt;{{cite web|title=Emospark is an emotionally-aware AI console for the home|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2014-01/03/emospark|work=Wired|accessdate=16 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The console measures 90&amp;nbsp;mm x 90&amp;nbsp;mm x 90&amp;nbsp;mm and is cube shaped. It operates on an "Emotional Processing Unit", an emotion chip developed by Emoshape Inc. that enables the system to create emotional profile graphs of its surroundings.&lt;ref name=wired/&gt; The emotional processing unit is a patent pending technology that is said to create synthesised emotional responses in machines.&lt;ref name=herald&gt;{{cite web |title=Emoshape Provide Intelligent Machines with Emotions |url=http://www.heraldonline.com/2014/11/03/6486612_emoshape-provide-intelligent-machines.html?rh=1 |work=Herald |accessdate=16 November 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141108144649/http://www.heraldonline.com/2014/11/03/6486612_emoshape-provide-intelligent-machines.html?rh=1 |archivedate=8 November 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; EmoSPARK was funded through an [[Indiegogo]] campaign which aimed to raise $200,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Emospark First AI Home Console|url=https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/emospark-first-a-i-home-console|publisher=Indiegogo|accessdate=16 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Series 20: Episode 11 - EmoSpark|url=http://gadgetshow.channel5.com/news/series-20-episode-11-emospark|publisher=Gadget Show|accessdate=14 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Product overview==
[[File:EmoSPARKcube.jpg|thumb|250px|EmoSPARK Cube]]
EmoSPARK was created by French inventor Patrick Levy-Rosenthal, as an emotionally intelligent artificial life unit for the home that can interact with people. It is powered by [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and can communicate with users through typed input from a computer, tablet, smartphone or TV as well as through spoken commands.&lt;ref name=wired/&gt;

The EmoSpark's features are categorized into two types: functional and emotional.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnet.com/news/emospark-ai-console-wants-to-be-your-robot-companion/|title=EmoSpark AI console wants to be your robot companion|work=CNET|access-date=2017-10-06|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; EmoSPARK is said to have the ability to perform practical software-based tasks.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Through the smartphone interface, it is able to gauge a person’s emotions and is reported to have a conversational library of over 2 million sentences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Emospark |url=http://www.bing.com/videos/watch/video/emospark/15rddtf |publisher=Connected Life |accessdate=16 November 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141214175729/http://www.bing.com/videos/watch/video/emospark/15rddtf |archivedate=14 December 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The face-tracking technology identifies users likes and dislikes to categorize their emotional responses to stimuli such as videos and music.&lt;ref name=wired/&gt; The device has an emotional spectrum that is composed of eight emotions which are ''surprise, sadness, joy, trust, fear, disgust, anger and anticipation''.&lt;ref name=wired/&gt;

EmoSPARK monitors a person's facial expressions and emotions through images from an external camera which are then processed through an emotion text analysis and content analysis.&lt;ref name=CNET&gt;{{cite web|title=EmoSpark AI console just wants you to be happy |url=http://www.cnet.com/news/emospark-ai-console-just-wants-you-to-be-happy/|publisher=CNET News |accessdate=16 November 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[New Scientist]] reported that EmoSPARK had the ability to work on the best way to cheer up its users, emotionally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg22630212-900-say-hello-to-machines-that-read-your-emotions-to-make-you-happy/|title=Say hello to machines that read your emotions to make you happy|work=New Scientist|access-date=2017-10-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through Android OS, EmoSPARK is able to be customized with [[Google Play]] store apps.&lt;ref name=wired/&gt;

The cube is capable of learning the user’s emotions and responses to types of music or content then uses it in the future for similar emotions.&lt;ref name=DailyMail&gt;{{cite web|title=The machine that 'feels' EMOTIONS|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2820177/The-machine-feels-EMOTIONS-Microchip-breakthrough-claims-make-AI-computer-able-empathise-humans.html|work=Daily Mail|accessdate=16 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also able to emulate the emotions that it has observed and learned which are in the spectrum of primary emotions.&lt;ref name=DailyMail/&gt; The cube is expected to develop its own personality based on the communications it has had with the people using it.&lt;ref name=roboticstomorrow&gt;{{cite web|title=The EmoSPARK Cube Is Bringing the Fascinating World of AI to Our Personal Lives|url=http://www.roboticstomorrow.com/news/2014/10/15/indiegogo--the-emospark-cube-is-bringing-the-fascinating-world-of-ai-to-our-personal-lives-/4912/|publisher=Robotics Tomorrow|accessdate=16 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In early 2010, photo enthusiasts Florian Meissner, Ramzi Rizk, Gen Sadakane and Lorenz Aschoff came together to discuss mobile photography. By March, they decided to host one of the world's first mobile photography competitions and host an exhibition. The winners and runners-up were part of an exhibition that took place in Berlin in June 22 of the same year.&lt;ref&gt;"EYE'EM" by Mobile Photography, Lulu.com, first edition, October 26, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

During the beta period, EyeEm was an iPhone only app and was called EYE'EM, and managed to have more than 5,000 users from 79 countries.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.prweb.com/releases/2011/8/prweb8693991.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In early 2011, Meissner, Rizk, Sadakane, and Aschoff decided to work on the idea full-time and launched the first version of the EyeEm app on Android and iOS in August 2011 following the beta test period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= Butcher, Mike|url= https://techcrunch.com/2011/08/04/eyeems-camera-app-is-a-beautiful-new-interface-for-photography/ |title=EyeEm’s Camera App Is A Beautiful New Interface For Photography |publisher=The News Hub |date=2011-08-04 |accessdate=2016-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2014, EyeEm partnered with [[Getty Images]] to distribute photographs taken by EyeEm users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= Robehmed, Natalie|url= https://www.forbes.com/sites/natalierobehmed/2014/03/06/photo-app-eyeem-partners-with-getty-to-sell-user-images/#37418624f767 |title=Photo App EyeEm Partners With Getty To Sell User Images |publisher= Forbes |date=2014-04-06 |accessdate=2016-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; By June 2014, EyeEm had over 10 million users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= Weber, Harrison|url= https://venturebeat.com/2014/06/25/photography-community-eyeem-launches-android-redesign-hits-10m-users/ |title=Photography community EyeEm launches Android redesign, hits 10M users |publisher= VentureBeat |date=2014-06-25 |accessdate=2016-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2015, EyeEm reached 13 million users and launched Market, its own [[online marketplace]] where users can sell their own images.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= Sawers, Paul|url= https://venturebeat.com/2015/03/26/13-million-users-on-eyeem-launches-a-marketplace-to-let-you-sell-your-photos/ |title=13M users on, EyeEm launches a marketplace to let you turn your photos into cash

The round was led by Valar Ventures and includes existing investors Earlybird Ventures, Passion Capital, Wellington Partners, Atlantic Labs and Open Ocean Capital. As part of the new round, Valar took a board seat at the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= Wagner, Kurt|url= http://www.recode.net/2015/4/16/11561554/eyeem-raises-18-million-in-quest-to-sell-your-smartphone-photos |title=EyeEm Raises $18 Million in Quest to Sell Your Smartphone Photos |publisher= Recode |date=2015-04-16 |accessdate=2016-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2015, EyeEm launched the Discover Feed, a manually curated feed, in an effort to showcase the “most beautiful images from featured photographers and albums.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= Yeung, Ken|url= https://venturebeat.com/2015/07/08/eyeems-app-gets-refreshed-discovery-feed-with-curated-content-to-inspire-you-with-great-photos/ |title=EyeEm’s photo app adds curated content to inspire you and connect you |publisher= VentureBeat |date=2015-07-08 |accessdate=2016-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2015, EyeEm launched EyeEm Vision (previously called EyeVision), a [[deep learning]] [[computer vision]] framework that recognizes concepts and ranks aesthetics of images.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= Dove, Jackie|url= https://thenextweb.com/creativity/2015/09/18/eyeem-wants-its-new-eyevision-algorithm-to-be-the-google-of-photography/ |title=EyeEm wants its new EyeVision algorithm to be the Google of photography |publisher= The Next Web |date=2015-09-18 |accessdate=2016-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2016, EyeEm announced a new partnership with [[Alamy]] as another distribution partner besides Getty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= Torrens, Lee|url= http://www.microstockdiaries.com/eyeem-adds-alamy-as-distribution-partner.html |title=EyeEm Adds Alamy as Distribution Partner |publisher= Microstock Diaries |date=2016-01-19 |accessdate=2016-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2016, EyeEm launched The Roll, an iOS app that analyzes the camera roll and uses computer vision to tag the images and rank the photos by how good they are.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= Jan Kamps, Haje|url= https://techcrunch.com/2016/05/12/eyeem-the-roll/ |title=The Roll helps you find the best photos on your phone |publisher= TechCrunch |date=2016-05-12 |accessdate=2016-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The app made headlines at Apple's worldwide developer conference ([[Apple Worldwide Developers Conference|WWDC]] 2016), where it was announced that The Roll will be one of the first apps to deeply integrate with [[Siri]], "by combining speech recognition with EyeEm’s aesthetic rank technology".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= Hannah, Gal|url= https://www.the-newshub.com/technology/artificial-intelligence-on-stage-at-apples-wwdc2016 |title=Artificial Intelligence On Stage at Apple’s #WWDC2016 |publisher= The News Hub |date=2016-06-14 |accessdate=2016-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2016, EyeEm reaches 18M users and opens their Web Upload to all users so that it is as easy as possible for [[Flickr]] users to upload their pictures to EyeEm Market and join their photography based community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= Cade, DL|url= http://petapixel.com/2016/07/27/exclusive-eyeem-wooing-flickr-users-opens-web-uploader-everyone/ |title=Exclusive: EyeEm Wooing Flickr Users, Opens Up Web Uploader to Everyone |publisher= PetaPixel |date=2016-07-27 |accessdate=2016-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technology ==
EyeEm's [[Computer vision#Recognition|image recognition technology]] uses artificial intelligence to tag and rank images based on an aesthetic score assigned to each photo. When users upload a photo via the Web Upload tool, this technology is applied to determine the discoverability of each photo, and suggest keywords. The company applied this to an iOS app called The Roll, which launched in May 2016 and organizes the images on your camera roll.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= Dwoskin, Elizabeth|url= https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-software-sifts-the-tide-of-online-images-1443722371 |title=New Software Sifts Photos for the Most Clickable |publisher= The Wall Street Journal |date=2016-10-01 |accessdate=2016-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Funding ==
The company has raised $24 million to date in funding from [[Valar Ventures]], Earlybird Venture Capital, Passion Capital, [[Wellington Partners]], Atlantic Labs and [[OpenOcean]]. In 2018, it was revealed that the company raised an additional $10 million in an internal round from existing investors, with new investors Cipio Partners joining the round. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.cipiopartners.com/portfolio/&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;https://www.gruenderszene.de/technologie/eyeem-10-millionen-dollar-geheim&lt;/ref&gt;
EyeEm was incorporated in Berlin, Germany,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.finsmes.com/2011/08/eyeem-receives-seed-funding.html&lt;/ref&gt; in February 2011 by founders Florian Meissner, Lorenz Aschoff, Gen Sadakane, and Ramzi Rizk.

'''''Festuca arundinacea''''' ([[synonym (taxonomy)|syn.]], '''''Schedonorus arundinaceus''''' and '''''Lolium arundinaceum''''') is a species of [[Poaceae|grass]] commonly known as '''tall fescue'''. It is a cool-season perennial [[C3 carbon fixation|C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] species of [[bunchgrass]] native to [[Europe]].  It is an important [[forage]] grass throughout Europe, and many [[cultivar]]s have been used in agriculture. It is also an [[ornamental grass]] in gardens, and a [[phytoremediation]] plant.

The predominant cultivar found in British pastures is S170, an [[Neotyphodium|endophyte]]-free variety.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, D. J. and J. A. Newman. (2002). ''Festuca arundinacea'' Schreber (''F. elatior'' L. ssp. ''arundinacea'' (Schreber) Hackel). ''Journal of Ecology'' 89, 304-324.&lt;/ref&gt; In its native European environment, tall fescue is found in damp grasslands, river banks, and in coastal seashore locations.&lt;ref&gt;T. G. Tutin et al., ''Flora Europaea''. Cambridge University Press, New York, 1980. vol. 5, pp 132-133.&lt;/ref&gt;  Its distribution is a factor of climatic, [[edaphic]], or other environmental attributes.&lt;ref&gt;Saikkinen, K. (2000). Kentucky 31, far from home. ''Science'' 287, 1887.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===In the U.S.===
Tall fescue was introduced into the United States in the late 19th century, but it did not establish itself as a widely used perennial forage until the 1940s.  As in Europe, tall fescue has become an important, well-adapted cool season forage grass for agriculture in the US with many cultivars.  In addition to forage, it has become an important grass for turf and [[soil conservation]]. Tall fescue is the most heat tolerant of the major cool season grasses. Tall fescue has a deep root system compared to other cool season grasses. This [[introduced species|non-native]] grass is well adapted to the "transition zone" [[Mid Atlantic and Southeastern United States]] and now occupies over {{convert|35000000|acre|km2}}.&lt;ref name=Ball&gt;Ball, D. M., J. F. Pedersen, G. D. Lacefield. (1993). The tall-fescue endophyte. ''American Scientist'' 81, 370-379.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tall fescue has become an [[invasive species]] and [[noxious weed]] in native California grasslands and habitats, such as the [[California coastal prairie]] [[plant community]].

The dominant cultivar grown in the United States is [[Kentucky 31]].  In 1931 E. N. Fergus, a professor of agronomy at the [[University of Kentucky]], collected seed from a population on a hillside in [[Menifee County, Kentucky]] although formal cultivar release did not happen until 1943.  Fergus heard about this "wonder grass" while judging a [[Sweet sorghum|sorghum syrup]] competition in a nearby town. He wanted to see this grass because it was green, lush, and growing well on a sloped hillside during a drought.  While visiting the site he was impressed and took seed samples with him.  With this seed he conducted variety trials, initiated seed increase nurseries, and lauded its performance.  It was released as Kentucky 31 in 1943 and today it dominates grasslands in the humid southeastern US.  In 1943, Fergus and others recognized this tall fescue cultivar as being vigorous, widely adaptable, able to withstand poor soil conditions, resistant to pests and drought.&lt;ref name=Ball/&gt; It is used primarily in pastures and low maintenance situations.

Breeders have created numerous cultivars that are dark green with desirable narrower blades than the light green coarse bladed K-31. Tall fescue is the grass on the [[South Lawn]] of the [[White House]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/ask/20081016.html |title=Dale Haney hosts Ask the White House |publisher=Georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov |date=2008-10-16 |accessdate=2018-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Tall fescue is a long-lived perennial bunchgrass species.  [[Photosynthesis]] occurs throughout the leaves, which form bunches and are thick and wide with prominent veins running parallel the entire length of the blade. The blades have a "toothed" edge which can be felt if fingers are run down the edge of the leaf blade. The underside of the leaf may be shiny.  Emerging leaves are rolled in the bud with no prominent [[ligule]]. Note that most grasses are folded not rolled, which make this a key identification feature on tall fescue.  The [[Auricle (botany)|auricles]] are usually blunt but occasionally may be more clawlike.  The [[culm (botany)|culm]] is round in cross-section.  Typically, this species of grass has a long growing season and ranges between 2 and {{convert|4|ft|m}} tall in seedhead stage.&lt;ref name=GrassLegID&gt;Grass and Legume Identification. UK Extension.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Starr 040523-9001 Festuca arundinacea.jpg|thumb|right]]

Tall fescue spreads through [[Tiller (botany)|tillering]] and seed transmission — not by [[stolon]]s or [[rhizome]]s, which are common in many grass species.  However, tall fescue may have numerous sterile shoots that extend the width of each bunch.  There are approximately 227,000 seeds per pound.&lt;ref name=USDAPlants&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plants.usda.gov/factsheet/pdf/fs_loar10.pdf |title=Tall Fescue |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2018-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically found across the mid-Atlantic and Southeast US, tall fescue performs best in soils with pH values between 5.5 and 7.  Growth may occur year-round if conditions are adequate, but typically growth ceases when soil temperature falls below {{convert|40|°F|°C|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=USDAPlants/&gt;

==Taxonomy==
''Festuca arundinacea'' was first described by the German naturalist [[Johann Christian Daniel von Schreber]] in 1771. It was later moved to the genus ''Schedonorus'' by the Belgian botanist [[Barthélemy Charles Joseph Dumortier]] in 1824 and again to the genus ''Lolium'' under the name ''Lolium arundinaceum'' by Stephen J. Darbyshire in 1993. The genus ''Schedonorus'' was resurrected in 1998 and the name ''Schedonorus arundinaceus'' (Schreb.) Dumort. was [[conserved name|conserved]] against the earlier name ''Schedonorus arundinaceus'' Roem. &amp; Schult.&lt;ref name="Proposal"&gt;Soreng, R.J., E.E. Terrell, J. Wiersema, and S.J. Darbyshire. 2001. (1488) Proposal to conserve the name ''Schedonorus arundinaceus'' (Schreb.) Dumort. against ''Schedonorus arundinaceus'' Roem. &amp; Schult. (Poaceae: Poeae). ''Taxon'', 50(3): 915-917.&lt;/ref&gt; Best known by the name ''Festuca arundinacea'', there is disagreement by taxonomists whether ''Festuca'' subgenus ''Schedonorus'' is allied more with the genus ''Lolium'' or best elevated to genus rank on its own.&lt;ref name=Saha&gt;Saha, M.C. [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=MaKNAgAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA58 Tall Fescue]. ''In'' Cai, H., T. Yamada, and C. Kole. ''Genetics, Genomics and Breeding of Forage Crops''. CRC Press: Boca Raton, Florida. pp. 58-89.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Endophyte association==

Tall fescue can be found growing in most soils of the southeast including marginal, acidic, and poorly drained soils and in areas of low fertility, and where stresses occur due to drought and overgrazing.&lt;ref&gt;Forage Identification and Use Guide. 2000. AGR-175, UK Extension Service.&lt;/ref&gt;  These beneficial attributes are now known to be a result of a [[Symbiosis|symbiotic]] association with the fungus ''[[Neotyphodium coenophialum]]''.&lt;ref name=Siegel&gt;Siegel M. R. and L. P. Bush. (1997). Toxin production in grass/endophyte associations. ''Plant Relationships''. 185-207.&lt;/ref&gt;

This association between tall fescue and the fungal endophyte is a [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]] symbiotic relationship (both symbionts derive benefits from it).  The fungus remains completely [[intercellular]], growing between the cells of the aboveground parts of its grass host. The fungus is [[asexual reproduction|asexual]], and is transmitted to new generations of tall fescue only through seed, a mode known as vertical transmission.&lt;ref name=Siegel/&gt; Thus in nature, the fungus does not live outside the plant. Viability of the fungus in seeds is limited; typically, after a year or two of seed storage the fungal endophyte [[mycelium]] has died, and seeds germinated will result in plants that are  endophyte-free.&lt;ref&gt;[http://forages.oregonstate.edu/organizations/seed/otfc/endophyte/plants.html Oregon State Info Page] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080511223308/http://forages.oregonstate.edu/organizations/seed/otfc/endophyte/plants.html |date=2008-05-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tall fescue–endophyte symbiosis confers a competitive advantage to the plant.  Endophyte-infected tall fescue compared to endophyte-free tall fescue deters herbivory by insects and mammals,&lt;ref&gt;Hoveland, C. S., et al. (1983). Steer performance and association of ''[[Acremonium coenophialum]]'' fungal endophyte on tall fescue pasture. ''Agronomy Journal'' 75: 821-824.&lt;/ref&gt; bestows drought resistance,&lt;ref&gt;West, C. P., et al. (1993). Endophyte effects on growth and persistence of tall fescue along a water supply gradient. ''Agron J'' 85: 264–270.&lt;/ref&gt; and disease resistance.&lt;ref&gt;Latch, G. C. M. (1997). An overview of ''Neotyphodium''-grass interactions. p. 1–11. In C. W. Bacon and N. S. Hill (Eds.) ''Neotyphodium''/Grass Interactions. Plenum Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt; In return for shelter, seed transmission, and nutrients the endophyte produces [[secondary metabolites]]. These metabolites, namely [[alkaloid]]s, are responsible for increased plant fitness.  Alkaloids in endophytic tall fescue include 1-amino[[pyrrolizidine]]s ([[Loline alkaloids|lolines]]), [[ergot alkaloids]] (clavines, lysergic acids, and derivative alkaloids), and the [[pyrrolopyrazine]], peramine.
[[Image:Loline core structure.svg|thumb|Core structure of the 1-aminopyrrolizidines (loline alkaloids) produced in tall fescue infected by ''Neotyphodium coenophialum''; R' and R&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt; denote variable [[substituent]]s that can include [[methyl]], [[formyl]], and [[acetyl]] groups giving rise to different loline species.]]
The lolines are the most abundant alkaloids, with concentrations 1000 higher than those of ergot alkaloids.  Endophyte-free grasses do not produce lolines, and, as shown for the closely related endophyte commonly occurring in [[meadow fescue]], ''[[Neotyphodium uncinatum]]'',&lt;ref name="Blankenship2001"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Blankenship JD, Spiering MJ, Wilkinson HH, Fannin FF, Bush LP, Schardl CL |year=2001|title=Production of loline alkaloids by the grass endophyte, ''Neotyphodium uncinatum'', in defined media|journal = [[Phytochemistry (journal)|Phytochemistry]]|volume=58|pages=395–401|pmid=11557071|doi=10.1016/S0031-9422(01)00272-2|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; the endophyte can produce lolines in [[axenic]] laboratory culture. However, although ''N. coenophialum'' possesses all the genes for loline biosynthesis,&lt;ref name="Kutil et al 2007"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Kutil BL, Greenwald C, Liu G, Spiering MJ, Schardl CL, Wilkinson HH |year=2007|title=Comparison of loline alkaloid gene clusters across fungal endophytes: predicting the co-regulatory sequence motifs and the evolutionary history|journal = [[Fungal Genetics and Biology]]|volume=44|pages=1002–10|pmid=17509914|doi=10.1016/j.fgb.2007.04.003|issue=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; it does not produce lolines in culture.&lt;ref name="Blankenship2001"/&gt; So in the tall fescue symbiosis, only the interaction of the host and endophyte produces the lolines.&lt;ref name=Siegel/&gt; Lolines have been shown to deter insect herbivory, and may cause various other responses in higher organisms. Despite their lower concentrations, ergot alkaloids appear to significantly affect animal growth.  Ergots cause changes in normal homeostatic mechanisms in animals that result in toxicity manifested through reduced weight gains, elevated [[core temperature]]s, restricted blood flow, reduced milk production and reproductive problems. Peramine, like the ergot alkaloids, is found in much lower concentrations in the host compared with loline alkaloids.  Its activity has been shown to be primarily insecticidal, and has not been linked to toxicity in mammals or other herbivores.&lt;ref&gt;Rowan, D. D., and G. C. M. Latch. (1994). Utilization of endophyte infected perennial ryegrass for increased insect resistance. p. 169–183. In C. W. Bacon and J. F. White, Jr. (Eds.) ''Biotechnology of endophytic fungi of grasses.''

==Endophyte infected tall fescue effects on animals==

===Broodmares and foals===

Horses are especially prone to reproductive problems associated with tall fescue, often resulting in death of the foal, mare, or both.&lt;ref&gt;Putnum, et al. (1990). The effect of the fungal endophyte, ''Acremonium coenophialum'' in fescue on pregnant mares and foal viability. ''Am. J. Res.'' 52:2071&lt;/ref&gt; Horses which are pregnant may be strongly affected by alkaloids produced by the tall fescue symbiont.  [[Mare (horse)|Broodmares]] that forage on infected fescue may have prolonged gestation, foaling difficulty, thickened [[placenta]], or impaired [[lactation]].  In addition, the foals may be born weakened or dead.&lt;ref&gt;Understanding Endophyte-Infected Tall Fescue and Its Effect on Broodmares. UK Extension&lt;/ref&gt;  To moderate toxicosis, it is recommended that pregnant mares should be taken off infected tall fescue pasture for 60–90 days before foaling as late gestation problems are most common.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence, L. A. [http://www.ext.vt.edu/pubs/horse/406-475/406-475.html  Broodmares Grazing Tall Fescue Pastures or Fed Tall Fescue Hay Require Careful Management and Close Observation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516062841/http://www.ext.vt.edu/pubs/horse/406-475/406-475.html |date=2008-05-16 }}. 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cattle===
Fescue toxicity in [[cattle]] appears as roughening of the coat in the summer and intolerance to heat. Cattle that graze on tall fescue are more likely to stay in the shade or wade in the water in hot weather.  In the winter, a condition known as "fescue foot" might afflict cattle.  This results from vasoconstriction of the blood vessels especially in the extremities, and causes a [[Gangrene|gangrenous]] condition.  Untreated, the hoof might slough off.  Additionally, cattle may experience decreased weight gains and poor milk production when heavily grazing infected tall fescue pasture.&lt;ref name=Ball/&gt;  To deter toxicosis cattle should be given alternative feed to dilute their infected tall fescue intake.

==Nutrient pools under tall fescue pasture==
[[Carbon cycle|Carbon cycling]] in terrestrial ecosystems is a major focus of research.  Terrestrial [[carbon sequestration]] is the process of removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere via photosynthesis and storing this carbon in either plant or soil carbon pools.  Increases in soil organic carbon help aggregate the soil, increase infiltration, reduce erosion, increase soil fertility, and act as long lived pools of soil carbon. Many studies have suggested that long term endophyte-infected tall fescue plots increase soil carbon storage in the soil by limiting the microbial and macrofaunal activity to break down endophyte infected organic matter input and by increasing inputs of carbon via plant production.&lt;ref name="Franz"&gt;Franzluebbers, A. J., et al. (1999). Soil carbon and nitrogen pools under low- and high-endophyte-infected tall fescue. ''Soil Science Society of America Journal'' 63, 1687–1694.&lt;/ref&gt; While the long term studies tend to show an increase in carbon storage, the short term studies do not.  However, short term studies have shown that the endophyte association results in higher above- and belowground plant biomass production compared to uninfected plants,&lt;ref name=Franz/&gt; as well as a decrease in certain microbial communities.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins, M. B., A. J. Franzluebbers, and S. B. Humayoun (2006). Assessing short-term responses of prokaryotic communities in bulk and rhizosphere soils to tall fescue endophyte infection. ''Plant Soil'' 289, 309–320.&lt;/ref&gt;  Site-specific characteristics, such as management and climate, need to be further understood to realize the ecological role and potential benefits of tall fescue and the endophyte association as it relates to carbon sequestration.

==Novel endophytes==
New cultivars are being bred and tested every year.  A major focus of research is producing endophyte-infected tall fescue cultivars that have no detrimental effects to livestock while keeping the endophytic effects of reduced insect herbivory, disease resistance, drought tolerance, and extended growing season.  Novel endophytes, also referred to as "friendly" endophytes, are symbiotic fungi that are associated with tall fescue, but do not produce target alkaloids in toxic concentrations.  A widely used and tested novel endophyte is called MaxQ and is grown in the tall fescue grass host Georgia-Jesup.&lt;ref&gt;Ball, D. M.[http://www.aces.edu/dept/forages/fescue/ForageEndophyte03.htm Novel Endophytes of Tall Fescue] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051110145528/http://www.aces.edu/dept/forages/fescue/ForageEndophyte03.htm |date=2005-11-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This cultivar of tall fescue-novel endophyte combination produces ergot alkaloids at near zero levels while maintaining the concentration of other alkaloids.

[[File:CFD Vapor Chamber Heat Sink Design v1.gif|thumb|320px|This 120&amp;nbsp;mm-diameter vapor chamber (heat spreader) heat sink design thermal animation, was created using high resolution CFD analysis, and shows temperature contoured heat sink surface and fluid flow trajectories, predicted using a [[Computational fluid dynamics|CFD]] analysis package.]]

A '''heat spreader''' conducts [[heat]] between a heat source and a [[heat sink]] or [[heat exchanger]]. Most commonly a plate or block of material having high [[thermal conductivity]], such as [[copper]], aluminum, or diamond. (A [[heat pipe]] performs a similar function, but it uses moving fluids inside a sealed case.) By definition, it "spreads out" heat, so that the heat exchanger(s) may be more fully utilized. This has the potential to increase the heat capacity of the total assembly, but the additional thermal junctions limit total thermal capacity. The high conduction properties of the spreader will make it more effective to function as an [[air]] [[heat exchanger]], as opposed to the original (presumably smaller) source. The low heat conduction of air in [[convection]] is matched by the higher surface area of the spreader, and heat is transferred more effectively.

A heat spreader is generally used when the heat source tends to have a high heat-[[flux density]], (high heat flow per unit area), and for whatever reason, heat can not be conducted away effectively by the heat exchanger. For instance, this may be because it is air-cooled, giving it a lower heat transfer coefficient than if it were liquid-cooled. A high enough heat exchanger transfer coefficient is sufficient to avoid the need for a heat spreader.

The use of a heat spreader is an important part of an economically optimal design for transferring heat from high to low heat flux media. Examples include:
*A [[cookware and bakeware#Clad aluminium or copper|copper-clad bottom]] on a [[steel]] or [[stainless steel]] stove-top cooking container
*Air-cooling [[integrated circuit]]s such as a [[microprocessor]]
*Air-cooling a [[photovoltaic cell]] in a [[concentrated photovoltaics]] system

[[Material properties of diamond#Thermal conductivity|Diamond has a very high thermal conductivity.]] [[Synthetic diamond]] is used as submounts for high-power integrated circuits and laser diodes.

Composite materials can be used, such as the [[metal matrix composite]]s (MMCs) [[copper–tungsten]], [[AlSiC]] ([[silicon carbide]] in aluminium matrix), [[Dymalloy]] (diamond in copper-silver alloy matrix), and [[E-Material]] ([[beryllium oxide]] in [[beryllium]] matrix). Such materials are often used as substrates for chips, as their thermal expansion coefficient can be matched to ceramics and semiconductors.

'''Industrial fans and blowers''' are machines whose primary function is to provide and accommodate a large flow of air or gas to various parts of a building or other structures. This is achieved by rotating a number of blades, connected to a hub and shaft, and driven by a motor or [[turbine]]. The flow rates of these [[mechanical fan]]s range from approximately {{convert|200|cuft}} to {{convert|2000000|cuft}} per minute. A '''blower''' is another name for a fan that operates where the resistance to the flow is primarily on the downstream side of the fan.

==Functions and industries==
There are many uses for the continuous flow of air or gas that industrial fans generate, including [[combustion]], [[ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]], [[aeration]], [[particulate transport]], exhaust, cooling, [[air-cleaning]], and [[drying]], to name a few. The industries served include [[electrical power production]], [[pollution control]], [[metal manufacturing]] and [[metal processing|processing]], [[cement industry|cement production]], [[mining]], [[petrochemical industry|petrochemical]], [[food processing]], [[cryogenics]], and [[clean room]]s.

==Centrifugal fans and axial fans==
Most industrial fans may be categorized into one of two general types: centrifugal fans and axial fans.

===Centrifugal===
{{Detail|Centrifugal fan}}
The centrifugal design uses the centrifugal force generated by a rotating disk, with blades mounted at right angles to the disk, to impart movement to the air or gas and increase its pressure. The assembly of the hub, disk and blades is known as the fan wheel, and often includes other components with aerodynamic or structural functions. The centrifugal fan wheel is typically contained within a scroll-shaped fan housing, resembling the shell of the [[nautilus]] sea creature with a central hole. The air or gas inside the spinning fan is thrown off the outside of the wheel, to an outlet at the housing's largest diameter. This simultaneously draws more air or gas into the wheel through the central hole [http://www.howden.com/en/Products/default.htm]. Inlet and outlet ducting are often attached to the fan's housing, to supply and/or exhaust the air or gas to the industry's requirements.

There are many varieties of centrifugal fans, which may have fan wheels that range from less than 3 cm to over 16 feet (5 m) in diameter.

===Axial===
{{Detail|Axial fan}}
The axial design uses axial forces to achieve the movement of the air or gas, spinning a central hub with blades extending radially from its outer diameter. The fluid is moved parallel to the fan wheel's shaft, or axis of rotation. The axial fan wheel is often contained within a short section of cylindrical ductwork, to which inlet and outlet ducting can be connected.

Axial fan types have fan wheels with diameters that usually range from less than a foot (0.3 meters) to over 30 feet (9 m), although axial cooling tower fan wheels may exceed 82 feet (25 m) in diameter.

In general, axial fans are used where the principal requirement is for a large volume of flow, and the centrifugal design where both flow and higher pressures are required.

==Design paths==
There are several paths to determining a fan design for an application.

For industries where the application requirements do not vary greatly and applicable fan designs have diameters of around 4 feet (1.2 meters) or less, a standard or pre-engineered design might be selected.

When the application involves more complex specifications or a larger fan, then a design based on an existing model configuration will often satisfy the requirements. Many model configurations already cover the range of current industry processes. An appropriate model from the fan company's catalogue is selected, and the company's engineers apply design rules to calculate the dimensions and select options and material for the desired performance, strength and operating environment.

Some applications require a dedicated, custom configuration for a fan design to satisfy all specifications.

All industrial fan designs must be accurately engineered to meet performance specifications while maintaining structural integrity. For each application, there are specific flow and pressure requirements. Depending on the application, the fan may be subject to high rotating speeds, an operating environment with corrosive chemicals or abrasive air streams, and extreme temperatures. Larger fans and higher speeds produce greater forces on the rotating structures; for safety and reliability, the design must eliminate excessive stresses and excitable [[resonant]] frequencies. Computer modeling programs for [[computational fluid dynamics]] (CFD) and [[finite element analysis]] (FEA) are often employed in the design process, in addition to laboratory scale model testing. Even after the fan is built the verification might continue, using fan performance testing for flow and pressure, strain gage testing for stresses and tests to record the fan's [[resonant]] frequencies.

==Fan subtypes==
Fan types and their subtypes are industry standard, recognized by all major fan producers. &lt;ref name="aboutfans"&gt;{{cite web|title = Air Movement and Control Association| url=http://www.amca.org|accessdate = 2008-05-05 | publisher=[[Air Movement and Control Association|AMCA]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Centrifugal===

'''Any of these fan subtypes can be built with long-lasting erosion-resistant liners.'''

'''Airfoil''' ([[Air foil]]) – Used for a wide range of applications in many industries, fans with hollow, airfoil-profiled blades are designed for use in airstreams where high efficiency and quiet operation are required. They are used extensively for continuous service at ambient and elevated temperatures in forced and induced draft applications in the metals, chemical, power generation, paper, rock products, glass, [[resource recovery]], incineration and other industries throughout the world.

'''Backward curve''' – These fans have efficiencies nearly as high as the airfoil design. An advantage is that their single-thickness, curved plate blades prevent the possibility of dust particle buildup inside the blade, as may occur with perforated airfoil blades. The robust design allows high tip-speed operation, and therefore this fan is often used in high-pressure applications.

'''Backward inclined''' – These fans have simple flat blades, backwardly inclined to match the velocity pattern of the air passing through the fan wheel for high-efficiency operation. These fans are typically used in high-volume, relatively low-pressure, clean air applications.

'''Radial blade''' – The flat blades of this type are arranged in a radial pattern. These rugged fans offer high pressure capability with average efficiency. They are often fitted with erosion-resistant liners to extend rotor life. The housing design is compact to minimize the floor space requirement.

'''Radial tipped''' – These fans have wheels that are backward curved, but in a way slightly different from backward curved fans. Backward curved fans have wheels whose blades curve outward, while radial-tip fans' blades are curved inward and radial at their tips (hence the name "radial tip"), while still in a backwardly-curved configuration.  Their curvature can also be thought of as radial at the tips but gradually sloping toward the direction of rotation. This rugged design is used in high-volume flow rate applications when the pressure requirement is rather high and erosion resistance is necessary. It offers medium efficiencies. A common application is the dirty side of a baghouse or precipitator. The design is more compact than airfoil, backward curved or backward inclined fans.

'''Paddle-wheel''' – This is an open impeller design without shrouds. Although the efficiency is not high, this fan is well suited for applications with extremely high dust loading. It can be offered with field-replaceable blade liners from ceramic tiles or [[tungsten carbide]]. This fan may also be used in high-temperature applications.

'''Forward-curve''' – This "squirrel cage" impeller generates the highest volume flow rate (for a given tip speed) of all the centrifugal fans. Therefore, it often has the advantage of offering the smallest physical package available for a given application. This type of fan is commonly used in high-temperature furnaces.  However, these fans can only be used for conveying air with low dust loading because they are the most sensitive to particle build-up, but also due to the large number of blades that forward-curve wheels require.

'''Industrial exhausters''' – This is a relatively inexpensive, medium-duty, steeply inclined flat-bladed fan for exhausting gases, conveying chips, etc.

'''Pre-engineered fans''' (PE) – A series of fans of varying blade shapes that are usually available in only standard sizes. Because they are pre-engineered these fans may be available with relatively short delivery times.  Often, pre-engineered rotors with various blade shapes may be installed into a common housing. These are often available in a wide range of volume and pressure requirements to meet the needs of many applications.

'''Pressure blowers''' – These are high-pressure, low-volume blowers used in combustion air applications in furnaces or to provide “blow-off” air for clearing and/or drying applications.

'''Surgeless blowers''' – These high-pressure, low-volume blowers have a reduced tendency for “surging” (periodic variation of flow rate) even at severely reduced fan speeds. This allows extreme turndown (low-flow) without significant pulsation.

'''Mechanical vapor recovery blowers''' -These specially designed centrifugal fans are designed to increase temperature and pressure of saturated steam in a closed-loop system.

'''Acid gas blowers''' - These very heavy construction blowers are suitable for inlet pressures from full vacuum to 100 psig. Materials are selected for corrosion resistance to the gases and particulate handled.

'''Specialty process gas blowers''' - These blowers are for high pressure petrochemical processes.

===Axial===

'''High-temperature axial fans''' – These are high-volume fans designed to operate against low flow resistance in industrial convection furnaces. They may be of either single-direction or bi-directional designs. Extremely rugged, they are most often used in high-temperature furnace (up to 1800 degF) application.

'''Tube axial fans''' – These are axial fan units with fan wheels located in cylindrical tubes, without inlet or outlet dampers.

'''Vaneaxial fans''' – These axial flow fans have a higher pressure capability due to the presence of static vanes.

'''Variable pitch axial fans''' – The blades on these axial fans are manually adjustable to permit the blade angle to be changed. This allows operation over a much wider range of volume/pressure relationships. The blades are adjusted periodically to optimize efficiency by matching the blade pitch to the varying conditions for the application. These fans are often used in mining applications.

'''Variable pitch on-the-fly axial fans''' – These are similar to “Variable Pitch Axial Fans” except they include an internal mechanism that allows the blade pitch to be adjusted while the fan rotor is in motion. These versatile fans offer high-efficiency operation at many different points of operation. This instantaneous blade adjustment capability is an advantage that is possible with axial fans only.

'''Cooling fans - (also referred to as "cooling tower fans")''' - These are axial fans, typically with large diameters, for low pressures and large volumes of airflow.  Applications are in wet mechanical cooling towers, air-cooled steam condensers, air-cooled heat exchangers, radiators, or similar air-cooled applications.

'''Mixed-flow fans''' - The gas flow patterns these fans produce resemble a combination of axial and centrifugal patterns, although the fan wheels often appear similar to centrifugal wheels. There are various types of mixed-flow fans, including gas-tight high-pressure fans and blowers.

==Flow control==
There are several means of controlling the flow rate of a fan, e.g., temporarily reducing the air or gas flow rate; these can be applied to both centrifugal and axial fans.

'''Speed Variation''' - All of the fan types described above can be used in conjunction with a variable speed driver. This might be an adjustable frequency AC controller, a DC motor and drive, a steam [[turbine]] driver, or a hydraulic [[variable speed drive]] unit ("fluid drive"). Flow control by means of variable speed is typically smoother and more efficient than by means of damper control. Significant power savings (with reduced cost of operation) are possible if variable speed fan drives are used for applications that require reduced flow operation for a significant portion of the system operating life.

'''Industrial Dampers''' - These devices also allow fan volumetric flow control during operation, by means of panels so as to direct gas flow or restrict the inlet or outlet areas.

There is a variety of dampers available:

Louvered Inlet Box Dampers&lt;BR /&gt;
Radial Inlet Dampers&lt;BR /&gt;
Variable Inlet Vane (VIV) Dampers&lt;BR /&gt;
Vortex Dampers&lt;BR /&gt;
Discharge Dampers&lt;BR&gt;

[[File:Industry 4.0.png|thumb|right|500px|Industrial revolutions and future view]]'''Industry 4.0''' is a name given to the {{as of | 2018 | alt = current}} trend of [[automation]] and data exchange in [[manufacturing]] [[technologie]]s. It includes [[cyber-physical system]]s, the [[Internet of things]],  [[cloud computing]]&lt;ref name="Definition-I4.0"&gt;Hermann, Pentek, Otto, 2016: [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=7427673&amp;newsearch=true&amp;queryText=industrie%204.0%20design%20principles Design Principles for Industrie 4.0 Scenarios], accessed on 4 May 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Jürgen Jasperneite]]:''[http://www.computer-automation.de/steuerungsebene/steuernregeln/fachwissen/article/93559/0/Was_hinter_Begriffen_wie_Industrie_40_steckt/ Was hinter Begriffen wie Industrie 4.0 steckt]'' in ''Computer &amp; Automation'', 19 December 2012 accessed on 23 December 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kagermann, H., W.

Industry 4.0 fosters what has been called a "smart factory". Within modular structured smart factories, cyber-physical systems monitor physical processes, create a virtual copy of the physical world and make decentralized decisions. Over the Internet of Things, cyber-physical systems communicate and cooperate with each other and with humans in real-time both internally and across organizational services offered and used by participants of the [[value chain]].&lt;ref name="Definition-I4.0" /&gt;

==Name==
The term "Industry 4.0", shortened to I4.0 or simply I4, originates from a project in the high-tech strategy of the [[German government]], which promotes the [[Digital Revolution|computerization]] of manufacturing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=BMBF-Internetredaktion |url=https://www.bmbf.de/de/zukunftsprojekt-industrie-4-0-848.html |title=Zukunftsprojekt Industrie 4.0 - BMBF |website=Bmbf.de |date=21 January 2016 |accessdate=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "Industry 4.0" was revived in 2011 at the [[Hannover Fair]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vdi-nachrichten.com/artikel/Industrie-4-0-Mit-dem-Internet-der-Dinge-auf-dem-Weg-zur-4-industriellen-Revolution/52570/1 |title=Industrie 4.0: Mit dem Internet der Dinge auf dem Weg zur 4. industriellen Revolution |language=de|website=Vdi-nachrichten.com |date=1 April 2011 |accessdate=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2012 the Working Group on Industry 4.0 presented a set of Industry 4.0 implementation recommendations to the German federal government. The Industry 4.0 workgroup members are recognized as the founding fathers and driving force behind Industry 4.0.

On 8 April 2013 at the Hannover Fair, the final report of the Working Group Industry 4.0 was presented.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plattform-i40.de Industrie 4.0 Plattform] Last download on 15. Juli 2013&lt;/ref&gt;. This working group was headed by Siegfried Dais (Robert Bosch GmbH) and Henning Kagermann (German Academy of Science and Engineering).

As Industry 4.0 principles have been applied by companies they have sometimes been re-branded, for example the aerospace parts manufacturer [[Meggitt PLC]] has branded its own Industry 4.0 research project M4. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aero-mag.com/meggitt-applied-research-technology-group-data-capture/ |title=Time to join the digital dots |language=en|accessdate=2018-07-25|date=2018-06-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Design principles ==
There are four design principles in Industry 4.0. These principles support companies in identifying and implementing Industry 4.0 scenarios.&lt;ref name="Definition-I4.0" /&gt;
* Interconnection: The ability of machines, devices, sensors, and people to connect and communicate with each other via the Internet of Things (IoT) or the Internet of People (IoP)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blog.viscosity.com/blog/what-is-industry-4.0-and-what-does-it-mean-for-my-manufacturing|title=What is Industry 4.0 and What Does it Mean for My Manufacturing?|last=Bonner|first=Mike|access-date=2018-09-24|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Information transparency: The transparency afforded by Industry 4.0 technology provides operators with vast amounts of useful information needed to make appropriate decisions. Interconnectivity allows operators to collect immense amounts of data and information from all points in the manufacturing process, thus aiding functionality and identifying key areas that can benefit from innovation and improvement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blog.viscosity.com/blog/what-is-industry-4.0-and-what-does-it-mean-for-my-manufacturing|title=What is Industry 4.0 and What Does it Mean for My Manufacturing?|last=Bonner|first=Mike|access-date=2018-09-24|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Technical assistance: First, the ability of assistance systems to support humans by aggregating and visualizing information comprehensively for making informed decisions and solving urgent problems on short notice. Second, the ability of cyber physical systems to physically support humans by conducting a range of tasks that are unpleasant, too exhausting, or unsafe for their human co-workers.
* Decentralized decisions: The ability of cyber physical systems to make decisions on their own and to perform their tasks as autonomously as possible. Only in the case of exceptions, interferences, or conflicting goals, are tasks delegated to a higher level.

== Meaning ==
Current usage of the term has been criticised as essentially meaningless, in particular on the grounds that technological innovation is continuous and the concept of a "revolution" in technology innovation is based on a lack of knowledge of the details.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/future_tense/2016/01/the_world_economic_forum_is_wrong_this_isn_t_the_fourth_industrial_revolution.html|title=This Is Not the Fourth Industrial Revolution|date=29 January 2016|publisher=|via=Slate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The characteristics given for the German government's Industry 4.0 strategy are: the strong customization of products under the conditions of highly flexible (mass-) production. The required automation technology is improved by the introduction of methods of self-optimization, self-configuration,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JtC3DAfLTxw  Selbstkonfiguierende Automation für Intelligente Technische Systeme], Video, last download on 27. Dezember 2012&lt;/ref&gt; self-diagnosis, cognition and intelligent support of workers in their increasingly complex work.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jürgen Jasperneite]]; Oliver, Niggemann: Intelligente Assistenzsysteme zur Beherrschung der Systemkomplexität in der Automation. In: ATP edition - Automatisierungstechnische Praxis, 9/2012, Oldenbourg Verlag, München, September 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The largest project in Industry 4.0 as of July 2013 is the [[Federal Ministry of Education and Research (Germany)|BMBF]] leading-edge cluster "Intelligent Technical Systems Ostwestfalen-Lippe (it's OWL)". Another major project is the BMBF project RES-COM,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.res-com-projekt.de/ |title=Herzlich willkommen auf den Internetseiten des Projekts RES-COM - RES-COM Webseite |website=Res-com-projekt.de |date= |accessdate=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the Cluster of Excellence "Integrative Production Technology for High-Wage Countries".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.production-research.de/ |title=RWTH AACHEN UNIVERSITY Cluster of Excellence "Integrative Production Technology for High-Wage Countries" - English |website=Production-research.de |date=19 October 2016 |accessdate=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the [[European Commission]] started the international [[Horizon 2020]] research project CREMA&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crema-project.eu |title=H2020 CREMA - Cloud-based Rapid Elastic Manufacturing |website=Crema-project.eu |date=21 November 2016 |accessdate=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Providing Cloud-based Rapid Elastic Manufacturing based on the [[XaaS]] and Cloud model) as a major initiative to foster the Industry 4.0 topic.

== Effects ==
In June 2013, consultancy firm McKinsey&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Markus Liffler |author2=Andreas Tschiesner |url=http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/business_technology/the_internet_of_things_and_the_future_of_manufacturing |title=The Internet of Things and the future of manufacturing &amp;#124; McKinsey &amp; Company |website=Mckinsey.com |date=6 January 2013 |accessdate=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; released an interview featuring an expert discussion between executives at Robert Bosch - Siegfried Dais (Partner of the Robert Bosch Industrietreuhand KG) and Heinz Derenbach (CEO of Bosch Software Innovations GmbH) - and McKinsey experts. This interview addressed the prevalence of the Internet of Things in manufacturing and the consequent technology-driven changes which promise to trigger a new industrial revolution. At Bosch, and generally in Germany, this phenomenon is referred to as Industry 4.0. The basic principle of Industry 4.0 is that by connecting machines, work pieces and systems, businesses are creating intelligent networks along the entire value chain that can control each other autonomously.

Some examples for Industry 4.0 are machines which can predict failures and trigger maintenance processes autonomously or self-organized logistics which react to unexpected changes in production.

According to Dais, "it is highly likely that the world of production will become more and more networked until everything is interlinked with everything else". While this sounds like a fair assumption and the driving force behind the Internet of Things, it also means that the complexity of production and supplier networks will grow enormously. Networks and processes have so far been limited to one factory. But in an Industry 4.0 scenario, these boundaries of individual factories will most likely no longer exist. Instead, they will be lifted in order to interconnect multiple factories or even geographical regions.

There are differences between a typical traditional factory and an Industry 4.0 factory. In the current industry environment, providing high-end quality service or product with the least cost is the key to success and industrial factories are trying to achieve as much performance as possible to increase their profit as well as their reputation. In this way, various data sources are available to provide worthwhile information about different aspects of the factory. In this stage, the utilization of data for understanding current operating conditions and detecting faults and failures is an important topic to research. e.g. in production, there are various commercial tools available to provide [[overall equipment effectiveness]] (OEE) information to factory management in order to highlight the [[Root cause analysis|root causes]] of problems and possible faults in the system. In contrast, in an Industry 4.0 factory, in addition to condition monitoring and fault diagnosis, components and systems are able to gain self-awareness and self-predictiveness, which will provide management with more insight on the status of the factory. Furthermore, peer-to-peer comparison and fusion of health information from various components provides a precise health prediction in component and system levels and force factory management to trigger required maintenance at the best possible time to reach just-in-time maintenance and gain near-zero downtime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Challenges and Requirements for the Application of Industry 4.0: A Special Insight with the Usage of Cyber-Physical System|journal=Chinese Journal of Mechanical Engineering|volume=30|issue=5|pages=1050–1057|doi=10.1007/s10033-017-0164-7|year = 2017|last1 = Mueller|first1 = Egon|last2=Chen|first2=Xiao-Li|last3=Riedel|first3=Ralph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During EDP Open [https://expresso.sapo.pt/inciativaseprodutos/edp-open-innovation/2018-10-18-Dias-de-Energia-o-caminho-faz-se-passeando#gs.AsfMTFQ Innovation] conducted in Oct 2018 at Lisbon, Portugal, Industry 4.0 conceptualization was extended by Sensfix B.V. a Dutch company with introduction of M2S terminology. It essentially is characterizing upcoming service industry to cater to millions of machines, managed by the machines themselves, fortunately using Artificial intelligence developed by humans!.

* IT security issues, which are greatly aggravated by the inherent need to open up those previously closed production shops
* Reliability and stability needed for critical machine-to-machine communication (M2M), including very short and stable latency times
* Need to maintain the integrity of production processes
* Need to avoid any IT snags, as those would cause expensive production outages
* Need to protect industrial know how (contained also in the control files for the industrial automation gear)
* Lack of adequate skill-sets to expedite the march towards fourth industrial revolution
* Threat of redundancy of the corporate IT department
* General reluctance to change by stakeholders
* Loss of many jobs to automatic processes and IT-controlled processes, especially for lower educated parts of society
* Low top management commitment
* Unclear legal issues and data security 
* Unclear economic benefits/ Excessive investment
* Lack of regulation, standard and forms of certifications
* Insufficient qualification of employees

== Role of big data and analytics ==

Modern information and communication technologies like [[cyber-physical system]], [[big data]] [[analytics]] and [[cloud computing]], will help early detection of defects and production failures, thus enabling their prevention and increasing productivity, quality, and agility benefits that have significant competitive value.

Big data analytics consists of 6Cs in the integrated Industry 4.0 and cyber physical systems environment.
The 6C system comprises:
# Connection (sensor and networks)
# Cloud (computing and data on demand)
# Cyber (model &amp; memory)
# Content/context (meaning and correlation)
# Community (sharing &amp; collaboration)
# Customization (personalization and value)
In this scenario and in order to provide useful insight to the factory management, data has to be processed with advanced tools (analytics and algorithms) to generate meaningful information. Considering the presence of visible and invisible issues in an industrial factory, the information generation algorithm has to be capable of detecting and addressing invisible issues such as machine degradation, component wear, etc. in the factory floor.&lt;ref name=INDIN2014&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lee|first1=Jay|last2=Bagheri|first2=Behrad|last3=Kao|first3=Hung-An|title=Recent Advances and Trends of Cyber-Physical Systems and Big Data Analytics in Industrial Informatics|journal=IEEE Int.

==Impact of Industry 4.0==
Proponents of the term claim Industry 4.0 will affect many areas, most notably:
# Services and business models
# Reliability and continuous productivity
# IT security: Companies like [[Symantec]], [[Cisco Systems|Cisco]], and [[Penta Security]] have already begun to address the issue of IoT security
# Machine safety
# Manufacturing Sales:  Companies like [https://www.logicbay.com/ LogicBay Corporation] have released multiple [https://www.logicbay.com/industry4.0 resources addressing Industry 4.0] in the manufacturing sales channel.
# Product lifecycles
# Industry value chain
# Workers' education and skills
# Socio-economic factors
# Industry Demonstration: To help industry understand the impact of Industry 4.0, [[Cincinnati]] Mayor John Cranley, signed a proclamation to state "Cincinnati to be Industry 4.0 Demonstration City".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imscenter.net/IMS_news/cincinnati-mayor-proclaimed-cincinnati-to-be-industry-4-0-demonstration-city|title=Cincinnati Mayor Proclaimed "Cincinnati to be Industry 4.0 Demonstration City"|last=|first=|date=|website=Imscenter.net|publisher=|access-date=2016-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# An article published in February 2016 suggests that Industry 4.0 may have a beneficial effects for emerging economies such as [[Economy of India|India]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Anil K. Rajvanshi]]|url=http://www.thequint.com/business/2016/02/24/india-can-gain-by-leapfrogging-into-fourth-industrial-revolution |title=India Can Gain By Leapfrogging Into Fourth Industrial Revolution |publisher=The Quint |date=24 February 2016 |accessdate=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The aerospace industry has sometimes been characterized as "too low volume for extensive automation" however Industry 4.0 principles have been investigated by several aerospace companies, technologies have been developed to improve productivity where the upfront cost of automation cannot be justified, one example of this is the aerospace parts manufacturer [[Meggitt PLC]]'s project, M4. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aero-mag.com/meggitt-applied-research-technology-group-data-capture/ |title=Time to join the digital dots |language=en|accessdate=2018-07-25|date=2018-06-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The discussion of how the shift to Industry 4.0, especially [[digitalization]], will affect the labour market is being discussed in [[Germany]] under the topic of [[Work 4.0]].&lt;ref&gt;Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs of Germany (2015). ''Re-Imagining Work: White Paper Work 4.0''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Organization for Standardization''' ('''ISO''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|aɪ|s|oʊ}}) is an [[international standard]]-setting body composed of representatives from various national [[standards organization]]s.

Founded on 23 February 1947, the organization promotes worldwide proprietary, industrial and commercial [[International standard|standards]]. It is headquartered in [[Geneva]], Switzerland,&lt;ref name="About_ISO"&gt;{{cite web |title=About ISO |publisher=ISO |url=http://www.iso.org/iso/about.htm |deadurl=no |archivedate=4 October 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071004201243/http://www.iso.org/iso/about.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; and works in 162 countries.&lt;ref name="ISO_members" /&gt;

It was one of the first organizations granted [[List of organizations with consultative status to the United Nations Economic and Social Council|general consultative status with the United Nations Economic and Social Council]].

==Overview==
The International Organization for Standardization is an independent, non-governmental organization, the members of which are the standards organizations of the 168&lt;ref name="ISO_members" /&gt; member countries. It is the world's largest developer of voluntary international standards and facilitates world trade by providing common standards between nations. Over twenty thousand standards have been set covering everything from manufactured products and technology to food safety, agriculture and healthcare.&lt;ref name="About_ISO"/&gt;

Use of the standards aids in the creation of products and services that are safe, reliable and of good quality. The standards help businesses increase productivity while minimizing errors and waste. By enabling products from different markets to be directly compared, they facilitate companies in entering new markets and assist in the development of global trade on a fair basis. The standards also serve to safeguard consumers and the end-users of products and services, ensuring that certified products conform to the minimum standards set internationally.&lt;ref name="About_ISO"/&gt;

==Language usage==
The three official languages of the ISO are [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], and [[Russian language|Russian]].&lt;ref name="languages"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/how_to_use_the_catalogue.htm |title=How to use the ISO Catalogue |publisher=ISO.org |deadurl=yes |archivedate=4 October 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071004225623/http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/how_to_use_the_catalogue.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Name and abbreviations ==
The name of the organization in French is ''{{lang|fr|Organisation internationale de normalisation}}'', and in Russian, {{lang|ru|Международная организация по стандартизации}} (''{{transl|ru|Mezhdunarodnaya organizatsiya po standartizatsii}}'').  ''ISO'' is not an [[acronym]]. The organization adopted ''ISO'' as its abbreviated name in reference to the Greek word ''{{transl|grc|isos}}'' ({{lang|grc|ίσος}}, meaning "equal"),&lt;ref name="about_iso"&gt;{{cite web |title=About ISO|publisher=ISO |url=http://www.iso.org/iso/home/about.htm#2012_aboutiso_iso_name-text-Anchor |deadurl=no |archivedate=19 September 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120919212143/http://www.iso.org/iso/home/about.htm#2012_aboutiso_iso_name-text-Anchor}}&lt;/ref&gt; as its name in the three official languages would have different acronyms. During the founding meetings of the new organization, the Greek word explanation was not invoked, so this meaning may have been made public later.&lt;ref name="iso_name"&gt;{{cite web |title=Friendship among equals |publisher=ISO |url=http://www.iso.org/iso/2012_friendship_among_equals.pdf}} (page 20)&lt;/ref&gt;

ISO gives this explanation of the name: "Because 'International Organization for Standardization' would have different acronyms in different languages (IOS in English, OIN in French), our founders decided to give it the short form ''ISO''. ''ISO'' is derived from the Greek ''{{transl|grc|isos}}'', meaning equal. Whatever the country, whatever the language, the short form of our name is always ''ISO''."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iso.org/about-us.html|title=About us|website=www.iso.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the name ''ISO'' and the ISO logo are registered trademarks, and their use is restricted.&lt;ref name="iso_logo"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iso.org/iso/home/name_and_logo.htm |title=ISO name and logo |publisher=ISO |deadurl=no |archivedate=19 September 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120919222138/http://www.iso.org/iso/home/name_and_logo.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These sources contradict ref #1.|date=March 2017}} as the International Federation of the National Standardizing Associations (ISA).

In October 1946, ISA and UNSCC delegates from 25 countries met in London and agreed to join forces to create the new International Organization for Standardization; the new organization officially began operations in February&amp;nbsp;1947.&lt;ref name="50_years"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.iso.org/iso/2012_friendship_among_equals.pdf |format=PDF |title=Friendship among equals – Recollections from ISO's first fifty years |publisher=International Organization for Standardization |year=1997 |isbn=92-67-10260-5 |pages=15–18 |deadurl=no |archivedate=26 October 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121026060448/http://www.iso.org/iso/2012_friendship_among_equals.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure ==

ISO is a voluntary organization whose members are recognized authorities on standards, each one representing one country. Members meet annually at a General Assembly to discuss ISO's strategic objectives. The organization is coordinated by a Central Secretariat based in [[Geneva]].&lt;ref name="ISOStructureAndGovernance"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iso.org/iso/home/about/about_governance.htm |title=Structure and governance |publisher=International Organization for Standardization |deadurl=no |archivedate=19 September 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120919222955/http://www.iso.org/iso/home/about/about_governance.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Council with a rotating membership of 20 member bodies provides guidance and governance, including setting the Central Secretariat's annual budget.&lt;ref name="ISOStructureAndGovernance"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tech_ctte_list"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards_development/list_of_iso_technical_committees/iso_technical_committee.htm?commid=55010 |title=Council |publisher=International Organization for Standardization |deadurl=no |archivedate=3 November 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103211437/http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards_development/list_of_iso_technical_committees/iso_technical_committee.htm?commid=55010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===IEC joint committees===
ISO has formed two joint committees with the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] (IEC) to develop standards and terminology in the areas of electrical and electronic related technologies.

====ISO/IEC JTC 1====
{{main|ISO/IEC JTC 1}}
ISO/IEC Joint Technical Committee 1 (JTC 1) was created in 1987 to "[d]evelop, maintain, promote and facilitate IT standards",&lt;ref name="jtc1_home"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iso.org/iso/jtc1_home |title=ISO/IEC JTC 1 |publisher=International Organization for Standardization |deadurl=no |archivedate=15 December 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111215062549/http://www.iso.org/iso/jtc1_home}}&lt;/ref&gt; where IT refers to information technology.

====ISO/IEC JTC 2====
ISO/IEC Joint Technical Committee 2 (JTC 2) was created in 2009 for the purpose of "[s]tandardization in the field of energy efficiency and renewable energy sources".&lt;ref name="iso_list_tech"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards_development/list_of_iso_technical_committees/iso_technical_committee.htm?commid=585141 |title=ISO/IEC JPC 2 Joint Project Committee – Energy efficiency and renewable energy sources – Common terminology |publisher=International Organization for Standardization |deadurl=no |archivedate=6 October 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121006120431/http://www.iso.org/iso/home/standards_development/list_of_iso_technical_committees/iso_technical_committee.htm?commid=585141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Membership ==
{{Further information|Countries in the International Organization for Standardization}}
[[File:ISO Members.svg|thumb|upright=1.9|{{legend|#4444ff|ISO member countries with a national standards body and ISO voting rights.}} {{legend|#ffff00|Correspondent members (countries without a national standards body).}} {{legend|#ff0000|Subscriber members (countries with small economies). }}]]
ISO has 162 [[Countries in International Organization for Standardization|national members]].&lt;ref name="ISO_members" /&gt;

ISO has three membership categories:&lt;ref name="ISO_members"/&gt;
* ''Member bodies'' are national bodies considered the most representative standards body in each country. These are the only members of ISO that have voting rights.
* ''Correspondent members'' are countries that do not have their own standards organization. These members are informed about ISO's work, but do not participate in standards promulgation.
* ''Subscriber members'' are countries with small economies. They pay reduced membership fees, but can follow the development of standards.

Participating members are called "P" members, as opposed to observing members, who are called "O" members.

== Financing ==
ISO is funded by a combination of:&lt;ref name="iso_general"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iso.org/iso/support/faqs/faqs_general_information_on_iso.htm |title=General information on ISO |publisher=ISO |deadurl=no |archivedate=5 October 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071005105014/http://www.iso.org/iso/support/faqs/faqs_general_information_on_iso.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Organizations that manage the specific projects or loan experts to participate in the technical work.
* Subscriptions from member bodies. These subscriptions are in proportion to each country's [[gross national product]] and trade figures.
* Sale of standards.

== {{anchor|Standards}}International Standards and other publications ==
{{see also|List of International Organization for Standardization standards}}
ISO's main products are international standards. ISO also publishes technical reports, technical specifications, publicly available specifications, technical [[Erratum|corrigenda]], and guides.&lt;!--
     --&gt;&lt;ref name="ISOUS95IECUS95directives2004"&gt;The ISO directives are published in two distinct parts:

'''International standards'''
: These are designated using the format ''ISO[/IEC] [/ASTM] [IS] nnnnn[-p]:[yyyy] Title'', where ''nnnnn'' is the number of the standard, ''p'' is an optional part number, ''yyyy'' is the year published, and ''Title'' describes the subject. ''IEC'' for ''[[International Electrotechnical Commission]]'' is included if the standard results from the work of ISO/IEC JTC1 (the ISO/IEC Joint Technical Committee). ''ASTM'' (American Society for Testing and Materials) is used for standards developed in cooperation with [[ASTM International]]. ''yyyy'' and ''IS'' are not used for an incomplete or unpublished standard and may under some circumstances be left off the title of a published work.

'''Technical reports'''
: These are issued when a technical committee or subcommittee has collected data of a different kind from that normally published as an International Standard,&lt;ref name="ISOUS95IECUS95directives2004"/&gt; such as references and explanations. The naming conventions for these are the same as for standards, except ''TR'' prepended instead of ''IS'' in the report's name.&lt;br/&gt;For example:
* ISO/IEC TR 17799:2000 Code of Practice for Information Security Management
* ISO/TR 19033:2000 Technical product documentation — Metadata for construction documentation

'''Technical and publicly available specifications'''
: Technical specifications may be produced when "the subject in question is still under development or where for any other reason there is the future but not immediate possibility of an agreement to publish an International Standard". A publicly available specification is usually "an intermediate specification, published prior to the development of a full International Standard, or, in IEC may be a 'dual logo' publication published in collaboration with an external organization".&lt;ref name="ISOUS95IECUS95directives2004"/&gt; By convention, both types of specification are named in a manner similar to the organization's technical reports.&lt;br/&gt;For example:
* ISO/TS 16952-1:2006 Technical product documentation — Reference designation system — Part 1: General application rules
* ISO/PAS 11154:2006 Road vehicles — Roof load carriers

'''Technical corrigenda'''
: ISO also sometimes issues "technical corrigenda" (where "corrigenda" is the plural of [[Erratum|corrigendum]]). These are amendments made to existing standards due to minor technical flaws, usability improvements, or limited-applicability extensions. They are generally issued with the expectation that the affected standard will be updated or withdrawn at its next scheduled review.&lt;ref name="ISOUS95IECUS95directives2004"/&gt;

'''ISO guides'''
These are meta-standards covering "matters related to international standardization".&lt;ref name="ISOUS95IECUS95directives2004"/&gt; They are named using the format ''"ISO[/IEC] Guide N:yyyy: Title"''.&lt;br/&gt;For example:
* ISO/IEC Guide 2:2004 Standardization and related activities — General vocabulary
* ISO/IEC Guide 65:1996 General requirements for bodies operating product certification

===Document copyright===
ISO documents are copyrighted and ISO charges for most copies. It does not, however, charge for most draft copies of documents in electronic format. Although they are useful, care must be taken using these drafts as there is the possibility of substantial change before they become finalized as standards. Some standards by ISO and its official U.S. representative (and, via the U.S. National Committee, the [[International Electrotechnical Commission]]) are made freely available.&lt;ref name="FreelyAvailableStandards"&gt;{{cite web |title=Freely Available Standards |publisher=ISO |date=1 February 2011 |url=http://standards.iso.org/ittf/PubliclyAvailableStandards/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="free_ansi"&gt;{{cite web |title=Free ANSI Standards |url=http://webstore.ansi.org/ansidocstore/free_standards.asp |deadurl=yes |archivedate=3 April 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070403014457/http://webstore.ansi.org/ansidocstore/free_standards.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Standardization process ==
A standard published by ISO/IEC is the last stage of a long process that commonly starts with the proposal of new work within a committee.

It is possible to omit certain stages, if there is a document with a certain degree of maturity at the start of a standardization project, for example a standard developed by another organization. ISO/IEC directives allow also the so-called "Fast-track procedure". In this procedure a document is submitted directly for approval as a draft International Standard (DIS) to the ISO member bodies or as a final draft International Standard (FDIS) if the document was developed by an international standardizing body recognized by the ISO Council.&lt;ref name="iso-stages"/&gt;

The first step—a proposal of work (New Proposal) is approved at the relevant subcommittee or technical committee (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;SC29 and JTC1 respectively in the case of [[Moving Picture Experts Group]] – ISO/IEC JTC1/SC29/WG11). A working group (WG) of experts is set up by the TC/SC for the preparation of a working draft. When the scope of a new work is sufficiently clarified, some of the working groups (e.g.,&amp;nbsp;MPEG) usually make open request for proposals—known as a "call for proposals". The first document that is produced for example for audio and video coding standards is called a verification model&amp;nbsp;(VM) (previously also called a "simulation and test model"). When a sufficient confidence in the stability of the standard under development is reached, a working draft&amp;nbsp;(WD) is produced. This is in the form of a standard but is kept internal to working group for revision. When a working draft is sufficiently solid and the working group is satisfied that it has developed the best technical solution to the problem being addressed, it becomes committee draft&amp;nbsp;(CD). If it is required, it is then sent to the P-members of the TC/SC (national bodies) for ballot.

The CD becomes final committee draft (FCD) if the number of positive votes is above the quorum. Successive committee drafts may be considered until consensus is reached on the technical content. When it is reached, the text is finalized for submission as a draft International Standard (DIS). The text is then submitted to national bodies for voting and comment within a period of five months. It is approved for submission as a final draft International Standard&amp;nbsp;(FDIS) if a two-thirds majority of the P-members of the TC/SC are in favour and not more than one-quarter of the total number of votes cast are negative. ISO will then hold a ballot with National Bodies where no technical changes are allowed (yes/no ballot), within a period of two months. It is approved as an International Standard&amp;nbsp;(IS) if a two-thirds majority of the P-members of the TC/SC is in favour and not more than one-quarter of the total number of votes cast are negative. After approval, only minor editorial changes are introduced into the final text. The final text is sent to the ISO Central Secretariat, which publishes it as the International Standard.&lt;ref name="about-mpeg"/&gt;&lt;ref name="iso-stages"/&gt;

== Products named after ISO ==

The fact that many of the ISO-created standards are ubiquitous has led, on occasion, to common use of "ISO" to describe the actual product that conforms to a standard. Some examples of this are:
* Many [[CD image]]s end in the [[file extension]] "[[ISO image|ISO]]" to signify that they are using the [[ISO&amp;nbsp;9660]] standard file system as opposed to another file system—hence CD&amp;nbsp;images are commonly referred to as "ISOs".

== Criticism ==

With the exception of a small number of isolated standards,&lt;ref name="FreelyAvailableStandards"/&gt; ISO standards are normally not available free of charge, but for a purchase fee,&lt;ref name="iso_shopFAQ"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iso.org/iso/store/shopping_faqs.htm |title=Shopping FAQs |publisher=ISO |deadurl=no |archivedate=5 October 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071005054552/http://www.iso.org/iso/store/shopping_faqs.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has been seen by some as too expensive for small [[Open-source model|open source]] projects.&lt;ref name="oreilly2007"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.oreillynet.com/xml/blog/2007/08/where_to_get_iso_standards_on.html |title=Where to get ISO Standards on the Internet free |publisher=oreillynet.com |last=Jelliffe |first=Rick |quote=''The lack of free online availability has effectively made ISO standard irrelevant to the (home/hacker section of the) Open Source community'' |date=1 August 2007 |deadurl=no |archivedate=24 November 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071124060422/http://www.oreillynet.com/xml/blog/2007/08/where_to_get_iso_standards_on.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[ISO/IEC JTC1]] fast-track procedures ("Fast-track" as used by [[Office Open XML|OOXML]] and "PAS" as used by [[OpenDocument]]) have garnered criticism in relation to the [[standardization of Office Open XML]] (ISO/IEC&amp;nbsp;29500). Martin Bryan, outgoing Convenor of [[ISO/IEC JTC1/SC34]] WG1, is quoted as saying:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I would recommend my successor that it is perhaps time to pass WG1’s outstanding standards over to OASIS, where they can get approval in less than a year and then do a PAS submission to ISO, which will get a lot more attention and be approved much faster than standards currently can be within WG1.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The disparity of rules for PAS, Fast-Track and ISO committee generated standards is fast making ISO a laughing stock in IT circles. The days of open standards development are fast disappearing. Instead we are getting 'standardization by corporation'.&lt;ref name="jtc1_sc34_0940"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jtc1sc34.org/repository/0940.htm |title=Report on WG1 activity for December 2007 Meeting of ISO/IEC JTC1/SC34/WG1 in Kyoto |publisher=iso/jtc1 sc34 |deadurl=no |archivedate=12 August 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070812081252/http://www.jtc1sc34.org/repository/0940.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Computer security entrepreneur and [[Ubuntu (operating system)|Ubuntu]] investor, [[Mark Shuttleworth]], commented on the [[Standardization of Office Open XML]] process by saying "I think it de-values the confidence people have in the standards setting process," and Shuttleworth alleged that ISO did not carry out its responsibility. He also noted that [[Microsoft]] had intensely lobbied many countries that traditionally had not participated in ISO and stacked technical committees with Microsoft employees, solution providers and resellers sympathetic to Office Open XML.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
When you have a process built on trust and when that trust is abused, ISO should halt the process... ISO is an engineering [[Good ol' boy|old boys club]] and these things are boring so you have to have a lot of passion … then suddenly you have an investment of a lot of money and lobbying and you get artificial results. The process is not set up to deal with intensive corporate [[lobbying]] and so you end up with something being a standard that is not clear.&lt;ref name="zdnet_2222"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.zdnet.com/open-source/?p=2222 |title=Ubuntu’s Shuttleworth blames ISO for OOXML’s win |publisher=ZDNet.com |date=1 April 2008 |deadurl=yes |archivedate=4 April 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080404052723/http://blogs.zdnet.com/open-source/?p=2222 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Investment-specific technological progress''' refers to progress that requires investment in new equipment and structures embodying the latest technology in order to realize its benefits.

==Introduction==
To model how something is [[Production theory basics|produced]], think of a box that in one end takes in inputs such as [[Labour (economics)|labor]] (employees) and [[Capital (economics)|capital]] (equipment, buildings, etc.) and in another end spits out the [[final good]]. With this picture in mind now one can ask, how does technological progress affect production? One way of thinking is that technological progress affects ''specific'' inputs (arrows going in) such as equipment and buildings. To realize the benefits of such [[technological change]] for production, these inputs must be purchased. So for example, the advent of the [[Integrated circuit|microchip]] (an important technological improvement in computers) will affect the production of [[Ford]] cars only if Ford Motor Co.'s assembly plants (the red box) invest in [[computers]] with microchips (instead of computers with [[punched cards]]) and use them (they are one of the arrows going in the box) in the production of [[Ford Mustang|Mustangs]] (the arrow coming out). As the name suggests, this is ''investment-specific'' technological progress---it requires investing in new [[machines]] or buildings which contain or ''embody'' the latest technology. Notice that the term ''investment'' can be general: not only must a [[business|firm]] buy the new technology to reap its benefits, but it also must invest in training its workers and [[management|managers]] to be able to use this new technology (Greenwood &amp; Jovanovic 2001) .

==Importance==
Identifying ''investment-specific'' technological progress is important, because knowing what type of technological progress is operating in an [[economy]] will determine how someone (should) want his or her [[tax]] dollars to be spent and how he or she may want to invest his or her [[savings]] (Gort et al. 1999). If "investment-specific" technological change is the main source of progress, then one would want his or her dollars spent on helping firms buy new equipment and renovate their plants, because these investments will improve production and hence what you consume. Furthermore, one may want to help pay for current employee training in using new technologies (to keep them up to date) or subsidize the education of new employees (who will enter the job market knowing how to use the new technology). So, the type of technological progress will also matter for unemployment and education issues. Finally, if technological progress is "investment-specific" you may want to direct your money towards the research and development (R &amp; D) of new technologies (like quantum computers or alternative energy sources) (Krusell 1998).

More generally, why is any type of technological progress important? Technological change has made our lives easier. Because of technological progress, people can work less, make more money and enjoy more leisure time (Greenwood &amp; Vandenbroucke 2006). Women have been able to break away from the traditional "[[housewife]]" role, join the labor-force in greater numbers (Greenwood et al. 2005) and become less economically dependent on men (Greenwood &amp; Guner 2009). Finally, technological progress has been shown to affect the fall in [[child labor]] starting around 1900 (Greenwood &amp; Seshadri 2005). Figure 1 illustrates this last point: in 1900 child labor's share of the paid labor force began to fall.

[[Image:kid1.jpg|thumb|400px|center|Figure 1]]

==A simple example: the microwave oven==
An example of investment-specific technological progress is the [[microwave oven]]. The idea of the microwave came to be by accident: in 1946 an engineer noticed that a [[candy bar]] in his pocket had melted while working on something completely unrelated to cooking (Gallawa 2005). The development of this good, from melting the candy bar to the home appliance we know today, took time and the investment of resources to make a microwave small and cheap. The first microwave oven cost between 2000 and 3000 dollars and was housed in refrigerator-sized cabinets (Gallawa 2005)! Today, almost any college student can enjoy a 3-minute microwaveable meal in the smallest dorm room. But a microwave's uses do not stop at the dorm room. Many industries have found microwave heating advantageous: it has been used to dry cork, ceramics, paper, leather, and so on (Gallawa 2005). However, for either college students or firms to reap the benefits of quick warming, they must first "invest" in a microwave oven (that "embodies" the technological advance). To realize the benefits of investment-specific technological progress you must first invest in a technology that embodies it.

==Measurement==
While measuring technological progress is not easy, economists have found indirect ways of estimating it. If "'investment-specific'" technological progress makes producing goods easier, then the price of the goods affected (relative to the price of other goods) should decrease. In particular, "investment-specific" technological advance has affected the prices of two inputs into the production process: equipment and structures. Think of equipment as machines (like computers) and structures as buildings. If there is technological progress in the production (or creation) of these goods, then one would expect the price of them to fall or the value of them to rise relative to older versions of the same good.

Figure 2 (the pink line) shows how the price of new producer durables (such as equipment) in the US relative to the price of new consumer nondurables (like clothing) has consistently declined over the past fifty years (Gort et al. 1999). To calculate the relative price of producer durables divide the price that firms pay (for the durable inputs of production) by the price that a regular consumer pays (for things like [[jeans]]). We use relative prices so we can say how many units of equipment can be bought instead (or in terms) of buying one unit of consumer goods. Figure 3 (the pink line) says that over time, firms have been able to buy more and more units of equipment instead of one unit of consumption, especially when we take into account that the quality of equipment being acquired has increased (a computer today is much faster than a computer five years ago and we should take that into account when comparing their prices). When changes in quality are not taken into account (which is wrong) it looks like the price of equipment has not decreased as much (see the black line in Figure 2).

[[File:Investment-specific technological progress - Figure 2.jpg|thumb|400px|center|Figure 2]]

Measuring the price of structures is more complicated than measuring the price of equipment, but economists have again been able to get an idea of how much progress there has been in structures (such as buildings). One approach is that if newer buildings were constructed or designed using newer technologies then they should be worth more than older buildings (because they '''embody''' the new technology (Gort et al. 1999). In particular, they should rent for more. As Figure 3 shows, this is true. Renting a square foot in a new building is much more expensive than renting a square foot in a building forty years old. So it must be the case that you are paying for a nicer, more functional and maybe even safer building.

[[Image:figure4.jpg|thumb|400px|center|Figure 3]]
Figures 2 and 3 suggest that '''investment-specific''' technological change is operating in the US. The annual rate of technological progress in equipment and structures has been estimated to be about 3.2% and 1%, respectively (Gort et al. 1999) (Greenwood et al. 1997).

==Conclusion==
In the second section it was mentioned that "investment-specific" technological change is important since it will affect production (both in quality and size). An important question then is, just how much "bang for your buck" do you get with "investment-specific" technological change? The answer is quite astounding; economists have found that 37% of growth in US output (production) is due to technological progress in equipment and 15% is due to technological progress in structures (Gort et al. 1999) (Greenwood et al. 1997). All in all, more than half (37% + 15% = 52%) of the growth of the US economy is due to "investment-specific" technological change (Gort et al. 1999) (Greenwood et al. 1997).

'''Jameco Electronics''' is an American [[electronic component]] and tool distributor. It was founded in 1974 by Dennis Farrey in [[Silicon Valley]], [[San Francisco]], [[California]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Jameco Electronics - About Us|url = http://www.jameco.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/PageDisplayView?langId=-1&amp;storeId=10001&amp;catalogId=10001&amp;content=about|website = www.jameco.com|accessdate = 2015-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is currently headquartered in [[Belmont, California|Belmont]], California, where it also operates a [[brick and mortar]] store.

== History ==
Jameco is family owned, with James Farrey, the son of founder and first CEO David Farrey becoming the company's second CEO in 2010. He had worked within the company since 1983, and in 2009 was named [[Chief operating officer|COO]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = James Farrey Named CEO of Electronic Components Distributor Jameco Electronics|url = http://www.marketwired.com/press-release/james-farrey-named-ceo-of-electronic-components-distributor-jameco-electronics-1164717.htm|website = Marketwire|accessdate = 2015-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hobbyist community ==
A smaller operation relative to its competitors in the industry, the company nonetheless enjoys significant popularity in the [[Maker culture|electronic hobbyist community]] and in 2011 they launched a [http://www.clubjameco.com "Club Jameco"] program in which hobbyists can create kits, and, if they are popular, sell them to other hobbyists. If a kit is chosen for a production run by the company, the creator can earn a small royalty on its sales. 

In 2015, the company conducted a study among its customers, dubbed 'The Great American Electronics Hobbyist Census'. The study reported on the growth of the electronic hobbyist community, attributed by participants to the growing affordability and availability of electronic components online. The study also found that half of those interviewed had no professional experience with the industry. It also observed a proportion of only 2% female respondents identifying as hobbyists, even though 19% of engineering students are female.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20150602005278/en/Jameco-Electronics-Hobbyist-Study-Electronics-Skills-Critical|title = Jameco Electronics Hobbyist Study: Electronics Skills Are Critical to Fueling American Economy {{!}} Business Wire|website = www.businesswire.com|access-date = 2016-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''landfill liner''', or '''composite liner''', is intended to be a low permeable barrier, which is laid down under engineered [[landfill]] sites. Until it deteriorates, the liner retards migration of [[leachate]], and its toxic constituents, into underlying [[aquifer]]s or nearby rivers, causing spoliation of the local water.

Modern landfills generally require a layer of compacted [[clay]] with a minimum required thickness and a maximum allowable [[hydraulic conductivity]], overlaid by a [[high-density polyethylene]] [[geomembrane]].

The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] has stated that the barriers "will ultimately fail," while the site remains a threat for "thousands of years," suggesting that modern landfill designs delay but do not prevent ground and surface water pollution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gfredlee.com/Landfills/NRC_EngrBarriers.pdf gfredlee.com] -
National Research Council of the National Academies (2007): ''Assessment of the Performance of Engineered Waste Containment Barriers''. Committee to Assess the Performance of Engineered Barriers. Washington DC.&lt;/ref&gt;

Chipped or [[waste tires]] are used to support and insulate the liner.&lt;ref&gt;Benson, C. H., Olson, M. A. &amp; Bergstrom, W. R. (1996) [http://pubsindex.trb.org/document/view/default.asp?lbid=468017 Temperatures of Insulated Landfill Liner], p24-31&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
There are certain levels of harmfulness in which the different types of trash have; therefore, there are different types of liner systems which are required for these different types of disposal sites. The first type is single liner-systems. These systems usually are put within landfills which mostly hold construction rubble. These landfills are not meant to hold the disposal of harmful liquid wastes such as paint, tar, or any other type of liquid garbage that can easily seep through a single liner system. The second type is [[double-liner]] systems. These systems are usually found in municipal solid waste landfills as well all hazardous waste landfills. The first part is constructed to collect the leachate while the second layer is engineered to be a leak-detection system to ensure that no contaminates leak into the ground and contaminate everything.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, Kerry L. "Ohio State University Fact Sheet." Landfill Types and Liner Systems, CDFS-138-05 (2005). Retrieved from the website: http://ohioline.osu.edu/cd-fact/0138.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Components==
Composite liners are required to be used in municipal solid waste systems for [[landfills]] and use a double liner system which is composed of a [[leachate]] system which is a liquid that collects solids from the substance this is passed through it. The leachate system is surrounded in a by a type of solid drainage layer such as gravel which is enclosed by a geomembrane and compressed clay, also known as a [[geosynthetic clay liner]]. This geosynthetic clay liner is usually made of sodium bentonite which is compacted in between two thick pieces of geotextile. The next material surrounding the composite liner would be a leak detection system composed of another material like gravel with an additional geomembrane or complex liner.&lt;ref&gt;Composite liners improve landfill performance. (1997). Civil Engineering (08857024), 67(12), 18.
&lt;/ref&gt; The geomembranes within the composite liner consist of a high-density polyethylene which provide an effective minimization for flow and deliver and helpful barrier which is used on inorganic contaminants.&lt;ref&gt;Rowe, R., &amp; Rimal, S. S. (2008). Depletion of Antioxidants from an HDPE Geomembrane in a Composite Liner. Journal of Geotechnical &amp; Geoenvironmental Engineering, 134(1), 68-78. doi:10.1061/(ASCE)1090-0241(2008)134:1(68)&lt;/ref&gt; It can be used as a substitute for sand or gravel and also has a very high transmissivity and low storage. The lower surface helps provide an effective leak test once correctly installed. It is also a low permeable vapor and liquid barrier. The geosynthetic clay liners are manufactured by factories and the purpose for it being made of sodium [[bentonite]] is that they regulate the movement of liquids in gases within the waste.&lt;ref&gt;Scalia, J., &amp; Benson, C. H. (2011). Hydraulic Conductivity of Geosynthetic Clay Liners Exhumed from Landfill Final Covers with Composite Barriers. Journal of Geotechnical &amp; Geoenvironmental Engineering, 137(1), 1-13. doi:10.1061/(ASCE)GT.1943-5606.0000407
&lt;/ref&gt; The geocomposites which are a combination of the geomembranes and geosynthetic liner material also include a layer of bentonite between the middle of the layers of geotextile; however, airspace is allowed to be implemented. It is then topped off with a final cover.

==How it works==
The main role a composite liner has for a municipal solid waste system for landfills is that is reduces the amount of leakage through small seep holes that sometimes form in the geomembrane part of the composite liner. The protection layer part serves as a preventer from these holes from forming inside the geomembrane which would allow the waste to leak through the entire liner(awkward sentence consider rewording). It also takes away the pressure and stress which can cause cracking and holes from forming in the membrane as well.&lt;ref&gt;Dickinson, S. S., &amp; Brachman, R. I. (2008). Assessment of alternative protection layers for a [[geomembrane]] – geosynthetic clay liner (GM–GCL) composite liner. Canadian Geotechnical Journal, 45(11), 1594-1610.&lt;/ref&gt; An effective liner in a landfill system should be able to control water in terms of movement and protection on the environment. It should be able to regulate the flow away from the waste area and withhold the waste contents as it enters the actual landfill. Due to the effectiveness on how landfills are placed on top of slopes in order for the water to stream downhill and in an emergency, into the actual landfill. Water moves through the landfill and downward through the composite liner. The main purpose for all of this is so that the movement is lateral which lessens the probability for slope catastrophe and  the waste leaking down and freely contaminating whatever is in its path. The final cover functions as a way to keep the water out of the contaminate and to control the runoff from entering the system. This helps prevent plants and animals from being harmed by the waste contaminated water,leachate. Using gravity and pumps the leachate is able to be pushed to a [[sump]] where it is removed by a pump. When developing composite liners it is extremely important to take in risk factors such as earthquakes and other slope failure problems that could occur.&lt;ref&gt;O'Leary, P., &amp; Walsh, P. (2002). Landfill cover and liner systems for water quality protection. Waste Age, 33(4), 124-129. Retrieved from http://search.proquest.com/docview/219247584&lt;/ref&gt; 
'''Composite liner'''s are used in [[municipal solid waste]] (MSW) [[landfill]]s to reduce [[water pollution]].  A composite liner is made of a [[geomembrane]] along with a [[geosynthetic clay liner]].  Composite-liner systems are better at reducing [[leachate]] migration into the [[subsoil]] than either a clay liner or a single geomembrane layer.&lt;ref name="TITLE 40 part 258"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2012-title40-vol26/xml/CFR-2012-title40-vol26-part258.xml |title=PART 258 - CRITERIA FOR MUNICIPAL SOLID WASTE LANDFILLS |publisher=gpo.gov }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mechanical properties ==
The primary forms of mechanical degradation associated with geomembranes result from insufficient tensile strength, tear resistance, impact resistance, puncture resistance, and susceptibility to environmental stress cracking (ESC).  The ideal method of assessing the amount of liner degradation would be by examining field samples over their service life.  Due to the lengths of time required for field sampling tests, various laboratory-accelerated ageing tests have been developed to measure the important mechanical properties.&lt;ref&gt;Rowe, R. Kerry, S Rimal, and S Rimal. 2008. Aging of HDPE Geomembrane in Three Composite Landfill Liner Configurations. Journal of Geotechnical &amp; Geoenvironmental Engineering. 134, no. 7: 906-916.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tensile strength ===
Tensile strength represents the ability for a geomembrane to resist tensile stress.  Geomembranes are most commonly tested for tensile strength using one of three methods; the uniaxial tensile test described in ASTM D639-94, the wide-strip tensile test described in ASTM D4885-88, and the multiaxial tension test described in ASTM D5617-94.  The difference in these three methods lies in the boundaries imposed into the test specimens.  Uniaxial tests do not provide lateral restraint during testing and thus tests the sample under uniaxial stress conditions.  During the wide-strip test the sample is restrained laterally while the middle portion is unrestrained.  The multiaxial tensile test provides a plane stress boundary condition at the edges of the sample.&lt;ref&gt;Wesseloo, J, AT Visser, and E Rust. 2004. A Mathematical Model for the Strain-rate Dependent Stress-strain Response of HDPE Geomembranes. Geotextiles and Geomembranes. 22, no. 4: 273-295.&lt;/ref&gt;  A typical range of tensile strengths in the machine direction are from 225 to 245&amp;nbsp;lb/in for 60-mil HDPE to 280 to 325&amp;nbsp;lb/in for 80-mil HDPE.&lt;ref name="sharma"&gt;Sharma, Hari and Reddy, Krishna. 2004. Geoenvironmental Engineering: Site Remediation, Waste Containment, and Emerging Waste Management Technologies. John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., Hoboken, New Jersey.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tear resistance ===
Tear resistance of a geomembrane becomes important when it is exposed to high winds or handling stress during installation.  There are various ASTM methods for measuring tear resistance of geomembranes, with most common reports using ASTM D1004.  Typical tear resistances show a value of 40 to 45&amp;nbsp;lb for 60-mil HDPE and 50 to 60&amp;nbsp;lb for 80-mil HDPE.&lt;ref name="sharma"/&gt;

=== Impact resistance ===
Impact resistance provides an assessment of the effects of impacts from falling objects which can either tear or weaken the geomembrane.  As with the previous mechanical properties, there are various ASTM methods for assessment.  Significantly higher impact resistances are realized when [[geotextiles]] are placed above or below the [[geomembrane]].  Thicker geomembranes also display higher impact resistances.&lt;ref name="sharma"/&gt;

=== Puncture resistance ===
Puncture resistance of a geomembrane is important due to the heterogeneous material above and below a typical liner.  Rough surfaces, such as stones or other sharp objects, may puncture a membrane if it does not have sufficient puncture resistance.  Various methods beyond standard ASTM tests are available; one such method, the critical cone height test, measures the maximum height of a cone on which a compressed geomembrane, which is subjected to increasing pressure, does not fail.  HDPE samples typically have a critical cone height of around 1&amp;nbsp;cm.&lt;ref&gt;Kolbasuk, G. 1991. Coextruded Hdpe Vldpe Multilayer Geomembranes. Geotextiles and Geomembranes. 10, no. 5-6: 601-612.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Environmental stress cracking ===
Environmental stress cracking is defined as external or internal cracking in plastic induced by applied tensile stress less than its short-term tensile strength.  ESC is a fairly common observation in HDPE geomembranes and thus needs to be evaluated carefully.  Proper polymeric properties, such as molecular weight, orientation, and distribution, aid in ESC resistance.  ASTM D5397 [standard test method for evaluation of stress crack resistance of polyolefin geomembranes using notched constant tensile load (NCTL)] provides the necessary procedure for measuring the ESC resistance of most HDPE geomembranes.  The current recommended transition time for an acceptable HDPE geomembrane is around 100 h.&lt;ref name="sharma"/&gt;

'''MOPP''' (an acronym for "'''Mission Oriented Protective Posture'''"; pronounced "mop") is protective gear used by U.S. [[military]] personnel in a toxic environment, e.g., during a chemical, biological, radiological, or nuclear ([[CBRN]]) strike:

* [[gas mask|Protective mask]] — Commonly referred to as a [[gas mask]] or pro mask. It is designed to filter harmful chemical and biological agents, as well as irradiated particles from the air to allow the wearer to breathe safely. No protective masks filter out gases such as [[carbon monoxide]], and in situations requiring that level of protection, external breathing apparatus is employed.
* Mask carrier — Protects the mask from damage. It is usually worn as part of battle gear for easy access and usually contains a technical manual, extra filter, spare parts, chemical detection papers, and [[nerve agent]] [[antidote]] kits (NAAK).
* Over garments — [[Joint Service Lightweight Integrated Suit Technology]] (JSLIST) Specially designed clothing to be worn over the normal uniform. These garments are designed to allow maximum airflow for cooling while keeping chemical and biological agents from reaching the [[skin]] of the wearer. Some are equipped with a [[charcoal]] lining to neutralize some agents.  Military personnel often equip over garments with strips of [[M9 Detector Tape|M9 Detector Paper]] to identify chemical agents on the battlefield they might come in contact with.
* M9 Detector paper is worn to detect chemical liquid agents that a service member may brush against while in MOPP gear. It is worn in three different area of the suit. It is worn on the dominant arm, bicep area, on the wrist of the opposite arm, and on the dominant leg, shin area. It is also placed on lower levels of vehicles for detection purposes.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}
* Gloves and overboots — (JSLIST) Highly durable [[rubber]], designed with combat operations in mind. Used to prevent contact with agents.

== MOPP protection levels ==
[[Image:TurkishFirefighterMOPP4.jpeg|thumb|right|200px|Turkish Firefighters in MOPP 4 level gear during an exercise held at [[Incirlik Air Base]], [[Turkey]]]]
Each MOPP level corresponds to an increasing level of protection. The readiness level will usually be dictated by the in-theatre commander.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gulflink.osd.mil/khamisiyah_ii/khamisiyah_ii_refs/n15en246/Ch2.htm |title=FM 3-4 Chptr 2 MOPP Analysis |publisher=Gulflink.osd.mil |date=1990-05-23 |accessdate=2018-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.armystudyguide.com/content/army_board_study_guide_topics/cbrn/5-levels-of-mopp.shtml |title=5 Levels of MOPP |publisher=ArmyStudyGuide.com |date= |accessdate=2018-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research ('''[[Arabic]]: وزارة التعليم العالي والبحث العلمي) is the government body that is responsible for maintaining and implementing government policies in higher education in [[Jordan]]. The ministry provides the support, services and organization aimed at guiding higher education sector in Jordan.

==History==

The Council of Higher Education was established in 1982 in response to the increased demand of regulating and planning the policies of higher education. In 1985, the council was renamed to the Ministry of Higher Education.

The ministry was annulled and was merged within the Ministry of Education in 1998, but was re-established in 2001 and was renamed as the Ministry of Higher Education and Scientific Research.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eacea.ec.europa.eu/tempus/participating_countries/higher/jordan.pdf Europe- Tempus report on Jordan]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific Research==
The ministry following its re-establishment in 2001, was given a new responsibility of guiding the scientific research sector of higher education in [[Jordan]]. In 2005, the Scientific Research Committee was formed. Since 2006, the ministry issues several internationally peer-reviewed journals in cooperation with several Jordanian universities:

Goldberg is best known for being the founder of the [[elearning]] companies  [[WebCT]], [[Brainify]], [[Silicon Chalk]], [[AssociCom]], and [[Marine Learning Systems]].  Goldberg was born in [[Calgary]], [[Alberta]], [[Canada]] and raised in [[Edmonton]] until he moved to [[British Columbia]] to attend the [[University of Victoria]] in 1980. Murray graduated from UVic in 1985 and then went on to earn an MSc from the [[University of British Columbia]]. In 2004 he was awarded an honorary Ph.D. from the Southern Cross University.&lt;ref name="NewMedia"&gt;[http://www.maltwood.uvic.ca/nmc/2001/program/press_releases.html#teaching ''Murray Goldberg &amp; WebCT Wins Hyperion Award'']&lt;/ref&gt; Murray serves as director for various companies, sits on the board of trustees of Harvey Mudd College in Claremont California, is a mentor at the GSV Labs tech incubator in Redwood City California, and is a frequent consultant and speaker on the future of eLearning. Murray is also the chair of the British Columbia chapter of the [[Manning Innovation Awards]].

==Professional History==

===University of British Columbia===

Murray began as a faculty member in the Department of Computer Science at UBC in 1993 and was awarded tenure there in 1998.&lt;ref name="checs"&gt;[http://www.checs.net/checs_99/GoldbergFrameset.html ''Goldberg short speaker biography'', New Mexico CHECS]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, his first year as a faculty member at UBC, Goldberg won the [https://web.archive.org/web/20090312005022/http://vpacademic.ubc.ca/awards/killam/index.htm Killiam Teaching Prize] at UBC.&lt;ref name="killiam"&gt;[http://www.vpacademic.ubc.ca/awards/killam/winners.htm#1993 Killiam Teaching Prize Award Winners] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081222192301/http://www.vpacademic.ubc.ca/awards/killam/winners.htm |date=2008-12-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  
Goldberg took a leave of absence from UBC in 1998 to lead WebCT full-time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cs.ubc.ca/about/Reports/annual/annual2001/Department_Highlights.html ''UBC Computer Science Department Highlights'', 1998/1999] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050922044809/http://www.cs.ubc.ca/about/Reports/annual/annual2001/Department_Highlights.html |date=2005-09-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===WebCT===
In 1995, as a UBC faculty member, Goldberg was researching the effectiveness of Web-Based learning environments.&lt;ref name="calos1"&gt;[http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=236462.236534 ''CALOS: an experiment with computer-aided learning for operating systems''], Proceedings of the twenty-seventh SIGCSE technical symposium on Computer science education, p.175-179, February 15–17, 1996, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="calos2"&gt;[http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=268085.268101 ''CALOS: first results from an experiment in computer-aided learning for operating systems''], Proceedings of the twenty-eighth SIGCSE technical symposium on Computer science education, p.48-52, February 27-March 01, 1997, San Jose, California, United States&lt;/ref&gt; 
Goldberg found that the experience of building the courses for this experimentation was sufficiently time consuming and expensive that he decided to create a platform to enable the simple and rapid creation of web-based learning environments,&lt;ref name="synergy"&gt;[http://www.science.ubc.ca/sites/science.ubc.ca/files/synergy/2-1.pdf ''Goldberg Pioneers On-Line Education'', Synergy Magazine, Issue 2.1, October 1996]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/21/technology/21TEAC.html ''College Courses Taught with Tailored Software'', The New York Times, December 21st, 2000]&lt;/ref&gt; WebCT.
WebCT was widely accepted as a catalyst in the worldwide boom of on-line learning that accelerated beginning in 1997.&lt;ref name = "SCMP"&gt;''What you see is Now What You Get Taught'', South China Morning Post, November 18, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;  By November, 2000 WebCT was purportedly serving 6 million students in 57 countries,&lt;ref name="SCMP" /&gt; and by late 2001, 10 million students in 80 countries at 2250 universities and colleges.&lt;ref name="courier"&gt;[http://archive.vancourier.com/issues01/06501-1/news/06501-1N11.html  ''UBC prof leads Web education revolution'', The Vancouver Courier, June 28, 2001] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20110717184607/http://archive.vancourier.com/issues01/06501-1/news/06501-1N11.html |date=July 17, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1999, Goldberg sold most of his stake in WebCT to Boston-Based Universal Learning Technology. The combined company took on the WebCT name.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;&lt;ref name="globe"&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/Page/document/v5/content/subscribe?user_URL=https://www.theglobeandmail.com%2Fservlet%2Fstory%2FLAC.20000131.RUBCC%2FTPStory%2F%3Fquery%3DFinds%2BVirtual%2BSuccess&amp;ord=16684550&amp;brand=theglobeandmail&amp;force_login=true ''BC University Spinoff Finds Virtual Success'', The Globe and Mail, January 31, 2000]&lt;/ref&gt; Goldberg remained as president of the Canadian division of WebCT until 2002 when he left to co-found [[Silicon Chalk]].

===Silicon Chalk===
In 2002 Goldberg co-founded Silicon Chalk and served as the president and CEO.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ausweb.scu.edu.au/aw04/conf/keynotes.html AUSWEB Keynote Speaker Biographical Details]&lt;/ref&gt; Silicon Chalk created software for use in laptop or computer enabled higher education classrooms. The software facilitated the recording of classroom presentations, student note taking, polling, file sharing, and other features.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.editlib.org/p/13712  ''Silicon Chalk – Supporting Learning in the Classroom and Beyond'']&lt;/ref&gt; The company never achieved widespread success, though did have users in 70 universities and colleges when it was sold to [[Horizon Wimba]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://staff.blog.ui.edu/harrybs/2008/07/ ''History of Virtual Learning Environments''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090316114624/http://staff.blog.ui.edu/harrybs/2008/07/ |date=2009-03-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brainify===
In 2007 Goldberg began work on [[Brainify]][https://web.archive.org/web/20090204164850/http://brainify.com/  (website)], an academic social bookmarking and networking site for university and college students and professors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chronicle.com/free/2009/01/10124n.htm ''Social Bookmarking Site for Higher Education Makes Debut'', The Chronicle of Higher Education]&lt;/ref&gt;  Brainify was launched in January 2009 and Goldberg acts as the President and CEO. Members from 250 institutions had joined within the first 20 days of its launch.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20110610175443/http://www.dailytargum.com/university/1.1480886-1.1480886 ''Interactive Website digitally links colleges'']&lt;/ref&gt;

===AssociCom===
In June, 2010, Goldberg launched [[AssociCom]] [http://www.associcom.com (website)], a professional networking and discovery platform with an emphasis on enabling member discovery, learning and connection within professional associations and  societies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.associcom.com/Home/What ''What is AssociCom'']. Murray stepped down as CEO of the company to focus full time on [[Marine Learning Systems]], though he continues to be involved as the chair of the board of directors.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marine Learning Systems===
Also in 2010, Murray founded the company [[Marine Learning Systems]] [http://www.marinels.com (website)]. Their product, MarineLMS, is a learning management system for training in the maritime industry, with [[BC Ferries]] as their first customer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://worldmaritimenews.com/archives/34014 ''Canada: First Learning Management System for Maritime Training Released'', World Maritime News]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Peer-Allocated Instant Response''' ('''PAIR''') is a project in the [[Netherlands]] that aims to match students with best-suited peer candidates for online support.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The University of Europe: accessible to all|journal=The Guardian|author=Mandy Garner|url=https://www.theguardian.com/universitychallenge/university-europe | location=London | date=2009-01-19 | accessdate=2010-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was launched in 2006 by the [[Open University of the Netherlands]], an online university, and was supported by [[Fontys University of Applied Sciences|Fontys University]] and SURF, the national organization in the Netherlands that coordinates ICT in higher education.&lt;ref name=jass&gt;{{citation|author=Wim Westera|title=Peer-Allocated Instant Response (PAIR): Computational Allocation of Peer Tutors in Learning Communities|journal=Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation|volume=1010|url=http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/10/2/5.html|date=31 Mar 2007|issue=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The system works as follows:&lt;ref name=ppt&gt;[http://www.open.ou.nl/wim/presentations/help-me.ppt Help me! Online Learner Support through the Self-Organised Allocation of Peer Tutors]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}{{PPTlink}}&lt;/ref&gt; Online students requiring help type their question into an [[Instant messaging|IM]]-like client; they are then automatically and instantaneously paired with another student who is currently online. When the conversation is over, both parties rate the experience. The currently used allocation algorithm does not perform a semantic analysis of the question; it allocates peer tutors based on their position in the curriculum relative to the help seeker, their past workload and past ratings.

A simulation of the allocation algorithm was carried out&lt;ref name=jass/&gt; and two 8-week pilot projects were conducted at the Open University and the Fontys University.&lt;ref name=ppt/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7153">'''Polysilicon depletion effect''' is the phenomenon in which unwanted variation of [[threshold voltage]] of the [[MOSFET]] devices using [[polysilicon]] as gate material is observed, leading to unpredicted behaviour of the [[electronic circuit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rios |first1=R. |last2=Arora |first2=N.D. |year=1994 |title=An analytic polysilicon depletion effect model for MOSFETs |journal=Electron Device Letters, IEEE |volume=15 |issue=4 |pages=129–131 |publisher=IEEE |doi= |url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=285407&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D285407 |accessdate=7 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polycrystalline silicon, also called [[polysilicon]], is a material consisting of small silicon crystals. It differs from [[single-crystal silicon]], used for electronics and [[solar cells]], and from amorphous silicon, used for thin film devices and solar cells.

==Gate material choice==
The gate contact may be of [[polysilicon]] or metal, previously polysilicon was chosen over metal because the interfacing between polysilicon and [[gate oxide]] ([[Silicon dioxide|SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]) was favourable. But the conductivity of the poly-silicon layer is very low and because of this low conductivity, the charge accumulation is low, leading to a delay in channel formation and thus unwanted delays in circuits. The poly layer is doped with N-type or P-type impurity to make it behave like a perfect conductor and reduce the delay.

==Doped polysilicon gate disadvantages==

[[File:Without application of any field.png|thumb|left|Figure 1(a)]]

''&lt;small&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;gs&lt;/sub&gt; = Gate Voltage&lt;br /&gt;
V&lt;sub&gt;th&lt;/sub&gt; = Threshold Voltage&lt;br /&gt;
N+ = Highly doped N region&lt;/small&gt;''

In ''figure 1(a)'' it is observed that the free [[majority carriers]] are scattered throughout the structure because of the absence of an external [[electric field]]. When a positive field is applied on the gate, the scattered carriers arrange themselves like ''figure 1(b)'', the electrons move closer toward the gate terminal but due to the open circuit configuration they don't start to flow. As a result of the separation of charges a depletion region is formed on the polysilicon-oxide interface, which has a direct effect on the channel formation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rios |first1=R. |last2=Arora |first2=N.D. |year=1994 |title=Modeling the polysilicon depletion effect and its impact on submicrometer CMOS circuit performance |journal=Electron Devices, IEEE Transactions |volume=42 |issue=5 |pages=935–943 |publisher=IEEE |doi= |url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=381991 |accessdate=7 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[MOSFET]].

[[File:With application of field.png|thumb|Figure 1(b)]]

In an NMOS with n+ Polysilicon gate, the poly depletion effect aids in the channel formation by the combined effect of the ''(+)ve'' field of donor ions (N&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;) and the externally applied ''(+)ve'' field at gate terminal. Basically the accumulation of the ''(+)ve'' charged Donor [[ions]] (N&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;) on the polysilicon enhances the Formation of the inversion channel and when V&lt;sub&gt;gs&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; V&lt;sub&gt;th&lt;/sub&gt; an inversion layer is formed, which can be seen in the figure 1(b) where the inversion channel is formed of acceptor ions (N&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;)([[minority carriers]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |url=http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~hu/PUBLICATIONS/Hu_papers/Hu_CNF/HuC_CNF_085.pdf |title=Impact of polysilicon depletion in thin oxide MOS technology |last1=Schuegraf |first1=K.F. |authorlink1= |last2=King |first2=C.C.|last3=Hu |first3=C. |year=1993 |publisher= |booktitle=Proceedings International Symposium: VLSI Technology Systems and Applications |pages=86–90 |location= |id= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Polysilicon depletion can vary laterally across a transistor depending on the fabrication process, which can lead to significant transistor variability in certain transistor dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;H. P. Tuinhout, A. H. Montree, J. Schmitz and P. A. Stolk, Effects of gate depletion and boron penetration on matching of deep submicron CMOS transistors, IEEE International Electron Device Meeting, Technical Digest pp. 631-634, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Metal gate contacts re-introduced==
For the above reason as the devices go down on the scaling [[32nm|(32-28nm nodes)]] poly gates are being replaced by metal gates. The following technology is known as High-k Dielectric Metal Gate (HKMG) integration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://globalfoundries.com/technology/32-28nm.aspx Global Foundries]&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, [[Intel]] also released a press-kit regarding their fabrication procedures of different nodes, which showed the use of Metal gate technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |last= |first= |title=From Sand to Silicon: The Making of Chip |trans-title=|date=Nov 11, 2011 |publisher=Intel Technology |location= |url=http://newsroom.intel.com/docs/DOC-2476 |format= |accessdate=2013-06-08 |archiveurl= |archivedate=2013-06-08 |deadurl= |quote= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Doped polysilicon was preferred earlier as gate material in MOS devices. Polysilicons were used as their [[work function]] matched with the Si substrate (which results in the low [[threshold voltage]] of [[MOSFET]]). Metal gates were re-introduced at the time when SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; [[dielectric]]s are being replaced by [[high-k dielectric]]s like [[Hafnium oxide]] as gate oxide in the mainstream [[CMOS]] technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |last=Chau |first=Robert |title=Gate Dielectric Scaling for CMOS: from SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/PolySi to High-K/Metal-Gate |trans-title=|date=Nov 6, 2003  |publisher=Intel Technology |location= |url=http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/silicon-innovations/gate-dielectric-scaling-for-cmos-guide.html|format=White paper |accessdate=2013-06-08 |archiveurl= |archivedate=2013-06-08 |deadurl= |quote= |ref= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also at the interface with gate dielectric, Polysilicon forms an SiO&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; layer. Moreover, there remains a high probability for [[Fermi level pinning]] to occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hobbs |first1=C.C. |last2=Fonseca |first2=L. R. C.|last3=Knizhnik |first3= A. |year=2004 |title=Fermi-level pinning at the polysilicon/metal oxide interface-Part I |journal=Electron Devices, IEEE Transactions on |volume=51 |issue=6 |pages=971–977 |publisher=IEEE |doi= |url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=1300833 |accessdate=7 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; So the effect with doped poly is an undesired reduction of threshold voltage that wasn't taken into account during circuit simulation. In order to avoid this kind of variation in [[Threshold voltage|v&lt;sub&gt;th&lt;/sub&gt;]] of the [[MOSFET]], at present metal gate is preferred over [[Polysilicon]].

'''Remington Products''', commonly known as simply '''Remington''', is a worldwide [[personal care]] corporation which manufactures razors (shavers), [[epilator]]s, and [[haircare]] products for both men and women. It is a subsidiary of [[Spectrum Brands]] and [[Oak Hill Capital]].

==History==

The origins of the "Remington" name date back to the formation of '''[[E. Remington and Sons]]''', a [[firearms]] maker founded in 1816. E. Remington &amp; Sons made occasional forays into products other than firearms, such as [[sewing machine]]s and [[farm implement]]s — but its most significant side venture was when inventor [[Christopher Sholes]] persuaded the firearms company to help him develop the [[typewriter]] with the [[QWERTY]] [[Alphanumeric keyboard|keyboard]], which is still the standard today. In 1886, E. Remington &amp; Sons sold the typewriter company, which became Remington Typewriter Company. This in turn merged with the Rand Kardex Corporation in 1927 to become [[Remington Rand]]. Remington Rand branched out into making [[adding machine]]s, [[filing cabinet]]s, [[punched card]] tabulating machines, and other [[office equipment]] to become a leading office equipment company.

The origin of Remington personal care products dates back to 1937 when Remington Rand began to branch out to [[electric shaver]]s, starting with the Remington Model E.

In 1950, Remington Rand bought the pioneering [[Eckert-Mauchly Computer Corporation|Eckert-Mauchly Computer Company]]. In 1955, it merged with [[Sperry Corporation]], developer of the [[autopilot|automatic pilot]], amongst other [[Machine|device]]s. The combined company became the [[Sperry Rand Corporation]] and continued to market shavers under the Remington brand. In 1979, Sperry Rand sold off a number of its divisions, including the consumer products. [[Victor Kiam]] bought the electric shaver company in a [[leveraged buyout]].

Victor Kiam's '''Remington Products Company''' became very profitable, branching out into other personal care [[small appliance]]s, buying [[Clairol]]'s personal care appliance business in 1994. Kiam sold [[controlling interest]] in Remington to [[Ike Perlmutter]] prior to the Clairol [[Takeover|acquisition]] that same year. Remington changed hands again on June 1996 when Perlmutter and Kiam sold controlling interest in the company to [[Vestar Capital Partners]]. Victor Kiam died in 2001.  In 2003, the Kiam family and Vestar sold Remington to the [[Battery (electricity)|battery]] company [[Rayovac]].  Rayovac changed its name to [[Spectrum Brands]] and [[Marketing|market]]s Remington brand men's and [http://www.remingtonproducts.com/products/womens/hair-removal.aspx women's electric shavers], [[hair clipper]]s, [[beard]] and [[moustache]] [[Hair clipper|trimmers]], [https://shavingbeast.com/best-nose-trimmers-for-men-in-2017 nose and ear hair trimmers], [[foot massage]]rs, [[make-up]] [[mirror]]s, heated hair rollers, [[blow dryer]]s, and [[curling iron]]s. Remington also sells [[hair straighteners|flat irons]].

Remington Products' product line include '''Lady Remington'''s, electric shavers for women.

== TV commercials==
The president of Remington shavers in 1978: "When my wife bought me a Remington shaver, I was so impressed I bought the company".
[[Victor Kiam]] would often appear in television advertisements for Remington shavers and say: "Shaves as close as a blade, or your money back!"{{cn|date=July 2017}}

{{NSA surveillance|1}}
{{Global surveillance}}
'''Room 641A''' is a telecommunication interception facility operated by [[AT&amp;T]] for the U.S. [[National Security Agency]] that commenced operations in 2003 and was exposed in 2006.&lt;ref name=WiredEvidence /&gt;&lt;ref name=wired1/&gt;

==Description==
Room 641A is located in the [[SBC Communications]] building at 611 Folsom Street, [[San Francisco]], three floors of which were occupied by AT&amp;T before SBC purchased AT&amp;T.&lt;ref name=WiredEvidence /&gt; The room was referred to in internal AT&amp;T documents as the ''SG3 [Study Group 3] Secure Room.'' It is fed by [[optical fiber|fiber optic]] lines from [[beam splitter]]s installed in fiber optic trunks carrying [[Internet backbone]] traffic&lt;ref name=kleinex /&gt; and, as analyzed by J. Scott Marcus, a former [[Chief technology officer|CTO]] for [[GTE]] and a former adviser to the [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]], has access to all Internet traffic that passes through the building, and therefore "the capability to enable surveillance and analysis of internet content on a massive scale, including both overseas and purely domestic traffic."&lt;ref name=marcus1 /&gt;

The room measures about {{convert|24|by|48|ft}} and contains several racks of equipment, including a [[Narus (company)|Narus]] STA 6400, a device designed to intercept and analyze Internet communications at very high speeds.&lt;ref name=WiredEvidence/&gt;

The existence of the room was revealed by former AT&amp;T technician [[Mark Klein]] and was the subject of a 2006 [[class action]] lawsuit by the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] against AT&amp;T.&lt;ref name=EFFdocs/&gt; Klein claims he was told that similar [[black room]]s are operated at other facilities around the country.{{Citation needed|date=March 2018}}

Room 641A and the controversies surrounding it were subjects of an episode of ''[[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/homefront/view/|title=Spying on the Homefront|work=Frontline|publisher=PBS|accessdate=2013-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; the current affairs documentary program on [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]. It was originally broadcast on May 15, 2007. It was also featured on PBS's ''[[NOW on PBS|NOW]]'' on March 14, 2008. The room was also covered in the PBS ''[[Nova (TV series)|Nova]]'' episode "The Spy Factory".

==Lawsuit==
{{main|Hepting v. AT&amp;T}}
The [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] (EFF) filed a [[Class action|class-action]] [[lawsuit]] against [[AT&amp;T]] on January 31, 2006, accusing the telecommunication company of violating the law and the privacy of its customers by collaborating with the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) in a massive, illegal program to [[wiretap]] and [[Data mining|data-mine]] Americans' communications. On July 20, 2006, a federal judge denied the government's and AT&amp;T's motions to dismiss the case, chiefly on the ground of the [[State Secrets Privilege|States Secrets Privilege]], allowing the lawsuit to go forward. On August 15, 2007, the case was heard by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals]] and was dismissed on December 29, 2011 based on a [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act of 1978 Amendments Act of 2008|retroactive grant of immunity]] by Congress for telecommunications companies that cooperated with the government. The U.S. Supreme Court declined to hear the case.&lt;ref name="eff-hepting"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/cases/hepting |title=Hepting v. AT&amp;T &amp;#124; Electronic Frontier Foundation |publisher=Eff.org |date=2006-01-31 |accessdate=2014-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; A different case by the EFF was filed on September 18, 2008, titled ''[[Jewel v. NSA]]''.

[[image:Palazzo medici riccardi, bugnato 01.JPG|thumb|Two different styles of rustication in the [[Palazzo Medici-Riccardi]] in [[Florence]]; smooth-faced above and rough-faced below.]]
[[File:Château de Fontainebleau 2011 (200).JPG|thumb|Extreme [[Mannerist]] "cyclopian" rustication at the [[Palace of Fontainebleau]]]]

In [[classical architecture]]  '''rustication''' is a range of [[masonry]] techniques giving visible surfaces a finish that contrasts in texture with the smoothly finished, squared-block masonry surfaces called [[ashlar]].  The visible face of each individual block is cut back around the edges to make its size and placing very clear.  In addition the central part of the face of each block may be given a deliberately rough or patterned surface.&lt;ref&gt;Summerson, 45-47, 58-59, 132&lt;/ref&gt;

Rusticated masonry is usually "dressed", or squared off neatly, on all sides of the stones except the face that will be visible when the stone is put in place.  This is given wide joints that emphasize the edges of each block, by angling the edges ("channel-jointed"), or dropping them back a little.  The main part of the exposed face may be worked flat and smooth or left with, or worked, to give a more or less rough or patterned surface.  Rustication is often used to give visual weight to the ground floor in contrast to smooth ashlar above. Though intended to convey a "rustic" simplicity, the finish is highly artificial, and the faces of the stones often carefully worked to achieve an appearance of a coarse finish.&lt;ref&gt;Summerson, 45-47&lt;/ref&gt;

Rustication was used in ancient times, but became especially popular in the revived classical styles of [[Italian Renaissance architecture]] and that of subsequent periods, above all in the lower floors of secular buildings. It remains in use in some modern architecture.

Similar finishes are very common in medieval architecture, especially in [[castle]]s, walls and similar buildings, but here it merely arises from an unwillingness to spend the extra money required for ashlar masonry in a particular building, and lacks the deliberate emphasis on the joints between blocks. Though it often achieves a decorative effect, this is something of a by-product, and the exploitation for architectural effect within a single building of contrasts between rusticated and ashlar surfaces is rarely seen.  In some buildings, such as the [[Palazzo Vecchio]] in [[Florence]] (begun 1298) something other than cost-saving is at play, and this may be the association of the technique with the display of power and strength, from its use in military architecture.&lt;ref&gt;Woodman&lt;/ref&gt;  Rough finishes on stone are also very common in architecture outside the European tradition, but these too would generally not be called rustication. For example, the bases of [[Japanese castle]]s and other fortifications usually use rough stone, often very attractively.

==History==
[[File:Serlio XXIX.jpg|thumb|left|Serlio, rusticated doorway of the type now called a [[Gibbs surround]], 1537]]
Although rustication is known from a few buildings of Greek and Roman antiquity, for example Rome's [[Porta Maggiore]], the method first became popular during the [[Renaissance]], when the stone work of lower floors and sometimes entire [[facade]]s of buildings were finished in this manner.&lt;ref&gt;Summerson, 58; Woodman. There is much detail in Alfonso Acocella, [http://www.architetturadipietra.it/wp/?p=4952 "Greek and Roman rustication"], online re-edit of his section in ''Stone architecture. Ancient and modern constructive skills'', Milan, Skira-Lucense, 2006, pp. 624 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was generally used for secular buildings, and has always remained uncommon in churches, perhaps through a lingering association with the architecture of military power; there are exceptions, such as [[St Giles in the Fields]], London (1730–34).

Probably the earliest and most influential example is the [[Palazzo Medici Riccardi]] in [[Florence]], built between 1444 and 1484, with two contrasting rusticated finishes.  The ground floor has an irregular and  genuinely rugged appearance, with a variation in the degree to which parts of the faces of blocks project from the wall that is rarely equalled later.  Above, the rustication is merely to emphasize the individual blocks, and the faces are all smooth and even.  Also in Florence, [[Palazzo Strozzi]], begun 1489, with large oblong rounded cushions, and the front of the [[Pitti Palace]], begun 1458, rusticated their whole facades in the same style.  These facades only used the [[classical order]]s in [[mullion]]s and [[aedicule]]s, with arched forms in rustication the main relief from the massive flat walls.  The [[Palazzo Rucellai]], probably of the 1460s, begins to classicize such facades, using smooth-faced rustication throughout, except for the pilasters at each level.

In Rome, [[Donato Bramante]]'s [[Palazzo Caprini]] ("House of Raphael", by 1510, now destroyed) provided a standard model for the integration of rustication with the orders.  Here the obvious strength of a blind arched [[arcade (architecture)|arcade]] with emphatic [[voussoir]]s on the rusticated ground storey (in fact using stucco) gave reassuring support to the upper storey's paired [[Doric order|Doric]] columns standing on rusticated [[pier (architecture)|piers]], set against a smooth wall.&lt;ref&gt;Summerson, 53&lt;/ref&gt;  The first major Renaissance building in Spain, the [[Palace of Charles V]] in [[Granada]] (1527), had a deeply rusticated ground floor facade with regular rounded cushions.

The technique was enthusiatically taken up by the next generation of [[Mannerist]] architects, with [[Giulio Romano]] in the lead.  Most early examples of this "rustic" style are therefore built for sophisticated patrons in the leading centres of taste.  Giulio's [[Palazzo Stati Maccarani]] in Rome and [[Palazzo Te]] in [[Mantua]] expand the voussoirs still further, and the courtyard in Mantua plays games with the technique, with some blocks ashlar, other projecting further than the rest, and larger blocks placed higher than smaller ones.  The Mannerist architectural writer [[Sebastiano Serlio]] and others of his generation enjoyed the play between rusticated and finished architectural elements. In the woodcut of a doorway from Serlio's 1537 treatise, the banded rustication of the wall is carried right across the attached column and the moldings of the doorway surround, binding together all the elements. 
[[File:Somerset House courtyard (06).JPG|thumb|Courtyard of [[Somerset House]] in London, mostly smooth-faced "V" joints, but with vermiculated square blocks around the [[Gibbs surround]] to the door.]]

The Italians brought in to expand the [[Palace of Fontainebleau]] introduced the technique to France.  Its spread to Germany and England took longer, but by about the end of the 16th century it had reached all parts of Europe.  In his [[Banqueting House]] in London (1619), [[Inigo Jones]] gave a lightly rusticated surface texture to emphasize the blocks on both storeys, and to unify them behind his orders of pilasters and columns. 
 
During the 18th century, following the [[Palladian]] revival, rustication was widely used on the ground floors of large buildings, as its contrived appearance of simplicity and solidity contrasted well to the carved ornamental stonework and columns of the floors above: "Rustication became almost obligatory in all 18th- and 19th-century public buildings in Europe and the USA".&lt;ref&gt;Woodman, exaggerating somewhat&lt;/ref&gt;  A ground floor with rustication, especially in an English mansion such as [[Kedleston Hall]], is sometimes referred to as the "rustic floor", in order to distinguish it from the [[piano nobile]] above.  As well as uses emphasizing the horizontal, rustication is often used in relatively narrow vertical bands, on the [[quoin]]s at corners or elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Chitham, 126&lt;/ref&gt;  Rustication may also be confined to the surrounds of arches, doors or windows, especially at the top.  In these and other situations where rustication stops horizontally, the edge is usually made up of vertically alternating long and short blocks.&lt;ref&gt;Chitham, 127&lt;/ref&gt;  Rustication therefore often reverses the patterns of medieval and later [[vernacular architecture]], where roughly dressed wall surfaces often contrast with ashlar quoins and frames to openings.
[[File:Castle Howard, june 2011.JPG|thumb|left|Regular smooth-faced rustication (left) turns to horizontal banded rustication at the corner of [[Castle Howard]] in North Yorkshire, England.]]

Architectural books by authors such as [[James Gibbs]] and [[William Chambers (architect)|William Chambers]] set out detailed recommendations for the proportions of the blocks in relation to columns in the same facade, and the proportion of the block that a widened joint should occupy, though their prescriptions differ, and were not always followed by architects.&lt;ref&gt;Chitham, 126&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically, rustication after 1700 is highly regular, with the front faces of blocks flat even when worked in patterns, as opposed to the real unevenness often seen in the 16th-century examples.  Often the Palazzo Medici Riccardi model is followed; the ground floor has heavy rustication with textured faces, while above there is smooth-faced "V" rustication.  Though such horizontal zones of rustication are the most common, vertical zones can often be used as highlights, as in the illustration from Catania above, or the Cour Napoleon in the [[Louvre Palace]].  The Baroque garden front of the [[Pitti Palace]] achieves a striking effect, not often copied, by using extensive "blocking", both rounded and rectangular, on the shafts of its columns and pilasters.

[[Canton Viaduct]], a blind arcade cavity wall railroad viaduct built in 1834-35 in [[Canton, Massachusetts]] is an example of modest effects of rustication in industrial architecture; the effect is pleasing, and the cost was probably reduced. Massive effects of contrasting rustications typify the "[[Richardsonian Romanesque]]" style exemplified in the 1870s and 80s by the American architect [[H. H. Richardson]].  The technique is still sometimes used in architecture of a broadly [[Modernist architecture|Modernist]] character, especially in city centre streets where it helps modern buildings blend with older ones with rustication.

Although essentially a technique for stone masonry, rustication can be imitated in brick and [[stucco]],&lt;ref&gt;Chitham, 126&lt;/ref&gt; which began as early as [[Bramante]]'s [[Palazzo Caprini]] and was common in smaller houses in [[Georgian architecture]], and also in wood (see below), which is mainly found in [[British America]].

==Variations==
[[File:Vermiculures.JPG|thumb|Two adjacent vermiculated blocks showing rather different interpretations of the pattern.]]

The most common variation of rustication is the smooth-faced, where the external face of the block is smooth, as in ashlar, and differs from that only by the cutting in at the joints; this became increasingly popular, and is now the most commonly seen type.  If deeply cut-back edges are worked only to the horizontal joints, with the appearance of the vertical joints being minimised, the resulting effect is known as '''banded rustication''', mostly seen on the lowest levels of very large buildings like the [[Palace of Versailles]] or the main [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|Foreign Office]] building in London.  As at Versailles, the bands may de "elbowed", dipping diagonally around arches to join up with and emphasize the [[voussoir]]s.  Banded rustication is mostly seen with smooth-faced stones, and has remained popular in [[Stripped Classicism]] and other contemporary versions of classical styles.  In this style, the bands are sometimes several feet apart, making it apparent that stone facings are being used.

When the stone is left with a rough external surface, rough shapes may be drilled or chiselled in the somewhat smoothed face in a technique called "vermiculation" ('''vermiculate rustication''' or '''vermicular rustication'''), so called from the Latin ''vermiculus'' meaning "little worm",&lt;ref&gt;Woodman&lt;/ref&gt; because the shapes resemble worms, worm-casts or worm tracks in mud or wet sand.  Carved vermiculation requires a good deal of careful mason's work, and is mostly used over limited areas to highlight them. Disparities between individual blocks are often seen, presumably as different carvers interpreted their patterns slightly differently, or had different levels of skill.&lt;ref&gt;McKay, 38&lt;/ref&gt;  The small Turner Mausoleum at [[Kirkleatham]] by [[James Gibbs]] (1740) has an unusually large area vermiculated, over half of the main level.  When the shapes join up to form a network, the style is called "reticulated".&lt;ref&gt;McKay, 38&lt;/ref&gt;

Often, especially from the Baroque onwards, the roughly flattened central areas of stones are indented in regular, but not too regular, patterns called "pecked" or "picked-work", and various other ways of patterning them may be found.  In garden architecture, where water was to flow over or near the surface, a vertically oriented pattern evoking hanging pond-weed or [[algae]], or [[icicle]]s ("frost-work") is sometimes used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lookingatbuildings.org.uk/styles/classical/features/rustication.html Looking at buildings], "Rustication"&lt;/ref&gt;  Also associated with gardens is "cyclopian" rustication, where the blocks are very large and irregular, as though placed by giants, and "rock-work", where surfaces are built up of rough rocks not placed in regular courses at all.  This last goes beyond rustication, and is found in fountains and follies, and later [[rockery|rockeries]] for planting.

In '''prismatic rustication''' the blocks are dressed at an angle near each edge, giving a [[Prism (geometry)|prism]]-like shape.&lt;ref&gt;"Prismatic", in Curl, James Stevens, ''Encyclopaedia of Architectural Terms'', 1993, Donhead Publishing, London&lt;/ref&gt;  Where the faces rise to a single point, this is often known by terms using "diamond", and is covered below. They may also, usually in blocks that are oblong rather than square, rise to a ridge in the centre.  Both types are illustrated, with several others, by Serlio.&lt;ref&gt;Summerson, fig. 52&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Diamond rustication===
[[Image:Catane Université.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Sicilian Baroque]] [[pilaster]]s with two types of prismatic rustication against a smooth background at the [[University of Catania]]]]
Various types of other patterns in masonry surfaces are sometimes called rustication. These include "diamond point" or "diamond rustication" where the face of each stone is a low [[pyramid]] facing out.&lt;ref&gt;Woodman&lt;/ref&gt;  This covered the whole facade of the [[Palazzo dei Diamanti]] in [[Ferrara]], completed in 1503, and most of that of the [[Palace of Facets]] in the [[Moscow Kremlin]], designed by Italians and completed in 1492, with rectangular "diamonds". These "diamond palaces" influenced other whole walls of diamonds at [[Casa dos Bicos]] in Portugal (after 1523, alternate stones only), and [[Crichton Castle]] in Scotland (c. 1585; all stones, with flat edges between pyramids).

The round towers at the [[Castello Sforzesco]] in [[Milan]] almost use diamonds, but their points are smoothed over. The illustration at right, from [[Catania]] in Sicily, alternates rows of three square "diamond" blocks with two oblong blocks, where the faces rise to a ridge rather than a point, showing both the main forms of "prismatic rustication".

The sharply pointed styles have really nothing to do with classical rustication, and are instead a development of styles of raised decoration of masonry that were popular in late [[Gothic architecture]], especially the Iberian [[Manueline]] (or Portuguese late Gothic) and its equivalent in Spain, known as [[Isabelline Gothic]]. When not figurative these are known as [[bossage]].  These are probably a development of [[Mudéjar]] styles of patterning walls.  In the spectacular late 15th-century gateway to the [[Palacio de Jabalquinto]] in [[Baeza]], [[Andalucia]], small widely spaced pyramids cover one of the many zones with fancy carved elements, projecting from a wall otherwise in ashlar.

Later, in [[Baroque architecture]], relatively small areas of diamond rustication were reintegrated into architecture in the classical tradition, and were popular as highlights, especially in [[Sicily]] and southern Italy and Eastern and [[Central Europe]].  The large [[Černín Palace]] in [[Prague]] (1660s) repeats the Kremlin formula of a broad zone of diamonds across the middle height of the facade, though like the towers in Milan these do not come to a point.&lt;ref&gt;Woodman&lt;/ref&gt;

==Feigned rustication==
[[File:MountVernon-Rustication.JPG|thumb|Simple smooth-faced rustication in wood at [[Mount Vernon]]; an imitation of European style popular in America]] 
The appearance of rustication, creating a rough, unfinished stone-like surface, can be worked on a wooden exterior.  This process became popular in 18th century New England to translate the features of [[Palladian architecture]] to the house-carpenter's idiom: in Virginia [[Monticello]] and [[Mount Vernon (plantation)|Mount Vernon]] both made use of this technique.  Mount Vernon in particular makes extensive use of feigned rustication and sanded paint and the original finished surfaces of several original planks still survive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mountvernon.org/visit/plan/index.cfm/pid/541/ |title=George Washington's Mount Vernon - Rustication |accessdate=2008-08-03 |work=Mount Vernon |publisher=Mount Vernon Ladies' Association |year=2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081229065757/http://www.mountvernon.org/visit/plan/index.cfm/pid/541/ |archivedate=2008-12-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rustication of a wooden exterior consists of three basic steps.  First, the wood is cut, sanded and prepared with [[bevel]]ed grooves that make each plank appear as if it were a series of stone blocks.  Second, the wood is painted with a thick coat of paint.  Third, while the paint is still wet, sand is thrown or air blasted onto the planks until no more sand will stick.  After the paint dries the plank is ready for use.

In [[Central Europe]], especially the [[Czech Republic]], feigned rustication in [[sgraffito]] (decoration by scraping away one colour of coating on an exterior to show another beneath) is a feature from the Late Renaissance onwards, continuing into the 20th century.  Often "prismatic" or "diamond" rustication is imitated.

The ''Centre Scientifique et Technique du Bâtiment'' ('''Scientific and Technical Center for Building''') CSTB, is the French national organisation providing research and innovation, consultancy, testing, training and certification services in the construction industry.

It was founded in 1947 after the [[World War II|Second World War]] to support the reconstruction effort.

The mission of the CSTB is to ensure the quality and safety of buildings, and support innovation from the idea to the market. It brings together multidisciplinary skills to develop and share essential scientific and technical knowledge, and to provide stakeholders with answers to the challenges of their professional practice.

The CSTB focuses on four key activities: research and consulting, assessment, certification and dissemination of knowledge. Its field of expertise covers construction products, buildings, and their integration into neighborhoods and cities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://institut-carnot.cstb.fr/en/about-us/missions/ Official website, 2016]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sukhinder Singh Cassidy''' (born '''Sukhinder Singh''' in 1970) is a technology executive and entrepreneur. She has worked at companies including [[Google]], [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] and [[News Corp]], [[Yodlee]] (YODL), and [[Polyvore]].&lt;ref name="SSC Bio"&gt;{{cite web|title=theBoardlist Team|url=https://theboardlist.com/press-resources|website=theBoardlist}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, she founded JOYUS, the video shopping platform for women, and served as CEO then Chairman until 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Joyus Launches V-Commerce|url=http://www.wwd.com/media-news/digital/joyus-launches-v-commerce-5201360|website=Women's Wear Daily}}&lt;/ref&gt; Singh Cassidy is also Founder of theBoardlist.&lt;ref name="fortune.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Joyus' CEO has a new plan to get more women onto startup boards|url=http://fortune.com/2015/07/15/joyus-ceo-diversity-board/|website=Fortune}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Sukhinder Cassidy was born in 1970 in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania to parents of [[Sikhism|Sikh]] descent. Her family moved to Ontario, Canada, when she was two years old. She grew up in [[St. Catharines]], in Canada's Niagara Region.&lt;ref name="bizjournal"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sukhinder Singh Cassidy: CEO of Polyvore's ‘appetite for change’ creates Silicon Valley success|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/stories/2010/03/22/focus4.html?page=all|website=Silicon Valley Business Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sukhinder Cassidy graduated from the [[University of Western Ontario]] and earned her H.B.A. from the [[Richard Ivey School of Business]] in 1992.

Sukhinder Cassidy was raised in an entrepreneurial family. Both of her parents were doctors and ran a medical practice for thirty years.&lt;ref name="Inner Entrepreneur"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ex-Google exec Singh Cassidy on Joyus and facing her "inner entrepreneur"|url=http://fortune.com/2011/08/01/ex-google-exec-singh-cassidy-on-joyus-and-facing-her-inner-entrepreneur/|website=Fortune}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==

===Early career===
Sukhinder Cassidy started her career in investment banking at [[Merrill Lynch]] in New York. She moved to the Merrill Lynch London office 1994. She then worked as an analyst for British Sky Broadcasting.&lt;ref name="Dealmaker Bloomberg"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Rise of a Dealmaker|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2001-02-26/the-rise-of-a-dealmaker|website=Bloomberg|publisher=Bloomberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, Sukhinder Cassidy moved to Silicon Valley and joined ecommerce startup [[Junglee (company)]] as Head of Business Development. Junglee was acquired by [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Amazon to Buy two Companies|url=http://news.cnet.com/Amazon-to-buy-two-companies/2100-1001_3-214057.html|publisher=CNET}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the acquisition, Sukhinder Cassidy joined Amazon, where she led merchant business development for the first generation of Amazon marketplace.

===#ChoosePossibility Project and theBoardlist===
In May 2015, Sukhinder Cassidy published an open letter, titled "Tech Women Choose Possibility", challenging the tech community to increase the rate of progress for women in the industry by leveraging its wealth of existing female talent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tech Women Choose Possibility|url=http://recode.net/2015/05/13/tech-women-choose-possibility/|website=Re/Code}}&lt;/ref&gt; The letter was co-signed by 59 female entrepreneurs and investors. Singh Cassidy based the letter on her own experiences as a tech entrepreneur and research she conducted on 230 female founders and CEOs of tech companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=#ChoosePossibility Project|url=https://medium.com/@sukhindersinghcassidy/choosepossibility-project-90a217ff0a86#.gsuea6pjx|website=Medium}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sukhinder Cassidy launched [[theBoardlist]], the first initiative of the #ChoosePossibility Project, on July 15, 2015.&lt;ref name="fortune.com"/&gt; theBoardlist is an online marketplace that connects CEOs who are looking for board candidates with women who are peer-endorsed for private and public tech company boards. When it launched, theBoardlist included the names of over 600 women who had been endorsed by 50 investors and CEOs in the tech industry, from companies including [[Accel Partners]], [[Greylock Partners]], [[Twitter]], [[Lyft]] and Box.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A Woman On Every Startup Board? Why Not, Says Ex-Google Exec|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/ellenhuet/2015/07/15/a-woman-on-every-startup-board-boardlist-sukhinder-singh-cassidy/|website=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 20, 2015, theBoardlist announced that it had facilitated its first placement of a woman to the board of a private tech company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Boardlist, The Tool For Getting Women On Tech Boards, Has Its First Win|url=https://techcrunch.com/2015/10/20/boardlist-the-tool-for-getting-women-on-tech-boards-has-its-first-win/|website=TechCrunch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of late 2017, theBoardlist had attracted over 1,400 executives to nominate over 2,100 women for board service, and influenced over 100 board placements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Boss: Sukhinder Singh Cassidy Is on a Mission to Get More Women on Company Boards|url=http://motto.time.com/5022322/sukhinder-singh-cassidy-sexism-tech/|website=Motto|publisher=Time, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1704">A '''Technical Standard Order''' ('''TSO''') is a minimum performance standard issued by the [[United States]] [[Federal Aviation Administration]] for specified materials, parts, processes, and appliances used on [[civil aircraft]].  Articles with TSO design approval are eligible for use on the United States [[Type certification|type certified]] products by following a much lighter process than similar non-TSO approved part, provided the TSO standard meets the aircraft requirements&lt;ref&gt;https://www.aea.net/events/rotorcraft/files/Aug2013/FAA_InstallofTSOd.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;.

[[File:Tygon logo.svg|thumb|Tygon logo]]
'''Tygon''' is a brand name for a ''family'' of flexible polymer tubing consisting of a ''variety'' of materials to be used "across a range of specialized fluid transfer requirements".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.processsystems.saint-gobain.com/brand-transition.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; The specific composition of each type is a trade secret. Some variants have multiple layers of different materials. Tygon is a registered trademark of [[Saint-Gobain]] Corporation. It is an invented word, owned and used by Saint-Gobain and originated in the late 1930s. Tygon products are produced in three countries, but sold throughout the world. Tygon tubing is used in many markets, including food and beverage, chemical processing, industrial, laboratory, medical, pharmaceutical, and semiconductor processing.  There are many formulations of clear, flexible, Tygon tubing.  The chemical resistance and physical properties vary among the different formulations, but the tubing generally is intended to be "so resistant to chemical attack that it will handle practically any chemical", whether liquid, gas, or slurry.&lt;ref&gt;Shugar, Gershon J. and Jack T. Ballinger, ''Chemical technicians' ready reference handbook, fourth edition'', page 378, McGraw-Hill 1996 {{ISBN|0-07-057186-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; While largely non-reactive, Tygon has been reported to liberate [[carbon monoxide]] and is listed among [[carbon monoxide-releasing molecules]].  

==Formulations and applications==

===Food and beverage applications===
''Tygon B-44-3'', ''Tygon B-44-4X'', ''Tygon B-44-4X I.B.,'' and ''Tygon Silver'' (antimicrobial) were widely used in the food and beverage industry, in particular in: beverage dispensing, dairy processing, soft-serve dispensing, vitamin and flavor concentrate systems, cosmetic production, and water purification systems.  These formulations each meet U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] 3-A and [[NSF International]] 51 criteria but they do not comply with European Directives (European Directive 2002/72/EC of 6 August 2002 relating to plastic materials and articles intended to come into contact with foodstuffs as modified in particular by Directive 2007/19/EC of 2 April 2007).

=== Class VI approved ===
Several formulations of Tygon are [[United States Pharmacopeia|USP]] class VI approved and can be used in either surgical procedures or pharmaceutical processing.

====Medical====
''Tygon Medical/Surgical Tubing S-50-HL''&amp;nbsp;— Characterized to the latest [[ISO 10993]] standards and U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) guidelines for [[biocompatibility]].  This material is non-toxic, non-[[hemolysis|hemolytic]], and non-[[Pyrogen (fever)|pyrogenic]]. This formulation is used in minimally invasive devices, [[dialysis]] equipment, for [[bypass procedure]]s, and [[chemotherapy]] drug delivery.

''Tygon Medical Tubing S-54-HL'' was introduced in 1964 for use in medical applications.  This material can be used in [[catheter]]s, for intravenous or intra-arterial infusion and other surgical uses.  Tygon S-54-HL can also be fabricated into [[cannula]]e or protective sheath products using [[thermoforming]] and flaring techniques.

====Pharmaceutical====
''Tygon LFL'' (Long Flex Life) pump tubing is non-toxic clear tubing with broad chemical resistance.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}  It is often used in product filtration and fermentation and [[surfactant]] delivery.

''Tygon 2275 High Purity Tubing'' is a plasticizer-free material that is often used in sterile filling and dispensing systems and diagnostic equipment. This formulation is also considered to have low [[absorption (chemistry)|absorption]]/[[adsorption]] properties, which minimizes the risk of fluid alteration.

''Tygon 2275 I.B. High-Purity Pressure Tubing'' is plasticizer-free and is reinforced with a braid for use with elevated working pressures.

===Peristaltic pumps===
Many formulations of Tygon can be used in [[peristaltic pump]]s, including the following:

''Tygon R-3603 Laboratory Tubing'' is commonly used in chemical laboratories.  It is often used in incubators and as a replacement for rubber tubing for [[Bunsen burner]]s.  This material is produced in vacuum sizes and can withstand a full vacuum at room temperature.

''Tygon R-1000 Ultra-Soft Tubing'' is used in general laboratory applications.   It is the softest of the Tygon formulations with a [[Shore durometer|durometer]] hardness of Shore A 40 (ASTM Method D2240-02).  Because of the low [[durometer]] of this material it is often used in low-[[torque]] peristaltic pumps.

''Tygon LFL'' (Long Flex Life) Pump Tubing, ''Tygon 3350'', ''Tygon S-50-HL Medical/Surgical'' Tubing, ''Tygon 2275 High Purity Tubing'', and ''Tygon 2001'' Tubing are also used in peristaltic pump applications.

=== Plasticizer-free/non-DEHP ===
Tygon tubing is available in Plasticizer-free/non-[[DEHP]] (non-[[Phthalate]])-formulations.  These formulations have a high degree of chemical resistance and do not release any hazardous material when properly incinerated. ''Tygon 2275 High Purity tubing'', ''Tygon Ultra Chemical Resistant Tubing 2075'', and ''Tygon Plasticizer Free Tubing 2001'' are all [[plasticizer]]-free. "ND-100 series" products are non-DEHP and use a non-Phthalate plasticizer.

''Tygon Silver'' Tubing has a plasticizer-free inner bore and a [[silver]]-based compound on the inner surface to decrease bacterial growth and protect against [[microbes]].

===Industrial use===
There are several formulations of Tygon that are used in industrial applications.

* ''Tygon Fuel and Lubricant Tubing F-4040-A'' is translucent yellow for positive identification and flow monitoring.  It is used in small engine fuel lines, [[recreational vehicle]]s, and lubrication lines.
* ''Tygon LP1100'' is a low permeation [[Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] and [[California Air Resources Board|CARB]] certified fuel line&lt;ref&gt;http://www.processsystems.saint-gobain.com/tygon-lp1100-tubing.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; also used in small engines. 
* ''Tygon R-3400 UV Resistant Tubing'' is black in color and opaque.  It remains flexible in [[ultraviolet]] (UV) environments and is often used for electrical insulation, ink, and adhesive dispensing, and fertilizer and pesticide dispensing.  Because it is resistant to UV light, [[ozone]], and weathering, it is commonly used in outdoor applications.
* ''Tygon 2075 Ultra Chemical Resistant Tubing'' is a plasticizer-free material that is known for its high degree of chemical resistance.  It can be used in ink and printing fluid dispensing, paint and solvent production, and is resistant to [[Butanone|MEK]] and other chemicals. When properly incinerated it releases only [[carbon dioxide]] and water.
* ''Tygon 2375 Ultra Chemical Resistant Tubing'' is now replacing Tygon 2075.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8016">'''Uzawa's theorem''', also known as the '''steady state growth theorem''', is a theorem in [[Economic growth|economic growth theory]] concerning the form that [[technological change]] can take in the [[Solow–Swan model|Solow–Swan]] and [[Ramsey–Cass–Koopmans model|Ramsey–Cass–Koopmans]] growth models. It was first proved by Japanese economist [[Hirofumi Uzawa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Uzawa|first=Hirofumi|date=Summer 1961|title=Neutral Inventions and the Stability of Growth Equilibrium|url=|journal=The Review of Economic Studies|volume=28|pages=117-124|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One general version of the theorem consists of two parts.&lt;ref name="Jones &amp; Scrimgeour"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Charles I. |last=Jones |first2=Dean |last2=Scrimgeour |year=2008 |title=A New Proof of Uzawa's Steady-State Growth Theorem |journal=[[Review of Economics and Statistics]] |volume=90 |issue=1 |pages=180–182 |doi=10.1162/rest.90.1.180  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introduction to Modern Economic Growth|last=Acemoglu|first=Daron|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2009|isbn=978-0-691-13292-1|location=Princeton, New Jersey|pages=60-61}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first states that, under the normal assumptions of the Solow and Neoclassical models, if (after some time T) capital, investment, consumption, and output are increasing at constant exponential rates, these rates must be equivalent. Building on this result, the second part asserts that, within such a balanced growth path, the production function, &lt;math&gt;Y = \tilde{F}(\tilde{A},K,L)&lt;/math&gt; (where &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is technology, &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is capital, and &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is labor), can be rewritten such that technological change affects output solely as a scalar on labor (i.e. &lt;math&gt;Y = F(K,AL)&lt;/math&gt;) a property known as [[labor-augmenting]] or [[Harrod neutral|Harrod-neutral]] technological change. 

Uzawa's theorem demonstrates a significant limitation of the commonly used Neoclassical and Solow models. Imposing the assumption of balanced growth within such models requires that technological change by labor-augmenting. By contraposition, any production function for which it is not possible to represent the effect of technology as a scalar on labor cannot produce a balanced growth path.&lt;ref name="Jones &amp; Scrimgeour" /&gt;

== Statement of Theorem ==
Throughout this page, a dot over a variable will denote its derivative with respect to time (i.e. &lt;math&gt;\dot{X}(t)\equiv {dX(t) \over dt}&lt;/math&gt;). Also, the growth rate of a variable &lt;math&gt;X(t)&lt;/math&gt; will be denoted &lt;math&gt;g_X\equiv \frac{\dot{X}(t)}{X(t)}&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Uzawa's theorem''' 

(The following version is found in Acemoglu (2009) and adapted from Schlicht (2006))

Model with aggregate production function &lt;math&gt;Y(t)=\tilde{F}(\tilde{A}(t),K(t),L(t))&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\tilde{F}:\mathbb{R}^2_+ \times \mathcal{A}\to \mathbb{R}_+&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tilde{A}(t)\in \mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; represents technology at time t (where &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{A}&lt;/math&gt; is an arbitrary subset of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^N&lt;/math&gt; for some natural number &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;). Assume that &lt;math&gt;\tilde{F}&lt;/math&gt; exhibits constant returns to scale in &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;. The growth in capital at time t is given by

&lt;math&gt;\dot{K}(t)=Y(t)-C(t)-\delta K(t)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\delta &lt;/math&gt; is the depreciation rate and &lt;math&gt;C(t)&lt;/math&gt; is consumption at time t. 

Suppose that population grows at a constant rate, &lt;math&gt;L(t)=\exp(nt)L(0)&lt;/math&gt;, and that there exists some time &lt;math&gt;T &lt; \infty&lt;/math&gt; such that for all &lt;math&gt;t\geq T&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\dot{Y}(t)/Y(t)=g_Y&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\dot{K}(t)/K(t)=g_K&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\dot{C}(t)/C(t)=g_C&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;. Then 

1. &lt;math&gt;g_Y = g_K = g_C&lt;/math&gt;; and

2. For any &lt;math&gt;t \geq T&lt;/math&gt; , there exists a function &lt;math&gt;F:\mathbb{R}^2_+ \to \mathbb{R}_+&lt;/math&gt; that is homogeneous of degree 1 in its two arguments, such that the aggregate production function can be represented as ''&lt;math&gt;Y(t)=F(K(t),A(t)L(t))&lt;/math&gt;'', where &lt;math&gt;A(t)\in \mathbb{R}_+&lt;/math&gt; and  &lt;math&gt;g \equiv \dot{A}(t)/A(t) =g_Y-n&lt;/math&gt;.

== Sketch of proof ==
===Lemma 1===
For any constant &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;g_{X^\alpha Y}=\alpha g_X+g_Y&lt;/math&gt;.

'''Proof''': Observe that for any &lt;math&gt;Z(t)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;g_{Z}= \frac{\dot{Z}(t)}{Z(t)}= \frac{d\ln Z(t)}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore,
&lt;math&gt;g_{X^\alpha Y} = \frac{d}{dt}\ln [(X(t))^\alpha Y(t)]=\alpha\frac{d\ln X(t)}{dt}+\frac{d\ln Y(t)}{dt}=\alpha g_X+g_Y&lt;/math&gt;.

===Proof of theorem===
We first show that the growth rate of investment &lt;math&gt;I(t)=Y(t)-C(t)&lt;/math&gt; must equal the growth rate of capital &lt;math&gt;K(t)&lt;/math&gt; (i.e. &lt;math&gt;g_I=g_K&lt;/math&gt;) 

The resource constraint at time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; implies 
:&lt;math&gt;\dot{K}(t)=I(t)-\delta K(t)&lt;/math&gt;
By definition of &lt;math&gt;g_K&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\dot{K}(t)=g_K K(t)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;t\geq T&lt;/math&gt; . Therefore, the previous equation implies
:&lt;math&gt;g_K+\delta=\frac{I(t)}{K(t)}&lt;/math&gt;
for all &lt;math&gt;t\geq T&lt;/math&gt;. The left-hand side is a constant, while the right-hand side grows at &lt;math&gt;g_I-g_K&lt;/math&gt; (by Lemma 1). Therefore, &lt;math&gt;0=g_I-g_K&lt;/math&gt; and thus
:&lt;math&gt;g_I=g_K&lt;/math&gt;.
From [[Gross domestic product#Expenditure approach|national income accounting for a closed economy]], final goods in the economy must either be consumed or invested, thus for all &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;Y(t)=C(t)+I(t)&lt;/math&gt;
Differentiating with respect to time yields
:&lt;math&gt;\dot{Y}(t)=\dot{C}(t)+\dot{I}(t)&lt;/math&gt;
Dividing both sides by &lt;math&gt;Y(t)&lt;/math&gt; yields
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\dot{Y}(t)}{Y(t)}=\frac{\dot{C}(t)}{Y(t)}+\frac{\dot{I}(t)}{Y(t)}=\frac{\dot{C}(t)}{C(t)}\frac{C(t)}{Y(t)}+\frac{\dot{I}(t)}{I(t)}\frac{I(t)}{Y(t)}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\Rightarrow g_Y=g_C\frac{C(t)}{Y(t)}+g_I\frac{I(t)}{Y(t)}=g_C\frac{C(t)}{Y(t)}+g_I(1-\frac{C(t)}{Y(t)})=(g_C-g_I)\frac{C(t)}{Y(t)}+g_I&lt;/math&gt;
Since &lt;math&gt;g_Y, g_C&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g_I&lt;/math&gt; are constants, &lt;math&gt;\frac{C(t)}{Y(t)}&lt;/math&gt; is a constant. Therefore, the growth rate of &lt;math&gt;\frac{C(t)}{Y(t)}&lt;/math&gt; is zero. By Lemma 1, it implies that 
:&lt;math&gt; g_c-g_Y=0&lt;/math&gt;
Similarly, &lt;math&gt;g_Y= g_I&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, &lt;math&gt;g_Y = g_C = g_K&lt;/math&gt;.                                                                                                                                                   

Next we show that for any &lt;math&gt;t\geq T&lt;/math&gt;, the production function can be represented as one with labor-augmenting technology.

The production function at time &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is 
:&lt;math&gt;Y(T)=\tilde{F}(\tilde{A}(T), K(T), L(T))&lt;/math&gt;
The constant [[Returns to scale|return to scale]] property of production (&lt;math&gt;\tilde{F}&lt;/math&gt; is [[Homogeneous function|homogeneous of degree one]] in &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;) implies that for any &lt;math&gt;t\geq T&lt;/math&gt;, multiplying both sides of the previous equation by &lt;math&gt;\frac{Y(t)}{Y(T)}&lt;/math&gt; yields
:&lt;math&gt;Y(T)\frac{Y(t)}{Y(T)}=\tilde{F}(\tilde{A}(T), K(T)\frac{Y(t)}{Y(T)}, L(T)\frac{Y(t)}{Y(T)})&lt;/math&gt;
Note that &lt;math&gt;\frac{Y(t)}{Y(T)}=\frac{K(t)}{K(T)}&lt;/math&gt; because &lt;math&gt;g_Y=g_K&lt;/math&gt;(refer to [[Ordinary differential equation#Summary of exact solutions|solution to differential equations]] for proof of this step). Thus, the above equation can be rewritten as
:&lt;math&gt;Y(t)=\tilde{F}(\tilde{A}(T), K(t), L(T)\frac{Y(t)}{Y(T)})&lt;/math&gt; 
For any &lt;math&gt;t\geq T&lt;/math&gt;, define 
:&lt;math&gt;A(t)\equiv\frac{Y(t)}{L(t)}\frac{L(T)}{Y(T)}&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;F(K(t),A(t)L(t))\equiv\tilde{F}(\tilde{A}(T), K(t), L(t)A(t))&lt;/math&gt;
Combining the two equations yields 
:&lt;math&gt;F(K(t),A(t)L(t))=\tilde{F}(\tilde{A}(T), K(t), L(T)\frac{Y(t)}{Y(T)})=Y(t)&lt;/math&gt; for any &lt;math&gt;t\geq T&lt;/math&gt;.
By construction, &lt;math&gt;F(K,AL)&lt;/math&gt; is also [[Homogeneous function|homogeneous of degree one]] in its two arguments.

Moreover, by Lemma 1, the growth rate of &lt;math&gt;A(t)&lt;/math&gt; is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\dot{A}(t)}{A(t)}=\frac{\dot{Y}(t)}{Y(t)}-\frac{\dot{L}(t)}{L(t)}=g_Y-n&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\blacksquare&lt;/math&gt;

The '''welfare of farmed insects''' concerns treatment of insects raised for [[animal feed]], [[pet food]], human consumption ([[entomophagy]]), and other purposes like honey and silk.

==Debate over the issue's significance==

Scientists remain uncertain about the existence and degree of [[pain in invertebrates]], including insects. Nonetheless, insect welfare is being taken increasingly seriously in laboratory settings.&lt;ref name=Smith1991&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=Jane A.|title=A Question of Pain in Invertebrates|journal=ILAR Journal|date=1991|volume=33|issue=1–2|pages=25–31|doi=10.1093/ilar.33.1-2.25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sherwin, 2001"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Sherwin, C.M.|year=2001|title=Can invertebrates suffer? Or, how robust is argument-by-analogy? |journal=Animal Welfare (supplement)|volume=10|pages=103–118}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Vincent Wigglesworth suggested a precautionary approach of anaesthetizing insects during potentially painful procedures.&lt;ref name=Wigglesworth1980&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wigglesworth|first=Vincent B.|title=Do insects feel pain?|journal=Antenna|date=1980|pages=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Cooper has written about techniques for "[[Anesthesia]], [[analgesia]], and euthanasia of invertebrates" including insects.&lt;ref name=Cooper2011&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cooper|first=John E.|title=Anesthesia, analgesia, and euthanasia of invertebrates|journal=ILAR Journal|date=2011|volume=52|issue=2|pages=196–204|doi=10.1093/ilar.52.2.196}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neil A.

Some authors have begun extending discussions of insect welfare beyond the laboratory to the domain of raising insects for food.&lt;ref name=ErensEtAl2012 /&gt;&lt;ref name=DeGoedeEtAl2013&gt;{{cite book|last=De Goede|first=D.

For instance, World Ento uses the name "Good Karma Killing" to describe its process of freezing insects into a statis state.&lt;ref name=WorldEnto2014&gt;{{cite web|title=Current Products and Prices|url=http://worldento.wordpress.com/author/worldento/|publisher=World Ento|accessdate=31 May 2014|date=22 Oct 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2013 [[FAO]] report on "Edible insects" includes a section encouraging high standards of welfare in entomophagy operations, despite uncertainty about whether insects can suffer.&lt;ref name=FAO2013&gt;{{cite book|author1=Arnold van Huis|author2=Joost Van Itterbeeck|author3=Harmke Klunder|author4=Esther Mertens|author5=Afton Halloran|author6=Giulia Muir|author7=Paul Vantomme|title=Edible insects: Future prospects for food and feed security|date=2013|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|location=Rome|isbn=978-92-5-107596-8|page=65|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/018/i3253e/i3253e05.pdf|accessdate=1 June 2014|chapter=5.6. Animal Welfare}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Others feel that considering the wellbeing of farmed insects is going too far. Rhys Southan suggests that even most [[veganism|vegans]] do not care a lot about insects, but that "Insects are to animal rights what [[Larry Flynt]] is to the First Amendment – you have to uphold their rights even if you don’t want to, or the whole thing falls apart."

== Welfare considerations for rearing ==

Because there is little standardized protocol for insect rearing, most farmers learn the best production methods by trial and error. For instance, if they kill an insect colony by setting the temperature too high, they avoid doing that in the future. Most breeders keep their techniques secret in order to avoid having them copied by other farms.&lt;ref name=ErensEtAl2012 /&gt;

Because there are so many types of insects, it is not feasible to devise a single protocol for their treatment. Case-by-case understanding is required.&lt;ref name=ErensEtAl2012&gt;{{cite web|last=Erens|first=Jesse|title=A bug’s life: Large-scale insect rearing in relation to animal welfare|url=http://venik.nl/site/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Rapport-Large-scale-insect-rearing-in-relation-to-animal-welfare.pdf|publisher=Wageningen University|accessdate=13 May 2014|last2=Es van|first2=Sam|last3=Haverkort|first3=Fay|last4=Kapsomenou|first4=Eleni|last5=Luijben|first5=Andy|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Disease ===

When viruses infect an insect-rearing facility, they spread rapidly and kill most of the insects.&lt;ref name=DeGoedeEtAl2013 /&gt;

Humans can spread diseases to farmed insects. Thus, sanitation is very important, and only farm staff should have access to the insects. For instance, the company Van de Ven had a pathogen outbreak that killed all of its ''[[Zophobas morio]]'' worms, and the breeders hypothesized that the disease may have been brought by human visitors.&lt;ref name=ErensEtAl2012 /&gt;

Giving insects a heat gradient may sometimes help prevent disease&lt;ref name=ErensEtAl2012 /&gt; because behavioral [[Insect thermoregulation|thermoregulation]] can suppress pathogens.&lt;ref name=OuedraogoEtAl2004&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ouedraogo|first1=R. M.|author2=M. S. Goettel|author3=J. Brodeur|title=Behavioral thermoregulation in the migratory locust: a therapy to overcome fungal infection|journal=Oecologia|date=2004|volume=138|issue=2|pages=312–319|doi=10.1007/s00442-003-1431-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Humidity ===

Walter Jansen's Jagran company raises [[housefly]] larvae for use as animal feed. Humidity needs to be carefully controlled to avoid dehydrating or drowning the insects.&lt;ref name=ErensEtAl2012 /&gt;

=== Temperature ===

Insects are [[poikilothermic]], but maintaining an adequate temperature range remains important.&lt;ref name=DeGoedeEtAl2013 /&gt; For example, mealworms thrive best when living close together, but this can lead to overheating if temperature is not controlled.&lt;ref name=ErensEtAl2012 /&gt;

=== Cannibalism ===

Some insects like locusts begin eating each other when they become overcrowded or malnourished. Adequate space and nutrition are important to prevent this.&lt;ref name=ErensEtAl2012 /&gt;

== Slaughter methods ==

===Developing world===

[[Entomophag]]y is common in many developing countries, such as [[Thai cuisine#Insects|Thailand]] and [[Chapulines|Mexico]]. Usually killing is done without [[euthanasia]]. For instance:

* [[Termite]]s are either eaten alive directly where they're found or are brought home to be roasted over coals or fried.
* [[Cicada]]s are boiled, fried, or sautéed.
* [[True water bug|Water bug]]s may be eaten whole, steamed, fried, or roasted and canned.
* [[Scorpion]]s are skewered alive and fried in oil.
* [[Tarantula]]s are fried in oil or roasted over a fire.&lt;ref name=Greenfield2011&gt;{{cite web|last=Greenfield|first=Beth|title=15 Insects You Won't Believe Are Edible|url=http://www.budgettravel.com/feature/15-insects-you-wont-believe-are-edible,7925/|publisher=Budget Travel|accessdate=1 June 2014|date=21 Oct 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Industrial farms===

Little research has been done on humane methods of killing insects for consumption.&lt;ref name=DeGoedeEtAl2013 /&gt;

The most common killing methods used by entomophagy companies in the Netherlands are freezing and dry-freezing (i.e., freezing and reducing pressure in order to extract water from the insects).&lt;ref name=DeGoedeEtAl2013 /&gt;

Protix Biosystems kills its [[Hermetia illucens|black soldier flies]] by shredding, since its end product is a powder. Death takes less than a second. Tarique Arsiwalla at Protix said shredding makes sense because Western consumers are more likely to accept powdered insects than whole insects.&lt;ref name=ErensEtAl2012 /&gt;

The Jagran company has tried asphyxiation, cooling, freeze-drying, boiling, and shredding. Managing Director Walter Jansen believes that shredding is most humane.&lt;ref name=ErensEtAl2012 /&gt;

The Kreca company kills its animal-feed insects by putting them into a fridge or freeze-drying them. Insects destined for human consumption are first sterilized in hot water and then are refrigerated or freeze-dried.&lt;ref name=ErensEtAl2012 /&gt;

FAO's "Edible insects" report suggests: "Insect-killing methods that would reduce suffering include freezing or instantaneous techniques such as shredding."&lt;ref name=FAO2013 /&gt;

====Freezing====

While freezing is sometimes said to be a humane way to kill certain arthropods,&lt;ref name=King2014 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Euthanizing2012&gt;{{cite web|title=Euthanizing Insects|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Wr6E44nBlU|publisher=Colorado Plateau Biodiversity Center|accessdate=31 May 2014|date=6 Aug 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; others dispute this.&lt;ref name=Pizzi2012&gt;{{cite book|last=Pizzi|first=Romain|title=Invertebrate Medicine|date=2012|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=978-0813817583|page=211|edition=2nd|editor=Gregory A.

Invertebrates}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to "[[American Veterinary Medical Association|AVMA]] Guidelines for the Euthanasia of Animals," freezing is "not considered to be humane" when not preceded by another form of anesthesia.&lt;ref name=AVMA2013&gt;{{cite web|title=AVMA Guidelines for the Euthanasia of Animals: 2013 Edition|url=https://www.avma.org/kb/policies/documents/euthanasia.pdf|page=76|publisher=American Veterinary Medical Association|accessdate=12 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[British and Irish Association of Zoos and Aquariums]] (BIAZA) Terrestrial Invertebrate Working Group (TIWG) reports on a survey conducted by Mark Bushell of BIAZA institutions. He found that refrigeration and freezing were the most common methods "of euthanasia of invertebrates although research has suggested that this is probably one of the least ethical options." That said, freezing is a worst-case method if chemical or instantaneous physical destruction is not possible.&lt;ref name=BIAZA2013&gt;{{cite book|author1=Sarah Pellett|author2=Romain Pizzi|author3=Steven Trim|author4=Mark Bushell|author5=Dave Clarke|author6=Jamie Wood|title=BIAZA Recommendations for Ethical Euthanasia of Invertebrates|date=Apr 2013|publisher=British and Irish Association of Zoos and Aquariums|edition=1.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hobbyist entomophagy===

Some "how to" guides for eating insects make no mention of freezing or other euthanasia methods. For example, Miles Olson recommends
* suffocating or roasting ants
* decapitating, gutting, and then stewing, roasting, or sautéing slugs
* steaming and slicing snails
* frying, roasting, toasting, suffocating, or drowning crickets
* drowning, squeezing, and then stir frying or stewing earthworms
* eating aphids raw
and so on.&lt;ref name=Olson2012&gt;{{cite book|last1=Olson|first1=Miles|title=Unlearn, Rewild: Earth Skills, Ideas and Inspiration for the Future Primitive|date=2012|publisher=New Society Publishers|isbn=978-0865717213|pages=193–202|chapter=22. Exploring Entomophagy: Bugs as Food}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The website Insects Are Food suggests refrigerating insects to slow them down without killing them, prior to boiling or otherwise cooking them.&lt;ref name=IAF&gt;{{cite web|title=IAF Frequently Asked Questions|url=http://www.insectsarefood.com/faq.html|website=Insects Are Food|accessdate=1 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other guides recommend freezing first.&lt;ref name=Price&gt;{{cite web|last=Price|first=Aletheia|title=Eating Bugs!|url=http://www.manataka.org/page160.html|accessdate=31 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tarantola2013&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tarantola|first1=Andrew|title=Why, How, and Where You Should Start Eating Bugs|url=https://gizmodo.com/why-how-and-where-you-should-start-eating-bugs-1301815024|website=Gizmodo|accessdate=1 June 2014|date=16 Sep 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Timothy Ferriss]] recounts what he observed when roasted his insects without freezing them first: "Suffice it to say, merely sedated crickets make horrible noises if you roast them, and the visual is far, far worse. Do yourself a favor and freeze them."&lt;ref name=Ferriss2012&gt;{{cite book|last=Ferriss|first=Timothy|title=The 4-Hour Chef: The Simple Path to Cooking Like a Pro, Learning Anything, and Living the Good Life|date=2012|publisher=New Harvest|isbn=978-0547884592}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Live insect feed===

Sometimes insects are not killed by farming companies but are sold [[Live food|live]], for consumption by fish and pets. 95% of the Kreca company's insects are sold live. Of the 1500&amp;nbsp;kg per week of mealworms produced by the Van de Ven company, most are sold as live feed.&lt;ref name=ErensEtAl2012 /&gt;

Many suppliers of insects for reptiles offer live bugs and worms.&lt;ref name=Livefoods&gt;{{cite web|title=Livefoods Direct Ltd - Britain's Foremost Supplier Of Livefoods|url=http://www.livefoodsdirect.co.uk/|accessdate=1 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Reptilefood&gt;{{cite web|title=Reptilefood.com|url=http://www.reptilefood.com/|accessdate=1 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Timberline&gt;{{cite web|title=Timberline Live Pet Food|url=http://www.timberlinefisheries.com/|accessdate=1 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Monitor lizards are typically fed live insects and may not eat pre-killed ones.&lt;ref name=Monitor&gt;{{cite web|title=The Monitor FAQ--Feeding|url=http://www.kingsnake.com/monitorfaq/feeding.htm|accessdate=1 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Amphibians typically require live insects—wild-caught, home-grown, or bought at a pet store—although some like [[axolotls]] can be fed chunks of meat.&lt;ref name=NZFrogs&gt;{{cite web|title=Keeping Frogs!|url=http://www.nzfrogs.org/Resources/Kids+Information/Keeping+Frogs.html|website=New Zealand Frogs|accessdate=1 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It's generally hard to convert reptiles and amphibians that eat insects to pre-killed prey,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kaplan|first1=Melissa|title=Feeding Prekilled vs. Live Prey|url=http://www.anapsid.org/prekill.html|website=Melissa Kaplan's Herp and Green Iguana Information Collection|accessdate=1 June 2014|date=1 Jan 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; though some pet owners can feed dead insects by moving or dangling them.&lt;ref name=FrogForum&gt;{{cite web|title=Pre-killed feeding?|url=http://www.frogforum.net/food-feeders-live-frozen-culturing-etc/3003-pre-killed-feeding.html|website=Frog Forum|accessdate=1 June 2014|date=3–5 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bearded dragons can be fed dead crickets by hiding them in other food, dangling them with tongs, squirting them with water, or vibrating a bowl.&lt;ref name=Team&gt;{{cite web|last1=Team|first1=Ben|title=How to Get Bearded Dragons to Eat Canned Crickets|url=http://animals.pawnation.com/bearded-dragons-eat-canned-crickets-5897.html|website=PawNation|accessdate=1 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pet spiders, praying mantids, and other insectivorous bugs typically require live food.&lt;ref name=KeepingInsects&gt;{{cite web|author=Linda|title=Feeder insects for your predatory insects|url=http://www.keepinginsects.com/general-care/live-food/|website=Keeping Insects|accessdate=1 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hedgehogs can be fed live, freeze-dried, or canned insects.&lt;ref name=Dick&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dick|first1=Gail|title=Insects a La Carte|url=http://www.hedgehogheadquarters.com/secure/insects.htm|website=Hedgehog Headquarters|accessdate=1 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Live worms and insects are commonly used as [[fishing bait]], with the result that they are either eaten alive by fish or drowned.

== Farmed insects not used for protein ==

Many vegans [[Veganism#Milk.2C eggs.2C honey and silk|avoid honey and silk]] because these require insect farming, even though the insects are not eaten. Silk production [[Silk#Animal rights|involves]] boiling silk worms alive in their cocoons.

The red pigment carmine [[Carmine#Production|is produced]] from powdered bodies of [[scale insect]]s, so some vegans avoid it.&lt;ref name=CarmineVegan&gt;{{cite web|title=Is Carmine Vegan?|url=http://www.isitvegan.com/2011/03/10/is-carmine-vegan/|website=Is It Vegan?|accessdate=1 June 2014|date=10 Mar 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Shreeves2012&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shreeves|first1=Robin|title=What is carmine and why is Starbucks taking it out of its products?|url=http://www.mnn.com/food/healthy-eating/blogs/what-is-carmine-and-why-is-starbucks-taking-it-out-of-its-products|website=Mother Nature Network|accessdate=1 June 2014|date=24 Apr 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Yacoubou2013&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yacoubou|first1=Jeanne|title=Alternatives to Insect-Derived Food Colors|url=http://www.vrg.org/blog/2013/01/02/alternatives-to-insect-derived-food-colors/|website=Vegetarian Resource Group Blog|accessdate=1 June 2014|date=2 Jan 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Shellac]] is produced from a resin secreted by the [[Kerria lacca|lac bug]] on specific trees in Asia. In addition to its use in industry, shellac is incorporated into some fruits, coffee beans, and candies as [[confectioner's glaze]]. Some vegans avoid confectioner's glaze because lac bugs may be killed during shellac production.&lt;ref name=Yacoubou2010&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yacoubou|first1=Jeanne|title=Q &amp; A on Shellac|url=http://www.vrg.org/blog/2010/11/30/q-a-on-shellac/|website=Vegetarian Resource Group|accessdate=3 July 2014|date=30 Nov 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Flinn2011&gt;{{cite web|last1=Flinn|first1=Angel|title=Shellac &amp; Food Glaze|url=http://gentleworld.org/shellac-food-glaze/|website=Gentle World|accessdate=3 July 2014|date=15 Aug 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lac]] used to produce red dye may be even more injurious to lac bugs because while shellac comes from lac-bug secretions, lac dye's color comes from the insect bodies themselves.&lt;ref name=FAO1995Ch5&gt;{{cite book|last1=Green|first1=C.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1656">'''Wide span vehicle''' is a special type of farming vehicle that is much wider than a typical vehicle.  '''Wide span vehicles''' can measure up to {{convert|10|m|ft|adj=on}} wide or wider.  The impetus behind wide span vehicles in farming is to reduce the amount of soil that becomes damaged (''e.g.'', from compaction) from farm vehicles.  [[Controlled traffic farming]] (CTF) is also aimed at solving this problem and both CTF and wide span vehicles can be used together to further improve land use.

The many benefits of using wide span vehicles in farming include improved soil quality, less land lost to wheelways, increase in farm profits, less fuel use, reduced chemical use from more precise application, and increased types of land available for [[organic farming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==History==

[[David Dowler]] was a pioneer of wide span vehicle farming and created a first prototype gantry, called P1, in January 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; Dowler went on to build and apply for patents on many wide span-related machines.
