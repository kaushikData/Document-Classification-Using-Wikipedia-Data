'''Aimaq''' or '''Aimaqi''' ({{lang-aiq|ایماقی}}) is the dominant eastern [[Persian language|Persian]] [[ethnolect]] spoken by the [[Aimaq people]] in central northwest [[Afghanistan]] (west of the [[Hazarajat]]), eastern [[Iran]], and [[Tajikistan]]. It is close to the [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasani]] and [[Dari language|Dari]] varieties of Persian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Aimaq |url=http://www.everyculture.com/Africa-Middle-East/Aimaq.html |date= |work=World Culture Encyclopedia |publisher=everyculture.com |accessdate=14 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Aimaq people are thought to have a 5–15% literacy rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Aimaq |url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=aiq|year=2009 |work= |publisher=Ethnologue |accessdate=14 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dialects ==
Subdialects of Aimaq dialect include:
* Changezi
* Firozkohi
* Jamshidi (also known as: Jamshedi, Djamchidi, Yemchidi, or Dzhemshid)
* Maliki
* Mizmast
* Taimani
* Taimuri (also known as: Teimuri, Timuri, or Taimouri)
* Zainal
* Zohri (also known as: Zuri)

==Phonology==
Phonetically, as one of the eastern Persian dialects, Aimaq dialect resembles a formal or classical form of [[Persian language|Persian]].

Vowels:
* The "majhul" vowels ''ē'' / ''ī'' and ''ō'' / ''ū'' are still kept separate, whereas in [[western Persian]] they are merged as ''ī'' and ''ū'' respectively. For instance, the identically written words شیر  'lion' and 'milk' are in western Persian both pronounced [šīr], but in Aimaq [šēr] for 'lion' and [šīr] for 'milk'. The long vowel in زود 'quick' and زور 'strong' is realized as [ū] in western Persian, in contrast, these words are pronounced as [zūd] and [zōr] respectively by Aimaq speakers.
* The [[diphthong]]s of early Classical Persian ''aw'' (as ''ow'' in Engl. ''cow'') and ''ay'' (as ''i'' in English ''ice'') have in Aimaq become {{IPA|[ow]}} (as in Engl. ''low'') and {{IPA|[ej]}} (as in Engl. ''day''). Dari, on the other hand, is more archaic, e.g. نوروز 'Persian New Year' is realized as {{IPA|[nowrūz]}} in Iranian, and {{IPA|[nawrōz]}} in Aimaq, and نخیر 'no' is uttered as {{IPA|[naχejr]}} in Iranian, and as {{IPA|[naχajr]}} in Aimaq.
* The high short vowels [i] and [u] tend to be lowered in western Persian to [e] and [o].
* {{IPA|/æ/}}{{clarify|reason=pronunciations above use [a], not [æ]|date=January 2015}} and {{IPA|/e/}} are in Aimaq kept separate in word-final positions, unlike western Persian, where {{IPA|/æ/}} has {{IPA|[e]}} as a word-final allophone.

Consonants:
* Aimaq still retains the (classical) bilabial pronunciation {{IPA|[w]}} of the labial consonant و, which is realized as a [[voiced labiodental fricative]] {{IPA|[v]}} in western Persian. {{IPA|[v]}} is found in Aimaq as an allophone of ''f'' before voiced consonants.
* The [[voiced uvular stop]] {{IPA|/ɢ/}} (ق) and [[voiced velar fricative]] {{IPA|/ɣ/}} (غ) are still kept separate in Aimaq. They have coincided in western Persian (probably under the influence of Turkic languages like [[Azeri language|Azeri]] and [[Turkmen language|Turkmen]]).&lt;ref&gt;A. Pisowicz, ''Origins of the New and Middle Persian phonological systems'' (Cracow 1985), p. 112-114, 117.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Albanian''' ({{lang|sq|shqip}} {{IPA-sq|ʃcip|}}, or {{lang|sq|gjuha shqipe}} {{IPA-sq|ˈɟuha ˈʃcipɛ|}}) is a language of the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European family]], in which it occupies an independent branch.  It is an official language in [[Albania]] and [[Kosovo]] and has official minority status in [[Italy]], [[Romania]], [[Montenegro]], [[Serbia]], [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]]  and others. The language has an official status in [[Ulcinj]], southern [[Montenegro]]. Albanian is also spoken by large [[Albanian diaspora|Albanian communities]] elsewhere in Europe, the Americas and Australia.

The two main [[Albanian dialects|dialects]] of Albanian are [[Gheg Albanian|Gheg]] and [[Tosk Albanian|Tosk]]. Gheg is primarily spoken in the north, while Tosk is spoken in the south. Standard Albanian is based on the Tosk dialect. The number of Albanian speakers in the [[Balkans]] is estimated to be approximately 5 million.&lt;ref name="e18" /&gt;

Centuries-old communities speaking Albanian dialects can be found scattered in [[Croatia]] (the [[Arbanasi people|Arbanasi]]), [[Greece]] (the [[Arvanites]] and some communities in [[Epirus (region)|Epirus]], [[Western Macedonia]] and [[Albanian-speakers of Western Thrace|Western Thrace]]),&lt;ref name = Euromosaic&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.uoc.edu/euromosaic/web/document/albanes/fr/i2/i2.html| title = L'arvanite/albanais en Grèce| accessdate = 2016-12-05| author = Euromosaic project| year = 2006| publisher = [[European Commission]]| location = Brussels| language = French}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Italy]] (the [[Arbëreshë people|Arbëreshë]] immigrants in [[Italy]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.minorityrights.org/1617/italy/albanians.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-01-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120121173237/http://www.minorityrights.org/1617/italy/albanians.html |archivedate=21 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in [[Albanians of Romania|Romania]] and [[Albanians in Ukraine|Ukraine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.albanianlanguage.net/ |title=Robert Elsie |publisher=The Albanian Language |date=1972-11-25 |accessdate=2017-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a large [[Albanian diaspora]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Fatjona Mejdini |url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/albania-registers-diaspora-after-more-than-two-decade-12-14-2015 |title=Albania Aims to Register its Huge Diaspora |publisher=Balkan Insight |date=2013-05-03 |accessdate=2017-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geographic distribution==
{{Main|Albanians}}

[[File:Dialect map albania.png|upright=0.9|thumb|The dialects of Albanian]]

The language is spoken by approximately 7 million people primarily in Albania, [[Kosovo]], [[Greece]], [[Italy]], [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]] and [[Montenegro]]. However, due to the large [[Albanian diaspora]], the total number of speakers is much higher than the native speakers in [[Southern Europe]].&lt;ref name="e18"/&gt;

===Europe===

The Albanian language is the official language of [[Albania]] and [[Kosovo]]. It is spoken by the entire [[Albanians|Albanian]] population in both. Albanian is a recognised minority language in [[Croatia]], [[Italy]], [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], [[Montenegro]], [[Romania]] and in [[Serbia]]. Albanian is also spoken in the [[Thesprotia]] and [[Preveza (regional unit)|Preveza]] regional units and in a few villages in [[Ioannina (regional unit)|Ioannina]] and [[Florina (regional unit)|Florina]] regional units in Greece.&lt;ref name="Euromosaic" /&gt;

Albanian is the third most spoken language in [[Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Linguistic diversity among foreign citizens in Italy|url=http://www.istat.it/en/archive/129304|publisher=Statistics of Italy|accessdate=1 April 2015|date=25 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is due to the mass Albanian immigration to Italy. Italy has a historical Albanian minority of about 500,000 which are scattered across southern Italy known as [[Arbëreshë people|Arbëreshë]]. Approximately 1 million Albanians from Kosovo are dispersed throughout [[Albanians in Germany|Germany]], [[Albanians in Switzerland|Switzerland]] and [[Austria]]. These are mainly refugees from Kosovo that migrated during the [[Kosovo War]]. In [[Albanians in Switzerland|Switzerland]], the Albanian language is the [[Languages of Switzerland#Other languages|sixth most spoken language]] with 176,293 native speakers.

===Americas===

There are large numbers of Albanian speakers in the [[Albanian Americans|United States]], [[Argentina]], [[Chile]], [[Uruguay]] and [[Albanian Canadians|Canada]]. Some of the first ethnic Albanians to arrive in the United States were Arbëreshë. Arbëreshe have a strong sense of identity, and are unique in that they speak an archaic dialect of [[Tosk Albanian]] called [[Arbëreshë language|Arbëreshë]].

In North America (United States and Canada) there are approximately 250,000 Albanian speakers. It is spoken in the eastern area of the United States in cities like [[New York City]], [[New Jersey]], [[Boston]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Ohio]], [[Connecticut]] and [[Detroit]]. [[Greater New Orleans]] has a large Arbëresh community. Oftentimes, wherever there are Italians, there are a few Arbëreshe mixed with them. Arbëreshe Americans, therefore are often indistinguishable from Italian Americans due to being assimilated into the [[Italian American]] community.&lt;ref&gt;Edwin E. Jacques, ''The Albanians: An Ethnic History from Prehistoric Times to the Present'', 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Argentina]] there are nearly [[Argentina#Languages|40,000 Albanian speakers]], mostly in [[Buenos Aires]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edoc.bibliothek.uni-halle.de/servlets/MCRFileNodeServlet/HALCoRe_derivate_00003672/Albanianmigration.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-07-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916221528/http://edoc.bibliothek.uni-halle.de/servlets/MCRFileNodeServlet/HALCoRe_derivate_00003672/Albanianmigration.pdf |archivedate=16 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asia and Oceania===

Approximately 1.3 million people of Albanian ancestry live in [[Turkey]], and more than 500,000 recognizing their ancestry, language and [[Culture of Albania|culture]]. There are other estimates, however, that place the number of people in Turkey with Albanian ancestry and or background upward to 5 million. However, the vast majority of this population is [[Language shift|assimilated]] and no longer possesses fluency in the Albanian language, though a vibrant Albanian community maintains its distinct identity in [[Istanbul]] to this day.

In [[Egypt]] there are around 18,000 Albanians, mostly [[Tosk]] speakers.&lt;ref name="Saunders98"&gt;{{harvnb|Saunders|2011|p=98}}. "In addition to the recent emigrants, there are older diasporic communities around the world. There are upwards of 5 million ethnic Albanians in the Turkish Republic; however, the vast majority of this population is assimilated and no longer possesses fluency in the language, though a vibrant Albanian community maintains its distinct identity in Istanbul to this day. Egypt also lays claim to some 18,000 Albanians, supposedly lingering remnants of Mohammad Ali's army."&lt;/ref&gt; Many are descendants of the [[Janissary]] of [[Muhammad Ali Pasha]], an Albanian who became [[Wāli]], and self-declared [[Khedive]] of Egypt and [[Sudan]]. In addition to the [[Muhammad Ali Dynasty|dynasty]] that he established, a large part of the former Egyptian and Sudanese [[aristocracy]] was of Albanian origin. In addition to the recent emigrants, there are older diasporic communities around the world.

Albanian is also spoken by Albanian diaspora communities residing in [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]].

== Dialects ==
{{Main|Albanian dialects}}
[[File:Albanian-dialects.svg|thumb|upright=0.9|The dialects of the Albanian language.]]

The Albanian language has two distinct dialects, [[Tosk Albanian|Tosk]] which is spoken in the south, and [[Gheg Albanian|Gheg]] spoken in the north.&lt;ref&gt;Gjinari, Jorgji. Dialektologjia shqiptare&lt;/ref&gt; Standard Albanian is based on the Tosk dialect. The [[Shkumbin River|Shkumbin river]] is the rough dividing line between the two dialects.&lt;ref&gt;Concise Encyclopedia of Languages of the World By Keith Brown, Sarah Ogilvie Contributor Keith Brown, Sarah Ogilvie Edition: illustrated Published by Elsevier, 2008 {{ISBN|0-08-087774-5}}, {{ISBN|978-0-08-087774-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gheg Albanian|Gheg]] is divided into four sub-dialects, in Northwest Gheg, Northeast Gheg, Central Gheg, and Southern Gheg. It is primarily spoken in northern Albania and throughout [[Albanians in Montenegro|Montenegro]], [[Kosovo]] and northwestern [[Albanians in Macedonia|Macedonia]]. One fairly divergent dialect is the [[Upper Reka Albanian dialect|Upper Reka dialect]], which is however classified as Central Gheg. There is also a diaspora dialect in [[Croatia]], the [[Arbanasi dialect]].

[[Tosk Albanian|Tosk]] is divided into five sub-dialects, including Northern Tosk (the most numerous in speakers), [[Labërisht]], [[Cham Albanian dialect|Çam]], [[Arvanitika]], and [[Arbëreshë language|Arbëresh]]. Tosk is spoken in southern Albania, southwestern Macedonia and northern and southern Greece. Cham Albanian is spoken in North-western Greece, while [[Arvanitika language|Arvanitika]] is spoken by the [[Arvanites]] in southern Greece. In addition [[Arbëresh language|Arbëresh]] is spoken by the [[Arbëreshë people|Arbëreshë]] people, descendants of 15th and 16th century migrants who settled in southeastern Italy, in small communities in the regions of [[Sicily]] and [[Calabria]].

== Orthography ==
{{Main|Albanian alphabet|Albanian braille}}

[[File:Albanian keyboard layout.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Albanian [[keyboard layout]].]]

The Albanian language has been written using many different alphabets since the earliest records from the 14th century. The history of Albanian language orthography is closely related to the cultural orientation and knowledge of certain foreign languages among Albanian writers.{{sfn|Lloshi|2008|p=12}} The earliest written Albanian records come from the Gheg area in makeshift spellings based on Italian or Greek. Originally, the Tosk dialect was written in the [[Greek alphabet]] and the Gheg dialect was written in the [[Latin script]]. Both dialects had also been written in the [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]] version of the [[Arabic script]], [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]], and some local alphabets ([[Elbasan alphabet|Elbasan]], [[Vithkuqi alphabet|Vithkuqi]], Todhri, Veso Bey, Jan Vellara and others, see [[Albanian alphabet#Original Alphabets|original Albanian alphabets]]). More specifically, the writers from northern Albania and under the influence of the Catholic Church used Latin letters, those in southern Albania and under the influence of the Greek Orthodox church used Greek letters, while others throughout Albania and under the influence of Islam used Arabic letters. There were initial attempts to create an original Albanian alphabet during the 1750–1850 period. These attempts intensified after the [[League of Prizren]] and culminated with the [[Congress of Manastir]] held by Albanian intellectuals from 14 to 22 November 1908, in Manastir (present day [[Bitola]]), which decided on which alphabet to use, and what the standardized spelling would be for standard Albanian. This is how the literary language remains. The alphabet is the Latin alphabet with the addition of the letters &lt;[[ë]]&gt;, &lt;[[ç]]&gt;, and ten [[Digraph (orthography)|digraphs]]: ''dh'', ''th'', ''xh'', ''gj'', ''nj'', ''ng'', ''ll'', ''rr'', ''zh'' and ''sh''.

According to [[Robert Elsie]]:&lt;ref name=Elsie2017/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The hundred years between 1750 and 1850 were an age of astounding orthographic diversity in Albania. In this period, the Albanian language was put to writing in at least ten different alphabets – most certainly a record for European languages. ... the diverse forms in which this old Balkan language was recorded, from the earliest documents to the beginning of the twentieth century ... consist of adaptations of the Latin, Greek, Arabic, and Cyrillic alphabets and (what is even more interesting) a number of locally invented writing systems. Most of the latter alphabets have now been forgotten and are unknown, even to the Albanians themselves.&lt;ref name=Elsie2017&gt;Elsie, Robert. (2017). ''Albanian Alphabets: Borrowed and Invented''.

== Classification ==

[[File:IndoEuropeanTree.svg|upright=0.9|thumb|right|Tree of [[Indo-European languages]].]]

The Albanian language occupies an independent branch of the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European language]] tree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Indo-European language and culture: an introduction |last= Fortson |first= Benjamin W |authorlink= |year=2004 |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |location= |isbn=1-4051-0315-9|page=390 |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5hOtPBF6XWwC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq='Indo-European+Language+and+Culture:++An+Introduction'&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=28 May 2010}} ''Albanian forms its own separate branch of Indo-European; it is the last branch to appear in written records''&lt;/ref&gt; In 1854, Albanian was demonstrated to be an [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European language]] by the [[Comparative linguistics|philologist]] [[Franz Bopp]]. Albanian was formerly compared by a few Indo-European linguists with [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] and [[Balto-Slavic languages|Balto-Slavic]], all of which share a number of [[isogloss]]es with Albanian.&lt;ref&gt;Watkins, Calvert. "Proto-Indo-European: Comparison and Reconstruction", in The Indo-European Languages, Anna Giacalone Ramat and Paolo Ramat, eds. London: Routledge, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Other linguists linked the Albanian language with [[Latin Language|Latin]], [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Armenian language|Armenian]], while placing Germanic and Balto-Slavic in another branch of Indo-European.&lt;ref name = mallory&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=yfZZX1qjpvkC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA111,M1 Google Books], [[J.

=== Old Albanian ===
According to the central hypothesis of a project undertaken by the [[Austrian Science Fund]], old Albanian had a significant influence on the development of many languages in the [[Balkans]]. This little-known language is being researched using all available texts before a comparison with other [[Balkan languages]] is carried out. The outcome of this work will include the compilation of a lexicon providing an overview of all old Albanian verbs.&lt;ref name=fwf&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fwf.ac.at/en/research-in-practice/project-presentations-archive/2008/old-albanian-living-legacy-of-a-dead-language/|title=FWF Austrian Science Fund – Press – (Old) Albanian – Living legacy of a dead language? |publisher=Fwf.ac.at |date= |accessdate=22 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{outdated inline|date=February 2015}} As project leader Dr. Schumacher explains, the research is already bearing fruit:
&lt;blockquote&gt;So far, our work has shown that Old Albanian contained numerous modal levels that allowed the speaker to express a particular stance to what was being said. Compared to the existing knowledge and literature, these modal levels are actually more extensive and more nuanced than previously thought. We have also discovered a great many verbal forms that are now obsolete or have been lost through restructuring — until now, these forms have barely even been recognized or, at best, have been classified incorrectly.&lt;ref name=fwf/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
These verbal forms are crucial to explaining the linguistic history of Albanian and its internal usage. However, they can also shed light on the reciprocal relationship between Albanian and its neighbouring languages. The researchers are following various leads which suggest that Albanian played a key role in the [[Balkan Sprachbund]]. For example, it is likely that Albanian is the source of the suffixed definite article in Romanian, Bulgarian and Macedonian, as this has been a feature of Albanian since ancient times.&lt;ref name=fwf/&gt;

== History ==
{{Indo-European topics}}

The first written mention of the Albanian language was on 14&amp;nbsp;July 1284 in [[Dubrovnik]] in modern [[Croatia]] when a crime witness named Matthew testified: "I heard a voice shouting on the mountainside in the Albanian language" ({{lang-lat|Audivi unam vocem, clamantem in monte in lingua albanesca}}).&lt;ref name="Hammond1976"&gt;{{cite book |author=Nicholas Geoffrey Lemprière Hammond |title=Migrations and invasions in Greece and adjacent areas |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O9saAAAAYAAJ |accessdate=23 January 2013 |year=1976 |publisher=Noyes Press |isbn=978-0-8155-5047-1 |page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zeitschrift für Balkanologie"&gt;{{cite book |title=Zeitschrift für Balkanologie |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iLkWAQAAMAAJ |accessdate=23 January 2013 |year=1990 |publisher=R.

=== Linguistic affinities ===
{{See also|Illyrian languages|Paleo-Sardinian language#Illyrian hypothesis}}

Albanian is considered an [[language isolate|isolate]] within the Indo-European language family; no other language has been conclusively linked to its [[language family#Subdivision|branch]]. The only other languages that are the sole surviving member of a branch of Indo-European are [[Armenian language|Armenian]] and [[Greek language|Greek]].

The Albanian language is part of the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] [[language family|language group]] and is considered to have evolved from one of the [[Paleo-Balkan languages]] of antiquity,&lt;ref&gt;Fine, JA. ''The Early medieval Balkans.'' University of Michigan Press, 1991. p.&amp;nbsp;11. [https://books.google.com/books?id=YbS9QmwDC58C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=isbn:0472081497&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In his latest book, [[Eric Hamp]] supports the thesis that the Illyrian language belongs to the Northwestern group, that the Albanian language is descended from Illyrian, and that Albanian is related to Messapic which is an earlier Illyrian dialect (''Comparative Studies on Albanian'', 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The ancient languages of Europe |author=Roger D. Woodard |quote=The modern Albanian language, it has been conjectured, is descendent directly from ancient Illyrian&amp;nbsp;...}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
although it is still uncertain which particular Paleo-Balkan language represents the ancestor of Albanian, or where in Southern Europe that population lived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Curtis|first1=Matthew Cowan |title=Slavic-Albanian Language Contact, Convergence, and Coexistence |url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED546136 |publisher=ProQuest LLC |accessdate=31 March 2017 |page=16 |language=en |quote=It is generally accepted that Albanians continue one of the ancient languages of the Balkans, although scholars disagree on which language they spoke and what area of the Balkans they occupied before the Slavs’ migration to the Balkans.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general there is insufficient evidence to connect Albanian with one of those languages, whether one of the [[Illyrian languages]] (which historians mostly confirm), or [[Thracian language|Thracian]] and [[Dacian language|Dacian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Curtis|first1=Matthew Cowan |title=Slavic-Albanian Language Contact, Convergence, and Coexistence |url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED546136|publisher=ProQuest LLC |accessdate=31 March 2017 |page=18 |language=en |quote=So while linguists may debate about the ties between Albanian and older languages of the Balkans, and while most Albanians may take the genealogical connection to Illyrian as incontrovertible, the fact remains that there is simply insufficient evidence to connect Illyrian, Thracian, or Dacian with any language, including Albanian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among these possibilities, Illyrian is typically held to be the most probable, though insufficient evidence still clouds the discussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article |author=Ranko Matasovic |title=A grammatical sketch of Albanian for students of Indo-European |year=2012 |publisher= |work= |page= |quote="The most probable predecessor of Albanian was Illyrian, since much of the present-day Albania was inhabited by the Illyrians during the Antiquity, but the comparison of the two languages is impossible because almost nothing is known about Illyrian ... It is a-priori less probable to assume that a single language was spoken in the whole Illyricum, from the river Arsia in Istria, to Epirus in Greece, when such a linguistic uniformity is found nowhere else in Europe before the Roman conquest. Moreover, the examination of personal names and toponyms from Illyricum shows that several onomastic areas can be distinguished, and these onomastic areas just might correspond to different languages spoken in ancient Illyricum. If Illyrians actually spoke several different languages, the question arises – From which ‘''Illyrian''’ language did Albanian develop? – and that question cannot be answered until new data are discovered."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Albanian shares lexical [[isogloss]]es with [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Germanic languages|Germanic]], and to a lesser extent [[Balto-Slavic languages|Balto-Slavic]], the vocabulary of Albanian is quite distinct. In 1995, Taylor, [[Donald Ringe|Ringe]] and [[Tandy Warnow|Warnow]], using [[quantitative comparative linguistics|quantitative linguistic]] techniques, found that Albanian appears to comprise a "subgroup with Germanic". However, they argued that this fact is hardly significant, as Albanian has lost much of its original vocabulary and morphology, and so this "apparently close connection to Germanic rests on only a couple of lexical cognates &amp;ndash; hardly any evidence at all".&lt;ref name="TRW"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Ann Taylor |author2=Donald Ringe |author3=Tandy Warnow |year=2000 |url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=RtsLKLhCZ0EC&amp;pg=PA392&amp;dq=Character+Based+Reconstruction+of+a+Linguistic+Cladogram+Albanian&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=Albanian%20cognates&amp;f=false |chapter=Character based reconstruction of a linguistic cladogram |editor1=John Charles Smith |editor2=Delia Bentley |series=Historical Linguistics 1995.

=== Early linguistic influences ===
The earliest [[loanword]]s attested in Albanian come from [[Doric Greek]],&lt;ref name="huld"&gt;{{cite journal
|author=Huld, Martin E. |title=Accentual Stratification of Ancient Greek Loanwords in Albanian |journal=Zeitschrift für vergleichende Sprachforschung |volume=99 |issue=2 |year=1986 |pages=245–253}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas the strongest influence came from [[Latin]]. According to Matthew C. Curtis, the loanwords do not necessarily indicate the geographical location of the ancestor of Albanian language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Curtis |first=Matthew Cowan |title=Slavic-Albanian language contact, convergence, and coexistence |url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED546136 |publisher=ProQuest LLC |page=16 |language=en |quote=The number of loanwords is not necessarily a compelling argument for geographical placement, as loanwords may be replaced in subsequent developments of the language (especially considering the copious borrowing that Albanian later did from Latin and Slavic before any lexicon of Albanian was ever compiled) ... [[regarding the]] homeland of the Albanians.}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to other linguists, the borrowed words can help to get an idea about the place of origin and the evolution of the Albanian language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Douglas Q. Adams |title=Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture |url=https://books.google.it/books?id=tzU3RIV2BWIC&amp;pg=PA11 |date=January 1997 |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |isbn=978-1-884964-98-5 |page=11 |quote=The loan words from Greek and Latin date back to before the Christian era and suggest that the ancestors of the Albanians must have occupied Albania by then to have absorbed such loans from their historical neighbors. As the Illyrians occupied the Albanian territory at this time, they are the most likely recipients of such loans.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Vladimir Orel |title=A concise historical grammar of the Albanian language: reconstruction of Proto-Albanian |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xvKH56aT5mEC&amp;pg |date=2000 |publisher=BRILL |isbn=978-90-04-11647-4 |page=23 |quote=Latin loanwords are of extreme importance for the history of Albanian phonology, especially its vocalism. The duration of the borrowing was so long that loanwords reflect several distinct chronological stages.}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to another group of linguists, Albanian originates from an area located east of its present geographic spread due to the several common lexical items found between the Albanian and Romanian languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Curtis |first1=Matthew Cowan |title=Slavic-Albanian language contact, convergence, and coexistence |url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED546136 |publisher=ProQuest LLC |page=17 |language=en |quote=One other point that some scholars make is the fact that Albanian and Romanian share many lexical items; this has led some to believe that Albanian originated east of its present geographical spread (Georgiev 1957; Hamp 1994).}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The period during which Proto-Albanian and Latin interacted was protracted, lasting from the 2nd&amp;nbsp;century&amp;nbsp;BC to the 5th&amp;nbsp;century&amp;nbsp;AD.{{sfn|Mallory|Adams|1997|p=9}} Over this period, the lexical borrowings can be roughly divided into three layers, the second of which is the largest. The first and smallest occurred at the time of less significant interaction. The final period, probably preceding the Slavic or Germanic invasions, also has a notably smaller number of borrowings. Each layer is characterized by a different treatment of most vowels: the first layer follows the evolution of Early Proto-Albanian into Albanian; while later layers reflect vowel changes endemic to Late Latin (and presumably [[Proto-Romance language|Proto-Romance]]). Other formative changes include the syncretism of several noun case endings, especially in the plural, as well as a large-scale palatalization.

A brief period followed, between the 7th and the 9th&amp;nbsp;centuries, that was marked by heavy borrowings from [[South Slavic languages|Southern Slavic]], some of which predate the "o-a" shift common to the modern forms of this language group. Starting in the latter 9th century, there was a period characterized by protracted contact with the Proto-Romanians, or Vlachs, though lexical borrowing seems to have been mostly one sided: from Albanian into Romanian. Such borrowing indicates that the Romanians migrated from an area where the majority was Slavic (i.e. Middle Bulgarian) to an area with a majority of Albanian speakers (i.e. [[Dardania (Europe)|Dardania]], where Vlachs are recorded in the 10th&amp;nbsp;century).{{citation needed |date=May 2017}} Their movement is presumably related to the expansion of the [[Bulgarian Empire]] into Albania around that time.

=== Latin influence ===
[[Jernej Kopitar]] (1780–1844) was the first to note Latin's influence on Albanian and claimed "the Latin loanwords in the Albanian language had the pronunciation of the time of Emperor Augustus".{{sfn|Kopitar|1829|p=254}} Kopitar gave examples such as Albanian ''qiqer'' ‘chickpea’ from Latin ''cicer'', ''qytet'' ‘city, town’ from ''civitas'', ''peshk'' ‘fish’ from ''piscis'', and ''shigjetë'' ‘arrow’ from ''sagitta''. The hard pronunciations of Latin {{angle bracket|c}} and {{angle bracket|g}} are retained as palatal and velar stops in the Albanian loanwords. Gustav Meyer (1888){{sfn|Meyer|1888|p=805}} and [[Wilhelm Meyer-Lübke]] (1914){{sfn|Meyer-Lübke|1914|p=32}} later corroborated this. Meyer noted the similarity between the Albanian verbs ''shqipoj'' ‘to speak clearly, enunciate’ and ''shqiptoj'' ‘to pronounce, articulate’ and the Latin word ''excipio'' (meaning ''to welcome''). Therefore, he believed that the word ''Shqiptar'' ‘Albanian person’ was derived from ''shqipoj'', which in turn was derived from the Latin word ''excipere''. [[Johann Georg von Hahn]], an Austrian linguist, had proposed the same hypothesis in 1854.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Wir sind die Deinen. Studien zur albanischen Sprache, Literatur und Kulturgeschichte, dem Gedenken an Martin Camaj (1925–1992) gewidmet |author =Bardhyl Demiraj |publisher=Harrassowitz Verlag |isbn=978-3-447-06221-3 |date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Eqrem Çabej]] also noticed, among other things, the archaic Latin elements in Albanian:{{sfn|Çabej|1962|pp=13–51}}

# Latin /au/ becomes Albanian /a/ in the earliest loanwords: ''aurum'' → ''ar'' ‘gold’; ''gaudium'' → ''gaz'' ‘joy’; ''laurus'' → ''lar'' ‘laurel’. Latin /au/ is retained in later loans, but is altered in a way similar to [[Greek orthography|Greek]]: ''causa'' ‘thing’ → ''kafshë'' ‘thing; beast, brute’; ''laud'' → ''lavd''.
# Latin /ō/ becomes Albanian /e/ in the oldest Latin loans: ''pōmus'' → ''pemë'' ‘fruit tree’; ''hōra'' → ''ora'' ‘hour’. An analogous mutation occurred from Proto-Indo-European to Albanian; PIE ''*nōs'' became Albanian ''ne'' ‘we’, PIE ''*oḱtō'' + suffix ''-ti-'' became Albanian ''tetë'' ‘eight’, etc.
# Latin unstressed internal and initial syllables become lost in Albanian: ''cubitus'' → ''kub'' ‘elbow’; ''medicus'' → ''mjek'' ‘physician’; ''palūdem'' ‘swamp’ → VL ''padūle'' → ''pyll'' ‘forest’. An analogous mutation occurred from Proto-Indo-European to Albanian. In contrast, in later Latin loanwords, the internal syllable is retained: ''paganus'' → ''pagan''; ''plaga'' → ''plagë'' ‘wound’, etc.
# Latin /tj/, /dj/, /kj/ palatalized to Albanian /s/, /z/, /c/: ''vitium'' → ''ves'' ‘vice; worries’; ''rationem'' → ''arsye'' ‘reason’; ''radius'' → ''rreze'' ‘ray; spoke’; ''facies'' → ''faqe'' ‘face, cheek’; ''socius'' → ''shok'' ‘mate, comrade’, ''shoq'' ‘husband’, etc. In turn, Latin /s/ was altered to /ʃ/ in Albanian.

Haralambie Mihăescu demonstrated that:

* Some 85 Latin words have survived in Albanian but not (as inherited) in any [[Romance language]]. A few examples include Late Latin  ''celsydri'' → dial. ''kulshedër'' → ''kuçedër'' ‘hydra’, ''hībernus'' → ''vërri'' ‘winter pasture’, ''sarcinārius'' ‘used for packing, loading’ → ''shelqëror'' ‘forked peg, grapnel, forked hanger’, ''solanum'' ‘nightshade’, lit. ‘sun plant’ → ''shullë(r)'' ‘sunny place out of the wind, sunbathed area’, ''splēnēticus'' → ''shpretkë'' ‘spleen’, ''trifurcus'' → ''tërfurk'' ‘pitchfork’.{{sfn|Mihaescu|1966|pp=1, 30}}
* 151 Albanian words of Latin origin were not inherited in Romanian. A few examples include Latin ''amicus'' → Albanian ''mik'' ‘friend’, ''inimicus'' → ''armik'' ‘foe, enemy’, ''rationem'' → ''arsye'', ''benedicere'' → ''bekoj'', ''bubulcus'' ‘ploughman, herdsman’ → ''bulk'', ''bujk'' ‘peasant’, ''calicis'' → ''qelq'' ‘drinking glass’, ''castellum'' → ''kështjellë'' ‘castle’, ''centum'' → ''qind'' ‘hundred’, ''gallus'' → ''gjel'' ‘rooster’, ''iunctūra'' → ''gjymtyrë'' ‘limb; joint’, ''medicus'' → ''mjek'' ‘doctor’, ''retem'' → ''rrjetë'' ‘net’, ''spērāre'' → dial. ''shp(ë)rej'' ''shpresoj'' ‘to hope’ ''pres'' ‘await’, ''voluntās'' (''voluntatis'') → ''vullnet'' ‘will; volunteer’.{{sfn|Mihaescu|1966|pp=1, 21}}
* Some Albanian church terminology have phonetic features which demonstrate their very early borrowing from Latin. A few examples include Albanian ''bekoj'' ‘to bless’ from ''benedicere'', ''engjëll'' ‘angel’ from ''angelus'', ''kishë'' ‘church’ from ''ecclesia'', ''i krishterë'' ‘Christian’ from ''christianus'', ''kryq'' ‘cross’ from ''crux'' (''crucis''), (obsolete) ''lter'' ‘altar’ from Latin ''altārium'', ''mallkoj'' ‘to curse’ from ''maledicere'', ''meshë'' ‘mass’ from ''missa'', ''murg'' ‘monk’ from ''monacus'', ''peshkëp'' ‘bishop’ from ''episcopus'', and ''ungjill'' ‘gospel’ from ''evangelium''.{{sfn|Mihaescu|1966|pp=1–2}}

Other authors{{sfn|Rosetti|1986|pp=195–197}} have detected Latin loanwords in Albanian with an ancient sound pattern from the 1st&amp;nbsp;century&amp;nbsp;BC,{{clarify|reason=What in particular suggests the phonological system of 1st-century-BC Latin?|date=January 2017}}&lt;!-- presumably the fact that */ɪ/ remains i-colored and has not merged with */eː/, and that */k/ remains unpalatalised before it, as opposed to every Romance language except Sardinian --&gt; for example, Albanian ''qingël(ë)'' ‘saddle girth; dwarf elder’ from Latin ''cingula'' and Albanian ''e vjetër'' ‘old, aged; former’ from "vjet" but influenced by Latin ''veteris''. The [[Romance languages]] inherited these words from Vulgar Latin: ''cingula'' became Romanian ''chinga'' ‘girdle; saddle girth’, and Vulgar Latin ''veterānus''  became Romanian ''bătrân'' ‘old’.

Albanian, [[Basque language|Basque]], and the surviving [[Celtic languages]] such as [[Breton language|Breton]] and [[Welsh language|Welsh]] are the non-Romance languages today that have this sort of extensive Latin element dating from ancient Roman times, which has undergone the sound changes associated with the languages. Other languages in or near the former Roman area either came on the scene later (Turkish, the Slavic languages, Arabic) or borrowed little from Latin despite coexisting with it (Greek, German), although German does have a few such ancient Latin loanwords (''Fenster'' ‘window’, ''Käse'' ‘cheese’, ''Köln'').

Romanian scholars such as Vatasescu and Mihaescu, using lexical analysis of the Albanian language, have concluded that Albanian was heavily influenced by an extinct Romance language that was distinct from both Romanian and [[Dalmatian language|Dalmatian]]. Because the Latin words common to only Romanian and Albanian are significantly less than those that are common to only Albanian and Western Romance, Mihaescu argues that the Albanian language evolved in a region with much greater contact to Western Romance regions than to Romanian-speaking regions, and located this region in present-day Albania, Kosovo and Western Macedonia, spanning east to [[Bitola]] and [[Pristina]].&lt;ref name="MadgearuAlbanianRomans"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Madgearu, Alexandru |author2=Gordon, Martin |title=The Wars of the Balkan Peninsula: Their Medieval Origins |pages=146–147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Historical presence and location ===
{{Main|Origin of the Albanians}}

[[File:Albani150ADRomanEmpire.png|upright=0.9|thumb|left|The location of the Albanoi tribe 150 AD]] [[File:Getae 200bc.jpg|thumb|text-top|upright=0.95|Illyrians, Dacians, Getae and Thracians at 200 BC]]

The place and the time where the Albanian language was formed is uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Mythifying the Albanians: A Historiographical Discussion on Vasa Efendi’s "Albania and the Albanians" |url=https://balkanologie.revues.org/2272 |website=balkanologie.revues.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; American linguist [[Eric P. Hamp|Eric Hamp]] stated that during an unknown chronological period a pre-Albanian population (termed as "Albanoid" by Hamp) inhabited areas stretching from [[Poland]] to the southwestern Balkans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Curtis |first1=Matthew Cowan |title=Slavic-Albanian Language Contact, Convergence, and Coexistence |url=https://eric.ed.gov/?id=ED546136 |publisher=ProQuest LLC |page=17 |language=en |quote=...&amp;nbsp;for example, argues that from some indeterminate time a pre-Albanian (in Hamp’s terms, Albanoid) population inhabited areas stretching from Poland to the current area}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further analysis has suggested that it was in a mountainous region rather than on a plain or seacoast:{{sfn|Hamp|1963|}} while the words for plants and animals characteristic of mountainous regions are entirely original, the names for fish and for agricultural activities (such as [[plough]]ing) are borrowed from other languages.{{sfn|Fine|1991|p=10}}

A deeper analysis of the vocabulary, however, shows that this could be a consequence of a prolonged [[Latin Language|Latin]] domination of the coastal and plain areas of the country, rather than evidence of the original environment where the Albanian language was formed. For example, the word for 'fish' is borrowed from Latin, but not the word for 'gills', which is native. Indigenous are also the words for 'ship', 'raft', 'navigation', 'sea shelves' and a few names of fish kinds, but not the words for 'sail', 'row' and 'harbor' – objects pertaining to navigation itself and a large part of sea fauna. This rather shows that Proto-Albanians were pushed away from coastal areas in early times (probably after the Latin conquest of the region) thus losing large parts (or the majority) of sea environment lexicon. A similar phenomenon could be observed with agricultural terms. While the words for 'arable land', 'corn', 'wheat', 'cereals', 'vineyard', 'yoke', 'harvesting', 'cattle breeding', etc. are native, the words for 'ploughing', 'farm' and 'farmer', agricultural practices, and some harvesting tools are foreign. This, again, points to intense contact with other languages and people, rather than providing evidence of a possible ''Urheimat''.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

[[File:AlbaniaPeriodical.jpg|upright=0.95|thumb|October 1899 issue of the magazine ''Albania'', the most important Albanian periodical of the early 20th century]]

The centre of Albanian settlement remained the [[Mat (river)|Mat]] river. In 1079, they were recorded farther south in the valley of the [[Shkumbin]] river.{{sfn|Kazhdan |1991 |pp=52–53}} The Shkumbin, a seasonal stream that lies near the old [[Via Egnatia]], is approximately the boundary of the primary dialect division for Albanian, [[Tosk Albanian|Tosk]] and [[Gheg Albanian|Gheg]]. The characteristics of Tosk and Gheg in the treatment of the native and loanwords from other languages are evidence that the dialectal split preceded the [[Slavic migration to the Balkans]],{{sfn|Brown|Ogilvie|2008|p=23}}{{sfn |Fortson |2004 |p=392}}{{sfn|Mallory|Adams|1997|p=9}} which means that in that period (the 5th to 6th&amp;nbsp;centuries AD), Albanians were occupying nearly the same area around the Shkumbin river, which straddled the [[Jireček Line]].{{sfn|Demiraj|1999|}}{{sfn|Hamp|1963|}}

References to the existence of Albanian as a distinct language survive from the 14th&amp;nbsp;century, but they failed to cite specific words. The oldest surviving documents written in Albanian are the "[[formula e pagëzimit]]" (Baptismal formula), ''Un'te paghesont' pr'emenit t'Atit e t'Birit e t'Spertit Senit''. ("I baptize thee in [[Trinitarian formula|the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit]]") recorded by Pal Engjelli, Bishop of Durrës in 1462 in the Gheg dialect, and some [[New Testament]] verses from that period.

The oldest known Albanian printed book, ''[[Meshari]]'', or "missal", was written in 1555 by [[Gjon Buzuku]], a [[Roman Catholic]] cleric. In 1635 [[Frang Bardhi]] wrote the first Latin–Albanian dictionary. The first Albanian school is believed to have been opened by [[Franciscan]]s in 1638 in [[Pdhanë]].

One of the earliest dictionaries of Albanian language was written in 1693 which was an [[Italian language]] manuscript authored by Montenegrin sea captain [[Julije Balović]] ''Pratichae Schrivaneschae'' and includes a multilingual dictionary of hundreds of the most often used words in everyday life in the Italian, Slavo-Illirico, Greek, Albanian and [[Turkish language|Turkish]] languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pantić |first=Miroslav |title=Književnost na tlu Crne Gore i Boke Kotorske od XVI do XVIII veka |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G5FiAAAAMAAJ |year=1990 |publisher=Srpska književna zadruga |page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Proto-IE features ===
Although Albanian has been referred to as the "weird sister" for several words that do not correspond to IE cognates, it has retained many proto-IE features: for example, the demonstrative pronoun *''*ḱo-'' is ancestral to Albanian ''ky/kjo'' and English ''he'' but not to English ''this'' or to Russian ''etot.''

Albanian is compared to other Indo-European languages below, but note that Albanian has exhibited some notable instances of [[semantic drift]] (such as ''motër'' meaning "sister" rather than "mother".

=== Albanian–PIE phonological correspondences ===

Phonologically, Albanian is not so conservative. Like many IE stocks, it has merged the two series of voiced stops (e.g. both *''d'' and *''dʰ'' became ''d''). In addition, voiced stops tend to disappear in between vowels. There is almost complete loss of final syllables and very widespread loss of other unstressed syllables (e.g. ''mik'', 'friend' from Lat. ''amicus''). PIE *''o'' appears as ''a'' (also as ''e'' if a high front vowel ''i'' follows), while *''ē'' and *''ā'' become ''o'', and PIE *''ō'' appears as ''e''. The palatals, velars, and labiovelars all remain distinct before front vowels, a conservation found otherwise in [[Luvian]] and related Anatolian languages. Thus PIE *''ḱ'', *''k'', and *''kʷ'' become ''th'', ''q'', and ''s'', respectively (before back vowels *''ḱ'' becomes ''th'', while *''k'' and *''kʷ'' merge as ''k'').{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} A minority of scholars reconstruct a fourth [[Laryngeal theory|laryngeal]] phoneme *''h&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;'' which survives as as Alb. ''h'' word-initially (Albanian ''herdhe'', 'testicle' but Hittite ''arki-'' 'testicle', from PIE *h₄órǵʰiyeh₂). &lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book |title=Encyclopedia of Indo-European culture |author1=J.

== Standard Albanian ==
Since [[World War II]], standard Albanian used in Albania has been based on the Tosk dialect. Kosovo and other areas where Albanian is official adopted the Tosk standard in 1969.&lt;ref name="Agim"&gt;Agim Morina, "Udhërrëfyes i shkurtë i historisë së standardizimit të shqipes," [http://dodonapress.blogspot.co.uk/2015/02/udherrefyes-i-shkurte-i-historise-se.html ''DodonaPress'' (2015-02-21)], also in [http://plisi.org/gjuhsi/histori-standardizimit-shqipes/ ''Plisi.org'' (2015-02-24)].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Elbasan-based standard ===
Until the early 20th century, Albanian writing developed in three main literary traditions: [[Gheg]], [[Tosk]], and [[Arbëreshë people|Arbëreshë]]. Throughout this time, an intermediate subdialect spoken around [[Elbasan]] served as ''lingua franca'' among the Albanians, but was less prevalent in writing. The [[Congress of Manastir]] of Albanian writers held in 1908 recommended the use of the Elbasan subdialect for literary purposes and as a basis of a unified national language. While technically classified as a southern Gheg variety, the Elbasan speech is closer to Tosk in phonology and practically a hybrid between other Gheg subdialects and literary Tosk.&lt;ref name=Agim /&gt;

Between 1916 and 1918, the [[Albanian Literary Commission]] met in Shkodër under the leadership of [[Luigj Gurakuqi]] with the purpose of establishing a unified orthography for the language. The Commission, made up of representatives from the north and south of Albania, reaffirmed the Elbasan subdialect as the basis of a national tongue. The rules published in 1917 defined spelling for the Elbasan variety for official purposes. The Commission did not, however, discourage publications in one of the dialects, but rather laid a foundation for Gheg and Tosk to gradually converge into one.&lt;ref name="Agim"/&gt;

When the Congress of Lushnje met in the aftermath of World War I to form a new Albanian government, the 1917 decisions of the Literary Commission were upheld. The Elbasan subdialect remained in use for administrative purposes and many new writers embraced for creative writing. Gheg and Tosk continued to develop freely and interaction between the two dialects increased.

=== Tosk standard ===
{{further|Albanian Orthography Congress}}At the end of World War II, however, the new communist regime radically imposed the use of the Tosk dialect in all facets of life in Albania: administration, education, and literature. Most Communist leaders were Tosks from the south.&lt;ref name="Agim" /&gt; Standardization was directed by the [[Albanian Institute of Linguistics and Literature]] of the [[Academy of Sciences of Albania]].{{sfn|Lloshi|2008|p=10}} Two dictionaries were published in 1954: an Albanian language dictionary and a Russian–Albanian dictionary. New orthography rules were eventually published in 1967{{sfn|Lloshi|2008|p=10}} and 1973 ''Drejtshkrimi i gjuhës shqipe'' (Orthography of the Albanian Language).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Drejtshkrimi i gjuhës shqipe |last=Kostallari |first=Androkli |authorlink= |year=1973 |publisher="Instituti i Gjuhësisë dhe i Letërsisë" ( in "Akademia e Shkencave e RPS të Shqipërisë", today "Akademia e Shkencave e Republikës së Shqipërisë"), |location= |isbn= |page= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M4LLPwAACAAJ&amp;dq=Drejtshkrimi+i+gjuh%C3%ABs+shqipe|ref="Drejtshkrimi i gjuhës shqipe" }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until 1968, Kosovo and other Albanian-speaking areas in the former Yugoslavia followed the 1917 standard based on the Elbasan dialect. Albanian intellectuals in the former Yugoslavia consolidated the 1917 twice in the 1950s, culminating with a thorough codification of orthographic rules in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://wikisource.org/wiki/Drejtshkrimi_Prishtin%C3%AB_1964|title=Drejtshkrimi Prishtinë 1964 - Wikisource|website=wikisource.org|language=en|access-date=2018-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rules already provided for a balanced variety that accounted for both Gheg and Tosk dialects, but only lasted through 1968. Viewing divergences with Albania as a threat to their identity, Kosovars arbitrarily adopted the Tosk project that Tirana had published the year before. Although it was never intended to serve outside of Albania, the project became the "unified literary language" in 1972, when approved by a rubberstamp Orthography Congress.&lt;ref name="Agim" /&gt; Only about 1 in 9 participants were from Kosovo. The Congress, held at Tirana, authorized the orthography rules that came out the following year, in 1973.

More recent dictionaries from the Albanian government are ''Fjalori Drejtshkrimor i Gjuhës Shqipe'' (1976) (Orthographic Dictionary of the Albanian Language)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Fjalori drejtshkrimor i gjuhës shqipe |last=Kostallari |first=Androkli |authorlink= |year=1976 |publisher="Instituti i Gjuhësisë dhe i Letërsisë" (in "Akademia e Shkencave e RPS të Shqipërisë", today "Akademia e Shkencave e Republikës së Shqipërisë"), |location= |isbn= |page= |pages= | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3MilQQAACAAJ&amp;dq=Fjalori+drejtshkrimor+i+gjuh%C3%ABs+shqipe&amp;cd=2|ref="Fjalori Drejtshkrimor i Gjuhës Shqipe"}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Dictionary of Today's Albanian language'' (''Fjalori Gjuhës së Sotme Shqipe'') (1980).{{sfn|Lloshi|2008|p=10}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Fjalori i Gjuhës së Sotme Shqipe |authors="Akademia e Shkencave e RPS të Shqipërisë", today "Akademia e Shkencave e Republikës së Shqipërisë", "Instituti i Gjuhësisë dhe i Letërsisë" (Albania). |year=1980 |publisher=[[Academy of Sciences of Albania]] |location=Tirana |isbn= |page= |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IrsAGwAACAAJ&amp;dq=Fjalor+i+gjuhes+se+sotme+shqipe&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=q540TIjLDYa8lQen8MjSBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA |accessdate=7 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to World War II, dictionaries consulted by developers of the standard have included ''Lexikon tis Alvanikis glossis'' (Albanian: ''Fjalori i Gjuhës Shqipe'' ([[Kostandin Kristoforidhi]], 1904),{{sfn|Lloshi|2008|p=9}} ''Fjalori i Bashkimit'' (1908),{{sfn|Lloshi|2008|p=9}} and ''Fjalori i Gazullit'' (1941).{{sfn|Lloshi|2008|p=12}}

=== Calls for reform ===
Since the fall of the communist regime, Albanian orthography has stirred heated debate among scholars, writers, and public opinion in Albania and Kosovo, with hardliners opposed to any changes in the orthography, moderates supporting varying degrees of reform, and radicals calling for a return to the Elbasan dialect. Criticism of Standard Albanian has centred on the exclusion of the 'me+' infinitive and the Gheg lexicon. Critics say that Standard Albanian disenfranchises and stigmatizes Gheg speakers, affecting the quality of writing and impairing effective public communication. Supporters of the Tosk standard view the [[Albanian Orthography Congress|1972 Congress]] as a milestone achievement in Albanian history and dismiss calls for reform as efforts to "divide the nation" or "create two languages." Moderates, who are especially prevalent in Kosovo, generally stress the need for a unified Albanian language, but believe that the 'me+' infinitive and Gheg words should be included. Proponents of the Elbasan dialect have been vocal, but have gathered little support in the public opinion. In general, those involved in the language debate come from diverse backgrounds and there is no significant correlation between one's political views, geographic origin, and position on Standard Albanian.

Many writers continue to write in the Elbasan dialect but other Gheg variants have found much more limited use in literature. Most publications adhere to a strict policy of not accepting submissions that are not written in Tosk. Some print media even translate direct speech, replacing the 'me+' infinitive with other verb forms and making other changes in grammar and word choice. Even authors who have published in the Elbasan dialect will frequently write in the Tosk standard.

In 2013, a group of academics for Albania and Kosovo proposed minor changes to the orthography.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://plisi.org/gjuhsi/sugjerime-verejtje-ndryshimeve-drejtshkrim/|title=Sugjerime e vërejtje rreth ndryshimeve në drejtshkrim|last=Morina|first=Agim|date=2016-03-16|website=Plisi.org|access-date=2018-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hardline academics boycotted the initiative,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sot.com.al/kultura-intervista/emil-lafe-k%c3%abshilli-nd%c3%abrakademik-p%c3%abr-gjuh%c3%abn-shqipe-ec%c3%abn-pa-busull-ende-pa-nj%c3%ab|title=Emil Lafe: Këshilli Ndërakademik për Gjuhën Shqipe ecën pa busull, ende pa një platformë shkencore të miratuar njëzëri|last=Vrapi|first=Julia|date=2013-04-27|website=Sot.com.al|access-date=2018-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; while other reformers have viewed it as well-intentioned but flawed and superficial.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Media such as Rrokum and ''Java'' have offered content that is almost exclusively in the Elbasan dialect. Meanwhile, author and linguist [[Agim Morina]] has promoted ''Shqipe e Përbashkët'' or Common Albanian, a reformed version of the Tosk standard that aims at reflecting the natural development of the language among all Albanians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://plisi.org/gjuhsi/libri-mary-motesit-kosoven-shqip-paskajore/|title=Libri i Mary Motesit për Kosovën: Shqip me paskajore|last=Morina|first=Agim|date=2017-10-10|website=Plisi.org|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Agim" /&gt; Common Albanian incorporates the 'me+' infinitive, accommodates for Gheg features, provides for dialect-neutral rules that favor simplicity, predictability, and usage trends.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://plisi.org/gjuhsi/ekonomizimi-pjesores-mundesi-shqipen-perbashket/|title=Ekonomizimi i pjesores – mundësi për shqipen e përbashkët|last=Bërlajolli|first=Gazmend|date=2014-08-13|website=Plisi.org|access-date=2018-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://plisi.org/gjuhsi/standardi-gegnishtja/|title=Standardi dhe gegnishtja|last=Bërlajolli|first=Gazmend|date=2016-07-17|website=Plisi.org|access-date=2018-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many modern writers have embraced Common Albanian to various extents, especially in less formal writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://plisi.org/gjuhsi/ndryshon-shqipja-standarde/|title=Po ndryshon shqipja standarde|last=Mjeku|first=Getoar|date=2016-04-24|website=Plisi.org|access-date=2018-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Education ===

Albanian is the medium of instruction in most Albanian schools. The literacy rate in Albania for the total population, age 9 or older, is about 99%. Elementary education is compulsory (grades 1–9), but most students continue at least until a secondary education. Students must pass graduation exams at the end of the 9th grade and at the end of the 12th grade in order to continue their education.

== Phonology ==
Standard Albanian has 7 [[vowel]]s and 29 [[consonant]]s. Like English, Albanian has dental fricatives {{IPA|/θ/}} (like the ''th'' in ''thin'') and {{IPA|/ð/}} (like the ''th'' in ''this''), written as ''th'' and ''dh,'' which are rare cross-linguistically.

[[Gheg Albanian|Gheg]] uses [[long vowel|long]] and [[nasal vowel]]s, which are absent in [[Tosk Albanian|Tosk]], and the mid-central vowel ''ë'' is lost at the end of the word. The stress is fixed mainly on the last syllable. Gheg ''n'' (''femën'': compare English ''feminine'') changes to ''r'' by [[Rhotacism (sound change)|rhotacism]] in Tosk (''femër'').

'''Notes:'''

* The contrast between flapped ''r'' and trilled ''rr'' is the same as in Spanish or [[Armenian language|Armenian]].  In most of the dialects, as also in standard Albanian, the single "r" changes from an alveolar flap {{IPA|/ɾ/}} into a retroflex flap {{IPA|[ɽ]}}, or even an alveolar approximant {{IPA|[ɹ]}} when it is at the end of a word.
* The palatal nasal {{IPA|/ɲ/}} corresponds to the Spanish ''ñ'' and the French and Italian ''gn''. It is pronounced as one sound, not a nasal plus a glide.
* The ''ll'' sound is a velarised lateral, close to English ''[[dark L]]''.
* The letter ''ç'' is sometimes written ''ch'' due to technical limitations because of its use in English sound and its analogy to the other [[digraph (orthography)|digraph]]s ''xh'', ''sh'', and ''zh''. Usually it is written simply ''c'' or more rarely ''q'' with context resolving any ambiguities.
* The position of ''q'' and ''gj'' sound is not clear. Many speakers merge them into the palatoalveolar sounds ''ç'' and ''xh''. This is especially common in Northern Gheg, but is increasingly the case in Tosk as well.&lt;ref&gt;Kolgjini, Julie M. (2004). ''Palatalization in albanian : an acoustic investigation of stops and affricates.'' Ph.D. Dissertation, University of Texas at Arlington. {{ISBN|0496859366}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Other speakers reduced them into {{IPA|/j/}} in consonant clusters, such as in the word ''fjollë,'' which before standardization was written as ''fqollë'' ( &lt; Medieval Greek φακιολης). 
* The ''ng'' can pronounced as {{IPA|/ŋ/}} in final position, otherwise is an allophone of ''n'' before ''k'' and ''g''.
* Before ''q'' and ''gj,'' the ''n'' is always pronounced {{IPA|/ɲ/}} but this is not reflected in the orthography.
* {{IPA|/θ, ð, ɫ/}} are interdental.

==== Schwa ====
Although the Indo-European [[schwa]] (''ə'' or -''h&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''-) was preserved in Albanian, in some cases it was lost, possibly when a [[stressed syllable]] preceded it.&lt;ref&gt;Orel, Vladimir (2000). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=xvKH56aT5mEC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=schwa+proto-Albanian#v=onepage&amp;q=schwa%20proto-Albanian&amp;f=false A concise historical grammar of the Albanian language: reconstruction of Proto-Albanian]''. BRILL. p. 3. {{ISBN|978-90-04-11647-4}}. Retrieved 15 December 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Until the standardization of the modern [[Albanian alphabet]], in which the schwa is spelled as ''ë'', as in the work of [[Gjon Buzuku]] in the 16th century, various vowels and [[gliding vowel]]s were employed, including ''ae'' by [[Lekë Matrënga]] and ''é'' by [[Pjetër Bogdani]] in the late 16th and early 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/bitstream/1887/14920/2/de+Vaan+-+PIE+e+in+Albanian.pdf|title=PIE *e in Albanian|last=de Vaan|first=Michiel|page=72|accessdate=16 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Elsie(London2005"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Elsie|first1=Robert|last2=(London|first2=Centre for Albanian Studies|last3=England)|first3=|title=Albanian literature: a short history|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ox3Wx1Nl_2MC&amp;pg=PA16&amp;dq=schwa+albanian&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Zh0JTaHODsqe4QaWuPCeAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=schwa%20albanian&amp;f=false|accessdate=15 December 2010|year=2005|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=978-1-84511-031-4|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The schwa in Albanian has a great degree of variability from extreme back to extreme front articulation.&lt;ref name="schwa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kfs.oeaw.ac.at/publications/2001_granser_moosmueller_the_schwa_in_albanian.pdf|title=The schwa in Albanian|last=Granser|first=Thedor|last2=Moosmüller|first2=Sylvia|publisher=Institute of Acoustics of the Austrian Academy of Sciences|accessdate=15 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within the borders of Albania, the phoneme is pronounced about the same in both the Tosk and the Gheg dialect due to the influence of standard Albanian. However, in the Gheg dialects spoken in the neighbouring Albanian-speaking areas of Kosovo and Macedonia, the phoneme is still pronounced as back and rounded.&lt;ref name="schwa"/&gt;

== Grammar ==
{{see also | Albanian morphology}}
Albanian has a canonical word order of [[subject–verb–object|SVO]] (subject–verb–object) like English and many other Indo-European languages.&lt;ref&gt;Maxwell, Daniel Newhall. (1979). A Crosslinguistic Correlation between Word Order and Casemarking
institution. Bloomington: Indiana University Pub.&lt;/ref&gt; Albanian [[noun]]s are [[Albanian morphology|inflected]] by [[Grammatical gender|gender]] (masculine, feminine and neuter) and [[Grammatical number|number]] (singular and plural). There are five [[declension]]s with six cases ([[nominative]], [[accusative]], [[genitive]], [[dative case|dative]], [[ablative]], and [[vocative]]), although the vocative only occurs with a limited number of words, and the forms of the genitive and dative are identical (a genitive is produced when the prepositions ''i/e/të/së'' are used with the dative). Some dialects also retain a locative case, which is not present in standard Albanian. The cases apply to both definite and indefinite nouns, and there are numerous cases of [[syncretism (linguistics)|syncretism]].

The following shows the declension of ''mal'' (mountain), a masculine noun which takes "i" in the definite singular:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! !! '''Indefinite singular''' !! '''Indefinite plural''' !! '''Definite singular''' !! '''Definite plural'''
|-
| '''[[Nominative]]''' || një mal (a mountain) || male (mountains) || mali (the mountain) || malet (the mountains)
|-
| '''[[Accusative]]''' || një mal || male || malin || malet

| '''[[Dative]]''' || një mali || maleve || malit || maleve
|-
| '''[[Ablative]]''' || (prej) një mali || (prej) malesh || (prej) malit || (prej) maleve
|}

The following shows the declension of the masculine noun ''zog'' (bird), a masculine noun which takes "u" in the definite singular:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! !! '''Indefinite singular''' !! '''Indefinite plural''' !! '''Definite singular''' !! '''Definite plural'''
|-

|-
| '''[[Ablative]]''' || (prej) një zogu || (prej) zogjsh || (prej) zogut || (prej) zogjve
|}

The following table shows the declension of the feminine noun ''vajzë'' (girl):

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! !! '''Indefinite singular''' !! '''Indefinite plural''' !! '''Definite singular''' !! '''Definite plural'''
|-
| '''[[Nominative]]''' || një vajzë (a girl) || vajza (girls) || vajza (the girl) || vajzat (the girls)
|-
| '''[[Accusative]]''' || një vajzë || vajza || vajzën || vajzat
|-
| '''[[Genitive]]''' || i/e/të/së një vajze || i/e/të/së vajzave || i/e/të/së vajzës || i/e/të/së vajzave
|-
| '''[[Dative]]''' || një vajze || vajzave || vajzës || vajzave
|-
| '''[[Ablative]]''' || (prej) një vajze || (prej) vajzash || (prej) vajzës || (prej) vajzave
|}

The definite article is placed after the noun as in many other [[Balkan languages]], like in [[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]] and [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]].

* The definite article can be in the form of noun suffixes, which vary with gender and case.
** For example, in singular nominative, masculine nouns add ''-i'', or those ending in -g/-k/-h take ''-u'' (to avoid palatalization):
*** ''mal'' (mountain) / ''mali'' (the mountain);
*** ''libër'' (book) / ''libri'' (the book);
*** ''zog'' (bird) / ''zogu'' (the bird).
** Feminine nouns take the suffix ''-(i/j)a'':
*** ''veturë'' (car) / ''vetura'' (the car);
*** ''shtëpi'' (house) / ''shtëpia'' (the house);
*** ''lule'' (flower) / ''lulja'' (the flower).
* Neuter nouns take ''-t''.

Albanian has developed an analytical [[verb]]al structure in place of the earlier synthetic system, inherited from [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]]. Its complex system of [[Grammatical mood|mood]]s (six types) and [[Grammatical tense|tense]]s (three simple and five complex constructions) is distinctive among [[Balkan languages]]. There are two general types of [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugations]].

Albanian verbs, like those of other Balkan languages, have an "[[admirative]]" mood (''mënyra habitore'') that is used to indicate surprise on the part of the speaker or to imply that an event is known to the speaker by report and not by direct observation. In some contexts, this mood can be translated using English "apparently".

* ''Ti '''flet''' shqip.'' "You '''speak''' Albanian." (indicative)
* ''Ti '''fliske''' shqip!'' "You '''(surprisingly) speak''' Albanian!" (admirative)
* ''Rruga '''është''' e mbyllur.'' "The street '''is''' closed." (indicative)
* ''Rruga '''qenka''' e mbyllur.'' "'''(Apparently,)''' The street '''is''' closed." (admirative)

For more information on verb conjugation and on inflection of other parts of speech, see [[Albanian morphology]].

=== Word order ===
Albanian word order is relatively free.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eujournal.org/index.php/esj/article/viewFile/4690/4482 |title=Syntactic Similarities and Differences between Albanian and English |author1=Aida Kurani |author2=Anisa Trifoni |website=Eujournal.org |accessdate=2017-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; To say 'Agim ate all the oranges' in Albanian, one may use any of the following orders, with slight pragmatic differences:

* [[subject–verb–object|SVO]]: Agimi i hëngri të gjithë portokallët.
* [[subject–object–verb|SOV]]: Agimi të gjithë portokallët i hëngri.
* [[Object–verb–subject|OVS]]: Të gjithë portokallët i hëngri Agimi.
* [[Object–subject–verb|OSV]]: Të gjithë portokallët Agimi i hëngri.
* [[Verb–subject–object|VSO]]: I hëngri Agimi të gjithë portokallët.

However, the most common order is [[subject–verb–object]], and negation is expressed by the particles ''nuk'' or ''s''' in front of the verb, for example:

* ''Toni nuk flet anglisht'' "Tony does not speak English";
* ''Toni s'flet anglisht'' "Tony doesn't speak English";
* ''Nuk e di'' "I do not know";
* ''S'e di'' "I don't know".

However, the verb can optionally occur in sentence-initial position, especially with verbs in the non-active form (''forma joveprore''):

* '''''Parashikohet''' një ndërprerje'' "An interruption '''is anticipated'''".

In imperative sentences, the particle ''mos'' is used for negation:

* ''Mos harro'' "do not forget!".

=== Earliest undisputed texts ===
The earliest known texts in Albanian:
* [[File:Buzuku meshari.jpg|thumb|[[Meshari]] of [[Gjon Buzuku]] 1554–1555]]a 208-page parchment written by Theodor of Shkodra discovered in the secret archives of Vatican.&lt;ref name="Elsie2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Elsie|title=Albanian Literature: A Short History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ox3Wx1Nl_2MC&amp;pg=PA5|year=2005|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=978-1-84511-031-4|pages=5–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work is a manuscript decorated with golden miniatures and colored initials, divided in three parts. Pages 1–97 deal with theology, 98–146 with philosophy, and pages 147–208 with a history of the known world from AD 153 to 1209. On the final page of the manuscript we find a note by the author "With the assistance and great love of the blessed Lord, I finished this in the year 1210 on the 9th day of March."
* the "[[formula e pagëzimit]]" (Baptismal Formula), which dates back to 1462 and was authored by [[Pal Engjëlli]] (or Paulus Angelus) (c. 1417&amp;nbsp;– 1470), Archbishop of [[Durrës]]. Engjëlli was a close friend and counsellor of [[Skanderbeg]].{{sfn|Prifti|1982|p=3}} It was written in a pastoral letter for a synod at the Holy Trinity in Mat and read in Latin characters as follows: ''Unte paghesont premenit Atit et Birit et Spertit Senit'' (standard Albanian: "Unë të pagëzoj në emër të Atit, të Birit e të Shpirtit të Shenjtë"; English: "I baptize you in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit"). It was discovered and published in 1915 by [[Nicolae Iorga]].{{sfn|Iorga|1s971|p=102}}
* the ''[[Fjalori i Arnold von Harfit]]'' ([[Arnold Ritter von Harff's lexicon]]), a short list of Albanian phrases with German glosses, dated 1496.{{sfn|Anamali|2002|p=311}}
* a song, recorded in the Greek alphabet, retrieved from an old [[codex]] that was written in Greek. The document is also called "Perikopeja e Ungjillit të Pashkëve" or "Perikopeja e Ungjillit të Shën Mateut" ("The Song of the Easter Gospel, or "The Song of Saint Matthew's Gospel"). Although the codex is dated to during the 14th century, the song, written in Albanian by an anonymous writer, seems to be a 16th-century writing. The document was found by [[Arbëreshë people|Arbëreshë]] people who had emigrated to Italy in the 15th century.{{sfn|Lloshi|2008|p=97}}
* The first book in Albanian is the [[Meshari]] ("The Missal"), written by [[Gjon Buzuku]] between 20 March 1554 and 5 January 1555. The book was written in the [[Gheg]] dialect in the [[Latin script]] with some Slavic letters adapted for Albanian vowels. The book was discovered in 1740 by [[Gjon Nikollë Kazazi]], the Albanian [[archbishop]] of [[Skopje]]. It contains the liturgies of the main [[holiday]]s. There are also texts of prayers and rituals and [[catechism|catechetical]] texts. The grammar and the vocabulary are more archaic than those in the Gheg texts from the 17th century. The 188 pages of the book comprise about 154,000 words with a total vocabulary of c. 1,500 different words. The text is archaic yet easily interpreted because it is mainly a translation of known texts, in particular portions of the [[Bible]]. The book also contains passages from the [[Psalm]]s, the [[Book of Isaiah]], the [[Book of Jeremiah]], the [[First Epistle to the Corinthians|Letters to the Corinthians]], and many illustrations. The uniformity of spelling seems to indicate an earlier tradition of writing. The only known copy of the Meshari is held by the [[Vatican Library|Apostolic Library]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Meshari | url=http://www.bksh.al/gsdl/cgi-bin/library.exe?e=d-01000-00---off-0antikuar--00-1--0-10-0---0---0prompt-10---4-------0-1l--11-en-50---20-about---00-3-1-00-0-0-11-1-0utfZz-8-00&amp;a=d&amp;c=antikuar&amp;cl=CL2.3 | work= | publisher=[[National Library of Albania]] | author= | date= | accessdate=14 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968 the book was published with transliterations and comments by linguists.

=== Disputed earlier text ===

[[File:Oldest Surviving Albanian Text.jpg|thumb|right|Possibly the oldest surviving Albanian text, highlighted in red, from the Bellifortis manuscript, written by Konrad Kyeser around 1402–1405.]]

In 1967 two scholars claimed to have found a brief text in Albanian inserted into the [[Bellifortis]] text, a book written in Latin dating to 1402–1405.{{sfn|Todericiu|1967|}}

{{quote|"A star has fallen in a place in the woods, distinguish the star, distinguish it.&lt;br&gt;
Distinguish the star from the others, they are ours, they are.&lt;br&gt;
Do you see where the great voice has resounded? Stand beside it&lt;br&gt;
That thunder. It did not fall. It did not fall for you, the one which would do it.&lt;br&gt;
...&lt;br&gt;
Like the ears, you should not believe ... that the moon fell when ...&lt;br&gt;
Try to encompass that which spurts far ...&lt;br&gt;
Call the light when the moon falls and no longer exists ..."}}

Dr. [[Robert Elsie]], a specialist in Albanian studies, considers that "The Todericiu/Polena Romanian translation of the non-Latin lines, although it may offer some clues if the text is indeed Albanian, is fanciful and based, among other things, on a false reading of the manuscript, including the exclusion of a whole line."{{sfn|Elsie|1986|p=158–162}}

=== Ottoman period ===
In 1635, [[Frang Bardhi]] (1606–1643) published in [[Rome]] his ''Dictionarum latinum-epiroticum'', the first known Latin-Albanian dictionary. Other scholars who studied the language during the 17th century include [[Andrea Bogdani]] (1600–1685), author of the first Latin-Albanian grammar book, [[Nilo Katalanos]] (1637–1694) and others.{{sfn|Marmullaku|1975|p=17}}

== Vocabulary ==
Albanian is known within historical linguistics as a case of a language which, although surviving through many periods of foreign rule and multilingualism, saw a "disproportionately high" influx of loans augmenting and replacing much of its vocabulary.&lt;ref name=Matasovic6/&gt; Other languages influenced Albanian and high-end estimates classify the majority of Albanian [[vocabulary]] as [[loanwords]], suggesting that more than 90% of the present Albanian [[vocabulary]] is [[Latin language|Latin]], [[Greek language|Greek]],[[Slavic languages|Slavic]], [[Italian language|Italian]] and [[Turkish language|Turkish]] loanwords, with the biggest{{fv|date=November 2018}} influence being Latin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Millar |first1=Robert McColl |last2=Trask |first2=Larry |title=Trask's Historical Linguistics |date=2015 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9781317541776 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gGzABgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA292#v=onepage&amp;q=albanian&amp;f=false |page=292 |language=en |quote=Albanian seems to have lost more than 90 per cent of its original vocabulary in favour of loans from Latin, Greek, Hungarian, Slavonic, Italian and Turkish. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The chief sources of (Proto-) Albanian are (Ancient) Greek, Latin and Slavic, while Ancient Greek loanwords are scarce the Latin loanwords are of extreme importance in [[phonology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Orel |first1=Vladimir Ė |title=A Concise Historical Grammar of the Albanian Language: Reconstruction of Proto-Albanian |date=2000 |publisher=BRILL |isbn=9004116478 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xvKH56aT5mEC&amp;pg=PA23 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The presence of loanwords from more well-studied languages from time periods before Albanian was attested, reaching deep back into the Classical Era, has been of great use in phonological reconstructions for earlier ancient and medieval forms of Albanian.&lt;ref name=Matasovic6&gt;Matasovic, Ranko (2018).

Page 35.&lt;/ref&gt; Some among these putative pre-IE words are thought to be related to putative pre-IE substrate words in neighboring Indo-European languages, such as ''lule'' (flower), which has been tentatively linked to Latin ''lilia'' and Greek ''leirion''&lt;ref&gt;Orel, Vladimir (2000).

=== Loanwords ===

==== Early Greek loans ====
There are some 30 [[Ancient Greek]] loanwords in Albanian.&lt;ref name="Linguistics p.412"/&gt; Many of these reflect a dialect which voiced its aspirants, as did the Macedonian dialect. Other loanwords are Doric; these words mainly refer to commodity items and trade goods and probably came through trade with a now-extinct intermediary.&lt;ref name="huld"/&gt;
* bletë; "hive, bee" &lt; Attic ''mélitta'' "bee" (vs. Ionic ''mélissa'').&lt;ref&gt;Vladimir Orel (2000) postulates a Vulgar Latin intermediary for no good reason. Mallory &amp; Adams (1997) erroneously give the word as native, from *''melítiā'', the protoform underlying Greek ''mélissa''; however, this protoform gave Albanian ''mjalcë'' "bee", which is a natural derivative of Proto-Albanian *''melita'' "honey" (mod. ''mjaltë'').&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Gothic loans ====

Some [[Gothic language|Gothic]] loanwords were borrowed through [[Late Latin]], while others came from the Ostrogothic expansion into parts of Praevalitana around Nakšić and the Gulf of Kotor in Montenegro.

* fat; "groom, husband" &lt; Goth ''brūþ'''faþ'''s'' "bridegroom"&lt;ref&gt;The word ''fat'' has both the meaning of "fate, luck" and "groom, husband". This may indicate two separate words that are homophones, one derived from Gothic and the other from Latin ''fātum''; although, Orel (2000) sees them as the same word. Similarly, compare Albanian ''shortë'' "fate; spouse, wife" which mirrors the dichotomy in meaning of ''fat'' but is considered to stem from one single source—Latin ''sortem'' "fate".&lt;/ref&gt;
* horr; "scoundrel", horrë; "hussy, whore" &lt; Goth ''hors'' "adulterer", *''hora'' "whore"{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}
* shkulkë; "boundary marker for pastures made of branches" &lt; Late Latin ''sculca'' &lt; Goth ''skulka'' "guardian"{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}
* shkumë; "foam" &lt; Late Latin &lt; Goth ''skūma''{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}
* tirq; "trousers" &lt; Late Latin ''tubrucus'' &lt; Goth *''þiobrok'' "knee-britches"; cf. OHG ''dioh-bruoh'', Eng thigh, breeches{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

==== Other loans ====
It is assumed{{by whom|date=January 2017}} that [[Ancient Greek language|Greek]] and [[Balkan Latin]] (the ancestor of Romanian and other Balkan Romance languages) exerted a great influence on Albanian. Examples of words borrowed from Latin: ''qytet &lt; civitas'' (city), ''qiell &lt; caelum'' (sky), ''mik &lt; amicus'' (friend).

After the [[Slavs]] arrived in the [[Balkans]], the [[Slavic languages]] became an additional source of loanwords. The rise of the [[Ottoman Empire]] meant an influx of [[Turkish language|Turkish]] words; this also entailed the borrowing of Persian and Arabic words through Turkish. Some Turkish personal names, such as ''Altin'', are common. There are some loanwords from Modern Greek, especially in the south of Albania. Many borrowed words have been replaced by words with Albanian roots or modern Latinized (international) words.

The '''Bouyei language''' ([[exonym and endonym|autonym]]: '''Haausqyaix''' also spelled ''Buyi'', ''Buyei'', or ''Puyi'';&lt;ref name="Ethnologue.com"&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=pcc Ethnologue.com]&lt;/ref&gt; {{zh|s=布依语|p=bùyī yǔ}}, {{lang-vi|tiếng Bố Y}} or ''{{lang|vi|tiếng Giáy}}'') is a language spoken by the [[Bouyei people|Bouyei ethnic group]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110724112501/http://www.travel-china.net/buyi-nationality.html Travel-china.net]&lt;/ref&gt; of southern [[Guizhou Province]] in mainland [[China]]. Classified as a member of the Northern Tai group in the [[Tai languages]] branch of the [[Tai–Kadai]] [[language family]], the language has over 2.5 million native speakers and is also used by the [[Giay people]] ({{lang-vi|Giáy}}) in some parts of [[Vietnam]]. There are native speakers living in [[France]] or the [[United States]] as well, which emigrated from China or Vietnam. About 98% of the native speakers are in China.&lt;ref name="Ethnologue.com"/&gt;

Bouyei's characteristics are similar to the other members of its language branch.  It is generally [[monosyllabic]], and [[word order]] and [[Grammatical particle|particles]] are the main forms of [[grammar]].  Bouyei's [[Syllable onset|syllable initials]] match up closely to the other Northern Tai languages, with relatively fast simplification and merging.  Bouyei sentences can be shown to contain many different levels of phrasing.

The contemporary Bouyei script was developed after the abandonment of the Bouyei-Zhuang Script Alliance Policy in 1981, and was designed from 1981 to 1985.  It is focused and phonologically representative, and takes the [[Wangmo County]] dialect as its foundation.

==Subdivisions and distribution==

===China===
According to a 1950s survey performed by the Chinese government, the Bouyei language as spoken in Guizhou can be divided into three general dialect groups (Snyder 2008). Note that Qián (黔) is an archaic Chinese designation for [[Guizhou]].

#'''The Southern Qian group''' - the largest of the three - from the [[Qianxinan Bouyei and Miao Autonomous Prefecture]], which is mostly intelligible with the [[Zhuang languages#Varieties|Guibian and Guibei Zhuang dialects]]. This vernacular is spoken in the counties of Wangmo, Ceheng, Luodian, Dushan, Libo, Duyun, Pingtang, Zhenfeng, Anlong, Xingren, and Xinyi.
#'''The Central Qian group''' - next most spoken of the three - which is spread throughout [[Qianxinan Buyei and Miao Autonomous Prefecture]] and the suburbs of [[Guiyang]], and is partially intelligible with the Southern Qian dialects (it is very similar to the Zhuang dialects of northern [[Guangxi]]). This vernacular is spoken in the counties of Longli, Guiding, Qingzhen, Pingba, Kaiyang, Guiyang, and Anshun.
#'''The Western Qian dialects''' - the least spoken of the three - which is spoken in the counties of [[Zhenning]], [[Guanling]], [[Ziyun]], [[Qinglong County, Guizhou|Qinglong]], [[Pu'an]], [[Liuzhi]], [[Pan County|Panxian]], [[Shuicheng]], [[Bijie]], and [[Weining Yi Hui and Miao Autonomous County|Weining]]. The western dialects show more unique features than the other two groups. Some western dialects have aspirated stops, which is an uncommon feature in [[northern Tai languages]] (Snyder 2008).

Wu, Snyder, &amp; Liang (2007) is the most comprehensive Bouyei survey to date, and covers the following data points.

The [[Yei Zhuang language|Yei Zhuang]] varieties of [[Wenshan Zhuang and Miao Autonomous Prefecture|Wenshan Prefecture]], [[Yunnan]] are closely related to the Bouyei varieties of [[Guizhou]]. Many other languages outside China with the names "Yei", "Yay", "Yoy", are also closely related.

===Vietnam===
Bouyei is also spoken in [[northern Vietnam]], where it is known as [[Giáy people|Giáy]].&lt;ref&gt;Chu Thái Sơn (1975). "Lịch sử di cư và sinh hoạt văn hóa của người Tu Dí ở Lào Cai". In, Ủy ban khoa học xã hội Việt Nam: Viện dân tộc học. ''Về vấn đề xác định thành phần các dân tộc thiểu số ở miền bắc Việt Nam'', 331-364. Hà Nội: Nhà xuất bản khoa học xã hội.&lt;/ref&gt; Edmondson and Gregerson (2001) has determined their language to be most similar to the Bouyei dialects of southwest Guizhou. The Giáy are an officially recognized group in Vietnam who now number nearly 50,000. Some household registries of the Giáy of Vietnam indicate that their ancestors had left [[Guizhou]] 160 years ago during the [[Qing Dynasty]], and traveled overland to southern [[Yunnan]] and then Vietnam (Edmondson &amp; Gregerson 2001). This coincides with the [[Miao Rebellion (1854–73)]] of Guizhou. The Giáy are found in the following locations of Vietnam.&lt;ref&gt;Edmondson, J.A. and Gregerson, K.J. 2001, "Four Languages of the Vietnam-China Borderlands", in ''Papers from the Sixth Annual Meeting of the Southeast Asian Linguistics Society'', ed. K.L. Adams and T.J. Hudak, Tempe, Arizona, pp. 101-133. Arizona State University, Program for Southeast Asian Studies.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Giáy of [[Mường Khương District]] who call themselves '''Tudì''' [''thu zi''] can only speak a form of Chinese, and no Giáy. Their autonym comes from their ancestral place of origin, which is [[Duyun]] of [[Guizhou]] province, China. According to their household records, they had arrived in [[Maguan County]] and in [[Honghe Prefecture]] about 200 years ago. Similarly, some Giáy of Vietnam report that they have relatives still living in [[Hekou Yao Autonomous County|Hekou]], [[Yunnan]] province, China (Edmondson &amp; Gregerson 2001).

The '''Pu Nả''' people of [[Tam Đường District, Lai Châu]] Province, Vietnam call themselves the ''Vần Nả'' (with ''vần'' meaning 'people'), and number about 5,000 individuals (Lò 2012:11-20).&lt;ref&gt;Lò Văn Chiến. 2012. ''Dân ca người Pu Nả ở Lai Châu''. Nhà xuất bản văn hóa dân tộc. {{ISBN|978-604-70-0107-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are also called ''Quý Châu'' (''[[Guizhou]]'' 贵州), ''Sa Quý Châu'', ''Củi Chu'', ''Pu Y'', or ''Pâu Thìn''. The Pu Nả live in the following villages of Tam Đường District (Lò 2012:18).

The '''Yay''' language described by [[William J. Gedney]] is in fact the Giáy dialect of Mường Hum, [[Bát Xát]] District, [[Lào Cai]] (Edmondson &amp; Gregerson 2001). There are also other related [[Northern Tai languages]] spoken in Vietnam as well, such Bố Y, Nhang, and Quy Châu (possibly closely related to [[Tai Mène language|Tai Mène]] of [[Laos]]). The Bố Y had originally came from around [[Wangmo County]] in southwestern Guizhou. Some subgroups of Bố Y call themselves the ''Pu Na'' or ''Pu Thin'', meaning 'people of the paddy field'.

==Phonology==

===Consonants===
The Bouyei script recognizes 32 consonants, with names formed by the consonant in an initial position followed by a long "a" vowel.

=== Tones ===
Bouyei has six&lt;!--not eight--&gt; [[Tone (linguistics)|tones]], corresponding to [[Four tones|the eight ''sheng'' of Middle Chinese]]: all six in open syllables or with a final {{IPA|/n/}} or {{IPA|/ŋ/}}, reduced to two "entering" tones with a [[Syllable coda|final stop]].

=== Language shift ===
Bouyei shows de-voicing of Proto-Tai–Kadai's voiced consonants ({{IPA|*b}} → {{IPA|/p/}}, {{IPA|*d}} → {{IPA|/t/}}, {{IPA|*ɡ}} → {{IPA|/k/}}), and loss of [[Aspiration (phonetics)|aspiration]].

==Scripts==

===Ancient Bouyei script===
Ancient Bouyei writing was created by borrowing elements from [[Chinese characters]] or by mimicking their forms, and is similar to [[Sawndip]].

===Old Modern Bouyei===
In November 1956, a scientific conference was held in [[Guiyang]] to discuss the creation and implementation of a [[Latin script|Latin-based alphabet]] for Bouyei.  The result was a script similar some Zhuang romanizations that used the [[Longli]] County dialect as its base.  The script was approved by the Chinese government and was put into use in 1957, though its use ceased in 1960.

===Current Bouyei script===
In 1981 a conference on Bouyei history revised the script developed in 1956 in an attempt to make it more practical and phonologically representative of Wangmo County speech.  It also was approved by the Chinese government, and was adopted on an experimental basis in 1982.  Feedback was largely positive, and the script was officially brought into use in March 1985 and continues to be used to the present.

The Akademie was founded in [[Bloemfontein]] in 1909, and its arm, the ''Spellingskommissie'' (''Spelling Commission''), was formed in 1914 and renamed in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oocities.org/afrikaanse_spelreels/geskiedenis.html Die Geskiedenis van die Afrikaanse Woordelys en Spelreëls] History of the AWS&lt;/ref&gt;

The Language Commission focuses mainly on the revision and publication of the ''[[Afrikaanse Woordelys en Spelreëls]]'' (''Afrikaans Word List and Spelling Rules''), a standard guide to the [[spelling]] and related writing conventions of the Afrikaans language.&lt;ref name=Tom&gt;{{cite news | last = Rademeyer | first = Alet | title = Tom is leier van taal se komitee | pages = | newspaper = Beeld | location = Johannesburg | date = 24 March 2012 | url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is held as an authoritative source for the spelling of Afrikaans words, of which several, such as "baie", were spelled in multiple ways up to 1917. Ten editions of the ''AWS'' have appeared up to 2009.

Furthermore it takes cognizance of Afrikaans [[grammar]] and the natural developments in the Afrikaans language community, such as new terminology which emerges in technology and other disciplines.&lt;ref name=Tom/&gt; Its coverage of varieties of Standard Afrikaans is being expanded, which includes the Nama, [[Griqua people|Griekwa]] and Kaaps varieties. A large corpus of the words used in the Afrikaans [[Islam in South Africa|Muslim community]] is also included in the ''AWS''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.akademie.co.za/articles/30/taalkommissie0 Die Suid-Afrikaanse Akademie vir Wetenskap en Kuns: Taalkommissie] The Akademie's website (in Afrikaans only)&lt;/ref&gt;

U.S.-based institutions that are eligible to apply for the grants include universities, colleges, tribal colleges and universities, tribal-serving institutions or tribal nations, and non-profit, non-academic institutions.&lt;ref&gt;The Society for the Study of the Indigenous Languages of the Americas http://www.ssila.org/2016/01/05/webinar-on-documenting-endangered-languages-program-at-nsf/&lt;/ref&gt; Currently this program offers two subareas, one which provides funding opportunities via Senior Research Grants and Fellowships, and one that supports Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement Grants for dissertation students.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nsf.gov/funding/pgm_summ.jsp?pims_id=12816&lt;/ref&gt;

The DEL program is part of a worldwide focus in the 21st century by funding agencies to support projects that work on recording and analyzing the linguistic knowledge of native speakers while these languages continue to be spoken, and to assist with documentation work within communities where languages are threatened.&lt;ref&gt;Austin, Peter K., ed. 2010.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7081">In mathematics, the '''Dyson conjecture''' {{harvs |first=Freeman |last=Dyson |year=1962 |authorlink=Freeman Dyson}} is a conjecture about the constant term of certain [[Laurent polynomial]]s, proved by [[Kenneth G. Wilson|Wilson]] and Gunson. [[George Andrews (mathematician)|Andrews]] generalized it to the '''q-Dyson conjecture''', proved by [[Doron Zeilberger|Zeilberger]] and [[David Bressoud|Bressoud]] and sometimes called the '''Zeilberger–Bressoud theorem'''. [[Ian G. Macdonald|Macdonald]] generalized it further to more general [[root system]]s with the '''Macdonald constant term conjecture''', proved by [[Ivan Cherednik|Cherednik]].

==Dyson conjecture==

The Dyson conjecture states that the [[Laurent polynomial]]

:&lt;math&gt;\prod _{1\le i\ne j\le n}(1-t_i/t_j)^{a_i}&lt;/math&gt;

has constant term

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{(a_1+a_2+\cdots+a_n)!}{a_1!a_2!\cdots a_n!}.&lt;/math&gt;

The conjecture was first proved independently by {{harvtxt|Wilson|1962}} and {{harvtxt|Gunson|1962}}. {{harvtxt|Good|1970}} later found a short proof, by observing that the Laurent polynomials, and therefore their constant terms, satisfy the recursion relations

:&lt;math&gt;F(a_1,\dots,a_n) = \sum_{i=1}^nF(a_1,\dots,a_i-1,\dots,a_n).&lt;/math&gt;

The case  ''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3 of Dyson's conjecture follows from the [[Dixon identity]].

{{harvtxt|Sills|Zeilberger|2006}} and {{harv|Sills|2006}} used a computer to find expressions for non-constant coefficients of
Dyson's Laurent polynomial.

==Dyson integral==
When all the values ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;  are equal to β/2, the constant term in Dyson's conjecture is the value of '''Dyson's integral'''

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{(2\pi)^n}\int_0^{2\pi}\cdots\int_0^{2\pi}\prod_{1\le j&lt;k\le n}|e^{i\theta_j}-e^{i\theta_k}|^\beta \, d\theta_1\cdots d\theta_n.&lt;/math&gt;

Dyson's integral is a special case of [[Selberg's integral]] after a change of variable and has value

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\Gamma(1+\beta n/2)}{\Gamma(1+\beta/2)^n}&lt;/math&gt;

which gives another proof of Dyson's conjecture in this special case.

==''q''-Dyson conjecture==
{{harvtxt|Andrews|1975}} found a [[q-analog]] of Dyson's conjecture, stating that the constant term of 
:&lt;math&gt;\prod_{1\le i&lt;j\le n}\left(\frac{x_i}{x_j};q\right)_{a_i}\left(\frac{qx_j}{x_i};q\right)_{a_j}&lt;/math&gt;
is 
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{(q;q)_{a_1+\cdots+a_n}}{(q;q)_{a_1}\cdots(q;q)_{a_n}}.&lt;/math&gt;
Here (''a'';''q'')&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[q-Pochhammer symbol]].
This conjecture reduces to Dyson's conjecture for ''q''=1, and was proved by {{harvtxt|Zeilberger|Bressoud|1985}}, using a combinatorial approach inspired by
previous work of [[Ira Gessel]] and [[Dominique Foata]]. A shorter proof, using formal Laurent series, was given in 2004 by Ira Gessel and Guoce Xin, and
an even shorter proof, using a quantitative form, due to Karasev and Petrov, and independently to Lason, of Noga Alon's Combinatorial Nullstellensatz,
was given in 2012 by Gyula Karolyi and Zoltan Lorant Nagy.
The latter method was extended, in 2013, by Shalosh B. Ekhad and Doron Zeilberger to derive explicit expressions of any specific coefficient, not just the
constant term, see http://www.math.rutgers.edu/~zeilberg/mamarim/mamarimhtml/qdyson.html, for detailed references.

==Macdonald conjectures==
{{harvtxt|Macdonald|1982}} extended the conjecture to arbitrary finite or affine [[root system]]s, with Dyson's original conjecture corresponding to 
the case of the ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&amp;minus;1&lt;/sub&gt; root system and Andrews's conjecture corresponding to the affine ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&amp;minus;1&lt;/sub&gt; root system. Macdonald reformulated these conjectures as conjectures about the norms of [[Macdonald polynomial]]s. Macdonald's conjectures were proved by {{harv|Cherednik|1995}} using doubly affine Hecke algebras.

[[Ian G. Macdonald|Macdonald]]'s form of Dyson's conjecture for root systems of type BC is closely related to [[Selberg's integral]].

'''Elen Egryn''', pen name of '''Elin''' (or '''Elinor''') '''Evans''', (1807–1876) was a [[Welsh language|Welsh-language]] poet.&lt;ref name="DaviesJenkins2008"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Davies|first1=John|last2=Jenkins|first2=Nigel|last3=Baines|first3=Menna|title=The Welsh Academy encyclopaedia of Wales|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-ZEUAQAAIAAJ|year=2008|publisher=University of Wales Press|isbn=978-0-7083-1953-6|page=269}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was the first woman to have a book published in the Welsh language.

==Biography==

Ellen Egryn was the daughter of Ellis Humphrey Evans, a village schoolmaster, and his wife. She was brought up in western Wales in the little village [[Llanegryn]], then in [[Merionethshire]], where she learnt to write poetry as a child.&lt;ref name="Stephens1998"&gt;{{cite book|last=Stephens|first=Meic|title=The new companion to the literature of Wales|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WoMYAAAAIAAJ|year=1998|publisher=University of Wales Press|isbn=978-0-7083-1383-1|page=229}}&lt;/ref&gt; She moved to [[Liverpool]] in 1840 but soon returned to [[Machynlleth]] not far from her home town. It was there that in 1850 she created the collection ''Telyn Egryn'' (Egryn's Harp), becoming the first woman ever to publish a secular Welsh-language book. Although she did not receive the same degree of attention as contemporary male poets, the work is considered to be a milestone in the history of women's literature in Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.lingue.unibo.it/acume/acumedvd/zone/research/essays/links_gramich.htm|title=Orality and Morality: Early Welsh Women’s Poetry|author=Gramich, Katie|publisher=Acume: Oral and Written History|accessdate=1 April 2016 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It presents a broad range of poetry covering bereavement, friendship, exile and depression, purposefully invoking an impression of the high moral standards enjoyed by Welsh women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.honno.co.uk/dangos.php?ISBN=9781870206303|title=''Telyn Egryn''|publisher=Honno|accessdate=1 April 2016 |language=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her poetry is closer to the work of 18th-century poets than to that of the Victorian poets who followed her in that she employed a level of language rooted in the pre-medieval period.&lt;ref name="Aaron2010"/&gt;

Also in 1850, in reaction to the publication of the [[Treachery of the Blue Books|Blue Books]] which severely criticized the loose morals and behaviour of Welsh women, [[Evan Jones (Ieuan Gwynedd)|Evan Jones]] (1820–1852) published ''[[Y Gymraes]]'' (The Welsh Women) which set out to defend the high principles of Welsh women. Elen Egryn contributed a poetic introduction to the first issue, in which she called for women to rise "above shame and hateful mockery" (''goruwch gwarth a dirmyg cas'').&lt;ref name="Aaron2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Aaron|first=Jane|title=Nineteenth-Century Women's Writing in Wales: Nation, Gender and Identity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h0iuBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA94|year=2010|publisher=University of Wales Press|isbn=978-0-7083-2287-1|pages=94–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''EuroMatrixPlus''' is a project that ran from March 2009 to February 2012. EuroMatrixPlus succeeded a project called [[Euromatrix|EuroMatrix]] (September 2006 to February 2009) and continued in further development and improvement of [[machine translation]] (MT) systems for languages of the [[European Union]] (EU).

== Project objectives ==

EuroMatrixPlus focused on achieving several goals:
* To continue advance of MT technology (create MT systems for all official EU languages and provide other MT researchers with existing data and infrastructure).
* To continually expand and investigate different MT approaches and techniques; to stay open to novel combinations of methods of MT.
* To bring MT to the users. Users post-edit output of statistical models and the system learns from the feedback and improves itself. Two groups of users were aimed at: 
** Professional translators and translation agencies
** Users who voluntarily translate texts into their native language
* To contribute to MT research in Europe.
* To produce sample application for automatic translation of news and web pages and make that application freely accessible.

== Outcome ==

EuroMatrixPlus contributed to MT field in several ways. It continued in development of an open source statistical MT engine [[Moses (machine translation)|Moses]]. The project worked on research in [[Hybrid machine translation|hybrid approaches to MT]] (combination of [[Rule-based machine translation|rule-based]] and [[Statistical machine translation|statistical]] techniques). Several “MT Marathons” and annual evaluation campaigns were organized by the project. The project also resulted in releasing of 196 scientific publications.

The results of the work were arranged into ten work packages:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euromatrixplus.net/workpackages/ Work Packages]&lt;/ref&gt;
* WP1: Rich Tree-Based Statistical Translation  
* WP2: Hybrid Machine Translation  
* WP3: Advanced Learning Methods for MT  
* WP4: Open Source Tools and Data  
* WP5: "WikiTrans" Translation Environments  
* WP6: Integrated Localisation Workflow  
* WP7: Evaluation Campaign  
* WP8: Project Management and Dissemination  
* WP9: Integrating Slovak Language Resources  
* WP10: HPSG-based Statistical Translation

=== Software and data ===
Here is a list of software and data that were released by the project:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.euromatrixplus.net/resources/ Software and data]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Appraise – an open source tool for manual evaluation of MT output
* BURGER – Bulgarian Resource 
* BulTreeBank – Treebank of Bulgarian
* CSLM toolkit – free tool for training continuous space language models (CSLM) to large tasks
* [[Caitra]] – tool for post-editing MT results
* [[Europarl]] – European Parliament parallel corpus
* IRSTLM toolkit – tool for training language models
* Joshua – an open-source statistical machine translation decoder for hierarchical and syntax-based MT
* MT Server Land – an open-source architecture for MT
* [[Moses (machine translation)|Moses]] – statistical MT 
* MultiUN Corpora – parallel corpus extracted from the United Nations Website
* PCEDT 2.0 – Prague Czech-English Dependency Treebank
* PEDT 2.0 – English part of the Prague Czech-English Dependency Treebank
* Slovak corpora – English-Slovak and Czech-Slovak as well as a Slovak-English and a Slovak-Czech parallel corpus 
* Slovak treebank – A dependency treebank
* TermEx – RBMT-Suited Statistical Terminology Extraction Tool
* Treex, TectoMT

== Funding ==

The EuroMatrixPlus project was sponsored by [[Information Society Technologies|EU Information Society Technology program]].

Total cost of the project was 5 942 121 €, from which the European Union contributed 4 266 896 €.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/89512_en.html cordis.europa.eu/project/rcn/89512_en.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Project members ==

To ensure advance in MT, several organizations that are experts in various disciplines (linguistics, computer science, mathematics, translation) were brought together to cooperate on EuroMatrixPlus.

The consortium consisted of academic as well as commercial partners. Academic partners were the [[University of Edinburgh]] (United Kingdom), [[DFKI]] – German Research Centre for Artificial Intelligence (Germany), [[Charles University]] (Czech Republic), [[Johns Hopkins University]] (United States), [[University of Le Mans]] (France), Fondazione Bruno Kessler (Italy), [[Dublin City University]] (Ireland). Two institutions joined about one year into the project. These were the L'udovít Štúr Institute of Linguistics (Slovak Republic) and IICT –  Institute of Information and Communication Technologies at the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences (Bulgaria).

Commercial partners included Lucy Software and Services GmbH (Germany) and CEET s.r.o. (Czech Republic).

Coordination of the project was in hands of DFKI with its Language Technology Lab in Saarbrücken. The principal investigator and scientific coordinator was [[Hans Uszkoreit]], a professor of Computational Linguistics at [[Saarland University]].

'''Event cinema''' sometimes called '''alternative content cinema''' or '''livecasts''' refers to the use of [[Theatre|cinema]] [[Theater|theaters]] to display a varied range of live and recorded entertainment excluding traditional films, such as [[Sports|sport]], [[opera]], [[Musical theatre|musicals]], [[ballet]], [[music]], [[Television special|
one-off TV specials]], [[current events|current affairs]], [[comedy]] and [[Church service|religious services]]. 

{{toc limit}}
==History and development==
Event Cinema was set up at the start of the century with rock concerts by Bon Jovi (2001), David Bowie (2003), and Robbie Williams (2005) bringing non-film audiences into cinemas that had newly installed digital equipment.  The [[Metropolitan Opera]] in [[New York City|New York]] through their partnership with [[Fathom Events]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fathom Events Presents Met Opera Live in HD|url=https://www.fathomevents.com/series/the-met-live-in-hd|website=Fathom Events}}&lt;/ref&gt; is acknowledged as the trailblazer in this area, aggressively seeking out new markets and setting high standards for live broadcasts via satellite. Emulated by other [[Opera house|opera houses]] worldwide such as the [[Royal Opera House]] following a close second, [[Glyndebourne]], [[La Scala]] and the [[Sydney Opera House]] the genre of opera within the 'Event Cinema' industry has been a huge success, and has brought new, younger audiences into cash-strapped opera houses depended on state funding and wealthy benefactors for the first time - an unforeseen and happy consequence of digitisation.&lt;ref name="overview"&gt;{{cite news | author=David Hancock | url=http://www.screendigest.com/reports/2011222a/2011_03_alternative_content_in_cinemas/view.html | title= Alternative Content in Cinemas | publisher=Screen Digest |date=2011-03-22 | accessdate=2011-03-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="trade"&gt;{{cite news | author= | url=http://www.moviescopemag.com/features/trade-body-event-cinema-association-launches-to-promote-exploding-market-of-alternative-cinema/ | title= Trade body Event Cinema Association launches to promote exploding market of alternative cinema | publisher=Movie Scope |date=2012-07-09 | accessdate=2012-07-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="edcf"&gt;{{cite news | author= | url=http://www.edcf.net/edcf_docs/edcf_alt_content_for_dcinema.pdf/ | title= Trade body Event Cinema Association launches to promote exploding market of alternative cinema | publisher=European Digital Cinema Forum |date=2008-07-01 | accessdate=2008-07-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ballet and theater have also been very successful, as have rock concerts, both live and recorded. The UK's [[National Theatre (UK)|National Theatre]] has been a huge success here with their season of live broadcasts under the banner 'NT Live', featuring big name casts such as [[Helen Mirren]], whose recent turn as [[Elizabeth II|Queen Elizabeth II]] in [[The_Audience_(2013_play)|The Audience]] was a sell out everywhere. (This was in partnership with another West End theatre and the NT are keen to help other theatres maximise their potential through live broadcasts). The Globe and the Royal Shakespeare Company are also producing work for live broadcast and recorded exhibition.  As digitisation of cinemas matures, the Event Cinema industry is growing. The strongest territory is the US, followed by the UK and mainland European territories. Latin America is also a very strong market.&lt;ref name="DCI Cinema Today"&gt;{{cite news | author=TI | url=http://www.dcinematoday.com/dc/pr.aspx?newsID=912 | title= DLP Cinema Technology Surpasses 5,000 Screen Milestone | publisher=DCinematoday.com |date=2007-10-19 | accessdate=2007-10-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="overview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="edcf"/&gt;

Recent additions include Pompeii Live, a unique exhibition by the UK's British Museum, featuring celebrities and curators taking the audience on a live tour around the recreated set of Pompeii within the museum itself, and they are also exploring the schools market for the first time, following the live broadcast on June 18 with a daytime broadcast aimed at UK schools for the first time. If successful this will no doubt prove a model for future museums to emulate. Art galleries have already produced tours along these lines with the Royal Academy and the National Gallery both producing excellent tours along similar lines. 

An added incentive for exhibitors is the ability to show alternative content, i.e. alternative to mainstream, studio-driven content, such as live special events, sports, pre-show advertising and other digital or video content. In industry terms this has become known as 'Alternative Content', but has recently become known more widely as 'Event Cinema'.&lt;ref name="overview"/&gt; 

===Expanding markets===
Some low-budget films that would normally not have a theatrical release because of distribution costs might be shown in smaller engagements than the typical large release studio pictures. The cost of duplicating a digital "print" is very low, so adding more theaters to a release has a small additional cost to the distributor. Movies that start with a small release could scale to a much larger release quickly if they were sufficiently successful, opening up the possibility that smaller movies could achieve [[box office]] success previously out of their reach.&lt;ref name="DCI Cinema Today"&gt;{{cite news | author=TI | url=http://www.dcinematoday.com/dc/pr.aspx?newsID=912 | title= DLP Cinema Technology Surpasses 5,000 Screen Milestone | publisher=DCinematoday.com |date=2007-10-19 | accessdate=2007-10-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="trade"/&gt;&lt;ref name="edcf"/&gt;

==== Technical Specifications ==== 
Event Cinema is also finding a market in 3rd world countries in which the higher costs and quality of DCI equipment are not yet affordable, as crucially there are no DCI specifications for Alternative Content as there is in mainstream [studio] content. This has led to an explosion in the variety of content on offer, but lack of standardisation has led to questionable quality at times. As the industry matures, this lack of regulation is expected to change and there are moves afoot to introduce codes of practice and technical specifications.&lt;ref name="overview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="trade"/&gt;&lt;ref name="edcf"/&gt;

Recorded content complements mainstream studio content by maximising the 'downtime' that plagues the cinema industry, where screens worldwide spend a large proportion of their time in darkness and cinemas empty. Some cinema chains have targeted pensioners in particular, offering free tea and coffee for afternoon matinees of recorded opera, for example. DCPs have been useful to cinemas not yet equipped with satellite broadcasting capability and has enabled exhibitors to build their Event Cinema audience, which is not generally the 18-24 demographic that multiplexes are targeting.&lt;ref name="trade"/&gt;&lt;ref name="edcf"/&gt;  

==== New Audiences ====
Event Cinema has seen a return of an older, affluent audience, previously turned off by the multiplex experience, and cinemas are starting to capitalise on this by offering waiter-serviced, high class finger food and alcoholic beverages, complete with bars and restaurants, a world away from the traditional popcorn/soft drink model; art house cinemas are increasingly marketing themselves as 'destination' venues for an evening's entertainment, somewhere to spend an entire evening, rather than just a couple of hours.  As exhibition admissions have plateau'd in recent years due to the explosion in VOD, tablet and mobile content technology, this new revenue stream has been a surprise and welcome addition to the cinema industry, though the US studios have been cautious in embracing the change as yet.&lt;ref name="overview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nj2012"&gt;{{cite web| title= Newtown's old-time movie house looks for revival in the digital age| url=http://www.nj.com/mercer/index.ssf/2012/03/newtowns_old-time_movie_house.html | date= March 19, 2012 | first=Joyce J. |last=Persico|work= [[The Times (Trenton)|The Times, Trenton]] | publisher= New Jersey On-Line LLC| accessdate=2012-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="trade"/&gt;&lt;ref name="edcf"/&gt;

The thrill of Live broadcasts means they are generally regarded as more popular than recorded events, but there are exceptions; artists with a loyal cult or teenage following tend to do particularly well in this area, as concert films featuring artists such as the [[Grateful Dead]], [[Pearl Jam]], [[JLS]], [[Led Zeppelin]] and the [[Rolling Stones]] have shown.&lt;ref name="edcf"/&gt;

==== The Future ==== 
As more and more distributors are emerging, offering an increasingly broad range of content to cinemas worldwide, the landscape itself is shifting: screen advertising companies, technical providers, and exhibitors themselves are reinventing themselves as Alternative Content or Event Cinema distributors, and the industry is witnessing a re-evaluation of business models and practices worldwide.  Predictions are that this industry could be work in excess of US$1bn by 2015. An illustration of the growth of this industry is the news the establishment of a European trade association promoting the industry to the general public and supporting those involved in it and the Event Cinema Association.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news   | last = Taub  | first = Eric A.  | title = AMC to Get Sony Digital Projectors  | newspaper = New York Times  | location = New York  | date = March 29, 2009  | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/30/technology/companies/30sony.html  | accessdate = November 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="trade"/&gt;&lt;ref name="edcf"/&gt;

'''Fatmir Gjata''' (1922&amp;ndash;1989) was a prominent Albanian writer of [[Socialist Realism]]. He is considered one of the top two Albanian novelists (next to [[Ismail Kadare]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=loYxAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=fatmir+gjata&amp;dq=fatmir+gjata&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=njVeVfbsMsG2sAG5soDoAQ&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwBDge| series=Collier's encyclopedia: with bibliography and index|volume=I| page=473| author=Bernard Johnston| year=1992| title=Albania| publisher=Macmillan Educational Co|location=New York| oclc=25518767}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Failed verification|date=June 2015}}

==Life==
Fatmir Gjata was born in [[Korçë]], [[Albania]] in 1922.&lt;ref name="IAP"&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZqtiAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=fatmir+gjata&amp;dq=fatmir+gjata&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=njVeVfbsMsG2sAG5soDoAQ&amp;ved=0CEUQ6AEwCDge| pages=116–117| title=Gjurmime albanologjike| series=Seria e shkencave filologjike| volume=15-16| location=Prishtina|year=1986| publisher=Instituti Albanologjik i Prishtines| oclc= 	475280214}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father Isuf Gjata was a teacher who joined the [[National Liberation Movement (Albania)|National Liberation Movement]] during [[World War II]] and fell in 1944. Fatmir Gjata studied in the [[Albanian National Lyceum|French Lyceum of Korçë]] and later he attended the [[Maxim Gorky Literature Institute]] in [[Moscow]]. As a communist and a poet, he wrote several poetry volumes during World War II and later, some of which would become known [[partisan songs]]. During the war he was in charge of a local illegal newspaper. He poetry was embroidered with march-style enthusiasm and solemn [[lexicology]].&lt;ref name="IAP"/&gt;

He would claim his place in Albanian literature during 1950-90 period with his novels,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FPdRAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1254&amp;dq=fatmir+gjata&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=gzVeVZDeG4SQsAHms4CwBw&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwBDgU#v=onepage&amp;q=fatmir%20gjata&amp;f=false|page=1254| author=Paul Schellinger| publisher=Routledge| year=1998|isbn=1579580157 | title=Encyclopedia of the Novel}}&lt;/ref&gt; theatrical plays, short story volumes and screenplays, some of which would turn into films such as [[Tana (film)|''Tana'']], the first Albanian movie.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oZAHAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=fatmir+gjata&amp;dq=fatmir+gjata&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=iEleVebLCOTOyQPVkYDQBw&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwBzg8|language=Albanian| title=Filmi shqiptar| publisher=8 Nëntori| author=Fisnik Pulaj| page=10|oclc= 	5615835}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fatmir Gjata is also known for directing some of the most important institutes of art and culture in [[Communist Albania]]. He served as Chairman of the Committee for Arts and Culture, member of the [[Albanian League of Writers and Artists]],  [[editor-in-chief]] for 25 years of ''[[Nëntori]]'' literary magazine, journalist, and member of the collegial council for other press organs such as ''[[Zëri i Popullit]]'', ''[[Drita (magazine)|Drita]]'', ''[[Ylli (magazine)|Ylli]]'', ''[[Hosteni]]'', etc. His work has been translated into other languages.

Many of his works received national prizes in Albania, such as "Republic's First Prize", "Order of the Flag of First Class", etc.

He died in [[Tirana]], in 1989.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1038">In [[computational linguistics]], the '''Gale–Church algorithm''' is a method for aligning corresponding sentences in a [[parallel corpus]]. It works on the principle that equivalent sentences should roughly correspond in length&amp;mdash;that is, longer sentences in one language should correspond to longer sentences in the other language.  The [[algorithm]] was described in a [http://acl.ldc.upenn.edu/J/J93/J93-1004.pdf 1993 paper] by William A. Gale and Kenneth W. Church of [[Bell Labs|AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1009">'''Guerilla ontology''' is a practice described by author [[Robert Anton Wilson]] in his 1980 book ''[[The Illuminati Papers]]'' as "the basic technique of all my books. Ontology is the study of being; the guerrilla approach is to so mix the elements of each book that the reader must decide on each page 'How much of this is real and how much is a put-on?'" 

==Practice==
The goal of guerrilla ontology is to expose an individual or individuals to radically unique ideas, thoughts, and words, in order to invoke [[cognitive dissonance]], which can cause a degree of discomfort in some individuals as they find their belief systems challenged by new concepts. 

The ultimate goal of guerrilla ontology is to promote positive brain change and new ways of experiencing and adapting to reality.{{Citation needed|date = August 2013}}

__NOTOC__
&lt;!--
Attention! Please do not insert the "Hacker Manifesto" text into the article! That would, without specific permission from the Mentor to license it under a GFDL-compatible license, constitute an '''illegal''' copyright violation; for more information go to "Wikipedia:Copyrights". This is not negotiable.
--&gt;
'''''The Conscience of a Hacker''''' (also known as '''''The Hacker Manifesto''''') is a small essay written January 8, 1986 by a [[Hacker (computer security)|computer security hacker]] who went by the handle (or [[pseudonym]]) of The Mentor (born [[Loyd Blankenship]]), who belonged to the 2nd generation of [[Legion of Doom (hacking)|Legion of Doom]].&lt;ref name=elfinterview&gt;{{cite web|title=Elf Qrin interviews The Mentor|url=http://www.elfqrin.com/docs/hakref/interviews/eq-i-mentor.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was written after the author's arrest, and first published in the [[underground ezine|underground hacker ezine]] ''[[Phrack]]''&lt;ref name=originalarticle&gt;{{cite journal|author1=The Mentor|title=The Conscience of a Hacker|volume=1|issue=7|page=3 of 10|url=http://www.phrack.org/archives/issues/7/3.txt|accessdate=15 June 2014|publisher=Phrack, Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and can be found on many websites, as well as on T-shirts and in films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Hacker Culture |first=Douglas |last=Thomas |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |year=2003 |isbn=978-0-8166-3346-3 |pages=xxiv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Considered a cornerstone of [[hacker culture]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Marsh|first1=Josh|title=Hacking and Philosophy: The Mentor’s Manifesto|url=http://hackaday.com/2013/11/04/hacking-and-philosophy-the-mentors-manifesto/|publisher=Hackaday.com|accessdate=15 June 2014|date=November 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Manifesto'' acts as a guideline to hackers across the globe, especially those new to the field. It serves as an ethical foundation for hacking, and asserts that there is a point to hacking that supersedes selfish desires to exploit or harm other people, and that technology should be used to expand our horizons and try to keep the world [[freedom of information|free]].

When asked about his motivation for writing the article, Blankenship said, &lt;blockquote&gt;I was going through hacking withdrawal, and [[Craig Neidorf|Craig/Knight Lightning]] needed something for an upcoming issue of Phrack. I was reading ''[[The Moon is a Harsh Mistress]]'' and was very taken with the idea of revolution.&lt;ref name="elfinterview"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;  At a more prominent public event, when asked about his arrest and motivation for writing the article, Blankenship said, &lt;blockquote&gt;I was just in a computer I shouldn’t have been. And [had] a great deal of empathy for my friends around the nation that were also in the same situation. This was post-WarGames, the movie, so pretty much the only public perception of hackers at that time was ‘hey, we’re going to start a nuclear war, or play tic-tac-toe, one of the two,’ and so I decided I would try to write what I really felt was the essence of what we were doing and why we were doing it.&lt;ref name="h2k2video"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Blankenship|first1=Lloyd|title="The Conscience of a Hacker," Panel at H2K2 (Hackers on Planet Earth)|publisher=2600|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0tEnnvZbYek|accessdate=15 June 2014|location=New York, NY|date=July 13, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.h2k2.net/panels.html#mentor |title=The Mentor at H2K2 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050414153806/http://www.h2k2.net/display_grid.khtml?event=7 |archivedate=2005-04-14 |accessdate=2014-04-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== In popular culture ==
The article is quoted several times in the 1995 movie ''[[Hackers (movie)|Hackers]]'', although in the movie it is being read from an issue of the hacker magazine ''[[2600 The Hacker Quarterly|2600]]'', not the historically accurate ''[[Phrack]]''.

The Mentor gave a reading of ''The Hacker Manifesto'' and offered additional insight at [[H.O.P.E.|H2K2]].&lt;ref name="h2k2video"/&gt; It is also an item in the game ''[[Culpa Innata]]''.

[[File:Bling-bling - table.jpg|thumb|A nude woman being used as a decorative table. She is required to stay in the same posture, such that the [[vase]] over her does not fall.]]

'''Human furniture''' is [[furniture]] in which a person's body is used as a tray, foot stool, chair, table, cabinet or other item. '''Forniphilia''' is the practice of creating human furniture. Examples of human furniture have appeared in [[modern art]] and in [[pornography]].

==Art==
A model used as human furniture may be nude or semi-nude to add to the [[Eroticism|erotic]] or aesthetic appeal.

The '''hyphen-minus''' ('''-''') is a [[Character (computing)|character]] used in digital documents and computing to represent a [[hyphen]] (‐) or a [[Plus and minus signs#Minus sign|minus sign]] (−).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Unicode explained |author=Jukka K. Korpela |publisher=O'Reilly |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-596-10121-3 |page=382 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PcWU2yxc8WkC&amp;pg=PA382}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is present in [[Unicode]] as [[code point]] {{nobr|{{unichar|002D|HYPHEN-MINUS}}}}; it is also in [[ASCII]] with the same value.

==Description==
[[Image:Fünfundvierzig-nc-.svg|thumb|left|The [[Glyph (typography)|Glyph]] for the hyphen-minus is shorter (less wide) than that of the plus sign]]

The use of a single character for both hyphen and minus was a compromise made in the early days of fixed-width [[typewriter]]s and [[computer display]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author-last=Fischer |author-first=Eric |title=The Evolution of Character Codes, 1874-1968 |url=http://www.trafficways.org/ascii/ascii.pdf |access-date=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in proper [[typesetting]] and graphic design, there are distinct characters for [[hyphen]]s, [[dash]]es, and the [[minus sign]]. Usage of the hyphen-minus nonetheless persists in many contexts, as it is well-known, easy to enter on [[Alphanumeric keyboard|keyboard]]s, and in the same location in all common character sets.

==As the minus sign==
Most [[programming language]]s, restricting themselves to 7-bit [[ASCII]], use the hyphen-minus, rather than the Unicode character {{unichar |2212|MINUS SIGN}}, for denoting subtraction and negative numbers.&lt;ref name="c"&gt;{{cite journal |author-last=Ritchie |author-first=Dennis |author-link=Dennis Ritchie |title=C Reference Manual |date=c. 1975 |url=https://www.bell-labs.com/usr/dmr/www/cman.pdf |access-date=2016-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="haskell"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.haskell.org/definition/haskell2010.pdf |title=Haskell 2010 Language Report |access-date=2016-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The minus sign is nominally the same width as the plus sign. In [[proportional font|proportional]] typefaces it is longer than a hyphen. During typesetting a [[word wrap]] may also occur following a hyphen-minus, unlike the minus sign proper which is treated as a mathematical symbol. These differences make "-" as a substitute for minus signs undesirable in professional typography.

==Other uses==

On typewriters, it was conventional to use a pair of hyphens to represent an [[em dash]], and this convention is still sometimes used in computer text.

The hyphen-minus is often used to represent an [[en dash]], which may be used to indicate ranges (such as a time range of "2000–2004"), direction (as in "The Los Angeles–London flight"), and other cases of connection. The en dash is normally longer (the width of a letter "n") than a hyphen, though in a fixed-pitch or typewriter font there is no difference.  The hyphen connects closely, the en dash less closely, while the em dash (the width of a letter "m") separates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hyphens, En Dashes, Em Dashes|url=http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/qanda/data/faq/topics/HyphensEnDashesEmDashes/faq0002.html|website=The Chicago Manual of Style Online|accessdate=25 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Junk silver''' is an informal term used in the United States, United Kingdom, Canada and Australia for any [[silver coin]] which is in fair or cull [[Coin grading|condition]] and has no [[Numismatics|numismatic]] or [[Coin collecting|collectible]] value above the [[Precious metal|bullion]] value of the [[silver]] it contains. Such coins are popular among people seeking to [[Silver as an investment|invest in silver]], particularly in small amounts. The word "junk" refers only to the value of the coins as collectibles and not to the actual condition of the coins; junk silver is not necessarily [[scrap]] silver.&lt;ref name="Monex"&gt;
This citation provides no clarification distinguishing the term junk silver from the equally ambiguous term scrap silver.

Precious metals including silver are measured in [[Troy weight|troy]] [[Troy ounce|ounces]] (ozt). A [[spot price]] for silver is the price for a troy ounce of silver which is 99.9-percent pure, or [[Millesimal fineness|999 fine]]. Silver coins including junk-silver coins have set silver-alloy contents ranging from 35-percent to 90-percent or more. The term "coin silver," for example, refers to 90-percent silver alloy which was the most common alloy used to mint silver U.S. coins.

Any combination of 90-percent silver U.S. coins which have a face value of US$1.00 contains 0.715 troy ounces of 99.9-percent silver&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=1964 D Washington Quarter|url=http://www.coincommunity.com/us_quarter_dollars/1964_d_washington_quarter.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (0.7234 troy ounces if uncirculated), except for the silver dollars (Morgan and Peace) which contain .7736 troy ounces of silver. In other words, a full troy ounce of 99.9-percent silver is contained in any combination of 90-percent silver U.S. coins which have a face value of US$1.40.&lt;ref name="Coinflation"&gt;

Canadian [[Canadian silver dollar|dollar]], [[50 cent piece (Canadian coin)|half-dollar]], [[Quarter (Canadian coin)|quarter]] and [[Dime (Canadian coin)|dime]] coins minted after 1919 and before 1967 contained 80-percent silver.

The 1967 [[Quarter (Canadian coin)|quarter]] and [[Dime (Canadian coin)|dime]] were minted in either 80% or 50% silver. The 50% quarters and dimes continued part way through 1968 until the mint introduced the 100-percent nickel versions of all the coins mentioned beforehand.  To tell the 1968 nickel and silver coins apart, the ones made from nickel are magnetic whereas the silver coins are not.

Australian "pre-decimal" [[Florin (Australian coin)|florin]], [[Shilling (Australian)|shilling]], [[Sixpence (Australian)|sixpence]] and [[Threepence (Australian)|threepence]] coins minted from 1910 to 1945 contained 92.5-percent silver. From 1946 to 1964, they were minted in "post-silver" coins which contained 50-percent silver. In 1966, the [[Australian 50 cent coin (round)|"round" 50-cent coin]] contained 80-percent silver.&lt;ref name="SilverStackersCoinCalculator"&gt;

Swiss 1/2 [[Swiss franc|Franken]], 1 Franken and 2 Franken minted from 1874 to 1967 contained 83.5 percent silver. 5 Franken minted from 1922 to 1928 contained 90-percent silver and weighed 25g, and those minted between 1931-1969 contained 83.5 percent silver and weighed 15g.

Many Mexican and other Central American countries made silver coins that are considered junk silver today.

==Popularity==
Junk-silver coins may be a desirable method of investing in silver for several reasons:
;Low premiums: Coins can often be purchased for little or no [[buyer's premium|premium]] over the spot price of silver, particularly during periods of economic stability.
;Legal tender: Coins remain [[legal tender]] and maintain their face value regardless of the price of silver.
;Recognition
:Coins are familiar and less likely to have their value disputed than silver rounds or bars.
;Divisibility: Coins can be easily spent or traded in small amounts. In contrast, minted silver bullion is rarely smaller than a troy ounce, while minted gold bullion (and other precious metals) is highly valued in even small amounts, like the [[American Gold Eagle]] coins.

For these reasons, junk silver is popular among [[survivalism|survivalists]]. In the event of a crisis or catastrophe during which traditional currency collapses, it is speculated that silver coins could provide a viable alternative, temporarily or indefinitely, while [[fiat currency]], which is not backed by precious metals or other commodities, has no inherent value and can be subject to extreme [[inflation]], even [[hyperinflation]], similar to [[Weimar Germany]], post-WWII [[Hungarian pengő#Hyperinflation|Hungary]] and, more recently, [[Zimbabwe]] and [[Venezuela]]. Proponents of junk silver and other precious metals claim that, while fiat currencies have historically been subject to hyperinflation, precious metals will always have inherent value and can act as a medium of financial exchange when fiat currencies are obsolete.

==Junk copper==
Some coin collectors and investors are also informally using the term "junk copper" to refer to any [[copper]]-bullion coins of no numismatic value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Junk Copper Coins|url=http://junkcoppercoins.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent examples include U.S. pennies minted before 1982 (partial), [[Canadian penny|Canadian pennies]] minted before 1997, and some pre-euro copper European coins. 154 junk-copper U.S. pennies contain a full pound of .950 fine copper.

}}'''Kadaru''' (also Kadaro, Kadero, Kaderu, Kodhin, Kodhinniai, Kodoro, Tamya) is a [[Hill Nubian]] language spoken in the northern [[Nuba Mountains]] in the south of [[Sudan]]. It is spoken by around 25,000 people in the Jibaal as-Sitta hills, between Dilling and Delami. It is closely related to [[Ghulfan language|Ghulfan]], with which it forms the Kadaru-Ghulfan subgroup of Hill Nubian.

== Dialects ==
''Ethnologue'' reports that there are six dialects spoken by six clan groups living on six separate hills: Kadaru (Kodur), Kururu (Tagle), Kafir (Ka’e), Kurtala (Ngokra), Dabatna (Kaaral) and Kuldaji (Kendal). The Western form used by the Berko people at Habila (southwest of Jebel Sitta, neighbouring the Ghulfan) may be another dialect or a separate language.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The '''Karbi language''' ({{IPAc-en|US|audio=Pronunciation of a Karbi-language word "Karbi".wav|k|ɑː|r|b|i}}), also known as '''Mikir''' or '''Arleng''', is spoken by the [[Karbi people|Karbi, Mikir]], or Arleng people of north-eastern India and north-eastern Bangladesh. It belongs to the [[Sino-Tibetan languages|Sino-Tibetan language family]], but its position is unclear. Shafer (1974) and Bradley (1997) classify the Mikir languages as an aberrant [[Kuki-Chin languages|Kuki-Chin]] branch, but Thurgood (2003) leaves them unclassified within Sino-Tibetan. [[Roger Blench|Blench]] and Post (2013) classify it as one of the most basal languages of the entire family.

There is little dialect diversity except for the [[Amri language|Dumurali or Kamrup Karbi]] dialect, which is distinct enough to be considered a separate Karbi language.

==Varieties==
Konnerth (2014) identifies two main Karbi varieties.

*'''Hills Karbi''': Rongkhang or Ronghang dialect of [[Karbi Anglong district]], [[Assam]]
*'''Plains Karbi''' (￼￼  Dumra [[Amri language|Karbi]]): spoken in [[Kamrup district]] and [[Marigaon district]], Assam, and in [[Ri-Bhoi district]], [[Meghalaya]].

==Geographical distribution==
Karbi is spoken in the following areas of Northeast India (''Ethnologue'').

*[[Assam]]:
**[[Darrang district]]
**[[Dima Hasao district]] (formerly North Cachar district)
**[[East Kamrup district]]
**[[Kamrup Metropolitan (Guwahati) district|Kamrup Metropolitan district]]
**[[Karbi Anglong district]]
**[[Lakhimpur district]]
**[[Marigaon district]]
**[[Nagaon district]]
**[[Sonitpur district]]
**[[South Kamrup district]]
**[[West Karbi Anglong district]]
*[[Arunachal Pradesh]]:
**[[Papum Pare district]] (Balijan circle)
*[[Meghalaya]]:
**[[Jaintia Hills district]]
**[[Ri-Bhoi district]]
*[[Nagaland]]:
**foothills around [[Dimapur]]

==History==
Like most languages of North East India, Karbi writing system is based on Roman script, occasionally in [[Assamese script]]. The earliest written texts in Karbi were produced by Christian missionaries, especially by the American Baptist Mission and the Catholic Church. The missionaries brought out a newspaper in Karbi titled '''Birta''' as early as 1903. Rev. R.E. Neighbor's ''Vocabulary of English and Mikir, with Illustrative Sentences'' published in 1878, which can be called the ‘first’ Karbi ‘dictionary’, Sardoka Perrin Kay's ''English–Mikir Dictionary'' published in 1904, Sir Charles Lyall and Edward Stack's ''The Mikirs'' in 1908, the first ethnographic details on the Karbis and G.D. Walker's ''A Dictionary of the Mikir Language'' published in 1925 are some of the earliest important books on the Karbis and the Karbi language and grammar.&lt;ref&gt;[http://karbi.wordpress.com/category/criticism/ Karbis Of Assam]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Karbis have a rich oral tradition. The ''Mosera'' (recalling the past), a lengthy folk narrative that describes the origin and migration ordeal of the Karbis, is one such example.

The '''Kunama languages''' are a family of languages traditionally considered dialects of a single language, spoken in western [[Eritrea]] and across the border in [[Ethiopia]]. They are included as a branch of the [[Nilo-Saharan language family]]. The languages are [[Kunama language|Kunama proper]], [[Bitama language|Bitama]] and [[Ilit language|Ilit]]. They may be most closely related to the [[Maban languages]] spoken in eastern [[Chad]] (Starostin 2016).

'''Lord''' is an appellation for a person or [[deity]] who has [[authority]], control, or [[power (social and political)|power]] over others acting like a master, a chief, or a [[Ruler (potentate)|ruler]].&lt;ref&gt;Definition expands on: "lord" Dictionary.com Unabridged. Random House, Inc. 28 Dec. 2011. &lt;Dictionary.com http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/lord&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"This word means in general one with power and authority, a master or ruler...The word is used for anyone whom it was desired to address deferentially" Cruden's Complete Concordance to the Bible, revised edition, 1992, "Lord", p.390&lt;/ref&gt; The appellation can also denote certain persons who hold a title of the [[peerage]] in the United Kingdom, or are entitled to [[courtesy title]]s. The collective "Lords" can refer to a group or body of [[Peerages in the United Kingdom|peer]]s.

==Etymology==
[[File:Beowulf - hlaford.jpg|thumb|The Old English word 'hlaford' evolved into 'lord']]
According to the [[Oxford Dictionary of English]], the [[etymology]] of the word can be traced back to the [[Old English language|Old English]] word ''hlāford'' which originated from ''hlāfweard'' meaning "loaf-ward" or "bread keeper", reflecting the [[Germanic tribes|Germanic]] tribal custom of a [[Germanic chieftain|chieftain]] providing food for his followers.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary Second Edition (Revised 2005), p.1036&lt;/ref&gt; The appellation "lord" is primarily applied to men, while for women the appellation "[[lady]]" is used.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} However, this is no longer universal: the [[Lord of Mann]], a title currently held by [[Elizabeth II|the Queen of the United Kingdom]], and female [[Lord Mayor]]s are examples of women who are styled Lord.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

==Historical usage==

===Feudalism===
{{main|Feudalism|English Feudal Baronies}}
Under the [[feudalism|feudal system]], "lord" had a wide, loose and varied meaning. An '''overlord''' was a person from whom a landholding or a manor was held by a [[mesne lord]] or [[vassal]] under various forms of [[feudal land tenure]]. The modern term "[[landlord]]" is a vestigial survival of this function. A [[liege lord]] was a person to whom a vassal owed sworn allegiance. Neither of these terms were titular dignities, but rather factual appellations, which described the relationship between two or more persons within the highly stratified feudal social system. For example, a man might be Lord of the Manor to his own tenants but also a vassal of his own overlord, who in turn was a vassal of the King. Where a knight was a lord of the manor, he was referred to in contemporary documents as "John (Surname), knight, lord of (manor name)". A [[English feudal barony|feudal baron]] was a true titular dignity, with the right to attend Parliament, but a feudal baron, Lord of the Manor of many manors, was a vassal of the King.

===Lord of the manor===
{{See also|Lord of the manor}}
The substantive title of "Lord of the Manor" came into use in the English medieval system of [[feudalism]] after the [[Norman Conquest]] of 1066. The title "Lord of the Manor" was a titular [[Feudalism|feudal]] dignity which derived its force from the existence and operation of a [[manorial court]] or [[court baron]] at which he or his steward presided. To the tenants of a [[manor]] their lord was a man who commanded on occasion the power of exercising [[capital punishment]] over them. The term invariably used in contemporary mediaeval documents is simply "lord of X", X being the name of the manor. The term "Lord of the Manor" is a recent usage of historians to distinguish such lords from [[English feudal barony|feudal barons]] and other powerful persons referred to in ancient documents variously as "Sire" (mediaeval French), "Dominus" (Latin), "Lord" etc. The title of "Lord of the Manor" is recognised by the British Government, in the form of [[HM Land Registry|Her Majesty's Land Registry]], as one of three elements of a [[manor]] that can affect{{clarify|date=March 2014}} Land Registry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.landregistry.gov.uk/professional/guides/practice-guide-22|title=Manors: manorial titles and rights (PG22) - Publications - GOV.UK|website=www.landregistry.gov.uk|access-date=2016-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern legal cases have been won by persons claiming rights as lords of the manor over [[village green]]s. The heads of many ancient English land-owning families have continued to be lords of the manor of lands they have inherited. 

The UK Identity and Passport Service will include such titles on a British passport as an "observation" (e.g., 'The Holder is the Lord of the Manor of X'), provided the holder can provide documentary evidence of ownership,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/publications/agencies-public-bodies/ips/passports-policy-publications/observations-passports?view=Binary|title=Observations in passports - Publications - GOV.UK|website=www.homeoffice.gov.uk|access-date=2016-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; as will Passport Canada. The United States &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/documents/organization/94676.pdf ]{{dead link|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, forbids the use of all titles on passports.  Australia forbids the use of titles on passports if those titles have not been awarded by the Crown (in reference to the Australian Monarchy) or the Commonwealth (in reference to the Australian Government).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/F2013L00440/Explanatory%20Statement/Text|title=Australian Passports Amendment Determination 2013 (No. 1)|last=|first=|date=|website=Federal Register of Legislation|publisher=Australian Government|access-date=23 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Laird===
{{See also|Laird}}
The Scottish title Laird is a shortened form of 'laverd' which is an old Scottish word deriving from an Anglo-Saxon term meaning 'Lord' and is also derived from the middle English word 'Lard' also meaning 'Lord'.  The word is generally used to refer to any owner of a landed estate and has no meaning in heraldic terms and its use is not controlled by the Lord Lyon.

==Modern usage==

===Peerage===
{{Main|Peerage of the United Kingdom}}
''Lord'' is used as a generic term to denote members of the [[peerage]]. Five ranks of [[peerage|peer]] exist in the United Kingdom: in descending order these are [[duke]], [[marquess]], [[earl]], [[viscount]], and [[baron]]. The appellation "Lord" is used most often by barons, who are rarely addressed by their formal and legal title of "Baron". The correct style is 'The Lord (X)': for example, [[Alfred Tennyson|Alfred Tennyson, 1st Baron Tennyson]], is commonly known as "The Lord Tennyson". Marquesses, earls and viscounts are commonly also addressed as Lord. Dukes use the style "The Duke of (X)", and are not correctly referred to as 'Lord (X)'. Dukes are formally addressed as 'Your Grace', rather than 'My Lord'. In the [[Peerage of Scotland]], the members of the lowest level of the peerage have the substantive title '[[Lord of Parliament]]' rather than Baron.

"Lord" is also used as a [[courtesy title]] for some or all of the children of senior members of the peerage: for example the younger sons of dukes and marquesses are entitled to use the style "Lord (first name) (surname)". As these titles are merely courtesy titles, the holder is not by virtue of the title a member of the peerage and is not entitled to use the definite article 'The' as part of the title. Sons of [[British Prince]]s, would also use a similar style if the holder doesn't have a peerage.

===House of Lords===
{{See also|House of Lords}}
The upper house of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] is the [[House of Lords]], which is an abbreviation of the full title, The Right Honourable the Lords Spiritual and Temporal in Parliament Assembled. The Lords Temporal are the people who are entitled to receive [[Hereditary peer#Writs of summons|writs of summons]] to attend the House of Lords in right of a peerage. The Lords Spiritual are the Archbishops of Canterbury and York, the Bishops of London, Winchester and Durham, and the twenty-one longest-serving bishops of the Church of England from among the other bishops, who are all entitled to receive writs of summons in right of their bishoprics or archbishoprics. 

The Lords Temporal greatly outnumber the Lords Spiritual, there being nearly 800 of the former and only 26 of the latter. As of December 2016, 92 Lords Temporal sit in the House in right of hereditary peerages and 19 sit in right of judicial life peerages under the [[Appellate Jurisdiction Act 1876]]. The rest are life peers under the [[Life Peerages Act 1958]].

===Judiciary===
{{See also|Judiciary of the United Kingdom}}
[[File:Charles Pepys, 1st Earl of Cottenham by Charles Robert Leslie cropped.jpg|thumb|[[Charles Pepys, 1st Earl of Cottenham]], a [[Lord Chancellor]] of the United Kingdom]]
Until the creation of the [[Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]] (early 21st century), certain [[judge]]s  sat in the House of Lords by virtue of holding life peerages. They were known collectively as the [[Law Lords]]. Those Law Lords who had held the office of [[Justice of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom]] lost the right to sit and vote in the House of Lords, despite retaining their life peerages, upon creation of the Supreme Court. The appellation "Lord" is also used to refer to some judges in certain [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] legal systems, who are not peers. Some such judges, for instance judges of the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales]], are called "Lord Justice". Other Commonwealth judges, for example judges of Canadian provincial supreme courts, are known only as Justices but are addressed with deference in court as 'My Lord', 'My Lady', 'Your Lordship' or 'Your Ladyship'.

Examples of judges who use the appellation "lord" include:
* Justices of the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom not holding peerages, who are addressed as if they were life peers by [[Warrant (law)|Royal Warrant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.supremecourt.uk/docs/pr_1013.pdf|title=Press Notice: Courtesy titles for Justices of the Supreme Court|last=|first=|date=13 December 2010|website=www.supremecourt.uk|publisher=The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom|access-date=23 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wives of male justices who are not peers are addressed as if they were wives of peers. These forms of address are applicable both in court and in social contexts.
* Judges of the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales]], known as 'Lord Justices of Appeal'.
* Judges of the Scottish [[Court of Session]], known as 'Lords of Council and Session'.
* Justices of the Canadian provincial Supreme Courts, addressed in Court as "My Lord" or "My Lady" and referred to in legal literature as "Lordships" or "Ladyships".
* Judges of the [[Supreme Court of India]] and the [[High Courts of India]], who are addressed as "My Lord" in court. The [[Bar Council of India]] however calls upon lawyers to give up this practice of addressing judges as 'lords'.

===Ecclesiastical===
In [[Great Britain]] and [[Ireland]], and in most countries that are members or former members of the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]], bishops may be addressed as "My Lord" or "My Lord Bishop" or "Your Lordship", particularly on formal occasions.  This usage is not restricted to those bishops who sit in the [[House of Lords]].  Indeed, by custom, it is not restricted to bishops of the [[Church of England]] but applies to bishops of the [[Church in Wales]], the [[Scottish Episcopal Church]] and the Roman Catholic Church, and may be applied (though less commonly) to bishops of other Christian jurisdictions.   However, in modern times, it has become more common to use simply the one word "Bishop".    

In the United States, bishops are addressed as "Excellency".

===Other===
Various other high offices of state in the United Kingdom, Commonwealth and Republic of Ireland are prefixed with the deferential appellation of "lord" such as [[Lord Chancellor]], [[Lord Privy Seal]], [[Lord President of the Council]] and [[Lord Mayor]]. Holders of these offices are not ''[[ex officio]]''  peers, although the holders of some of the offices were in the past always peers.

==Non-English equivalents==
In most cultures in Europe an equivalent appellation denoting deference exists. The French term ''[[Monseigneur|Mon Seigneur]]'' ("My Lord"), shortened to the modern French ''Monsieur'' derives directly from the [[Latin]] ''seniorem'', meaning "elder, senior".&lt;ref&gt;Larousse Dictionnaire de la Langue Francaise, Paris, 1979, p.1713&lt;/ref&gt; From this Latin source derived directly also the Italian ''Signore'', the Spanish ''Señor'', the Portuguese ''[[Senhor]]''.

Non-[[Romance languages]] have their own equivalents.  Of the Germanic family there is the [[Dutch language|Dutch]] ''Meneer/Mijnheer/De Heer'' (as in: ''aan de heer Joren Jansen''), German ''Herr'', and Danish ''Herre''.  All three of these stem from a Germanic title of respect (in this case, from the [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] root ''[[wikt:Reconstruction:Proto-Germanic/hairaz|*haira-]]'', "hoary, venerable, grey", likely a loan translation of Latin ''seniorem'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://etymonline.com/index.php?term=hoar&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|website=etymonline.com|access-date=2016-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
In other European languages there is [[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''Arglwydd'', [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] ''Úr'', Greek ''[[Kyrie]]'', [[Polish language|Polish]] ''Pan'', Czech ''pán'', [[Breton language|Breton]] ''Aotrou'', [[Albanian language|Albanian]] ''Zoti''.

In several Indian languages there are have: [[Hindi language|Hindi]] ''Swami'', ''Prabhu'', ''Samprabhu''(Overlord) also words like ''Saheb'' or ''Laat Saheb'' from ''Lord Saheb'' were once used but have changed in meaning now, [[Telugu language|Telugu]] ''Prabhuvu'', [[Tamil language|Tamil]] ''Koman'', [[Kannada]] ''Dore'', [[Bengali language|Bengali]] ''Probhu'', [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]] ''Swami'', [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] ''Su'āmī'', [[Nepali language|Nepali]] ''Prabhu''. Words like ''Swami'' and ''Prabhu'' are [[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]]-origin words, common in many Indian languages.

[[Languages of the Philippines|Philippine languages]] have different words for "lord", some of which are cognates. [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] has ''Panginoón'' for "lord" in both the noble and the religious senses. Its root, ''ginoo'', is also found in [[Visayan languages]] like [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]] as the term for "lord". ''Ginoo'' is also the Tagalog root for ''Ginoóng'', the modern equivalent of the English term "[[Mr|Mister]]" (akin to how Romance language terms like ''señor'' may be glossed as either "lord", "mister", or "sir"). [[Ilocano language|Ilocano]] meanwhile employs ''[[Ilokano particles#apo|Apo]]'' for "Lord" in religious contexts; it is a [[Grammatical particle|particle]] that generally accords respect to an addressee of higher status than the speaker.

==Religion&lt;!--[[The LORD]] redirects here --&gt;==
{{unreferenced section |date=September 2015}}
"Lord" is used as a title of [[deference]] for various gods or deities. The earliest recorded use of "Lord" in the English language in a religious context was by English Bible translators such as [[Bede]]. However, Bede wrote in Latin, and was described by Michael Lapidge as "without question the most accomplished Latinist produced in these islands in the Anglo-Saxon period". He used an Anglo-Saxon phrase that indicated a noble, prince, ruler or lord to refer to God; however, he applied this as a gloss to the Latin text that he was producing, and not as a clear translation of the term itself. "Lord", as a gloss to Old English {{lang|ang|dryhten}}, meant royal, ruler, prince, noble, and did not indicate a deity. After the Norman invasion and the influx of French Catholics, this understanding began to be applied to religious texts as well, but that was during the later Middle Ages and not the early medieval period of Bede's time. It was widely used in the [[King James Bible]] translated in the 17th century. See also [[Jesus is Lord]].
* In English language Old Testament translations such as the [[King James Version]], the [[Hebrew]] name [[Yahweh|YHWH]] (the [[Tetragrammaton]]) is usually rendered "the {{LORD}}". This usage follows the [[Jewish]] practice of substituting the spoken Hebrew word "[[Adonai]]" ("My Lords") for appearances of YHWH.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=NASB |year=1995 |title=Preface to the New American Standard Bible |work=[[New American Standard Bible]] (Updated Edition) |location=Anaheim, California |publisher=Foundation Publications (for the [[Lockman Foundation]]) |url=http://www.bible-researcher.com/nasb-preface.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061207004013/http://www.bible-researcher.com/nasb-preface.html |archivedate=2006-12-07 |deadurl=yes |quote=One of the titles for God is Lord, a translation of Adonai. There is yet another name which is particularly assigned to God as His special or proper name, that is, the four letters YHWH (Exodus 3:14 and Isaiah 42:8). This name has not been pronounced by the Jews because of reverence for the great sacredness of the divine name. Therefore, it has been consistently translated LORD. The only exception to this translation of YHWH is when it occurs in immediate proximity to the word Lord, that is, Adonai. In that case it is regularly translated GOD in order to avoid confusion. |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Christianity]]: [[Jesus]] is [[Jesus is Lord|called "Lord"]] in the [[New Testament]].
* [[Islam]]: The English term "Lord" is often used to translate the Arabic term ''[[rabb]]'' ({{lang-ar|رب}}), used with respect to [[Allah]]  ({{lang-ar|الله}}).
* [[Hinduism]]: In [[Hindu theology]], the [[Svayam Bhagavan]] may refer to the concept of the [[Absolute (philosophy)|Absolute]] representation of the monotheistic God. Another name more commonly used in Hindu theology is [[Ishvara]], meaning "The Lord", the [[personal god]] consisting of the trinity of [[Brahma]], [[Vishnu]], and [[Shiva]].
* [[Ancient Semitic religion|Semitic religions]]: Other deities given corresponding appellations to "Lord" include:
** [[Baʿal]] ("Lord") was used by the [[Canaanites]] both as a generic term of address to various local deities and as the spoken name for the [[storm god]] [[Baʿal Haddu]] once the form "Hadad" became too sacred for any but his high priest to utter.
** Similarly, [[Tammuz (god)|Tammuz]] came to be addressed as "Adoni" ("My Lord").
** [[EN (cuneiform)|En]] meaning "Lord" as in Sumerian deities [[Enki]] and [[Enlil]].
* [[Buddhism]]: [[Gautama Buddha]] is often called Lord Buddha.{{cn|date=January 2017}} 
* [[Jainism]]: "Lord" refers to the [[Mahavira]].
* [[Nahuatl]]: the word "Ahau" is translated as "Lord" in reference to [[Aztec]] deities.
* [[Ancient Greek religion|Greece]]: [[Adonis]] was a form of the Semitic Adoni.
* [[Norse religion|Old Norse]]: The names [[Freyr]] and [[Freya]] have the meaning Lord and Lady.
* [[Wicca]]:  the Wiccan God is often referred to as "The Lord" and the Wiccan Goddess as "The Lady", or in the combination "Lord and Lady" (in this form, the definite article "[[the]]" is usually omitted), usually in reference to a mythological pairing such as [[Cernunos]] and [[Cerridwen]].
* [[Mormonism]]: it is believed that [[Jesus]] was the YHVH ([[Jehovah]]) of the [[Old Testament]] in his pre-mortal existence, and since that name is translated as "the Lord" in the [[King James Bible]], in Mormonism "the Lord" refers to Jesus. [[Elohim]], a separate individual who is the father of Jesus, is generally referred to by Mormons as "God" or "Heavenly Father". (See [[Mormon cosmology]] for references.)

'''Luoji''' ([[wikt:Autonym|autonym]]: ''luo˧˩dʑi˧''&lt;ref name="Hsiu2013"/&gt;) is a moribund [[Loloish languages|Loloish]] language of [[Weining County]], [[Guizhou]], China that is spoken by the [[Qixingmin people]]. There are a few semi-fluent elderly speakers in Shejie Village 蛇街村, Yangjie Town 羊街镇, Weining County, with no fluent speakers remaining.&lt;ref name="Hsiu2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="msealangs"&gt;Hsiu, Andrew.

Zenodo. {{doi|10.5281/zenodo.1122543}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
The Qixingmin speak a language closely related to the local [[Nasu language|Yi language]], which is intermediate between the Western and Eastern Yi dialects of [[Weining County]] (Weining 1997:328).&lt;ref name="Weining1997"&gt;威宁彜族回族苗族自治县民族事务委员会编. 1997. ''Weining County Ethnic Gazeteer'' [威宁彝族回族苗族自治县民族志]. Guiyang: Guizhou People's Press [贵州民族出版社].&lt;/ref&gt; Some vocabulary items differ, such as the word for 'chili pepper' ({{zh|辣椒}}), which is "zi 自" in the Western Yi dialect, "shapo 傻迫" in the Eastern Yi dialect, and "boji 薄几" in Qixingmin.&lt;ref name="Weining1997"/&gt;

However, the Qixingmin claim that they are distinct from the [[Yi people|Yi]], and that their ancestors spoke a non-Yi language that had become extinct centuries ago.&lt;ref name="Hsiu2013"/&gt;

Qixingmin is geographically located between the Western Yi and Eastern Yi areas. These languages are spoken in:&lt;ref name="Weining1997"/&gt;
*''Qixingmin'' ("Qixingmin Liangzi" 七姓民梁子): Xiangshui 响水, Jinhai 金海, Sandaohe 三道河, Shejie 蛇街, Yangjie 羊街, and Yanjia 严家
*''Western Yi'': Guanfenghai 观风海, Niupeng 牛棚, Dajie 大街, and Longjie 龙街
*''Eastern Yi'': Yancang 盐仓, Jinzhong 金钟, and Ertang 二塘

'''Moling of Luachair''', [[Irish people|Irish]] [[cleric]] and [[poet]], fl. 695.

The [[Annals of Tigernach]] relate that upon the death of King [[Fínsnechta Fledach]] mac Dúnchada, ''Mo Ling Luachra do-rigni in rand-so ar Fínachta''/''[[Moling]] of Luachair made this [[verse (poetry)|stave]] on Finachta:'':
{{Verse translation|
{{lang|ga|Ba dirsan do Finachta,
indíu laighidh crolighe.
ro m-be la firu nime
im dilgud na boraime.}}
|
Twas sad for Finachta!
Today he lies on a gory bed
May he be with the men of heaven
For forgiving the tribute.}}

To this, [[Adomnán]] of [[Iona]] responded:
{{Verse translation|
{{lang|ga|Finachta mac Dunchada
ro maith mor don naem,
tri cóecait cét bo-slabraidh,
is gach bó cona laegh.}}
|
Finachta son of Dunchadh
Remitted much to the saint
A hundred and fifty hundreds of [[dower]]-[[Cattle|kine]]
And every cow with her calf.}}

This in turn generated a final verse from Moling:
{{Verse translation|
{{lang|ga|IN bernn forsm-bith Finachta
imó-reithdis rig riadhai
ed co n-dothchernsa dochuill
atas-rolaicc nis-ríadha.}}
|
The gap whereon Finachta was slain
imó-reithdis rig riadhai
Round which kings
Would run before his spear.}}

'''No goal''' is a call made by [[referee]]s in various [[Goal (sport)|goal]]-scoring sports ([[soccer|football]], [[hockey]], [[lacrosse]], etc.) to indicate that a goal has not been scored. It is commonly used to disallow an apparent goal, such as when the ball or puck has entered the net but should not count as a score due to some foul or infraction.

Because the decision often depends on a subjective assessment by the referee, and especially if the score might be critical, such calls can be hotly contested. For fans of one of the teams involved, it may thus refer to a goal that was actually disallowed, or one that in their opinion should have been disallowed, but was not. As a result, in recent years most professional sports leagues have implicated protocol allowing for such calls to be subject to video review or to be reviewed because of a [[coach's challenge]].

== National Hockey League (NHL) ==
In the [[NHL]] a goal may be called a no goal for the following reasons: 
# When the puck has been directed, batted or thrown into the net by an attacking player other than with a stick.
# (ii)  When the puck has been kicked using a distinct kicking motion.
# (iii)  When the puck has deflected directly into the net off an official.
# (iv)  When a goal has been scored and an ineligible player is on the ice.
# (v)  When an attacking player has interfered with a goalkeeper in his goal crease.
# (vi)  When the puck has entered the net after making contact with an attacking player’s stick that is above the height of the crossbar. Where the puck makes contact with the stick is the determining factor. See 38.4(vi).
# (vii)  When video review confirms the scoring of a goal at one end of the ice, any goal scored at the other end on the same play must be disallowed.
# (viii)  When a Linesman reports a double-minor penalty for high-sticking, a major penalty or a match penalty to the Referee following the scoring of a goal by the offending team, the goal must be disallowed and the appropriate penalty assessed.
# (ix)  When a goalkeeper has been pushed into the net together with the puck after making a save. See also 69.6.
# (x)  When the net becomes displaced accidentally. The goal frame is considered to be displaced if either or both goal pegs are no longer in their respective holes in the ice, or the net has come completely off one or both pegs, prior to or as the puck enters the goal.
# (xi)  During the delayed calling of a penalty, the offending team cannot score unless the non-offending team shoots the puck into their own net. This shall mean that a deflection off an offending player or any physical action by an offending player that may cause the puck to enter the non-offending team’s goal, shall not be considered a legal goal. Play shall be stopped before the puck enters the net (whenever possible) and the signaled penalty assessed to the offending team.
# (xii)  When the Referee deems the play has been stopped, even if he had not physically had the opportunity to stop play by blowing his whistle.
# (xiii) Any goal scored, other than as covered by the official rules, shall not be allowed.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nhl.com/nhl/en/v3/ext/rules/2014-2015-rulebook.pdf|title=NHL Rulebook Rule 78.5|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== National Lacrosse League (NLL) ==
According to the [[National Lacrosse League|NLL]] rulebook (Rule 55: No Goal) a goal may be disallowed under the following conditions:

# (55.1) When the ball passes through the plane of the net after the game clock’s horn or shot clock has sounded to indicate the end of a quarter or overtime period or expiration of the shot clock.
# (55.2) A crease violation will result in a no goal. Crease violation is rule 69.
# (55.3) When the ball passes through the plane of the goal when the attacking team has too many players on the floor including those in the penalty box at the time of the play.
# (55.4) When the ball passes through the plane of the goal after one of the officials has sounded his whistle for any reason, including the sounding of an inadvertent whistle.
# (55.5) When the player makes contact with the goalie. See Contact While Shooting on Net Rule 69.
# (55.6)  When the ball passes through the plane of the goal from a stick that is found to be illegal by a stick check.
# (55.7)  When the ball is kicked in a kicking motion directly or indirectly into the opponent’s goal.
# (55.8)  When the ball is directed into the net off the free hand of an opponent.
# (55.9)  When a ball is lodged, or not, in the throat of the pocket and the ball and stick is inadvertently or deliberately tossed into the goal.
# (55.10) In the event that a goalkeeper has been pushed into the net by his teammate on his own accord and the ball crosses the goal line after making the stop, the goal will be allowed. In the event that a goalkeeper has been pushed into the net by an opponent and the ball crosses the goal line after making the stop, the goal will be disallowed. The plays are subject to any appropriate penalties.
# (55.11) If the ball is loose in the crease an opposing  player may not direct the ball into the goal. If the ball is loose in the crease, an opposing player must have possession prior to any scoring attempt. A no goal shall be called if the ball is loose in the crease, directed by an opposing player and having the ball make contact with the goalie or a defender prior to the ball going into the net.
# (55.12) If a goal is scored when an ineligible player is on the floor, the goal will be disallowed. The ineligible player will be removed from the game and the club shall not be able to substitute another player on its roster. An ineligible player is a player who had been previously ejected from the game, and subject to league discipline.
# (55.13) If a goal is scored when the attackers’ stick head is behind the goal line extended when releasing the ball during the act of shooting, the goal will be disallowed.
# (55.14) If a player takes a shot and the head of his stick comes off and the ball enters the goal, the goal would be disallowed and the ball awarded to the goalie.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://s3.amazonaws.com/nllassets/2016+NLL+Rulebook.pdf|title=NLL Rulebook Rule 55|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Official mail''' is [[mail]] sent from, or by, an authorized department of government, governmental agency or international organization&lt;ref name="hornung"&gt;Horning (1970), pp. 97–98&lt;/ref&gt; and normally has some indication that it is official; a certifying [[cachet]], [[return address]] or other means of identity, indicating its user. In some countries, [[postage stamp]]s have been issued specifically for official mail.

Official stamps were intended for the same purpose as regular postage stamps except that they were unavailable for purchase at post offices. While most stamps are denominated some have [[Non-denominated postage|no value imprint]].&lt;ref name="hornung"/&gt;

==History==

Some of the earliest official mail were the messages sent by kings, emperors and other rulers. The [[Cursus publicus]] was the official  mail courier (and transportation) system created by the [[Roman Empire|Roman Emperor]], [[Augustus]]. Much later, one of the functions of the [[Thurn-und-Taxis-Post]] postal system was to carry the mail of [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Maximilan I]] in the [[Holy Roman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Hornung (1970), pp. 16, 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ireland-1979 President's mail.jpeg|thumb|Official mail from the [[President of Ireland]] ([[Patrick Hillery]]) with the oval certifying handstamp ''Uaċtarán na hÉireann'' used in 1979 in addition to the pre-printed harp indicia envelope]]
Official mail stamps are related to the end of [[franking privilege]] that granted certain elected officials of a government the privilege to send mail for free. The person usually signed their name on the mail but it was a highly abused system. In the UK the rules were changed requiring the sender to indicate the date and place of mailing in addition to their signature, but this too was abused and this led, in part, to the introduction of postage stamps.&lt;ref name="pastimes"&gt;{{cite web | last = Healey | first = Barth | title = PASTIMES: Stamps | publisher = [[New York Times]] | date = 1999-10-01 | url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE6D71731F932A35753C1A96F948260  | accessdate = 2008-02-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most governments use envelopes with an indicia indicating its official status; the United Kingdom's official mail most often shows, O.H.M.S. or On His/Her Majesty's Service, the United States uses the silhouette of an eagle, [[Ethiopia]] shows a hand holding a cleft stick with a letter is wedged into it,&lt;ref name="pastimes"/&gt; while [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] uses a harp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = ABCs of Irish Philately - Official Mail | publisher = Éire Philatelic Association | date = 2005-12-11 | url = http://eirephilatelicassoc.org/abcs/abc_official.html | accessdate = 2008-02-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[American Civil War|civil war]], the [[United States Post Office Department]] had a large deficit and according to the [[United States Postmaster General|Postmaster General]]'s 1869 report 31,933 had the franking privilege at an estimated cost of $5 million,&lt;ref name="linns1"&gt;{{cite web | last =Wunderly | first =Kathleen | title =U.S. Official Mail stamps: officially gone? | work =Refresher Course | publisher =[[Linn's Stamp News]] | url =http://www.linns.com/howto/refresher/officialmail_20011022/refreshercourse.asp?uID= | accessdate =2007-05-14 | deadurl =yes | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20070420214414/http://www.linns.com/howto/refresher/officialmail_20011022/refreshercourse.asp?uID= | archivedate =2007-04-20 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; so in 1872 the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican party]] included a proposal to eliminate the free frank as part of their election platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Woolley,  John T. &amp; Peters, Gerhard (University of California at Santa Barbara) | title =Republican Party Platform of 1872 | work =Republican Party Platforms | publisher =The American Presidency Project (online) | url =http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/print.php?pid=29623 | accessdate =2007-05-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1873 and 1891 there was no free franking in the USA because special official mail stamps had been issued, but by 1891 free franking had been restored.&lt;ref name="linns1"/&gt;

=== In Great Britain ===
The first official mail postage stamp, known as the [[VR official]], was issued by the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] at the same time as the [[Penny Black]] and [[Two pence blue]]. The VR Official utilised the same design as the Penny Black except that the stars in the top corners were removed and replaced by the letters V and R that gives the stamp its common name. On May 7, 1840, W.L. Maberly, Secretary to the [[Royal Mail|British post office]], sent a notice to all postmasters to which was affixed a pair of VR specimens as well as a pair of two penny blues. The notice charged the postmasters to note the letters in the upper corners of the stamp that was to be: ''applied to the correspondence of Public Departments, and other Persons formerly enjoying the privilege of Official Franking.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Feldman | first = David | authorlink = David Feldman (philatelist) | title = All World Stamps and Postal History Auction Catalogue | publisher = David Feldman SA | date = 1997-11-20 | location = Geneva | pages = 15, 330 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In the United States ===
Legislation passed by the United States Congress on March 3, 1873 stated that: "the Postmaster General shall cause to be prepared a special stamp or stamped envelope, to be used only for official mail matter for each of the executive departments",&lt;ref name="linns1"/&gt; to this end, the official stamps were issued on July 1, 1873 for the Executive Branch and the departments of ''Agriculture'', the ''Interior'', ''Justice'', ''Navy'', ''Post Office'', ''Treasury'' and ''War'' following the ending of the franking privilege though the stamps were only in use for seven years mainly due to the need for departmental postage accountability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Eleven Major Types of U.S. Stamps  | publisher = [[Mystic Stamp Company]] | url = http://www.mysticstamp.com/content.asp?contentID=89 | accessdate = 2008-02-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Post Office also printed official [[Postal stationery|stamped envelopes]] for their own use.&lt;ref name="linns1"/&gt;

In March 1877 the stamps became unnecessary, because a congressional act permitted government departments to provide their own envelopes endorsed "Official Business". Private use of the envelopes had a fine of $300. The official stamps were officially discontinued June 30, 1879, but they were in use until they were exhausted. The stamps and envelopes were finally abolished on July 5, 1884, however, for a four-year period between 1910–1914 official stamps were used for the postal savings program.&lt;ref name="linns1"/&gt;

The first US stamps to have the words "Official Mail" printed on them were issued on January 12, 1983 when the departmental postage accountability again became a concern. The [[Great Seal of the United States]] became the central design on these 20¢ stamps and envelopes. A 32¢ stamp and envelope superseded the 20¢ issue in 1995.&lt;ref name="linns1"/&gt;

=== Elsewhere ===
Several countries, such as, Australia, Canada, New South Wales, New Zealand and Niue, have issued official stamps that can often be identified because they bear the words like, "official," "service," "dienstmark," or the initials "O.S." (Official service) or OHMS (On Her/His Majesty's Service) in the design, as an [[overprint]], or a [[perfin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | last =Klug  | first =Janet | title =Back-of-the-book: special-purpose stamps  | work =Refresher Course  | publisher =[[Linn's Stamp News]] | url =http://www.linns.com/howto/refresher/backofbook_20020204/refreshercourse.asp?uID= | accessdate =2007-12-21  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even Tibet had official postage stamps around 1950.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Warren | first =Alan | title =The "Officials" of Tibet | work = | publisher =Western Philatelic Library | url =http://www.fwpl.org/tibetoff.htm | accessdate =2007-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Open Discourse''' is a [[Technical terminology|technical term]] used in [[discourse analysis]] and [[Sociolinguistics]] and is commonly contrasted with ''Closed Discourse''. The concept of open and closed discourse is associated with the overlay of open and closed [[discourse community|discourse communities]] and open and closed communication events. Keys to determining whether a discourse is open or closed include [[Information access|access to information]], [[Equity theory|equity]] of access, [[Open access (publishing)|open access]], quality of discourse and mechanisms and modalities of discourse control: overt, covert, implicit and incidental. As a conceptual filter and cultural construct, [[ideology]] is a function and mechanism of discourse control. [[Channel (communications)|Channel]] and [[Signal (electronics)|signal]] of a communication event and [[Register (sociolinguistics)|register]] of communication together control discourse and therefore, determine the degree of [[social inclusion]] and [[social exclusion]] and, by extension, the relative efficiency of that communication event. Open and closed discourse operate along a [[continuum (theory)|continuum]] where absolute closure and complete openness are theoretically untenable due to [[Communication noise|noise]] in the channel. The nature of the channel, signal, code, replicability, recording, transmissibility, cataloguing, recall or other variable of a communication event and its information control and context of transmission-as-event, impact its relative position along the continuum between open and closed discourse. In all cases, open discourse is assumed to be sustained discourse.

[[Teun A. van Dijk|Van Dijk]] (c.2003: p.&amp;nbsp;357) holds that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Although most discourse control is contextual or global, even local details of meaning, form, or style may be controlled, e.g. the details of an answer in class or court, or choice of lexical items or jargon in courtrooms, classrooms or newsrooms (Martin Rojo 1994).&lt;ref&gt;Van Dijk, Teun A.

==Internet, weblogging and social media==
In regards to the Internet as [[cultural artifact]] and information as [[complex adaptive system]] with [[emergent properties]] of open discourse such as [[Blog|weblogs]] and [[social media]], Boyd (February 2009) holds that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The Web is the most important and valuable human artifact ever created. And, it is not owned by any single group, government, company, or person. It is not patented, no one is in charge, and we have no idea whatsoever as to how much we have invested in it, or even how much it costs us to keep it running.... The Web – and in particular the rise of the so-called blogosphere – has led to a resurgence of open public discourse that is unparalleled since the emergence of independent newspapers and pamphleteers at the outset of the Industrial revolution. The Web has grown from a handful of websites to millions of individuals and organizations publishing on every conceivable topic from every imaginable perspective."&lt;ref&gt;Boyd, Stowe (February 2009).

Source: [http://www.we-magazine.net/we-volume-02/open-social-discourse-and-web-culture/] (accessed: Monday April 12, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Open discourse as open-endedness: text and context as living document==
Open discourse as [[living document]] may also be understood as the open-endedness in both a communication event and the inability to collapse a communication event into definitives, the unequivocal import of a cultural artifact and the associated inability to resolve ambiguity due to noise and ever-changing context and audience, as Graham (2000: p.&amp;nbsp;5) further states:
&lt;blockquote&gt;...I  understand  the  play  on  multiplicity  of  interpretation  and  open‐endedness  that  ambiguity signifies  however,  the  term  ambiguous  is  itself  ambiguous  –  it  not  only  means  “open  to various interpretations” but also “of doubtful and uncertain nature; difficult to understand” and “lacking clearness or definiteness, obscure” (Macquarie Essential Dictionary, 1999: 23).&lt;ref&gt;Graham, Linda J.(2005).

==Medicine, scientific publishing and pharmacology==
Dayton (2006) frames the transition from open access to open discourse in the [[Internet]] discourse community in regards to the parameters of scientific publishing thus:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The [I]nternet is expanding the realm of scientific publishing to include free and open public debate of published papers. Journals are beginning to support web posting of comments on their published articles and independent organizations are providing centralized web sites for posting comments about any published article. The trend promises to give one and all access to read and contribute to cutting edge scientific criticism and debate."

==Urban planning and public discourse==
Ter Borg and Dijking (1995) explore discourse control in relation to [[urban planning]], [[urban development]], [[public participation]] and [[stakeholder engagement]] in their analysis of two [[case studies]].&lt;ref&gt;Elisabeth ter Borg &amp; Gertjan Dijkink (1995). "Naturalising Choices and Neutralising Voices? Discourse on Urban Development in Two Cities." ''Urban Studies'', Vol. 32, No. 1, pp.49-67.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pedagogical discourse==
Dawson &amp; Taylor (1998) have documented experiential learnings of the logistics of open and critical discourse in the discourse community of the science classroom.&lt;ref&gt;Dawson, Vaille M. &amp; Taylor, Peter C. (1998). "Establishing open and critical discourses in the science classroom: Reflecting on initial difficulties."  ''Research in Science Education''. Netherlands: Springer. ISSN 0157-244X (Print) 1573-1898 (Online). Volume 28, Number 3 / September, 1998. Source: [http://www.springerlink.com/content/up681k2252k73r52/] (accessed: Monday April 12, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

In framing the relationship between the discourse community of a classroom and therefore [[pedagogical]] discourse throughout all media and associating open discourse to a democratic ideology Celce-Murcia &amp; Olshtain (2000: p.&amp;nbsp;11) hold that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"...it is important that teachers understand what critical discourse analysis is and that they are at the very least sensitized to the potentially discriminatory and demeaning discourse that may arise in the classroom and in teaching materials and be prepared to deal with it constructively (i.e., to use such instances of discourse as opportunities for discussions and activities that can make the language classroom a more democratic and open discourse community)."&lt;ref&gt;Celce-Murcia, Marianne &amp; Olshtain, Elite (2000).

{{Wiktionarypar|origo}}

In [[pragmatics]], the '''origo''' is the reference point on which [[deixis|deictic]] relationships are based.

In most deictic systems, the origo identifies with the current speaker (or some property thereof). For instance, if the speaker, John, were to say "This is now my fish", then John would be the origo, and the deictic word "my" would be dependent on that fact. Likewise, his use of the word "this" and "now" communicate his properties, namely his [[location (geography)|location]] and point in [[time]]. 

The word origo comes from [[Latin]] ''origo'', which means "origin" (pl. ''origines''). ''Origo'' is also the origin of the English word "origin".

This word also occurs in the term phrase ''[[fons et origo]]'', meaning "source and origin" (''fons'', "source", ''et'', "and", "even").

[[File:Muhammad Salat.svg|160 px|thumb|right|Example of the name ''Muhammad'' with the ''salat'' phrase attached in [[thuluth]] calligraphy.]]
The [[Arabic language|Arabic]] phrase '''''ʿalayhi s-salām''''' ({{lang|ar|عليه السلام}}), which translates as "'''peace be upon him'''" is a conventionally [[veneration of Muhammad|complimentary]] phrase or ''[[durood]]'' attached to the names of the prophets in [[Islam]]. The English phrase is also given the abbreviation PBUH in English-language writing. An extended variant of the phrase reads ''{{transl|ar|DIN|ṣallā Allāhu ʿalayhi wa-ʿala āli-hi wa-sallam}}'' ({{lang-ar|صلى الله عليه وعلى آله وسلم }}) [lit.] "blessings of God be upon him and his family and peace", and it is often abbreviated ''SAW'' or ''SAWS'' in writing, even in English. The Arabic phrase is given the name '''''ṣalawāt'''''. The phrase is encoded as a [[Typographic ligature|ligature]] at [[Unicode]] code point {{unichar|FDFA|ARABIC LIGATURE SALLALLAHOU ALAYHE WASALLAM}}&lt;ref name="unicode"&gt;.{{cite web |url=https://www.unicode.org/charts/PDF/Unicode-3.1/U31-FB50.pdf |title=Arabic Presentation Forms-A |date=2009-10-01 |work=The Unicode Standard, Version 5.2 |publisher=Unicode, Inc. |location=Mountain View, Ca. |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some Islamic scholars have voiced disagreement with the practice of abbreviating these phrases, arguing that it demonstrates laziness and a lack of respect.&lt;ref&gt;Al-Fayrooza-abaadee; ''As-Salaatu wal-Bushr''; (quoted in ''Mu'jam Al-Manaahee Al-Laf-thiyyah'');  p.351. "The Musnad"; Imaam Ahmad; (#5088); 9/105).  From a handwritten answer provided by the shaykh, Wasee Allaah 'Abbaas, file no. AAWA004, dated 1423/6/24&lt;/ref&gt;

== Variants of the phrase in Arabic ==
* "Peace be upon him": ({{lang-ar|عليه السلام}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|ʿalayhi s-salām}}'' – AS): This expression follows after naming any [[prophet]]s, [[Imam]]s ([[Shia]] exclusively), or one of the [[archangel]]s (e.g. [[Gabriel#Islam|Jibreel]] (AS), [[Michael (archangel)#Quran|Mikaeel]] (AS), etc.).
* "May God honor him and grant him peace.": ({{lang|ar|صلى الله عليه وسلم}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN| ṣallā llāhu ʿalayhi wa-sallam}}'' – SAW, SAAW, or SAAS): This expression follows specifically after uttering the name of [[Muhammad]], although "peace be upon him" may be used instead
* "May God grant peace and honor on him and his [[ahl al-bayt|family]].": ({{lang-ar|صلى الله عليه وآله}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN| ṣallā  llahu ʿalayhi wa-ʾāli-h(i)}}'' – SAWW): This expression follows specifically after saying the name of  Muhammad
* "Peace be upon her": ({{lang-ar|سلام الله علیها}} ''{{transl|ar|DIN|salāmu llāh ʿalayhā}}'' – SAA): This expression follows specifically after the name of historical Islamic women, e.g. [[Fatimah|Fatima, daughter of the Prophet]], [[Asiya, wife of the Pharaoh]] and [[Mary in Islam|Mary]], the mother of [[Jesus in Islam|Jesus]].

When mentioning the [[Sahabah]] (the companions, disciples, scribes and family of the [[Islamic prophet]] Muhammad), ''[[Radhiallahu_'anhu|raḍiya llāhu ʿanhu]]'' (for males) and ''[[Radhiallahu_'anhu|raḍiya 'llāhu ʿanha]]'' (for women) are used by Sunnis; they mean, "May God be pleased with him or her," respectively. These have often been abbreviated ''RA''.  The phrase is sometimes also used after mentioning other names, including those of [[Jesus]] and [[Moses]], but the term عليه سلام ''ʿalayhi salām'', "On him be peace," is more common in such cases.

==In the Qurʾān==
{{Islam}}
In the translation of the meanings of the [[Qurʾān]] in ''[[Sura]]h'' (chapter) 33 entitled ''[[Al-Ahzab]]'' (The Confederates), ''[[ayah]]'' (verse) 56:

{{quote|Surely Allah and His angels bless the Prophet; O you who believe! call for (Divine) blessings on him and salute him with a (becoming) salutation.|2=Al-Ahzab&lt;ref name="quran3356"&gt;{{Cite quran|33|56|style=nosup|translator=s}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== In ''tafsir'' ==
The [[Ulema|Islamic scholar]], [[ibn Kathir]], titled the section in his ''[[tafsir]]'' (i.e., explanation of the Qurʾān), the ''[[Tafsir ibn Kathir]]'', regarding this verse, "The Command to say Salah upon the Prophet (Muhammad)".

This point is further founded in the saying by Muhammad that, {{quote|The miser is the one in whose presence I am mentioned, then he does not send the Salam upon me.|Muhammad}} This was recorded by [[Ahmad ibn Hanbal]] in his ''[[Musnad Ahmad ibn Hanbal|Musnad]]''.

==In ''hadith''==
[[File:Prophet Muhammad Peace upon him- 3.png|thumb|Prophet Muhammad Peace upon him- صلى الله عليه وسلم]]
The evidence for sending [[salat]] on Muhammad is not limited to the Qurʾān. It is also found in ''[[hadith]]'' about Muhammad. Examples include:

[[Al-Tirmidhi]] recorded that [[Abu Hurairah]] said: {{quote|The Messenger of Allah said, "May he be humiliated, the man in whose presence I am mentioned and he does not send Salah upon me; may he be humiliated, the man who sees the [[Ramadan (calendar month)|month of Ramadan]] come and go, and he is not forgiven; may he be humiliated, the man whose parents live to old age and they do not cause him to be granted admittance to Paradise."|Abu Hurairah}}

Al-Tirmidhi said that this ''hadith'' was, "[[Hasan (hadith)|Hasan]] gharib" ("Good but only reported once").

In ''[[Sahih Muslim]]'', ''[[Sunan Abi Dawood]]'', ''[[Sunan al-Tirmidhi]]'', and ''[[Al-Sunan al-Sughra]]'' (Sunan al-Nasa'i), four of the [[Six major Hadith collections|six major]] [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] [[hadith collection|''hadith'' collections]], recorded that Abu Hurairah said, {{quote|The Messenger of Allah said: "Whoever sends one Salah upon me, Allah will send ten upon him."|Abu Hurayrah}}

[[Imam]] [[Ahmad ibn Hanbal]] reported in his ''[[Musnad Ahmad ibn Hanbal|Musnad]]'' that the [[Sahaba|companion of Muhammad]], Abu Talha ibn Thabit said: {{quote|One morning the Messenger of Allah was in a cheerful mood and looked happy. They said, "O Messenger of Allah, this morning you are in a cheerful mood and look happy." He said, "Of course, just now someone [an angel] came to me from my Lord [Allah] and said, 'Whoever among your Ummah sends Salah upon you, Allah will record for him ten good deeds and will erase for him ten evil deeds, and will raise his status by ten degrees, and will return his greeting with something similar to it.'"|Abu Talha ibn Thabit}}

[[Ahmad Bayhaqi]] reports that Abu Hurairah said that Muhammad said: {{quote|''Send the Salat on Allah's messengers and prophets for Allah sent them as He sent me.''|Muhammad}}

==Ruling on abbreviating the phrase==
Scholars of the [[Wahhabi]] branch of Islam practised in [[Saudi Arabia]] have instructed their followers not to abbreviate the salat to Muhammad. For example, [[Abd al-Aziz ibn Baz]], the [[Grand Mufti]] of Saudi Arabia, said:{{cn|date=January 2015}}{{year needed|date=January 2015}}

{{quote|1=As it is prescribed to send prayers upon the Prophet (peace and prayers of Allah be upon him) in prayer when saying the [[tashahhud]], and it is prescribed when giving [[khutbah]]s, saying ''[[Du’a]]'' and praying for forgiveness, and after the ''[[Adhan]]'', and when entering and exiting the mosque, and when mentioning him in other circumstances, so it is more important to do so when writing his name in a book, letter, article and so on. So it is prescribed to write the prayers in full so as to fulfil the command that Allah has given to Muslims, and so that the reader will remember to say the prayers when he reads it. So one should not write the prayers on the Prophet (peace and prayers of Allah be upon him) in short form such as writing (S) or (SAWS) etc, or other forms that some writers use, because that is going against the command of Allah in His Book, where He says (interpretation of the meaning):

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Send your Salaah on (ask Allah to bless) him (Muhammad), and (you should) greet (salute) him with the Islamic way of greeting (salutation, i.e. As‑Salaamu ‘Alaykum)" [Qurʾān 33:56]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

And that (writing it in abbreviated form) does not serve that purpose and is devoid of the virtue of writing "salla Allaahu ‘alayhi wa salaam (May Allah send prayers and peace upon him)" in full. Moreover the reader may not take notice of it and may not understand what is meant by it. It should also be noted that the symbol used for it is regarded as disapproved by the scholars, who warned against it.}}

'''Phongku''' (''{{IPA|pʰɔŋ˧ku˥bɔ˩}}'') is a [[Loloish language]] of [[Phongsaly Province]], northern [[Laos]]. David Bradley (2007)&lt;ref name="Bradley2007"&gt;Bradley, David (2007). "Language Endangerment in China and Mainland Southeast Asia". In Matthias Brenzinger, ed. ''Language diversity endangered''. New York: Mouton de Gruyter.&lt;/ref&gt; lists ''pʰɔŋ˧ku˥'' as the autonym.

In Phongsaly Province, Laos, Phongku is spoken in Phongku Long, [[Boun Tay District|Bun Tay District]] (Kingsada 1999). Another group called ''phɔŋ33 ku55'' or Phu-Lawa speaks a closely related language variety in Phongkulong village, [[Boun Tay District|Bun Tay District]] (Shintani 2001).

      <comment>“Ponapean” is often mispronounced by foreigners as “Pahn apean” which significantly alters the meaning. This word has fallen out of popular usage (source: online poll and google keyword searches. 107 hits per day on Ponapean vs 1350 hits per day on Pohnpeian). Added and updated content that is up to date. The census information was very outdated. There are thousands of Pohnpeians living abroad which can be easily seen during the softball tournaments held in the mainland and many other events...</comment>

'''Pohnpeian''', is a [[Micronesian languages|Micronesian language]] spoken as the indigenous language of the island of [[Pohnpei]] in the [[Caroline Islands]]. Pohnpeian has approximately 30,000 (estimated) native speakers living in Pohnpei and its outlying [[atoll]]s and islands with another 10,000-15,000 (estimated) living off island in parts of the US mainland, Hawaii and Guam. It is the second-most widely spoken native language of the [[Federated States of Micronesia]].&lt;ref name=Dalby&gt;{{cite book|first=Andrew |last=Dalby |title=Dictionary Of Languages, The Definitive Reference To More Than 400 Languages |publisher=Bloomsbury Pub Ltd |year=2004 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CnckpL8auSIC |isbn=0231115695 |accessdate=2012-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pohnpeian features a "[[Register (sociolinguistics)|high language]]" including some specialized vocabulary, used in speaking about people of high rank.&lt;ref name=Dalby/&gt;

==Classification==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:MLSC Equals Justice.jpg|thumb|right|Commercial signage in Pohnpeian.]] --&gt;

Pohnpeian is most closely related to the [[Chuukic languages]] of [[Chuuk State|Chuuk]] (formerly Truk). [[Ngatikese language|Ngatikese]], [[Pingelapese language|Pingelapese]] and [[Mokilese language|Mwokilese]] of the [[Pohnpeic languages]] are closely related languages to Pohnpeian. Pohnpeian shares 81% lexical similarity with Pingelapese, 75% with Mokilese, and 36% with [[Chuukese language|Chuukese]].&lt;ref name=SIL&gt;{{cite web|editor=Lewis, M. Paul |year=2009 |work=Ethnologue: Languages of the World |edition=16 |location=[[Dallas]] |publisher=SIL International online |title=Pohnpeian |url=http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=pon |accessdate=2012-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dalby/&gt;

Pohnpeian employs a great deal of [[loanword]]s from colonial languages such as [[English language|English]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], and [[German language|German]].&lt;ref name=Rehg79/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rehg81/&gt;{{rp|14}} However, these "loanwords" are neither spelled or pronounced the same as the source language.

==Phonology==

The modern Pohnpeian [[orthography]] uses twenty letters — sixteen single letters and four digraphs — collated in a unique order:&lt;ref name=Rehg81&gt;{{cite book|title=Ponapean Reference Grammar |series=PALI language texts: Micronesia |first1=Kenneth L. |last1=Rehg |first2=Damian G. |last2=Sohl |publisher=University of Hawaii Press |year=1981 |isbn=0824807189 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yh77ZUXpYyQC |accessdate=2012-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{|
| a || e || i || o || oa || u || h || k || l || m || mw || n || ng || p || pw || r || s || d || t || w
|}

As German missionaries designed an early form of the orthography, Pohnpeian spelling uses -h to mark a long vowel, rather like German: dohl 'mountain'.&lt;ref name=Dalby/&gt; The [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] equivalents of written Pohnpeian are as follows:&lt;ref name=Rehg81/&gt;

===Phonotactics===

Pohnpeian [[phonotactics]] generally allow syllables of consisting of [[consonant]]s (C) and [[vowel]]s (V) accordingly: V, VC, CV, CVC. This basic system is complicated by Pohnpeian [[orthography|orthographical conventions]] and [[phonology|phonological processes]]. Orthographically, ''i'' is used to represent &lt;nowiki&gt;/&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Palatal approximant|j]]/, though it is often unwritten; ''-u'' is realized as &lt;nowiki&gt;/&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Labio-velar approximant|w]]/; and ''h'' indicates a long vowel (inherited from [[German language|German]]).&lt;ref name=Dalby/&gt; Thus, ''sahu'' is pronounced [sʲa:w], never [sʲahu]. Consecutive vowels are glided with [j] or [w], depending on the relative height and order of the vowels: ''diar'' is said [tijar] ("to find"); ''toai'' is [ ̻tɔji] ("to have a runny nose"); ''suwed'' is [sʲuwɛt] ("bad"); and ''lou'' is [lowu] ("cooled"). While the glide [j] is never written other than as ''i'' the glide [w] may be written between ''u'' and a non-[[high vowel]]: ''suwed'' ("bad").&lt;ref name=Rehg81/&gt;{{rp|54–5}}

Words beginning in [[nasal consonant|nasal]] [[consonant clusters]] may be pronounced as written, or with a leading [[prothesis (linguistics)|prothetic vowel]]. The [[roundedness]] of the prothetic vowel depends on that of the adjacent consonant cluster and the first written syllable. For example, ''nta'' can be said [i ̻n ̻ta] ("blood"), and ''ngkapwan'' may be [iŋkapʷan] ("a while ago"); but ''mpwer'' is optionally [umʷpʷɛr] ("twin"), and ''ngkopw'' may be [uŋkopʷ] (a species of crab). Pohnpeian orthography renders the consonant clusters [mʷpʷ] and [mʷmʷ] as ''mpw'' and ''mmw'', respectively.&lt;ref name=Rehg81/&gt;{{rp|55–9}}

====Substitution and assimilation====

Further phonological constraints frequently impact the pronunciation and spelling of consonant clusters, triggered variously by [[reduplication]] and [[assimilation (linguistics)|assimilation]] into neighboring sounds. Sound changes, especially in reduplication, are often reflected by a change in spelling. However, processes triggered by [[affix]]es as well as adjacent words are not indicated in spelling. In order to inflect, derive, and pronounce Pohnpeian words properly, the order of operations must generally begin with liquid assimilation, followed by nasal assimilation, and end with nasal substitution.&lt;ref name=Rehg81/&gt;{{rp|58–64}}

First, [[liquid consonant|liquid]] [[assimilation (linguistics)|assimilation]] is seen most often in reduplication alongside spelling changes. By this process, liquids /l/ and /r/ are assimilated into the following [[alveolar]] (coronal) consonant: ''nur'' &gt; ''nunnur'' ("contract").&lt;ref name=Rehg81/&gt;{{rp|60}}

The second process, [[nasal consonant|nasal]] [[assimilation (linguistics)|assimilation]], presents two varieties: partial and complete. In partial nasal assimilation, /n/ assimilates with a following [[stop consonant]] to produce [mp], [mʷpʷ], [mm], [mʷmʷ], or [ŋk]. For example, the prefix ''nan-'' ("in") produces: ''nanpar'', pronounced [nampar] ("trade wind season"); ''nanpwungara'', said [namʷpʷuŋara] ("between them"); and ''nankep'', said [naŋkep] ("inlet"). Partial assimilation also occurs across word boundaries: ''kilin pwihk'' is pronounced [kilimʷ pʷiːk]. The allophone of /n/ is written "n" in these cases.&lt;ref name=Rehg81/&gt;{{rp|56–7}}

In complete nasal assimilation, /n/ assimilates into adjacent liquid consonants to produce /ll/ or /rr/: ''lin + linenek'' &gt; ''lillinenek'' ("oversexed," spelling change from reduplication); ''nanrek'' is said [narrɛk] ("season of plenty"). Complete nasal assimilation also occurs across word boundaries: ''pahn lingan'' is said [paːlliŋan] ("will be beautiful").&lt;ref name=Rehg81/&gt;{{rp|57, 60}}

The third process, nasal substitution, also presents two varieties. Both varieties of nasal substitution affect adjacent consonants of the same type: [[alveolar consonant|alveolar (coronal)]], [[bilabial consonant|bilabial]], or [[velar consonant|velar]]. The first variety is often triggered by reduplication, resulting in spelling changes: ''sel'' is reduplicated to ''sensel'' ("tired").&lt;ref name=Rehg81/&gt;{{rp|58–64}}

The second variety of nasal substitution, limited to [[bilabial consonant|bilabial]] and [[velar consonant]]s, occurs [[sandhi|across word and morpheme]] boundaries: ''kalap pahn'' is pronounced [kalam pahn] ("always will be"); ''Soulik kin soupisek'' is pronounced [souling kin soupisek] ("Soulik is [habitually] busy"). This second variety of the nasal substitution process is phonemically more productive than the first: it includes all results possible in the first variety, as well as additional cluster combinations, indicated &lt;span style="color:#008000;"&gt;in green&lt;/span&gt; below. Some [[alveolar]] pairs produce an intervening vowel, represented as V below. Not all clusters are possible, and not all are assimilative, however.&lt;ref name=Rehg81/&gt;{{rp|58–64}}

|-

|-
|}

By following the order of operations, reduplication of the word ''sel'' ("tired") progresses thus: *''selsel'' &gt; *''sessel'' (liquid assimilation) &gt; ''sensel'' (nasal substitution).&lt;ref name=Rehg81/&gt;{{rp|60}} In this case, the same result is achieved by nasal substitution alone.

==Grammar==

Pohnpeian [[word order]] is nominally [[subject–verb–object|SVO]]. Depending on the grammatical function, the [[head (linguistics)|head]] may come before or after its dependents. Like many [[Austronesian languages]], Pohnpeian [[focus (linguistics)|focus marking]] interacts with [[transitivity (grammar)|transitivity]] and relative clauses (see [[Austronesian alignment]]). Its range of grammatically acceptable sentence structures is more generally (1) noun phrase, (2) verb phrase (3) other noun phrases, where the contents of the leading noun phrase may vary according to the speaker's focus. If the leading noun phrase is not the subject, it is followed by the focus particle ''me''. Normally, the object phrase is last among predicates:&lt;ref name=Rehg81/&gt;{{rp|225, 248–50, 280, 307}}

===Honorific speech===

[[Honorific]] speech is used in several settings as a way of showing honor and respect to older ones, those who have been assigned titles, royalty, and in almost all religious settings. Depending on the second or third person, a given sentence may vary widely because honorific speech comprises a separate vocabulary, including all parts of speech and topics both lofty and mundane. Examples include: ''pohnkoiohlap'' (to eat with the ''[[tribal chief|nahnmwarki]]''), ''likena'' (high chief's wife), ''pahnkupwur'' (chest; normally ''mwarmware''), ''pahnpwoal'' (armpit; normally ''pahnpeh''), ''dauso'' (anus, normally ''pwoar''), ''kelipa'' (to joke, normally ''kamwan''), ''kaluhlu'' (to vomit), and ''keipweni'' (an interjection). Although at times in the absence of a specific honorific word, the word "Ketin" is often used to indicate that the proceeding verb is honoric ("Koht kin ketin kapikada" would translate to "God creates"). The word "Ketin" has no meaning by itself. However, when used as a prefix, it is a sure way to distinguish honorific speech ("Kiong" has the meaning of "Give", "Ketkiong" would be the honorific version of the same word)&lt;ref name=Rehg79/&gt;

===Nouns===

[[Nouns]] may be singular, [[dual (grammatical number)|dual]], or [[plural]] in [[grammatical number|number]], and generally inflect by suffixing. Numerals usually follow the nouns they count, and agree in [[noun class]]. Groups of nouns and adjectives comprise noun phrases. Pohnpeian transitive sentences contain up to three noun phrases.&lt;ref name=Rehg81/&gt;{{rp|141–2, 157, 280}}

[[Inalienable possession|Inalienable]], or direct, possession is marked by personal suffixes. Other forms of [[possession (linguistics)|possession]] are indicated through [[possessive determiner|possessive classifiers]]. The construct suffix ''-n'' appears in oblique positions, such as possessive phrases. Words ending in ''n'', however, are followed by the clitic ''en''. Possessive phrases generally add this construct state to a classifier noun, followed by the possessor, and lastly the possessum. For example: ''weren ohlo war'' (&lt;small&gt;POSSESSIVECLASS:CANOE&lt;/small&gt;-n that-man canoe) means "that man's canoe."&lt;ref name=Rehg81/&gt;{{rp|188, 192}}

Some possessive classifiers, namely ''ah'' and ''nah'', may precede the possessum: ''nein ohlo (nah) rasaras'' (&lt;small&gt;CLASS:&lt;/small&gt;-n that-man [&lt;small&gt;CLASS&lt;/small&gt;] saw) means "that man's saw." Possessive classifiers can also occur with more than one following noun. The classifier itself may give a particular meaning to the possessum: ''pwihk'' means "pig;" ''nah pwihk'' means "his (live) pig;" ''ah pwihk'' means "his (butchered) pig;" and ''kene pwihk'' means "his pig (to eat)."&lt;ref name=Rehg81/&gt;{{rp|182–4}}

====Determiners====
[[Determiner]]s in Pohnpeian may occurs as [[Clitic#Enclitic|enclitics]] which are [[bound morpheme]]s or independent words and occur in three basic types: demonstrative modifiers, pointing demonstratives, and demonstrative pronouns.&lt;ref name=Rehg81/&gt;{{rp|143}} All of the determiners have a three-way [[Deixis|diectic]] distinction of proximal (near the speaker), medial (near the listener), and distal (away from both the speaker and listener), as well as an emphatic/non-emphatic distinction. [[Demonstrative]]s are generally, suffixed to or following the last word of a noun phrase.&lt;ref name=Rehg81/&gt;{{rp|144–50}} [[Orthography|Orthographically]] singular clitics are suffixed to the word, while plurals are written as separate words.&lt;ref name=Rehg81/&gt;

=====Demonstrative modifiers=====
Demonstrative modifiers occur as enclitics with nouns and always occupy the last element in a noun phrase.

The singular emphatic demonstrative modifiers are formed by suffixing the non-emphatic singular forms to appropriate numeral classifier for the noun, such as ''men-'' for [[Animacy|animate]] nouns. The plural forms are always constructed by suffixing the non-emphatic plural form to ''pwu-'' regardless of the singular classifier.&lt;ref name=Rehg81/&gt;{{rp|149}}

=====Pointing modifiers=====
Pointing modifiers are [[determiner]]s that can stand alone in a noun phrase and are used in equational (non-verbal) sentences.&lt;ref name=Rehg81/&gt;{{rp|150}} They can also occur by themselves as one word sentences. They have both non-emphatic and emphatic forms.

* ''Iet!'' 'Here it is!'
* ''Iohkan!'' 'There they are! (away from you and me)

=====Demonstrative pronouns=====
Demonstrative [[pronoun]]s are [[determiner]]s that can replace noun phrases in a verbal sentence. They have both non-emphatic and emphatic forms.

====Possessive classifiers====

[[Possessive determiner|Possessive classifiers]] are used frequently and differentiate among person, possessum, and honorific usage. Their personal forms appear below:

{| class="wikitable" style=text-align:center
|+ Personal possessive classifiers&lt;ref name=Rehg79/&gt;
|-
!
! Singular

|-
| rowspan=3 | Third person
| nah, ah || ara, neira || arail, neirail/nair
|-
| colspan=3 | Honorific: sapwellime
|-
|}

Further possessive classifiers include: ''sapwellime'' (third person honorific), ''were'' (vehicles, canoes), ''nime'' (drinkable things), ''imwe'' (buildings, homes), ''ulunge'' (pillows), ''sapwe'' (land), ''kie'' (things to sleep on), ''tie'' (earrings), ''mware'' (garlands, titles, names), ''ipe'' (covers, sheets), ''kene'' (edibles), and ''seike'' (catch of fish).&lt;ref name=Rehg79/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rehg81/&gt;{{rp|184}}

Specialized kinship classifiers include: ''kiseh'' (relatives), ''sawi'' (clan members), ''rie'' (sibling in [[Crow kinship]]), ''wahwah'' (man's sister-relation's children), and ''toki'' (persons with whom one has had sexual intercourse).&lt;ref name=Rehg81/&gt;{{rp|116, 184}}

==== Honorifics ====

[[Honorific]]s comprise a largely separate vocabulary.&lt;ref name=Rehg79&gt;{{cite book|title=Ponapean-English Dictionary |series=PALI language texts: Micronesia |first1=Kenneth L. |last1=Rehg |first2=Damian G. |last2=Sohl |publisher=University of Hawaii Press |year=1979 |isbn=0824805623 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=58Ej3akzB3gC |accessdate=2012-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Numbers and measure words ====

[[Number]]s normally follow the nouns they count, however they may be pre-posed in certain situations. Numbers and [[measure word]]s depend on the grammatical class and physical characteristics of the object being counted. The several number systems are grouped by linguists into three sets, reflecting their term for "ten." When naming numbers in order, natives most often use the –''u'' class. ''Ngoul'' is an alternate word for "ten" for ''-pak'' and ''-sou'' [[classifier (linguistics)|classifiers]].&lt;ref name=Rehg81/&gt;{{rp|127, 135, 141–2}}

Higher numerals such as ''pwiki'' "hundred", ''kid'' "thousand", do not inflect for [[noun class]]. The –''ehd'' system, above is likewise not class-based.&lt;ref name=Rehg81/&gt;{{rp|137–40}}

Ordinals are formed with the prefix ''ka–'', pronounced as ''ke–'' in certain words.&lt;ref name=Rehg81/&gt;{{rp|141–42, 215–218, 318}}

===Verbs===

Pohnpeian distinguishes between [[intransitive verb|intransitive]] and [[transitive verb]]s. Transitive verbs are those with both a [[subject (grammar)|subject]] and an [[object (grammar)|object]]. Intransitive verbs indicate most other [[verb]]al, [[adjective|adjectival]], and [[adverb]]ial relationships. Within verb phrases, [[grammatical aspect|aspect]] markers are followed by adverbs, and lastly the main verb.&lt;ref name=Rehg81/&gt;{{rp|193–5, 255–67}}

Many, if not most, transitive and intransitive verbs share [[root (linguistics)|common roots]], though their derivation is often unpredictable. Some thematic features among intransitive verbs include [[ablaut]], [[reduplication]], the suffix ''-ek'', and the prefix ''pV'', where V stands for any vowel. [[thematic vowel|Thematic suffixes]] among transitive verbs include ''-ih'' and ''-VC'', where C stands for any consonant. Some transitive verbs also end in a final short vowel.&lt;ref name=Rehg81/&gt;{{rp|202–209}}

Pohnpeian indicates four [[grammatical aspect]]s: [[imperfective aspect|unrealized]], [[habitual aspect|habitual]], [[durative aspect|durative]], and [[perfective aspect|perfective]]. Alternations in vowel length, as well as ablaut, are a salient feature of the aspect paradigm.&lt;ref name=Rehg81/&gt;{{rp|253–54, 267–73}}

Pohnpeian permits [[relative clause]]s and conjoined clauses through use of [[conjunction (grammar)|conjunctions]] and [[conjunctive adverb]]s. The language also permits verbs within [[nominal clause]]s as [[gerund|gerundive clauses]], [[finite clause]]s, and [[infinitive clause]]s.&lt;ref name=Rehg81/&gt;{{rp|349}}

Pohnpeian verbs allow for a high level of affixation. The allowable suffixes and their ordering is presented in the table below.

====Intransitive verbs====

Pohnpeian intransitive verbs can be divided into the following types:
{|border="1" class="wikitable" style="text-align:center; width:50%;"
|-
! colspan="5" | Intransitive verbs&lt;ref name=Rehg81/&gt;{{rp|195, 202}}
|-
| colspan="4" | General intransitives 
! rowspan="3" | Adjectives
|-
| colspan="3" | Activity verbs
! rowspan="2" | Non-Activity&lt;br&gt;verbs
|-
! Active || Resultative || Neutral
|-
| ''mwenge''&lt;br&gt;to eat || ''lop''&lt;br&gt;to be cut || ''les''&lt;br&gt;to split, be split || ''mi''&lt;br&gt;to exist || ''pweipwei''&lt;br&gt;to be stupid
|-
|}

There are five verbal [[prefix]]es, which appear as [[bound morpheme]]s: the causative ''ka-'', the negatives ''sa-'' and ''sou-'', and two other semantic modifiers ''ak-'' and ''li-''.

''Ka-'', the [[causative]] prefix, makes intransitive verbs into transitive ones. It is the most productive prefix, as it is the only that can precede the other four above. It often occurs in conjunction with a [[reduplication|reduplicative]] vowel suffix. For example, with ''luwak'', "be jealous", an adjective:&lt;ref name=Rehg81/&gt;{{rp|215–218, 221}}
*''Liho luwak'': That woman is jealous
*''Liho '''ka'''luwak'': That woman was made jealous
*''Liho '''ka'''luwak'''a''' lihet'': That woman made the [other] woman jealous
*''Pisek'', idle
*''Soupisek'', busy (i.e., un-idle)
*''Kasoupisek'', to make busy

The majority of intransitive verbs have only a transitive [[causative]] form: ''pweipwei'' &gt; ''kapweipwei'', "to be stupid." Among verbs where ''ka-'' is productive, only adjectives and a few resultative intransitive verbs have both intransitive and transitive causative forms. Though the prefix is productive in many active and resultative verbs, it is not productive with neutral intransitive verbs, nor for a handful of intransitives denoting bodily functions such as "sneeze" (''asi''), "frown" (''lolok''), "be full" (''tip''), and "be smelly" (''ingirek''). The prefix ''ka-'' often has assimilative [[allophone]]s depending on the stem, for example ''soai'' (to tell a tale) becomes '''''koa'''soia'' (to talk), ''dou'' (to climb) becomes '''''ko'''doudou'' (to trace one's ancestry), and ''rir'' (to be hidden) becomes '''''ke'''rir'' (secret sweetheart). As illustrated in these examples, the prefix often causes semantic differentiation, necessitating different constructions for literally causative meanings; ''karirala'', a different form employing ''ka-'', is used to mean "to make hidden."&lt;ref name=Rehg81/&gt;{{rp|216–218}}

''Sa-'' and ''sou-'' negate verbs, however ''sou-'' is less productive than ''sa-'', which itself varies in productivity according to regional dialect. The general meaning of ''sa-'' appears to be "not," while ''sou-'' apparently means "un-," thus:&lt;ref name=Rehg81/&gt;{{rp|218–219}}
*''wehwe'', to understand; ''sawehwe'', to not understand
*''pwung'', correct; ''sapwung'', incorrect
*''nsenoh'', concerned; ''sounsenoh'', careless (i.e., un-concerned)

Like ''ka-'', ''sa-'' displays assimilative allophony: ''ese'', "to know" &gt; ''sehse'', "to not know;" ''loalekeng'', "intelligent" &gt; ''soaloalekeng'', "not intelligent." Only a single example has been found of ''sa-'' preceding ''ka-'': the word ''koasoakoahiek'' means "inappropriate," deriving from the verb ''koahiek'', "be competent."&lt;ref name=Rehg81/&gt;{{rp|220}}

''Ak-'' adds a semantic meaning of demonstration or display when combined with adjectives. When preceded by ''ka-'', it becomes ''kahk-''. ''Li-'' generally means "may," or "predisposed, given to" some quality or action.&lt;ref name=Rehg81/&gt;{{rp|221–3}}

=====General intransitive verbs=====

General intransitive verbs describe actions or events. They are divided into [[dynamic verb|active]], [[stative verb|resultative]], and neutral subtypes. For example, ''mwenge'' (to eat) and ''laid'' (to fish) are active; ''langada'' (to be hung up) and ''ritidi'' (to be closed) are resultative (static); and ''deidei'' (to sew, to be sewn) and ''pirap'' (to steal, to be stolen) are neutral — they can have either an active or a resultative meaning. Though resultative verbs sometimes resemble passive transitive verbs in English, they are in fact a class of intransitive verbs in Pohnpeian, which entirely lacks a comparable [[active voice|active]]-[[passive voice]] distinction. For example, ''Ohlo pahn kilel'' means both "That man will take a photograph" and "That man will be photographed." Reduplication is frequently productive among general intransitives and adjectives alike. Derivations often include reduplication: ''pihs'' &gt; ''pipihs'' (to urinate); ''us'' &gt; ''usuhs'' (to pull out).&lt;ref name=Rehg81/&gt;{{rp|196–8, 207}}

Many intransitives are ablauted from their transitive forms, sometimes with reduplication: ''apid'' (trans.) &gt; ''epid'' (intrans.) "to carry on one's side," ''par'' (trans.) &gt; ''periper'' (intrans.) "to cut."&lt;ref name=Rehg81/&gt;{{rp|206}}

Others are derived from transitive forms through the prefix ''pV-'', conveying a meaning of reciprocal action: ''kakil'' (stare) &gt; ''pekekil'' (stare at one another). These [[reciprocal (grammar)|reciprocal intransitives]] form a distinct subgroup.&lt;ref name=Rehg81/&gt;{{rp|208}}

A few intransitives derive from transitive roots through the suffix ''-ek'', though this is a [[fossilization (linguistics)|fossilized]] suffix and is no longer [[productivity (linguistics)|productive]]. For example, ''dierek'' (to be found) from ''diar'' (to find); ''dilipek'' (for a thatch roof to be mended) from ''dilip'' (to mend a thatch roof). Sometimes this results in two intransitive derivations of a single transitive root, usually with a semantic nuance: transitive ''wengid'' (to wring), intransitive ''wengiweng'' (to wring/be wrung), intransitive ''wengidek'' (to be twisted); transitive ''widinge'' (to deceive), intransitive ''widing'' (to deceive/be deceived); intransitive ''widingek'' (to be deceitful). The suffix was apparently much more productive earlier in the language's history, even among active verbs.&lt;ref name=Rehg81/&gt;{{rp|207–8}}

Intransitives include verbs that [[incorporation (linguistics)|incorporate]] their objects, in contrast with transitives, which state objects separately; this is somewhat akin to "babysitting" in English. This process sometimes results in vowel shortening within the incorporated noun. Any verbal suffixes, normally suffixed to the initial verb, follow the incorporated object. Incorporation is not possible when there is a [[demonstrative]] suffix, however:&lt;ref name=Rehg81/&gt;{{rp|212–4}}
*''I pahn pereklos'', I will mat-unroll
*''I pahn pereki lohs'', I will unroll mats
*''I pahn pereki lohso'', I will unroll that mat

=====Adjectives=====

Pohnpeian adjectives are a class of non-action intransitive verbs. They function in a mostly parallel way to other intransitive verbs: ''E pahn [tang/lemei]'' – "He will run/be cruel"; ''E [tangtang/lemelemei]'' – "He is running/being cruel"; ''E [tenge/lamai] pwutako'' – "He ran to/is cruel to that boy." Many adjectives themselves can be used as commands, and have transitive counterparts.&lt;ref name=Rehg81/&gt;{{rp|198}}

Adjectives function as a subclass of intransitive verbs, though grammatical functions set them apart. For example, the [[superlative]] ''-ie'' is reserved for adjectives, as in ''lingan'', "beautiful," and ''lingahnie'', "most beautiful." Likewise reserved for adjectives is the suffix -''ki'', which indicates instrumentality in transitive verbs, means "to consider [beautiful]" when suffixed to an adjective. Superlatives may also appear using the ordinal numeral ''keieu'' "first." [[Comparative]]s are made through word order and the suffix ''-sang'': ''Pwihke laudsang pwihko'' means "This pig is bigger than that pig."&lt;ref name=Rehg81/&gt;{{rp|195–200, 215, 224–6, 250}}

One feature setting adjectives apart from non-active verbs is the productivity of the stative marker ''me'' (different from the pronoun and focus particle ''me''), which is generally not grammatically correct with intransitive verbs of any kind:&lt;ref name=Rehg81/&gt;{{rp|199–200}}
*''E mwahu'', He is good; and ''E me mwahu'', He ''is'' good!
*''E mi mwo'', It exists there; but not *''E me mi mwo''.

Another aspect setting adjectives apart from other intransitives is that adjectives precede numerals, while intransitives follow. Adjectives generally follow the [[head (linguistics)|head noun]], though [[possessive determiner|possessives]] and numbers with fractions precede the noun:&lt;ref name=Rehg81/&gt;{{rp|124, 141}} 
*''pwutak'', boy
*''pwutako'', that boy
*''pwutak silimeno'', those three boys
*''pwutak reirei silimeno'', those three tall boys
*''nei pwutak silimeno'', my three sons there
*''orenso'', that orange
*''pahkis ehuwen orenso'', one-fourth of that orange
*''mahio'', that breadfruit
*''pahkis siluhwen mahio'', three-fourths of that breadfruit

====Transitive verbs====

Transitive verbs consist of single [[root (linguistics)|roots]] and various suffixes upon modern intransitive verbs. Historically, intransitive verbs probably developed by dropping these transitive suffixes and ablauting.

Some transitive verbs end in -VC on intransitive forms, appearing as un[[ablaut]]ed or without [[reduplication]]; as intransitives were likely products of final syllable dropping, the endings are rather unpredictable: ''poad'' &gt; ''poadok'', "to plant," ''id'' &gt; ''iding'', "to make fire," ''pek'' &gt; ''pakad'', "to defecate," and ''dapadap'' &gt; ''daper'', "to catch."&lt;ref name=Rehg81/&gt;{{rp|203}}

Several transitive verbs end in -''ih'' on intransitive roots, sometimes also with vowel changes: ''malen'' &gt; ''mahlenih'', "to draw," ''sel'' &gt; ''salih'', "to tie," and ''erier'' &gt; ''arih'', "to stir, probe." This form is the most [[productivity (linguistics)|productive]] and is used with [[loanwords]].&lt;ref name=Rehg81/&gt;{{rp|204–5}} For example: ''mahlenih'', deriving from German ''mahlen'', means "to paint, draw."&lt;ref name=Rehg79/&gt;{{rp|xv}}

Some transitive verbs ending in short final vowels have intransitive counterparts that lack those endings; again, ablaut and reduplication often differentiate. Examples include ''langa'' &gt; ''lang'', "to hang up," ''doakoa'' &gt; ''dok'', "to spear," and ''rese'' &gt; ''rasaras'', "to sharpen." The short vowel ending ''-i'' appears only in ''-ki''.

Transitive verbal [[suffix]]es include the perfective ''-ehr'', ''-ki'' (which derives verbs from nouns; different from the noun instrumental suffix ''-ki'' and short vowel suffix), object pronoun suffixes, and a host of directional suffixes. These include ''-ehng'' (towards) and ''-sang'' (away, without).&lt;ref name=Rehg81/&gt;{{rp|106–7, 222–52, 246–9, 279}}

===Prepositions and Prepositional Nouns===
Pohnpeian has two canonical [[Preposition and postposition|prepositions]] ''ni'' and ''nan''.&lt;ref name=Rehg81/&gt; ''Nan'' is used to express the containment of an object in either 2D or 3D space by another object, and ''ni'' expresses the attachment of an object to another object.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rentz|first1=Bradley|title=Pohnpeian Topological Relations|journal=Linguistics Vanguard|date=2017|volume=3|doi=10.1515/lingvan-2016-0092}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Lahpo mihmi '''nan''' ihwo'', 'That person is in the house.'
*''Kahto mihmi '''nan''' pingin likou'', 'That cat is on the rug.'
*''Rihngo mihmi '''ni''' pehn liho'', 'That ring is on the woman's finger.'
*''Pwahlo mihmi '''ni''' kehpo'', 'The crack is in the cup.'

==Basic phrases==

Below are some basic words and phrases in Pohnpeian:
*Kaselehlie - Hello (semi-formal)
*Kaselehlie maing - Hello (formal)
*Kaselehlie maing ko - Hello (formal plural)
*Kaselel - Hello (informal)
*Kalahngan - thank you (formal)
*Menlau - thank you (informal)
*edei - my name
*edomw - your name (sg informal)
*Ia edomw? - What is your name?
*Ia iromw? - How are you (sg informal)?

'''Raphael E. Freundlich''' (January 16, 1928 – October 12, 2012) was a classical scholar, humanist and Latinist trained in [[structural linguistics]]. He was a professor [[emeritus]] at [[Tel Aviv University]] in [[Israel]]. His fields of study and teaching included: ancient Greek, Biblical studies and classical Latin.

He was born in Germany in 1928, but escaped with his parents to Palestine via Venice, Italy. He became a scholar among the great classical scholars and structural [[linguists]]. He was a colleague and a friend of Professor Haiim B. Rosen, considered one of the greatest structuralist of European Structural linguistics of the 20th century.

Freundlich retired to the [[United States]] where he taught a few selected students. He died in [[California]] on October 12, 2012.

'''Salvadoran Spanish''' is geographically defined as the form of Spanish spoken in the country of [[El Salvador]]. The Spanish dialect in El Salvador shares many similarities to that of its neighbors in the region, but it has its stark differences in pronunciation and usage. El Salvador, like most of Central America, uses [[voseo]] Spanish as its written and spoken form, similar to that of Argentina. Vos is used, but many Salvadorans understand tuteo. Vos can be heard in television programs and can be seen in written form in publications. ''Usted'' is used as a show of respect, when someone is speaking to an elderly person.

==Phonetics and phonology==
Notable characteristics of Salvadoran phonology include the following:
* The presence of [[seseo]] wherein {{IPA|/θ/}} and {{IPA|/s/}} are not distinguished. Seseo is common to [[Andalusian Spanish|Andalusian]] and [[Canarian Spanish]] varieties.
* Syllable-final {{IPA|/s/}} is realized as glottal {{IPAblink|h}}&lt;ref name="Canfield"&gt;D.

Even words of Greek and Latin origin with &lt;tl&gt;, such as {{wiktes|Atlántico}} and {{wiktes|atleta}}, are pronounced with the affricate: {{IPA|[aˈtlãn̪t̪iko̞]}}, {{IPA|[aˈtle̞t̪a]}} (compare {{IPA|[aðˈlãn̪t̪iko̞]}}, {{IPA|[aðˈle̞t̪a]}} in Spain and other dialects in Hispanic America&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Navarro Tomás|2004|section=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

==Pronouns and verb conjugation==

===Voseo===
{{Main|Voseo}}
"Vos" is the dominant second person singular pronoun used by many speakers in familiar or informal contexts. Salvadoran ''vos'' comes from Gothic Spain and was brought to El Salvador by militaristic Spaniards migrated to the land. Its counterparts are French ''vous'', Portuguese ''vós''. [[Voseo]] is most commonly used among people in the same age group in addressing one another. It is common to hear young children address each other with "vos." The phenomenon also occurs among adults who address one another in familiar or informal contexts. "Vos" is also used by adults in addressing children or juveniles. However, the relationship does not reoccur when children address adults. Children address adults with ''usted'' regardless of age, status or context. The preservation of voseo in Salvadoran Spanish was thanks to El Salvador's ties to the [[United States]] and [[Great Britain]]. When El Salvador became independent, it discontinued to have trade links with Spain, unlike other ''tuteo'' countries. El Salvador's main trading partners were the [[United States]] and [[Great Britain]], thus Spain did not influence El Salvador's language anymore, and Spain changed to tuteo. In turn, English words influenced Salvadoran Spanish and voseo was conserved.

===Ustedeo===
{{Main|Usted}}
"Usted" is the formal second person singular pronoun in Salvadoran Castilian.  "Usted" is used in addressing foreigners formally, for acquaintances, and in business settings. Unlike nearby [[Costa Rica]], "usted" is not the dominant second person pronoun for addressing a person.

===Tuteo===
{{Main|Tuteo}}
"Tú" is hardly used; the use of tú is limited strictly to foreigners. It is used in addressing foreigners familiarly and when writing correspondence to foreigners (again in familiar contexts).

==Salvadoran Caliche/Caliche Salvadoreño==

The definition for Caliche is an informal term for Salvadoran Spanish due to colloquialisms and unique indigenous lexical words that are different from Salvadoran Spanish.  Caliche refers to the Nawat (Pipil) influenced dialect of Spanish spoken in El Salvador.  Many words have gone through the process of deletion, vowel [[Assimilation (phonology)|assimilation]], or [[epenthesis]] to make it easier for the speaker to understand. Salvadoran Caliche is used across social classes, although professional individuals tend to avoid it because it is not considered "proper" Spanish.

For example, this table shows the difference between Standard Salvadoran Spanish and Caliche:

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Español Salvadoreño !! Caliche !! English
|-
| Acá, así es la situación  || Así es la onda || This is the situation
|-
| Está difícil || Está yuca || It is difficult
|-
| Sabemos progresar || Sabemos socarla || We know how to progress
|-
| Nos gusta salir a pasear || Nos gusta chotiar || We like to walk
|-
| Está fácil  || Está chiche || It is easy
|-
|}

Words like this are not unique to El Salvador, and when heard by someone that is Salvadoran or from neighbouring countries they are understood. Nahuatl's influence appears in the word "chiche", which means "parte del seno de la mujer" (DRAE&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Real Academia Española|url=http://dle.rae.es/?id=8ifGDWr}}&lt;/ref&gt; (breast area) from Nahuatl Chichi "mama, teta"). But chiche in El Salvador means "facil" ("que no requiere gran esfuerzo"/"easy—it does not require much effort").  Another word influenced by Nahuatl is the word ''guishte''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guishte|url=http://diccionariolibre.com/definition.php?word=Guishte}}&lt;/ref&gt; that means a piece of broken glass. This word does not appear in any dictionary so its origin cannot be traced, but the only hypothesis behind this word was proposed by Pedro Geoffroy Rivas—an anthropologist, poet, and linguist—who believed that it came from the [[Pipil language]], since El Salvador's Spanish has been heavily influenced by it.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}
 
Unfortunately, Caliche is not described in studies on Salvadoran Spanish. The philologist John M. Lipski points out that Centro American Spanish (including the Spanish spoken in El Salvador) lacks adequate sources for linguistic and literary research.  Lipski further elaborates that such linguistic shortage indicates a possible generalization that in recent decades Salvadoran dialectology has failed to advance as rapidly as the comparative work in other Latin American nations.

'''Thao''' (Thao: '''Thaw a lalawa'''), pronunciation {{IPA|[θau]}}, also known as '''Sao''', is the language of the [[Thao people]], a tribe of [[Taiwanese aborigines]] in the region of [[Sun Moon Lake]] in central [[Taiwan]]. In 2000, there were 5 or 6 speakers living in Ita Thaw (伊達邵) village (traditionally called Barawbaw), all but one of whom were over the age of sixty.{{cn|date=March 2015}} Two elderly native speakers died December 2014 including chief Tarma (袁明智), age 75.

Thao is a [[Formosan language]] of the [[Austronesian languages|Austronesian]] family; Barawbaw and Shtafari are dialects.

'''Orthographic notes''':
*{{IPA|/θ ð ʃ/}} are written {{angbr|th z sh}}. However, in Blust's dictionary {{IPA|/θ/}} is written {{angbr|c}}.
*{{IPA|/ɬ/}} is written {{angbr|lh}}
*{{IPA|/ŋ/}} is written {{angbr|ng}}
*{{IPA|/ʔ/}} is written {{angbr|'}}

'''Notes''':
*The glides {{IPA|/j w/}} are derived from the underlying vowels {{IPA|/i u/}} to meet the requirements that syllables must have onset consonants and to indicate stress placement accurately.
*[v] is an allophone of {{IPA|/w/}} occurring intervocalically.

==Morphology==
Thao has two or arguably three patterns of [[reduplication]]: Ca-reduplication, full reduplication, and rightward reduplication (which  is sometimes considered to be a form of full reduplication).

Thao verbs have the following types of focus (Blust 2003:239).

#Actor: -um- (present), ma- (future)
#Patient: -in, -in-
#Locative: -an

==Syntax==
Thao word order can be both SVO and VSO, although the former is derived from [[Taiwanese Hokkien|Taiwanese]] (Blust 2003:228).

The Thao personal marker is "ti" (Blust 2003:228). Negatives include "ani" and "antu"; "ata tu" is used in "don't" constructions. The perfect is marked by "iza", the past by an infix just after the primary onset consonant "-in-" and the future by the prefix "a-". Imperatives are marked by "-í" and softer imperatives or requests roughly translated as "please" by "-uan" sometimes spelled "-wan" which can co-occur with "-í".

==Pronouns==
The Thao personal pronouns below are from Blust (2003:207). Note that there is only 1 form each for "we (exclusive)," "you (plural)" and "they."

In [[set theory]], a '''universal set''' is a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] which contains all objects, including itself.&lt;ref&gt;Forster 1995 p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[set theory]] as usually formulated, the conception of a universal set leads to a [[paradox]] ([[Russell's paradox]]) and is consequently not allowed. However, some non-standard variants of set theory include a universal set.

== Notation ==
There is no standard notation for the universal set of a given set theory. Common symbols include '''V''', '''U''' and '''[[xi (letter)|ξ]]'''.

==Reasons for nonexistence==
[[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]] and related set theories, which are based on the idea of the [[cumulative hierarchy]], do not allow for the existence of a universal set. It is directly contradicted by the [[axiom of regularity]], and its existence would cause paradoxes which would make the theory inconsistent.

===Russell's paradox===
{{Main|Russell's paradox}}
Russell's paradox prevents the existence of a universal set in [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]] and other set theories that include [[Zermelo]]'s [[axiom of comprehension]].
This axiom states that, for any formula &lt;math&gt;\varphi(x)&lt;/math&gt; and any set {{mvar|A}}, there exists another set 
:&lt;math&gt;\{x \in A \mid \varphi(x)\}&lt;/math&gt;
that contains exactly those elements {{mvar|x}} of {{mvar|A}} that satisfy &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;.  If a universal set&amp;nbsp;{{mvar|V}} existed and the axiom of comprehension could be applied to it, then
there would also exist another set &lt;math&gt;\{x \in V\mid x\not\in x\}&lt;/math&gt;, the set of all sets that do not contain themselves. However, as [[Bertrand Russell]] observed, this set is paradoxical. If it contains itself, then it should not contain itself, and vice versa. For this reason, it cannot exist.

===Cantor's theorem===
{{Main|Cantor's theorem}}
A second difficulty with the idea of a universal set concerns the [[power set]] of the set of all sets. Because this power set is a set of sets, it would necessarily be a subset of the set of all sets, provided that both exist.  However, this conflicts with Cantor's theorem that the power set of any set (whether infinite or not) always has strictly higher [[cardinality]] than the set itself.

==Theories of universality==
The difficulties associated with a universal set can be avoided either by using a variant of set theory in which the axiom of comprehension is restricted in some way, or by using a universal object that is not considered to be a set.

===Restricted comprehension===
There are set theories known to be [[consistent]] (if the usual set theory is consistent) in which the universal set {{mvar|V}} does exist (and &lt;math&gt;V \in V&lt;/math&gt; is true). In these theories, Zermelo's [[axiom of comprehension]] does not hold in general, and the axiom of comprehension of [[naive set theory]] is restricted in a different way. A set theory containing a universal set is necessarily a [[non-well-founded set theory]].
The most widely studied set theory with a universal set is [[Willard Van Orman Quine]]'s [[New Foundations]]. [[Alonzo Church]] and [[:de:Arnold Oberschelp|Arnold Oberschelp]] also published work on such set theories.  Church speculated that his theory might be extended in a manner consistent with Quine's,&lt;ref&gt;Church 1974 p. 308. See also Forster 1995 p. 136 or 2001 p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Flash Sheridan |date=2016 |title=A Variant of Church’s Set Theory with a Universal Set in which the Singleton Function is a Set |url=http://www.logic-center.be/Publications/Bibliotheque/SheridanVariantChurch.pdf |journal=Logique et Analyse |volume=59 |issue=233 |at=§0.2 |doi=10.2143/LEA.233.0.3149532|lay-url=http://www-logic.stanford.edu/seminar/1314/Sheridan_Fixing_Freges_Set_Theory.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this is not possible for Oberschelp's, since in it the singleton function is provably a set,&lt;ref&gt;Oberschelp 1973 p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; which leads immediately to paradox in New Foundations.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes 1998 p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt; The most recent advances in this area have been made by [[Randall Holmes]] who published an online draft version of the book ''[[Elementary Set Theory with a Universal Set]]'' in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://math.boisestate.edu/~holmes/ |title=Overview of Randall Holmes's Home Page }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another example is [[positive set theory]], where the axiom of comprehension is restricted to hold only for the [[positive formula]]s (formulas that do not contain negations). Such set theories are motivated by notions of closure in topology.

===Universal objects that are not sets===
{{main|Universe (mathematics)}}
The idea of a universal set seems intuitively desirable in the [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory]], particularly because most versions of this theory do allow the use of quantifiers over all sets (see [[universal quantifier]]).  One way of allowing an object that behaves similarly to a universal set, without creating paradoxes, is to describe {{mvar|V}} and similar large collections as [[Class (set theory)|proper classes]] rather than as sets. One difference between a universal set and a [[universal class (set theory)|universal class]] is that the universal class does not contain itself, because [[proper class]]es cannot be elements of other classes.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} Russell's paradox does not apply in these theories because the axiom of comprehension operates on sets, not on classes.

The [[category of sets]] can also be considered to be a universal object that is, again, not itself a set. It has all sets as elements, and also includes arrows for all functions from one set to another. 
Again, it does not contain itself, because it is not itself a set.
