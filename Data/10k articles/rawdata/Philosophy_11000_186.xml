'''Abhutaparikalpa''' is a concept which was developed by the Yogacara/Vijnanavada school of Buddhism with regard to definitions of reality identifying it as the dependent nature among the three natures postulated, and is described as neither empty nor not empty by adopting a neither nor position, that it is both existent and not existent. As ''parantantrasvabhava'' it exists as such but does not exist as it appears when affected by the 'subject-object duality' of ''parikalpitasvbhava'' freed from which it is the perfect nature of ''parinispannasvabhava''. This concept is refuted by [[Advaita Vedanta]] in the context of the Buddhist concept of 'momentary existence'.

==Background==

'''Abhūtaparikalpa''' or ''Ālayavijñāna'' means - imagining the object to exist as independent of consciousness. It is the basic concept in the [[Yogācāra|Yogacara]]/[[Vijnanavada]] school which concept is identified as ''pratantrasvabhava'' (dependent nature), the second of the three natures postulated by this school. On the negative side of [[Śūnyatā|shunya]]  ''Abhūtaparikalpa'' becomes associated with the imaginarily constructed duality of subject and object, but on the positive side it represents real existence in virtue of own nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Buddhism: Abhidharma and Madhyamaka|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|page=232|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=GdfSpv8v114C&amp;pg=PA232&amp;lpg=PA232&amp;dq=Abhutaparikalpa&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1h02-_X4TI&amp;sig=n_-x_Ui_C9LE0TXhvxbrsAnOsyk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Tnc7VKwai565BI7fgOgC&amp;ved=0CBwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Abhutaparikalpa&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The grammatical construction of the term ''Abhūtaparikalpa'' is interpreted by Sthiramati by taking it either as locus for the constructing of duality or as instrumental for the construction of unreal duality. For the Vijnanavadins both ''Abhūtaparikalpa'' which is ''paratantrasvabhava'' and a ''vastu existing substantialiter'', and ''shunyata'' which is ''parinispannasvabhavaca'' and not a ''vastu existing substantialiter'', are real.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Buddhism: Abhidharma and Madhyamaka|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|page=270|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=GdfSpv8v114C&amp;pg=PA232&amp;lpg=PA232&amp;dq=Abhutaparikalpa&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1h02-_X4TI&amp;sig=n_-x_Ui_C9LE0TXhvxbrsAnOsyk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Tnc7VKwai565BI7fgOgC&amp;ved=0CBwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Abhutaparikalpa&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Abhutaparikalpa'' is described as neither empty nor not empty by adopting a neither nor position, that it is both existent and not existent. As ''parantantrasvabhava'' it exists as such but does not exist as it appears when affected by the subject-object duality of ''parikalpitasvbhava'' freed from which it is the perfect nature of ''parinispannasvabhava''. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Buddhism: Abhidharma and Madhyamaka|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|page=232-235|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=GdfSpv8v114C&amp;pg=PA232&amp;lpg=PA232&amp;dq=Abhutaparikalpa&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=1h02-_X4TI&amp;sig=n_-x_Ui_C9LE0TXhvxbrsAnOsyk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Tnc7VKwai565BI7fgOgC&amp;ved=0CBwQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Abhutaparikalpa&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nature of the Twofold Consciousness==

Consciousness is basically of two kinds – a) individual consciousness (''pravrttivijnana'') or mind (manas, citta or vijnana), and b) Absolute Consciousness (''Alayavijnana''); the former has for its basis the 'five sense cognitions', 'normal consciousness' and 'continuous consciousness'; and the latter, according to Lankavatara, is 'permanent, immortal and never-changing storehouse of Consciousness'. The object which is firstly imagined or sensed, is thought about before being perceived, at the background of all these is the synthetic unity of perception called [[Citta|Chitta]] or ''Alaya'', also called [[Buddha-nature|Tathagata-garbha]]. The external world is the creation not of the mind but of the Absolute Consciousness, and the force behind creation is the beginningless tendency inspired by [[Avidya (Hinduism)|Avidya]] (ignorance) in the ''Alaya'' to manifest itself as subject and as object; the locus and object of this tendency is the ''Alaya'' itself. Individual consciousness is the manifestation of the ''Alaya'' of the [[Buddhists]], though not accepted, is like the [[Nirvikalpa]] and ''Nirabhasaprajnagochara'' [[Ātman (Hinduism)|Atman]] of the [[Upanishads]]. The ''Vijnanavadins'' aver that ''shunayata'' is not absolute negation but the negation of something in something; the superimposed alone is to be negated because it is not real.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Critical Survey of Indian Philosophy|author=C.D.Sharma|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|pages=110,120|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Y3gQVd5WogsC&amp;pg=PA290&amp;dq=ashraya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=lHU7VLugMoy0uAT0kIEY&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=ashraya&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buddhist Unconsciousness==

''Alaya consciousness'' of the Yogacara Buddhists is 'Buddhist Unconsciousness'. The Yogacara Buddhists were able to recognize the unconscious structuring of experience; they were able to conceptualize the awareness of awareness and differentiate a dimension of unconscious mental process called - ''Alayavijnana'', from the processes of conscious cognitive awareness – called ''Pravrittivijnana''. The concept of ''Alayavijnana'' or ''Abhutaparikalpa'' arose, as a subliminal perception of the world, in response to the [[Abhidharma|Abhidharmic]] developments of earlier Buddhist doctrines. It arose by means of twofold ever-present subtle objective support: a) by the perception of inner appropriation (''upādāna-vijñapti'') and b) by the outward perception of the receptacle world whose aspects are not clearly delineated (''bahirdā apariccinnākāra bhājana-vijñapti''). The term, ''Alaya'', means - 'that which is clung to', 'adhered to' or 'dwelled in', and is closely connected with bodily existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biddhist Unconsciousness|author=William S Waldron|publisher=Routledge|pages=xii,107,179,93|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x9iCAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA182&amp;dq=alaya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=X547VPnNFtPnuQTGsoDYBg&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=alaya&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chogyam Trungpa explains that resting in the nature of ''Alaya'' means - going beyond the six sense consciousness, and even beyond the seventh consciousness, the fundamental discursive thought process which brings about the other six''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Training the Mind and Cultivating Loving Kindness|author=Chogyam Trungpa|publisher=Shambhala Publications|page=22|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=XOvIGJtc6AgC&amp;pg=PA22&amp;dq=alaya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=2qI7VPzuM9GeugSq6oLwDQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=alaya&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Alaya consciousness'' has as its characteristics of being both cause and effect; as cause it perishes and as fruit it is born, it never remains a single entity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mechanism of Consciousness During Life, Dream and After Death|author=Dukkyu Choi|publisher=Author House|page=55,56|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ZsrlJVtv55wC&amp;pg=PA55&amp;dq=alaya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=2qI7VPzuM9GeugSq6oLwDQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=alaya&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advaita refutation==

[[Adi Shankara|Shankara]] in his commentary on [[Brahma Sutras]] II.ii.31, which reads - क्षणिकत्वाच्च meaning – 'And (the ego-consciousness cannot be the abode), for it is momentary', refuting the Vijnanavada notion of the ideation-store asserts that unless there be some principle running through everything at all times, there can be no human dealing involving remembrance, recognition etc., which are contingent on past impressions that are stored up in conformity with environment, time and causation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Brahma Sutra Bhasya of Sankaracarya|publisher=Advaita Ashrama|page=425|url= https://www.amazon.in/Brahma-Sutra-Bhasya-Sankaracarya/dp/8175051051 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and by arguing that if the 'ideation-store' is momentary then it is subject to arguments that have been brought forth against 'momentariness', and if it is permanent there is abandonment of the principle of 'momentariness'. In this context it is said that the co-existence of the principle of 'voidness' and the principle of the imagination of unreality revealed in the ''Madhyata-vibhanga'' which replaces [[Prakṛti]] with [[Śūnyatā|Shunya]] and [[Purusha]] with ''Abhutaparikalpa'', the imagination of unreality, attests that for the ''Vijnanvadins'', the principles of the eternal absolute and the changing phenomenal were not mutually exclusive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=An Evaluation of the Vedantic Critique of Buddhism|author=Gregory Joseph Darling|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=56|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ARxOBD6m8EIC&amp;pg=PA56&amp;lpg=PA56&amp;dq=abhutaparikalpa&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=pI7W_KlHes&amp;sig=GQLg86L-untbLa6BDkdd11nZTtA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=X6w7VPLiJY-JuASX04LoAQ&amp;ved=0CBsQ6AEwADgK#v=onepage&amp;q=abhutaparikalpa&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alessandra Belloni''' (born July 24, 1954 in [[Rome]]) is an [[Italians|Italian]] musician, singer, dancer, actress, choreographer, teacher, and ethnomusicologist. Her instrument is the [[Southern Italy|Southern Italian]] [[tambourine]] and her music and dance are focused on the traditional roots of [[tarantella]]. Her studies of [[tarantism]] are rooted in the culture of [[Apulia]] and [[Calabria]], expressing it from [[women]]'s point of view. Her work has gained international appreciation, especially in the [[United States]] and [[Brazil]]. She is artist in residence at the [[Cathedral of St. John the Divine]].

==Biography==
Alessandra Belloni was born in Rome, daughter of a marble stoneworker and a mother from a musical family of [[Rocca di Papa]]. Her maternal grandfather worked as a baker but was famous in his village for playing music, especially tambourine.&lt;ref name="delgiudice"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Del Giudice|first1=Luisa|title=Oral History, Oral Culture, and Italian Americans|date=2009|pages=193–251|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1057/9780230101395_14|chapter=Alessandra Belloni in Her Own Words}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of 17 in 1971, Belloni moved to New York to visit her sister and pursue a career in music. In 1974 she studied acting at [[HB Studio]] and briefly acted in films, playing a Turkish princess in the film ''[[Fellini's Casanova]]'', for which she learned [[belly dance]]. At [[New York University]] she studied under [[Dario Fo]]. She studied voice with Michael Warren and Walter Blazer.&lt;ref name="donne"&gt;{{cite web|title=Alessandra Belloni|url=http://www.donneinmusica.org/wimust/biographies-european-women-composers/b/67-alessandra-belloni.html|website=Donne in Musica|publisher=Fondazione Adkins Chiti|accessdate=December 25, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While back in Italy, she decided that film was not to be her career. [[Federico Fellini]] advised her: &lt;blockquote&gt;I notice that you are very serious... you're an artist. You are not like the other girls here... You know what I say? You've got to return to New York. Don't stay here because if I had been able to do in America what I do here, if I knew English, I would have done it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Del Giudice|first1=Luisa|title=Oral History, Oral Culture, and Italian Americans|date=2009|pages=201–202|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jYAbTaC-gvoC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Oral%20History%2C%20Oral%20Culture%2C%20and%20Italian%20Americans&amp;pg=PA201#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|chapter=Alessandra Belloni in Her Own Words. 7. Fellini's Advice}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1980 she co-founded, with [[John T. La Barbera|John La Barbera]], the music, folk dance, and theater group I Giullari di Piazza ('the town square players'), which has performed in the United States and Europe, and is in residency at the [[Cathedral of St. John the Divine]]. She studied traditional tambourine technique with the Sicilian percussionist Alfio Antico, renowned for his ability to create "magical and primordial" atmospheres. She has also worked with percussionist [[Glen Velez]], the leading figure in the revival of [[frame drum]]ming in America, whom she met in 1982 through her work in [[Bread and Puppet Theater]]. Velez gave her a book, ''La Terra del Rimorso'' (''The Land of Remorse'') by [[Ernesto De Martino]], which inspired her to study Apulian [[tarantism]]. Beginning in 1984, Belloni has taken part in the feast of San Rocco of Torrepaduli in [[Salento]], Apulia, a  traditional summer event for tambourines and ''[[pizzica|pizziche]]''. Her former husband's name was Dario Bollini.&lt;ref name="inserra2"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Inserra|first1=Incoronata Nadia|editor1-last=Ruberto|editor1-first=Laura E.|editor2-last=Sciorra|editor2-first=Joseph|title=New Italian Migrations to the United States:  Vol. 2: Art and Culture since 1945|date=2017|publisher=University of Illinois Press|location=Champaign|isbn=9780252082917|jstor=10.5406/j.ctt1ws7w5x|chapter=Performing in the Italian American "Translation Zone": Alessandra Belloni's Tarantella}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
The traditional dance she teaches is presented as an ancient healing ritual for women suffering from repressed sexuality, abuse, powerlessness, and the feeling of being caught in a web that binds them. Belloni emphasizes that tarantella music and dance, as popularly known today around the world, is different from its origins in Apulian folk culture, going back to the ancient Greeks. The "spider bite" or ''tarantismo'', being psychosexual injury, formerly called [[hysteria]], affects women with depression and loneliness, and can be healed by drumming and dancing the ancient ''pizzica tarantata.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brooks|first1=Iris|title=Alessandra Belloni|journal=Percussion Source|date=1996|volume=1|issue=2|pages=26–29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Alessandra Belloni and the Daughters of Cybele|journal=Percussive Notes|date=September 2013|pages=18–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Belloni teaches that a woman suffering from such "bite" is called a ''tarantata'', and the music and dance for healing it is called ''[[pizzica]]'', referring to the spider's bite. By dancing oneself into ecstatic [[trance]] with the support of the community, a sufferer seeks to expel the "venom" and be restored to health.

Belloni has integrated her work studying women's therapeutic dance and drumming with traditions of the [[Black Madonna]] in several countries, including the Madonna of [[Montevergine]] in [[Campania]]. Like many before her, she connects devotion to the Black Madonna with pre-Christian&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Inserra|first1=Incoronata|title=Global Tarantella: Reinventing Southern Italian Folk Music and Dances|date=2017|publisher=University of Illinois Press|location=Champaign|isbn=9780252099892|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S6Y6DwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PT13&amp;dq=%22alessandra%20belloni%22&amp;pg=PT18#v=onepage&amp;q=%22alessandra%20belloni%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Goddess]] worship dating back to the ancient Greeks, who colonized Apulia as part of [[Magna Graecia]] long before the rise of Rome.

Belloni has brought into her art influences from song and drumming of Brazil, invoking [[Yemanjá]] and [[Oshun]]. For example, in "Canto di Sant'Irene" she sings "''In Calabria è Maria / Yemanjá è a Bahia''" ('In [[Calabria]] she is Mary; she is Yemanjá in [[Bahia]]'). In connection with Yemanjá, Belloni plays the Remo ocean drum, which produces ocean wave-like sounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Daughters of Cybele Women Percussion Ensemble|url=http://www.dromnyc.com/events/2886/daughters-of-cybele-women-percussion-ensemble|website=dromNYC|accessdate=January 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to revivifying traditional music, she has composed an oeuvre of original songs inspired by Black Madonnas and others on Brazilian themes, as well as love songs after the Italian tradition. She has also worked to integrate her music with [[African drumming]], saying: "It appeals to me, because I do believe that this form of music therapy and this healing drumming originated in Southern Italy, but in the history most of it comes from Africa, because Africa is closer to us than Northern Europe. All of this connected in the ancient times, and it makes a lot of sense to do it now in America, because it really is like continuing the normal evolution of this music."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wald|first1=Elijah|authorlink1=Elijah Wald|title=Alessandra Belloni|url=http://www.elijahwald.com/eurarch.html#belloni|accessdate=January 4, 2018|work=Boston Globe|date=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Belloni conducts dance therapy workshops, titled "Rhythm is the Cure," in New York, Italy, and other places in the United States and Europe. Participants dress in white with red sashes. Since 2009, she has led a New York City troupe of women drummers named the Daughters of Cybele.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Masone|first1=Carolyn|title=Daughters of Cybele Fire Up a Winter Night at Casa Italiana NYU|url=http://www.essenceofitaly.net/journal/2014/01/daughters_of_cybele_fire_up_a.php|website=Essence of Italy|date=January 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Belloni's stage shows ''Rhythm Is the Cure'' and ''Tarantella Spider Dance'' are productions combining music, ''tammuriata'' dance and drumming, drama, [[fire dance]], and [[aerial dance]]. ''Spider Dance'' starts with the birth of Spider Woman and traces the development of ''pizzica tarantata'' tradition from ancient Greek rituals of [[Cybele]] and [[Dionysus]] to Italian folk tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Dance News Desk|title=Alessandra Belloni's Tarantella: Spider Dance Has Limited Run At TNC|url=https://www.broadwayworld.com/bwwdance/article/Alessandra-Bellonis-TARANTELLA-SPIDER-DANCE-Has-Limited-Run-At-TNC-20101220|website=BWW Dance World|publisher=Broadway World|accessdate=November 30, 2017|location=New York|date=December 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''anastomosis''' (plural '''anastomoses''') is a connection or opening between two things (especially cavities or passages) that are normally diverging or branching, such as between [[blood vessel]]s, [[leaf#Veins|leaf vein]]s, or [[stream]]s. Such a connection may be normal (such as the [[foramen ovale (heart)|foramen ovale in a fetus's heart]]) or abnormal (such as the [[atrial septal defect#Patent foramen ovale|patent foramen ovale]] in an adult's heart); it may be acquired (such as an [[arteriovenous fistula]]) or innate (such as the arteriovenous shunt of a [[metarteriole]]); and it may be natural (such as the aforementioned examples) or artificial (such as a [[surgical anastomosis]]). The reestablishment of an anastomosis that had become blocked is called a reanastomosis. Anastomoses that are abnormal, whether [[congenital disorder|congenital]] or acquired, are often called [[fistula]]s.

The term is used in [[medicine]], [[biology]], [[mycology]], [[geology]], [[geography]] and [[architecture]].

==Etymology==
Anastomosis: medical or Modern Latin, from Greek ἀναστόμωσις, anastomosis, "outlet, opening", Gr ana- "up, on, upon", stoma "mouth", "to furnish with a mouth".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=anastomosis&amp;allowed_in_frame=0 Online Etymology Dictionary] Douglas Harper&lt;/ref&gt; Thus the ''-stom-'' syllable is cognate with that of [[stoma|''stoma'' in botany]] or [[stoma (medicine)|''stoma'' in medicine]].

==Medicine==
[[File:Gray1083.png|thumb|right|A network of blood vessels]]
An anastomosis is the connection of two normally divergent structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author1=Gylys, Barbara A.  |author2=Mary Ellen Wedding|title=Medical Terminology Systems|publisher=F.A. Davis Company|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; It refers to connections between [[blood vessel]]s or between other tubular structures such as loops of [[intestine]].

===Circulatory===
In [[circulatory anastomosis|circulatory anastomoses]], many arteries naturally anastomose with each other; for example, the [[inferior epigastric artery]] and [[superior epigastric artery]], or the anterior and/or posterior communicating arteries in the [[Circle of Willis]] in the brain. The circulatory anastomosis is further divided into arterial and venous anastomosis. Arterial anastomosis includes actual arterial anastomosis (e.g., [[Deep palmar arch|palmar arch]], [[plantar arch]]) and potential arterial anastomosis (e.g. [[coronary arteries]] and cortical branch of [[cerebral arteries]]). Anastomoses also form alternative routes around [[capillary]] beds in areas that don't need a large blood supply, thus helping regulate [[Systemic circulation|systemic blood flow]].

===Surgical===
An example of [[surgical anastomosis]] occurs when a segment of [[intestine]], blood vessel, or any other structure are connected together (anastomosed). Examples include intestinal anastomosis, [[Roux-en-Y anastomosis]] or [[ureteroureterostomy]].  Surgical anastamosis techniques include Linear Stapled Anastomosis,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.sages.org/wiki/laparoscopic-anastomotic-techniques/|title=Laparoscopic Anastomotic Techniques - A SAGES Wiki Article|work=SAGES|access-date=2018-06-28|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hand Sewn Anastomosis,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; End-to-End Anastomosis (EEA).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Akelina|first=Yelena|date=2014-03-31|title=Microsurgical Technique for 1mm Vessel End to End Anastomosis|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.24296/jomi/2|journal=Journal of Medical Insight|language=en-US|volume=2014|issue=3|doi=10.24296/jomi/2|issn=2373-6003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anastomosis can be performed by hand or with an anastomosis assist device.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kikuchi|first=Keita|last2=Tambara|first2=Keiichi|last3=Yamamoto|first3=Taira|last4=Yamasaki|first4=Motoshige|last5=Hirose|first5=Hitoshi|last6=Amano|first6=Atsushi|date=2010|title=The Use of Enclose®II Anastomosis Assist Device for the Proximal Coronary Branch Anastomosis to Vascular Graft|journal=Annals of Vascular Diseases|volume=3|issue=1|pages=84–86|doi=10.3400/avd.AVDhdi08023|issn=1881-641X|pmc=3595814|pmid=23555395}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have been performed comparing various anastomosis approaches taking into account surgical "time and cost, postoperative anastomotic bleeding, leakage, and stricture".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yao|first=Libin|last2=Li|first2=Chao|last3=Zhu|first3=Xiaocheng|last4=Shao|first4=Yong|last5=Meng|first5=Song|last6=Shi|first6=Linsen|last7=Wang|first7=Hui|date=2016-11-26|title=An Effective New Intestinal Anastomosis Method|journal=Medical Science Monitor : International Medical Journal of Experimental and Clinical Research|volume=22|pages=4570–4576|doi=10.12659/MSM.902000|issn=1234-1010|pmc=5138069|pmid=27888280}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pathological===
[[Pathology|Pathological]] anastomosis results from [[Trauma (medicine)|trauma]] or [[disease]] and may involve [[vein]]s, [[artery|arteries]], or [[intestines]]. These are usually referred to as [[fistula]]s. In the cases of veins or arteries, traumatic fistulas usually occur between artery and vein. Traumatic intestinal fistulas usually occur between two loops of intestine (entero-enteric fistula) or intestine and [[skin]] (enterocutaneous fistula). [[Portacaval anastomosis]], by contrast, is an anastomosis between a vein of the [[portal circulation]] and a vein of the [[systemic circulation]], which allows blood to bypass the [[liver]] in patients with [[portal hypertension]], often resulting in [[hemorrhoids]], [[esophageal varices]], or [[caput medusae]].

==Biology==

===Evolution===
In [[evolution]], anastomosis is a recombination of evolutionary lineage. Conventional accounts of evolutionary lineage present themselves as the simple branching out of species into novel forms.  Under anastomosis, species might recombine after initial branching out, such as in the case of recent research that shows that ancestral populations along human and chimpanzee lineages may have interbred after an initial branching event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Patterson | first = Nick |date=May 2006 | title = Genetic evidence for complex speciation of humans and chimpanzees | journal = Nature | volume = 441 | pages = 1103–1108 | doi = 10.1038/nature04789 | url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v441/n7097/abs/nature04789.html | accessdate = 2006-09-18 | pmid = 16710306 | issue = 7097 |display-authors=etal| bibcode = 2006Natur.441.1103P }}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of anastomosis also applies to the theory of [[symbiogenesis]], in which new [[species]] emerge from the formation of novel symbiotic relationships.

===Mycology===
In [[mycology]], anastomosis is the fusion between branches of the same or different [[hyphae]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author =Kendrick, Bryce|title=The Fifth Kingdom|publisher=Mycologue Publications|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence the bifurcating fungal hyphae can form true reticulating networks. By sharing materials in the form of dissolved [[ions]], [[hormones]], and [[nucleotides]], the fungus maintains bidirectional communication with itself. The fungal network might begin from several origins; several spores (''i.e.'' by means of [[conidial anastomosis tubes]]), several points of penetration, each a spreading circumference of absorption and assimilation. Once encountering the tip of another expanding, exploring self, the tips press against each other in [[pheromone|pheromonal]] recognition or by an unknown recognition system, fusing to form a genetic singular clonal colony that can cover hectares called a [[Genet (biology)|genet]] or just microscopical areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Glass L. |author2=Rasmussen C. |author3=Roca M.G. |author4=Read N. | year = 2004 | title = Hyphal homing, fusion and mycelial interconnectedness | url = | journal = Trends in Microbiology | volume = 12 | issue = 3| pages = 135–141 | doi=10.1016/j.tim.2004.01.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For fungi, anastomosis is also a component of reproduction. In some fungi, two different [[haploid]] mating types – if compatible – merge. [[Soma (biology)|Somatically]], they form a morphologically similar mycelial wave front that continues to grow and explore. The significant difference, is that each [[septum|septated]] unit is binucleate, containing two unfused [[cell nucleus|nuclei]], i.e., one from each parent that eventually undergoes [[karyogamy]] and meiosis to complete the sexual cycle.

Also the term "anastomosing" is used for mushroom gills which interlink and separate to form a network.&lt;ref name=Bon&gt;{{cite book |author =Marcel Bon |title=The Mushrooms and Toadstools of Britain and North-Western Europe |publisher=Hodder &amp; Stoughton |year=1987 |page=14 |isbn=0-340-39935-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geology==
In [[geology]], anastomosis refers to [[quartz]] (or other) [[Vein (geology)|veins]] displaying this property, which is often related to [[Shear (geology)|shearing]] in [[Metamorphism|metamorphic]] regions.{{Citation needed|reason=Though geologic context can easily be inferred, a reliable reference would help.|date=October 2016}}

==Geography==

Anastomosing streams consist of multiple channels that divide and reconnect and are separated by semi-permanent banks formed of cohesive material, such that they are unlikely to migrate from one channel position to another. They can be confused with braiding, the splitting of a river by sand bars or hard rocks and some definitions require that an  anastomosing river be made up of interconnected channels that enclose floodbasins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Anastomosing rivers: a review of their classification, origin and sedimentary products| author=Makaske, Bart| journal=Earth-Science Reviews| volume=53| issue=3–4| year=2001| pages=149–196|url=http://www.geo.arizona.edu/geo5xx/geos544/pdfs/fluvial/makaske.pdf| doi=10.1016/s0012-8252(00)00038-6| bibcode=2001ESRv...53..149M}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rivers with anastomosed reaches include the [[Magdalena River]] in [[Colombia]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/0037-0738(86)90058-8|title=Anastomosing river deposits, sedimentation rates and basin subsidence, Magdalena River, northwestern Colombia, South America|year=1986|last1=Smith|first1=D|journal=[[Sedimentary Geology (journal)|Sedimentary Geology]]|volume=46|pages=177–196|issue=3–4|bibcode=1986SedG...46..177S}}&lt;/ref&gt; the upper [[Columbia River]] in [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]],&lt;ref&gt;Abbado, D., Slingerland, R.L., and Smith, N.D., 2005, The origin of anastomosis in the upper Columbia River, British Columbia, Canada: In Blum, M.D., Marriott, S., and Leclair.

==Biography==
Gare is the son of Frank Gare ISO,&lt;ref name="frank-nla-papers"&gt;[http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/3510550?lookfor=Frank%20Gare&amp;offset=1&amp;max=4 see National Library of Australia: "Papers of Frank Gare"]&lt;/ref&gt; former Commissioner for Native Welfare and Regional Director of Aboriginal Affairs in Western Australia, and [[Nene Gare]],&lt;ref name="nene-nla-papers"&gt;[http://www.nla.gov.au/ms/findaids/8294.html see National Library of Australia: "Papers of Nene Gare"]&lt;/ref&gt; author of ''[[The Fringe Dwellers]]''&lt;ref name="fringe"&gt;[http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/2273517 see National Library of Australia entry], Nene Gare: The Fringe Dwellers, Sun Books, Melbourne, 1966.&lt;/ref&gt; and other novels. He is also the brother of [[Shelley Gare]], an Australian author and journalist.

Gare attended [[Applecross Senior High School]],&lt;ref name=ecu&gt;{{cite web|last1=Squarcini|first1=Rosina|title=Nene Gare, a Biographical Study : Australian Novelist, 1919-1994|url=http://ro.ecu.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1546&amp;context=theses_hons|website=Research Online|publisher=Edith Cowan University|accessdate=23 November 2016|location=Mt Lawley, WA|date=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; then graduated from the [[University of Western Australia]] with a BA (Hons) in philosophy. He then wrote his PhD, ("Science, Process Philosophy and the Image of Man: the metaphysical foundations for a critical social science"&lt;ref name="phd"&gt;[http://researchrepository.murdoch.edu.au/4155/ PhD thesis]&lt;/ref&gt;), at [[Murdoch University]] in which he formed his version of process metaphysics. On the basis of this he won a Postdoctoral [[Fulbright Fellowship]] to [[Boston University]]. Gare has taught at Murdoch University, [[University of Queensland]], [[Curtin University]] and Swinburne University. In 2006 he was a Keynote Speaker to the 6th International Whitehead Conference at [[Salzburg University]], Austria, delivering a paper entitled: "Reviving the Radical Enlightenment".&lt;ref name="conf"&gt;[http://www2.sbg.ac.at/whiteheadconference/index2.html International Whitehead Conference 3–6 July 2006, University of Salzburg] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070811225941/http://www2.sbg.ac.at/whiteheadconference/index2.html |date=11 August 2007 }}, see Keynotes/Abstracts/Arran Gare.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently he has aligned himself with Chinese environmentalists in the quest to create a global ecological civilisation.

==Research==
Gare's work is mainly in [[environmental philosophy]], the history and philosophy of science, philosophy of culture and the metaphysics of [[process philosophy]]. In 1983 with Robert Elliot he published Environmental Philosophy, one of the first anthologies in this field. In 1993 he published'' Nihilism Incorporated: European Civilization and Environmental Destruction'' and ''Beyond European Civilization: Marxism, Process Philosophy and the Environment'', and then in 1995 ''Postmodernism and the Environmental Crisis.'' In these works he attempted to explain the ascendance, world domination and environmental destructiveness of European civilisation, the failure of orthodox [[Marxism]] as practised in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe to provide a real alternative to this, and the ineffectuality of deconstructive [[postmodernism]] in the face of the ecological crisis confronting humanity, while offering a different path into the future based on a synthesis of process metaphysics, neo-Aristotelian ethics, neo-[[Hegel]]ian political philosophy and eco-Marxism. In 1996 he published ''Nihilism Inc.: Environmental Destruction and the Metaphysics of Sustainability.  ''

In more recent work Gare has published in the fields of narratology, hermeneutics, semiotics, complexity theory, theoretical biology, human ecology and philosophical anthropology, Schelling's philosophy, Chinese philosophy and Christopher Alexander's theories of architecture, and called for a revival of the Radical Enlightenment as the true heir of the Renaissance struggle for democracy and for the creation of an ecological civilisation as a new world order based on a new relationship between humanity and nature. More specifically, he has been concerned to revive and reformulate on naturalistic foundations the ethics and political philosophy of the liberal socialists inspired by T.H. Green, develop more adequate theoretical foundations for human ecology and ecological economics to provide an alternative to neo-classical economics as the core discipline for formulating public policy, and develop a form of retrospective path analysis as an alternative to cost-benefit analysis as a framework for formulating such policy. These ideas have been synthesised in his book ''The Philosophical Foundations of Ecological Civilization: A manifesto for the future'' published in 2016. Such work revives the traditional ambitions of philosophy, and as such, is a challenge to philosophy’s current marginalization. In defence of his conception of philosophy he has worked to revive the tradition of speculative naturalism, an outcome of which has been the publication in 2017 of the anthology ''For a New Naturalism'', co-edited with Wayne Hudson.  

A critical review of his work has been made from within the domain of process philosophy by McLaren.&lt;ref name="mclaren"&gt;Glenn McLaren, 'Unifying Process Philosophy: Secular Metaphysics and Fragmentary Influences’, ''Applied Process Thought I: Initial Explorations in Theory and Research.'' Ed. Mark Dibben and Thomas Kelly, Frankfurt: Ontos Verlag, 2008, pp.43–109.&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Cosmos and History''==
He is the founder and a chief editor of the online journal ''[http://www.cosmosandhistory.org/index.php/journal/index Cosmos and History: The Journal of Natural and Social Philosophy]'' ({{ISSN|1832-9101}}) which is a peer-reviewed, open-access journal of natural and social philosophy. Quoting the journal: "It serves those who see philosophy's vocation in questioning and challenging prevailing assumptions about ourselves and our place in the world, developing new ways of thinking about physical existence, life, humanity and society, so helping to create the future insofar as thought affects the issue. Philosophy so conceived is not exclusively identified with the work of professional philosophers, and the journal welcomes contributions from philosophically oriented thinkers from all disciplines."

An '''astrological age''' is a time period in astrologic [[theology]] which [[astrologer]]s claim parallels major changes in the development of Earth's inhabitants, particularly relating to culture, society, and politics. There are twelve [[astrology|astrological]] ages corresponding to the twelve [[Zodiac|zodiacal signs]] in [[western astrology]]. Advocates believe that when one cycle of the twelve astrological ages is completed,  another cycle of twelve ages begins.&lt;ref&gt;Neil Spencer, ''True as the Stars Above'', Victor Gollancz London, 2000, p. 116. {{ISBN|978-0575067691}} &lt;/ref&gt; The length of one cycle of twelve ages is 25,860 years.&lt;ref&gt;Billy Meier's Contact Report 9, sentence № 186. ''[http://www.futureofmankind.co.uk/Billy_Meier/Contact_Report_9]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Some astrologers believe that during a given age, some events are directly caused or indirectly influenced by the [[astrological sign]] associated with that age, while other astrologers believe the different astrological ages do not influence events in any way.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Tarnas, ''Cosmos and Psyche - Intimations of a New World View'', Viking/Penguin, New York, 2006, pp. 50–60&lt;/ref&gt;

Astrologers do not agree upon exact dates for the beginning or ending of the ages, with given dates varying hundreds of years.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Campion, ''The Book of World Horoscopes'', The Wessex Astrologer, Bournemouth, Great Britain, 1998, pp. 480–495&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
[[File:Astro signs.svg|thumb|300px|The traditional western Zodiac signs.]]
There are three broad perspectives on the astrological ages:

# [[archeoastronomy|Archeoastronomers]] are interested in the ages because some researchers believe that ancient civilizations often depicted cultural references to the ages. Archeoastronomers in general do not 'believe' in astrology, but they study the cultural traditions of societies that did refer extensively to astrology.
# Astrologers have been interested in relating world history to the astrological ages since the late 19th century;&lt;ref&gt;Neil Spencer, ''True as the Stars Above'', Victor Gollancz London, 2000, p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; however, most astrologers study horoscopes, not astrological ages.
# The general public has become aware of the Age of Aquarius since it was publicized in the musical ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Neil Spencer, ''True as the Stars Above'', Victor Gollancz London, 2000, pp. 124–5&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contentious aspects of the astrological ages===
Definitive details on the astrological ages are lacking, and consequently most details available about the astrological ages are disputed. The 20th century British astrologer [[Charles E. O. Carter|Charles Carter]] stated that

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"''It is probable that there is no branch of Astrology upon which more nonsense has been poured forth than the doctrine of the precession of the equinoxes.''" ([[precession of the equinoxes]] as the root cause of the astrological ages)&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Campion, ''The Book of World Horoscopes'', The Wessex Astrologer, Bournemouth, Great Britain, 1999, p. 485&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt; In 2000 Neil Spencer in his book ''True as the Stars Above'' expressed a similar opinion about the astrological ages. Spencer singles out the astrological ages as being "fuzzy", "speculative", and the least-defined area of astrological lore.&lt;ref&gt;Neil Spencer, ''True as the Stars Above - Adventures in Modern Astrology'', Victor Gollancz, London, 2000, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; Derek and Julia Parker claim that it is impossible to state the exact date for the start of any astrological age and acknowledge that many astrologers believe the Age of Aquarius has arrived while many claim the world is at the end of the Age of Pisces.&lt;ref&gt;Derek &amp; Julia Parker, Parkers' Encyclopedia of astrology, Watkins Publishing, London, 2009, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

Ray Grasse states in ''Signs of the Times - Unlocking the Symbolic Language of World Events'' that "there is considerable dispute over the exact starting and ending times for the different Great Ages."&lt;ref&gt;Ray Grasse, ''Signs of the Times - Unlocking the Symbolic Language of World Events'', Hampton Roads Publishing Company Inc, Charlottesville, Virginia, 2002, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Wright in ''The Great Ages and Other Astrological Cycles'' believes that much of the uncertainty related to the astrological ages is because many astrologers have a poor understanding of the meaning of the astrological symbolism and "even poorer historical knowledge".&lt;ref&gt;Paul Wright, ''The Great Ages and other astrological cycles'', Parlando Press, Edinburgh, 2007, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consensus approach to the astrological ages===
Though so many issues are contentious or disputed, there are two aspects of the astrological ages that have virtually unanimous consensus—firstly, the claimed link of the astrological ages to the axial precession of the Earth and commonly referred to as ''precession of the equinoxes'';&lt;ref&gt;Neil Spencer, ''True as the Stars above'', Victor Gollancz London, 2000, p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; secondly, that, due to the nature of the precession of the equinoxes, the progression of the ages proceeds in reverse direction through the zodiacal signs.&lt;ref&gt;Terry MacKinnell, ''A New Look at the Old Ages'', NCGR Member Newsletter, National Council for Geocosmic Research Inc., June–July 2002, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ages of equal or variable lengths===
Astrologers use many ways to divide the Great Year into twelve astrological ages. There are two popular methods. One method is to divide the Great Year into twelve astrological ages of approximately equal lengths of around 2160 years per age based on the [[vernal equinox]] moving through the [[sidereal zodiac]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles E. O. Carter|Charles Carter]], ''An Introduction to Political Astrology (Mundane Astrology)'', The Camelot Press, Great Britain, 1973, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; Another method is to significantly vary the duration of each astrological age based on the passage of the [[vernal equinox]] measured against the actual [[zodiacal constellations]].&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Campion, ''The Book of World Horoscopes'', The Wessex Astrologer, 1999, p. 489 clearly refers to both conventions adopted by many astrologers basing the Ages on either the zodiacal constellations or the sidereal signs.&lt;/ref&gt; Each of those twelve sections of the Great Year can be called either an astrological age, Precessional Age or a Great Month.&lt;ref&gt;Marcia Moore &amp; Mark Douglas, ''Astrology, The Divine Science'', Arcane Publications, York Harbour, Maine USA, 1971, p. 676&lt;/ref&gt;

The method based on the zodiacal constellations has a flaw in that the stars of many constellations overlap. For example, by 2700 the vernal point will have moved into Aquarius, but due to overlap the vernal point will also point to Pisces.&lt;ref&gt;Ray Grass ''Signs of the Times'', Hampton Roads Publishing Company Inc, 2002, p. 263&lt;/ref&gt;

===Age transitions===
Many astrologers consider the entrance into a new astrological age a gradual transition called a "cusp". For example, Ray Grasse states that an astrological age does not begin at an exact day or year.&lt;ref&gt;Ray Grasse, ''Signs of the Times - Unlocking the Symbolic Language of World Events'', Hampton Roads Publishing Company Inc, Charlottesville, Virginia, 2002, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Wright states that a transition effect does occur at the border of the astrological ages. Consequently, the beginning of any age cannot be defined to a single year or a decade but blend its influences with the previous age for a period of time until the new age can stand in its own right.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Wright, ''The Great Ages and Other Astrological Cycles'', Parlando Press, Edinburgh, 2007, pp. 7–8&lt;/ref&gt; 

Many astrologers believe that the world is transitioning from the Pisces and Aquarian Ages &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url = http://www.aquariuspapers.com/astrology/2015/01/are-we-in-the-age-of-aquarius-or-still-in-the-age-of-pisces.html
| title = Are We In The Age of Aquarius Or Still In The Age of Pisces?
| work = Aquarius Papers
| accessdate = 2018-04-13
}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which is claimed to explain that developments in the world today can be aligned to Pisces (i.e. continuing strong religious influences especially from Christianity) and Aquarius (traditional [[archetypes]] associated with Aquarius include electricity, computers, and democracy) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| url = http://astrologyclub.org/aquarius-archetype/
| title = The Archetype of Aquarius
| work = Astrology Club
| accessdate = 2018-04-13
}}&lt;/ref&gt;. A few astrologers consider the last c. 10 degrees of a given age (c. 720 years) as the time period during which the new age starts to make visible its influences, also called "orb of influence". In [[Nicholas Campion]]'s ''The Book of World Horoscopes'' there are six pages listing researchers and their proposed dates for the start of the Age of Aquarius indicating that many researchers believe that each age commences at an exact date.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Campion, ''The Book of World Horoscopes'', The Wessex Astrologer, Bournemouth UK, 1999, pp. 489–495&lt;/ref&gt;

Albert Amao Ph.D. states that the transition period between any two ages is based on one degrees either side of the point of intersection of two adjoining zodiacal constellations. As one degree is approximately 72 years, Amao has a transition period between ages of 144 years.&lt;ref&gt;Albert Amao, ''Aquarian Age &amp; The Andean Prophecy'', AuthorHouse, 2007, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other opinions on the astrological ages===

====Ages exactly 2,000 years each====
Many astrologers find ages too erratic based on either the vernal point moving through the randomly sized zodiacal constellations or sidereal zodiac and, instead, round all astrological ages to exactly 2000 years each. In this approach the ages are usually neatly aligned so that the Aries age is found from 2000 BC to AD 1, Pisces age AD 1 to AD 2000, the Aquarian Age AD 2000 - AD 4000, and so on.&lt;ref&gt;Neil Spencer, ''True as the Stars Above'', Victor Gollancz London, 2000, p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; This approach is inconsistent with the precession of the equinoxes. Based on precession of the equinoxes, there is a one-degree shift approximately every 72 years, so a 30-degree movement requires 2160 years to complete.

====Ages involving the opposite sign====
An established school of thought that an age is also influenced by the sign opposite to the one of the astrological age. Referring back to the precession of the Equinoxes, as the Sun crosses one constellation in the Northern Hemisphere's spring Equinox (March 21), it will cross the opposite sign in the spring Equinox in the Southern Hemisphere (September 21). For instance, the Age of Pisces is complemented by its opposite astrological sign of [[Virgo (astrology)|Virgo]] (the Virgin); so a few refer to the Piscean age as the 'Age of Pisces-Virgo'.&lt;ref&gt;Derek &amp; Julia Parker, Parkers' Encyclopedia of Astrology, Watkins Publishing, London, 2009, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Adopting this approach, the Age of Aquarius would become the Age of Aquarius-Leo. Ray Grasse also claims that each sign of the zodiac is involving with the opposite sign.&lt;ref&gt;Ray Grasse, ''Signs of the Times - Unlocking the Symbolic Language of World Events'', Hampton Roads Publishing Company Inc, Charlottesville, Virginia, 2002, pp. 113–127&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mayan Long Count Calendar &amp; Precession====
{{See|Mesoamerican Long Count calendar}}

William Sullivan in ''The Secret of the Incas'' claims there is a direct connection between the history of the [[Inca Empire]] and [[precession of the equinoxes]]. [[John Major Jenkins]] in 'Maya Cosmogenesis 2012' believes that the [[Mayan Long Count Calendar]] is based on precession of the equinoxes and solstices.&lt;ref&gt;Albert Amao, ''Aquarian Age &amp; The Andean Prophecy'', AuthorHouse, 2007, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Jenkins believes that the Maya related the precession of the winter solstice sunrise against the Milky Way—an event which is currently developing and supposedly instrumental in mankind's spiritual renewal.&lt;ref&gt;Albert Amao, ''Aquarian Age &amp; The Andean Prophecy'', AuthorHouse, 2007, pp. 57–8&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the Astrological Ages==

===Hipparchus===
The great demarcation point in the history of the astrological ages is around 127 BC when the Greek astronomer-astrologer [[Hipparchus]] from observation discovered that the great immovable sphere of fixed stars was not fixed but slowly moving eastwards due to what is now known as [[precession of the equinoxes]]. It is possible that some other astronomers before Hipparchus had also noticed the phenomenon, but it is Hipparchus who is credited with this discovery. 

This discovery by Hipparchus is not entirely unexpected as Hipparchus is considered to have been the greatest observational astronomer in his time and up until [[Tycho Brahe]] in the 16th century AD. What is highly contentious in modern times is the claim by many that observation of the effects of precession of the equinoxes was known well before the time of Hipparchus and his contemporaries in Greece or even Mesopotamia. The academic answer is no – [[precession of the equinoxes]] was unknown in earlier times.

===Possible pre-Hipparchian recognition of precession===
[[Giorgio de Santillana]] (1902 – 1974) became professor of the History of Science in the School of Humanities at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] in 1954, and along with Hertha von Dechend they published a book entitled ''Hamlet's Mill, An Essay on Myth and the Frame of Time'' in 1969. It was an attempt to marry science and mythology that had become separated by the ancient Greeks. Santillana and von Dechend believed that the old mythological stories handed down from antiquity were not random fictitious tales but were accurate depictions of celestial cosmology clothed in tales to aid their oral transmission. The chaos, monsters, and violence in ancient myths are representative of the forces that shape each age. They believed that ancient myths are the remains of preliterate astronomy that became lost with the rise of the Greco-Roman civilization.

Santillana and von Dechend state that ancient myths have no historical basis but a cosmological one based on a primitive form of astrology. They recognized the importance of the heliacally rising constellation as markers for the astrological ages and claimed that knowledge of this phenomenon had been known for thousands of years previously. They claim that to understand ancient thinking it is necessary to understand astrology, not the modern sun-sign or horoscopic astrology, but the astrology of ancient times which was the ''[[lingua franca]]'' of ancient times.&lt;ref&gt;Giorgio de Santillana &amp; Hertha von Dechend, "Hamlet's Mill", David R Godine, Boston, publisher, 1977, pp. 50, 59, 66, 74, 120, 142–3, 146&lt;/ref&gt;

They go further and state that our knowledge of the dawn of astrology and its relationship to ancient myths and star names is limited, and only extends back to about 2100 BC, which was during the Renaissance of Sumerian Culture; we are not able, they say, to examine older material on the subject. In ''Hamlet's Mill'' it is claimed that the ancient Greeks knew of three successive destructions that correlate to three ages, and that since the beginning of history the vernal point has moved through Taurus, Aries, and Pisces. Hesiod in ''Works and Days'' refers to five successive ages.&lt;ref&gt;Giorgio de Santillana &amp; Hertha von Dechend, "Hamlet's Mill", David R Godine, Boston, publisher, 1977, pp. 50, 59, 66, 74, 120, 142–3, 146&lt;/ref&gt;

As early as 1811, modern researchers were examining evidence for knowledge of precession of the equinoxes and astrological ages before Hipparchus. Sir [[William Drummond of Logiealmond|William Drummond]] published ''Oedipus Judaicus - Allegory in the Old Testament'' in 1811. Drummond expounds on his hypothesis that a greater part of the Hebrew Scriptures are merely allegorical writings that hide the true content. Furthermore, the Orientalists were mainly concerned with astronomy and most of their ancient myths are really disguised astronomical records.&lt;ref&gt;William Drummond, ''Oedipus Judaicus - Allegory in the Old Testament'', Bracken Books, London, 1996 (first published 2011), p xix, 159&lt;/ref&gt; Drummond believed that the 49th chapter of Genesis contains prophecies allied to astronomy and that the twelve tribes of Israel represented the 12 zodiacal signs.&lt;ref&gt;William Drummond, "Oedipus Judaicus - Allegory in the Old Testament", Bracken Books, London, 1996 (first published 2011), p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; 

Drummond makes his case that at the time of [[Abraham]], the [[Amorites]] first recorded the shift from the Age of Taurus to the Age of Aries as represented by the year commencing with the Ram (Aries) rather than the bull (Taurus). The [[Book of Joshua]] indicates that by the time of [[Moses]] the equinoxes had already shifted from [[Taurus (astrology)|Taurus]] to [[Aries (astrology)|Aries]], as [[Moses]] had ordained that the civil year should commence with the month of [[Nisan]] (Aries) rather than the month of Taurus. The feast of the [[Passover]] is probably a celebration of the Age of Aries with the Paschal Lamb representative of Aries, traditionally associated with the symbol of the ram or sheep.&lt;ref&gt;William Drummond, "Oedipus Judaicus - Allegory in the Old Testament", Bracken Books, London, 1996 (first published 2011), p. 193&lt;/ref&gt; 

Drummond also hypothesizes that most number references in ancient texts were coded to hide their real value by multiples of 1,000. For example, in the [[Old Testament]] [[Joshua]] commanded 30,000 men, and he slew 12,000 inhabitants of the city of Ai. The historian [[Berossus|Berosus]] stated the Babylonians commenced astronomical observations 49,000 years (7 x 7 x 1000) before Alexander the Great.&lt;ref&gt;William Drummond, "Oedipus Judaicus - Allegory in the Old Testament", Bracken Books, London, 1996 (first published 2011), pp. 223, 225&lt;/ref&gt; Most early references were related to 7 (Sun, Moon, and five visible planets), 12 (number of zodiacal signs and months per year), 30 (degrees per sign of the zodiac), and higher combinations of these numbers and other numbers associated with astronomical observations and astrology.

The problem of understanding the exact nature of ancient astrology is that it was only partly documented, leaving the question of the extent of their undocumented astrological knowledge. Michael Baigent in ''From the Omens of Babylon: Astrology and Ancient Mesopotamia'' suggests that there is evidence that there was probably an older or parallel oral tradition of astrology at the time of publication of [[Enuma Anu Enlil]]&lt;ref&gt;Michael Baigent, ''From the Omens of Babylon: Astrology and Ancient Mesopotamia'', Penguin Books, 1994, pp. 55–6, 65,71&lt;/ref&gt; believed published over the period (1595–1157 BC). The ancient Mesopotamians believed that history repeated itself after a massive cycle of many years.&lt;ref&gt;"From the Omens of Babylon: Astrology and Ancient Mesopotamia, Penguin Books, 1994, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-Hipparchus===

====Trepidation====
In the early post-[[Hipparchus]] period, two schools of thought developed about the slow shift of the fixed sphere of stars as discovered by [[Hipparchus]]. One school believed that at 1 degree shift per 100 years, the sphere of fixed stars would return to its starting point after 36,000 years. The [[trepidation (astronomy)|trepidation]] school believed that the fixed stars first moved one way, then moved the other way - similar to a giant pendulum. It was believed that the 'swinging' stars first moved 8 degrees one direction, then reversed this 8 degrees travelling the other direction. 

Theon of Alexandria in the 4th century AD includes trepidation when he wrote ''Small Commentary to the Handy Tables''. In the 5th century AD, the [[Greeks|Greek]] [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonist]] philosopher [[Proclus]] mentions that both theories were being discussed. The Indians around the 5th century AD preferred the trepidation theory but because they had observed the movement of the fixed stars by 25 degrees since ancient times (since around 1325 BC), they considered that trepidation swung back and forth around 27 degrees.

The significant early exponent of the 'circular 36,000' years method was [[Ptolemy]] and, due to the status placed upon [[Ptolemy]] by later scholars, the Christian and Muslim astronomers of the [[Middle Ages]] accepted the [[Great Year]] of 36,000 years rather than trepidation. However some scholars gave credence to both theories based on the addition of another sphere which is represented in the [[Alfonsine tables]] produced by the [[Toledo School of Translators]] in the 12th and 13th centuries. The [[Alfonsine tables]] computed the positions of the sun, moon, and planets relative to the fixed stars. The Italian astronomer [[Cecco d'Ascoli]], professor of astrology at the University of Bologna in the early 14th century, continued to have faith in trepidation but believed it swung 10 degrees in either direction. [[Copernicus]] refers to trepidation in ''De revolutionibus orbium coelestium'' published in 1543.&lt;ref&gt;Jim Tester, "A History of Western Astrology", The Boydell Press, 1987, pp. 161–2, 196&lt;/ref&gt;

====Rate of Precession====
Though the one degree per hundred years calculated for [[precession of the equinoxes]] as defined by [[Hipparchus]] and promulgated by [[Ptolemy]] was too slow, another rate of precession that was too fast also gained popularity in the 1st millennium AD. By the fourth century AD, Theon of [[Alexandria]]&lt;ref&gt;Pingree, David: Precession and Trepidation in Indian Astronomy before A.D. 1200. Journal for the History of Astronomy, Vol. 3, p.27 - 35&lt;/ref&gt; assumed a changing rate (trepidation) of one degree per 66 years. The tables of the Shah (Zij-i Shah)&lt;ref&gt;Pingree, David Edwin: "The Recovery of early Greek astronomy from India", Journal for the History of Astronomy, Bd. 7, 1976, S. 112&lt;/ref&gt; originate in the sixth century, but are unfortunately lost, but many later Arabic and Persian astronomers and astrologers refer to them and also use this value. 

These later astronomers-astrologers or sources include: [[Al-Khwarizmi]], [[Zij al Sindhind]] or "Star Tables Based on the Indian Calculation Method"(c. 800); Tabulae probatae" or "az-Zig al-mumtan" (c. 830); [[Al-Battani]], [[Albategnius]], al-Zij (c. 880); and al-Sufi, [[Azophi]] (c. 965); [[Al Biruni]] (973-1048), "al Canon al Masud" or "The Masʿūdic Canon"; Arabic fixed star cataloque of 1 October 1112 (ed. Paul Kunitzsch); and "Libros del Saber de Astronomía" by [[Alfonso X of Castile]](1252-1284).&lt;ref&gt;Anna-Teresa Tymieniecka, "Astronomy and Civilization In the New Enlightenment: Passions of the Skies", Springer, p 96&lt;/ref&gt; At one degree per 66 years, one decan of a zodiacal sign (i.e. 10 degrees) is precessed in a period of 666 years - a value made famous in the [[Book of Revelation]] as the [[Number of the Beast]] {{Original research inline|date=February 2013}}.

====Anno Domini====
There exists evidence that the modern calendar developed by [[Dionysius Exiguus]] in the 6th century AD commencing with the birth of [[Jesus Christ]] at AD 1 was influenced by [[precession of the equinoxes]] and astrological ages. Dionysius' desire to replace Diocletian years (Diocletian persecuted Christians) with a calendar based on the incarnation of Christ was to prevent people from believing the imminent end of the world. At the time it was believed that the [[Resurrection]] and end of the world would occur 500 years after the birth of Jesus. The current [[Anno Mundi]] calendar theoretically commenced with the creation of the world based on information in the [[Old Testament]]. It was believed that based on the Anno Mundi calendar Jesus was born in the year 5500 (or 5500 years after the world was created) with the year 6000 of the Anno Mundi calendar marking the end of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Wallraff, Martin: Julius Africanus und die Christliche Weltchronik. Walter de Gruyter, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mosshammer, Alden A.: The Easter Computus and the Origins of the Christian Era. Oxford University Press, 2009, p. 254, p. 270, p. 328&lt;/ref&gt; 

Anno Mundi 6000 (approximately AD 500) was thus equated with the resurrection of Christ and the end of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Declercq, Georges: Anno Domini. The Origins of the Christian Era. Turnhout Belgium. 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Since this date had already passed in the time of Dionysius, he therefore searched for a new end of the world at a later date. He was heavily influenced by ancient cosmology, in particular the doctrine of the [[Great Year]] that places a strong emphasis on planetary conjunctions. This doctrine says that when all the planets were in conjunction that this cosmic event would mark the end of the world. Dionysius accurately calculated that this conjunction would occur in May AD 2000. Dionysius then applied another astronomical timing mechanism based on [[precession of the equinoxes]]. Though incorrect, some oriental astronomers at the time believed that the precessional cycle was 24,000 years which included twelve astrological ages of 2,000 years each. Dionysius believed that if the planetary alignment marked the end of an age (i.e. the Pisces age), then the birth of Jesus Christ marked the beginning of the Age of Pisces 2,000 years earlier. He therefore deducted 2,000 years from the May 2000 conjunction to produce AD 1&lt;ref&gt;Consideration of the Origin of the Yearly Count in the Julian and Gregorian Calendars.

====Mashallah ibn Athari====
The renown Jewish astronomer and astrologer Masha’allah (c.740 – 815 CE) employed [[precession of the equinoxes]] for calculating the period “Era of the Flood” dated as 3360 BCE or 259 years before the Indian [[Kali Yuga]], believed to have commenced in 3101 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Viator. Medieval and Renaissance Studies, University of California Press, 1970, Pp 149  &lt;/ref&gt;

====Giovanni Pico della Mirandola====
The 15th century Italian Renaissance philosopher [[Giovanni Pico della Mirandola]] published a massive attack on astrological predictions, but he did not object to all of [[astrology]] and he commented on the position of the vernal point in his day. Pico was aware of the effects of [[precession of the equinoxes]] and knew that the first point of [[Aries (constellation)|Aries]] no longer existed in the constellation of Aries. Pico not only knew that the vernal point had shifted back into [[Pisces (constellation)|Pisces]], he stated that in his time, the vernal point (zero degrees tropical Aries) was located at 2 degrees (sidereal) Pisces. This suggests that by whatever method of calculation he was employing, Pico expected the vernal point to shift into (sidereal) [[Aquarius (constellation)|Aquarius]] age 144 years later as a one degree shift takes 72 years.&lt;ref&gt;Jim Tester, "A History of Western Astrology", The Boydell Press, Suffolk, UK, 1999, pp 209,214&lt;/ref&gt;

==Calculation aspects==
[[Image:Outside view of precession.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Precessional movement as seen from 'outside' the celestial sphere. The rotation axis of the Earth describes over a period of about 25,800 years a small circle (blue) among the stars, centred on the [[ecliptic coordinates|ecliptic]] northpole (blue '''E''') and with an angular radius of about 23.4°: the angle known as the [[obliquity of the ecliptic]]. The orange axis was the Earth's rotation axis 5000 years ago when it pointed to the star Thuban. The yellow axis, pointing to Polaris is the situation now. Note that when the [[celestial sphere]] is seen from outside constellations appear in mirror image. Also note that the daily rotation of the Earth around its axis is opposite to the precessional rotation. When the polar axis ''precesses'' from one direction to another, then the equatorial plane of the Earth (indicated with the circular grid around the equator) and the associated celestial equator will move too. Where the celestial equator intersects the ecliptic (red line) there are the equinoxes. As seen from the drawing, the orange grid, 5000 years ago one intersection of equator and ecliptic, the [[vernal equinox]] was close to the star [[Aldebaran]] of [[Taurus (constellation)|Taurus]]. By now (the yellow grid) it has shifted (red arrow) to somewhere in the constellation of Pisces. Note that this is an astronomical description of the precessional movement and the vernal equinox position in a given constellation may not imply the astrological meaning of an Age carrying the same name, as they (ages and constellations) only have an exact alignment in the "[[first point of Aries]]", meaning once in each c. 25800 ([[Great year|Great Sidereal Year]]).]]

The Earth, in addition to its diurnal (daily) rotation upon its axis and annual rotation around the Sun, incurs a precessional motion involving a slow periodic shift of the axis itself: approximately one degree every 72 years. This motion, which is caused mostly by the Moon's [[gravity]], gives rise to the [[precession of the equinoxes]] in which the Sun's position on the [[ecliptic]] at the time of the vernal equinox, measured against the background of fixed stars, gradually changes with time.

In graphical terms, the Earth behaves like a spinning top, and tops tend to wobble as they spin. The spin of the Earth is its daily (diurnal) rotation. The spinning Earth slowly wobbles over a period slightly less than 26,000 years. From our perspective on Earth, the stars are ever so slightly 'moving' from west to east at the rate of one degree approximately every 72 years. One degree is about twice the diameter of the Sun or Moon as viewed from Earth. The easiest way to notice this slow movement of the stars is at any fixed time each year. The most common fixed time is at the vernal equinox around 21 March each year.

In astrology, an astrological age has usually been defined by the constellation or superimposed [[sidereal zodiac]] in which the Sun actually appears at the [[vernal equinox]]. This is the method that [[Hipparchus]] appears to have applied around 127 BC when he calculated precession. Since each sign of the zodiac is composed of 30 degrees, each astrological age might be thought to last about 72 (years) × 30 (degrees) = about 2160 years. 

This means the Sun crosses the equator at the vernal equinox moving backwards against the fixed stars from one year to the next at the rate of one degree in seventy-two years, one constellation (on average) in about 2160 years, and the whole twelve signs in about 25,920 years, sometimes called a [[Great Year|Platonic Year]]. However the length of the ages are decreasing with time as the rate of precession is increasing. Therefore, no two ages are of equal length.

===First point of Aries alignment - the fiducial point===
Approximately every 26,000 years the zodiacal constellations, the associated [[sidereal zodiac]], and the tropical zodiac used by western astrologers basically align. Technically this is when the tropical and sidereal "first point in Aries" (Aries 0°) coincided. This alignment is often called the [[wikt:fiducial|fiducial]] point and, if the fiducial point could be found, fairly exact timeframes of all the astrological ages could be accurately determined if the method used to determine the astrological ages is based on the equal-sized 30 degrees per age and do not correspond to the exact constellation configuration in the sky. 

However this fiducial point is difficult to determine because while there is no ambiguity about the [[tropical zodiac]] used by western astrologers, the same cannot be said of the sidereal zodiac used by [[Vedic period|Vedic]] astrologers. Vedic astrologers do not have unanimity on the exact location in space of their sidereal zodiac. This is because the sidereal zodiac is superimposed upon the irregular zodiacal constellation, and there are no unambiguous boundaries of the zodiacal constellations. 

Modern day astronomers have defined boundaries, but this is a recent development by astronomers who are divorced from astrology, and cannot be assumed to be correct from the astrological perspective. While most astronomers and some astrologers agree that the fiducial point occurred in or around the 3rd to 5th centuries AD, there is no consensus on any exact date or tight timeframe within these three centuries. A number of dates are proposed by various astronomers and even wider timeframes by astrologers. (For an alternative approach to calibrating precession, see [[#Alternative approach to calibrating precession|Alternative approach to calibrating precession]] in New, alternative, and fringe theories section below).

As an example of a [[mysticism|mystic]] contemporary approach to precession, in [[Max Heindel]]'s astrology writings,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rosicrucian.com/asthtme1.htm A Rosicrucian Spiritual Astrology library], a Western [[Esoteric Christian]] astrology library&lt;/ref&gt; it is described, that last time the starting-point of the [[sidereal zodiac]] agreed with the [[tropical zodiac]] occurred in AD 498. A year after these points were in exact agreement, the Sun crossed the equator about fifty seconds of space into the constellation Pisces. The year following it was one minute and forty seconds into Pisces, and so it has been creeping backwards ever since, until at the present time the Sun crosses the equator in about nine degrees in the constellation Pisces. Based on this approach, it will thus be about 600 years before it actually crosses the celestial equator in the constellation Aquarius. However this is only one of many approaches and so this must remain speculation at this point of time.

====Overview====
"The Age of the Great Mother." Cancer is ruled by the Moon, and is associated with the process of bearing, birthing, nurturing, and protecting. In astrologic mythology this age marks the beginning of civilization, with domestication of farm animals and nomadic people settling down to living in permanent dwellings.

====Historical similarities====
During this mythological age writing developed,{{dubious|date=October 2010}} and trade started to accelerate. The constellation can be seen as two people holding hands (thought to be twins), believed by some{{who|date=December 2014}} to be symbolic for trade and communication of peoples. In myths associated with the constellation of Gemini, both writing (including literature, newspapers, journals, magazines, and works of fiction) and trade (including merchants) are traditional [[archetypes]] belonging to the sign of [[Gemini (astrology)|Gemini]].

Most forms of local transportation are archetypes mythologically linked with the sign of Gemini.

====Religious similarities====
Multiple gods, such as the pantheon of gods in Ancient Greek literature, are believed to have appeared in this [[Gemini (astrology)|Gemini]] age {{dubious|date=October 2010}} probably in [[Sumer]] ([[Mesopotamia]]).{{dubious|date=October 2010}} (Gemini is not only associated with the archetype of 'twins' and 'duality' but also 'multiplicity')

====Overview====
"The Age of Earth, Agriculture, and the Bull" This age is claimed to have occurred approximately around the time of the building of the Pyramids in Egypt.

====Religious similarities====
Bull worshiping cults began to form in [[Assyria]], [[Egypt]], and [[Crete]] during this mythological age.

*[[Ankh|Ankh: thoracic vertebra of a bull - Egyptian symbol of life]]
*Worship of [[Apis (god)|Apis]], the bull-deity (see also [[Bull (mythology)]]), the most important of all the sacred animals in [[Egypt]], said to be instituted during the [[Second Dynasty]] of the [[Early Dynastic Period of Egypt|Early Dynastic Period]] of Egypt and worshipped in the [[Memphis, Egypt|Memphis]] region until the [[New Kingdom]] (16th century BC).
*When [[Dating the Exodus|Moses]] was said to have descended from the mountain with the ten commandments (c. 17th – 13th century BC, the end of the [[Age of Taurus]]), some of his people or followers were found by him to be worshipping a [[golden bull]] calf. He instructed these worshippers to be killed. This represents Moses "killing" the bull and ending the Age of Taurus, and ushering in the Age of Aries, which he represents.&lt;ref&gt;William Drummond, "Oedipus Judaicus - Allegory in the Old Testament", Bracken Books, London, 1996 (first published 2011), p xix, 159&lt;/ref&gt;

====Overview====
"The Age of War, Fire, and the Ram"&lt;br /&gt;

====Historical similarities====
Aries represents a Fire symbol as well as bold actions, a lot of these behaviors can be seen during any age. However, the themes emphasised during this age relate to courage, initiative, war, and adventure. Nations during this age such as the expanding empires of [[history of China#Ancient China|China]], [[Persia]], [[Ancient Greece|Greece]], and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]], are often cited as examples of the archetypes of Aries in action. Also the Aries constellation shows a ram running. This could correspond with the sacrifice of Abraham's Ram. While the number of names containing the sound of the ram during this period is noted: [[Ra]] (Sun God), Ram, Rama, Brahman, Brahma, Abram/Abraham, Amon Ra, and [[Ramesses I]].{{Dubious|date=September 2008}} The [[battering ram]] was employed by the Assyrians, Greeks, and Romans with great success during this time.{{Dubious|date=September 2008}} (The symbol of Mars, the planetary ruler of Aries, evokes this interpretation.) According to the Roman state religion, the Roman people were the "Sons of Mars".

Aries is associated with the metal [[iron]], and iron ore was for the first time smelted and worked into iron swords in [[Anatolia]] during the early phase of this era, replacing the heavier, softer-metalled, duller-edged bronze swords of the previous Taurus Age.

Traits of [[Aries (astrology)|Aries]] such as 'initiative' may suggest the explosion of originality in the development of social aspects, sciences and arts in regions such as [[Ancient Greece]] but at the same time traits such as 'Impulsivity' may be attributed to the various Wars of the time.

====Religious similarities====
The Age of Aries ushered in efforts to replace [[polytheism]] with [[monotheism]]. The earliest known attempt was by the Egyptian Pharaoh [[Akhenaten]], who, in about 1350 BC, decreed the Sun God [[Aten]] to be the supreme deity, apparently in reaction to his earlier lack of inclusion in religious rites by his family. After his death, however, power reverted to the original polytheistic priests, who re-established the old religion. Speculation (including that of [[Freud]]) has it that later, during the reign of [[Ramesses II]], [[Moses]] was influenced by rumour of Akhenaten's revolutionary idea, and grasped the idea of a single supreme God, who especially favoured his people, as an inspirational mechanism that best suited his people held in bondage. The symbol of Aries can be seen as representing the power of multiple gods streaming down into a single god-head.

[[Moses]] (born c. 16th–13th century BC; 7 Adar 2368 – 7 Adar 2488 in the [[Hebrew calendar]]), an early [[Biblical Hebrew]] religious leader, lawgiver, [[prophet]], and military leader, condemns his own people upon finding them worshiping a 'golden calf' (a symbol of the previous [[Age of Taurus]] and of the worship of the [[Apis (god)|bull deity]]) after coming down [[Mount Sinai]]. These events may have occurred during the Age of Aries (see also [[The Exodus#Date|dating the Exodus]]).

Some astrologers claim the Age of Pisces is the current age and they believe it will remain so for approximately another 600 years.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} At that time, the vernal equinox point will have moved into the constellation of Aquarius, thus beginning the [[Age of Aquarius]]. Other astrologers claim the Age of Pisces ended with the great cosmic alignment of 21 December 2012, thus beginning the Age of Aquarius.

"The Age of Monotheism, Spirituality, and the Fish"

The age of Pisces began {{circa}} 1 AD and will end {{circa}} 2150 AD. With the story of the birth of [[Christ]] coinciding with this date,{{sfn|Freke|Gandy|2001|loc=Myth becomes History}} many Christian symbols for Christ use the astrological symbol for Pisces,{{sfn|Scott|1996|=p=73}} the fishes.{{sfn|Freke|Gandy|2001|loc=The New Age}} Jesus bears many of the temperaments and personality traits of a Pisces,{{sfn|Ankerberg|2011|loc=10}} and is thus considered an [[archetype]] of the Piscean.{{sfn|Guttman|Guttman|Johnson|1993|p=360}} Moreover, the [[twelve apostles]] were called the "fishers of men," early Christians called themselves "little fishes," and a code word for Jesus was the Greek word for fish, "Ikhthus."{{sfn|Freke|Gandy|2001|loc=The New Age}} With this, the start of the age, or the "Great Month of Pisces" is regarded as the beginning of the Christian religion.{{sfn|Freke|Gandy|2001|loc=The Greatest story ever told}} [[Saint Peter]] is recognized as the [[apostle]] of the Piscean sign.{{sfn|The Open Court|1920|p=300}}

====Transition into the Aquarian Age====
Pisces has been called the "dying god," where its sign opposite in the night sky is [[Virgo (astrology)|Virgo]], or, the [[Virgin Mary]].{{sfn|Guttman|Guttman|Johnson|1993|p=288}} When Jesus was asked by his disciples where the next [[Passover]] would be, he replied to them:
{{Quote|text=Behold, when ye are entered into the city, there shall a man meet you bearing a pitcher of water ... follow him into the house where he entereth in.|sign=[[Jesus]]|source=[[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 22:10}} This coincides with the changing of the ages, into the Age of Aquarius,{{sfn|The Flaming Sword|1900|loc=Reading the Signs of the Times}} as the personification of the [[Aquarius (astrology)|constellation of Aquarius]] is a man carrying pitchers of water.

Aquarius also has a double rulership: Saturn is the traditional ruler and Uranus is the modern ruler. Saturn presides over structure and form and the status quo. Because Saturn tends to be rather rigid it is often associated with the rigidity of religious doctrine.

====Timeframes====
In 1928, at the Conference of the [[International Astronomical Union]] (IAU) in [[Leiden]], the [[Netherlands]], the edges of the 88 official constellations became defined in astronomical terms. The edge established between [[Pisces (constellation)|Pisces]] and [[Aquarius (constellation)|Aquarius]] locates the beginning of the Aquarian Age around the year 2600.

The Austrian astronomer, Professor [[Hermann Haupt (astronomer)|Hermann Haupt]]&lt;!--Please do not revert to Hermann Haupt. If you link to Hermann Haupt, it goes to the entomologist not the astronomer.--&gt;,&lt;ref&gt;In an article copyrighted by Sepp Rothwangl: Considerations About the Start of the Age of Aquarius (see External Links),&lt;/ref&gt; examined the question of when the Age of Aquarius begins in an article published in 1992 by the Austrian Academy of Science: with the German title {{lang|de|"Der Beginn des Wassermannzeitalters, eine astronomische Frage?"}} ("The Start of the Aquarian Age, an Astronomical Question?"). Based on the boundaries accepted by IAU in 1928, Haupt's article investigates the start of the Age of Aquarius by calculating the entry of the spring equinox point over the parallel cycle (d = - 4°) between the constellations Pisces and Aquarius and reaches, using the usual formula of precession (Gliese, 1982), the year 2595. However Haupt concludes:

:"Though it cannot be expected that astrologers will follow the official boundaries of the constellations, there will be an attempt to calculate the entry of the spring equinox point into the constellation of Aquarius." ...

:"As briefly has been shown, the results and methods of astrology in many areas, such as concerning the Aquarian Age, are controversial on their own and cannot be called scientific because of the many esoteric elements."&lt;ref&gt;Haupt, Herman, Prof., "Der Beginn des Wassermannzeitalters, eine astronomische Frage?", 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

The water-bearer may symbolize widespread transparent, peaceful, neighborly, and [[sustainability|sustainable]] living. Furthermore, they see the appearance of dictators, self-expression, and the rising influence of the entertainment industry are linked to the Aquarian Age by its opposite sign Leo.

====Popular culture====
In popular culture, the expression "Age of Aquarius" usually refers to the heyday of the [[hippie]] and [[New Age]] movements of the 1960s and 1970s. The 1967 successful musical ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]'', with its opening song "[[Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In|Aquarius]]" and the memorable line "This is the dawning of the age of Aquarius", brought the Aquarian Age concept to the attention of a huge worldwide audience.
This New Age phenomenon is seen by some astrologers to be marked by the conjunction of the planet Uranus, ruler of the sign Aquarius, and the coming age, with Pluto, ruler of the masses, bringing radical change, in the 1960s. However, as the song relates, it is only considered by astrologers as the "dawning" or "[[cusp (astrology)|cusp]]" of the Age, with the full strength of the Age not occurring until some time in the future.

===The Age of Capricorn ===

The Age of Capricorn will follow the Age of Aquarius approximately 2150 years after the beginning of the Age of Aquarius, but the actual date for the start of the Age of Capricorn depends upon which system is used to calculate the length of an age and which system is applied to mark the start of the Age of Aquarius.  There is no consensus on these matters but in broad terms, the Age of Capricorn can be expected to arrive somewhere from around the year 3500 to 4600 CE.

==The sub-periods of ages==
Many research astrologers believe that the astrological ages can be divided into smaller sections along the lines of 'wheels within wheels'. The most common method is to divide each astrological ages into twelve sub-periods.&lt;ref&gt;Terry MacKinnell, "A New Look at the Old Ages", published in the "NCGR member letter" June- July 2002, National Center for Geocosmic Research Inc, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; There are two common ways of undertaking this process and two ways of applying these sub-periods. Furthermore, some astrologers divide the ages in different ways. For example, Lcdr David Williams employs a [[Decans|decan]]ate sub-division whereby each age is divided into three equal sections.&lt;ref&gt;Lcdr David Williams, ''Simplified Astronomy for Astrologers'', 1980, American Federation of Astrologers, Tempe Arizona&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Hand]] developed another approach entirely whereby the conjunction of the moving vernal point with specific stars within the zodiacal constellations provides an extra flavour to the corresponding historical events based on the nature of the star involved.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Hand, ''Cardinal Points'', 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

However Robert Hand believes that the moving Capricorn solstice point (around 20 December) near the modern New Year provides greater correlation to historical events compared to the vernal equinox. Patrizia Norelli-Bachelet used a variety of sub-periods including decans, but Patrizia advocated that the ninefold division of each sign was the most powerful and influential sub-division.&lt;ref&gt;Patrizia Norelli-Bachelet, ''The Gnostic Circle'', Samual Weiser Inc, New York, 1978, pp. 105–122&lt;/ref&gt; The ninefold division (termed 'navamsa') of the zodiacal signs is also the most popular sign sub-division system employed by [[Vedic astrology|Vedic astrologers]]. Vedic astrologers also apply their [[nakshatra]] star asterisms in place of the twelve zodiacal constellations. There are 27 nakshatras of 13 degrees 20 minutes each, thus the average length of a 'nakshatra' age is 960 years.

===Aries to Pisces sub-periods===
The most popular method of sub-dividing astrological ages is to divide each age equally into twelve sub-periods with the first sub-period Aries, followed by Taurus, Gemini, and so on, until the last sub-division, Pisces. [[Charles E. O. Carter|Charles Carter]] was an early advocate of this approach.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Carter, ''An Introduction to Political Astrology (Mundane Astrology)'', The Camelot Press, Great Britain, 1973, pp. 75–6&lt;/ref&gt; Technically this approach is based on the twelfth harmonic of the zodiacal signs.

===Dwadasamsa sub-periods===
The alternative approach is to apply a method commonly used in Vedic astrology but with long antecedents also in western astrology.&lt;ref&gt;the ancient Roman astrologer Manilius used dwadasamsa but called them dodecatemorion (sometimes 'duodecatemorion') - Stephanie Jean Ennis, ''Decanates and Dwads'', 1983, p. 57 {{ISBN|0-86690-239-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This method also divides each astrological age into twelve sub-periods but the first sub-period for each sign is the same as the sign itself, then with the following sub-periods in natural order. For example, the twelve dwadasamsa of Aquarius are Aquarius, Pisces, Aries, Taurus, and so on, until the last dwadasamsa – Capricorn. Technically this approach is based on attributes of both the twelfth and thirteenth harmonics of the zodiacal signs and can be considered to be halfway between the 12th and 13th harmonics.

===Sub-period direction (forward or retrograde?)===
There are two ways of applying the above sub-periods to the astrological ages.
*Natural Order - The most common way is to arrange the sub-periods so that they go forward in the natural order. Therefore, if the Aries to Pisces method is adopted for example in the Aquarian Age, the first sub-period is Aries, followed by Taurus, Gemini and so on until the last sub-division – Pisces. This is the approach made by [[Charles E. O. Carter|Charles Carter]]. If the dwadasamsa sub-period is adopted they also progress in the natural order of the signs. For example, the twelve dwadasamsa of Aquarius are Aquarius, Pisces, Aries, Taurus, and so on, until the last dwadasamsa – Capricorn.

*Geometric Order (Retrograde) - The other approach is to arrange the sub-periods geometrically and reverse the direction of the sub-periods in line with the retrograde order of the astrological ages. For example, if applying the Aries to Pisces method, the first sub-period of any astrological age is Pisces, followed by Aquarius, Capricorn, and so on, until the last sub-period – Aries. [[Charles E. O. Carter|Charles Carter]] indicated there was some merit to this approach.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles E. O. Carter|Charles Carter]], ''An Introduction to Political Astrology'', 1973, LN Fowler &amp; Co Ltd, London, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; If applying the dwadasamsa sub-period system geometrically for example the first sub-period in the Aquarian Age is Capricorn, followed by Sagittarius, Scorpio, and so on, until the last sub-period – Aquarius. This approach is adopted by Terry MacKinnell,&lt;ref&gt;Terry MacKinnell, "The Cusp of Ages" published in ''The FAA Journal'' June 2001 Vol 31 No. 2. pp. 33–42&lt;/ref&gt; Patrizia Norelli-Bachelet&lt;ref&gt;Patrizia Norelli-Bachelet, ''The Gnostic Circle'', Samual Weiser Inc, New York, 1978&lt;/ref&gt; and Lcdr David Williams applied his [decans] (threefold division) geometrically thus supporting this approach.

==New, alternative, and fringe myths==
Due to the lack of consensus of almost all aspects of the astrological ages, except for the astrological ages relationship to [[precession of the equinoxes]] and the retrograde order of the astrological ages, there are alternative, esoteric, innovative, fringe and newly expressed ideas about the astrological ages which have not established credibility in the wider astrological community or amongst archeoastronomers.

===Alternative approach to calibrating precession===
Terry MacKinnell has developed an alternative approach to calibrating precession of the equinoxes to determine the Astrological Age. His major point of departure from the traditional modern approach is how he applies the vernal equinox to the zodiacal constellations. Instead of referring to the position of the Sun at the vernal equinox (a 'modern' mathematical technique developed by the Greeks in the late 1st millennium BC), he refers to the [[heliacal rising]] constellation on the day of the vernal equinox. This approach is based on the ancient approach to astronomical observations (the same ancient period that also saw the invention of the zodiacal constellations) prior to the development of mathematical astronomy by the ancient Greeks in the 1st millennium BC. All ancient astronomical observations were based on visual techniques.&lt;ref&gt;O Neugebaurer, ''The Exact Sciences in Antiquity'', 1969, p. 106&lt;/ref&gt; 

Of all the key techniques used in ancient times, the most common in Babylon (most likely the source of astrology) and most other ancient cultures were based on phenomena that occurred close to the eastern or western horizons.&lt;ref&gt;O Neugebaurer, ''The Exact Sciences in Antiquity'', 1969, p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; MacKinnell claims that it is incongruent to use a 'modern' mathematical approach to the much older constellations that were first described well before these mathematical approaches were invented.

The heliacal rising constellation at the vernal equinox is based on the last zodiacal constellation rising above the Eastern Horizon just before dawn and before the light of the approaching Sun obliterates the stars on the eastern horizon. Currently at the vernal equinox the constellation of Aquarius has been the heliacal rising constellation for some centuries. The stars disappear about one hour before dawn depending upon magnitude, latitude, and date. This one hour represents approximately 15 degrees difference compared to the contemporary method based on the position of the Sun amongst the zodiacal constellations.&lt;ref&gt;John H Rogers, "Origins of the ancient constellations: I. The Mesopotamian traditions", ''Journal of the British Astronomical Association'', 108,1, 1998, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

Each age is composed of 30 degrees. Therefore, 15 degrees represents about half an age or about 1080 years. Therefore, based on the heliacal rising method, the Age of Aquarius arrived about 1,080 years earlier than the modern system. John H Rogers in part one of his paper ''Origins of the ancient constellations'' also states that using the ancient heliacal rising method compared to the (modern) solar method produces a result that is approximately 1,000 in advance.&lt;ref&gt;John H Rogers, "Origins of the ancient constellations: I. The Mesopotamian traditions", ''Journal of the British Astronomical Association'', 108,1, 1998, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

Using MacKinnell's approach, the Astrological Ages arrive about half an age earlier compared to the common contemporary approach to calibrating precession based on 'modern' mathematical techniques. Therefore, Terry MacKinnell has the Aquarian Age arriving in the 15th century while most astrologers have the Age of Aquarius arriving in the 27th century, almost 700 years in the future.&lt;ref&gt;Terry MacKinnell, "The Mysterious Zodiacal Constellations", published in ''The International Astrologer'' Vol XXXI No. 3, 2002, pp. 29–33&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular culture==
*The film ''Aquarian Age'', released in Japan in 2008. Directed by Hidetaka Tahara and starring Dori Sakurada, Rakuto Tochihara, Takuya Uehara, Keita Kimura, Toshikiyo Fujii, Nao Nagasawa, Go Ayano and Masami Horiuchi. This movie is based on the Japan's most popular domestic trading card game, the characters from the female-oriented Juvenile Orion spinoff. The story focuses on several high school boys who discover that they inherited latent genetic traits from among other things, wings that sprout out of their backs. They soon find themselves caught in a millennia-old war, with each representing one of several different factions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aquarian-movie.com/ アクエリアンエイジ劇場版&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6GGwx3pXQ?url=http://www.aquarian-movie.com/ |date=30 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Aquarian Age TCG|Aquarian Age]]'' (アクエリアンエイジ, Akuerian Eiji?) is a Japanese collectible trading card game similar to ''[[Magic: The Gathering]]''. It is marketed and produced by Broccoli, which produces games and Anime-related goods.
*The 1967 rock musical ''[[Hair (musical)|Hair]]'' featured the song "[[Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In|Aquarius]]" (composed by [[Galt MacDermot]], [[James Rado]], and [[Gerome Ragni]]), which spoke of the coming age; a recording of the song by [[The 5th Dimension]] was a top-ten pop hit in 1969.
*The first section of the film ''[[Zeitgeist (film)|Zeitgeist]]'' presents a theory of astrological ages that proposes that many events in world religions, such as Moses' condemnation of the Golden Calf and Jesus' ministry, are merely allegories used to describe astrological events. The narrator of the film implies that Biblical characters, such as Jesus, never existed as real human beings, but are rather metaphors for constellations and ages.

During World War II, he worked as a speaker on [[BBC World Service|Radio London]], and was known as "London's Slovene voice". He served as a Minister in the [[Treaty of Vis|Tito–Šubašić coalition government]]. In 1947, he was convicted by the [[Communist Party of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav Communist]] authorities at the [[Nagode Trial]].

==Early life and career==
He was born in a middle class [[Slovenes|Slovene]] family in [[Trieste]], then part of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] (today in Italy). He attended private [[Slovene language]] schools in Trieste. As a teenager, he attended an intensive English course at the local [[Berlitz Language Schools|Berlitz language school]], where he was a pupil of the Irish novelist [[James Joyce]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Ellmann]], ''[[James Joyce (biography)|James Joyce]]'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1982), p. 341&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Marta Verginella]], ''Il confine degli altri: la questione giuliana e la memoria slovena'' (Rome: Donzelli Editore, 2008), p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; After finishing the [[German language]] [[Gymnasium (school)|State gymnasium]] in Trieste in 1913, he went to study law at the [[University of Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;Marta Verginella, ''Il confine degli altri: la questione giuliana e la memoria slovena'' (Rome: Donzelli Editore, 2008), p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; After the break of [[World War I]], he returned to Austria-Hungary, and enrolled in the [[University of Vienna]]. He finished his studies at the [[University of Bologna]] after the end of World War I. In 1920, he obtained a PhD from the [[University of Zagreb]].

In 1920, Furlan returned to his home city of Trieste, which had become a part of the [[Kingdom of Italy]]. First, he worked as an assistant in the [[Josip Wilfan]]'s law firm, establishing his own practice in 1925. In 1926, when [[Fascist Italianization]] was already in full advance, he managed to get a permit to publish a Slovene-language legal journal named ''Pravni vestnik'' (The Legal Herald), in which both Furlan and Wilfan published numerous text on legal philosophy and legal theory.&lt;ref&gt;Marta Verginella, ''Il confine degli altri: la questione giuliana e la memoria slovena'' (Rome: Donzelli Editore, 2008), p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; The journal was abolished in 1928, as one of the last Slovene-language and Croat-language media prohibited by the Fascist regime. Between 1928 and 1930, Furlan worked as political advisor to Wilfan, who became one of the leaders of the [[Congress of European Nationalities]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.arnes.si/~ljinz15/documents/english/prispevki/prispevki_00-1.htm www2.arnes.si]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1930, he escaped to the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] in order to escape [[Italian Fascism|Fascist]] persecution. {{Citation needed|date=January 2011}} In 1931, he opened a law practice in [[Ljubljana]], and in 1936 he became a professor of sociology of law at the [[University of Ljubljana]]. {{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

==Exile during World War II==
In late March 1941, when Yugoslavia signed the [[Tripartite Pact]], Furlan was evacuated from the country with the help of the British intelligence service with which he had established a collaboration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rtvslo.si/odprtikop/intervju/dr-janez-arnez/ www.rtvslo.si] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110609172844/http://www.rtvslo.si/odprtikop/intervju/dr-janez-arnez/ |date=2011-06-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Axis invasion of Yugoslavia]] and the [[Province of Ljubljana|Italian occupation of Slovenia]], he was convicted to death ''[[trial in absentia|in contumaciam]]'' by the Italian authorities. After a short stay in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], Furlan travelled to the [[United States]]. Together with the [[liberal conservative]] Slovenian émigré politicians [[Izidor Cankar]] and [[Franc Snoj]], Furlan propagated for the Yugoslav and Slovene cause. In 1942, he published a brochure titled ''Fighting Yugoslavia: The Struggle of the Slovenes'', in which he articulated, among other, the Slovenian claims for the annexation of his native [[Julian March]] region to Yugoslavia. {{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

In 1943, he moved to London, where he served as Minister of Education in the [[exile government]] of [[Miloš Trifunović]] between June and August 1943. In the first years of the war, Furlan supported the [[Chetnik]] resistance movement of [[Draža Mihajlović]], but after early 1944, he became supportive of [[Josip Broz Tito]]'s [[Yugoslav Partisans]]. {{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

After the Yugoslav Prime Minister [[Ivan Šubašić]] [[Treaty of Vis|recognized the partisan movement]] in June 1944, Furlan replaced [[Alojzij Kuhar]] as the official Slovene speaker of the Yugoslav [[government in exile]] for the [[BBC World Service|Radio London]]. In summer 1944, he had several speeches directed to the members of the collaborationist [[Slovene Home Guard]], urging them to join forces with the partisan forces. One of his speeches, titled ''A Clear Word from London'' was printed on leaflets which were dropped by Allied airplanes over Slovenia. In Autumn 1944, Furlan replaced [[Izidor Cankar]] as Minister for Culture and Telecommunication in the Provisional Government. In early 1945, he went to the liberated territories in southern Slovenia together with [[Franc Snoj]]. {{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

==Under the Communist regime==
After the end of World War II, he became the dean of the Faculty of Law of the University of Ljubljana. He tried to maintain a critical attitude towards the [[Communist regime]]; among other things, he secretly translated [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Animal Farm]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dlib.si/stream/URN:NBN:SI:DOC-VEU77NH8/c725e18f-69aa-4680-950c-fdd6fd553230/PDF "Razprava pred Okrožnim sodiščem v Ljubljani proti vohunski skupini: Nagode, Snoj, Furlan." 1947.

In June 1947, he was arrested and tried at the so-called [[Nagode Trial]], together with 31 other [[liberal democratic]] and [[left-wing]] Slovene intellectuals, such as [[Črtomir Nagode]], [[Ljubo Sirc]], [[Angela Vode]] and Franc Snoj. Furlan was accused of having been member of a [[Masonic lodge]] in the 1930s, of having maintained contacts with the British intelligence since the late 1930s; the main accusation regarded his translation of Orwell's ''Animal Farm'' and his friendly relations with the American Red Cross official Jack Hoptner.&lt;ref&gt;Marta Verginella, ''Il confine degli altri: la questione giuliana e la memoria slovena'' (Rome: Donzelli Editore, 2008), p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1947, he was sentenced to death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dlib.si/stream/URN:NBN:SI:DOC-MS9GJFP7/cde18fca-3754-4b9d-a28b-20a6fa40badf/PDF "Komentarji. Zbira in presoja urednik." 1947.

''Enakopravnost: neodvisen dnevnik za slovenske delavce v Ameriki'' 30 (165) (25 August): 2.] {{sl icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was released on parole after four and a half years because of illness. {{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

In 1952, he moved to the small [[Upper Carniola]]n town of [[Radovljica]] to escape the daily intimidations to which he was subjected in the Slovenian capital.&lt;ref&gt;Marta Verginella, ''Il confine degli altri: la questione giuliana e la memoria slovena'' (Rome: Donzelli Editore, 2008), 123&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1953, he was reportedly attacked by agents of the [[UDBA|Yugoslav secret police]], in which he suffered severe injuries.&lt;ref&gt;Marta Verginella, ''Il confine degli altri: la questione giuliana e la memoria slovena'' (Rome: Donzelli Editore, 2008), pp. 123-124&lt;/ref&gt;

He died in Ljubljana&lt;ref name="Brecelj"/&gt; or Radovljica&lt;ref name="Jevnikar"/&gt; at the age of 62 and was interred in the cemetery in the [[Vič]] neighborhood of Ljubljana.&lt;ref name="FaG"/&gt;

This architecture in {{nihongo|"Japanese"|和様|wayō}} that is Japanese original design. It was built in 1059.It was registered as part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site "[[Historic Monuments of Ancient Kyoto]]".]]

[[Buddhism]] played an important role in the development of [[Japanese art]] between the 6th and the 16th centuries. [[Buddhist art]] and [[Buddhist]] religious thought came to Japan from [[China]] through [[Korea]] and Buddhist art was encouraged by Crown [[Prince Shōtoku]] in the [[Suiko]] period in the sixth century and by [[Emperor Shōmu]] in the [[Nara period]] in the eighth century. In the early [[Heian period]] Buddhist art and architecture greatly influenced the traditional [[Shinto]] arts, and Buddhist painting became fashionable among wealthy Japanese. The Kamakura period saw a flowering of Japanese Buddhist sculpture, whose origins are in the works of Heian period sculptor [[Jōchō]]. &lt;!--Many of the great artists from [[Kyoto]] and [[Nara]] during the [[Kamakura period]] were also [[Buddhist monks]].
--&gt;
The [[Amitabha|Amida]] sect of Buddhism provided the basis for many popular artworks. Buddhist art became popular among the masses via [[Emakimono|scroll paintings]], paintings used in worship and paintings of [[Buddhas]], [[saint]]'s lives, [[hell]]s and other religious themes. Under the [[Zen]] sect of Buddhism, portraiture of priests such as Bodhidharma became popular as well as scroll calligraphy and sumi-e brush painting.

==Asuka and Nara periods==

[[File:Shakyamuni Triad Horyuji.JPG|thumb|Shakyamuni Triad by Tori Busshi depicts the Buddha Shakyamuni in the traditional sixth-century Chinese style with an elongated head and in front of a flaming mandorla - a lotus petal shaped cloud.]]

Buddhist art was introduced to Japan along with the Buddhist religion in the mid-sixth century, when according to tradition, [[Seong of Baekje]] sent a statue of the Buddha along with some sutras to the [[Emperor Kinmei]]. The [[Asuka period]] (552–645) saw the gradual growth of Chinese and Korean artistic and religious influences on Japanese culture. Chinese influence grew in the Nara Period (645–784) as the Japanese court began to model itself in a Chinese form, and Buddhism continued to spread throughout Japan, while integrating within it the Japanese religion of Shinto. 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = Gardner's art through the ages, Fred S Kleiner. P 211.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sculpture of this period shows, as do most all subsequent sculpture, the influence of continental art. [[Tori Busshi]] a descendant of a Chinese immigrant followed the style of [[Northern Wei]] sculpture and established what has come to be known as the Tori school of sculpture. Notable examples of Tori works are the Sakyamuni Triad (or Shaka triad) which are the main icons of the Golden Hall of [[Hōryū-ji]] temple and the [[kannon]] [[Boddhisatva]] of Yumedono Hall of the same temple, also known as Guze Kannon. First built in the early 7th century as the private temple of Crown [[Prince Shōtoku]], [[Hōryū-ji]] consists of 41 independent buildings. The most important ones, the main worship hall, or ''Kondō'' (Golden Hall), and ''Gojū-no-tō'' (Five-story [[Pagoda]]), stand in the center of an open area surrounded by a roofed cloister. Inside the ''Kondō'', on a large rectangular platform, are some of the most important sculptures of the period including the Sakyamuni triad.

In the Sakyamuni Triad, [[Gautama Buddha|Sakyamuni]], the center Buddha, is attended by two other figures, [[Bhaisajyaguru]] to its right and [[Amitabha|Amitābha]] to its left. The statues are dated to 623.&lt;ref name="ISBN477002939X"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN477002939X&amp;id=zMC4RMXQkn0C&amp;pg=PA42&amp;lpg=PA42&amp;vq=kannon&amp;dq=chuguji+miroku&amp;sig=Z5IBZpP5m89CZxi3XUnwfbEBsh4|title=Discovering the Arts of Japan: A Historical Overview, p42|accessdate=2007-04-03|publisher=Kodansha International|year=2003|author=Tsuneko S.

The Early Nara period saw a move towards more naturalistic styles emerging from China. The Triad of Yakushi shows the healing Buddha which presides over the Eastern Pure Land attended by two Bodhisattvas Nikko and Gakko. The triad, housed in the Yakushiji temple (7th century in Nara), reveals Chinese and central Asian influences in its anatomical definition, naturalism and realistic drapery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = Gardner's art through the ages, Fred S Kleiner. P 212.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This sculpture also demonstrates the roots of Japanese art in the 1st-3rd century CE [[Greco-Buddhist art]] of [[Gandhara]], characterized by flowing dress patterns and realistic rendering,&lt;ref&gt;"Needless to say, the influence of Greek art on Japanese Buddhist art, via the Buddhist art of Gandhara and India, was already partly known in, for example, the comparison of the wavy drapery of the Buddha images, in what was, originally, a typical Greek style" (Katsumi Tanabe, "Alexander the Great, East-West cultural contacts from Greece to Japan", p19)&lt;/ref&gt; on which Chinese and Korean artistic traits were superimposed. After the [[Northern Wei|Chinese Northern Wei]] buddhist art had infiltrated a Korean peninsula, Buddhist icons was brought Japan by Korean immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;Korean Influence on Early Japanese Buddhist Sculpture [http://eng.buddhapia.com/_Service/_ContentView/ETC_CONTENT_2.ASP?pk=0000593748&amp;sub_pk=&amp;clss_cd=0002169717&amp;top_menu_cd=0000000592&amp;menu_cd=0000008845&amp;menu_code=&amp;image_folder=color_11&amp;bg_color=2B5137&amp;line_color=3A6A4A&amp;menu_type= buddhapia.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110111194158/http://eng.buddhapia.com/_Service/_ContentView/ETC_CONTENT_2.ASP?pk=0000593748&amp;sub_pk=&amp;clss_cd=0002169717&amp;top_menu_cd=0000000592&amp;menu_cd=0000008845&amp;menu_code=&amp;image_folder=color_11&amp;bg_color=2B5137&amp;line_color=3A6A4A&amp;menu_type= |date=2011-01-11 }} "One must stress the obvious point that since Korean Buddhist art is directly based on developments in China, ultimately a study of Korean influence on Japan must be rooted in an understanding of the Chinese impact on Korea.""Since the territory of the Northern Wei was adjacent to that of Koguryo, it is natural that the Buddhist ideas and art current at the Northern Wei court would flow directly to Koguryo. ""It should also be pointed out that there was considerable influence from Koguryo on the southern kingdoms of Paekche and Silla even though Paekche also received direct influence from south China, as was mentioned above.""I have argued that various groups, including official envoys, monks and students, as well as Korean settlers, were responsible for bringing Korean icons to Japan."&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly, the semi-seated Maitreya form was adapted into a highly developed Ancient Greek art style which was transmitted to Japan as evidenced by the [[Kōryū-ji]] [[Maitreya|Miroku]] Bosatsu and the [[Chūgū-ji]] [[Gautama Buddha|Siddhartha]] statues.&lt;ref name="EB"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The Three Kingdoms of Korea, and particularly Baekje, were instrumental as active agents in the introduction and formation of a Buddhist tradition in Japan in 538 or 552.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN070071605X&amp;id=e1BzL2lwPqEC&amp;pg=PA33&amp;lpg=PA33&amp;dq=korean+buddhist+art&amp;sig=4XlpYzvL4PF3TKAR7BO3ZwFBXbg]&lt;/ref&gt;
They illustrate the terminal point of the [[Silk Road transmission of art]] during the first few centuries of our era. Other examples can be found in the development of the iconography of the Japanese [[Fūjin]] Wind God,&lt;ref&gt;"The Japanese wind god images do not belong to a separate tradition apart from that of their Western counter-parts but share the same origins.&amp;nbsp;... One of the characteristics of these Far Eastern wind god images is the wind bag held by this god with both hands, the origin of which can be traced back to the shawl or mantle worn by [[Anemoi#Boreas|Boreas]]/ Oado." (Katsumi Tanabe, "Alexander the Great, East-West cultural contacts from Greece to Japan", p21)&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Niō]] guardians,&lt;ref&gt;"The origin of the image of [[Vajrapani]] should be explained. This deity is the protector and guide of the Buddha Sakyamuni. His image was modeled after that of Hercules.&amp;nbsp;... The Gandharan Vajrapani was transformed in Central Asia and China and afterward transmitted to Japan, where it exerted stylistic influences on the wrestler-like statues of the Guardian Deities (Niō)." (Katsumi Tanabe, "Alexander the Great, East-West cultural contacts from Greece to Japan", p23)&lt;/ref&gt; and the near-[[classical antiquity|Classical]] floral patterns in temple decorations.&lt;ref&gt;The transmission of the floral scroll pattern from West to East is presented in the regular exhibition of Ancient Japanese Art, at the [[Tokyo National Museum]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Temple building in the 8th century was focused around the [[Tōdai-ji]] in Nara. Constructed as the headquarters for a network of temples in each of the provinces, the Tōdaiji is the most ambitious religious complex erected in the early centuries of Buddhist worship in Japan. Appropriately, the 16.2&amp;nbsp;m (53&amp;nbsp;ft) Buddha (completed 752) enshrined in the main Buddha hall, or ''Daibutsuden'', is a [[Rushana]] Buddha, the figure that represents the essence of Buddhahood, just as the Tōdaiji represented the center for Imperially sponsored Buddhism and its dissemination throughout Japan. Only a few fragments of the original statue survive, and the present hall and central Buddha are reconstructions from the [[Edo period]].

Under the [[Ritsuryō]] system of government in the [[Nara period]], Buddhism was heavily regulated by the state through the {{nihongo|Sōgō|僧綱||''Office of Priestly Affairs''}}.  During this time, Tōdai-ji served as the central administrative temple for the provincial temples&lt;ref name="abe"&gt;{{cite book | last = Abe | first = Ryuichi | title = The Weaving of Mantra: Kukai and the Construction of Esoteric Buddhist Discourse | publisher = Columbia University Press | year = 1999 | isbn = 0-231-11286-6 | pages=35, 55}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the [[Buddhism in Japan#Nara Period|six Buddhist schools in Japan]] at the time.

==[[Heian period]] (794–1185)==
[[File:Taizokai.jpg|thumb|right|Taizokai (Womb World) mandala, second half of ninth century. Hanging scroll, color on silk. The center square represents the young stage of [[Vairocana]] Buddha.]]

In 784, the [[Emperor Kanmu]] threatened by the growing secular power of the Buddhist institutions in Nara moved the capital to [[Heian-kyō]] (Kyōto), which remained the imperial capital for the next 1,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;Hurst 2007 p.32&lt;/ref&gt; The term Heian period refers to the years between 794 and 1185, when the [[Kamakura shogunate]] was established at the end of the [[Genpei War]]. The period is further divided into the early Heian and the late Heian, or Fujiwara era, the pivotal date being 894, the year imperial embassies to China were officially discontinued.

[[Buddhism]] began to spread throughout Japan during the Heian period, primarily through two major esoteric sects, [[Tendai]] and [[Shingon Buddhism|Shingon]]. Tendai originated in [[China]] and is based on the [[Lotus Sutra]], one of the most important [[sutra]]s of [[Mahayana]] Buddhism; [[Saichō]] was key to its transmission to Japan. [[Shingon Buddhism|Shingon]] (true word school) is an indigenous sect with close affiliations to Chinese influenced Buddhist thought founded by [[Kūkai]] (best known by his posthumous title Kōbō Daishi, 774–835) who traveled to China and studied Indian and Chinese Buddhism, as well as Chinese calligraphy and poetry. Emperor Kanmu himself was a notable patron of the [[Tendai]] sect, which rose to great power over the ensuing centuries. Kūkai greatly impressed the emperors who succeeded [[Emperor Kanmu]], and also generations of Japanese, not only with his holiness but also with his poetry, calligraphy, painting, and sculpture. Shingon Buddhist practice is based on various rituals, including the chanting of [[mantras]], [[Puja (Buddhism)|puja]], hand gestures ([[mudras]]) and meditation through visualization of [[mandala]]s. The central role of ritual in Japanese esoteric Buddhism led to a flourishing of the religious arts in the Heian period. These religious paintings, mandalas and statues provided practitioners with a way to contemplate on Buddhist deities and concepts. A famous example of Shingon Mandala is the Taizokai (Womb World) mandala. Part of the [[Mandala of the Two Realms]], the womb world is composed of 12 zones representing different dimensions of Buddha nature.&lt;ref name="Kleiner-p215"&gt;{{cite book| title = Garder's art through the ages, Fred S Kleiner. P 215.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the center sits the [[Vairocana]] Buddha within the lotus of compassion surrounded by attendant Buddhas and [[Bodhisattva]]s. The Shingon sect believed that all beings have an innate Buddha nature.
&lt;ref name="Kleiner-p215"/&gt;

The temples erected for the Shingon sect such as that at [[Mt. Kōya]] were built in the Kii mountains, far away from the Court and the laity in the capital. The irregular topography of these sites forced Japanese architects to rethink the problems of temple construction, and in so doing to choose more indigenous elements of design. Cypress-bark roofs replaced those of ceramic tile, wood planks were used instead of earthen floors, and a separate worship area for the laity was added in front of the main sanctuary. The temple that best reflects the spirit of early Heian Shingon temples is the Murō-ji (early 9th century), set deep in a stand of cypress trees on a mountain southeast of Nara.

In the [[Fujiwara clan|Fujiwara period]], [[Pure Land|Pure Land Buddhism]], which offered easy salvation through belief in [[Amitabha|Amida]] (the Buddha of the Western Paradise), became popular. This period is named after the [[Fujiwara clan]], then the most powerful in the country, who ruled as [[Sesshō and Kampaku|regents]] for the Emperor, becoming, in effect, civil dictators. Concurrently, the Kyoto nobility developed a society devoted to elegant aesthetic pursuits. 
The ''Hō-ō-dō'' (Phoenix Hall, completed 1053) of the [[Byōdō-in]], a temple in [[Uji, Kyoto|Uji]] to the southeast of Kyoto, is the exemplar of Fujiwara Amida halls. It consists of a main rectangular structure flanked by two L-shaped wing corridors and a tail corridor, set at the edge of a large artificial pond. Inside, a single golden image of Amida (c. 1053) is installed on a high platform. The Amida sculpture was executed by [[Jōchō]], who popularized the Chinese technique of creating a work from several smaller pieces of sculpted wood (''[[yosegi]]''). Although it limited the amount of surface detail the artist could carve into each piece, the method forced the sculptor to convey his intended message within these limits. This resulted in more refined and ephemeral-looking pieces.&lt;ref name="Paine-p93"&gt;Paine 93.&lt;/ref&gt; More importantly, it allowed several assistants to work on the sculpture at once, greatly speeding the process.&lt;ref name="Noma-p163"&gt;Noma 163.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jōchō]], as the master, did the finishing work.&lt;ref name="Mason-p144"&gt;Mason 144.&lt;/ref&gt; The technique also led to systematized [[Body proportions|proportion]]s of body parts and simple surface details, as these sped the creation of the constituent parts and the formation of the finished piece.&lt;ref name="Noma-p163" /&gt;

Art historians often cite this new [[canon (art)|canon]] of proportions as evidence of Jōchō's genius. He based the measurements on a unit equal to the distance between the sculpted figure's chin and hairline. The distance between each knee is equal to the distance from the bottoms of the legs to the hair.&lt;ref name="Mason-p144" /&gt; The widely spaced and level knees thus form the base of a triangular design, conveying a feeling of stability and peace. The effect is further accentuated by the contrast of other elements in the design, particularly the figures' [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]]s. These are intricately detailed, featuring dancing [[tennin]], clouds, and flames.&lt;ref name="Paine-p93" /&gt; Jōchō's sculptures' expressions convey compassion and elegance, and the detailed and precise carving of the facial features projects a certain kindness.&lt;ref name="Noma-p163" /&gt;

The workshop method of dividing work among several craftsmen caught on, as did Jōchō's style. His school was imitated by sculptors across Japan for the over next 150 years, as Japanese sculpture devolved into a conformist orthodoxy before being reinvented in the Kamakura period.&lt;ref&gt;Shively and McCullogh 421.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the rising importance of Pure Land sects of Japanese Buddhism in the tenth century, new image-types were developed to satisfy the devotional needs of these sects. These include Raigozu (来迎図), which depict Amida Buddha along with attendant Bodhisattvas Kannon and Seishi arriving to welcome the souls of the faithful departed to Amida's Western Paradise. A noted early example dating from 1053 are painted on the interior of the Phoenix Hall of the Byōdō-in, a temple in Uji, Kyoto. This is also considered an early example of so-called [[Yamato-e]] (大和絵), or "Japanese-style painting", insofar as it includes landscape elements such as soft rolling hills that seem to reflect something of the actual appearance of the landscape of western Japan. Stylistically, however, this type of painting continues to be informed by Tang Dynasty Chinese "blue and green style" landscape painting traditions. "Yamato-e" is an imprecise term that continues to be debated among historians of Japanese art.

Japan suffered a series of civil wars in the late 12th century between several rival families, which eventually led to the rise of the feudalistic [[Kamakura shogunate]], so named because the victorious family, the [[Minamoto clan]], established their political base in Kamakura. The Emperor remained in Kyoto as a figurehead but the actual political power rested with the ''[[shōgun]]''. The Kamakura period saw the reestablishment of cultural ties with China, as well as the growth of [[Zen Buddhism]] and [[Pure Land Buddhism]] as the two major branches of Japanese Buddhism.

These new Kamakura patrons also favored a more realistic and naturalistic art which is exemplified by the sculpture of the [[Kei school]]. The Kei school developed out of that led by the ''[[busshi]]'' (Buddhist sculptor) [[Jōchō]], his successor [[Kakujō]], and Kakujō's son [[Raijō]], the leading sculptors of the preceding generations. These artists are sometimes said to have founded the Kei school;&lt;ref name=jaanus&gt;"[http://www.aisf.or.jp/~jaanus/deta/k/keiha.htm Keiha]." ''Japanese Architecture and Art Users System (JAANUS).'' 2001. Accessed 17 November 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; however, the school would not come into its own, and become associated with the name "Kei" until Raijō was succeeded by [[Kōkei (sculptor)|Kōkei]] and [[Unkei]] around the year 1200.

Among sculptors of the [[Kei school]], [[Unkei]] is the most famous and considered to be the most accomplished sculptor of the period.&lt;ref name="Varley 94"&gt;Varley 94.&lt;/ref&gt; Among his works, a pair of large [[Nio]] (or Kongō Rikishi) in Tōdai-ji depict muscular guardians in a dramatic [[contrapposto]] stance.&lt;ref&gt;Mason 188.&lt;/ref&gt; Unkei's sculptures of Indian priests Mujaku and Seshin in [[Kōfuku-ji]] demonstrate a new portrait-like realism.&lt;ref&gt;Noma 85.&lt;/ref&gt; Both statues sport priestly vestments that frame their bodies realistically. They stand life-size and alone and are fully sculpted in the round as if intended to be viewed from any angle. Mujaku is depicted as a thin man manipulating some sort of holy, cloth-wrapped object. He appears reserved and reflective. Seshin, in contrast, is depicted in mid conversation, gesturing and speaking, an extroverted counterweight to the solemn Mujaku.&lt;ref&gt;Mason 190.&lt;/ref&gt; The men are shown as specific people, not simply members of a stock type.&lt;ref name="Paine 112"&gt;Paine 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Unkei]] had six sculptor sons and their work is also imbued with the new humanism. Tankei, the eldest son and a brilliant sculptor became the head of the studio. [[Kōshō]], the 4th son produced a remarkable sculpture of the 10th-century Japanese Buddhist teacher Kuya (903–972). [[Kaikei]] was a collaborator of [[Unkei]] and worked with him on the [[Nio]] statues in 1203. He worked with priest Chogen (1121–1206): the director of Tōdai-ji reconstruction project. Many of his figures are more idealized than Unkei and his sons, and are characterized by a beautifully finished surface, richly decorated with pigments and gold. His works have survived more than 40, many of which are signed by himself.

Much of the cities of [[Nara, Nara|Nara]] and [[Kyoto]] were destroyed in the [[Genpei War]] of 1180–1185. The [[Kei school]] was granted the opportunity to restore Nara's greatest temples, the [[Tōdai-ji]] and [[Kōfuku-ji]], replacing their Buddhist sculptures. The leading figure in this effort was Shunjobo Chogen (1121–1206), who was known to have made three trips to China to study sculpture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = Garder's art through the ages, Fred S Kleiner. P 218.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tōdai-ji restoration project lasted several generations, from roughly 1180 to 1212,&lt;ref name=munsterberg&gt;Munsterberg, Huge. ''The Arts of Japan: An Illustrated History''. Tokyo: Charles E. Tuttle Company, 1957. p98.&lt;/ref&gt; and drew extensively on [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]] and [[Song Dynasty|Song]] Chinese styles, introducing new stylistic elements while remaining true to tradition.

Some of the most popular paintings of the Kamakura period depict an ascending Amida Buddha. The main tenet of Pure Land Buddhism is that chanting the name of Amida could lead to a reincarnation in the pure land. Thus, scrolls of Amida would be hung in the room of the dying who would be saved by chanting the Amida mantra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = Garder's art through the ages, Fred S Kleiner. P 220.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Kamakura period new Buddhists sects, such as Kegon and Nichiren emerged and grew in popularity. These sects produced several distinct genres of painting, including the [[Suijako]] paintings, which tried to reconcile the two main Japanese faiths by depicting Shinto deities as early manifestations of Buddha. Works like the Kegon Engi Emaki, a book illustrated to help people understand complicated Chinese character, became more popular with ordinary people. Emakimono, or long illustrated hand scrolls, also served to illustrate the life of the Buddha and the history of key Buddhist leaders.

==[[Muromachi period]] (1333–1573)==

During the [[Muromachi period]], also called the Ashikaga period, a profound change took place in Japanese culture. The [[Ashikaga clan]] took control of the shogunate and moved its headquarters back to Kyoto, to the Muromachi district of the city. With the return of government to the capital, the popularizing trends of the Kamakura period came to an end, and cultural expression took on a more aristocratic, elitist character. During the Muromachi Period, [[Zen Buddhism]] rose to prominence especially among the elite [[Samurai]] class, who embraced the Zen values of personal discipline, concentration and self-development. 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = Gardner's art through the ages, Fred S Kleiner. P 736.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of the great Zen monasteries in Kamakura and Kyoto had a major impact on the visual arts. Because of secular ventures and trading missions to China organized by Zen temples, many Chinese paintings and objects of art were imported into Japan and profoundly influenced Japanese artists working for Zen temples and the shogunate. Not only did these imports change the subject matter of painting, but they also modified the use of color; the bright colors of [[Yamato-e]] yielded to the monochromes of painting in the Chinese manner of Sui-boku-ga (水墨画) or [[sumi-e]] (墨絵), this style mainly used only black ink — the same as used in East Asian calligraphy.

[[File:Shubun - Reading in a Bamboo Grove detail.jpg|thumb|upright|Detail of "Reading in a Bamboo Grove", 1446, [[Shūbun]]]]

The foremost painter of the new [[Sumi-e]] style was [[Sesshū Tōyō]] (1420–1506), a [[Rinzai]] priest who traveled to China in 1468–69 and studied contemporary Ming painting. Some of his most dramatic works are in the Chinese splashed-ink (Haboku) style.&lt;ref name="Kleiner-p737"&gt;{{cite book| title = Garder's art through the ages, Fred S Kleiner. P 737.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon returning to Japan, Sesshū built himself a studio and established a large following, painters that are now referred to as the Unkoku-rin school or "School of Sesshū". To make one of the calligraphic and highly stylized Haboku paintings, the painter would visualize the image and then made swift broad strokes into the paper resulting in a splashed and abstract composition, all done with meditative concentration. This impressionistic style of painting was supposed to capture the true nature of the subject. The [[Sumi-e]] style was highly influenced by calligraphy, using the same tools and style as well as its zen philosophy.&lt;ref name="Kleiner-p737"/&gt; To paint in this style the practitioner had to clear his mind and apply the brush strokes without too much thinking, termed {{nihongo|''[[mushin (mental state)|mushin]]''|無心|"no mind state"}} by the Japanese philosopher [[Nishida Kitaro]].&lt;ref name="yuko"&gt;{{cite web |title=Shodo History |url=http://www.zenshodo.com/history.htm |author=Solana Yuko Halada |work=Japanese Calligraphy in Zen Spirit |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110102204715/http://www.zenshodo.com/history.htm |archivedate=2011-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of [[mushin (mental state)|mushin]] is central to many Japanese arts including the art of the sword, archery and the tea ceremony.

By the end of the 14th century, monochrome landscape paintings (sansuiga) had found patronage by the ruling Ashikaga family and was the preferred genre among Zen painters, gradually evolving from its Chinese roots to a more Japanese style. Another important painter in this period is [[Tenshō Shūbun]], a monk at the Kyoto temple of [[Shōkoku-ji]] who traveled to Korea and studied under Chinese painters. He returned to Japan in 1404 and settled in Kyoto, then the capital city. He became director of the court painting bureau, established by Ashikaga shoguns, who were influential art patrons. Shūbun's most well-known landscape painting, designated as a National Treasure in Japan, is Reading in a Bamboo Grove, now kept in the Tokyo National Museum.

Another style which developed in the Muromachi period is [[Shigajiku]] (詩画軸). This is usually a painting accompanied by poetry and has its roots in China, where painting and poetry were seen as inherently connected. This style grew out of literary circles, an artist would usually be given a subject to paint and the poets would write accompanying verses to be written above the work. A famous example is the scroll "Catching a Catfish with a Gourd" (Hyōnen-zu 瓢鮎図) located at [[Taizō-in]], [[Myōshin-ji]], Kyoto. Created by the priest-painter [[Josetsu]] ({{circa|1386}} – {{circa|1428}}), it includes 31 verses of many Zen priests inscribed above the painting. 
&lt;ref name="yuko-2"&gt;{{cite web |title = JAANUS Japanese architecture and art net users system |url =http://www.aisf.or.jp/~jaanus/deta/s/shigajiku.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the foreground of the painting a man is depicted on the bank of a stream holding a small gourd and looking at a large slithery catfish. Mist fills the middle ground, and the background, mountains appear to be far in the distance. The painting was commissioned by the 4th Shogun of the Muromachi Period, Ashikaga Yoshimochi (1386-1428) and was based on the nonsensical riddle "How do you catch a catfish with a gourd?". An example of one of the Koans illustrates the style of the poetry inscribed above the painting.

&lt;poem&gt;:::Poised! With the Gourd
:::He tries to pin that slippery fish.
:::Some oil on the gourd
:::Would add zest to the chase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title = Circa 1492: art in the age of exploration, 1991, Jay A. Levenson. P 321–22.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:::::::::::(Shusu [1423] Trans. Matsushita, 1974)&lt;/poem&gt;

The painting and accompanying poems capture both the playfulness and the perplexing nature of Zen buddhist ''[[kōans]]'' which was supposed to aid the Zen practitioner in his meditation and was a central practice of the [[Rinzai]] school.

In the late Muromachi period, ink painting had migrated out of the Zen monasteries into the art world in general, as artists from the Kano school and the Ami school adopted the style and themes, but introducing a more plastic and decorative effect that would continue into modern times.

==[[Azuchi–Momoyama period]] (1573–1603)==
[[File:Hasegawa Tohaku - Pine Trees (Shōrin-zu byōbu) - left hand screen.jpg|thumb|250px|Left panel of the {{nihongo|''Pine Trees screen''|[[Shōrin-zu byōbu]]|松林図 屏風}} by [[Hasegawa Tōhaku]], c.1595]]

This period saw the rise of the [[Kanō school]] (狩野派 Kanō-ha?) which is one of the most famous schools of Japanese painting. The Kanō school of painting was the dominant style of painting until the Meiji period. It was founded by Kanō Masanobu (1434–1530), a contemporary of Sesshū and student of Shūbun who became an official painter in the Shogun's court. The artists who followed him including his son improved upon his style and methods. His son, [[Kanō Motonobu]] (1476–1559) established the Kano style as the main Japanese painting school during the Muromachi period.

In sharp contrast to the previous Muromachi period, the Azuchi Momoyama period was characterized by a grandiose polychrome style, with extensive use of [[gold]] and [[silver]] foil, and by works on a very large scale. [[Kanō school]] painters were patronized by [[Oda Nobunaga]], [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]], [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]], and their followers. [[Kanō Eitoku]] developed a formula for the creation of monumental landscapes on the sliding doors enclosing a room. These huge screens and wall paintings were commissioned to decorate the castles and palaces of the military nobility. This status continued into the subsequent Edo period, as the [[Tokugawa bakufu]] continued to promote the works of the Kanō school as the officially sanctioned art for the ''[[shōgun]]'', ''[[daimyō]]s'', and [[Imperial House of Japan|Imperial court]]. The rise of the Kanō school saw a beginning of a move away from buddhist themes, as Kano school patrons commissioned paintings of a more secular nature to decorate their palaces.

However some painters in this period continued to look back to the Buddhist priest-painters which had initially influenced the Kano school. One of these painters was [[Hasegawa Tōhaku]], who was influenced by the monochrome ink paintings of the Muromachi painter [[Sesshū]] and developed his own style of [[Sumi-e]] which looked back to the minimalism of its predecessors. Tōhaku was in fact so much enamored with the techniques of [[Sesshū Tōyō]] that he attempted to claim rights as his fifth successor, though he lost in a court battle to [[Unkoku Togan]].&lt;ref name="HASEGAWA"&gt;[http://www.kyoto.zaq.ne.jp/mibu/eng/pages/artworks/paintings/tohaku.html HASEGAWA Tohaku (1539–1610)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091208192923/http://www.kyoto.zaq.ne.jp/mibu/eng/pages/artworks/paintings/tohaku.html |date=2009-12-08 }} Mibura-Dera Temple Website. 10 Dec 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Still, the influence of Sesshū is evident in many of Tōhaku's mid to late works, such as his famous {{nihongo|''[[Shōrin-zu byōbu]]''|松林図 屏風|extra2=Pine Trees screen}}, which were declared a [[National Treasures of Japan|national treasure of Japan]] are argued to be the first paintings of their scale to depict only pine trees as subject matter.&lt;ref name="HASEGAWA"/&gt;

The school founded by Hasegawa Tōhaku is known today as the [[Hasegawa school]]. This school was small, consisting mostly of Tōhaku and his sons. However small, its members conserved Tōhaku's quiet and reserved aesthetic, which many attribute to the influence of [[Sesshū]] as well as his contemporary and friend, [[Sen no Rikyū]]. It is suspected that these simple aesthetics protest the usage of intimidation and wealth rampant in the [[Kanō school]].&lt;ref&gt;Moes, Robert D.. "The Other Side of Tōhaku".

===Zen art===
Under the Zen sect of Buddhism, which became very popular in Japan in the 14th and 15th centuries, portraits of Zen priests were often produced. Zen was a sect of Buddhism which promoted simplicity and less involved in worship, so religious paintings were not needed for this reason. Instead, Zen priests often painted images of teachers and Zen masters. Unlike in the earlier Heian period, where it had been considered "rude in Heian times to copy a person's likeness"{{attribution needed|date=January 2018}} (Stanley-Baker 2000, 115), the Zen portraits were close-up portraits showing facial features and details. A portrait of [[Zen Teacher/Zen Master|Zen master]] Muso Kokushi painted by his student Muto Shui, shows a detailed portrait of the face, with the whole picture being only a head and shoulders portrait. This is unlike earlier Japanese painting which would depict people as much smaller figures. Zen priests also painted landscapes, such as the [[Ink and wash painting|suiboku-ga]], or water and black ink painting, which was inspired by Zen doctrine.

==Architecture==
Buddhism exerted tremendous influence on [[Japanese art]] in a variety of ways and through many periods of Japanese history. [[Buddhist temples]] with their halls and five-story towers were built all over Japan, and huge sculptures of Buddha were made for these temples.

'''C-value''' is the amount, in [[picogram]]s, of [[DNA]] contained within a [[haploid]] [[Cell nucleus|nucleus]] (e.g. a [[gamete]]) or one half the amount in a [[diploid]] [[somatic cell]] of a [[eukaryotic]] organism. In some cases (notably among diploid organisms), the terms C-value and [[genome size]] are used interchangeably; however, in [[Polyploidy|polyploids]] the C-value may represent two or more [[genome]]s contained within the same nucleus. Greilhuber ''et al.''&lt;ref name="Greilhuber2005"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Greilhuber J, Doležel J, Lysák M, Bennett MD |year=2005 |title=The origin, evolution and proposed stabilization of the terms 'genome size' and 'C-value' to describe nuclear DNA contents |journal=Annals of Botany |volume=95 |doi=10.1093/aob/mci019 |pmid=15596473 |issue=1 |pages=255–60|pmc=4246724 }}&lt;/ref&gt; have suggested some new layers of terminology and associated abbreviations to clarify this issue, but these somewhat complex additions are yet to be used by other authors.

== Origin of the term ==
Many authors have incorrectly assumed that the 'C' in "C-value" refers to "characteristic", "content", or "complement".  Even among authors who have attempted to trace the origin of the term, there had been some confusion because Hewson Swift did not define it explicitly when he coined it in 1950.&lt;ref name="Swift1950"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Swift H |year=1950 |title=The constancy of deoxyribose nucleic acid in plant nuclei |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA |volume=36 |issue=11 |pages=643–654|pmid=14808154 |pmc=1063260 |doi=10.1073/pnas.36.11.643}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his original paper, Swift appeared to use the designation "1C value", "2C value", etc., in reference to "classes" of DNA content (e.g., Gregory 2001,&lt;ref name="Gregory2001"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gregory TR |year=2001 |title=Coincidence, coevolution, or causation? DNA content, cell size, and the C-value enigma |journal=Biological Reviews |volume=76 | doi = 10.1017/S1464793100005595 | pmid=11325054 |issue=1 |pages=65–101}}&lt;/ref&gt; 2002&lt;ref name="Gregory2002"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gregory TR |year=2002 |title=A bird's-eye view of the C-value enigma: genome size, cell size, and metabolic rate in the class Aves |journal=Evolution |volume=56 |pmid=11913657 |issue=1 |pages=121–30 |doi=10.1111/j.0014-3820.2002.tb00854.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;); however, Swift explained in personal correspondence to Prof. Michael D. Bennett in 1975 that "I am afraid the letter C stood for nothing more glamorous than 'constant', i.e., the amount of DNA that was characteristic of a particular [[genotype]]" (quoted in Bennett and Leitch 2005&lt;ref name="Bennett2005"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Bennett MD, Leitch IJ |year=2005 |chapter=Genome size evolution in plants |title=[[The Evolution of the Genome]] |editor=T.R. Gregory |pages=89–162 |publisher=Elsevier |location=San Diego}}&lt;/ref&gt;). This is in reference to the report in 1948 by Vendrely and Vendrely of a "remarkable constancy in the nuclear DNA content of all the cells in all the individuals within a given animal species" (translated from the original [[French language|French]]).&lt;ref name="Vendrely1948"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Vendrely R, Vendrely C |year=1948 |title=La teneur du noyau cellulaire en acide désoxyribonucléique à travers les organes, les individus et les espèces animales&amp;nbsp;: Techniques et premiers résultats |journal=Experientia |volume=4 |issue=11 |pages=434–436 |language=French|pmid=18098821 |last2=Vendrely |doi=10.1007/bf02144998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Swift's study of this topic related specifically to variation (or lack thereof) among [[chromosome]] sets in different cell types within individuals, but his notation evolved into "C-value" in reference to the haploid DNA content of individual species and retains this usage today.

== Variation among species ==

C-values vary enormously among species. In animals they range more than 3,300-fold, and in land plants they differ by a factor of about 1,000.&lt;ref name="Bennett2005"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gregory2005"&gt;{{cite book |author=Gregory TR |year=2005 |chapter=Genome size evolution in animals |title=[[The Evolution of the Genome]] |editor=T.R. Gregory |pages=3–87 |publisher=Elsevier |location=San Diego}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Protist]] genomes have been reported to vary more than 300,000-fold in size, but the high end of this range ([[Amoeba (genus)|''Amoeba'']]) has been called into question.  Variation in C-values bears no relationship to the complexity of the organism or the number of [[genes]] contained in its genome; for example, some single-celled [[protozoa|protists]] have genomes much larger than that of [[humans]]. This observation was deemed counterintuitive before the discovery of [[non-coding DNA]]. It became known as the C-value paradox as a result.  However, although there is no longer any [[paradox]]ical aspect to the discrepancy between C-value and gene number, this term remains in common usage.  For reasons of conceptual clarification, the various puzzles that remain with regard to genome size variation instead have been suggested to more accurately comprise a complex but clearly defined puzzle known as the C-value enigma.  C-values correlate with a range of features at the [[Cell (biology)|cell]] and organism levels, including [[cell size]], [[cell division]] rate, and, depending on the [[taxon]], body size, [[metabolic rate]], developmental rate, [[Organ (anatomy)|organ]] complexity, geographical distribution, or [[extinction]] risk (for recent reviews, see Bennett and Leitch 2005;&lt;ref name="Bennett2005"/&gt; Gregory 2005&lt;ref name="Gregory2005"/&gt;).

The '''C-value enigma''' or '''C-value paradox''' is the complex puzzle surrounding the extensive variation in nuclear [[genome size]] among [[eukaryotic]] species. At the center of the C-value enigma is the observation that genome size does not correlate with organismal complexity; for example, some single-celled [[protozoa|protists]] have genomes much larger than that of [[humans]].

Some prefer the term C-value enigma because it explicitly includes all of the questions that will need to be answered if a complete understanding of [[genome size]] [[evolution]] is to be achieved (Gregory 2005). Moreover, the term [[paradox]] implies a lack of understanding of one of the most basic features of eukaryotic genomes: namely that they are composed primarily of [[non-coding DNA]]. Some have claimed that the term paradox also has the unfortunate tendency to lead authors to seek simple one-dimensional solutions to what is, in actuality, a multi-faceted puzzle.&lt;ref name="kew" /&gt; For these reasons, in 2003 the term "C-value enigma" was endorsed in preference to "C-value paradox" at the Second Plant Genome Size Discussion Meeting and Workshop at the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew]], [[United Kingdom|UK]],&lt;ref name=kew&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.rbgkew.org.uk/cval/pgsm/index.html# |title=Second Plant Genome Size Discussion Meeting and Workshop |access-date=2015-04-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201130244/http://www.rbgkew.org.uk/cval/pgsm/index.html# |archive-date=2008-12-01 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
and an increasing number of authors have begun adopting this term.

=== C-value paradox ===
In 1948, Roger and Colette Vendrely reported a "remarkable constancy in the nuclear DNA content of all the cells in all the individuals within a given animal species",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Vendrely R, Vendrely C|year=1948 |title=La teneur du noyau cellulaire en acide désoxyribonucléique à travers les organes, les individus et les espèces animales: Techniques et premiers résultats |journal=Experientia |volume=4 |pages=434–436 |doi=10.1007/bf02144998 |pmid=18098821 |issue=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; which they took as evidence that [[DNA]], rather than [[protein]], was the substance of which [[genes]] are composed. The term C-value reflects this observed constancy. However, it was soon found that C-values ([[genome size]]s) vary enormously among species and that this bears no relationship to the ''presumed'' number of genes (''as reflected by'' the [[complexity]] of the [[organism]]). For example, the [[Somatic cells|cells]] of some [[salamanders]] may contain 40 times more DNA than those of humans.&lt;ref name="Gregory, T.R. (2013). Animal Genome Size Database"&gt;{{cite web|title=Animal Genome Size Database|url=http://www.genomesize.com/statistics.php?stats=amphibs|accessdate=14 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given that C-values were assumed to be constant because genetic information is encoded by DNA, and yet bore no relationship to presumed gene number, this was understandably considered [[paradox]]ical; the term "C-value paradox" was used to describe this situation by C.A. Thomas, Jr. in 1971.

The discovery of [[non-coding DNA]] in the early 1970s resolved the main question of the C-value paradox: [[genome size]] does not reflect [[gene]] number in [[eukaryotes]] since most of their DNA is non-coding and therefore does not consist of genes. The [[human genome]], for example, comprises less than 2% protein-coding regions, with the remainder being various types of non-coding DNA (especially [[transposable elements]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

=== C-value enigma ===
The term "C-value enigma" represents an update of the more common but outdated term "C-value paradox" (Thomas 1971), being ultimately derived from the term "C-value" (Swift 1950) in reference to [[haploid]] [[Cell nucleus|nuclear]] [[DNA]] contents. The term was coined by Canadian biologist [[T. Ryan Gregory|Dr. T. Ryan Gregory]] of the [[University of Guelph]] in 2000/2001. In general terms, the C-value enigma relates to the issue of variation in the amount of [[non-coding DNA]] found within the [[genome]]s of different eukaryotes.

The C-value enigma, unlike the older C-value paradox, is explicitly defined as a series of independent but equally important component questions, including:

* What types of non-coding DNA are found in different eukaryotic genomes, and in what proportions?
* From where does this non-coding DNA come, and how is it spread and/or lost from genomes over time?
* What effects, or perhaps even functions, does this non-coding DNA have for [[chromosomes]], [[Cell nucleus|nuclei]], [[Somatic cells|cells]], and [[organisms]]?
* Why do some species exhibit remarkably streamlined chromosomes, while others possess massive amounts of non-coding DNA?

†Source of table: Doležel ''et al.'', 2003&lt;ref name="Dolezel2003"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Doležel J, Bartoš J, Voglmayr H, Greilhuber J |title=Letter to the editor: Nuclear DNA Content and Genome Size of Trout and Human |journal=Cytometry |volume=51A |issue=2 |pages=127–128 |year=2003 |doi=10.1002/cyto.a.10013 |pmid=12541287}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

The formulas for converting the number of nucleotide pairs (or base pairs) to picograms of DNA and vice versa are:&lt;ref name="Dolezel2003"/&gt;
 genome size (bp) = (0.978 x 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;) x DNA content (pg)
 DNA content (pg) = genome size (bp) / (0.978 x 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;)
 1 pg = 978 Mbp

By using the data in Table 1, relative masses of nucleotide pairs can be calculated as follows: A/T = 615.383 and G/C = 616.3711, bearing in mind that formation of one phosphodiester linkage involves a loss of one H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O molecule. Further, phosphates of nucleotides in the DNA chain are acidic, so at physiologic pH the H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ion is dissociated. Provided the ratio of A/T to G/C pairs is 1:1 (the [[GC-content]] is 50%), the mean relative mass of one nucleotide pair is 615.8771.

The relative molecular mass may be converted to an absolute value by multiplying it by the [[atomic mass unit]] (1 u) in picograms. Thus, 615.8771 is multiplied by 1.660539 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt; pg. Consequently, the mean mass per nucleotide pair would be 1.023 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt; pg, and 1 pg of DNA would represent 0.978 × 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; base pairs (978 Mbp).&lt;ref name="Dolezel2003"/&gt;

No species has a GC-content of exactly 50% (equal amounts of A/T and G/C nucleotide bases) as assumed by Doležel ''et al.''  However, as a G/C pair is only heavier than an A/T pair by about 1/6 of 1%, the effect of variations in GC content is small.  The actual GC content varies between species, between chromosomes, and between [[Isochore (genetics)|isochores]] (sections of a chromosome with like GC content).  Adjusting Doležel's calculation for GC content, the theoretical variation in base pairs per picogram ranges from 977.0317 Mbp/pg for 100% GC content to 978.6005 Mbp/pg for 0% GC content (A/T being lighter, has more Mbp/pg), with a midpoint of 977.8155 Mbp/pg for 50% GC content.

The X gamete and Y gamete both contain 22 autosomes whose combined lengths comprise the majority of the genome in both gametes.  The X gamete contains an [[X chromosome]], while the Y gamete contains a [[Y chromosome]].  The larger size of the X chromosome is responsible for the difference in the size of the two gametes. When the gametes are combined, the XX female zygote has a size of 6,062,084,834 bp while the XY male zygote has a size 5,963,271,354 bp. However, the base pairs of the XX female zygote are distributed among 2 homologous groups of 23 heterologous chromosomes each, while the base pairs of the XY male zygote are distributed among 2 homologous groups of 22 heterologous chromosomes each plus 2 heterologous chromosomes. Although each zygote has 46 chromosomes, 23 chromosomes of the XX female zygote are heterologous while 24 chromosomes of the XY male zygote are heterologous. As a result, the C-value for the XX female zygote is 3.099361 while the C-value for the XY male zygote is 3.157877.

'''Caring in intimate relationships''' is the practice of providing care and support to an [[intimate relationship]] partner. Caregiving behaviours are aimed at reducing the partner's distress and supporting his or her coping efforts in situations of either threat or challenge. Caregiving may include emotional support (expressions of care, affection, sympathy, and encouragement) and/or instrumental support (provision of information, advice, and tangible resources).&lt;ref name=CollinsGuichard2006&gt;{{cite book|last=Collins|first=N. L.|title=Dynamics of romantic love: Attachment, caregiving, and sex |year=2006|publisher=Guilford Press|location=New York|pages=149–189|author2=Guichard, A.C.|author3=Ford, M.B.|author4=Feeney, B.C. |editor=Mikulincer, M. |editor2=Goodman, G. S.|chapter=An attachment-theoretical approach to caregiving in romantic relationships}}&lt;/ref&gt; Effective caregiving behaviour enhances the care-recipient's psychological well-being, as well as the quality of the relationship between the caregiver and the care-recipient.&lt;ref name=CollinsFeeney2000/&gt; However, certain suboptimal caregiving strategies may be either ineffective or even detrimental to coping.&lt;ref name=Coyne1988/&gt;

==The caregiving behavioural system==

===Evolutionary origins===

[[Attachment theory]], an influential theoretical framework for the study of intimate relationships and personality development, argues that all humans are born with the capacity and motivation to engage in caregiving behaviours aimed at providing protection and support to close others.&lt;ref name=Bowlby1969/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bowlby1988/&gt; These behaviours are organized by an innate behavioural system, called the ''caregiving system'', which is believed to have emerged over the course of primate [[evolution]] to ensure the survival of vulnerable offspring. That is, because infants in many primate species, including humans, are highly [[altricial]] (''i.e.'', developmentally immature and helpless at birth), they cannot survive without caregiver support and protection.&lt;ref name=Bowlby1969/&gt;&lt;ref name=Panksepp1998&gt;{{cite book|last=Panksepp|first=J.|title=Affective neuroscience: The foundations of human and animal emotions|year=1998|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-517805-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attachment theory proposes that this evolutionary pressure favoured the emergence of the caregiving behavioural system, which functions to safeguard the vulnerable dependent from harm by providing him or her with protection, comfort, and help during times of threat or need.&lt;ref name=CollinsFeeney2000&gt;{{cite journal|last=Collins|first=N. L.|author2=Feeney, B. C.|title=A safe haven: An attachment theory perspective on support-seeking and caregiving in adult romantic relationships|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=2000|volume=78|pages=1053–1073|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.78.6.1053|pmid=10870908}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bowlby1969/&gt;&lt;ref name=CollinsFord2010&gt;{{cite journal|last=Collins|first=N.

J.|title=Advances in personal relationships|year=1994|publisher=Jessica Kingsley|location=London|pages=205–237|author2=Shaver, P. R.|editor=Bartholomew, L. |editor2=Perlman, D.|chapter=An attachment-theoretical approach to caregiving in romantic relationships}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Functions of the caregiving system===

According to attachment theory, the two goals of the caregiving behavioural system are to protect close others from harm and decrease their suffering during times of threat, and to promote close others’ personal growth and exploratory behaviour.&lt;ref name=CollinsGuichard2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bowlby1969/&gt;&lt;ref name=MikulincerShaver2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=KunceShaver1994/&gt; Attachment theorists call the former aspect of caregiving behaviour “providing a safe haven”, and the latter “providing a secure base”. The caregiving system is therefore likely to be activated when an individual perceives that a close relationship partner is experiencing danger or distress, or when the partner has an opportunity for exploration, learning, or mastery of a new skill, and could benefit from help in pursuing the opportunity or from celebration of his/her accomplishments and goal strivings.&lt;ref name=CollinsGuichard2006/&gt;

===Interrelation with attachment system===
{{See also|Attachment theory}}

Attachment theory also postulates that all humans possess an innate attachment behavioural system that motivates them to seek proximity to a caregiver (also called an attachment figure) during times of threat or need.&lt;ref name=Bowlby1969/&gt; Caregiving behaviour is therefore complimentary to attachment behaviour. Furthermore, attachment theory argues that the effectiveness of the caregiving behaviour enacted determines the quality of the attachment bond between the caregiver and care-recipient, as well as shapes the care-recipient’s general expectations of social support.&lt;ref name=Ainsworth1978/&gt; In this model, a history of receiving effective care from intimate others (whether parents in childhood or romantic partners in adulthood) promotes a sense of attachment security – an interpersonal orientation characterized by the expectation that other people may be relied on for support, and subsequent comfort with intimacy and emotional closeness. In contrast, a history of interactions with cold or rejecting caregivers promotes attachment avoidance – an interpersonal orientation marked by discomfort with intimacy, a reluctance to rely on others for support, and the tendency to suppress emotional distress. Care that is inconsistent or intrusive is believed to foster attachment anxiety, which is characterized by excessive preoccupation with intimate relationships and inability to effectively regulate one’s own emotional distress.&lt;ref name=MikulincerShaver2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ainsworth1978/&gt;

==Effective caregiving==

===Key concepts===

The central component of effective caregiving is the taking on of what Batson (1991) called an ''empathic stance''&lt;ref name=Batson1991&gt;{{cite book|last=Batson|first=C.D.|title=The altruism question: Toward a social-psychological answer|year=1991|publisher=Erlbaum|location=Hillsdale, NJ|isbn=978-0805802450}}&lt;/ref&gt; toward another person's suffering or needs.&lt;ref name=CollinsGuichard2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=MikulincerShaver2007/&gt; This means adopting the perspective, or "putting oneself in the shoes", of the partner in order to help lessen his or her distress in a stressful situation, or to help him or her pursue personal growth and development goals in challenging contexts. The empathic stance is characterized by two key, related components: ''sensitivity'' and ''responsiveness'' (although note that these terms are sometimes used interchangeably in the caregiving and social support literatures).&lt;ref name=CollinsGuichard2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=KunceShaver1994/&gt;&lt;ref name=Neff2005&gt;{{cite journal|last=Neff|first=L. A.|author2=Karney, B. R.|title=Gender differences in social support: A question of skill or responsiveness?|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=2005|volume=88|pages=79–90|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.88.1.79}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sensitivity refers to the ability to effectively detect and interpret the partner's cues of distress, worry, or need, and to provide the type and amount of support that is well matched to the partner's wants and needs. This tailoring of caregiving efforts to the particular characteristics of the specific situation is essential for effective care.&lt;ref name=Cutrona1990&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cutrona|first=C.E.|title=Stress and social support - in search of optimal matching|journal=Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology|year=1990|volume=9|issue=1|pages=3–14|doi=10.1521/jscp.1990.9.1.3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Responsiveness is the ability to provide support in a way that makes the partner feel understood (i.e., the caregiver has accurately captured the speaker's problem, needs, and emotions), validated (i.e., the caregiver confirms that the care recipient is a valued individual and that his or her feelings and responses in the situation are reasonable), and cared for (i.e., caregiver should communicate affection and concern).&lt;ref name=CollinsGuichard2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=Cutrona1996&gt;{{cite book|last=Cutrona|first=C.E.|title=Social support in couples: Marriage as a resource in times of stress|year=1996|publisher=Sage|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|isbn=978-0803948846}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Reis1988&gt;{{cite book|last=Reis|first=H.

===Invisible support===

Even well-intentioned support can negatively impact the care recipient's psychological adjustment to stressful events if it is inappropriate or excessive,&lt;ref name=Coyne1988&gt;{{cite book|last=Coyne|first=J.

C.|title=Invisible support and adjustment to stress|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=2000|volume=79|pages=953–961|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.79.6.953}}&lt;/ref&gt; To investigate this proposition, the researchers recruited couples in which one member was a law student preparing to undergo a highly stressful event, the New York State [[Bar Examination]], and had both members of the couple complete daily diary entries about given and received emotional support. They found that the law students exhibited ''heightened'' levels of depression on days they reported receiving support, but ''lowered'' levels of depression on the days when their partners reported providing more support than the law students reported receiving. That is, participants in this study gained most psychological benefits from support they were not explicitly aware of having received. However, other researchers have argued that the [[#Key concepts|''responsiveness'']] of enacted support is a more important factor than the visibility of the support.&lt;ref name=Maisel2009&gt;{{cite journal|last=Maisel|first=N. C.|author2=Gable, S. L.|title=The paradox of received social support|journal=Psychological Science|year=2009|volume=20|pages=928–932|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9280.2009.02388.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study examining the effects of visible and invisible support on emotional and relationship well-being showed that visible support was linked to neutral or positive outcomes when it was high in responsiveness, and invisible support was linked to negative outcomes when it was low in responsiveness.&lt;ref name=Maisel2009/&gt; That is, visible support is not always negative and invisible support is not always positive, but the effectiveness of both types of support hinges on responsiveness.

===Definition and functions===

In addition to giving support and reassurance during distress, another important function of caregiving within intimate relationships is the provision of support for a relationship partner's personal growth, exploration, and goal strivings.&lt;ref name=Bowlby1969&gt;{{cite book|last=Bowlby|first=J|title=Attachment and loss. Vol 1: Attachment|year=1969|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=0-465-00543-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Bowlby1988&gt;{{cite book|last=Bowlby|first=J|title=A secure base|year=1988|publisher=Basic Books|location=New York|isbn=0-422-62230-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Feeney2004&gt;{{cite journal|last=Feeney|first=B.

D. S.|title=Patterns of attachment: A psychological study of the strange situation|year=1978|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|location=Hillsdale, NJ|isbn=0898594618|author2=Blehar, M. C.|author3=Waters, E.|author4=Wall, S.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This phenomenon was originally observed in young children; children whose parents showed more intrusiveness were less likely to engage in play and exploration in a novel environment.&lt;ref name=Ainsworth1978/&gt;

===Components of the secure base===

Feeney and Thrush (2010) have identified three main functional components of secure base caregiving.&lt;ref name=FeeneyThrush2010/&gt; First, individuals can support their relationship partner's exploratory, autonomous behaviour by ''being available in case support is needed''. This can include actions such as removing obstacles to the partner's goal pursuit (for example, taking over some household chores to free up time for the partner to engage in a new activity), being sensitive and responsive to the partner's communications of distress, and communicating readiness to help in the event that support becomes needed. Second, effective caregiving does not ''unnecessarily interfere with exploration''. That is, effective caregivers do not provide support when it is neither needed nor desired, attempt to take over or control the activity, or disrupt the partner's goal strivings. Third, partners should communicate ''encouragement and acceptance of exploration'' (i.e., convey enthusiasm about the pursuit rather than suggest that it is not worthwhile or will somehow detract from the relationship). Individuals who perceive their partners to be available to help are more persistent in the performance of challenging activities, whereas individuals whose partners show more interference during an activity show less persistence at the task, poorer performance, less enthusiasm for the challenge, greater negativity/hostility toward their partner, and decreases in [[self-esteem]]. Partners' communications of enthusiasm are related to better performance, heightened enthusiasm, better mood, increases in state self-esteem, enhanced self-perceptions, greater enjoyment, and more positive feelings toward the partner.

===Dependency paradox===

All humans have a fundamental, evolutionarily-rooted need to feel socially connected to other people (i.e., to achieve "[[belongingness]]" or "relatedness").&lt;ref name=BaumeisterLeary1995&gt;{{cite journal|last=Baumeister|first=R. F.|author2=Leary, M. R.|title=The need to belong: Desire for interpersonal attachments as a fundamental human motivation|journal=Psychological Bulletin|year=1995|volume=117|pages=497–529|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.117.3.497|pmid=7777651}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RyanDeci2000&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ryan|first=R. M.|author2=Deci, E. L.|title=Self-determination theory and the facilitation of intrinsic motivation, social development, and well-being|journal=American Psychologist|year=2000|volume=55|pages=68–78|doi=10.1037/0003-066x.55.1.68}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simultaneously, people also hold a need for "autonomy", or the desire to maintain a sense of independence and self-sufficiency.&lt;ref name=RyanDeci2000/&gt; While these two psychological needs may initially appear to be contradictory (that is, it is not readily apparent how people may reconcile their need for social connection with their need for independence), psychological research shows that individuals who are more dependent on their intimate partners for support actually experience ''more'' autonomy, rather than less (a phenomenon that has been labelled the "dependency paradox").&lt;ref name=Feeney2007&gt;{{cite journal|last=Feeney|first=B. C.|title=The dependency paradox in close relationships: Accepting dependence promotes independence|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=2007|volume=92|pages=268–285|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.92.2.268|pmid=17279849}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Feeney (2007) showed that individuals whose romantic partners were more comfortable with having their partner depend on them were more likely to ''independently'' pursue and achieve their personal goals over a period of 6 months (without their partner's direct assistance).&lt;ref name=Feeney2007/&gt; Such research is consistent with the idea that the most effective type of support for promoting personal growth (e.g., accepting challenges, trying new things, exploring) is support that involves simply communicating availability, and that individuals who feel confident in the availability of a ''secure base'' to fall back on in case their goal pursuits go wrong are less likely to actually over-rely on their secure base.&lt;ref name=Feeney2004/&gt;&lt;ref name=FeeneyThrush2010/&gt;

==Capitalization==

In psychology, ''capitalization'' refers to the process of drawing additional benefits (e.g., increases in good mood) from a positive event by sharing it with other people.&lt;ref name=Langston1994&gt;{{cite journal|last=Langston|first=C. A.|title=Capitalizing on and coping with daily-life events: Expressive responses to positive events|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1994|volume=6|pages=1112–1125|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.67.6.1112}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research shows that individuals who share news of a positive event (such as, for example, acceptance to graduate school or a promotion at work) with a close other and receive a supportive response from that person, show increases in positive emotions and personal well-being above and beyond the boost given by the positive event itself.&lt;ref name=Gable2004&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gable|first=S. L.|author2=Reis, H. T.|author3=Impett, E.|author4=Asher, E. R.|title=What do you do when things go right? The intrapersonal and interpersonal benefits of sharing positive events|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=2004|volume=87|pages=228–245|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.87.2.228|pmid=15301629}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lambert2013&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lambert|first=N. M.|author2=Gwinn, A. M.|author3=Baumeister, R. F.|author4=Fincham, F. D.|author5=Gable, S. L.|author6=Strachman, A.|author7=Washburn, I. J.|title=A boost of positive affect: The perks of sharing positive and grateful experiences|journal=Journal of Social and Personal Relationships|year=2004|volume=30|pages=24–43|doi=10.1177/0265407512449400}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, support for positive event sharing has positive implications for relationship well-being. Specifically, receipt of such support increases feelings of trust and the endorsement of a more prosocial orientation (i.e., the willingness to respond positively in an unpleasant or conflict situation involving one's relationship partner).&lt;ref name=Reis2010&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reis|first=H. T.|author2=Smith, S. M.|author3=Carmichael, C. L.|author4=Caprariello, P. A.|author5=Tsai, F.|author6=Rodrigues, A.|author7=Maniaci, M. R.|title=Are you happy for me? How sharing positive events with others provides personal and interpersonal benefits|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=2010|volume=99|pages=311–329|doi=10.1037/a0018344|pmid=20658846}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, support for positive event sharing is more strongly linked to higher levels of relationship quality and lower likelihood of break-ups in the future than support extended during discussion of negative events.&lt;ref name=Gable2006&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gable|first=S. L.|author2=Gonzaga, G. C.|author3=Strachman, A.|title=Will you be there for me when things go right? Supportive responses to positive event disclosures|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=2006|volume=91|pages=904–917|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.91.5.904|pmid=17059309}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gable and colleagues&lt;ref name=Gable2004/&gt; have delineated four basic types of responses individuals may exhibit when a relationship partner shares a positive event with them. ''Active-constructive'' responses clearly communicate enthusiasm for the positive event, ''passive-constructive'' responses express support in a quiet, understated way, ''active-destructive'' responses squash the event and the partner's enthusiasm (e.g., by pointing out potential down sides of the positive event), and ''passive-destructive'' responses ignore and/or communicate disinterest in the event. Only active-constructive responses are associated with emotional and relationship well-being.&lt;ref name=Gable2004/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lambert2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gable2006/&gt;

==Variability in caregiving==

Although the tendency to care for intimate others is universal,&lt;ref name=Bowlby1969/&gt; there is wide variability in the quality and amount of caregiving that individuals enact.&lt;ref name=FeeneyCollins2001/&gt;&lt;ref name=Bolger1996&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bolger|first=N.|author2=Foster, M.|author3=Vinokur, A. D.|author4=Ng, R.|title=Close relationships and adjustment to a life crisis: The case of breast cancer|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1996|volume=70|pages=283–294|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.70.2.283}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rini2006&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rini|first=C. |author2=Dunkel Schetter, C. |author3=Hobel, C.

E.|author4=Fujita, K.|author5=Bolger, N.|title=Modeling Support Provision in Intimate Relationships|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=2008|volume=94|pages=460–478|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.94.3.460|pmid=18284292}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DunkelSchetter1990&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dunkel Schetter|first=C.|author2=Skokan, L.

===Caregiver characteristics===

====Motivation====

As effective caregiving involves a great amount of responsibility, as well as the expenditure of cognitive, emotional, and/or tangible resources, caregivers must be sufficiently ''motivated'' in order to provide responsive support to their relationship partner.&lt;ref name=FeeneyCollins2001&gt;{{cite journal|last=Feeney|first=B. C.|author2=Collins, N. L.|title=Predictors of caregiving in adult intimate relationships: An attachment theoretical perspective|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=2001|volume=80|pages=972–994|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.80.6.972}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FeeneyCollins2003&gt;{{cite journal|last=Feeney|first=B. C.|author2=Collins, N. L.|title=Motivations for caregiving in adult intimate relationships: Influences on caregiving behavior and relationship functioning|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|year=2003|volume=29|pages=950–968|doi=10.1177/0146167203252807}}&lt;/ref&gt; That is, people who do not possess enough motivation to help will be less effective at providing care that is appropriate for their partner's needs. Furthermore, individuals may differ in the degree to which they hold ''[[altruistic]]'' versus ''[[Egotism|egoistic]]'' motivations for helping.&lt;ref name=FeeneyCollins2003/&gt; ''Altruistic'' motivations are centred on the desire to advance the significant other's welfare, whereas ''egoistic'' motivations are centred on the desire to gain benefits for oneself, or to avoid sanctions for not helping and/or other negative consequences to the self.&lt;ref name=BatsonShaw1991&gt;{{cite journal|last=Batson|first=C. D.|author2=Shaw, L. L.|title=Evidence for altruism: Toward a pluralism of prosocial motives|journal=Psychological Inquiry|year=1991|volume=2|pages=107–122|doi=10.1207/s15327965pli0202_1}}&lt;/ref&gt; More altruistic and less egoistic motivations for caregiving are linked to better outcomes for the care recipient and enhanced relationship quality.&lt;ref name=FeeneyCollins2003/&gt;

Another relevant line of research inquiry has demonstrated that individuals in romantic relationships may hold either ''approach'' or ''avoidance'' motivations for making sacrifices for their partner, and the particular type of motivation endorsed influences personal well-being and relationship quality.&lt;ref name=Impett2005&gt;{{cite journal|last=Impett|first=E. A.|author2=Gable, S. L.|author3=Peplau, L. A.|title=Giving up and giving in: The costs and benefits of daily sacrifice in intimate relationships|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=2005|volume=89|pages=327–344|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.89.3.327|pmid=16248717}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Impett2010&gt;{{cite journal|last=Impett|first=E. A.|author2=Gordon, A. M.|author3=Kogan, A.|author4=Oveis, C.|author5=Gable, S. L.|author6=Keltner, D.|title=Moving toward more perfect unions: Daily and long-term consequences of approach and avoidance goals in romantic relationships|year=2010|volume=99|pages=948–963|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|doi=10.1037/a0020271|pmid=20658838}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Approach motivations are oriented toward ''gaining positive outcomes'', such as increases in intimacy or the partner's happiness. Avoidance motivations are oriented toward ''avoiding negative outcomes'', such as conflict or the partner's loss of interest in the relationship. Sacrifice for approach motives is associated with more positive emotions and greater life and relationship satisfaction for both partners, as well as less relationship conflict. In contrast, sacrifice for avoidance motives is linked to less life and relationship satisfaction for both partners, more negative emotions and conflict for the person making the sacrifice, less positive emotions for the sacrifice recipient, as well as greater likelihood of breaking up.&lt;ref name=Impett2005/&gt;

====Skills, abilities, and resources====

Effective caregiving requires knowledge about how to support others, as well as sufficient cognitive and self-regulatory resources.&lt;ref name=CollinsFord2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=MikulincerShaver2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=FeeneyCollins2001/&gt; For example, caregivers must be able to regulate the negative emotions aroused by witnessing another person in distress.&lt;ref name=MikulincerShaver2007/&gt; Failure of this emotional regulation may lead the caregiver to become overcome by their [[personal distress]], adopt the role of a needy person rather than the caregiver, or to distance him- or herself from the partner as a way of regulating that distress.&lt;ref name=MikulincerShaver2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=Batson1991/&gt; Research shows that particularly severe or chronic stressors may overwhelm the caregiver and decrease his/her ability to provide support to the partner. For example, Bolger, Foster, Vinokur, and Ng (1996) found that breast cancer patients who experienced the ''highest'' levels of distress in the month immediately following their diagnosis were ''less'' likely to receive support from their husbands over the following six months.&lt;ref name=Bolger1996/&gt;

Another relevant skill is called [[empathic accuracy]], which is defined as the “ability to accurately infer the specific content of another person’s thoughts and feelings (Ickes, 1993, p.&amp;nbsp;588).&lt;ref name=Ickes1993&gt;{{cite journal|last= Ickes |first=W.|title= Empathic accuracy|year=1993|volume=61|pages=587–610|journal=Journal of Personality|doi=10.1111/j.1467-6494.1993.tb00783.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, caregivers higher on empathic accuracy tend to provide more instrumental support and less negative support (e.g., accusing or criticizing) to their spouse.&lt;ref name=Verhofstadt2008&gt;{{cite journal|last= Verhofstadt |first=L. L.|author2=Buysse, A.|author3=Ickes, W.|author4=Davis, M.|author5=Devoldre, I. |title= Support Provision in Marriage: The Role of Emotional Similarity and Empathic Accuracy|year=2008|volume=8|pages=792–802|journal=Emotion|doi=10.1037/a0013976}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Attachment style====

Attachment theory postulates that the quality of caregiving an individual receives shapes many of the skills and motivations necessary for that individual to enact caregiving him- or herself.&lt;ref name=MikulincerShaver2007/&gt; Indeed, research shows that personal attachment style (i.e., level of attachment security versus attachment avoidance or anxiety) is tightly linked to beliefs about, and strategies in, providing care to dependent others.&lt;ref name=MikulincerShaver2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=KunceShaver1994/&gt; Attachment avoidance, which is characterized by discomfort with intimacy, is related to less support giving and with keeping distance from a partner in need, particularly when the partner is experiencing higher levels of distress.&lt;ref name=KunceShaver1994/&gt;&lt;ref name=FeeneyCollins2001/&gt;&lt;ref name=Feeney1996&gt;{{cite journal|last=Feeney|first=J. A.|title=Attachment, caregiving, and marital satisfaction|journal=Personal Relationships|year=1996|volume=3|pages=401–416|doi=10.1111/j.1475-6811.1996.tb00124.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; When avoidant individuals do provide support, they tend to be more controlling.&lt;ref name=FeeneyCollins2001/&gt; Attachment anxiety is related to controlling, overinvolved, intrusive, and compulsive caregiving (e.g., preoccupation with the fear that the partner will leave them if they do not provide adequate care).&lt;ref name=KunceShaver1994/&gt;&lt;ref name="Feeney1996"/&gt; For example, anxiously attached individuals provide higher levels of support to partners who are about to engage in a stressful laboratory task, and this support is not matched to the level of need expressed by their partner.&lt;ref name=FeeneyCollins2001/&gt; Anxiously attached individuals also display more negative support behaviours, such as blaming.&lt;ref name=CollinsFeeney2000/&gt; Secure attachment is associated with more effective forms of caregiving (i.e., care that is responsive and not overinvolved).&lt;ref name=FeeneyCollins2001/&gt;

===Care recipient characteristics===

Because careseeking and caregiving are highly interdependent, complimentary processes, individuals are more likely to receive caregiving efforts from their partner when they experience and express higher levels of distress or need.&lt;ref name=CollinsFeeney2000/&gt;&lt;ref name=FeeneyCollins2001/&gt;&lt;ref name=Iida2008/&gt; More generally, psychology research on helping suggests that one of the strongest determinants of helping behaviour is the structure of the situation – more specifically, the degree to which potential helpers are able to notice that the need for help exists.&lt;ref name=Darley1970&gt;{{cite book|last=Darley|first=J. M.|author2=Latane, B.|title=The unresponsive bystander: why doesn't he help?|year=1970|publisher=Appleton Century Crofts|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the context of romantic relationships, researchers have similarly argued that in order to enact caregiving, individuals must first realize that their partner requires care.&lt;ref name=Pearlin1990&gt;{{cite book|last=Pearlin|first=L. I.|author2=McCall, M. E.|title=Stress between work and family|year=1990|publisher=Plenum Press|location=New York|pages=39–60|editor=Eckenrode, J. |editor2=Gore, S.|chapter=Occupational stress and marital support: A description of microprocesses}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, one potential obstacle to caregiving behaviour is that the person in need of help may not actively seek support from the caregiver,&lt;ref name=Pierce1997&gt;{{cite book|last=Pierce|first=G. R.|author2=Lakey, B.|author3=Sarason, I. G.|author4=Sarason, B. R.|author5=Joseph, H.|title=Sourcebook of social support and personality

R.|chapter= Personality and social support processes: A conceptual over-view}}&lt;/ref&gt; or may communicate their need for support through indirect strategies (e.g., hinting, sulking, sighing) that are overly ambiguous.&lt;ref name=CollinsFeeney2000/&gt;&lt;ref name=Barbee1998&gt;{{cite book|last=Barbee|first=A.

A. |editor2=Gierrero, L. K. |chapter= When a friend is in need: Feelings about seeking, giving, and receiving social support}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, while greater communications of need can effectively elicit support,&lt;ref name=CollinsFeeney2000/&gt; behaviours such as excessive reassurance seeking (a behavioural pattern in which individuals continue to seek support and reassurance even after such reassurance has already been provided) can strain the relationship and undermine helping.&lt;ref name=Joiner1999&gt;{{cite journal|last=Joiner|first=T. E.|author2=Metalsky, G. I.|author3=Katz, J.|author4=Beach, S. R. H.|title=Depression and excessive reassurance seeking|journal=Psychological Inquiry|year=1999|volume=10|pages=269–278|doi=10.1207/s15327965pli1004_1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Qualities of the relationship===

Researchers have argued that individuals in high quality relationships, in which partners feel attached and committed to each other, should evidence more motivation to provide responsive support to their partner.&lt;ref name=Cutrona1996/&gt; Indeed, one’s own sense of relationship satisfaction&lt;ref name=Acitelli1996&gt;{{cite book|last=Acitelli|first=L. K.|title=Handbook of social support and the family|year=1996|publisher=Plenum Press|location=New York|pages=83–103|editor=Pierce, G. R. |editor2=Sarason, B. R. |editor3=Sarason, I. G. |chapter=The neglected links between marital support and marital satisfaction}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and relationship interdependence&lt;ref name=FeeneyCollins2001/&gt; (the degree to which the caregiver feels close and committed to the partner) are positively related to the amount of support one provides. For example, daily diary studies of caregiving have observed that individuals tend to provide more support to their partners on days they feel more satisfied with their relationships (however, a reverse interpretation – that caregiving increases relationship satisfaction – is also possible).&lt;ref name=Iida2008/&gt; In addition, caregivers who are more satisfied with their relationships report more altruistic motives for providing support.&lt;ref name=FeeneyCollins2003/&gt;

==Benefits of caregiving==

Receipt of social support, or the perception that social support will be readily available when needed, is linked to a multitude of benefits, including improvements in mood and self-esteem.&lt;ref name=CollinsFeeney2000/&gt;&lt;ref name=Brunstein1996&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brunstein|first=J. C.|author2=Dangelmayer, G.|author3=Schultheiss, O. C.|title=Personal Goals and Social Support in Close Relationships: Effects on Relationship Mood and Marital Satisfaction|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1996|volume=71|pages=1006–1019|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.71.5.1006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Provision of effective care can also benefit the caregiver because it is likely to foster feelings of self-worth and efficacy, build confidence in one's interpersonal skills, promote the self-view that one is a moral person, and increase feelings of love and social connectedness.&lt;ref name=MikulincerShaver2007/&gt;  Research has also linked the provision of social support within intimate relationships to enhanced relationship satisfaction for the care recipient and caregiver.&lt;ref name=CollinsFeeney2000/&gt;&lt;ref name=Brunstein1996/&gt;&lt;ref name=Kane2007&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kane|first=H.

The green subgroup together with the blue one forms a clade again.]]

A '''clade''' (from {{lang-grc|{{lang|grc|κλάδος}}}}, ''klados'', "branch"), also known as monophyletic group, is a group of [[organism]]s that consists of a [[Common descent|common ancestor]] and all its [[lineal descendant]]s, and represents a single "branch" on the "[[Tree of life (science)|tree of life]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Assembling the Tree of Life |editor-first=Joel |editor-last=Cracraft |editor2-first=Michael J. |editor2-last=Donoghue |chapter=Introduction |page=1 |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-19-972960-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The common ancestor may be an individual, a [[population]], a [[species]] ([[extinct]] or [[Extant taxon|extant]]), and so on right up to a [[kingdom (biology)|kingdom]] and further. Clades are nested, one in another, as each branch in turn splits into smaller branches. These splits reflect [[evolutionary history]] as populations diverged and evolved independently. Clades are termed [[Monophyly|monophyletic]] (Greek: "one clan") groups.

Over the last few decades, the cladistic approach has revolutionized biological classification and revealed surprising evolutionary relationships among organisms.&lt;ref name="Palmer, Douglas 2009. p. 13"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Evolution: The Story of Life |last=Palmer |first=Douglas |publisher=University of California Press |year=2009 |location=Berkeley |pages=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increasingly, [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomists]] try to avoid naming [[Taxon|taxa]] that are not clades; that is, taxa that are not [[Monophyly|monophyletic]]. Some of the relationships between organisms that the molecular biology arm of cladistics has revealed are that [[fungi]] are closer relatives to animals than they are to plants, [[archaea]] are now considered different from [[bacteria]], and multicellular organisms may have evolved from archaea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Pace |first=Norman R. |date=2006-05-18 |title=Time for a change |journal=Nature |volume=441 |issue=7091 |pages=289 |bibcode=2006Natur.441..289P |doi=10.1038/441289a |issn=1476-4687 |pmid=16710401}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The term "clade" was coined in 1957 by the biologist [[Julian Huxley]] to refer to the result of [[cladogenesis]], a concept Huxley borrowed from [[Bernhard Rensch]].&lt;ref name=Dupuis&gt;{{cite journal | last=Dupuis | first=Claude | year=1984 | title=Willi Hennig's impact on taxonomic thought | journal=Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics | volume=15 | pages=1–24 | doi=10.1146/annurev.es.15.110184.000245}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Huxley&gt;{{cite journal | last = Huxley | first = J. S. | year =1957 | title = The three types of evolutionary process | journal=Nature | volume=180 | issue = 4584 | pages=454–455 | doi=10.1038/180454a0| bibcode=1957Natur.180..454H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many commonly named groups, [[rodent]]s and [[insect]]s for example, are clades because, in each case, the group consists of a common ancestor with all its descendant branches. Rodents, for example, are a branch of [[mammal]]s that split off after the end of the period when the clade [[Dinosaur]]ia stopped being the dominant terrestrial [[vertebrate]]s 66 million years ago. The original population and all its descendants are a clade. The rodent clade corresponds to the order Rodentia, and insects to the class Insecta. These clades include smaller clades, such as [[chipmunk]] or [[ant]], each of which consists of even smaller clades. The clade "rodent" is in turn included in the mammal, [[vertebrate]] and animal clades.

== History of nomenclature and taxonomy ==
[[File:Haeckel arbol bn.png|thumb|right|Early phylogenetic tree by [[Ernst Haeckel|Haeckel]], 1866. Groups once thought to be more advanced, such as birds ("Aves"), are placed at the top.]]

The idea of a clade did not exist in pre-[[Charles Darwin|Darwinian]] [[Linnaean taxonomy]], which was based by necessity only on internal or external [[morphology (biology)|morphological]] similarities between organisms – although as it happens, many of the better known animal groups in Linnaeus' original [[Systema Naturae]] (notably among the [[vertebrate]] groups) do represent clades. The phenomenon of [[convergent evolution]] is, however, responsible for many cases where there are misleading similarities in the morphology of groups that evolved from different lineages.

With the increasing realization in the first half of the 19th century that species had changed and split through the ages, classification increasingly came to be seen as branches on the evolutionary [[tree of life (biology)|tree of life]]. The publication of Darwin's [[Evolution|theory of evolution]] in 1859 gave this view increasing weight. [[Thomas Henry Huxley]], an early advocate of evolutionary theory, proposed a revised taxonomy based on clades.&lt;ref name="original text w/ figures"&gt;Huxley, T.H. (1876): Lectures on Evolution. ''New York Tribune''. Extra. no 36. In Collected Essays IV: pp 46-138 [http://aleph0.clarku.edu/huxley/CE4/LecEvol.html original text w/ figures]&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, he grouped birds with reptiles, based on fossil evidence.&lt;ref name="original text w/ figures"/&gt;

German biologist [[Emil Hans Willi Hennig]] (1913 – 1976) is considered to be the founder of [[cladistics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Brower, Andrew V. Z.|year=2013|title=Willi Hennig at 100|journal=Cladistics|volume=30|issue=2|pages=224–225|doi=10.1111/cla.12057}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He proposed a classification system that represented repeated branchings of the family tree, as opposed to the previous systems, which put organisms on a "ladder", with supposedly more "advanced" organisms at the top.&lt;ref name="Palmer, Douglas 2009. p. 13" /&gt;&lt;ref name="page 10"&gt;”Evolution 101.” [http://evolution.berkeley.edu/evolibrary/article/evo_10 page 10]. Understanding Evolution website. University of California, Berkeley. Retrieved 26 February 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

Taxonomists have increasingly worked to make the taxonomic system reflect evolution.&lt;ref name="page 10"/&gt; When it comes to [[Nomenclature#Biology|naming]], however, this principle is not always compatible with the traditional [[Linnaean taxonomy|rank-based nomenclature]]. In the latter, only taxa associated with a [[Taxonomic rank|rank]] can be named, yet there are not enough ranks to name a long series of nested clades. For these and other reasons, [[phylogenetic nomenclature]] has been developed; it is still controversial.

==Definitions==
[[File:Cladogram Crocodilia NL.PNG|thumb|right|Gavialidae, Crocodylidae and Alligatoridae are clade names that are here applied to a [[Phylogenetics|phylogenetic]] tree of crocodylians.]]

A clade is by definition [[monophyletic]], meaning that it contains one ancestor (which can be an organism, a population, or a species) and all its descendants.&lt;ref group=note&gt;
A semantic case has been made that the name should be "holophyletic", but this term has not acquired widespread use. For more information, see ''[[holophyly]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Code of Phylogenetic Nomenclature. Version 4c. Chapter I. Taxa. |url=http://www.ohio.edu/phylocode/art1-3.html|year=2010|accessdate=22 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Clades and phylogenetic trees==
{{main article|Phylogenetics}}
{{main article|Cladistics}}

The science that tries to reconstruct phylogenetic trees and thus discover clades is called [[phylogenetics]] or [[cladistics]], the latter term coined by [[Ernst Mayr]] (1965), derived from "clade". The results of phylogenetic/cladistic analyses are tree-shaped diagrams called ''[[cladogram]]s''; they, and all their branches, are phylogenetic hypotheses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nixon|first=Kevin C.|author2=Carpenter, James M.|title=On the Other "Phylogenetic Systematics"|journal=Cladistics|date=1 September 2000|volume=16|issue=3|pages=298–318|doi=10.1111/j.1096-0031.2000.tb00285.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three methods of defining clades are featured in [[phylogenetic nomenclature]]: node-, stem-, and apomorphy-based (see [[Phylogenetic nomenclature#Phylogenetic definitions of clade names|here]] for detailed definitions).

==Terminology==
[[File:Primate cladogram.svg|thumb|300px|Cladogram of modern primate groups; all tarsiers are haplorhines, but not all haplorhines are tarsiers; all apes are catarrhines, but not all catarrhines are apes; etc.]]
The relationship between clades can be described in several ways:

* A clade located within a clade is said to be ''nested'' within that clade. In the diagram, the [[Ape|hominoid]] clade, i.e. the apes and humans, is nested within the primate clade.
* Two clades are ''[[Sister group|sisters]]'' if they have an immediate common ancestor. In the diagram, lemurs and lorises are sister clades, while humans and tarsiers are not.
* A clade ''A'' is ''[[Basal (phylogenetics)|basal]]'' to a clade ''B'' if ''A'' branches off the lineage leading to ''B'' before the first branch leading only to members of ''B''. In the adjacent diagram, the [[Strepsirrhini|strepsirrhine]] clade, including the lemurs and lorises, is basal to the [[Hominoidea|hominoids]], the apes and humans. Some authors have used "basal" differently, using it to mean a clade that is "more primitive" or less species-rich than its sister clade; others consider this usage to be incorrect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Krell |first=F.-T. |last2=Cranston |first2=P. |year=2004 |title=Which side of the tree is more basal? |journal=Systematic Entomology |volume=29 |issue=3 |pages=279–281 |doi=10.1111/j.0307-6970.2004.00262.x |lastauthoramp=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
''Clade'' is the title of a novel by [[James Bradley (Australian writer)|James Bradley]], who chose it both because of its biological meaning and also because of the larger implications of the word.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://medium.com/@PenguinBooksAus/choosing-the-book-title-clade-f4d16baa6e87 |title=Choosing the Book title 'Clade'|publisher=Penguin Group Australia|year=2015| accessdate =20 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An episode of ''[[Elementary (TV series)|Elementary]]'' was titled "[[List of Elementary episodes#ep38|Dead Clade Walking]]" and dealt with a case involving a rare fossil.

'''Claude Adrien Helvétius''' ({{IPAc-en|h|ɛ|l|ˈ|v|iː|ʃ|ə|s}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/c+helvetius "Helvétius"]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-fr|klod adʁijɛ̃ ɛlvesjys|lang}}; 26 January 1715 – 26 December 1771) was a [[France|French]] [[philosopher]], [[freemason]]&lt;ref&gt;Ian Cumming, [https://books.google.com/books?id=HQ9S-xWkIBcC&amp;dq= ''Helvetius: His Life and Place in the History of Educational Thought''], Routledge, 2013, pp. 115–132.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[littérateur]]''.

==Life==
Claude Adrien Helvétius was born in [[Paris, France]], and was descended from a family of physicians, originally surnamed ''Schweitzer'' (meaning "[[Switzerland|Swiss]]" in German; Latinized as ''[[Helvetia|Helvétius]]''). His grandfather [[Adriaan Helvetius]] introduced the use of [[Carapichea ipecacuanha|ipecacuanha]];&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=FZk5AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA509 Helvetius, Adriaan] in Biographisch woordenboek der Nederlanden, vol 8, (1867), p. 509.&lt;/ref&gt; his father [[Jean Claude Adrien Helvétius]] was first physician to [[Marie Leszczynska|Marie Leszczyńska]], queen of France. Claude Adrien was trained for a financial career, apprenticed to his maternal uncle in Caen,&lt;ref name="autogenerated1965"&gt;''Helvetius: A Study in Persecution'' by David Warner Smith, Clarendon Press Oxford, 1965.&lt;/ref&gt; but he occupied his spare time with poetry. Aged twenty-three, at the queen's request, he was appointed as a farmer-general, a tax-collecting post worth 100,000 crowns a year. Thus provided for, he proceeded to enjoy life to the utmost, with the help of his wealth and liberality, his literary and artistic tastes - he attended, for example, the progressive [[Club de l'Entresol]]. As he grew older, he began to seek more lasting distinctions, stimulated by the success of [[Pierre Louis Maupertuis]] as a [[mathematician]], of [[Voltaire]] as a [[poet]], and of [[Charles de Secondat, Baron de Montesquieu|Montesquieu]] as a philosopher. His wife, [[Anne-Catherine de Ligniville, Madame Helvétius]], maintained a salon attended by the leading figures of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] for over five decades.

In 1758 Helvétius published his philosophical magnum opus, a work called ''De l'esprit'' (On Mind), which claimed that all human faculties are attributes of mere physical sensation, and that the only real motive is self-interest, therefore there is no good and evil, only competitive pleasures.  Its [[atheistic]], [[utilitarian]] and [[egalitarian]] doctrines raised a public outcry, and the [[Sorbonne]] publicly burned it in 1759, forcing Helvétius to issue several retractions.
[[File:Le Château de Voré.png|thumb|350px|''Château de Voré'' (Collines des Perches, [[Loir-et-Cher]])]]
In 1764 Helvétius visited England, and the next year, at the invitation of [[Frederick II of Prussia|Frederick II]], went to [[Berlin]], where the king paid him much attention. 

After 10 years, when he thought his fortune sufficient, he gave up the post of farmer-general, and retired to a country estate in France, where he employed his fortune in the relief of the poor, the encouragement of agriculture and the development of industries. For this he won the admiration of many of the philosophers.
[[File:Friedrich Zweite Alt.jpg|thumb|Helvétius was one of several French ''[[philosophes]]'' who spent time at the court of [[Frederick the Great]] of Prussia (depicted above)]]
Helvetius´ family lived alternately on ''Château de Voré'' (Collines des Perches, [[Loir-et-Cher]]) and their Parisian townhouse at the ''rue Sainte-Anne''.

==Philosophy==

===''De l'esprit'' and its reception===
Helvétius' philosophical studies ended in the production of his famous book ''De l'esprit'' (On Mind). It was first published in 1758 and was intended to be the rival of [[Montesquieu]]'s ''[[Spirit of the Laws]]'', with Helvétius arguing strongly against Montesquieu's theory that climate influenced the character of nations.

The work attracted immediate attention and aroused the most formidable opposition, especially from the dauphin [[Louis, Dauphin of France (1729–1765)|Louis]], son of King [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]]. The Advocate General [[Joseph Omer Joly de Fleury|Joly de Fleury]] condemned it in the [[Parlement#The Parlement of Paris|Parlement of Paris]] in January 1759. The [[Collège de Sorbonne|Sorbonne]] condemned the book, while the priests persuaded the court that it was full of the most dangerous doctrines.  The book was declared to be heretical{{spaced ndash}}so atheistic that it was condemned by Church and State and was burned. Helvétius, terrified at the storm he had raised, wrote three separate and humiliating retractions. In spite of his protestations of orthodoxy, the book was publicly burned by the Paris hangman.

It had far-reaching negative effects on the rest of the ''philosophes'', in particular, [[Denis Diderot]], and the great work he was doing on the ''Encyclopedie''. The religious authorities, particularly the [[Jesuits]] and the new pope began to fear the spread of atheism and wanted to clamp down on the 'modern thought' hard and quickly. ''De l'esprit'' became almost a scapegoat for this.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1965"/&gt;
[[File:DeLespritFrontPage.png|thumb|Cover page of a 1759 English translation of ''De l'Esprit'']]

This great publicity resulted in the book being translated into almost all the languages of Europe. Voltaire said that it lacked originality. [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]] declared that the very benevolence of the author gave the lie to his principles. [[Friedrich Melchior, baron von Grimm|Grimm]] thought that all the ideas in the book were borrowed from [[Denis Diderot|Diderot]]. [[Marie Anne de Vichy-Chamrond, marquise du Deffand|Madame du Deffand]] felt that Helvétius had raised such a storm by saying openly what every one thought in secret. [[Françoise d'Issembourg d'Happoncourt, Madame de Graffigny|Madame de Graffigny]] claimed that all the good things in the book had been picked up in her own salon.

===Psychological egoism===
{{Further|Psychological egoism}}

Helvétius' philosophy belongs to the Egoist school:

#All man's faculties may be reduced to physical [[sensualism|sensation]], even memory, comparison, judgment.  Our only difference from the lower animals lies in our external organization.
#Self-interest, founded on the love of pleasure and the fear of pain, is the sole spring of judgment, action, and affection.  Human beings are motivated solely by the pursuit of pleasure and the avoidance of pain.  "These two," he says, "are, and always will be, the only principles of action in man."&lt;ref&gt;Helvétius, Claude Adrien, ''Treatise on Man: His Intellectual Faculties and his Education'', transl. W. Hooper, M. D., (London: Albion Press, 1810), p. 146&lt;/ref&gt; Self-sacrifice is prompted by the fact that the sensation of pleasure outweighs the accompanying pain and is thus the result of deliberate calculation.
#We have [[determinism|no freedom of choice]] between good and evil.  There is no such thing as absolute right{{spaced ndash}}ideas of justice and injustice change according to customs.

This view of man was largely [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbesian]]{{spaced ndash}}man is a system deterministically controllable by a suitable combination of reward and punishment, and the ends of government are to ensure the maximization of pleasure.

===Natural equality of intelligences===
{{Further|Tabula rasa}}

"All men," Helvétius maintained, "have an equal disposition for understanding."&lt;ref&gt;Helvétius, Claude Adrien, ''De l'esprit or, Essays on the Mind, and Its Several Faculties'', (London: 1759), p. 286&lt;/ref&gt; As one of the French Enlightenment's many [[John Locke|Lockean]] disciples, he regarded the human mind as a blank slate, but free not only from innate ideas but also from innate natural dispositions and propensities. Physiological constitution was at most a peripheral factor in men's characters or capabilities. Any apparent inequalities were independent of natural organization, and had their cause in the unequal desire for instruction. This desire springs from passions, of which all men commonly well organized are susceptible to the same degree. We thus owe everything to education. [[Social engineering (political science)|Social engineering]] is therefore an enterprise unconstrained by the natural abilities of men.

This natural equality applied to all men in all nations, and thus the differences in national characteristics were not the result of innate differences between the people therein, but rather a byproduct of the system education and government. "No nation," wrote Helvétius, "has reason to regard itself superior to others by virtue of its innate endowment."&lt;ref&gt;Helvétius, ''De l'esprit'', p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

This radically egalitarian aspect of Helvétius' philosophy caused [[Diderot]] to remark that if it were true, ''De l'esprit'' might just as well have been written by Helvétius' dogkeeper.

===Omnipotence of education===
{{Further|Nature versus nurture}}

Since all men have the same natural potential, Helvétius argued, they all have the same ability to learn.  Thus, education is the method by which to reform society, and there are few limits to the drastic social improvements that could be brought about by the appropriate distribution of education.  Although people seem to possess certain qualities in greater abundance than their neighbours, the explanation for this comes 'from above' – it is caused by education, law and government. "If we commonly meet in London, with knowing men, who are with much more difficulty found in France," this is because it is a country where "every citizen has a share in the management of affairs in general."&lt;ref&gt;Helvétius, ''De l'esprit'', p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; "The art of forming men," he concludes, "is in all countries [...] strictly connected to the form of the government", and thus education via governmental intervention is the method of reform.&lt;ref&gt;Helvétius, ''De l'esprit'', p. 325&lt;/ref&gt;

The crux of his thought was that public [[ethics]] has a utilitarian basis, and he insisted strongly on the importance of culture and education in national development. His thinking can be described as unsystematic.

===Influence===
The original ideas in his system are those of the ''natural equality of intelligences'' and the ''omnipotence of education'', neither of which gained general acceptance, though both were prominent in the system of [[John Stuart Mill]].  [[Cesare, marchese de Beccaria-Bonesana|Cesare Beccaria]] states that he was largely inspired by Helvétius in his attempt to modify penal laws.  Helvétius also exerted some influence on the utilitarian [[Jeremy Bentham]].

The materialistic aspects of Helvétius, along with [[Baron d'Holbach]], had an influence on [[Karl Marx]], the theorist of [[historical materialism]] and [[communism]], who studied the ideas of Helvétius in [[Paris]] and later called the materialism of Helvétius and d'Holbach "the social basis of communism".&lt;ref&gt;Mehring, Franz, ''Karl Marx: The Story of His Life'' (Routledge, 2003) pg. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism===
German philosopher [[Johann Georg Hamann]] vigorously opposed Helvétius's rationalistic doctrines.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Alan Sparling, ''Johann Georg Hamann and the Enlightenment Project'', University of Toronto Press, 2011, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt;

British philosopher [[Isaiah Berlin]] listed Helvétius, along with [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte|Fichte]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau|Rousseau]], [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, comte de Saint-Simon|Saint-Simon]] and [[Joseph de Maistre|Maistre]] as one of the six "enemies of freedom" who constituted the ideological basis for modern [[authoritarianism]], in his book ''Freedom and Betrayal: Six Enemies of Human Liberty''.&lt;ref&gt;Berlin, Isaiah, ''Freedom and Betrayal: Six Enemies of Human Liberty'' (Princeton University Press, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Poetry==
His poetic ambitions resulted in the poem called ''Le Bonheur'' (published posthumously, with an account of Helvétius's life and works, by [[Jean François de Saint-Lambert]], 1773), in which he develops the idea that true happiness is only to be found in making the interest of one person that of all.

==Bibliography==
A work called ''De l'homme, de ses facultés intellectuelles et de son éducation'', found among his manuscripts, was published after his death. There is a complete edition of the works of Helvétius, published at Paris, 1818.

'''Cleaning symbiosis''' is a [[mutualism (biology)|mutually beneficial]] association between individuals of two species, where one (the cleaner) removes and eats parasites and other materials from the surface of the other (the client). Cleaning symbiosis is well-known among marine fish, where some small species of [[cleaner fish]], notably [[wrasse]]s but also species in other genera, are specialised to feed almost exclusively by cleaning larger fish and other marine animals. Other cleaning symbioses exist between birds and mammals, and in other groups.

Cleaning behaviour was first described by the Greek historian [[Herodotus]] in about 420 BC, though his example (birds serving crocodiles) appears to occur only rarely.

The role of cleaning symbioses has been debated by biologists for over thirty years. Some believe that cleaning represents selfless co-operation, essentially pure [[mutualism (biology)|mutualism]], increasing the [[Fitness (biology)|fitness]] of both individuals. Others such as [[Robert Trivers]] hold that it illustrates mutual selfishness, [[reciprocal altruism]]. Others again believe that cleaning behaviour is simply one-sided exploitation, a form of [[parasitism]].

Cheating, where either a cleaner sometimes harms its client, or a predatory species [[Mimicry|mimics]] a cleaner, also occurs. Predatory cheating is analogous to [[Batesian mimicry]], as where a harmless hoverfly mimics a stinging wasp, though with the tables turned. Some genuine cleaner fish, such as gobies and wrasse, have the same [[animal coloration|colours and patterns]], in an example of [[convergent evolution]]. Mutual resemblance among cleaner fish is analogous to [[Müllerian mimicry]], as where stinging bees and wasps mimic each other.

==History==
[[File:PloverCrocodileSymbiosis.jpg|thumb|[[Herodotus]] asserted that the ''trochilus'' bird, possibly a [[sandpiper]], was able to enter the mouth of the [[Nile crocodile]] in what would now be called a cleaning symbiosis. Drawing by [[Henry Scherren]], 1906]]

In his ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|Histories]]'' (book II), the ancient Greek historian [[Herodotus]] wrote:&lt;ref name=Herodotus&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ancientsites.com/aw/Article/782224 | title=The Histories of Herodotus | publisher=Ancient Worlds | work=Book II: Euterpe | origyear=420 BC | accessdate=February 12, 2012 | author=Herodotus | pages=2:68}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ebooksread.com/authors-eng/the-elder-pliny/plinys-natural-history-in-thirty-seven-books-hci/page-44-plinys-natural-history-in-thirty-seven-books-hci.shtml | work=[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural History]] | title=Book VI, II, Chapter XXV: Of the Crocodile, Scink, and Hippopotamus | origyear=77–79 AD | accessdate=February 13, 2012 | author=[[Pliny the Elder]] (quoting Herodotus' ''Euterpe'', 68)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|As [the [[crocodile]]] lives chiefly in the river, it has the inside of its mouth constantly covered with [[leech]]es; hence it happens that, while all the other birds and beasts avoid it, with the trochilus it lives at peace, since it owes much to that bird: for the crocodile, when he leaves the water and comes out upon the land, is in the habit of lying with his mouth wide open, facing the western breeze: at such times the trochilus goes into his mouth and devours the leeches. This benefits the crocodile, who is pleased, and takes care not to hurt the trochilus.&lt;ref name=Herodotus/&gt;}}

Herodotus thus claimed (circa 440 BC) that Nile crocodiles had what would now be called a cleaning symbiosis with the bird he called the ''trochilus'', possibly a [[sandpiper]]; but while he was right about the existence of cleaning symbioses, there is little evidence for it in crocodiles. In 1906 [[Henry Scherren]] quoted John Mason Cook, son of travel agent [[Thomas Cook]], as reporting from Egypt that he had seen some [[spur-winged plover]]s approach a crocodile, which opened its jaws for them:&lt;ref name=Scherren&gt;{{cite book | title=Popular Natural History | publisher=Cassell | author=Scherren, Henry | authorlink=Henry Scherren | year=1906 | page=268  |quote=Mr. J. M. Cook, of the celebrated tourist agency, when in Egypt in 1876, "watched one of these birds, and saw it deliberately go up to a crocodile, apparently asleep, which opened its jaws. The bird hopped in, and the crocodile closed its jaws. in what appeared to be a very short time, probably not more than a minute or two, the crocodile opened its jaws, and we saw the bird go down to the water's edge." There were several of these birds about, and Mr. Cook shot two of them, which Dr. Sclater identified as spur-winged plovers; so that the question as to what bird enters the mouth of the crocodile is now set at rest.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

MacFarland and Reeder, reviewing the evidence, found that&lt;ref name=MacFarlandReeder&gt;{{cite journal | title=Cleaning symbiosis involving Galapagos tortoises and two species of Darwin's finches |author1=Macfarland, Craig G. |author2=Reeder, W.

{{quote|Extensive observations of [[Nile crocodile]]s in regular or occasional association with various species of potential cleaners (e.g. plovers, sandpipers, [[water dikkop]]) ... have resulted in only a few reports of sandpipers removing leeches from the mouth and gular scutes and snapping at insects along the reptile's body.&lt;ref name=MacFarlandReeder/&gt;}}

==A disputed relationship==

Cleaning symbiosis  is a relationship between a pair of animals of different species, involving the removal and subsequent ingestion of ectoparasites, diseased and injured tissue, and unwanted food items from the surface of the host organism (the client) by the cleaning organism (the cleaner).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Losey, G.S. | title=The Ecological Importance of Cleaning Symbiosis | journal=Copeia | year=1972 | pages=820–833 | doi = 10.2307/1442741 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its status has been debated by biologists, with viewpoints ranging from pure [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualism]] through to a form of exploitative [[parasitism]] by the cleaner.&lt;ref name=PoulinGrutter&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Poulin, Robert |authorlink=Robert Poulin (zoologist) |author2=Grutter, A.S. |year=1996 |title=Cleaning symbiosis: proximate and adaptive explanations |journal=BioScience |volume=46 |issue=7 |pages=512–517 |url=http://www.lexagrutter.com/Publications/paper%207.pdf  |doi=10.2307/1312929}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marine biology|Marine biologist]] Alexandra Grutter explains:&lt;ref name=Grutter24/&gt;
{{quote|Cleaning associations involve cleaner organisms that remove ectoparasites and other material, such as mucus, scales and skin, from the body surfaces of other apparently co-operating animals. The latter are often referred to as hosts, customers, or clients. Cleaning behaviour is one of the most highly developed inter-specific communication systems known, with clients striking elaborate postures which have generally been assumed to make ectoparasites more accessible to cleaners.&lt;ref name=Grutter24/&gt;}}

===Selfless co-operation===

Grutter and her colleague [[Robert Poulin (zoologist)|Robert Poulin]], reviewing over thirty years of debate by biologists on cleaning symbioses, argue that "Cleaning symbioses may not be mutualistic associations but rather one-sided exploitation".&lt;ref name=PoulinGrutter/&gt; They quote as an example of an early position, C. Limbaugh writing in 1961: "From the standpoint of the philosopher of biology, the extent of cleaning behavior in the ocean emphasizes the role of co-operation in nature as opposed to the tooth-and-claw struggle for existence".&lt;ref name=PoulinGrutter/&gt;

===Mutual selfishness===
{{further|Reciprocal altruism}}

In 1971, mathematical biologist [[Robert Trivers]] wrote more carefully "Cleaner organisms and their hosts meet the preconditions for the evolution of [[Reciprocal altruism|reciprocally altruistic]] behavior. The host's altruism is to be explained as benefiting him because of the advantage of being able quickly and repeatedly to return to the same cleaner" (i.e. mutual selfishness).&lt;ref name=PoulinGrutter/&gt;

===One-sided exploitation===

By 1987 G. S. Losey wrote less optimistically "Cleaners are nothing but very clever behavioral parasites ... that have taken advantage of the rewarding aspects of tactile stimulation, found in nearly all vertebrates."&lt;ref name=PoulinGrutter/&gt; Poulin and Grutter remark that "Over the last few decades, ... the opinion of scientists regarding cleaning symbioses has changed, from selfless cooperation, to a mutually beneficial interaction, and finally to a one-sided exploitation."&lt;ref name=PoulinGrutter/&gt;

==Biological range==

Cleaning symbiosis is known from several groups of animals both in the sea and on land (see table). Cleaners include fish, shrimps and birds; clients include a much wider range of fish, marine reptiles including turtles and iguanas, octopus, whales, and terrestrial mammals.&lt;ref name="Grutter24"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Cleaning symbioses from the parasites' perspective | author=Grutter, Alexandra S. | journal=Parasitology | year=2002 | volume=124 | pages=S65–S81 | doi=10.1017/S0031182002001488 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cleaning symbioses with reptile clients include fish cleaning the teeth of [[American crocodile]]s (''Crocodylus acutus''), geckos eating mosquitoes on [[Aldabra giant tortoise]]s (''Geochelone gigantea'') and scarlet crabs (''[[Grapsus grapsus]]''), and three species of [[Galapagos finch]]es removing ticks from [[marine iguana]]s (''Amblyrhynchus cristatus'').&lt;ref name="MacFarlandReeder"/&gt;

The best known cleaning symbioses are among marine fishes, where several species of small fish, notably of wrasse, are specialised in colour, pattern and behaviour as cleaners, providing a cleaning and [[ectoparasite]] removal service to larger, often predatory fish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |author=Curry, O. |url=http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/441/1/curryphd.pdf |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]] |title=Morality as natural history |publisher=[[University of London]] |degree=[[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cleaner species, as shown in the table, vary widely in their degree of dependence on their clients. Some are essentially pure [[obligate symbiont]]s like the cleaner wrasse; some are opportunistic or facultative symbionts, like the orange chromide or some cleaner shrimps; and some, like the oxpeckers, combine a little eating of parasites (beneficial to client) with taking of blood (harmful to client), their favoured food.&lt;ref name=Weeks&gt;{{cite journal |author=Weeks, Paul |year=2000 |title=Red-billed oxpeckers: vampires or tickbirds? |journal=Behavioral Ecology |volume=11 |issue=2 |pages=154–160 |doi=10.1093/beheco/11.2.154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mimicry among cleaner fish==

===Mutual mimicry among cleaner fish===
Many [[cleaner fish]] in different families, such as the Caribbean neon goby (''[[Elacatinus evelynae]]'') and the [[Indo-Pacific]] cleaner wrasse (''[[Labroides dimidiatus]]'') share the distinctive combination of a long narrow body, a longitudinal stripe, a blue colour, and small size.

The [[sabre-toothed blenny]] (''Aspidontus taeniatus'') is a predatory [[blenny]], an [[aggressive mimicry|aggressive mimic]] which accurately resembles the bluestreak cleaner wrasse, not only in colour and pattern, but also in the ritualised dance the cleaner wrasse makes when potential client fish swim nearby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cordis.europa.eu/express/20060630/finally_en.html|title=Comparative shopping, a fishy invention?|publisher=CORDIS Express|accessdate=2009-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, instead of providing the cleaning service that it signals, it bites off pieces of healthy skin, [[lepidophage|scales and mucus]] from the host and then swims rapidly away to safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{FishBase species|genus=Aspidontus|species=taeniatus|year=2007|month=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effect of aggressive [[mimicry]] in a cleaning symbiosis is analogous to [[Batesian mimicry]], where a harmless "edible mimetic species copies the warning signal of a noxious, aposematic model species, thereby gaining protection from predators".&lt;ref name="CheneyCote"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Frequency-dependent success of aggressive mimics in a cleaning symbiosis |author1=Cheney, Karen L. |author2=Côté, Isabelle M. | journal=[[Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences]] | year=2005 | volume=272 | pages=2635–2639 | doi=10.1098/rspb.2005.3256 | pmc=1559983 | pmid=16321786 |url=http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/272/1581/2635.short |jstor=30047878}} [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1559983/pdf/rspb20053256.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; As in Batesian mimicry, the rate of successful attacks on cleaning clients by the bluestriped fangblenny (''[[Plagiotremus rhinorhynchos]]''), which like the sabre-toothed blenny mimic the bluestreak cleaner wrasse (''[[Labroides dimidiatus]]''), is frequency-dependent, meaning that the mimicry is more effective when the [[Cheating (biology)|cheating]] fangblenny is rare compared to the cleaner wrasse. The difference, however, is that the aggressive mimic is inserting itself into a co-operative relationship (between cleaner and client), whereas "Batesian mimics insert themselves into an antagonistic predator–prey interaction (where the models are the unpalatable prey)."&lt;ref name="CheneyCote"/&gt; The fangblenny has evolved an [[opioid]]-containing venom which dulls pain and lowers blood pressure, confusing the bitten host and giving the cheating mimic time to escape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Casewell |first1=Nicholas R. et al |title=The Evolution of Fangs, Venom, and Mimicry Systems in Blenny Fishes |journal=Current Biology |date=2017 |volume=TBA |issue=TBA |pages=TBA |doi=10.1016/j.cub.2017.02.067 |url=http://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(17)30269-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[semiotics]], '''denotation''' is the surface or the [[literal and figurative language|literal]] [[Meaning (semiotics)|meaning]]. The [[definition]] most likely to appear in a [[dictionary]].

==Discussion ==
Drawing from the original word or definition proposed by [[Ferdinand de Saussure|Saussure]] (1857-1913), a [[sign (semiotics)|sign]] has two parts:
*as a ''signifier'', i.e. it will have a form that a person can see, touch, smell, and/or hear, and
*as the ''signified'', i.e. it will represent an idea or mental construct of a thing rather than the thing itself. 
To transmit [[information]], both the addresser and the addressee must use the same [[code (Semiotics)|code]], whether in the literal sense, e.g. [[Morse Code]] or in the form of a [[language]]. The denotative meaning of a signifier is intended to communicate the objective [[semantic]] content of the represented thing. So, in the case of a [[lexical (Semiotics)|lexical]] word, say "book", the intention is to do no more than describe the physical object. Any other meanings or implications will be [[connotation (Semiotics)|connotative]] meanings.

The distinction between denotation and connotation can be made in textual analysis and the existence of dictionaries is used to support the argument that the [[sign system]] begins with a simple meaning that is then glossed as new usages are developed. But this argument equally means that no sign can be separated from both its denotational and connotational meanings, and, since the addresser is always using the sign for a particular purpose in a context, no sign can be divorced from the [[value (Semiotics)|values]] of the addresser. [[Louis Hjelmslev]] (1899-1965) therefore proposes that although the [[grammatical function|function]] of [[Sign (semiotics)|signification]] may be a single process, denotation is the first step, and connotation the second. [[Roland Barthes]] (1915-1980) added a third possible step in [[world view]] or ''Weltanschauung'' in which metacognitive [[Schema (psychology)|schema]] such as ''liberty'', ''sexuality'', ''autonomy'', etc. create a framework of reference from which more abstract meanings may be attributed to the signs, depending on the context.

Barthes and others have argued that it is more difficult to make a clear distinction when analysing [[image]]s. For example, how is one to interpret a photograph? In the real world, a human observer has binocular vision, but the two-dimensional picture must be analysed to determine depth and the relative size of objects depicted by applying rules of perspective, the operation of which can be confused by focus and composition. One view might be that the picture as interpreted is evidence of what it depicts and, since the technology collects and stores data from the real world, the resulting picture is a definition of what the camera was pointed at, and so denotational. Adopting the classification of [[Charles Sanders Peirce]],  this would be considered an indexical sign,  i.e. there is a direct connection between the signifier and the signified. While it is true that an unedited photograph may be an index, digital technology is eroding the viewer's confidence that the image is an objective representation of reality. Further, the photographer made conscious decisions about the composition of the image, how to light it, whether to take a close-up or long shot, etc. All of these decisions represent both the intention and the values of the photographer in wishing to preserve this image. This led John Fiske to suggest that, "denotation is what is photographed, connotation is how it is photographed". Such problems become even more difficult to resolve once the audience knows that the photograph or moving image has been edited or staged. (See also [[Modality (Semiotics)|modality]])

{{Italic title}}
'''''Esoteric Buddhism''''' is a book originally published in 1883 in London; it was compiled by a member of the [[Theosophical Society]], [[Alfred Percy Sinnett|A. P. Sinnett]].{{sfn|Formats and editions}}{{sfn|Kuhn|1992|p=154}} It was one of the first books written for the purpose explain of the [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophy]] for the wide range of readers,{{sfn|Lavoie|2012|p=197}} and was "made up of the [[Mahatma Letters|author's correspondence]] with an [[Koot Hoomi|Indian mystic]]."{{sfn|WorldCat Identities}} This is the most significant theosophical work of the author. According to [[Nicholas Goodrick-Clarke|Goodrick-Clarke]], it "disseminated the basic teachings of Theosophy in its new Asian cast."{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=12}}{{refn|group=note|"His [Sinnett's] second book, ''Esoteric Buddhism,'' an outline of some of the main teachings of theosophy, attracted much attention and served as a harbinger of [[Helena Blavatsky|H.P.B.'s]] monumental work, ''[[The Secret Doctrine]]''."{{sfn|Ryan|1975|loc=Ch. 9}}}}

== From history of compilation ==
Through the mediation of [[Helena Blavatsky|Blavatsky]]{{refn|group=note|P. Washington wrote that Blavatsky with Sinnett and his wife Patience has been in sincere friendship.{{sfn|Washington|1995|loc=Ch. 3}}}} Sinnett began a correspondence in 1880 with the two adepts, who sponsored the Theosophical Society, the [[mahatma]]s [[Kuthumi]] and [[Morya (Theosophy)|Morya]].{{sfn|Theosopedia}}{{refn|group=note|Goodrick-Clarke wrote that "the very concept of the [[mahatma|Masters]]" is the [[Rosicrucianism|Rosicrucian]] idea of "invisible and secret adepts, working for the advancement of humanity."{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=6}} And Tillett stated: "The concept of Masters or Mahatmas as presented by [[Helena Blavatsky|HPB]] involved a mixture of western and eastern ideas; she located most of them in India or Tibet. Both she and Colonel [[Henry Steel Olcott|Olcott]] claimed to have seen and to be in communication with Masters. In Western [[occultism]] the idea of 'Supermen' has been found in such schools as... the fraternities established by [[Martinez de Pasqually|de Pasqually]] and [[Louis Claude de Saint-Martin|de Saint-Martin]]."{{sfn|Tillett|1986|p=966}}}} [[Olav Hammer|Hammer]] noted that between 1880 and 1884 Sinnett received from the mahatmas circa one hundred twenty letters with explanation of "[[occult]] cosmology". From this material, he attempted to formulate in his new book "the basis of a revised theosophy."{{sfn|Hammer|2003|p=381}} By foundation of the book became "Cosmological notes" received from the Mahatma Morya{{sfn|Barker|1924|loc=Letters 12, 13}} together with a long series of answers to questions sent by mahatma Kuthumi{{sfn|Barker|1924|loc=Letters 14–18}} during the summer of 1882.{{sfn|Hanson|1980|loc=Ch. IX}}&lt;br/&gt;[[Tallapragada Subba Row|Subba Row]] received from his Master mahatma Morya the instruction to provide assistance to Sinnett in his work on the book, but, according to the memoirs of the author, he did it reluctantly, and what little help. The main help came from the mahatmas through Blavatsky in the form of answers to the questions referred to her by the author.{{sfn|Sinnett|1986|p=23}}

In preface to the original edition author says that [[exoteric]] [[Buddhism]] "has remained in closer union with the [[esoteric]] doctrine" than any other [[Major religious groups|world religion]]. Thus, specification of the "inner knowledge" addressed to modern readers will be connected with the familiar features of the Buddhist teaching. Sinnett argues that esoteric teaching "be most conveniently studied in its Buddhist aspect."{{Sfn|Sinnett|1885|p=xviii}}{{sfn|Hammer|2003|p=123}}

=== Esoteric teachers ===
At the beginning of the first chapter the author makes the following statement:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"I am bringing to my readers knowledge which I have obtained by favour{{refn|group=note|[[Mahatma Letters|Letters from mahatmas]] formed the basis of two theosophical books by Sinnett.{{sfn|Hammer|2003|p=61}}}} rather than by effort. It will not be found the less valuable on that account; I venture, on the contrary, to declare that it will be found of incalculably greater value, easily as I have obtained it, than any results in a similar direction which I could possibly have procured by ordinary methods of research."{{Sfnm|Sinnett|1885|1p=1|Лесевич|1887|2p=16}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
On the question of the whereabouts of his teachers Sinnett says that for a long time in [[Tibet]] there is a "certain secret region," hitherto unknown and inaccessible to ordinary people and for those living in the surrounding mountains as well as for visitors, "in which adepts have always congregated. But the country generally was not in Buddha's time, as it has since become, the chosen habitation of the great brotherhood. Much more than they are at present, were the Mahatmas in former times, distributed about the world." But the development of civilization has led to the fact that many occultists gathered in Tibet. The system of rules and laws for them has been developed in the 14th century by [[Je Tsongkhapa|Tsong-ka-pa]].{{sfn|Sinnett|1885|pp=181–182}}{{sfn|Lopez|1999|p=50}}

=== The constitution of man ===
The author argues that "a complete, or perfect man" is made up of [[Septenary (Theosophy)|seven elements]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
#The [[Physical body|Physical Body]] (''[[Rūpa]]'').
#Vitality (''[[Prana]]'', or ''Jiva'').
#[[Subtle body|Astral Body]] (''Linga Sharira'').
#Animal [[Soul]] ([[Kāma|''Kāma Rūpa'']]).
#Human Soul ([[Manas (early Buddhism)|''Manas'']]).
#Spiritual Soul (''[[Buddhi]]'').
#[[Spirit]] ([[Ātman (Buddhism)|''Ātma'']]).{{Sfnm|Sinnett|1885|1p=24|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|2p=17}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== The world periods ===
A French philosopher [[René Guénon]] stated that the central place of the Theosophical doctrine [which there is in Sinnett's book] is occupied the "idea of evolution." He then wrote that, according to the Theosophical teaching, there are
&lt;blockquote&gt;"seven '[[Root race|mother-races]]' succeed one another in the course of a 'world period', that is to say while the 'wave of life' sojourns on a given planet. Each 'race' includes seven 'sub-races', each of which is divided into seven 'branches'. On the other hand, the 'wave of life' successively runs through seven globes in a '[[Round (Theosophy)|round]]', and this 'round' is repeated seven times in a same 'planetary chain', after which the 'wave of life' passes to another 'chain', composed likewise of seven planets which will be traversed seven times in their turn. Thus there are seven 'chains' in a 'planetary system', also called an 'enterprise of evolution'; and finally, our solar system is formed of ten 'planetary systems'... We are presently in the fifth 'race' of our 'world period', and in the fourth 'round' of the 'chain' of which the earth forms part and in which it occupies the fourth rank. This 'chain' is also the fourth of our 'planetary system'."{{sfnm|Sinnett|1885|1pp=55, 131|Guénon|2004|2p=98}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Man after death ===
In the fifth chapter of his book, Sinnett explains the fate of man after death. Of the seven components that make up our personality, the three lower at the time of physical death, moving away from us.{{Sfn|Sinnett|1885|p=77}}{{sfn|Hammer|2003|p=466}} The four upper components move on [[Astral plane|Kama loca]], and "from there [soul] proceed to Devachan, a kind of theosophical version of heaven." (The analogy should not be carried overly; Sinnett argues that Devachan is a state, not a place.{{Sfn|Sinnett|1885|p=81}}{{sfn|Hammer|2003|p=466}}) Then these four components divide themselves, the law of [[karma]] specifies that it will happen to them—different souls receive different devachanic experience. Only after a long stay in this state, the soul [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|reincarnates]].{{refn|group=note|"The lower four, or quaternary, are transitory, while the upper triad is related to the eternal element in man, his real nature and identity with the universal soul."{{Sfn|Sinnett|1885|p=24}}{{sfn|Goodrick-Clarke|2004|p=17}}}} New incarnations on the [[Physical plane|earth plane]] are actually rather rare, "but re-birth in less than fifteen hundred years is spoken of as almost impossible."{{Sfn|Sinnett|1885|p=98}}{{sfn|Hammer|2003|p=466}}

Sinnett says that the mediums contact with the inhabitants of Devachan, but very rare, and in this time occurs the following:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The spirit of the [[Psychic|sensitive]], getting odylized,{{sfn|Melton|2001}} so to say, by the [[Aura (paranormal)|aura]] of the spirit in the Devachan, ''becomes'' for a few minutes that departed personality, and writes in the handwriting of the latter, in his language and in his thoughts, as they were during his lifetime. The two spirits become blended in one, and the preponderance of one over the other during such phenomena determines the preponderance of personality in the characteristic exhibited. Thus it may incidentally be observed, what is called ''[[rapport]],'' is, in plain fact, an identity of molecular vibration between the astral part of the incarnate medium and the astral part of the disincarnate personality."{{Sfnm|Sinnett|1885|1p=95|Hammer|2003|2p=467}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Occult philosophy ===
[[File:Man on planet.jpg|thumb|left|220px|&lt;center&gt;Diagram "Man on a Planet".{{refn|group=note|"Man evolves in seven major or root-races; 49 minor races; and the subordinate races or offshoots. The arrow indicates the direction taken by the evolutionary impulse.&lt;br/&gt;
I, II, III, IV, etc., are the seven major or [[root race|root-races]].&lt;br/&gt;
1, 2, 3, etc., are the minor races.&lt;br/&gt;
a, a, a, are the subordinate or offshoot races.&lt;br/&gt;
N, the initial and terminal point of evolution on the planet.&lt;br/&gt; 
S, the axial point where the development equilibrates or adjusts itself in each race evolution.&lt;br/&gt; 
E, the equatorial points wherein the descending arc intellect overcomes spirituality and in the ascending arc spirituality outstrips intellect.&lt;br/&gt;
A word or two [globe, earth] added to make it apply as well  to a whole manwantaric chain of worlds."{{sfn|Barker|1924|loc=Letter 14}}}}&lt;/center&gt;]]
Lavoie noted that in Sinnett's book there are the two major questions – "the structure of the universe and [[spiritual evolution]]." He selected "some key terms" in the book.{{sfn|Lavoie|2012|p=197}}

[[Avīci|'''Avitchi''']] is a state "of punishment reached only in exceptional cases and by exceptional natures." The usual man will work his karma out in a new [[Rebirth (Buddhism)|incarnation]].{{sfn|Sinnett|1885|p=93}}{{sfn|Lavoie|2012|p=197}}&lt;br/&gt;
[[Sukhavati|'''Devachan''']] is a state of greatest bliss where "the levels of intensity and the duration of stay are based on the karma one produces in his/her lifetime."{{sfn|Sinnett|1885|p=92}}{{sfn|Lavoie|2012|p=197}}&lt;br/&gt;
'''Eighth sphere''' is a planet associated with our planetary chain that is more materialistic than the earth.{{sfn|Sinnett|1885|p=113}}{{sfn|Lavoie|2012|p=197}} The Soul in the mean of the fifth round "can be sent to the eighth sphere for annihilation if it has developed a positive attraction to materialism and a repulsion of spirituality."{{sfn|Sinnett|1885|p=162}}{{sfn|Lavoie|2012|p=197}}&lt;br/&gt;
[[Astral plane|'''Kama loca''']] is "an unconscious state of gestation. It is here that the fourth principle (the animal soul) is separated from the others." The fourth component and some of the fifth component stays in Kama loca while "the rest of the principles continue on in their spiritual evolution."{{sfn|Sinnett|1885|pp=100–101}}{{sfn|Lavoie|2012|p=198}} The Ego's duration in Kama loca can last from few moments to years.{{sfn|Sinnett|1885|p=97}}{{sfn|Lavoie|2012|p=198}}&lt;br/&gt;
'''[[Manvantara]]''' is a period of activity or manifestation.{{sfn|Glossary|1999}} There are three different manvantaras: 1) the mahamanvantara, 2) the solar manvantara, 3) the minor manvantara.{{sfn|Sinnett|1885|pp=196–197}}{{sfn|Lavoie|2012|p=198}}&lt;br/&gt;
[[Monad (philosophy)|'''Monad''']] is upper triad of the seven principles of man (Atma-Buddhi-Manas).{{sfn|Glossary|1999}}{{sfn|Lavoie|2012|p=198}}&lt;br/&gt;
'''[[Pralaya]]''' is a state of nonbeing.{{sfn|Glossary|1999}} "Pralaya is described by Sinnett as a type of sleep, rest, or a time of inactivity." There are three different pralayas: 1) the mahapralaya, 2) the solar pralaya, 3) the minor pralaya.{{sfn|Sinnett|1885|pp=196–197}}{{sfn|Lavoie|2012|p=198}}&lt;br/&gt;
[[Round (Theosophy)|'''Round''']] is a full turnover via the seven globes. "During each round there is a maximum of 120 incarnations for each monad in each race with the average of 8,000 years between incarnations."{{sfn|Sinnett|1885|p=143}}{{sfn|Lavoie|2012|p=198}}

Man begins as a monad and dwells in seven major races on each of the seven planets. Each race takes circa one million years. Only 12,000 of those will be used for objective existence on the planets. The rest of that time will be used mainly in a subjective existence on the [[Mental plane|devachanic plane]]. "This meant that out of one million years – 988,000 years are spent reaping the effects of karma."{{sfn|Sinnett|1885|pp=142–143}}{{sfn|Lavoie|2012|p=199}}{{refn|group=note|In ''Mahatma Letters'' (letter 14) this number is "slightly different."{{sfn|Lavoie|2012|p=244}} The letter states that man "has passed in all his lives upon our planet (in this Round) but 77,700 years he has been in the subjective spheres 922,300 years."{{sfn|Barker|1924|loc=Letter 14}}}} A branch race is one of seven belonging to a subrace, itself one of seven belonging to a main race. "If each monad in each race incarnates once, the total number of incarnations in each globe would be 343 (7 branch races x 7 subraces x 7 [[root race]]s); however, each monad incarnates typically at a minimum of two times and some even more frequently."{{sfn|Sinnett|1885|pp=60–61, 140}}{{sfn|Lavoie|2012|p=199}} In ''Mahatma Letters'' it is said that "one life in each of the seven root-races; seven lives in each of the 49 sub-races – or 7 x 7 x 7 = 343 and add 7 more.

=== Theosophical Buddha ===
The ninth chapter of Sinnett's book called "Buddha". It begins with the words:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The historical Buddha, as known to the custodians of the esoteric doctrine, is a personage whose birth is not invested with the quaint marvels popular story has crowded round it. Nor was his progress to adeptship traced by the literal occurrence of the supernatural struggles depicted in symbolic legend. On the other hand, the incarnation, which may outwardly be described as the birth of Buddha, is certainly not regarded by occult science as an event like any other birth, nor the spiritual development through which Buddha passed during his earth-life a mere process of intellectual evolution, like the mental history of any other philosopher. The mistake which ordinary European writers make in dealing with a problem of this sort lies in their inclination to treat exoteric legend either as a record of a miracle about which no more need be said, or as pure myth, putting merely a fantastic decoration on a remarkable life."{{Sfnm|Sinnett|1885|1p=167|Lopez|2008|2pр=187–188}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
According to [[Donald S. Lopez Jr.|Lopez]], author of ''Esoteric Buddhism'' "has a broader view of the Buddha" than that of Western Buddhologists and scholars of Oriental studies. Sinnett stated that the Buddha is simply one of a row "of adepts who have appeared over the course of the centuries."{{Sfn|Lopez|2008|p=189}} Buddha's next incarnation happened approximately sixty years after his death. He appeared as [[Adi Shankara|Shankara]], the well-known Vedantic philosopher. Sinnett noted that for the uninitiated it is known that date of Shankara's birth is one thousand years after Buddha's death, and that he was hostile to Buddhism. Sinnett wrote that the Buddha came as Shankara "to fill up some gaps and repair certain errors in his own previous teaching."{{Sfn|Sinnett|1885|p=176}} The Buddha had leaved "from the practice of earlier adepts by opening the path" to adeptship to men of all [[caste]]s. "Although well-intentioned, this led" to a deterioration of occult knowledge when it was penetrated into ignominious hands.{{Sfn|Lopez|2008|p=189}} Sinnett wrote that to further appeared a need "to take no candidates except from the class which, on the whole, by reason of its hereditary advantages, is likely to be the best nursery of fit candidates."{{Sfn|Sinnett|1885|p=177}}&lt;br/&gt;Sinnett claimed that the  Buddha's next incarnation was as the great Tibetan adept reformer of the 14th century Tsong-ka-pa.{{Sfn|Sinnett|1885|p=181}}

=== Against blind faith ===
In the tenth chapter Sinnett expresses (as well as the Mahatmas) his very negative attitude to religiosity of any kind. He argues:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Nothing can produce more disastrous effects on human progress, as regards the destiny of individuals, than the very prevalent notion that one religion followed out in a pious spirit, is as good as another, and that if such and such doctrines are perhaps absurd when you look into them, the great majority of good people will never think of their absurdity, but will recite them in a blamelessly devoted attitude of mind."{{Sfnm|Sinnett|1885|1pp=194–195|Guénon|2004|2p=126}}{{refn|group=note|"It is priestly imposture that rendered these gods so terrible to man; it is religion that makes of him the selfish bigot, the fanatic that hates all mankind out of his own sect without rendering him any better or more moral for it. It is the belief in God and gods that makes two-thirds of humanity the slaves of a handful of those who deceive them under the false pretence of saving them. &lt;...&gt; In our [Tibetan] temples there is neither a god nor gods worshipped, only the thrice sacred memory of the greatest as the holiest [[Gautama Buddha|''man'']] that ever lived."{{sfn|Barker|1924|loc=Letter 10}}}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Criticism ==
The presence of a secret or esoteric teaching in Buddhism is "not accepted by orthodox Buddhist."{{sfn|Harris}} For example, [[Thomas Rhys Davids|Rhys Davids]] wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"In this connection, I shall doubtless be expected to say a few words on Theosophy, if only because one of the books giving an account of that very curious and widely spread movement has been called ''Esoteric Buddhism.'' It has always been a point of wonder to me why the author should have chosen this particular title for his treatise. For if there is anything that can be said with absolute certainty about the book it is, that it is not esoteric, and not Buddhism. The original Buddhism was the very contrary of esoteric."{{sfn|Rhys Davids|1896|pp=209–210}}{{refn|group=note|Nonetheless [[Christmas Humphreys|Humphreys]] wrote that "Buddha's Teaching was not born from a spiritual vacuum, but was an expression of some portion of that Gupta Vidya 'the accumulated Wisdom of the ages', which antedates all known religions."{{sfn|Humphreys|2012|p=23}}&lt;br/&gt;
"'''Gupta-vidya''' (Sanskrit) ''Gupta-vidyā'' [from ''gupta'' from the verbal root ''gup'' to conceal, preserve + ''vidyā'' knowledge, wisdom] Secret knowledge, secret wisdom; the source of all religions and philosophies known to the world: theosophy, the ancient wisdom-religion, the esoteric philosophy."{{sfn|Glossary|1999}}}}{{refn|group=note|Sinnett received instructions from the Tibetan Masters, and Rhys Davids believed that [[Lamaism]] was a Religion not only different from Buddhism, but and being in his time in antagonism with the teachings and the institutions of original Buddhism.{{sfn|Лесевич|1887|p=16}} See also a book by Eva M. Dargyay{{sfn|Dargyay|1979}}}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[René Guénon|Guénon's]] opinion on the subject was the same. He wrote that never was genuine "esoteric Buddhism." The ancient Buddhism was substantially an exoteric teaching "serving as theoretical support for a social movement with egalitarian tendencies."{{sfn|Guénon|2004|p=93}} According to Guénon, Sinnett, who "at the beginning probably contributed more than anybody else to make [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophism]] known in Europe, was genuinely fooled by all of Mme Blavatsky's tricks."{{sfn|Guénon|2004|p=36}}

Some Theosophists did not share the views presented by Sinnett in his new work; for example, according to [[Anna Kingsford|Kingsford]], this book was very distant from the esoteric, and the main mistake of the author was that he thought about the symbols as reality.{{sfn|Washington|1995|loc=Ch. 4}}

== New editions and translations ==
After its first publication in 1883 the book was reprinted several times: in the same 1883 came 2nd edition, in 1885 – 5th, 1898 – 8th. This work has been translated into several European languages: French, German, Italian, Spanish, Russian.{{sfn|Formats and editions}}{{refn|group=note|"153 editions published between 1883 and 2016 in 8 languages and held by 610 WorldCat member libraries worldwide".{{sfn|WorldCat Identities}}}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19946">{{short description|The competition of sets of genes, traits, or species, that develop adaptations and counter-adaptations against each other}}
In [[evolutionary biology]], an '''evolutionary arms race''' is a struggle between competing sets of [[co-evolution|co-evolving]] [[gene]]s, traits, or species, that develop [[adaptation (biology)|adaptation]]s and counter-adaptations against each other, resembling an [[arms race]]. These are often described as examples of [[positive feedback]].&lt;ref name="Blindwatchmaker"&gt;Dawkins, R. 1996. ''[[The Blind Watchmaker]]'' New York: W. W. Norton. Note: This book was also published by Penguin in 1991. While the text is identical, page numbers differ&lt;/ref&gt;  The co-evolving gene sets may be in different [[species]], as in an evolutionary arms race between a [[predator]] species and its [[prey]] (Vermeij, 1987), or a [[parasitism|parasite]] and its host.  Alternatively, the arms race may be between members of the same species, as in the manipulation/sales resistance model of communication (Dawkins &amp; Krebs, 1979) or as in [[runaway evolution]] or [[Red Queen's Hypothesis|Red Queen]] effects. One example of an evolutionary arms race is in [[sexual conflict]] between the sexes, often described with the term [[Fisherian runaway]]. [[Thierry Lodé]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Thierry Lodé]] "La guerre des sexes chez les animaux" Eds Odile Jacob, Paris {{ISBN|2-7381-1901-8}};&lt;/ref&gt; emphasized the role of such antagonistic interactions in [[evolution]] leading to [[character displacement]]s and [[antagonistic coevolution]].

== Symmetrical versus asymmetrical arms races ==

Arms races may be classified as either symmetrical or asymmetrical. In a symmetrical arms race, selection pressure acts on participants in the same direction.  An example of this is trees growing taller as a result of competition for light, where the selective advantage for either species is increased height.  An asymmetrical arms race involves contrasting selection pressures, such as the case of cheetahs and gazelles, where cheetahs evolve to be better at hunting and killing while gazelles evolve not to hunt and kill, but rather to evade capture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=da Cruz|first1=João Filipe|last2=Gaspar|first2=Helena|last3=Calado|first3=Gonçalo|title=Turning the game around: toxicity in a nudibranch-sponge predator–prey association|journal=Chemoecology|date=29 November 2011|volume=22|issue=1|pages=47–53|doi=10.1007/s00049-011-0097-z}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Host-parasite dynamic ==

Selective pressure between two species can include [[host-parasite coevolution]]. This antagonistic relationship leads to the necessity for the pathogen to have the best virulent alleles to infect the organism and for the host to have the best resistant alleles to survive parasitism. As a consequence, allele frequencies vary through time depending on the size of virulent and resistant populations (fluctuation of genetic selection pressure) and generation time (mutation rate) where some genotypes are preferentially selected thanks to the individual fitness gain. Genetic change accumulation in both population explains a constant adaptation to have lower fitness costs and avoid extinction in accordance with the [[Red Queen's hypothesis]] suggested by [[Leigh Van Valen]] in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;[[Leigh Van Valen|Van Valen, Leigh]] (1973). A new evolutionary law, ''Evolutionary Theory 1, 1¬30''&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==

=== The ''Phytophthora infestans''/Bintje potato interaction ===

The [[Bintje]] Potato is derived from a cross between ''Munstersen'' and ''Fransen'' potato varieties. It was created in the Netherlands and now is mainly cultivated in the North of France and Belgium. The oomycete ''Phytophthora infestans'' is responsible for the potato blight, in particular during the European famine in 1840. [[Zoospore]]s (mobile spores, characteristics of oomycetes) are liberated by zoosporangia provided from a mycelium and brought by rain or wind before infecting tubers and leaves. Black colours appear on the plant because of the infection of its cellular system necessary for the multiplication of the oomycete infectious population. The parasite contains virulent-avirulent allelic combinations in several microsatellite loci, likewise the host contains several multiloci resistance genes (or [[R gene]]). That interaction is called [[gene-for-gene relationship]] and is, in general, widespread in plant diseases. Expression of genetic patterns in the two species is a combination of resistance and virulence characteristics in order to have the best survival rate.&lt;ref name="Flier Turkensteen van den Bosch Vereijken 2001 pp. 292–301"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Flier | first=W.

=== Bats and moths ===

[[Bat]]s have evolved to use echolocation to detect and catch their prey. Moths have in turn evolved to detect the echolocation calls of hunting bats, and evoke evasive flight maneuvers,&lt;ref name="Fullard et al 2004"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1=Fullard | first1=J.

=== The rough-skinned newt and the common garter snake ===

[[Rough-skinned newt|Rough-skinned newts]] have skin glands that contain a powerful nerve poison, [[tetrodotoxin]], as an [[anti-predator adaptation]]. Throughout much of the newt's range, the [[common garter snake]] is resistant to the toxin. While in principle the toxin binds to a tube-shaped protein that acts as a sodium channel in the snake's nerve cells, a mutation in several snake populations configures the protein in such a way as to hamper or prevent binding of the toxin, conferring resistance. In turn, resistance creates a selective pressure that favors newts that produce more toxin. That in its turn imposes a selective pressure favoring snakes with mutations conferring even greater resistance. This evolutionary arms race has resulted in the newts producing levels of toxin far in excess of that needed to kill any other predator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Feldman|first=C.

=== Predator whelk and the hard-shelled bivalve prey ===

The whelk predators used their own shell to open the shell of their prey, oftentimes breaking both shells of the predator and prey in the process. This led to the fitness of larger-shelled prey to be higher and then more selected for through generations, however, the predator’s population selected for those who were more efficient at opening the larger-shelled prey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dietl |first1=Gregory P.|title=Coevolution of a marine gastropod predator and its dangerous bivalve prey |journal=Biological Journal of the Linnean Society |date=3 November 2003 |volume=80 |issue=3 |pages=409–436 |doi=10.1046/j.1095-8312.2003.00255.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; This example is an excellent example of asymmetrical arms race because while the prey is evolving a physical trait, the predators are adapting in a much different way.

=== Floodplain death adders and separate species of frogs ===

Floodplain death adders eat three types of frogs, one nontoxic, one producing mucus when taken by the predator, and the highly toxic frogs, however, the snakes have also found if they wait to consume their toxic prey the potency decreases. In this specific case, the asymmetry enabled the snakes to overcome the chemical defenses of the toxic frogs after their death.&lt;ref name=phillips&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Phillips|first1=Ben|last2=Shine|first2=Richard|title=When Dinner Is Dangerous: Toxic Frogs Elicit Species‐Specific Responses from a Generalist Snake Predator |journal=The American Naturalist|date=December 2007|volume=170|issue=6 |pages=936–942 |doi=10.1086/522845|pmid=18171175}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results of the study showed that the snake became accustomed to the differences in the frogs by their hold and release timing, always holding the nontoxic, while always releasing the highly toxic frogs, with the frogs that discharge mucus somewhere in between. The snakes would also spend generously more time gaped between the release of the highly toxic frogs than the short gaped time between the release of the frogs that discharge mucus. Therefore, the snakes have a much higher advantage of being able to cope with the different frogs defensive mechanisms, while the frogs could eventually increase the potency of their toxic knowing the snakes would adapt to that change as well, such as the snakes having venom themselves for the initial attack.&lt;ref name=phillips /&gt; The coevolution is still highly asymmetrical because of the advantage the predators have over their prey.&lt;ref name=phillips /&gt;

== Introduced species ==
[[File:Bufo marinus 1 (1).jpg|thumb|Cane Toads have experienced a massive population explosion in Australia due to the lack of competition.]]

When a species has not been subject to an arms race previously, it may be at a severe disadvantage and face [[extinction]] well before it could ever hope to adapt to a new predator, competitor, etc. This should not seem surprising, as one species may have been in evolutionary struggles for millions of years while the other might never have faced such pressures.  This is a common problem in isolated ecosystems such as [[Australia]] or the [[Hawaiian Islands]].  In Australia, many [[invasive species]], such as [[cane toad]]s and [[rabbits in Australia|rabbit]]s, have spread rapidly due to a lack of competition and a lack of adaptations to cane toad [[bufotenine]] on the part of potential predators. [[Introduced species]] are a major reason why some [[indigenous (ecology)|indigenous]] species become [[endangered]] or even [[extinct]], as was the case with the [[dodo]].{{cn|date=September 2018}}

==Life==
After his initial education Francis of Marchia became an instructor at various places to include a studia.&lt;ref&gt;Pasnau, Robert, and Christina van Dyke. The Cambridge History of Medieval Philosophy. Cambridge, UK; New York: Cambridge University Press, 2010. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  His most famous teachings were his commentaries on the ''[[Sentences]]'' at the University of Paris.  It is likely that Marchia's lectures were transcribed by his students, which he edited resulting in several versions of his commentary in manuscript form.&lt;ref&gt;Robiglio, Andrea A. "How is Strength of the Will Possible? Concerning Francis of Marchia and the Act of the Will." Vivarium: An International Journal for the Philosophy and Intellectual Life of the Middle Ages and Renaissance 44.1 (2006): 151-83. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  Before leaving for [[Avignon]] around 1324 to teach at a Franciscan convent, Marchia composed several scholarly commentaries, including two on ''[[Aristotle's Metaphysics]]'' and one on ''[[Physics]]''.  The ''Quodlibet'' was written afterwards, between 1324 and 1328.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Russell L., Schabel, Chris. "Introduction." Vivarium: An International Journal for the Philosophy and Intellectual Life of the Middle Ages and Renaissance 44.1 (2006): 1-20. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;   Marchia supported the Franciscan Minister General, [[Michael of Cesena]], and renounced [[Pope John XXII]]’s concept of poverty in 1328.  Following the renunciation he fled with Michael and William of Ockham to Munich.  The ''Improbatio'', a rebuttal to the Pope's Papal bull titled ''Quia vir reprobus'', was written during this time, as well as the ''Allegationes Religiosorum Vivorum'', co-authored by Marchia and Ockham and assembled by Michael.&lt;ref&gt;Lambertini, Roberto. "Francis of Marchia and William of Ockham: Fragments from a Dialogue." Vivarium: An International Journal for the Philosophy and Intellectual Life of the Middle Ages and Renaissance 44.1 (2006): 184-204. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1343 Marchia repented and died shortly after.

==Philosophy==

===Property Rights===
In the ''Improbatio'', Francis of Marchia focuses on determining when and where property rights originated to support the Franciscan belief that Christ lived in absolute poverty.  He distinguishes between two types of dominia: the dominium before the fall and the dominium after.  The dominium before the fall, also known as the dominion of the prelapsarian state, was a time where all of God’s creatures rejoiced in happiness, were deeply connected to one another, and shared in God’s creation. The dominium after the fall was caused by the first sin of Adam, making the issue of property rights distinctly human.&lt;ref&gt;Lambertini, Roberto. ''Francis of Marchia and William of Ockham: Fragments from a Dialogue''. Vivarium: An International Journal for the Philosophy and Intellectual Life of the Middle Ages and Renaissance 44.1 (2006): 184-204. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pope had denied that the origin of property was linked to humans, claiming that it was sin itself that was the cause.  Marchia agreed that without sin there would be no property rights, however, sin did not immediately bring about the concept of property.  Francis maintained it was human law that was responsible for the formation of property rights, not Divine law, and used the story of Cain and Abel, citing Cain’s corrupted will to support his belief.&lt;ref&gt;Lambertini, Roberto. ''Francis of Marchia and William of Ockham: Fragments from a Dialogue''. Vivarium: An International Journal for the Philosophy and Intellectual Life of the Middle Ages and Renaissance 44.1 (2006): 184-204. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Projectile Motion===
Francis of Marchia’s theory of [[projectile motion]], referred to as '''''virtus derelicta''''', is described in the sections of his commentaries on ''[[Sentences]]'' explaining the consecration of the Eucharist.   Virtus derelicta states: the motion of an object is caused by a force left behind by the object that acted upon it.  Unlike the theory of inertia meant to explain natural phenomenon, Marchia formulates virtus derelicta to be an all-inclusive explanation of both natural and supernatural phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;Zanin, Fabio. ''Francis of Marchia, Virtus Derelicta, and Modifications of the Basic 
Principles of Aristotelian Physics''. Vivarium: An International Journal for the Philosophy and Intellectual Life of the Middle Ages and Renaissance 44.1 
(2006): 81-95. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; 
  
Virtus derelicta explains several different kinds of motion – perpetual and finite - and is meant to account for unnatural changes.  '''Key elements of virtus derelicta include''':

*An object is put in motion by another object, which leaves virtus derelicta in the moving object.
*At the beginning of any given motion, virtus derelicta can work with or against the natural disposition of the object in motion.
*If it works against the moving object, virtus derelicta will dissipate and eventually leave the body, ceasing motion.
*If it works with the moving object, virtus derelicta stays in the object causing the potential for perpetual motion.

There are several philosophers before Marchia’s time, such as [[Richard Rufus of Cornwall]] from the 13th century, that seem to form their own versions of virtus derelicta, so it is unclear whether this theory truly originated from Marchia.  It is evident, however, that philosophers such as [[Jean Buridan]] and [[Gerard Odonis]] used Marchia’s theory to refine their own concepts of virtus derelicta, confirming that the Franciscan played a key role in the evolution of philosophy on physics.&lt;ref&gt;Schabel, Chris. ''Francis of Marchia's Virtus Derelicta and the Context of its Development''. Vivarium: An International Journal for the Philosophy and Intellectual Life of the Middle Ages and Renaissance 44.1 (2006): 41-80. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Act of the Will===
Another focus of Francis of Marchia’s commentary on the ''[[Sentences]]'' posed in ''Book II'' was how the will could act against reason resulting in '''moral culpability''': whether the will could either act prior to, or against rational judgment.  Marchia argued that the will is the cause of action.  After a judgment is made, the will decides to act either in accordance with that judgment or against it.  The will constitutes the [[middle term]] between judgment and action.  Without it, the judgment would necessitate action, negating the concept of free will and moral culpability. In addition, the will is under a law that obliges it to perform good acts.  Without this obligation there would be no sin.&lt;ref&gt;Robiglio, Andrea A. ''How is Strength of the Will Possible? Concerning Francis of Marchia and the Act of the Will''. Vivarium: An International Journal for the Philosophy and Intellectual Life of the Middle Ages and Renaissance 44.1 (2006): 151-83. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

To answer how the will could go against this obligation, Marchia distinguishes between apprehensive and a judicative acts.  Apprehensive acts are necessary for the will to function, and are result of intellectual cognitions and judgments. Judicative acts are formed from more complex knowledge where reasoning is judiciously applied.  Volition does not require judicative acts to be performed, which explains how humans are able to sin.  In other words, the will does not depend on rational judgment.&lt;ref&gt;Robiglio, Andrea A. ''How is Strength of the Will Possible? Concerning Francis of Marchia and the Act of the Will''. Vivarium: An International Journal for the Philosophy and Intellectual Life of the Middle Ages and Renaissance 44.1 (2006): 151-83. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
To avoid the objection that judgment is required for reasoning and cannot be ignored in the deliberative process, Marchia offers a further distinction between apprehensive and judicative knowledge, and two types of rational reflective judgments.  These distinctions allow for one judgment to be selected over another due to the strength it receives from being selected by the will.&lt;ref&gt;Robiglio, Andrea A. ''How is Strength of the Will Possible? Concerning Francis of Marchia and the Act of the Will''. Vivarium: An International Journal for the Philosophy and Intellectual Life of the Middle Ages and Renaissance 44.1 (2006): 151-83. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

He formally became a theologian in 1257 and from then was known as an opponent of the [[mendicant orders]],&lt;ref&gt;Lesley M.

His ''Contra adversarium perfectionis christianae'' of c. 1269, in support of [[William of St Amour]], argued that extreme emphasis on poverty contradicted the Aristotelian doctrine of the mean&lt;ref&gt;Virpi Mäkinen, ''Property Rights in the Late Medieval Discussion on Franciscan Poverty'' (2001),p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt; and undermined the basis of pastoral work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://users.bart.nl/~roestb/franciscan/GILLEEDS.html Gilleeds&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; It provoked replies from [[Thomas Aquinas]] and [[Bonaventure]].&lt;ref&gt;[[David Knowles (scholar)|David Knowles]], ''The Religious Orders in England'' I (1979 edition), p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt;  From the [[Franciscan]] side, Bonaventure wrote ''Apologia pauperum'', and [[John Peckham]] wrote his ''Tractatus pauperis''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christusrex.org/www1/ofm/fra/FRAht02.html History of the Franciscan Movement (2)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] Aquinas wrote his case on the "state of perfection" in ''De Perfectione Vitae Spiritualis contra Doctrinam Retrahentium a Religione'' (1270).&lt;ref&gt;[http://maritain.nd.edu/jmc/etext/homp272.htm History of Medieval Philosophy 272&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

On [[Trinitarianism|trinitarian]] theology, however, Gerard was much closer to the emerging Franciscan view.&lt;ref&gt;Russell L. Friedman, ''Trinitarian Texts from the Franciscan Trinitarian Tradition, ca. 1265-85'', in ''Cahiers de L'Institut Du Moyen-Âge Grec Et Latin'', Volume 73 (2006), p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; With Aquinas, he was one of the developers of the ''[[quodlibet]]'' genre of open philosophical discussion, flourishing for about a century from his time.&lt;ref&gt;[[André Vauchez]], [[Richard Barrie Dobson]], [[Michael Lapidge]], ''Encyclopedia of the Middle Ages'' (2001 translation), p. 1207.&lt;/ref&gt; His polemics used a combination of quodlibets and sermons.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Tugwell, ''Albert &amp; Thomas: Selected Writings'' (1988), p. 229.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a major benefactor to the [[Sorbonne]] library, leaving it around 300 books and manuscripts;&lt;ref&gt;Cornelius O'Boyle, ''The Art of Medicine: Medical Teaching at the University of Paris, 1250-1400'' (1998), p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt; his collection was based on that of [[Richard de Fournival]], outstanding in Europe in his time.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremiah Hackett, ''Roger Bacon and the Sciences: Commemorative Essays'' (1997), p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1813">'''Gumersindo de Azcárate''' (1840, [[León, Spain|León]] - 1917, [[Madrid]]) was a [[Spain|Spanish]] philosopher, jurist and politician.

After law studies in [[Oviedo]], he taught [[comparative law]] in Madrid since 1864 and represented León in the [[Cortes Generales|Cortes]]. In the 1870s, he joined [[Francisco Giner de los Ríos]] and [[Julián Sanz del Río]] to teach at the [[Institución Libre de Enseñanza]] (Institute of Free Teaching).

De Azcárate was a leading representative of [[Krausismo]], a philosophy based on the teachings of [[Karl Christian Friedrich Krause]], in law. In his works, which include ''Estudios económicos y sociales'' (1876), ''El self-government y la Monarquía doctrinaria'' (1877), ''Estudios filosóficos y políticos'' (1877) and ''Concepto de la Sociología'' (1876), he opposed excessive political [[centralism]], proposed [[privatisation]] of nonessential governmental functions and studied models of parliamentary and decentralised government.

In 1912, he was the co-founder of the [[Reformist Republican Party]].

'''Harry''' is a [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] derogatory term used in slang, derived from the [[England|English]] name [[Harry (name)|Harry]].&lt;ref name="Dictionary"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dokpro.uio.no/perl/ordboksoek/ordbok.cgi?OPP=harry&amp;bokmaal=S%F8k+i+Bokm%E5lsordboka&amp;ordbok=bokmaal&amp;alfabet=n&amp;renset=j |title=Entry on "harry" |language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The best English translation may be "cheesy" or "tacky". ''[[Norsk ordbok (Riksmål)|Norsk ordbok]]'' defines "harry" as "tasteless, vulgar".&lt;ref name="no" /&gt;

The term "harry" was first used by [[upper class]] youth in [[Oslo]] in the beginning of the 20th century, and was used to describe people who belonged to the [[working class]]. People in the lower social classes at the time often gave their children [[England|English]] first names such as [[Harry (name)|Harry]]. The middle and upper classes mostly preferred Scandinavian or German (and occasionally French) names. English names (except English names that are also widely found in other European languages) had no tradition in Scandinavia and were generally considered bad taste and as a phenomenon of the working-class of the time in all the Scandinavian countries. The traditional elite of Norway mostly used conservative Danish names.

A person who is ''harry'' is often perceived as unsophisticated, vulgar or with bad taste.&lt;ref name="Dictionary" /&gt;&lt;ref name="no"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ordnett.no/ordbok.html?search=harry&amp;search_type=&amp;publications=23 |title=Entry on "Harry" |publisher=Kunnskapsforlaget|language=Norwegian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="financialExpress"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.financialexpress.com/news/&amp;8216harry&amp;8217-pottiness-stirs-swedishnorwegian-shop-war/40443/|title=‘Harry’ Pottiness Stirs Swedish-Norwegian Shop War|date=March 16, 2002|publisher=Financial Express|accessdate=2009-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The effect of bad taste is often characterized with the term ''harry'', e.g. a ''harry'' dress or a ''harry'' car. Since the definition of good and bad taste is defined by fashion, there is no precise definition of ''harry''. [[D.D.E. (band)|D.D.E.]], [[Sputnik_(singer)|Sputnik]], shopping in [[Sweden]], [[Raggare]] culture and [[Mullet (haircut)|mullet]]s are often mentioned today. In the 1970s it was the 1960s' hairwax or sharp shoes that were harry. In the 1980s the 1970s' flared pants or whiskers, and in the 1990s more or less everything that could be associated with the 1980s. Yesterday's fashion will often be interpreted as harry. Often what is harry in one period can be hip [[retro]] fashion the next year.

Harry may also be interpreted as something like [[Machismo|macho]]. The feminine parallel is ''doris''.

The term was repopularised by then minister of Agriculture [[Lars Sponheim]] in 2002 to describe Norwegians who drive (in some cases, for hours) to reach and cross the border to [[Sweden]] in order to [[Border trade|purchase groceries, tobacco and alcohol at cheaper prices]]. Responses to this were retorts that seeking out bargains is smart shopping, and Swedish shops introduced humorous campaigns with one shopkeeper giving 1000 [[Swedish krona|SEK]] to customers named "Harry".&lt;ref name="financialExpress"/&gt; The terms ''Harrytur'' ("Harry trip") or ''Harryhandel'' ("Harry trade") have since been popular descriptions of this trade.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dagbladet.no/2009/02/16/nyheter/utenriks/harry-handel/4884668/ Harryhandel til halv pris] Dagbladet, February 16, 2009 {{no icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''internal measurement''' is one of the measurement theories. From,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author=Kouichirou Matsuno
|year=2000
|title=What is Internal Measurement? (in Japanese)
|publisher=Seidosha
|location=Japan
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; we introduce the definition of the internal measurement. 
The experience consists of "unremitting measurements". These "unremitting measurements" appear only in the experience. In the experience, if any individual has a relation to another individual then this is a "measurement which identifies another individual", where this measurement enable if the individual can specify the effects from another individual. Moreover, a "measurement which identifies another individual" is unremitting in the experience. As above a measurement such that if any individual measure another individual then this measurement inherent in "unremitting measurements" is called the internal measurement. This theory is found by Kouichirou Matsuno and 
is developed by [[Yukio-Pegio Gunji]].  

There is a likeness between internal measurement and [[endophysics]]. 
However, they have slight difference, that is, internal measurement have before-after logical asymmetry.

==Background==
John Elof Boodin was born in Pjätteryd Parish in [[Älmhult]],  [[Kronoberg County]], Sweden. Boodin  was a younger son of sizable rural family. In his youth, several of his brothers had already immigrated to the United States. During his lifetime additional siblings continued to settle in America. He attended the mission training school established by Swedish Lutheran missionary [[Peter Fjellstedt]] in [[Uppsala]]. He emigrated to the United States from [[Småland]], Sweden in 1887 at the age of 18. He taught at the parochial school of the First Evangelical Lutheran Church of [[Galesburg, Illinois]].

'''Josephinism''' was the collective domestic policies of [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor]] (1765–1790). During the ten years in which Joseph was the sole ruler of the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] (1780–1790), he attempted to legislate a series of drastic reforms to remodel Austria in the form of what liberals saw as an ideal "[[Enlightened absolutism|Enlightened]]" state. This provoked severe resistance from powerful forces within and outside his empire, but ensured that he would be remembered as an "[[Enlightened absolutism|enlightened ruler]]" by historians from then to the present day.

==Joseph II==

Born in 1741, Joseph was the son of [[Maria Theresa of Austria]] and [[Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor]]. Given a rigorous education in the [[Age of Enlightenment]]—with its emphasis on rationality, order, and careful organization in statecraft—it is little wonder that, viewing the often confused and complex morass of Habsburg administration in the crownlands of Austria, Bohemia, and Hungary, Joseph was deeply dissatisfied. He inherited the crown of the Holy Roman Empire in 1765, on the death of his father, but ruled the Habsburg lands only as "joint ruler" with his mother, the matriarch Maria Theresa, until 1780.{{sfn|Berenger|1990|p=99}}

==1780–87==
It was on the death of his mother in 1780 that Joseph II had the opportunity—free of any dominating hand—to pursue his own agenda. He intended a complete remodeling of Habsburg society in several different arenas. Issuing decrees and Patents, Joseph's reforms were a conscious attempt to reorder the rule of his lands using Enlightened principles. At the heart of this "Josephinism" lay the idea of the unitary state, with a centralized, efficient government, rational and mostly secular society, with greater degrees of equality and freedom, and fewer arbitrary feudal institutions.

==Serfs, lords, and forced serf labor==
For many centuries, the majority of the population of Central Europe had lived as serfs, laboring under feudal obligations to Lords.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}} On November 1, 1781, Joseph issued two Patents pertaining to Bohemia, which changed the serf-Lord relationship there by abolishing the use of fines and corporal punishment on serfs, and abolishing Lords' control over serfs' marriage, freedom of movement, and choice of occupation. The patents also allowed peasants to purchase hereditary ownership of the land that they worked. The nobility were hesitant to support Joseph's edicts, however, and they were inconsistently applied.{{sfn|Okey|2002|pp=41-2}}

Throughout his reign, Joseph's ultimate goal was one shared originally with his mother regarding policy toward the serfs. Robin Okey, in ''The Habsburg Monarchy'', describes it as the replacement of the [[forced labor|forced serf labor]] system by the division of landed estates (including the demesne) among rent-paying tenants".{{sfn|Okey|2002|p=42}} In 1783, Joseph's advisor Franz Anton von Raab was instructed to extend this system to all lands owned directly by the Habsburg crown in Bohemia and Moravia.{{sfn|Okey|2002|p=42}}

==Censorship and the press==

In February 1781, Joseph issued an edict drastically reducing the power of state censorship over the press. Censorship was limited only to expression that (a) blasphemed against the church, (b) subverted the government, or (c) promoted immorality. Censorship was also taken out of the hands of local authorities and centralized under the Habsburg imperial government.

Joseph was remarkably tolerant of dissenting speech—his censors banned only about 900 tracts published each year (down from 4,000 a year banned before his reign). One tract that even criticized him specifically, titled "The 42 Year-Old Ape", was not banned.{{sfn|Ingrao|2000|p=198}}

==Edicts of Tolerance==
[[Image:Toleranzpatent 001.jpg|thumb|The Edict of Tolerance of 1781]]

{{main|1782 Edict of Tolerance}}
While himself a Catholic—and certainly no advocate of unlimited religious freedom—Joseph was willing to tolerate a level of religious diversity in his domain that had been unthinkable not long before.

In May and October 1781, Joseph issued Edicts which removed restrictions against the practice of Protestant and Orthodox Christian religion. In communities with large Protestant or Orthodox minorities, churches were allowed to be built, and social restrictions on vocations, economic activity, and education were removed.{{sfn|Okey|2002|p=43}}

In 1782, Joseph dismantled many of the legal barriers against Jews performing certain professions, and lifted Jewish dress laws, Jewish-only taxes, and some restrictions on the movement of Jews. Nevertheless, he remained of the belief that Jews possessed "repellent characteristics". His decrees regarding that community did not include Galicia, the Habsburg province with the largest Jewish minority.{{sfn|Ingrao|2000|p=199}}

==Catholic Church in Habsburg lands==
Regarding the Catholic Church, Joseph was virulently opposed to what he called "contemplative" religious institutions—reclusive institutions that were seen as doing nothing positive for the community.

By Joseph's decree, Austrian bishops could not communicate directly with the [[Curia]] anymore. More than 500 of 1,188 monasteries in Austro-Slav lands (and a hundred more in Hungary) were dissolved, and 60 million [[Austro-Hungarian gulden|florins]] taken by the state. This wealth was used to create 1,700 new parishes and welfare institutions.{{sfn|Okey|2002|p=44}}

The education of priests was taken from the Church as well. Joseph established six state-run "General Seminaries". In 1783, a Marriage Patent treated marriage as a civil contract rather than a religious institution.{{sfn|Berenger|1990|p=102}}

When the pope visited Austria in 1782, Joseph refused to rescind the majority of his decisions.{{sfn|Ingrao|2000|p=199}}

In 1783, the cathedral chapter of Passau opposed the nomination of a Josephinist bishop and sent, first, an appeal to the emperor himself, which naturally was rejected, then an appeal to the [[Perpetual Diet of Regensburg|Imperial Diet]] at [[Regensburg]], from which body, however, help could scarcely be expected. Assistance offered by Prussia was refused by [[Cardinal Firmian]]'s successor, Bishop [[Joseph Franz Auersperg]], an adherent of Josephinism. The bishop of Passau and the majority of his cathedral chapter finally yielded in order to save the secular property of the diocese.

By an agreement of 4 July 1784, the confiscation of all the properties and rights belonging to the [[Diocese of Passau]] in Austria was annulled, and the tithes and revenues were restored to it. In return Passau gave up its diocesan rights and authority in Austria, including the provostship of Ardagger, and bound itself to pay 400,000 gulden ($900,000), afterwards reduced by the emperor to one-half toward the equipment of the new diocese.

There was nothing left for [[Pope Pius VI]] to do but to give his consent, even though unwillingly, to the emperor's authoritarian act. The papal sanction of the agreement between Vienna and Passau was issued on 8 November 1784, and on 28 January 1785, appeared the Bull of Erection, "[[Romanus Pontifex (1785)|Romanus Pontifex]]".

As early as 1785 the Viennese ecclesiastical order of services was made obligatory, "in accordance with which all musical litanies, novenas, octaves, the ancient touching devotions, also processions, vespers, and similar ceremonies, were done away with." Numerous churches and chapels were closed and put to secular uses; the greater part of the old religious foundations and monasteries were suppressed as early as 1784.

Nevertheless there could be no durable peace with the bureaucratic civil authorities, and Bishop [[Ernest Johann Nepomuk von Herberstein]] was repeatedly obliged to complain to the emperor of the tutelage in which the Church was kept, but the complaints bore little fruit.

Catholic historians claimed that there was an alliance between Joseph and anti-clerical Freemasons.&lt;ref group=lower-alpha&gt;"In Germany and Austria, Freemasonry during the eighteenth century was a powerful ally of the so-called 'party of Enlightenment' (Aufklaerung), and of Josephinism" {{harv|Gruber|1909}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unity of power, the Hungarian Crown lands, and the Austrian Netherlands==

The pace of reform in Joseph's empire was uneven, especially in the crownlands of Hungary. Joseph was reluctant to include Hungary in most of his reforms early in his reign.

In 1784, Joseph brought the Hungarian Crown of St. Stephen from Pressburg, capital of Royal Hungary, to Vienna. Similarly, he brought the Bohemian [[Crown of Saint Wenceslas]] to Vienna. These were symbolic acts, meant to emphasize a new unity between the Habsburg crownlands, wherein they were to be seen as a singular entity{{sfn|Blanning|1994}}. 
German replaced Latin as the official language of administration in Hungary.{{sfn|Kann|1974|p=185}} In 1785, Joseph extended his abolition of serfdom to Hungary, and a census of [[the Crown]] land was ordered, in order to prepare it for an Austrian-style military draft.{{sfn|Okey|2002|p=46}}

In 1787, the "administrative streamlining" that had been applied to the rest of the Empire was nominally applied to Austrian possessions in the Netherlands, but this was fiercely opposed by Belgian nobles, and would be a major contribution to the [[Brabant Revolution]].{{sfn|Berenger|1990|p=105}}

==Domestic resistance==

Josephinism made many enemies inside the empire—from disaffected ecclesiastical authorities to noblemen. By the later years of his reign, disaffection with his sometimes radical policies was at a high, especially in the Austrian Netherlands and Hungary. Popular revolts and protests—led by nobles, seminary students, writers, and agents of Prussian King [[Frederick William II of Prussia|Frederick William]]—stirred throughout the Empire, prompting Joseph to tighten censorship of the press.{{sfn|Ingrao|2000|p=208–209}}

Before his death in 1790, Joseph was forced to rescind many of his administrative reforms. He returned the crown of St. Stephen to Buda in Hungary and promised to abide by the Hungarian constitution. Before he could actually be officially crowned "King of Hungary", he died at the age of 49.{{sfn|Ingrao|2000|p=208–209}}

Joseph's brother and successor, Leopold II, reversed the course of the Empire by rescinding some Josephine reforms, but managed to preserve the unity of the Habsburg lands by showing a respect and sensitivity for local demands that Joseph lacked.{{sfn|Ingrao|2000|p=209–211}}

C. Dunn Biography"].&lt;/ref&gt;  Later work with other [[model organism]]s continued to contribute to developmental genetics.&lt;ref name="amphilsoc" /&gt;  Dunn was also an activist, helping fellow scientists seek asylum during World War II, and a critic of [[eugenics]] movements.&lt;ref name="amphilsoc" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gormley"&gt;Melinda Gormley, [http://ir.library.oregonstate.edu/xmlui/bitstream/handle/1957/3786/PhD?sequence=1 "Geneticist L.C. Dunn: Politics, Activism, and Community"] (2006 dissertation, [[Oregon State University]]).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Dunn was born in [[Buffalo, New York]], in 1893, to Clarence Leslie Dunn and Mary Eliza Booth Dunn.&lt;ref name="dobzhansky"&gt;Theodosius Dobzhansky, [http://www.nasonline.org/publications/biographical-memoirs/memoir-pdfs/dunn-leslie.pdf ''Leslie Clarence Dunn, 1893-1974: A Biographical Memoir''] (National Academy of Sciences 1978)&lt;/ref&gt; He earned a bachelor's degree from [[Dartmouth College]] in 1915.&lt;ref name="dobzhansky" /&gt;

Dunn served in the [[Harvard Regiment]] in France during [[World War I]], and after the war, returned to [[Harvard University]] to complete his degree in 1920.&lt;ref name="gormley" /&gt; After the war, he identified as a pacifist.&lt;ref name="gormley" /&gt;  He worked from 1920 - 1928 as a poultry geneticist at an [[Agricultural Experiment Station]] in [[Storrs, Connecticut]], publishing almost fifty papers during this time.&lt;ref name="dobzhansky" /&gt;

Dunn, along with colleague [[E. W. Sinnott]], was the author of one of the foremost early genetics texts, ''Principles of Genetics'' (first published in 1925).&lt;ref name="dobzhansky" /&gt;

In 1928 Dunn was invited to join [[Columbia University]] as a full professor in the Zoology Department.&lt;ref name="dobzhansky" /&gt; While there, he was renowned for his teaching, and influenced numerous students, included "outstanding" developmental biologists [[Salome Gluecksohn-Waelsch]] and [[Dorothea Bennett]].&lt;ref name="dobzhansky" /&gt;

Dunn was married to Louise Porter, a [[Smith College]] graduate, and the couple had two children, Robert Leslie Dunn (b. 1921) and Stephen Porter Dunn (b. 1928).&lt;ref name="gormley" /&gt;  Dunn and his family loved literature and poetry, as did Dunn's mother,&lt;ref name="dobzhansky" /&gt; and established a press (Coalbin Press) to publish occasional volumes of poetry.&lt;ref name="gormley" /&gt; The younger son, [[Stephen Porter Dunn|Stephen]], was a [[social anthropologist]] and writer, publishing books such as ''The Peasants of Central Russia'' (1967) and ''Introduction to Soviet Ethnography'' (1974) (with his wife Ethel Deikman Dunn), ''Cultural Processes in the Baltic Area Under Soviet Rule'' (1966), and edited, translated, and taught.&lt;ref name="gormley" /&gt;

He died on March 19, 1974 at [[Phelps Memorial Hospital]] in [[Sleepy Hollow, New York|North Tarrytown, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=[[Alden Whitman]] |coauthors= |title=Leslie C.

A '''''libelle''''' is a political [[pamphlet]] or book which slanders a public figure.&lt;ref&gt;In late Middle English and Early Modern English, ''libelle'' retained its aboriginal significance of a "little book": ''[[Libelle of Englyshe Polycye|The Libelle of Englyshe Polycye]]'' (1435–38), for example,  was a little poetical tract concerning England's maritime power, with nothing [[libel]]lous in its content.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Libelles'' held particular significance in [[France]] under the [[Ancien Régime]], especially during the eighteenth century, when the pamphlets’ attacks on the monarchy became both more numerous and venomous. In recent years, cultural historian [[Robert Darnton]] has written on the ''libelles'', arguing for the subversive power that the ''libelles'' of the late eighteenth century exercised in undermining monarchical authority.

==Etymology==
The word ''libelle'' is derived from the Latin ''libellus'', for “small book.”&lt;ref name="Darnton 1995, p.199"&gt;Darnton 1995, p.199.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although originally it was used to describe pamphlets in general, it became primarily applicable to the genre of brief and defamatory attacks on pre-revolutionary French public figures. The 1762 edition of the dictionary published by the [[Académie française]] defines ''libelle'' as an “offensive work.”&lt;ref name="Darnton 1995, p.199"/&gt;  The publishers of ''libelles'' were known as ''libellistes''.

==Format and style==
''Libelles'' varied widely in format and style. Early ''libelles'' consisted of either a half-sheet or a single sheet in [[octavo (book)|octavo]] format.&lt;ref name="Darnton 1995, p.204"&gt;Darnton 1995, p.204.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some later ''libelles'', published in the eighteenth-century for example, were book-length, or even ran into multiple volumes. Regardless of their format, the ''libelles'' were cohesive in their overblown and sensationalist style; they were full of wordplay, and often employed literary techniques such as [[metaphor]].&lt;ref&gt;Darnton and Roche 1989, p.167.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''libelles'' were defiant of authority, and spoke out against prominent individuals.&lt;ref&gt;Darnton 1995, p.216.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
''Libelles'' were invariably of a political nature, both slanderous and subversive. They proliferated during times of political crises, from the sixteenth to eighteenth centuries.&lt;ref name="Darnton 1995, p.199"/&gt;

===Religious conflict: the 1580s===
In the 1580s, during the [[French Wars of Religion]], ''libelles'' flourished, with an average of about one ''occasionnel'' published per day in Paris.&lt;ref name="Darnton 1995, p.204"/&gt;  ''Libelles'' were published in support of both the Catholic and the Protestant points of view. Catholic ''libelles'' were typically pointed at the King, attacking his character, primarily his weak religious beliefs, and portraying him as not only godless, but evil. The Protestant ''libelles'' accused the [[Catholic League (French)|Catholic League]] of treasonously supporting the pope.&lt;ref name="Darnton 1995, p.204"/&gt;

===La Fronde: 1648–1653===
During the civil war known as the [[Fronde]], ''libelles'' proliferated in France, numbering around 5,000 in the years 1648–1653.&lt;ref&gt;Darnton 1995, p.206.&lt;/ref&gt;  During the Fronde, the majority of ''libelles'' were directed against [[Cardinal Mazarin]], the chief minister of France. These ''libelles'' were referred to as ''Mazarinades''. They ridiculed Mazarin for a wide variety of things, including his low birth, his luxurious proclivities and speculated on his erotic liaison with the Queen Mother, [[Anne of Austria]].&lt;ref name="Darnton 1995, p.207"&gt;Darnton 1995, p.207.&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the most famous of these characterized Mazarin as follows:
{{Quote|Buggering bugger, buggered bugger,&lt;br /&gt;
Bugger to the supreme degree,&lt;br /&gt;
Hairy bugger and feathered bugger,&lt;br /&gt;
Bugger in large and small volume,&lt;br /&gt;
Bugger sodomizing the State,&lt;br /&gt;
And bugger of the purest mixture…|[[Paul Scarron]]|''La Mazarinade (1651)''&lt;ref name="Darnton 1995, p.207"/&gt;
}}
These ''libelles'' excited concerns on the part of the government. Presumably alarmed by the seditious possibilities of the ''libelles'', the [[Parlement of Paris]] issued an ordinance against ''libellistes'', declaring that anyone caught producing such pamphlets would be hanged.&lt;ref name="Darnton 1995, p.200"&gt;Darnton 1995, p.200.&lt;/ref&gt;  This ran the business of ''libelles'' underground, and many ''libellistes'' relocated to [[Holland]]—or affected to on the title pages; there they continued to publish their slander.&lt;ref name="Darnton 1995, p.200"/&gt;

===Pre-Revolution: 1770s–1780s===
&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:Antoinette-harpy.gif|frame|right|Marie Antoinette portrayed as a harpy in a ''libelle''. 1791.]] --&gt;
Perhaps the most numerous and scathing ''libelles'' came out of the two decades prior to the [[French Revolution]]. [[Robert Darnton|Darnton]] lists five ways in which the ''libelles'' of the 1770s and 1780s differed from their ancestors.
First, the later ''libelles'' differed in their scale. Eighteenth-century ''libelles'' were much heftier volumes than their single (or half) sheet predecessors. Some ''libelles'' of this period ran as large as thirty-six volumes.&lt;ref name="Darnton 1995, p.212"&gt;Darnton 1995, p.212.&lt;/ref&gt;  The fact that such pamphlets were beginning to be compiled into books increased the longevity of the ''libelles''.
Second, the system which distributed the ''libelles'' had changed. The publishing industry which circulated eighteenth-century ''libelles'' was increasingly vast, and no longer localized.&lt;ref name="Darnton 1995, p.212"/&gt; 
Third, the way in which the ''libelles'' attacked public figures had advanced. In eighteenth-century ''libelles'', the sex lives of the public figures who were attacked were contextualized as contemporary history.&lt;ref name="Darnton 1995, p.212"/&gt;
Fourth, the way that ''libelles'' conceptualized their victims had changed. Even when earlier ''libelles'' attacked [[Louis XIV]], a sense of respect and even deference was implied in the writings. By the 1770s, the way that the ''libelles'' conceptualized [[Louis XV]] was much less respectful, and implied that the monarch was a mere womanizer, with no interest in state affairs.&lt;ref name="Darnton 1995, p.213"&gt;Darnton 1995, p.213.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Marie Antoinette]] fared even worse, as the number of pornographic libelles that involved her proliferated into the revolutionary era.&lt;ref&gt;Darnton 1995, p.226.&lt;/ref&gt;
Fifth, later ''libelles'' seemed to criticize monarchy as a system, whereas early ''libelles'' only attacked individual figures. It was implied in the earlier pamphlets that individual figures, such as Mazarin, were responsible for the State’s problems. With the ''libelles'' of the later years, however, the attack was focused against the entire governmental system, and monarchy as a whole.&lt;ref name="Darnton 1995, p.213"/&gt;

'''Marilena de Souza Chaui''' (born September 4, 1941) is a [[Brazil]]ian [[philosopher]] and Professor of Modern Philosophy in the [[University of São Paulo]]. She is a scholar of [[Baruch Spinoza]] and [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]]. Chaui is one of the founding members of [[Workers' Party (Brazil)|Workers' Party]] and assiduous criticism of the [[Capitalism|capitalist model]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rodrigues|first1=Fania|title=Marilena Chauí: "Universidades devem entender que fazem parte da luta de classes"|url=https://www.brasildefato.com.br/2017/04/04/marilena-chaui-universidades-devem-entender-que-fazem-parte-da-luta-de-classe/|website=Brasil de Fato|accessdate=29 July 2017|location=Rio de Janeiro|language=Portuguese|date=4 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Chaui is a Professor of [[Political philosophy|Political Philosophy]] and History of [[Modern philosophy|Modern Philosophy]] in the [[University of São Paulo]], having been awarded a master's degree in 1967, and received her [[doctorate]] in 1971 with the essay "Introduction to Reading Spinoza", under the guidance of Professor [[Gilda de Mello e Souza Rocha]]. In 1977, she taught [[Philosophy]] in the University of São Paulo.&lt;ref name=cvlist&gt;[http://filosofia.fflch.usp.br/docentes/chaui Marilena de Souza Chauí], usp.br, Retrieved 4 September 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Her book ''[[What is Ideology?]]'' was selected by the [[Ministry of Education and Culture]] of Brazil as a mandatory textbook in public schools, becoming a bestseller with over a hundred thousand copies sold. Chaui had served as Municipal [[Secretary of Culture]] of São Paulo, from 1989 to 1992, during the administration of [[Luiza Erundina]] (1988-1992). In 2013, during the release of the book "10 Years of Post-Liberal Government in Brasil: Lula and Dilma", Marilena received a negative reception when during her speech she stated that : "It's because I hate the middle class. The middle class is a delay of life. The middle class is stupidity. It is what we have as the most reactionary, conservative, ignorant, cocky, arrogant, terrorist... The middle class is a political abomination, because it is fascist. It is an ethical abomination because it is violent. It is a cognitive abomination..." 

She has been accused by some as inciting hatred and using several derogatory terms against a portion of the population, particularly the middle class as being too reactionary, while praising the current president [[Dilma Rousseff]] and [[Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva]] and populist criticisms against the Brazilian middle-class.

==Family==
Chaui is the daughter of the journalist [[Nicholas Alberto Chaui]], of Arabic origin, and teacher [[Laura de Souza Chaui]]. She was married to the journalist [[José Augusto de Mattos Berlinck]], with whom she had two sons - José Guilherme and Luciana. She is currently married to Michael Hall, a [[historian]] and professor at the [[UNICAMP|State University of Campinas]].

[[File:Láminas 8 y 9 del Códice de Dresden.jpg|thumb|300px|plates 10 and 11 of the Dresden Maya Codex. Drawing by Lacambalam, 2001]]

'''Maya codices''' (singular ''[[codex]]'') are folding [[book]]s written by the [[Pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian]] [[Maya civilization]] in [[Maya hieroglyphics|Maya hieroglyphic script]] on Mesoamerican [[Amate|bark paper]]. The folding books are the products of professional scribes working under the patronage of deities such as the [[Tonsured Maize God]] and the [[Howler Monkey Gods]]. Most of the codices were destroyed by conquistadors and Catholic priests in the 16th century. The codices have been named for the cities where they eventually settled. The [[Dresden codex]] is generally considered the most important of the few that survive.

The paper was made from the inner bark of certain trees, the main being the wild fig tree or ''[[amate]]'' (''[[Ficus insipida|Ficus glabrata]]''). This sort of paper was generally known by the word ''[[amatl|āmatl]]''  {{IPA-nah|ˈaːmat͡ɬ|}} in [[Nahuatl]], and by the word ''huun'' in [[Mayan Languages|Mayan]]. The Maya developed their ''huun''-paper around the 5th century,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Burns |first1=Marna |title=The Complete Book of Handcrafted Paper |date=2004 |publisher=Dover Publications |isbn=9780486435442 |page=199}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is roughly the same time that the codex became predominant over the scroll in the Roman world. Maya paper was more durable and a better writing surface than [[papyrus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wiedemann |first1=Hans G. |last2=Brzezinka |first2=Klaus-Werner |last3=Witke |first3=Klaus |last4=Lamprecht |first4=Ingolf  |lastauthoramp=yes|title=Thermal and Raman-spectroscopic analysis of Maya Blue carrying artefacts, especially fragment IV of the Codex Huamantla |journal=Thermochimica Acta |date=May 2007 |volume=456 |issue=1 |pages=56–63 |doi=10.1016/j.tca.2007.02.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
There were many books in existence at the time of the [[Spanish conquest of Yucatán]] in the 16th century; most were destroyed by the Catholic [[priests]].&lt;ref name="Foster"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Foster |first1=Lynn V. |title=Handbook to Life in the Ancient Maya World |date=2002 |publisher=Facts On File |location=New York |isbn=0816041482 |page=297}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many in [[Yucatán (state)|Yucatán]] were ordered destroyed by [[Diego de Landa|Bishop Diego de Landa]] in July 1562.&lt;ref&gt;Diego de Landa) William Gates, translator, (1937) 1978. ''Yucatan Before and After the Conquest''. An English translation of Landa's ''Relación'' [https://web.archive.org/web/20170323233025/https://www.globalgreyebooks.com/books/yucatan-before-and-after-the-conquest.pdf Retrieved 22 Mar 2017]&lt;/ref&gt; In his conviction of the superiority and absolute truth of Christianity, De Landa wrote: &lt;blockquote&gt;We found a large number of books in these characters and, as they contained nothing in which were not to be seen as superstition and lies of the devil, we burned them all, which they regretted to an amazing degree, and which caused them much affliction.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Such codices were the primary written records of Maya civilization, together with the many [[inscription]]s on stone [[monument]]s and [[stela]]e that survived. Their range of subject matter in all likelihood embraced more topics than those recorded in stone and buildings, and was more like what is found on painted ceramics (the so-called 'ceramic codex'). Alonso de Zorita wrote that in 1540 he saw numerous such books in the [[Guatemala]]n highlands that "recorded their history for more than eight hundred years back, and that were interpreted for me by very ancient Indians" (Zorita 1963, 271-2).

Dominican friar [[Bartolomé de las Casas]] lamented that when found, such books were destroyed: "These books were seen by our clergy, and even I saw part of those that were burned by the monks, apparently because they thought [they] might harm the Indians in matters concerning religion, since at that time they were at the beginning of their conversion." The last codices destroyed were those of [[Nojpetén]], Guatemala in 1697, the last city conquered in the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.authenticmaya.com/maya_writing.htm Maya writing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070613162647/http://www.authenticmaya.com/maya_writing.htm |date=2007-06-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  With their destruction, access to the history of the Maya and opportunity for insight into some key areas of Maya life was greatly diminished.

There are only three codices whose authenticity is beyond doubt. These are:

A fourth codex that remained controversial until 2015 has been authenticated. Recent research, which includes a study that used everything from X-rays to UV imaging and microscopic analysis, points to its authenticity.

== Dresden Codex==
{{Main|Dresden Codex}}

The '''Dresden Codex''' (''Codex Dresdensis'') is held in the [[Sächsische Landesbibliothek]] (SLUB), the state library in [[Dresden]], Germany. It is the most elaborate of the codices, and also a highly important specimen of [[Maya art]]. Many sections are ritualistic (including so-called 'almanacs'), others are of an [[astrological]] nature ([[eclipse]]s, the [[Transits of Venus|Venus cycles]]). The codex is written on a long sheet of paper that is 'screen-folded' to make a book of 39 leaves, written on both sides. It was probably written between the twelfth and fourteenth centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Ruggles|first=Clive L. N.|title=Ancient Astronomy: An Encyclopedia of Cosmologies and Myth|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q9YYqiXm-lkC|year=2005|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-85109-477-6|page=134}}&lt;/ref&gt; Somehow it made its way to Europe and was bought by the royal library of the court of Saxony in Dresden in 1739. The only exact replica, including the ''huun'', made by a German artist is displayed at the ''Museo Nacional de Arqueología'' in [[Guatemala]] City, since October, 2007.

Exactly how the Dresden Codex ended up in Europe is not clear.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vail|first=Gabrielle|date=2015|title=Astronomy in the Dresden Codex|url=https://link-springer-com.ezproxy.lib.usf.edu/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-1-4614-6141-8_65.pdf|journal=Handbook of Archaeastronomy and Ethnoastronomy|volume=|pages=1-14|via=Springer Link}}&lt;/ref&gt; It arrived sometime in the late 18&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Century, potentially from the first or second generation of Spanish conquerors.  Even though the last date entry in the book is from several centuries before its relocation, the book was likely used and added to until just before the conquerors took it. 

About 65% of the pages in the Dresden Codex contain richly illustrated astronomical tables. These tables focus on eclipses, equinoxes and solstices, the sidreal cycle of Mars, and the synodic cycles of Mars and Venus. These observations allowed the Mayans to plant the calendar year, agriculture, and religious ceremonies around the stars.  In the text, Mars is represented by a long nosed deer, and Venus is represented by a star. 

Pages 51-58 are eclipse tables. These tables accurately predicted solar eclipses for 33 years in the 8&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Century, though the predictions of lunar eclipses were far less successful. Icons of serpents devouring the sun symbolize eclipses throughout the book. The glyphs show roughly 40 times in the text, making eclipses a major focus of the Dresden Codex. 

The first 52 pages of the Dresden Codex are about divination. The Mayan astronomers would use the codex for day keeping, but also determining the cause of sickness and other misfortunes. 

Though a wide variety of gods and goddesses appear in the Dresden Codex, the Moon Goddess is the only neutral figure&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barnhart|first=Edwin|date=Fall 2005|title="The First Twenty-Three Pages of the Dresden Codex: The Divination Pages"|url=|journal=https://www.mayaexploration.org/pdf/DresdenCodex1-23.pdf|volume=|pages=1-145|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In the first 23 pages of the book, she is mentioned far more than any other god. 

Between 1880 and 1900, Dresden librarian [[Ernst Förstemann]] succeeded in deciphering the [[Maya numerals]] and the [[Maya calendar]] and realized that the codex is an [[ephemeris]].&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Förstemann, ''Commentary on the Maya Manuscript in the Royal  Public Library of Dresden'', Peabody Museum of American Archaeology and Ethnology, Harvard University Vol. IV &amp;#x2014; No.2, Cambridge Mass. 1902&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent studies have decoded these astronomical almanacs, which include records of the cycles of the Sun and Moon, including eclipse tables, and all of the naked-eye planets.&lt;ref&gt;John Eric Sidney Thompson, ''A commentary on the Dresden Codex: A Maya Hieroglyphic Book'', Memoirs of the American Philosophical Society, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; The "Serpent Series",  pp.&amp;nbsp;61–69, is an [[ephemeris]] of these phenomena that uses a base date of 1.18.1.8.0.16 in the prior era (5,482,096 days).&lt;ref&gt;Beyer, Hermann 1933 Emendations of the 'Serpent Numbers' of the Dresden Maya Codex.

== Madrid Codex ==
{{Main|Madrid Codex (Maya)}}
[[File:Madrid Codex 6.JPG|thumb|right|Rain-bringing snakes, Madrid Codex]]
The Codex was discovered in Spain in the 1860s; it was divided into two parts of differing sizes that were found in different locations.&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p127"&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 127.&lt;/ref&gt; The Codex receives its alternate name of the Tro-Cortesianus Codex after the two parts that were separately discovered.&lt;ref name="FAMSI"&gt;FAMSI.&lt;/ref&gt; Ownership of the Troano Codex passed to the [[National Archaeological Museum of Spain|Museo Arqueológico Nacional]] ("National Archaeological Museum") in 1888.&lt;ref name="Noguez&amp;c09p20"&gt;Noguez et al. 2009, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; The Museo Arqueológico Nacional acquired the Cortesianus Codex from a book-collector in 1872, who claimed to have recently purchased the codex in [[Extremadura]].&lt;ref&gt;Noguez et al. 2009, pp. 20–21.&lt;/ref&gt; Extremadura is the province from which [[Francisco de Montejo]] and many of his [[conquistador]]s came,&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p127"/&gt; as did [[Hernán Cortés]], the conqueror of Mexico.&lt;ref name="Noguez&amp;c09p21"&gt;Noguez et al. 2009, p.21.&lt;/ref&gt; It is therefore possible that one of these conquistadors brought the codex back to Spain;&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p127"/&gt; the director of the Museo Arqueológico Nacional named the Cortesianus Codex after Hernán Cortés, supposing that he himself had brought the codex back.&lt;ref name="Noguez&amp;c09p21"/&gt;

The Madrid Codex is the longest of the surviving Maya codices.&lt;ref name="Noguez&amp;c09p20"/&gt; The content of the Madrid Codex mainly consists of almanacs and horoscopes that were used to help [[Maya priesthood|Maya priests]] in the performance of their ceremonies and divinatory rituals. The codex also contains astronomical tables, although less than are found in the other two generally accepted surviving Maya codices.&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p127"/&gt; A close analysis of glyphic elements suggests that a number of scribes were involved in its production, perhaps as many as eight or nine, who produced consecutive sections of the manuscript; the scribes were likely to have been members of the priesthood.&lt;ref&gt;Ciudad et al. 1999, pp. 877, 879.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars, such as [[Michael Coe]] and Justin Kerr,&lt;ref&gt;Miller 1999, p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt; have suggested that the Madrid Codex dates to after the [[Spanish conquest of Yucatán|Spanish conquest]] but the evidence overwhelmingly favours a pre-conquest date for the document. It is likely that the codex was produced in [[Yucatán (state)|Yucatán]].&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p127"/&gt; [[J. Eric S. Thompson|J.&amp;nbsp;Eric Thompson]] was of the opinion that the Madrid Codex came from western Yucatán and dated to between 1250 and 1450 AD. Other scholars have expressed a differing opinion, noting that the codex is similar in style to murals found at [[Chichen Itza]], [[Mayapan]] and sites on the east coast such as Santa Rita, [[Tancah]] and [[Tulum]].&lt;ref name="SharerTraxler06p129"&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt; Two paper fragments incorporated into the front and last pages of the codex contain Spanish writing, which led Thompson to suggest that a Spanish priest acquired the document at [[Nojpetén|Tayasal]] in Petén.&lt;ref&gt;Coe 1999, p. 200. Ciudad et al. 1999, p. 880.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Paris Codex==
{{Main|Paris Codex}}
[[File:Paris Codex, pages 23-24.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Paris Codex]]
The '''Paris Codex''' (also or formerly the '''Codex Peresianus''') contains prophecies for tuns and katuns (see [[Maya Calendar]]), as well as a Maya zodiac, and is thus, in both respects, akin to the Books of [[Chilam Balam]]. The codex first appeared in 1832 as an acquisition of France's ''Bibliothèque Impériale'' (later the [[Bibliothèque Nationale]], or National Library) in [[Paris]]. Three years later the first reproduction drawing of it was prepared for [[Lord Kingsborough]], by his [[Lombardy|Lombardian]] artist [[Agostino Aglio]]. The original drawing is now lost, but a copy survives among some of Kingsborough's unpublished [[galley proof|proof sheet]]s, held in collection at the [[Newberry Library]], [[Chicago]].&lt;ref&gt;See [http://www.famsi.org/mayawriting/codices/paris.html "The Paris Codex"], in Marhenke (2003), {{page needed|date=September 2012}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although occasionally referred to over the next quarter-century, its permanent rediscovery is attributed to the French orientalist [[Léon de Rosny]], who in 1859 recovered the codex from a basket of old papers sequestered in a chimney corner at the [[Bibliothèque Nationale]]  where it had lain discarded and apparently forgotten.&lt;ref&gt;Coe (1992, p.101), Sharer &amp; Traxler (2006, p.127)&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, it is in very poor condition. It was found wrapped in a paper with the word ''Pérez'' written on it, possibly a reference to the Jose Pérez who had published two brief descriptions of the then-anonymous codex in 1859.&lt;ref name="Stuart 1992, p.20"&gt;Stuart (1992, p.20)&lt;/ref&gt; De Rosny initially gave it the name ''Codex Peresianus'' ("Codex Pérez") after its identifying wrapper, but in due course the codex would be more generally known as the Paris Codex.&lt;ref name="Stuart 1992, p.20"/&gt; De Rosny published a facsimile edition of the codex in 1864.&lt;ref&gt;Coe (1992, p.101)&lt;/ref&gt; It remains in the possession of the [[Bibliothèque Nationale]].

==Grolier Codex==
{{Main|Grolier Codex}}
[[File:Grolier Codex 4822fw (2).jpg|thumb|right|Page 6 of the ''Grolier Codex'', depicting a death god with captive]]
While the three codices above were known to scholars since the 19th century, the Grolier Codex only surfaced in the 1970s. The codex, said to have been found in a cave, is really a fragment of 11 pages. As of 2016 it is in Mexico City’s Museo Nacional de Antropología,&lt;ref name="Smithsonian 2016" /&gt; not on display. Each page shows a hero or god, facing to the left. At the top of each page is a number, and down the left of each page is what appears to be a list of dates. The pages are much less detailed than in the other codices, and hardly provide any information that is not already in the Dresden Codex. 

After a study was conducted which includes everything from X-rays to UV imaging and microscopic analysis, in 2016 the authenticity of the Grolier Codex was announced.&lt;ref name="Smithsonian 2016" /&gt;

== Other Maya codices ==
Given the rarity and importance of these books, rumors of finding new ones often develop interest. [[Archaeology|Archaeological]] excavations of Maya sites have turned up a number of rectangular lumps of plaster and paint flakes, most commonly in elite tombs. These lumps are the remains of codices where all the organic material has rotted away. A few of the more coherent of these lumps have been preserved, with the slim hope that some technique to be developed by future generations of archaeologists may be able to recover some information from these remains of ancient pages. The oldest Maya codices known have been found by archaeologists as mortuary offerings with burials in excavations in [[Uaxactun]], [[Guaytán]] in  San Agustín Acasaguastlán, and Nebaj in [[Quiché Department|El Quiché]], [[Guatemala]], at [[Altun Ha]] in [[Belize]] and at [[Copán]] in [[Honduras]]. The six examples of Maya books discovered in excavations date to the Early Classic (Uaxactún and Altun Ha), Late Classic (Nebaj, Copán), and Early Postclassic (Guaytán) periods. Unfortunately, all of them have degraded into unopenable masses or collections of very small flakes and bits of the original texts. Thus it may never be possible to read them.&lt;ref&gt;Whiting 1998: 207–208&lt;/ref&gt;

==Forgeries==
Since the start of the 20th century, [[forgery|forgeries]] of varying quality have been produced. Two elaborate early 20th-century forged codices were in the collection of [[William Randolph Hearst]]. Although fake codices have seldom fooled serious scholars, the [[Grolier Codex]] may be an exception. Its paper seems to be ancient, and the influential Mayanist [[Michael D. Coe]] believed the artifact to be genuine, followed in this by Stephen Houston and Karl Taube (all three scholars stemming from Yale); but other eminent Mayanists such as [[J.E.S. Thompson]],&lt;ref&gt;Thompson 1975: 1-9; 1976: 64-75&lt;/ref&gt; [[Claude Baudez]],&lt;ref&gt;Baudez 2002: 70-79, 98-102&lt;/ref&gt; and Susan Milbrath&lt;ref&gt;Milbrath 2002: 50-83&lt;/ref&gt; concluded that its pictures and glyphs are falsifications. They pointed out a long series of inconsistencies and errors in the alleged codex, and drew attention to its art historical improbability and its uselessness for astrological and divinatory purposes.&lt;ref&gt;For a succinct account, see Kelker &amp; Bruhns 2010: 95-104&lt;/ref&gt; Although their arguments were never effectively countered, no scholarly unanimity has been reached. In September 2016 Coe and other researchers published findings supporting its authenticity;&lt;ref name="newitz ars technica"&gt;Annalee Newitz (12 September 2016). "[https://arstechnica.com/science/2016/09/confirmed-mysterious-ancient-maya-book-grolier-codex-is-genuine/ Confirmed: Mysterious ancient Maya book, Grolier Codex, is genuine: 900 year-old astronomy guide is oldest known book written in the Americas]." ''[http://arstechnica.co.uk/ Ars Technica]''. Accessed 12 September 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; but in an extensive rejoinder (August 2017), Bruce Love &lt;ref&gt;Love 2017&lt;/ref&gt; concluded that the artefact's authenticity had not been established.

'''Melvin Miller Rader''' (8 November 1903 – 14 June 1981) was an author and professor of philosophy at the [[University of Washington]] for 51 years, and an outspoken advocate of civil rights. He taught [[ethics]], [[aesthetics]] and [[political philosophy]]. In 1948, he was accused of being a [[Communism|communist]] by the [[Canwell Committee]] (the Joint Legislative Fact Finding Committee on [[House Un-American Activities Committee|Un-American Activities]]), and was later exonerated in 1951 by [[List of Attorneys General of Washington|Attorney General, Smith Troy]]. [[Ed Guthman]], a [[The Seattle Times|Seattle Times]] investigative reporter, received a [[Pulitzer Prize]] for his reporting of the events. In 2009, an endowment fund was created in Rader's name at the [[University of washington|University of Washington]] to fund philosophy students engaged in social justice work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phil.washington.edu/enews/fall2010/enewsfall2010rader.htm University of Washington, Philosophy Department, webpage.]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3883">'''Abu Abd Allah Muhammad ibn Abi Bakr ibn Muhammad Tabrizi''' was a thirteenth-century [[Persian people|Persian]] Muslim writer, known for his Arabic commentary on the twenty five propositions at the beginning of Book II of the Jewish philosopher [[Maimonides]]'s ''[[Guide for the Perplexed]]'', on which Maimonides then based his proof of the [[existence of God|existence]], [[Divine simplicity|unity]] and [[incorporeality]] of God.  The propositions, derived from [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'' and ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'', were merely summarised by Maimonides; Tabrizi gives a detailed discussion of them, based on the work of Arabic authors.  It is the earliest known commentary on a part of the ''Guide''.&lt;ref&gt;Remark in [[Colette Sirat]], [[Nicholas de Lange]] (2002), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=4PRn_bCaFVIC&amp;pg=PA284 Hebrew manuscripts of the Middle Ages]'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0-521-77079-3}}. p. 284&lt;/ref&gt;

Tabrizi's book was later translated into a strongly Arabicised Hebrew by [[Isaac ben Nathan of Cordoba]].  This translation formed the main basis of [[Hasdai Crescas]]'s review in ''[[Or Adonai]]'' of the various demonstrations proposed for Maimonides's principles, prior to his embarking on a thorough critique of their inadequacies; it was also used by [[Moses ben Joshua|Moses ben Joshua of Narbonne]].  The translation was probably made in Majorca around 1347; it was printed in Ferrara in 1556.  A second translation, into a more native idiomatic Hebrew, also exists in manuscript. (Paris, Bibliothèque Nationale, cod. héb., 974).

Tabrizi evidently thought highly of Maimonides.  His book concludes ''"The author of these Propositions is the chief whose sceptre is "wisdom" and whose throne is "understanding," the Israelite prince, that has benefited his nation and all those who love God, etc. Moses ben Maimon ben Ebed-elohim, the Israelite... May God lead us to the truth. Amen!"''&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in [[Michael Friedländer]] (1904), ''[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/maimonides/guide.iv.ii.html The Guide for the Perplexed by Moses Maimonides]'' (2e)&lt;/ref&gt;  A remark in the introduction to the commentary suggests that Tabrizi intended to prepare a commentary on the whole ''Guide''.&lt;ref&gt;Remark in [[Colette Sirat]] (1990), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=9DRAGy9PnSoC&amp;pg=PA208 A History of Jewish Philosophy in the Middle Ages]'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press.  {{ISBN|0-521-39727-8}}.  p. 208&lt;/ref&gt; However, some suggest that he may not have had access to the ''Guide'' in its entirety: comments about Maimonides's view of the human soul are badly flawed.&lt;ref&gt;Remark in [[Herbert Alan Davidson]] (2005), ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=TbxFZk39h0cC&amp;pg=PA426 Moses Maimonides]'', Oxford: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-517321-X}}. p. 426&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12021">A '''non-science''' is an area of study that is not scientific, especially one that is not a natural science or a social science that is an object of [[scientific inquiry]].  In this model, [[history]], [[art]], and [[religion]] are all examples of non-sciences.&lt;ref name="Hansson"&gt;{{Cite book | url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2017/entries/pseudo-science/ | title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|author-last=Hansson | author-first=Sven Ove | chapter=Science and Pseudo-Science | date=2017 | publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University | editor-last=Zalta | editor-first=Edward N. | edition=Summer 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5udKAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA10|title=Concepts in Biology|last=Enger|first=Eldon|last2=Ross|first2=Frederick|last3=Bailey|first3=David|date=2014|publisher=McGraw-Hill Higher Education|year=|isbn=9780077418281|location=|pages=10|language=en|quote=Both scientists and nonscientists seek to gain information and improve understanding in their fields of study. The differences between science and nonscience are based on the assumptions and methods used to gather and organize information and, most important, the way the assumptions are tested. The difference between a scientist and a nonscientist is that a scientist continually challenges and tests principles and assumptions to determine cause-and-effect relationships. A nonscientist may not be able to do so or may not believe that this is important. For example, a historian may have the opinion that, if President Lincoln had not appointed Ulysses S. Grant to be a general in the Union Army, the Confederate States of America would have won the Civil War. Although there can be considerable  argument about the topic, there is no way that it can be tested. Therefore, such speculation about historical events is not scientific. This does not mean that history is not a respectable field of study, only that it is not science. Historians simply use the standards of critical thinking that are appropriate to their field of study and that can provide insights into the role military leadership plays in the outcome of conflicts.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Classifying knowledge ==
{{Main|Demarcation problem}}
Since the 17th century, some writers have used the word ''science'' to exclude some areas of studies, such as [[the arts]] and the [[Liberal arts education|liberal arts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|science|accessdate=2018-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The word ''nonscience'', to describe non-scientific academic disciplines, was first used in the middle of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite Merriam-Webster|Nonscience|accessdate=2018-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases, it can be difficult to identify exact boundaries between science and non-science.  The [[demarcation problem]] is the study of the difficulties in determining whether certain fields of study, near the boundaries of science and non-science, should be considered as one or the other.  No single test has yet been devised that can clearly separate science from non-science, but some factors, taken as a whole and evaluated over time, are commonly used.&lt;ref name="Nickles"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2017/entries/rationality-historicist/|title=Historicist Theories of Scientific Rationality|work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|last=Nickles|first=Thomas|date=2017|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|year=|isbn=|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Summer 2017|location=|pages=|quote=What demarcates science from nonscience and pseudoscience is sustained support (over historical time) of a puzzle-solving tradition, not the application of a nonexistent "scientific method" to determine whether the claims are true or false or probable to some degree.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the view of [[Thomas Kuhn]], these factors include the desire of scientists to investigate a question as if it were a puzzle.  Kuhn's view of science is also focused on the process of scientific inquiry, rather than the result.&lt;ref name="Nickles" /&gt;

[[Boundary-work]] is the process of advocating for a desired outcome in the process of classifying fields of study that are near the borders.  The rewards associated with winning a particular classification suggest that the boundary between science and non-science is [[socially constructed]] and [[Ideology|ideologically motivated]] rather than representing a stark natural difference between science and non-science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gieryn |first=Thomas F. |title=Boundary-work and the demarcation of science from non-science: strains and interests in professional ideologies of scientists |journal=American Sociological Review |volume=48 |year=1983 |issue=6 |pages=781–795 |doi=10.2307/2095325 |jstor=2095325}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The belief that scientific knowledge (e.g., biology) is more valuable than other forms of knowledge (e.g., ethics) is called ''[[scientism]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o-pGDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT19|title=Scientism: Science, Ethics and Religion: Science, Ethics and Religion|last=Stenmark|first=Mikael|date=2018-01-12|publisher=Routledge|year=|isbn=9781351815390|location=|pages=19–20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Areas of non-science ==
{{Seealso|Outline of academic disciplines#Humanities}}
Non-science includes all areas of study that are not science.&lt;ref name="Hansson" /&gt;  Non-science encompasses all of the [[humanities]], including:

* history,&lt;ref name="Hansson" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; including the [[history of science]],
* the [[language arts]], such as [[linguistics]], specific languages, and [[literature]], 
* [[philosophy]], ethics, and religion, and 
* art, including music, performing arts, fine arts, and [[Handicraft|crafts]].

The philosopher [[Martin Mahner]] proposed calling these academic fields the [[Parascience|''parasciences'']], to distinguish them from disreputable forms of non-science, such as [[pseudoscience]].&lt;ref name="Hansson" /&gt;

Non-sciences offer information about the [[meaning of life]], [[human values]], the [[human condition]], and ways of interacting with other people, including studies of [[Culture|cultures]], [[morality]] and [[ethics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://philosophynow.org/issues/96/Science_and_Non-Science|title=Science and Non-Science|last=Lazorko|first=Pamela|date=2013|website=Philosophy Now|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-17|volume=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UVJ3AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=178|title=Darwin's Gift: To Science and Religion|last=Ayala|first=Francisco|date=2007-05-07|publisher=Joseph Henry Press|year=|isbn=9780309661744|location=|pages=178|language=en|quote=Successful as it is, and universally encompassing as its subject is, a scientific view of the world is hopelessly incomplete. Matters of value and meaning are outside science's scope.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Areas of disagreement ==
[[File:Illustration of overlapping communities.svg|alt=diagram representing multiple connected and overlapping groups|thumb|Some philosophers see knowledge as the product of overlapping communities of knowledge.  Others try to find a sharp division between science and non-science.]]

Philosophers disagree about whether areas of study involving [[abstract concepts]], such as [[pure mathematics]], are scientific or non-scientific.&lt;ref&gt;Bishop, Alan (1997).[https://books.google.com/books?id=9AgrBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA54#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "Mathematical Enculturation: A Cultural Perspective on Mathematics Education."] Dordrecht: Kluwer Academic Publishers.  p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bunge 1998"&gt;{{cite book|url=|title=Philosophy of Science: Volume 1, From Problem to Theory|last1=Bunge|first1=Mario|date=1998|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-765-80413-1|edition=revised|series=|volume=1|location=New York, NY|pages=3–50|language=|chapter=The Scientific Approach|doi=|authorlink=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Interdisciplinarity|Interdisciplinary studies]] may cover knowledge-generating work that includes both scientific and non-scientific studies. [[Archaeology]] is an example of a field that borrows from both the natural sciences and history.&lt;ref name="Hansson" /&gt;

Fields of inquiry may change status over time.  For many centuries, [[alchemy]] was accepted as scientific:  it produced some useful information, and it supported experiments and open inquiry in the pursuit of understanding the physical world. Since the 20th century, it has been considered a pseudoscience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/alchemy-may-not-been-pseudoscience-we-thought-it-was-180949430/|title=Alchemy May Not Have Been the Pseudoscience We All Thought It Was|last=Conniff|first=Richard|date=February 2014|work=Smithsonian Magazine|access-date=2018-04-16|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dwFKDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA8|title=Pseudoscience: The Conspiracy Against Science|last=Hecht |first=David K.|chapter=Pseudoscience and the Pursuit of Truth |editor-last1=Kaufman|editor-first1=Allison B.|editor-last2=Kaufman|editor-first2=James C.|date=2018-01-05|publisher=MIT Press|year=|isbn=9780262037426|location=|pages=8–9|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Modern [[chemistry]], which developed out of alchemy, is considered a major natural science.

== Alternative systems ==
Some philosophers, such as [[Paul Feyerabend]], object to the effort to classify knowledge into science and non-science.&lt;ref name="Taylor1996"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NdkDiqh5ySYC&amp;pg=PA41|title=Defining Science: A Rhetoric of Demarcation|last=Taylor|first=C.A.|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|year=1996|isbn=9780299150341|series=Rhetoric of the Human Sciences Series|page=41|lccn=96000180}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The distinction is artificial, as there is little or nothing that ties together all of the bodies of knowledge that are called "sciences".&lt;ref name="Taylor1996" /&gt;

Some systems of organizing knowledge separate [[systematic knowledge]] from non-systematic methods of knowing or learning something, such as [[Personal experience|personal experiences]], [[intuition]], and [[innate knowledge]]. [[Wissenschaft]] is a broad concept that encompasses reliable knowledge without making a distinction between subject area.&lt;ref name="Hansson" /&gt;  The ''Wissenschaft'' concept is more useful than the distinction between science and non-science in distinguishing between knowledge and pseudo-knowledge, as the errors made in all forms of [[pseudo-scholarship]], from [[pseudohistory]] to [[pseudoscience]], are similar.&lt;ref name="Hansson" /&gt;  This ''Wissenschaft'' concept is used in the 2006 list of [[Fields of Science and Technology]] published by the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]], which defines "science and technology" as encompassing all humanistic disciplines, including religion and fine art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Revised Field of Science and Technology (FOS) Classification in the Frascati Manual {DSTI/EAS/STP/NESTI(2006)19/FINAL)|date=2007|url=http://www.oecd.org/science/innovationinsciencetechnologyandindustry/38235147.pdf|author=Working Party of National Experts on Science and Technology Indicators|place=|publisher=Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|language=English|format=PDF|accessdate=28 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Norbert Elias''' ({{IPA-de|eˈliːas|lang}}; 22 June 1897 &amp;ndash; 1 August 1990) was a German [[sociology|sociologist]] of Jewish descent, who later became a British citizen. He is especially famous for his theory of civilizing/decivilizing processes.

==Biography==
Elias was born on 22 June 1897 in [[Wrocław|Breslau (today: Wrocław)]] in [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]]'s [[Silesia Province]] to Hermann and Sophie Gallewski. His father was a businessman in the textile industry. After passing the [[abitur]] in 1915 he volunteered for the German army in [[World War I]] and was employed as a [[telegraphy|telegrapher]], first at the Eastern front, then at the Western front. After suffering a nervous breakdown in 1917, he was declared unfit for service and was posted to Breslau as a medical orderly. The same year, Elias began studying [[philosophy]], [[psychology]] and [[medicine]] at the [[University of Wrocław|University of Breslau]], in addition spending a term each at the universities of [[University of Heidelberg|Heidelberg]] (where he attended lectures by [[Karl Jaspers]]) and [[University of Freiburg|Freiburg]] in 1919 and 1920. He quit medicine in 1919 after passing the preliminary examination ''(Physikum)''. To finance his studies after his father's fortune had been reduced by [[Hyperinflation#The Weimar Inflation in Germany|hyperinflation]], he took up a job as the head of the export department in a local hardware factory 1922. In 1924, he graduated with a doctoral dissertation in philosophy entitled ''Idee und Individuum'' (''Idea and Individual'') supervised by [[Richard Hönigswald]], a representative of [[Neo-Kantianism]]. Disappointed about the absence of the social aspect from Neo-Kantianism, which had led to a serious dispute with his supervisor about his dissertation, Elias decided to turn to [[sociology]] for his further studies.

During his Breslau years, until 1925, Elias was deeply involved in the German [[Zionist movement]], and acted as one of the leading intellectuals within the German-Jewish youth movement "Blau-Weiss" (Blue-White). During these years he got acquainted with other young Zionists like [[Erich Fromm]], [[Leo Strauss]], [[Leo Löwenthal]] and [[Gershom Scholem]]. In 1925, Elias moved to [[Heidelberg]], where [[Alfred Weber]] accepted him as a candidate for a [[habilitation]] (second book project) on the development of modern science, entitled ''Die Bedeutung der Florentiner Gesellschaft und Kultur für die Entstehung der Wissenschaft'' (''The Significance of Florentine Society and Culture for the Development of Science''). In 1930 Elias chose to cancel this project and followed [[Karl Mannheim]] to become his assistant at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University of Frankfurt am Main|University of Frankfurt]]. However, after the [[Nazism|Nazi]] take-over in early 1933, Mannheim's sociological institute was forced to close. The already submitted habilitation thesis entitled ''Der höfische Mensch'' ("The Man of the Court") was never formally accepted and not published until 1969 in a much elaborated form as "Die höfische Gesellschaft" ("The Court Society"). In 1933, Elias fled to [[Paris]]. His elderly parents remained in Breslau, where his father died in 1940; on 30 August 1942 his mother was deported to [[Theresienstadt concentration camp|Theresienstadt]], and on 29 September transferred to and killed in [[Treblinka concentration camp|Treblinka]], dates and places&lt;ref&gt;Adrian Jitschin, 'Family background of Norbert Elias', Figurations #39 (August 2013) 5-7 &lt;/ref&gt; Elias himself never got to know.
During his two years in Paris, Elias worked as a private scholar supported by a scholarship from the Amsterdam Steunfonds (Prof. Frijda's benefit fund) and tried to gain some additional income by organizing a workshop for the production of wooden children's toys. In 1935, he moved on to Great Britain, where he worked on his magnum opus, ''[[The Civilizing Process]]'', until 1939, now supported by a scholarship from a relief organization for Jewish refugees. [[Image:Elias-tablica.JPG|thumb|225px|left|The plaque for Norbert Elias in Wrocław]]In 1939, he met up with his former friend and supervisor Mannheim at the [[London School of Economics]], where he obtained a position as Senior Research Assistant. In 1940, the LSE was evacuated to Cambridge, but when an invasion of Britain by German forces appeared imminent, Elias was detained at internment camps in [[Liverpool]] and on the [[Isle of Man]] for eight months, on account of his being German – an "enemy alien". During his internment he organized political lectures and staged a drama he had written himself, ''Die Ballade vom armen Jakob'' (''The Ballad of Poor Jacob'') with a musical score by [[Hans Gál]] (eventually published in 1987).

Upon his release in 1941, he returned to [[Cambridge, England|Cambridge]]. Towards the end of the war, he worked for British intelligence, investigating hardened Nazis among German prisoners of war (see his essay "The breakdown of civilisation", in ''Studies on the Germans''). He taught evening classes for the [[Workers' Educational Association]] (the adult education organization), and later evening extension courses in sociology, [[psychology]], [[economics]] and [[economic history]] at the [[University of Leicester]]. He also held occasional lectureships at other institutions of higher learning. In collaboration with a friend from Frankfurt days, the psychoanalyst [[S. H. Foulkes]], he laid the theoretical foundations of Group Analysis, an important school of therapy, and co-founded the [[Group Analytic Society]] in 1952. He himself trained and worked as a group therapist. On Febr. 22, 1952 he was naturalized as a British citizen.&lt;ref&gt; http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C12003771&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1954 – at the very late age of 57 – he at last gained his first secure academic post, at University College  [[Leicester]] (which soon became the University of Leicester), first as Lecturer and later as Reader in Sociology. Along with his friend Ilya Neustadt, he made a major contribution to the development of the University's Department of Sociology, which became one of the largest and most influential departments in the United Kingdom. He retired in 1962, but continued to teach graduate students in Leicester until the mid-1970s. Among subsequently famous sociologists whom Neustadt and Elias appointed as colleagues at Leicester, were John H. Goldthorpe, [[Anthony Giddens]], Martin Albrow, Sheila Allen, Joe and Olive Banks, Richard Brown, Mary McIntosh, Nicos Mouzelis and Sami Zubaida and Keith Hopkins. (Hopkins was subsequently Professor of Ancient History at Cambridge: his appointment to teach sociology in Leicester is one sign of the very broad conception Elias and Neustadt had of the discipline of sociology.) Students in the department included John Eldridge, Chris Bryant, Chris Rojek, Paul Hirst, Graeme Salaman and Bryan Wilson. From 1962 to 1964, Elias taught as Professor of Sociology at the [[University of Ghana]] in Legon near [[Accra]]. After his return to Europe in 1965, he spent much time as visiting professor in various German and Dutch universities, and from 1978 based himself in [[Amsterdam]].

His reputation and popularity grew immensely after the republication of ''The Civilising Process'' in 1969. From 1978 to 1984 he worked at the [[Center for Interdisciplinary Research]] at the [[University of Bielefeld]] from which he received an honorary doctorate in 1980. Elias was the first ever laureate of both the [[Theodor W. Adorno Award|Theodor W. Adorno]] Prize (1977) and the [[European Amalfi Prize for Sociology and Social Sciences]] (1987). In 1986 the Große Verdienstkreuz of the German Federal Republic was awarded to him, and on his 90th birthday he was appointed Commander in the Order of Orange-Nassau by the Dutch queen. By 1998 an International Sociological Association worldwide survey of sociologists ranked "On the Process of Civilization" (revised later title) seventh among the most important books in sociology in the twentieth century. In 1990 he collected himself the Nonino prize for a 'Maestro del nostro tempo' in Italy.  Outside his sociological work he always also wrote poetry.

Elias died at his home in Amsterdam on 1 August 1990. In September 2017, a bridge in the Vondelpark, not too far from where he lived, was named after him. In Almere city a street in the 'sustainable' sociologists' quarter also bears his name.

==Work==
Elias' theory focused on the relationship between power, behavior, [[emotion]], and knowledge over time. He significantly shaped what is called process or [[Figurational Sociology|figurational sociology]]. Due to historical circumstances, Elias had long remained a marginal author, until being rediscovered by a new generation of scholars in the 1970s, when he eventually became one of the most influential sociologists in the history of the field. Interest in his work can be partly attributed to the fact that his concept of large social figurations or networks of interdependencies  between people explains the emergence and function of large societal structures without neglecting the aspect of individual [[Structure and agency|agency]]. In the 1960s and 1970s, the overemphasis of structure over agency was heavily criticized about the then-dominant school of [[structural functionalism]].

Elias' most famous work is ''Über den Prozess der Zivilisation'', published in English as ''[[The Civilizing Process]]'' (or, more accurately in the Collected Works edition – see below – as ''On the Process of Civilisation''). Originally published in German, in two volumes, in 1939, it was virtually ignored until its republication in 1969, when its first volume was also translated into English. The first volume traces the historical developments of the [[Europe]]an ''[[Habitus (sociology)|habitus]]'', or "second nature," the particular individual psychic structures molded by social attitudes. Elias traced how post-medieval European standards regarding violence, sexual behaviour, bodily functions, table manners and forms of speech were gradually transformed by increasing thresholds of shame and repugnance, working outward from a nucleus in court [[etiquette]]. The internalized "self-restraint" imposed by increasingly complex networks of social connections developed the "psychological" self-perceptions that [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]] recognized as the "[[super-ego]]." The second volume of ''The Civilizing Process'' looks into the causes of these processes and finds them in the increasingly centralized Early Modern state and the increasingly differentiated and interconnected web of society.

When Elias' work found a larger audience in the 1960s, at first his analysis of the process was misunderstood as an extension of discredited "[[social Darwinism]]," the idea of upward "progress" was dismissed by reading it as consecutive history rather than a metaphor for a social process.

Elias came to write both in English and German. Almost all his work on the sociology of knowledge and the sciences (much of which would more conventionally be called "philosophy of science") was written in English, as was his seminal work in the sociology of sport, collected in ''The Quest for Excitement'', written by Norbert Elias with [[Eric Dunning]], and published in 1986. [[Bielefeld University]]'s Center for Sociology of Development  in 1984 invited Norbert Elias to preside over a gathering of a host of his internationally distinguished fellows who in turn wanted to review and discuss Elias' most interesting theories on civilising processes in person.

In the same year, Elias established the [[www.norberteliasfoundation.nl|Norbert Elias Foundation]] to administer his legacy after his death. The current members of the board of the foundation are Johan Goudsblom (Amsterdam), Hermann Korte (Münster) and Stephen Mennell (Dublin).

Until he retired from the University of Leicester in 1962, Elias had published only one book, ''Über den Prozess der Zivilisation'', and no more than a handful of articles. By the time of his death in 1990, he had published 15 books and something approaching 150 essays. He had always ''written'' a great deal, but found it very difficult ever to be satisfied with the results, and was very reluctant to release his work for publication. Still more curious, although he was such a perfectionist in his writing, he could rarely be persuaded to undertake such mundane tasks as reading and correcting the proofs. Thus, although his German works were well translated into English (for the most part by Edmund Jephcott), the original English editions contain many errors that could have been corrected by thorough proof-reading. In the early twenty-first century, therefore, the Norbert Elias Foundation entered into agreement with [[www.ucdpress.ie|UCD Press, Dublin]], to publish new scholarly editions of Elias's work, running to 18 volumes.

==The Collected Works of Norbert Elias in English==
The new editions of Elias's works have been carefully revised, cross-referenced and annotated (with notes especially about many historical people and events to which Elias makes reference), with a view to making them far more accessible to the reader. Especially important are the three volumes of Elias's collected essays, many of which have not previously been published in English – or were published in such a scattered way or in obscure places that they were hitherto little known. (Other essays can also be found in ''Early Writings, Mozart ''and other volumes.)

"Disidentification in the Center of Power: The Porn Performer and Director Belladonna as a Contrasexual Culture Producer (A Letter to Beatriz Preciado)." ''[[WSQ (journal)|Women's Studies Quarterly]]'' 35.1/2 (2007): 249–270.&lt;/ref&gt; Eight years ago, Paul began a process of "slow transition" where he started the process of becoming a male, physically. From this point on he has considered himself [[transgender]] as well as a [[feminist]]. &lt;ref&gt;https://elpais.com/elpais/2016/01/27/eps/1453910313_124066.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Preciado came to [[The New School]] in New York from Spain on a [[Fulbright]] scholarship to get an MA in Philosophy. [[Jacques Derrida]] and [[Agnes Heller]] became mentors to Preciado. Despite taking a short gap during the spring of Preciado's first year at The New School, Preciado maintained close relations with many professors. In fact, in 1999, Derrida, one of Preciado's professors, invited Preciado to teach a seminar in Paris on forgiveness and the gift during transformation. After transitioning into his professional career, Preciado and his new found partner, Alberto Perez, began to hold empowerment forums in impoverished communities. Later, he came back to the United States to complete his PhD in Philosophy and Theory of Architecture at [[Princeton University]], writing a dissertation called, ''Pornotopía: Architecture and Sexuality in Playboy During the Cold War'' in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/whats-on/tanks-tate-modern/conference/gender-talents-special-address "Gender Talents Special Address."] [[Tate Modern]]. February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Preciado has been professor of Political History of the Body, Gender Theory, and History of Performance at [[Université Paris VIII]] and was the director of the Independent Studies Program (PEI) of the [[MACBA|Museum of Contemporary Art of Barcelona]] (MACBA).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.feministpress.org/books/beatriz-preciado “Beatriz Preciado," (author bio) Feminist Press.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140407062912/http://www.feministpress.org/books/beatriz-preciado |date=7 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;. He is currently Curator of Public Programs of documenta 14, Kassel and Athens.

Since January 2013, Preciado has regularly contributed to French newspaper ''[[Libération]]''′s website Liberation.fr, in a column having gender, sexuality, love and biopower as recurrent themes.&lt;ref name="La statistique, plus forte que l'amour"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.liberation.fr/chroniques/2014/08/01/la-statistique-plus-forte-que-l-amour_1074212|title=La statistique, plus forte que l'amour|website=Libération|last1=Preciado|first1=Paul B.|accessdate=2015-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Known originally as a female writer and identified as a lesbian,&lt;ref name="Daumas" /&gt; Preciado announced in 2014 that he was [[Transitioning (transgender)|transitioning]]&lt;ref name="La statistique, plus forte que l'amour" /&gt; and, in January 2015, changed his first name to ''Paul''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liberation.fr/chroniques/2015/01/16/catalogne-trans_1182248 Catalogne Trans], ''Libération'', 16 January 2015&lt;/ref&gt;Preciado dated French writer-director [[Virginie Despentes]] from 2005 to 2014.&lt;ref name="Daumas"&gt;Cécile Daumas, " [http://www.liberation.fr/livres/0101124185-tete-a-queue Tête à queue] ", ''Libération'', 14 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="La statistique, plus forte que l'amour" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 2008, the book ''[[Testo Junkie|Testo Junkie: sex, drugs, and biopolitics in the pharmacopornographic era]]'', relating Preciado's experience on self-administering [[testosterone (medication)|testosterone]], was published in Spain (as ''Testo yonqui'') and in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Meet the 'Testo Junkie' Who Hacks Her Gender with Testosterone  {{!}} VICE {{!}} Canada|url = https://www.vice.com/en_ca/read/beatriz-preciado-testo-junkie-interview-199|accessdate = 2015-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work was later translated into English in 2013.

Preciado prefaces the book, stating "This book is not a memoir" but "a body-essay".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Preciado|first1=Beatriz|last2=Benderson|first2=Bruce|title=Testo Junkie : Sex, Drugs, and Biopolitics in the Pharmacopornographic Era|date=2013-09-17|publisher=The Feminist Press at CUNY|isbn=9781558618374|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Preciado takes a topical pharmaceutical, [[Testogel]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 'Testo Junkie: Sex, Drugs, and Biopolitics in the Pharmacopornographic Era’ by Beatriz Preciado|url = http://www.lambdaliterary.org/reviews/09/25/testo-junkie-sex-drugs-and-biopolitics-in-the-pharmacopornographic-era-by-beatriz-preciado/|website = Lambda Literary|accessdate = 2015-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a homage to French writer [[Guillaume Dustan]], a close gay friend who contracted AIDS and died of an accidental overdose of a medication he was taking.&lt;ref name=death&gt;{{citation |title=Mort de l'écrivain gay Guillaume Dustan, adepte du sexe à risques |url=http://tf1.lci.fr/infos/france/2005/0,,3252911,00-mort-ecrivain-gay-guillaume-dustan-adepte-sexe-risques-.html |first=Renaud |last=Pila |date=11 October 2005 |accessdate=2008-09-24 |periodical=[[La Chaîne Info]] |language=French }}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Preciado investigates the politicization of the body by what he terms "pharmacopornographic capitalism".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2013/12/04/pharmacopornography-an-interview-with-beatriz-preciado/ “Pharmacopornography: An Interview with Beatriz Preciado.”] ''[[The Paris Review]]''. 4 December 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Preciado described the act of taking testosterone as both political and performance, aiming to undo a notion of gender encoded in one's own body by a system of sexuality and contraception.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Pharmacopornography: An Interview with Beatriz Preciado|url = http://www.theparisreview.org/blog/2013/12/04/pharmacopornography-an-interview-with-beatriz-preciado/|website = Paris Review Daily|date = 4 December 2013|accessdate = 2015-08-01|first = Ricky|last = Tucker}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the work, Preciado describes and analyses the changes provoked by the testosterone from the point of view of the relationship with Virginie Despentes (referred to as "VD" in the book).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Bodies of Work|url = http://www.bookforum.com/inprint/020_03/12182|accessdate = 2015-08-02|first = Johanna|last = Fateman}}&lt;/ref&gt; Testo Junkie also deals with the political aspect of other drugs that transform the body, such as [[Combined oral contraceptive pill|birth control]], [[Sildenafil|Viagra]], [[Doping in sport|drugs used in doping]], [[Fluoxetine|Prozac]], and [[estrogen]].

According to Preciado, all sexual bodies become "intelligible" according to a common "pharmacopornographic technology". There is no such thing as gender without technology. Technology is understood in large sense, from writing technologies, to bio-chemical and image production.

A '''people's jury''', or '''citizen's jury''', is an institution used by a [[democracy|democratically]] elected body to resolve a divisive issue, in order to reach a consensus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Publications/2000/11/cf957ad2-a2c9-4a52-8fd7-c74fccadaffb |title=People's Juries in Social Inclusion Partnerships: A Pilot Project |author1=Robin Clarke |author2=Ruth Rennie |author3=Clare Delap |author4=Vicki Coombe |date=30 November 2000 |work=The Scottish Government |publisher=Development Department Research Programme |accessdate=28 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example, which occurred in [[Oxfordshire]]{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} in the late 1990s, was the use of a people's jury to resolve where to site a [[waste management|waste recycling plant]]. A group of twelve people was selected as though they were going to belong to a legal [[jury]]. They were then taken on a guided tour of the county and introduced to experts in various fields. After they had been given the opportunity to perform sufficient research, they were asked to choose the site to use.

Whilst the idea of people's juries has been hailed as being of great benefit in a democracy, it has also been pointed out that the jury's vote is not likely to be representative of the views of the population in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sru.soc.surrey.ac.uk/SRU37.html |title=Citizens Juries: a radical alternative for social research |author=Tom Wakeford |year=2002 |work=Social Research Update 37 |publisher=Department of Sociology, University of Surrey |accessdate=28 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is argued that because a people's jury is making an informed judgement, it is unlike a [[referendum]], where the views of the most uninformed or ill-informed people carry equal weight.

"The Person-Affecting Restriction, Comparativism, and the Moral Status of Potential People". 2003. http://www.iffs.se/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/The-Person-Affecting-Restriction-Comparativism-and-the-Moral-Status-of-Potential-People.pdf{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;) in [[population ethics]] captures the intuition that an act can only be bad if it is bad ''for'' someone.&lt;ref name="sep"&gt;Roberts, M. A., "The Nonidentity Problem", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Winter 2015 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.). http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nonidentity-problem/&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly something can be good only if it is good ''for'' someone. Therefore, according to standard person-affecting views, there is no moral obligation to create people nor moral good in creating people because nonexistence means "there is never a person who could have benefited from being created". Whether one accepts person-affecting views greatly influences to what extent shaping the far future is important (since there may be greatly more humans existing in the future than has ever existed).&lt;ref name="beckstead-thesis"&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Person-affecting views are also important in considering [[human population control]].

A weaker form of person-affecting views states that an act can only be bad if it is bad for some existing or future person.

Person-affecting views can be seen as a revision of [[total utilitarianism]] in which the "scope of the aggregation" is changed from all individuals who would exist to a subset of those individuals (namely those individuals who already exist).&lt;ref name="beckstead-thesis"/&gt;

Some philosophers who have discussed person-affecting views include [[Derek Parfit]], [[John Broome (philosopher)|John Broome]], [[Larry Temkin]], [[Tatjana Višak]], Gustaf Arrhenius, Nick Beckstead, and Hilary Greaves.

==Variants==

There is no single "person-affecting view" but rather a variety of formulations all involving the idea of something being good or bad ''for'' someone.

* Gustaf Arrhenius formulates the "person-affecting restriction" as saying that moral claims "necessarily involve a reference to humans", so that statements only referencing "the scenery" or "the balance of the ecosystem" (without reference to humans) are excluded from moral consideration.&lt;ref name="arrhenius-2003"/&gt;
* Nick Beckstead states that the person-affecting view claims the following: "When aggregating the interests of different people to determine the value of an outcome, the interests of 'extra' people count for less or can be ignored" (where "extra" can mean different things in different contexts, but in each case actions cannot be good or bad ''for'' "extra" people).&lt;ref name="beckstead-thesis"/&gt; Beckstead further distinguishes between ''moderate'' and ''strict'' person-affecting views, where moderate views give less weight to "extra" people (so that while creating new lives that are good is a good thing, this is inferior to improving already-existing lives) while strict views do not consider "extra" people at all.&lt;ref name="beckstead-thesis"/&gt;
* There are also ''wide'' and ''narrow'' person-affecting views, as well as an ''asymmetric'' view (under which it is considered immoral to bring into this world lives that are not worth living, even though it is morally neutral to bring into this world lives that are worth living – hence the asymmetry).&lt;ref name="beckstead-thesis"/&gt; The asymmetric view in particular can lead one to conclude that [[human extinction]] is good, according to Beckstead.

'''Robert Desgabets''' ({{IPA-fr|deɡabɛ|lang}}; 1610–1678) was a French [[Cartesianism|Cartesian]] [[philosopher]] and [[Order of Saint Benedict|Benedictine]] [[prior]], born in [[Ancemont]].  He had published two book-length philosophical works in his lifetime, ''Considérations sur l'état présent de la controverse touchant le T. S. Sacrement de l'autel'' (''Considerations on the present state of the controversy concerning the Eucharist'') in 1671 and ''Critique de la critique de la recherche de la verité'' (''Critique of the critique of the search for truth'') in 1675.

{{International relations theory sidebar}}
'''Securitization''' in [[international relations]] is the process of [[Sovereign state|state]] actors transforming subjects into matters of "[[security]]": an extreme version of [[politicization]] that enables extraordinary means to be used in the name of security.&lt;ref&gt;Barry Buzan, Ole Wæver, and Jaap de Wilde, ''Security: A New Framework for Analysis'' (Boulder: [[Lynne Rienner Publishers]], 1998), p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; Issues that become securitized do not necessarily represent issues that are essential to the objective survival of a state, but rather represent issues where someone was successful in constructing an issue into an existential problem.

Securitization theorists assert that successfully securitized subjects receive disproportionate amounts of attention and resources compared to unsuccessfully securitized subjects causing more human damage.  A common example used by theorists is how [[terrorism]] is a top priority in security discussions, even though people are much more likely to be killed by automobiles or preventable diseases than from terrorism.

Securitization studies aims to understand "who securitizes (Securitizing actor), on what issues (threats), for whom (referent object), why, with what results, and not least, under what conditions."&lt;ref&gt;Barry Buzan, Ole Wæver, and Jaap de Wilde, ''Security: A New Framework for Analysis'' (Boulder: Lynne Rienner Publishers, 1998), p. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
Within international relations, the concept is connected with the [[Copenhagen School (international relations)|Copenhagen School]] and is seen as a synthesis of [[Constructivism (international relations)|constructivist]] and classical political [[Realism (international relations)|realism]] in its approach.&lt;ref&gt;Michael C. Williams, ''Words, Images, Enemies, Securitization and International Politics'', International Studies Quarterly 2003(47):512.&lt;/ref&gt; The term was coined by [[Ole Wæver]] in 1993, but seems to have become commonplace, at least within constructivist studies of international relations.

==Definition==
Securitization is a process-oriented conception of security, which stands in contrast to materialist approaches of classical [[security studies]]. Classical approaches of security focus on the material dispositions of the threat including distribution of power, military capabilities, and polarity, whereas securitization examines how a certain issue is transformed by an actor into a matter of security in order to allow for the use of extraordinary measures.

Moreover, the securitization act, to be successful, must be accepted by the audience, regardless of the subject matter being a real threat. As [[Thierry Braspenning-Balzacq]] puts it: "securitization is a rule-governed practice, the success of which does not necessarily depend on the existence of a real threat, but on the discursive ability to effectively endow a development with such a specific complexion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Balzacq|first1=Thierry|title=The Three Faces of Securitization: Political Agency, Audience and Context|url=http://ejt.sagepub.com/content/11/2/171}}&lt;/ref&gt; The audience may take several forms including technical, bureaucratic, public, and policymaking, and different audiences can perform different functions by accepting a securitization, as has been explored by Roe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roe|first=Paul|date=Dec 1, 2008|title=Actor, Audience(s) and Emergency Measures: Securitization and the UK's Decision to Invade Iraq|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0967010608098212|journal=Security Dialogue|language=en|volume=39|issue=6|pages=615–635|doi=10.1177/0967010608098212|issn=0967-0106|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As a process==
All securitization acts involve four components:
* A securitizing actor/agent: an entity that makes the securitizing move/statement;
* An existential threat: an object (or ideal) that has been identified as potentially harmful;
* A referent object: an object (or ideal) that is being threatened and needs to be protected;
* An audience: the target of the securitization act that needs to be persuaded and accept the issue as a security threat.

That a given subject is securitized does not necessarily mean that the subject is of objective essence for the survival of a given state, but means merely that someone has successfully constructed something as an existential problem. However, Uriel Abulof argues that empirical studies on securitization have been "insufficiently attentive to societies engulfed in profound existential uncertainty about their own survival." Taking [[Israel]]'s "demographic demon" as a case in point, Abulof suggests that such societies are immersed in "deep securitization", whereby "widespread public discourses explicitly frame threats as probable, protracted, and endangering the very existence of the nation/state."&lt;ref&gt;Uriel Abulof (2014). [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ips.12070/abstract "Deep Securitization and Israel's 'Demographic Demon',"] ''International Political Sociology'' 8(4):396&lt;/ref&gt; Principally, anyone can succeed in constructing something as a security problem through speech acts. The ability to effectively securitize a given subject is, however, highly dependent on both the status of a given actor and whether similar issues are generally perceived to be security threats.

==Effects on society==
Securitization theorists argue that a subject that has been successfully securitized will receive disproportionate attention and resources in comparison with subjects that have not been securitized, even when these other subjects actually cause more harm.&lt;blockquote&gt;traffic incidents cause on average 150,000 fatalities a year in 56 states ... people tend to accept this as a mere fact and do not securitize this by demanding extraordinary measures. It is dealt with as a concern for ordinary politics and legal regulations. There is a tendency to individualize the casualties ... Terrorist attacks caused in the years 1994 to 2004 worldwide average 5,312 fatalities per year. That is less than 5% of the numbers of persons killed annually in traffic accidents in UNECE countries alone. Nevertheless, it is a top priority in security discourses.&lt;ref&gt;Andrej Zwitter &amp; Jaap de Wilde "Prismatic Security Expanding the Copenhagen School to the Local Level", ''Department of International Relations and International Organization (IRIO)'', ''University of Groningen'', https://www.academia.edu/528346/Prismatic_Security_Expanding_the_Copenhagen_School_to_the_Local_Level&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;If a subject is successfully securitized, then it is possible to legitimize extraordinary means to solve a perceived problem. This could include declaring a [[state of emergency]] or [[martial law]], mobilizing the military or attacking another country. Furthermore, if something is successfully labelled as a security problem, then the subject can be considered to be an illegitimate subject for political or academic debate. [[According]] to an overview of the field by Roe, securitization theorists tend to treat securitization as a negative process that undermines democratic processes and diminishes necessary scrutiny that would otherwise be focused on political elites. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Roe|first=Paul|date=8 June 2012|title=Is securitization a ‘negative’ concept? Revisiting the normative debate over normal versus extraordinary politics|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0967010612443723|journal=Security Dialogue|language=en|volume=43|issue=3|pages=249–266|doi=10.1177/0967010612443723|issn=0967-0106|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Affected sectors==
In ''[[Security: A New Framework for Analysis]]'', [[Barry Buzan]], Ole Wæver, and [[Jaap de Wilde]] work with five political sectors in which a securitization could take place:
* [[Military security|Military]]
* [[Political security|Political]] 
* [[Economic security|Economic]] 
* [[Societal security|Society]] 
* [[Environmental security|Environment]]

However, a securitization could easily involve more than one of these sectors. In the case of the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], one could say that the conflict was securitized militarily; [[Iraq and weapons of mass destruction|weapons of mass destruction]] was one reason for the invasion. However, the war was also securitized as a societal problem; [[human rights in Saddam Hussein's Iraq]] was mentioned in the public rationale.

Another example for securitized sectors are [[immigration]]&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Faist. 2005. “The Migration-Security Nexus: International Migration and Security.” In: Migration, Citizenship and Ethnos: Incorporation Regimes in Germany, Western Europe and North America, edited by Y. Michal Bodemann and Gökce Yurdakul, pp. 103–120. New York: Palgrave Macmillan; Fiona B. Adamson. 2006. “Crossing Borders: International Migration and National Security.” International Security 31 (1): 165-99.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[refugee]]&lt;ref&gt;Jef Huysmans. 2006. The Politics of Insecurity: Fear, Migration and Asylum in the EU. London: Routledge; Alison Gerard. 2014. The Securitization of Migration and Refugee Women. New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; issues in the [[United States]] and in [[Europe]]. Concerns of terrorist infiltration are regularly cited as grounds for the tight [[Border control|control of borders]]. Because it is easier to securitize an issue following the [[September 11 attacks|September 11]] attacks, this concern for safety and security has taken attention away from the economic factors that have always been at play in international migration. In addition, also in migrants' countries of origin, [[diaspora]], [[emigration]], and [[citizenship]] issues can be securitized.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Naujoks. 2015. “The securitization of dual citizenship. National security concerns and the making of the Overseas Citizenship of India.” Diaspora Studies 8 (1), pp. 18–36.&lt;/ref&gt;

==As a tactic==
Since securitized subjects can receive a disproportionate amounts of attention and resources compared to unsuccessfully securitized subjects, some political strategists suggest that existing public policy issues can find more clout and attention among the public if advocates on these subjects succeed in securitizing them.

For example, theorists suggest that advocates of [[space exploration]] could achieve more success by convincing state actors of the merits of their proposals around the rubric of security rather than science: that space exploration could be framed around how it protects humanity from looming existential threats such as meteorites, rather than around how it helps advance scientific knowledge.

==Criticism and responses==
Securitization as a "school" of international relations has been criticized for its lack of practical usefulness. Unlike other schools of international relations, such as [[Liberalism (international relations)|liberalism]] or realism, which can provide a framework or basis for understanding how to conduct international [[diplomacy]], securitization has been criticized for being a theory that is more akin to an interesting observation, rather than a theory which can be used in practical ways by political actors. Critics argue that pointing out the irrationality of a successfully securitized issue does little to change its political dynamics, because as long as an issue remains successfully securitized, political actors will still be compelled to deal with it in the ways that its securitization demands.

'''''Shamanism: Archaic Techniques of Ecstasy''''' is a historical study of the different forms of [[shamanism]] around the world written by the Romanian [[history of religion|historian of religion]] [[Mircea Eliade]]. It was first published in France by Librarie Payot under the French title of ''Le Chamanisme et les techniques archaïques de l'extase'' in 1951. The book was subsequently translated into English by Willard R. Trask and published by [[Princeton University Press]] in 1964.

At the time of the book's writing, Eliade had earned a [[PhD]] studying [[Hinduism]] in India before becoming involved with [[far right]] politics in his native Romania. After the rise of the [[Communist Romania|communist government]], he fled to Paris, France in 1945, where he took up an academic position and began studying shamanism, authoring several [[academic paper]]s on the subject before publishing his book.

The first half of ''Shamanism'' deals with the various different elements of shamanic practice, such as the nature of initiatory sickness and dreams, the method for obtaining shamanic powers, the role of shamanic initiation and the symbolism of the shaman's costume and drum. The book's second half looks at the development of shamanism in each region of the world where it is found, including Central and North Asia, the Americas, Southeastern Asia and Oceania and also Tibet, China and the Far East. Eliade argues that all of these shamanisms must have had a common source as the original religion of humanity in the [[Palaeolithic]].

On publication, Eliade's book was recognised as a seminal and authoritative study on the subject of shamanism. In later decades, as anthropological and historical scholarship increased and improved, elements of the book came under increasing scrutiny, as did Eliade's argument that there was a global phenomenon that could be termed "shamanism" or that all shamanisms had a common source. His book also proved to be a significant influence over the [[Neoshamanism|Neoshamanic]] movement which developed in the [[western world]] in the 1960s and 1970s.

==Background==
Mircea Eliade was born in [[Bucharest]], [[Romania]] in 1907. Attending the Spiru Haret National College, he subsequently studied at the [[University of Bucharest]]'s Faculty of Philosophy and Letters from 1925 through to 1928. Traveling to India to study the country's religions, in 1933 he received his [[PhD]] for a thesis devoted to a discussion of [[Yoga]]. Writing for the nationalist newspaper ''[[Cuvântul]]'', he spoke out against [[antisemitism]] but became associated with the [[Iron Guard]], a Romanian [[fascism|fascist]] group. Arrested for his involvement in the [[far right]], following his release in 1940 he gained employment as a cultural attaché to both the United Kingdom and then Portugal. Following the [[Second World War]], Eliade moved to [[Paris]], France, fearing the rise of a [[Communist Romania|communist government in Romania]]. Here, he married for a second time, to the Romanian exile Christinel Cotescu.&lt;ref name="msrsotia"&gt;Mihai Sorin Rădulescu, [http://www.zf.ro/articol_87328/cottestii__familia_sotiei_lui_mircea_eliade.html "Cotteştii: familia soţiei lui Mircea Eliade" ("The Cottescus: the Family of Mircea Eliade's Wife")] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080803223957/http://www.zf.ro/articol_87328/cottestii__familia_sotiei_lui_mircea_eliade.html |date=2008-08-03 }}, in ''[[Ziarul Financiar]]'', June 30, 2006; retrieved January 22, 2008 {{ro icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together with [[Emil Cioran]] and other Romanian expatriates, Eliade rallied with the former diplomat [[Alexandru Busuioceanu]], helping him publicize [[Anti-communism|anti-communist]] opinion to the [[Western Europe]]an public.&lt;ref name="guleaobsc"&gt;Dan Gulea, [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/informatiiarticol.phtml?xid=12070 "O perspectivă sintetică" ("A Syncretic Perspective")] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130113115235/http://www.observatorcultural.ro/informatiiarticol.phtml?xid=12070 |date=2013-01-13 }}, in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 242, October 2004; retrieved October 4, 2007 {{ro icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1947, he was facing material constraints, and [[Ananda Coomaraswamy]] found him a job as a [[French language|French-language]] teacher in the United States, at a school in [[Arizona]]; the arrangement ended upon Coomaraswamy's death in September.&lt;ref name="McGuire, p.150"&gt;McGuire, p.150&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 1948, he wrote for the journal ''Critique'', edited by French thinker [[Georges Bataille]].&lt;ref name="Biografie in Handoca"&gt;''Biografie'', in Handoca&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, he went on a visit to Italy, where he wrote the first 300 pages of his novel ''[[Noaptea de Sânziene]]'' (he visited the country a third time in 1952).&lt;ref name="Biografie in Handoca"/&gt; He collaborated with [[Carl Jung]] and the ''[[Eranos]]'' circle after [[Henry Corbin]] recommended him in 1949,&lt;ref name="McGuire, p.150"/&gt; and wrote for the ''Antaios'' magazine (edited by [[Ernst Jünger]]).&lt;ref name="ribas"&gt;Albert Ribas, "Mircea Eliade, historiador de las religiones" ("Mircea Eliade, Historian of Religions"), in ''El Ciervo. Revista de pensamiento y cultura'', Año 49, Núm. 588 (Marzo 2000), p.35–38&lt;/ref&gt; In 1950, Eliade began attending ''Eranos'' conferences, meeting Jung, [[Olga Fröbe-Kapteyn]], [[Gershom Scholem]] and [[Paul Radin]].&lt;ref&gt;McGuire, p.150–151&lt;/ref&gt; He described ''Eranos'' as "one of the most creative cultural experiences of the modern Western world."&lt;ref name="McGuire, p.151"&gt;McGuire, p.151&lt;/ref&gt;

Working from France, Eliade had begun to study shamanism from a global perspective, publishing three papers on the subject: "Le Probléme du chamanisme" in the ''Revue de l'histoire des religions'' journal (1946), "Shamanism" in ''Forgotten Religions'', an anthology edited by Vergilius Ferm (1949), and "Einführende Betrachtungen über den Schamanismus" in the ''Paideuma'' journal (1951). He had also lectured on the subject in March 1950 at both the [[Sapienza University of Rome|University of Rome]] and the [[National Museum of Oriental Art|Instituto Italiano per il Medio ed Estremo Oriente]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Eli04|Eliade 2004 [1951]]]. p. xxvii.&lt;/ref&gt;

}}
In his foreword, Eliade explains the approach that he has taken in the book, noting that his intention is to situate world shamanism within the larger [[history of religion]]. Disputing any claims that shamanism is a result of mental illness, he highlights the benefits that further sociological and ethnographic research could provide before explaining the role of a historian of religions. Describing shamanism as "precisely one of the archaic techniques of ecstasy", he proclaims that it is "at once [[mysticism]], [[magic (paranormal)|magic]] and "religion" in the broadest sense of the term."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Eli04|Eliade 2004 [1951]]]. pp. xvii&amp;ndash;xxvii&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapter one, "General Considerations. Recruiting Methods. Shamanism and Mystical Vocation", details Eliade's exploration of the etymology and terminological usage of the word "shamanism".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Eli04|Eliade 2004 [1951]]]. pp. 3&amp;ndash;32.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arguments==

===Definition of "shamanism"===
Within his study of the subject, Eliade proposed several different definitions of the word "shamanism". The first of these was that shamanism simply constituted a "technique of ecstasy", and in Eliade's opinion, this was the "least hazardous" definition.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Eli04|Eliade 2004 [1951]]]. p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

Discussing the Norse practice of ''[[Seiðr]]'' in her book ''Gods and Myths of Northern Europe'' (1964), the academic [[Hilda Ellis Davidson]] described Eliade's French-language book as the "fullest recent study of shamanism".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ell64|Ellis Davidson 1964]]. p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

Further criticism of some of Eliade's positions came from the English historian [[Ronald Hutton]] of the [[University of Bristol]] in his book, ''[[Shamans (Hutton book)|Shamans: Siberian Spirituality and the Western Imagination]]'' (2001). Hutton took issue with Eliade's claim that [[divination]] only played a minor role in Siberian shamanism, claiming that Eliade had produced no data to substantiate such an assertion, and that the ethnographic evidence actually indicated that the opposite was true. He saw this as part of a wider problem whereby Eliade had ignored certain "varieties of native practitioner" from his "chosen image of shaman" and had been "intent on generalizations."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hut01|Hutton 2001]]. pp. 54–55, 81.&lt;/ref&gt; Hutton also argued that Eliade's description of traditional Siberian cosmology oversimplified great diversity among the various Siberian indigenous groups and that Eliade's claims that Siberian shamanism revolved around a vision of death and rebirth was similarly erroneous.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hut01|Hutton 2001]]. pp. 60–61, 74.&lt;/ref&gt;

|quote     = "Several of [Eliade's] grand cross-cultural themes – the sky god, the quest, the sacred center – as well as the tension between historical specificity and synchronic themes, loom large in ''Shamanism'', which remains one of his most interesting, important, and influential books."

}}

For the 2004 English-language re-publication of ''Shamanism'' by Princeton University Press, a new foreword was commissioned from the academic Indologist [[Wendy Doniger]]. At the time, Doniger held the position of Mircea Eliade Professor of the History of Religions at the [[University of Chicago]]. Having been a personal friend and colleague of his for many years, Doniger used her foreword to defend him from accusations that he was either a [[fascist]] or an [[anti-semite]], and evaluated his work in ''Shamanism''. Drawing comparisons with anthropologist [[James Frazer]] and philologist [[Max Müller]], she accepted that while he advanced the knowledge of his time "within a body of assumptions that we no longer accept", his work inspired "an entire generation" of scholars and amateurs in the study of religion.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Don04|Doniger 2004]]. pp. xi–xv.&lt;/ref&gt;

After Han conquered Zheng in 375 BC, he rose up in the ranks of the Han officialdom, dividing up its territories and successfully reforming it. Though not dealing in penal law himself, his administrative innovations would be taken into [[Legalism (philosophy)|"Chinese Legalist"]] statecraft by [[Han Fei]], his most famous successor, and Shen Buhai's book most resembles the [[Han Feizi]] (though more conciliatory).

==Shenzi==
Shen was known for his cryptic writing style. Because the writings attributed to him appear to be pre-Han dynasty, he is credited with writing a now extinct two chapter text, the ''Shenzi'' (申子), which is concerned almost exclusively with the philosophy of governmental administration. In 141 BC, under the influence of Confucians, the reign of [[Emperor Wu of Han]] saw Shen Buhai's name was listed with other legalist thinkers whose ideas were officially banned from the government; from that point on, scholarship Shen's ideas went into a steep decline, despite continued use of his foundational ideas in administration (much of which, consisting of skill and report checking, would be unavoidable).

Widely read in Han times, in comparison to the still-complete [[Han Feizi]] the Shenzi was listed as lost by the [[Liang dynasty]] (502-556). Appearing again in the bibliographies of both Tang histories, it's only traces remain as quotes in surviving texts in ''Qunshu Zhiyao'', compiled in 631, and ''Yilin'', compiled around 786. During the [[Qing Dynasty]], three major attempts were made to reconstruct the contents of the work, the last mention occurring in 1616, and in a library catalogue from 1700.&lt;ref&gt;Creel 1970 p.62, What Is Taoism? https://books.google.com/books?id=5p6EBnx4_W0C&amp;pg=PA62

{{further information|Chinese Legalism}}
The [[Huainanzi]] says that when Shen Buhai lived the officials of the state of Han were at cross-purposes and did not know what practices to follow.&lt;ref&gt;Creel 1970 p.86. What Is Taoism? https://books.google.com/books?id=5p6EBnx4_W0C&amp;pg=PA86
* Creel, 1959 p. 206. The Meaning of Hsing-Ming. Studia Serica: Sinological studies dedicated to Bernhard Kalgren&lt;/ref&gt; Though not unifying the laws as [[Shang Yang]] did, what Shen appears to have realized is that the "methods for the control of a bureaucracy" could not be mixed with the survivals of feudal government, or staffed merely by "getting together a group of 'good men'", but rather must be men qualified in their jobs. Unlike Shang Yang, Shen therefore emphasizes the importance of selecting able officials as much as Confucius did, but insists on "constant vigilance over their performance", never mentioning virtue. In comparison with [[Han Fei]] on the other hand his system required a strong ruler at the center, emphasizing that he trust no one minister.

Ideally, Shen Buhai's ruler had the widest possible sovereignty, was intelligent (if not a sage), had to make all crucial decisions himself, and had unlimited control of the bureaucracy - over which, in contrast to Shang Yang, he is simply the head. Championing ''Fa'' (法 "method"), Shen believed that the greatest threat to a ruler's power came from within, and unlike Han Fei, never preaches to his ministers about duty or loyalty. He insisted that the ruler must be fully informed on the state of his realm, but couldn't afford to get caught up in details and was advised to listen to no one - and does not, as [[Sinologist]] [[Herrlee G. Creel]] says, have the time to do so. The way to see and hear independently is by grouping particulars into categories through mechanical or operational decision making (Fa or "method").&lt;ref&gt;Creel 1970 p.63,65,81,86.

Shen's doctrines, posthumously referred to by Han Fei as Shu or Techniques (a term Shen does not appear to have used), are described as concerned almost exclusively with the "ruler's role and the methods by which he may control a bureaucracy", that is, its management and personnel control: the selection of capable ministers, their performance, the monopolization of power,&lt;ref&gt;Creel 1970, What Is Taoism?, 81, 100, 103&lt;/ref&gt; and the control of and power relations between ruler and minister which he characterized as [[Wu wei|Wu Wei]].&lt;ref name="Chad Hansen p.359"/&gt; They can therefore easily be considered the most crucial element in controlling a bureaucracy.&lt;ref&gt;Xuezhi Guo 2001, p.142, The Ideal Chinese Political Leader&lt;/ref&gt; 

More specifically, Shen Buhai's  methods (Fa) focused on "scrutinizing achievement and on that ground alone to give rewards, and to bestow office solely on the basis of ability".&lt;ref&gt;Creel 1970. p.93. What Is Taoism?

Shen Buhai's personnel control, or [[rectification of names]] (such as titles) worked through "strict performance control"(Hansen), correlating performance and posts (Xing or Shih and Ming).&lt;ref name="Chad Hansen p.359"&gt;Chad Hansen, 1992 p.359 A Daoist Theory of Chinese Thought https://books.google.com/books?id=nzHmobC0ThsC&amp;pg=PA359&lt;/ref&gt; It would become a central tenant of both "Legalist" statecraft&lt;ref&gt;John Makeham 1994 p.67.

In the Han Dynasty secretaries of government who had charge of the records of decisions in criminal matters were called Xing-Ming, a term used by [[Han Fei]], which [[Sima Qian]] (145 or 135 – 86 BC) and [[Liu Xiang (scholar)|Liu Xiang]] (77 BC – 6 BC) attributed to the doctrine of Shen Buhai(400 BC – c. 337 BC).&lt;ref name="Makeham, J. 1990 p.91"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Creel 1970 p.72,80,103.

The logician [[Deng Xi]] (died 501 BCE) is cited by Liu Xiang for the origin of the principle of Xing-Ming. Serving as a minor official in the state of [[Zheng (state)|Zheng]], he is reported to have drawn up a code of penal laws. Associated with litigation, he is said to have argued for the permissibility of contradictory propositions, likely engaging in hair-splitting debates on the interpretation of laws, legal principles and definitions.&lt;ref&gt;Antonio S. Cua 2003 p.492. Encyclopedia of Chinese Philosophy https://books.google.com/books?id=yTv_AQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA492&lt;/ref&gt;

Shen Buhai solves this through [[Wu wei]], or not getting involved, making an official's words his own responsibility.&lt;ref name="Makeham, J. 1990 p.91"&gt;Makeham, J. (1990) p. 91. The Legalist Concept of Hsing-Ming: An Example of the Contribution of Archaeological Evidence to the Re-Interpretation of Transmitted Texts. Monumenta Serica, 39, 87-114. Retrieved from https://www.jstor.org/stable/40726902&lt;/ref&gt; Shen Buhai says, "The ruler controls the policy, the ministers manage affairs. To speak ten times and ten times be right, to act a hundred times and a hundred times succeed - this is the business of one who serves another as minister; it is the not the way to rule."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Creel 1970 p.65. What Is Taoism? https://books.google.com/books?id=5p6EBnx4_W0C&amp;pg=PA65&lt;/ref&gt; Noting all the details of a claim and then attempting to objectively compare them with his achievements through passive mindfulness (the "method of yin"), Shen Buhai's ruler neither adds to nor detracts from anything, giving names (titles/offices) on the basis of claim.&lt;ref name="Makeham, J. 1990 p.91"/&gt;

Shen supported reward for visible results,&lt;ref&gt;A.C. Graham 1989. p.283. Disputers of the Tao. https://books.google.com/books?id=QBzyCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA283&lt;/ref&gt; using ming-shih for investigation and appointment, but the legal system of Han was apparently confused, prohibiting uniform reward and punishment. We have no basis to suppose that Shen advocated the doctrine of rewards and punishment (of [[Shang Yang]], as Han Fei did), and Han Fei criticizes him for not unifying the laws.&lt;ref&gt;Creel, 1974 p.32.

{{further information|Wu wei}}
Earlier modern scholars suggested that Shen's statecraft blended with [[Taoism]]. Rather, since the bulk of the [[Tao Te Ching]] appears to have been composed later, it might therefore be assumed that Shen influenced the Tao Te Ching. Lacking any metaphysical connotation, Shen used the term [[Wu wei]] to mean that the ruler, though vigilant, should not interfere with the duties of his ministers.&lt;ref&gt;Creel 1970 p.62-63.

Following Shen, [[Han Fei]]strongly advocated [[Wu wei]]. During the Han dynasty up until the reign of [[Han Wudi]], rulers confined their activity "chiefly to the appointment and dismissal of his high officials", a plainly "Legalist" practice inherited from the [[Qin dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;Creel 1970 p.99. What Is Taoism? https://books.google.com/books?id=5p6EBnx4_W0C&amp;pg=PA99
* Pan Ku. trans. Homer Dubs, The History of the Former Han Dynasty&lt;/ref&gt; This "conception of the ruler's role as a supreme arbiter, who keeps the essential power firmly in his grasp" while leaving details to ministers, has a "deep influence on the theory and practice of Chinese monarchy."

Shen Buhai argued that if the government were organized and supervised relying on proper method (Fa), the ruler need do little--and must do little.&lt;ref&gt;Creel 1970 p.69,99. What Is Taoism? https://books.google.com/books?id=5p6EBnx4_W0C&amp;pg=PA69

Zalta (ed.), http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2014/entries/chinese-legalism/&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Shen still believed that the ruler's most able ministers are his greatest danger,&lt;ref&gt;Creel, 1974 p.35 Shen Pu-hai: A Chinese Political Philosopher of the Fourth Century B.C.&lt;/ref&gt; and is convinced that it is impossible to make them loyal without techniques.&lt;ref&gt;Xuezhi Go, 2002. p.143 The Ideal Chinese Political Leader.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sinologist]] [[Herrlee G. Creel]] explains: "The ruler's subjects are so numerous, and so on alert to discover his weaknesses and get the better of him, that it is hopeless for him alone as one man to try to learn their characteristics and control them by his knowledge... the ruler must refrain from taking the initiative, and from making himself conspicuous--and therefore vulnerable--by taking any overt action."&lt;ref&gt;Creel 1970 p.67. What Is Taoism? https://books.google.com/books?id=5p6EBnx4_W0C&amp;pg=PA67&lt;/ref&gt;

Emphasizing the use of administrative methods (Fa) in secrecy, Shen Buhai portrays the ruler as putting up a front to hide his weaknesses and dependence on his advisers.&lt;ref&gt;Karyn Lai 2017. p.171. An Introduction to Chinese Philosophy. https://books.google.com/books?id=3M1WDgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA171&lt;/ref&gt; Shen therefore advises the ruler to keep his own counsel, hide his motivations, and conceal his tracks in inaction, availing himself of an appearance of stupidity and insufficiency.

Acting through administrative method (Fa), the ruler conceals his intentions, likes and dislikes, skills and opinions. Not acting himself, he can avoid being manipulated.&lt;ref&gt;S.Y.

He should not use his talent even if he has it. Not using his own skills, he is better able to secure the services of capable functionaries.

This Wu wei (or nonaction) might be said to end up the political theory of the [[Legalism (philosophy)|"Legalists"]] , if not becoming their general term for political strategy, playing a "crucial role in the promotion of the autocratic tradition of the Chinese polity." The (qualified) non-action of the ruler ensures his power and the stability of the polity.&lt;ref&gt;Xuezhi Go, 2002. p.198 The Ideal Chinese Political Leader.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
The [[Shiji]] records [[Li Si]] as repeatedly recommending "supervising and holding responsible", which he attributed to Shen Buhai. A stele set up by [[Qin Shi Huang]] memorializes him as a sage that, taking charge of the government, established Xing-Ming - Shen Buhai and Han Fei's doctrine of personnel selection. The Shiji states that [[Emperor Wen of Han]] was "basically fond of Xing-Ming." The scholar [[Jia Yi]] advised Wen to teach his heir to use Shen Buhai's method, so as to be able to "supervise the functions of the many officials and understand the usages of government."  Two advisors to Wen's heir, [[Emperor Jing of Han]] were students of Xing-Ming, one passing the highest grade of examination, and admonished Jing for not using it on the feudal lords.

By the time of the civil service examination was put into place, Confucian influence saw outright discussion of Shen Buhai banned. However, the Emperor under which it was founded, [[Emperor Wu of Han]], was both familiar with and favorable to Legalist ideas, and the civil service examination did not come into existence until its support by [[Gongsun Hong]], who wrote a book on Xing-Ming.&lt;ref&gt;Creel 1970 p.83,86-87,103,105-107,112,114,115.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3926">'''Sidi Mohamed Barkat''' (born 1948 in [[Oran]]) is an [[Algerian people|Algerian]] philosopher employed in [[Paris]].

He was an associate researcher at the psychology of work and action laboratory at the [[Conservatoire national des arts et métiers]]. After several years of employment by the university, where he was mainly occupied with questions of [[epistemology]] in the [[social sciences]], Sidi Mohammed Barkat directed a research programme at the [[Collège international de philosophie]] in Paris on the image and condition of "the native Algerian" from 1998 to 2004.

He proposed a conception of legal, political and social character based on the terminology of the ''corps d'exception'' (body of exclusion&lt;!---?--&gt;). This made direct reference to the experience of the Algerian population's experience during the [[French Algeria|French occupation]] and intersects with the highly politicised debate about French treatment of indigenous peoples (see [[Indigénat]]). [[Pierre Tevanian]] has used this concept in his own work.&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Tévanian. « Le « corps d’exception » et ses métamorphoses.

{{Sociology}}
'''Social epistemology''' refers to a broad set of approaches that can be taken in the study of [[knowledge]] that construes human knowledge as a collective achievement. Another way of characterizing social epistemology is as the evaluation of the social dimensions of knowledge or information.&lt;ref name="sep"&gt;{{Cite SEP|url-id=epistemology-social|title=Social Epistemology|first=Alvin|last=Goldman|first2=Thomas|last2=Blanchard|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is sometimes simplified to mean a social justification of belief.&lt;ref name="sep"/&gt;

One of the enduring difficulties with defining "social epistemology" that arises is the attempt to determine what the word "knowledge" means in this context. There is also a challenge in arriving at a definition of "social" which satisfies academics from different disciplines.&lt;ref name="sep"/&gt; Social epistemologists may exist working in many of the disciplines of the humanities and [[social sciences]], most commonly in [[philosophy]] and [[sociology]]. In addition to marking a distinct movement in traditional and analytic [[epistemology]], social epistemology is associated with the interdisciplinary field of [[science and technology studies]] (STS).

== History ==
The consideration of social dimensions of knowledge in relation to philosophy started in 380 B.C.E with Plato's dialogue: [[Charmides (dialogue)|Charmides]]. In it he questions the degree of certainty an unprofessional in a field can have towards a person's claim to be a specialist in that same field. As the exploration of a dependence on authoritative figures constitutes a part of the study of social epistemology, it confirms the existence of the ideology in minds long before it was given its label. 

In 1936, [[Karl Mannheim]] turned [[Karl Marx]]'s theory of ideology (which interpreted the "social" aspect in epistemology to be of a political or sociological nature) into an analysis of how the human society develops and functions.

It was not until the 1970s that there was a powerful growth of interest amongst philosophers in topics such as epistemic value of testimony, the nature and function of expertise, proper distribution of cognitive labor and resources among individuals in the communities and the status of group reasoning and knowledge.

=== The rise of social epistemology ===
The term "social epistemology" was firstly used by the library scientists [[Margaret Egan]] and [[Jesse Shera]] in the 1950s. [[Steven Shapin]] also used it in 1979. However, it was not until the late 1980s that its current sense began to emerge. In 1987, the philosophical journal ''[[Synthese]]'' published a special issue on social epistemology which included two authors that have since taken the branch of epistemology in two divergent directions: [[Alvin Goldman]] and [[Steve Fuller (sociologist)|Steve Fuller]].&lt;ref&gt;A comparison of Goldman and Fuller can be found in ''Legitimizing Scientific Knowledge: An Introduction to Steve Fuller's Social Epistemology'', Francis Remedios, Lexington Books, 2003. pp.&amp;nbsp;106 –112. http://social-epistemology.com/2013/07/12/orienting-social-epistemology-francis-remedios/&lt;/ref&gt; Fuller founded a journal called ''[[Social Epistemology (journal)|Social Epistemology: A journal of knowledge, culture, and policy]]'' in 1987 and published his first book, ''Social Epistemology'', in 1988. Goldman's ''Knowledge in a Social World'' came out in 1999. Goldman advocates for a type of epistemology which is sometimes called "veritistic epistemology" because of its large emphasis on truth.&lt;ref name="goldman"&gt;{{url|http://www.ed.uiuc.edu/EPS/PES-Yearbook/95_docs/goldman.html}}{{Dead link|date=June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of epistemology is sometimes seen to side with "essentialism" as opposed to "multiculturalism".&lt;ref name="goldman"/&gt; But Goldman has argued that this association between veritistic epistemology and essentialism is not necessary.&lt;ref name="goldman"/&gt; He describes Social Epistemology as knowledge derived from one's interactions with another person, group or society. 

Goldman looks into one of the two strategies of the socialization of epistemology. This strategy includes the evaluation of social factors that impact knowledge formed on true belief. In contrast, Fuller takes preference for the second strategy that defines knowledge influenced by social factors as collectively accepted belief. The difference between the two can be simplified with exemplars e.g.: the first strategy means analyzing how your degree of wealth (a social factor) influences what information you determine to be valid whilst the second strategy occurs when an evaluation is done on wealth’s influence upon your knowledge acquired from the beliefs of the society in which you find yourself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rimkutė|first=Audronė|date=2014|title=The Problem of Social Knowledge in Contemporary Social Epistemology: Two Approaches|url=http://www.journals.vu.lt/problemos/article/view/6645|journal=Problemos|language=lt|volume=0|issue=65|pages=4–19|doi=10.15388/Problemos.2004.65.6645|issn=1392-1126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, on the occasion of the 25th anniversary of ''Social Epistemology'', Fuller reflected upon the history and the prospects of the field, including the need for social epistemology to re-connect with the larger issues of knowledge production first identified by [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] as ''cognitive economy'' and nowadays often pursued by [[library and information science]]. As for the "analytic social epistemology", to which Goldman has been a significant contributor, Fuller concludes that it has "failed to make significant progress owing, in part, to a minimal understanding of actual knowledge practices, a minimised role for philosophers in ongoing inquiry, and a focus on maintaining the status quo of epistemology as a field."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fuller|first1=Steve|title=Social Epistemology: A Quarter-Century Itinerary|journal=Social Epistemology|volume=26|issue=3-4|year=2012|doi=10.1080/02691728.2012.714415}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic view of knowledge that motivated the emergence of social epistemology as it is perceived today can be traced to the work of [[Thomas Kuhn]] and [[Michel Foucault]], which gained acknowledgment at the end of the 1960s. Both brought historical concerns directly to bear on problems long associated with the [[philosophy of science]]. Perhaps the most notable issue here was the nature of [[truth]], which both Kuhn and Foucault described as a relative and contingent notion. On this background, ongoing work in the [[sociology of scientific knowledge]] (SSK) and the [[history and philosophy of science]] (HPS) was able to assert its epistemological consequences, leading most notably to the establishment of the [[strong programme]] at the [[University of Edinburgh]]. In terms of the two strands of social epistemology, Fuller is more sensitive and receptive to this historical trajectory (if not always in agreement) than Goldman, whose "veritistic" social epistemology can be reasonably read as a systematic rejection of the more extreme claims associated with Kuhn and Foucault.

==Social epistemology as a field within analytic philosophy==
As a field within [[analytic philosophy]], social epistemology foregrounds the social aspects of knowledge creation and dissemination. What precisely these social aspects are, and whether they have beneficial or detrimental effects upon the possibilities to create, acquire and spread knowledge is a subject of continuous debate.

Within the field, "the social" is approached in two complementary and not mutually exclusive ways: "the social" character of knowledge can either be approached through inquiries in ''inter-individual'' epistemic relations or through inquiries focusing on epistemic ''communities''. The inter-individual approach typically focuses on issues such as [[testimony]], epistemic trust as a form of trust placed by one individual in another, epistemic dependence, epistemic authority, etc. The community approach typically focuses on issues such as community standards of justification, community procedures of critique, diversity, epistemic justice, and collective knowledge.&lt;ref name="sep"/&gt;

Social epistemology as a field within analytic philosophy has close ties to, and often overlaps with [[feminist epistemology]] and [[philosophy of science]]. While parts of the field engage in abstract, normative considerations of knowledge creation and dissemination, other parts of the field are "naturalized epistemology" in the sense that they draw on empirically gained insights---which could mean [[natural science]] research from, e.g., [[cognitive psychology]], be that [[qualitative research|qualitative]] or [[quantitative research|quantitative]] [[social science]] research. (For the notion of "naturalized epistemology" see [[Willard Van Orman Quine]].) And while parts of the field are concerned with analytic considerations of rather general character, case-based and domain-specific inquiries in, e.g., knowledge creation in collaborative scientific practice, knowledge exchange on online platforms or knowledge gained in learning institutions play an increasing role.

Important academic journals for social epistemology as a field within analytic philosophy are, e.g., ''[[Episteme (journal)|Episteme]]'', ''[[Hypatia (journal)|Hypatia]]'', ''[[Social Epistemology (journal)|Social Epistemology]]'', and ''[[Synthese]]''. However, major works within this field are also published in journals that predominantly address philosophers of science and psychology or in interdisciplinary journals which focus on particular domains of inquiry (such as, e.g., ''[[Ethics and Information Technology]]'').

== Major philosophers who influenced social epistemology ==
# [[Plato]] in [[Charmides (dialogue)|Charmides Dialogue]]
# [[John Locke]] in Problem of Testimony
# [[David Hume]] in Problem of Testimony
# [[Thomas Reid]] in Problem of Testimony
# [[Karl Marx]] in Conception of Ideology
#* extended by [[Karl Mannheim]] who portrayed the sociological aspect of knowledge with the reasoning that a knowledge claim's validity is restricted by the social conditions wherein the claims were initially made.

==Present and future concerns==
In both stages, both varieties of social epistemology remain largely "academic" or "theoretical" projects. Yet both emphasize the social significance of knowledge and therefore the cultural value of social epistemology itself. A range of journals publishing social epistemology welcome papers that include a policy dimension. 

More practical applications of social epistemology can be found in the areas of [[library science]], [[academic publishing]], guidelines for scientific authorship and collaboration, [[knowledge policy]] and debates over the role over the Internet in knowledge transmission and creation.

Social epistemology is still considered a relatively new addition to philosophy, with its problems and theories still fresh and in rapid movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schmitt|first=Frederick F.|last2=Scholz|first2=Oliver R.|date=2010|title=Introduction: The History of Social Epistemology|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/episteme/article/introduction-the-history-of-social-epistemology/DDCF782B4CDBEBD2098140847C64700C|journal=Episteme|volume=7|issue=1|pages=1–6|doi=10.3366/E174236000900077X|issn=1750-0117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="38813">'''System justification theory''' ('''SJT''') is a theory within [[social psychology]] that system-justifying beliefs serve a psychologically palliative function. It proposes that people have several underlying needs, which vary from individual to individual, that can be satisfied by the defense and justification of the status quo, even when the system may be disadvantageous to certain people. People have epistemic, existential, and relational needs that are met by and manifest as ideological support for the prevailing structure of social, economic, and political norms. Need for order and stability, and thus resistance to change or alternatives, for example, can be a motivator for individuals to see the status quo as good, legitimate, and even desirable.

According to system justification theory, people desire not only to hold favorable attitudes about themselves (ego-justification) and the groups to which they belong (group-justification), but also to hold positive attitudes about the overarching social structure in which they are entwined and find themselves obligated to (system-justification). This system-justifying motive sometimes produces the phenomenon known as out-group favoritism, an acceptance of inferiority among low-status groups and a positive image of relatively higher status groups. Thus, the notion that individuals are simultaneously supporters and victims of the system-instilled norms is a central idea in system justification theory. Additionally, the passive ease of supporting the current structure, when compared to the potential price (material, social, psychological) of acting out against the status quo, leads to a shared environment in which the existing social, economic, and political arrangements tend to be preferred. Alternatives to the status quo tend to be disparaged, and inequality tends to perpetuate.&lt;ref name="jostbanaji1994"&gt;{{Cite journal

==Origins==
Previous social psychological theories that aimed to explain intergroup behavior typically focused on the tendencies for people to have positive attitudes about themselves (ego-justification) and their self-relevant groups (group-justification).&lt;ref name="Jost, Banaji, Nosek 2004" /&gt; In other words, people are motivated to engage in behaviors that allow for them to maintain a high self-esteem and a positive image of their group.&lt;ref name=Jost&amp;Hunyady2002&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jost|first=John T.|author2=Orsolya Hunyady |title=The psychology of system justification and the palliative function of ideology|journal=European Review of Social Psychology|year=2002|volume=13|pages=111–153|doi=10.1080/10463280240000046}}&lt;/ref&gt;
System Justification theory addressed the additional, prevalent phenomenon known as out-group favoritism, in which people defend the social systems (status quo) even when it does not benefit, and in the long-run may even cause more harm, to the individual or the group to which he or she belongs. Out-group favoritism can manifest as a dis-identification on the part of members of lower social status with their own categorical grouping (social, ethnic, economic, political) and instead further support for the existing structure. Prior social psychology theories lacked explanation for and attention given to popular instances of out-group favoritism; thus, SJT was developed to further explain and understand why some people tend to legitimize the prevailing social systems, despite their being against one's interests, in a way that previous social psychological theories did not.&lt;ref name=jostbanaji1994 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jost, Banaji, Nosek 2004" /&gt;

==Theoretical influences==
While [[Social Identity Theory]], [[Cognitive Dissonance|Cognitive Dissonance Theory]], [[Just-world hypothesis|Just-World Hypothesis]], [[Social Dominance Theory]], and [[false consciousness|Marxist-Feminists Theories of Ideologies]] have heavily influenced System Justification Theory, it has also expanded on these perspectives, infusing them with the system-justification motive and behaviors.

===Cognitive dissonance theory===
One of the most popular and well-known social psychological theories, [[cognitive dissonance|cognitive dissonance theory]] explains that people have a need to maintain cognitive consistency in order to retain a positive self-image.&lt;ref name="Jost&amp;Hunyady2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Jostetal2003&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jost|first=John T.|author2=Brett W. Pelham |author3=Oliver Sheldon |author4=Bilian Sullivan |title=Social inequality and the reduction of ideological dissonance on behalf of the system: evidence of enhanced system justification among the disadvantaged|journal=European Journal of Social Psychology|year=2003|volume=33|issue=1|pages=13–36|doi=10.1002/ejsp.127}}&lt;/ref&gt; System justification theory builds off the cognitive dissonance framework, in that it posits people will justify a social system in order to retain a positive image of that social system, due to the fact that they inherently play a role (whether passive or active) in perpetuating it.&lt;ref name="Jost, Banaji, Nosek 2004" /&gt;

===Social identity theory===
Jost and colleagues interpret [[social identity theory]] as suggesting that when people are presented with intergroup conflict that threatens their social group identities people will justify behaviors like [[stereotypes|stereotyping]] and [[discrimination]] against outgroups in order to maintain their positive group image.&lt;ref name="Jost&amp;Hunyady2002"/&gt; This interpretation has been rejected by social identity theorists,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1348/014466601164777|title=Social Identity Theory does not maintain that identification produces bias, and Self-categorization Theory does not maintain that salience is identification: Two comments on Mummendey, Klink and Brown|journal=British Journal of Social Psychology|volume=40|issue=2|pages=173–176|year=2001|last1=McGarty|first1=Craig|pmid=11446223}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

People with out-group favoritism will hold more positive images of other, often higher status, groups (outgroups) than the groups they belong to (ingroups). Thus, the argument is that system justification theory builds on the foundations of social identity theory in attempting to account for the out-group favoritism observed in many disadvantaged group members that social identity theory does not.&lt;ref name="Jost&amp;Hunyady2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jost 2001"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jost|first=John T.|chapter=Outgroup favoritism and the theory of system justification: A paradigm for investigating the effects of socioeconomic success on stereotype content|title=Cognitive Social Psychology: The Princeton Symposium on the Legacy and Future of Social Cognition|year=2001|pages=89–102 |chapter-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150907081147/http://www.psych.nyu.edu/jost/Jost%20(2001)%20Outgroup%20favoritism%20and%20the%20theory%20of%20system%20justification1.pdf |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DE-cJ8F4rSMC&amp;pg=PA89|editor-first=Gordon B. |editor-last=Moskowitz|isbn=9780805834147 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social dominance theory===
This theory has widely been compared to system justification theory since they are both system justifying theories. [[Social dominance theory]] focuses on people’s motive to maintain a positive group image by generally supporting hierarchical inequality at the group level. Individuals with a high social dominance orientation (SDO) will hold myths that tend to be hierarchy enhancing, which justify an in-group's place and their relation to it. Thus, in both social dominance theory and system justification theory, there are common threads of group-based opposition to equality and justification for maintaining intergroup inequalities through systemic norms.&lt;ref name="Jost&amp;Hunyady2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Rubin&amp;Hewstone&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mark|first=Rubin|author2=Miles Hewstone |title=Social Identity, System Justification, and Social Dominance: Commentary on Reicher, Jost et al., and Sidanius et al.|journal=Political Psychology|year=2004|volume=25|issue=6|pages=823–844|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9221.2004.00400.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Sidaniusetal2004&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sidanius|first=Jim|author2=Felicia Pratto |author3=Colette Van Laar |author4=Shana Levin |title=Social Dominance Theory: Its Agenda and Method|journal=Political Psychology|year=2004|volume=25|issue=6|pages=845–880|doi=10.1111/j.1467-9221.2004.00401.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Belief in a just world===
This [[Just-world theory|theory]] broadly explains that people are inclined to believe the world is generally fair, and that the outcomes of people’s behavior are subsequently deserved. Ideologies that relate to belief in a just world have to do with maintaining a sense of personal control and a desire to understand the world as non-random. Such ideologies include the protestant work ethic and belief in meritocracy. Essentially, belief in a just world feeds an epistemic need for predictability, order, and stability in one's environment. System justification theory, while keeping the perspective that people are inclined to believe the world is just, extracts the underlying epistemic needs of the just world ideology and uses them as support for why people are motivated to uphold the system. In other words, preference for stability, predictability, and the perception of personal control, over random chance, motivates one to see the status quo as fair and legitimate.&lt;ref name="Jost&amp;Hunyady2002"/&gt; This can be an issue, however, due to the fact that disadvantaged people can easily internalize their low position and blame themselves for 'shortcomings' or lack of 'successes.'

===False consciousness===
In order to account for the phenomenon of outgroup favoritism that is a main component of system justification, theorists have derived heavily from the Marxist-feminist theories on the prevailing ideologies as tools to preserve the system. In particular, the concept of [[false consciousness]], in which the dominant group in society believes their dominance to be destined, can help to inform why certain members of disadvantage groups sometimes engage in outgroup favoritism.&lt;ref name="Jost&amp;Hunyady2002"/&gt; Further, system justification emphasizes that those that lack means of material production (lower status) are subject to the ideas, (cultural values, legislation, and social teachings) of the dominant, controlling group.

==Aspects of system justification theory==

===Rationalization of the status quo===

One of the main aspects of [[system justification theory]] explains that people are motivated to justify the [[status quo]] and view it as stable and desirable. To this extent, theorists have provided specific [[hypotheses|hypothesis]] in which the rationalization of the status quo can manifest. One consequence of the system-justifying motivation, is the rationalization of desirability of likely versus less-likely events.

Since people will be inclined to make sure their preferences are congruent with the status quo, in situations of inevitability, people are more likely to endorse the status quo as a coping mechanism for dealing with unpleasant realities. In essence, people will judge events that are more likely as more desirable than events that are less likely.&lt;ref name=jostbanaji1994 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jost, Banaji, Nosek 2004" /&gt; Anticipatory rationalization studies completed during presidential election in 2000 demonstrate how future candidate endorsement and desirability is dependent on the likelihood of that candidate winning.  When subjects of both the Republican and Democratic parties were told, for example, that it was probable that one candidate would win over the other, people of both parties tended to rationalize support for the more likely winner. System justification for seemingly inevitable and unavoidable outcomes serves as a stress/dissonance reducer and provides psychological and emotional consolation, as well as allowing the individual to feel a sense of control over external events.

Another way people rationalize the [[status quo]] is through the use of [[stereotypes]]. When people perceive threats to the predominant system, they are more inclined to cling to and back the existing structure, and one way of doing so is by means of endorsing [[stereotypes]] that rationalize inequality. If one considers oneself a member of a higher social status group (economic standing, race, gender) he or she will hold favorable stereotypes about their group and less positive ones toward lower status outgroups. As perceived legitimacy of the system or threat to it increases, members of both disadvantaged and advantaged groups will be more motivated to utilize [[stereotypes]] as explanatory rationalizations (no matter how weak) for unequal status differences. Those that belong to disadvantaged groups will tend to associate positive characteristics (favorable stereotypes) to high status members and lead low status group members to minimize negative feelings about their low status.&lt;ref name="Jost, Banaji, Nosek 2004" /&gt; Thus, stereotype endorsement as system justification is consensual and holds a palliative function. This is true for both the ingroup and outgroup. Stereotypes also deflect blame of unfair status differences from the system and instead, attribute inequality to group traits or characteristics. Such rationalization for inequality via stereotyping is said to be what makes political conservatives happier than liberals. In a recent research study on the connection of system justification beliefs and [[ambivalent sexism]], researchers found that benevolent sexism beliefs related to higher [[life satisfaction]] through system justification. That is, both men and women may be motivated to hold benevolent sexism beliefs because such beliefs may help to promote the notion that the status quo is fair, which in turn can maintain life satisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.1177/0361684312456369|title = Why is Benevolent Sexism Appealing? Associations with System Justification and Life Satisfaction|journal = Psychology of Women Quarterly|volume = 36|issue = 4|pages = 432–443|year = 2012|last1 = Connelly|first1 = K.|last2 = Heesacker|first2 = M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Outgroup favoritism===
In contrast to [[ingroup favoritism]], which holds that people have a motivation to regard the social groups that they belong in more positively than other groups, outgroup favoritism is when people tend to regard groups to which they do not belong more positively than the groups to which they are members.&lt;ref name="Jost&amp;Hunyady2002"/&gt; System justification theorists argue that this is an example or manifestation of how some people have unconsciously absorbed, processed, and attempted to cope with existing inequalities—more specifically, one's own disadvantaged position in the social hierarchy. Because people have a tendency to justify the status quo (which usually consists of inequality among groups) and believe that it is fair and legitimate, certain people from low status groups will accept, internalize, and hence perpetuate that inequality.&lt;ref name="Jost, Banaji, Nosek 2004" /&gt;

Criticisms of outgroup favoritism have suggested observations of this in disadvantaged group members are simply manifestations of more general [[demand characteristics]] or [[social norms]] that encourage low status groups to evaluate other groups more positively.&lt;ref name="Jost, Banaji, Nosek 2004" /&gt; In response to this, system justification theorists introduced both implicit and explicit measures of outgroup favoritism. It was found that low status group members still exhibited outgroup favoritism (i.e. preference for other groups) on both implicit and explicit measures, and they displayed higher instances of outgroup favoritism on implicit measures than on explicit (self-reported) measures. In contrast, people from high status groups were found to display [[ingroup favoritism]] more on implicit measures.&lt;ref name="Jost, Banaji, Nosek 2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name=JostPelhamCarvallo&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jost|first=John|author2=Brett Pelham |author3=Mauricio Carvallo |title=Non-conscious forms of system justification: Implicit and behavioral preferences for higher status groups.|journal=Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|year=2002|volume=38|issue=6|pages=586–602|doi=10.1016/S0022-1031(02)00505-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, it is expected that when motivation to justify the system or status quo increases and it is perceived to be more legitimate, high status group members will also display increased [[ingroup favoritism]], while low status group members will display increased outgroup favoritism.&lt;ref name="Jost, Banaji, Nosek 2004" /&gt;
Researchers have also linked [[conservatism|political conservatism]] with system justification, in that conservatism is associated with upholding [[tradition]] and resistance to change, which is similar to justifying the status quo (or current state of social, political, and economic [[norm (social)|norm]]s). Along this vein, system justification theorists hold that high status group members will engage in increased [[ingroup favoritism]] the more politically conservative they are, while low status group members will display increased outgroup favoritism the more politically [[conservative]] they are.&lt;ref name="Jost, Banaji, Nosek 2004" /&gt;

===Depressed entitlement===
Research on [[Male–female income disparity in the United States|wage disparities]] among men and women have found that women often believe they are paid less than men because they do not deserve equal pay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hough|first=Mary|author2=Janice D. Yoder |title=The Role of Status in Producing Depressed Entitlement in Women's and Men's Pay Allocations|journal=Psychology of Women Quarterly|year=2003|volume=27|issue=4|pages=330–337|doi=10.1111/1471-6402.00113}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Major|first=Brenda|author2=Mark Zanna |chapter=From social inequality to personal entitlement: The role of social comparisons, legitimacy appraisals, and group membership|year=1994|volume=26|pages=293–355|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/psycinfo/2003-00371-006|doi=10.1016/s0065-2601(08)60156-2|title=Advances in Experimental Social Psychology|isbn=9780120152261}}&lt;/ref&gt; This depressed entitlement was first thought as the manifestation of women internalizing the low status of their gender compared to men. Subsequent research has found depressed entitlement occur across contexts in which gender was not a variable. System justification theorists have suggested that depressed entitlement is another general example of how individuals of low status groups absorb their inferiority in order to justify the [[status quo]].&lt;ref name="Jost&amp;Hunyady2002"/&gt; As such, system justification holds that low status group members regardless of context will be more likely to display instances of depressed entitlement than high status group members. And this will be seen more among low status group members for completed work as opposed to work not yet completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blanton|first=Hart|author2=Greg George |author3=Jennifer Crocker |title=Contexts of System Justification and System Evaluation: Exploring the Social Comparison Strategies of the (Not Yet) Contented Female Worker|journal=Group Processes and Intergroup Relations|year=2001|volume=4|issue=2|pages=126–137|doi=10.1177/1368430201004002004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ego, group, and system justification motives===
As previously stated, people are motivated by the desire for [[self-esteem|ego-justification]] and [[social identity|group-justification]] to view themselves and their group positively (which can manifest through feelings of [[self-esteem]] and value).&lt;ref name="Jost, Banaji, Nosek 2004" /&gt; The system-justification motive is people’s desire to view the system or status quo in a favorable light as legitimate and fair. Among high status group members, all three of these motives are congruent with one another. The need to believe the system is just and fair is easy for high status group members because they are the groups benefiting from the system and status quo. Therefore, as the advantaged groups, holding positive regard for the self and group corresponds readily with believing the status quo is legitimate.&lt;ref name="Jost&amp;Hunyady2002"/&gt;

In particular, as system justification motives increase for high status group members, ingroup [[ambivalence]] will decrease, levels of [[self-esteem]] will increase, and [[depression (mood)|depression]] and [[neuroticism]] levels will decrease.&lt;ref name="Jost, Banaji, Nosek 2004" /&gt; For low status groups, the [[self-esteem|ego-justification]] and [[social identity|group-justification]] motives come into conflict with the system-justification motive. If low status group members have a desire to believe the status quo and prevailing system is fair and legitimate, then this would conflict with the motivation of these individuals to maintain positive self and group images. Theorists posit that this conflict of justification motives creates conflicting or [[ambivalence|mixed attitudes]] in low status groups as a result of being the disadvantaged group that does not necessarily benefit from the status quo.&lt;ref name="Jost&amp;Hunyady2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jost 2000 293–305"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jost|first=John|author2=Diana Burgess |title=Attitudinal Ambivalence and the Conflict between Group and System Justification Motives in Low Status Groups|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|year=2000|volume=26|issue=3|pages=293–305|doi=10.1177/0146167200265003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As system justification motives increase for low status group members, ingroup [[ambivalence]] will increase and occur at stronger levels compared to high status groups, levels of [[self-esteem]] will decrease, and [[depression (mood)|depression]] and [[neuroticism]] levels will increase. Moreover, researchers suggest that when ego and group justification motives are particularly decreased, system-justification motives will increase.&lt;ref name="Jost 2000 293–305"/&gt;

===Enhanced system justification among the disadvantaged===
Based on [[cognitive dissonance theory]] that holds people have a need to reduce dissonance and maintain cognitive consistency, system justification theory explains that people are motivated to rationalize and justify instances of inequality in order to preserve and defend the legitimacy of the system.&lt;ref name="Jost&amp;Hunyady2002"/&gt; Because people have this need to believe the current prevailing system is legitimate and the way it is for a reason, when presented with instances where this might threaten that, people will respond with more justifications to maintain the legitimacy of the system or status quo. Since high status group members regularly benefit from the prevailing system, they are expected to rarely be presented with examples that would threaten the legitimacy of the system. In contrast, it is expected that low status group members who do not benefit from the system, would be presented more regularly with threats to the legitimacy of the system and status quo. Thus, it is expected for system justification tendencies to increase in societies with more substantial group inequalities, and low status group members will be more inclined than high status group members to provide more intense justifications to rationalize and uphold the prevailing systems and status quo.&lt;ref name="Jost, Banaji, Nosek 2004" /&gt;

===Compensatory stereotypes===
Research has found that [[stereotypes|compensatory stereotypes]] might lead to increased justification of the status quo. That is, [[stereotypes]] that have components that would offset the negative aspects of the stereotypes would allow people to more easily explain or justify the inequality of the prevailing system.&lt;ref name="Jost, Banaji, Nosek 2004" /&gt; One of the more common examples is the compensatory stereotype of “poor but happy” or “rich but miserable.”&lt;ref name=KayJost2003&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kay|first=Aaron|author2=John Jost |title=Complementary Justice: Effects of "Poor but Happy" and "Poor but Honest" Stereotype Exemplars on System Justification and Implicit Activation of the Justice Motive|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=2003|volume=85|issue=5|pages=823–837|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.85.5.823|pmid=14599247}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Stereotypes like these that incorporate a positive aspect to counterbalance the negative aspect would lead people to increase their justification of the status quo. Other findings suggested that these compensatory stereotypes are preferred by those with more left leaning [[political ideologies]], while those with more right leaning [[political ideologies]] preferred non-complimentary stereotypes that simply rationalized [[Social inequality|inequality]] rather than compensated for it.&lt;ref name="Kay Jost2009"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Left–right ideological differences in system justification following exposure to complementary versus noncomplementary stereotype exemplars|journal=European Journal of Social Psychology|year=2009|volume=39|issue=2|pages=290–298|doi=10.1002/ejsp.500|last1=Kay|first1=Aaron C.|last2=Czapliński|first2=Szymon|last3=Jost|first3=John T.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  But that overall, [[conservatives]] were more likely to have increased system justification tendencies than [[Liberalism|liberals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jost|first=John|author2=Brian A. Nosek |author3=Samuel D. Gosling |title=Ideology: Its Resurgence in Social, Personality, and Political Psychology|journal=Perspectives on Psychological Science|year=2008|volume=3|issue=2|pages=126–136|doi=10.1111/j.1745-6916.2008.00070.x|pmid=26158879}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jost|first=John|author2=Jack Glaser |author3=Arie W.Kruglanski |author4=Frank Sulloway |title=Political Conservatism as Motivated Social Cognition|journal=Psychological Bulletin|year=2003|volume=129|issue=3|pages=339–375|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.129.3.339|pmid=12784934}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Consequences of system justification==
Consequences of people’s motivation to legitimize the status quo are wide-ranging. In needing to believe that the current or prevailing systems are fair and just, results in people justifying the existing inequalities within it.&lt;ref name="Jost, Banaji, Nosek 2004" /&gt; Research on system justification theory has been applied to many different social and political contexts that have found the theory has implications for general [[social change]], social policies, and specific [[communities]].
Research has found that people with increased system justification motives are more resistant to change, and thus an implication of this would be greater difficulty to move towards [[policy|policies]], [[governments]], [[authority]] figures, and [[hierarchies]] that reflect [[Social equality|equality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Blasi|first=Gary|author2=John Jost |title=System Justification Theory and Research: Implications for Law, Legal Advocacy, and Social Justice|journal=California Law Review|year=2006|volume=94|issue=4|pages=1119–1168|jstor=20439060|doi=10.2307/20439060}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research suggests that system justification motives reduce emotional distress in people that would otherwise result in demands for amendments to perceived [[injustices]] or inequalities. Specifically, [[moral outrage]], guilt, and [[frustration]] are reduced when system justification motives increase. This has shown to result in less support for social policies that redistribute resources in the aim for [[Social equality|equality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jost|first=John|author2=Orsola Hunyady |title=ecedents and Consequences of System-Justifying Ideologies|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|year=2005|volume=14|issue=5|pages=260–265|doi=10.1111/j.0963-7214.2005.00377.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wakslak|first=Cheryl|author2=John T.

In developing countries, in which group inequalities are most evident, researchers were interested in testing the claim of system justification theory that when inequalities are more visible, this will result in greater justification of the status quo.&lt;ref name="Henry 2006 365–378"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Henry|first=PJ|author2=Andrea Saul |title=The Development of System Justification in the Developing World|journal=Social Justice Research|year=2006|volume=19|issue=3|pages=365–378|doi=10.1007/s11211-006-0012-x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers visited the most impoverished areas of [[Bolivia]], and found that among children (aged 10–15) who were members of low status groups, legitimized the [[Bolivian government]] as sufficiently meeting the needs of the people more than children from high status groups. Observing system-justification motives in low status groups located in one of the most impoverished countries implies there will be less support for [[social change]] in a country that arguable needs it the most.&lt;ref name="Henry 2006 365–378"/&gt;

In the aftermath of [[Hurricane Katrina]] in 2005, there were different reactions to the devastation it brought to communities as well as the government’s [[Federal Emergency Management Agency|relief efforts]]. Researchers who have studied these reactions, found that the slow and inefficient response of [[Federal Emergency Management Agency|relief efforts]] were perceived by some to expose “governmental shortcomings, call into question the legitimacy of agency leadership, and highlight [[racial inequality]] in [[United States of America|America]].”&lt;ref name="Napier 2006 57–73"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Napier|first=Jaime L.|author2=Anesu N. Mandisodza |author3=Susan M. Andersen |author4=John T. Jost |title=System Justification in Responding to the Poor and Displaced in the Aftermath of Hurricane Katrina|journal=Analyses of Social Issues and Public Policy|year=2006|volume=6|issue=1|pages=57–73|doi=10.1111/j.1530-2415.2006.00102.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; These perceptions indirectly brought a threat to the legitimacy of the U.S. government (i.e. the system). As a result of this system threat, researchers found that people tended to restore legitimacy to the system through utilizing [[stereotypes]] and [[victim blaming]].&lt;ref name="Jost, Banaji, Nosek 2004" /&gt;  In particular, since the majority of the communities affected by [[Hurricane Katrina]] were generally low-income and composed mostly of [[minorities]], some people used [[stereotypes]] to blame the victims for their misfortune and restore legitimacy to the [[government]].&lt;ref name="Napier 2006 57–73"/&gt; Researchers explained how this could have consequences for the victims and restoring their homes and communities back to normal. Increased system justification, and increased victim blaming could be detrimental in providing the victims the resources needed to work towards repairing the damage caused by [[Hurricane Katrina]].&lt;ref name="Napier 2006 57–73"/&gt;

==Critiques==

===Social identity theory debate===
This debate arose from [[social identity]] theorists countering a critique to the theory by system justification theorists. The critique by system justification theorists refers to the evidence for the theoretical conception of system justification theory that derived from limitations to [[social identity theory]].&lt;ref name="Jost, Banaji, Nosek 2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Jost&amp;Hunyady2002"/&gt; System justification theorists have stated that Social Identity Theory does not account for outgroup favoritism, and that the limitations of the theory only lend it to measure [[ingroup favoritism]]. Advocates for [[social identity theory]] claim that this critique is more a result of lack of research done that has focused on outgroup favoritism rather than a limitation of the theoretical framework.&lt;ref name="Rubin&amp;Hewstone"/&gt; Moreover, social identity theorists also claim this is not sufficient evidence for the need of system justification and [[Social Dominance Theory|social dominance]] theories to help account for justification motives. As such, they have claimed that research that measures outgroup favoritism from a social identity perspective is simply needed to bolster the theory. While both theories continue to produce findings, the debate continues to be discussed.&lt;ref name="Rubin&amp;Hewstone"/&gt;

===Relation to status quo bias===
Another critique is that SJT is too similar and indistinguishable to [[status quo bias]]. Given that both deal directly with upholding and legitimizing the status quo, this critique is not unfounded. But system justification theory differs from the [[status quo bias]] in that it is predominately [[motivational]] rather than [[cognitive]]. Generally, the status quo bias refers to a tendency to prefer the default or established option when making choices. In contrast, system justification posits that people need and want to see prevailing social systems as fair and just. The motivational component of system justification means that its effects are exacerbated when people are under psychological threat or when they feel their outcomes are especially dependent on the system that is being justified.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==Current research==
Congruent with a broader trend toward [[neuroscience]], current research on system justification has tested to see how this manifests in the [[brain]].

It was dedicated to [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] and is largely a treatise on how to properly train statesmen. It also discusses ethical dilemmas in the education system of the time. ''The Book of the Governor'' is evidence of the impact that [[Renaissance humanism]] had on prose writing.

== Thomas Elyot ==
[[File:Sir Thomas Elyot by Hans Holbein the Younger.jpg|thumb|Holbein Sir Thomas Elyot]]
Thomas Elyot was born before 1490 and died in 1546.  He was the son of Sir Richard Elyot and Alice Fynderne.  His father was a prominent lawyer, so Thomas received a quality education.  Both [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] and [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] claim him as an alumnus, but there is no sufficient evidence either way. He studied mostly liberal arts and philosophy, but also some medicine. In 1510 he married Margaret Aborough. In 1530 he was [[knight]]ed. In 1531, he was made ambassador to the Emperor, [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]].  In 1538 he published the first Latin-English dictionary. As a writer, he is clear, precise, measured, and practically monotonous. His major works include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carlton-cambridgeshire.org.uk/History/People/sir_thomas_elyot.htm |title=Sir Thomas Elyot |publisher=Carlton-cambridgeshire.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''The Boke named the Governour'' (1531)
*''Of the Knowledge which maketh a Wise Man'' (1533)
*''The Education of Children, translated out of Plutarch'' (1535)
*''Dictionary'' (1538)
*''The Castle of Helth'' (1539)
*''The Defence of Good Women'' (1540)

''The Boke named the Governour'' is considered to be the first educational treatise in English.  It sets out the way of life for member of the English governing class.  Between 1531 and 1580, the book went through seven different editions. According to Biblio.com,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=ELYOT, Sir Thomas [1490?-1546] |url=http://www.biblio.com/books/276879441.html |title=The Boke Named The Governour By Sir Thomas [1490?-1546&amp;#93; ELYOT - Used Books - 1557 - from D &amp; E Lake Ltd. (ABAC, ILAB) and |publisher=Biblio.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Book of the Governor "went through edition after edition all through the sixteenth century. It achieved this fame for many reasons. It is the first work in recognizably modern English [[prose]], to which Elyot added many new words. It provided influential advocacy for the study of the classics, from which he quotes extensively. the principal cause of its popularity was the current vogue for its subject – it is a treatise on moral philosophy, laying down the lines on which the education of those destined to govern should be directed, and inculcating the high moral principles which should rule them in the performance of their duties. There was nothing very original or revolutionary in the thoughts expressed: Elyot acknowledges his debt to the ''Institutio Principis Christiani'' of Erasmus and Castiglione’s ''Il Cortegiano'', though not that to Francesco Patrizzi, Bishop of Gaeta at the end of the fifteenth century, whose ''De Rego et Regis Institutione'' was certainly the model for ''The Governour''. Nevertheless it remained a textbook for behaviour for generations and had a lasting effect on the writing of English."

== Humanism ==
Elyot wrote his book at the beginning of English Renaissance humanism. During this time, "humanists were distinguished from other scholars not by exclusive focus on human or secular texts, but rather by their focus on secular writings, particularly classical ones, ''as well as'' on religious texts and thoughts".&lt;ref&gt;Black, Joseph. The Renaissance and the Early Seventeenth Century. 2nd ed. Vol. 2. Peterborough, Ont.: Broadview, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;  It was during this time that the [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] classics were finally coming back. This is the time when [[Plato]] played a significant role in philosophical history.  Renaissance humanism also introduced a new richness in the English language – writers began to use rhetoric, and language was viewed as a worthy subject to study. This is why Elyot's book became so popular not only with the people, but also the King.

A philosophical [[treatise]], the book was first published in Germany in 1894 after being banned in his home country of Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Cambridge Companion to Tolstoy |author=Donna Tussing Orwin|year= 2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|url= https://books.google.com/books?visbn=0-521-52000-2&amp;id=nU2lErM3VgwC&amp;pg=PA31&amp;lpg=PA31&amp;ots=534OYUN5hf&amp;dq=tolstoy+%22The+Kingdom+of+God+Is+Within+You%22+-intitle:%22The+Kingdom+of+God+Is+Within+You%22&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;output=html&amp;sig=ueC-a5IetQUdjapJ3e1UmotOqtU|isbn=0-521-52000-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the culmination of thirty years of Tolstoy's thinking, and lays out a new organization for society based on an interpretation of Christianity focusing on universal love.

''The Kingdom of God is Within You'' is a key text for [[Tolstoyan]] proponents of [[nonviolence]], of [[nonviolent resistance]], and of the [[Christian anarchism|Christian anarchist]] movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Christian Anarchism: A Political Commentary on the Gospel |last=Christoyannopoulos |first=Alexandre |authorlink=Alexandre Christoyannopoulos |coauthors= |year=2010 |publisher=Imprint Academic |location=Exeter |isbn= |page=19 |pages= |url= |accessdate= |quote=[Tolstoy] wrote countless essays and books on the topic, but the most often cited one among anarchists is ''The Kingdom of God Is within You''.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[Image:Lev tolstoi carstvo bozhie vnutri vas.jpg|thumb|The 1st edition of ''The Kingdom of God Is Within You'', 1894.]]
The title of the book is taken from [[Gospel of Luke|Luke 17:21]].  In the book Tolstoy speaks of the principle of [[nonviolent resistance]] when confronted by violence, as taught by [[Jesus Christ]]. When Christ says to [[turn the other cheek]], Tolstoy asserts that Christ means to abolish violence, even the defensive kind, and to give up  [[revenge]]. Tolstoy rejects the interpretation of Roman and medieval scholars who attempted to limit its scope.

{{quote|“How can you kill people, when it is written in God’s commandment: ‘Thou shalt not murder’?”}}

Tolstoy took the viewpoint that all governments who waged war are an affront to Christian principles. As the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] was—at the time—an [[state church|organization merged with the Russian state]] and fully supporting state's policy, Tolstoy sought to separate its teachings from what he believed to be the true [[gospel]] of Christ, specifically the [[Sermon on the Mount]].

Tolstoy advocated [[nonviolence]] as a solution to [[nationalist]] woes and as a means for seeing the hypocrisy of the church. In reading Jesus' words in the Gospels, Tolstoy notes that the modern church is a [[heretical]] creation:

{{quote|“Nowhere nor in anything, except in the assertion of the Church, can we find that God or Christ founded anything like what churchmen understand by the Church.”}}

Tolstoy presented excerpts from magazines and newspapers relating various personal experiences, and gave keen insight into the history of non-resistance from the very foundation of [[Christianity]], as being professed by a minority of believers. In particular, he confronts those who seek to maintain ''status quo'':

{{quote|“That this social order with its pauperism, famines, prisons, gallows, armies, and wars is necessary to society; that still greater disaster would ensue if this organization were destroyed; all this is said only by those who profit by this organization, while those who suffer from it – and they are ten times as numerous – think and say quite the contrary.”}}

In 1894 [[Constance Garnett]], who translated the work into [[English language|English]], wrote the following in her translator's preface:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Cassell Publishing Company| last = Tolstoy| first = graf Leo| title = "The Kingdom of God is Within You": Christianity Not as a Mystic Religion But as a New Theory of Life| date = 1894}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;"One cannot of course anticipate that English people, slow as they are to be influenced by ideas, and instinctively distrustful of all that is logical, will take a leap in the dark and attempt to put Tolstoi's theory of life into practice. But one may at least be sure that his destructive critcism of the present social and political regime will become a powerful force in the work of distintegration and social reconstruction which is going on around us."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Reception==

===Tolstoy's relationship with Mohandas Gandhi===
[[File:Gandhi Tolstoy Farm.jpg|thumb|left|Mohandas K. Gandhi and other residents of Tolstoy Farm (a colony established as part of the [[Tolstoyan movement]]), South Africa, 1910]]
[[Mohandas Gandhi]] wrote in his autobiography ''[[The Story of My Experiments with Truth]]'' ([[wikisource:The Story of My Experiments with Truth/Part II/Religious Ferment|Part II, Chapter 15]]) that this book "overwhelmed" him and "left an abiding impression." Gandhi listed Tolstoy's book, as well as [[John Ruskin]]'s ''[[Unto This Last]]'' and the poet [[Shrimad Rajchandra]] (Raychandbhai), as the three most important modern influences in his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= The Story of My Experiments with Truth|author= Mohandas K. Gandhi|year= 1929|url= http://www.nalanda.nitc.ac.in/resources/english/etext-project/Biography/gandhi/part2.chapter1.html|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100801050423/http://www.nalanda.nitc.ac.in/resources/english/etext-project/Biography/gandhi/part2.chapter1.html|archivedate= 2010-08-01|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Reading this book opened up the mind of the world-famous Tolstoy to Gandhi, who was still a young protester living in South Africa at the time.

In 1908 Tolstoy wrote, and Gandhi read, ''[[A Letter to a Hindu]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

 |accessdate=2012-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; which outlines the notion that only by using love as a weapon through [[passive resistance]] could the native Indian people overthrow the colonial British Empire. This idea ultimately came to fruition through Gandhi's organization of nationwide [[nonviolent]] [[Strike action|strikes]] and protests during the years 1918–1947.  In 1909, Gandhi wrote to Tolstoy seeking advice and permission to republish ''A Letter to a Hindu'' in his native language, [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]]. Tolstoy responded and the two continued a correspondence until Tolstoy's death a year later in 1910. The letters concern practical and theological applications of nonviolence, as well as Gandhi's wishes for Tolstoy's health. Tolstoy's last letter to Gandhi "was one of the last, if not the last, writings from his pen." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mahatma Gandhi and Leo Tolstoy: Letters |editor=B.

===With other nonviolent activists===
''The Kingdom of God is Within You'' also had a great effect upon [[James Bevel]], a major 1960s strategist of the civil rights movement.&lt;ref&gt;Randall L. Kryn, "James L. Bevel; The Strategist of the 1960s Civil Rights Movement", in [[David Garrow]], ''We Shall Overcome, Volume II'' (1989), Carlson Publishing Company&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cfm40.middlebury.edu/node/287 Randy Kryn, "Movement Revision Research Summary Regarding James Bevel"], October 2005, [[Middlebury College]]&lt;/ref&gt; After reading the book while serving in the U.S. Navy, Bevel came to the conclusion that he would be unable to kill another person. He thereafter sought and was granted an honorable discharge, and entered a seminary for religious training.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Rv-8E76FZWkC&amp;pg=PT806&amp;lpg=PT806&amp;dq=%22James+Bevel%22+Tolstoy+%22The+Children%22+Halberstam&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=9l2rfUvjVP&amp;sig=4g6zeuU3_WpEkEjXYKnsZKQYs9E&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwil_abN9fDaAhVo5YMKHV0wA0wQ6AEILTAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%22James%20Bevel%22%20Tolstoy%20%22The%20Children%22%20Halberstam&amp;f=false ''The Children'', 1999, David Halberstam]&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''The captain goes down with the ship'''" is an [[idiom]] and maritime tradition that a [[sea captain]] holds ultimate responsibility for both his ship and everyone embarked on it, and that in an emergency, he will either save them or die trying. Although often connected to the [[Sinking of the RMS Titanic|sinking of the RMS ''Titanic'']] in 1912 and its captain, [[Edward Smith (sea captain)|Edward J. Smith]], the phrase precedes ''Titanic'' by at least 11 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=John |first=Alix |title=The Night-hawk: A Romance of the '60s|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DrUXAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=%22captain%20goes%20down%20with%20his%20ship%22&amp;pg=PA249#v=onepage&amp;q=%22captain%20goes%20down%20with%20his%20ship%22&amp;f=false |date=1901 |publisher=Frederick A. Stokes |location=New York |pages=249 |quote=...for, if anything goes wrong a woman may be saved where a captain goes down with his ship.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In most instances, the captain of the ship forgoes his own rapid departure of a ship in distress, and concentrates instead on saving other people. It often results in either the death or belated rescue of the captain as the last person on board.

==History==
The concept is closely related to another protocol from the nineteenth century, "[[women and children first]]." Both reflect the Victorian ideal of [[chivalry]] in which the upper classes were expected to emulate a morality tied to sacred honour, service, and respect for the disadvantaged. The actions of the captain and men during the sinking of {{HMS|Birkenhead|1845|6}} in 1852 prompted praise from many due to the sacrifice of the men who saved the women and children by evacuating them first. [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s poem "Soldier an' Sailor Too" and [[Samuel Smiles]]' ''[[Self-Help (book)|Self-Help]]'' both highlighted the valour of the men who stood at attention and played in the band as their ship was sinking.

==Social and legal responsibility==
The idiom literally means that a captain will be the last person to leave a ship alive before its sinking or utter destruction, and if unable to evacuate the crew and passengers, the captain will not save himself even if he can.&lt;ref name=bbc2012&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-16611371 |title=Must a captain be the  one off a sinking ship? |work=[[BBC News]] |date=18 January 2012 |accessdate=6 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a social context, especially as a [[mariner]], the captain will feel compelled to take this responsibility as a type of [[Norm (social)|social norm]]. Shirking this responsibility in a crisis would go against societal [[mores]] because of the offender's lack of [[ethics]].

In [[maritime law]], the ship's master's responsibility for his vessel is paramount no matter what its condition, so abandoning a ship has legal consequences, including the nature of [[salvage rights]]. So even if a captain abandons his ship in distress, he is generally responsible for it in his absence and would be compelled to return to the ship until danger to the vessel has relented. If a naval captain evacuates a vessel in wartime, it may be considered a [[capital offence]] similar to desertion unless he subsequently returns to the ship at his first opportunity to prevent its capture and rescue the crew.

Abandoning a ship in distress may be considered a crime that can lead to imprisonment.&lt;ref name=bbc2012 /&gt; Captain [[Francesco Schettino]], who left his ship in the midst of the [[Costa Concordia disaster|''Costa Concordia'' disaster]], was not only widely reviled for his actions, but lost his final appeal against his 16-year Italian prison sentence including one year for abandoning his passengers, five years for causing the shipwreck, and ten years for manslaughter of its victims.

*May 30, 1918: When the Italian [[Steamship|steamer]] ''Pietro Maroncelli'' was torpedoed by the German submarine [[SM UB-49|''UB 49'']] and started to sink, Italian Rear Admiral Giovanni Viglione, who was on board as the convoy commodore, ordered all the survivors into the lifeboats, then chose to stay aboard and to go down with the ship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uboat.net/wwi/ships_hit/4800.html Steamer Pietro Maroncelli - Uboat.net]&lt;/ref&gt;
*November 1, 1918: In the last days of [[Adriatic Campaign of World War I|World War I]], [[Croat]]ian [[Rear admiral]] [[Janko Vuković]], the first day he was appointed fleet commander, chose to go down with his [[flagship]] {{SMS|Viribus Unitis}} in [[Pula]] harbor as [[Kingdom of Italy|Italian]] frogmen sank it with two 200-kg mines.
*November 23, 1939. [[HMS Rawalpindi|HMS ''Rawalpindi'']], a British armed merchant cruiser (a converted passenger ship) encountered  the German battleships ''[[German battleship Scharnhorst|Scharnhorst]]'' and ''[[German battleship Gneisenau|Gneisenau]]'' north of the [[Faroe Islands]]. Her captain, [[Edward Coverley Kennedy]], despite being hopelessly outgunned, ordered an attack. He went down with his ship.
*June 27, 1940. When [[Italian submarine Console Generale Liuzzi|Italian submarine ''Console Generale Liuzzi'']] was forced to surface by British destroyers in the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]], her commanding officer, Lieutenant Commander Lorenzo Bezzi, ordered his crew to abandon ship and then scuttled the submarine, going down with it.
*October 21, 1940. During the [[Attack on convoy BN 7|Battle of Harmil Island]], Italian destroyer ''Francesco Nullo'' was fatally damaged by [[HMS Kimberley (F50)|HMS ''Kimberley'']]. Her commanding officer, Lieutenant Commander [[Costantino Borsini]], chose to go down with his ship; seaman Vincenzo Ciaravolo, his attendant, chose to follow him.
*November 5, 1940. German pocket battleship ''[[German cruiser Admiral Scheer|Admiral Scheer]]'' encountered Allied [[Convoy HX 84]] in the North Atlantic. The convoy consisted of 38 merchant ships escorted by [[HMS Jervis Bay|HMS ''Jervis Bay'']], an ocean liner newly armed with guns of 1890s design. Her captain, [[Edward Fegen]] [[Victoria Cross|VC]], signalled the convoy to scatter, and attacked the enemy. ''Jervis Bay'' was hopelessly outranged and outgunned, and was sunk; her captain and many of her crew went down with her. The sacrifice bought enough time for 31 of the convoy to make it to safety.
*May 24, 1941: During the [[Battle of the Denmark Strait]], [[HMS Hood|HMS ''Hood'']] suffered a direct hit and magazine explosion, which sank the ship in three minutes. Only three people survived the disaster. One of the survivors, [[Ted Briggs]], said in interviews after the sinking that [[Lancelot Holland|Admiral Holland]] was last seen sitting in his chair, making no attempt to escape from the sinking ship. 
*May 27, 1941: Captain [[Ernst Lindemann]] of the [[German battleship Bismarck|''Bismarck'']] was said to be with his combat messenger, a leading seaman, and apparently trying to persuade his messenger to save himself. In this account, his messenger took Lindemann's hand and the two walked to the forward flagmast. As the ship turned over, the two stood briefly to attention, then Lindemann and his messenger saluted. As the ship rolled to port, the messenger fell into the water. Lindemann continued his salute while clinging to the flagmast, going down with the ship.&lt;ref&gt;Grützner 2010, p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McGowen 1999, pp. 58–59.&lt;/ref&gt;
*December 10, 1941: Admiral Sir [[Tom Phillips (Royal Navy officer)|Tom Phillips]] and Captain [[John Leach (Royal Navy officer)|John Leach]] both went down with the [[HMS Prince of Wales (53)|Prince of Wales]] during [[sinking of Prince of Wales and Repulse|its sinking along with the Repulse]] by Japanese warplanes off the coast of [[Pahang]], [[British Malaya]].
*February 28, 1942: [[Schout-bij-nacht|Rear Admiral]] [[Karel Doorman]] was killed in action when his flagship {{HNLMS|De Ruyter|1935|6}} was torpedoed in the [[Battle of the Java Sea]]. Part of the crew was rescued before the sinking, but the Dutch admiral chose to go down with the ship. Captain Lieutenant [[Eugène Lacomblé]] also died in the sinking.
*June 5, 1942: Rear Admiral [[Tamon Yamaguchi]], on board the aircraft carrier [[Japanese aircraft carrier Hiryu|''Hiryu'']], insisted on staying with the stricken ship during the [[Battle of Midway]]. The ship's commander, Captain Kaku, followed his example.  In addition, Captain [[Ryusaku Yanagimoto]] chose to remain with his ship [[Japanese aircraft carrier Sōryū|''Sōryū'']] when it was scuttled after being destroyed in the same battle.
*February 7, 1943: Commander [[Howard W. Gilmore]], captain of the American submarine {{USS|Growler|SS-215|6}}, gave the order to "clear the bridge," as his crew was being attacked by a Japanese gunboat. Two men had been shot dead; Gilmore and two others were wounded. After all others had entered the sub and Gilmore found that time was critically short, he gave his [[last words|last order]]: "Take her down." The executive officer, hearing his order, closed the hatch and submerged the crippled boat, saving the rest of the crew from the attack of the Japanese convoy escort. Commander Gilmore, who was never seen again, received the [[Medal of Honor]] posthumously for his "distinguished gallantry," making him the second submariner to receive this award.
*November 19,1943: Captain [[John P. Cromwell]] went down on the sinking sub [[USS Sculpin (SS-191)|USS ''Sculpin'']].
*October 24, 1944: Admiral Inoguchi Toshihira&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://ww2db.com/person_bio.php?person_id=308 |title=Toshihira Inoguchi |work=World War II Database |year=2015 |accessdate=6 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; chose to go down with the [[Japanese battleship Musashi|Japanese battleship ''Musashi'']], during the [[Battle of Leyte Gulf]], even though he could have escaped.  Over half of the ship's crew, 1376 of 2399, were rescued.
*April 7, 1945: Admiral [[Seiichi Ito]], the fleet admiral, and Captain [[Kosaku Aruga]] went down with the [[Japanese battleship Yamato|Japanese battleship ''Yamato'']] during [[Operation Ten-Go]].
* December 30, 1950: [[Luis González de Ubieta]] (born 1899), [[exile]]d Admiral of the [[Spanish Republican Navy]], went down with his ship. He refused to be rescued when the ''Chiriqui'', a merchant vessel under his command, sank in the [[Caribbean Sea]] not far from [[Barranquilla]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Javier  (coord.) |last=García Fernández |title=25 militares de la República; "El Ejército Popular de la República y sus mandos profesionales |publisher=Ministerio de Defensa |location=Madrid |year=2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*December 9, 1971: [[Mahendra Nath Mulla]] [[Maha Vir Chakra|MVC]] the captain of the Indian frigate {{INS|Khukri|1958|6}}, went down with the ship after it was attacked by a submarine in the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971]]. At least 194 members of the crew died in the sinking, which reportedly took two minutes.
*October 29, 2012: Captain Robin Walbridge of the ''[[Bounty (1960 ship)|Bounty]]'', a replica of {{HMS|Bounty}}, stayed on the ship until it [[capsized]] during [[Hurricane Sandy]]. Fourteen crew members who made it to liferafts survived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://thechronicleherald.ca/novascotia/696424-witness-recounts-claudene-christian%E2%80%99s-last-minutes-on-bounty |title=Witness recounts Claudene Christian’s last minutes on ''Bounty'' |first=Beverley |last=Ware |work=[[The Chronicle Herald]] |location=[[Halifax, Nova Scotia]] |date=15 February 2013 |accessdate=6 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*October 2, 2015:  Captain Michael Davidson, master of the cargo ship [[SS El Faro|El Faro]] was recorded on the Voyage Data Recorder encouraging the ship's helmsman, frozen by fear and exhaustion, to join him in abandoning the vessel, before the recording ended with both still on the bridge of the sinking ship.

==Counter-examples==
In some cases the captain may choose to [[Scuttling|scuttle]] the ship and escape danger rather than die as it sinks. This choice is usually only available if the damage does not immediately imperil a vast portion of the ship's company and occupants. If a [[distress call]] was successful and the crew and occupants, the ship's cargo, and other items of interest are rescued, then the vessel may not be worth anything as [[marine salvage]] and allowed to sink. In other cases a military organization or [[navy]] might wish to destroy a ship to prevent it being taken as a [[prize (law)|prize]] or captured for [[espionage]], such as occurred in the {{USS|Pueblo|AGER-2|6}} incident. Commodities and war [[material]] carried as [[cargo]] might also need to be destroyed to prevent capture by the opposing side.

In other cases a captain may decide to save himself to the detriment of his crew, the vessel, or its mission. A decision that shirks the responsibilities of the command of a vessel will usually bring upon the captain a legal, criminal, or social penalty, with military commanders often facing dishonor.

*July 17, 1880: The captain and crew of the {{SS|Jeddah}} abandoned the ship and their passengers in a storm expecting it would sink, but the ship was found with all passengers alive two weeks later. A key part of [[Joseph Conrad]]'s 1899-1900 novel ''[[Lord Jim]]'' is based on this incident; Conrad had been a captain in the merchant marine before turning to writing.
*August 4, 1906: Captain Giuseppe Piccone abandoned the {{SS|Sirio}} at the first opportunity. Between 150 and 400 people died when the ship sank.
*July 30 1945: The {{USS|Indianapolis|CA-35|6}} was torpedoed and sunk by a Japanese submarine. Captain [[Charles B. McVay III]] managed to survive in shark-infested waters for three days before the survivors were discovered, and later became the only captain in the history of the U.S. Navy to face court-martial for his ship being sunk by enemy action. He committed suicide on November 6, 1968, and was cleared of wrongdoing by the Secretary of the Navy in 2001.
*November 12, 1965: When a fire broke out aboard the {{SS|Yarmouth Castle}}, Captain Byron Voustinas was on the first lifeboat, which had only crew and no passengers aboard. 90 people died.
*April 7, 1990: Having been erroneously informed the ship was evacuated, Captain Hugo Larsen abandoned the {{MS|Scandinavian Star}} after arson caused the ship to burn. 158 people died.
*August 3–4, 1991: Captain [[Yiannis Avranas]] of the cruise ship [[MTS Oceanos|MTS ''Oceanos'']] abandoned ship without informing passengers that the ship was sinking. All passengers survived. A Greek board of inquiry found Avranas and four officers negligent in their handling of the disaster.
*January 13, 2012: Captain [[Francesco Schettino]] abandoned ship during the [[Costa Concordia disaster|''Costa Concordia'' disaster]]. 32 people died in the accident. Schettino was sentenced to 16 years in prison for his role in the disaster. 
*April 16, 2014: Captain Lee Joon-seok abandoned the South Korean ferry [[Sinking of the MV Sewol|MV ''Sewol'']]. The captain and much of the crew were saved, while hundreds of students from [[Danwon High School]] embarked for their trip remained in their cabins, according to instructions provided by the crew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=참사 2주째 승무원도 제대로 파악 안돼 |trans-title=Exact Number of Crew still not known 2 weeks after the ferry disaster |url=http://www.hani.co.kr/arti/society/society_general/634984.html |accessdate=3 May 2014 |newspaper=[[The Hankyoreh]] |date=20 April 2014 |language=Korean}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=drewmouawad/&gt; Many passengers apparently remained on the sinking vessel and died. Following this incident, the captain was arrested and put on trial beginning in early June 2014, when video footage filmed by some survivors and news broadcasters showed him being rescued by a coast guard vessel. Orders to abandon ship never came, and the vessel sank with all [[life raft]]s still in their stowage position. The captain was subsequently sentenced to 36 years in prison for his role in the deaths of the passengers, and was also given a life sentence, after being found guilty of murder of the 304 passengers that did not survive.
*June 1, 2015: The Chinese captain of the river cruise ship ''[[Dong Fang Zhi Xing]]'' left the ship before most passengers were rescued. On June 13, 442 deaths were confirmed with 12 rescued among 454 on board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Yangtze River Ship Captain Faces Questions on Sinking |publisher=The Wall Street Journal |date=June 2, 2015 |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/yangtze-river-ferry-captain-faces-questions-on-sinking-1433237962}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the deadliest peacetime maritime disaster in China's history.{{Cn|date=May 2018}}

==Extended or metaphorical use==
When used metaphorically, the "captain" may be simply the leader of a group of people, "the ship" may refer to some other place that is threatened by catastrophe, and "going down" with it may refer to a situation that implies a severe penalty or death. It is common for references to be made in the case of the military and when leadership during the situation is clear. So when a raging fire threatens to destroy a mine, the mine's supervisor, the "captain," may perish in the fire trying to rescue his workers trapped inside, and acquaintances might say that he went down with his ship or that he "died trying."

===In aviation===
[[Image:561016PanAmDitches-5.jpg|thumb|right|Pan Am Flight 6 successfully ditches in the Pacific Ocean with Captain Ogg on the second of two life rafts. The airplane sank a few minutes after this photo was taken.]]
The concept has been explicitly extended in law to the [[pilot in command]] of an aircraft, in the form of laws stating that he "[has] final authority and responsibility for the operation and safety of the flight."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?rgn=div8&amp;node=14:1.0.1.1.1.0.1.1 |title=Title 14  Chapter I  Subchapter A  Part 1  §1.1 |work=[[Code of Federal Regulations]] |year=2015 |accessdate=6 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jurisprudence]] has explicitly interpreted this by analogy with the captain of a sea vessel.

This is particularly relevant when an aircraft is forced to ditch in the ocean and becomes a floating vessel that will almost certainly sink. For example, following the crash of [[US Airways Flight 1549]] into the [[Hudson River]], pilot [[Chesley Sullenberger]] was the last person to exit the partially-submerged aircraft, and performed a final check for any others on board before doing so.

Similarly, on October 16, 1956, [[Pan Am Flight 6]] was a [[Boeing 377 Stratocruiser]] en route from Honolulu to San Francisco that was forced to ditch in the Pacific Ocean due to multiple engine failures. The airliner broke apart when one of its wings collided with a wave swell. Airline Captain Richard N. Ogg was the last to exit the airplane during the successful mid-ocean ditching and rescue of all 31 on board by the US Coast Guard Cutter [[USCGC Pontchartrain (WHEC-70)|USCGC ''Pontchartrain'']]. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thisdayinaviation.com/16-october-1956/ This Day in Aviation, 16 October 1956], 2016, Bryan R. Swopes&lt;/ref&gt; The airplane fuselage sank with no one on board a few minutes later.

===In academia===
After a major scandal at [[Baylor University]], the university fired President [[Kenneth Starr]] and appointed him chancellor. A week later, Starr resigned as chancellor and "willingly accepted responsibility" for the actions of Baylor that "clearly fell short." He stated that his resignation for the scandal was "a matter of conscience," and said, "The captain goes down with the ship."&lt;ref name=espn&gt;http://espn.go.com/college-sports/story/_/id/15875833/kenneth-starr-resign-chancellor-baylor-continue-teach&lt;/ref&gt; He indicated that his resignation was necessary even though he "didn't know what was happening."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22892">'''Theoretical psychology''' is concerned with theoretical and philosophical aspects of [[psychology]]. It is an [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary field]] with a wide scope of study. It focuses on combining and incorporating existing and developing theories of psychology non-experimentally.  Theoretical psychology originated from the [[philosophy of science]], with [[logic]] and [[rationality]] at the base of each new idea. It existed before [[Empirical psychology|empirical]] or [[experimental psychology]]. Theoretical psychology is an interdisciplinary field involving psychologists specializing in a wide variety of psychological branches. There have been a few prominent pioneers of theoretical psychology such as [[Wilhelm Wundt]], [[William James]], [[Sigmund Freud]], and [[John B. Watson]]. There has also been a number of notable contributors which include [[Jerome Kagan]], [[Alan E. Kazdin]], [[Robert Sternberg]], [[Kenneth J. Gergen]], and [[Ulric Neisser]]. These contributors often publish in a variety of journals including the most prominent for theoretical psychology, the ''[[Journal of Theoretical and Philosophical Psychology]]''. Many other organizations are beginning to recognize theoretical psychology as a formal subdivision of psychology.

==Origin==

Theoretical psychology emerged from [[philosophy]], more specifically, from the [[philosophy of science]]. Philosophy strives to understand nature and structure of concepts, the laws in which these concepts occur, and the theories that combine the laws together. One of these specific branches of philosophy of science is theoretical psychology. Philosophy of science does not use the [[scientific method]] to empirically derive ideas about the physical world through conducting experiments and interpreting results. However, it is still about science with an emphasis on the logic and rationality behind science itself, bringing to light what cannot be explained by empirical measures. It is also [[metaphysics|metaphysically]] and epistemologically focused on all humans while incorporating the nature and essence of [[human knowledge]]. Just as the philosophy of science is to science, theoretical psychology is to psychology in that it is the logic and rationality applied to [[concepts]], [[laws]], and [[theories]]. Theoretical psychology is not in place to discern which theories are more truthful or more correctly. Many consider theoretical psychology as the support or rationalization of an "idea" within psychological theory that is more "truthful". However, this is not the case. Theoretical psychology is scientifically grounded in ideas of what is known through epistemology.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Bergmann, Gustav. "THEORETICAL PSYCHOLOGY." ANNUAL REVIEW OF PSYCHOLOGY. Vol. 4. Palo Alto: ANNUAL REVIEWS, 1953. 435-458.{{doi|10.1146/annurev.ps.04.020153.002251}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Theoretical psychology existed long before any branches of traditional empirical and [[experimental psychology]]. Because of this, there is much more depth and breadth of knowledge from which to draw. This also makes it less common for new developments to come about in the present day because many "new" approaches are drawing from and revitalizing past theories. This brings new knowledge, frames of reference, and mindsets to these foundational theories.  This may be due to Ideas taking longer to develop and gain momentum than related fields in empirical based psychology.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

==Relationship to philosophy and scope==

Theoretical psychology is a rational, non-experimental approach to [[psychology]]. In psychology, as with any field of study, there are three [[Philosophy|philosophical]] perspectives and methodologies of ways to derive knowledge about the reality of the world. [[Rationalism]] (use of intellect and reason of the mind), [[Empiricism]] (use of our individually experienced sensorium), and [[Skepticism]] (knowledge beyond mere appearance that is not able to be studied) characterize the three perspectives in understanding theoretical concepts relating to laws which help to understand larger theoretical theories.&lt;ref&gt;https://drummondphilosophy.wikispaces.com/Scepticism,+Rationalism+and+Empiricism&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the philosophical perspectives, rationalism is the most pertinent to this discipline of psychology. Theoretical psychology is not experimental or clinically based and focuses on non-experimental ways to acquire knowledge about psychological topics.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; It explores the theoretical knowledge behind its encompassed ideologies.  Oftentimes this includes, but is not limited to, non-experimental critiques to different schools of thought, and the usefulness of psychological concepts. Theoretical psychology is a discipline that bases its information through inference, as opposed to empirically acquired information. Hypotheses are then exchanged and further built upon from different perspectives. Theoretical Psychology also deals with manipulating non-scientific, common words ([[Construct (philosophy)|hypothetical constructs]]) into scientifically objective terms ([[intervening variable]]s). Theoretical psychology requires full agreement on the different viewpoints to be able to see the point as a theory. As a result, many of its topics remain in continuous debate.

Theoretical psychology is the [[Psychology of reasoning|logic of psychology]] and all of its components. This means when theories within psychology oppose or compete, theoretical psychology does not select which is correct. It describes the nature and composition of psychology's many ideas. To explain the logic of psychology, there has been a conclusion of the principles belonging to the three classified areas. Psychology is built on the principle of being able to reference [[Behaviorism|observable behavior]], [[physical environment]], and/or [[Mood (psychology)|physiological states]]. Theoretical psychology is an important aspect that continues to play a role in modern psychology. While there are some downfalls to theoretical psychology, there are also strengths and benefits it brings to the field.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lucey, K. (2015). Pesky essays on the logic of philosophy. Reno, Nevada: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt;

The scope that theoretical psychology covers is vast.  Professionals have the opportunity to use this method of seeking out theoretical knowledge to begin research in a variety of subjects. This allows for a great deal of knowledge to be explored by means of inference rather than seeking out tangible data to draw ideas. Theoretical psychology is an interdisciplinary field involving psychologists specializing in [[cognitive psychology]], [[social psychology]], [[developmental psychology]], [[personality psychology]], [[clinical psychology]], [[perceptual psychology]], [[neuropsychology]], [[biological psychology]], [[evolutionary psychology]], [[Cultural-historical psychology|historical psychology]], [[economic psychology]], [[political psychology]], and [[critical psychology]].  It is important to acknowledge these fields do not discount empiricism, but rather explore new ideas with a theoretical approach first.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

==Pioneers==
A brief history into the field of theoretical psychology includes some prominent pioneers. To begin, [[Wilhelm Wundt]] (1874) originally worked as a professor of philosophy. His focus was on the subjective study of an individual's [[consciousness]], he believed that this was a key factor to the field of psychology. This aspect of psychology was unable to be shown with a large amount of empirical evidence, but remained a theory throughout the history of Psychology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wong|first1=W|title=Retracing the Footsteps of Wilhelm Wundt: Explorations in the Disciplinary Frontiers of psychology and in vokerpsychologie|journal=History of Psychology|date=2009|volume=4|issue=12|pages=229–265|doi=10.1037/a0017711}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Next, [[William James]] (1890) worked as a psychologist and a philosopher. His career focused around the idea of [[free will]], which is theoretical in nature. He also assisted in forming the [[James-Lange theory]] of [[emotion]], which is based upon many theoretical factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Leary|first1=D.E.|title=Overcoming Blindness: Some historical reflections on qualitative psychology|journal=Qualitative Psychology|date=2014|volume=1|issue=1|pages=17–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=O'Doherty|first1=K|title=Relational Being|journal=Journal of Theoretical and Philosophical Psychology|date=2011|volume=1|issue=31|pages=61–64|doi=10.1037/a0022548}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[Sigmund Freud]] (1905) was also an important pioneer for theoretical psychology. Freud founded the [[psychoanalytic theory]] of psychology. He did not rely on empirical data when making his theories, but instead looked for philosophical explanations. Freud often shared his view that he did not need empirical evidence for his theory, because he simply knew it is true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Solomon|first1=M.|title=Psychopathology of everyday life: a critical review of Dr. Sigmund Freud's theories|journal=The Journal of Abnormal Psychology|date=1916|volume=1|issue=1|pages=17–33|doi=10.1037/qup0000003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jones|first1=D.E.|title=Freud's Psychology|journal=Psychological Bulletin|date=2014|volume=4|issue=7|pages=109–128|doi=10.1037/qup0000003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another pioneer was [[John B. Watson]] (1913). Watson founded the theory of [[behaviorism]] in psychology through the article "Psychology as a Behaviorist Views It".  Although Behaviorism has a strong emphasis on empirical psychology, forming the methods cannot be empirically tested, and is therefore considered theoretical psychology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Watson|first1=John. B.|title=Psychology as a Behaviorist Views it|journal=Psychological Review|date=March 1913|volume=2|issue=20|pages=158–177|doi=10.1037/h0074428}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Slife|first1=B.D|title=Toward a Theoretical Psychology:Should a subdiscipline be formally recognized?|journal=American Psychologist|date=1997|volume=2|issue=52|pages=117–129|doi=10.1037/0003-066X.52.2.117}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable contributors==

There are some notable individuals that have, and continue to make a large impact on theoretical psychology.  [[Jerome Kagan]]'s (1971) work on [[personality traits]] and [[aging]], [[emotion]], and [[temperament]] could be considered theoretical psychology due to Kagen dedicating much of his work to psychology constructs, specifically to the developmental psychology.  As a science gains new empirical procedures it also generates new information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Jerome Kagen|journal=American Psychologist|volume=4|issue=43|pages=223–225|doi=10.1037/h0091993}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[List of cognitive–behavioral therapies|Donald Meichenbaum]] (1977) had work that focused on [[cognitive behavioral therapy]]. Meichenbaum did the majority of his work in the field of cognitive psychology.  He compared his theory to [[Pandora's box]]. Its main focus is connecting [[cognitive processes]] and relations to things such as clients' feelings, behavior, and consequences of these. It also factors in physiologic and social cultural processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Donald|first1=Meichenbaum|title=Changing Conceptions of Cognitive Behavior Modification: Retrospect and Prospect.|journal=Journal of Consulting and Clinical Psychology|date=1993|volume=2|issue=61|pages=202–204|doi=10.1037/0022-006X.61.2.202}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alan E. Kazdin]] (1980) had theories that focuses on Cognitive Behavioral Therapy as a style in children and adolescence. He focuses on child and adolescent [[psychopathology|psychopathologies]] such as [[Depression (mood)|depression]] and conduct problems. His writings on research strategies and methods have set a high standard for rigor in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Alan E. Kazdin|journal=American Psychologist|date=2011|volume=8|issue=66|pages=682–698|doi=10.1037/a0024502}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert Sternberg]]'s (1990) main focus revolves around some theoretical idea that include; [[creativity]], [[wisdom]], [[Collaborative method|thinking styles]], [[love]], and [[hate]]. Sternberg often includes politically charged articles that focus on admissions testing and general intelligence. He performed both empirically driven and theoretical work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sternberg|first1=R.J|title=Teaching for creativity: The Sounds of Silence|journal=Psychology of Aesthetics|date=2015|volume=2|issue=9|pages=115–117|doi=10.1037/aca0000007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Kenneth J. Gergen]]'s (1991) work on social psychology as history was used towards generative theories, realities and relationships, the saturated self, positive aging, and relational being. He included many theoretical ideas such as culture and science, assumptions, views on [[mental illness]], and relations.  Many of his idea's were theoretical in nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gergen|first1=K.J.|title=Process Without Foundations|journal=Journal of Theoretical and Philosophical Psychology|volume=3|issue=34|pages=195–199|doi=10.1037/a0035424}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ulric Neisser]](1995) has work that's related to [[cognitive psychology]], specifically the idea of [[flashbulb memories]].  Although he used empirical data to test this idea, he originally took the concept from theoretical work.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cutting|first1=J.E|title=Ulric Neisser|journal=American Psychologist|volume=6|issue=67|page=492|doi=10.1037/a0029351}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These individual's and many others continue to impact psychology with theoretical ideas that may or may not be yet supported by empirical data.

==Modern organizational support==

The [[American Psychological Association]] has the division of Theoretical and Philosophical Psychology as Division 24. Theoretical Ideas are also associated to the division of [[humanistic psychology]] (32). According to the American Psychological Association, "Division 24: Society for Theoretical and Philosophical Psychology encourages and facilitates informed exploration and discussion of psychological theories and issues in both their scientific and philosophical dimensions and interrelationships." The International Society for Theoretical Psychology, the Section of History and Philosophy of Psychology (25) of the Canadian Psychological Society, the Section of History and Philosophy of psychology of the [[British Psychological Society]], the International Human Science Conference, and the [[Society for Philosophy and Psychology]] also offer organizational support. Universities that currently have Theoretical Psychology/Human Science programs include [[Duquesne University]], the [[University of Dallas]], [[Seattle University]], [[West Georgia College]], [[University of Calgary]], [[University of Alberta]], [[York University]], [[Brigham Young University]], [[University of Notre Dame]], And [[Georgetown University]].&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;

==Research methods==

Theoretical psychology works together with empirical psychology to form a symbiotic relationship. Theoretical psychology is not constrained by empirical research or laboratory studies. It allows for scientists to freely search for knowledge that we have yet to be able to study empirically or are not yet capable of studying empirically. For theoretical psychology, its strength lies in the realm of rationality, focused on big picture ideas. However, on its own it is not a complete way to gain particular knowledge of reality. This is where the empirical based branches of psychology has strength. Theoretical psychology can more heavily rely on an idea about human nature that is universal, even when it is not known why or how this particular trend happens in the world, either individualistically or collectively. [[Empirical psychology]] is what allows for humans to make insights on these big picture ideas at a more palatable, applicable and individualistic and way that gives practical information about reality. Theoretical psychology is not a universal psychological theory able to explain all topics without the use of empirical research.  Theoretical psychology is not fundamental or comprehensive theory of psychology, rather, for theoretical psychology to operate correctly it is  important to supplement empirical psychology and give reason to topics and produce theories until they can be empirically verified by the other branches of psychology.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

==Issues in methodology and practice==

[[Humans]] have innate wonder, exploring many topics through experience and perception. From this wonder, individuals rationally reflects on their own experiences about a specific topic. Then the individual practices [[dialectics]], examining what others have said about the topic being explored with the hopes of finding a particular knowledge about the topic. Theoretical psychology serves as the bridge between the philosophical roots of psychology and the present day empirical psychology. This bridge has an emphasis and focus on forming concepts from moments of explicit behavior that are observable, excluding introspective mental events within [[Consciousness|individual consciousness]]. Psychological laws are created from these observable behaviors that are derived from one concept that also contain concepts from the individual’s environment of internal physiological states. These laws are categorized into [[causal]] ([[statistical]]) or [[deterministic]]/[[mechanistic]] (nonstatistical) categories which relate simultaneous parallel traits or predict future from present or past respectively.  Then these laws are organized into theories based on connections logically deduced together and open to new laws yet to be discovered or empirically verified. The ultimate and logically possible goal of theoretical psychology is to create an exact and comprehensive psychological theory. However, the concepts that are immediately observable are still abstract and difficult to define even in a basic law in an important solid theory as they relate to no physical object we can make sense of or interact with using our sensorium and empirical approaches. They are not instantiated in the world and in virtue of this they are called [[Theoretical definition|theoretical concepts]].&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

==Significance==

Theoretical psychology has many aspects that can be viewed as positive or negative, which depends on the interpreter. Theoretical psychology can play an important and also unique role in the field such that almost any claim can be reasonably thought of as true if it is theoretically appealing and empirically supported by research.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Edelman, S. (2012). Six
Challenges to Theoretical and Philosophical Psychology. ''Frontiers in Psychology'', ''3'', 219. http://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2012.00219&lt;/ref&gt; Theorists must be strategic and knowledgeable when shifting through experimental psychology as the field grows. This can be beneficial in the sense that individuals know theorists have made a deliberated effort when analyzing the research surrounding a theory. However, for those who are not familiar with the theoretical psychology surrounding a theory, the abundant amount of information contributing to a theory can be overwhelming.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In addition, theories can be extremely resistant to change. As theories compete, and different evidence emerges, prior theories can be extremely difficult to change. This can make it difficult for new theories to gain traction within the field of psychology. This [[Psychological resilience|resiliency]] may in part be due to theories stated in ways that are worded too abstractly, ineffectively, and contradictory at times.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; One challenge of theoretical psychology is the difficulty to explain [[consciousness]]: there are many competing theories revolving around consciousness, and theoretical psychology struggles to fully explain or justify consciousness. Researchers have an extremely difficult time studying it, despite there being an entire field of psychology completely dedicated to consciousness.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Theoretical psychology can be extremely beneficial because it brings together scientific ideas and philosophical ideas of psychology. Integrating these ideas contributes to the knowledge of psychology.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Journals==

The fields of [[humanistic]] and  [[existential]], as well as the [[Social constructionism|Social Constructionist perspective]] of psychology, all have been fundamental to some of the first theoretical ideas as it pertains to modern theoretical psychology. Today, there are many journals that include theoretical articles. These journals include the following:&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;
