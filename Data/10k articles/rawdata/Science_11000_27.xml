      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9843">In the field of [[artificial intelligence]], the most difficult problems are informally known as '''AI-complete''' or '''AI-hard''', implying that the difficulty of these computational problems is equivalent to that of solving the central artificial intelligence problem—making computers as intelligent as people, or [[artificial general intelligence|strong AI]].&lt;ref name="Shapiro92"&gt;Shapiro, Stuart C. (1992). [http://www.cse.buffalo.edu/~shapiro/Papers/ai.pdf Artificial Intelligence] In Stuart C. Shapiro (Ed.), ''Encyclopedia of Artificial Intelligence'' (Second Edition, pp.&amp;nbsp;54–57). New York: John Wiley. (Section 4 is on "AI-Complete Tasks".)&lt;/ref&gt;  To call a problem AI-complete reflects an attitude that it would not be solved by a simple specific algorithm.  

AI-complete problems are hypothesised to include [[computer vision]], [[natural language understanding]], and dealing with unexpected circumstances while solving any real world problem.&lt;ref&gt;Roman V. Yampolskiy. Turing Test as a Defining Feature of AI-Completeness . In Artificial Intelligence, Evolutionary Computation and Metaheuristics (AIECM) --In the footsteps of Alan Turing. Xin-She Yang (Ed.). pp. 3-17. (Chapter 1). Springer, London. 2013. http://cecs.louisville.edu/ry/TuringTestasaDefiningFeature04270003.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, AI-complete problems cannot be solved with modern computer technology alone, but would also require [[human computation]].  This property can be useful, for instance to test for the presence of humans as with [[CAPTCHA]]s, and for [[computer security]] to circumvent [[brute-force attack]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Luis von Ahn, Manuel Blum, Nicholas Hopper, and John Langford. [http://www.captcha.net/captcha_crypt.pdf CAPTCHA: Using Hard AI Problems for Security] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304001102/http://www.captcha.net/captcha_crypt.pdf |date=2016-03-04 }}. In Proceedings of Eurocrypt, Vol. 2656 (2003), pp. 294-311.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first = Richard | last = Bergmair | title = Natural Language Steganography and an "AI-complete" Security Primitive | citeseerx = 10.1.1.105.129 | date = January 7, 2006 }} (unpublished?)&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The term was coined by [[Fanya Montalvo]] by analogy with [[NP-complete]] and [[NP-hard]] in [[Computational complexity theory|complexity theory]], which formally describes the most famous class of difficult problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last=Mallery | first=John C.  |year=1988 | url=http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/mallery88thinking.html | contribution=Thinking About Foreign Policy: Finding an Appropriate Role for Artificially Intelligent Computers | title=The 1988 Annual Meeting of the International Studies Association. | location=St. Louis, MO }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Early uses of the term are in Erik Mueller's 1987 Ph.D. dissertation&lt;ref&gt;Mueller, Erik T. (1987, March). [ftp://ftp.cs.ucla.edu/tech-report/198_-reports/870017.pdf ''Daydreaming and Computation'' (Technical Report CSD-870017)] Ph.D. dissertation, University of California, Los Angeles. ("Daydreaming is but one more ''AI-complete'' problem: if we could solve any one artificial intelligence problem, we could solve all the others", p.&amp;nbsp;302)&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Eric S. Raymond|Eric Raymond]]'s 1991 [[Jargon File]].&lt;ref&gt;Raymond, Eric S. (1991, March 22). [http://catb.org/esr/jargon/oldversions/jarg282.txt Jargon File Version 2.8.1] (Definition of "AI-complete" first added to jargon file.)&lt;/ref&gt;

==AI-complete problems==
AI-complete problems are hypothesized to include:
*[https://www.wired.com/2017/02/ai-can-solve-peer-review-ai-can-solve-anything/ AI peer review] (composite [[natural language understanding]], [[automated reasoning]], [[automated theorem proving]], [[Formalism (philosophy of mathematics)|formalized]] [[logic]] [[expert system]])
*[[Bongard problems]]
*[[Computer vision]] (and subproblems such as [[object recognition]])
*[[Natural language understanding]] (and subproblems such as [[text mining]], [[machine translation]], and [[word sense disambiguation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Ide |first=N. |last2=Veronis |first2=J. |year=1998 |title=Introduction to the special issue on word sense disambiguation: the state of the art |journal=Computational Linguistics |volume=24 |issue=1 |pages=2–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;)
*Dealing with unexpected circumstances while solving any real world problem, whether it's [[robotic mapping|navigation]] or [[automated planning and scheduling|planning]] or even the kind of [[reasoning]] done by [[expert system]]s.

===Machine translation===
{{main|Machine translation}}

To translate accurately, a machine must be able to understand the text. It must be able to follow the author's argument, so it must have some ability to [[artificial intelligence#Deduction, reasoning, problem solving|reason]]. It must have extensive [[commonsense knowledge|world knowledge]] so that it knows what is being discussed — it must at least be familiar with all the same commonsense facts that the average human translator knows. Some of this knowledge is in the form of facts that can be explicitly represented, but some knowledge is unconscious and closely tied to the human body: for example, the machine may need to understand how an ocean makes one ''feel'' to accurately translate a specific metaphor in the text. It must also model the authors' goals, intentions, and emotional states to accurately reproduce them in a new language. In short, the machine is required to have wide variety of human intellectual skills, including [[artificial intelligence#Deduction, reasoning, problem solving|reason]], [[commonsense knowledge]] and the intuitions that underlie [[robotics|motion and manipulation]], [[machine perception|perception]], and [[artificial intelligence#Social intelligence|social intelligence]]. [[Machine translation]], therefore, is believed to be AI-complete: it may require strong AI to be done as well as humans can do it.

==Software brittleness==
{{main|Software brittleness}}
Current AI systems can solve very simple and/or restricted versions of AI-complete problems, but never in their full generality. When AI researchers attempt to "scale up" their systems to handle more complicated, real world situations, the programs tend to become excessively [[brittle (software)|brittle]] without [[commonsense knowledge]] or a rudimentary understanding of the situation: they fail as unexpected circumstances outside of its original problem context begin to appear.  When human beings are dealing with new situations in the world, they are helped immensely by the fact that they know what to expect: they know what all things around them are, why they are there, what they are likely to do and so on. They can recognize unusual situations and adjust accordingly. A machine without strong AI has no other skills to fall back on.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last=Lenat | first=Douglas |  last2=Guha | first2=R. V.| year = 1989 | title = Building Large Knowledge-Based Systems | publisher = Addison-Wesley| author-link=Douglas Lenat|pages=1–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formalization==
[[Computational complexity theory]] deals with the relative computational difficulty of [[computable function]]s.  By definition it does not cover problems whose solution is unknown or has not been characterised formally.  Since many AI problems have no formalisation yet, conventional complexity theory does not allow the definition of AI-completeness.

To address this problem, a complexity theory for AI has been proposed.&lt;ref name="ucl.ac.uk"&gt;Dafna Shahaf and Eyal Amir (2007) [http://www.aaai.org/Papers/Symposia/Spring/2007/SS-07-05/SS07-05-026.pdf Towards a theory of AI completeness]. [http://www.ucl.ac.uk/commonsense07 Commonsense 2007,  8th International Symposium on Logical Formalizations of Commonsense Reasoning].&lt;/ref&gt; It is based on a [[model of computation]] that splits the computational burden between a computer and a human: one part is solved by computer and the other part solved by human.  This is formalised by a '''human-assisted [[Turing machine]]'''.  The formalisation defines algorithm complexity, problem complexity and reducibility which in turn allows [[equivalence class]]es to be defined.

The complexity of executing an algorithm with a human-assisted Turing machine is given by a pair &lt;math&gt;\langle\Phi_{H},\Phi_{M}\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, where the first element represents the complexity of the human's part and the second element is the complexity of the machine's part.

===Results===
The complexity of solving the following problems with a human-assisted Turing machine is:&lt;ref name="ucl.ac.uk"/&gt;

* [[Optical character recognition]] for printed text: &lt;math&gt;\langle O(1), poly(n) \rangle &lt;/math&gt;
* [[Turing test]]:
** for an &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-sentence conversation where the oracle remembers the conversation history (persistent oracle): &lt;math&gt;\langle O(n), O(n) \rangle &lt;/math&gt;
** for an &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-sentence conversation where the conversation history must be retransmitted: &lt;math&gt;\langle O(n), O(n^2) \rangle &lt;/math&gt;
** for an &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-sentence conversation where the conversation history must be retransmitted and the person takes linear time to read the query: &lt;math&gt;\langle O(n^2), O(n^2) \rangle &lt;/math&gt;
* [[ESP game]]: &lt;math&gt;\langle O(n), O(n) \rangle &lt;/math&gt;
* Image labelling (based on the [[Arthur–Merlin protocol]]): &lt;math&gt;\langle O(n), O(n) \rangle &lt;/math&gt;
* [[Object categorization from image search|Image classification]]: human only: &lt;math&gt;\langle O(n), O(n) \rangle &lt;/math&gt;, and with less reliance on the human: &lt;math&gt;\langle O(\log n), O(n \log n) \rangle &lt;/math&gt;.

[[File:Martin, Benjamin – Gramatica delle scienze filosofiche, 1769 – BEIC 1413539.jpg|thumb|''Gramatica delle scienze filosofiche'', 1769]]
'''Benjamin Martin''' (1704-1782) was a lexicographer who compiled one of the early English dictionaries, the ''Lingua Britannica Reformata'' (1749).&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Martin (1749). [https://books.google.com/books?id=aqlbAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA482 ''Lingua Britannica  Reformata'']. (Google books, original from Oxford University Library)&lt;/ref&gt; He also was a lecturer on science and maker of scientific instruments.&lt;ref&gt;John R. Millburn. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/index/18/101018175/ "Martin, Benjamin"]. ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'' {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Martin was born in [[Worplesdon]], [[Surrey]] and began life as a ploughboy, but graduated to become a teacher.  A legacy of £500 enabled him to buy books and instruments, and he became a lecturer and instrument maker.  He was an early champion for the Newtonian system.  In 1737, he published the ''Biblioteca Technologia'' - a survey of natural philosophy in 25 sub-headings.&lt;ref name=green/&gt;

In 1740, he moved to [[Fleet Street]], near the Royal Society where his admired Newton would often lecture.  He began manufacturing [[Hadley's quadrant]] (a predecessor to the [[sextant]]) and optical instruments.  His business prospered, and he also became known as a spectacle maker.  He continued to lecture on natural philosophy, and from 1755 to 1764, he also published ''Martin's magazine''. The periodical, formally known as the ''General Magazine of Arts and Sciences'', set out to provide subscribers with an [[encyclopedia]]'s worth of knowledge  "one Half-sheet upon a Science" at a time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The general magazine of Arts and Sciences|last=Martin|first=Benjamin|publisher=|year=1755|isbn=|location=London|pages=1:iv}}&lt;/ref&gt; He intended readers eventually to reorganize and rebind the separate parts of individual numbers into one large reference work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/10.1057/9781137411549|title=Literature and Encyclopedism in Enlightenment Britain: The Pursuit of Complete Knowledge|last=Rudy|first=Seth|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2014|isbn=|location=|pages=120|language=en|doi=10.1057/9781137411549}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1781, the seventy-seven-year-old Martin went bankrupt; a few years earlier he had handed over his business to several managers who proved inept.  He attempted suicide, and while it was not immediately successful, the wound (nature unknown&lt;ref name=green/&gt;) was grievous enough and he failed to recover, and died on 9 February 1782.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Martin, Benjamin |first=Charles |last=Platts|volume=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Dictionary==
In 1749, he published the ''Lingua Britannica Reformata, Or, A New English Dictionary''. His dictionary incorporated a largely intact copy of [[Bailey's dictionary|Nathan Bailey's ''Universal Dictionary'']] of 1721, which Benjamin Martin described as "the best English dictionary hitherto published".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=aqlbAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PR4&amp;dq=bailey Benjamin Martin's preface to his dictionary], year 1749.&lt;/ref&gt; Bailey's dictionary in turn had copied heavily from the 1706 [[Edward Phillips|Phillips]]-[[John Kersey|Kersey]] English dictionary. A second edition of Martin's dictionary was published in 1754, a year before [[A Dictionary of the English Language|Samuel Johnson's dictionary]].&lt;ref name=green&gt;
{{cite book
 | author =       Jonathon Green
 | title =        Chasing the Sun: Dictionary-Makers
 | publisher =    Henry Holt &amp; Co,
 | year =         1996
 | ISBN =         0-8050-3466-8
}}p.258-262&lt;/ref&gt;

In compiling his 24,500 word dictionary, he gave up on trying to "fix" the language: 
: The pretence of fixing a standard to the purity and perfection of any language is utterly vain and impertinent, because no language as depending on arbitrary use and custom, can ever be permanently the same, but will always be in a mutable and fluctuating state; and what is deem’d polite and elegant in one age, may be counted uncouth and barbarous in another.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book
 | author =       [[Simon Winchester]]
 | title =        [[The Meaning of Everything: The Story of the Oxford English Dictionary]]
 | publisher =    Oxford University Press US,
 | year =         2003
 | ISBN =         978-0-19-860702-1
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This dynamic view of language was also adopted by Johnson and has become the accepted view in modern lexicography.  His dictionary also pre-saged Johnson in that he laid out a detailed set of objectives (that it should be universal, explain the etymologies, etc.).

While his etymologies are often inconsistent and tended to err in favour of Latin origins,&lt;ref name=green/&gt; his work was an improvement on earlier dictionaries in that it had a simpler system of spelling and a clearer guide to pronunciation.

The '''biological terrain assessment''' or '''BTA''' is a set of tests used to measure the [[pH]], [[resistivity]], and [[redox]] of a person's [[urine]], [[blood]], and [[saliva]]. The usefulness of the test is debatable. It is often associated with [[homeopathy]] and [[Holistic Health|holistic health]].

== Usefulness ==

Proponents of the BTA claim that comparing the pH, resistivity, and [[redox]] of the blood, urine, and saliva provides a health practitioner an indication of the metabolic processes taking place inside the body. There is no scientific evidence that these measurements provide a medically relevant indication of metabolic processes. Multiple manufacturers of BTA equipment have been prevented from selling their equipment in the United States because they lack [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) approval. However, the FDA has not stated whether the BTA is medically useful or not.

When it comes to medical instrumentation there really isn't such a thing as "approval." The Quantitative Fluid Analyzer (QFA) manufactured by Health Science Company does have FDA classification as a "laboratory instrument for medical purposes" "ion selective". Class 1 510(K) exempt. The Classification must be renewed every year. However it does not have CLIA (Clinical Laboratory improvement Amendment, 1988) waiver even though its in-vitro test has no misdiagnosis risk of morbidity or mortality as outlined in the Congressional Record when the CLIA law was passed. The FDA can make/modify their own laws.

The test provides a window into background body chemistry for digestion and toxicity for the purposes of lifestyle and dietary improvement progress. No diagnosis for a disease or condition is made by the instrument. Insurance will not pay for this test.

'''Boracite''' is a [[magnesium]] [[borate mineral]] with formula: [[magnesium|Mg]]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;[[boron|B]]&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;[[oxygen|O]]&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;[[chlorine|Cl]]. It occurs as blue green, colorless, gray, yellow to white crystals in the [[orthorhombic]] - pyramidal [[crystal system]]. Boracite also shows pseudo-isometric cubical and [[octahedral]] forms. These are thought to be the result of transition from an unstable high temperature [[Cubic (crystal system)|isometric]] form on cooling. Penetration [[Crystal twinning|twins]] are not unusual. It occurs as well formed crystals and dispersed grains often embedded within [[gypsum]] and [[anhydrite]] crystals. It has a [[Mohs hardness]] of 7 to 7.5 and a [[specific gravity]] of 2.9. [[Refractive index]] values are nα = 1.658 - 1.662, nβ = 1.662 - 1.667 and nγ = 1.668 - 1.673. It has a [[conchoidal fracture]] and does not show [[cleavage (mineralogy)|cleavage]]. It is insoluble in water (not to be confused with borax, which '''is''' soluble in water).

Boracite is typically found in [[evaporite]] sequences associated with [[gypsum]], [[anhydrite]], [[halite]], [[sylvite]], [[carnallite]], [[kainite]] and [[hilgardite]]. It was first described in 1789 for specimens from its [[type locality (geology)|type locality]] of [[Lüneburg Kalkberg|Kalkberg]] hill, Lüneburg, Lower Saxony, Germany. The name is derived from its [[boron]] content (19 to 20% boron by mass).

Chemical compatibility is important when choosing materials for chemical storage or reactions, so that the vessel and other apparatus will not be damaged by its contents. For purposes of [[chemical storage]], chemicals that are incompatible should not be stored together so that any leak will not cause an even more dangerous situation by reacting after leaking. In addition, chemical compatibility refers to the container material being acceptable to store the chemical or for a tool or object that comes in contact with a chemical to not degrade. For example, when stirring a chemical the stirrer must be stable in the chemical that is being stirred. Because of this many companies publish [[chemical resistance]] charts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://spectrumlabs.com/dialysis/Compatibility.html|title=Chemical Compatibility|website=spectrumlabs.com|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and databases&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.coleparmer.com/Chemical-Resistance|title=Chemical Compatibility Database from Cole-Parmer|website=www.coleparmer.com|language=en|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; to help chemical users use appropriate [[Material|materials]] for handling chemicals.

Chemical compatibility is also important when choosing among different chemicals that have similar purposes. For example, [[bleach]] and [[ammonia]], both commonly used as [[cleaner]]s can undergo a dangerous chemical reaction when combined with each other. Even though each of them has a similar use, care must be taken not to allows these chemicals to mix.

[[File:Compound Interest with Varying Frequencies.svg|thumb|right|310px|The effect of earning 20% annual interest on an initial $1,000 investment at various compounding frequencies]]
{{E (mathematical constant)}}

'''Compound interest''' is  the addition of [[interest]] to the [[principal sum]] of a loan or deposit, or in other words, interest on interest. It is the result of reinvesting interest, rather than paying it out, so that interest in the next period is then earned on the principal sum plus previously accumulated interest. Compound interest is standard in [[finance]] and [[economics]].

Compound interest may be contrasted with ''simple interest'', where interest is not added to the principal, so there is no compounding. The ''simple annual interest rate'' is the interest amount per period, multiplied by the number of periods per year. The simple annual interest rate is also known as the '''[[nominal interest rate]]''' (not to be confused with [[real versus nominal value (economics)|the interest rate not adjusted for inflation]], which goes by the same name).
Compound Interest = P (1+(r/n))^nt

==Compounding frequency==
The ''compounding frequency'' is the number of times per year (or other unit of time) the accumulated interest is paid out, or ''capitalized'' (credited to the account), on a regular basis. The frequency could be yearly, half-yearly, quarterly, monthly, weekly, daily, or [[continuous compounding|continuously]] (or not at all, until maturity).

For example, monthly capitalization with annual rate of interest means that the compounding frequency is 12, with time periods measured in months.

The effect of compounding depends on:
# The nominal interest rate which is applied and
# The frequency interest is compounded.
A compound interest calculator is a tool that allows calculating such compounding effect on loans or investments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.mycheckweb.com/calculators/compound-interest-calculator/|title=Compound Interest Calculator - MyCheckWeb.Com|work=MyCheckWeb.Com|access-date=2018-03-30|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Annual equivalent rate==
The nominal rate cannot be directly compared between loans with different compounding frequencies. Both the nominal interest rate and the compounding frequency are required in order to compare interest-bearing financial instruments.

To assist consumers compare retail financial products more fairly and easily, many countries require financial institutions to disclose the annual compound interest rate on deposits or advances on a comparable basis. The interest rate on an annual equivalent basis may be referred to variously in different markets as ''[[annual percentage rate]]'' (APR), ''[[annual equivalent rate]]'' (AER), ''[[effective interest rate]]'', ''[[effective annual rate]]'', ''[[annual percentage yield]]''  and other terms. The effective annual rate is the total accumulated interest that would be payable up to the end of one year, divided by the principal sum.

There are usually two aspects to the rules defining these rates:

#The rate is the annualised compound interest rate, and
#There may be charges other than interest. The effect of fees or taxes which the customer is charged, and which are directly related to the product, may be included. Exactly which fees and taxes are included or excluded varies by country.  may or may not be comparable between different jurisdictions, because the use of such terms may be inconsistent, and vary according to local practice.

==Examples for compound interest==
* 1,000 Brazilian real (BRL) is deposited into a Brazilian savings account paying 20% per annum, compounded annually. At the end of one year, 1,000 x 20% = 200 BRL interest is credited to the account. The account then earns 1,200 x 20% = 240 BRL in the second year.
* A rate of 1% per month is equivalent to a simple annual interest rate (nominal rate) of 12%, but allowing for the effect of compounding, the annual equivalent compound rate is 12.68% per annum (1.01&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; − 1).
* The interest on corporate bonds and government bonds is usually payable twice yearly. The amount of interest paid (each six months) is the disclosed interest rate divided by two and multiplied by the principal. The yearly compounded rate is higher than the disclosed rate.
* Canadian [[mortgage loan]]s are generally compounded semi-annually with monthly (or more frequent) payments.&lt;ref&gt;http://laws.justice.gc.ca/en/showdoc/cs/I-15/bo-ga:s_6//en#anchorbo-ga:s_6 Interest Act (Canada), ''Department of Justice''. The Interest Act specifies that interest is not recoverable unless the mortgage loan contains a statement showing the rate of interest chargeable, "calculated yearly or half-yearly, not in advance." In practice, banks use the half-yearly rate.&lt;/ref&gt;
* U.S. mortgages use an [[amortizing loan]], not compound interest. With these loans, an [[amortization schedule]] is used to determine how to apply payments toward principal and interest.  Interest generated on these loans is not added to the principal, but rather is paid off monthly as the payments are applied.
* It is sometimes mathematically simpler, e.g. in the valuation of [[Derivative (finance)|derivatives]], to use ''continuous compounding'', which is the [[Limit of a function|limit]] as the compounding period approaches zero. Continuous compounding in pricing these instruments is a natural consequence of [[Itō calculus]], where [[Derivative (finance)|financial derivatives]] are valued at ever increasing frequency, until the limit is approached and the derivative is valued in continuous time.

==Discount instruments==
* US and Canadian T-Bills (short term Government debt) have a different convention. Their interest is calculated on a discount basis as (100 − ''P'')/''Pbnm'',{{clarify|date=July 2013}} where ''P'' is the price paid. Instead of normalizing it to a year, the interest is prorated by the number of days ''t'': (365/''t'')×100. (See [[day count convention]]).

===Periodic compounding===
&lt;ref&gt;https://qrc.depaul.edu/StudyGuide2009/Notes/Savings%20Accounts/Compound%20Interest.htm&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/continuouscompounding.asp&lt;/ref&gt; 
The total accumulated value, including the principal sum &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; plus compounded interest &lt;math&gt;I&lt;/math&gt;, is given by the formula:
:&lt;math&gt;P' = P \left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt}&lt;/math&gt;

where:
:''P'' is the original principal sum
:''P''' is the new principal sum
:''r'' is the [[nominal annual interest rate]]
:''n'' is the compounding frequency
:''t'' is the overall length of time the interest is applied (expressed using the same time units as ''r'', usually years).

&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thecalculatorsite.com/articles/finance/compound-interest-formula.php&lt;/ref&gt;
The total compound interest generated is the final value minus the initial principal:

:&lt;math&gt;I = P \left(1 + \frac{r}{n}\right)^{nt} - P&lt;/math&gt;

====Example 1====
Suppose a principal amount of $1,500 is deposited in a bank paying an annual interest rate of 4.3%, compounded quarterly.&lt;br&gt; Then the balance after 6 years is found by using the formula above, with ''P'' = 1500, ''r'' = 0.043 (4.3%), ''n'' = 4, and ''t'' = 6:

:&lt;math&gt;P' =1\,500\times \left(1 + \frac{0.043}{4}\right)^{4 \times 6}\approx 1\,938.84&lt;/math&gt;

So the new principal &lt;math&gt;P'&lt;/math&gt; after 6 years is approximately $1,938.84.

Subtracting the original principal from this amount gives the amount of interest received:

:&lt;math&gt;1\,938.84 - 1\,500 = 438.84&lt;/math&gt;

====Example 2====

Suppose the same amount of $1,500 is compounded biennially (every 2 years).&lt;br&gt; Then the balance after 6 years is found by using the formula above, with ''P'' = 1500, ''r'' = 0.043 (4.3%), ''n'' = 1/2 (the interest is compounded every two years), and ''t'' = 6 :

:&lt;math&gt;P' = 1\,500\times \left(1 + (0.043\times 2)\right)^{\frac 6 2}\approx 1\,921.24&lt;/math&gt; 

So, the balance after 6 years is approximately $1,921.24.

The amount of interest received can be calculated by subtracting the principal from this amount.

:&lt;math&gt;1\,921.24 - 1\,500 = 421.24&lt;/math&gt;

The interest is less compared with the previous case, as a result of the lower compounding frequency.

===Accumulation function===

Since the principal ''P'' is simply a coefficient, it is often dropped for simplicity, and the resulting [[accumulation function]] is used instead. The accumulation function shows what $1 grows to after any length of time. Accumulation functions for simple and compound interest are

:&lt;math&gt;a(t)=1+t r\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;a(t) = \left(1 + \frac {r} {n}\right) ^ {nt} &lt;/math&gt;

===Continuous compounding===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Interest]] and from [[Continuously compounded interest]] --&gt;
{{see also|Logarithmic return}}

As ''n'', the number of compounding periods per year, increases without limit, the case is known as continuous compounding, in which case the effective annual rate approaches an upper limit of {{math|e&lt;sup&gt;''r''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1}}, where [[e (mathematical constant)|{{mvar|e}}]] is a [[mathematical constant]] that is the base of the [[natural logarithm]].

Continuous compounding can be thought of as making the compounding period infinitesimally small, achieved by taking the [[Limit (mathematics)|limit]] as ''n'' goes to [[infinity]]. See [[definitions of the exponential function]] for the mathematical proof of this limit. The amount after ''t'' periods of continuous compounding can be expressed in terms of the initial amount ''P''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; as

:&lt;math&gt;P(t)=P_0 e ^ {rt}.&lt;/math&gt;

===Force of interest===
As the number of compounding periods &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; reaches infinity in continuous compounding, the continuous compound interest is referred to as the force of interest &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;.

In mathematics, the accumulation functions are often expressed in terms of ''[[E (mathematical constant)|e]]'', the base of the [[natural logarithm]]. This facilitates the use of calculus to manipulate interest formulae.

For any continuously differentiable [[accumulation function]] ''a(t)'', the force of interest, or more generally the [[Rate of return#Logarithmic or continuously compounded return|logarithmic or continuously compounded return]] is a function of time defined as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;\delta_{t}=\frac{a'(t)}{a(t)}=\frac{d}{dt} \ln a(t)&lt;/math&gt;

This is the [[logarithmic derivative]] of the accumulation function.

Conversely:
:&lt;math&gt;a(t)=e^{\int_0^t \delta_s\, ds}\ ,&lt;/math&gt; (since &lt;math&gt;a(0) = 1&lt;/math&gt;; this can be viewed as a particular case of a [[product integral]]).

When the above formula is written in differential equation format, then the force of interest is simply the coefficient of amount of change:
:&lt;math&gt;da(t)=\delta_{t}a(t)\,dt\,&lt;/math&gt;

For compound interest with a constant annual interest rate ''r'', the force of interest is a constant, and the accumulation function of compounding interest in terms of force of interest is a simple power of e:
:&lt;math&gt;\delta=\ln(1+r)\,&lt;/math&gt; or
:&lt;math&gt;a(t)=e^{t\delta}\,&lt;/math&gt;

The force of interest is less than the annual effective interest rate, but more than the [[annual effective discount rate]]. It is the reciprocal of the [[e-folding]] time. See also [[Actuarial notation#Interest rates|notation of interest rates]].

A way of modeling the force of inflation is with Stoodley's formula:&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;\delta_t = p + {s \over {1+rse^{st}}}&lt;/math&gt; where p, r and s are estimated. &lt;!-- c.f. Stochastic Modeling in Economics and Finance, By Jitka Dupacova, J. Hurt, J. Stepan --&gt;

===Compounding basis===
{{See also|Day count convention}}

To convert an interest rate from one compounding basis to another compounding basis, use

:&lt;math&gt;r_2=\left[\left(1+\frac{r_1}{n_1}\right)^\frac{n_1}{n_2}-1\right]{n_2},&lt;/math&gt;

where
''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the interest rate with compounding frequency ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, and
''r''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is the interest rate with compounding frequency ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

When interest is [[#Continuous compounding|continuously compounded]], use

:&lt;math&gt;\delta=n\ln{\left(1+\frac{r}{n}\right)},&lt;/math&gt;

where
''&lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;'' is the interest rate on a continuous compounding basis, and
''r'' is the stated interest rate with a compounding frequency ''n''.

===Monthly amortized loan or mortgage payments===
{{See also|Mortgage calculator#Monthly payment formula}}
The interest on loans and mortgages that are amortized—that is, have a smooth monthly payment until the loan has been paid off—is often compounded monthly. The formula for payments is found from the following argument.

===Exact formula for monthly payment===
An exact formula for the monthly payment (&lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;) is
:&lt;math&gt;
c= \frac{Pr}{1-\frac{1}{(1+r)^n}}
&lt;/math&gt;
or equivalently
:&lt;math&gt;
c= \frac{Pr}{1-e^{-n\ln(1+r)}}
&lt;/math&gt;

where:
: &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; = monthly payment
: &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; = principal
: &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; = monthly interest rate
: &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; = number of payment periods

This can be derived by considering how much is left to be repaid after each month. &lt;br&gt;The Principal remaining after the first month is
:&lt;math&gt;
P_1=(1+r)P - c&lt;/math&gt;
i.e. the initial amount has increased less the payment. &lt;br&gt;If the whole loan is repaid after one month then
:&lt;math&gt;P_1=0&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;P=\frac{c}{1+r}&lt;/math&gt;
After the second month &lt;math&gt;P_2=(1+r) P_1 - c&lt;/math&gt; is left, so
:&lt;math&gt;P_2=(1+r)((1+r)P-c)-c&lt;/math&gt;

If the whole loan was repaid after two months,
:&lt;math&gt;P_2=0&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;P = \frac{c}{1+r}+\frac{c}{(1+r)^2}&lt;/math&gt;

This equation generalises for a term of n months, &lt;math&gt; P = c \sum_{j=1}^n \frac{1}{(1+r)^j} &lt;/math&gt;. This is a [[geometric series]] which has the sum
:&lt;math&gt;P=\frac{c}{r}\left(1-\frac{1}{(1+r)^n}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
which can be rearranged to give
:&lt;math&gt;
c= \frac{Pr}{1-\frac{1}{(1+r)^n}}=\frac{Pr}{1-e^{-n\ln(1+r)}}
&lt;/math&gt;

====Spreadsheet formula====
In spreadsheets, the '''PMT()''' function is used.  The syntax is:

:''PMT( interest_rate, number_payments, present_value, future_value,[Type] )''
See [https://support.office.com/en-us/article/PMT-function-0214da64-9a63-4996-bc20-214433fa6441 Excel], [https://www.apple.com/ca/mac/numbers/compatibility/functions.html#financial Mac Numbers], [https://help.libreoffice.org/Calc/Financial_Functions_Part_Two#PMT Libreoffice], [https://wiki.openoffice.org/wiki/Documentation/How_Tos/Calc:_PMT_function Open Office] for more details.

For example, for interest rate of 6% (0.06/12), 25 years * 12 p.a., PV of $150,000, FV of 0, type of 0 gives:

:= PMT( 0.06/12, 25 * 12, -150000, 0, 0 )
:= $966.45

===Approximate formula for monthly payment===
A formula that is accurate to within a few percent can be found by
noting that for typical U.S. note rates (&lt;math&gt;I&lt;8\%&lt;/math&gt; and terms &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;=10–30 years), the monthly note rate is small compared to 1:
&lt;math&gt;r&lt;&lt;1&lt;/math&gt; so that the &lt;math&gt;\ln(1+r)\approx r&lt;/math&gt; which yields
a simplification so that

:&lt;math&gt;c\approx \frac{Pr}{1-e^{-nr}}= \frac{P}{n}\frac{nr}{1-e^{-nr}}&lt;/math&gt;

which suggests defining auxiliary variables

:&lt;math&gt;Y\equiv n r = IT&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;c_0\equiv \frac{P}{n} &lt;/math&gt;.

Here &lt;math&gt;c_0&lt;/math&gt; is the monthly payment required for a zero–interest loan paid off in &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; installments. In terms of these variables the
approximation can be written

:&lt;math&gt;c\approx c_0 \frac{Y}{1-e^{-Y}},&lt;/math&gt;

The function &lt;math&gt;f(Y)\equiv \frac{Y}{1-e^{-Y}}-\frac{Y}{2}&lt;/math&gt; is even:

:&lt;math&gt;f(Y)=f(-Y)&lt;/math&gt;

implying that it can be expanded in even powers of &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;.

It follows immediately that &lt;math&gt;\frac{Y}{1-e^{-Y}}&lt;/math&gt; can be expanded in even powers
of &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; plus the single term: &lt;math&gt;Y/2 .&lt;/math&gt;

It will prove convenient then to define

:&lt;math&gt;X=\frac{1}{2}Y = \frac{1}{2}IT&lt;/math&gt;

so that

:&lt;math&gt;c\approx c_0 \frac{2X}{1-e^{-2X}}&lt;/math&gt;
which can be expanded:
:&lt;math&gt;
c\approx c_0 \left(1 + X + \frac{X^2}{3} - \frac{1}{45} X^4 + ...\right)
&lt;/math&gt;

where the ellipses indicate terms that are higher order in even powers of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. The expansion

:&lt;math&gt;
P\approx P_0 \left(1 + X + \frac{X^2}{3}\right)
&lt;/math&gt;

is valid to better than 1% provided &lt;math&gt;X\le 1 &lt;/math&gt;.

====Example of mortgage payment====
For a $10,000 mortgage with a term of 30 years and a note rate of 4.5%, payable yearly, we find:

:&lt;math&gt;T=30&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;I=0.045&lt;/math&gt;

which gives

:&lt;math&gt;X=\frac{1}{2}IT=.675&lt;/math&gt;

so that

:&lt;math&gt;
P\approx P_0 \left(1 + X + \frac{1}{3}X^2 \right)=\$333.33 (1+.675+.675^2/3)=\$608.96
&lt;/math&gt;

The exact payment amount is &lt;math&gt;P=\$608.02&lt;/math&gt; so the approximation is an overestimate of about a sixth of a percent.

==History==
Compound interest was once regarded as the worst kind of [[usury]] and was severely condemned by [[Roman law]] and the [[common law]]s of many other countries.&lt;ref name="r1728"&gt;{{1728}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Florentine merchant [[Francesco Balducci Pegolotti]] provided a [http://www.medievalacademy.org/resource/resmgr/maa_books_online/evans_0024.htm#hd_ma0024_head_755 table of compound interest] in his book ''[[Pratica della mercatura]]'' of about 1340. It gives the interest on 100 lire, for rates from 1% to 8%, for up to 20 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Evans |first = Allan | title = Francesco Balducci Pegolotti, La Pratica della Mercatura | place = Cambridge, Massachusetts | year = 1936 |pages = 301–2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Summa de arithmetica]]'' of [[Luca Pacioli]] (1494) gives the [[Rule of 72]], stating that to find the number of years for an investment at compound interest to double, one should divide the interest rate into 72.

[[Richard Witt]]'s book ''Arithmeticall Questions'', published in 1613, was a landmark in the history of compound interest. It was wholly devoted to the subject (previously called '''[https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/anatocism#Etymology anatocism]'''), whereas previous writers had usually treated compound interest briefly in just one chapter in a mathematical textbook. Witt's book gave tables based on 10% (the then maximum rate of interest allowable on loans) and on other rates for different purposes, such as the valuation of property leases. Witt was a London mathematical practitioner and his book is notable for its clarity of expression, depth of insight and accuracy of calculation, with 124 worked examples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Lewin | first = C G | year = 1970 | title = An Early Book on Compound Interest - Richard Witt's Arithmeticall Questions| journal = Journal of the Institute of Actuaries | volume = 96 | issue = 1 | pages = 121–132 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Lewin | first = C G | year = 1981 | title = Compound Interest in the Seventeenth Century | journal = Journal of the Institute of Actuaries | volume = 108 | issue = 3 | pages = 423–442 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jacob Bernoulli]] discovered the constant [[e (mathematical constant)#Compound interest|&lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt;]] in 1683 by studying a question about compound interest.

A '''conceptual framework''' is an analytical tool with several variations and contexts. It can be applied in different categories of work where an overall picture is needed. It is used to make conceptual distinctions and organize ideas. Strong conceptual frameworks capture something real and do this in a way that is easy to remember and apply.

[[Isaiah Berlin]] used the metaphor of [[The Hedgehog and the Fox|a "fox" and a "hedgehog"]] to make conceptual distinctions in how important philosophers and authors view the world.&lt;ref name="Berlin1953"&gt;{{citation |last=Berlin |first=Isaiah |author-link=Isaiah Berlin |year=1953 |title=The Hedgehog and the Fox: An Essay on Tolstoy's View of History}} [[London]]: [[Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson]]; 1986 [[New York City|New York]]: [[Simon and Schuster]], introduction by M. Walzer.&lt;/ref&gt; Berlin describes hedgehogs as those who use a single idea or organizing principle to view the world (such as [[Dante Alighieri]], [[Blaise Pascal]], [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]], [[Plato]], [[Henrik Ibsen]] and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]). Foxes, on the other hand, incorporate a type of pluralism and view the world through multiple, sometimes conflicting, lenses (examples include [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], [[James Joyce]], [[William Shakespeare]], [[Aristotle]], [[Herodotus]], [[Molière]], and [[Honoré de Balzac]]).

Economists use the conceptual framework of "[[Supply (economics)|supply]]" and "[[Demand (economics)|demand]]" to distinguish between the behavior and incentive systems of firms and consumers.&lt;ref name="Colander2013"&gt;[[David Colander|Colander, David]]. 2013. ''Microeconomics,'' 9th edition, [[New York City|New York]]: [[McGraw-Hill Education|McGraw Hill]] and Frank, Robert and [[Ben Bernanke]]. 2013. ''Principles of Microeconomics,'' 5th edition. New York: McGraw Hill.&lt;/ref&gt; Like many conceptual frameworks, supply and demand can be presented through visual or graphical representations (see [[demand curve]]). Both [[political Science]] and [[economics]] use [[Principal-agent problem|principal agent theory]] as a conceptual framework. The [[politics-administration dichotomy]] is a long standing conceptual framework used in [[public administration]].&lt;ref name="Overeem2012"&gt;{{citation |last=Overeem |first=P. |year=2012 |title=The Politics Administration Dichotomy: Toward a Constitutional Perspective |edition=2 |publisher=[[CRC Press]] |isbn=978-1-4665-5899-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; All three of these cases are examples of a macro level conceptual framework.

== Overview ==
The use of the term ''conceptual framework'' crosses both scale (large and small theories)&lt;ref name="RavitchRiggan2012"&gt;{{citation |author1=Ravitch |author2=Riggan |year=2012 |title=Reason and Rigor: How Conceptual Frameworks guide Research |location=[[Thousand Oaks, California|Thousand Oaks CA]] |publisher=[[SAGE Publishing|Sage]] |page=xiii}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Maxwell2009"&gt;{{citation |last=Maxwell |first=J. |year=2009 |chapter=Designing a qualitative study |title=The State Handbook of Applied Social Science Research |editor-last1=Bickmam |editor-first1=L. |editor-last2=Rog |editor-first2=D. |location=Thousand Oaks, CA |publisher=[[SAGE Publishing|Sage]] |page=222}}&lt;/ref&gt; and contexts (social science,&lt;ref name="Rodman1980"&gt;{{citation |last=Rodman |first=Hyman |title=Are Conceptual Frameworks Necessary for Theory Building?

Its explicit definition and application can therefore vary.

Conceptual frameworks are particularly useful as organizing devices in empirical research.

Likewise, conceptual frameworks are abstract representations, connected to the research project's goal that direct the collection and analysis of data (on the plane of observation – the ground). Critically, a football play is a "plan of action" tied to a particular, timely, purpose, usually summarized as long or short yardage.&lt;ref name="Patricia2014"&gt;{{citation |last=Shields |first=Patricia |author-link=Patricia M.

The national presentation was delivered before Public Administration graduate students in Washington DC.&lt;/ref&gt; Shields and Rangarajan (2013) argue that it is this tie to "purpose" that make [[American football plays]] such a good metaphor. They define a conceptual framework as "the way ideas are organized to achieve a research project's purpose".&lt;ref name="ShieldsRangarajan2013"/&gt; Like football plays, conceptual frameworks are connected to a research purpose or aim. [[Explanation]]&lt;ref name="Babbie2007"&gt;{{citation |last=Babbie |first=Earl |year=2007 |title=The Practice of Social Research |edition=11th |location=[[Belmont, California|Belmont, CA]] |page=89 |publisher=[[Thompson Media Group|Thompson]], [[Cengage|Wadsworth]]}} Babbie also identifies exploration and description as purposes of empirical research&lt;/ref&gt; is the most common type of research purpose employed in empirical research. The formal [[hypothesis]] of a scientific investigation is the framework associated with [[explanation]]&lt;!-- this is not a complete sentence. --&gt;.&lt;ref name="Brains_al2011"&gt;{{citation |last1=Brains |first1=C. |last2=Willnat |first2=L. |last3=Manheim |first3=J. |last4=Rich |first4=R. |year=2011 |title=Empirical Political Analysis: Quantitative and Qualitative Research Methods |location=[[New York City|New York, NY]] |publisher=[[Longman]] |pages=75–77}} Brains et al 2011 also identify exploration, explanation and description as research purposes. Explanation is connected to hypotheses testing (as a framework). The other research purposes are not connected to a framework.&lt;/ref&gt;

Explanatory research usually focuses on "why" or "what caused" a phenomenon to occur. Formal hypotheses posit possible explanations (answers to the why question) that are tested by collecting data and assessing the evidence (usually quantitative using statistical tests). For example, Kai Huang wanted to determine what factors contributed to residential fires in U.S. cities. Three factors were posited to influence residential fires. These factors (environment, population and building characteristics) became the hypotheses or conceptual framework he used to achieve his purpose – explain factors that influenced home fires in [[United States|U.S.]] cities.&lt;ref name="Huang2009"&gt;{{citation |last=Huang |first=Kai |title=Population and Building Factors that impact residential fire rates in large U.S. Cities |publisher=Applied Research Projects, [[Texas State University]] |page=42 |url=https://digital.library.txstate.edu/handle/10877/3592 |year=2009}} The formal hypotheses took the form of relational statements. H1: environmental factors influence residential fire rates; H2: populations characteristics influence residential fire rates; H3: Building factors influence residential fire rates. These hypotheses could be represented visually as H1: A → RFR; H2: B → RFR; H3: C → RFR where A = environmental factors; B = population characteristics; C = Building Factors and RFR = Residential Fire Rates.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==
Several types of conceptual frameworks have been identified,&lt;ref name="ShieldsRangarajan2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Shields1998"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ShieldsTravis2017"&gt;{{citation |last1=Shields |first1=Patricia |author1-link=Patricia M.

* [[Working hypothesis]] – [[Exploration]] or [[Exploratory research]]
* Pillar Questions - [[Exploration]] or [[Exploratory research]]
* Descriptive categories – [[Description]] or [[Descriptive research]]
* Practical ideal type – [[Analysis]] (Gauging)
* Models of [[operations research]] – [[Decision making]]
* Formal hypothesis – [[Explanation]]  and [[Prediction]]

Note that Shields and Rangarajan (2013) do not claim that the above are the only framework-purpose pairing. Nor do they claim the system is applicable to [[Inductive reasoning|inductive]] forms of empirical research. Rather, the conceptual framework-research purpose pairings they propose are useful and provide new scholars a point of departure to develop their own [[research design]].&lt;ref name="ShieldsRangarajan2013"/&gt;

Frameworks have also been used to explain [[conflict theory]] and the balance necessary to reach what amounts to resolution. Within these conflict frameworks, visible and invisible variables function under concepts of relevance. Boundaries form and within these boundaries, tensions regarding laws and chaos (or freedom) are mitigated. These frameworks often function like cells, with sub-frameworks, stasis, evolution and revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Moorstein |first1=Mark |title=Frameworks, Conflict in Balance |publisher=[[iUniverse]] |isbn=978-0-5953-1824-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Anomalistics|Anomalies]] may exist without adequate "lenses" or "filters" to see them and may become visible only when the tools exist to define them.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Kuhn]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1342">'''ECSE''' is an abbreviation for ''[[Electrical Engineering]] and [[Computer science|Computer Sciences]] and [[Systems theory|Systems Engineering]].'' It is a designation used at some [[University|universities]] for the major or department that blends these three fields together.

One reason behind linking the areas of study is to provide students with a broad overview of each of [[software]], [[computer hardware|hardware]] and [[Systems theory]]. However there are also reasons for not blending departments: Students who major in theoretical computer science, studying such topics as algorithm analysis and software engineering, may not have any use for extensive electrical engineering or systems theory classes.{{Fact|date=December 2008}} 

Not every university uses the ECSE designation. Several universities, for example, have separate EE/ECE and CS departments/majors. Other schools use the similar [[Electrical and Computer Engineering|ECE]] (Electrical and Computer Engineering) designation. Additionally, some schools which offer an ECSE degree also offer degrees in Electrical Engineering or Computer Science separately.

The '''European Society for Fuzzy Logic and Technology (EUSFLAT)''' is a scientific association with the aims to disseminate and promote [[fuzzy logic]] and related subjects (sometimes comprised under the collective terms [[soft computing]] or [[computational intelligence]]) and to provide a platform for exchange between scientists and engineers working in these fields. The society is both open for academic and industrial members.

==History==

EUSFLAT was founded in 1998 in Spain as the successor of the National Spanish Fuzzy Logic Society, [[ESTYLF]], with the aim to open the society for members from other European countries. Since then, the society managed to attract a large share of members from outside Spain, and even beyond Europe, with the Spanish members still being the largest group inside EUSFLAT. For these historical reasons, the society is officially registered in Spain.

==Conferences==

Starting with 1999, EUSFLAT has been organizing its biannual conferences in odd years. Previous meetings:

*[[Palma de Mallorca]], [[Balearic Islands]], [[Spain]], September 22–25, 1999 (jointly with National Spanish conference, [[ESTYLF]])
*[[Leicester]], [[United Kingdom]], September 5–7, 2001
*[[Zittau]], [[Germany]], September 10–12, 2003
*[[Barcelona]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]], September 7–9, 2005 (jointly with 11th [[Rencontres Francophones sur la Logique Floue et ses Applications]])
*[[Ostrava]], [[Czech Republic]], September 11–14, 2007
*[[Lisbon]], [[Portugal]], July 20–24, 2009 (jointly with 13th World Congress of the [[International Fuzzy Systems Association]])
*[[Aix-les-Bains]], [[France]], July 18–22, 2011 (jointly with Les Rencontres Francophones sur la Logique Floue et ses Applications)
*[[Milan]], [[Italy]], September 11–13, 2013
*[[Gijón]], [[Spain]], June, 30–3 July 2015

==Publications==

* EUSFLAT publishes the proceedings of its conferences in an open access manner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eusflat.org/publications/proceedings.htm EUSFLAT Conference Proceedings]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Until 2010, [[Mathware &amp; Soft Computing]] was the official journal of EUSFLAT. On July 1, 2010, the [[International Journal of Computational Intelligence Systems]] (Atlantis Press, {{ISSN|1875-6891}} (print) / {{ISSN|1875-6883}} (on-line)) became the official journal of EUSFLAT.
* EUSFLAT publishes an electronic newsletter with three issues a year.

==Presidents==
EUSFLAT is led by the President, who is elected for a two-year period, and cannot serve for more than two consecutive periods.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eusflat.org/society/bylaws.htm EUSFLAT bylaws]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Introduction==
Microscopy techniques are used to produce real-space magnified images of a surface showing what it looks like. In general, microscopy information concerns surface [[crystallography]] (i.e. how the atoms are arranged at the surface), surface morphology (i.e. the shape and size of topographic features making the surface), and surface composition (the elements and compounds the surface is composed of).

Field-emission microscopy (FEM) was invented by Erwin Müller in 1936. In FEM, the phenomenon of [[field electron emission]] was used to obtain an image on the detector on the basis of the difference in work function of the various crystallographic planes on the surface.

==Design==
[[File:FieldEmission-Setup.png|alt=|thumb|FEM experimental set-up]]
A field-emission microscope consists of a metallic sample in the form of a sharp tip and a conducting fluorescent screen enclosed in ultrahigh vacuum. The tip radius used is typically of the order of 100&amp;nbsp;nm. It is composed of a metal with a high [[melting point]], such as [[tungsten]].&lt;ref name="StranksEtAl1970"&gt;

This gives the electric field near the tip apex to be the order of 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;V/m, which is high enough for [[Field electron emission|field emission]] of electrons to take place.

The field-emitted electrons travel along the field lines and produce bright and dark patches on the fluorescent screen, giving a one-to-one correspondence with the crystal planes of the hemispherical emitter. The emission current varies strongly with the local [[work function]] in accordance with the [[Field electron emission|Fowler–Nordheim equation]]; hence, the FEM image displays the projected work function map of the emitter surface. The closely packed faces have higher work functions than atomically rough regions, and thus they show up in the image as dark spots on the brighter background. In short, the work-function anisotropy of the crystal planes is mapped onto the screen as intensity variations.

The magnification is given by the ratio &lt;math&gt;M = L/R&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the tip apex radius, and &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is the tip–screen distance. Linear magnifications of about 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; are attained. The spatial resolution of this technique is of the order of 2&amp;nbsp;nm and is limited by the momentum of the emitted electrons parallel to the tip surface, which is of the order of the [[Fermi velocity]] of the electron in metal.

It is possible to set up an FEM with a probe hole in the phosphor screen and a [[Faraday cup]] collector behind it to collect the current emitted from a single plane. This technique allows the measurement of the variation of work function with orientation for a wide variety of orientations on a single sample. The FEM has also been used to study [[adsorption]] and [[surface diffusion]] processes, making use of the work-function change associated with the adsorption process.

Field emission requires a very good vacuum, and often even in [[ultra-high vacuum]] (UHV), emission is not due to the clean surface. A typical field emitter needs to be "flashed" to clean it, usually by passing a current through a loop on which it is mounted. After flashing the emission current is high but unstable. The current decays with time and in the process becomes more stable due to the contamination of the tip, either from the vacuum, or more often from diffusion of adsorbed surface species to the tip. Thus the real nature of the FEM tips during use is somewhat unknown.

Application of FEM is limited by the materials that can be fabricated in the shape of a sharp tip, can be used in a UHV environment, and can tolerate the high electrostatic fields. For these reasons, [[refractory metals]] with high melting temperature (e.g. W, Mo, Pt, Ir) are conventional objects for FEM experiments.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1906">'''Grand-disciple''' or '''academic grandson''' (or '''granddaughter''') ({{lang-de|Enkelschüler}}) are terms sometimes used in academic contexts or contexts relating to [[fine arts]], and denote someone whose [[Mentorship|mentor]] or [[teacher]] was himself (or herself) a student of a famous representative of that discipline, such as a famous composer or a Nobel Prize-winning scientist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jenapolis.de/2011/10/sequeira-costa-spielt-als-letzter-beruhmter-enkelschuler-liszts-im-festsaal-furstenhaus/ ''Sequeira Costa spielt als letzter berühmter Enkelschüler Liszts im Festsaal Fürstenhaus''], jenapolis.de&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reinhard Zimmermann, ''Roman law, contemporary law, European law'', Oxford University Press, 2000, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

The term implies that knowledge, techniques and/or skills are transferred from the "grandfather" to the "grand-disciple," borrowing from [[kinship terminology]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seiten.faz-archiv.de/FAZ/20110416/fd1201104163076676.html ''Ljapunow, Enkelschüler Liszts Glockenläuten, Heldensagen''.

In: Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, 18 May 2006, No. 115, p. 37], faz-archiv.de&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''Enkelschüler'' is fairly common in German, but similar terms are also used in English to some extent. In German a doctoral advisor is also usually referred to as a ''Doktorvater'', a "doctoral father," similarly modelled on kinship terminology.&lt;ref&gt;Silvan S. Schweber, S.

'''Gustav Karl Laube''' (8 February 1839, [[Teplitz]] &amp;ndash; 12 April 1923, [[Prague]]) was a [[Bohemia]]n [[German people|German]] [[geologist]] and [[paleontologist]].

In 1871 Laube became a professor of [[mineralogy]] and [[geology]] at the technical university in Prague, and in 1876, a professor of geology and paleontology at the [[Karl-Ferdinands-Universität|German Charles-Ferdinand University]] in Prague. Here, he was also director of the geological institute.

He was active in geological research of the [[Ore Mountains (Central Europe)|Ore Mountains]] and neighbouring areas. He also served as geologist of the [[German North Polar Expedition|Second German North Polar Expedition]] (1869-70).&lt;ref name=ME&gt;[http://www.zeno.org/Meyers-1905/A/Laube+%5B3%5D Meyers Großes Konversations-Lexikon] at Zeno.org&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Inherence''' refers to [[Empedocles|Empedocles']] idea that the [[Quality (philosophy)|qualities]] of [[Matter (philosophy)|matter]] come from the relative [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportions]] of each of the [[Classical element|four elements]] entering into a thing.  The idea was further developed by [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]].

==Overview==
That Plato accepted (or at least did not reject) Empedocles' claim can be seen in the ''[[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]]''.  However, Plato also applied it to cover the presence of [[Theory of forms|form]] in matter.  The form is an active principle.  Matter, on the other hand is passive, being a mere [[Subjunctive possibility|possibility]] that the forms bring to life.

Aristotle clearly accepted Empedocles' claim,&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, [https://web.archive.org/web/20061216164725/http://etext.library.adelaide.edu.au/a/aristotle/corruption/ ''On the Generation and Corruption''].&lt;/ref&gt; but he rejected Plato's idea of the forms.  According to Aristotle, the [[Accident (philosophy)|accidents]] of a [[Substance theory|substance]] are [[incorporeal]] [[beings]] which are present in it.&lt;ref&gt;"By being 'present in a subject' I do not mean present as parts are present in a whole, but being incapable of existence apart from the said subject." (Aristotle, ''[[Categories (Aristotle)|Categories]]'' 1a24–26).&lt;/ref&gt;

A closely related term is [[Participation (philosophy)|participation]].  If an attribute ''inheres'' in a subject, then the subject is said to ''participate'' in the attribute.  For example, if the attribute ''in Athens'' inheres in Socrates, then Socrates is said to participate in the attribute, ''in Athens.''

An '''integral field spectrograph,''' or a [[spectrograph]] equipped with an '''integral field unit''' ('''IFU'''), is an optical instrument combining spectrographic and imaging capabilities, used to obtain spatially resolved [[Spectrum|spectra]] in [[astronomy]] and other fields of research such as bio-medical science and [[earth observation]] (or  [[remote sensing]]).

== Rationale ==
Integral field spectroscopy (IFS) has become an important sub-discipline of astronomy with the proliferation of large aperture, high-resolution telescopes where there is a need to study the [[Spectrum|spectra]] of extended objects as a function of position, or of clusters of many discrete stars or point sources in a small field.  Such [[Astronomical spectroscopy|spectroscopic]] investigations have previously been carried out with [[long-slit spectroscopy|long-slit spectrographs]] in which the spectrum is dispersed perpendicular to the slit, and spatial resolution is obtained in the dimension along the slit.  Then by stepping the position of the slit, the spectrum of points in the imaged field can be obtained, but the process is comparatively slow, and wasteful of potentially restricted telescope time.  Integral field spectrographs are used to speed up such observations by simultaneously obtaining spectra in a two-dimensional field. As the spatial resolution of telescopes in space (and also of ground-based instruments using adaptive optics) has rapidly improved in recent years, the need for such multiplexed instruments has become more and more pressing.

== Methods ==

=== Image slicer  ===

In this approach, an image is sliced&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Image Slicer|url=https://astrospectroscopy.wordpress.com/image-slicer/|accessdate=30 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (using for example a Bowen image slicer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Image slicer|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/283276/image-slicer|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|publisher=[[Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.]]|accessdate=30 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;) in the image-plane and re-arranged such that different parts of the image all fall onto a slit and a dispersing element, such that a spectrum is obtained for a larger area of interest. Another way to think of this is that the slit is optically cut into smaller pieces and re-imaged onto the image-plane at multiple locations.

An instrument using this technique is for example UVES&lt;ref&gt;

|bibcode=2000SPIE.4008..534D}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Very Large Telescope]].

=== Lenslet array  ===

In this type of IFU, a lenslet array is placed in the spectrograph entrance slits plane, essentially acting as spatial pixels or '' spaxels ''. All beams generated by the lenslet array are then fed through a dispersive element and imaged by a camera, resulting in a spectrum for each individual lenslet.

Instruments like SAURON&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SAURON – Spectrographic Areal Unit for Research on Optical Nebulae|url=http://www.strw.leidenuniv.nl/sauron/|accessdate=30 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; on the [[William Herschel Telescope]] and the [[Spectro-Polarimetric High-Contrast Exoplanet Research|SPHERE]] IFS&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SPHERE IFS: the spectro differential imager of the VLT for exoplanets search|bibcode=2008SPIE.7014E..3EC|doi=10.1117/12.788366}}&lt;/ref&gt; subsystem on the [[Very Large Telescope|VLT]] use this technique.

=== Fibers  ===

Here, the light of targets of interest is captured by an array of fibers, forming the spectrographs entrance slits plane. The other end of the fibers are arranged along a single slit such that one obtains a spectrum for each fiber.

This technique is used by instruments in many telescopes
(such as INTEGRAL&lt;ref&gt;

|publisher=Isaac Newton Group of Telescopes

and particularly in currently ongoing large surveys of galaxies, such as [[Calar Alto Legacy Integral Field Area Survey|CALIFA]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CALIFA: Calar Alto Legacy Integral Field Area survey
|url=http://califa.caha.es
|publisher=CALIFA Survey
|accessdate=10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Calar Alto Observatory]], 
SAMI&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=5 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Australian Astronomical Observatory]],
and MaNGA&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|title=MaNGA: SDSS-III
|url=http://www.sdss3.org/future/manga.php
|publisher=Sloan Digital Sky Survey
|accessdate=5 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is one of the surveys making up the next phase of the [[Sloan Digital Sky Survey]].

=== Diverse Field Spectroscopy ===

A recent development is [[diverse field spectroscopy]] which combines the benefit of IFS with [[multi-object spectroscopy]] (MOS). MOS is used to collect  light from many discrete objects over a wide field. This does not record spatial information - just the spectrum of the total light collected within each  sampling aperture (usually the core of a positionable optical fibre or a slitlet cut in a mask at the telescope focus).  in contrast, IFS obtains complete, spatially resolved coverage over a small field.  The MOS targets are generally faint objects at the limits of detection such as primeval galaxies. As telescopes get bigger it is apparent that these  actually have blobby and confused structure that requires the observer to carefully select which parts of the field will be passed through to the spectrographs since it is not feasible to carpet the whole field with a single huge IFU. DFS is an instrument  paradigm that allows the observer to select arbitrary combinations of contiguous and isolated regions of the sky to maximise observing efficiency and scientific return. Various technologies are under development including  robotic switch-yards and photonic optical switches.

== Other approaches ==
Other techniques can achieve the same ends at different wavelengths. The ACIS [[Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer]] on NASA's [[Chandra X-Ray Observatory]] is an example that obtains spectral information by direct measurement of the energy of each photon. This approach is much harder at longer wavelengths because the photons are less energetic. However progress has been made even at optical and near-infrared wavelengths using pixellated detectors such as [[superconducting tunnel junction]]s. At radio wavelengths, simultaneous spectral information is obtainable with heterodyne receivers.

== Hyperspectral imaging ==
More generally, integral field spectroscopy is a subset of 3D-imaging techniques (also known as [[hyperspectral imaging]] and 3D spectroscopy). Other techniques rely on generation of a path difference between interfering beams using electro-mechanical scanning techniques. Examples include [[Fourier transform spectroscopy]] employing a [[Michelson interferometer]] layout and [[Fabry–Pérot interferometry]]. Although, to a first order of approximation, all such techniques are equivalent in that they generate the same number of  resolution elements in a [[datacube]] (with axes labelled by the two-spatial coordinates plus wavelength) in the same time, they are not equivalent when sources of noise are considered. For example, scanning instruments, although requiring fewer costly detector elements, are inefficient when the background is varying because, unlike IFS, the exposure of the signal and background are not made at the same time. For bio-medical science, ''in vivo'' studies also require simultaneous data collection.

'''Irajá Damiani Pinto''' (July 3, 1919 – June 21, 2014), was a Brazilian [[paleontologist]] and professor at the [[Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul]] (UFRGS in Portuguese), a member of the [[Brazilian Academy of Sciences]], and a two time president of the [[Brazilian Geological Society]].&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|title=Nota de falecimento: Prof. Irajá Damiani Pinto|date= 2014-06-23|url= http://www.sbpbrasil.org/pt/novidades?id_novidade=328&amp;pag=2|website=Sociedade Brasileira de Paleontologia|language=Portuguese|accessdate=2014-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography==
Irajá Damiani Pinto was born in [[Porto Alegre]], [[Rio Grande do Sul]], Brazil, on July 3, 1919 &lt;ref name=Iraja_Damiani_Pinto&gt;[http://www.abc.org.br/~iraja  Curriculo de Irajá Damiani Pinto.]&lt;/ref&gt;

He studied ''Ginásio Nossa Senhora do Rosário''. Attended the 2nd grade at ''Colégio Universitário Estadual Julio de Castilhos''. In 1942, he began his studies of Natural History in the Faculty of Philosophy of the then University of Porto Alegre. He graduated [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in 1944. In 1945, even as a student in the undergraduate course, was hired as Assistant Chair of Geology and Paleontology. That year he participated in his first scientific excursion led by Dr. [[Llewellyn Ivor Price]], who contributed much to his scientific orientation. In 1945 he carried out the DNPM, in [[Rio de Janeiro]], with Dr. Paul Ericksen de Oliveira and directed by Dr. [[Llewellyn Ivor Price]], and began the library of Geology and Paleontology at the University. In 1957 he helped create the course in [[geology]] of [[UFRGS]], one of the first in Brazil.&lt;ref name=Iraja_Damiani_Pinto /&gt;

The genus of [[cynodont]] ''[[Irajatherium]]'' is in his honor, in addition to the [[Institute of Geosciences of the Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul|Museum of Paleontology Irajá Damiani Pinto]].

In [[atomic physics]], the '''kubo gap''' is the average spacing that exists between consecutive [[energy levels]]. The units of measure are [[meV]] or millielectron volts. It varies with an [[inverse relationship]] to the [[nuclear physics|nuclearity]].

As the material in question is viewed from the bulk and atomic levels, we can see that the kubo gap goes from a smaller to larger value respectively. As the kubo gap increases there is also a decrease in the [[density of states]] located at the [[Fermi level]]. The kubo gap can also have an effect on the properties associated with the material. It is possible to control the kubo gap which will then cause the system to become [[metal]]lic or [[nonmetallic]]. The [[electrical conductivity]] and [[magnetic susceptibility]] are also both influenced by the kubo gap and vary according to the relative size of the kubo gap.

A '''magnet keeper''', also known historically as an '''armature''', is a [[Paramagnetism|paramagnetic]] bar made from soft iron or steel, which is placed across the poles of a [[permanent magnet]] to help preserve the strength of the magnet by completing the [[magnetic circuit]]; it is important for magnets that have a low magnetic [[coercivity]], such as [[alnico]] magnets.{{Citation needed|reason=Keepers protect magnets from each other - evidence for preventing "self demagnetization" is lacking|date=April 2018}}

Keepers also have a useful safety function, as they stop external metal being attracted to the magnet.

Most magnets do not need a keeper, only those with low coercivity, meaning that they are easily susceptible to stray fields. 

A magnet can be considered as the sum of many little magnetic domains, which may only be a few microns or smaller in size. Each domain carries its own small magnetic field, which can point in any direction. When all the domains are pointing in the same direction, the fields add, yielding a strong magnet. When these all point in random directions, they cancel each other, and the net magnetic field is zero.

In magnets with low coercivity, the direction in which the magnetic domains are pointing is easily swayed by external fields, such as the [[Earth's magnetic field]] or perhaps by the stray fields caused by flowing currents in a nearby electrical circuit. Given enough time, such magnets may find their domains randomly oriented, and hence their net magnetization greatly weakened. A keeper for low-coercivity magnets is just a strong permanent magnet that keeps all the domains pointing the same way and realigns those that may have gone astray.

'''Mass structure''' is a [[structure]], natural or manufactured, that is made by piling up of materials.&lt;ref&gt;[http://schools.cbe.ab.ca/b682/pdfs/Science%207/Structures%20and%20Forces%20T1-2.pdf Structures and Forces]&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of mass structures include [[pyramids]], [[igloos]], and [[beaver dams]].

'''Multiple-classification ripple-down rules (MCRDR)''' is an incremental [[knowledge acquisition]] technique which preserves the benefits and essential strategy of [[ripple-down rules]] (RDR) in handling the multiple classifications. MCRDR, the extension of RDR, is based on the assumption that the knowledge an expert provides is essentially a justification for a conclusion in a particular context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | author=B.Kang, P. Compton and P.Preston | title=Multiple classification ripple down rules: evaluation and possibilities | booktitle=In The 9th Knowledge Acquisition for Knowledge Based Systems Workshop | year=1995 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implementations==
Below is a list of implementations of MCRDR
* The alpha version of RDR(MCRDR) Framework was developed by UNSW and UTAS Research Team and funded by ARC (System available at [http://bestrdr.info/programs/ BESTRDR])
* RDR(MCRDR) document classifier was developed by Dr.Yang Sok Kim and AProf.Byeong Ho Kang (System available at [http://bestrdr.info/programs/ BESTRDR])
* RDR(MCRDR) smart expert system was developed by UTAS Research Team and funded by Hyundai Steel.
* Pacific Knowledge Systems (PKS) uses a commercial product called RippleDown Expert that is based on Multiple Classification Ripple Down Rules
* [http://www.medscope.com.au Medscope Medication Review Mentor] uses Multiple Classification Ripple Down Rules to identify adverse drug interactions with a patient's medicines regimen

==BEST RDR Warehouse==
[[bestrdr.info|BEST-RDR]] (Best Expert System Technique – Ripple Down Rule) website is freely accessible RDR publication and system warehouse that helps you to find programs and publications about RDR. A great amount of publications and programs based on RDR (MCRDR) are available to public.

What functions are available in the BEST RDR?
# BEST-RDR website provides detailed explanation of what the RDR and MCRDR are
# BEST-RDR provides every RDR(MCRDR) publication details from 1987–2013.
# BEST-RDR provides sources of various RDR(MCRDR) based system for download

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5131">The '''National Atmospheric Release Advisory Center''' (NARAC) is located at the University of California's [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]]. It is a national support and resource center for planning, real-time assessment, emergency response, and detailed studies of incidents involving a wide variety of hazards, including nuclear, radiological, chemical, biological, and natural emissions.

NARAC provides tools and services to federal, state and local governments, that map the probable spread of hazardous material accidentally or intentionally released into the atmosphere.

NARAC provides [[atmospheric dispersion modeling|atmospheric plume predictions]] in time for an emergency manager to decide if protective action is necessary to protect the health and safety of people in affected areas.

== The NARAC facility includes ==

* Scientific and technical staff who provide support and training for NARAC tools, as well as quality assurance and detailed analysis of atmospheric releases.
* 24 hour x 7 day on-duty or on-call staff.
* Training facility.
* An Operations Center with uninterruptible power, backup power generators, and robust computer systems.
* Links to over 100 emergency operations centers on the U.S.
* A team of research and operational staff with expertise in atmospheric research, operational meteorology, numerical modeling, computer science, software engineering, geographical information systems, computer graphics, hazardous material (radiological, chemical, biological) properties and effects.

==The Emergency Response System: Real time dispersion modeling==

The NARAC emergency response central modeling system consists of an integrated suite of [[meteorology|meteorological]] and [[atmospheric dispersion modeling|atmospheric dispersion models]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Turner, D.B.|title=Workbook of atmospheric dispersion estimates: an introduction to dispersion modeling|edition=2nd|publisher=CRC Press|year=1994|isbn=1-56670-023-X}} [http://www.crcpress.com/shopping_cart/products/product_detail.asp?sku=L1023&amp;parent_id=&amp;pc= www.crcpress.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071105075907/http://www.crcpress.com/shopping_cart/products/product_detail.asp?sku=L1023&amp;parent_id=&amp;pc= |date=2007-11-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Beychok, M.R.|title=[[Fundamentals Of Stack Gas Dispersion]]|edition=4th|publisher=author-published|year=2005|isbn=0-9644588-0-2}} [http://www.air-dispersion.com www.air-dispersion.com]&lt;/ref&gt; The meteorological [[data assimilation]] model, ADAPT, constructs fields of such variables as the mean [[wind]]s, [[pressure]], [[Precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]], [[temperature]], and [[turbulence]].&lt;ref&gt;Sugiyama, G., and S.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14022">'''Protein chemical shift prediction''' is a branch of biomolecular [[nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy]] that aims to accurately calculate protein [[chemical shift]]s from protein coordinates. Protein chemical shift prediction was first attempted in the late 1960s using semi-empirical methods applied to protein structures solved by [[X-ray crystallography]].&lt;ref name=pmid21241884 /&gt;  Since that time protein chemical shift prediction has evolved to employ much more sophisticated approaches including [[quantum mechanics]], [[machine learning]] and empirically derived chemical shift hypersurfaces.&lt;ref name=pmid21241884 /&gt; The most recently developed methods exhibit remarkable precision and accuracy.

==Protein chemical shifts==
NMR [[chemical shift]]s are often called the mileposts of [[nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy]]. Chemists have used chemical shifts for more than 50 years as highly reproducible, easily measured parameters to map out the covalent structure of small organic molecules. Indeed, the sensitivity of NMR [[chemical shift]]s to the type and character of neighbouring [[atom]]s, combined with their reasonably predictable tendencies has made them invaluable for both deciphering and describing the structure of thousands of newly synthesized or newly isolated compounds&lt;ref name=pmid21241884&gt;{{cite journal |title=Interpreting protein chemical shift data|last=Wishart|first=DS|journal=Progress in Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy|date=Feb 2011|volume=58|pages=62–87|pmid=21241884|doi=10.1016/j.pnmrs.2010.07.004|issue=1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Importance of protein chemical shift prediction==
Predicted or estimated protein chemical shifts can be used to assist with the chemical shift assignment process. This is especially true if a similar (or identical) protein structure has been solved by X-ray crystallography.  In this case, the three-dimensional structure can be used to estimate what the NMR chemical shifts should be and thereby simplify the process of assigning the experimentally observed chemical shifts.  Predicted/estimated protein chemical shifts can also be used to identify incorrect or mis-assignments, to correct mis-referenced or incorrectly referenced chemical shifts, to optimize protein structures via chemical shift refinement and to identify the relative contributions of different electronic or geometric effects to nucleus-specific shifts.&lt;ref name=pmid21241884 /&gt; Protein chemical shifts can also be used to identify secondary structures, to estimate [[backbone chain|backbone]] torsion angles, to determine the location of [[aromatic rings]], to assess [[cysteine]] oxidation states, to estimate solvent exposure and to measure [[backbone chain|backbone]] flexibility.&lt;ref name=pmid21448735 /&gt;

==Progress in chemical shift prediction programs==
Significant progress in [[chemical shift]] prediction has been made through continuous improvements in our understanding of the key physico-chemical factors contributing to chemical shift changes.  These improvements have also been helped along through significant computational advancements

The first is based on using sequence/structure alignment against protein [[chemical shift]] databases, the second is based on directly calculating shifts from atomic coordinates, and the third is based on using a combination of the two approaches.&lt;ref name=pmid21241884 /&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid21448735 /&gt;

*Predicting shifts from coordinate data / structure: 
**Semi-classical methods: employ empirical equations derived from [[classical physics]] and experimental data&lt;ref name=pmid21241884 /&gt;
**Quantum mechanical (QM) methods:  employ [[density functional theory]] (DFT)&lt;ref name=pmid21241884 /&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid12766419 /&gt;
**Empirical methods: rely on using [[chemical shift]] ‘‘hypersurfaces" or related "structure/shift" tables&lt;ref name=pmid21241884 /&gt;
*Hybrid Methods: combining the above two methods&lt;ref name=pmid21241884 /&gt;

==The emergence of hybrid prediction methods==
By early 2000, several research groups realized that protein chemical shifts could be more efficiently and accurately calculated by combining different methods together as shown in Figure 1. This led to the development of several programs and web servers that rapidly calculate protein chemical shifts when provided with protein coordinate data.&lt;ref name=pmid21241884 /&gt; These “hybrid” programs, along with some of their features and URLs, are listed below in Table 1.

==Performance comparison of modern protein chemical shift prediction programs==
This table (Figure 2) lists the correlation coefficients between the experimentally observed backbone chemical shifts and the calculated/predicted backbone shifts for different chemical shift predictors using an identical test set of 61 test proteins.

==Coverage and speed==
Different methods have different levels of coverage and rates of calculation.  Some methods only calculate or predict chemical shifts for backbone atoms (6 atom types).  Some calculate chemical shifts for backbone and certain side chain atoms (C and N only) and still others are able to calculate shifts for all atoms (40 atom types).  For chemical shift refinement there is a need for rapid calculation as thousands of structures are generated during a molecular dynamics or simulated annealing run and their chemical shifts must be calculated equally rapidly.

{{anchor|Else Holm}}'''Ragnar Holm''' (born 6 May 1879 in [[Skara]], died in 1970), was a Swedish physicist and researcher in [[electrical engineering]], who was partially active in Germany and the United States.&lt;ref name="Holm_1969"/&gt;

==Career==
In 1904, Holm became [[Licentiate (degree)|licentiate]] in philosophy (PhL) at [[Uppsala University]], and earned his PhD in 1908.&lt;ref name="Holm_1908"/&gt; From 1906 to 1908 he studied at the [[University of Göttingen]] in Germany. In 1908 to 1909 he was a lecturer in Stockholm. Between 1909 and 1919 he worked as a physicist for [[Siemens &amp; Halske]] in Berlin. In 1919 to 1921 he was a physicist and teacher at the {{ill|Telegraphic Education Center|sv|Telegrafverkets undervisningsanstalt}} in Stockholm, and between 1921 and 1927 associate professor at the {{ill|Technical High School in Örebro|sv|Rudbecksgymnasiet, Örebro}}. Between 1927 and 1945 he worked again for Siemens &amp; Halske. From 1947 he was a consulting physicist at [[Stackpole Carbon Company]] in St. Petersburg, Marys, Pennsylvania, USA.

==Research==
Holm's research area included the study of [[electrical discharge]]s, but his main focus was on [[electrical contact]]s, where he was a world-leading authority. His book ''Electric Contacts'', originally published in 1946,&lt;ref name="Holm_1946"/&gt; is still used as a standard work in the field (in its fourth edition of 1967).&lt;ref name="Holm_1958"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Holm_1967"/&gt;

The Swedish {{ill|Library of the Royal Institute of Technology|sv|Kungliga Tekniska högskolans bibliotek}} (KTHB) maintains a special literature collection (''Holm Collection'') related to Ragnar Holm's research.&lt;ref name="R5"/&gt;

==Awards==
In 1971, the year after Holm's death, the [[IEEE]] established the ''Ragnar Holm Scientific Achievement Award'' ("Ragnar Holm Award") for efforts in the field of electrical contacts. The prize has been awarded annually since 1972.&lt;ref name="R6"/&gt;

Since 1999, the Swedish [[Royal Institute of Technology]] (KTH) has distributed the ''Ragnar Holm plaque'' to a young physicist at the beginning of the research career, after assessing dissertations and articles in physics, primarily related to Holm's previous research on electrical contacts. Every second year, the plaque is awarded to a Swedish recipient, and every two years the selection is international.

A scoring rubric is an attempt to communicate expectations of quality around a task. In many cases, scoring rubrics are used to delineate consistent criteria for grading. Because the criteria are public, a scoring rubric allows teachers and students alike to evaluate criteria, which can be complex and subjective. A scoring rubric can also provide a basis for self-evaluation, reflection, and peer review. It is aimed at accurate and fair assessment, fostering understanding, and indicating a way to proceed with subsequent learning/teaching. This integration of performance and feedback is called ongoing assessment or [[formative assessment]].

Several common features of scoring rubrics can be distinguished, according to [[Bernie Dodge]] and Nancy Pickett:{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}
*focus on measuring a stated objective (performance, behavior, or quality)
*use a range to rate performance
*contain specific performance characteristics arranged in levels indicating either the developmental sophistication of the strategy used or the degree to which a standard has been met.

==Components of a scoring rubric==
Scoring rubrics include one or more dimensions on which performance is rated, definitions and examples that illustrate the attribute(s) being measured, and a rating scale for each dimension.  Dimensions are generally referred to as '''criteria''', the rating scale as '''levels''', and definitions as '''descriptors'''.

Herman, Aschbacher, and Winters&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Herman|first1=Joan|title=A Practical Guide to Alternative Assessment|date=January 1992|publisher=Association for Supervision &amp; Curriculum Deve|isbn=978-0871201973}}&lt;/ref&gt; distinguish the following elements of a scoring rubric:
*One or more traits or dimensions that serve as the basis for judging the student response
*Definitions and examples to clarify the meaning of each trait or dimension
*A scale of values on which to rate each dimension
*Standards of excellence for specified performance levels accompanied by models or examples of each level

Since the 1980s, many scoring rubrics have been presented in a graphic format, typically as a grid. Studies of scoring rubric effectiveness now consider the efficiency of a grid over, say, a text-based list of criteria.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

Rubrics can be classified as holistic or analytic. Holistic rubrics integrate all aspects of the work into a single overall rating of the work. For example, "the terms and grades commonly used at university (i.e., excellent – A, good – B, average – C, poor – D, and weak – E) usually express an assessor’s overall rating of a piece of work. When a research article or thesis is evaluated, the reviewer is asked to express their opinion in holistic terms – accept as is, accept with minor revisions, require major revisions for a second review, or reject. The classification response is a weighted judgement by the assessor taking all things into account at once; hence, holistic. In contrast, an analytic rubric specifies various dimensions or components of the product or process that are evaluated separately. The same rating scale labels may be used as the holistic, but it is applied to various key dimensions or aspects separately rather than an integrated judgement. This separate specification means that on one dimension the work could be excellent, but on one or more other dimensions the work might be poor to average. Most commonly, analytic rubrics have been used by teachers to score student writing when the teacher awards a separate score for such facets of written language as conventions or mechanics (i.e., spelling, punctuation, and grammar), organisation, content or ideas, and style. They are also used in many other domains of the school curriculum (e.g., performing arts, sports and athletics, studio arts, wood and metal technologies, etc.). By breaking the whole into significant dimensions or components and rating them separately, it is expected that better information will be obtained by the teacher and the student about what needs to be worked on next." (Brown, Irving, &amp; Keegan, 2014, p. 55).&lt;ref&gt;Brown, G. T. L., Irving, S. E., &amp; Keegan, P. J. (2014). An introduction to educational assessment, measurement, and evaluation: Improving the quality of teacher-based assessment (3rd ed.). Auckland, NZ: Dunmore Publishing. {{ISBN|9781927212097}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Steps to create a scoring rubric==
Scoring rubrics may help students become thoughtful evaluators of their own and others’ work and may reduce the amount of time teachers spend evaluating student work. Here is a seven-step method to creating and using a scoring rubric for writing assignments:&lt;ref&gt;Goodrich, H. (1996). “Understanding Rubrics.” Educational Leadership, 54 (4), 14-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

# Have students look at models of good versus "not-so-good" work. A teacher should provide sample assignments of variable quality for students to review.
# List the criteria to be used in the scoring rubric and allow for discussion of what counts as quality work. Asking for student feedback during the creation of the list also allows the teacher to assess the students’ overall writing experiences.
# Articulate gradations of quality. These hierarchical categories should concisely describe the levels of quality (ranging from bad to good) or development (ranging from beginning to mastery). They can be based on the discussion of the good versus not-so-good work samples or immature versus developed samples. Using a conservative number of gradations keeps the scoring rubric user-friendly while allowing for fluctuations that exist within the average range ("Creating Rubrics").
# Practice on models. Students can test the scoring rubrics on sample assignments provided by the instructor. This practice can build students' confidence by teaching them how the instructor would use the scoring rubric on their papers. It can also aid student/teacher agreement on the reliability of the scoring rubric.
# Ask for self and peer-assessment.
# Revise the work on the basis of that feedback. As students are working on their assignment, they can be stopped occasionally to do a self-assessment and then give and receive evaluations from their peers. Revisions should be based on the feedback they receive.
# Use teacher assessment, which means using the same scoring rubric the students used to assess their work. 

Additionally, for the implementation of self-assessment and peer assessment, that can be done with rubrics, there is a list of recommendations.&lt;ref&gt;Panadero, E., Jonsson, A., &amp; Strijbos, J. W. (2016). Scaffolding self-regulated learning through self-assessment and peer assessment: Guidelines for classroom implementation. In D. Laveault &amp; L. Allal (Eds.), Assessment for Learning: Meeting the challenge of implementation (pp. 311-326). New York: Springer.&lt;/ref&gt; Importantly, rubrics can be co-created with the students to increase their comprehension and use of the assessment criteria. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fraile|first=Juan|last2=Panadero|first2=Ernesto|last3=Pardo|first3=Rodrigo|date=June 2017|title=Co-creating rubrics: The effects on self-regulated learning, self-efficacy and performance of establishing assessment criteria with students|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0191491X1630205X|journal=Studies in Educational Evaluation|volume=53|pages=69–76|doi=10.1016/j.stueduc.2017.03.003|issn=0191-491X|hdl=10641/1292}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==When to use Rubrics==
It can be used in individual assessment within the course, or a project or capstone project. However, it can ideally be used when multiple evaluators are evaluating the assessment to get focus on the contributing attributes for the evaluation.  

==Etymology and history==
The traditional meanings of the word ''[[rubric]]'' stem from "a heading on a document (often written in red — from Latin, ''rubrica'', red ochre, red ink), or a direction for conducting church services".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/rubric | title=The definition of rubric}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drawing on definition 2 in the OED for this word &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/rubric | title=Rubric &amp;#124; Definition of rubric in English by Oxford Dictionaries}}&lt;/ref&gt; rubrics referred to the instructions on a test to the test-taker as to how questions were to be answered.

In modern education circles, rubrics have recently come to refer to an assessment tool. The first usage of the term in this new sense is from the mid-1990s, but scholarly articles from that time do not explain why the term was co-opted.  Perhaps rubrics are seen to act, in both cases, as [[metadata]] added to text to indicate what constitutes a successful use of that text. It may also be that the color of the traditional red marking pen is the common link.

As shown in the 1977 introduction to the International Classification of Diseases-9,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://wonder.cdc.gov/wonder/sci_data/codes/icd9/type_txt/icd9.asp | title=International Classification of Diseases - 9 (1975)}}&lt;/ref&gt; the term has long been used as medical labels for diseases and procedures. The bridge from medicine to education occurred through the construction of "Standardized Developmental Ratings." These were first defined for writing assessment in the mid-1970s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/search/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED174629&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=ED174629 | title=Standardized Developmental Ratings| date=1978-02-28| last1=Dirlam| first1=David| last2=Byrne| first2=Maureen}}&lt;/ref&gt; and used to train raters for New York State's Regents Exam in Writing by the late 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Dirlam, D. K. (1980). Classifiers and cognitive development. In S. &amp; C. Modgil (Eds.), Toward a Theory of Psychological Development. Windsor, England: NFER Publishing, 465-498&lt;/ref&gt; That exam required raters to use multidimensional standardized developmental ratings to determine a holistic score. The term "rubrics" was applied to such ratings by Grubb, 1981&lt;ref&gt;Grubb, Mel. (1981). Using Holistic Evaluation. Encino, Cal.: Glenco Publishing Company, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; in a book advocating holistic scoring rather than developmental rubrics. Developmental rubrics return to the original intent of standardized developmental ratings, which was to support student self-reflection and self-assessment as well as communication between an assessor and those being assessed. In this new sense, a scoring rubric is a set of [[:wikt:criteria|criteria]] and [[standardization|standards]] typically linked to learning objectives. It is used to assess or communicate about product, performance, or process tasks.

== Technical==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2013}}
One problem with scoring rubrics is that each level of fulfillment encompasses a wide range of marks. For example, if two students both receive a 'level four' mark on the [[Ontario rubric|Ontario system]], one might receive an 80% and the other 100%. In addition, a small change in scoring rubric evaluation caused by a small mistake may lead to an unnecessarily large change in numerical grade.  Adding further distinctions between levels does not solve the problem, because more distinctions make discrimination even more difficult. Both scoring problems may be alleviated by treating the definitions of levels as typical descriptions of whole products rather than the details of every element in them.

Scoring rubrics may also make marking schemes more complicated for students. Showing one mark may be inaccurate, as receiving a perfect score in one section may not be very significant in the long run if that specific strand is not weighted heavily. Some may also find it difficult to comprehend an assignment having multiple distinct marks, and therefore it is unsuitable for some younger children. In such cases it is better to incorporate the rubrics into conversation with the child than to give a mark on a paper. For example, a child who writes an "egocentric" story (depending too much on ideas not accessible to the reader) might be asked what her best friend thinks of it (suggesting a move in the audience dimension to the "correspondence" level). Thus, when used effectively scoring rubrics help students to improve their weaknesses.

Multidimensional rubrics also allow students to compensate for a lack of ability in one strand by improving another one. For instance, a student who has difficulty with sentence structure may still be able to attain a relatively high mark, if sentence structure is not weighted as heavily as other dimensions such as audience, perspective or time frame.

Another advantage of a scoring rubric is that it clearly shows what criteria must be met for a student to demonstrate quality on a product, process, or performance task.

Scoring rubrics can also improve scoring consistency. Grading is more reliable while using a rubric than with out one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jonsson|first1=Anders|last2=Svingby|first2=Gunilla|title=The use of scoring rubrics: Reliability, validity and educational consequences|journal=Educational Research Review|date=2007|volume=2|issue=2|pages=130–144|doi=10.1016/j.edurev.2007.05.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Educators can refer to a rubric while scoring assignments to keep grading consistent between students. Teachers can also use rubrics to keep their scoring consistent between other teachers who teach the same class.

Ovaska on the synthesis of tetracyclic terpenoid natural products, including [[phorbol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.conncoll.edu/directories/faculty-profiles/timo-ovaska/ovaska-research-group/|title=Ovaska Research Group|website=Connecticut College|language=en|access-date=2018-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2015-09-23|title=Bright Young Minds: Meet 10 scientists who are making their mark|journal=Science News|language=en|volume=188|issue=7|pages=20–26|doi=10.1002/scin.2015.188007018|issn=0036-8423}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Graduate Studies ===

Reisman obtained her Ph.D. from [[Yale University]] in 2006, working with [[John L. Wood]] on the total synthesis of (±)-Welwitindolinone A Isonitrile.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reisman|first=Sarah E.|last2=Ready|first2=Joseph M.|last3=Weiss|first3=Matthew M.|last4=Hasuoka|first4=Atsushi|last5=Hirata|first5=Makoto|last6=Tamaki|first6=Kazuhiko|last7=Ovaska|first7=Timo V.|last8=Smith|first8=Catherine J.|last9=Wood|first9=John L.|date=February 2008|title=Evolution of a Synthetic Strategy:  Total Synthesis of (±)-Welwitindolinone A Isonitrile|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|language=en|volume=130|issue=6|pages=2087–2100|doi=10.1021/ja076663z|pmid=18198870|issn=0002-7863}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reisman's work included methodological developments towards a generalized skeleton, using nitrone cyclization and oxindole formation as linchpin transforms.

=== Postdoctoral Studies ===

Reisman was an [[National Institutes of Health|NIH]] Postdoctoral Fellow in the lab of [[Eric Jacobsen|Eric N. Jacobsen]] at Harvard University and worked with [[Abigail Doyle]] to develop an enantioselective substitution of silyl ketenes onto an alkoxy chloride via an oxacarbenium ion, using a novel [[Thiourea organocatalysis|thiourea organocatalyst]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reisman|first=Sarah E.|last2=Doyle|first2=Abigail G.|last3=Jacobsen|first3=Eric N.|date=June 2008|title=Enantioselective Thiourea-Catalyzed Additions to Oxocarbenium Ions|journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society|language=EN|volume=130|issue=23|pages=7198–7199|doi=10.1021/ja801514m|issn=0002-7863|pmc=2574628|pmid=18479086}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Research ==
Reisman began her independent career as an Assistant Professor at Caltech in 2008 and was promoted directly to Full Professor in 2014.

The Reisman lab focuses on the synthesis of complex natural products and development of new chemical reactions. The group completed the first [[enantioselective]] total syntheses of (–)-acetylaranotin (40 years after its isolation),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Codelli|first=Julian A.|last2=Puchlopek|first2=Angela L.

'''Scientific research on the [[International Space Station]]''' is a collection of experiments that require one or more of the unusual conditions present in [[low Earth orbit]]. The primary fields of research include [[Zero g#Health effects of weightlessness|human research]], [[space medicine]], [[life science]]s, [[physical science]]s, [[astronomy]] and [[meteorology]].&lt;ref name="ISS overview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shuttlepresskit.com/ISS_OVR/index.htm|title=International Space Station Overview|publisher=ShuttlePressKit.com|date=3 June 1999|accessdate=17 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NASA Fields of Research"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pdlprod3.hosc.msfc.nasa.gov/A-fieldsresearch/index.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080123150641/http://pdlprod3.hosc.msfc.nasa.gov/A-fieldsresearch/index.html|archivedate=23 January 2008|title=Fields of Research|date=26 June 2007|publisher = NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NASA ISS Goals"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pdlprod3.hosc.msfc.nasa.gov/B-gettingonboard/index.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071208091537/http://pdlprod3.hosc.msfc.nasa.gov/B-gettingonboard/index.html|archivedate=8 December 2007| title = Getting on Board|date = 26 June 2007| publisher=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[NASA Authorization Act of 2005|2005 NASA Authorization Act]] designated the American segment of the International Space Station as a national laboratory with the goal of increasing the use of the ISS by other federal agencies and the private sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NASA Authorization Act 2005|url=http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=109_cong_public_laws&amp;docid=f:publ155.109.pdf|publisher=[[United States Government Printing Office]]|date=30 December 2005|accessdate=6 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research on the ISS improves knowledge about the effects of long-term space exposure on the human body. Subjects currently under study include [[muscle atrophy]], [[Osteoporosis|bone loss]], and fluid shift. The data will be used to determine whether [[space colonisation]] and lengthy [[human spaceflight]] are feasible. As of 2006, data on bone loss and muscular atrophy suggest that there would be a significant risk of fractures and movement problems if astronauts landed on a planet after a lengthy interplanetary cruise (such as the six-month journey time required to [[Manned mission to Mars|fly to Mars]]).&lt;ref name="JCB"&gt;{{cite book|author=Jay Buckey|title=Space Physiology|publisher=Oxford University Press USA|date=23 February 2006|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/0195137256|isbn=978-0-19-513725-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn17476-ion-engine-could-one-day-power-39day-trips-to-mars.html?full=true|publisher=New Scientist|accessdate=8 January 2010|date=24 July 2009|author=List Grossman|title=Ion engine could one day power 39-day trips to Mars}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Large scale medical studies are conducted aboard the ISS via the [[National Space Biomedical Research Institute]] (NSBRI). Prominent among these is the [[Advanced Diagnostic Ultrasound in Microgravity]] study in which astronauts (including former ISS Commanders [[Leroy Chiao]] and [[Gennady Padalka]]) perform ultrasound scans under the guidance of remote experts. The study considers the diagnosis and treatment of medical conditions in space. Usually, there is no physician on board the ISS, and diagnosis of medical conditions is a challenge. It is anticipated that remotely guided ultrasound scans will have application on Earth in emergency and rural care situations where access to a trained physician is difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/station/science/experiments/ADUM.html|date=1 May 2009|accessdate=1 October 2009|author=Brooke Boen|publisher=NASA|title=Advanced Diagnostic Ultrasound in Microgravity (ADUM)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Sishir Rao|display-authors=etal|date=2008|title=A Pilot Study of Comprehensive Ultrasound Education at the Wayne State University School of Medicine|journal=Journal of Ultrasound in Medicine|volume=27|pages=745–749|url=http://www.jultrasoundmed.org/cgi/content/abstract/27/5/745|pmid=18424650|issue=5|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100713124805/http://www.jultrasoundmed.org/cgi/content/abstract/27/5/745|archivedate=2010-07-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Michael Fincke|display-authors=etal|date=2004|title=Evaluation of Shoulder Integrity in Space: First Report of Musculoskeletal US on the International Space Station|journal=Radiology|issue= 2|pages=319–322|url=http://radiology.rsna.org/content/234/2/319.abstract|pmid=15533948|doi=10.1148/radiol.2342041680|volume=234}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers are investigating the effect of the station's near-weightless environment on the evolution, development, growth and internal processes of plants and animals. In response to some of this data, NASA wants to investigate [[microgravity]]'s effects on the growth of three-dimensional, human-like tissues, and the unusual protein crystals that can be formed in space.&lt;ref name="NASA Fields of Research"/&gt;

The investigation of the physics of fluids in microgravity will allow researchers to model the behaviour of fluids better. Because fluids can be almost completely combined in microgravity, physicists investigate fluids that do not mix well on Earth. In addition, an examination of reactions that are slowed by low gravity and temperatures will give scientists a deeper understanding of [[superconductivity]].&lt;ref name="NASA Fields of Research"/&gt;

The study of [[materials science]] is an important ISS research activity, with the objective of reaping economic benefits through the improvement of techniques used on the ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://science.nasa.gov/newhome/headlines/msad15sep99_1.htm|title=Materials Science 101|publisher=Science@NASA|accessdate=18 June 2009|date=15 September 1999|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090614033947/http://science.nasa.gov/newhome/headlines/msad15sep99_1.htm|archivedate=14 June 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other areas of interest include the effect of the low gravity environment on combustion, through the study of the efficiency of burning and control of emissions and pollutants. These findings may improve our knowledge about energy production, and lead to economic and environmental benefits. Future plans are for the researchers aboard the ISS to examine [[aerosol]]s, [[ozone]], [[water vapor|water vapour]], and [[oxide]]s in Earth's atmosphere, as well as [[cosmic ray]]s, [[cosmic dust]], [[antimatter]], and [[dark matter]] in the universe.&lt;ref name="NASA Fields of Research"/&gt;

The '''Society for the History of Alchemy and Chemistry''', founded as the ''Society for the Study of [[Alchemy]] and Early [[Chemistry]]'' in 1935, holds biennial meetings and a yearly Graduate Workshop, publishes the  journal ''[[Ambix]]'' and a biennial newsletter ''Chemical Intelligence'', and offers prizes and grants to scholars. Its members represent twenty-eight countries.

== History ==
The Society was first established in November 1935 by [[J.R. Partington]] (1886-1965), [[Frank Sherwood Taylor]] (1897-1956), [[Douglas McKie]] (1896-1967), and Gerard Heym (1888-1972), and named the Society for the Study of Alchemy and Early Chemistry.&lt;ref&gt;A full list of members can be found in: W.H. Brock, “Exploring Early Modern Chemistry: The First Twenty-Five Years of the Society for the Study of Alchemy and Early Modern Chemistry 1935-1960,” in ''Ambix'', 58, no. 3 (2011): 191-214, 212-213. Cf: Brock, The Case for the Poisonous Socks, 48-9.&lt;/ref&gt; Its object was “the study of alchemy and early chemistry in their scientific and historical aspects, and the publication of relevant material.”&lt;ref&gt;W.H. Brock, “Exploring Early Modern Chemistry,” 193.&lt;/ref&gt;
Sherwood Taylor was responsible for launching the Society’s journal ''Ambix'' in May 1937, with J.R. Partington as its first [[Chairman]]. From these early days onwards, the Society worked on "chemistry and chemical technology in antiquity and the Latin West and the development of iatrochemistry and chemical philosophy."&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey L. Sturchio, "Ambix. Journal of the Society for the History of Alchemy and Chemistry." ISIS 81, no. 2, (1990): 300-302 (review)&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Second World War]], the Society for the History of Alchemy &amp; Early Chemistry was closed down, but it was re-established again in 1946, with the second volume of ''Ambix'' published in the same year. From 1956 onwards, when Desmond Geoghegan became editor, ''Ambix'' began to extend its readership and its period of historical coverage to the time of [[John Dalton]] and the nineteenth century. The Society altered its name to the Society for the History of Alchemy and Chemistry in 1975.

== Publications ==
[[File:Ambix vol. 1 no. 1 1937 kopie.png|thumb]] The Society’s journal ''Ambix'' is published four times a year in February, May, August, and November. Papers are refereed by an international [[editorial board]]. Its coverage is wide and varied, ranging from studies in exoteric and esoteric alchemy to recent chemistry. Recently, more attention has been given to the history of alchemy, while Ambix continues to provide important reading for historians of chemistry.&lt;ref&gt;Sturchio, ISIS, 302.&lt;/ref&gt; The presentation of scientific ideas, methods and discoveries is made as non-technical as possible, consistent with academic rigour and scientific accuracy. Extensive [[book review|book reviews]] are published in each issue of ''Ambix''. Recent special issues include: The Royal Typographer and the Alchemist: Willem Silvius and [[John Dee]] (May 2017); From the Library to the Laboratory and Back Again (May 2016); and Chemical Knowledge in Transit (November 2015). In May 2013, 2014, and 2015 three special issues were published on Sites of Chemistry devoted to the eighteenth, nineteenth and twentieth centuries respectively, while the November 2014 special issue concerned Analysis and Synthesis in Medieval and Early Modern Europe.

In 2013, the Society launched the series Sources of Alchemy and Chemistry, which provides readers with critical editions and English translations of foundational texts in the history of alchemy and early chemistry. The readership of Ambix is international and includes historians, chemists, philosophers, and scholars in other disciplines. Issues of ''Ambix'' are sent to members and libraries around the world and are also available online free to members through the Society’s website ambix.org.

The Society publishes its newsletter Chemical Intelligence twice a year. This publication advertises and reports not only the Society’s events and activities, but also those of other organisations involved in the history of alchemy and chemistry. Chemical Intelligence is distributed to members by email and is made available free to the public online via [http://www.ambix.org/publications/chemical-intelligence/ www.ambix.org].

== Meetings ==
The Society generally organises a Spring meeting and an Autumn meeting each year. Recent topics included John Dee and [[Print Culture]]; Chemistry and its Audiences; Making Chemistry: History, Materials, and Practices; New and Old Themes in the History of Chemistry and Chemistry in Europe. The Society also organises annual postgraduate workshops usually held in the Autumn. Workshops have been held at Cambridge, London, Amsterdam, Utrecht, and Philadelphia.

== Prizes and Grants ==
The Society offers three prizes: the Partington Prize, awarded every three years for an original essay by a new scholar on any aspect of the history of alchemy and chemistry; the John and Martha Morris Award, which is also made every three years, for outstanding achievements in the history of modern chemistry or the history of the chemical industry; and the Oxford Part II Prize, which can be awarded in any year for an excellent history of chemistry thesis submitted for a Chemistry Part II at [[Oxford University]].

The Society further offers yearly grants, for which members of the Society may apply. The Society offers two types of competitive grants, both part of its Award Scheme. The New Scholars Awards are aimed to support research. This Award is open to postgraduate students and those who have obtained their PhD within five years as of the preceding 1 January. The second grant is the Subject Development Award, which supports activities such as seminars, workshops, colloquia, lecture series, conferences, etc. In addition, non-competitive grants may be awarded to individuals and organisations.

'''Systems theory in political science''' is a highly abstract, partly holistic view of [[politics]], influenced by [[cybernetics]]. The adaptation of [[system theory]] to [[political science]] was first conceived by [[David Easton]] in 1953.

==Overview==
In simple terms, Easton's [[behavioral]] approach to politics, proposed that a political system could be seen as a delimited (i.e. all political systems have precise boundaries) and fluid (changing) system of steps in decision making. Greatly simplifying his model:&lt;ref&gt;Easton, David. (1965). ''A Systems Analysis of Political Life''. New York: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt;
Influence of computers on the discipline of political science and the political system work within an environment.
The environment generates different demands from different section of society such as reservation system in the matter of a certain group,demand for better transportation etc.
* Step 1. changes in the social or physical environment surrounding a political system produce "demands" and "supports" for action or the status quo directed as "inputs" towards the political system, through political behavior.
* Step 2, these demands and supporting groups stimulate competition in a political system, leading to decisions or "outputs" directed at some aspect of the surrounding social or physical environment.
* Step 3, after a decision or output is made (e.g., a specific policy), it interacts with its environment, and if it produces change in the environment, there are "outcomes."
* Step 4, when a new policy interacts with its environment, outcomes may generate new demands or supports and groups in support or against the policy ("feedback") or a new policy on some related matter.
* Step 5, feedback, leads back to Step 1, forming a never-ending cycle.

If the system functions as described, then we have a "stable political system". If the system breaks down, then we have a "dysfunctional political system".

===Political analysis===
Easton aspired to make politics a science, that is, working with highly abstract models that described the regularities of patterns and processes in political life in general. In his view, the highest level of abstraction could make scientific generalizations about politics possible. In sum, politics should be seen as a whole, not as a collection of different problems to be solved.&lt;ref&gt;Easton, David. (1953). ''The Political System: An Inquiry into the State of Political Science''. New York: Alfred A. Knopf.&lt;/ref&gt;

His main model was driven by an organic view of politics, as if it were a living object. His theory is a statement of what makes political systems adapt and survive. He describes politics in a constant flux, thereby rejecting the idea of "equilibrium", so prevalent in some other political theories (see [[Institutionalism in political parties|institutionalism]]). Moreover, he rejects the idea that politics could be examined by looking at different levels of analysis. His abstractions could account for any group and demand at any given time. That is, interest group theory and elite theory can be subsumed in political systems analysis.&lt;ref&gt;Easton, David. (1965). ''A Framework for Political Analysis''. Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;
His theory was and is highly influential in the [[Pluralism (political theory)|pluralist tradition]] in political science. (see [[Harold Lasswell]] and [[Robert Dahl]])

In [[behavioral science]], a '''T-maze''' (or the variant '''Y-maze''') is a simple [[maze]] used in [[animal cognition]] experiments.&lt;ref name="olton"&gt;Olton, D.S. (1979).  Mazes, maps, and memory. ''[[American Psychologist]]'', 34, 583-596).&lt;/ref&gt; It is shaped like the letter [[T]] (or [[Y]]), providing the subject, typically a rodent, with a straightforward choice.
T-mazes are used to study how the rodents function with memory and spatial learning through applying various stimuli. Starting in the early 20th century, rodents were used in experiments such as the T-Maze. These concepts of T-mazes are used to assess rodent behavior. The different tasks, such as left-right discrimination and forced alternation, are mainly used with rodents to test reference and working memory.

== Apparatus ==


The T-maze is one of a group of various mazes of differing sizes and many shapes.&lt;ref name = Keefe&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = O'Keefe | first1 = J. | last2 = Dostrovsky | first2 = J. | year = 1971 | title = The hippocampus as a spatial map. Preliminary evidence from unit activity in the freely-moving rat | url = | journal = Brain Research | volume = 34 | issue = 1| pages = 171–175 | doi = 10.1016/0006-8993(71)90358-1 | pmid = 5124915 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the most simple, consisting of just two turns - right or left.  The maze is only able to be altered by blocking one of the two paths.  The basis behind the T-maze is to place the rat at the base of the maze. By placing a reward at one arm or both arms of the maze, the rat must make the choice of which path to take. The decision made by the rat can be a cause of a natural preference within the rat.  A study of alternation can be performed by repeating the experiment multiple times with no reward in either arm of the maze. Another experiment that can be performed is the alternation of rewards each time the experiment is performed, proving the rat will choose the arm that was not visited each time the experiment starts.

Rewards within the rats can be types of food, another rat within a cage, an odor, or a type of shelter. By performing this type of experiment, the rat's preferences can be determined. Examples of this could be a rat's food preferences, its familiarity with specific smells and scents, the attraction of the male and female within the maze, and whether a young rat prefers an adult female or an adult male. These simple experiments can determine the rat's psyche on multiple subjects, and ultimately divulge further into the rat's psychological characteristics. It is also important to consider the rodent's behavior. The use of spatial and non-spatial cues is very influential to research findings on memory, spatial learning and the long-term potential (LTP). These cues include the orientation of the maze, extra-maze cues and room configuration cues. Strategies may be affected by the rodent's ability to find cues in the room, the presence or absence of polarizing cues in the room, and the stability of the maze in the room. When analyzing and interpreting experimental data, researchers have to consider the orientation and configuration of the apparatus and cues in the room.

=== Other mazes ===

==== Multiple T-maze ====

This type of apparatus includes multiple T-mazes connected which result in a very complex maze. It is constructed of a high number of T-junctions. Each intersection remains the same length and scale, which gives every point within the maze a direct right or wrong answer. By not changing the size of the maze, it allows for the rat to focus on the decision and not be confused if the size of the maze was altered within the junctions. Multiple T-mazes are constructed to question response vs. place techniques and of cognitive direction and mapping.

An example of an experiment within a multiple T-maze was performed by allowing the rat to explore the multiple T-maze without a reward. After letting the rat roam, researchers restarted the maze again with a reward placed at the end of the maze. The rats with prior exposure to the maze were able to easily navigate through the maze to reach the reward. This experiment proved that rats have the ability to generate a cognitive map when exposed to their surroundings and can process this information when needed to complete a task.

==== Y-maze ====

Researchers have also created the Y-Maze which functions very similar to the T-maze. The Y-Maze is altered to have a more gradual change into the arms. The arms are also all equal in length and distance apart from one another. The Y-maze has proven to be easier for rats to understand the layout of the space and recognize rewards, similar pattern, and adapt to new experiments at a quicker pace.

==== [[Radial arm maze]] ====

This type of maze is constructed with a center platform with arms radiating from the center. The original maze had 8 spokes, but they have been constructed with as few as 3 and as many as 48 spokes. This type of maze is used to perform short-term memory experimentations on rats. Rats are examined on whether or not they have the ability to remember the arms they have already explored. This is determined by placing food pellets at each of the arms and the rat must only travel down each arm once and retrieve the pellet accordingly.

== Purpose ==
The concepts of T-mazes are used to assess rodent behavior.  The different tasks such as left-right discrimination and forced alternation are mainly used with rodents to test reference and working memory.  Maze research is used to show how the rodent’s behavior evolves with alternate strategies to do different tasks.

== Spatial learning ==
The spatial memory of the rat is responsible for recording information about the rat’s environment as well as its spatial orientation.&lt;ref name = Keefe /&gt; It is this spatial memory that allows the rat to navigate its way through the various types of mazes and challenges presented to it by the experimenters.  This also allows the rat to navigate the same maze multiple times while remembering the correct and incorrect pathways (unless the scientists change the paths in between tests).  In the T-maze this is relegated to a single left or right turn, but in more complex mazes it becomes a series of turns for the rat to remember in order to reach its goal and reward.  A poorly working spatial memory can result in a rat getting repeatedly lost in the maze regardless of how successful previous attempts were or how unchanged the maze is.

== Hippocampus ==
The [[hippocampus]] is located in the [[medial temporal lobe]] area of the brain and is responsible for governing spatial memory. In animals, this allows them to have a spatial map of their environment and it uses reference and working memory to accomplish this. It also has important functions that govern long and short-term memory as well as spatial navigation, both of which are required in order for the rat to correctly navigate the maze.

The '''Tartu–Moscow Semiotic School''' is a scientific [[school of thought]] in the field of [[semiotics]] that was formed in 1964 and led by [[Juri Lotman]]. Among the other members of this school were [[Boris Uspensky]], [[Vyacheslav Ivanov (philologist)|Vyacheslav Ivanov]], [[Vladimir Toporov]], [[Mikhail Gasparov]], [[Alexander Piatigorsky]], [[Isaak I. Revzin]], and others. As a result of their collective work, they established a theoretical framework around the [[semiotics of culture]].

==History==
The Tartu–Moscow School of Semiotics developed an original method of multidimensional [[cultural analysis]]. The languages of culture are interpreted as secondary modelling systems in relation to verbal language. This method permits a productive understanding of the use of different languages of culture.

This school is widely known for its journal, ''[[Sign Systems Studies]]'' (formerly published in Russian as ''Труды по знаковым системам''), published by [[Tartu University Press]]. It is the oldest semiotics journal in the world, established in 1964.

In its first period, the 1960s and 1970s, TMSS followed a [[structuralism|structuralist]] approach and was strongly influenced by [[Russian formalism]]. Since the 1980s, its approach can be characterized as [[post-structuralism|post-structuralist]], and is connected with the introduction of [[Yuri Lotman|Juri Lotman's]] concept of [[semiosphere]] and its relation to [[organicism]].

From 1990s, TMSS has been succeeded by the Tartu Semiotics School, which is based in the Department of Semiotics of the University of Tartu and led by [[Kalevi Kull]], [[Peeter Torop]], [[Mihhail Lotman]], and others.

The '''Tower of the Winds''' is the prominent octagonal [[tower]] on top of the old [[Radcliffe Observatory]] building in [[Oxford]], England.&lt;ref name="hibbert"&gt;{{cite book | title=[[The Encyclopaedia of Oxford]] | publisher=[[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] | chapter=Radcliffe Observatory | year=1988 | pages=353–354 | isbn=0-333-39917-X | editor-last=Hibbert |editor-first=Christopher |editor-link=Christopher Hibbert }}&lt;/ref&gt; The building now forms a centrepiece for [[Green Templeton College]], one of the colleges of [[Oxford University]].

The tower is based on the ancient and smaller [[Tower of the Winds]] in [[Athens]], [[Greece]], built c.100–50BC by [[Andronicus of Cyrrhus]] for the purpose of measuring time.&lt;ref name="hibbert" /&gt; It is of [[octagonal]] stone construction, with eight relief images of [[List of wind deities#Greek mythology|Greek mythological wind gods]] at the top of each side of the tower, carved by [[John Bacon (sculptor)|John Bacon]] the Elder in 1792–4. The tower was completed by [[James Wyatt]] in 1794. On the top are [[Atlas (mythology)|Atlas]] and [[Hercules]] supporting a [[globe]] in white, also by John Bacon. The reliefs of the [[signs of the zodiac]] above the windows on the first floor are made of [[Coade stone]] by [[John Charles Felix Rossi|J. C. F. Rossi]]. Inside the tower, there are three main rooms on top of each other.

The Tower of the Winds is situated in prominent view just to the north of the [[Radcliffe Observatory Quarter]] (ROQ), an area for Oxford University departments including the [[Blavatnik School of Government]], and south of [[Observatory Street]], named after its former use as an observatory. To the south is the [[Mathematical Institute, University of Oxford|Mathematical Institute]] building of the University, juxtaposing the new 21st-century architecture of that building with the old 17th-century style of the observatory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/dd1f748e-2fb8-11e4-83e4-00144feabdc0.html | title=Oxford’s new architecture | newspaper=[[Financial Times]] | date=3 October 2014 | first=Jan | last=Morris | authorlink=Jan Morris | accessdate=22 April 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To the west RE the [[Jericho Health Centre]] and BEYOND THAT [[Walton Street]], with a view of the tower in the distance from the southern end looking north along the street. To the east are the [[Woodstock Road, Oxford|Woodstock Road]] and the front entrance of Green Templeton College, with [[St Anne's College, Oxford|St Anne's College]] opposite.
