'''Afropolitan''' is a term constructed from the name ''[[Africa]]'' and the [[ancient Greek]] word ''πολίτης'' ('politis'), meaning 'citizen' (itself from ''polis'', 'city').&lt;ref&gt;"-polis, comb. form." ''OED Online'', Oxford University Press, January 2018, www.oed.com/view/Entry/146861. Accessed 23 January 2018. "cosmopolitan, adj. and n." ''OED Online'', Oxford University Press, January 2018, www.oed.com/view/Entry/42259. Accessed 23 January 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; It is an attempt at redefining African phenomena by placing emphasis on ordinary citizens' experiences in Africa. ''Afropolitanism'' is similar to the older [[Pan-Africanism|Panafricanism]] ideology. However, it defines being an "African" in explicitly continent-wide and multiracial terms, and rejects all pretensions to victimhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Paul Smethurst|editor2=Julia Kuehn|title=New Directions in Travel Writing Studies|date=2015|publisher=Springer|isbn=1137457252|page=343|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=GZJMCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT342#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=24 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As [[Achille Mbembe]] and Sarah Nuttall write, "In an attempt to overturn predominant readings of Africa, we need to identify sites within the continent...not usually dwelt upon in research and public discourse, that defamiliarize commonplace readings of Africa." &lt;ref name="Writing the World from an African Metropolis. Public Culture. vol 16,3 2004"&gt;[http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/pc/summary/v016/16.3mbembe01.html].&lt;/ref&gt; These sites include fields like fashion, visual art, music and spiritual concerns.

The term was popularized in 2005 by a widely disseminated essay, "Bye-Bye, Babar (Or: What is an Afropolitan?)" by the author [[Taiye Selasi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://edition.cnn.com/2012/02/17/world/africa/who-are-afropolitans/index.html | work=CNN | title=Young, urban and culturally savvy, meet the Afropolitans | date=17 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally published in March 2005 in the Africa Issue of ''the LIP Magazine'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thelip.robertsharp.co.uk/?p=76 |title= Bye-Bye Barbar|publisher=''the LIP Magazine''  |date=3 March 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; the essay defines an Afropolitan identity, sensibility and experience. The critiques of the Afropolitan, as portrayed by Selasi in Bye-Bye, Babar, condemn its elitism and class biased approach. Susanne Gehrmann states that Selasi’s Afropolitan “is addicted to urban hip life” and “international careers.”&lt;ref&gt;Gehrmann, Susanne. "[http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/13696815.2015.1112770?scroll=top&amp;needAccess=true Cosmopolitanism With African Roots. Afropolitanism's Ambivalent Mobilities]". Journal of African Cultural Studies 28.1 (2015): 61-72. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the essay is important in discussing where emigrantes of Africa fit into the spectrum of African. Knudsen and Rahbek suggest that Bye-Bye, Babar “is an integral part [in the] ongoing conversation about the relationship between identity and individuality” in the way that it “speaks to the individual” who may feel alone in the sense that they do not have “labels or identities” to understand their positioning in the world.&lt;ref&gt;Knudsen, Eva Rask, and Ulla Rahbek. In Search of the Afropolitan: Encounters, Conversations and Contemporary Diasporic African Literature. Lanham: Rowman &amp; Littlefield International, 2016. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 the essay was republished by the Michael Stevenson Gallery in [[Cape Town]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clarkesbooks.co.za/artbooks/browse/41 |title=Clarke's Books |publisher=Clarkesbooks.co.za |accessdate=12 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2007 by ''The Nation'' in [[Nairobi]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tuakli-Wosornu |first=Taiye |url=http://afrikanisation.blogspot.com/2007/09/africa-insight-new-africans-called.html |title=Africa Insight – the New Africans Called Afropolitans |publisher=''The Nation'' (Nairobi), reposted in Afrikanisation.blogspot.com |date=4 September 2007 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereupon it went viral.

'''''Alefba''''' ({{lang-fa|'''الف‌ با'''}}) is a Persian-language literary magazine with two periods of publication, one in [[Iran]] before the 1979 revolution and another thereafter in [[France]].  [[Gholamhoseyn Sa'edi]] was the editor of both versions.  In Iran the publisher was Amir Kabir Publishers, while in France the publisher was the Association of Iranian Writers in Exile.

==Tehran==
Several Iranian literary magazines emerged in 1960s and 1970s as a result of new authors and increased literary production in the country.&lt;ref&gt;Hillmann, Michael. "Persian Prose Fiction: An Iranian Mirror and Conscience," in ''Persian Literature'', edited by Ehsan Yarshater (Albany, N.Y.: Bibliotheca Persica, 1988), p. 303.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1973, Amir Kabir Publishers invested 25,000 [[Iranian toman|toman]] (about $3,500) in a new quarterly literary magazine, ''Alefba'', and selected Gholamhoseyn Sa'edi to be the editor.&lt;ref name=pll&gt;{{cite web|title=Persian Language &amp; Literature|url=http://www.iranchamber.com/literature/gsaedi/gholamhossein_saedi.php|work=Iran Chamber|accessdate=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Aside from the editorial labor, Sa'edi was responsible for its choosing its title, as well as penning the calligraphy decorating the cover.  ''Alefba'' quickly gained status as one of Iran's top literary journals  and famous Iranian intellectuals, such as [[Simin Daneshvar]], had their works published in it.&lt;ref&gt;Milani, Abbas. ''Eminent Persians: The Men and Women Who Made Modern Iran, 1941-1979'', Volume Two (Syracuse, N.Y.: Syracuse University Press, 2008), p. 881.&lt;/ref&gt;   Nevertheless Sa'edi frequently selected works of previously unpublished writers or writers he knew personally to be published, and esteemed the political independence of the magazine, which featured writers with different worldviews.&lt;ref&gt;Stodte, Claudia. ''Iranische Literatur zwischen gesellschaftlichem Engagement und existentieller Welterfahrung: Das Werk Ġolām-Ḥoseyn Sā'edis'', Europäische Hochschulschriften, Series XXVII, Vol. 72 (Frankfurt am Maine: Peter Lang, 2000), p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1974, Sa'edi was arrested by [[SAVAK]], the late shah's secret police. He edited first six issues of the magazine between 1973 and 1976.&lt;ref name=pll/&gt; The last issue of ''Alefba'' (last issue in Tehran) was published in 1977.

==Paris==
After the revolution, in 1982, Gholamhoseyn Sa'edi fled to France.  Within months of his exile, together with the Association of Iranian Writers in Exile, Sa'edi began to publish a new version of ''Alefba'' in Paris.  He continued to edit the magazine until his untimely death in 1985.  The final 1986 issue is a collection of Sa'edi's previously unpublished works.  Sa'edi wrote that the goal of ''Alefba'' was "to keep alive the Iranian art and culture which the Islamic Republic oppresses."&lt;ref&gt;Sa'edi, Gholamhoseyn. "Sharh-e Ahval," ''Alefba'' (Paris, 1986), no. 7, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to publishing works of numerous other Iranians in exile, ''Alefba'' was the sole literary venue in which Sa'edi published his own works in exile.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2238">'''Amoebaean singing''' is a type of [[singing]] competition originating in [[Ancient Greece]]. In it, a first party sings according to a topic and verse structure of their choosing. A second singer then responds with the same verse structure and on a related topic. This repeats until one side concedes or a third party can determine the winner.

==History==
The form is believed to have been used by Greek [[shepherd]]s to entertain themselves. Later, it would evolve into a judged competition, consisting of multiple rounds of singing between competitors. Competitors would be judged more favorably if they could continue a theme through multiple rounds.&lt;ref name=JB&gt;{{cite journal|title=Oral Tradition|author=Pearce, J. B.|pages=63–64|volume=8|issue=1|url=http://journal.oraltradition.org/issues/8i/pearce|date=March 1993|format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The poet [[Theocritus]] relied heavily on Amoebaean singing, with it becoming his and his successors' "hallmark", according to [[David M. Halperin]].&lt;ref name=JB /&gt;

==Usage==
Amoebaean singing can be seen in Theocritus' ''[[Idyll]] 5: The Goatherd and the Shepherd'', in an exchange between the [[goatherd]] Comatas and the [[shepherd]] Lacon.&lt;ref name=JB /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theoi.com/Text/TheocritusIdylls2.html#5|title=THEOCRITUS, IDYLLS 5-11|publisher=Theoi|accessdate=2009-10-26| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091106120935/http://www.theoi.com/Text/TheocritusIdylls2.html| archivedate= 6 November 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;center&gt;
'''Comatas'''&lt;br /&gt;
''The Muses bear me greater love than Daphnis ere did see;''&lt;br /&gt;
''And well they may, fort’other day they had two goats for me.''

''But Apollo loves me all as well, and an offering too have I,''&lt;br /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6902">[[File:Battistero di San Giovanni Ascoli Piceno.jpg|thumb|Ascoli Piceno Baptistery]]
The '''Ascoli Piceno Baptistery''' (Italian: ''Il battistero di San Giovanni di [[Ascoli Piceno]]''), also known as the [[baptistery]] of Saint John, is a religious building found on the eastern end of the [[piazza Arringo]] at the center of Ascoli Piceno and sitting next to and just north of the [[Ascoli Piceno Cathedral|cathedral dedicated to St. Emygdius]], the city's [[patron saint]].

The structure, simple and austere in its architectural form, perfectly represents the Romanesque style in Ascoli, and, being ranked among the best examples of Italian works of art, is included in the list of Italian [[national monument]]s &lt;small&gt;(r.d. n.7033 del 20/07/1890)&lt;/small&gt;.

== History ==
The beginning of the baptistery's construction is difficult to date accurately, but archeological finds from 1828 and other excavations between 1870-1880 suggest that the interior of the structure was a pagan temple on Ascoli's forum which may have been dedicated to [[Hercules]].

According to Giambattista Carducci, the temple was used as a baptistery already by the 6th century. He also notes that its octagonal form is like the baptistery of [[Florence Baptistery|Saint John in Florence]], of the [[Arian Baptistery|Arian baptistery]] of [[Ravenna]], and of the [[Lateran Baptistery|Lateran baptistery i]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;n [[Rome]] built by [[Constantine the Great|Constantine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Carducci|first1=Giambattista|title=Su le memorie e i monumenti di Ascoli nel Piceno|url=https://books.google.it/books?id=PBI5AAAAcAAJ|website=googlebooks|accessdate=19 November 2016|pages=88–89|date=1855}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The baptistery's first restoration came prior to the 9th century, with interventions following in the 10th and 11th centuries as shown in the triangular decorations and the framing of the principal entrance. Most recently, the interior of the baptistery was restored in 2006.

== Architecture ==
The baptistery is constructed of large, square blocks of travertine, some of which were taken from earlier structures. Visible at the base of the eastern side are the remains of a Roman wall. It is a freestanding structure with a massive, square base containing entrances on two sides. The ''tiburio'' (the upper part of the structure designed to shape and protect the cupola within) is octagonal in shape, decorated with four small windows, and crowned with a square lantern, also containing windows to allow light inside. Each side of the ''tiburio'' is decorated with a [[blind arcade]] containing three round arches, with exception of the east facing side which contains a pair of arcades with only two arches each. All of these arcades were added during the 12th century.

The original monument had three entrances symbolizing the [[Trinity|Holy Trinity]] as well as [[Churches Militant, Penitent, and Triumphant|the Three Churches]]: ''the church militant'', composed of all the baptized faithful to [[Jesus|Christ]] and the [[Pope]]; ''the church penitent'', which includes all the souls in [[purgatory]] that are being prepared for heaven; and ''the church triumphant'', comprising the [[saint]]s and [[angel]]s. Today the baptistery has two entrances. The main entrance, found on [[piazza Arringo]], is flanked by two recessed rectangular forms, and the architrave above is decorated with three recessed triangles, one large triangle in the center which is marked by a wide horizontal slit, and two small ones on the sides. The other entrance faces the cathedral door known as the ''La porta della Musa'', and contains stone work from various periods, including Romanesque capitals and an bas-relief architrave that contains a knotted cord (a type of decoration that was very diffuse around the year 1000).

The interior of the baptistery has an irregular, octagonal shape, typically Roman, with [[Niche (architecture)|niches]] that correspond to the angles of the square base. The octagonal walls measure about 5,5 [[Metre|meters]] each; the dimensions of the interiore are 9,14 x 9 meters. Inside at the center of the floor, directly below the [[oculus]] of the [[Dome|cupola]], is a slightly raised circular pool, dated to the 5th or 6th century but rediscovered only in 1839, that was used by Christians for baptism by immersion. This unique spot was used for the baptism of both men and women who were assisted, respectively, by [[deacon]]s and [[deaconess]]es. On the right side is a [[baptismal font]] from the 14th or 15th century, set on top of a twisted column. On the altar is a painting of the ''Baptism of Christ'', a 16th-century oil on canvas, attributed to Venceslao Corrigioli di Reggio.

== Symbolism ==
The historian Mario Sabatucci has attributed a symbolic reading to the form of Ascoli's baptistery according to Christian doctrine. According to his interpretation, the square base represents the earth and its four elements (air, earth, fire, and water), the four points of the compass, the four seasons, and the four periods of a human life-span.

[[File:AAC user using eye gaze.JPG|right|thumb| alt=refer to caption | An AAC user indicates a series of numbers on an eye gaze communication board in order to convey a word.]] 
'''Augmentative and alternative communication''' ('''AAC''') is an [[umbrella term]] that encompasses the communication methods used to supplement or replace speech or writing for those with impairments in the production or comprehension of spoken or written language. AAC is used by those with a wide range of [[speech and language impairment]]s, including congenital impairments such as [[cerebral palsy]], [[intellectual impairment]] and [[autism]], and acquired conditions such as [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]] and [[Parkinson's disease]]. AAC can be a permanent addition to a person's communication or a temporary aid.

Modern use of AAC began in the 1950s with systems for those who had lost the ability to speak following surgical procedures. During the 1960s and 1970s, spurred by an increasing commitment in the West towards the [[Inclusion (disability rights)|inclusion]] of disabled individuals in mainstream society and developing the skills required for independence, the use of manual [[sign language]] and then graphic symbol communication grew greatly. It was not until the 1980s that AAC began to emerge as a field in its own right. Rapid progress in technology, including microcomputers and [[speech synthesis]], have paved the way for communication devices with speech output and multiple options for access to communication for those with [[Physical disability|physical disabilities]].
 
AAC systems are diverse: unaided communication uses no equipment and includes signing and [[body language]], while aided approaches use external tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asha.org/public/speech/disorders/AAC/|title=Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC)|author=|date=|website=www.asha.org|accessdate=26 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aided communication methods can range from paper and pencil to communication books or boards to speech generating devices (SGDs) or devices producing written output. The symbols used in AAC include gestures, photographs, pictures, line drawings, letters and words, which can be used alone or in combination. Body parts, pointers, [[Mouse (computer)|adapted mice]], or [[eye tracking]] can be used to select target symbols directly, and [[switch access scanning]] is often used for indirect selection. Message generation is generally much slower than spoken communication, and as a result rate enhancement techniques may be used to reduce the number of selections required. These techniques include "prediction", in which the user is offered guesses of the word/phrase being composed, and "encoding", in which longer messages are retrieved using a prestored code.

The evaluation of a user's abilities and requirements for AAC will include the individual's motor, visual, cognitive, language and communication strengths and weaknesses. The evaluation requires the input of family members, particularly for early intervention. Respecting [[ethnicity]] and family beliefs are key to a [[Family centered care|family-centered]] and ethnically competent approach.  Studies show that AAC use does not impede the development of speech, and may result in a modest increase in speech production. Users who have grown up with AAC report satisfying relationships and life activities; however, they may have poor literacy and are unlikely to be in [[employment]].

The [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]] defines augmentative and alternative communication one of [[communication]]s as well as display of text, [[large-print]], [[Touch|tactile]] communication, [[plain language]], accessible [[multimedia]] and accessible [[information and communications technology]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]]: Article 2: Definitions&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope==
Augmentative and alternative communication is used by individuals to compensate for severe speech-language impairments in the expression or comprehension of spoken or written language.&lt;ref name=asha2005&gt;[[#refASHA2005|ASHA]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refFossettMirenda2009|Fossett &amp; Mirenda]], p. 330.&lt;/ref&gt; People making use of AAC include individuals with a variety of congenital conditions such as cerebral palsy, autism, intellectual disability, and acquired conditions such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, traumatic brain injury and aphasia.&lt;ref name="B&amp;M 4-5"/&gt; [[Prevalence]] data vary depending on the country and age/disabilities surveyed, but typically between 0.1 and 1.5% of the population are considered to have such severe speech-language impairments that they have difficulty making themselves understood, and thus could benefit from AAC.&lt;ref name="B&amp;M 4-5"&gt;[[#refBeukelmanMirenda|Beukelman &amp; Mirenda]], pp. 4–5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refLindsay|Lindsay et al.]]&lt;/ref&gt; An estimated 0.05% of children and young people require high technology AAC.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refGross|Gross]].&lt;/ref&gt; Well-known AAC users include physicist [[Stephen Hawking]], broadcaster [[Roger Ebert]] and poet [[Christopher Nolan (author)|Christopher Nolan]].&lt;ref name="B&amp;M 6-8"&gt;[[#refBeukelmanMirenda|Beukelman &amp; Mirenda]], pp. 6–8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refEbert|Ebert]].&lt;/ref&gt; Award-winning films such as ''[[My Left Foot (film)|My Left Foot]]'' and ''[[The Diving Bell and the Butterfly (film)|The Diving Bell and the Butterfly]]'', based on books by AAC users [[Christy Brown]] and [[Jean-Dominique Bauby]] respectively, have brought the lives of those who use AAC to a wider audience.&lt;ref name = "Glennen1997p7"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refLapointe|Lapointe]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refWalling|Walling]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The field was originally called "Augmentative Communication"; the term served to indicate that such communication systems were to supplement natural speech rather than to replace it. The addition of "alternative" followed later, when it became clear that for some individuals non-speech systems were their only means of communication.&lt;ref name="vanD" /&gt; AAC users typically utilize a variety of aided and unaided communication strategies depending on the communication partners and the context.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refFossettMirenda2009|Fossett &amp; Mirenda]], p. 331.&lt;/ref&gt;

There were three, relatively independent, research areas in the 1960s and 1970s that lead to the field of augmentative and alternative communication. First was the work on early electromechanical communication and writing systems. The second was the development of communication and language boards, and lastly there was the research on ordinary (without disability) child language development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |first=Gregg C. |last=Vanderheiden |year=2002 |title=A journey through early augmentative communication and computer access |journal=Journal of Rehabilitation Research and Development |volume=39 |issue=6 |pages=39–53 |url=http://www.rehab.research.va.gov/jour/02/39/6/sup/vanderheiden.html |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001002015/http://www.rehab.research.va.gov/jour/02/39/6/sup/vanderheiden.html |archivedate=2011-10-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Forms of AAC==

===Unaided AAC===
[[File:Interpbleu.gif|thumb| alt=refer to caption| Sign for "interpreter" in [[Quebec Sign Language]]]]
Unaided AAC systems are those that do not require an external tool, and include facial expression, vocalizations, [[gestures]], and [[sign language]]s and systems.&lt;ref name="Mirenda2003"&gt;[[#refMirenda2003|Mirenda]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refBeukelmanMirenda|Beukelman &amp; Mirenda]], p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Informal vocalizations and gestures such as body language and facial expressions are part of natural communication, and such signals may be used by those with profound disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refBeukelmanMirenda|Beukelman &amp; Mirenda]], pp. 38–42, 283–284.&lt;/ref&gt; More formalized gestural codes exist that lack a base in a naturally occurring language. For example, the Amer-Ind code is based on [[Plains Indian Sign Language]], and has been used with children with severe-profound disabilities, and adults with a variety of diagnoses including [[dementia]], [[aphasia]] and [[dysarthria]].&lt;ref name="B&amp;M 42"&gt;[[#refBeukelmanMirenda|Beukelman &amp; Mirenda]], pp. 42–44.&lt;/ref&gt; The benefits of gestures and pantomime are that they are always available to the user, usually understood by an educated listener, and are efficient means of communicating.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refLloydEtal|Lloyd et al.]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, sign languages have a linguistic base and permit the expression of an unlimited number of messages.&lt;ref name="B&amp;M 42"/&gt; Approaches to signing can be divided into two major categories, those that encode an existing language, and those that are languages in their own right.&lt;ref name=Millikin&gt;[[#refMillikin|Millikin]], pp. 103–107.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Signing Exact English]] may be considered the most widely used example of the former and [[American Sign Language]] as a common example of the latter.&lt;ref name=Millikin/&gt; Signing is used alone or in conjunction with speech to support communication with individuals with a variety of disorders.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refBeukelmanMirenda|Beukelman &amp; Mirenda]], pp. 43–51.&lt;/ref&gt;  The specific hand shapes and movements of sign and gesture require an individual to have adequate fine motor and [[motor planning]] skills.&lt;ref name="Mirenda2003" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refCumleySwanson|Cumley &amp; Swanson]].&lt;/ref&gt; Sign languages require more fine-motor coordination and are less [[Transparency (linguistic)|transparent]] in meaning than gestural codes such as Amer-Ind; the latter limits the number of people able to understand the person's communication without training.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refDaniloff1983|Daniloff]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DandV&gt;[[#refDaniloffVergara|Daniloff &amp; Vergara]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="B&amp;M 107" /&gt;

  }}
An AAC aid is any "device, either electronic or non-electronic, that is used to transmit or receive messages";&lt;ref name="B&amp;M 4-5" /&gt; such aids range from communication books to [[speech generating device]]s.&lt;ref name="Mirenda2003"/&gt; Since the skills, areas of difficulty and communication needs of AAC users vary greatly, an equally diverse range of communication aids and devices is required.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refGillamEtal|Gillam et al.]], pp. 356–357.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Low-tech====
Low-tech communication aids are defined as those that do not need batteries, electricity or electronics. These are often very simple communication boards or books, from which the user selects letters, words, phrases, pictures, and/or symbols to communicate a message.&lt;ref name=millarscott1998&gt;[[#refMillarScott1998|Millar &amp; Scott]], p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on physical abilities and limitations, users may indicate the appropriate message with a body part, light pointer, eye-gaze direction, or a head/mouth stick. Alternatively, they may indicate yes or no while a [[Partner-assisted scanning|listener scans through possible options]].&lt;ref name=scott1998&gt;[[#refScott1998|Scott]], pp. 13–15.&lt;/ref&gt;

====High-tech====
{{main|Speech_generating_device| l1=Speech generating device}}
High-tech AAC aids permit the storage and retrieval of electronic messages, with most allowing the user to communicate using speech output.&lt;ref name="GlennenDeCoste62"&gt;[[#refGlennenchap3|Glennen]], pp. 62–63.&lt;/ref&gt; Such devices are known as speech generating devices (SGD) or voice output communication aids (VOCA).&lt;ref name="schlosserblischakkoul"&gt;[[#refSchlosserBlischakKoul|Schlosser, Blischak &amp; Koul]]&lt;/ref&gt;  A device's speech output may be digitized and/or synthesized: digitized systems play recorded words or phrases and are generally more intelligible while [[speech synthesis|synthesized speech]] uses text-to-speech software that can be harder to understand but that permits the user to spell words and speak novel messages.&lt;ref name="schlosserblischakkoul"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refBeukelmanMirenda|Beukelman &amp; Mirenda]], pp. 105–106.&lt;/ref&gt;

High-tech systems may be dedicated devices developed solely for AAC, or non-dedicated devices such as computers that run additional software to allow them to function as AAC devices.&lt;ref name="GlennenDeCoste62"/&gt;&lt;ref name=jansclark1998&gt;[[#refJansClark|Jans &amp; Clark]], pp. 37–38.&lt;/ref&gt; They may be static or dynamic in form. Static communication devices have symbols in fixed positions on paper overlays, which are changed manually. To increase the vocabulary available, some static devices have multiple levels, with different words appearing on different levels.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refBeukelmanMirenda|Beukelman &amp; Mirenda]], p. 84.&lt;/ref&gt; On dynamic AAC devices, the user can change the symbols available using page links to navigate to appropriate pages of vocabulary and messages.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refHochstein2004|Hochstein]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refBeukelmanMirenda|Beukelman &amp; Mirenda]], p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

High-tech devices vary in the amount of information that they can store, as well as their size, weight and thus their portability.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refGlennenchap3|Glennen]], pp. 59–60.&lt;/ref&gt; Access methods depend on the abilities of the user, and may include the use of direct selection of symbols on the screen or keyboard with a body part, pointer, adapted [[Mouse (computing)|mice]] or [[joystick#Assistive technology|joysticks]], or indirect selection using switches and scanning.&lt;ref name="jansclark1998"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refGlennenchap3|Glennen]], pp. 69–74.&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:TextSpeak-AAC-Speech-Talking-Keyboard.png|thumb|Keyboard used to create speech over a telephone using a Text to Speech converter.]] Devices with voice output offer its user the advantage of more communicative power, including the ability to initiate conversation with communication partners who are at a distance.&lt;ref name=decoste&gt;[[#refGlennenchap10|Decoste]], p. 382.&lt;/ref&gt; However, they typically require programming,&lt;ref name=decoste/&gt; and tend to be unreliable.

High-tech systems can also include Keyboard based solutions that do not require programming with a mix of flexibility, simplicity, and associated reliability. In this case, a keyboard and audio speaker are configured to be create a ''"talking keyboard"'' where typed text is spoken directly in an audio speaker. This allows any phrase to be spoken as it is typed using unlimited vocabulary text-to-speech conversion. One simple benefit is that a talking keyboard, when used with a standard telephone or speakerphone can enable a voice impaired individual have 2 way conversation over a telephone.

In all cases of use, low tech systems often recommended as a backup in case of device failure.&lt;ref name="jansclark1998"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refSmith|Smith &amp; Connolly]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refShepherd|Shepherd et al.]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symbols==

Symbols are visuals used to represent objects, actions, and concepts through the use of items such as the physical object itself, colored or black and white photographs, line drawings, and written words.&lt;ref name="B&amp;M 4-5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Augmentative and alternative communication#refFossettMirenda2009|Fossett &amp; Mirenda]], p. 334.&lt;/ref&gt; For users with literacy skills, alphabet-based symbols including individual letters, whole words, or parts thereof may be used in combination with the other types of symbols.[[Tangible symbol systems|Tactile symbols]] which are textured objects, real objects or parts of real objects that are used as a communication symbols particularly for individuals with [[visual impairment]]s and/or significant intellectual impairments.&lt;ref name="B&amp;M 51-53"&gt;[[Augmentative and alternative communication#refBeukelmanMirenda|Beukelman &amp; Mirenda]], pp. 51–53.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cockerill169"&gt;[[Augmentative and alternative communication#refHazel2001|Hazel]], p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt; Both low- and high-tech devices can incorporate the use of symbols. With low-tech devices, a communication partner is involved and must interpret the symbols chosen. [[Picture exchange communication system|Picture Communication Exchange System]] (PECS) is a commonly used low-tech communication system that teach individuals how to request, comment, and answer questions through the use of line drawings known as picture communication symbols (PCS). [https://www.prentrom.com/prc_advantage/language-systems LAMP Words for Life], a high-tech communication system, is an app that incorporates various symbols and motor planning. Symbols are placed in fixed position on the screen which allow users to develop motor patterns associated with certain requests or statements. The choice of symbols and aspects of their presentation, such as size and background, depend on an individual's preferences as well as their linguistic, visual, and cognitive skills.&lt;ref name="B&amp;M 51-53" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Cockerill169" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Augmentative and alternative communication#refWilliams|Williams]], pp. 199–200.&lt;/ref&gt; This can be determined using an assessment for symbolic understanding.

==Access and selection methods==
{{See also|Switch Access Scanning}}
[[File:eyegaze.jpg|left|thumb|alt= a user in a wheelchair faces a communication partner who holds a transparent piece of plastic between them, the plastic has the letters of the alphabet printed around the edges| A subject uses eye-gaze to indicate choices on a transparent letter-based communication board. This is a form of "Direct Selection".]]
Technological advances have dramatically increased the types of selection methods available for individuals with communication impairments.&lt;ref name="Higginbotham" /&gt; 
In "Direct Selection", the selection is made by pointing to the desired symbol using a finger or an alternative pointer, such as eye gaze, a head stick, head- or eye-controlled mouse. To accommodate motor control difficulties some users use alternative activation strategies; for example in "timed activation", the user maintains selection of the symbol for a predetermined period of time until it is recognized by the system. With the "release activation", the selection of the item is only made when the person releases contact from the display.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refBeukelmanMirenda|Beukelman &amp; Mirenda]], pp. 96–97.&lt;/ref&gt;

Direct activation of an AAC system is generally the first choice of access method as it is faster and cognitively easier.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refBeukelmanMirenda|Beukelman &amp; Mirenda]], pp. 102–103.&lt;/ref&gt;  Those unable to do so may use indirect selection or "scanning".  In this method, items displayed for selection are scanned; the scanning may be visual using indicators such as lights, highlighting, and/or contrasting borders, or auditory using spoken prompts from a communication partner or device. When the desired message is reached, the AAC user indicates the choice using an alternative selection technique such as [[switch access|a switch]], vocalization or gesture.&lt;ref name="BM Scanning"&gt;[[#refBeukelmanMirenda|Beukelman &amp; Mirenda]], pp. 97–101.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Glennen1997p73"&gt;[[#refGlennenchap3|Glennen]], p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; Several different patterns for [[switch access scanning]] are available: in "circular scanning", the items are displayed in a circle and then scanned one at a time. It is often introduced first to children or beginning AAC users because it is the easiest to understand. In "linear scanning", items are organized in rows and are scanned one at a time until a choice is made. Although more demanding than circular scanning, it is still easy to learn. Finally, in "group-item scanning", items are grouped and the groups scanned consecutively. Once a particular group is selected, items within the group are scanned. One of the most common group-item strategies is row-column scanning in which each row forms a group. The rows of items are scanned and when a row is selected, the items in the row are scanned one at a time until a message is selected.&lt;ref name="BM Scanning"/&gt;

There are three main selection control techniques in scanning. In "automatic scanning", the scan proceeds at a pre-determined speed and pattern until the user selects an item. In "inverse scanning", the switch is held down to advance the scan, and released to choose the desired iem. In "step scanning", the AAC user activates one switch to move the indicator through the items, and another switch to select the item.&lt;ref name="BM Scanning"/&gt;

==Vocabulary organization==
{{See also|Speech_generating_device#Selection_set_and_vocabulary|label 1=Speech Generating Devices: Vocabulary}}
Vocabulary organization refers to the way pictures, words, phrases, and sentences are displayed on the communication system.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refBlackstone1993|Blackstone (1993)]].&lt;/ref&gt; In general, the goal is to facilitate efficient and effective communication, especially when the individual's AAC system contains a large number of symbols.&lt;ref name="B&amp;M 107"&gt;[[#refBeukelmanMirenda|Beukelman &amp; Mirenda]], pp. 107–110.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:gotalk.jpg|left|thumb| alt=an electronic device with speakers and a slot to insert cards that have new sets of symbols on them. The current card has 25 symbols that relate to book reading | A static digitized speech communication device with a book reading (activity-based) overlay]]
Communication books and devices are often presented in a grid format;&lt;ref name="B&amp;M 336"&gt;[[#refBeukelmanMirenda|Beukelman &amp; Mirenda]], p. 336.&lt;/ref&gt; the vocabulary items displayed within them may be organized by spoken word order, frequency of usage or category. In the Fitzgerald Key organization, symbols from different semantic and syntactic classes are organized grammatically in groups from left to right to facilitate sentence construction.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refBrandenbergVanderheiden|Brandenberg &amp; Vanderheiden]], pp. 84–135.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since research has shown that children and adults use a small number of words frequently,&lt;ref&gt;[[#refBeukelman1989|Beukelman (1989)]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMarvinEtal1994|Marvin et al. (1994)]].&lt;/ref&gt; in a core-fringe vocabulary organization, the words and messages that are communicated most frequently appear on a "main page". The fringe vocabulary—words and messages used more rarely and that are specific to an individual—appear on other pages.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refBeukelmanMirenda|Beukelman &amp; Mirenda]], pp. 30–32.&lt;/ref&gt; Symbols may also be organized by category, grouping people, places, feelings, foods, drinks, and action words together.&lt;ref name="B&amp;M 336" /&gt; Another form of grid organization groups vocabulary according to specific activities.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refBeukelmanMirenda|Beukelman &amp; Mirenda]], pp. 336–338.&lt;/ref&gt; Each display contains symbols for the people, places, objects, feelings, actions, and other relevant vocabulary items for a specific activity or routine.&lt;ref name="DragerLightSpeltz"&gt;[[#refDragerLightSpeltz|Drager, Light &amp; Speltz]].&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:V Max speech generating device with headmouse extreme access.jpg|right|thumb| alt=A screen showing a stylised version of a bedroom, mounted on top of the screen is the sensor for a head mouse| Speech generating device using a visual scene display, accessed using a head mouse]] 
Visual scene displays are a different method of organizing and presenting symbols. These are depictions of events, people, objects, and related actions in a picture, photograph, or virtual environment representing a situation, place, or specific experience.&lt;ref name="BM338"&gt;[[#refBeukelmanMirenda|Beukelman &amp; Mirenda]], pp. 338–339.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refBlackstone2004|Blackstone (2004)]].&lt;/ref&gt; They are similar to activity displays in that they contain vocabulary that is associated with specific activities or routines. For example, a photo of a child's room may be included in the child's AAC system. Objects and events within the photograph are then used as symbols for communication.&lt;ref name="DragerLightSpeltz"/&gt; Research suggests that visual scene displays are easier than grid displays for young children or those with cognitive impairments to learn and use.&lt;ref name= "Higginbotham"&gt;[[#refHigginbothamEtal|Higginbotham et al.]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refDragerEtal2004|Drager et al. (2004)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rate enhancement strategies==
{{See also|Speech_generating_device#Rate_enhancement_strategies|label 1=Speech Generating Devices: Rate enhancement strategies}}
Augmentative and alternative communication is typically much slower than speech,&lt;ref name="rate enhancement"&gt;[[#refUWAAC|University of Washington (2009)]]&lt;/ref&gt; with users generally producing 8–10 words per minute.&lt;ref name ="Higginbotham" /&gt; Rate enhancement strategies can increase the user's rate of output to around 12–15 words per minute,&lt;ref name="Higginbotham" /&gt; and as a result enhance the [[communication efficiency|efficiency of communication]].  There are two main options for increasing the rate of communication: encoding and prediction.&lt;ref name="rate enhancement"/&gt;

Encoding is a technique permitting an AAC user to produce an entire word, sentence or phrase using only one or two activations of their AAC system.&lt;ref name="rate enhancement" /&gt;  In numeric, alpha-numeric, and letter encoding (also known as abbreviation-expansion), words and sentences are coded as sequences of letters and numbers. For example, typing "HH" may retrieve "Hello, how are you?".&lt;ref name="venkatagiri" /&gt; In iconic encoding strategies, such as [[Semantic compaction]], icons (picture symbols) are combined in a sequence to produce words or phrases.&lt;ref name=venkatagiri&gt;[[#refVenkatagiri|Venkatagiri]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Prediction is a rate enhancement strategy in which the device attempts to predict the letter, word or phrase being written by the user. The user can then select the correct prediction without needing to write the full word. [[Word prediction]] software may determine the words predicted based on their frequency in language, association with other words, past choices of the user, or grammatical suitability.&lt;ref name="rate enhancement" /&gt;&lt;ref name="venkatagiri" /&gt;

I had started – the thing that was to give my mind its chance of expressing itself. True, I couldn't speak with my lips, but now I would speak through something more lasting than spoken words – written words. That one letter, scrawled on the floor with a broken bit of yellow chalk gripped between my toes, was my road to a new world, my key to mental freedom.

An evaluation of an individual's abilities, limitations and communication needs is necessary to select appropriate AAC techniques. The purpose of the assessment is to identify potential AAC approaches that can bridge discrepancies between a potential user's current communication and their present and future communication needs.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refFossettMirenda2009|Fossett &amp; Mirenda]], pp. 331–332.&lt;/ref&gt; AAC evaluations are often conducted by specialized teams which may include a [[speech pathology|speech-language pathologist]], [[occupational therapist]], [[rehabilitation engineer]], [[physiotherapist]], [[social worker]] and a [[physician]].&lt;ref name="BM Team"&gt;[[#refBeukelmanMirenda|Beukelman &amp; Mirenda]], pp. 118–125.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Mineo"&gt;[[#refMineo|Mineo]].&lt;/ref&gt; Users, family members and teachers are also key members of the decision making team.&lt;ref name="Mineo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="voice"&gt;[[#refParetteEtal2000|Parette et al. (2000)]].&lt;/ref&gt; Sensitivity to and respect of [[cultural diversity]] contributes to ongoing family involvement and to the selection of the most appropriate AAC system.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refAngelo|Angelo]], pp. 523–524.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BM Cultural"&gt;[[#refBeukelmanMirenda|Beukelman &amp; Mirenda]], pp. 152–154.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refParetteAngelo|Parette &amp; Angelo]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refCrais1991|Crais]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= "special"&gt;[[#refKalyanpurHarry|Kalyanpur &amp; Harry]], pp. 246–249.&lt;/ref&gt;  For members of some cultural groups the presence of an AAC device increases the visibility of disability and is thus viewed as stigmatizing.&lt;ref name="BM Cultural"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refParetteBrotherson|Parette &amp; Brotherson]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refDinnebeil|Dinnebeil]].&lt;/ref&gt;

A user's motor abilities, communication skills and needs, [[cognition]] and vision are assessed in order to determine the most appropriate match to a communication system.&lt;ref name="Mineo"/&gt; Depending on the individual's physical status, recommendations of an alternative access method, a change in seating/positioning, a mounting system and/or communication aid adaptations may be needed. For example, someone with [[spasticity|spastic]] arm movements may require a [[Assistive technology#Accessible computer input|key guard]] on top of the keyboard or [[touchscreen]] to reduce the selection of non-target items. The person's needs and abilities determine the symbols chosen and their organization, with the goal being that the communication system can be used as efficiently as possible in different contexts, with different communication partners, and for different social purposes.&lt;ref name="B&amp;M 6-8"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BM Team"/&gt; Researcher [[Janice Light]] identified four social purposes of communicative interaction in AAC: the expression of needs and wants to a listener, the transfer of information as in more general conversation, the development of social closeness through such things as jokes and cheering, and finally social etiquette practices such as "please" and "thank you". These four purposes vary in terms of the relative importance of the content, rate, duration and the focus of the interaction. It is important that the AAC systems selected also reflect the priorities of the individual and their family.&lt;ref name="B&amp;M 8-10"&gt;[[#refBeukelmanMirenda|Beukelman &amp; Mirenda]], pp. 8–10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refLight1988|Light, 1988]].&lt;/ref&gt; In Western cultures, professionals may see a communication device as helping to promote an individual's self-determination, i.e., the ability to make one's own decisions and choices.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refTurnbull|Turnbull]].&lt;/ref&gt; However, cultural and religious factors may affect the degree to which individual autonomy is a valued construct,&lt;ref&gt;[[#refWehmeyerPalmer|Wehmeyer &amp; Palmer]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="B&amp;M 151-152"&gt;[[#refBeukelmanMirenda|Beukelman &amp; Mirenda]], pp. 151–52.&lt;/ref&gt; and influence family attitudes towards AAC.&lt;ref name="B&amp;M 151-152"/&gt;

Training can help the user make use of their AAC system to communicate effectively with others, to control their environment through communication, and to make choices, decisions and mistakes.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refBeukelmanMirenda|Beukelman &amp; Mirenda]], pp. 227–231.&lt;/ref&gt; Skilled users of AAC show [[communicative competence]] in four interrelated areas: linguistic, operational, social and strategic.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refLightMcNaughton2014|Light &amp; McNaughton, 2014]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Linguistic competence]] refers to language skills in the person's native language as well as the linguistic code of the symbol system selected. Operational competence involves the skills in the use and maintenance of the tool of communication, while [[social competence]] and strategic competence reflect knowledge and judgment in communicative interactions, including the compensations required for a slow speaking rate, communication breakdowns and those unfamiliar with AAC. An AAC user may require specific device programming and/or training to achieve competency in these areas.&lt;ref name="B&amp;M 10-14"&gt;[[#refBeukelmanMirenda|Beukelman &amp; Mirenda]], pp. 10–14.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refLight1989|Light, 1989]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Communication partners may also require training to notice and consistently interpret the communication signals of a severely disabled individual, particularly because there is a danger that [[learned helplessness]] can be the result of repeated failure to communicate successfully.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refBeukelmanMirenda|Beukelman &amp; Mirenda]], p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt; Parties may need assistance to avoid the directive communication style that can lead a child user of AAC not to develop a full range of communication skills such as initiating or taking the lead in conversation, using complex syntax, asking questions, making commands or adding new information.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refPenningtonMcConachie|Pennington &amp; McConachie]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refClarkeWilkinson|Clarke &amp; Wilkinson]].&lt;/ref&gt;
Young AAC users benefit from rich language and literacy experiences to foster [[vocabulary]] development, [[discourse]] skills, and [[phonological awareness]], all of which supports successful literacy learning.&lt;ref name = "sturm"/&gt; Communication partners are encouraged to provide augmented input with the child, such as signing or pointing to symbols and codes as they communicate, including using the individual's communication system themselves.&lt;ref name="B&amp;M 10-14"/&gt; They also benefit from focussed and explicit reading instruction.&lt;ref name="Fallon 2004"&gt;[[#refFallonEtal2004|Fallon et al. (2004)]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Blischak"&gt;[[#refBlischak|Blischak]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outcomes==

===Speech===
Several reviews have found that the use of AAC does not impede the development of speech in individuals with autism or developmental disabilities, and in fact, may result in modest gains being observed.&lt;ref name="Schlosser-Wendt"&gt;[[#refSchlosserWendt|Schlosser &amp; Wendt]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Millar2006"&gt;[[#refMillar2006|Millar et al.]].&lt;/ref&gt; A 2006 research review of 23 AAC intervention studies found gains in speech production in 89% of the cases studied, with the remainder showing no change.&lt;ref name="Millar2006"/&gt; A descriptive review looking specifically at [[Picture Exchange Communication System]] (PECS) intervention studies found that several studies reported an increase in speech, often during later phases, while one noted little or no effect.&lt;ref name=Preston&gt;[[#refPreston2009|Preston (2009)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers hypothesize that using an AAC device relieves the pressure of having to speak, allowing the individual to focus on communication, and that the reduction in [[psychological stress]] makes speech production easier.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refSchlosserLloyd|Schlosser &amp; Lloyd]].&lt;/ref&gt; Others speculate that in the case of speech generating devices, the model of spoken output leads to an increase in speech production.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refCressMarvin|Cress &amp; Marvin]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Language and literacy===

Language and literacy have far reaching effects as they facilitate self-expression and [[social interaction]] in a variety of settings.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refKoppenhaverEtal1991b|Koppenhaver et al. (1991b)]].&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, literacy fosters independence by providing access to educational and vocational opportunities.&lt;ref name="Light, J. 1993"/&gt; Children whose disabilities require AAC often experience developmental delays in language skills such as vocabulary knowledge, length of sentences, [[syntax]], and impaired [[pragmatics|pragmatic]] skills.&lt;ref name = "sturm"/&gt; These delays may be due in part to the fact that expressive language is limited by more than the children's own language knowledge. Unlike speaking children, children who use AAC do not always have access to their AAC system, and don't select the content available on the device. These external characteristics may impact language learning opportunities.&lt;ref name="sutton"&gt;[[#sutton|Sutton, Soto &amp; Blockberger 2002]]&lt;/ref&gt; Most children in this category do not achieve literacy skills beyond that of a typically developing 7–8 year old. &lt;!-- reference (with US authors) says 'second grade level'. --&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refSturmEtal2006|Sturm et al. (2006)]].&lt;/ref&gt; Cognitive, language and learning delays contribute to difficulty with literacy development,&lt;ref name = "sturm"&gt;[[#refSturmClendon|Sturm &amp; Clendon]].&lt;/ref&gt; but [[environmental factor]]s also play a role. The most literate AAC users often report having access to abundant reading and writing material at home as well as in school during childhood.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refKoppenhaverEtal1991a|Koppenhaver et al. (1991a)]].&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have shown that many children who use AAC have literacy experiences that are reduced quality, quantity, and opportunity at home and at school as compared to children without disabilities.&lt;ref name="Light, J. 1993"&gt;[[#refLightMcNaughton|Light &amp; McNaughton]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "ericksonkoppen"&gt;[[#refEricksonKoppenhaver|Erickson &amp; Koppenhaver]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refKoppenhaverYoder|Kopperhaver &amp; Yoder]].&lt;/ref&gt; Research suggests that with explicit reading instruction, AAC users can develop good literacy skills.&lt;ref name="Fallon 2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Blischak"/&gt;

===Employment===
According to a 1997 [[United States Census Bureau|U.S. Census Bureau]] report less than 10% of severely disabled individuals were employed. Despite the various barriers to employment, some AAC users achieve success in educational endeavours and employment, though often in lower paying jobs.&lt;ref name="Hamm, B. 2006"&gt;[[#refHammMirenda|Hamm &amp; Mirenda]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refMankEtal|Mank et al.]]&lt;/ref&gt; Factors that have been found to be related to employment are a strong [[work ethic]] and access to AAC technology, the support of family and friends, education, and work skills.&lt;ref name="McNaughton, D. Light 2002"&gt;[[#refMcNaughtonEtal|McNaughton et al.]]&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals with ALS who use AAC may continue working; factors supporting continued employment include access to AAC, support from employers, governmental programs and others.&lt;ref name="McNaughton, D. Light 2001"&gt;[[#refMcNaughtonLight|McNaughton &amp; Light]].&lt;/ref&gt; Employers of AAC users report that skills in [[time management]], [[problem solving]], communication, technology and a good education are important to employers.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refBryanEtal|Bryen et al.]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Quality of life===
Several studies of young adults who had used AAC since childhood report a generally good [[quality of life]], though few lived independently, or were in paid employment.&lt;ref name="Hamm, B. 2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lundlight1"/&gt; The young adults used multiple modes of communication including aided and unaided AAC approaches.&lt;ref name="Hamm, B. 2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lundlight2"&gt;[[#reflundlight2|Lund &amp; Light (2007a)]].&lt;/ref&gt; More positive quality of life outcomes often correlated with better quality of communication and interaction, as well as personal characteristics, family and community support, and excellent AAC services.&lt;ref name="Hamm, B. 2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lundlight1"&gt;[[#reflundlight1|Lund &amp; Light (2006)]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lundlight3"&gt;[[#reflundlight3|Lund &amp; Light (2007b)]].&lt;/ref&gt; Poorer outcomes were related to lack of access to appropriate AAC supports and resources, problems with technology and negative attitudes.&lt;ref name="Hamm, B. 2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lundlight3"/&gt;

==Specific groups of AAC users==

===Cerebral palsy===
[[Cerebral palsy]] is a term referring to a non-progressive developmental [[Movement disorder|neuromotor disorder]] with an [[upper motor neuron lesion]] origin.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refBeukelmanMirenda|Beukelman &amp; Mirenda]], p. 235.&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the location of the brain lesion, individuals with cerebral palsy can have a wide variety of gross and fine motor challenges, including different forms and areas of the body affected. Fine motor planning, control and coordination are often affected.&lt;ref name="trevrob"&gt;[[#refTreviranusRoberts|Treviranus &amp; Roberts]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dysarthria]], a speech disorder resulting from neurological damage to the motor-speech system, occurs in an estimated 31% to 88% of those with cerebral palsy. Such individuals may require AAC support for communication. Approximately one half to one third have some degree of intellectual impairment, and visual and hearing problems are also common.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refBeukelmanMirenda|Beukelman &amp; Mirenda]], pp. 236–237.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refUtley|Utley]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Gross and fine motor challenges are often of particular concern in accessing an AAC device.&lt;ref name="trevrob"/&gt; Appropriate seating and positioning are important to facilitate optimum stability and movement.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refBeukelmanMirenda|Beukelman &amp; Mirenda]], pp. 237–238.&lt;/ref&gt; Extensive motor training and practice may be required to develop efficient AAC access and use.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refBeukelmanMirenda|Beukelman &amp; Mirenda]], pp. 238–239.&lt;/ref&gt;  The trend towards custom-placed sensors and personalized signal processing may assist in facilitating communication for those who are incapable of using other AAC technologies.&lt;ref name=Myrdenetal2014&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Myrden|first1=Andrew|last2=Schudlo|first2=Larissa|last3=Weyand|first3=Sabine|last4=Zeyl|first4=Timothy|last5=Chau|first5=Tom|title=Trends in Communicative Access Solutions for Children With Cerebral Palsy|journal=[[Journal of Child Neurology]]|date=August 2014|volume=29|issue=8|pages=1108–1118|doi=10.1177/0883073814534320|pmid=24820337}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intellectual impairment===
[[File:cheaptalk and switch.jpg|right|thumb| alt= a small electronic device with several buttons, there is a cable going from the device to an activation button. |Phrases can be recorded onto simple switch-operated AAC devices by a user or carer so that the recording is played when the switch is pressed.]] Individuals with [[intellectual impairment]]s face challenges in developing communication skills, including problems with [[Applied behavior analysis|generalization]] (the transfer of learned skills into daily activities). They may lack communication opportunities in their daily lives, and responsive communicators who understand their communication methods.&lt;ref name="BM II"/&gt; AAC intervention for this population emphasizes partner training as well as opportunities for integrated, natural communication.&lt;ref name="BM II"/&gt; Studies have shown that appropriate use of AAC techniques with children and adults with intellectual impairments can enhance communication skills,&lt;ref name="McIlvane"&gt;[[#refWilkinsonMcIlvane|Wilkinson &amp; McIlvane]], pp. 273–322.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cheslock"&gt;[[#refCheslockEtal|Cheslock et al.]]&lt;/ref&gt; increase participation in activities,&lt;ref name="Wilkinson" /&gt; choice-making,&lt;ref name="Cosbey"&gt;[[#refCosbeyJohnston|Cosbey &amp; Johnston]].&lt;/ref&gt; and even influence the perceptions and stereotypes of communication partners.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson" /&gt;

While most individuals with intellectual disabilities do not have concomitant [[challenging behaviour|behavioural issues]], problems in this area are typically more prevalent in this population than others.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refBatshaw|Batshaw]], pp. 287–305.&lt;/ref&gt; AAC approaches may be used as part of teaching functional communication skills to non-speaking individuals as an alternative to "acting out" for the purpose of exerting independence, taking control, or informing preferences.&lt;ref name="BM II"&gt;[[#refBeukelmanMirenda|Beukelman &amp; Mirenda]], pp. 241–243.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Autism===
[[Autism]] is a disorder of neural development characterized by impaired social interaction and communication, and by restricted and repetitive behaviour. Typically there is particular difficulty acquiring expressive communication skills.&lt;ref name="Schlosser-Wendt" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refChiangLin|Chiang &amp; Lin]].&lt;/ref&gt; People with autism have been found to have strong [[visual processing]] skills, making them good candidates for an AAC approach.&lt;ref name="Cafiero"&gt;[[#refCafiero|Cafiero]], p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;
AAC intervention in this population is directed towards the linguistic and social abilities of the child,&lt;ref&gt;[[#refBeukelmanMirenda|Beukelman &amp; Mirenda]], pp. 246–248.&lt;/ref&gt; including providing the person with a concrete means of communication, as well as facilitating the development of interactional skills.&lt;ref name="Schlosser-Wendt" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mirenda2001"&gt;[[#refMirenda2001|Mirenda (2001)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:AAC Chart.png|thumb|right |Explains percentage of people who require AAC Devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/data.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-04-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140418153648/http://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/autism/data.html |archivedate=2014-04-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cerebralpalsy.org/about-cerebral-palsy/prevalence-and-incidence/|title=Prevalence of Cerebral Palsy|author=|date=|website=cerebralpalsy.org|accessdate=26 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170712162847/http://www.cerebralpalsy.org/about-cerebral-palsy/prevalence-and-incidence|archivedate=12 July 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parkinson.org/understanding-parkinsons|title=Understanding Parkinson's|author=|date=10 June 2015|website=parkinson.org|accessdate=26 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170702114858/http://www.parkinson.org/understanding-parkinsons|archivedate=2 July 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

AAC systems for this population generally begin with communication boards and/or object or picture exchanges such as the [[Picture Exchange Communication System]] (PECS).&lt;ref name="Mirenda2001" /&gt; A 2009 descriptive review provided preliminary evidence that PECS is easily learned by most individuals with autism, provides communication to those with little or no functional speech, and has some limited positive impact on [[Social relation|social interaction]] and [[challenging behaviour]]s.&lt;ref name="Preston"/&gt; A study that compared the use of a speech generating device to a picture exchange system found that both were reasonable options for children with autism, as the ease and speed of acquisition of each system was similar.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refSonEtal|Son et al.]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Developmental verbal dyspraxia===
[[Developmental verbal dyspraxia]], also known as Childhood apraxia of speech, is a developmental [[motor speech disorders|motor speech disorder]] involving impairments in the motor control of speech production.&lt;ref name="Bornman"&gt;[[#refBornmanEtal|Bornman et al.]]&lt;/ref&gt; The speech of a child with developmental verbal dyspraxia may be unintelligible to the point that daily communication needs cannot be met. A child with developmental verbal dyspraxia often experiences great amounts of frustration, so AAC can be a strategy to support communication alongside more traditional speech therapy to improve speech production.&lt;ref name="BM DD"&gt;[[#refBeukelmanMirenda|Beukelman &amp; Mirenda]], pp. 250–254.&lt;/ref&gt;

A wide variety of AAC systems have been used with children with developmental verbal dyspraxia.&lt;ref name="handbook1"&gt;[[#refWeitzEtal|Weitz et al.]]&lt;/ref&gt; Manual signs or gestures are frequent introduced to these children, and can include the use of [[fingerspelling]] alongside speech. Manual signs have been shown to decrease errors in articulation.&lt;ref name="BM DD"/&gt; Aided AAC systems typically include communication boards and speech generating devices.&lt;ref name="handbook1" /&gt; A multimodal approach is often used, with several AAC approaches introduced so that the child can take advantage of the most effective method for a particular situation.&lt;ref name="BM DD"/&gt;

===Traumatic brain injury===
[[Traumatic brain injury]] can result in severe motor speech disorders; [[dysarthria]] is the most common such disorder, accounting for roughly a third of all cases.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refTheodorosEtal|Theodoros et al.]]&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the stage of recovery, AAC intervention may involve identifying consistent communication signals, the facilitation of reliable yes/no responses to questions, and the ability to express basic needs and answer questions. Individuals who do not recover natural speech to a degree sufficient to meet their communication needs typically suffer from severe impairments related to cognition.&lt;ref name="Fager s 2006b"&gt;[[#refFagerEtal2006b|Fager et al. (2006b)]].&lt;/ref&gt; Difficulties with memory and learning new skills may influence AAC choices; well-established competencies such as spelling may be more effective than AAC systems that require navigation through multiple pages to access information.&lt;ref name="Fager s 2006b" /&gt;

===Aphasia===
[[Aphasia]] is the result of damage to the brain's language centres affecting production, comprehension, or both, and can cause severe, chronic language impairment.&lt;ref name="Beukelmanfagar"&gt;[[#refBeukelmanEtal2007|Beukelman et al. (2007)]].&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals with aphasia often communicate using a combination of speech, gestures, and aided communication; the proportion of each may change as the person recovers, and depends on the context and the individual's skills.&lt;ref name="foxfriedoken"&gt;[[#refFoxFriedOken|Fox &amp; Fried-Oken]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on their language and cognitive skills, those with aphasia may use AAC interventions such as communication and memory books, drawing, photography, written words, speech generating devices and keyboards.&lt;ref name="Beukelmanfagar"/&gt; Visual scene displays have been used on communication devices with adults who have chronic, severe aphasia; these feature photos of people, places or events that are meaningful to the individual and facilitative of communicative interaction.&lt;ref name="Beukelmanfagar"/&gt; Approaches such as "Supported Conversation for Adults with Aphasia" train the communication partners to use resources such as writing key words, providing written choices, drawing, and using items such as photographs and maps to help the individual with aphasia produce and comprehend conversation.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refGarrettLasker|Garrett &amp; Lasker]], pp. 475–481.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refKaganEtal|Kagan et al.]]&lt;/ref&gt; Communication boards can be very helpful for patients with aphasia, especially with patients who are very severe. They can be produced at a very low tech level, and can be utilized by patients to point to pictures/words they are trying to say. Communication boards are extremely functional and help patients with aphasia communicate their needs.

===Locked-in syndrome===
[[Stroke]]s that occur in the [[brainstem]] may cause profound deficits, including [[locked-in syndrome]],&lt;ref name=teasell&gt;[[#refTeasellEtal|Teasel et al.]]&lt;/ref&gt; in which cognitive, emotional and linguistic abilities remain intact but all or almost all voluntary motor abilities are lost.&lt;ref name=soderholm&gt;[[#refSoderholmEtal|Soderholm et al.]]&lt;/ref&gt; Most people affected by this type of stroke rely on AAC strategies to communicate, since few recover intelligible speech or functional voice.&lt;ref name=fager&gt;[[#refFagerEtal2006a|Fager et al. (2006a)]].&lt;/ref&gt; The AAC strategies used vary with the individual's preferences and motor capabilities which may change over time. As eye movements are most likely to be preserved, eye blinks are frequently used for communication.&lt;ref name="soderholm" /&gt; Low-tech alphabet boards are often introduced immediately to provide the individual with basic communication. [[Partner-assisted scanning]] may be used, in which the AAC user signals when the desired letter is named by a communication partner. When vertical and horizontal eye movements are functional, a transparent alphabet board may be used in which the AAC user looks at the desired letter and this is acknowledged by the communication partner.&lt;ref name="soderholm" /&gt; Individuals with locked-in syndrome have difficulty using high-tech devices due to issues with [[motor control]], vision, memory, [[alertness]] and linguistic ability.&lt;ref name="soderholm" /&gt; In particular, a voluntary, reliable and easily controlled muscle movement is necessary to access such a device, such as head, jaw, hand or finger movements.&lt;ref name="soderholm" /&gt; In some individuals, intensive practice, even long after the initial stroke, has been shown to increase the accuracy and consistency of head movements,&lt;ref name="fager" /&gt; which can be used to access a communication device.&lt;ref name="soderholm" /&gt;

===Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis===
[[File:Stephen hawking 2008 nasa.jpg|alt=as caption| thumb|left|[[Stephen Hawking]], a noted physicist with ALS who used AAC]] [[Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]] (ALS) or [[Motor Neurone Disease]] (MND) is a progressive condition which leads to weakness and eventual [[paralysis]]. Approximately 75% of people with ALS are unable to speak by the time of their death.&lt;ref name="DoyleALS"&gt;[[#refDoylePhillips|Doyle &amp; Phillips]].&lt;/ref&gt; In a procedure known as voice banking, people with ALS may digitally record words and phrases while still able to do so, for later inclusion in a communication device.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refStern|Stern]].&lt;/ref&gt; AAC systems used typically change over time depending on severity of speech impairment, physical status, and the individual's communication needs.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refBall|Ball]], p. 441.&lt;/ref&gt; Use of augmentative communication strategies generally begins when speaking rate drops to 100 words per minute.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refDuffy|Duffy]], pp. 245–246.&lt;/ref&gt; In the early stages, AAC may consist of using an alphabet board to cue the listener to the first letter of the word being spoken, and may be used with those less familiar with the individual. In the later stages, AAC often becomes the main communicative method, although familiar conversation partners may still understand some spoken words.&lt;ref name="BS ALS Stages"&gt;[[#refBall|Ball]], pp. 445–447.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since cognition and vision are typically unaffected in ALS, writing-based systems are preferred to graphic symbols, as they allow the unlimited expression of all words in a language.&lt;ref name="BS ALS Stages"/&gt;

The method of access to a communication device depends on the type and severity of the disease. In the spinal form of ALS, the limbs are affected from the onset of the disease; in these cases a head mouse or eye tracking access may be used initially.&lt;ref name="MathyALS"&gt;[[#refMathy2000|Mathy]], p 198.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the [[bulbar]] form, speech is affected before the limbs; here handwriting and typing on keyboard-style devices are frequently the first forms of AAC.&lt;ref name="BM ALS 2"/&gt; AAC users may change access methods as the disease progresses.  Low-tech systems, such as eye gazing or partner assisted scanning, are used in situations when electronic devices are unavailable (for example, during bathing) and in the final stages of the disease.&lt;ref name="BM ALS 2"&gt;[[#refBall|Ball]], pp. 444–445.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BM ALS 2"/&gt;

===Parkinson's disease===
[[File:dynawrite.jpg|right|thumb|alt= a communication device resembling a computer keyboard with a small liquid-crystal display attached to the top| Keyboard text-to-speech generating device for literate users with adequate fine motor control]][[Parkinson's disease]] is a progressive neurological condition&lt;ref name="Armstrong"&gt;[[#refArmstrong2000|Armstrong]].&lt;/ref&gt; in which [[dysarthria]] may develop later in the progression of the disease.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refDuffy|Duffy]], p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt; Some individuals eventually lose all functional speech.&lt;ref name="BM Parkinsons"&gt;[[#refBall|Ball]], pp. 455–460.&lt;/ref&gt; AAC approaches are generally used to supplement and support natural speech.&lt;ref name="BM Parkinsons"/&gt; A portable amplifier, for example, may be used to increase the volume of speech and thus its intelligibility. The individual may be taught to point to the first letter of each word they say on an alphabet board, leading to a reduced speech rate and visual cues for the listener to compensate for impaired articulation. Entire words can be spelled out if necessary.&lt;ref name="BM Parkinsons"/&gt; In users that have reduced range and speed of movement, a smaller than usual selection display may be preferred.&lt;ref name="BM Parkinsons"/&gt; High-tech AAC keyboard speech-generating devices are also used; keyguards may be required to prevent accidental keystrokes caused by the [[tremor]] typical of the disease.&lt;ref name="BM Parkinsons"/&gt; Factors affecting AAC use in Parkinson's disease include motor deficits and cognitive changes; the latter may result in unawareness of their problems with spoken communication.&lt;ref name="Armstrong" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refTjaden2008|Tjaden]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Multiple sclerosis===
Dysarthria is the most common communication problem in individuals with [[multiple sclerosis]] (MS), however, significant difficulties with speech and intelligibility are uncommon.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refBall|Ball]], pp. 448–449.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refBeukelman1985|Beukelman (1985)]].&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals with MS vary widely in their motor control capacity and the presence of [[intention tremor]], and methods of access to AAC technology are adapted accordingly. Visual impairments are common in MS and may necessitate approaches using auditory scanning systems, large-print text, or synthetic speech feedback that plays back words and letters as they are typed.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refBall|Ball]], pp. 449–454.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dementia===
[[Dementia]] is an acquired, chronic, cognitive impairment
characterized by deficits in memory and other cognitive domains.&lt;ref name="Beukelmanfagar" /&gt;&lt;ref name=friedoken&gt;[[#refFriedOken2009|Fried-Oken (2009)]].&lt;/ref&gt; Communication impairments are partly attributed to memory deficits,&lt;ref name="friedoken" /&gt; and AAC intervention may be used to compensate for deficits and to capitalize on the person's strengths, such as the ability to recognize material they cannot recall.&lt;ref name="BM Dementia"&gt;[[#refGarrettLasker|Garrett &amp; Lasker]], pp. 508–515.&lt;/ref&gt; Low-tech devices are generally preferred, such as memory books that include autobiographical information, daily schedules, photographs, and reminders or labels.&lt;ref name="BM Dementia"/&gt; Several studies have shown positive outcomes in the amount of on-topic conversation and the length of interaction with these approaches.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refAndrewsSalvia2003|Andrews-Salvia]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refBourgeois1993|Bourgeois (1993)]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bourgeois&gt;[[#refBourgeois2001|Bourgeois (2001)]].&lt;/ref&gt; The gains were maintained four months after the training in the use of the memory aids had ceased.&lt;ref name=bourgeois/&gt; High-tech devices with voice output have been found to be less effective; in one study devices resulted in limited topic elaboration/initiation, reduced output and heightened distraction.&lt;ref name="friedoken" /&gt; AAC is also used to enhance the comprehension of those with dementia. The use of augmented listening strategies, such as identifying topics of conversation with pictures, improves the conversational skills of individuals with dementia.&lt;ref name="BM Dementia"/&gt;

==History==
[[File:Lengua de Signos (Juan Pablo Bonet, 1620) A.jpg|thumb|upright|right| alt=a scan of the cover of a historic book, it shows some Spanish text and a drawing of a hand forming a sign| A page from a 1620 Spanish treatise on [[finger spelling]]]]
The history of AAC can be traced to the days of [[classical Rome]] and [[Classical Greece|Greece]], with the first recorded use of augmentative strategies with the [[deaf]].&lt;ref name = "Glennen1997p7"&gt;[[#refGlennenchap1|Glennen]], p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Zangari"&gt;[[#refZangari|Zangari]].&lt;/ref&gt; The use of manual alphabets and signs was recorded in Europe from the 16th century, as was the gestural system of Hand Talk used by [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] to facilitate communication between different linguistic groups.&lt;ref name = "Glennen1997p7"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Zangari" /&gt; The first known widely available communication aid was a letter and word-based communication board developed for, and with, F. Hall Roe, who had cerebral palsy. This communication board was distributed in the 1920s by a men's group in [[Minneapolis]].&lt;ref name = "vanD"&gt;[[#refVanderheide|Vanderheiden]].&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Patient Operated Selector Mechanism.jpg|alt= a black and white photograph showing a user sitting in front of a modified typewrite, there is grid of letters above the typewriter that appear to be lighting up in sequence, a tube goes from the users mouth to the machine|thumb|upright|right|The Patient Operated Selector Mechanism (POSM or POSSUM) was developed in the United Kingdom in the early 1960s.]]
The modern era of AAC began in the 1950s in Europe and North America, spurred by several societal changes; these included an increased awareness of individuals with communication and other disabilities, and a growing commitment, often backed by government legislation and funding, to develop their education, independence and rights.&lt;ref name="Zangari" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Hourcade2004"&gt;[[#refHourcade2004|Hourcade]].&lt;/ref&gt; In the early years, AAC was primarily used with [[laryngectomy]] and [[glossectomy]] cases, and later with individuals with cerebral palsy and aphasia.&lt;ref name = "Glennen1997p8"&gt;[[#refGlennenchap1|Glennen]], p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; It was typically only employed after traditional speech therapy had failed, as many felt hesitant to provide non-speech intervention to those who might be able to learn to speak.&lt;ref name="Zangari" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hourcade2004" /&gt; Individuals with intellectual impairment were not provided with AAC support because it was believed that they did not possess the prerequisite skills for AAC.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson"&gt;[[#refWilkinsonHennig|Wilkinson &amp; Hennig]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hourcade2004" /&gt; The main systems used were manual signs, communication boards and Morse code, though in the early 1960s, an electric communication device in the form of a sip-and-puff typewriter controller named the Patient Operated Selector Mechanism (POSM or POSSUM) was developed in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="vanD" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Zangari" /&gt;

From the 1960s onward, sign language increased in acceptance and use in the [[Deaf culture|Deaf community]], and AAC also came to be viewed as acceptable for those with other diagnoses.&lt;ref name="Hourcade2004" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Glennen1997p8"/&gt; Manual sign languages, such as [[Makaton]], were advocated for those with both hearing and cognitive impairments, and later for those with intellectual impairment or autism with normal hearing.&lt;ref name="Zangari" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hourcade2004"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mirenda2009page5-9"/&gt; Research into whether [[primate]]s could learn to sign or use graphic symbols spurred further interest the use of AAC with those with cognitive impairments.&lt;ref name="Zangari" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "Glennen1997p8"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mirenda2009page5-9"&gt;[[#refMirenda2009page5-9|Mirenda]] pp. 5–9.&lt;/ref&gt;  The use of [[Plains Indian Sign Language|Amer-Ind hand signals]] opened the field to AAC techniques specifically for adult users.&lt;ref name="Zangari" /&gt;

[[Blissymbols]] were first used in Canada in 1971 to provide communication to those not able to use traditional orthography; their use quickly spread to other countries.&lt;ref name="vanD" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Zangari" /&gt; With improved technology, keyboard communication devices developed in Denmark, the Netherlands and the US increased in portability; the typed messages were displayed on a screen or strip of paper. By the end of the 1970s, communication devices were being commercially produced, and a few, such as the HandiVoice, had voice output.&lt;ref name="vanD" /&gt; Countries such as Sweden, Canada and the United Kingdom initiated government-funded services for those with severe communication impairments, including developing centres of clinical and research expertise.&lt;ref name="Zangari" /&gt;

The late 1970s and 1980s saw a massive increase of AAC-related research, publications, and training as well the first national and international conferences.&lt;ref name="Zangari" /&gt; The [[International Society for Alternative and Augmentative Communication]] (ISAAC) was founded in 1983; its members included clinicians, teachers, rehabilitation engineers, researchers, and AAC users themselves. The organization has since played an important role in developing the field through its peer-reviewed journal, conferences, national chapters and its focus on AAC in [[developing countries]].&lt;ref name="vanD" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Zangari" /&gt; AAC became an area of professional specialization; a 1981 [[American Speech-Language-Hearing Association]] position paper, for example, recognized AAC as a field of practice for speech-language pathologists.&lt;ref name = "Glennen1997p10"&gt;[[#refGlennenchap1|Glennen]], p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, AAC users and family members played an increasing prominent role in the development of knowledge of AAC through their writing and presentations, by serving on committees and founding advocacy organizations.&lt;ref name="Zangari" /&gt;
{{Quote box
| quote = "Knowing that most of y'all do not know the HandiVoice, I will describe it...It was operated with a numeric keyboard...Each word, or sentence, or phrase, or phoneme was stored and accessed by a three digit code, for example, "hello" was 010...It took three codes to say "Rick", that was nine numbers. Now if you think that's bad, let's go for the simple sentence, "Hello, this is Rick Creech speaking." This would have taken fifteen 3 digit codes, for a total of forty-five numbers. Looking back, I am not surprised that very few professionals thought a person could successfully use the HandiVoice 120. But I did. I did, because being able to communicate with people was so empowering to me."

From the 1980s, improvements in technology led to a greatly increased number, variety, and performance of commercially available communication devices, and a reduction in their size and price. Alternative methods of access such eye pointing or scanning became available on communication devices.&lt;ref name="Zangari" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hourcade2004" /&gt; Speech output possibilities included digitized and synthesized speech, with text-to-speech options available in German, French, Italian, Spanish, Swedish and [[Ewe language|Ewe]].&lt;ref name="Zangari" /&gt; AAC services became more holistic, seeking to develop a balance of aided and unaided strategies with the goal of improving functioning in the person's daily life, and greater involvement of the family.&lt;ref name="Hourcade2004" /&gt; Increasingly, individuals with acquired conditions such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Parkinson's disease, head injury, and locked-in syndrome, received AAC services.&lt;ref name="Zangari" /&gt; In addition, with the challenge to the notion of AAC prerequisites, those with severe to profound intellectual impairments began to be served.&lt;ref name="Hourcade2004" /&gt; Courses on AAC were developed for professional training programs, and literature such as textbooks and guides were written to support students, clinicians and parents.&lt;ref name="Zangari" /&gt;

The 1990s brought a focus on greater independence for people with disabilities, and more inclusion in mainstream society .&lt;ref name="Zangari" /&gt; In schools, students with [[special needs]] were placed in regular classrooms rather than segregated settings, which led to an increased use of AAC as a means of improving student participation in class.&lt;ref name="Hourcade2004" /&gt; Interventions became more collaborative and naturalistic, taking place in the classroom with the teacher, rather than in a therapy room.&lt;ref name="Zangari" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hourcade2004" /&gt; [[Facilitated communication]] – a method by which a facilitator physically and emotionally supports a person with severe communication needs as they type on a keyboard or letter board – received wide attention in the media and in the field.  The question of the authorship made the approach controversial; most of the subsequent research indicated that the facilitators were unknowingly influencing the messages typed.&lt;ref name="Zangari" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mirenda2009page5-9"/&gt; As a result, professional organizations and AAC researchers and clinicians have not typically accepted facilitated communication.&lt;ref name="Mirenda2009page5-9"/&gt;

Rapid progress in [[Personal computer hardware|hardware]] and [[Computer software|software]] development continued, including projects funded by the [[European Community]]. The first commercially available [[Speech generating device#Dynamic display devices|dynamic screen speech generating devices]] were developed in the 1990s. At the same time synthesized speech was becoming available in more languages. Software programs were developed that allowed the computer-based production of communication boards.&lt;ref name="Zangari" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hourcade2004" /&gt; High-tech devices have continued to reduce in size and weight,&lt;ref name="Hourcade2004" /&gt; while increasing accessibility and capacities. Modern communication devices can also enable users to access the internet and some can be used as [[environmental control device]]s for independent access of TV, radio, telephone etc.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refRobitaille|Robitaille]], pp. 151–153.&lt;/ref&gt;
  
Future directions for AAC focus on improving device interfaces, reducing the cognitive and linguistic demands of AAC, and the barriers to effective social interaction.&lt;ref name="Higginbotham" /&gt; AAC researchers have challenged manufacturers to develop communication devices that are more appealing aesthetically, with greater options for leisure and play and that are easier to use.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refLightdrager|Light &amp; Drager]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cook/&gt; The rapid advances in [[smartphone]] and [[tablet computer]] technologies has the potential to radically change the availability of economical, accessible, flexible communication devices;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[[#McNaughtonLight2013|McNaughton &amp; Light, 2013]]&lt;/ref&gt;  however, the user interfaces are needed that meet the various physical and cognitive challenges of AAC users.&lt;ref name="cook"&gt;[[#refCook|Cook]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name=higginbotham2&gt;[[#refHigginbotham|Higginbotham &amp; Jacobs]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Android (operating system)|Android]] and other [[open source]] operating systems, provide opportunities for small communities, such as AAC, to develop the accessibility features and software required.&lt;ref name=higginbotham2/&gt; Other promising areas of development include the access of communication devices using signals from movement recognition technologies that interpret body motions, or electrodes measuring brain activity, and the automatic transcription of dysarthric speech using [[speech recognition]] systems.&lt;ref name="Higginbotham" /&gt; Utterance-based systems, in which frequent utterances are organized in sets to improve the speed of communication exchange, are also in development.&lt;ref name="Higginbotham" /&gt; Similarly, research has focussed on the provision of timely access to vocabulary and conversation appropriate for specific interactions.&lt;ref name="Higginbotham" /&gt;&lt;ref name="red"&gt;[[#red|Reddington &amp; Tintarev]]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Natural language generation]] techniques have been investigated,&lt;ref name="Newell"&gt;[[#refNewell|Newell]], p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="black"&gt;[[#black|Black et al.]]&lt;/ref&gt; including the use of logs of past conversations with conversational partners,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Ashraf|Ashraf et al.]]&lt;/ref&gt; data from a user's schedule&lt;ref name="Newell"/&gt; and from real-time Internet vocabulary searches,&lt;ref name="Higginbotham" /&gt;&lt;ref name="webcrawler"&gt;[[#Luowebcrawler|Luo et al.]]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as information about location from [[global positioning systems]] and other sensors.&lt;ref name="Higginbotham" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Newell"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#patel|Patel &amp; Radhakrishnan]]&lt;/ref&gt; However, despite the frequent focus on technological advances in AAC, practitioners are urged to retain the focus on the communication needs of the AAC users: "The future for AAC will not be driven by advances in technology, but rather by how well we can take advantage of those advancements for the enhancement of communicative opportunities for individuals who have complex communication needs".&lt;ref name="cook"/&gt;

'''''Black Angels''''' (Edition Peters, New York, no. 66304, copyright 1971), subtitled "Thirteen Images from the Dark Land", is a work for "electric [[string quartet]]" by the American [[avant-garde]] composer [[George Crumb]]. It was composed over the course of a year and is dated "Friday the Thirteenth, March 1970 (in tempore belli)" as written on the score.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://kronosquartet.org/projects/detail/black_angels|title = Kronos Quartet|website = kronosquartet.org|access-date = 2016-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Crumb is very interested in [[numerology]] and numerically structured the piece around 13 and 7. The piece is notable for its unconventional instrumentation, which calls for electric string instruments, crystal glasses, and two suspended tam-tam gongs. The work references the second movement, Andante con moto from Schubert’s ‘Death and the Maiden’ String Quartet.

== Structure ==
The thirteen individual movements of ''Black Angels'' are divided into three large groups.

'''I. Departure'''

Threnody I: Night of the Electric Insects (tutti)

Sounds of Bones and Flutes (trio)

Lost Bells (duo)

Devil-music (solo)

Danse Macabre (duo)

'''II. Absence'''

Pavana Lachrymae (trio)

Threnody II: Black Angels! (tutti)

Sarabanda de la Muerte Oscura (trio)

Lost Bells (Echo) (duo)

'''III. Return'''

God-music (solo)

Ancient Voices (duo)

Ancient Voices (Echo) (trio)

Threnody III: Night of the Electric Insects (tutti)

The structure of the work displays the numerological elements important to Crumb, that is, thirteen movements, of which the seventh is the centerpiece. Further, the organization of movements displays symmetry and palindrome: the instrumentation of each movement follows a palindromic structure: 4, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 3, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4; the first, central and thirteenth movements are titled Threnody; God-music and Devil-music stand symmetrically opposite each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.mtosmt.org/issues/mto.12.18.2/mto.12.18.2.johnston.html|title = MTO 18.2: Johnston, George Crumb’s Black Angels|website = www.mtosmt.org|access-date = 2016-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Instrumentation==
''Black Angels'' is primarily written for (in Crumb's words) "electric string quartet."  Though generally played by amplified acoustic instruments, the work is occasionally performed on specially constructed electronic string instruments.  The music uses the extremes of the instruments' registers as well as [[extended techniques]] such as bowing on the [[fingerboard]] above the fingers and tapping the strings with thimbles.  At certain points in the music, the players are even required to make sounds with their mouths and to speak.

Each of the string players is also assigned a set of instruments to play throughout the piece.  Some of the equipment requires specific preparation, such as the crystal glasses, which are tuned with different amounts of water.

'''Violin 1'''
* [[maraca]]
* 7 crystal glasses
* 6" glass rod
* 2 metal [[thimble]]s
* metal pick (paper clip)

'''Violin 2'''
* 15" suspended [[tam-tam]] and mallet
* [[double bass|contrabass]] bow (for use on tam-tam)
* 7 crystal glasses
* 6" glass rod
* 2 metal thimbles
* metal pick (paper clip)

'''Viola'''
* 6 crystal glasses
* 6" glass rod
* 2 metal thimbles
* metal pick

'''Cello'''
* maraca
* 24" suspended tam-tam, soft and hard mallets
* contrabass bow

==Stage positioning==
Crumb's score includes a diagram that places the four musicians in a box-like formation.  Electric Violin II and Electric Cello are located near upstage right and upstage left, respectively, with their tam-tams between them.  Electric Violin I and Electric Viola are near downstage right and downstage left, respectively, but are slightly farther apart than the other two musicians in order to allow full sight of the quartet.  Violin I, Violin II and Viola have a set of crystal glasses downstage of them, while Violin I and Cello have maracas upstage of them.  Each of the four musicians has a speaker next to him or her.

== Cultural influences==
The [[Kronos Quartet]], which specializes in new music, was originally formed when violinist David Harrington heard "Black Angels" over the radio.&lt;ref name="PBSNewsHour_03Dec1998_Kronos_BlackAngels"&gt;

|accessdate=9 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He thought Crumb's piece was "something wild, something scary" and "absolutely the right music to play."&lt;ref name="Kronos_25thAnniversary_BlackAngels"&gt;{{cite web

It was the first composition Kronos performed.&lt;ref name="Kronos_25thAnniversary_BlackAngels"/&gt; The Kronos Quartet recorded the work on their album ''[[Black Angels (album)|Black Angels]]''.

The campaign reached its peak between 1920 and 1923, but did not stop until 1930.

Along with phrases like  "the black scourge" and "black horror", these terms were used by campaigners in different countries beyond Germany, such as the [[United Kingdom]], [[United States]] and [[Canada]].

'''''Bugs Bunny in Double Trouble''''' is a [[Looney Tunes]] [[video game]] developed by [[Atod|Atod AB]] for the [[Sega Genesis]] and [[Game Gear]], released in [[1996 in video gaming|1996]]. The game stars [[Bugs Bunny]] and features pre-rendered [[Computer-generated imagery|3D]] graphics.

==Plot==
One night, Bugs Bunny is fast asleep in his bed, as he starts to drift off into a dream. In his dream, he sees [[Yosemite Sam]] experimenting on a "giant carrot serum", but before he could take action, Sam orders [[Gossamer (Looney Tunes)|Gossamer]] to fetch the rabbit's brain for his robot, prompting chase. Bugs soon comes across a "Televisor" and is transported to many of his times from older cartoons, in which he must complete several objectives in each level.

After finishing all 4 levels, Bugs Bunny attempts to escape the haunted castle and defeat both Gossamer and Yosemite Sam in the laboratory. He eventually succeeds and exits the castle to escape inside a rocket ship. Bugs soon found himself stranded in space after the launch, as he spots a nearby space scooter which he uses to travel across the galaxy and face a new threat: [[Marvin the Martian]] and his trusty dog sidekick K-9. Upon reaching Marvin's home planet, [[Mars]], Bugs comes across some levers and switches them around, foiling Marvin's plans, and upon leaving back to Earth, he tosses the dynamite stick he previously rescued over to Marvin, resulting in the destruction of Mars itself. Eventually, Bugs wakes up back in his bed, only to find a giant carrot sitting right in front of him, much to his dismay.

==Gameplay==

Similarly to 1994's ''[[Mickey Mania: The Timeless Adventures of Mickey Mouse]]'', the levels are mainly based on individual Bugs Bunny cartoons from [[Warner Bros.]]' [[Looney Tunes]] and [[Merrie Melodies]] series, stringing them together by having Bugs trapped in a "Televisor" created by Yosemite Sam as a mad scientist. Seven of the levels are based on the Bugs Bunny cartoons ''[[Duck! Rabbit, Duck!]]'', ''[[Bully for Bugs]]'', ''[[Knighty Knight Bugs]]'', ''[[Hare-Abian Nights]]'', ''[[Spaced Out Bunny]]'', ''[[Mad as a Mars Hare]]'', and ''[[Hare-Way to the Stars]]'', while the other level, entitled ''Haunted Hare'', is based on elements of ''[[Bewitched Bunny]]'' and ''[[Hair-Raising Hare]]''. On the Game Gear version, the ''Bully for Bugs'' level is altered to instead be named and based on the cartoon ''[[Roman Legion-Hare]]'', though similar gameplay is maintained. The ''Spaced Out Bunny'' level is absent in the Game Gear version as well.

Each level features objectives, designs, and opposing characters based on the source cartoon(s), though some levels include plot elements, weapons, and obstacles that weren't present in the original cartoons. For example, the ''Hare-Abian Nights'' level features a duel with Yosemite Sam over a genie's lamp, and ''Spaced Out Bunny'' is essentially a race against Marvin the Martian to Mars. As well, the ''Duck! Rabbit, Duck!'' level does not have the snow present in the original cartoon.

''[[GamePro]]'' gave the Game Gear version a brief negative review, criticizing the gameplay, music, and particularly the difficult-to-see graphics, commenting that "Signs, enemies, and items are so tiny you'll need a magnifying glass."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Bugs Bunny in Double Trouble|magazine=[[GamePro]] |issue=100|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]] |date=January 1997|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''Butoh'''|[[wikt:舞踏|舞踏]]|Butō}} is a form of Japanese dance theatre that encompasses a diverse range of activities, techniques and motivations for [[dance]], performance, or movement. Following [[World War II]], butoh arose in 1959 through collaborations between its two key founders [[Tatsumi Hijikata|Hijikata Tatsumi]] and [[Kazuo Ohno|Ohno Kazuo]]. The art form is known to "resist fixity"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Waychoff|first=Brianne|title=Butoh, Bodies and Being|url=http://opensiuc.lib.siu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1003&amp;context=kaleidoscope|work=Kaleidoscope|accessdate=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and be difficult to define; notably, founder Hijikata Tatsumi viewed the formalisation of butoh with "distress".&lt;ref name="Sanders 152"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sanders|first=Vicki|title=Dancing and the Dark Soul of Japan: An Aesthetic Analysis of "Butō"|journal=Asian Theatre Journal|date=Autumn 1988|volume=5|issue=2|page=152|jstor=25161489}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common features of the art form include playful and grotesque imagery, taboo topics, extreme or absurd environments, and it is traditionally performed in white body makeup with slow hyper-controlled motion. However, with time butoh groups are increasingly being formed around the world, with their various aesthetic ideals and intentions.

==History==
Butoh first appeared in Japan post-[[World War II]] in 1959, under the collaboration of [[Tatsumi Hijikata|Hijikata Tatsumi]] and [[Kazuo Ohno|Ohno Kazuo]], "in the protective shadow of the 1950s and 1960s avant-garde".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sanders|first=Vicki|title=Dancing and the Dark Soul of Japan: An Aesthetic Analysis of "Butō"|journal=Asian Theatre Journal|date=Autumn 1988|volume=5|issue=2|page=148|jstor=25161489}}&lt;/ref&gt; A key impetus of the art form was a reaction against the Japanese dance scene then, which Hijikata felt was overly based on imitating the West and following traditional styles like [[Noh]]. Thus, he sought to "turn away from the Western styles of dance, ballet and modern",&lt;ref name="Sanders 152"/&gt; and to create a new aesthetic that embraced the "squat, earthbound physique... and the natural movements of the common folk".&lt;ref name="Sanders 152"/&gt; This desire found form in the early movement of '''ankoku butō''' (暗黒舞踏). The term means "dance of darkness", and the form was built on a vocabulary of "crude physical gestures and uncouth habits... a direct assault on the refinement (''miyabi'') and understatement (''shibui'') so valued in Japanese aesthetics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sanders|first=Vicki|title=Dancing and the Dark Soul of Japan: An Aesthetic Analysis of "Butō"|journal=Asian Theatre Journal|date=Autumn 1988|volume=5|issue=2|page=149|jstor=25161489}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first butoh piece, ''[[Kinjiki]]'' (''Forbidden Colours)'' by [[Tatsumi Hijikata]], premiered at a [[dance festival]] in 1959. It was based on the novel of the same name by [[Yukio Mishima]]. It explored the taboo of [[male homosexuality|homosexuality]] and ended with a live [[chicken]] being held between the legs of Kazuo Ohno's son Yoshito Ohno, after which Hijikata chased Yoshito off the stage in darkness. Mainly as a result of the misconception that the chicken had died due to [[strangulation]], this piece outraged the audience and resulted in the banning of Hijikata from the festival, establishing him as an [[iconoclasm|iconoclast]].

The earliest butoh performances were called (in [[English language|English]]) "Dance Experience." In the early 1960s, Hijikata used the term "Ankoku-Buyou" (暗黒舞踊 – dance of darkness) to describe his dance. He later changed the word "buyo," filled with associations of Japanese classical dance, to "butoh," a long-discarded word for dance that originally meant European [[ballroom dancing]].&lt;ref name="Kurihara, Nanako 1996"&gt;Kurihara, Nanako.  ''The Most Remote Thing in the Universe: Critical Analysis of Hijikata Tatsumi's Butoh Dance''.  Diss.  New York U, 1996.  Ann Arbor: UMI, 1996.  9706275&lt;/ref&gt;

In later work, Hijikata continued to subvert conventional notions of dance. Inspired by writers such as Yukio Mishima (as noted above), [[Lautréamont]], [[Artaud]], [[Jean Genet|Genet]] and [[Marquis de Sade|de Sade]], he delved into grotesquerie, darkness, and decay. At the same time, Hijikata explored the transmutation of the human body into other forms, such as those of animals. He also developed a poetic and surreal choreographic language, ''butoh-fu'' （舞踏譜） (''fu'' means "notation" in Japanese), to help the dancer transform into other states of being.

The work developed beginning in 1960 by [[Kazuo Ohno]] with Tatsumi Hijikata was the beginning of what now is regarded as "butoh." In Nourit Masson-Sékiné and Jean Viala's book ''Shades of Darkness'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nouritms.fr/ouvrages.htm|title=Publications|author=|date=|website=nouritms.fr|accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ohno is regarded as "the soul of butoh," while Hijikata is seen as "the architect of butoh." Hijikata and Ohno later developed their own styles of teaching. Students of each style went on to create different groups such as [[Sankai Juku]], a Japanese dance troupe well known to fans in North America.

Students of these two great artists have been known to highlight the differing orientations of their masters. While Hijikata was a fearsome technician of the nervous system influencing input strategies and artists working in groups, Ohno is thought of as a more natural, individual, and nurturing figure who influenced solo artists.

Starting in the early 1980s, butoh experienced a renaissance as butoh groups began performing outside Japan for the first time; at that the style was marked by "full body paint (white or dark or gold), near or complete nudity, shaved heads, grotesque costumes, clawed hands, rolled-up eyes and mouths opened in silent screams."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Loke|first1=Margarett|title=Butoh: Dance of Darkness|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/11/01/magazine/butoh-dance-of-darkness.html?pagewanted=all|work=The New York Times|date=1 November 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tanaka|first1=Nobuko|title='Crazy Camel' helps butoh over the hump|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/culture/2016/01/23/stage/crazy-camel-helps-butoh-hump/#.V_cLJJMrKV4|work=The Japan Times|date=January 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sankai Juku was a touring butoh group; during one performance by Sankai Juku, in which the performers hung upside down from ropes from a tall building in [[Seattle, Washington]], one of the ropes broke, resulting in the death of a performer.  The footage was played on national news, and butoh became more widely known in America through the tragedy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kyotojournal.org/interviews/dancekitchen.html "The Dance: Sankai Juku Opens", Anna Kisselgoff, ''New York Times''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704110328/http://www.kyotojournal.org/interviews/dancekitchen.html |date=2008-07-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A PBS documentary of a butoh performance in a cave with no audience further broadened knowledge in America.

In the early 1990s, [[Koichi Tamano]] performed atop the giant drum of [[San Francisco Taiko Dojo]] inside [[Grace Cathedral, San Francisco|Grace Cathedral]], in an international religious celebration.{{citation needed|date=September 2008}}

There is a theatre in Kyoto, Japan, called the [[Kyoto Butoh-kan]] which attempts to be dedicated to regular professional Butoh performances.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/culture/2016/07/07/stage/new-butoh-venue-aims-intimacy/#.WF9kG7F7GRs|title=New butoh venue aims for intimacy {{!}} The Japan Times|newspaper=The Japan Times|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.japantoday.com/category/arts-culture/view/worlds-first-dedicated-butoh-theater-to-open-in-kyoto|title=World’s first dedicated Butoh theater to open in Kyoto|newspaper=Japan Today|access-date=2016-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Debate===
There is much discussion about who should receive the credit for creating butoh. As artists worked to create new art in all disciplines after World War II, Japanese artists and thinkers emerged from economic and social challenges that produced an energy and renewal of artists, dancers, painters, musicians, writers, and all other artists.

A number of people with few formal connections to Hijikata began to call their own idiosyncratic dance "butoh."  Among these are Iwana Masaki (岩名雅紀), [[Min Tanaka]] (田中民), and Teru Goi.&lt;ref&gt;Kuniyoshi, Kazuko.  ''An Overview of the Contemporary Japanese Dance Scene''.  Tokyo: The Japan Foundation, 1985; Viala, Jean.  Butoh: Shades of Darkness.  Tokyo: Shufunotomo, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although all manner of systematic thinking about butoh dance can be found, perhaps Iwana Masaki most accurately sums up the variety of butoh styles:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
While 'Ankoku Butoh' can be said to have possessed a very precise method and philosophy (perhaps it could be called 'inherited butoh'), I regard present day butoh as a 'tendency' that depends not only on Hijikata's philosophical legacy but also on the development of new and diverse modes of expression.

The 'tendency' that I speak of involved extricating the pure life which is dormant in our bodies.&lt;ref name="Iwana"&gt;Iwana, Masaki. ''The Dance and Thoughts of Masaki Iwana''.  Tokyo: Butoh Kenkyuu-jo Hakutou-kan, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Hijikata is often quoted saying what opposition he had to a codified dance:  "Since I believe neither in a dance teaching method nor in controlling movement, I do not teach in this manner." &lt;ref&gt;quoted in Viala 186&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in the pursuit and development of his own work, it is only natural that a "Hijikata" style of working and, therefore, a "method" emerged.  Both Mikami Kayo and Maro Akaji have stated that Hijikata exhorted his disciples to not imitate his own dance when they left to create their own butoh dance groups.  If this is the case, then his words make sense: There are as many types of butoh as there are butoh choreographers.

== Butoh exercises ==

Most butoh exercises use image work to varying degrees: from the razorblades and insects of Ankoku Butoh, to Dairakudakan's threads and water jets, to Seiryukai's rod in the body. There is a general trend toward the body as "being moved," from an internal or external source, rather than consciously moving a body part. A certain element of "control vs. uncontrol" is present through many of the exercises.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Coelho, Abel.  "A Compilation of Butoh Exercises" Honolulu: U H Dept. of Theatre and Dance 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Conventional butoh exercises sometimes cause great duress or pain but, as Kurihara points out, pain, starvation, and sleep deprivation were all part of life under Hijikata's method,&lt;ref name="Kurihara, Nanako 1996" /&gt; which may have helped the dancers access a movement space where the movement cues had terrific power. It is also worth noting that Hijikata's movement cues are, in general, much more visceral and complicated than anything else since.

Most exercises from Japan (with the exception of much of Ohno Kazuo's work) have specific body shapes or general postures assigned to them, while almost none of the exercises from Western butoh dancers have specific shapes.  This seems to point to a general trend in the West that butoh is not seen as specific movement cues with shapes assigned to them such as Ankoku Butoh or Dairakudakan's technique work, but rather that butoh is a certain state of mind or feeling that influences the body directly or indirectly.

Hijikata did in fact stress feeling through form in his dance, saying, "Life catches up with form,"&lt;ref name="Ohno 2004"&gt;Ohno, Kazuo and Yoshito Ohno.  ''Kazuo Ohno's World from Without and Within''.  Trans. John Barrett.  Middletown: Wesleyan U P, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; which in no way suggests that his dance was mere form. Ohno, though, comes from the other direction: "Form comes of itself, only insofar as there is a spiritual content to begin with."&lt;ref name="Ohno 2004" /&gt;

The trend toward form is apparent in several Japanese dance groups, who recycle Hijikata's shapes and present butoh that is only body-shapes and choreography&lt;ref&gt;Viala 100&lt;/ref&gt; which would lead butoh closer to contemporary dance or performance art than anything else. A good example of this is Torifune Butoh-sha's recent works.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

A paragraph from butoh dancer Iwana Masaki, whose work shies away from all elements of choreography.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
I have never heard of a butoh dancer entering a competition.  Every butoh performance itself is an ultimate expression; there are not and cannot be second or third places.  If butoh dancers were content with less than the ultimate, they would not be actually dancing butoh, for real butoh, like real life itself, cannot be given rankings.&lt;ref name="Iwana" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Defining butoh==
Critic [[Mark Holborn]] has written that butoh is defined by its very evasion of definition.&lt;ref name="kyotojournal.org"&gt;[http://www.kyotojournal.org/interviews/dancekitchen.html Dance Kitchen, Dustin Leavitt, ''Kyoto Journal'' #70] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704110328/http://www.kyotojournal.org/interviews/dancekitchen.html |date=2008-07-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Kyoto Journal'' variably categorizes butoh as dance, theater, “kitchen,” or “seditious act.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kyotojournal.org/interviews/dancekitchen.html "Dance Kitchen", Dustin Leavitt, ''Kyoto Journal'' #70] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704110328/http://www.kyotojournal.org/interviews/dancekitchen.html |date=2008-07-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''San Francisco Examiner'' describes butoh as "unclassifiable".&lt;ref&gt;"Bizarre and Beautiful Butoh at Lab", Allan Ulrich, ''San Francisco Examiner'', Dec 1, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;   The ''SF Weekly ''article "The Bizarre World of Butoh" was about former sushi restaurant [[Country Station]], in which Koichi Tamano was “chef” and Hiroko Tamano "manager".  The article begins, “There’s a dirty corner of Mission Street, where a sushi restaurant called Country Station shares space with hoodlums and homeless drunks, a restaurant so camouflaged by dark and filth it easily escapes notice.  But when the restaurant is full and bustling, there is a kind of theater that happens inside…”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sfweekly.com/2002-07-17/news/dancing-with-the-butoh-masters/ "The Bizarre World of Butoh", Bernice Yeung, ''San Francisco Weekly'', July 17-23, 2002, cover and p15-22]&lt;/ref&gt; Butoh frequently occurs in areas of extremes of the human condition, such as skid rows, or extreme physical environments, such as a cave with no audience, remote Japanese cemetery, or hanging by ropes from a skyscraper in front of the Washington Monument.&lt;ref&gt;''Butoh'', Mark Holburn and Ethan Hoffman, Sadev Books, 1987&lt;/ref&gt;

Hiroko Tamano considers modeling for artists to be butoh, in which she poses in "impossible" positions held for hours, which she calls "''really'' slow Butoh".{{citation needed|date=September 2008}}  The Tamano's home seconds as a “dance” studio, with any room or portion of yard potentially used. When a completely new student arrived for a workshop in 1989 and found a chaotic simultaneous photo shoot, dress rehearsal for a performance at Berkeley's Zellerbach Hall, workshop, costume making session, lunch, chat, and newspaper interview, all "choreographed" into one event by Tamano, she ordered the student, in broken English, “Do interview.” The new student was interviewed, without informing the reporter that the student had no knowledge what butoh was.  The improvised information was published, “defining” butoh for the area public.  Tamano then informed the student that the interview itself was butoh, and that was the lesson.{{citation needed|date=September 2008}}  Such "seditious acts," or pranks in the context of chaos, are butoh.&lt;ref name="kyotojournal.org" /&gt;

While many approaches to defining butoh—as with any performative tradition—will focus on formalism or semantic layers, another approach is to focus on physical technique. While butoh does not have a codified classical technique rigidly adhered to within an authoritative controlled lineage, Hijikata Tatsumi did have a substantive methodical body of movement techniques called Butoh Fu. Butoh Fu can be described as a series of cues largely based on incorporating visualizations that directly affect the nervous system, producing qualities of movement that are then used to construct the form and expression of the dance. This mode of engaging the nervous system directly has much in common with other mimetic techniques to be found in the history of dance, such as [[L'École Internationale de Théâtre Jacques Lecoq|Lecoq]]'s range of nervous system qualities, [[Étienne Decroux|Decroux]]'s rhythm and density within movement, and Zeami Motokiyo's qualitative descriptions for character types.

==Influence==
Teachers influenced by more Hijikata style approaches tend to use highly elaborate visualizations that can be highly mimetic, theatrical, and expressive. Teachers of this style include Waguri, Yumiko Yoshioka, Minako Seki and Koichi and Hiroko Tamano, founders of Harupin-Ha Butoh Dance Company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.harupin-ha.org/|title=LINE掲示板は危険※安全なＬＩＮＥ交換方法はコレだ！|author=|date=|website=www.harupin-ha.org|accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been many unique groups and performance companies influenced by the movements created by Hijikata and Ohno, ranging from the highly minimalist of [[Sankai Juku]] to very theatrically explosive and carnivalesque performance of groups like [[Dairakudakan]].

==International==


Many [[Japanese people#Japanese living abroad|Nikkei]] (or members of the Japanese diaspora), such as Japanese Canadians Jay Hirabayashi of [[Kokoro Dance]], Denise Fujiwara, incorporate butoh in their dance or have launched butoh dance troupes.

More notable European practitioners, who have worked with butoh and avoided the  stereotyped 'butoh' languages which some European practitioners tend to adopt, take their work out of the sometimes closed world of 'touring butoh' and into the international dance and theatre scenes include SU-EN Butoh Company (Sweden), Marie-Gabrielle Rotie,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rotieproductions.com, http://www.butohuk.com&lt;/ref&gt; Kitt Johnson (Denmark), Vangeline (France), and Katharina Vogel (Switzerland). Such practitioners in Europe aim to go back to the original aims of Hijikata and Ohno and go beyond the tendency to imitate a ' master' and instead search within their own bodies and histories for 'the body that has not been robbed' (Hijikata).

LEIMAY (Brooklyn) emerged 1996-2005 from the creative work of Shige Moriya, Ximena Garnica, Juan Merchan, and Zachary Model at the space known as CAVE. LEIMAY has organized and run diverse programs including, the NY Butoh Kan Training Initiative which later became the NY Butoh Festival; Vietnamese Artist in Residency; NY Butoh Kan Training Initiative which turned into the NY Butoh Kan Teaching Residency and now is called LEIMAY Ludus Training). A key element of LEIMAY's work has become transformation of specific spaces. In this way, the space – at times a body, environment or object – and the body – at times dancer, actor, performer or object – are fundamental to LEIMAY's work.

[[Eseohe Arhebamen]], a princess of the [[Kingdom of Ugu]] and royal descendant of the [[Benin Empire]], is the first indigenous and native-born African butoh performer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swedishpalms.se/2011/04/nigeriansk-butoh.html "Nigeriansk Butoh", Anna, Swedish Palms, 2011] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005002638/http://www.swedishpalms.se/2011/04/nigeriansk-butoh.html |date=2013-10-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She invented a style called "Butoh-vocal theatre" which incorporates singing, talking, mudras, sign language, spoken word, and experimental vocalizations with butoh after the traditional dance styles of the [[Edo people]] of West Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://performance.tisch.nyu.edu/object/eseohearhebamen.html|title=Performance Studies|author=|date=|website=nyu.edu|accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is also known as [[Edoheart]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nyc.gov/html/media/html/tv/nyctv_life_arttrek_edoheart.shtml "Art/Trek NYC - Edoheart", NYC Media, The City of New York, 2012] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004235144/http://www.nyc.gov/html/media/html/tv/nyctv_life_arttrek_edoheart.shtml |date=2013-10-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipccalgary.ca/butohposter.htm|title=U of C|author=|date=|website=www.ipccalgary.ca|accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

COLLAPSING''silence'' Performance Troupe (San Francisco) was established and co-founded by Indra Lowenstein and [[Terrance Graven]] in 1992 and was active until 2001. They were a movement-based troupe that incorporated butoh, [[shibari]], ecstatic trance states, and [[Odissi]]. They designed all of their costumes, props, puppets, and site-specific installations, while collaborating with live musicians such as Sharkbait, Hollow Earth, Haunted by Waters, and Mandible Chatter. In 1996, they were featured at The International Performance Art Festival and also performed at Asian American Dance Performances, San Francisco Butoh Festival, [[Theatre of Yugen]], The Los Angeles County Exposition (L.A.C.E.), Stanford University, [[Yerba Buena Center for the Arts]], and various other venues creating multi-media dance performances.

In 1992, [[Bob DeNatale]] founded the Flesh &amp; Blood Mystery Theater to spread the art of butoh. Performing throughout the United States, Flesh &amp; Blood Mystery Theater was a regular participant in the San Francisco Butoh Festival of which DeNatale was an Associate Producer. DeNatale's other butoh credits include performing in the film Oakland Underground (2006) and touring Germany and Poland with Ex…it! ’99 International Dance Festival.

==Butoh in popular culture==

A Butoh performance choreographed by Yoshito Ohno appears at the beginning of the Tokyo section of [[Hal Hartley]]'s 1995 film ''[[Flirt (1995 film)|Flirt]]''.

[[Ron Fricke]]'s experimental documentary film ''[[Baraka (film)|Baraka]]'' (1992) features scenes of butoh performance.

In the late 1960s, [[exploitation film]] director [[Teruo Ishii]] hired Hijikata to play the role of a [[Doctor Moreau]]-like reclusive [[mad scientist]] in his film [[horror movie]] ''[[Horrors of Malformed Men]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.midnighteye.com/reviews/horrmalf.shtml|title=Midnight Eye review: The Horror of Malformed Men (Edogawa Rampo Zenshu Kyofu Kikei Ningen, 1969, Teruo ISHII)|first=Tom|last=Mes|date=|website=www.midnighteye.com|accessdate=20 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The role was mostly performed as dance. The film has remained largely unseen in Japan for forty years because it was viewed as insensitive to the handicapped.&lt;ref&gt;http://twitchfilm.net/reviews/2007/11/horrors-of-malformed-men-dvd-review.php&lt;/ref&gt;

The video clip for [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s "[[Nothing Really Matters]]" features butoh-style performance.

The video clip for [[Kent (band)|Kent]]'s "[[Musik non stop]]" also features butoh-style performance.

In [[Bust A Groove 2]], a video game released for the [[PlayStation]] in 2000, the dance moves of the hidden boss character Pander are based on Butoh.

The influence of Butoh has also been felt heavily in the [[J-Horror]] movie genre, forming the basis for the appearance of the ghosts in seminal J-Horror [[Ju-on: The Grudge]].&lt;ref&gt;Through A Glass Darkly: Exclusive interview with director Shimizu Takashi from the UK special edition DVD&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kiyoshi Kurosawa]] used butoh movement for actors in his 2001 film ''[[Kairo (film)|Kairo]]'', remade in Hollywood in 2006 as ''[[Pulse (2006 film)|Pulse]]''. The re-make did not feature butoh.

Butoh performance features heavily in [[Doris Dörrie]]'s 2008 film ''[[Cherry Blossoms (film)|Cherry Blossoms]]'', in which a Bavarian [[widower]] embarks on a journey to Japan to grieve for his late wife and develop an understanding of this performance style for which she had held a lifelong fascination.

A portrait of [[Kazuo Ohno]] appears on the cover of the 2009 [[Antony &amp; the Johnsons]]  album ''[[The Crying Light]]''.

Butoh has greatly influenced the [[Sopor Aeternus and the Ensemble of Shadows]], the musical project of Anna-Varney Cantodea. Its visual [[motif (visual arts)|motifs]] are used in for the project's publicity photos and videos.

The Finnish black metal band Black Crucifixion's 2013 music video ''Millions of Twigs Guide Your Way Through the Forest'' heavily features the Japanese butoh artist Ken Mai.

The video clip for [[The Weeknd]]'s "[[Belong To The World]]" features butoh-style performance.

[[Richard Armitage (actor)|Richard Armitage]] cited the dance form as an inspiration for his animalistic portrayal of the villain Francis Dolarhyde (the "Red Dragon") in the third season of [[Hannibal (TV series)|Hannibal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/hannibal-red-dragon-810643 | work=The Hollywood Reporter | title='Hannibal' Red Dragon | date=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He grew up in largely rural Hungary and served in the Hungarian military during World War II. When Russia invaded Hungary in April 1945, he and his family fled to [[Occupation of Austria|Allied-occupied Austria]] and lived in a displaced persons camp for six years. In 1951, they emigrated to Chicago, sponsored by the Presbyterian church. Within the year his former commanding officer suggested to the U.S. government that they hire Bánáthy as a Hungarian instructor at the [[Defense Language Institute|Army Language School]] in [[Monterey, California]]. While living in Monterey, he founded the [[White Stag Leadership Development Program]]. 

His program gained national attention, and the [[Boy Scouts of America]] conducted research into incorporating leadership training into its programs. The Boy Scouts of America's [[Wood Badge (Boy Scouts of America)|Wood Badge]] and [[National Youth Leadership Training|junior leader training]] programs had until then focused primarily on [[Scoutcraft]] skills, not leadership. [[William Hillcourt|William "Green Bar Bill" Hillcourt]] among others resisted the change.

After 20 years, Bánáthy left the renamed [[Defense Language Institute]] and went to work for the [[Far West Laboratory for Educational Research and Development|Far West Laboratory for Research and Development]] in Berkeley and later San Francisco. He retired from Far West in 1989 but maintained an active interest in social systems and science, including attending many conferences and advising students and others in those fields. In 1992, he helped restart the Hungarian Scout Association within his native country. In 2003, Bánáthy and Eva moved to live with their son Tibor in Chico, California. After a brief and unexpected illness, Bánáthy died on September 4, 2003.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

== Biography ==
Béla Bánáthy was born in 1919 in [[Gyula, Hungary|Gyula]], Hungary, as the oldest of four sons. His father Peter was a minister of the [[Reformed Church in Hungary]] and his mother Hildegard Pallmann was a teacher.&lt;ref name=jenink&gt;{{cite journal|title=A Biography of Béla H.

When Bánáthy was about six years old, their family informally [[Adoption|adopted]] Tamas Feri. Tamas was about 13 years old and from a poor gardener's family. Tamas took Bánáthy on his first overnight camp out with his patrol to a small forest near [[Gyula, Hungary|Gyula]]. Bánáthy's father became the Scoutmaster of the "small scouts" troop (similar to American [[Cub Scouting (Boy Scouts of America)|Cub Scouts]]). When Bánáthy was nine years old, he became the troop leader.&lt;ref name=pinebhb /&gt;&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

The family moved about {{convert|84|km|mi}} from Bánáthy's birthplace of Gyula, to [[Makó]], Hungary, about {{convert|202|km|mi}} southeast of [[Budapest]]. He joined the regular scout program of the [[Hungarian Scout Association]] and "Csanad Vezer" Troop 92. During the 1930s, the troop had more than 50 Scouts and 30 "small scouts". They held their monthly troop meetings on Sunday in a large [[Gymnasium (school)|gimnazium]] and met weekly every Saturday as a patrol. Bánáthy reported: "Our weekly patrol meetings focused on [[scoutcraft]] and Scout spirit and guiding us to move through the various stages of advancement in rank."&lt;ref name=pinebhb /&gt;

The Hungarian Scout program had four stages. During the first three years, Bánáthy advanced three stages. The last stage required Bánáthy to earn 25 merit badges. This last stage was called [[Turul]], after the mythical bird of Hungary.&lt;ref name=pinebhb /&gt; From spring to fall, as weather permitted, the patrol had many outings. Every summer the troop went on a two- to three-week long summer camp.&lt;ref name=pinebhb /&gt; Bánáthy and his troop attended the [[4th World Scout Jamboree]] in 1933. Up until this time, he had intended to follow his father into the ministry, but changed his mind.&lt;ref name=jenink/&gt;

Bánáthy later wrote,
{{quote|The highlight of the Jamboree for me was meeting [[Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell|Baden Powell]], the Chief Scout of the World. One day, he visited our camp with the Chief Scout of Hungary, [[Count]] [[Pál Teleki]] (who later became our Prime Minister), and the chief of the camp staff, [[Vitez]] Kisbarnaki Ferenc Farkas, a general staff officer of the Hungarian Royal Army. A few years later he became the [[commander]] of the [[Ludovica Military Academy|Royal Ludovika Akademia]] (when I was a student there). In the 1940s, he became the Chief Scout of Hungary. (I was serving on his staff as head of national junior leadership training.)

For me the Jamboree became a crucial career decision point. I resolved to choose the military as a life work... There were two sources of this decision. One was my admiration of [[Lord Baden-Powell]], and his life-example as a hero of the British Army and the founder and guide of scouting. The other was the influence of Captain Varkonyi, a staff officer of the Jamboree, who was assigned to our Subcamp. We spent hours in conversation about scouting and the military as a career, as a major service in the character development of young Hungarian adults. After the Jamboree we corresponded for a while. By the end of the year I shared my decision with my parents.&lt;ref name=pinebhb&gt;{{cite web | title=Béla's Story: Scouting in Hungary, 1925-1937 |url=http://www.pinetreeweb.com/bhb.htm| author=Lew Orans| accessdate=2008-08-15| date=1996-12-14 |archivedate= February 28, 2003 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030228062045/http://pinetreeweb.com/bhb.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

While at the Jamboree, Bánáthy briefly met Joseph Szentkiralyi, another Scout from Hungary. Hungarian [[Sea Scout]] Paul Ferenc Sujan and American Maurice Tripp also attended. More than 20 years later, these three men collaborated in helping Bánáthy build a leadership program for youth in the United States.

Also in 1933, Bánáthy attended the regional patrol leader training week. Later in 1934, Bánáthy and six other members of his troop traveled to the National Jamboree in Poland. They camped in a large pine forest and visited [[Kraków]] and [[Warsaw]]. The Polish government hosted a banquet for all of the Scouts in the [[Presidential Palace, Warsaw|Presidential Palace]].&lt;ref name=pinebhb /&gt;  In 1934, he was awarded the best notebook prize of the national spring leadership camp and in 1935, he was invited to serve on the junior staff of the same camp at [[Hárshegy]], [[Budapest]].&lt;ref name=pinebhb /&gt; In 1935, the troop traveled to the [[Bükk Mountains]] in northeastern Hungary for their summer camp. As a Senior Patrol leader, Bánáthy and two others took a bicycle tour in advance of the summer camp to preview the camping site.&lt;ref name=pinebhb /&gt;

===Military service during World War II===
{{refimprove section|date=March 2017}}

In 1937, Bánáthy entered the [[:hu:Ludovika Akadémia]] as was the custom for young men aspiring to military careers.&lt;ref name=jenink/&gt; In 1940, at age 21, he was commissioned as a [[Second Lieutenant]] in the [[Mechanized infantry|armored infantry]].

The Hungarian Army expanded rapidly from an initial force of 80,000, but when fighting started, the rank-and-file of the army had undergone only eight weeks of training.&lt;ref name=mollo/&gt;

In 1941, Bánáthy's unit advanced as part of German [[Army Group South]] to within {{convert|140|km|mi}} of Moscow, during a severe November ice storm.  In 1942, as a soldier in the 109,000 strong [[Second Army (Hungary)|Second Hungarian Army]] (Second Magyar Honved), Bánáthy returned to the Russian front. They fought in the [[Battle of Voronezh (1942) |Battle of Voronezh]] at the Don River bend, supporting the German attack. They were charged with protecting the [[Italian Army in Russia|8th Italian Army's]]'s northern flank between the [[Liski, Voronezh Oblast|Novaya Pokrovka]] on the [[Don River (Russia)|Don River]] to [[Rossosh]],&lt;ref&gt;Haupt, Army Group South. p. 199&lt;/ref&gt; part of the larger force defending the drive by the [[6th Army (Wehrmacht)|German 6th Army]] against Soviet General [[Vasily Chuikov]]'s [[62nd Army (Soviet Union)|62nd Army]], which was defending [[Stalingrad]]. Bánáthy was seriously wounded during the action, and he returned from the front to Budapest where he spent seven months recuperating. He married his fiancé, Eva Balazs, with his arm in a sling on December 5, 1942 in Budapest.&lt;ref name=jenink/&gt;&lt;ref name=evanaturalization/&gt; 

Bánáthy was promoted as a [[junior officer]] of the [[Military of Hungary|Royal Hungarian Army]] and served on the faculty of the Ludovika Akademia under his mentor, [[Commandant]] Colonel-General Kisbarnaki General Farkas. Farkas sought a volunteer to teach junior leader training at the academy and Bánáthy volunteered. Farkas also asked Bánáthy to organize a Scout Troop for young men, 19 years and older, which was a common practice within the [[Magyar Cserkészszövetség|Hungarian Scout Association]] at the time.&lt;ref name="teleki"&gt;{{cite book | author = Balázs Ablonczy  | title = Pál Teleki (1879-1941)-The Life of a Controversial Hungarian Politician  | publisher =Columbia University Press  |location= New York  | year = 2006  | isbn=978-0-88033-595-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|133–134}} Bánáthy became committed to training the young men in officer's leadership skills; he served as the voluntary national director for youth leadership development and a member of the National Council of the Hungarian Scout Association.&lt;ref name=vitae/&gt;

In July 1944 Farkas was Commander of the Hungarian VI Army Corps, which had been [[garrison]]ed at [[Debrecen]]. He replaced General Beregfy, who was loyal to the fascist [[Arrow Cross Party]]. During that month, Farkas' VI Army Corp was instrumental in repelling a [[Red Army]] attack across the [[Carpathian mountains]].&lt;ref name=farkas&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hvg.hu/english/20070102_kisbarnaki_farkas.aspx| title=Was Kisbarnaki Farkas a war criminal?

He also knew he would likely be executed if captured. Bánáthy was able to get his wife Eva, one-year-old son [[Béla A. Bánáthy|Béla]] and two-week-old son László out of Budapest. Bánáthy's family, along with other officers and their families, found shelter at first in farmhouses, and later in bunkers, caves, and trenches.

When the Hungarian Second Army was disbanded on 1 December 1944 due to a lack of equipment and personnel, the remaining units of the Second Army, including Bánáthy's, were transferred to the [[Third Army (Hungary)|Third Army]]. The [[Siege of Budapest]] began when the city was encircled on 29 December 1944 by the [[Red Army]]. Bánáthy fought with the remainder of his unit against the Russians until after Budapest fell on 13 February 1945. The Axis was striving to protect the last oil fields they controlled in western Hungary around [[Lake Balaton]]. By late March 1945, most of what was left of the Hungarian Third Army was surrounded and destroyed about {{convert|40|km|mi}} to the west of Budapest in an advance by the Soviet 46th Army towards Vienna.&lt;ref&gt;Dollinger, Hans. ''The Decline and Fall of Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan.'' p 199. {{ISBN|978-0-517-12399-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining shattered units fought on as they retreated progressively westward through the [[Transdanubian Mountains]] towards Austria.

Bánáthy's family and others of the remainder of his and other military units made their way west, along with tens of thousands of other refugees, about {{convert|250|km|mi}} into Austria, trying to stay ahead of advancing Russian troops. Temperatures through the time of their flight remained near {{convert|0|C|F}}.

===Life in displaced persons camp===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-2004-0100, Bayern, Hof Moschendorf, Flüchtlingslager.jpg|thumb|Refugee family in their quarters in Bavaria after the war ended in 1945.]]

Bánáthy reunited with his family in Austria. As the war ended and [[Occupation of Austria|Austria was occupied]] in April 1945 by the French, British, Soviet and US military forces, the family was placed in an Allied [[displaced persons camp]]. They were housed in a single {{convert|6|by|10|ft|m}} room in a wooden barrack; it served as their bedroom, kitchen, living room and firewood storage area. Food was extremely scarce and at times they subsisted on around 600 calories per person per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Arthur A. |last=Noyes |title=Austrian Food Must Be Cut, UNRRA Says |date=March 7, 1946 |publisher= |url=http://www.usfava.com/USFA_Articles6c.htm#article9|work=Stars and Stripes |pages= |accessdate=2008-09-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724223427/http://www.usfava.com/USFA_Articles6c.htm |archivedate=July 24, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; They were among 1.4 million displaced persons in Austria at the time&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= The Early Occupation Period|url= http://www.usarmygermany.com/Sont_USFA.htm|date= 2001-09-23|accessdate= 2009-09-11|deadurl= no|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091205185731/http://www.usarmygermany.com/Sont_USFA.htm|archivedate= 2009-12-05|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; during a worldwide food shortage as a result of the war. Food was also severely restricted by punitive U.S. policies including [[Morgenthau Plan#JCS 1067|directive JCS 1067]]. In 1947 German citizens were surviving on 1040 calories a day, but the Allies were also suffering from food shortages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = John | last = Dietrich | title = The Morgenthau Plan: Soviet Influence on American Postwar Policy | publisher = Algora Publishing | location = New York | year = 2002 | isbn = 1-892941-90-2|pages=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bánáthy later traded for milk to give two-year-old Béla and one-year-old László enough protein. As extremely little food was available in the camps, in early 1947 his wife's twin sister came from Hungary to take their older two sons back to live with the older sister. The Pallendal family, Bánáthy's in-laws, was well-educated and relatively wealthy, so they had access to more food than what was available in the camps. They intended to return the Banathy boys to their parents within a year. Beginning in early 1948, when the [[Cold War]] ensued, it became virtually impossible for refugees or displaced persons to cross from the border of one country into another, or even from one [[Allied Occupation Zones in Germany|Occupation Zone]] to another.&lt;ref name=evaobit&gt;{{cite web|title=Eva Banathy Obituary|url=http://www.brusiefh.com/obituaries/Eva-Banathy-1216-2/#!/Obituary|website=Brusie Funeral Home|accessdate=7 April 2017|language=en|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170408082650/http://www.brusiefh.com/obituaries/Eva-Banathy-1216-2/#!/Obituary|archivedate=8 April 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hqmhbk.com/current.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110712224600/http://www.hqmhbk.com/current.html |archivedate=July 12, 2011|title=Current Events|last=Borbas|first=K.|translator=L.B.G.

In 1948, shortly after their third son Tibor was born, the Banathy family was moved to another camp, near a [[Marshall Plan]] warehouse. Bánáthy was assigned to unload sacks of wheat from railroad cars. He contacted the [[World Organization of the Scout Movement|World Scouting Movement]] for assistance and began to organize  [[scouting in displaced persons camps|scouting in the DP camps]]. During 1947, Bánáthy was named the Hungarian Scout Commissioner for Austria; he led training for Hungarian Scout leaders along with his former commanding officer Farkas.&lt;ref name=wshistory/&gt;  He was ordained by the [[World Council of Churches]] and became minister for youth among Hungarian refugees. Banathy served as director of religious education of the Protestant Refugee Service of Austria, was editor of a religious youth service and of a Scout publication.&lt;ref name=jenink /&gt;

In 1948 Bánáthy's fourth son Robert was born. Bánáthy soon found work as a [[Draughtsman|technical draftsman]] in the statistical office of a U.S. Army warehouse.&lt;ref name=jenink /&gt;&lt;ref name="herald"/&gt;&lt;ref name=vitae&gt;{{cite web | title = C.

Seven-year-old Béla and six-year-old László Banathy, along with their Pallendal grandmother and two aunts, were put aboard a freight train and sent toward Russia. The train stopped occasionally and a few hundred people were forced off at rural towns. The Pallendal family was ejected in eastern Hungary. There an uncle located them and hid them from authorities in a small village.{{cn|date=March 2017}}&lt;!--SEE NOTE AT "Saalfelden" ABVE.--&gt;

===Emigrates to the United States===
In January, 1951, the student body of the Presbyterian [[McCormick Theological Seminary]] in [[Chicago]] sponsored Béla, Eva, Tibor and Robert Banathy as [[refugees]] to the United States.&lt;ref name="herald"/&gt; Bánáthy lived with his family at the [[Seminary]], where he worked nights 60 hours a week shoveling coal to fire the Seminary furnace. At the same time, he was studying English from a book. He occasionally preached at nearby Hungarian churches. His wife found work as a machine operator and Tibor, their third son, entered [[American public schools|American public school]].&lt;ref name=evanaturalization&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ancestry.com/interactive/3998/005197229_01139?pid=3360730 |title=Petition for Naturalization, Number 122420 |publisher= Ancestry.com.

===Begins teaching Hungarian language===
When World War II ended, General Farkas was designated as the U.S. Army's liaison to former Hungarian [[prisoners of war]]. In 1951 he recommended Bánáthy as a [[Hungarian language]] instructor, and Bánáthy was invited to teach at the [[U.S. government]]'s [[Defense Language Institute|Army Language School]] in [[Monterey, California|Monterey]], [[California]].&lt;ref name=wshistory/&gt; Bánáthy moved to Monterey in June 1951, a pivotal change in his life. At the Army Language School, he met Joseph Szentkiralyi ([[Americanization (immigration)|Americanized]] as St. Clair), the founder of the Hungarian Department. They soon figured out they had met at the [[4th World Scout Jamboree]] in 1933. The wives of the two men also realized they had been girlhood friends in grammar school in Budapest.&lt;ref name="herald"/&gt; Using her  experience managing the Pallendal family restaurant in Budapest before World War II, Eva took work as a waitress in a restaurant on the Monterey Peninsula. Bánáthy served as President of his local [[Parent-Teacher Association]] and on the board of the local [[American Red Cross|Red Cross]].&lt;ref name=jenink /&gt; In the same year, Paul Ferenc Sujan, another former Hungarian scout, joined the language school faculty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Founders: "Uncle" Paul Sujan|url=http://www.whitestag.org/history/founders/bio_paul_sujan.html|website=www.whitestag.org|accessdate=7 April 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170321123850/http://www.whitestag.org/history/founders/bio_paul_sujan.html|archivedate=21 March 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After nine years of separation, and repeated failures to get his sons [[Repatriation|repatriated]] from behind the [[Iron Curtain]], Bánáthy obtained help from Dr. [[Eugene Blake]], President of the [[National Council of Churches]]; Representative [[Charles M. Teague]]; Ernest Nagy, Vice Consul in the U.S. Legation in Budapest; Hulda Neiburh of the McCormick Theological Seminary; and [[John Howard Pyle|Howard Pyle]], deputy assistant to President [[Dwight D.

== Professional life ==
Bánáthy was an educator, a systems and design scientist, and an author. At the [[Defense Language Institute|Army Language School]], he taught in the Hungarian language department, later becoming its chairman.

=== White Stag Leadership Development Program ===
{{Main article|White Stag Leadership Development Program}}

[[File:White stag founders 1968 fort ord.jpg|thumb|237px|Joe St. Clair, Fran Peterson, Maury Tripp, and Béla H. Bánáthy at the [[White Stag Leadership Development Program]] [[Indaba]] held at [[Fort Ord]], California, during November 1962. These four men, along with Paul Sujan, helped develop new [[National Youth Leadership Training|junior leader training]] and [[Wood Badge (Boy Scouts of America)|Wood Badge]] programs that for the first time focused on leadership skills, not [[Scoutcraft]] leadership skills.]]
In 1957 Bánáthy began enlarging a concept for a leadership development program. As Council Training Chairman in the [[Monterey Bay Area Council]] of the [[Boy Scouts of America]], he received strong support from the Council Executive and Council Executive Board for his proposal to train boys in leadership skills. He was assisted by fellow Hungarians Joe Szentkiralyi (aka St. Clair, Chair of the Hungarian Language Department at the Army Language school) and Paul Sujan (Hungarian Language Instructor at the Army Language school); Fran Peterson (a member of the National Council and a Scoutmaster from Chular, California); and Maury Tripp (a Scouter from Saratoga, California, a member of the National Council, and a research scientist).&lt;ref name=wshistory /&gt;{{third party inline|date=March 2017}} "Lord Baden-Powell was my personal idol and I long felt a commitment to give back to Scouting what I had received", Bánáthy said.&lt;ref name=herald&gt;{{cite news | title=Special Leadership Camps Held at Pico Blanco | author = Helene H. Parsons | publisher = Monterey Peninsula Herald | date = 1977-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of his [[master's degree]] program in counseling psychology at [[San José State University]], he wrote a thesis titled "A Design for Leadership Development in Scouting".&lt;ref name="a_design"&gt;{{cite book |title = A Design for Leadership Development in Scouting |author = Béla Bánáthy |publisher = Monterey Bay Area Council |year = 1963 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This book described the founding principles of the [[White Stag Leadership Development Program|White Stag program]], which was later adapted by the National Council of the [[Boy Scouts of America]].&lt;ref name="a_report"/&gt; Prior to Bánáthy's work, the adult [[Wood Badge]] and the [[National Youth Leadership Training|junior leader training]] programs had focused on teaching [[Scoutcraft]] skills and some aspects of the [[Scout method|Patrol Method]]. His research and findings on teaching principles and competencies of leadership had a huge impact on these two programs, shifting their focus to leadership skills.&lt;ref name=barnardhistory&gt;{{cite web |title=History of Wood Badge in the United States |url=http://www.woodbadge.org/history.html |year=2002 |author=Mike Barnard |work=Wood Badge.org |accessdate=April 6, 2017 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161206114428/http://www.woodbadge.org/history.html |archivedate=December 6, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bsawbhistory"&gt;{{cite book |title=A History of Wood Badge in the United States|asin=B0013ENRE8|publisher=Boy Scouts of America|year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some individuals on the national staff and many volunteers across the nation resisted the idea of changing the focus of Wood Badge from training leaders in Scoutcraft to leadership skills. Among them was [[William Hillcourt|William "Green Bar Bill" Hillcourt]], who had been the first United States Wood Badge Course Director in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Green Bar Bill Hillcourt's Impact on Wood Badge |url=http://www.woodbadge.org/hillcourt.html |year=2001 |author=Mike Barnard |work=Wood Badge.org |accessdate=March 18, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100316152939/http://www.woodbadge.org/hillcourt.html |archivedate=March 16, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although officially retired, he had many loyal followers. He was adamant that Wood Badge should continue to teach Scoutcraft skills and tried to persuade the national council to stick to that tradition, but his objections were ignored.&lt;ref name=wshistory/&gt;

The leadership competencies Banathy articulated became the ''[[de facto]]'' method for Scout adult and junior leader training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Troop Leader Development Staff Guide |publisher=Boy Scouts of America|year=1974|pages=94–95}}&lt;/ref&gt; (In 2008, the White Stag program celebrated its 50th anniversary.) In 1960, the Monterey Bay Area Council recognized Béla for his exceptional service to youth and awarded him the [[Silver Beaver]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jim|first=Himlyn|title=Image History of the Monterey Bay Area Council Silver Beaver Recipients|url=http://himlyn.com/mbac_history/silverbeaver.html|accessdate=11 September 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320224723/http://himlyn.com/mbac_history/silverbeaver.html|archivedate=20 March 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, due to the success of the White Stag program, Bánáthy was appointed to the [[Interamerican Scout Region (World Organization of the Scout Movement)|Interamerican Scout Committee]] and participated in three interamerican "Train the Trainer" events in [[Scouting in Mexico|Mexico]], [[Scouting in Costa Rica|Costa Rica]], and [[Scouting in Venezuela|Venezuela]].&lt;ref name=jenink /&gt; He guided their national training teams in designing leadership development by design programs. Béla also taught in [[Sunday School]] and was on the Board of the [[United Methodist Church]] of the Wayfarer in [[Carmel, California]].

===Systems science===

In the 1960s Bánáthy began teaching courses in [[applied linguistics]] and [[systems science]] at [[San José State University]]. In 1962 he was named Dean and Chairman of the East Europe and Middle East Division at the Army Language School, overseeing ten language departments. In 1963 he completed his master's degree in [[psychology]] at San Jose State University, and in 1966 he received a [[doctorate]] in [[education]] for a [[transdisciplinary]] program in education, systems theory, and linguistics from the [[University of California, Berkeley|University of California]] in Berkeley. During the mid-1960s Bánáthy was named Chair of Western Division of the [[International Society for the Systems Sciences|Society for General Systems Research]]. He published his first book, ''Instructional Systems,'' in 1968.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;&lt;ref name=jenink/&gt;

===Large complex systems===

During the 1960s and 1970s, Bánáthy was a visiting professor at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], and as he continued teaching at San Jose State University. In 1969, he left the renamed Defense Language Institute and became a Program Director, and later Senior Research Director and Associate Laboratory Director, at the [[Far West Laboratory for Educational Research and Development|Far West Laboratory for Research and Development]] (now [[WestEd]]) in Berkeley (later moved to San Francisco). He "directed over fifty research and development programs, designed many curriculum projects and several large scale [[complex system]]s, including the design and implementation of a Ph.D. program in educational research and development for [[University of California, Berkeley|UC Berkeley]]".&lt;ref name=ifsr/&gt;&lt;ref name=jenink/&gt;&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

In the 1970s and 1980s, he focused his research on the application of systems and design theories and methodologies in social, social service, educational, and human development systems. In the 1980s he developed and guided a Ph.D. curriculum in humanistic systems inquiry and social systems design for the [[Saybrook Graduate School]].&lt;ref name=ifsr/&gt;&lt;ref name=jenink/&gt;&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;

=== International Systems Institute ===

In 1981, he founded the International Systems Institute&lt;ref name="ISI"/&gt; (ISI), a non-profit, public benefit scientific and educational corporation in [[Carmel, California]], USA. He organized its first meeting at [[Fuschl am See]], [[Austria]] in 1982.&lt;ref name="ISI"/&gt;&lt;ref name=ifsr/&gt;

Banathy introduced a unique and never-before used approach to organizing the International Systems Institute conferences. Banathy observed that in traditional conferences, a few usually well-respected or prestigious individuals would apply to present "pre-packaged new ideas" to others. In typical conferences, presenting almost always carries more prestige than listening; the few presenters share their wisdom with the many. This one-to-many or "hierarchical knowledge distribution system" slowed the sharing and spreading of ideas about which many people cared deeply if not passionately, as there was always limited opportunity for interchange among participants. This interaction was usually wedged into the interstices of the formal schedule in the form of informal, spontaneous gatherings for which no record existed.&lt;ref name="ISI"/&gt;

The notion that presenting is more important than listening aroused lifelong antipathy in Bánáthy. When he formulated the leadership competencies of the [[White Stag Leadership Development Program]] in the 1960s, he described the passing of knowledge from one to another as "Manager of Learning". He wrote extensively about how the focus should be on the learner, not the teacher.&lt;ref name="a_report"&gt;{{cite book | title = Report on a Leadership Development Experiment| author = Béla Banathy| publisher = Monterey Bay Area Council | year = 1964}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bánáthy advanced a different vision for conferences, one that would allow everyone to fully engage. He proposed that everyone be given the opportunity to prepare and distribute papers to all participants in advance of the conference. And instead of listening to speeches, conference attendees took part in extended, non-hierarchical conversations about the conference papers. The conference proceedings were the result of these conversations.  Bánáthy felt strongly that systems scholars from all over the world should be given ongoing opportunities to engage in extended conversations so they might put their expertise "actively into the service of humanity worldwide".&lt;ref name="ISI"/&gt;

Bánáthy wrote: "We aspire to reap the 'reflecting and creating power' of groups that emerge in the course of disciplined and focused conversations on issues that are important to us and to our society". Participants at International Systems Institute gatherings have, since the original meeting organized by Bánáthy in 1982, organized them around this principle and referred to them as "conversations".&lt;ref name="ISI"/&gt;

===General Evolutionary Research Group===
In 1984, Bánáthy was co-founder with general evolution theorist [[Ervin László]] and others of the initially secret General Evolutionary Research Group, or General Evolutionary Research Group.&lt;ref name="GERG" /&gt; A member of the [[International Society for the Systems Sciences|Society of General Systems Research]] since the 1960s, he was Managing Director of the Society in the early 1980s, and in 1985 he became its president.&lt;ref name="ISI"/&gt; He then served on its Board of Trustees. During the 1980s, he served on the Executive Committee of the [[International Federation of Systems Research]].&lt;ref name="GERG" /&gt; In 1989, he retired from Far West Labs and returned to live on the Monterey Peninsula. He continued to serve as Professor Emeritus for the Saybrook Graduate School, counseling Ph.D. students. He also continued his work with the annual ISI international systems design conversations, and authored a number of articles and books about systems, design, and evolutionary research. He served two terms as president of the International Federation of Systems Research during 1994-98.&lt;ref name=jenink /&gt;

He coordinated over twenty international systems research conferences held in eight countries, including the 1994 Conversation on Systems Design conversation held at Fuschl Am See, Austria, sponsored by the International Federation of Systems Research.&lt;ref name=ifsr/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.ifsr.org/node/33 Fuschl Conversations] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081017153101/http://www.ifsr.org/node/33 |date=2008-10-17 }}." ''[[International Federation for Systems Research]].'' November 25, 2007.

==Final years==

In 1992, Bánáthy, a long-standing member of the Hungarian Scout Association Abroad ([[Külföldi Magyar Cserkészszövetség]]), traveled from his [[Monterey, California]] home in the United States to Hungary following its renewed freedom. There, he helped restart the Hungarian Scout Association within his native country.&lt;ref name=wshistory&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.whitestag.org/history/history.html |title=White Stag History Since 1933 |first1=Joe |last1=St. Clair |first2=Alan |last2=Miyamoto |first33=Fran |last3=Peterson |accessdate=2008-10-22 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080920115949/http://www.whitestag.org/history/history.html |archivedate=2008-09-20 |df= }}{{third party inline|date=March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{third party inline|date=March 2017}}

Bánáthy spent considerable time during the last few years of his life caring for his wife Eva in their home in [[Carmel, California]]. She had been in poor health for a number of years after a stroke. In the summer of 2003 Bánáthy and his wife moved to live with their son Tibor in [[Chico, California]]. After a brief and unexpected illness, Bánáthy died on September 4, 2003. He and Eva had been married 64 years at the time of his death.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;&lt;!--THIS OBIT APPEARS FINE, AS IT IS A REPRINT OF AN INDEPENDENTLY PUBLISHED NEWS ARTICLE.--&gt;

'''Canadian Gaelic''' or '''Cape Breton Gaelic''' ({{lang-gd|Gàidhlig Chanada, A' Ghàidhlig Chanadach or Gàidhlig Cheap Bhreatainn}}), known in English as often simply '''Gaelic''', is the dialects of [[Scottish Gaelic]] spoken by people in [[Atlantic Canada]] who have their origins in the [[Highlands and Islands]] of [[Scotland]].

While there have been many different regional dialects of [[Scottish Gaelic]] that have been spoken in communities across [[Canada]], [[Atlantic Canada]] is the only area in North America where Gaelic continues to be spoken as a community language, especially in [[Cape Breton]]. All of these dialects had their origins in the [[Highlands and Islands]] of [[Scotland]], although some have become effectively dormant since the time of emigration. Even in Cape Breton, the situation of the language is precarious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=McEwan-Fujita |first=Emily |editor-last=Newton |editor-first=Michael |title=Celts in the Americas |publisher=Cape Breton University Press |date=2013 |pages=160–186 |chapter=Gaelic Revitalization Efforts in Nova Scotia |isbn=978-1-897009-75-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scottish Gaels settled in Nova Scotia commencing in 1773 with the arrival of the Ship Hector and continuing up until the 1850s.  Gaelic has been spoken for 241 years in [[Nova Scotia]]: on [[Cape Breton Island]] and on the northeastern Nova Scotia mainland. During the early 1900s, the Gaelic language was nearly wiped out in Canadian schools.

The Gaelic cultural identity community is a vibrant part of Nova Scotia's diverse peoples and communities. Thousands of Nova Scotians attend Gaelic-related activities and events annually including: language workshops and immersions, milling frolics, square dances, fiddle and piping sessions, concerts and festivals. Up until about the turn of the 20th century, Gaelic was widely spoken on eastern [[Prince Edward Island]] (PEI). In the 2011 Canadian Census, 10 individuals in PEI cited that their mother tongue was a Gaelic language, with over 90 claiming to speak a Gaelic language.

[[Gaels]], their language and culture have influenced the heritage of [[Glengarry County, Ontario|Glengarry County]] and other regions in present-day [[Ontario]], where many [[Scottish Highlands|Highland Scots]] settled commencing in the 18th century, and to a much lesser extent the provinces of [[New Brunswick]], [[Newfoundland and Labrador]] (especially the [[Codroy Valley]]), [[Manitoba]] and [[Alberta]]. Gaelic-speaking poets in communities across Canada have produced a large and significant branch of Gaelic literature comparable to that of Scotland itself.&lt;ref name="seanchaidh"&gt;{{cite book |last=Newton |first=Michael |authorlink=Michael Newton (Gaelic scholar) |date=2015 |title=Seanchaidh na Coille / Memory-Keeper of the Forest: Anthology of Scottish Gaelic Literature of Canada |publisher=Cape Breton University Press |isbn=978-1-77206-016-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having its origins in Scotland, the Scottish Gaelic language is similar to, but should not be confused with, the [[Irish language in Newfoundland]].

At its peak in the mid-19th century, Scottish Gaelic, considered together with the closely related Newfoundland Irish, was the third most spoken language in Canada after [[Canadian English|English]] and [[French in Canada|French]].&lt;ref name="scots"&gt;{{cite web |last=Bumstead |first=J.M |year=2006 |title=Scots |url=http://multiculturalcanada.ca/Encyclopedia/A-Z/s2/12 |publisher=Multicultural Canada |accessdate=2006-08-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121226073110/http://www.multiculturalcanada.ca/Encyclopedia/A-Z/s2/12 |archivedate=2012-12-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Atlantic Canada]] today, there are currently approximately 2,000 speakers, mainly in Nova Scotia.&lt;ref name="ethnologue.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gaelic.novascotia.ca"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/nhs-enm/2011/dp-pd/prof/index.cfm?Lang=E Statistics Canada, NHS Profile 2011], by province.&lt;/ref&gt; In terms of the total number of speakers in the 2011 census, there were 7,195 total speakers of "Gaelic languages" in Canada, with 1,365 in [[Nova Scotia]] and [[Prince Edward Island]] where the responses mainly refer to Scottish Gaelic.&lt;ref name="2011census"&gt;[http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/nhs-enm/2011/dp-pd/prof/details/page.cfm?Lang=E&amp;Geo1=PR&amp;Code1=12&amp;Data=Count&amp;SearchText=Canada&amp;SearchType=Begins&amp;SearchPR=01&amp;A1=Non-official%20language&amp;B1=All&amp;Custom= Statistics Canada, 2011 NHS Survey]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://gaelic.novascotia.ca/community Our Community - Gaelic Affairs, Nova Scotia/Alba Nuadh]&lt;/ref&gt; The 2011 census also reported that over 300 residents of Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island considered a Gaelic language to be their "mother tongue".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2011/dp-pd/tbt-tt/Rp-eng.cfm?TABID=2&amp;LANG=E&amp;APATH=3&amp;DETAIL=0&amp;DIM=0&amp;FL=A&amp;FREE=0&amp;GC=0&amp;GID=906560&amp;GK=0&amp;GRP=1&amp;PID=103251&amp;PRID=0&amp;PTYPE=101955&amp;S=0&amp;SHOWALL=0&amp;SUB=0&amp;Temporal=2011&amp;THEME=90&amp;VID=0&amp;VNAMEE=&amp;VNAMEF=&amp;D1=0&amp;D2=0&amp;D3=0&amp;D4=0&amp;D5=0&amp;D6=0 Statistics Canada, 2011 Census of Canada, Table: Detailed mother tongue]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{further|Scottish Gaelic#History}}

===Arrival of earliest Gaels===
In 1621, [[James I of England|King James VI of Scotland]] allowed [[privateer]] [[William Alexander (the younger)|William Alexander]] to establish the first [[Scottish colonisation of the Americas|Scottish colony overseas]]. The group of [[Scottish Highlands|Highlanders]] – all of whom were Gaelic-speaking – settled at what is presently known as [[Port Royal, Annapolis County, Nova Scotia|Port Royal]], on the western shore of Nova Scotia.

Within a year the colony had failed. Subsequent attempts to relaunch it were cancelled when in 1631 the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1632)|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye]] returned Nova Scotia to [[France|French]] rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Griffiths |first=N.E.S. |author2=John G. Reid |date=July 1992 |title=New Evidence on New Scotland, 1629 |jstor=2947108 |work=The William and Mary Quarterly |volume=49 |issue=3 |pages=492–508 |publisher=Omohundro Institute of Early American History and Culture |accessdate=|registration=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost a half-century later, in 1670, the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] was given exclusive [[fur trade|trading]] rights to all [[North America]]n lands draining into [[Hudson Bay]] – about 3.9&amp;nbsp;million&amp;nbsp;km² (1.5&amp;nbsp;million&amp;nbsp;sq&amp;nbsp;mi – an area larger than India). Many of the traders who came in the later 18th and 19th centuries were Gaelic speakers from the Scottish Highlands who brought their language to the interior.

Those who intermarried with the local [[First Nations]] people passed on their language, with the effect that by the mid-18th century there existed a sizeable population of {{lang|fr|[[Anglo-Metis|Métis]]}} traders with Scottish and aboriginal ancestry, and command of spoken Gaelic.&lt;ref name="metis"&gt;{{cite web|last=Dickason |first=Olive P |year=2006 |title=Métis |url=http://www.multiculturalcanada.ca/mcc/ecp/content/aboriginals_metis.html |publisher=Multicultural Canada |accessdate=2006-08-30 |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20061105071907/http://www.multiculturalcanada.ca/mcc/ecp/content/aboriginals_metis.html |archivedate=2006-11-05 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gaels in 18th- and 19th-century settlements===
Cape Breton remained the property of France until 1758 (although mainland Nova Scotia had belonged to Britain since 1713) when [[Fortress Louisbourg]] fell to the British, followed by the rest of [[New France]] in the ensuing [[Battle of the Plains of Abraham|Battle at the {{lang|fr|Plaines d'Abraham|nocat=y}}]]. As a result of the conflict [[The Highlanders (military)|Highland regiments]] who fought for the [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] secured a reputation for tenacity and combat prowess.&lt;ref name="scots" /&gt; In turn the countryside itself secured a reputation among the Highlanders for its size, beauty, and wealth of natural resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=unknown |year=2003 |title=Bras d'Or Lake |url=http://www.greatcanadianlakes.com/nova_scotia/brasdor/his_page5.htm |publisher=Canoe Network |accessdate=2006-08-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061108104703/http://www.greatcanadianlakes.com/nova_scotia/brasdor/his_page5.htm |archive-date=2006-11-08 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

They would remember Canada when in 1762 the earliest of the {{lang|gd|Fuadach nan Gàidheal}} ([[Highland Clearances|Scottish Highland Clearances]]) forced many Gaelic families off their ancestral lands. The first ship loaded with [[Hebridean]] colonists arrived on "St.-John's Island" (Prince Edward Island) in 1770, with later ships following in 1772, and 1774.&lt;ref name="scots" /&gt; In September 1773 a ship named ''The Hector'' landed in [[Pictou]], Nova Scotia, with 189 settlers who departed from [[Loch Broom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shiphector.com|title=Hector Heritage Quay|first=|date=|year=2016|website=|publisher=''Hector Heritage Quay''|author=|accessdate=2017-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1784 the last barrier to Scottish settlement – a law restricting land-ownership on Cape Breton Island – was repealed, and soon both PEI and Nova Scotia were predominantly Gaelic-speaking.&lt;ref name="study"&gt;{{cite web |last=Kennedy |first=Michael |year=2002 |title=Gaelic Economic-impact Study |url=http://museum.gov.ns.ca/pubs/Gaelic-Report.pdf |publisher=Nova Scotia Museum |accessdate=2006-08-30 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060828100950/http://museum.gov.ns.ca/pubs/Gaelic-Report.pdf |archivedate=2006-08-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated more than 50,000 Gaelic settlers immigrated to Nova Scotia and Cape Breton Island between 1815 and 1870.&lt;ref name="scots" /&gt;

With the end of the [[American War of Independence]], immigrants newly arrived from Scotland would soon be joined by [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]] emigrants escaping persecution from [[United States|American]] [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Partisans]]. These settlers arrived on a mass scale at the arable lands of [[British North America]], with large numbers settling in [[Glengarry County, Ontario|Glengarry County]] in present-day Ontario, and in the [[Eastern Townships]] of [[Quebec]].&lt;ref name="scots" /&gt;

===Red River colony===
In 1812, [[Thomas Douglas, 5th Earl of Selkirk]] obtained {{convert|300000|km2}} to build a [[Red River Colony|colony]] at the forks of the [[Red River of the North|Red River]], in what would become [[Manitoba]]. With the help of his employee and friend, [[Archibald McDonald]], Selkirk sent over 70 Scottish settlers, many of whom spoke only Gaelic, and had them establish a small farming colony there. The settlement soon attracted local [[First Nation]]s groups, resulting in an unprecedented interaction of Scottish ([[Lowland]], [[Scottish Highlands|Highland]], and [[Orkney|Orcadian]]), [[English people|English]], [[Cree]], [[French people|French]], [[Ojibwe]], [[Saulteaux]], and [[Métis people (Canada)|Métis]] traditions all in close contact.&lt;ref name="selkirk"&gt;{{cite web |author=J. M. Bumsted |year=2006 |title=Red River Colony |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/en/article/red-river-colony/ |work=The Canadian Encyclopædia |accessdate=2006-08-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1840s, Toronto [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] priest John Black was sent to preach to the settlement, but "his lack of the Gaelic was at first a grievous disappointment" to parishioners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Henderson |first=Anne Matheson |year=1968 |title=The Lord Selkirk Settlement at Red River |url=http://www.mhs.mb.ca/docs/pageant/13/selkirksettlement3.shtml |publisher=The Manitoba Historical Society |accessdate=2006-08-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With continuing immigration the population of Scots colonists grew to more than 300, but by the 1860s the French-Métis outnumbered the Scots, and tensions between the two groups would prove a major factor in the ensuing [[Red River Rebellion]].&lt;ref name="metis" /&gt;

The continuing association between the Selkirk colonists and surrounding [[First Nations]] groups evolved into a unique [[contact language]]. Used primarily by the [[Anglo-Metis|Anglo-]] and Scots-Métis traders, the "[[Bungee language|Red River Dialect]]" or ''Bungee'' was a mixture of Gaelic and English with many terms borrowed from the local native languages. Whether the dialect was a trade [[pidgin]] or a fully developed [[mixed language]] is unknown. Today the Scots-Métis have largely been absorbed by the more dominant French-Métis culture, and the Bungee dialect is most likely [[language death|extinct]].

===Status in the 19th century===
By 1850, Gaelic was the third most-common [[mother tongue]] in [[British North America]] after [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]] (when excluding Indigenous languages), and is believed to have been spoken by more than 200,000 British North Americans at that time.&lt;ref name="study" /&gt; A large population who spoke the related [[Newfoundland Irish|Irish Gaelic]] immigrated to Scots Gaelic communities and to [[Irish people|Irish]] settlements in [[Colony of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]].

In Prince Edward Island, [[Cape Breton Island|Cape Breton]] and Glengarry there were large areas of Gaelic monolingualism,&lt;ref name="study" /&gt; and communities of Gaelic-speakers had established themselves in northeastern Nova Scotia (around Pictou and [[Antigonish]]); in Glengarry, Stormont, Grey, and Bruce Counties in Ontario; in the [[Codroy Valley]] of Newfoundland; in [[Winnipeg, Manitoba]]; and [[Eastern Townships|Eastern Quebec]].&lt;ref name="scots" /&gt;&lt;ref name="seanchaidh"/&gt;{{rp|371–387}}

In 1890, [[Thomas Robert McInnes]], an independent [[Senate of Canada|Senator]] from [[British Columbia]] (born [[Lake Ainslie]], Cape Breton Island) tabled a bill entitled "An Act to Provide for the Use of Gaelic in Official Proceedings."&lt;ref name="study" /&gt;&lt;ref name="seanchaidh"/&gt;{{rp|487–493}} He cited the ten Scottish and eight Irish senators who spoke Gaelic, and 32 members of the [[House of Commons of Canada]] who spoke either Scottish or Irish Gaelic. The bill was defeated 42–7.&lt;ref name="scots" /&gt;

Despite the widespread disregard by government on Gaelic issues, records exist of at least one criminal trial conducted entirely in Gaelic, {{circa|1880}}.

==Reasons for decline==
Despite the long history of Gaels and their language and culture in Canada, the Gaelic speech population started to decline after 1850. This drop was a result of [[prejudice]] (both from outside, and from within the Gaelic community itself), aggressive dissuasion in school and government, and the perceived [[prestige (sociolinguistics)|prestige]] of English.

Gaelic has faced widespread prejudice in [[Great Britain]] for generations, and those feelings were easily transposed to [[British North America]].&lt;ref name="learn"&gt;{{cite web |last=Newton |first=Michael |year=2004 |title="This Could Have Been Mine": Scottish Gaelic Learners in North America |url=http://www.uwm.edu/Dept/celtic/ekeltoi/volumes/vol1/1_1/newton_1_1.html |publisher=''Center for Celtic Studies, University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee'' |accessdate=2006-10-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1868, the ''Scottish-American Journal'' mockingly reported that "the preliminary indispensables for acquiring Gaelic are: swallowing a neat assortment of nutmeal-graters, catching a chronic bronchitis, having one nostril hermetically sealed up, and submitting to a dislocation of the jaw".&lt;ref name="learn" /&gt;

That Gaelic had not received official status in its homeland made it easier for Canadian legislators to disregard the concerns of domestic speakers. Legislators questioned why "privileges should be asked for Highland Scotchmen in [the Canadian Parliament] that are not asked for in their own country?".&lt;ref name="study" /&gt; Politicians who themselves spoke the language held opinions that would today be considered misinformed; [[Lunenburg, Nova Scotia|Lunenburg]] Senator Henry A.&amp;nbsp;N. Kaulbach, in response to [[Thomas Robert McInnes]]'s Gaelic bill, described the language as only "well suited to poetry and fairy tales".&lt;ref name="study" /&gt; The belief that certain languages had inherent strengths and weaknesses was typical in the 19th century, but has been rejected by modern [[linguistics]].

Around 1880, {{lang|gd|Am Bàrd Mac Dhiarmaid}} from [[Inverness County, Nova Scotia|The North Shore]], wrote [https://www.mun.ca/folklore/leach/songs/CB/8-03.htm {{lang|gd|An Té a Chaill a' Ghàidhlig|nocat=y}} (The Woman who Lost her Gaelic)], a humorous song recounting the growing phenomenon of Gaels shunning their [[mother-tongue]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=unknown |year=2001 |title=MacEdward Leach and the Songs of Atlantic Canada |url=https://www.mun.ca/folklore/leach/songs/index.html |publisher=Memorial University of St John's, Nfld. |accessdate=2006-09-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the outbreak of [[World War II]] the Canadian government attempted to prevent the use of Gaelic on public telecommunications systems. The government believed Gaelic was used by subversives affiliated with Ireland, a neutral country perceived to be tolerant of the [[Nazi Germany|Nazis]].&lt;ref name="scots" /&gt; In Prince Edward Island and Cape Breton where the Gaelic language was strongest, it was actively discouraged in schools with [[corporal punishment]]. Children were beaten with the {{lang|gd|maide-crochaidh}} ("hanging stick") if caught speaking Gaelic.&lt;ref name="study" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Irish Passport"&gt;{{cite podcast |first1=Tim |last1=McInerny |first2=Naomi |last2=O'Leary |edition=3 |work=The Irish Passport |title=The Irish Language |publisher=[[SoundCloud]] |url=https://soundcloud.com/user-239107869-534543383/episode-3-the-irish-language |date=14 June 2017 |time=35:30 |accessdate=5 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Job opportunities for monolingual Gaels were few and restricted to the dwindling Gaelic-communities, compelling most into the [[mining|mines]] or the [[fishery]]. Many saw English fluency as the key to success, and for the first time in Canadian history Gaelic-speaking parents were teaching their children to speak English en masse. The sudden stop of Gaelic [[intergenerational transmission]], caused by shame and prejudice, was the immediate cause of the drastic decline in Gaelic fluency in the 20th century.&lt;ref name="study"/&gt;

Ultimately the population dropped from a peak of 200,000 in 1850, to 80,000 in 1900, to 30,000 in 1930 and 500–1,000 today.&lt;ref name="scots"/&gt; There are no longer entire communities of Canadian Gaelic-speakers, although traces of the language and pockets of speakers are relatively commonplace on Cape Breton, and especially in traditional strongholds like [[Christmas Island, Nova Scotia|Christmas Island]], [[Inverness County, Nova Scotia|The North Shore]], and [[Baddeck]].

==Contemporary language, culture and arts initiatives==
[[File:Benacadie Glen.jpg|thumb|[[Bilingual sign]], Cape Breton, Nova Scotia]]
A.&amp;nbsp;W.&amp;nbsp;R. MacKenzie founded the [[Nova Scotia Gaelic College]] at [[St. Ann's, Nova Scotia|St Ann's]] in 1939. [[St. Francis Xavier University|St Francis Xavier University]] in [[Antigonish, Nova Scotia|Antigonish]] has a Celtic Studies department with Gaelic-speaking faculty members, and is the only such university department outside [[Scotland]] to offer four full years of Scottish Gaelic instruction.&lt;ref name="study" /&gt;

Many English-speaking artists of Canadian Gaelic heritage have featured Canadian Gaelic in their works, among them [[Alistair MacLeod]] (''[[No Great Mischief]]''), [[Ann-Marie MacDonald]] (''[[Fall on Your Knees]]''), and D.R. MacDonald (''Cape Breton Road''). Gaelic singer [[Mary Jane Lamond]] has released several albums in the language, including the 1997 hit {{lang|gd|Hòro Ghoid thu Nighean}}, ("Jenny Dang the Weaver"). [[Cape Breton fiddling]] is a unique tradition of Gaelic and [[Acadia]]n styles, known in fiddling circles worldwide.

Several Canadian schools use the "Gael" as a mascot, the most prominent being [[Queen's University]] in [[Kingston, Ontario]]. The school cheer of Queen's University is {{lang|gd|[[Oil Thigh|"Oilthigh na Bànrighinn a' Bhànrighinn gu bràth!"]]}} ("The College of the Queen forever!"), and is traditionally sung after scoring a touchdown in [[Canadian football|football]] matches. The university's team is nicknamed the [[Queen's Golden Gaels|Golden Gaels]].

The Gaelic character of Nova Scotia has influenced that province's industry and traditions. [[Glen Breton Rare]], produced in Cape Breton, is one of the very few [[single malt whiskies]] to be made outside Scotland. Gaelic settlers in [[Windsor, Nova Scotia|Windsor]] adapted the popular Gaelic sport [[shinty]] (shinny) to be played on ice wearing skates, the precursor to modern [[ice hockey]]{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}.

The first Gaelic language film to be made in North America, {{lang|gd|[http://wakeofcalummacleod.ca/about_film.php Faire Chaluim MhicLeòid]}} ("The Wake of Calum MacLeod") is a six-minute short filmed in Cape Breton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=unknown |year=2006 |title=N.S.

==Outlook and development==

Efforts to address the decline specifically of Gaelic language in Nova Scotia began in the late 1980s.  Two conferences on the status of Gaelic language and culture held on Cape Breton Island set the stage.  Starting in the late 1990s, the Nova Scotia government began studying ways it might enhance Gaelic in the province.
  
In December 2006 the Office of Gaelic Affairs was established.

In [[Prince Edward Island]], the Colonel Gray High School now offers both an introductory and an advanced course in Gaelic; both language and history are taught in these classes. This is the first recorded time that Gaelic has ever been taught as an official course on Prince Edward Island.

Maxville Public School in [[Maxville, Ontario|Maxville]], [[Glengarry County, Ontario|Glengarry]], [[Ontario]], Canada offers Scottish Gaelic lessons weekly.  The last "fluent" Gaelic-speaker in Ontario, descended from the original settlers of [[Glengarry County, Ontario|Glengarry County]], died in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=McDonald |first=Rod |year=2001 |title=Alec McDonald |url=http://www.electricscotland.com/history/canada/mcdonald_alec.htm |work=Electric Scotland |accessdate=2006-04-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The province of [[British Columbia]] is host to the {{lang|gd|Comunn Gàidhlig Bhancoubhair}} (The Gaelic Society of Vancouver), the Vancouver Gaelic Choir, the Victoria Gaelic Choir, as well as the annual Gaelic festival ''{{lang|gd|Mòd}} Vancouver''. The city of [[Vancouver]]'s Scottish Cultural Centre also holds seasonal Scottish Gaelic evening classes.

===Government===
A [https://web.archive.org/web/20060828100950/http://museum.gov.ns.ca/pubs/Gaelic-Report.pdf Gaelic Economic-impact Study] completed by the Nova Scotia government in 2002 estimates that Gaelic generates over $23.5 million annually, with nearly 380,000 people attending approximately 2,070 Gaelic events annually. This study inspired a subsequent report, The [http://www.gov.ns.ca/dtc/pubs/GaelicStrategy-English.pdf Gaelic Preservation Strategy], which polled the community's desire to preserve Gaelic while seeking consensus on adequate reparative measures.

These two documents are watersheds in the timeline of Canadian Gaelic, representing the first concrete steps taken by a provincial government to recognize the language's decline and engage local speakers in reversing this trend. The documents recommend [[community development]], strengthening [[education]], legislating [[road signs]] and publications, and building ties between the Gaelic community and other Nova Scotia "heritage language" communities [[Mi'kmaq]], [[Acadian French]] and [[African Nova Scotian]].

Increased ties were called for between Nova Scotia and Scotland, and the first such agreement, the ''Memorandum of Understanding'', was signed in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |year=2002 |title=Memorandum of Understanding |url=http://www.gov.ns.ca/dtc/culture/culture_gaelic_memorandum.asp |publisher=Nova Scotia Department of Tourism, Culture &amp; Heritage |accessdate=2006-10-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050324155032/http://www.gov.ns.ca/dtc/culture/culture_gaelic_memorandum.asp |archivedate=March 24, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
Today over a dozen public institutions offer Gaelic courses, (such as a Canadian History course in Gaelic at North Nova Education Centre, Nova Scotia) in addition to advanced programmes conducted at Cape Breton, [[St. Francis Xavier University|St Francis Xavier]], and [[Saint Mary's University (Halifax)|Saint Mary's]] Universities.

The Nova Scotia Highland Village offers a bilingual interpretation site, presenting Gaelic and English interpretation for visitors and offering programmes for the local community members and the general public.

[[The Gaelic College]] in [[St. Anns, Nova Scotia|St. Anns]] offers Gaelic immersion weekends, weeks and summer programs.

Sponsored by local Gaelic organizations and societies, ongoing Gaelic language adult immersion classes involving hundreds of individuals are held in over a dozen communities in the province. These immersion programs focus on learning language through activity, props and repetition. Reading, writing and grammar are introduced after the student has had a minimum amount of exposure to hearing and speaking Gaelic through everyday contextualized activities. The grouping of immersion methodologies and exposure to Gaelic cultural expression in immersion settings is referred to in Nova Scotia as {{lang|gd|Gàidhlig aig Baile}}.

==Linguistic features==
{{further|Scottish Gaelic#Pronunciation|l1=Linguistic features of Gaelic}}

The [[phonology]] of some Canadian Gaelic dialects have diverged in several ways from the standard Gaelic spoken in Scotland, while others have remained the same.&lt;ref name="phon"&gt;{{cite web |last=MacAulay |first=Donald |author2=J. Gleasure |author3=C. Ó Baoill  |year=1996 |title=Festschrift for Professor D.S. Thomson |url=http://www.celt.dias.ie/publications/celtica/c24/c24-306-330.pdf |publisher=Scottish Gaelic Studies 17, University of Aberdeen |accessdate=2006-09-12 |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gaelic terms unique to Canada exist, though research on the exact number is deficient. The language has also had a considerable effect on [[Cape Breton English]].

===Phonology===
*&lt;span style="font-style:larger"&gt;'''{{IPA|l̪ˠ}} → {{IPA|w}}'''&lt;/span&gt;
**The most common Canadian Gaelic [[shibboleth]], where [[dark l|broad {{IPA|/l̪ˠ/}}]] is pronounced as {{IPA|[w]}} (as with [[Ł]] in [[Polish language|Polish]]). This form was well known in Western Scotland where it was called the {{lang|gd|glug Eigeach}} ("Eigg cluck"), for its putative use among speakers from the [[Eigg|Isle of Eigg]].&lt;ref name="phon" /&gt;
*&lt;span style="font-style:larger"&gt;'''{{IPA|n̪ˠ}} → {{IPA|m}}'''&lt;/span&gt;
**When {{IPA|/n̪ˠ/}} occurs after a [[roundedness|rounded]] vowel, speakers tend to pronounce it as {{IPA|[m]}}.&lt;ref name="phon" /&gt;
*&lt;span style="font-style:larger"&gt;'''{{IPA|n̪ˠ}} → {{IPA|w}}'''&lt;/span&gt;
**This form is limited mostly to the plural [[ending (linguistics)|ending]] {{lang|gd|-annan}}, where the {{lang|gd|-nn-}} sequence is pronounced as {{IPA|[w]}}.&lt;ref name="phon" /&gt;
*&lt;span style="font-style:larger"&gt;'''{{IPA|r}} → {{IPA|ʃ}}'''&lt;/span&gt;
**This change occurs frequently in many Scotland dialects when "r" is realized next to specific consonants; however such conditions are not necessary in Canadian Gaelic, where "r" is pronounced {{IPA|[ʃ]}} regardless of surrounding sounds.&lt;ref name="phon" /&gt;

'''''Cannon Spike''''', originally released in Japan as {{nihongo|'''''Gunspike'''''|ガンスパイク}}, is a [[Shoot 'em up#Multidirectional shooter|multi-directional shooter]] arcade game released in 2000 by [[Psikyo]] and later in the same year for the [[Dreamcast]] by [[Capcom]]. It uses Capcom-designed characters and runs on Sega's Naomi Hardware. ''Cannon Spike'' is similar to games like ''[[Smash TV]]'' and Capcom's ''[[Commando (video game)|Commando]]'', although with primary focus on boss fighting. ''Cannon Spike'' is noted as one of the last games released for [[Dreamcast]] in Europe, published by [[Bigben Interactive]] and exclusively sold at retail in [[Game (retailer)|Game]] outlets.

The international name of ''Cannon Spike'' is the name of a trademark attack performed by [[Cammy]], a character from the ''[[Street Fighter]]'' series of video games and one of the protagonists of this title.

==Characters==
The game's playable characters, which come from a range of Capcom games, include:
*[[Arthur (Ghosts 'n Goblins)|Arthur]] from ''[[Ghosts 'n Goblins]]''
*[[Baby Bonnie Hood]] (or Bulleta in Japan) from ''[[Darkstalkers]]'' (hidden character)
*[[Cammy]] from the ''[[Street Fighter II]]'' series
*[[Charlie (Street Fighter)|Charlie]] (or Nash in Japan) from the ''[[Street Fighter Alpha]]'' series
*[[Mega Man (character)|Mega Man]] (or Rockman in Japan) from the ''[[Mega Man]]'' series (hidden character)
*Shiba Shintaro from ''[[Three Wonders]]''

One other character, Simone, was made specifically for the game and has not been featured in any game since. Simone shares a few similarities with another Capcom character, Linn Kurosawa, from ''[[Alien vs. Predator (arcade game)|Alien vs. Predator]]''. [[Vega (Street Fighter)|Vega]] appears as an enemy character, named ''Fallen Balrog'' or ''Revenger Balrog'' in all regions.

== Gameplay ==
In its arcade incarnation, the game is played using a joystick and three buttons; Mark (used to lock onto a targeted enemy), Shoot, and Attack (a close-range strike, usually more powerful or with greater knock-back compared to ordinary shooting.) In addition to these basic commands, each character also has a ranged special attack (unleashed by pressing Shoot and Attack simultaneously), a close-range special (Mark and Attack simultaneously), and a super special (all three buttons simultaneously). The use of the super special requires a Special Token, occasionally dropped by a defeated enemy and always dropped by a defeated ally in 2-player mode.

==Reception==
{{Video game reviews
|GR=69.69
|EGM=6.16/10
|GSpot=7.8/10&lt;ref&gt;https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/cannon-spike-review/1900-2653212/&lt;/ref&gt;
|IGN=8.8/10&lt;ref&gt;http://uk.ign.com/articles/2000/11/17/cannon-spike&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

On release, ''[[Famitsu]]'' magazine scored the Dreamcast version of the game a 30 out of 40.&lt;ref&gt;''ドリームキャスト - ガンスパイク''. Weekly Famitsu. No.915 Pt.2. Pg.52. 30 June 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The game holds a 69.69% score at [[GameRankings]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gamerankings.com/dreamcast/913914-cannon-spike/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''concert aria''' is normally a free-standing [[aria]] or opera-like scene (''scena'') composed for singer and orchestra, written specifically for performance in concert rather than as part of an [[opera]]. Concert arias have usually been composed for particular singers, the composer always bearing that singer's voice and skill in mind when composing the work.

Apart from only denoting loose arias for singer and orchestra, the term is also used to indicate arias which were specifically composed for insertion into already-existing operas, either as additions to the score or as substitutions for other arias. These are sometimes performed in concerts because they are no longer required for their original purpose, though they were not, strictly speaking, composed for performance in concert.

The concert arias which are most commonly performed today were written by [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart]], but there are many examples by other composers, such as:
*''Son qual nave ch'agitata'' by [[Riccardo Broschi]] (written for the famous [[castrato]] [[Farinelli]])
*''Ermina'' by [[Juan Crisóstomo Arriaga|Juan Arriaga]] &lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Garrett|2011|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Ah! perfido]]'' by [[Ludwig van Beethoven]]
*''[[Der Wein]]'' for [[soprano]] and orchestra by [[Alban Berg]]
*''Scena di Berenice'' by [[Joseph Haydn]]
*''Infelice!'' by [[Felix Mendelssohn]]&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Garrett|2011|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mozart concert arias ==
{{main|List of concert arias, songs and canons by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart}}

Among the more well-known of Mozart's concert arias are:

*''[[Popoli di Tessaglia!]]'', K. 316, for soprano, with its two famous G6s (i.e., the G above high C, or 1568 Hz by modern [[concert pitch]] - according to the [[Guinness Book of Records]], the highest musical note ever scored for the human voice) that come shortly before the end. This aria was composed in order to be [[Insertion aria|inserted]] into [[Gluck]]'s opera, ''[[Alceste_(Gluck)|Alceste]]'', and also specifically to showcase the superlative vocal skills of Mozart's sister-in-law, [[Aloysia Weber]], who was only 18 at the time.  However sopranos who are able to cope with the aria's demands have been few and far between, and the aria is usually omitted from performances of ''Alceste''.  It has been therefore redesignated a concert aria, to be presented in concerts by such rare singers as are able to deliver its fiendishly difficult coloratura.
*''Nehmt meinen Dank, ihr holden Gönner!'', K. 383, for soprano.&lt;ref name="Libonati"&gt;{{harv|Libonati|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*''[[Ch'io mi scordi di te?]]'', K. 505, written for [[Nancy Storace]]&lt;ref name="Libonati" /&gt;
*''[[Vorrei spiegarvi, oh Dio!]]'', K. 418, written for [[Aloysia Weber]]&lt;ref name="Libonati" /&gt;
*''Bella mia fiamma'', K. 528, written for [[Josepha Duschek]]&lt;ref name="Libonati" /&gt;
*''[[Per Questa Bella Mano|Per questa bella mano]]'', [[Per Questa Bella Mano|K. 612]], for [[bass (voice type)|bass]], [[double bass]] obbligato, and orchestra&lt;ref name="Libonati" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7625">'''Cultural literacy''' is a term coined by [[E. D. Hirsch]], referring to the ability to understand and participate fluently in a given culture. Cultural literacy is an analogy to literacy proper (the ability to read and write letters). A literate reader knows the object-language's alphabet, grammar, and a sufficient set of vocabulary; a culturally literate person knows a given culture's [[Sign (semiotics)|signs]] and [[symbols]], including its language, particular dialectic, stories,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Watson|first=Rita|title=Learning Words from Linguistic Expressions: Definition and Narrative|journal=Research in the Teaching of English|date=Oct 1987|volume=21|issue=3|pages=298–317|jstor=40171117}}&lt;/ref&gt; entertainment, idioms, idiosyncrasies, and so on.  The culturally literate person is able to talk to and understand others of that culture with fluency, while the culturally illiterate person fails to understand culturally-conditioned allusions, references to past events, idiomatic expressions, jokes, names, places, etc.

==Examples==

For example, in 1908 British author [[G. K. Chesterton]] wrote, "Complete self-confidence is a weakness... the man who has [self-confidence] has '[[St Bernard's Hospital, Hanwell|Hanwell]]' written on his face as plain as it is written on that omnibus".&lt;ref name=Orthodoxy&gt;{{cite book|last=Chesterton|first=G. K.|title=[[Orthodoxy (book)|Orthodoxy]]|location=Chapter II, "The Maniac"|date=1908}}&lt;/ref&gt; This statement, especially the latter half, might be opaque to an American who does not know that "omnibus" is a less common, British word for "bus" and opaque to present-day Britons as "Hanwell" was the name of a (now defunct) insane asylum.

==Causes==
Children of a given culture typically become culturally literate there via the process of [[enculturation]]. Enculturation seems to occur naturally, being intertwined with education, play, family relationships, friendships, etc. The cause of cultural literacy is a more difficult question when considering [[acculturation]] of immigrants, outsiders, cultural minorities, strangers, guests, etc.

Literacy of a given culture seems to arise over time with consistent exposure to and participation in that culture, especially certain key cultural strongholds, like business, story, arts, education, history, religion, and family. One could become literate for an oral culture (with no written language or recorded media) only by extended conversation. Alternatively, one could become literate for a written culture through conversation as well as reading culturally relevant books or exposure to culturally relevant films, plays, monuments, television shows, etc.

[[Western culture]] in general and Anglo-American culture in particular is a bibliocentric culture.  It often trades in allusions to the Christian Bible,&lt;ref name="Mangalwadi, The Book that Made Your World"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mangalwadi|first=Vishal Mangalwadi|title=The Book that Made Your World|year=2012|publisher=Thomas Nelson|isbn=1595555455|pages=464|url=https://www.amazon.com/Book-that-Made-Your-World/dp/1595555455}}&lt;/ref&gt; the influential works of [[Early Modern English]] such as works of [[William Shakespeare]], the Thomas Cranmer ''[[Book of Common Prayer]]'', [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s poetry, and many others. Knowledge of these books (among others) contributes largely to cultural literacy in the west. However, also essential are exposure to the art, history, and the lived experience of members of that culture.

==Consequences==
The benefits and detriments of cultural literacy are debated. For example, social mobility increases when one is able to comfortably participate in conversation with gatekeepers like employers and teachers.
Non-native members of a culture, such as missionaries to a foreign land or refugees from a native land, may experience negative consequences due to cultural illiteracy. However, the achievement of cultural literacy may seem to come at a cost to one's own native culture.

==Research and controversy==

Discussions of cultural literacy have given rise to several controversial questions:&lt;ref name="Musings...: Cultural Literacy"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Applebee |first=Arthur N.[A.N.A]|title=Musings...: Cultural Literacy|journal=Research in the Teaching of English|date=Oct 1987|volume= 21|issue=3|pages=229–231|jstor=40171113}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Literature Question: How important are ''books'' to cultural literacy in the west? And which books? 
*The Content Question: What kinds of knowledge are important for cultural literacy? Knowing such and such facts, names, dates or more ethereal experiences like having heard such and such a song? 
*The Minority Question: Is cultural literacy part of the hegemony of the dominant culture? 
*The Multicultural Question: Which culture are we talking about when we say "cultural" literacy? Should we be talking about one or several—and which one(s)?&lt;ref name="Multicultural Literacy"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wiener|first=Harvey S.|title=Multicultural Literacy for Faculty: Accommodating Non-Native Speakers of English in Content Courses|journal=Rhetoric Review|date=Sep 1985|volume=4|issue=1|pages=100–107|jstor=465770|doi=10.1080/07350198509359111}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*The Education Question: Should advancing cultural literacy be one of the goals of education? If so, what is the best means of doing so? 
*The Assessment Question: How do we evaluate cultural literacy? Is there a best way to test someone's cultural literacy?

The varying (and often competing) answers to these questions are being studied by sociologists, educators, philosophers, and professors of literature

'''Disability in the arts''' is an aspect within various arts disciplines of [[inclusion (disability rights)|inclusive practices involving disability]]. It manifests itself in the output and mission of some [[theatre|stage]] and [[modern dance]] performing-arts companies, and as the subject matter of individual works of art, such as the work of specific painters and those who draw.

Disability in the arts is distinguished from [[disability art]] in that it refers to art that includes people with disabilities, whether in themes, performance, or the creation of the artwork, rather than works focusing on disability as the central theme. It{{specify|date=February 2014}} can also refer to work that is made as a political act toward shaping a new community, fostering [[disability culture]]:
{{quote
|Disability culture is the difference between being alone, isolated, and individuated with a physical, cognitive, emotional or sensory difference that in our society invites discrimination and reinforces that isolation – the difference between all that and being in community. Naming oneself part of a larger group, a social movement or a subject position in modernity can help to focus energy, and to understand that solidarity can be found – precariously, in improvisation, always on the verge of collapse.
|Petra Kuppers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kuppers|first=Petra|title=Disability Culture and Community Performance: Find a Strange and Twisted Shape|year=2011|publisher=Palgrave|location=Houndmills and New York|isbn=978-0-230-29827-9|page=109|url=http://www.palgrave.com/products/title.aspx?pid=504063}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

People with disabilities sometimes participate in artistic activities as part of [[expressive therapy]] (also known as "expressive arts therapy" or "creative arts therapy"). Expressive therapy may take the form of [[writing therapy]], [[music therapy]], [[drama therapy]], or another artistic method. While creativity and artistic expression are parts of expressive therapy, they are secondary to the goal of achieving a therapeutic benefit. This article describes disability in the arts where artistic achievement is the primary goal.

===Dance===

{{main|Physically integrated dance}}

[[File:LisaBufanoOrangeQueenAnneTableLegProstheses.jpg|thumb|[[Lisa Bufano]] performing on her signature orange Queen Anne table legs.]]
The '''physically integrated dance''' movement is part of the [[disability culture]] movement, which recognizes the first-person experience of disability. This means disability is integrated not as a [[Medical model of disability|medical model]] construct but as a [[Social model of disability|social phenomenon]], through artistic, literary, and other creative means.&lt;ref&gt;Pelka, Fred (1997).

===Music===
[[File:Django Reinhardt (Gottlieb 07301).jpg|thumb|Jazz guitarist and composer [[Django Reinhardt]] became a top-selling recording artist. He developed new guitar techniques used by many guitarists today.]]
[[File:Melody Gardot (1).jpg|thumb|Singer [[Melody Gardot]] used music as therapy to improve her memory while recovering from a [[traumatic brain injury]]. She later became a top-selling jazz vocalist, and now tours internationally.]]

[[Beethoven]] is remembered for his ability to compose classic music after completely losing his hearing. He tried several ways of using his deteriorating hearing before it completely disappeared. He had the legs of his [[pianoforte]] cut off, so that it was sitting directly on the floor. By lying on the floor in front of the keyboard, he could feel vibrations while he played, helping him to compose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bauer|first=Helen|title=Beethoven for Kids: His Life and Music With 21 Activities|year=2011|publisher=Chicago Review Press|isbn=9781569767115|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different attempts were made to help Beethoven with [[adaptive technology|adaptive]] or assistive technology.  [[Thomas Broadwood]], the [[Johann Andreas Streicher|Streichers]], and [[Conrad Graf]] were all piano manufacturers who tried different methods of adapting the instrument to make it louder for Beethoven: [[ear trumpet]]s were attached to the [[sound board (music)|soundboard]], [[resonance]] plates were added to the underside of a piano, and using four strings for every key were all tried. Beethoven ultimately lost all hearing, and could no longer rely on an instrument to help him compose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Good|first=Edwin M.|title=Giraffes, Black Dragons, and Other Pianos: A Technological History from Cristofori to the Modern Concert Grand|year=2002|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=9780804745499|page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beethoven composed his [[Symphony No. 9 (Beethoven)|Ninth Symphony]] at this time in his life.

Belgian jazz guitarist [[Django Reinhardt]] was a 20-year-old, accomplished guitarist when his left hand was severely burned in a house fire, leaving him with only the use of two fingers for playing the [[fretboard]] on the neck of the guitar. While he recovered from his burns, his brother gave him a new guitar. Reinhardt devised his own physical therapy, practising daily to stretch his fingers. He also invented new techniques to compensate for the lost fingers: {{blockquote|Instead of playing scales and [[arpeggio]]s horizontally across the fretboard as was the norm, he searched out fingerings that ran vertically up and down the frets as they were easier to play with just two fingers. He created new chord forms using a minimum of notes—often just triads with his two good fingers on the bass strings. He pushed his paralyzed fingers to grip the guitar as well, his smallest digit on the high E string, his ring finger on the B, and sometimes barring his index finger to fashion chords of four to five notes. He then slid his hand up and down the fretboard, employing these chord forms to craft a fluent vocabulary.&lt;ref name="Dregni"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dregni|first=Michael|title=Django: The Life And Music Of A Gypsy Legend|year=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195304480|pages=47–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Reinhardt continued to work as a guitarist, and became world-famous as a recording artist. Reinhardt's creative techniques became part of the jazz guitar repertoire.&lt;ref name="Dregni"/&gt;

[[Melody Gardot]], a jazz vocalist, suffered a [[traumatic brain injury]] after she was hit by a car while riding a bicycle. Gardot's injury impaired her memory, including her ability to speak. She spent a year recovering in hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=French |first=David |date=March 2007 |title=Melody Gardot: Philadelphia Story |journal=Jazz times |volume=37 |issue=1-5 |pages=30–1 |url=http://jazztimes.com/articles/18685-melody-gardot-philadelphia-story |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090329001505/http://jazztimes.com/articles/18685-melody-gardot-philadelphia-story |archivedate=March 29, 2009 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; While in hospital, her therapy required her to relearn the process of completing simple tasks, such as remembering to shut off a water tap after brushing her teeth. Remembering words to complete sentences was a challenge for Gardot. A doctor suggested that Gardot try singing sentences as an alternative to speaking them, as a way of improving her ability to remember longer sentences. Gardot discovered that this method improved her memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Markle|first=Sandra|title=Wounded Brains: True Survival Stories|year=2011|publisher=Lerner Publications|isbn=9780761363101|pages=40–1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gardot gained a music following by adding recordings of her music to Myspace in 2006. Gardot is now a world-famous recording artist, in both French and English, and gives concerts around the globe. She sometimes still has memory lapses while performing, and Gardot needs to wear sunglasses to protect her light-sensitive eyes. She carries a cane as she occasionally experiences [[vertigo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ruiz|first=Enrique|title=Wisher, Washer, Wishy-Washy|year=2008|publisher=PositivePsyche.Biz|isbn=9780615252407|pages=126–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, British composer [[Charles Hazlewood]] formed the [[British Paraorchestra]], an [[orchestra]] that aims to consist entirely of skilled disabled musicians to counter his belief that orchestras do not contain enough disabled musicians. The formation of the orchestra was the subject of a [[Channel 4]] documentary, and it also performed during the [[2012 Summer Paralympics closing ceremony|closing ceremony]] of the [[2012 Summer Paralympics]] in [[London]].&lt;ref name=guardian-paraorchestra&gt;{{cite news|title=Coldplay join the paraorchestra of disabled musicians for closing ceremony|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2012/sep/01/orchestra-disabled-people-play-paralympics?newsfeed=true|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=11 September 2012|location=London|first=Maggie|last=Brown|date=1 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK the [[One Handed Musical Instrument Trust]] has the objective of removing the barriers to music-making faced by the physically disabled. It comments: "There is currently no orchestral instrument that can be played without two fully functioning hands and arms, denying unlimited participation in musical life to those with congenital disabilities and amputees, as well as the millions who may have been injured, suffered a stroke or developed arthritis. The primary obstacle is the absence of suitable instruments."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ohmi.org.uk/]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theatre===
{{main|Theatre and disability}}
In modern times, the treatment of disability in theatre works has reflected an evolution in mainstream social attitudes towards disability. In Western culture, disability was once rarely mentioned in plays. Notable exceptions include Shakespeare's ''[[Richard III (play)|Richard III]]''. The character of Richard III was depicted as "deformed, unfinish'd" has served as an example of an "[[anti-hero]]" and illustrated the depiction of people with disabilities in the arts as villains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/art-features/9809671/Richard-III-Visions-of-a-villain.html|title=Richard III: Visions of a villain?|author=Smart, Alastair|website=The Telegraph|date=20 January 2013|access-date=16 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Richard's physical disabilities are used to symbolize the fundamental weakness in his character. Yet Shakespeare was conscious of the common mistake of equating physical beauty with personal or moral qualities, or the reverse perception, that physical unattractiveness represents personal flaws (he satirizes such attitudes in his [[Sonnet 130]]). Richard III is portrayed as a complex character, one whose tragedy is in surrendering to his moral weaknesses rather than overcoming them.

The inclusion of performers with disabilities in theatre has developed in tandem with wider public acceptance of integrating people with disabilities in mainstream society. French theatre actress [[Sarah Bernhardt]] was already famous when she had a leg amputation at age 71. She continued her acting career. Bernhardt disliked her prosthetic limbs and chose to use a sedan chair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cavendish|first1=Richard|title=Sarah Bernhardt's Leg|journal=History Today|date=February 2015|volume=65|issue=2|url=http://www.historytoday.com/richard-cavendish/sarah-bernhardts-leg|accessdate=8 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Theatre Workshop of the Handicapped]] (NTWH) was a [[repertory theatre]] company based in New York City that worked in advocacy, training, and production in theatre for performers with disabilities. It was primarily inclusive of performers and playwrights with physical disabilities when it was founded in 1977. NTWH oversaw projects such as the Writers’ Program for Wounded Warriors, which served as both a therapeutic and artistic program for war veterans to explore the psychological, emotional and spiritual experiences of war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Coronado|first=Christa|title=Father Richard Curry, S.J.: The Perfection of Eloquence|url=https://www.pbs.org/wnet/religionandethics/episodes/by-topic/education/father-richard-curry-s-j-the-perfection-of-eloquence/5248/|date=December 15, 2009|accessdate=July 7, 2012|publisher=PBS}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Famous People Players]], founded in 1974, is a touring black light theatre company based in Toronto, Canada, that employs people with disabilities as performers and staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Famous PEOPLE Players Dine &amp; Dream Theatre|url=http://www.seetorontonow.com/listings/famous-people-players-dine-dream-theatre/|website=See Toronto|accessdate=8 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some notable 20th-century plays have dealt directly with disability. American playwright [[Tennessee Williams]] wrote many plays with female leads who were at least in part inspired by his sister Rose, who was diagnosed with [[schizophrenia]], and then left severely disabled by a [[lobotomy]] as a young woman. Characters who reflect Rose's struggle with mental illness include Laura in ''[[The Glass Menagerie]]'', [[Blanche DuBois]] in ''[[A Streetcar Named Desire (play)|A Streetcar Named Desire]]'', and Catherine in the screenplay Williams wrote for the 1959 film ''[[Suddenly, Last Summer (film)|Suddenly, Last Summer]]''. In Williams' plays, such women are seen as suffering tragedy as a result of their illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schvey |first1=Henry |date=2011 |title=The Tragic Poetics of Tennessee Williams |journal=Études Anglaises |volume=61 |issue=1 |page=74 |url=https://pad.artsci.wustl.edu/tragic-poetics-tennessee-williams |accessdate=8 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Heilman |first1=Robert Bechtold |date=1977 |title=Tennessee Williams' Approach to Tragedy |publisher=Prentice Hall |location=Englewood Cliffs}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Leonard Gershe]]'s ''[[Butterflies Are Free (play)|Butterflies Are Free]]'', about a young blind man who wins his independence from an overprotective mother, debuted on Broadway in 1969, was made into a film in 1972. The main character was played by non-blind actors in both the original run of the play and the film version. In contrast, the play ''[[Children of a Lesser God (play)|Children of a Lesser God]]'', written by [[Mark Medoff]] and debuting in 1980, included a deaf actress playing the female lead role of a character who is deaf. This continued in [[Children of a Lesser God (film)|the 1986 film version]]; [[Marlee Matlin]], who is deaf, won an [[Academy Award for Best Actress]]. In addition, the play ''Spring Awakening'', a production by Deaf West and which debuted in 2015 on Broadway, featured a large cast of Deaf actors. The play featured both hearing and Deaf actors that performed using American Sign Language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Considine|first=Allison|date=November 1, 2015|title=Ready, Willing, and Able|url=|journal=American Theater Group|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film==
{{For|the depiction of disability in documentary film|Disability in the media}}
For filmmakers and audiences alike, there is an unspoken appeal for disabled people on screen.  Films have an impact in shaping society's views of specific groups.  For films with disability, these views and stereotypes are drawn from social institutions and norms in Western culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Norden, Martin|authorlink1=The Hollywood Discourse on Disability|editor1-last=Enns|editor1-first=Anthony|editor2-last=Smit|editor2-first=Christopher|title=Screening Disability|date=2001|publisher=University Press of America|isbn=0-7618-2017-5|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Several influential pieces of writing that predate film which include disability:
* [[Moby-Dick]], Captain Ahab's sole purpose is to take revenge on the whale that made him disabled.
* The [[Old Testament]], disability as a punishment from God is found in several passages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weinberg|first1=Nancy|last2=Sebian|first2=Carol|title=The Bible and Disability|journal=Rehabilitation Counseling Bulletin|date=1980|volume=23|pages=273–81}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Richard III (play)]] by William Shakespeare, there is a character, Richard Crookback, whose disability and villainy are inseparable.
These examples point to a reoccurring theme of disability in mainstream culture and in film, it is pervasive and often overlooked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Paul Longmore|editor1-last=Enns|editor1-first=Anthony|editor2-last=Smit|editor2-first=Christopher|title=Screening Disability|date=2001|publisher=University Press of America|isbn=0-7618-2017-5|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One theory movie goers continue to watch films with disability is explained psychologically.  In Sigmund Fraud's 1919 essay [[Uncanny]], he attributes the fear of disability as a substitute for castration anxiety and veering from the norm &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Norden|first1=Martin|title=The Cinema of Isolation|date=1994|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=0-8135-2103-3|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
&lt;!--[[File:X-johnnybelindalenda48-jjp.jpg|thumb|A poster for the [[melodrama]] film ''[[Johnny Belinda]]'' (1948). The deaf-mute main character used [[sign language]] in a mainstream film for the first time.]]--&gt;

Film in disability typically involves the portrayal of one disability or another in a way that is meant to communicate a specific message or perspective. Many films strive to create a sense of inclusiveness and awareness, thereby eliminating the apparent social stigma associated with disability. Many films aim to trigger discussion and other forms of engagement revolving around disability.

Independent disability film is often screened on a larger scale during disability film festivals. [[ReelAbilities]], for example, acts to “[promote] appreciation and awareness of the lives, stories and artistic expressions of people with various disabilities.”&lt;ref name= "RA"&gt;"ReelAbilities: Houston Disabilities Film Festival 2013." ReelAbilities: Houston Disabilities Film Festival 2013. N.p., n.d. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; They additionally aim to “bring together our community to explore, discuss, embrace, and celebrate the diversity of our shared human experience.”

Disability in film has been a relatively recent phenomenon; as Hollywood has “kept its distance, favouring conditions such as blindness, deafness and discreet mental illnesses which exhibit no outward sign of deformity, though good-looking wheelchair users have proved acceptable.”&lt;ref name= "GUK"&gt;Cox, David. "Disability in Film: Is Cinema Finally Moving with the Times?" The Guardian. Guardian News and Media, 23 July 0012.&lt;/ref&gt; According to scholar David T. Mitchell, it was nearly thirty years ago that “a resurgence of concern over the consequences of dehumanizing representations (monster, freak, madman, suffering innocent, hysteric, beggar) resulted in suspicion over the ultimate utility of representational studies about disability.”&lt;ref name= "DTM"&gt;Mitchell, David T., and Sharon L. Snyder. Narrative Prosthesis: Disability and the Dependencies of Discourse. Ann Arbor: University of Michigan, 2001. P. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Mitchell further discusses the shift to altering the social perception of various disabilities in the public sphere.

Disability has been portrayed in film since the era of silent cinema. Disability may be an essential [[plot (narrative)|plot]] element or make a significant contribution in another way as part of the [[screenplay]]. The experiences of disabled war veterans were often the basis of early films that dealt with disability. ''[[The Light That Failed]]'', a popular short story by British author [[Rudyard Kipling]], was filmed in 1916, 1923 and 1939. The [[protagonist]], a veteran gradually losing his eyesight, became in many ways a template for many films that would portray disabled veterans as tragic victims. Films in this pattern include ''[[The Men (film)|The Men]]'' (1950), starring [[Marlon Brando]], and ''[[Johnny Got His Gun (film)]]'' (1971), an anti-war film directed by [[Dalton Trumbo]]. Other early films established the pattern of portraying disabled soldiers as "noble warriors", confronting and overcoming both physical disability and society's lack of understanding upon their return home. Some examples include ''[[Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo]]'' (1944), ''[[Since You Went Away]]'' (1944), and the groundbreaking ''[[The Best Years of Our Lives]]'' (1945). ''The Best Years of Our Lives'' tells the story of several veterans who are disabled in battle, then return home to face their own bitterness and the challenge of reintegrating into society as men with a disability. Some members of the film industry opposed the decision to cast [[Harold Russell]], a real-life veteran who lost both hands in a training accident, stating that it was in "poor taste". However, the film was popular with audiences, and Russell was awarded the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]], as well as "a special Oscar for 'Bringing hope and courage to his fellow veterans'".&lt;ref name="Benshoff-2011"/&gt;

Early portrayals of women with disabilities rarely strayed from an image of an innocent, sheltered young woman. Even a nuanced film like [[Charlie Chaplin]]'s ''[[City Lights]]'' (1931) follows this pattern. This film tells the story of the Little Tramp's efforts to help a blind flower girl with whom he falls in love. The film was radical in challenging the audience at the end of the film to take the point of view of someone blind, to metaphorically "see" beyond their prejudices towards others. The melodrama ''[[Johnny Belinda (1948 film)|Johnny Belinda]]'' (1948), which depicts an innocent young deaf woman raped and then defending herself from an attempted murder, does little to give the lead character any depth beyond being a typical "plucky" and brave hero. Yet, the film was notable for bringing [[sign language]] to mainstream film audiences for the first time,&lt;ref name="Benshoff-2011"/&gt; and for making a woman with a disability the main character and allowing her to triumph over adversity. ''[[Children of a Lesser God (film)|Children of a Lesser God]]'' (1986) shattered the stereotype of the innocent young woman with a disability. The character Sarah is independent, strong-willed, and often fails to recognize what is in her own best interests. [[Marlee Matlin]] won the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]], and was an exception to the general rule that only non-disabled actors would appear in high-profile film roles depicting someone with a disability.

Disabled actors that are older, over 40 more specifically, are more likely to be chosen for roles in films, compared to their younger counterparts. This suggests that the perception of the disability in film becomes more acceptable as one gets older.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Raynor|first=Olivia|last2=Hayward|first2=Katharine|date=2009-03-01|title=Breaking into the business: experiences of actors with disabilities in the entertainment industry|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1471-3802.2009.01114.x/abstract|journal=Journal of Research in Special Educational Needs|language=en|volume=9|issue=1|pages=39–47|doi=10.1111/j.1471-3802.2009.01114.x|issn=1471-3802}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[ReelAbilities]], is an annual film festival in the United States screening films about disability issues.

===Plot===
*''[[Sur mes lèvres]]'' features a heroine who is introduced immediately with a shot of her putting her earpiece in. Carla ([[Emmanuelle Devos]]) is by no means weak-willed, but her partial [[deaf]]ness makes it more distressing to watch her cope with her job as an overworked and under-appreciated secretary. It is only when she faints from the exhaustion of picking up after her unpleasant coworkers that Carla accepts the boss's offer of an [[intern]] assistant. She rapidly falls in love with her new colleague, an ex-[[convict]], and ends up colluding with him in an outlandish scheme.
*''[[Rory O'Shea Was Here]]'', about a young rebel man with [[muscular dystrophy]] who tries to help a fellow young man with [[cerebral palsy]] follow him in the arts of "getting drunk and getting laid". Rory dies at the film's end, but his mission has been accomplished: his friend with CP has successfully been taught [[self-determination]], and carries on the legacy.
*''[[One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (film)|One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest]]'' is a drama about the (mis)treatment of [[mental patient]]s which was the second film to win all five main [[Academy Award]]s.

*In ''[[Wait Until Dark (film)|Wait Until Dark]]'', a [[blindness|blind]] woman ([[Audrey Hepburn]]) must fight criminals who break into her home. Hepburn was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Actress.
*In ''[[Snow Cake]]'', [[Sigourney Weaver]] plays an [[autistic]] woman, and has said that she spent enormous amounts of time with a real-life autistic individual in order to [[method acting|totally immerse herself in this role]].
*In ''[[The Horse Whisperer (film)|The Horse Whisperer]]'', teenager Grace ([[Scarlett Johansson]]) loses her lower right leg in a riding accident which also leaves her horse traumatised. The film portrays the physical and mental recovery of both horse and rider after her mother ([[Kristin Scott Thomas]]) drives them from New York to Montana to meet "[[natural horsemanship|horse whisperer]]" [[Robert Redford]].&lt;ref name="THWh"/&gt;
*The 2010 Chinese film ''[[Ocean Heaven]]'' is about an autistic son.&lt;ref name="Ocean"/&gt;
* In ''[[Rust and Bone]]'', [[Marion Cotillard]] plays Stéphanie, an orca trainer who loses her legs after an accident at the marine park she works. Stéphanie, now in a wheelchair, is terminally depressed and starts a relationship with Ali [[Matthias Schoenaerts]], who brings her back to life.

===Screenplay===
In the 2009 science fiction film ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'', the [[paraplegic]] protagonist ([[Sam Worthington]]) experiences a new freedom as a fully mobile human-alien hybrid (avatar).

[[Spencer Tracy]] plays a handicapped war veteran in ''[[Bad Day at Black Rock]]''. He steps off the train at the almost-deserted desert hamlet of Black Rock. It is the first time the train has stopped there in four years. The remaining inhabitants are unaccountably hostile, but Tracy proves that one good arm is all you need to win a fight.

=== Film by era===
Disability in film can be categorized into three eras: [[silent film]] to the 1930s, 1940s to the 1970s, and post 1970s.
==== Silent films to the 1930s ====
One of the first disability films is Thomas Edison's ''Fake Beggar'' in 1898.  This short film of fifty seconds, is about a fake beggar who poses as blind, but is eventually caught by the police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Norden|first1=Martin|title=The Cinema of Isolation|date=1994|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=0-8135-2103-3|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Early depictions of the disabled involved criminality and freak shows.  In this era, scientist tried to rationalize and catalog people’s abnormalities,for example Francis Bacon attempt in 1620 to Isidore Geoffroy Saint-Hillaire actualized catalog in the 1830s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Angela|title=Hideous Progeny|date=2012|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-15717-9|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, [[Cesare Lombroso]], a criminal anthropologist, drew a direct correlation between body and mind as a sign of degeneracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Angela|title=Hideous Progeny|date=2012|publisher=Columbia University Press|isbn=978-0-231-15717-9|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This idea points to a common trope, one of the disabled criminal.  Furthermore, these early films coincided with the accepted idea of [[eugenics]] at the time, leaning heavily towards the [[medical model of disability]].
* [[The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari]] contains the trope of the insane hypnotist, Dr. Caligari, as a criminal and villain.  The disabled insane criminal in this film also touches on another stereotype, the one of the disabled person exacting revenge on the non-disabled world.  This reaction assumes the nefarious character also has a loss of humanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Paul Longmore|editor1-last=Enns|editor1-first=Anthony|editor2-last=Smit|editor2-first=Christopher|title=Screening Disability|date=2001|publisher=University Press of America|isbn=0-7618-2017-5|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, the expressionist style of shooting, gives the viewer a distinct perspective of a mentally disabled person.
* [[Freaks (film)]] is an exploitative film by definition.  This is achieved through the use of real disabled and freak show actors in the film.  Though director Todd Browning is able to show the humanity of the freaks through marriage, birth, community, and other aspects of being a human, the second half of the film reverts to a dehumanizing revenge scene.  The abnormal bodies are a metaphor for a lack of emotional and spiritual capacity, that the latter part of the film displays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Paul Longmore|editor1-last=Enns|editor1-first=Anthony|editor2-last=Smit|editor2-first=Christopher|title=Screening Disability|date=2001|publisher=University Press of America|isbn=0-7618-2017-5|pages=3–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The freak show characters are also placed in the center framing of many shots, as spectacles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Church|first1=David|title=Freakery, Cults Films, and the Problem of Ambivalence|journal=Journal of Film &amp; Video|date=2011|volume=63|issue=1|page=7|issn=0742-4671}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 1940s to the 1970s ====
This era of disability films can be described as post-war films.  The trope of the disabled alcoholic veteran in a wheelchair became passe.  The WWII and the Vietnam War were publicly perceived and reacted to differently, therefore representations of disabled veterans from these respective wars were also different.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Norden|first1=Martin|title=The Disabled Vietnam Vet in Hollywood Films|journal=Journal of Popular Film &amp; Television|date=1985|volume=13|issue=1|page=8|issn=0195-6051}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Post-traumatic stress]] is a reoccurring theme in the 1970s, as action films that previously upheld American culture and values, no longer did as a result of the Vietnam War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Christian Keatthley|editor1-last=Enns|editor1-first=Anthony|editor2-last=Smit|editor2-first=Christopher|title=Screening Disability|date=2001|publisher=University Press of America|isbn=0-7618-2017-5|page=103}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
* [[The Men (film)|The Men]] used paraplegic veterans of WWII. It documented the lives of returning veterans.  This film is able to move past veterans bound by wheelchairs and to show another side of their lives.  However, there are instances of characters in the film who speak about their disability in spite&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Norden|first1=Martin|title=The Cinema of Isolation|date=1994|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=0-8135-2103-3|pages=178–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[The Conversation]], private surveillance expert Harry Caul realizes that one of his recording jobs will result in a murder.  As a result, Harry refuses to hand over the recordings.  This leads him into a spiral of helplessness, where Harry is no longer in control of his precious privacy.  This exemplifies PTSD, as the protagonist is betrayed by authority and in a position of powerlessness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Christian Keatthley|editor1-last=Enns|editor1-first=Anthony|editor2-last=Smit|editor2-first=Christopher|title=Screening Disability|date=2001|publisher=University Press of America|isbn=0-7618-2017-5|pages=105–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[The Deer Hunter]] followed a group of returning veterans in varying conditions.  However, the stereotype of the helpless disabled veteran is not evident in this film.  Though for the much of the film the disabled character, Steven, is in a place of powerlessness.  In the last scene, the group comes together singing God Bless America and toasting, representing his return to group society and away from the helpless disabled person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Norden|first1=Martin|title=The Disabled Vietnam Vet in Hollywood Films|journal=Journal of Popular Film &amp; Television|date=1985|volume=13|issue=1|page=19|issn=0195-6051}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Post 1970s ====
Contemporary films have attempted more nuanced and humanistic portrayals of the disabled.  One particular movement, [[Dogme 95]], attempted to change the standard narratives, aesthetics and productions of studio film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Britt|first1=Thomas|title=Dogme 95 and disability identity on film|journal=Journal of Visual Art Practice|date=2013|volume=12|issue=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Notable Examples:
* [[Lars and the Real Girl]] is about a withdrawn young man who has a relationship with his sex doll, who uses a wheelchair.  The townspeople are hesitant to accept Lars' companion, but eventually welcome her into the community.  The doll, Bianca, represents a wheelchair-user/disabled person, who is accepted.  Furthermore, Lars' uses the doll for the community to accept his disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Markotic|first1=Nicole|title=PUNCHING UP THE STORY: Disability and Film|journal=Revue Canadienne d'Études cinématographiques / Canadian Journal of Film Studies|date=2008|volume=17|issue=1|pages=2–3|issn=0847-5911}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Julien Donkey Boy]].  Where director [[Harmony Korine]] attempts to film a character with untreated schizophrenia in a nuanced perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Britt|first1=Thomas|title=Dogme 95 and disability identity on film|journal=Journal of Visual Art Practice|date=2013|volume=12|issue=3|page=298}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Following the [[Dogme 95]] movement, it is shot in an unfiltered manner and anti-Hollywood style.  In addition, there are scene where disabled characters create artistic and creative performances, a divergence from disability tropes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Britt|first1=Thomas|title=Dogme 95 and disability identity on film|journal=Journal of Visual Art Practice|date=2013|volume=12|issue=3|page=300}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Media Companies===
Some visual media companies have a particular focus on issues involving disability. Some examples follow.
* [[Digital Theatre Systems]] - Surround sound and DTS-CSS or Cinema Subtitling System, captioning for film theatres
* [[Narrative Television Network]] in Tulsa, Oklahoma, adds audio description (delivered by television broadcast, cable, satellite, and the Internet) to an existing soundtrack.
* [[Roaring Girl Productions]] is a professional media company based in Bristol, UK, which creates fresh representations of disability in its productions.&lt;ref name="Resistance-1"/&gt; Founded in 1999 by artist-activist Liz Crow, RGP's work tours internationally&lt;ref name="Resistance-2"/&gt; and has set new standards of good practice for the inclusion of disabled people in film production and as audiences.
* [[Audio Description Associates]] creates audio description services for theatre, media, and visual arts exhibitions.

===Disabled artists===
[[Adaptive technology]] is helping an increasing number of artists overcome challenges that would otherwise prevent them from fully exercising their creativity. Mobility impairments can be overcome with tools such as [[Wii Remote]], which allows users to create digital graphics and digital paintings. Computer technology can also help artists with restricted vision.

The creative use of adaptive or assistive technology in media can also provide ways for the visually impaired to enjoy visual arts. Audio devices are made available to visitors at some museums, galleries, and other cultural institutions, to provide an informative narration for visitors, whether or not they have a visual impairment. Audio narration for theatre, film or television provides necessary description, added between dialogue, for visually impaired audience members.

[[Conceptual art]] is also a way for disabled artists to engage in the arts, by using studio assistants to carry out the artist's creative vision. This is prevalent in current art practice, where several disabled artists have found success in this field.

A number of well-known visual artists have worked professionally despite the challenges of disability. Some include:
*[[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]], who had restricted mobility in his legs, and became famous for his paintings of 19th-century French dancers.
*[[Frida Kahlo]], an iconic Mexican feminist and painter, wore a body brace due to multiple severe body injuries, which she depicted in self-portraits.
*[[Claude Monet]], French [[Impressionist]] painter, gradually lost much of his vision from [[cataracts]]. His vision was left restricted to a mainly blue colour range, so he used a predominantly blue [[palette (painting)|palette]] in his later works, such as [[Water Lilies]].
*[[Vincent van Gogh]], Dutch post-Impressionist painter, probably had [[bipolar disorder]]. Symptoms of [[hallucinations]] and [[psychosis]] that he experienced may have influenced some of his experiments with visual style in his paintings.
*[[Al Capp]], American cartoonist ([[L'il Abner]]), suffered a leg amputation at age nine, which was said to have influenced his sardonic humour.
*[[John Callahan (cartoonist)|John Callahan]], American cartoonist, began his career after becoming a [[quadriplegic]] in an accident at age 21.
*[[Chuck Close]], American painter, paralyzed in 1988, a [[quadriplegic]].
*[[Yinka Shonibare]], [[MBE]], British conceptual artist, diagnosed with [[Transverse Myelitis]]. [[Turner Prize]] nominee.
*[[Ryan Gander]], British conceptual artist, a [[wheelchair]] user with a long term [[disability]].
*[[Kathleen Morris]], Canadian [[Impressionist]] painter, had cerebral palsy and became one of the most well known woman modernist painters.
*[[Ketra Oberlander]] gradually lost much of her vision, including much of her colour perception (cone of the eye) and black-and-white perception (rod of the eye). She is now legally blind, although she retains a restricted degree of vision. In mid-life, she changed careers, becoming a professional artist. Oberlander is able to use computers to create digital graphics, and also paints in acrylics. She founded an art licensing company that helps mobility-impaired artists distribute their work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ketra Oberlander&amp;nbsp;– Artist|url=http://thebadassproject.com/ketra-oberlander/|publisher=The Badass Project|accessdate=June 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Riva Lehrer]], an American artist with [[spina bifida]], [[Life drawing|draws and paints largely from life]].
*[[Angela de la Cruz]], London-based Spanish artist, paralysed following a stroke at the age of 40 and uses a wheelchair, [[Turner Prize]] nominee.
*[[Judith Scott (artist)|Judith Scott]], an American fiber sculptor with Down Syndrome.

==Literature==
[[File:Milton paradise.jpg|thumb|The title page of the first edition of ''[[Paradise Lost]]'', 1668. [[John Milton]], who was blind, composed the epic poem by dictating it to assistants who [[:wikt:transcribe|transcribed]] it for publication.]]
[[Oral literature]], the oldest form of literature, can be enjoyed by anyone, including the deaf or hearing-impaired (depending upon their ability to [[lip reading|lip-read]]), and impaired verbal ability is the only impediment to [[storytelling]]. [[Homer]], the ancient Greek author of the verse epics the ''[[Odyssey]]'' and the ''[[Iliad]]'', is believed to have been blind. This disability was no barrier to the challenge of composing, and reciting for others, his classic creations, which contain over 15,000 lines (''Iliad'') and 12,000 lines (''Odyssey''). The ''Iliad'' itself is divided into 24 "books" that each take around one hour to recite.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Iliad by Homer in Live Performance|url=http://homerproductions.com/oldfiles/homer.html|publisher=Homer Productions|accessdate=June 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tradition of oral storytelling, and the greater ease with which verse stories are memorized and retold, helped [[John Milton]] compose the 17th-century epic English poem ''[[Paradise Lost]]''. Milton gradually lost most of his eyesight and dictated ''Paradise Lost'' to willing assistants who wrote it down for publication (a process called [[Amanuensis]]).

The shift in modern Western culture away from oral storytelling to the written and printed word has created a barrier for the visually impaired. Writing and self-editing prose writing is often impossible without the use of [[assistive technology]]. Software developed for the visually impaired, called [[screen readers]], enable users to hear a voice reading the user's choice of digital printed material, such as [[e-book]]s or Websites. [[Braille keyboard]]s enable users to type and edit using a computer. Assistive technology is also available to help users with a [[learning disability]], such as [[dyslexia]], that impairs literacy, to read and write more easily using computers.

Literature that includes disability as a theme has become more common in recent decades. In non-fiction, memoirs have raised mainstream awareness of the experiences of people with disabilities. Notable recent first-person accounts include ''[[My Left Foot (book)|My Left Foot]]'', written by painter and writer [[Christy Brown]]. First published in 1954, it describes his upbringing in Ireland, his challenges brought on by severe [[cerebral palsy]], and his early career. It was made into a [[My Left Foot (film)|popular film in 1989]], for which [[Daniel Day-Lewis]] won an [[Academy Award for Best Actor]]. American writer [[Jim Knipfel]] took a humorous, irreverent approach with ''Slackjaw'' (1999), a memoir in which he details his struggles in accepting the loss of his eyesight to [[retinitis pigmentosa]].

''[[The Ship Who Sang]]'' is a collection of stories by science fiction author [[Anne McCaffrey]] about the [[brainship]] Helva. In a far future, young children with severe physical handicaps can be placed in a life-support shell and specially trained for tasks that a "normal" human would be unable to undertake. McCaffrey, who has described ''The Ship Who Sang'', an early work, as the best story she ever wrote, asked herself one day: "what if severely disabled people were given a chance to become starships?"&lt;ref name="McC-best"/&gt;

The historical novel ''[[Four Freedoms (novel)|Four Freedoms]]'' deals with the often overlooked contributions made by disabled persons to the war industry during [[World War II]].

==Accessibility of arts and cultural facilities and programs==
[[Accessibility]] is one component of serving the public that arts organizations may overlook. [[Universal design]] provides a means of including audience members, or participants, with disabilities. Some of the accessibility factors that cultural facilities and arts organizations can take into account include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Arts and Humanities Accessibility Checklist|url=http://www.nea.gov/resources/Accessibility/Planning/Step6.pdf|publisher=National Endowment for the Arts, United States Government|accessdate=July 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* accessible seating integrated into the audience area;
* accessible production areas, such as the stage, backstage, and orchestra pit areas;
* audio description devices, film captioning, and even sign language interpreting;
* Signage indicating accessible entrances and elevators;
* Accessible height and design for displays, food services, and box office;
* Exhibition labels and printed materials can include [[braille]].
* Visiting a trained low vision Optometrists specializing in the advanced optic techniques that can improve the remaining vision a person with advanced eye disease, Low  vision doctors are trained to provide numerous techniques to help to the visually impaired a variety of optical, surgical and adaptive techniques to help one continue performing the field of art.

Adaptive or accessible technology is an innovative way of making traditional arts and cultural programs available to a larger audience that includes people with disabilities. For example, audio can be added to programs through live or pre-recorded captioning. Subtitling, audio description for broadcast programs, DVD and other home entertainment, and Internet projects, are some of the ways arts venues and groups can remove barriers faced by people with disabilities.

==Accessibility organizations for the arts==

===United Kingdom===
* [[Shape Arts]] is a charity based in London that develops opportunities for disabled artists.
* [[Carousel (charity)|Carousel]] is a learning disability led arts organization based in Brighton, working in music, radio, performance, digital media and film. 

===United States===
There are many government initiatives that support the participation of people with disabilities in arts and cultural programs. Most U.S. state governments include an accessibility coordinator with their state arts agency or regional arts organization. There are a variety of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and non-profit groups that support initiatives for inclusive arts and culture.
* [[National Endowment for the Arts' Office for Accessibility|Office for Accessibility]] at the [[National Endowment for the Arts]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nea.gov/resources/Accessibility/office.html |title=NEA Accessibility - NEA Office for Accessibility |publisher=Nea.gov |accessdate=2013-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Media Access Group at WGBH]]  [[WGBH-TV|WGBH]] is the [[Public Television]] broadcaster for the Boston region. It has three divisions: the Caption Center, Descriptive Video Services (DVS), and the [[Carl and Ruth Shapiro Family National Center for Accessible Media]] (NCAM). WGBH pioneered accessible television and video in the United States.
* [[International Center on Deafness and the Arts]] provides education, training, and arts projects in areas such as theatre, arts festivals, museums, dance, distance learning, and children’s programming.
* [[Metropolitan Washington Ear]] is a non-profit organization founded in 1974 to develop projects that assist people with visual impairments. They have a program with Arena Stage in Washington, D.C., to advance audio description, a technique that uses trained narrators to provide descriptions of theatre or film action between lines of dialogue.
* [[Taping for the Blind]] provides free 24-hour radio programming, as well as custom recording, and audio description.
* [[National Captioning Institute]] is the largest captioning service provider in the United States, working with private broadcasters as well as colleges, corporations, and government agencies. It is a nonprofit corporation.

===Finland===
* [[Culture for All]] is an association promoting accessibility, inclusion and equality in the art and culture field of Finland. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Culture for All |url=http://kulttuuriakaikille.fi/en.php |publisher=Kulttuuria kaikille |accessdate=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Guitar bending animated.gif|thumb|right|Bending strings during an electric guitar solo can change a string's tension, causing it to go out of tune.]]
Stringed instruments, particularly guitars, have a tendency to get out of tune during playing, especially if strings are bent.&lt;ref name=twsO44/&gt; In the late 1980s&lt;ref&gt;Citation Needed&lt;/ref&gt;, [[Gibson Guitar Corporation|Gibson]] developed a system called the [[Gibson Robot Guitar]] which used an onboard computer, motors, and a battery to keep the instrument in tune,&lt;ref name=twsO43/&gt; but the system was complex and did not gain much marketplace acceptance, according to one report.&lt;ref name=twsE34/&gt;

Guitarist and engineering student Cosmos Lyles came up with a device to keep his guitar in tune, and with the help of engineer Paul Dowd produced a prototype of the EverTune bridge,&lt;ref name=twsO41/&gt;&lt;ref name=twsO44&gt;{{cite news

 |accessdate= 2011-08-31
}}&lt;/ref&gt; which uses a spring and lever system that maintains string tension.

==The invention==
[[File:EverTuneMechanism2.png|thumb|right|400px|The EverTune mechanism keeps a string's tension constant by using a spring and lever system.]]
The EverTune bridge keeps a [[guitar]] in tune despite changes in tension.&lt;ref name=twsO41/&gt;&lt;ref name=twsO44/&gt; The mechanical device maintains a constant state of [[Tension (physics)|tension]] despite changes in [[temperature]] or [[humidity]] or the exertion of pressure on the string.&lt;ref name=twsE33/&gt;&lt;ref name=twsO44/&gt;&lt;ref name=twsE34&gt;{{cite news

 |accessdate= 2011-08-05
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On a guitar, the bridge has six springs and levers, one for each of a guitar's six strings,&lt;ref name=twsE33/&gt; such that "when a string stretches or slips, the springs apply the opposing force necessary to compensate for the shift, thus maintaining the correct tension and tuning."&lt;ref name=twsE34/&gt; In theory, the device can work with any stringed instrument, according to the inventors.&lt;ref name=twsO44/&gt; The mechanism has been patented. A guitar with one installed is no longer tuned by turning the pegs at the end of the guitar's neck but rather with a screw on the bridge.&lt;ref name=twsE33/&gt;

==Marketing==
The chief executive officer is Mark Chayet who had previously founded a manufacturing firm named ''Evermark'' which made CDs and DVDs.&lt;ref name=twsO41/&gt; Chayet provided some of the initial financing for the firm, and other executives and entrepreneurs include David Weiderman, William Quigley, and Brock Pierce.&lt;ref name=twsO41/&gt; The firm raised $800,000 in cash in May 2010, according to one report.&lt;ref name=twsO41&gt;{{cite news

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2544">[[Image:Taz-gebaeude-paulo-olarte.jpg|thumb|Overall view of the sculpture]]

The relief sculpture '''''Friede sei mit Dir''''' ({{IPA-de|ˈfʁiːdə ˈzaɪ mɪt ˈdiːɐ̯|lang}}), also known as '''the cock of Berlin'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ftd.de/lifestyle/outofoffice/:pimmel-ueber-berlin-taz-gegen-diekmann-penis-plastik-sorgt-fuer-aerger/50042383.html ftd.de (German language)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rp-online.de/hps/client/opinio/public/pjsub/production_long.hbs?hxmain_object_id=PJSUB::ARTICLE::536223&amp;hxmain_category=pjsub::opinio::/kunst_kultur/sonstiges rp-online.de (German language)]&lt;/ref&gt; is an artwork by sculptor [[Peter Lenk]]. It is located in [[Berlin]] at the building of the [[Editing|editorial]] staff of German newspaper [[die Tageszeitung|taz]].

The sculpture displays living persons who were involuntarily used in controversial [[headline]]s by newspaper ''[[Bild]]''. The main part is a [[caricature]] of former ''Bild'' editor-in-chief [[Kai Diekmann]], stretched over five floors. The title on the top floor, "Friede sei mit Dir", is a [[double entendre]]: either "Peace be with you" or "[[Friede Springer|Friede]] be with you", the latter referring to ''Bild'''s publisher who is depicted on the left-hand side of the fourth-floor façade [[snake charming|snake-charming]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peter-lenk.de/html/obj/taz.htm peter-lenk.de (German language)]&lt;/ref&gt;

The sculpture's background is a satirical article and the ensuing lawsuit.  In 2002, journalist [[Gerhard Henschel]] claimed that Kai Diekmann had undergone a failed [[penis enlargement|medical enhancement operation]].  Dieckmann sued, unsuccessfully, for damages to his [[personality rights]] . The court held that the claimant, in his function as chief editor of ''Bild'', had willingly decided to become an actor in a personality-rights-infringing business from which he was profiting economically, and therefore was not entitled to maximum protection against infringement of his own rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bildblog.de/13213/taz-mahnt-diekmann-wegen-penissache-ab/ |title="taz" mahnt Diekmann wegen Penissache ab |accessdate=18 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.taz.de/1/archiv/archiv/?dig=2003/01/18/a0091 |title=taz, Auszug aus dem Urteil des Landgerichts Berlin zum Penis-Prozess |accessdate=18 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sculpture itself was installed in 2009 and remains legally unchallenged.

| quote = [...] the study of the geological foundation to human myths, an emerging discipline in the Earth sciences galled 'geomythology'. This term was coined by Dorothy Vitaliano, in her pioneering book ''Legends of the Earth: their geologic origins'' (1973), as, 'the study of the actual geologic origins of natural phenomena which were long explained in terms of myth and folklore'.
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

:"Geomythology indicates every case in which the origin of [[mythology|myths]] and [[legend]]s can be shown to contain references to geological phenomena and aspects, in a broad sense including astronomical ones (comets, eclipses, meteor impacts, etc.). As indicated by Vitaliano (1973) 'primarily, there are two kinds of geologic [[folklore]], that in which some geologic feature or the occurrence of some geologic phenomenon has inspired a folklore explanation, and that which is the garbled explanation of some actual geologic event, usually a natural catastrophe'."{{cn|date=October 2017}}

The claim is that oral traditions about nature are often expressed in mythological language and may contain genuine and perceptive natural knowledge based on careful observation of physical evidence. Geomythology alleges to provide valuable information about past [[earthquake]]s, [[tsunami]]s, [[flood]]s, [[impact event]]s, [[fossil]] discoveries, and other events, which are otherwise scientifically unknown or difficult to trace.{{cn|date=October 2017}}

To be distinguished from this are plainly [[aitiological]] tales that account for geological features without any connection to their formation; for example: the Native American legend of a giant bear chasing a couple who were saved when the land rose beneath their feet; the bear's claws left gouge marks on the sides of the uplift known today as [[Devils Tower National Monument|Devils Tower]], [[Wyoming]].

In August 2004 the 32nd International Geological Congress held a session on "Myth and Geology",&lt;ref&gt;"A Legendary Session: Myth and Geology", 32nd IGC Informs, ([http://www.32igc.org/stampa/32igc%20informs6%20.pdf Full text])&lt;/ref&gt; which resulted in the first peer-reviewed collection of papers on the subject (2007).&lt;ref&gt;

{{Nihongo|&lt;!-- DO NOT CHANGE "Godzilla" to "Gojira". "Godzilla" is the official trademarked romanization as established by Toho since 1955. --&gt;The '''''Godzilla'''''|ゴジラ|'''''Gojira'''''}} '''franchise''' is a [[media franchise]] featuring [[Godzilla]], owned and created by [[Toho]]. It is recognized by [[Guinness World Records]] to be the longest continuously running movie franchise, having been in on-going production from 1954 to the present day, with several hiatuses of varying lengths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/2014/9/jennifer-lawrence-game-of-thrones-frozen-among-new-entertainment-record-holders-in-guinness-world-records-2015-book-60021/|title=Jennifer Lawrence, Game of Thrones, Frozen among new entertainment record holders in Guinness World Records 2015 book|last=Guinness World Records|first=|work=Guinness World Records|date=September 3, 2014|accessdate=February 26, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film franchise consists of 34 films, 32 produced by Toho and three Hollywood films. 

The first film, ''[[Godzilla (1954 film)|Godzilla]]'', was directed by [[Ishirō Honda]] and released by Toho in 1954 and became an influential classic of the genre. It featured political and social undertones relevant to Japan at the time. The original introduced an acclaimed music score by [[Akira Ifukube]], which was reused in many of the later films. The original also introduced the work of special effects master [[Eiji Tsuburaya]], who used miniatures and "suitmation" to convey the large scale of the monster and its destruction. For its North American release, the film was reworked as an adaptation and released in 1956 as ''[[Godzilla, King of the Monsters!]]''. The adaptation featured new footage with [[Raymond Burr]] edited together with the original Japanese footage.

Toho was inspired to make the original ''Godzilla'' after the commercial success of the 1952 re-release of ''[[King Kong (1933 film)|King Kong]]'' and success of ''[[The Beast from 20,000 Fathoms]]'' (1953). The success of the ''Godzilla'' series itself would go on to inspire other monster films worldwide. The popularity of the films has led to Godzilla being featured in other media, such as [[Godzilla in popular culture|television, music, literature]], and [[Godzilla video games|video games]]. Godzilla has been one of the most recognizable symbols in Japanese pop culture worldwide, remains a well-known facet of [[Cinema of Japan|Japanese films]] and was one of the first examples of the popular ''[[kaiju]]'' and ''[[tokusatsu]]'' subgenres in Japanese entertainment.

The tone and themes vary per film. Several of the films have political themes, others have dark tones, [[shared universe|complex internal mythology]], or are simple action movies featuring aliens or other monsters, while others have simpler themes accessible to children.{{sfn|Kalat|2007|pp=1–5}} Godzilla's role varies from purely a destructive force to an ally of humans, or a protector of Japanese values, or a hero to children. The name '''Godzilla''' is a romanization of the original Japanese name '''Gojira'''—which is a combination of two Japanese words: ''gorira'' (ゴリラ), "gorilla", and ''kujira'' (クジラ), "whale". The word alludes to the size, power and aquatic origin of Godzilla. As developed by Toho, the monster is an offshoot of the combination of radioactivity and ancient dinosaur-like creatures, indestructible and possessing special powers (see [[Godzilla#Characteristics|Godzilla characteristics]]).

== History ==
The ''Godzilla'' film series is broken into several (different) eras reflecting a characteristic style and corresponding to the same eras used to classify all kaiju eiga ([[monster movies]]) in Japan. The first two eras refer to the [[Japanese emperor]] during production: the [[Shōwa era]] and the [[Heisei era]]. The third is called the Millennium era as the emperor ([[Heisei]]) is the same but these films are considered to have a different style and storyline than the Heisei era.

Over the series history, the films have reflected [[History of Japan|the social and political climate in Japan]].{{sfn|Kalat|2007|p=240}} In the original film, Godzilla was an [[allegory]] for the effects of the [[nuclear weapon|hydrogen bomb]], and the consequences that such weapons might have on earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vqronline.org/vqr-portfolio/godzilla%E2%80%99s-footprint|title=Godzilla's Footprint|last=Ryfle|first=Steve|work=VQR Online|accessdate=September 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.criterion.com/current/posts/2127-godzilla-poetry-after-the-a-bomb|title=Godzilla: Poetry After the A-Bomb|last=Hoberman|first=J.|work=Criterion|date=January 24, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Godzilla (1954 film)|Godzilla]]'' 1954 [[Toho]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Return of Godzilla]]'' 1984 [[Toho]]&lt;/ref&gt; The radioactive contamination of the Japanese fishing boat ''[[Daigo Fukuryū Maru]]'' through the United States' [[Castle Bravo]] [[thermonuclear]] device test on [[Bikini Atoll]] on March 1, 1954, led to much press coverage in Japan preceding the release of the first movie in 1954. The Heisei and Millennium series have largely continued this concept.

=== Shōwa period (1954–1975) ===
[[File:Godzilla 1954-2014 incarnations.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Every film incarnation of Godzilla between 1954–2017|alt=montage of pictures of dinosaur-like creatures]]
The initial series of movies is named for the Shōwa period in Japan (as all of these films were produced before the "''Shōwa Emperor''" [[Hirohito]]'s death in 1989).{{sfn|Solomon|2017|p=29}} This Shōwa timeline spanned from 1954, with ''[[Godzilla (1954 film)|Godzilla]]'', to 1975, with ''[[Terror of Mechagodzilla]]''. With the exceptions of ''Godzilla'', ''[[Godzilla Raids Again]]'', ''[[Mothra vs. Godzilla]]'' and ''Terror of Mechagodzilla'', much of the Shōwa series monster-action was intentionally made comical and laughable for children, with Godzilla frequently engaged in clownish slapstick wrestling with other monsters. Starting with ''Ghidorah the Three-Headed Monster'', Godzilla began evolving into a friendlier, more playful [[antihero]] (this transition was complete by ''[[Son of Godzilla]]'', where it is shown as a good character), and as years went by, it evolved into an [[anthropomorphic]] [[superhero]]. ''Ghidorah the Three-Headed Monster'' was also significant for introducing Godzilla's arch-enemy and the main antagonist of the movie series, [[King Ghidorah]]. The films ''Son of Godzilla'' and ''[[All Monsters Attack]]'' were aimed at youthful audiences, featuring the appearance of Godzilla's son, [[Minilla]]. ''[[Godzilla vs. Mechagodzilla]]'' was notable for introducing Godzilla's robotic arch-enemy and secondary villain of the movie series [[Mechagodzilla]]. The Shōwa period tied loosely in to a number of Toho-produced films in which Godzilla himself did not appear and consequently saw the addition of many monsters into the ''Godzilla'' continuity, three of which ([[Mothra]], [[Rodan]] and [[Varan]]) originated in their own solo movies and another five ([[Anguirus]], [[Kumonga]], [[Baragon]], [[Manda (kaiju)|Manda]] and [[Gorosaurus]]) appeared in their first films as either antagonistic or secondary characters.

[[Haruo Nakajima]] mainly portrayed Godzilla since 1954 until his retirement in 1972. However, other stunt actors portrayed the character in his absence, such as [[Katsumi Tezuka]], Yū Sekida, Ryosaku Takasugi, Seiji Onaka, Shinji Takagi, Isao Zushi, and [[Toru Kawai]].&lt;ref name="Godzilla"&gt;{{cite video|people=Takeo Murata (writer) and Ishirō Honda (writer/director)|title=[[Godzilla (1954 film)|Godzilla]]|medium=DVD|publisher=[[DreamWorks Classics]]|date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Am. Godzilla"&gt;{{cite video|people=Al C. Ward (writer) and Ishirō Honda, [[Terry Morse]] (writers/directors)|title=[[Godzilla, King of the Monsters!]]|medium=DVD|publisher=[[DreamWorks Classics]]|date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eiji Tsuburaya]] directed the special effects for the first six films of the series. His protege Sadamasa Arikawa took over the effects work for the next three films (with Tsuburaya supervising), while [[Teruyoshi Nakano]] directed the special effects for the last six films of the series.

=== Heisei period (1984–1995) ===
Toho rebooted the series in 1984 with ''[[The Return of Godzilla]]'', starting the second era of ''Godzilla'' films, known as the ''Heisei'' series.{{sfn|Solomon|2017|p=145}} ''The Return of Godzilla'' serves as a direct sequel to the original 1954 film and ignores the subsequent events of the Showa era. ''The Return of Godzilla'' was released in 1984, five years before the new Emperor, but is considered part of this era, as it is a direct predecessor to ''[[Godzilla vs. Biollante]]'' (1989), which came out in the first year of the new Emperor's reign.{{sfn|Lees|Cerasini|1998|p=12}}

The Heisei films are set in a single timeline, with each film providing continuity to the other films, and brings Godzilla back as a destructive force of nature that is feared by humans.{{sfn|Solomon|2017|p=145}} The biological nature and science behind Godzilla became a much more discussed issue in the films, showing the increased focus on the moral aspects of genetics. ''[[Godzilla vs. King Ghidorah]]'' gave the first concrete birth story for Godzilla, featuring a "Godzillasaurus" dinosaur-like creature that was mutated by nuclear radiation into Godzilla. Godzilla was portrayed by [[Kenpachiro Satsuma]] for the Heisei films while the special effects were directed by [[Koichi Kawakita]], with the exception of ''The Return of Godzilla'', for which the effects were directed by Teruyoshi Nakano.

=== Millennium period (1999–2004) ===
Toho rebooted the franchise for a second time, with the 1999 film ''[[Godzilla 2000: Millennium]]'', starting the third era of ''Godzilla'' films, known as the Millennium series. The Millennium series is treated similarly to an [[anthology series]] where each film, with the exception of ''[[Godzilla Against Mechagodzilla]]'' and ''[[Godzilla: Tokyo S.O.S.]]'' (which are a series all their own), is set in its own timeline and follows-up on the events of the original 1954 film, but ignores the events of the Shōwa and Heisei eras.

After the release of 2004's ''[[Godzilla: Final Wars]]'', marking the 50th anniversary of the ''Godzilla'' film franchise, Toho decided to put the series on hiatus for another 10 years. Toho also demolished the water stage on its lot used in numerous ''Godzilla'', kaiju and tokusatsu films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bucketmovies.com/bucket-hall-of-fame-the-toho-big-pool/ |title=Bucket Hall of Fame: The Toho Big Pool |accessdate=February 16, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101229081538/http://www.bucketmovies.com/bucket-hall-of-fame-the-toho-big-pool/ |archivedate=December 29, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yoshimitsu Banno]], who had directed 1971's ''[[Godzilla vs. Hedorah]]'', secured the rights from Toho to make an [[IMAX|IMAX 3D]] short film production, based on a story similar to his ''Hedorah'' film. This project eventually led to the development of [[Godzilla (2014 film)|Legendary's ''Godzilla'']].

[[Tsutomu Kitagawa]] portrayed Godzilla for the majority of the Millennium films, with the exception of ''[[Godzilla, Mothra and King Ghidorah: Giant Monsters All-Out Attack]]'', in which Godzilla was portrayed by [[Mizuho Yoshida (actor)|Mizuho Yoshida]]. Unlike the Showa and later Heisei films, the special effects for the Millennium films were directed by multiple effects directors such as [[Kenji Suzuki (director)|Kenji Suzuki]] (''Godzilla 2000'', ''[[Godzilla vs. Megaguirus]]''), Makoto Kamiya (''Godzilla, Mothra and King Ghidorah: Giant Monsters All-Out Attack''), Yuichi Kikuchi (''Godzilla Against Mechagodzilla''), and Eiichi Asada (''Godzilla: Tokyo S.O.S.'', ''Godzilla: Final Wars'').

In January 2018, Toho announced its plans to invest 15 billion yen ($135 million) for the next three years beginning in 2019 to co-produce content with Hollywood and Chinese studios who have licensed Toho's properties, such as ''[[Godzilla]]'', ''[[Your Name]]'', and ''[[Pokémon]]''. Toho will invest 25% in production costs and will earn a higher share in revenue and manage creators rights so their creative input will be shown in each work.&lt;ref&gt;[https://asia.nikkei.com/Editor-s-Picks/Japan-Update/Godzilla-studio-Toho-to-co-produce-content-with-foreign-filmmakers 'Godzilla' studio Toho to co-produce content with foreign filmmakers]&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2018, Toho’s Chief Godzilla Officer Keiji Ota revealed that a sequel to ''Shin Godzilla'' will not happen but revealed plans for a "World of Godzilla", a shared cinematic universe between Godzilla and other Toho monsters after 2021. Ota cited the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] as an influence, with plans to release a new film every one to two years.&lt;ref name="World of Godzilla"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/toho-godzilla-cinematic-universe-shin-godzilla-2-canceled/|title=Toho Planning Godzilla Cinematic Universe, Shin Godzilla 2 Canceled|last=Stephens|first=David|work=Screen Rant|date=May 19, 2018|accessdate=May 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ota stated: 

{{Quote|"After 2021, we’re thinking of a potential strategy that [releases] Godzilla movies uninterrupted at a rate of every 2 years, although there is a preference for a yearly pace as well. The future of the series and its forwarding developments are very conscious of the method of "shared universe". Godzilla, Mothra, King Ghidorah, etc. could all share a single world view much like a Marvel movie where Iron Man and the Hulk can crossover with each other. It is said that each movie can be a possible film production where any one of them could lead a film of their own as the titular character." – Keiji Ota, translated from Nikkei style.&lt;ref name="World of Godzilla"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/movies/news/947139-toho-shared-universe-future-godzilla-films|title=Toho Planning Their Own Shared Universe For Future Godzilla Films|last=Musnicky|first=Sarah|work=ComingSoon|date=May 21, 2018|accessdate=May 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film utilized a majority of the footage from the Japanese original but a majority of the political themes and social commentaries were removed, resulting in 30 minutes of footage from the Japanese original replaced with new scenes shot exclusively for the film featuring Raymond Burr interacting with Japanese actors and look-alikes to make it seem like Burr was a part of the original Japanese production. In addition, sound-effects and soundtracks were tweaked and some dialogue was dubbed into English. Similar "Americanizations" occurred for the North American releases of ''[[King Kong vs. Godzilla]]'' and ''[[Godzilla 1985]],'' the latter which included Burr reprising the role of American journalist Steve Martin.

In 1957, producer Harry Rybnick attempted to produce a Hollywood remake of ''Godzilla Raids Again'' titled ''The Volcano Monsters'', however, funding from AB-PT Pictures collapsed after the company closed down and ''Godzilla Raids Again'' was instead dubbed in English and released in 1959 by [[Warner Bros.]] as ''Gigantis the Fire Monster''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://observationdeck.kinja.com/the-first-hollywood-attempt-to-re-imagine-godzilla-ha-1573231492|title=The First Hollywood Attempt to "Reimagine" Godzilla Happened Back in 1957|last=Lizardman|first=|work=Observation Deck|date=May 7, 2014|accessdate=August 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, Toho co-produced ''[[Invasion of Astro-Monster]]'' with American studio [[UPA (animation studio)|UPA]], marking the first time a ''Godzilla'' film was co-produced with an American studio.

In the 1980s, filmmaker [[Steve Miner]] pitched his idea for an American 3D production of ''Godzilla'' to Toho, with story boards by William Stout and a script written by [[Fred Dekker]], titled ''[[Godzilla: King of the Monsters in 3D]]'' which featured Godzilla destroying San Francisco in an attempt to find its only offspring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tested.com/art/movies/460537-3d-godzilla-movie-almost-was/|title=The 3D Godzilla Movie That Almost Was|last=Konow|first=David|work=Tested|date=March 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various studios and producers showed interest in the project but passed it over due to high budget concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| first = Pat | last = Jankiewicz | title = 'Godzilla, American Style | publisher = [[Starlog (magazine)|Starlog]] | date = August 1993 |issue=193}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film would have featured a full scale animatronic Godzilla head built by [[Rick Baker]], stop motion animation executed by [[David W.

===''"Cozzilla"''===
In 1976, Italian director [[Luigi Cozzi]] intended to re-release ''Godzilla'' in Italy. Facing resistance from exhibitors to showing a black and white film, Cozzi instead licensed a negative of ''Godzilla, King of the Monsters'' from Toho and created a new movie in color, adding lots of stock footage of graphic death and destruction and short scenes from newsreel footage from World War II, which he released as ''[[Godzilla (1977 film)|Godzilla]]'' in 1977. The film was colorized using a process called Spectrorama 70, where color gels are put on the original black and white film, becoming one of the first black and white movies to be colorized. Dialogue was dubbed into Italian and new music was added. After the initial Italian run, the negative became Toho's property and prints have only been exhibited in Italy. Italian firm Yamato Video at one time intended to release the colorized version on a double DVD along with the original ''Godzilla''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scifijapan.com/articles/2009/05/31/talking-cozzilla-an-interview-with-italian-godzilla-director-luigi-cozzi/ |title=Talking COZZILLA: An Interview with Italian GODZILLA Director Luigi Cozzi |publisher=SciFi Japan |accessdate=November 11, 2012 |last=Desentis |first=John}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|pp=207}}{{sfn|Ryfle|1998|pp=208}}

=== Guest appearances ===
In 2007, a [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] Godzilla appeared in the Toho [[slice of life]] movie ''[[Always Zoku Sanchōme no Yūhi]]'' (''Always: Sunset on Third Street 2''). In an imaginary sequence, Godzilla destroys part of 1959 Tokyo, with one of the main protagonists getting angry that Godzilla damaged his car showroom. The making of the sequence was kept a secret. Godzilla has been referenced and has briefly appeared in several other films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

{{Refimprove section|date=August 2016}}

=== Television ===
In Japan, Godzilla appeared in five out of 26 episodes of Toho's live-action ''[[Zone Fighter]]'' television program in 1973. Also in Japan, Godzilla (along with a plethora of other kaiju) appeared in an animated toy show called ''[[Godzilla Island]]'' that ran in 1997–1998.

Between 1994 and 1996, four 30 minute episode [[Original video animation|OVA's]] were created featuring Godzilla and various other kaiju from the Showa series of movies. The characters were depicted in a cute and friendly '[[chibi (term)|chibi]]'-esque anime style. The series of OVA's was titled ''Godzilland'' (ゴジランド ''Gojirando'') and was aimed at primary school age children. This series featured [[Godzilla]] (the main protagonist), Gojirin (a pink female version of Godzilla), [[Minilla]] (Godzilla Junior), [[Mothra]] (and two Mothra larvae), [[King Ghidorah]], [[Gigan]], [[Hedorah]] (who is depicted as female in this adaptation), [[Moguera]], [[Rodan]], [[Baragon]], [[Mechagodzilla]], [[Anguirus]] and [[Ebirah]]. ''Godzilland'' was conceived initially to sell merchandise for the ''Godzill''a franchise. The depictions of Godzilla and the various other kaiju were featured on stickers, toys, cards and board games.

The educational media company [[Gakken]] and the film studio [[Toho]] collaborated together to release two additional direct-to-video shorts of ''Godzilland'' which were both called ''Recommend! Godzilland'' (すすめ！ゴジランド ''Susume! Gojirando'') in 1994. The main purpose of the first of the two video shorts was teaching Japanese children how to write in Hiragana (すすめ!ゴジランド～ひらがな – ''Susume! Gojirando ~ Hi-ra ga na'') and the other was intended to teach Japanese children how to count. ( すすめ!ゴジランド～かず1・2・3 – ''Susume! Gojirando ~ kazu 1 2 3''). Both specials featured all the characters who were in the ''Godzilland'' TV anime series. Two other TV specials were released two years later by the same company, but had different educational topics. These two specials were centered around math. The first of these two specials was called "すすめ！ゴジランド-ゴジラとあそぼう たしざん – ''Susume! Gojirando – Gojira to asobouta shizan'' and the second was titled "すすめ！ゴジランド ゴジラとあそぼう ひきざん – ''Susume! Gojirando Gojira to asobou hiki zan''. These two specials centered around addition and subtraction.
The episodes of ''Recommend! Godzilland'' was directed by Seinosuke Tanaka &amp; Osamu Nakayama.

''Hi-ra ga na'' and ''kazu 1 2 3'' were the only two episodes to use both cel animation and digital ink and paint animation, but ''Gojira to asobouta shizan'' and ''Gojira to asobou hiki zan'' were the only episodes to fully use digital ink and paint animation.

''Godzilland'' also included live action segments, which featured a human girl and an actor in a Godzilla suit. The segments would consist of Godzilla telling the girl about his childhood adventures.

The success of the ''Godzilla'' franchise has spawned two American [[Saturday morning cartoon]] TV series: the first one is the collaboration series produced by [[Hanna-Barbera|Hanna-Barbera Productions]] and co-produced by [[Toho]], ''[[Godzilla (animated series)|Godzilla]]'', and the second one produced by [[Sony Pictures Television]], ''[[Godzilla: The Series]]'', a cartoon sequel to the [[1998 film]]. Both series feature a scientific investigative team who call upon Godzilla as an ally, as well as making several homages to the Shōwa films. Several antagonist monsters in both series have been inspired by extant Toho creations.

In 1991, two ''Godzilla'' films, ''Godzilla vs. Megalon'' and ''Godzilla versus the Sea Monster'', were shown on the movie-mocking TV show ''[[Mystery Science Theater 3000]]''.

A creature resembling Godzilla in parody, alongside another parody character resembling what appears to be a cross between [[Ultraman]] and [[Kamen Rider]], appears in the television special ''[[Olive the Other Reindeer|Olive, The Other Reindeer]]'' during the song "Merry Christmas After All", during part of which Olive, Santa, and the other reindeer are shown passing through Tokyo delivering gifts. The two characters are shown to be friendly and taking part in the song and dance routine shown to include numerous figures, both real and fictional, in the show in various locations visited by the team as they make Santa's annual trip around the world.

Godzilla made an appearance in a [[Godzilla vs. Charles Barkley|Nike commercial]] in which Godzilla (this version was created at ILM) went one-on-one in an oversized basketball game with a giant version of the NBA star [[Charles Barkley]].

Godzilla has been referenced multiple times in the American animated TV sitcom ''[[The Simpsons]]''. Godzilla first appeared in the episode "[[Lisa on Ice]]" when Lisa imagines herself on Monster Island and is chased by various kaiju, including Godzilla. It has also been referenced in "[[Treehouse of Horror VI]]", "[[Mayored to the Mob]]" (where Godzilla can be seen signing autographs at [[Bi-Mon-Sci-Fi-Con]]), "[[Thirty Minutes over Tokyo]]" (in which the plane carrying the Simpson family is being attacked by Godzilla, Rodan, Mothra and Gamera), "[[Simpsons Tall Tales]]", "[[Treehouse of Horror XVI]]", "[[Homerazzi]]", "[[Wedding for Disaster]]", "[[The Real Housewives of Fat Tony]]", "[[Treehouse of Horror XXIV]]" and "[[Treehouse of Horror XXVI]]".

=== Video games ===
{{Main|List of Godzilla games}}

A game called ''Gojira-kun'' (which was originally going to be titled ''Gojiraland'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tcrf.net/Godzilla-kun|title=Godzilla-kun – The Cutting Room Floor|work=tcrf.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; was released for the [[MSX]] in 1985. The art style is similar to the style used in the ''Godzilland'' [[Original video animation|OVA]]'s. In 1990, ''Gojira-kun: Kaijū Daikōshin'' was released for the Game Boy. It featured sprites that were similar to the ones used in ''Gojira-kun''. The game included cut scenes that depicted a different style to the rest of the game. In 1993, ''[[Super Godzilla]]'' 's Bagan, a newly created Toho-approved creation, was released for the SNES and featured original monsters that were video game-only kaiju in a former film/movie. 

In 2007, ''[[Godzilla: Unleashed]]'' Krystalak and Obsidius, two newly created Toho-approved creations, was released for the Wii and DS and featured original monsters that were video game-only kaiju. Legendary's Godzilla was featured as a playable character in Bandai Namco's 2014 video game ''[[Godzilla (2014 video game)|Godzilla]]'' as "Hollywood Godzilla".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamestop.com/ps4/games/godzilla/119160|title=Godzilla for PlayStation 4|work=Gamestop|date=|accessdate=May 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The widely popular video game ''[[Pokémon]]'' has made multiple references to Godzilla. The Dark/Rock type Pokémon [[Tyranitar]] is a direct reference to Godzilla. The Pokémon's appearance is a large green lizard monster-type creature who is characterised as an unstoppable force. In 2015–present, ''Gojira'' and ''Godzilla 2600'' from [[Homebrew (video games)|Homebrew]] fangame were released for the NES and Atari 2600.

=== Literature ===
{{Main|Godzilla (comics)}}
A ''Godzilla'' [[Godzilla (Marc Cerasini series)|series of books]] was published by [[Random House]] during the late 1990s. The company created different series for different age groups, the [[Godzilla (Scott Ciencin series)|Scott Ciencin series]] being aimed at preteens and the [[Godzilla (Marc Cerasini series)|Marc Cerasini series]] being aimed at teens and young adults. Several [[manga]] have been derived from specific ''Godzilla'' films and both [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] and [[Dark Horse Comics|Dark Horse]] have published ''Godzilla'' comic book series (1977–1979 and 1987–1999, respectively). In 2011, IDW Publishing started a new series ''Godzilla: Kingdom of Monsters'' rebooting the Godzilla story. It was followed by two sequel series, ''Godzilla'' (published in book form as ''Godzilla: History's Greatest Monster'') and ''Godzilla: Rulers of Earth'', as well as seven five-issue miniseries to date.

To tie-in with the 2014 film, three books were published. [[Titan Books]] published a novelization of the movie in May 2014, written by Greg Cox. The graphic novel ''Godzilla: Awakening'' by Max Borenstein, Greg Borenstein and Eric Battle served as a prequel, and ''Godzilla: The Art of Destruction'' by Mark Cotta told about the making of the movie. Godzilla has been referenced in ''[[The Simpsons]]'' comics on three separate occasions.

The British band [[Lostprophets]] released a song called "[[We Are Godzilla, You Are Japan]]" on its second studio album ''[[Start Something]]''.

== Cultural impact ==
{{Main|Godzilla in popular culture}}

Godzilla is one of the most recognizable symbols of [[Japanese popular culture]] worldwide and is an important facet of Japanese films, embodying the [[Kaijū|kaiju]] subset of the tokusatsu genre. It has been considered a filmographic [[metaphor]] for the United States (with the "[[-zilla]]" part of the name being used in vernacular language as a suffix to indicate something of exaggerated proportions), as well as an allegory of nuclear weapons in general. The earlier ''Godzilla'' films, especially the original ''Godzilla'', portrayed Godzilla as a frightening, nuclear monster. Godzilla represented the fears that many Japanese held about the nuclear attacks on [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]] and the possibility of recurrence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/~haroldfs/popcult/handouts/metaphor/godzilla/godzilla.html |title=The Monster That Morphed Into a Metaphor |author=Terrence Rafferty |date=May 2, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At least two [[prehistoric creatures]] from the [[fossil record]] have been named after Godzilla. ''[[Gojirasaurus]] quayi'' is a [[theropod]] [[dinosaur]] that lived in the [[Triassic Period]]; a partial skeleton was unearthed in [[Quay County, New Mexico]].&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://dinosaurs.about.com/od/carnivorousdinosaurs/p/gojirasaurus.htm|title=Gojirasaurus|last=Strauss|first=Bob|work=About.com:Dinosaurs|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=17 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Dakosaurus andiniensis]]'', a [[crocodile]] from the [[Jurassic Period]], was nicknamed "Godzilla" before being [[scientific classification|scientifically classified]]. In 2010 the [[Sea Shepherd Conservation Society]] named their most recently acquired scout vessel MV ''Gojira''. Toho, the people in charge of the ''Godzilla'' franchise, served them with a notice to remove the name and in response the boat's name was changed in May 2011 to [[MV Brigitte Bardot|MV ''Brigitte Bardot'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.seashepherd.org/news-and-media/news-110525-1.html |title=The Beast Transforms into a Beauty as Godzilla Becomes the Brigitte Bardot – Sea Shepherd Conservation Society |publisher=Seashepherd.org |date=2011-05-25 |accessdate=2013-10-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110703225105/http://www.seashepherd.org/news-and-media/news-110525-1.html |archivedate=2011-07-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting of hell icons, known as ''adopis''&lt;ref name="Adopis"/&gt; or "hellography" (as opposed to [[iconography]]), was also a type of [[black magic]] in [[History of Russia|medieval Russia]].

Hell icons were first mentioned in the ''Life of [[Basil Fool for Christ|St. Basil]]'' (the 16th century): Basil threw a rock at the icon of [[Virgin Mary]] before the eyes of the astonished crowd of [[pilgrim]]s. Then he allegedly showed that the image of the devil was hidden under the paint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Panchenko|first=Alexander|authorlink=Alexander Panchenko (philologist)|editor=[[Dmitry Likhachov]]|title=History of Russian Medieval Literature|url=http://odrl.pushkinskijdom.ru/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=cjuqX9-nX9E%3d&amp;tabid=2275|series=History of Russian medieval literature|volume=29|year=1974|publisher=Nauka|language=Russian|pages=144–153|chapter=Foolishness for Christ as a spectacle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Messages about hell icons appeared in newspaper articles and the literature of the 19th century, but such articles reported only the later icons of "cheap and clumsily painting."&lt;ref name="Adopis"/&gt; [[Nikolai Leskov]], who was interested in Christian iconography, included a reference to hell icons in his story ''The Sealed Angel'' (1872) and in short article "On hell icons" ({{lang-ru|Об адописных иконах}}), published in 1873.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Leskov|first=Nikolai|date=July 24, 1873|title=On hell icons (Ob adopisnyh ikonah)|journal=Russkij mir|issue=192}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Despite these studies, in the 20th century Russian linguist [[Nikita Tolstoy]] doubted the fact of their real existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tolstoy|first=Nikita|authorlink=Nikita Tolstoy|title=Engraving and folklore in Russia in the 18th and 19th centuries|year=1976|language=Russian|pages=310–311|chapter=From the notes on Slavic demonology}}&lt;/ref&gt; This point of view is shared by modern art critics due to lack of material evidence (all such icons, if ever existed, have been lost).

The '''''High School Musical'' franchise''' consists of three [[Disney]] [[Musical film|musical]] [[romantic comedy|romantic]] [[comedy-drama]] films directed by [[Kenny Ortega]] and created by [[Peter Barsocchini]] with a fourth installment in pre-production. It stars [[Zac Efron]], [[Vanessa Hudgens]], [[Ashley Tisdale]], [[Lucas Grabeel]], [[Corbin Bleu]], and [[Monique Coleman]]. The [[High School Musical|original film]] was released simply as a [[Disney Channel Original Movie]], but after its huge success, it was followed by a [[High School Musical 2|television sequel]]. The [[High School Musical 3: Senior Year|third film]] received a theatrical release.

===''High School Musical'' (2006)===
{{main|High School Musical}}
''High School Musical'' was released on January 20, 2006 as a [[Disney Channel Original Movie]] (DCOM), and was the most successful DCOM ever produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/nielsens-charts.htm|title=Nielsen ratings for week of May 20 - USATODAY.com|author=|date=|website=usatoday.com|accessdate=April 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was Disney Channel's most watched DCOM in 2006, with 7.7 million viewers for its premiere broadcast in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2007-08-09-high-school-musical2_N.htm |work=USA Today |title=Can 'High School Musical' do it again? |first=Bill |last=Keveney |date=August 13, 2007 |accessdate=2010-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 789,000 viewers for its UK premiere. It was the first DCOM ever to be broadcast by BBC on December 29, 2006, and has been viewed by over 225 million people worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.disneychannelmedianet.com/include_file/facts/DisneyChannelFacts.pdf|title=DisneyChannelFacts|publisher=Disney Channel|accessdate=2009-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first film's leads were Zac Efron, Vanessa Hudgens, Ashley Tisdale and Lucas Grabeel, who sang most of the songs.

The film follows star athlete Troy Bolton ([[Zac Efron]]) and shy, smart Gabriella Montez ([[Vanessa Hudgens]]). Troy and Gabriella meet while vacationing at a ski lodge over Christmas Break and inadvertently participate in a karaoke contest together ("Start of Something New"). When school starts in January, drama queen Sharpay Evans ([[Ashley Tisdale]]) makes a dramatic entrance at East High, Troy's school. At this point, Gabriella is revealed to be a new transfer student to the school; she and Troy reconnect. Later that day, the pair are seen talking at the sign-up sheet for the Winter Musical by Sharpay. Her twin brother and co-president Ryan ([[Lucas Grabeel]]) notices that Troy seems interested in the sign-up sheet. Sharpay learns that Gabriella was a top student at her old schools and convinces Scholastic Decathlon captain Taylor McKessie ([[Monique Coleman]]) to invite Gabriella to the team as a distraction from auditioning. Troy's best friend, Chad Danforth ([[Corbin Bleu]]), is concerned that Troy's mind seems to have wandered away from basketball despite being varsity team captain and struggles to keep his attention.

As the day of auditions quickly approaches, Troy and Gabriella are too shy to come forward, after watching Sharpay and Ryan perform their own flashy arrangement of a love song ("What I've Been Looking For"). Kelsi Nielsen ([[Olesya Rulin]]), the composer and writer of the musical, objects, but is ridiculed by Sharpay. Following the audition, Troy and Gabriella pluck up the courage to come forward, but drama teacher Ms. Darbus ([[Alyson Reed]]) declares it too late to audition, and they are left crestfallen. As they are about to leave, Kelsi trips and drops her music. After helping her pick it up, they listen to her play the intended version of the song. Ms. Darbus overhears Troy and Gabriella singing and invites them to a callback.

When the school finds out that Troy and Gabriella have auditioned for the Winter Musical, everyone fears the status quo of the school is drastically changing, and Sharpay gets frustrated and worried ("Stick to the Status Quo"). Chad and Taylor are afraid that their respective teams will fall to pieces, so the pair stage individual interventions and get Troy and Gabriella to change their minds about their respective auditions. This particularly affects Gabriella, who now believes that Troy didn't really care about their friendship ("When There Was Me And You"). Upon realizing the damage they have caused, Chad and Taylor's respective groups feel guilty and fix the situation. When word comes that Troy and Gabriella are still interested in auditioning, Sharpay and Ryan convince Ms. Darbus to change the date of the callbacks to the same date as the game and the Decathlon. The pair go on as planned with their audition ("Bop to the Top"). Fearful that their friends will be unable to attend the callbacks, Chad and Taylor stage a school-wide computer glitch that forces the whole school to stop the game and the Decathlon, and lead all the students into the auditorium. When Troy and Gabriella are late, Ms. Darbus considers cancelling Troy and Gabriella's callback; however, they arrive in the nick of time and sing ("[[Breaking Free]]"). In the end, Ms. Darbus decides to award the lead roles to Troy and Gabriella, making Sharpay and Ryan [[Understudy|understudies]]. Sharpay is saddened that she didn't get the lead role in the musical, but does not retain any hard feelings. The film ends with the entire school gathering in the gym to celebrate East High's basketball victory ("We're All in This Together").

In a post-credits scene, Zeke Baylor ([[Chris Warren Jr.]]) is the only one left in the gym; he's approached by Sharpay, who has developed a love for his baking.

===''High School Musical 2'' (2007)===
{{main|High School Musical 2}}
It's the end of the school year, and everyone's excited for summer vacation ("[[What Time Is It? (song)|What Time is It?]]"). Gabriella is happy to finally be spending her summer vacation without having to move. When the whole gang gets hired at Lava Springs Country Club as summer help, resident drama queen Sharpay, whose parents own the club, is concerned that the Wildcats are once again marching in on her territory ("[[Fabulous (High School Musical 2 song)|Fabulous]]"). While taking time out of her day to convince club manager Mr. Fulton (Mark L. Taylor) to intimidate the Wildcats into quitting ("Work This Out").

Meanwhile, the club is preparing for the end-of-summer talent show, and the piano-playing Kelsi has written a special ballad especially for Troy and Gabriella ("[[You Are the Music in Me]]"), one that Sharpay would like rearranged for just her and Troy.  Sharpay schemes to win over Troy by offering him various luxuries, including a chance for a college scholarship. Although Troy says he's committed to his relationship with Gabriella, Gabriella grows concerned after hearing he's spending more time with Sharpay. When Ryan discovers that Sharpay is no longer interested in his talent due to her pursuit of Troy, he finds himself spending more time with the Wildcats, even playing against Chad in a staff baseball game ("[[I Don't Dance (Lucas Grabeel song)|I Don't Dance]]"), one that Troy skips to attend a college hoops practice which Sharpay has indirectly set up. Ryan even goes so far as to secretly prepare a special dance number for the Wildcats to perform at the talent show. When Sharpay stumbles upon the Wildcats' rehearsal, she orders Mr. Fulton, to disallow all Junior Staff to partake in the talent show, namely the Wildcats. Fulton draws up a quick memo and pushes Activities Director, Taylor (Monique Coleman), to notify the staff.

Troy's good mood suddenly turns sour when everyone starts ignoring him. After a devastating rehearsal with Sharpay for the talent show ("You Are the Music in Me (Reprise)"), Troy loses Gabriella ("Gotta Go My Own Way"), who informs him of her frustration with Sharpay's scheme and quits her job at Lava Springs. He discovers the reason for his friends' coldness when Kelsi quietly passes him Mr. Fulton's memo ("Bet on It"). An angry Troy then confronts Sharpay and tells her he has to break his promise and not sing with her. When Chad and the Wildcats find out he's no longer singing in the show, they push him to go back to Sharpay, and only moments before the show does Ryan tell Troy she picked a different song. When Troy announces his disappointment to Sharpay of the change, Sharpay is left surprised and confused- she never chose another song. As the final act, Troy is on stage singing solo, not knowing what to expect. Gabriella surprisingly comes back and joins him. The rest of the Wildcats soon come on stage as well to complete the musical number ("Everyday"). Sharpay learns her lesson in humility and is invited to join in; instead of awarding the Star Dazzle Trophy (given to the best act) to herself as usual, she chooses to give it to Ryan. Afterwards, the gang enjoys viewing the fireworks while Troy and Gabriella share their first kiss.

Everyone celebrates the end of the summer with a staff pool party ("All for One").

===''High School Musical 3: Senior Year'' (2008)===
{{main|High School Musical 3: Senior Year}}
It's the end of the Wildcats' championship basketball game against the West High Knights, where team captain Troy immediately rallies their spirits ("[[Now or Never (High School Musical song)|Now or Never]]"). At Troy's after-party, Troy and his girlfriend, Gabriella, are seen sitting in Troy's treehouse reflecting about the past year and picturing how their last few months at East High would end ("[[Right Here, Right Now (High School Musical song)|Right Here, Right Now]]").

The following week at East High, Sharpay made another dramatic entrance and Ms. Darbus is alarmed when few students sign up to audition for the Spring Musical, and Sharpay suggests that she perform a one-woman show. Quickly, the discouraged playwright, Kelsi, scribbles on the sign up sheet everyone in her homeroom class, including Sharpay, Ryan, Troy, Gabriella, and the less than enthusiastic Chad, Taylor, and other fellow Wildcats. Conclusively, Ms. Darbus announces that the Spring Musical will reflect the students' final days at East High. Ms. Darbus also announces that she will select one student for a [[Juilliard]] scholarship with Sharpay, Ryan, Kelsi, and Troy under consideration. Desperate to win the scholarship and knowing Kelsi will give the lead roles to Troy and Gabriella, Sharpay tries to persuade Ryan (Lucas Grabeel) to help her convince Kelsi to consider them instead by predicting their future in theater ("[[I Want It All (High School Musical song)|I Want It All]]").

Prom is around the corner, and Chad asks Taylor to be his date. She declines because she feels him to be unenthused about the event. Subsequently, Chad jumps onto a table and announces to the entire cafeteria that he is interested in having Taylor be his date, and she accepts ("[[A Night to Remember (High School Musical song)|A Night to Remember]]"). Meanwhile, Gabriella, in a surprise move, finds out that she has a chance to attend college really early. Sharpay told Troy that Gabriella is going to Stanford early. Troy encourages Gabriella to go, convinced that he is the only reason holding her back. However, on Prom night, Troy drives out to pick up Gabriella as East High is not the same without her. Days later, the play finally goes on as planned ("Spring Musical"), and Sharpay is prepared for the last musical at East High. At the close of the evening, Ms. Darbus announces that both Kelsi and Ryan each received the scholarship to Juilliard. Troy's final choice is Berkeley, a school not far from Gabriella's ("We're All in This Together (Graduation Mix)").

The film concludes with a big celebratory graduation ("High School Musical"), and then, like a stage musical, has closeups of the lead actors.

===''High School Musical 4''===
In early 2016, [[Disney]] announced that a fourth installment of the series was "in the works", later announcing a casting call for the film, tentatively referred to as ''High School Musical 4''.&lt;ref name="V-HSM4" /&gt;&lt;ref name="mtv4"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2748210/high-school-musical-4-officially-happening/ | title=‘HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL 4’ IS ACTUALLY, OFFICIALLY HAPPENING | work=MTV News | date=March 1, 2016 | accessdate=2016-10-14 | author=Roth, Madeline}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2016, details about the film's prospective principal characters were reported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/745490/high-school-musical-4-is-casting-ryan-and-sharpay-s-cousin-meet-the-new-wildcats|title=High School Musical 4 Is Casting Ryan and Sharpay's Cousin|author=|date=|website=eonline.com|accessdate=April 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Sharpay's Fabulous Adventure}}
''Sharpay's Fabulous Adventure'' is a direct-to video film and [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] starring [[Ashley Tisdale]].

The film takes place shortly after the graduation of the original cast. It starts with Sharpay Evans, the spin-off's protagonist, learning about the [[audition]] to a musical on Broadway. So, Sharpay travels to New York City with her dog Boi and meets Peyton Leverett ([[Austin Butler]]). Everything goes awry on such a "fabulous adventure" for Sharpay. One example includes Boi and another boy's ([[Bradley Steven Perry]]) dog running away. Searching for the pets, he and Sharpay find that the dogs are madly in love. By the end, Sharpay gets the part in a real Broadway musical and shares a kiss with Peyton. Then her twin brother Ryan Evans visits, to say that he is not in [[Juilliard]] with Kelsi as hinted in ''Senior Year''.

''High School Musical: The Challenge'' refers to the English name of a series of spin-offs of the American film ''High School Musical'' for the Latin American market, based on the book ''Battle of the Bands''. The films were scripted for a theatrical release and had eight new songs produced exclusively for the film.

The team captain discovers that the girl next door has changed a lot over the summer. Meanwhile, the mean girl is still as vain as ever and overshadows her poor brother and his "invisible" friends. When the school year begins, the school announces a "Battle of the Bands" contest. Working against the clock and with limited resources, both cliques pull their respective forces together for the big day. However, in an effort to win, dreams are thwarted, and only one band will be the winner.

However, Elley picked the three songs as "half-memorable": "the ballad 'Rainy Season' ({{lang|zh|梅雨季}}) [sung by] two lead[ing characters,] the glitzy 'Perfection' ({{lang|zh|完美}}) [by] the college rich-bitch[,] and [the] climatic 'I Can Fly' ({{lang|zh|我飛故我在}}), which doesn't quite succeed at being an {{sic|anthem|nal}}, uplifting ballad."&lt;ref name="Film Business"/&gt;

'''Kamchatkan''' (Kamchatic) is a former [[dialect cluster]] spoken on the [[Kamchatka Peninsula]]. It now consists of a single language, [[Itelmen language|Western Itelmen]] (also called Western Kamchadal). It had 100 or fewer speakers in 1991, mostly of the older generation. The Russian census of 2010 still reported 80 speakers.

There are incomplete records attesting of at least two other divergent varieties,  Eastern (also: Northern) Kamchadal and Southern Kamchadal, both extinct in the late 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.helsinki.fi/~tasalmin/nasia_report.html#SKamchadal Endangered languages in Northeast Asia: report]&lt;/ref&gt;

Kamchadal languages, though traditionally considered dialects, were apparently distinct enough to be classified as separate languages (Comrie 1981). The three varieties were spoken in western, eastern, and southern Kamchatka. The degree of difference can be illustrated with the pronoun 'we', which is [[Western Kamchadal|Western]] ''muza, muza'n'', [[Southern Kamchadal|Southern]] ''muš, burin'', [[Eastern Kamchadal|Eastern]] ''buze''.

Kamchatkan is not closely related to the [[Chukotkan languages]]. Although distant enough for doubts about its relationship to have been raised (as in Volodin 1976), cognate [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] clearly demonstrates that it forms a family with Chukotkan (Comrie 1981), though it also has some striking contrasts, especially in the area of [[phonology]]. The Chukotko-Kamchatkan proto-language has been partially reconstructed (Fortescue 2005).  

[[Michael Fortescue]] believes that Kamchatkan may have a substratum of a language formerly spoken by a remnant Beringian population (Fortescue 1998:210). For instance, Kamchatkan has [[ejective consonant|ejectives]], which are common among languages of the Pacific Northwest, but rare in languages of Northeast Asia.

[[Image:Maori girl in traditional dress.jpg|thumb|250px|Te Wai Ponamu Hona Paku ''[[Poi (performance art)|poi]]'']]
'''Kapa haka''' is the term for [[Māori people|Māori]] performing arts and literally means to form a line (kapa) and dance (haka). Kapa haka is an avenue for Māori people to express and showcase their heritage and cultural Polynesian identity through song and dance.

Kapa haka dates back to pre-European times where it developed from all traditional forms of Maori pastimes; haka, mau rakau (Maori weaponry), poi (ball attached to rope or string) and moteatea (traditional Maori songs). These everyday activities were influential to the development of kapa haka.

A kapa haka performance involves [[choir|choral singing]], [[dance]] and movements associated in the hand-to-hand combat practised by Māori in mainly precolonial times, presented in a synchronisation of action, timing, posture, footwork and sound. The genre evolved out of a combination of European and Māori musical principles.

== Performance practice ==
The work of a kapa haka consists of the performance of a suite of songs and dances spanning several types of [[Māori music|Māori music and dance]], strung together into a coherent whole. Music and dance types that normally appear are ''waiata tira'' (warm-up song), ''whakaeke'' (entrance song), ''waiata-ā-ringa'' (action song), ''[[haka]]'' (challenge), ''pou'' or ''mōteatea'' (old-style singing), ''[[Poi (juggling)|poi]]'' (co-ordinated swinging of balls attached to cords), and ''whakawātea'' (closing song). They may also include ''tītī tōrea'' (synchronised manipulation of thin sticks). In a full performance, which can last up to 40 minutes, each music or dance type may appear more than once.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://media.newzealand.com/en/story-ideas/kapa-haka-the-maori-performing-arts-story/|title=Kapa haka - the Māori performing arts story|website=TNZ Media|access-date=2017-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Music for kapa haka is primarily vocal. All song types, with the notable exceptions of mōteatea and haka, are structured around European-style harmony, frequently with guitar accompaniment and acoustics. Spurts of haka-style declamation are woven into the songs, as are dance movements, facial expressions and other bodily and aural signals unique to Māori. Song poetry is completely in [[Māori language|Māori]] and new material is continually being composed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aucklandlibraries.govt.nz/EN/maori/teaomaori/kapahaka/Pages/kapahaka.aspx|title=Kapa haka - performing arts|website=www.aucklandlibraries.govt.nz|language=en|access-date=2017-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sole musical instruments used in kapa haka performances are the [[guitar]], the ''pūtatara'' [[conch shell]], the sounds of ''poi'' and ''rākau'' (see below) and [[body percussion]], especially the stamping of feet.

Kapa haka are mixed groups of anywhere between several and dozens of people, dressed in neo-traditional Māori dress. These groups comprise individuals linked in some way, be it by extended family group, ''[[iwi]]'' (tribe), school, or some other association. Performers are largely synchronised, but with men sometimes doing some actions while women do others. A few performers have particular roles, such as the ''kaitataki'' (male and female leaders), often moving among the performers to urge them on. Composers, arrangers, choreographers and costume designers also play major roles.

Every two years, kapa haka from all parts of New Zealand compete in [https://web.archive.org/web/20060803063456/http://tematatini.org.nz/ Te Matatini], New Zealand's national Māori performing arts competition for adult groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.polynesia.com/manahua/history.html|title=History  {{!}} Te Manahua|website=www.polynesia.com|access-date=2017-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another important competition takes place yearly at the ASB Bank Auckland Secondary Schools Māori and Pacific Islands Cultural Festival, commonly known as [[Polyfest]], where the level of performance is also very high.

== Music and dance styles used by kapa haka ==
[[Image:Young Maori man dancing.jpg|thumb|250px|Young Māori man with [[taiaha]]]]
Not all Māori performance types are used by kapa haka. Below are brief descriptions of the ones that usually appear. See [[Māori music]] for a wider discussion of Māori music.

*'''Waiata tira''' are choral pieces used to warm up the vocal cords and introduce the group to the audience. Through a waiata tira the group announces its arrival in a manner that is generally light and positive.
*'''Whakaeke''' are also choral pieces. They are frequently used to comment on a social issue of the day or to commemorate an individual or some element of Māoridom. They may also simply be used as the entrance song to announce the group's arrival.
*'''[[Haka]]''' are best described as challenges. They are used to make a point and to vent anger. They are performed by both men and women, with the focus on the men in the front and support from the women behind. They are vocal performances involving rhythmic declamation in triple metre and aggressive or challenging facial expressions (''pūkana'', literally "glaring"), body movements and demeanour. The men make heavy use of foot stamping, body percussion, and grimace in an attempt to appear as menacing as possible. Haka are often described as traditional war dances but in fact had many other uses as well in precolonial Māori society, and have many peaceful uses today.
*'''Waiata-ā-ringa''' (literally "song of hands or arms") are "action songs", which means that they display the typical Polynesian practice of embellishing and reinforcing the sung poetry with arm and hand actions. They are performed by men and women with women in the front and men in the back. Some use melodies from common English-language songs with new lyrics in Māori, while others are newly composed, treating a wide variety of topics. They feature the ''wiri'' or trembling of the hands to indicate the interface between the mind and the body.
*'''[[Poi (juggling)|Poi]]''' are women's dances involving the swinging of balls, about the size of tennis balls, attached to cords. Poi's origins lie in the precolonial practice of training with poi to improve agility in battle, but today poi is used to showcase the beauty and gracefulness of the women. Poi were traditionally used by women on long Waka voyages as a mean of keeping timing of the male paddlers, in the style of a [[coxswain]]. This is the reason for the emphasis of the sound of the poi striking the hand. Performers swing the balls in synchrony in a variety of figures and rhythms while simultaneously singing a song (a ''waiata poi'') accompanied by guitar. They demonstrate great dexterity and coordination, particularly with "long poi", with cords up to a metre long, where four poi at once may be manipulated by each performer. Formerly the balls were made of [[Typha orientalis|raupo]] and the cords of [[flax]] but today they tend to be made of [[plastic shopping bag]] material and yarn. The sound of poi striking the hands is an important part of the musical accompaniment.
*'''Tītī tōrea''' are occasionally used by kapa haka. Tītī tōrea are pairs of carved thin sticks about shoulder width manipulated with dextrous wrist and arm work, often simultaneously passed between performers. Like poi, tītī tōrea figures are performed in synchrony and to music (and like poi, their sounds, especially that of the ends hitting the floor together, form a percussive accompaniment); and, also like poi, arose out of a precolonial warrior training technique.
*'''Pou''' or '''mōteatea''' are unison songs performed in a style reminisicent of precolonial Māori singing. They are an important genre within Maoridom because they tell stories in which historical, genealogical and cultural information is preserved and thus link Māori with their past. Mōteatea come in a variety of forms including laments, lullabies, and songs about revenge, anger, and love.
*'''Whakawātea''' are choral pieces used to farewell the audience or make a final point before departing the stage. They may pick up on themes raised in the whakaeke or comment on the event at hand. Performers are often at the side or back of the stage.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2256">'''Keywords''' are the words that academics use to reveal the internal structure of an author's 
reasoning.  While they are used primarily for [[rhetoric]], they are also used in a strictly 
grammatical sense for structural composition, reasoning, and comprehension.  Indeed, they are 
an essential part of any language.

There are many different types of keyword categories including: Conclusion, Continuation, Contrast,
Emphasis, Evidence, Illustration and Sequence. Each category serves its own function, as do the keywords
inside of a given category.

When someone uses a search engine, they type in one or more words describing what they are looking for:
'Norwich florist' or 'cheap holidays Greece', for example. These words or phrases are known as keywords.

==Corpus linguistic keywords==
In [[corpus linguistics]], key words are words that appear with statistically unusual frequency in a text
or a corpus of texts. They are identified by software that compares a word-list of the text with a word-list
based on a larger reference corpus. A suitable term for the phenomenon is [[keyness]]. The procedure used,
for example by [[WordSmith]], to list key words and phrases and plot where they appear in texts. These items
are very often of interest—particularly those human readers would not likely notice, such as prepositions,
time adverbs, and pronouns.

==Teaching Keywords==
One method used to teach keywords is called the "keyword method." It involves taking complex keywords that students do not know very well, and makes them into easier words. The easier words must have something to do with the complex keywords so students can correlate between the two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Uberti|first1=H. Z.|last2=Scruggs|first2=T.

[[File:Iznik pottery Miletus ware 15th century.jpg|thumb|İznik pottery, "Miletus ware", 15th century. Turkish and Islamic Arts Museum.]]
'''Miletus ware''' is a type of pottery that was produced in various locations in [[Anatolia]] between the late 14th and mid 15th centuries.&lt;ref name="Grabar"/&gt; The pottery was discovered through excavations in the 1930s by [[Friedrich Sarre]] at [[Miletus]], hence the ware's name. This pottery type was not produced at Miletus, but in other towns such as [[İznik]] and [[Kütahya]].&lt;ref name="Grabar"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cambridge"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=h2pLlRnZP04C&amp;pg=PA734 ''The Cambridge history of Islam'' by P. M. Holt, Ann K. S. Lambton, Bernard Lewis p.734]&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Atasoy|Raby|1994|pp=82-83}}

Miletus ware used red clay as a base, covered with white [[Slip (ceramics)|slip]], with simple designs in blue, [[turquoise (color)|turquoise]] and [[purple]].&lt;ref name="Taylor"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=h6GmFd4pAN4C&amp;pg=PA257 ''Imperial Istanbul: A Traveller's Guide: Includes Iznik, Bursa and Edirne'' by Jane Taylor p.257]&lt;/ref&gt; The design often incorporated "[[sunburst]]" and vegetal patterns.&lt;ref name="Grabar"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=9Jg3AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA53 ''Muqarnas: An Annual on Islamic Art and Architecture'' Oleg Grabar p.53]&lt;/ref&gt;

Miletus ware was superseded in the early 15th century by [[Iznik pottery]], with the introduction of white bodies instead of the red clays. However, there is a certain continuity in the colours used for the decoration.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=p9xJ-VpUuNkC&amp;pg=PA195 ''The science and archaeology of materials'' by Julian Henderson p.195]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ministry of Culture and Sports''' ({{lang-ar|وزارة الثقافة والرياضة|nativename_a    =}}) is the ministry responsible for administering [[Qatar|Qatar's]] cultural policies and programs. Its responsibilities include organizing cultural events, promoting cultural cooperation, publishing local literature and raising awareness of Qatar's culture.&lt;ref name="moc"/&gt; As of 2016, the ministry also presides over sport and youth club affairs. The current minister is H.E.Salah bin Ghanim Al Ali.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thebusinessyear.com/qatar-2015/cultural-gem/interview|title=Cultural gem|publisher=The Business Year|date=2015|accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Qatar's culture ministry has undergone several phases through its history until its official establishment in 2008. Prior to that year, the country's cultural policies were administered in tandem with other government ministries. In 1975, the first government department for culture was formed as part of the Ministry of Information. The ministry eventually integrated as the Ministry of Information and Culture in 1989. During [[Hamad Bin Abdulaziz Al-Kawari]] tenure as Minister of Information and Culture from 1992 to 1996, he took steps to reduce media censorship.&lt;ref name="moc"/&gt;

Qatar's government decided to delegate its cultural administration to the Ministry of Education in 1996, resulting in its reformation as the Ministry of Education and Culture.&lt;ref name="moc"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moc.gov.qa/English/Departments/Pages/aboutministry.aspx?bmv=a|title=Ministry of Culture, Arts and Heritage: Historic Glance|publisher=Ministry of Culture, Arts and Heritage|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150711082935/http://www.moc.gov.qa/English/Departments/Pages/aboutministry.aspx?bmv=a|archive-date=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The first stand-alone government agency for culture was established in 1998 as the National Council for Culture, Arts and Heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Ahmed Aly Khedr|url=http://www.nyulawglobal.org/globalex/Qatar.html|title=A Guide to Qatar’s Legal System|publisher=GlobaLex|date=July 2009|accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ten years later, the government replaced the National Council with the newly created Ministry of Culture, Arts and Heritage.&lt;ref name="moc"/&gt; In 2016, the Ministry of Culture, Arts and Heritage was merged with the Ministry of Youth and Sports (est. 2013) to form the Ministry of Culture and Sports.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.oxgaps.org/files/interview_al_ali.pdf|title=Interview: H.E. Salah bin Ghanem Al Ali - Minister of Culture and Sports - State of Qatar|publisher=Oxford Gulf &amp; Arabian Peninsula Forum|year=2016|accessdate=26 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
The Ministry of Culture is heavily involved in the coordination the Year of Culture initiatives which are organized primarily by the [[Qatar Museums Authority]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qna.org.qa/en-us/News/15102900120108/Minister-of-Culture-Confirms-Depth-of-Cultural-Relations-Between-Qatar-and-Turkey|title=Minister of Culture Confirms Depth of Cultural Relations Between Qatar and Turkey|publisher=Qatar News Agency|date=29 October 2015|accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initiative entails cultural exchanges and the hosting of cultural exhibitions and events which showcase the culture of a select country for a duration of one year. Its inaugural edition was held in 2012 and featured Japan as Qatar's cultural exchange partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.qm.org.qa/en/years-culture|title=Year of Culture - Building bridges between nations|publisher=Qatar Museums|accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2013, during the Qatar–UK Year of Culture, the ministry held an Arts and Disability Festival in [[Katara (cultural village)|Katara]]. It was the first major Arts and Disability Festival to take place in the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britishcouncil.qa/en/partnerships/success-stories/arts-disability|title=Arts and Disability Festival|publisher=British Council (Qatar)|accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Publications===
Mohammed Hassan Al Kuwari, lead researcher at the Ministry's Department of Research and Studies, oversaw the publication of four books in 2014: ''Cultural Publications of the Ministry of Culture, Arts and Heritage from 1976 to 2013'', ''The Directory of Qatari Authors'', ''The Directory of Cultural Institutions'', and ''The Directory of Photographers in Qatar''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.net/news/cultureandart/2014/11/13/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A5%D8%B9%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%85-%D9%88%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%AB-%D8%A8%D8%A5%D8%B5%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D9%84%D9%88%D8%B2%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AB%D9%82%D8%A7%D9%81%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%82%D8%B7%D8%B1%D9%8A%D8%A9|title=الإعلام والتراث بإصدارات لوزارة الثقافة القطرية|author=Saeed Dahri|location=Doha|publisher=Al Jazeera|language=Arabic|date=13 November 2014|accessdate=26 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
The ministry has several sections and departments for both cultural activities and publications or broadcasts. The Department of Press and Publications is involved in granting licenses, registering writers, and overseeing the censorship of publications. The Department of Communications oversees the conference of licenses while also presiding over the ministry's broadcasting stations. There is a Research Department which is in charge of the translation and research of publications. The Public Libraries Department has four separate sections and is mainly involved in making the ministry's latest publications accessible to the public.&lt;ref name="peninsula"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thepeninsulaqatar.com/news/qatar/156044/new-department-at-ministry-of-culture-for-licensing-publications|title=New department at Ministry of Culture for licensing publications|publisher=The Peninsula|date=17 June 2016|accessdate=25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultural activities are managed by the Department of Cultural Activities. The Department of Theatrical Activities handles the recording of the country's drama and theatre groups and is directly responsible for creating new theatre groups. Music and music groups are administered by the Department of Popular Arts and Music. There is also a Department of Visual Arts.&lt;ref name="peninsula"/&gt;

Other departments of the ministry include a Human Resources Department, a Finances and Administration Department and a Youth Centre Management Department.&lt;ref name="peninsula"/&gt;

In [[computer programming]], a '''naming convention''' is a set of rules for choosing the character sequence to be used for [[identifier]]s which denote [[Variable (computer science)|variables]], [[Data type|types]], [[Subroutine|functions]], and other entities in [[source code]] and [[Software documentation|documentation]].

Reasons for using a naming convention (as opposed to allowing [[programmer]]s to choose any character sequence) include the following:

* To reduce the effort needed to read and understand source code;&lt;ref&gt;Derek M. Jones [http://www.knosof.co.uk/cbook/oprandname.pdf "Operand names influence operator precedence decisions"] An experiment investigating the effect of variable names on operator precedence selection&lt;/ref&gt;
* To enable code reviews to focus on more important issues than arguing over syntax and naming standards.
* To enable code quality review tools to focus their reporting mainly on significant issues other than syntax and style preferences.

The choice of naming conventions can be an enormously controversial issue, with partisans of each holding theirs to be the best and others to be inferior. Colloquially, this is said to be a matter of [[dogma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Raymond |first=Eric S. |authorlink=Eric S. Raymond |encyclopedia=The [[Jargon File]] |title=religious issues |url=http://www.catb.org/jargon/html/R/religious-issues.html |accessdate=7 November 2011 |edition=version 4.4.8 |date=1 October 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many companies have also established their own set of conventions.

==Potential benefits==
Some of the potential benefits that can be obtained by adopting a naming convention include the following:

* to provide additional information (i.e., [[metadata]]) about the use to which an identifier is put;
* to help formalize expectations and promote [[consistency]] within a development team;
* to enable the use of automated [[refactoring]] or search and replace tools with minimal potential for error;
* to enhance clarity in cases of potential ambiguity;
* to enhance the aesthetic and professional appearance of work product (for example, by disallowing overly long names, comical or "cute" names, or abbreviations);
* to help avoid "naming collisions" that might occur when the work product of different organizations is combined (see also: [[namespaces]]);
* to provide meaningful data to be used in project handovers which require submission of program source code and all relevant documentation;
* to provide better understanding in case of code reuse after a long interval of time.

==Challenges==

The choice of naming conventions (and the extent to which they are enforced) is often a contentious issue, with partisans holding their viewpoint to be the best and others to be inferior.  Moreover, even with known and well-defined naming conventions in place, some organizations may fail to consistently adhere to them, causing inconsistency and confusion.  These challenges may be exacerbated if the naming convention rules are internally inconsistent, arbitrary, difficult to remember, or otherwise perceived as more burdensome than beneficial.

==Readability==
Well-chosen identifiers make it significantly easier for developers and analysts to understand what the system is doing and how to fix or extend the [[source code]] to apply for new needs.

For example, although the statement
&lt;source lang="C"&gt;
 a = b * c;
&lt;/source&gt;

is [[Syntax (programming languages)|syntactically]] correct, its purpose is not evident. Contrast this with:
&lt;source lang="C"&gt;
 weekly_pay = hours_worked * hourly_pay_rate;
&lt;/source&gt;

which implies the intent and meaning of the source code, at least to those familiar with the context of the statement.

==Common elements==
{{unreferenced section|date=September 2010}}
The exact rules of a naming convention depend on the context in which they are employed. Nevertheless, there are several common elements that influence most if not all naming conventions in common use today.

===Length of identifiers===

Fundamental elements of all naming conventions are the rules related to '''identifier length''' (i.e., the finite number of individual characters allowed in an identifier). Some rules dictate a fixed numerical bound, while others specify less precise heuristics or guidelines.

Identifier length rules are routinely contested in practice, and subject to much debate academically.

Some considerations:
* shorter identifiers may be preferred as more expedient, because they are easier to type (although many IDEs and text-editors provide text-completion, which mitigates this)
* extremely short identifiers (such as 'i' or 'j') are very difficult to uniquely distinguish using automated search and replace tools (although this is not an issue for regex-based tools)
* longer identifiers may be preferred because short identifiers cannot encode enough information or appear too cryptic
* longer identifiers may be disfavored because of visual clutter

It is an open research issue whether some programmers prefer shorter identifiers because they are easier to type, or think up, than longer identifiers, or because in many situations a longer identifier simply clutters the visible code and provides no perceived additional benefit.

Brevity in programming could be in part attributed to:
* early [[Linker (computing)|linkers]] which required variable names to be restricted to 6 characters to save memory. A later "advance" allowed longer variable names to be used for human comprehensibility, but where only the first few characters were significant. In some versions of [[BASIC]] such as TRS-80 Level 2 Basic, long names were allowed, but only the first two letters were significant. This feature permitted erroneous behaviour that could be difficult to debug, for example when names such as "VALUE" and "VAT" were used and intended to be distinct.
* early [[source code editor]]s lacking [[autocomplete]]
* early low-resolution monitors with limited line length (e.g. only 80 characters)
* much of computer science originating from mathematics, where variable names are traditionally only a single letter

===Letter case and numerals===

Some naming conventions limit whether letters may appear in uppercase or lowercase. Other
conventions do not restrict letter case, but attach a well-defined interpretation based
on letter case. Some naming conventions specify whether alphabetic, numeric, or alphanumeric
characters may be used, and if so, in what sequence.

===Multiple-word identifiers===
A common recommendation is "Use meaningful identifiers."  A single [[word]] may not be as meaningful, or specific, as multiple words. Consequently, some naming conventions specify rules for the treatment of "compound" identifiers containing more than one word.

As most [[programming language]]s do not allow [[whitespace (computer science)|whitespace]] in identifiers, a method of delimiting each word is needed (to make it easier for subsequent readers to interpret which characters belong to which word). Historically some early languages, notably [[FORTRAN]] (1955) and [[ALGOL]] (1958), allowed spaces within identifiers, determining the end of identifiers by context. This was abandoned in later languages due to the difficulty of [[tokenization (lexical analysis)|tokenization]]. It is possible to write names by simply concatenating words, and this is sometimes used, as in &lt;code&gt;mypackage&lt;/code&gt; for Java package names,&lt;ref&gt;[https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/package/namingpkgs.html Naming a Package]&lt;/ref&gt; though legibility suffers for longer terms, so usually some form of separation is used.

====Delimiter-separated words====
One approach is to [[delimiter|delimit]] separate words with a [[alphanumeric|nonalphanumeric]] character.  The two characters commonly used for this purpose are the [[hyphen]] ("-") and the [[underscore]] ("_"); e.g., the two-word name "&lt;code&gt;two words&lt;/code&gt;" would be represented as "&lt;code&gt;two-words&lt;/code&gt;" or "&lt;code&gt;two_words&lt;/code&gt;".  The hyphen is used by nearly all programmers writing [[COBOL]] (1959), [[Forth (programming language)|Forth]] (1970), and [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]] (1958); it is also common in [[Unix]] for commands and packages, and is used in [[Cascading Style Sheets|CSS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = CSS reference |website = [[Mozilla Developer Network]] |url = https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference |access-date=2016-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; This convention has no standard name, though it may be referred to as ''lisp-case'' or ''COBOL-CASE'' (compare ''Pascal case''), ''kebab-case'', or other variants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = StackOverflow - What's the name for snake_case with dashes? | url = https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11273282/whats-the-name-for-snake-case-with-dashes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Programmers - If this is camelCase what-is-this? | url = http://programmers.stackexchange.com/questions/104468/if-this-is-camelcase-what-is-this }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Camel_SNAKE-kebab | url = https://github.com/qerub/camel-snake-kebab }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?UnderscoreVersusCapitalAndLowerCaseVariableNaming UnderscoreVersusCapitalAndLowerCaseVariableNaming]&lt;/ref&gt; Of these, ''kebab-case'', dating at least to 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://stackoverflow.com/posts/12273101/revisions |title=Revisions to jwfearn's answer to What's the name for dash-separated case? |date=5 September 2012 |author=jwfearn}}&lt;/ref&gt; has achieved some currency since.&lt;ref&gt;''Living Clojure'' (2015), by Carin Meier, [https://books.google.com/books?id=b4odCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA91 p. 91]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://lodash.com/docs#kebabCase lodash: kebabCase]&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, languages in the FORTRAN/ALGOL tradition, notably languages in the [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[Pascal (programming language)|Pascal]] families, used the hyphen for the [[subtraction]] [[infix notation|infix]] operator, and did not wish to require spaces around it (as [[free-form language]]s), preventing its use in identifiers. An alternative is to use underscores; this is common in the C family (including Python), with lowercase words, being found for example in ''[[The C Programming Language]]'' (1978), and has come to be known as [[snake case]]. Underscores with uppercase, as in UPPER_CASE, are commonly used for [[C preprocessor]] macros, hence known as MACRO_CASE, and for [[environment variable]]s in Unix, such as BASH_VERSION in [[bash (Unix shell)|bash]]. Sometimes this is humorously referred to as SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE.

====Letter case-separated words====
{{See also|Letter case#Special case styles}}
Another approach is to indicate word boundaries using medial capitalization, called "[[CamelCase]]", "Pascal case", and many other names, thus rendering "&lt;code&gt;two words&lt;/code&gt;" as either "&lt;code&gt;twoWords&lt;/code&gt;" or "&lt;code&gt;TwoWords&lt;/code&gt;". This convention is commonly used in Pascal, [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[C Sharp (programming language)|C#]], and [[Visual Basic]]. Treatment of acronyms in identifiers (e.g. the "[[XML]]" and "[[HTTP]]" in &lt;code&gt;[[XMLHttpRequest]]&lt;/code&gt;) varies. Some dictate that they be lowercased (e.g. &lt;code&gt;XmlHttpRequest&lt;/code&gt;) to ease typing and readability, whereas others leave them uppercased (e.g. &lt;code&gt;XMLHTTPRequest&lt;/code&gt;) for accuracy.

==Metadata and hybrid conventions==
Some naming conventions represent rules or requirements that go beyond the requirements
of a specific project or problem domain, and instead reflect a greater
overarching set of principles defined by the [[software architecture]], underlying [[programming language]] or other kind of cross-project methodology.

===Hungarian notation===

Perhaps the most well-known is [[Hungarian notation]], which encodes either the purpose ("Apps Hungarian") or the [[datatype|type]] ("Systems Hungarian") of a variable in its name.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Wrong.html&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, the prefix "sz" for the variable szName indicates that the variable is a null-terminated string.

===Positional notation===

A style used for very short (8 characters and less) could be: LCCIIL01, where LC would be the application (Letters of Credit), C for COBOL, IIL for the particular process subset, and the 01 a sequence number.

This sort of convention is still in active use in mainframes dependent upon [[Job Control Language|JCL]] and is also seen in the 8.3 (maximum 8 characters with period separator followed by 3 character file type) MS-DOS style.

===Composite word scheme (OF Language)===

IBM's "OF Language" was documented in an IMS ([[Information Management System]]) manual.

It detailed the PRIME-MODIFIER-CLASS word scheme, which consisted of names like "CUST-ACT-NO" to indicate "customer account number".

PRIME words were meant to indicate major "entities" of interest to a system.

MODIFIER words were used for additional refinement, qualification and readability.

CLASS words ideally would be a very short list of data types relevant to a particular application.  Common CLASS words might be: NO (number), ID (identifier), TXT (text), AMT (amount), QTY (quantity), FL (flag), CD (code), W (work) and so forth.  In practice, the available CLASS words would be a list of less than two dozen terms.

CLASS words, typically positioned on the right (suffix), served much the same purpose as [[Hungarian notation]] prefixes.

The purpose of CLASS words, in addition to consistency, was to specify to the programmer the [[data type]] of a particular data field. Prior to the acceptance of BOOLEAN (two values only) fields, FL (flag) would indicate a field with only two possible values.

==Language-specific conventions==
===ActionScript===
Adobe's Coding Conventions and Best Practices suggests naming standards for [[ActionScript]] that are mostly consistent with those of [[ECMAScript]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}} The style of identifiers is similar to that of [[Java (programming language)|Java]].

===Ada===
In [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]], the only recommended style of identifiers is &lt;code&gt;Mixed_Case_With_Underscores&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.adaic.org/resources/add_content/docs/95style/html/sec_3/3-2-1.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===C and C++===
In [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[C++]], [[keyword (computer programming)|keyword]]s and [[standard library]] identifiers are mostly lowercase. In the [[C standard library]], abbreviated names are the most common (e.g. &lt;code&gt;isalnum&lt;/code&gt; for a function testing whether a character is alphanumeric), while the [[C++ standard library]] often uses an underscore as a word separator (e.g. &lt;code&gt;out_of_range&lt;/code&gt;). Identifiers representing [[C preprocessor#Macro definition and expansion|macros]] are, by convention, written using only uppercase letters and underscores (this is related to the convention in many programming languages of using all-upper-case identifiers for constants). Names containing double underscore or beginning with an underscore and a capital letter are reserved for implementation ([[compiler]], [[standard library]]) and should not be used (e.g. &lt;code&gt;__reserved&lt;/code&gt; or  &lt;code&gt;_Reserved&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | authorlink = ISO | title = ISO/IEC 9899:1999 Programming languages -- C | publisher = ISO | url = http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=29237}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | authorlink = ISO | title = ISO/IEC 14882:2011 Information technology -- Programming languages -- C++ | publisher = ISO | url = http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=50372}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is superficially similar to [[Stropping (syntax)|stropping]], but the semantics differ: the underscores are part of the value of the identifier, rather than being quoting characters (as is stropping): the value of &lt;code&gt;__foo&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;code&gt;__foo&lt;/code&gt; (which is reserved), not &lt;code&gt;foo&lt;/code&gt; (but in a different namespace).

===Go===
In [[Go (programming language)|Go]], the convention is to use &lt;code&gt;[[MixedCaps]]&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;mixedCaps&lt;/code&gt; rather than underscores to write multiword names.&lt;ref&gt;https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html#mixed-caps&lt;/ref&gt;

===Java===
In [[Java (programming language)|Java]], naming conventions for identifiers have been established and suggested by various Java communities such as Sun Microsystems,&lt;ref name="SunJavaCodeConv"&gt;"Code Conventions for the Java Programming Language", [http://java.sun.com/docs/codeconv/html/CodeConventions.doc8.html Section 9: "Naming Conventions"]&lt;/ref&gt; Netscape,&lt;ref&gt;"NETSCAPE'S SOFTWARE CODING STANDARDS GUIDE FOR JAVA",[http://collaboratory.emsl.pnl.gov/docs/collab/sam/CodeStandards.html Collab Software Coding Standards Guide for Java]&lt;/ref&gt; AmbySoft,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ambysoft.com/essays/javaCodingStandards.html "AmbySoft Inc. Coding Standards for Java v17.01d"]&lt;/ref&gt; etc. A sample of naming conventions set by Sun Microsystems are listed below,
where a name in "[[CamelCase]]" is one composed of a number of words joined without spaces, with each word's initial letter in capitals — for example "CamelCase".
{| class="wikitable" border="1"
|-
! Identifier type
! Rules for naming
! Examples
|-
| Classes
| Class names should be nouns in &lt;code&gt;Upper[[CamelCase]]&lt;/code&gt;, with the first letter of every word capitalised. Use whole words — avoid acronyms and abbreviations (unless the abbreviation is much more widely used than the long form, such as URL or HTML).
| 
* &lt;code&gt;class Raster {}&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;class ImageSprite {}&lt;/code&gt;
|-
| Methods
| Methods should be verbs in &lt;code&gt;lower[[CamelCase]]&lt;/code&gt; or a multi-word name that begins with a verb in lowercase; that is, with the first letter lowercase and the first letters of subsequent words in uppercase.
| 
* &lt;code&gt;run();&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;runFast();&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;getBackground();&lt;/code&gt;
|-
|Variables
|Local variables, instance variables, and class variables are also written in &lt;code&gt;lower[[CamelCase]]&lt;/code&gt;. Variable names should not start with underscore (&lt;code&gt;_&lt;/code&gt;) or dollar sign (&lt;code&gt;$&lt;/code&gt;) characters, even though both are allowed. This is in contrast to other [[coding conventions]] that state that underscores should be used to prefix all instance variables.

Variable names should be short yet meaningful. The choice of a variable name should be [[mnemonic]] —  that is, designed to indicate to the casual observer the intent of its use. One-character variable names should be avoided except for temporary "throwaway" variables. Common names for temporary variables are i, j, k, m, and n for integers; c, d, and e for characters.
|
* &lt;code&gt;int             i;&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;char            c;&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;float           myWidth;&lt;/code&gt;
|-
|Constants
|Constants should be written in uppercase characters separated by underscores. Constant names may also contain digits if appropriate, but not as the first character.
|
* &lt;code&gt;static final int MAX_PARTICIPANTS = 10;&lt;/code&gt;
|}
Java compilers do not enforce these rules, but failing to follow them may result in confusion and erroneous code. For example, &lt;code&gt;widget.expand()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Widget.expand()&lt;/code&gt; imply significantly different behaviours: &lt;code&gt;widget.expand()&lt;/code&gt; implies an invocation to method &lt;code&gt;expand()&lt;/code&gt; in an instance named &lt;code&gt;widget&lt;/code&gt;, whereas &lt;code&gt;Widget.expand()&lt;/code&gt; implies an invocation to static method &lt;code&gt;expand()&lt;/code&gt; in class &lt;code&gt;Widget&lt;/code&gt;.

&lt;!-- The stuff below was removed from the [[CamelCase]] article - needs merging with the above --&gt;
One widely used Java coding style dictates that &lt;tt&gt;[[CamelCase|UpperCamelCase]]&lt;/tt&gt; be used for [[class (computer science)|classes]] and &lt;tt&gt;[[CamelCase|lowerCamelCase]]&lt;/tt&gt; be used for [[instance (computer science)|instances]] and [[method (computer science)|methods]].&lt;ref name="SunJavaCodeConv" /&gt;
Recognising this usage, some [[Integrated development environment|IDEs]], such as [[Eclipse (IDE)|Eclipse]], implement shortcuts based on CamelCase. For instance, in Eclipse's [[content assist]] feature, typing just the upper-case letters of a CamelCase word will suggest any matching class or method name (for example, typing "NPE" and activating content assist could suggest &lt;code&gt;NullPointerException&lt;/code&gt;).

Initialisms of three or more letters are CamelCase instead of uppercase (e.g., &lt;code&gt;parseDbmXmlFromIPAddress&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;parseDBMXMLFromIPAddress&lt;/code&gt;). One may also set the boundary at two or more letters (e.g. &lt;code&gt;parseDbmXmlFromIpAddress&lt;/code&gt;).

===JavaScript===

The built-in JavaScript libraries use the same naming conventions as Java. Data types and constructor functions use upper camel case (&lt;tt&gt;RegExp&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;TypeError&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;XMLHttpRequest&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;DOMObject&lt;/tt&gt;) and methods use lower camel case (&lt;tt&gt;getElementById&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;getElementsByTagNameNS&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;createCDATASection&lt;/tt&gt;). In order to be consistent most JavaScript developers follow these conventions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://codeburst.io/5-javascript-style-guides-including-airbnb-github-google-88cbc6b2b7aa|title=5 JavaScript Style Guides - Including AirBnB, GitHub, &amp; Google|last1=Morelli|first1=Brandon|date=|website=codeburst.io|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=17 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
See also: [http://javascript.crockford.com/code.html Douglas Crockford's conventions]

===Lisp===
Common practice in most [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]] dialects is to use dashes to separate words in identifiers, as in &lt;code&gt;with-open-file&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;make-hash-table&lt;/code&gt;. Dynamic variable names conventionally start and end with asterisks: &lt;code&gt;*map-walls*&lt;/code&gt;. Constants names are marked by plus signs: &lt;code&gt;+map-size+&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gigamonkeys.com/book/variables.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cliki.net/Naming+conventions Naming conventions] on [[CLiki]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===.NET===
[[Microsoft]] [[Microsoft .NET|.NET]] recommends &lt;tt&gt;[[CamelCase|UpperCamelCase]]&lt;/tt&gt; for most identifiers. (&lt;tt&gt;[[CamelCase|lowerCamelCase]]&lt;/tt&gt; is recommended for [[parameter (computer science)|parameters]] and [[variable (programming)|variables]]) and is a shared convention for the .NET languages.&lt;ref&gt;[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms229043.aspx Microsoft .NET Framework Capitalization Styles]&lt;/ref&gt; Microsoft further recommends that no type prefix hints (also known as [[Hungarian notation]]) are used.&lt;ref&gt;[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms229045.aspx .NET Framework Developer's Guide - General Naming Conventions]&lt;/ref&gt;  Instead of using Hungarian notation it is recommended to end the name with the base class' name; &lt;code&gt;LoginButton&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;BtnLogin&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;[Framework Design Guidelines, Krzysztof Cwalina, Brad Abrams Page 62]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Objective-C===
[[Objective-C]] has a common coding style that has its roots in [[Smalltalk]] .

Top-level entities, including classes, protocols, categories, as well as C constructs that are used in Objective-C programs like global variables and functions, are in UpperCamelCase with a short all-uppercase prefix denoting namespace, like &lt;tt&gt;NSString&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;UIAppDelegate&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;NSApp&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;CGRectMake&lt;/tt&gt;. Constants may optionally be prefixed with a lowercase letter "k" like &lt;tt&gt;kCFBooleanTrue&lt;/tt&gt;.

Instance variables of an object use lowerCamelCase prefixed with an underscore, like &lt;tt&gt;_delegate&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;_tableView&lt;/tt&gt;.

Method names use multiple lowerCamelCase parts separated by colons that delimit arguments, like: &lt;tt&gt;application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;stringWithFormat:&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;isRunning&lt;/tt&gt;.

===Pascal, Modula-2 and Oberon===
Wirthian languages Pascal, Modula-2 and Oberon generally use &lt;code&gt;Capitalized&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;UpperCamelCase&lt;/code&gt; identifiers for programs, modules, constants, types and procedures, and &lt;code&gt;lowercase&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;lowerCamelCase&lt;/code&gt; identifiers for math constants, variables, formal parameters and functions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://modula-2.info/m2r10/pmwiki.php/Recommendations/NameConvention#Identifiers Modula-2 Name Convention]&lt;/ref&gt; While some dialects support underscore and dollar signs in identifiers, snake case and macro case is more likely confined to use within foreign API interfaces.&lt;ref&gt;[http://modula-2.info/m2r10/pmwiki.php/Recommendations/NameConvention#ForeignAPIIdentifiers Foreign API Identifiers in Modula-2 Name Convention]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Perl===
[[Perl]] takes some cues from its C heritage for conventions. Locally scoped variables and subroutine names are lowercase with infix underscores. Subroutines and variables meant to be treated as private are prefixed with an underscore. Package variables are title cased. Declared constants are all caps. Package names are camel case excepting pragmata—e.g., &lt;code&gt;strict&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;[[C3 linearization|mro]]&lt;/code&gt;—which are lowercase.
&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = Perl style guide | url = http://perldoc.perl.org/perlstyle.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = perlmodlib - constructing new Perl modules and finding existing ones | url = http://perldoc.perl.org/perlmodlib.html  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Perl 6===
[[Perl 6]] follows more or less the same conventions as Perl, except that it allows an infix hyphen – or an apostrophe ' (or single quote) within an identifier (but not two in a row), provided that it is followed by an alphabetic character. Perl 6 programmers thus often use ''kebab case'' in their identifiers; for example, 
&lt;code&gt;fish-food&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;don't-do-that&lt;/code&gt; are valid identifiers.
&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title = General rules of Perl 6 syntax | url = https://docs.perl6.org/language/syntax#Identifiers }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===PHP===
[[PHP]] recommendations are contained in PSR-1 ([[PHP Standard Recommendation]] 1) and PSR-2.&lt;ref name=PSR&gt;{{Cite web | title = PHP standards recommendations | url = http://www.php-fig.org/psr/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Python and Ruby ===
[[Python (programming language)|Python]] and [[Ruby (programming language)|Ruby]] both recommend &lt;code&gt;UpperCamelCase&lt;/code&gt; for class names, &lt;code&gt;CAPITALIZED_WITH_UNDERSCORES&lt;/code&gt; for constants, and &lt;code&gt;lowercase_separated_by_underscores&lt;/code&gt; for other names.

In Python, if a name is intended to be "[[private member|private]]", it is prefixed by an underscore. Private variables are only enforced by convention in Python. Names can also be suffixed with an underscore to prevent conflict with Python keywords. Prefixing with double underscores changes behaviour in classes with regard to [[name mangling#Python|name mangling]]. Prefixing ''and'' suffixing with double underscores are reserved for "magic names" which fulfill special behaviour in Python objects.&lt;ref name=pep8&gt;[https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/ Style Guide for Python Code PEP8]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Rust ===
[[Rust (programming language)|Rust]] recommends &lt;code&gt;UpperCamelCase&lt;/code&gt; for type aliases and struct, trait, enum, and enum variant names, &lt;code&gt;CAPITALIZED_WITH_UNDERSCORES&lt;/code&gt; for constants or statics, and &lt;code&gt;lowercase_separated_by_underscores&lt;/code&gt; for other names.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://doc.rust-lang.org/1.0.0/style/style/naming/README.html|title=Naming conventions|website=doc.rust-lang.org|language=en|access-date=2018-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Swift===
[[Swift_(programming_language)|Swift]] has shifted its naming conventions with each individual release. However a major update with Swift 3.0 stabilised the naming conventions for &lt;code&gt;lowerCamelCase&lt;/code&gt; across variables and function declarations. Constants are usually defined by enum types or constant parameters that are also written this way. Class and other object type declarations are &lt;code&gt;UpperCamelCase&lt;/code&gt;.

As of Swift 3.0 there have been made clear naming guidelines for the language in an effort to standardise the API naming and declaration conventions across all third party APIs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3556">The  '''Nordic Science Centre Association''' (also known as NSCF, abbreviated from the Swedish name ''Nordisk Science Center Forbund'') was established in a meeting in [[Finland]] in October 1987. The first chairman of NSCF was [[Per-Edvin Persson]], long-time director of [[Finland|Finnish]] [[Science museum#Science_center|science centre]] [[Heureka (science center)|Heureka]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peredvinpersson.fi/ Official website of Per-Edvin Persson]&lt;/ref&gt; Starting from 2017, the chairman is Hanne Haack Larsen from [[Experimentarium]] in [[Denmark]].

NSCF helps to establish the contact between the science centres (i.e. [[exhibition]] and activity centres whose goal is the [[Popular science|popularisation of science]] and who aim to teach through [[Interactivity|interactive]] exhibits and demonstrations) in [[Scandinavian countries|Scandinavian]] and [[Baltic Countries]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://nordicscience.net/about-us/what-is-nscf About NSCF]&lt;/ref&gt;

The aim of the association is to encourage the cooperation and the exchange of ideas between its member institutions. Contact and cooperation are facilitated by the annual meetings and the [[newsletter]] that is issued five times a year. Several members have also cooperated more closely by exchanging exhibits and exhibitions and participating in pan-European projects. The NSCF [http://nordicscience.net/about-us/nscf-scholarship Scholarship] also allows the science centre staff to travel to other member organizations (for training purposes).

NSCF is an associate member of ECSITE, the European Network of Science Centres and Museums.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecsite.eu/members/directory/nscf-nordisk-science-center-forbund ECSITE, the European Network of Science Centres and Museums]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Governing Board ==
The association is led by a governing board that is re-elected in every two years. From 2015 to 2017, it consists of the following members:

* Hanne Haack Larsen (Chairman), Experimentarium, Denmark
* Pilvi Kolk, [[AHHAA]], [[Estonia]]
* Tove Marienborg,  [[Nordnorsk Vitensenter]], [[Norway]]
* Pauls Irbins, [[ZINOO]], [[Latvia]]
* Christine Sundberg Carendi, [[Svenska Science Centers]], [[Sweden]]
* Heli Ainola, Heureka, Finland
* Guðrún J. Bachmann, [[University of Iceland]], [[Iceland]]

== Members ==
In order to become a member of NSCF, an organisation must comply with the charters of NSCF, submit a written application to the board and pay the membership fee. After that, membership has to be confirmed by voting at the next General Council (the annual meeting).[http://nordicscience.net/about-us/charters]

Currently, NSCF has members from Finland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Iceland, Estonia and Latvia. The full list of members is updated four times a year and can be found [http://nordicscience.net/members here].

=== Honorary Members ===
At the board meeting in February 2016, the NSCF governing board decided to create the status of '''honorary membership''' and nominate the first two honorary members for their active participation and long-standing support for the collaboration between Nordic and Baltic states. The honorary members of NSCF are '''Per Edwin Persson''', the first chairman of NSCF and a winner of the NSCF award, and '''Asger Høeg''', who has been a member of the NSCF governing board for many years.[http://nordicscience.net/members/honorary-members]

An '''obscenity''' is any utterance or act that strongly offends the prevalent [[morality]] of the time.&lt;ref name="M-W"&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/obscene Merriam-Webster Online] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100410221155/http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/obscene |date=10 April 2010 }}, accessed September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; It is derived from the Latin ''obscaena'' (offstage) a cognate of the [[Ancient Greek]] root ''[[Skene (theatre)|skene]]'', because some potentially offensive content, such as [[murder]] or [[sex]], was depicted offstage in classical drama. The word can be used to indicate a strong moral repugnance, in expressions such as "obscene [[profit (accounting)|profit]]s" or "the obscenity of war".  As a legal term, it usually refers to graphic depictions of people engaged in [[Human sexuality|sexual]] and [[Excretion|excretory]] activity.

{{main article|United States obscenity law}}
{{Refimprove section|date=December 2009}}
[[File:Édouard-Henri Avril (9).jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;The 18th century book ''[[Fanny Hill]]'' has been subject to obscenity trials at various times (image: plate XI: The bathing party; La baignade)&lt;/center&gt;]]
[[File:Fanny Hill 1910 cover.jpg|thumb|Cover of an undated American edition of ''Fanny Hill'', ca. 1910]]
In the [[United States|United States of America]], issues of obscenity raise issues of limitations on the [[freedom of speech]] and of [[freedom of the press|the press]], which are otherwise protected by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] to the [[United States Constitution|Constitution of the United States]].

Federal obscenity law in the U.S. is unusual in that there is no uniform national standard. Former Justice [[Potter Stewart]] of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]], in attempting to classify what material constituted exactly "what is obscene," famously wrote, "I shall not today attempt further to define the kinds of material I understand to be embraced ... [b]ut [[I know it when I see it]]...."&lt;ref&gt;''Jacobellis v. Ohio'', 378 U.S. 184, 197 (1964).&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the 1973 ruling of the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] in ''[[Miller v. California]]'' established a three-tiered [[Miller test|test]] to determine what was obscene—and thus not protected, versus what was merely erotic and thus protected by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]].

Delivering the opinion of the court, Chief Justice [[Warren Burger]] wrote:
:''The basic guidelines for the trier of fact must be: (a) whether the average person, applying contemporary community standards would find that the work, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest, (b) whether the work depicts or describes, in a patently offensive way, sexual conduct specifically defined by the applicable state law; and (c) whether the work, taken as a whole, lacks serious literary, artistic, political, or scientific value.&lt;ref&gt;''Miller v. California'', 413 U.S. 15, 24 (1972).&lt;/ref&gt;''

===Non image-based obscenity cases in the U.S.{{anchor|Non_image_based_obscenity_cases_in_the_USA}}===
{{anchor|Non image based obscenity cases in the U.S.}}

While most recent (2016) obscenity cases in the United States have revolved around images and films, the first obscenity cases dealt with textual works.

The classification of "obscene" and thus illegal for production and distribution has been judged on printed text-only stories starting with "Dunlop v. U.S., 165 U.S. 486 (1897)", which upheld a conviction for mailing and delivery of a newspaper called the 'Chicago Dispatch,' containing "obscene, lewd, lascivious, and indecent materials", which was later upheld in several cases. One of these was "A Book Named ''John Cleland's Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure''" v. Attorney General of Com. of Massachusetts, "[[Memoirs v. Massachusetts|383 U.S. 413 (1966)]]" wherein the book "[[Fanny Hill]]", written by John Cleland c. 1760, was judged to be obscene in a proceeding that put the book itself on trial rather than its publisher. Another was "Kaplan v. California, 413 U.S. 115 (1973)" whereby the court most famously determined that "Obscene material in book form is not entitled to any First Amendment protection merely because it has no pictorial content."

In 2005, the U.S. Department of Justice formed the [[Obscenity Prosecution Task Force]] in a push to prosecute obscenity cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Larry | last = Abramson | title = Federal Government Renews Effort to Curb Porn | date = 27 September 2005 | publisher = NPR | url = https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4865348 | work = Morning Edition | accessdate = 11 April 2012 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120630022330/http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=4865348 | archivedate = 30 June 2012 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Barton | last = Gellman | title = Recruits Sought for Porn Squadn | date = 20 September 2005 | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/19/AR2005091901570.html | work = The Washington Post | accessdate = 11 April 2012 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121020085913/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/09/19/AR2005091901570.html | archivedate = 20 October 2012 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Red Rose Stories, a site dedicated to text-only fantasy stories, became one of many sites targeted by the FBI for shutdown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Red Rose Stories Closed by FBI | date = 7 October 2005 | url = http://www.xbiz.com/news/10680 | work = XBiz | accessdate = 11 April 2012 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120425211555/http://www.xbiz.com/news/10680 | archivedate = 25 April 2012 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The government alleged that Red Rose Stories contained depictions of child rape.

Literature (non-fiction) communicating [[contraceptive]] information was prohibited by several states. The last such prohibition, in Connecticut, was overturned judicially in 1965.

===Key U.S. court cases on obscenity===

*In 1957, two associates of acclaimed poet Allen Ginsberg were arrested and jailed for selling his book "Howl and Other Poems" to undercover police officers at a beatnik bookstore in San Francisco. Eventually the California Supreme Court declared the literature to be of "redeeming social value" and therefore [[Howl#1957 obscenity trial|not classifiable as "obscene"]]. Because the poem "Howl" contains pornographic slang and overt references to drugs and homosexuality, the poem was (and is) frequently censored and confiscated; however, it remains a landmark case.
*'''''[[FCC v. Pacifica]]''''' (1978) [http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=us&amp;vol=438&amp;invol=726 (external link)] better known as the landmark "[[seven dirty words]]" case. In that ruling, the Court found that only "repetitive and frequent" use of the words in a time or place when a minor could hear can be punished.
*In '''''[[State v. Henry]]''''' (1987), the [[Oregon Supreme Court]] ruled that the Oregon state law that criminalized obscenity was an unconstitutional restriction of free speech under the free speech provision of the [[Oregon Constitution]], with the ruling making Oregon the "first state in the nation to abolish the offense of obscenity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firstamendmentcenter.org/news.aspx?id=9446|title=Wisconsin high court could strike down obscenity law|author=Hudson, David|publisher=[[First Amendment Center]]|date=1998-10-28|accessdate=2011-01-13|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091104093910/http://www.firstamendmentcenter.org/news.aspx?id=9446|archivedate=4 November 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In '''''[[Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union|Reno v. ACLU]]''''' (1997), the Supreme Court struck down indecency laws applying to the Internet.
*In '''''[[Miller v. California]]''''' (1973) - the currently-binding Supreme Court precedent on the issue - the Court ruled materials were obscene if they appealed, "to a prurient interest", showed "[[patently offensive]] sexual conduct" that was specifically defined by a state obscenity law, and "lacked serious artistic, literary, political, or scientific value." Decisions regarding whether material was obscene should be based on local, not national, standards.

Standards superseded by the [[Miller Test]] include:
* ''Wepplo'' (1947): If material has a substantial tendency to deprave or corrupt its readers by inciting [[lascivious]] thoughts or arousing lustful desires. (People v. Wepplo, 78 Cal. App.2d Supp. 959, 178 P.2d 853).
* ''[[Hicklin test]]'' (1868): the effect of isolated passages upon the most susceptible persons. (British common law, cited in Regina v. Hicklin, 1868. LR 3 QB 360 - overturned when Michigan tried to outlaw all printed matter that would 'corrupt the morals of youth' in Butler v. State of Michigan 352 U.S. 380 (1957))
* ''[[Roth Standard]]'' (1957): "Whether to the average person applying contemporary community standards, the dominant theme of the material, taken as a whole, appeals to the prurient interest". [[Roth v. United States]] 354 U.S. 476 (1957) - overturned by Miller
* ''[[Jacobellis v. Ohio|Roth-Jacobellis]]'' (1964): "community standards" applicable to an obscenity are national, not local standards. Material is "utterly without redeeming social importance". Jacobellis v. Ohio 378 US 184 (1964) - famous quote: "I shall not today attempt further to define ''[hardcore pornography]'' ...But I know it when I see it."
* ''[[Memoirs v. Massachusetts|Roth-Jacobellis-Memoirs Test]]'' (1966): Adds that the material possesses "not a modicum of social value". (A Book Named ''John Cleland's [[Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure]]'' v. Attorney General of Massachusetts, 383 U.S. 413 (1966))

[[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] rules and federal law govern obscenity in broadcast media. Many historically important works have been described as obscene or prosecuted under obscenity laws, including the works of [[Charles Baudelaire]], [[Lenny Bruce]], [[William S. Burroughs]], [[Allen Ginsberg]], [[James Joyce]], [[D. H. Lawrence]], [[Henry Miller]], [[Samuel Beckett]], and the [[Marquis de Sade]].

===Criticism===

Obscenity law has been criticized in the following areas:&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://www.nexusjournal.org/2005obscenity/75-82.pdf Huston, William: "Under Color of Law, Obscenity vs. the First Amendment", ''Nexus Journal'', Vol 10 (2005): 75:82.]&lt;/ref&gt;

* Federal law forbids obscenity in certain contexts (such as broadcast);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fcc.gov/guides/obscenity-indecency-and-profanity |title=Obscene, Indecent and Profane Broadcasts |publisher=FCC |accessdate=2013-08-17 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131209153728/http://www.fcc.gov/guides/obscenity-indecency-and-profanity |archivedate=9 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; however, the law does not define the term.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}
* The U.S. Supreme Court similarly has had difficulty defining the term. In ''[[Miller v. California]]'', the court defers definition to two hypothetical entities, "contemporary community standards" and "hypothetical reasonable persons".
* The courts and the legislature have had similar problems defining this term because it is paradoxical, and thus impossible to define.
* Because the term "obscenity" is not defined by either the statutes or the case law, this law does not satisfy the [[Vagueness doctrine]], which states that people must clearly be informed as to the prohibited behavior.
* Because the determination of what is obscene (offensive) is ultimately a personal preference, alleged violations of obscenity law are not actionable (actions require a right).
* Because no actual injury occurs when a mere preference is violated, alleged violations of obscenity law are not actionable (actions require an injury).

Obscenity laws remain enforceable under Miller despite these criticisms.  Some states have passed laws mandating censorship in schools, universities, and libraries even if they are not receiving [[Children's Internet Protection Act|government aid that would require censorship in these institutions]]. These include Arizona, Kentucky, Michigan, Minnesota, South Carolina, and Tennessee. Twenty more states were considering such legislation in 2001–2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aclu.org/issues/cyber/hmcl.html |title=Technology and Liberty &amp;#124; American Civil Liberties Union |publisher=Aclu.org |date=2008-11-14 |accessdate=2013-08-17 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20021015042228/http://www.aclu.org/issues/cyber/hmcl.html |archivedate=15 October 2002 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[New York v. Ferber]]'', {{ussc|458|747|1982}}, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that child pornography need not be legally obscene in order to be outlawed. The Court ruled that in contrast to the types of images considered in ''Miller'', images that depicted underlying harm to children need not appeal to "the prurient interest of the average person," portray sexual conduct in "a patently offensive manner," nor be considered holistically, in order to be proscribed. Another difference between U.S. constitutional law concerning obscenity and that governing child pornography is that the Supreme Court ruled in ''[[Stanley v. Georgia]]'', {{ussc|394|557|1969}}, that possession of obscene material could not be criminalized, while in ''[[Osborne v. Ohio]]'', {{ussc|495|103|1990}}, the high court ruled that possession of child pornography could be criminalized. The reason was that the motive for criminalizing child pornography possession was "to destroy a market for the exploitative use of children" rather than to prevent the material from poisoning the minds of its viewers.&lt;!--quote source?--&gt; The three dissenting justices in that case argued, "While the sexual exploitation of children is undoubtedly a serious problem, Ohio may employ other weapons to combat it."&lt;!--quote source?--&gt;

===Censorship in film===
{{main article|Film censorship in the United States}}
This is most notably shown with the "X" rating under which some films are categorized. The most notable films given an "X" rating were ''[[Deep Throat (film)|Deep Throat]]'' (1972) and ''[[The Devil in Miss Jones]]'' (1973). These films show explicit, non-simulated, penetrative sex that was presented as part of a reasonable plot with respectable production values. Some state authorities issued injunctions against such films to protect "local community standards"; in New York, the print of ''Deep Throat'' was seized mid-run, and the film's exhibitors were found guilty of promoting obscenity.&lt;ref name="filmreference.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.filmreference.com/encyclopedia/Academy-Awards-Crime-Films/Censorship-SEX-AND-VIOLENCE.html |title=Sex and violence - Censorship - actor, film, movie, show, cinema, scene |publisher=Filmreference.com |accessdate=2013-08-17 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029185451/http://www.filmreference.com/encyclopedia/Academy-Awards-Crime-Films/Censorship-SEX-AND-VIOLENCE.html |archivedate=29 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the documentary ''[[This Film Is Not Yet Rated]]'', films that include gay sex (even if implied) or female pleasure have been more harshly censored than their heterosexual, male counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media | title=This Film Is Not Yet Rated | date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Motion Picture Association of America]] (MPAA) issues [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|ratings]] for motion pictures exhibited and distributed commercially to the public in the United States; the ratings are issued through the Classification and Rating Administration (CARA). The intent of the rating system is to provide information about the content of motion pictures so parents can determine whether an individual motion picture is suitable for viewing by their children.

==United Kingdom==

In the United Kingdom, the [[Obscene Publications Acts]] sets the criteria for what material is allowed to be publicly accessed and distributed.

[[Stanley Kauffmann]]'s novel ''The Philanderer'' was published by Penguin Books in 1957 and was unsuccessfully prosecuted for obscenity.&lt;ref&gt;Kauffmann, S. (1957) ''The Philanderer''. Harmondsworth: Penguin Books "When first published in 1954, this book was the subject of an unsuccessful prosecution for obscene libel. Mr. Justice Stable's historic summing-up on that occasion is included as an appendix."&lt;/ref&gt;

Sex crime has generated particular concern. In 1976 the BBFC claimed that, in that year, it had viewed 58 films depicting "explicit rape", declaring scenes that glorified it as "obscene". As opposed to questions of "indecency", which have been applied to sexual explicitness, films charged with being obscene have been viewed as having "a tendency to deprave and corrupt" and been liable to prosecution.&lt;ref name="filmreference.com"/&gt;

In 2008, the UK prosecuted a man for writing a fictional sex story ([[R v Walker]]).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/10/06/obscene_publication_girls_aloud/ The Obscene Publications Act rides again.

Obscenity law in [[England and Wales]] is currently governed by the [[Obscene Publications Act]], but obscenity law goes back much further into the English [[common law]]. The conviction in 1727 of [[Edmund Curll]] for the publication of ''[[The Nun in her Smock|Venus in the Cloister or the Nun in her Smock]]'' under the common law offence of [[Breach of the peace|disturbing the peace]] appears to be the first conviction for obscenity in the United Kingdom, and set a [[legal precedent]] for other convictions. These common law ideas of obscenity formed the original basis of obscenity law in other common law countries, such as the United States.

For visual works of art the main obscenity law in England and Wales was, until the 1960s, the [[Vagrancy Act 1838]] which was successfully used in prosecutions against D.H. Lawrence for an exhibition of his paintings at the Warren Gallery, London, in 1929,&lt;ref&gt;See T.W. Earp, 'The Paintings of DH Lawrence' in ''The New Statesman'' (London newspaper), 17 August 1929, p.578&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1966 against the British artist [[Stass Paraskos Obscenity Trial 1966|Stass Paraskos]] for an exhibition of his paintings held that year in the northern English city of [[Leeds]].&lt;ref&gt;Norbert Lynton, Stass Paraskos (Mitcham: Orage Press, 2003) 7f&lt;/ref&gt; Parts of the Act were repealed shortly after the Paraskos trial and it has rarely been used since in relation to visual art.

The Obscene Publications act is notoriously vague, defining obscenity as material likely to "deprave and corrupt". The 1959 act was passed just as most [[Western world|Western]] countries were about to enter a new phase of [[sexual freedom]]. The trial of [[Penguin Books]] over [[Lady Chatterley's Lover]] in 1960 failed to secure a conviction and the conviction in the 1971 trial of [[Oz (magazine)|Oz magazine]] was overturned on appeal. An attempt to prosecute the [[University of Central England]] in 1997 over a copy of a library book by [[Robert Mapplethorpe]] was abandoned amidst derision from [[academics]] and [[News media|the media]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uce.ac.uk/mapplethorpe/ |title=After a year out on loan Mapplethorpe book is set to return to library shelves|accessdate=6 March 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060823022442/http://www.uce.ac.uk/mapplethorpe/ |archivedate=23 August 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1960s and 1970s most Western countries legalised [[hardcore pornography]]. By the 1980s the UK was almost the only [[liberal democracy]] where the sale of hardcore pornography was still completely illegal, although ownership was not a criminal offence (except [[child pornography]]). Home [[videotape]] was a booming market and it was relatively simple for individuals to [[smuggling|smuggle]] hardcore material in from [[Europe]] or the United States, where it had been purchased legally, either for personal use or to copy it for distribution. This resulted in a considerable [[black market]] of poor quality videotapes. Meanwhile, people attempting to buy pornography legally would often be stuck with heavily censored [[R18 (British Board of Film Classification)|R18 certificate]] material.

While the authorities did their best to stay on top of illegal pornography they found that [[jury|juries]], while not particularly liking the material, were reluctant to convict defendants where the material was intended for private use among consenting adults. During the 1990s the advent of the [[internet]] made it easier than ever before for British citizens to access hardcore material. Finally, in 2000, following the dismissal of a test case brought by the [[BBFC]], hardcore pornography was effectively legalised, subject to certain conditions and licensing restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.melonfarmers.co.uk/faqvideo.htm |title=FAQ: Buying Adult Films: Is it legal? |publisher=Melonfarmers.co.uk |accessdate=2013-08-17 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130808192607/http://melonfarmers.co.uk/faqvideo.htm |archivedate=8 August 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is still an offence to sell obscene material by [[mail order]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4573507.stm |title=UK &amp;#124; High Court blocks web porn sales |publisher=BBC News |date=2005-05-23 |accessdate=2013-08-17 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140620115419/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4573507.stm |archivedate=20 June 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After 1984 videotape sellers were more likely to be prosecuted under the [[Video Recordings Act 1984|Video Recordings Act]] rather than the OPA. The VRA requires that all videos must have a certificate from the BBFC. If the BBFC refuses a certificate a video is effectively banned for home viewing, but not necessarily in the [[Movie theater|cinema]]. Four films that were originally refused a certificate, [[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]], [[Straw Dogs (1971 film)|Straw Dogs]], [[The Evil Dead]] and [[The Texas Chain Saw Massacre|The Texas Chainsaw Massacre]] were granted a certificate in the late 1990s and have subsequently been screened on mainstream [[television]].

==New Zealand==
In New Zealand, screening of ''[[Deep Throat (film)|Deep Throat]]'' (1972) was only cleared in 1986. However, the film has not been screened because the only cinema that has tried to organize a screening was thwarted by the city council that owned the building's lease.&lt;ref name="filmreference.com"/&gt;

Section 163 of the Canadian Criminal Code provides the country's legal definition of "obscenity". Officially termed as

The current law states

163. (1) Every one commits an offense who

:(a) makes, prints, publishes, distributes, circulates, or has in his possession for the purpose of publication, distribution or circulation any obscene written matter, picture, model, phonograph record or other thing whatever; or

:(b) makes, prints, publishes, distributes, sells or has in his possession for the purposes of publication, distribution or circulation a crime comic.

"Crime comics" are stated to be books that glorify criminal activities and have at least one depiction of such criminal actions of the book's text.

The [[Canada Border Services Agency]] seizes items it labels obscene.

In 1993, Canadian police arrested the 19-year-old writer of a fictional sex story "The Forestwood Kids"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.efc.ca/pages/media/id.25jan96.html|title=Child-less Pornography|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100310121053/http://www.efc.ca/pages/media/id.25jan96.html|archivedate=10 March 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; however the case was dismissed in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.efc.ca/pages/law/court/R.v.Pecciarich.html|title=Regina v.

Ever since 1940, in the Title VI of the Penal Code, naming crimes against sexual dignity (until 2009 crimes against social conventions), the fourth chapter is dedicated to a crime named "public outrage related to modesty" ({{lang-pt|ultraje público ao pudor}}, {{IPA-pt|uwˈtɾaʒi ˈpublikw aw puˈdoʁ|pron}}).

It is composed of two articles, Art. 233 "Obscene Act", "to practice an obscene act in a public place, or open or exposed to the public", punished with arrest of 3 months to 1 year or a fine; and Art. 234 "Obscene Written Piece or Object", to do, import, export, purchase or have in one's property, to ends of trade, distribution or public display, any written, drew, painted, stamped or object piece of obscenity, punished with arrest of 6 months to 1 years or a fine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dji.com.br/codigos/1940_dl_002848_cp/cp233a234.htm DJi -233 a 234- DL-002.848-1940 - Còdigo Penal - Ultraje Público ao Pudor] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130918053011/http://www.dji.com.br/codigos/1940_dl_002848_cp/cp233a234.htm |date=18 September 2013 }} {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* They do not attack anyone's sexual dignity, instead causing outrage at best, but generally just slight discomfort or embarrassment, that can be easily avoided through not looking to such a scene.
* The Art. 234 is aside obsolete, unconstitutional, for the 1988 post-military dictatorship Constitution having in its Fifth Chapter: "[the people] are free to the expression of intellectual, artistic, scientific and communicative activity, independently of censorship and license", reason to which, instead of making it suffer penal restriction, gives any distribution of media the right to be fully exerted.
* The flourishing internet culture of Brazil, where such media is freely shared, as well as its pornographic industry and shops catered to the interests of enhancing apparatus to masturbatory and sexual activity.

It is often used against people who expose their nude bodies in public environments that were not warranted a license to cater to the demographic interested in such practice (the first such place was the Praia do Abricó in Rio de Janeiro, in 1994), even if no sexual action took place, and it may include for example a double standard for the chest area of women and men in which only women are penalized.

Various countries have different standings on the types of materials that they as legal bodies permit their citizens to have access to and disseminate among their local populations. The set of these countries' permissible content vary widely accordingly with some having extreme punishment up to and including execution for members who violate their restrictions, as in the case of Iran where the current laws against pornography now include death sentences for those convicted of producing pornography.&lt;ref&gt;Saeed Kamali Dehghan (18 January 2012) [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jan/18/iran-death-sentence-porn-programmer "Iran confirms death sentence for 'porn site' web programmer"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170904152548/https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jan/18/iran-death-sentence-porn-programmer |date=4 September 2017 }} ''The Guardian''.

In India the Obscenity law is the same as had been framed by the British Government. Charges of obscenity have been levelled against various writers and poets till date; the law has not yet been revised. The famous trials relate to the [[Hungryalists]] who were arrested and prosecuted in the 1960s.

The '''Oghur''' or '''Oğuric'''{{sfn|Golden|2011|p=30}} languages (also known as '''Bulgar''', '''Pre-Proto Bulgaric''',{{sfn|Golden|2011|p=39}} or '''Lir-Turkic''' and '''r-Turkic''') are a branch of the [[Turkic languages|Turkic language family]]. The only extant member of the group is the [[Chuvash language]]. Languages from this family were spoken in some nomadic tribal confederations, such as those of the [[Onogurs]], [[Bulgars]], and [[Khazars]].{{sfn|Golden|2011|p=239}} Some scholars consider [[Hunnic language|Hunnic]] a similar language&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pritsak |first=Omeljan |author-link=Omeljan Pritsak |date=1982 |title=The Hunnic Language of the Attila Clan  |url=http://projects.iq.harvard.edu/files/huri/files/vvi_n4_dec1982.pdf |publisher=[[Harvard Ukrainian Research Institute]] |place=Cambridge, Massachusetts |volume=IV |issue=4 |pages=470 |issn=0363-5570}}&lt;/ref&gt; and refer to this extended grouping as '''Hunno-Bulgarian'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author-first=Omeljan|last=Pritsak|chapter=The Proto-Bulgarian Military Inventory Inscriptions|title=Turkic-Bulgarian-Hungarian relations|year=1981|location=Budapest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Oghuric languages are a distinct group of the [[Turkic languages]], standing in contrast to [[Common Turkic languages|Common Turkic]]. Today they are represented only by [[Chuvash language|Chuvash]]. Extinct Oghuric languages include [[Bulgar language|Bulgar]] and [[Khazar language|Khazar]].{{sfn|Golden|1992|p=95–96}} There is no consensus among linguists on the relation between Oghuric and Common Turkic, and several questions remain unsolved:
*Are they parallel branches of [[Proto-Turkic]] (3000-500 BC) and, if so, which branch is more archaic?
*Does Oghuric represents Archaic Turkic before phonetic changes in 100-400 AD and was it a separate language?{{sfn|Golden|2011|p=30}}

==Features==
The Oghuric languages are also known as "-r Turkic" because the final consonant in certain words is ''r'', not ''z'' as in Common Turkic.{{sfn|Golden|1992|p=95–96}} {{lang-cv|вăкăр}} - {{lang-tr|öküz}} - {{lang-tt|үгез}} - {{lang-en|ox}}. Hence the name ''[[Turkic tribal confederations|Oghur]]'' corresponds ''Oghuz'' in Common Turkic.{{sfn|Golden|2011|p=30}} Other correspondences are Com. ''š'' : Oghur ''l'' (''tâš'' : ''tâl'', 'stone'); ''s'' &gt; ''š''; ''*č'' &gt; ''ś''; ''k/q'' &gt; ''ğ''; ''y'' &gt; ''j, ś''; ''d, δ'' &gt; ''δ'' &gt; ''z'' (10th cent.) &gt; ''r'' (13th cent.)"; ''ğd'' &gt; ''z'' &gt; ''r'' (14th cent.); ''a'' &gt; ''ı'' (after 9th cent.).{{sfn|Golden|1992|p=20, 96}}{{sfn|Golden|2011|p=30, 236–239}}

[[Denis Sinor]] believes that the difference means that those tribes could not have come from lands like [[Mongolia]], which uses a ''-z'' language.{{sfn|Golden|2011|p=29}} However, there many loanwords in [[Mongolic languages|Mongolic]] from Oghuric, like Mong. ''ikere'', Oghur. ''*ikir'', Hung. ''iker'', Comm. ''ikiz'' (twins).{{sfn|Golden|2011|p=30}} It is believed that they lived in the Mongolian borderlands before the 5th century.{{sfn|Golden|2011|p=31}}

The Oghuric tribes are often connected with the [[Hungarians]] whose ethnonym is usually derived from Onoghurs (&gt; (H)ungars).{{sfn|Golden|1992|p=102–103}} The Hungarians were mixed [[Finno-Ugric peoples|Finno-Ugric]] and Turkic, with strong Oghuric-Bulgar and Khazar influences.{{sfn|Golden|1992|p=262}}{{sfn|Golden|2011|p=333}} Hungarian has many borrowings from Turkic and Oghuric languages:{{sfn|Golden|1992|p=259–260}} Hung. ''tenger'', Oghur. ''*tengir'', Comm. ''tengiz'' (sea),{{sfn|Golden|2011|p=30}} Hung. ''gyűrű'', Oghur. ''jürük'', Comm. ''yüzük'' (ring),{{sfn|Golden|2011|p=164}} and terms of equestrian culture ''ló'' (horse), ''nyereg'' (saddle), ''fék'' (bridle), ''ostor'' (whip).{{sfn|Golden|1992|p=259}} A number of Hungarian loanwords were borrowed before the 9th century, shown by ''sz-'' (&lt; Oğ. ''ś-'') rather than Comm. ''gy-'' (&lt; Oğ. ''ǰ-''): example Hung. ''szél'', Oghur. ''*śäl'', Chuv. ''śil'',  Comm. ''yel'' (wind), Hung. ''szűcs'' (tailor), Hung. ''szőlő'' (grapes).{{sfn|Golden|2011|p=164}}

'''Perdix''' drones are the main subject of an experimental project conducted by the Strategic Capabilities Office of the [[United States Department of Defense]] which aims to develop autonomous micro-drones to be used for unmanned [[aerial surveillance]].&lt;ref name="factsheet"&gt;{{cite web|title=Microsoft Word - Perdix Fact Sheet (01062017 Final)|url=https://www.defense.gov/Portals/1/Documents/pubs/Perdix%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf|website=www.defense.gov|publisher=United States Department of Defense|accessdate=14 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt;&lt;ref name="defense news" /&gt;

==Origin==
The idea of intelligent [[micro air vehicle|micro-drones]] which could communicate with each other was pioneered by a group of students studying at the Aeronautics and Astronautics Department of the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] in 2011.&lt;ref name="beaver"&gt;{{cite web|title=Project Perdix|url=https://beaverworks.ll.mit.edu/CMS/bw/projectperdixcapstone|website=www.mit.edu|publisher=Beaver Works|accessdate=14 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They were subsequently modified for military use in 2013 under the direction of the [[United States Department of Defense]] Strategic Capabilities Office.&lt;ref name="military times"&gt;{{cite web|title=Defense Department successfully tests world's largest micro-drone swarm|url=http://www.militarytimes.com/articles/pentagon-successfully-tests-worlds-largest-micro-drone-swarm|website=www.militarytimes.com|publisher=Military Times|accessdate=14 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="national interest"&gt;{{cite web|title=U.S. Military Successfully Tested Its Latest Super Weapon: "The Swarm"|url=http://nationalinterest.org/blog/the-buzz/us-military-successfully-tested-its-latest-super-weapon-%E2%80%98the-19002|website=www.nationalinterest.org|publisher=National Interest|accessdate=14 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The drone system was named after the [[Perdix (mythology)|character in Greek mythology of the same name]].&lt;ref name="factsheet" /&gt;

==Autonomy==
Each individual drone is not controlled in itself but instead it shares a collective, distributed "brain," travelling in leaderless "swarms," members of which can adapt to changes in drone numbers and remain co-ordinated with their counterparts.&lt;ref name="national interest" /&gt;&lt;ref name="factsheet" /&gt;  Having multiple micro-drones carrying out surveillance is tactically advantageous to simply having one large drone because it is easier for the micro-drones to dodge [[anti-aircraft warfare|air defense systems]].&lt;ref name="bbc" /&gt;  The drones have the ability to collectively determine whether they have completed a mission, leading some commentators to argue that Perdix drones are [[artificial intelligence|artificially intelligent]].&lt;ref name="popular-mechanics"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Pentagon's Autonomous Swarming Drones Are the Most Unsettling Thing You'll See Today|url=http://www.popularmechanics.com/military/aviation/a24675/pentagon-autonomous-swarming-drones/|website=www.popularmechanics.com|publisher=Popular Mechanics|accessdate=3 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Testing==
[[File:DOD 103983712-1024x576-1769k.webm|thumb|F/A18 jets drop Perdix drones over California in a test exercise.]]
The first operational test of the militarized Perdix drones was conducted by the [[U.S. Air Force Test Pilot School]] in September 2014 over [[Edwards Air Force Base]].&lt;ref name="cbs-rev" /&gt;&lt;ref name="wash" /&gt;&lt;ref name="naval drones"&gt;{{cite web|title=Perdix|url=http://www.navaldrones.com/perdix.html|website=www.navaldrones.com|publisher=Naval Drones|accessdate=3 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The drones were placed in the [[flare (countermeasure)|flare canisters]] of [[F-16 Fighting Falcon]] and deployed to operate at a lower altitude.&lt;ref name="ihls"&gt;{{cite web|title=F-16 Launching Perdix Drone Swarm|url=https://i-hls.com/archives/68848|website=www.i-hls.com|publisher=iHLS|accessdate=3 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A year later, in September 2015, 90 Perdix missions were flown over [[Alaska]] to test maritime surveillance capabilities.&lt;ref name="factsheet" /&gt;

In October 2016, 103 Perdix drones were dropped from three [[F/A-18 Super Hornet]] fighter jets in a joint effort with the US Naval Air Systems Command over their base at [[China Lake, Kern County, California|China Lake, California]].&lt;ref name="aviationist"&gt;{{cite web|title=U.S. F/A-18 Hornets Unleash Swarm of Mini-Drones in First Test|url=https://theaviationist.com/2017/01/11/watch-u-s-fa-18-hornets-unleash-swarm-of-mini-drones-in-first-test/|website=www.theaviationist.com|publisher=The Aviationist|accessdate=3 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As with earlier tests, the drones were packed into [[Flare (countermeasure)|flare canisters]] for the jets to eject.&lt;ref name="d1"&gt;{{cite web|title=These Swarming Drones Launch from a Fighter Jet’s Flare Dispensers|url=http://www.defenseone.com/technology/2016/09/these-swarming-drones-launch-fighter-jets-flare-dispensers/131414/|website=www.defenseone.com|publisher=Defense One|accessdate=3 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="inverse"&gt;{{cite web|title=Watch U.S. Fighter Jets Drop a Massive Swarm of 103 Micro-Drones|url=https://www.inverse.com/article/26211-watch-perdix-micro-drone-swarm|website=www.inverse.com|publisher=Inverse|accessdate=3 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="engadget"&gt;{{cite web|title=DoD shows off its first successful micro-drone swarm launch|url=https://www.engadget.com/2017/01/10/dod-shows-off-its-first-successful-micro-drone-swarm-launch/|website=www.engadget.com|publisher=Engadget|accessdate=3 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The test was a success and elicited significant media coverage when announced on 9 January 2017.&lt;ref name="network world"&gt;{{cite web|title=Pentagon tested world's largest swarm of autonomous micro-drones|url=http://www.networkworld.com/article/3156594/security/pentagon-tested-worlds-largest-swarm-of-autonomous-micro-drones.html|website=www.networkworld.com|publisher=Network World|accessdate=14 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite web|title=US military tests swarm of mini-drones launched from jets|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-38569027|website=www.bbc.co.uk|publisher=BBC|accessdate=14 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wash"&gt;{{cite web|title=Watch Perdix - the secretive Pentagon program dropping tiny drones from jets|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/checkpoint/wp/2016/03/08/watch-perdix-the-secretive-pentagon-program-dropping-tiny-drones-from-jets/|website=www.washingtonpost.com|publisher=Washington Post|accessdate=14 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Processability theory''' is a [[Scientific theory|theory]] and a model of [[second language acquisition]] developed by Manfred Pienemann that touches the linguistic structures that surface in the learning of a second language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hw.ac.uk/langWWW/eurosla/abstracts/gpallotti.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=May 27, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060514164451/http://www.hw.ac.uk/langWWW/eurosla/abstracts/gpallotti.htm |archivedate=May 14, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory has been used as a framework by several scientists from Europe and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.processability.net/cms/images/files/References/pt_references.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=May 27, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724020842/http://www.processability.net/cms/images/files/References/pt_references.pdf |archivedate=July 24, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Processability theory is part of the cognitive approach to second language acquisition that attempts to increase understanding of the ways L2 learners restructure their [[interlanguage]] knowledge systems to be in greater conformity to L2 structures. Processability theory states that learners restructure their L2 knowledge systems in an order of which they are capable at their stage of development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Pienemann |first = Manfred |year = 1998 |title = Language Processing and Second Language Development: Processability Theory |publisher = John Benjamins |location = Amsterdam |isbn = 978-1-55619-549-5
}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, in order to acquire the correct morphological and syntactic forms for English questions, learners must transform declarative English sentences. They do so by a series of stages, consistent across learners. Clahsen proposed that certain processing principles determine this order of restructuring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |ref = harv |last = Clahsen |first = Harald |editor1-last = Andersen |editor1-first = Roger |year = 1984 |title = Second languages: a cross-linguistic perspective |pages = 219–242 |chapter       = The acquisition of German word order: a test case for cognitive approaches to second language acquisition |publisher = Newbury House |location = Rowley, MA |isbn = 978-0-88377-440-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, he stated that learners first, maintain declarative word order while changing other aspects of the utterances, second, move words to the beginning and end of sentences, and third, move elements within main clauses before subordinate clauses.

== Commentary ==
Processability Theory is now a mature theory of grammatical development of learners' interlanguage. It is cognitively founded (hence applicable to any language), formal and explicit (hence empirically testable), and extended, having not only formulated and tested hypotheses about morphology, syntax and discourse-pragmatics, but having also paved the way for further developments at the interface between grammar and the lexicon and other important modules in SLA.

Among the most important SLA theories recently discussed in Van Patten (2007), no other can accommodate such a variety of phenomena or seems able to offer the basis for so many new directions. Ten years have gone by since Pienemann’s first book-length publication on PT in 1998; and before that, it took almost two decades to mould into PT the initial intuition by the ZISA team that the staged development of German word order could be explained by psycholinguistic constraints universally applicable to all languages (Pienemann 1981; Clahsen, Meisel &amp; Pienemann 1983). In these three decades, the whole field of SLA has grown exponentially. PT has paralleled this growth, and widened its scope in several directions. First, ZISA’s intuitions have been applied to English (Pienemann &amp; Johnston 1984; Pienemann, Johnston &amp; Brindley 1988, Pienemann 1989), then PT has expanded its typological validation from German and English to different languages, such as Swedish and other Scandinavian languages (Håkansson 1997, Glahn et al. 2001), Arabic (e.g., Mansouri 1995; 2005), Italian (e.g. Di Biase &amp; Kawaguchi 2002; Di Biase 2007; Bettoni, Di Biase &amp; Nuzzo 2009), French (Ågren 2009), Chinese (e.g. Zhang 2004, 2005), and Japanese (e.g. Di Biase &amp; Kawaguchi 2002, 2005).

Secondly, PT’s framework has been substantially widened by including Bresnan’s (2001) Lexical Mapping Theory, and thus adding a discourse pragmatically motivated syntactic component (Pienemann, Di Biase &amp; Kawaguchi 2005) to its first syntactically motivated morphological module. Thirdly, developmentally-moderated transfer from L1 (e.g., Pienemann, Di Biase, Kawaguchi &amp; Håkansson 2005a; Pienemann, Di Biase, Kawaguchi &amp; Håkansson 2005b). Fourthly, PT’s plausibility has been tested in language situations other than L2 ones, such as monolingual and bilingual language acquisition (e.g., Håkansson 2001, 2005; ItaniAdams 2006), among children with Specific Language Impairment (e.g., Håkansson 2001; 2005), and in the origins of creole languages (Plag 2008a, 2008b).

Finally, the range of the original applications of PT to language testing and language teaching has also expanded over the years, involving several new ways of testing and teaching situations (e.g., Iwasaki 2004, 2008, ask Bruno; Pienemann &amp; Keßler 2007), and new languages (e.g. Di Biase 2008; Yamaguchi 2009). Ensuing publications in all these PT strands during such a long period of growth have had their own agendas and purposes. Furthermore, not only PT itself but also its feeder disciplines have developed in new directions, crucially among them [[psycholinguistics]] for language production and [[theoretical linguistics]] for language knowlwedge. As a consequence, it is not surprising that readers unfamiliar with PT's history may at times be confused by differences in the presentation of the theory, its use of terminology, and reliance on its theoretical bases.

A '''prophecy''' is a message that is claimed by a [[prophet]] to have been communicated to them by a [[god]]. Such messages typically involve inspiration, interpretation, or [[revelation]] of divine will concerning the prophet's social world and events to come (compare [[Light (theology)|divine knowledge]]). All known ancient cultures had prophets who delivered prophecies.

==Etymology==
The English noun "prophecy", in the sense of "function of a prophet" appeared from about 1225, from [[Old French]] ''profecie'' (12th century), and from ''prophetia'', [[Greek language|Greek]] ''propheteia'' "gift of interpreting the will of God", from Greek ''prophetes'' (see [[prophet]]). The related meaning, "thing spoken or written by a prophet", dates from {{circa}} 1300, while the verb "to prophesy" is recorded by 1377.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=prophecy "Prophecy"] in the Online Etymology Dictionary
&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Maimonides]] suggested that "prophecy is, in truth and reality, an emanation sent forth by [[God in Judaism|Divine Being]] through the medium of the [[active intellect|Active Intellect]], in the first instance to man's [[Rationality|rational faculty]], and then to his [[Imagination|imaginative faculty]]".&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.meru.org/Advisors/Sunwall/RambamProphecy.html|title= Meru Foundation Research: Mark R. Sunwall, Rambam Prophecy|author= Stan Tenen - Meru Foundation|publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The views of Maimonides closely relate to the definition by [[Al-Farabi|Al-Fârâbî]], who developed the theory of prophecy in Islam.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.csulb.edu/~dsteiger/maimonides.htm The influence of Islamic Philosophy on Maimonides's thought, Diana Steigerwald Religious Studies, California State University (Long Beach)] {{webarchive|url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080118125244/http://www.csulb.edu/~dsteiger/maimonides.htm |date= 2008-01-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Much of the activity of Old Testament prophets involved conditional warnings rather than immutable futures.&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; A summary of a standard Old Testament prophetic formula might run: Repent of sin X and turn to righteousness, otherwise consequence Y will occur.

* The ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' defines a Christian conception of prophecy as "understood in its strict sense, it means the foreknowledge of future events, though it may sometimes apply to past events of which there is no memory, and to present hidden things which cannot be known by the natural light of reason".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/12473a.htm|title= CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Prophecy|publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern ([[Western esotericism| Western esoteric]]) research in prophecy is a [[pseudoscience]]. In general, a diviner's foretelling or a prophetic prediction of the future does not adhere to the [[scientific method]], therefore it is no object of [[science]].&lt;ref name="Hines 2003"&gt;[[Terence Hines| Hines, Terence]]. (2003). ''Pseudoscience and the Paranormal''. Prometheus Books. pp. 66-73. {{ISBN|1-57392-979-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From a skeptical point of view, a Latin maxim exists: "prophecy written after the fact" (''[[vaticinium ex eventu]]'').&lt;ref&gt;

==Buddhism==
The ''Haedong Kosung-jon'' (Biographies of High Monks) records that King [[Beopheung of Silla]] had desired to promulgate Buddhism as the state religion. However, officials in his court opposed him. In the fourteenth year of his reign, Beopheung's "Grand Secretary", [[Ichadon]], devised a strategy to overcome court opposition. Ichadon schemed with the king, convincing him to make a proclamation granting Buddhism official state sanction using the royal seal. Ichadon told the king to deny having made such a proclamation when the opposing officials received it and demanded an explanation. Instead, Ichadon would confess and accept the punishment of execution, for what would quickly be seen as a forgery. Ichadon prophesied to the king that at his execution a wonderful miracle would convince the opposing court faction of Buddhism's power. Ichadon's scheme went as planned, and the opposing officials took the bait. When Ichadon was executed on the 15th day of the 9th month in 527, his prophecy was fulfilled; the earth shook, the sun was darkened, beautiful flowers rained from the sky, his severed head flew to the sacred Geumgang mountains, and milk instead of blood sprayed 100 feet in the air from his beheaded corpse. The omen was accepted by the opposing court officials as a manifestation of heaven's approval, and Buddhism was made the state religion in 527.&lt;ref&gt;Korea: a religious history, James Huntley Grayson, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

==China==
In ancient Chinese, prophetic texts are known as [[Chen prophecy|Chen]] (谶).  The most famous Chinese prophecy is the [[Tui bei tu]] (推背圖).

==Christianity==
{{See also|Predictions and claims for the Second Coming of Christ|Unfulfilled Christian religious predictions|Prophets of Christianity}}
The [[New Testament]] refers to prophecy as one of the [[spiritual gifts]] given by the indwelling [[Holy Spirit]]{{Bibleref2c|Rom|12:6}}. From this, many Christians believe that the gift of prophecy is the [[supernatural]] ability to receive and convey a message from their God. The purpose of the message may be to "edify, exhort and comfort" the members of the Church. In this context, not all prophecies contain [[predictions]] about the future. The [[Apostle Paul]] teaches in [[First Epistle to the Corinthians|First Corinthians]] that prophecy is for the benefit of the whole Church and not just of the individual exercising the gift.{{Bibleref2c|1Cor|14:22||1 Cor. 14:22}}

According to [[Walter Brueggemann]], the task of prophetic (Christian) ministry is to nurture, nourish and evoke a consciousness and perception alternative to the consciousness and perception of the dominant culture.&lt;ref&gt;[[Walter Brueggemann]], The Prophetic Imagination, (Minneapolis, MN: Fortress Press, 1978), 13.&lt;/ref&gt; A recognized form of Christian prophecy is the "prophetic drama" which [[Frederick William Dillistone|Frederick Dillistone]] describes as a "metaphorical conjunction between present situations and future events".&lt;ref&gt;F.W.Dillstone; Christianity and Symbolism; London 1955, p275; referenced in 'The function of prophetic drama' in "The place is too small for us": the Israelite prophets in recent scholarship, by R. P. Gordon, 1995 Eisenbrauns, (cf Galatians 4:24)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later Christianity===
In his ''[[Dialogue with Trypho]]'', [[Justin Martyr]] argued that prophets were no longer among Israel but were in the Church.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} ''[[The Shepherd of Hermas]]'', written around the mid-2nd century, describes the way prophecy was being used within the church of that time. [[Irenaeus]] confirms the existence of such spiritual gifts in his ''[[Against Heresies]]''. Although some modern commentators claim that [[Montanus]] was rejected because he claimed to be a prophet, a careful examination of history shows that the gift of prophecy was still acknowledged during the time of Montanus, and that he was controversial because of the manner in which he prophesied and the doctrines he propagated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newadvent.org/fathers/250105.htm Eusebius of Caesarea, Church History, Book V, Chapter 16 &amp; 18] Montanus...became beside himself, and being suddenly in a sort of frenzy and ecstasy, he raved, and began to babble and utter strange things, prophesying in a manner contrary to the constant custom of the Church handed down by tradition from the beginning.... His actions and his teaching show who this new teacher is. This is he who taught the dissolution of marriage; who made laws for fasting; who named Pepuza and Tymion, small towns in Phrygia, Jerusalem, wishing to gather people to them from all directions; who appointed collectors of money; who contrived the receiving of gifts under the name of offerings; who provided salaries for those who preached his doctrine, that its teaching might prevail through gluttony.&lt;/ref&gt;

Prophecy and other spiritual gifts were somewhat rarely acknowledged throughout church history and there are few examples of the prophetic and certain other gifts until the Scottish [[Covenanter]]s like [[Prophet Peden]] and [[John Wishart (bishop)|John Wishart]]. From 1904 to 1906, the [[Azusa Street Revival]] occurred in Los Angeles, California and is sometimes considered the birthplace of [[Pentecostalism]]. This revival is well known for the "[[speaking in tongues]]" that occurred there. Some participants of the Azusa Street Revival are claimed to have prophesied. Pentecostals believe prophecy and certain other gifts are once again being given to Christians. The [[Charismatic Movement]] also accepts spiritual gifts like speaking in tongues and prophecy.

Since 1972, the [[neo-Pentecostal]] [[Church of God Ministry of Jesus Christ International]] has expressed a belief in prophecy. The church claims this gift is manifested by one person (the prophesier) laying their hands on another person, who receives an individual message said by the prophesier. Prophesiers are believed to be used by the [[Holy Spirit (Christianity)|Holy Ghost]] as instruments through whom their God expresses his promises, advice and commandments. The church claims people receive messages about their future, in the form of promises given by their God and expected to be fulfilled by divine action.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20121025080417/http://www.idmji.org/index.php/en/historiaiglesia History of the Church of God Ministry of Jesus Christ International (official page)]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, the [[Apostolic-Prophetic Movement]] came on the scene, largely due to the influence of the Toronto, Brownsville and Kansas City revivals. Along with the Charismatic Movement's speaking in tongues and prophecy, the Prophetic Movement distinguished itself from past movements with physical twitching, moaning, sightings of gold dust, "glory clouds" and gems that (allegedly) fell from heaven.&lt;ref&gt;Maxwell, Joe (1994).

===Latter Day Saint movement===
{{See also|Joseph Smith|Revelation (Latter Day Saints)}}
The [[Latter Day Saint movement]] maintains that its first prophet, [[Joseph Smith]], was visited by [[God in Mormonism|God]] and Jesus Christ in 1820. The Latter Day Saints further claims that God communicated directly with Joseph Smith on many subsequent occasions, and that following the death of Joseph Smith God has continued to speak through subsequent prophets. Joseph Smith claims to have been led by an angel to a large hill in upstate New York, where he was shown an ancient manuscript engraved on plates of gold metal. Joseph Smith claimed to have translated this manuscript into modern English under divine inspiration by the gift and power of God, and the publication of this translation are known as the [[Book of Mormon]].

Following Smith's murder, there was a [[Succession crisis (Latter Day Saints)|succession crisis]] that resulted in a great schism. The majority of [[Latter-day Saints]] believing [[Brigham Young]] to be the next prophet and following him out to Utah, while a minority returned to Missouri with Emma Smith, believing Joseph Smith Junior's son, [[Joseph Smith III]], to be the next legitimate prophet (forming the [[Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], now the Community of Christ). Since even before the death of Joseph Smith in 1844, there have been numerous separatist [[List of sects in the Latter Day Saint movement|Latter Day Saint sects]] that have splintered from the [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints]]. To this day, there are an unknown number of organizations within the Latter Day Saint Movement, each with their own proposed prophet.

The [[Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) is the largest Latter Day Saint body. The current [[President of the Church (LDS Church)|Prophet/President]] of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints is Russell M. Nelson. The church has, since [[Death of Joseph Smith|Joseph Smith's death]] on June 27, 1844, held a belief that the president of their church is also a literal prophet of God, and the only true prophet on the earth. The church also maintains that further revelations claimed to have been given through Joseph Smith are published in the [[Doctrine and Covenants]], one of the [[Standard Works]]. Additional revelations and prophecies outside the Standard Works, such as Joseph Smith's "[[White Horse Prophecy]]", concerning a great and final war in the United States before the Second Coming of Jesus Christ, can be found in other church published works.

==Islam==
{{See also|Prophets in Islam}}

[[Muslims]] believe that the [[Quran]] predicted many events years before they happened and that such prophecies are proof of the divine origin of the Qur'an. The Qur'an itself states "For every prophecy is a term, and you will come to know (it)." {{quran-usc|6|67}} Muslims also recognize the validity of some prophecies in other sacred texts like in the [[Bible]]; however, they believe that, unlike the Qur'an, some parts of the Bible have been corrupted over the years, and as a result, not all of the prophecies and verses in the Bible are accurate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://islam.thetruecall.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=357 The Corruption of the Bible – A Fact Attested by the Quran" The True Call] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120904131728/http://islam.thetruecall.com/modules.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=357 |date=2012-09-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Saul 1878.jpg|thumb|''David and Saul'', detail from an 1878 oil painting, Nationalmuseum, Stockholm]]

The Hebrew term for prophet, ''[[Neviim|Navi]]'', literally means "spokesperson"; he speaks to the people as a mouthpiece of their [[god in Judaism|God]], and to their god on behalf of the people. "The name ''prophet,'' from the Greek meaning "forespeaker" (πρὸ being used in the original local sense), is an equivalent of the Hebrew נבוא, which signifies properly a delegate or mouthpiece of another." A major theme of the [[Nevi'im]] is [[social justice]].&lt;ref name="JE-Prophecy"/&gt;

Frederic|last3=Jacobs|first3=Joseph|title=PROPHETS AND PROPHECY|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/12389-prophets-and-prophecy|website=Jewish Encyclopedia|publisher=JewishEncyclopedia.com|accessdate=26 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Malachi]] is acknowledged to have been the last authentic prophet if one accepts the opinion that [[Nechemyah]] died in Babylon before 9th Tevet 3448 (313 BCE).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | title = Babylonian Talmud | first = Vilna |last=Gaon |authorlink=Vilna Gaon| volume = San.11a, Yom.9a/Yuch.1.14/Kuz.3.39,65,67/Yuch.1/Mag.Av.O.C.580.6 | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}} 
&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Torah]] contains laws concerning the ''false prophet'' (Deuteronomy 13:2-6, 18:20-22). Prophets in Christianity like [[Jesus]], or prophets in Islam like [[Lot in Islam|Lot]], for example, are false prophets according to Jewish standards.&lt;ref name="JE-False_Prophet"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schechter|first1=Solomon|last2=Mendelsohn|first2=S.|title=PROPHET, FALSE|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/12388-prophet-false|website=Jewish Encyclopedia|publisher=JewishEncyclopedia.com|accessdate=26 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Torah, prophecy often consisted of a conditioned warning by their [[God]] of the consequences should the society, specific communities, or their leaders not adhere to Torah's instructions in the time contemporary with the prophet's life. Prophecies sometimes included conditioned promises of blessing for obeying their god, and returning to behaviors and laws as written in the Torah. Conditioned warning prophecies feature in all Jewish works of the [[Tanakh]].
 
Notably [[Maimonides]], philosophically suggested there once were many levels of prophecy, from the highest such as those experienced by [[Moses]], to the lowest where the individuals were able to apprehend the Divine Will, but not respond or even describe this experience to others, citing in example, Shem, Eber and most notably, [[Noah in rabbinic literature|Noah]], who, in biblical narrative, does not issue prophetic declarations.&lt;ref&gt;The Guide for the Perplexed /Part II/Chapter XXXIX&lt;/ref&gt;

Maimonides, in his philosophical work ''[[The Guide for the Perplexed]]'', outlines twelve modes of prophecy&lt;ref&gt;The Guide for the Perplexed (Friedlander)/Part II/Chapters#CHAPTER XLV&lt;/ref&gt; from lesser to greater degree of clarity:

# Inspired actions
# Inspired words
# [[Allegorical]] [[dream]] revelations
# [[Auditory imagery|Auditory]] dream revelations
# Audiovisual dream revelations/human speaker
# Audiovisual dream revelations/angelic speaker
# Audiovisual dream revelations/Divine speaker
# Allegorical waking [[Vision (spirituality)|vision]]
# Auditory waking revelation
# Audiovisual waking revelation/human speaker
# Audiovisual waking revelation/angelic speaker
# Audiovisual waking revelation/Divine speaker (that refers implicitly to Moses)

The Tanakh contains prophecies from various [[Prophets in Judaism|Hebrew prophets]] (55 in total) who communicated messages from God to the [[nation of Israel]], and later the population of [[Judea]] and elsewhere. Experience of prophecy in the Torah and the rest of Tanakh was not restricted to Jews. Nor was the prophetic experience restricted to the [[Hebrew]] language.

==Native American prophecy==
There exists a problem in verifying most Native American prophecy, in that they remain primarily an [[oral tradition]], and thus there is no way to cite references of where writings have been committed to paper. In their system, the best reference is an Elder, who acts as a repository of the accumulated wisdom of their tradition.

In another type of example, it is recorded that there are three [[Tli Cho|Dogrib]] prophets who had claimed to have been divinely inspired to bring the message of Christianity's God to their people.&lt;ref&gt;p.27, Helm&lt;/ref&gt; This prophecy among the Dogrib involves elements such as dances and trance-like states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://texts.00.gs/Dogrib_prophecy.htm|title=Dogrib prophecy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nostradamus==
[[Esotericism|Esoteric]] prophecy has been claimed for, but not by, Michel de Nostredame, popularly referred to as [[Nostradamus]], who claimed to be a [[Conversion to Christianity|converted Christian]]. It is known that he suffered several tragedies in his life, and was persecuted to some degree for his cryptic esoteric writings about the future, reportedly derived through a use of a [[crystal ball]]. Nostradamus was a French [[apothecary]] and reputed seer who published collections of foreknowledge of future events. He is best known for his book ''Les Propheties'' ("The Prophecies"), the first edition of which appeared in 1555. Since its publication, Nostradamus has attracted an esoteric following that, along with the popularistic press, credits him with foreseeing world events. His esoteric cryptic foreseeings have in some cases been assimilated to the results of applying the alleged [[Bible code]], as well as to other purported pseudo-prophetic works.

Most reliable academic sources maintain that the associations made between world events and Nostradamus's [[quatrain]]s are largely the result of misinterpretations or mistranslations (sometimes deliberate) or else are so tenuous as to render them useless as evidence of any genuine predictive power. Moreover, none of the sources listed offers any evidence that anyone has ever interpreted any of Nostradamus's pseudo-prophetic works specifically enough to allow a clear identification of any event in advance.&lt;ref name = "ref2"&gt;Lemesurier, Peter, ''The Unknown Nostradamus'', 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

==Skepticism==
According to skeptics, many apparently fulfilled prophecies can be explained as [[coincidence]]s (possibly aided by the prophecy's own vagueness), or that some prophecies were actually invented after the fact to match the circumstances of a past event ("[[postdiction]]").&lt;ref name="Hines 2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pickover 2001"&gt;[[Clifford A. Pickover|Pickover, Clifford A]]. (2001). ''Dreaming the Future: The Fantastic Story of Prediction''. Prometheus Books. pp. 363-388. {{ISBN|1-57392-895-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Forshaw, Mark. (2012). ''Critical Thinking for Psychology''. Wiley. pp. 46-48. {{ISBN|978-1-4051-9118-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bill Whitcomb in ''The Magician's Companion'' observes, &lt;blockquote&gt;One point to remember is that the probability of an event changes as soon as a prophecy (or divination) exists. . . . The accuracy or outcome of any prophecy is altered by the desires and attachments of the seer and those who hear the prophecy.&lt;ref&gt;Whitcomb, Bill. (2004). ''The Magician's Companion: A Practical &amp; Encyclopedic Guide to Magical &amp; Religious Symbolism''. Llewellyn Publications. pp. 530-531. {{ISBN|0-87542-868-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Many prophets make a large number of prophecies. This makes the chances of at least one prophecy being correct much higher by sheer weight of numbers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skepticreport.com/sr/?p=449 Skeptic report, Prophesies for dummies by Allan Glenn]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychology==
The phenomenon of prophecy is not well understood in psychology research literature.  Psychiatrist and neurologist Arthur Deikman describes the phenomenon as an "intuitive knowing, a type of perception that bypasses the usual sensory channels and rational intellect."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = Deikman, A. J. |year = 1982 |title = The Observing self: Mysticism and psychotherapy |publisher = Beacon Press |location = Boston | page = 21 |isbn = 0-8070-2950-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"(P)rophecy can be likened to a bridge between the individual 'mystical self' and the communal 'mystical body'," writes religious sociologist [[Margaret Poloma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = Poloma, Margaret |year = 2003 |title = Main street mystics: The Toronto blessing &amp; reviving Pentecostalism |publisher = Alta Mira Press |location = Walnut Creek, CA | page = 115 |isbn = 0-7591-0353-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prophecy seems to involve "the free association that occurred through the workings of the right brain."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = Poloma, M. M. |year = 2003 |title = Main street mystics: The Toronto blessing &amp; reviving Pentecostalism |publisher = Alta Mira Press |location = Walnut Creek, CA | page = 126 |isbn = 0-7591-0353-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologist Julian Jaynes proposed that this is a temporary accessing of the bicameral mind; that is, a temporary separating of functions, such that the authoritarian part of the mind seems to literally be speaking to the person as if a separate (and external) voice.  Jaynes posits that the gods heard as voices in the head were and are organizations of the central nervous system. God speaking through man, according to Jaynes, is a more recent vestige of God speaking to man; the product of a more integrated higher self. When the bicameral mind speaks, there is no introspection.  We simply experience the Lord telling us what to do.  In earlier times, posits Jaynes, there was additionally a visual component, now lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = Jaynes, J. |year = 1976 |title = Main street mystics: The origins of consciousness in the breakdown of the bicameral mind |publisher = Houghton Mifflin Company |location = Boston | page = 74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Child development and consciousness author [[Joseph Chilton Pearce]] remarked that revelation typically appears in symbolic form and "in a single flash of insight."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = Pearce, J. C. |year = 2002–2004 |title = The Biology of Transcendence: A blueprint of the human spirit |publisher = Inner Traditions International |location = Rochester, VT | page = 191 |isbn = 0-89281-990-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He used the metaphor of lightning striking and suggests that the revelation is "a result of a buildup of resonant potential."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Biology of Transcendence|author = Pearce, J. C. | page = 192}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Pearce compared it to the earth asking a question and the sky answering it. Focus, he said, feeds into "a unified field of like resonance (and becomes) capable of attracting and receiving the field's answer when it does form."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Biology of Transcendence|author = Pearce, J. C. | pages = 194 &amp; 196}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some cite aspects of [[cognitive psychology]] such as pattern forming and attention to the formation of prophecy in modern-day society as well as the declining influence of religion in daily life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebeginner.eu/curious/481-the-fallacy-of-prophecy |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-04-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110425152322/http://www.thebeginner.eu/curious/481-the-fallacy-of-prophecy |archivedate=2011-04-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Written in 2005, [[Moscow]], ''''' Rough Draft'''''  by [[Sergey Lukyanenko]] is a [[fantasy novel]] of the "[[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel world]]" genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John Adams|title=Other Worlds Than These|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1wdOAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA551|date=26 June 2012|publisher=Night Shade Books|isbn=978-1-59780-433-2|page=551}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was followed by ''[[Final Draft (novel)|Final Draft]]''.

==Plot introduction==
Kirill, a Russian living in [[Moscow]], one day discovers that he has the ability to go to other [[Parallel universe (fiction)|worlds parallel]] to our [[Earth]].

==Plot summary==

The story starts with the [[hero]], Kirill, being "erased" from daily life in [[Moscow|present-day Moscow]]. Everybody forgets him (even his parents and dog), another person lives in his apartment, all IDs and files in all offices disappear. After a while he is phoned and invited to an old water tower — but inside is his future home and working place. There it is revealed to him that he is able to open doors, leading to other worlds — although at first all but one are locked. Once opened each door becomes rigidly connected to some world, but which one can't be predicted. All of the worlds have mostly similar environments and seem to be on the planet Earth but the societies and people are different.

After a while Kirill meets a special group of '''''functionals''''', so called because they gained supernatural abilities making them excellent in some profession. They serve other people, but mostly other functionals. They say Kirill has become one of them — a ''customs officer''. He benefits from taxes paid by people who pass through his tower. Also he has [[superhuman]] strength and is almost immortal, but only within 10&amp;nbsp;km of his tower.

Kirill enjoys these new worlds, people and abilities. A politician Dima meets him and asks to find a national idea for Russia. He informs Kirill about the world number One, which nobody can access and which seems to be exactly our world living 30 years later. Critical information from this world may enhance the prestige of the country.

Kirill also encounters an [[Resistance movement|underground]], that is, a few people fighting against the 'corporate laws' of functionals and their working for themselves or the elites of other worlds. He remains untouched by the rhetoric of the underground, justifying most of this. Ideas of armed opposition are alien if not to say ridiculous for him. However, a younger woman whom Kirill falls in love with is a genuine underground [[activist]]...

The last door opened leads to the world number One: A lovely Moscow filled with smiling people: there were no horrors of [[Russian Revolution|revolution]] and no [[World War II]], as this world ''lags'' for 30 years and the rulers of it carefully study the mistakes of other worlds. It's just what Dima proposed to Kirill, but applied in reverse.

Upon rather bloody returning to our world, Kirill faces troubles with his girl. Hating the system of functionals, she manifests disobedience. But their laws don't forgive this, and the functional Natalie murders her, Kirill being unable to resurrect her...

:''"An extreme foolishness," said I, "All these loud words and beautiful poses... 'they will not pass', 'yet it moves', 'motherland or death', 'am able to die for my beliefs' — all of this becomes nonsense when real death comes... All of this is for kids. And for adults who handle them..."
:''Natalie nodded with approval.''
:''"But yet it moves" said I, "Doesn't it? It moves, and they will not pass, and motherland remains motherland even if death becomes death, and nobody is ready to die, but sometimes it's easier to die than to betray..."''

In Kirill's fighting Natalie, his tower becomes devastated, thus he ceases being a functional and is restored to his former life.

&lt;!--Я провел ладонью по лицу Насти, закрывая ей глаза. Поправил выбившуюся из брюк блузку. Встал. Пожаловался Наталье:
— Не понимаю, зачем она это брякнула. Про то, что лучше умереть стоя. Ведь полицейский согласился дать нам шанс… Он не соврал?
— Нет. Ей бы позволили жить.
— Глупость несусветная, — сказал я. — Все эти громкие слова и красивые позы… «они не пройдут», «все— таки она вертится», «родина или смерть», «готов умереть за свои убеждения» — все это становится чушью, когда приходит настоящая смерть… Все это — для детей. И для взрослых, которые ими манипулируют…
Наталья одобрительно кивнула.
— Но она все таки вертится, — сказал я. — Ведь так? Она вертится, а они не пройдут, родина остается родиной, даже если смерть становится смертью, и никто не готов умереть, но иногда проще умереть, чем предать… ты некрасивая злая баба, которую никто и никогда не любил просто так, ты даже в наш мир пришла не оттого, что свой любишь, тебе нужна только власть.

== Universes in ''Rough Draft'' ==

''Rough Draft'' features a number of [[Parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universes]]. The precise number of them is unknown, with the later parts of the book suggesting that there may be many more universes than most Functionals are aware of. The only way to travel between these universes is through watchtowers, which exist in several universes at once (though the way they appear differs with each respective universe). The functionals refer to the universes by official numerical designations and more colloquial [[nicknames]]. Those nicknames are not always consistent - for example, functions and their allies tend to refer to Earth 3 by the name of a [[city-state]] that's closest to the [[watchtower]] they use to get there.

*'''Earth 1''' (Arkan) - a universe 35 years "behind" Earth 2. It's a home universe of the functionals.
*'''Earth 2''' (Demos) - Kirill's home universe. It's the most technologically advanced inhabited universe in the "Fan". Named so for its widespread use of [[democracy]], which is considered to be an archaic form of government in other worlds.
*'''Earth 3''' (Veroz) - a world where the humanity lives in numerous city-states scattered throughout the planet. [[Australia]] is an unexplored continent and the sea is filled with creatures that are regarded as legendary elsewhere (such as the [[Kraken]]). Oil doesn't exist on Earth 3, so steam is a primary power source among the natives.
*'''Earth 4''' (Antik) - a world that, in many respects, evokes a Greco-Roman [[utopia]]. For example, slaves are allowed to rebel twice a year. If they succeed, they can become free citizens and have their own slaves.
*'''Earth 5''' - a world where human beings mate in cycles, coming into heat during the spring. It's more advanced than Earth 3 but less advanced than Earth 2.
*'''Earth 6''' (Tverd) - a world dominated by repressive [[theocracies]]. The dominant church practices a "warped, lethargic" version of Christianity. This world is known for comparatively advanced [[bio-technology]] and ignorance of [[electricity]].
*'''Earth 14''' (Janus) - a world with bitterly cold winters and hot summers. Spring is the only season when the weather is anywhere close to tolerable. This version of Earth has no moon and no magnetic field. Although most functionals assume Earth 14 is uninhabited, a functional Kirill encountered in ''Final Draft'' insisted that there was some animal and human life that survived by migrating along with the spring weather.
*'''Earth 16''' - a world where Earth changed little over the course of billions of years. It's volcanically active, radioactive, oxygen-poor and generally inhospitable to living organisms, but it is stated in Final Draft that animal-like voices are sometimes heard from there.
*'''Earth 17''' (Preserve) - a world completely devoid of human life. It's a popular resort among the Functionals and their allies.
*'''Earth 22''' (Nirvana) - a universe with no native animal life. The planet's surface is covered with plants that produce a narcotic substance that puts any human being within proximity into a drugged stupor. Functionals use this universe as a political prison for their enemies. The children born in this universe are more resistant to the effects of the plants than their parents, but they aren't completely immune.

==History==
Over the years, Science Week Ireland has grown from a small pilot initiative to a large promotional and event engine to its current identity as a recognised vehicle for regional activity supported by a national promotional campaign.&lt;ref name="oak1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ahlstrom|first1=Dick|title=Science Week: From small acorn to giant oak tree . . .|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/sponsored/science-week-from-small-acorn-to-giant-oak-tree-1.2403471|website=The Irish Times|publisher=The Irish Times|accessdate=18 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
The first Science Week in Ireland was held in 1996.&lt;ref name="oak1"/&gt; It was organised by Forfás on behalf of the Office of Science and Technology at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation under the name 'Information Technology and Science Week'. The week aimed to raise general awareness of the benefits of science and information technology to people, young and old throughout society. In 1997 it was renamed as Science Week. Professional bodies, voluntary groups, colleges, businesses and the public sector combined to organise 50 events countrywide.&lt;ref name="oak1"/&gt; Events included conferences, lectures, interactive exhibitions, debates, and competitions for primary school students. 

SFI took over Science Week from the Forfás Discover Science and Engineering programme in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New legislation to focus scientific research on turning good ideas into good jobs|url=https://www.irishbuildingmagazine.ie/2012/12/12/new-legislation-to-focus-scientific-research-on-turning-good-ideas-into-good-jobs|publisher=Irish Building Magazine|accessdate=14 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Science Week continued to grow and develop over the following years into what it represents today, a week-long&lt;ref name="sfi ie1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Science Week|url=http://www.sfi.ie/engagement/science-week/|website=sfi.ie|publisher=Science Foundation Ireland|accessdate=19 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; celebration of STEM public engagement, enhancing the public’s interest in STEM and enabling them to see the relevance of STEM to their daily lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Science Foundation Ireland Discover Programme Call 2017|url=http://www.sfi.ie/funding/funding-calls/sfi-discover-programme/1.-SFI-Discover-Programme-Call-2017-FINAL.pdf|website=Science Foundation Ireland|accessdate=18 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22938">'''Sex-limited genes''' are [[gene]]s that are present in both sexes of [[Sexual reproduction|sexually reproducing]] [[species]] but are expressed in only one sex and remain 'turned off' in the other. In other words, sex-limited genes cause the two sexes to show different [[Trait (biology)|traits]] or [[phenotype]]s, despite having the same [[genotype]]. This term is restricted to [[autosomal]] traits, and should not be confused with [[sex-linked]] characteristics, which have to do with genetic differences on the sex chromosomes (see [[sex-determination system]]). Sex-limited genes are also distinguished from [http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/sex-influenced sex-influenced] genes, where the same gene will show differential expression in each sex. Sex-influenced genes commonly show a dominant/recessive relationship, where the same gene will have a dominant effect in one sex and a recessive effect in the other (for example, [[male pattern baldness]]).

Sex-limited genes are responsible for  [[sexual dimorphism]], which is a phenotypic (directly observable) difference between males and females of the same species. These differences can be reflected in size, color, behavior (ex: levels of aggression), and [[Morphology (biology)|morphology]]. An example of sex-limited genes are genes which instruct the male [[elephant seal]]s to grow big and fight, at the same time instructing female seals to grow small and avoid fights.&lt;ref name="Ancestors_Tale"&gt;{{cite book

The overall point of sex-limited genes is to resolve intralocus [[sexual conflict]]. In other words, these genes try to resolve the "push-pull" between males and females over trait values for optimal phenotype. Without these genes, organisms would be forced to settle on an ''average ''trait value, incurring costs on both sexes. With these genes, it is possible to 'turn off' the [[genes]] in one sex, allowing both sexes to attain (or at least, approach very closely) their optimal phenotypes.

== A brief history ==
Unsurprisingly, the idea of sex-limited genes was initially developed by [[Charles Darwin]] himself in 1871 in his book ''The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Darwin|first=Charles|title=The Descent of Man and Selection in Relation to Sex|year=1871|publisher=A. L. Burt|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; He does not distinguish between sex-limited, sex-linked, and sex-influenced genes, but refers to any gene that expresses differently between sexes as sex-limited. While this concept was still in its infancy, Darwin catalyzed the further development of sex-related selection. [[Thomas Hunt Morgan]], fully aware of this confusing terminology, published an article in ''The American Naturalist ''in 1914 titled "Sex-Linked and Sex-Limited Inheritance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morgan|first=Thomas Hunt|title=Sex-Limited and Sex-Linked Inheritance|journal=The American Naturalist|date=October 1914|volume=48|issue=574|pages=577–583|doi=10.1086/279432}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This article directly acknowledges that Darwin applied the term sex-limited whenever a characteristic seemed specific to one sex. Morgan proposes the definitions for sex-linked genes and sex-limited genes that we still use today (and that were defined in the introduction above). This paper helped to distinguish between these two similar concepts and clarify much confusion in the scientific community at the time. Morgan's paper was followed by several others involving sex-limited genes and their expression as traits. One of the more notable examples is John H. Gerould's "Inheritance of White Wing Color, a Sex-Limited (Sex-Controlled) Variation in Yellow Pierid Butterflies," published in ''Genetics ''in 1923 (and edited slightly in 1924).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gerould|first=John H.|title=Inheritance of White Wing Color, a Sex-Limited (Sex-Controlled) Variation in Yellow Pierid Butterflies|journal=Genetics|date=November 1923|volume=8|issue=6|pages=495–551|pmid=17246025|pmc=1200764}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gerould observed that in this species of butterfly, females naturally occur as yellow or white, while males only occur with yellow coloration. He extensively explores this apparently sex-limited trait from a genetic perspective in this ground-breaking 50 page paper. To conclude the notable advancements in the early stages of the development of sex-limited genes, a brief discussion of [[R. A. Fisher]] is necessary. Commonly hailed as one of the best evolutionary biologists of his time, Fisher was also a talented geneticist. His book ''The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection'', published in 1930, over 20 years before the double-helix shape of DNA was discovered, was the first attempt to explain Darwin's theories within the foundation of [[genetics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fisher|first=R. A.|title=The Genetical Theory of Natural Selection|year=1930|publisher=Clarendon|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Chapter 6 of this book is titled "Sexual Reproduction and Sexual Selection" and includes a genetic interpretation of Darwin's initial idea of sex-limited genes. After these groundbreaking works, papers continue to be published further exploring the causes, mechanisms, evolutionary advantages, and more of sex-limited genes.

== Genetics ==

Many studies have been published exploring the genetic basis of sex-limited genes. One paper, published in ''Evolution'', evaluates the hypothesis that sex-limited traits can arise in two ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Coyne|first=Jerry|author2=Emily H. Kay |author3=Stephen Pruett-Jones |title=The Genetic Basis of Sexual Dimorphism in Birds|journal=Evolution|year=2007|volume=61|issue=1|pages=214–219|url=http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=e0633a8f-63ff-4144-87f2-56e7da405b85%40sessionmgr112&amp;vid=2&amp;hid=113|accessdate=14 October 2013|doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.2007.00254.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[alleles]] responsible for sexual dimorphism can be limited to expression in only one sex when they first appear, or the alleles could begin by being expressed in both sexes then become modified (repressed or promoted) in one sex by modifier genes or regulatory elements. The concept of this study was to examine female [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrids]] from species where males displayed different types of ornamental traits (elongated feathers, wattles, color patches). The assumption is that different hypotheses about male-specific expression will yield different results in female hybrids. The methods and materials of the experiment are discussed in detail in the paper, but the important result that emerged was that NO female hybrids expressed any of the ornamental traits found in the parent males. Two interpretations of these results are possible: the dimorphic alleles were initially only expressed in males, or the alleles were initially expressed in both and then were suppressed in females or became limited to males by regulatory regions that are ''completely dominant'' in hybrids. The most likely genomic explanation for initial expression in both species then modification is involvement of ''cis''-dominance, where the factors that modify the gene are located next to the gene on the [[chromosome]]. (This is in contrast to ''trans''-dominance, where mobile products that can affect distant genes are produced.) These factors can be in the form of [[Promoter regions (genetics)|promoter regions]], which can be either be suppressed or activated by [[hormones]]. This experiment also demonstrates that these alleles come under regulatory control very quickly. This is because none of the ornamentation seen in males is seen in the ''very next ''generation. These conclusions make it likely that at least some male-specific (thus, sex-limited) genes cue their expression by hormone levels - the absence of [[estrogen]] or the presence of [[testosterone]].

== Fitness consequences ==

===Storage effect===
Because sex-limited genes are present in both sexes but only expressed in one, this allows the unexpressed genes to be hidden from selection. On a short-term scale, this means that during one generation, only the sex that expresses the sex-limited trait(s) of interest will be affected by selection. The remaining half of the gene pool for these traits will be unaffected by selection because they are hidden (unexpressed) in the genes of the other sex. Since a portion of the alleles for these sex-limited traits are hidden from selection, this occurrence has been termed 'storage-effect'. On a long-term scale, this storage effect can have significant effects on selection, especially if selection is fluctuating over a long period of time. It is inarguable that selection will fluctuate over time with varying levels of environmental stability. For example, fluctuations in population density can drive selection on sex-limited traits. In less dense populations, females will have less opportunity to choose between males for reproduction. In this case, attractive males may experience both reduced reproductive success and increased predation pressure. Thus, selection on males for sex-limited traits such as increased size (elephant seals) and weaponry (claws on fiddler crabs, horns on rhinoceros beetles) will change direction with fluctuation in population density.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reinhold|first=K|title=Evolutionary Genetics Of Sex-Limited Traits Under Fluctuating Selection|journal=Journal of Evolutionary Biology|year=1999|volume=12|issue=5|pages=897–902|doi=10.1046/j.1420-9101.1999.00092.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rapid evolution===
John Parsch and Hans Ellegren defined "genes that differ in expression between females and males" as sex-biased genes. While this definition is more broad, sex-limited genes are certainly included in this category. One of the key principles of sex-biased gene expression that Parsch and Ellegren stressed in their paper in February 2013&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Parsch|first=J|author2=Ellegren, H |title=The Evolutionary Causes and Consequences of Sex-Biased Gene Expression|journal=Nature Reviews Genetics|year=2013|volume=14|issue=2|pages=83–87|doi=10.1038/nrg3376|pmid=23329110}}&lt;/ref&gt; is that of rapid evolution. They assert that a gene's sex bias can vary among different types of tissues throughout the body or throughout development, making the level of sex bias a fluid, rather than static, property. This makes it possible, then, that the rapid evolution seen in sex-biased genes is not an inherent property of their sex bias, but a property of some other feature. The paper offers expression breadth, the number of tissue types in which the genes are expressed, as an example of a feature correlated to sex-biased genes. It is known that genes with limited expression (in only one type of tissue) generally evolve faster than those with a higher expression breadth, and sex-biased genes are often restricted in their expression, such as to only the testes or ovaries. Thus, it is likely that sex-biased (including sex-limited) genes will evolve faster than the average genetic information. Parsch and Ellegren also assert that "sex-biased genes expressed only in sex-limited reproductive tissues evolve faster than unbiased genes that are expressed only in a single, non-reproductive tissue." That is, genes that have a bias toward any kind of reproductive tissue (testes or ovaries) seem to show faster evolution than genes expressed in non-gonadal tissues, despite the number of tissues in which they are expressed. This makes sense in the context of genes with reproductive function evolving more quickly, a generally observed pattern in [[evolutionary biology]].

===Effects of sexual antagonism===
Sexual antagonism occurs when two species have conflicting optimal fitness strategies concerning reproduction (see link in introduction paragraph). Multiple matings is a classic example of competing optimal strategies. Males, who typically have a much lower overall investment in reproduction, may benefit from more frequent matings. Females, however, invest much more in reproduction and can be endangered, harmed, or even killed by multiple matings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Reinhardt|first=Klaus|author2=Richard Naylor |author3=Michael Siva-Jothy |title=Reducing a cost of traumatic insemination: female bedbugs evolve a unique organ.|journal=Proc. R. Soc. B|date=22 November 2003|volume=270|issue=1531|pages=2371–2375|doi=10.1098/rspb.2003.2515|pmid=14667353|pmc=1691512}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Hosken et al. completed an important study exploring the effects of [[sexual conflict|sexually antagonistic selection]] on sex-limited trait expression.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  They asked if sex-specific trait selection always resolved intralocus conflict, as it was believed to do. By using a species of flour beetle, ''Gnatocerus cornutus'', exhibiting sex-limited traits in the form of exaggerated [[Mandible (arthropod mouthpart)|mandible]] size, they were able to test this hypothesis. Exaggerated mandibles are ''only ''developed in males; females never develop exaggerated mandibles. The point of this experiment was to determine how mandibles affect fitness. If these sex-limited genes are truly quelling intralocus sexual conflict, male mandible size should have no effect on female fitness. After selecting for males with exaggerated mandibles (full materials and methods can be found within the paper), it was experimentally determined that males with exaggerated mandibles had a higher fitness - they experienced increased fighting and mating success. It was also found, however, that females found in the populations of males with exaggerated mandibles had lower fitness (as determined by lifetime reproductive success, LRS) relative to the fitness of females in populations with males with smaller mandibles. Since this male sex-limited trait affects female fitness, intralocus sexual conflict has ''not ''been resolved. This highlights the importance of sexual conflict to [[evolution]], because it cannot simply be defused by sex-limited trait expression.

Later the same year, a paper in ''Evolution ''also came to the same conclusions about sexual antagonism in relation to sex-limited genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Connallon|first=Tim|author2=Robert M. Cox |author3=Ryan Calsbeek |title=Fitness Consequences of Sex-Specific Selection|journal=Evolution|year=2010|volume=64|issue=6|pages=1671–1682|doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.2009.00934.x|pmid=20050912}}&lt;/ref&gt; They developed a mathematical model to show that the fitness costs of sexual antagonism, even when rare, will usually overwhelm the benefits of sexually concordant selection. (Sexually concordant selection occurs when selection favors the same alleles in both sexes but differs in relative strength between them.) Through several advanced calculations, they concluded that even a small relative amount of sexual antagonism will overwhelm any benefit harvested from sexually concordant selection. Coming to the same conclusion as Hosken et al., they demonstrated mathematically that when sex-limited gene expression attempts to resolve sexual antagonism, it is likely to produce negative long-term fitness consequences. This result is seen in the experiment with beetles above, where the females demonstrate reduced fitness in response to males selected for larger mandibles. So, with mathematical support and a lack of support for strong fitness benefits as a result of sexually concordant selection, the paper concludes that sex-specific selection is more likely to incur costs than benefits to sexually reproducing species.

=== Effects on animal behavior  ===
Animal behavior (see [[ethology]]) encompasses so many disciplines that it is impossible not to see it in some capacity in almost all primary literature involving live animals. While the examples above certainly contain aspects of animal behavior, a more overt example of it in relation to sex-limited traits is detailed in a Teplitsky et al. paper (2010) centering on breeding time in red-billed gulls.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Teplitsky|first=C|author2=JA Mills |author3=JW Yarrall |author4=J Merila |title=Indirect genetic effects in a sex-limited trait: the case of breeding time in red-billed gulls|journal=Journal of Evolutionary Biology|year=2010|volume=23|issue=5|pages=935–944|doi=10.1111/j.1420-9101.2010.01959.x|pmid=20345824}}&lt;/ref&gt; This experiment deals with breeding time, an aspect of reproductive biology. Reproduction and sexual behavior are two key aspects of animal behavior, as they are universally expressed in some way throughout the animal kingdom.

Breeding time in red-billed gulls  is expressed only in females, because only females lay eggs. Male care, however, affects female breeding performance substantially. This qualifies breeding time as a sex-limited trait because it is expressed only in one sex but can be affected by both (similarly to Hosken's beetle experiment above). By following a natural population of red-billed gulls for 46 years, Teplitsky et al. came to an unexpected conclusion - while laying date (aka breeding time) is only expressed in females, the trait is only heritable in males. This is atypical because sex-limited traits are almost always heritable within the sex in which they are expressed.

For this species, the timing of egg-laying has much to do with male behavior. Males can affect female reproductive success so strongly because for the 20 days up to egg-laying, females spend up to 80% of their time in the nest. This leaves males with the responsibility of providing food regularly and securing (and maintaining) a high-quality territory for nesting. This phenomenon of the genetics of one individual affecting those of another individual is known as ''indirect genetic effects''. For this population, at least, possible explanations for this atypical heritability pattern exist. While controlling female health and safety, males are responsible for the timing of the start of courtship feeding, as well. These populations also typically have excesses of females, allowing males to exert even further choice in the form of mate choice. These factors in combination give males a great opportunity to express their "laying date genotype". In spite of the presence of directional selection and significant male heritability for breeding time, no advancement of breeding time was seen during the 46 years of this experiment. This does not discount the significance of the paper's other results however - one of the most significant being that here a "female trait (laying date) is largely determined by genetic characteristics of its mate".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Epigenetics==
[[Epigenetics]] is the inheritance of additional marks to the genome without changes in its sequence. These factors epigenetic factors may also be sex-limited. [[Genomic imprinting]] for example, silencing of one parental allele by [[DNA methylation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reik|first1=Wolf|last2=Walter|first2=Jörn|title=Genomic imprinting: parental influence on the genome|journal=Nature Reviews Genetics|date=1 January 2001|volume=2|issue=1|pages=21–32|doi=10.1038/35047554|pmid=11253064}}&lt;/ref&gt; for which sex-limited imprinting has been proposed to resolve [[Intralocus sexual conflict|intralocus conflict]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Day|first1=T.|last2=Bonduriansky|first2=R.|title=Intralocus Sexual Conflict Can Drive the Evolution of Genomic Imprinting|journal=Genetics|date=1 August 2004|volume=167|issue=4|pages=1537–1546|doi=10.1534/genetics.103.026211|pmid=15342496|pmc=1470977}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genomic imprinting has been shown to be indistinguishable from non-imprinted systems at the [[Population genetics|population]] level in some cases, having equivalent evolutionary models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pearce|first1=Gavin P.|last2=Spencer|first2=Hamish G.|title=Population genetic models of genomic imprinting.|journal=Genetics|date=April 1992|volume=130|issue=4|pages=899–907|pmid=1582564|pmc=1204938}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this does not hold for sex-limited models of sex-limited imprinting which behave differently depending on which sex imprinting occurs and the parental sex of imprinted allele.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kelly|first1=S. Thomas|last2=Spencer|first2=Hamish G.|title=Population-genetic models of sex-limited genomic imprinting|journal=Theoretical Population Biology|volume=115|date=April 2017|pages=35-44|doi=10.1016/j.tpb.2017.03.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, this affects whether alleles are imprinted in consecutive generations with different evolutionary trajectories (under the same selection fitnesses) arising purely due to sex-limited epigenetics. Thus sex-limited epigenetic traits may have played a pivotal role in the evolution of mammals and other species, particularly as a mechanism to ameliorate intralocus conflict between the sexes.

==Conclusions==
Overall, sex-limited genes carry with them several complex cost to benefit ratios which call for further analysis. For example, while they allow for greater opportunities of sexual dimorphism so both sexes can reach much closer to their optimal phenotypes, they also incur fitness costs on sexually reproducing species. Since Charles Darwin's revolutionary book was published in 1871, there have been many studies done on the nature of these genes. The scientific literature dealing with the concepts of sexual dimorphism and sex-limited genes extends far past what has been listed here. The genetic and mechanistic details of these genes are still being discovered through ongoing research today. It is becoming apparent that a deeper understanding sex-limited genes will be increasingly important as the fields of evolutionary biology and genetics advance.

Within [[Higher education|higher-education]], '''Summer Undergraduate Research Fellowships (SURF)''' are a common summer immersion experience which supplement research activities that occur during the academic year. Typically, these highly competitive [[undergraduate]] programs are overseen by a member of a [[Faculty (university)|college's faculty]], who provide general guidance to the undergraduate's research work.  Areas of research vary widely, and can come from any art or science discipline.

Often, SURF participants are given a [[stipend]] to cover living expenses for the duration of the project.  SURF projects are also, more often than not, used for college credit, though this will vary according to the institution.

Many colleges give students the option to carry out a one or two semester senior research project, also under the SURF banner. Majors in a department follow a core of course requirements intended to gradually introduce students to the research process. By following this core, undergraduates reach their senior year adequately prepared for meaningful, independent research. A distinctive element of many SURF experiences is that the project results in a written thesis defended before a faculty panel in the presence of the department and students.

Since the eighteenth century, the [[United Kingdom]] has been one of the world's greatest [[tea]] consumers, with an average annual ''per capita'' tea supply of 1.9&amp;nbsp;kg (4.18 lbs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Food Balance Sheets|url=http://faostat3.fao.org/home/index.html#DOWNLOAD|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[British Empire]] was instrumental in spreading tea from China to India; British interests controlled tea production in the subcontinent. Tea, which was an upper-class drink in [[continental Europe]], became the infusion of every social class in [[Great Britain]] throughout the course of the eighteenth century and has remained so. Tea is a prominent feature of [[British culture]] and society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A very British beverage: Why us Brits just love a cuppa|url=http://www.express.co.uk/life-style/food/529175/Why-Brits-love-a-cup-of-tea|agency=Express|date=23 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In both the United Kingdom and the [[Republic of Ireland]], the drinking of tea is so varied that it is quite hard to generalise. While it is usually served with milk, it is not uncommon to drink it black or with lemon, with sugar being a popular addition to any of the above. Strong tea, served in a [[mug]] with milk and sugar, is a popular combination known as [[builder's tea]].

The rise in popularity of tea between the seventeenth and nineteenth centuries had major social, political, and economic implications for [[Great Britain]]. It defined respectability and domestic rituals, supported the rise and dominance of the [[British Empire]], and contributed to the rise of the [[Industrial Revolution]] by supplying both the capital for factories and calories for labourers.&lt;ref name="Mintz-CR-266" /&gt; It also demonstrates the power of globalization and imperialism to transform a country and shape it into the modern society it is known as today. Tea remains a popular drink in Britain in the modern day and is still considered to be an important part of British identity.

=== Historiography ===
Historians debate the causes of tea’s popularity and many attribute it to one or two factors, but a range of different factors are apparent at different times. Ukers argues in ''All About Tea: Volume I'' that the rise in popularity of tea in [[Great Britain]] was largely due to tea’s reputation among men as a medicinal drink that could cure a wide array of ailments, along with its burgeoning presence in the coffeehouses where elite men congregated.&lt;ref name="Ukers-23-46"&gt;{{harvnb|Ukers|1935|pp=23–46}}&lt;/ref&gt; As for tea’s popularity among women, he briefly acknowledges that Princess [[Catherine of Braganza]], the Portuguese future [[queen consort of England]], made tea fashionable among aristocratic women, but largely attributes its popularity to its ubiquity in the medical discourse of seventeenth century. Ellis, Coulton, and Mauger trace tea’s popularity back to three distinct groups in ''Empire of Tea: The Asian Leaf that Conquered the World''. These groups were virtuosi, merchants, and elite female aristocrats.&lt;ref name="ECM-31-76"&gt;{{harvnb|Ellis|Coulton|Mauger|2015|pp=31–76}}&lt;/ref&gt; They argue that the influence of these three groups combined launched tea as a popular beverage in Great Britain. 

Smith, in his article "Complications of the Commonplace: Tea, Sugar, and Imperialism" differs from Ukers and Ellis, Coulton, and Mauger in that he argues that tea only became popular once sugar was added to the drink and tea with sugar became associated with a domestic ritual that indicated respectability.&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;Woodruff D. Smith, "Complications of the Commonplace: Tea, Sugar, and Imperialism". ''Journal of Interdisciplinary History'' (Autumn 1992), 259-277.&lt;/ref&gt; Mintz, in both “The Changing Roles of Food in the Story of Consumption” and ''Sweetness and Power'', agrees and disagrees with Smith. Mintz acknowledges that sugar played a monumental role in the rise of tea, but contradicts Smith’s connection of tea to respectability.&lt;ref name="Mintz-CR-261-270"&gt;{{harvnb|Mintz|1993|pp=261–270}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Smith argues that tea first became popular in the home, Mintz believes tea first became popular in the workplace, as people drank tea during the workday for its warm sweetness and stimulating properties.&lt;ref name="Mintz-SP-110-117"&gt;{{harvnb|Mintz|1985|pp=110–117}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later that it entered the home and became an “integral part of the social fabric.”&lt;ref name="Mintz-CR-266"&gt;{{harvnb|Mintz|1993|p=266}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Seventeenth century: a medicinal and luxury import ===
==== Early mentions ====
[[File:Iohn Huighen van Linschoten, his Discours of Voyages into ye Easte &amp; West Indies title page.jpg|thumb|[[Iohn Huighen van Linschoten]], ''Discours of Voyages into ye Easte &amp; West Indies'', title page]]
The history of European interactions with tea dates back to the mid-sixteenth century. The earliest mention of tea in European literature was by [[Giambattista Ramusio]], a Venetian explorer, as Chai Catai or “Tea of China” in 1559.&lt;ref&gt;Giambattista Ramusio, ''Navigatione et Viaggi'', Vol. II, Venice, 1559, in {{harvnb|Ukers|1935|pp=23–24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tea was mentioned several more times in various European countries afterwards, but Jan Hugo van Linschooten, a Dutch navigator, was the first to write a printed reference of tea in 1598 in his ''Discours of Voyages''.&lt;ref&gt;Jan Hugo Van Linschooten, ''Discours of Voyages'', London, 1598, in {{harvnb|Ukers|1935|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it was several years later, in 1615, that the earliest known reference to tea by an Englishman took place in a letter exchanged between Mr. R. Wickham, an agent for the [[British East India Company]] stationed at [[Japan]] to a Mr. Eaton, who was stationed in [[Macao|Macao [portuguese domain since 1557]]], China.&lt;ref name="Ukers-37"&gt;{{harvnb|Ukers|1935|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this letter, Wickham asked Eaton to send him “a pot of the best sort of chaw,”&lt;ref name="Ukers-37" /&gt; phonetically how one would write ''chàh'', the local ([[Cantonese]]) dialect word for tea. Another early reference to tea appears in the writings of trader [[Samuel Purchas]] in 1625.&lt;ref name="Purchas"&gt;Samuel Purchas, ''Purchas His Pilgrimes'', Vol. III, London, 1625, in {{harvnb|Ukers|1935|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; Purchas describes how the Chinese consume tea as “the powder of a certaine herbe called chia of which they put as much as a walnut shell may contain, into a dish of Porcelane, and drink it with hot water.”&lt;ref name="Purchas" /&gt; In 1637, [[Peter Mundy]], a traveller and merchant who came across tea in [[Fujian]], China, wrote, "''chaa'' – only water with a kind of herb boyled in it".&lt;ref name="chrystal"&gt;{{cite book|url={{google books|id=lXYFBQAAQBAJ|pg=PT25|plainurl=yes}}|title=Tea: A Very British Beverage|last=Chrystal|first=Paul|date=October 17, 2014|publisher=Amberley Publishing Limited}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Sale of tea begins ====
[[File:Exchange Alley - London.jpg|thumb|1746 map showing Exchange Alley, where tea was first sold in England]]
Though there were a number of early mentions, it was several more years before tea was actually sold in England. [[Green tea]] exported from China was first introduced in [[English coffeehouses in the 17th and 18th centuries|the coffeehouses of London]] shortly before the [[Stuart Restoration]] (1660).

Thomas Garway (or Garraway), a tobacconist and coffee house owner, was the first person in England to sell tea as a leaf and beverage at his London [[coffeehouse]] in Exchange Alley in 1657.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ukers|1935|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url={{google books|id=_TR_PQAACAAJ|page=169|plainurl=yes}}|title=The True History of Tea|last1=Mair|first1=Victor H.|last2=Hoh|first2=Erling|publisher=[[Thames &amp; Hudson]]|year=2009|isbn=978-0-500-25146-1|page=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had to explain the new beverage in a pamphlet. Immediately after Garway began selling it, the Sultaness Head Coffee House began selling tea as a beverage and posted the first newspaper advertisement for tea in ''[[Mercurius Politicus]]'' on 30 September 1658.&lt;ref name="Ukers-41"&gt;{{harvnb|Ukers|1935|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; The announcement proclaimed "That Excellent, and by all Physicians approved, ''China'' drink, called by the ''Chinese'', ''Tcha'', by other nations ''Tay alias Tee'', ...sold at the Sultaness-head, ye ''Cophee-house'' in Sweetings-Rents, by the [[Royal Exchange, London|Royal Exchange]], ''London''".&lt;!--already carefully vetted for misprints: don't "edit"--&gt; &lt;ref name="AutoC0-1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ukers-41" /&gt;

In London "Coffee, chocolate and a kind of drink called ''tee''"&lt;!--tee and italics in original--&gt; were "sold in almost every street in 1659", according to Thomas Rugge's ''Diurnall''.&lt;ref name="AutoC0-2" /&gt; Tea was mainly consumed by upper and mercantile classes: [[Samuel Pepys]], curious for every novelty, tasted the new drink on 25 September 1660 and recorded the experience in his diary: "I did send for a cup of tee, (a China drink) of which I had never had drunk before". 

The British East India company made its first order for the importation of tea in 1667 to their agent in [[Banten|Bantam]], and two canisters of tea weighing 143&amp;nbsp;lbs 8 oz arrived from Bantam in 1669.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VLkTAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA47#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Commercial Statistics. a Digest of the Productive Resources, Commercial Legislation, Customs Tariffs, Navigation, Port, and Quarantine Laws, and Charges, Shipping, Imports and Exports, and the Monies, Weights, and Measures of All Nations|author=M P John MacGregor|isbn=9781130006230|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1672, a servant of [[Edward Herbert, 3rd Baron Herbert of Chirbury|Baron Herbert]] in London sent his instructions for tea making, and warming the delicate cups, to Shropshire:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The directions for the tea are: a quart of spring water just boiled, to which put a spoonful of tea, and sweeten to the palate with candy sugar. As soon as the tea and sugar are in, the steam must be kept in as much as may be, and let it lie half or quarter of an hour in the heat of the fire but not boil. The little cups must be held over the steam before the liquid be put in.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, W. J., ed., ''Herbert Correspondence'', University of Wales (1963), pp. 204-5 no. 353, John Read to Richard Herbert of Oakly Park, [[Ludlow]], 29 June 1672.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The earliest English [[equipage]]s for making tea date to the 1660s. Small porcelain [[Chawan|tea bowls]] were used by the fashionable; they were occasionally shipped with the tea itself. Tea-drinking spurred the search for a European imitation of Chinese porcelain, first successfully produced in England at the [[Chelsea porcelain manufactory]], established around 1743-45 and quickly imitated. See [[tea set]].

==== A medicinal drink ====
[[File:Philippe Sylvestre Dufour Chocolat 17th century.jpg|thumb|[[Philippe Sylvestre Dufour]], 'A treatise on the novelties and curiosities of coffee, tea and chocolate', c. 1671]]

The first factor that contributed to the rise in popularity of tea was its reputation as a medical drink. Tea first became labeled as a medical drink in 1641 by the Dutch physician Nikolas Dirx, who wrote under the pseudonym "[[Nicolas Tulp]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ukers|1935|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– though he was also a director of the [[Dutch East India Company]], so his praise of tea was likely a marketing tactic.&lt;ref name="Smith, 268"&gt;Smith, 268.&lt;/ref&gt; In his book ''Observationes Medicae'', he claimed that "nothing is comparable to this plant" and that those who use it are "exempt from all maladies and reach an extreme old age."&lt;ref name="Tulp"&gt;Nicolas Tulp, ''Obersaciones Medicae'', Amsterdam, 1641, in {{harvnb|Ukers|1935|pp=31–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; He goes into detail on the specific merits of tea, such as curing “headaches, colds, ophthalmia, catarrh, asthma, sluggishness of the stomach, and intestinal troubles.”&lt;ref name="Tulp" /&gt; Thomas Garway, the first English shopkeeper to sell tea, published a broadsheet in 1660 titled "An Exact Description of the Growth, Quality, and Vertues of the Leaf TEA" which also praised tea's medical benefits. Garway claims that “the Drink is declared to be most wholesome, preserving in perfect health until extreme Old Age", as well as "maketh the body active and lusty", "helpeth the Headache", "taketh away the difficulty of breathing", "strengtheneth the Memory", and "expelleth infection".&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Garway, “An Exact Description of the Growth, Quality, and Vertues of the Leaf TEA,” c. 1660, preserved in the British Museum, in {{harvnb|Ukers|1935|pp=38–39}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

There were many more published works on the health benefits of tea, including those by [[Hartlib]] in 1657, [[Bontekoe]] in 1678, [[Povey]] in 1686, and [[Thomas Tryon|Tryon]] in the 1690s,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ellis|Coulton|Mauger|2015|pp=32, 34}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Povey, Esq., “A Famous Tea Manuscript of 1686,” Oct. 20, 1686, in {{harvnb|Ukers|1935|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith, 296.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Royal College of Physicians]] debated whether any of the exotic new hot drinks would "agree with the Constitutions of our ''English'' bodies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shapin|first=Steven|date=July 30, 2015|title=Pretence for Prattle|url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v37/n15/steven-shapin/pretence-for-prattle|journal=[[The London Review of Books]]|volume=37|issue=15|pages=17–18|access-date=July 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1667, Pepys noted that his wife was taking tea on medical advice – "a drink which Mr Pelling the [[apothecary|Pottecary]] tells her is good for her colds and defluxions". [[John Locke]], the famous English philosopher, developed a fondness for tea after spending time with Dutch medical men in the 1680s.&lt;ref name="ECM-43"&gt;{{harvnb|Ellis|Coulton|Mauger|2015|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ellis, Coulton, and Mauger refer to these men as “virtuosi”: scientists, philosophers, and doctors who first took an interest in tea and contributed to its early popularity as a pharmaceutical.&lt;ref name="ECM-31"&gt;{{harvnb|Ellis|Coulton|Mauger|2015|p=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; But, such as with the case of Tulp, some of these men may have been influenced by Indies companies and merchants who wished to create a market for tea. Nevertheless, there is little doubt that these writings about the so-called health benefits of tea contributed to rise in popularity of tea in England.

==== Popularity among aristocrats ====
[[File:Lady drinking tea - Lavreince.jpg|thumb|Lady drinking tea by [[Niclas Lafrensen]]]]
According to Ellis, Coulton, Maugher, “tea was six to ten times more expensive than coffee” in the 1660s, making it an extremely expensive and luxurious commodity.&lt;ref name="ECM-36"&gt;{{harvnb|Ellis|Coulton|Mauger|2015|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the proliferation of works on the health benefits of tea came at a time when people in the upper classes of English society began to take an interest in their health.

In 1660, two pounds and two ounces of tea bought from Portugal were formally presented to [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] by the [[British East India Company]].&lt;ref name="AutoC0-3" /&gt; The drink, already common in Europe, was a favourite of his new Portuguese bride, [[Catherine of Braganza]], who introduced it at court after she married Charles II in 1662, and made it fashionable among the ladies of the court as her temperance drink of choice.&lt;ref name="Smith, 268" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mintz|1993|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; Catherine of Braganza's use of tea as a court beverage, rather than a medicinal drink, influenced its popularity in literary circles around 1685.&lt;ref name="kendra" /&gt; Whenever it was consumed in the court, it was “conspicuously on display” so as to show it off.&lt;ref name="ECM-31" /&gt;

Accordingly, tea drinking became a central aspect of aristocratic society in England by the 1680s, particularly among women who drank it while gossiping in the home.&lt;ref name="ECM-39"&gt;{{harvnb|Ellis|Coulton|Mauger|2015|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; Catherine of Braganza’s introduction of tea to ladies was significant because it made tea an acceptable drink for both sexes, when it easily could have been categorized as a men’s drink if it had remained only available in the coffeehouses that only men frequented. Wealthy ladies’ desire to show off their luxurious commodities in front of other ladies also increased demand for tea and made it more popular. Another factor that made tea desirable among the elite crowd was the addition of sugar, another luxurious commodity which was already well-established among the upper classes.

=== Eighteenth century: a marker of middle-class upward mobility and patriotism ===

==== Colonial trade ====
[[File:William Daniell - A View in China- Cultivating the Tea Plant - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|[[William Daniell]], 'A View in China--Cultivating the Tea Plant', c. 1810]]

While tea slowly became more common in coffeehouses during the second half of the seventeenth century, the first tea shop in London did not open until the early eighteenth century. [[Twinings|Thomas Twining]]'s tea shop has been claimed as the first, opening in 1706, and still remained at 216 [[Strand, London]]. However, 1717 is also given as a date for the first tea shop.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ukers|1935|p=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; In between tea’s earliest mentions in England and its widespread popularity little over a century later, many factors contributed the craze for this previously unknown foreign commodity.

Tea would not have become the English staple it is known as if not for the increase in its supply that made it more accessible. Between 1720 and 1750 the imports of tea to Britain through the British East India Company more than quadrupled.&lt;ref name="AutoC0-5" /&gt; By 1766, exports from Canton stood at six million pounds on British boats, compared with 4.5 on Dutch ships, 2.4 on Swedish, 2.1 on French.&lt;ref name="AutoC0-7" /&gt; Veritable "tea fleets" grew up. Tea was particularly interesting to the [[Atlantic world]] not only because it was easy to cultivate but also because of how easy it was to prepare and its ability to revive the spirits and, reputedly, cure mild colds.&lt;ref name="AutoC0-10" /&gt;

When tea was first introduced to England, the [[British East India Company]] was not directly trading with [[China]] and merchants relied on tea imports from [[Holland]].&lt;ref name="ECM-37"&gt;{{harvnb|Ellis|Coulton|Mauger|2015|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because this tea was so expensive and difficult to get, there was very little demand for it, except among the elite who could afford it and made special orders. It was not until after 1700 that the British East India Company began to trade regularly with China and ordering tea, though not in large quantities.&lt;ref name="Smith, 273"&gt;Smith, 273.&lt;/ref&gt; Smith argues that the tea trade was actually a side effect of the silk and textile trade because these were the Chinese commodities that were most desired at the time.&lt;ref name="Smith, 273" /&gt; In 1720, however, [[Parliament]] banned the importation of finished Asian textiles and traders began to focus on tea instead.&lt;ref name="Smith, 273" /&gt; This new focus marked a turning point for the English tea trade and is arguably why tea became more popular than coffee. Once the British East India company focused on tea as its main import, tea soon attained price stability. Conversely, the price of coffee remained unpredictable and high, allowing tea to grow in popularity before coffee became more accessible.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, 274.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the rising demand for tea and sugar was easily met with increased supply as the tea industry grew in India, which prevented sharp price increases that would have discouraged people from buying it.&lt;ref name="Smith, 275"&gt;Smith, 275.&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the price of tea actually fell as it was becoming more popular among the upper-middle and middle classes. The significant drop in tea’s price between 1720 and 1750 was a major turning point for tea in England. The increase in supply of tea was one of the most important factors that boosted its popularity in Britain and opened up the world of tea to new levels of society.

==== Introduction of milk and sugar ====
[[File:LangleyPrincessTeaset.jpg|thumb|A modern British tea set, in which sugar bowl and milk jug accompany the teapot]]

Though by the beginning of the eighteenth century tea was already gaining popularity on its own, the addition of sugar helped tea’s popularity to soar. The English began adding sugar to their tea between 1685 and the early eighteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, 263.&lt;/ref&gt; At this time, sugar was already being used to enhance the flavor of other foods among the elite and had a reputation as an ostentatious luxury.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, 266.&lt;/ref&gt; Because both tea and sugar had status implications it made sense to drink them together,&lt;ref&gt;Smith, 270.&lt;/ref&gt; and the growth in the import of tea parallels that of sugar in the eighteenth century,&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite episode|title=Tea|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p004y24y|series=[[In Our Time (BBC Radio 4)|In Our Time]]|network=[[BBC Radio 4]]|airdate=29 April 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; which itself was booming due to the growth of sugar plantations in the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, 271.&lt;/ref&gt; But, as previously mentioned, the elite classes of England were starting to care more about their health and literature on the unhealthiness of sugar was beginning to circulate in the late seventeenth century.&lt;ref name="Smith, 277"&gt;Smith, 277.&lt;/ref&gt; Adding sugar to tea, however, was seen as an acceptable way to consume sugar because it suggested that “one had the self-control to consume sugar in a healthy way.”&lt;ref name="Smith, 277" /&gt; Sugar also masks tea’s bitterness, so it simply made tea more desirable because it tasted better.  As the supply of both tea and sugar grew during the early eighteenth century, the combination of the two commodities became more universal and increased the popularity and demand for both products. [[Black tea]] overtook [[green tea]] in popularity in the 1720s when sugar and milk were added to tea, a practice that was not done in China.

==== Popularity among the middle classes ====

[[File:Johann Zoffany - 'The Garden at Hampton House, with Mr and Mrs David Garrick taking tea'.jpg|thumb|[[Johann Zoffany]], 'The Garden at Hampton House, with Mr and Mrs [[David Garrick]] taking tea']]

Because tea began in Britain as a luxury for the super-rich, it had a reputation in the eighteenth century as a high-class commodity. But as prices slowly fell, more people at the middle levels of society had access to it. Accordingly, drinking tea became associated with respectability among upwardly mobile middle-class people.&lt;ref name="Smith, 276"&gt;Smith, 276.&lt;/ref&gt; When people drank tea, they were expected to possess certain manners and behave in a particular way.&lt;ref name="Smith, 276" /&gt; Soon, drinking tea became a domestic ritual among families, colleagues, and friends who were just wealthy enough to afford it, which also increased demand.&lt;ref name="Smith, 275" /&gt; The association between tea and respectability became so ingrained in both British and Irish culture that it reached a point where it could not go out of fashion.&lt;ref name="Smith, 277" /&gt; Tea-drinking among these groups was also soon considered patriotic. 

Because the British East India Company had a monopoly over the tea industry in England, tea became more popular than coffee, chocolate, and alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mintz|1985|p=113}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tea was seen as inherently British and tea-drinking was encouraged by the British government because of the revenue gained from taxing tea.&lt;ref name="Mintz-SP-114"&gt;{{harvnb|Mintz|1985|p=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike coffee and chocolate, which came from the colonies of Britain’s rivals in various regions of the world, tea was produced in a single massive colony and served as a means of not only profit, but colonial power.&lt;ref name="Mintz-SP-114" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith, 277" /&gt; Mintz goes so far as to argue that the combination of ritualization and increased production in the British colonies was how tea became inherently British.&lt;ref name="Mintz-SP-110"&gt;{{harvnb|Mintz|1985|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

As the British continued to import more and more tea throughout the eighteenth century, tea slowly went from a respectable commodity consumed by the well-mannered classes in domestic rituals to an absolute necessity in the British diet, even among the poor working classes. John Hanway, an eighteenth-century social reformer, observed the widespread consumption of tea by the poor in 1767. He described "a certain lane&amp;nbsp;... where beggars are often seen&amp;nbsp;... drinking their tea", as well as "laborers mending their roads drinking their tea" and tea "in the cups of haymakers".&lt;ref&gt;Jonas Hanway, 1767, in Mintz, 117.&lt;!--which Mintz is this?--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Just two centuries after the first appearance of tea in English society as a beverage for aristocrats, tea had become so widely popular and available that those at the absolute bottom of the social hierarchy were consuming it as their beverage of choice. It was at this point that tea became universal among all levels of society. [[Fernand Braudel]] asked, "is it true to say the new drink replaced [[gin]] in England?"&lt;ref name="AutoC0-6" /&gt;

=== Nineteenth century: universal consumption ===

==== Adoption by the working classes ====
[[File:THE WOMEN'S WORK IN THE WAR PRODUCTION, 1914-1918 Q107140.jpg|thumb|Workers taking a tea break during the [[First World War]]]]

By the nineteenth century, tea’s popularity had reached the working class and it was soon considered an everyday necessity among poor labourers. According to the Scottish historian [[David MacPherson (historian)|David MacPherson]], tea had become cheaper than beer in the early nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;David MacPherson, The History of European Commerce with India (London: Longman, Hurst, Rees, Orme, &amp; Brown, 1812), 132, in {{harvnb|Mintz|1993|p=264}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, sugar had also become extremely cheap by this time and the two were almost always consumed together.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mintz|1993|p=264}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the price of coffee had also gone down by this point, tea was the preferred drink because, unlike coffee, it still tasted good when diluted, which is often how the poor consumed it in order to save money.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mintz|1985|p=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Tea had other attractions as well. Drinking a hot, sweet beverage transformed their meals, which generally consisted of dry bread and cheese, and made them go down more easily.&lt;ref name="Mintz-CR-266" /&gt; The warm beverage was especially appealing given Britain’s cold and wet climate.&lt;ref name="Mintz-CR-266" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mintz-SP-110" /&gt; Further, tea helped alleviate some of the consequences of the [[urbanization]] that accompanied the industrial revolution: drinking tea required boiling the water, thereby killing water-borne [[disease]]s like [[dysentery]], [[cholera]], and [[typhoid]].&lt;ref name="AutoC0-11" /&gt;

However, the poor consumed tea very differently to the well-mannered ritual adopted by the upper classes. According to Mintz, “tea-drinking among the poor probably began in connection with work, not in the home”,&lt;ref name="Mintz-CR-265"&gt;{{harvnb|Mintz|1993|p=265}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some scholars suggest that tea played a role in the British [[Industrial Revolution]].&lt;ref name="AutoC0-11" /&gt; Day labourers brewed their tea out in the open and brought their tea equipment with them to work, as opposed to the private domestic ritual that had previously surrounded tea-drinking.&lt;ref name="Mintz-CR-266" /&gt; Afternoon tea possibly became a way to increase the number of hours labourers could work; the stimulants in the tea, accompanied by the calorie boost from the sugar and accompanying snacks, would give workers energy to finish the day's work.&lt;ref name="Mintz-SP-110" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AutoC0-11" /&gt;

==== Cultivation in India ====
[[File:The tea clipper Thermopylae RMG BHC3658.tiff|thumb|The tea clipper ''Thermopylae'', launched in 1868]]

The popularity of tea occasioned the furtive export of slips, a small shoot for planting or twig for grafting to tea plants, from China to [[British India]] and its [[History of tea in India|commercial cultivation there]], beginning in 1840.

Between 1872 and 1884 the supply of tea to the British Empire increased with the expansion of the railway to the east. The demand, however, was not proportional, which caused the prices to rise. Nevertheless, from 1884 onward, due to innovation in tea preparation, the price of tea dropped and remained relatively low throughout the first half of the twentieth century.

Soon afterwards London became the centre of the international tea trade.&lt;ref name="AutoC0-9" /&gt; With high tea imports also came a large increase in the demand for porcelain. The demand for tea cups, pots and dishes increased to go along with this popular new drink.&lt;ref name="AutoC0-10" /&gt;

==== Gender ====
[[Roger Fulford]] argues that tea rooms benefited [[women in the Victorian era]], in that these neutral public spaces were instrumental in the "spread of independence" for women and their [[women's suffrage|struggle for the vote]].&lt;ref&gt;''Votes for Women'' 1957, quoted in ''Tea: A Very British Beverage'' by Paul Chrystal 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Chrystal characterizes tea rooms as "popular and fashionable, especially with women", providing them a dignified and safe place to meet and eat&amp;nbsp;– and strategize on political campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Tea: A Very British Beverage|last1=Chrystal|first1=Paul|date=2014|accessdate=10 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tea today ===
[[File:The Willow Tearooms5.jpg|thumb|The Willow Tearooms, Glasgow]]

In 2003, ''[[DataMonitor]]'' reported that regular tea drinking in the United Kingdom was on the decline.&lt;ref name="waning" /&gt; There was a 10.25 per cent decline in the purchase of normal teabags in Britain between 1997 and 2002.&lt;ref name="waning" /&gt; Sales of ground coffee also fell during the same period.&lt;ref name="waning" /&gt; Britons were instead drinking health-oriented beverages like fruit or [[herbal tea]]s, consumption of which increased 50 per cent from 1997 to 2002. A further, unexpected, statistic is that the sales of [[decaffination|decaffeinated]] tea and coffee fell even faster during this period than the sale of the more common varieties.&lt;ref name="waning" /&gt; Declining tea sales were matched by an increase in espresso sales.&lt;ref name="sales" /&gt; Nevertheless, tea still remains an extremely popular drink and is still engrained in British culture and society.

In 1787, Twinings Tea created its logo, still in use today, which is thought to be the world's oldest commercial logo that has been in continuous use since its inception.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of the World in Six Glasses|last=Standage|first=T.|date=2005|publisher=Walker|location=New York|page=202|authorlink=Tom Standage}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under [[Associated British Foods]] since 1964, Stephen Twining now represents the company's tenth generation. In 2006, Twinings celebrated its 300th anniversary with a special tea and associated tea caddies. Twining's is a [[Royal Warrant of Appointment (United Kingdom)|Royal Warrant]] holder (appointed by HM The Queen).

==Brewing the tea==
Even very slightly formal events can be a cause for cups and saucers to be used instead of mugs. A typical semi-formal British tea ritual might run as follows (the host performing all actions unless noted):&lt;ref name="Infographic: All About British Tea"/&gt;

# The [[kettle]] is brought to a rolling boil (with fresh water to ensure good oxygenation which is essential for proper diffusion of the tea leaves).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.twinings.com/int/l2c_perfect_cup.php | title = The perfect cup | publisher = [[Twinings]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Enough [[boiling]] water is swirled around the [[teapot]] to warm it and then poured out.
# Add loose tea leaves (usually black tea) or [[tea bag]]s, always added before the boiled water.
# Fresh boiling water is poured over the tea in the pot and allowed to brew for 2 to 5 minutes while a [[tea cosy]] may be placed on the pot to keep the tea warm.&lt;ref name=Alleyne&gt;{{cite news|last=Alleyne|first=Richard|title=How to make the perfect cup of tea – be patient|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/science-news/8577637/How-to-make-the-perfect-cup-of-tea-be-patient.html|accessdate=28 May 2014|newspaper=Daily Telegraph|date=15 Jun 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# A [[tea strainer]] is placed over the top of the cup and the tea poured in, unless tea bags are used. Tea bags may be removed, if desired, once desired strength is attained.
# White sugar and milk (in that order) may be added, usually by the guest. 
# The pot will normally hold enough tea so as not to be empty after filling the cups of all the guests. If this is the case, the tea cosy is replaced after everyone has been served. Hot water may be provided in a separate pot, and is used only for topping up the pot, never the cup.

===The question of milk===
[[File:Milk clouds in tea.jpeg|thumb|Tea with milk that has not yet been stirred]]

{{Quote box|width=29%|align=right|quote="By putting the tea in first and stirring as one pours, one can exactly regulate the amount of milk, whereas one is likely to put in too much milk if one does it the other way round" |source=—One of [[George Orwell|Orwell]]'s eleven rules for making tea from his essay "[[A Nice Cup of Tea]]", appearing in the ''[[London Evening Standard]]'', 12 January 1946.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url =
 https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/jun/25/science.highereducation |title = How to make a perfect cuppa: put milk in first|newspaper= The Guardian | accessdate=30 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Whether to put milk into the cup before or after the tea has been a matter of debate since at least the mid-twentieth century; in his 1946 essay "[[A Nice Cup of Tea]]", author [[George Orwell]] wrote, "tea is one of the mainstays of civilisation in this country and causes violent disputes over how it should be made".&lt;ref name="George Orwell 1998 p. 34"&gt;George Orwell, Ian Angus, Sheila Davison (1998). "The Complete Works of George Orwell: Smothered under journalism, 1946". p. 34. Secker &amp; Warburg&lt;/ref&gt; Whether to put tea in the cup first and add the milk after, or the other way around, has split public opinion, with Orwell stating, "indeed in every family in Britain there are probably two schools of thought on the subject".&lt;ref name="George Orwell 1998 p. 34"/&gt;

Another aspect of the debate are claims that adding milk at the different times alters the flavour of the tea (for instance, see [[ISO 3103]] and the Royal Society of Chemistry's "How to make a Perfect Cup of Tea".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140811033029/http://www.rsc.org/pdf/pressoffice/2003/tea.pdf | archivedate = 2014-08-11 | url = http://www.rsc.org/pdf/pressoffice/2003/tea.pdf | title = How to make a Perfect Cup of Tea | publisher = Royal Society of Chemistry | date = 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;) Some studies suggest that the heating of milk above 75 degrees Celsius (adding milk after the tea is poured, not before) does cause denaturation of the [[lactalbumin]] and [[lactoglobulin]].&lt;ref name="Heat Denaturation" /&gt; Other studies argue brewing time has a greater importance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Kyle |first1=J. A. |first2= P. C. |last2= Morrice|first3=G. |last3= McNeill|first4=G. G. |last4= Duthie|date= 2007|title=Effects of Infusion Time and Addition of Milk on Content and Absorption of Polyphenols from Black Tea|journal= [[Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry]]|volume= 55|issue= 12|pages= 4889–4894 |doi=10.1021/jf070351y}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Regardless, when milk is added to tea, it may affect the flavour. In addition to considerations of flavour, the order of these steps is thought to have been, historically, an indication of class. Only those wealthy enough to afford good-quality [[porcelain]] would be confident of its being able to cope with being exposed to boiling water unadulterated with milk.&lt;ref name="Dubrin2010" /&gt;

A further point of discussion on when to add milk is how it affects the time taken for the liquid to reach a drinkable temperature. While adding milk first will cause an initial drop in temperature which leads to a more shallow [[Newton's law of cooling|cooling curve]]  (thus slower cooling) while also increasing volume (which would slightly increase the surface area through which the tea could lose heat), one study noted that adding milk first leads to the tea retaining heat out of all proportion with these effects. The major mechanism by which hot tea cools is not conduction or radiation but [[Evaporative cooler|evaporative loss]] which is affected by the physical properties of the milk.&lt;ref group=footnote&gt;Water molecules whose temperature is far above the average temperature of the tea escape and it is only these above average temperature molecules that have sufficient energy to escape the surface of the tea. As the tea's temperature drops the rate of evaporation, and thus rate of heat loss by evaporation, also drops and evaporative loss becomes a minor mechanism.&lt;/ref&gt; The study concluded that lipids in milk prevent water evaporating so rapidly thus retaining heat longer.&lt;ref group=footnote&gt;For this reason Chinese tea cups come with lids to retain heat as it is common practise in China to add tea leaves to a cup and brew in the cup and so the water temperature must be kept high for sufficient time. Also, insulated cups/travel mugs for hot beverages come with lids as it is anticipated that the beverage will be imbibed some while after being heated.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drinking etiquette===
[[File:Old Woman Drinking Tea.jpg|thumb|upright|Old Woman Drinking Tea ([[Antonio Mancini]])]]

There are opinions as to the proper manner in which to drink tea when using a cup and saucer.&lt;ref name="Sapsted"&gt;{{cite news|last=Sapsted|first=David|title=Tea room outlaws biscuit dunking|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1559761/Tea-room-outlaws-biscuit-dunking.html|accessdate=28 May 2014|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=8 Aug 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, during the 1770s and 1780s, it was fashionable to drink tea from saucers. Saucers were deeper than is the current fashion and so more similar to bowls like their Chinese antecedents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.americancenturies.mass.edu/classroom/curriculum_12th/unit3/lesson8/bkgdessay.html|title=Tea: A Brief History|last=Titus|first=Susan|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=25 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; If one is seated at a table, the proper manner to drink tea is to raise the teacup only, placing it back into the saucer in between sips. When standing or sitting in a chair without a table, one holds the tea saucer with the off hand and the tea cup in the dominant hand. When not in use, the tea cup is placed back in the tea saucer and held in one's lap or at waist height. In either event, the tea cup should never be held or waved in the air. Fingers should be curled inwards; despite popular belief in the United States, no finger should extend away from the handle of the cup.&lt;ref name="Infographic: All About British Tea" /&gt;

==Tearoom==
[[File:Tea room - panoramio.jpg|thumb|Tea rooms in Britain, 2010]]

Shortly before the [[Stuart Restoration|Restoration of 1660]], Chinese [[green tea]] was introduced to [[English coffeehouses in the 17th and 18th centuries|the coffeehouses of London]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1 = Mair | first1 = Victor H.| last2 = Hoh | first2 = Erling| title = The True History of Tea| year = 2009| publisher = [[Thames &amp; Hudson]]| isbn = 978-0-500-25146-1| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=_TR_PQAACAAJ |page=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; which were significant places of social interaction, distinct from pubs, taverns, and inns. The owner of the coffeehouse explained the new beverage in a pamphlet: "That Excellent, and by all Physicians approved, ''China'' drink, called by the ''Chinese'', ''Tcha'', by other nations ''Tay alias Tee'', ...sold at the Sultaness-head, ye ''Cophee-house'' in Sweetings-Rents, by the [[Royal Exchange, London|Royal Exchange]], ''London''".&lt;!--already carefully vetted for misprints: don't "edit"--&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Niall Ferguson, Empire: the rise and demise of the British world order, (2004:11).&lt;/ref&gt; "Coffee, chocolate and a kind of drink called ''tee''"&lt;!--tee and italics in original--&gt; were "sold in almost every street [in London] in 1659", according to Thomas Rugge's ''Diurnall''.&lt;ref&gt;Rugge's Diurnall is preserved in the British Library (Add. MSS. 10,116-117); it was published as The diurnal of Thomas Rugg, 1659-1661, William Lewis Sachse ed., (1961)&lt;/ref&gt; Tea was mainly consumed by upper and mercantile classes: [[Samuel Pepys]], curious for every novelty, tasted the new drink in 1660 and recorded the experience in his diary for 25 September: "I did send for a cup of tee, (a China drink) of which I had never had drunk before".&lt;ref&gt;Richard, Lord Braybrooke, ed., note in The Diary and Correspondence of Samuel Pepys, F.R.S., vol. I :109.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Hogarth|Hogarth]]'s ''[[Gin Lane]]'' was not the first warning about working class drunkenness. One response to the perception of widespread dissolution was the [[temperance movement]], which promoted tea as a healthful alternative to alcohol of any sort. From the 1830s many new cafes and [[coffeehouse]]s opened, as a place to socialise that was not a [[pub]] or an inn. Tearooms were also significant since they provided a place where [[women in the Victorian era]] could take a meal — without a male escort — without risk to their reputations. Tea rooms catered for all classes of society.

In 1864, the [[Aerated Bread Company]] opened the first of what would grow to be known as [[Aerated Bread Company#Tea shops and early women.27s issues|A.B.C. Tea Shops]]. The idea came from a London-based "manageress" at ABC "who'd been serving gratis tea and snacks to customers of all classes, [and] got permission to put a commercial public tearoom on the premises."&lt;ref&gt;Brandt, Pamela Robin. “[http://www.miaminewtimes.com/2002-10-17/restaurants/tea-for-view-view-for-tea/ Tea for View, View for Tea],” ''[[Miami New Times]]''. October 17, 2002. ''(Retrieved 2009-05-08).'' See also: “[http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/language_tips/2007-08/08/content_6018021.htm 英格兰饮茶风俗由何而来？ （二）],” [[British Council|British Council China]]. August 8, 2007. ''(Retrieved 2009-05-08).''&lt;/ref&gt; By 1923, the A.B.C. tea shops had 250 branches,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/a2a/records.aspx?cat=074-acc2910&amp;cid=0 "Aerated Bread Company (ABC)"], [[London Metropolitan Archives]]. [[The National Archives|National Archives]]. ACC/2910, 1869-1885. ''(Retrieved 2009-05-08).''&lt;/ref&gt; second only to [[J. Lyons and Co.]]. Lyons Corner Houses started in 1894, and soon became the leading chain of tea rooms; their waitresses were known as "[[Nippy|nippies]]" for the speed of their work.

In 1878 [[Catherine Cranston]] opened the first of what became a chain of ''Miss Cranston's Tea Rooms'' in [[Glasgow]], [[Scotland]], providing elegant well-designed social venues which for the first time provided for well-to-do women socialising without male company. They proved widely popular. She engaged up and coming designers, becoming a patron of [[Charles Rennie Mackintosh]]. He designed the complete building of the [[Willow Tearooms]], a strikingly modern exterior as well as a series of interesting interior designs. Similar establishments became popular throughout Scotland. As of 2016, the Glasgow Willow Tearooms are being restored.

[[Roger Fulford]] argues that tea rooms benefitted women, in that these neutral public spaces were instrumental in the "spread of independence" for women and their [[women's suffrage|struggle for the vote]].&lt;ref&gt;''Votes for Women'' 1957, quoted in ''Tea: A Very British Beverage'' by Paul Chrystal 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Chrystal characterises tea rooms as "popular and fashionable, especially with women", providing the a dignified and safe place to meet and eat, and strategise on political campaigns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chrystal|first1=Paul|title=Tea: A Very British Beverage|date=2014|accessdate=10 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Glen Eyrie Castle tea room.jpg|thumb|Tea room at [[Glen Eyrie]] castle in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado|Colorado Springs]]]]

There is a long tradition of tea rooms within [[Hotels in London#History|London's hotels]]. For example, [[Brown's Hotel]] has been serving tea for over 170 years &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brownshotel.com/dining/english_tea_room.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071028161313/http://www.brownshotel.com/dining/english_tea_room.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-10-28 |title=Luxury Hotels - 5 Star Hotels and Resorts - Rocco Forte |publisher=Browns Hotel |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; From the 1880s fine hotels in both the US and the UK featured tea rooms and tea courts, and by 1910 they had begun to host afternoon [[tea dance]]s as dance crazes swept both countries.

Tea rooms of all kinds were widespread in Britain by the 1950s, but in the following decades cafés became more fashionable, and tea rooms became less common. Nonetheless, there are still plenty of places that offer the opportunity to enjoy [[afternoon tea]], a luxurious light meal of savoury snacks ([[tea sandwich]]es) and small pastries. A less formal alternative is a [[cream tea]], particularly popular in the [[West Country]]: a [[scone (bread)|scone]] with jam and [[clotted cream]]. Another possibility is the [[Tea (meal)#Tea as the evening meal|high tea]], hot savoury food as the day's final (but relatively early) meal. There are plenty of regional variations: in Scotland, teas are usually served with a scones, [[pancake]]s, [[crumpet]]s and other cakes.

Tea rooms can be found in most towns and many villages.

==Tea as a break==
British workers by law, have the right to a minimum of a twenty-minute [[Break (work)|break]] in a shift of six hours; government guidelines describe this as "a tea or lunch break".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rest breaks at work|url=https://www.gov.uk/rest-breaks-work/overview|website=gov.uk|accessdate=9 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; More informally, this is known as [[elevenses]], i.e. a couple of hours before the midday meal, traditionally served at 11{{nbsp}}am. [[Builder's tea]] in a [[mug]] is typical of a quick tea break in the working day.

== Tea as a meal ==
{{Main|Tea (meal)}}
[[File:Bourton-on-the-water 1990 cream tea.jpg|thumb|A cream tea underway at [[Bourton-on-the-Water]], 1990]]

''Tea'' is not only the name of the beverage but also of a light meal. [[Anna Russell, Duchess of Bedford|Anna Maria, Duchess of Bedford]], is credited with its creation, circa 1840, to ward off hunger between luncheon and dinner, as the latter was being served later and later.{{fact|date=November 2018}} The notion of cakes or a light meal with tea passed to [[teahouse|teahouses or tearooms]]. While these establishments have declined in popularity since the [[Second World War]], there are still many to be found in the countryside. In the [[West Country]], [[cream tea]]s are a speciality: [[Scone (bread)|scones]], [[clotted cream]] and jam accompany the drink. [[Tea (meal)#Afternoon tea|Afternoon tea]], in contemporary [[British English|British usage]], usually indicates a special occasion, perhaps in a hotel dining room, with savoury snacks ([[tea sandwich]]es) as well as small sweet pastries.

A social event to enjoy tea together, usually in a private home, is a [[tea party]].

"Tea" (sometimes "high tea") can also mean the savoury, hot early evening meal. This usage is common in working-class British English and in [[Northern England]], [[Scotland]], and [[Northern Ireland]]). See [[Tea (meal)#Tea as the evening meal|Tea as the evening meal]].

== Tea cards ==
[[File:Union Pacific Tea Co. advertising card (14265700453).jpg|thumb|Union Pacific Tea Co. advertising card]]
In the United Kingdom, a number of varieties of loose tea sold in packets from the 1940s to the 1980s contained tea cards. These were illustrated cards roughly the same size as [[cigarette card]]s and intended to be collected by children. Perhaps the best known were [[Typhoo tea]] and [[Brooke Bond]] (manufacturer of [[PG Tips]]), the latter of whom also provided albums for collectors to keep their cards in. In the brand named ''Brooke Bond Dividend D'', the card was a [[dividend]] ("divvy") against the cost of the tea.

Some renowned artists were commissioned to illustrate the cards, including [[Charles Tunnicliffe]]. Many of these card collections are now valuable collectors' items.

A related phenomenon arose in the early 1990s when PG Tips released a series of tea-based [[pogs]], with pictures of cups of tea and [[chimpanzees]] on them. [[Tetley]]'s tea released competing pogs but never matched the popularity of the PG Tips variety.

'''Tourism in Bhutan''' began in 1974, when the [[Government of Bhutan]], in an effort to raise revenue and to promote Bhutanese unique culture and traditions to the outside world, opened its isolated country to foreigners. In 1974, 287 tourists visited [[Bhutan]]. The number of [[tourism | tourists]] visiting Bhutan increased to 2,850 in 1992, and rose dramatically to 7,158 in 1999.&lt;ref name="Digital himalaya"&gt;
{{cite web|author= Dorji, Tandi|url= http://www.thlib.org/static/reprints/jbs/JBS_03_01_03.pdf|title= Sustainability of Tourism in Bhutan|publisher= Digital Himalaya|accessdate= August 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 1980s tourism contributed over US$2 million in annual revenue.

Despite being open to foreigners, the Bhutanese government is acutely aware of the environmental impact tourists can have on Bhutan's unique and virtually unspoiled landscape and culture. Accordingly, they have restricted the level of tourist activity from the start, preferring [[high-quality tourism | higher-quality tourism]].  Until 1991, the Bhutan Tourism Corporation (BTC), a quasi-autonomous and self-financing body, implemented the government's tourism policy.&lt;ref name="Digital himalaya"/&gt; The Bhutanese government, however, privatised the Corporation in October 1991, facilitating private-sector investment and activity.  As a result, {{as of | 2018 | lc = on}} over 75 licensed tourist companies operate in the country.&lt;ref name="Digital himalaya"/&gt; All tourists (group or individual) must travel on a planned, prepaid, guided package-tour or custom-designed travel-program. Most foreigners cannot travel independently in the kingdom. The arrangements must be made through an officially approved tour operator, either directly or through an overseas agent.

The most important centres for tourism are in Bhutan's capital, [[Thimphu]], and in the western city of [[Paro, Bhutan|Paro]], near [[India]]. [[Paro Taktsang| Taktshang]], a cliff-side monastery (called the "Tiger's Nest" in English) overlooking the Paro Valley, is one of the country's attractions. This temple is incredibly sacred to Buddhists. Housed inside the temple is a cave in which the Buddhist Deity who brought Buddhism to Bhutan meditated for 90 days as he battled the demons that inhabited this valley, in order to spread Buddhism. The temple has been standing for well over a thousand years, yet has suffered two fires in which the damage has been repaired. [[Druk Air]] used to be{{when?|date=October 2018}} the only airline operating flights in Bhutan, however {{as of | 2012 | lc = on}} the country is serviced by [[Bhutan Airlines]] as well.&lt;ref&gt;

Potential visitors to Bhutan obtain visas through a Bhutanese embassy or consulate in their home country.

Countries with huge potential visitors include the [[Philippines]], [[Australia]], [[Japan]], [[Thailand]], [[Germany]], [[Taiwan]], and [[Canada]].{{cn|date=October 2018}}

==Arrivals by country==
Most visitors arriving to Bhutan on a short term basis were from the following countries of nationality:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abto.org.bt/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/BTM-2013.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://tcb.img.ebizity.bt/attachments/tcb_052016_btm-2015.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://tcb.img.ebizity.bt/attachments/tcb_041217_bhutan-tourism-monitor-2016.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, the country saw its highest tourist arrival yet at more than 250,000 people. The growth was boosted by the Asia-Pacific market, notably from India, Thailand, Vietnam, Philippines, Australia, Japan, China, Singapore, Bangladesh, Malaysia, Maldives, and South Korea. Western markets also increased, notably from the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, and France. Majority of 'tourists' that came from China were also classified as 'Tibetan refugees'.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbs.bt/news/?p=93784&lt;/ref&gt;

[[image:Acacia at sunset in the Kokiselei river Turkana northern Kenya.jpg|thumb|right|An ''[[Acacia sensu lato|Acacia]]'' tree in the Kokiselei river, northern Kenya]]
The greater '''Turkana Basin''' in [[East Africa]] (mainly northwestern [[Kenya]] and southern [[Ethiopia]], smaller parts of eastern [[Uganda]] and southeastern [[South Sudan]]) determines a large [[endorheic basin]], a [[drainage basin]] with no outflow centered around the north-southwards directed [[Gregory Rift]] system in Kenya and southern Ethiopia. The deepest point of the basin is the [[endorheic lake|endorheic]] [[Lake Turkana]], a [[brackish]] [[Soda lake]] with a very high [[Productivity (ecology)|ecological productivity]] in the Gregory Rift. 

A narrower definition for the term ''Turkana Basin'' is also in widespread use and means Lake Turkana and its environment within the confines of the Gregory Rift in Kenya and Ethiopia. This includes the [[Omo River (Ethiopia)|lower Omo River valley]] in Ethiopia. The Basin in the narrower definition is a site of geological [[subsidence]] containing one of the most continuous and temporally well controlled fossil records of the [[Plio-Pleistocene]]&lt;ref name="Feibel2011"&gt;Feibel, C., 2011, "A Geological History of the Turkana Basin."

== Geography ==
[[Lake Turkana]] sits at the center of the Turkana Basin and is flanked by the [[Chalbi Desert]] to the east, the Lotakipi Plains to the north, Karasuk to the west and Samburu to the south.&lt;ref name="atlas"&gt;"Atlas of Kenya," Ed. D. E. Warren, The Survey of Kenya, Nairobi 1962.&lt;/ref&gt; Included within these regions are desert scrub, desert grass and shrubland, and scattered Acacia or open grasslands.&lt;ref name="atlas" /&gt; The only true [[Perennial River]] is the [[Omo River (Ethiopia)|Omo River]] in Ethiopia in the northern part of the basin which discharges into the lake on its northern shore and supplies the lake with more than 98% of its annual water inflow. The two [[Intermittent river]]s which almost alone contribute the remaining 2% of water inflow are the [[Turkwel River]] and the [[Kerio River]] in Kenya in the western part of the basin. {{sfn|Hughes|Hughes|1992|p=191-192}} Much of the Turkana Basin today can be described as arid scrubland or even desert. The exception is the [[Omo River (Ethiopia)|Omo-]][[Gibe River|Gibe River valley]] to the north.

Important towns within the Turkana Basin include Lokitaung, Kakuma, Lodwar, Lorogumu, Ileret and Kargi. The [[Turkana people]] inhabit the west of the Basin, the [[Samburu people|Samburu]] and [[Pokot people|Pokot]] people inhabit the south, and the [[Nyangatom people|Nyangatom]], [[Daasanach people|Daasanach]] and [[Borana Oromo people|Borana Oromo]] peoples inhabit the north and east.&lt;ref name="atlas" /&gt; 

== Geological setting ==
[[image:Flamingo Lake 01.jpg|thumb|right|Flamingo lake on Central island in Lake Turkana]]
The oldest sedimentary records go back to the [[Cretaceous]] and are dominated by eastward flowing [[fluvial]] sequences draining into the Indian Ocean;&lt;ref name="Tiercelin" /&gt; later formations from the [[Oligocene]] and [[Miocene]] are characterised by similar fluvial regimes that are not however unified under a [[Geological unit|single geological group or system]].&lt;ref name="Boschetto"&gt;Boschetto, H. B., Brown, F. H., McDougall, I., 1992. "Stratigraphy of the Lothidok Range, northern Kenya, and K/Ar ages of its Miocene primates." ''[[Journal of Human Evolution]]'', vol.22 pp.47–71.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Leakey1996"&gt;Leakey, M. G., Feibel, C. S., Bernor, R. L., Harris, J. M., Cerling, T. E., Stewart K. M., Storrs, G. W., Walker, A., Werdelin, L., and A. J. Winkler, 1996, "Lothagam: A Record of Faunal Change in the Late Miocene of East Africa." ''[[Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology]]'', vol.16 no.3 pp.556–570.&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 4.2 million years ago (Ma) the region experienced widespread and significant [[volcanism]], associated with the [[Gombe basalts]] in the [[Koobi Fora]] formation to the east and with the [[Lothagam]] basalts further south; this event created a lake in the center of the basin and apparently established the modern, continuous depositional system of the Turkana Basin.&lt;ref name="Feibel2011" /&gt;

[[Deposition (geology)|Deposition]] in the Turkana Basin overall is driven primarily by [[subsidence]], a result of [[rift]]ing between the [[Somali Plate|Somali]] and [[African Plate|Nubian plates]] that has created a series of [[horst and graben]] structures, and led to approximately 1&amp;nbsp;km of sedimentary deposits at the center of the basin every 1 million years. [[Geologic record|Sedimentary records]], which become more sparse and discontinuous at greater distance from the basin center, suggest that the basin has alternated between fluvial and lacustrine regimes throughout the [[Plio-Pleistocene]], primarily as a result of continued volcanic activity first to the east, and later to the south of the basin.&lt;ref name="Bruhn"&gt;Bruhn, R. L., Brown, F. H., Gathogo, P. N., Haileab, B., 2011, "Pliocene volcano-tectonics and paleogeography of the Turkana Basin, Kenya and Ethiopia," ''[[Journal of African Earth Sciences]]'', vol.59, pp.295–312.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evolutionary record ==
Fossil records in the basin help establish much of what is known about African faunal evolution in the [[Neogene]] and [[Quaternary]].&lt;ref name="Sanders"&gt;Werdelin, L. and W. J. Sanders, Eds., "Cenozoic Mammals of Africa." [[University of California Press]]: 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; As in other regions, the end-Miocene [[Messinian salinity crisis|Messinian aridification crisis]] and [[Neogene#Climate and geography|global cooling trend]] seem to have influenced [[fossil]] assemblages in the Turkana Basin, either through [[Animal migration|migrations]] or [[Speciation|de novo evolutionary events]].&lt;ref name="BloisHadly"&gt;Blois, J. L. and Hadly, E. A., 2009. "Mammalian response to Cenozoic climate change." ''[[Annual Reviews in Earth and Planetary Sciences]]'', vol.37 pp.181–208.&lt;/ref&gt; Fossilized leaves characteristic of more mesic landscapes, faunal community compositions, and increase "[[C4 carbon fixation|C4]]" or arid-adapted plant contribution to herbivore [[carbon]] intake, all suggest that the [[Miocene]] world was more lush than the [[Pliocene]].&lt;ref name="Cerling1997"&gt;Cerling, T.E., Harris, J.M., MacFadden, B. J., Leakey, M. G., Quade, J., Eisenmann, V. and Ehleringer, J. R., 1997, "Global vegetation change through the Miocene/Pliocene boundary." Nature, vol.389 pp.153–158.&lt;/ref&gt; Some herbivores, like [[Equidae|horses]], responded rapidly to the spread of [[Savanna|C4 grasslands]], while other herbivores evolved more slowly, or developed a number of different responses to an increasingly arid landscape.&lt;ref name="Uno"&gt;Uno, Cerling, Harris et al, "Late Miocene to Pliocene carbon isotope record of differential diet change among East African herbivores." ''[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]]'', vol.108 no.16 pp.6509–6514.&lt;/ref&gt;

Evolutionary studies of the Turkana Basin have found what may be major intervals of faunal turnover after the Miocene as well, most notably in the late Pliocene and early Pleistocene,&lt;ref name="Vrba"&gt;Vrba, E.S., 1995b. "The Fossil Record of African Antelopes (Mammalia, Bovidae) in Relation to Human Evolution and Paleoclimate." In ES Vrba, GH Denton, TC Partridge and LH Buckle (eds): Paleoclimate and Evolution with Emphasis on Human Origins. Yale University Press, pp.385–424.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Behrensmeyer1997"&gt;Behrensmeyer, AK, Todd, NE, Potts R, McBrinn GE 1997 Late Pliocene Faunal Turnover in the Turkana Basin, Kenya and Ethiopia Science v27, pp1589-1594.&lt;/ref&gt; though later studies have suggested more gradual changes in herbivore community composition throughout this interval.&lt;ref name="BobeLeakey"&gt;Bobe, Rene and Leakey, Meave G., "Ecology of Plio-Pleistocene Mammals in the Omo-Turkana Basin and the Emergence of Homo." In Grine, F. E., Fleagle, J. G. and Leakey, R. E., Eds., "The First Humans – Origin and Early Evolution of the Genus Homo," pp.173–184, Springer, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; One cause of focus on the late Pliocene and early Pleistocene is the large literature on [[Human evolution|hominin fossil remains]] showing an apparent "[[adaptive radiation]]" across this boundary. While previous hominin species are considered to be part of a single, continuously evolving "[[Anagenesis|anagenetic]]" lineage,&lt;ref name="KimbelLockwood"&gt;Kimbel, W. H., C. A. Lockwood, et al. 2006. "Was Australopithecus anamensis ancestral to A. afarensis? A case of anagenesis in the hominin fossil record." ''[[Journal of Human Evolution]]'', 51(2): 134–152.&lt;/ref&gt; hominin fossil remains become extraordinarily diverse in East Africa 2.5 million years ago, with numerous species of robust [[Australopithecus|australopithecine]] and [[Homo habilis|early human ancestors]] found first in the Turkana Basin, and ultimately in South Africa as well.

The '''Wairau Bar''', or '''Te Pokohiwi''',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/634172/Wairau-River Encyclopædia Britannica: Wairau River]&lt;/ref&gt; is a {{convert|19|ha|acre|adj=on}} [[gravel bar]] formed where the [[Wairau River]] meets the sea in [[Cloudy Bay]], [[Marlborough Region|Marlborough]], north-eastern [[South Island]], New Zealand.  It is an important [[archeology|archaeological]] site,  settled by explorers from East Polynesia  who arrived in New Zealand about 1280.  It is the earliest known human settlement in New Zealand.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}  At the time of the occupation it is believed to have been a low scrub-covered island {{convert|2|to|3|m|ft|0}} high, {{convert|1.1|km|mi}} long and {{convert|0.4|km|mi}} wide.

==History==
The site was discovered in 1939 by then schoolboy [[Jim Eyles]] who, in 1942, found more artefacts.  Early investigations with [[Roger Duff]] unearthed a [[burial|burial site]].  Bones were scattered and close to the surface. This was originally believed to have been due to [[plough]]ing, but work by [[Bruce McFadgen]] shows that at some stage, probably between the two periods of occupation, the site was subject to either large storm surge waves or a tsunami which probably contributed to the scattering.  Using the techniques of the time about 2000 artefacts and 44 human [[skeleton]]s were removed and examined in detail.  The record seems to show that the partial skeletons of several children were found in shallow graves but these were in such poor condition and scattered that Duff was either unable or unwilling to keep the fragments using the methods of those days.  The examination showed that the people were using the same cultural methods as those in [[eastern Polynesia]], particularly the [[Marquesas Islands]]. Sixty-nine [[adze]]s were found at Wairau Bar, of which only three were made of [[Pounamu|greenstone]]. Eighty small, one-piece, triangular, stone or bone fishing lures with lashed unbarbed hook were found.&lt;ref&gt;Struggle Without End.R Walker. Penguin.2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Skeletal analysis===
In 2009 a more modern analysis by Buckley ''et al'' found the skeletons had a wide range of estimated ages.&lt;ref&gt;Buckley, H., Tayles, N., Halcrow, S., Robb, K., &amp; Fyfe, R. (2009). [http://www.pacificarchaeology.org/index.php/journal/article/view/5 The People of Wairau Bar: a Re-examination], ''Journal of Pacific Archaeology'', 1(1), 1-20.&lt;/ref&gt; None of the skeletons were from elderly people. The oldest was 39 and the second oldest was 36. Most of the skeletons were from people aged in their 20s. No children and only 1 teenager's skeleton was found. This is consistent with younger people being buried elsewhere, a practice that was quite common in the South Pacific.  There was only one child's skeleton.  The 21 skeletons with [[tooth|teeth]] all exhibited some developmental enamel disorders, showing they had suffered long stressful periods during childhood but survived to reasonably healthy adulthood. [[Dental caries|Tooth decay]] was rare, especially amongst males (a similar trait to [[neolithic]] people of the Americas (North American Indians). Many of the skeletons showed multiple signs of stress such as Harris lines (on [[X-ray]]s of long bones such as the tibia) caused by either infection or a poor diet.  Tooth wear was substantial among older individuals, with teeth worn to the roots, but this did not seem to be due to [[bracken]] fern root chewing.  All the adults showed healed bone fractures, indicating a well-balanced diet and a supportive community structure. Several skeletons showed features that are interpreted as being caused by [[tuberculosis]] (TB). The presence of TB was yet to be confirmed by [[DNA]] analysis in 2010. [[Anaemia]] was common, as was [[arthritis]]. The average height of the males was {{convert|175|cm|in}} and the females {{convert|161|cm|in}}. These figures show the early colonisers were tall compared to most Polynesians.&lt;ref&gt;Journal of Pacific Archaeology Vol 1, No 1, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The skeletons were all found in shallow graves, with the heads pointing towards the east and the feet to the west, as was the practice in eastern Polynesia.  The archaeological layers were shallow.

===Site use===
The later 2009–2010 study, using more precise  modern methods, resulted in the site being more accurately dated by the [[Carbon-14|radiocarbon]] method to 1288–1300 [[Common Era|CE]].  The site appeared to be occupied twice over a period of about 20 years, which is consistent with information from other early Polynesian colonisation sites in New Zealand.  Accurate dates were obtained from [[moa]] egg fragments found in [[grave]] and [[midden]] sites.  Buried with the skeletons were moa bone reel [[necklace]]s, whole moa eggs (used as water carriers), [[argillite]] adze heads, carved [[Serpentine group|serpentine]] that looked like [[shark]] and [[whale]] teeth, [[harpoon]] heads and [[tattoo]] [[chisel]]s.  Few [[nephrite]] (jade or greenstone) [[artifact (archaeology)|artefacts]] were found. It is believed the site was primarily a factory for making stone adze heads. It has been estimated from the adze heads found and the large area of stone flakes that about 12,000 adze heads were made here or about 400 to 500 per year. Argillite,the most common adze head material is hard, compressed mudstone. It is found at D'Urville Island only {{convert|100|km|mi}} away from Wairau Bar. A Maori argillite quarry is located in the hills behind Nelson City.  Such large numbers of adze heads have implications about trade in the early archaic period. One adze  found in the 2009 study has been identified by archaeologist [[Richard Walter (archaeologist)|Richard Walter]] as Tahanga basalt from Tahanga Hill near Opito, a well known moahunter area. It was of quadrangular shape(known as Type 1), identical in design to those use in the Cook Island at the same time. Also found were chert from Kaikoura, which was commonly used for making holes, pumice from the volcanic plateau,which was used as floats and for making small handheld fire bowls and small amounts of greenstone from the West Coast which was made into two adze heads. This indicates that the Wairau Bar moa hunters travelled extensively through New Zealand  exploring the land. Adze heads are associated with shaping wood, especially in the making of waka. The stone head was lashed to an L-shaped natural crook and swung so the blade struck the wood more or less horizontally.&lt;ref&gt;The Encyclopedia of NZ. Kohatu. The Maori Use of Stone.&lt;/ref&gt;

An investigation by a team from [[Otago University]] found a huge stone-lined umu or [[hangi]] pit (earth oven) {{convert|1.5|m|ft}} deep by {{convert|4|m|ft}} across—estimated to be big enough to feed 1000 people by a local Maori familiar with modern hangi. However these large hangi or umu pits were identified in 1968 (in the [[Kermadec Islands|Kermadecs]]) by Roger Duff, as being typical Polynesian umu ti. The purpose of the large pit was to cook the taproot of the [[Cordyline fruticosa|ti plant]].  This was a common method of reducing the tuberous root to a sugary pulp. The ti can be cultivated easily but is slow growing.  The root is about {{convert|900|mm|in}} long by {{convert|90|mm|in}} wide, to a point. It is cooked very slowly in an umu for 12 to 24&amp;nbsp;hours.  The plant is usually associated with the far north of New Zealand but may have been grown further south during the warmer climatic period associated with early Polynesian settlement. A [[geophysics]] study showed that it was only one of six such pits in a rough horseshoe shape on the edge of a lagoon. The study also showed the site to be much bigger than previously thought—at least {{convert|11|ha|acre}} and possibly larger as two boundaries have not been accurately plotted.  At least 50&amp;nbsp;percent of the area was intact.

By 2007 only 2&amp;nbsp;percent of the site had been scientifically investigated. "Intact" skeletons (many minus the head) were found in four groups, with the oldest (1-7) being closer to the sea and at the western end of the site. These have been shown by DNA studies to be people who had lived in East Polynesia. The largest group of skeletons (15-43) were in an area to the east which covered an oval area {{convert|30|by|50|m|ft}}. These people are believed to be moa hunters who lived their lives in New Zealand, based on bone and teeth DNA analysis. The main habitation area was central,about {{convert|25|to|50|m|ft}} from the southern lagoon edge. There were three zones of cooking and surface midden debris, all about {{convert|100|by|30|m|ft}} approximately. The earliest zone was alongside the lagoon and the latter on the ocean side of the island. At the time of the second occupation of the island, the second site  was protected from the ocean by a long and narrow boulder bank. There are two adze-making sites—one adjacent to the early occupation zone and the second adjacent to the later burial site. The most intensely studied indicates a right handed person sitting in the porch area of a small whare. They sat in front of a flat stone on a path cobbled with small round rocks, chipping off flakes of argillite with a hammer stone of quartzite. The limited studies done so far indicate a sizeable village. It is apparent that bodies were commonly buried about {{convert|60|m|ft}} from the cooking and working zones.

===Exploitation of fauna===
After being used for cooking, each umu had subsequently been used as a midden.  The bottom layer of the midden showed that at the very earliest occupation time [[shellfish]], such as [[mussel]]s, were much larger, averaging {{convert|250|mm|in}} long.  The lower layers of the midden also showed that early moa bones were not smashed to get at the [[Bone marrow|marrow]] as was common in the upper layers. Whale bones were found in the lower layer. Mainly moa leg bones were found indicating that moa were hunted inland and brought to the site for cooking.  Bones from all five moa species located in the upper South Island were found.  As well as the remains of numerous butchered moa, [[Pinniped|seal]]s, [[porpoise]]s, the extinct [[Haast's eagle]], [[Eyles' harrier]], [[New Zealand swan]] and [[New Zealand raven]], [[kurī]] (Maori dogs), [[tuatara]], [[kiore]], shellfish such as [[Paphies australis|pipi]], [[paua]], [[cockle (bivalve)|cockle]]s, and marine bones from [[eel]]s, [[Skate (fish)|skate]], [[Molidae|sunfish]] and sharks were found there. Anderson and Smith in their 1996 study stated that the first colonists enjoyed a sustained assault on the local [[megafauna]].

At the time of the latest investigation the local [[Rangitāne]] [[Iwi]] reburied 60 skeletons claimed to be their forebears in a formal ceremony at the lagoon site.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.TeAra.govt.nz/NewZealanders/MaoriNewZealanders/WhenWasNewZealandFirstSettled/en]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EDA&gt;Kipfer, Barbara Ann.

==Shell  link to East Polynesia==
A study of a turret shell artifact  completed in 2011 shows a direct link between the Wairau Bar site and East Polynesia. This is only the second artifact found in New Zealand originating from East Polynesia dated to the early Polynesian colonial period.(The other is the early East Polynesian pearl lure found at Tairua identified by A. Powell of Auckland Museum.) The shell tool is a modified spiral gastropod shell. These tools were used as small chisels or gouges,possibly for enlarging holes. The point of the turret shell was removed and the remains honed to a chisel point of about 60 degrees by grinding. Although found in various East Polynesian Islands the most common site by far is Fa'alia, Ruahine, in the [[Society Islands]], where many have been located from the same period.&lt;ref&gt;Journal of Pacific Archaeology, Vol 2, No2, 2011.Connections with Hawaiki the evidence of a shell tool from Wairau bar in Marlborough NZ.J. Davidson, Findlater, Fyfe, MacDonald and Marshall&lt;/ref&gt; The significance of the find that was dug up 60 years ago was not realised until recently.

==2012 DNA study results==
Dr Lisa Matisoo-Smith and Dr Michael Knapp from New Zealand's Otago University have released the results of a recent bone and teeth DNA study carried out on  early Polynesian migrants to New Zealand who lived at Wairau Bar about 1285–1300 AD. The results of DNA analysis reinforce the idea that some these people were original settlers from East Polynesia, as they had a very different diet based on soft starchy food. The two other burial groups showed a very different, more varied diet consistent with being raised in New Zealand. Scientists found that there was a wide range of DNA mutations indicating that settlers were part of a reasonably large group. This indicate a planned migration rather than isolated random groups. One of the mutations was associated with insulin rejection as found in type 2 diabetes&lt;ref&gt;ABC Science.23 Oct 2012. Ancient DNA sheds light on Maori settlement.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Otago University Media release.&lt;/ref&gt; This reinforces the mathematical modelling done in the past that shows the same pattern. Work will now begin on tracing East Polynesian populations that have the same DNA mutations in order to discover the specific homelands of the Wairau Bar settlers.&lt;ref&gt;ABC Science. 23 Oct 2012. Ancient DNA Sheds light on Maori Settlement.&lt;/ref&gt; The DNA pattern is very similar to that found in the Marquesas Islands in East Polynesia at the same time.

The term "'''Yankee'''" and its contracted form "'''Yank'''" have several interrelated meanings, all referring to people from the United States; its various senses depend on the context. Outside the United States, "Yank" is used informally to refer to any American, including Southerners. Within Southern American areas, "Yankee" is a derisive term which refers to all Northerners, or specifically to those from the region of [[New England]]. According to the ''Oxford English Dictionary'', it is "a nickname for a native or inhabitant of New England, or, more widely, of the northern States generally;" during the [[American Civil War]], it was "applied by the Confederates to the soldiers of the Federal army."

Elsewhere in the United States, it largely refers to people from the Northeastern states, but especially those with [[New England]] cultural ties, such as descendants of [[colonial New England]] settlers, wherever they live.&lt;ref name="ruth"&gt;{{cite journal|year=1963|title=Swamp Yankee|journal=American Speech|volume=38|issue=2|pages=121–123|doi=10.2307/453288|jstor=453288|author=Ruth Schell}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its sense is sometimes more cultural than geographical, emphasizing the Calvinist Puritan Christian beliefs and traditions of the Congregationalists who brought their culture when they settled outside New England. The speech dialect of [[Eastern New England English]] is called "Yankee" or "Yankee dialect".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yXY0yQnvmmUC&amp;pg=PA326|title=The Facts on File Dictionary of American Regionalisms|publisher=Infobase|year=2000|page=326|author=Robert Hendrickson}}&lt;/ref&gt; The informal British and Irish "Yank" refers to Americans in general. It is especially popular among Britons and Australians and sometimes carries pejorative overtones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/yank_2#yank_2__3 |title=Cambridge Advanced Learner's Dictionary Online |publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origin and history of the word==
[[File:Boston1775.jpg|thumb|350px|Loyalist newspaper cartoon from Boston ridicules "Yankie Doodles" militia who have encircled the British forces inside the city]]

===Early usage===
The root of the term is uncertain. British General [[James Wolfe]] made the earliest recorded use of the word Yankee in 1758 to refer to people from what became the United States. He referred to the New England soldiers under his command as Yankees: "I can afford you two companies of Yankees, and the more because they are better for ranging and scouting than either work or vigilance".&lt;ref name="Mathews"&gt;Mathews (1951) p 1896&lt;/ref&gt; Later British use of the word often was derogatory, as in a cartoon of 1775 ridiculing "Yankee" soldiers.&lt;ref name="Mathews" /&gt; New Englanders themselves employed the word in a neutral sense; the "[[Pennamite–Yankee War]]," for example, was a series of clashes in 1769 over land titles in Pennsylvania between "Yankee" settlers from [[Connecticut Colony|Connecticut]] and "Pennamite" settlers from [[History of Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania]].

The meaning of ''Yankee'' has varied over time. In the 18th century, it referred to residents of New England descended from the original English settlers of the region. [[Mark Twain]] used the word in this sense the following century in his novel ''[[A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court]]'', published in 1889. As early as the 1770s, British people applied the term to any person from the United States. In the 19th century, Americans in the southern United States employed the word in reference to Americans from the northern United States, though not to recent immigrants from Europe. Thus, a visitor to [[Richmond, Virginia]] commented in 1818, "The enterprising people are mostly strangers; Scots, Irish, and especially New England men, or Yankees, as they are called".&lt;ref&gt;See Mathews, (1951) pp. 1896–98 and [http://dictionary.oed.com/cgi/entry/50288716 ''Oxford English Dictionary'', quoting M. Birkbeck]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rejected etymologies===
Many etymologies have been suggested for the word ''Yankee'', but modern linguists generally reject theories which suggest that it originated in any Indian languages.&lt;ref name="MW"/&gt; This includes a theory purported by a British officer in 1789, who said that it was derived from the [[Cherokee language|Cherokee]] word ''eankke'' ("coward")—despite the fact that no such word existed in the Cherokee language.&lt;ref name="MW"&gt;''The Merriam-Webster new book of word histories'' (1991) pp. 516–517.&lt;/ref&gt; Another theory surmised that the word was borrowed from the [[Wyandot people|Wyandot]]&lt;ref&gt;The Wyandot people were called Hurons by the French.&lt;/ref&gt; pronunciation of the French ''l'anglais'', meaning "the Englishman" or "the English language", which was sounded as ''Y'an-gee''.&lt;ref name="MW"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mathews (1951) p.&amp;nbsp;1896.&lt;/ref&gt;

American musicologist [[Oscar Sonneck]] debunked a romanticized false etymology in his 1909 work ''Report on "The Star-Spangled Banner", "Hail Columbia", "America", "Yankee Doodle"''. He cited a popular theory which claimed that the word came from a tribe who called themselves ''Yankoos'', said to mean "invincible". The story claimed that New Englanders had defeated this tribe after a bloody battle, and the remaining ''Yankoo'' Indians transferred their name to the victors—who were "agreeable to the Indian custom". Sonneck notes that multiple American writers since 1775 had repeated this story as if it were fact, despite what he perceived to be holes in it. It had never been the tradition of any Indian tribe to transfer their name to other peoples, according to Sonneck, nor had any settlers ever adopted an Indian name to describe themselves.&lt;ref&gt;This is not to be confused with adopting an Indian name for a geographical location.&lt;/ref&gt; Sonneck concludes by pointing out that there was never a tribe called the ''Yankoos''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Sonneck | first = O. G. | title = Report on "The star-spangled banner", "Hail Columbia", "America", "Yankee Doodle | publisher = University Press of the Pacific | location = Honolulu, Hawaii | year = 2001 | page = 83 | isbn = 0898755328 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dutch origin===
[[File:Nieuw Nederland.png|thumb|250px|New Netherland is to the northwest, and New England is to the northeast.]]

Most linguists look to Dutch language sources, noting the extensive interaction between the colonial Dutch in [[New Netherland]] (now largely New York, New Jersey, Delaware, and western Connecticut) and the English in colonial [[New England]] (Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and eastern Connecticut).&lt;ref name="MW"/&gt; [[Michael Quinion]] and [[Patrick Hanks]] argue that the term refers to the Dutch feminine diminutive name ''Janneke''&lt;ref name=posh&gt;[http://www.worldwidewords.org/reviews/re-por1.htm Review of Quinion, Michael ''Port Out, Starboard Home'']&lt;/ref&gt; or masculine diminutive name ''Janke'',&lt;ref name=yanky&gt;Harper, Douglas. ''Online Etymology Dictionary'': "[http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=yankee Yankee]". 2013. Accessed 13 Jul 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; which would be Anglicized as "Yankee" due to the Dutch pronunciation of ''J'' as the English ''Y''. Quinion and Hanks posit that it was "used as a nickname for a Dutch-speaking American in colonial times" and could have grown to include non-Dutch colonists, as well.&lt;ref name=posh/&gt; Alternatively, the Dutch given names ''Jan'' ({{IPA-nl|jɑn|lang}}) and ''Kees'' ({{IPA-nl|keːs|lang}}) have long been common, and the two are sometimes combined into a single name (e.g., [[Jan Kees de Jager]]). Its Anglicized spelling ''Yankee'' could, in this way, have been used to mock Dutch Americans. The chosen name ''Jan Kees'' may have been partly inspired by a dialectal rendition of ''Jan Kaas'' ("John Cheese"), the generic nickname that Southern Dutch used for Dutch people living in the North.&lt;ref name=yanky/&gt;

The [[Online Etymology Dictionary]] gives its origin as around 1683, when it was applied insultingly to Dutch Americans (especially freebooters) by the English. Linguist [[Jan de Vries (linguist)|Jan de Vries]] notes that there was mention of a pirate named ''[[Yankey Willems|Dutch Yanky]]'' in the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = de Vries | first = Jan | year = 1971 | title = Nederlands Etymologisch Woordenboek | language = Dutch | at = [[Headword]]: yankee}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Life and Adventures of Sir Launcelot Greaves]]'' (1760) contains the passage, "Haul forward thy chair again, take thy berth, and proceed with thy story in a direct course, without yawing like a Dutch yanky."&lt;ref&gt;''The Life and Adventures of Sir Launcelot Greaves'', [[Tobias Smollett]]'', second page of chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt; It was at some point reappropriated by Dutch settlers of [[New Amsterdam]] who started using it against the English colonists of neighboring Connecticut.&lt;ref name=yanky /&gt;

== Historic uses ==

===Canadian usage===
An early use of the term outside the United States was in the creation of [[Sam Slick]] the "Yankee Clockmaker" in a newspaper column in [[City of Halifax|Halifax]], [[Nova Scotia]], Canada in 1835. The character was a plain-speaking American who becomes an example for Nova Scotians to follow in his industry and practicality; and his uncouth manners and vanity were the epitome of qualities that his creator detested. The character was developed by [[Thomas Chandler Haliburton]], and it grew between 1836 and 1844 in a series of publications.&lt;ref name = DCB&gt;Cogswell, F. (2000).[http://www.biographi.ca/009004-119.01-e.php?BioId=38597 Haliburton, Thomas Chandler]. ''Dictionary of Canadian Biography Online,'' Volume IX 1861–1870. University of Toronto/Université Laval. Retrieved on: 2011-08-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Damn Yankee===
The ''damned Yankee'' usage dates from 1812.&lt;ref name="Mathews" /&gt; Confederates popularized it as a derogatory term for their Northern enemies during and after the [[American Civil War]] (1861–65). In an old joke, a Southerner alleges, "I was twenty-one years old before I learned that 'damn' and 'Yankee' were separate words". In fact, the spelling "damnyankee" is not uncommon.

It became a catch phrase, often used humorously for Yankees visiting the South, as in the mystery novel ''Death of a Damn Yankee: A Laura Fleming Mystery'' (2001) by [[Toni Kelner]]. Another popular although facetious saying is that "a Yankee is someone from the North who visits the South. A damn Yankee is one who moves here."

==Yankee Doodle==
A pervasive influence on the use of the term throughout the years has been the [[Yankee Doodle|song "Yankee Doodle"]] which was popular during the [[American Revolutionary War]] (1775–83), as it was broadly adopted by American patriots following the [[battles of Lexington and Concord]]. The song was popular among the British troops, creating a stereotype of the Yankee simpleton who stuck a feather in his cap and thought that he was stylish.&lt;ref name="abcnews"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mooney|first1=Mark|title='Yankee Doodle Dandy' Explained and Other Revolutionary Facts|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/yankee-doodle-dandy-explained-revolutionary-facts/story?id=24314207|accessdate=6 May 2016|publisher=ABC News|date=14 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, "Yankee Doodle" is the official [[List of U.S. state songs|state song]] of Connecticut.&lt;ref&gt;See Connecticut State Library, [http://www.cslib.org/yankeedoodle.htm "Yankee Doodle, the State Song of the State of Connecticut"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071226183408/http://www.cslib.org/yankeedoodle.htm |date=2007-12-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cultural history ==
The term ''Yankee'' now may mean any resident of New England or of any of the [[Northeastern United States]]. The original Yankees diffused widely across the northern United States, leaving their imprints in New York, the [[Upper Midwest]], and places as far away as [[Seattle]], [[San Francisco]], and [[Honolulu]].&lt;ref&gt;Mathews (1909), Holbrook (1950)&lt;/ref&gt; Yankees typically lived in villages consisting of clusters of separate farms.  Often they were merchants, bankers, teachers, or professionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Kenneth J. Winkle|title=The Young Eagle: The Rise of Abraham Lincoln|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JcEVAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA78|year=2001|publisher=Taylor |page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; Village life fostered local democracy, best exemplified by the open [[town meeting]] form of government which still exists today in New England. Village life also stimulated mutual oversight of moral behavior and emphasized civic virtue. From the New England seaports of [[Boston]], [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem]], [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]], and [[New London, Connecticut|New London]], among others, the Yankees built  international trade routes, stretching to China by 1800. Much of the profit from trading was reinvested in the textile and machine tools industries.&lt;ref&gt;Knights (1991)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stereotypes===
[[Yankee ingenuity]] was a worldwide stereotype of inventiveness, technical solutions to practical problems, "know-how," self-reliance, and individual enterprise.&lt;ref&gt;Eugene S. Ferguson, "On the Origin and Development of American Mechanical 'know-how'", ''American Studies'' 3.2 (1962): 3–16. [https://journals.ku.edu/index.php/amerstud/article/viewFile/2075/2034 online]&lt;/ref&gt; The stereotype first appeared in the 19th century. As Mitchell Wilson notes, "Yankee ingenuity and Yankee git-up-and-go did not exist in colonial days."&lt;ref&gt;quoted in  Reynold M. Wik, "Some interpretations of the mechanization of agriculture in the Far West." ''Agricultural History'' (1975): 73–83. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3742110 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

The peculiar Yankee became a stock character in standardized comedic venues, especially the widely popular humor magazine ''Yankee Notions'', published in New York City in the years leading up to the [[American Civil War]]. The visceral stereotype of the greedy, witch-burning Yankee was developed in the literature of the English-speaking world, epitomized in the character of [[Brother Jonathan]]. [[Burlesque]]s or comedic performances by Yankee impersonators dominated popular theater in the 1800s. The Yankee as an irksome, meddling, and purer-than-thou peddler was a theme appearing in [[American literature]] written by [[Washington Irving]] (critical of his character [[Ichabod Crane]]), [[James Fenimore Cooper]] (particularly in his ''[[The Chainbearer|The Chainbearer; Or, The Littlepage Manuscript]]'' series), and [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]] (author of the ''[[Scarlet Letter]]''), a [[Copperhead (politics)|copperhead]] who sought more Christian compassion for sinners and violators of civil laws and held a strong antipathy toward the Puritans.

In defense, the New Englander embraced the insulting term "Yankee". The great majority of Yankees gravitated toward the burgeoning cities of the American Northeast, while wealthy New Englanders also sent ambassadors to frontier communities where they became influential bankers and newspaper printers. Using their influence in positive ways, they introduced the term "Universal Yankee Nation" to represent and proselytize their hopes for national and global influence.&lt;ref&gt;Susan E. Gray, ''The Yankee West: community life on the Michigan frontier'' (1996) p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===
In religion, New England Yankees originally followed the [[Puritan]] tradition, as expressed in [[Congregationalism in the United States|Congregational churches]]. Beginning in the late colonial period, many became Presbyterians, [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalians]], [[Methodism|Methodists]], [[American Baptist Churches USA|Baptists]], or, later, [[Unitarianism|Unitarians]]. Strait-laced 17th-century moralism as derided by novelist [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]] faded in the 18th century. The [[First Great Awakening]] (under [[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]] and others) in the mid-18th century and the [[Second Great Awakening]] in the early 19th century (under [[Charles Grandison Finney]], among others) emphasized personal piety, revivals, and devotion to civic duty. Theologically, [[Arminianism]] replaced the original [[Calvinism]]. [[Horace Bushnell]] introduced the idea of Christian nurture, through which children would be brought to religion without revivals.

===Politics and reform===
After 1800, Yankees spearheaded most reform movements, including those for abolition of slavery, temperance in use of alcohol, increase in women's political rights, and improvement in women's education. [[Emma Willard]] and [[Mary Lyon]] pioneered in the higher education of women, while Yankees comprised most of the reformers who went South during [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] in the late 1860s to educate the [[Freedman|Freedmen]].&lt;ref&gt;Taylor (1979)&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian John Buenker has examined the worldview of the Yankee settlers in the Midwest:&lt;blockquote&gt;Because they arrived first and had a strong sense of community and mission, Yankees were able to transplant New England institutions, values, and mores, altered only by the conditions of frontier life.  They established a public culture that emphasized the work ethic, the sanctity of private property, individual responsibility, faith in residential and social mobility, practicality, piety, public order and decorum, reverence for public education, activists, honest, and frugal government, town meeting democracy, and he believed that there was a public interest that transcends particular and stock ambitions.  Regarding themselves as the elect and just in a world rife with sin and corruption, they felt a strong moral obligation to define and enforce standards of community and personal behavior….  This pietistic worldview was substantially shared by British, Scandinavian, Swiss, English-Canadian and Dutch Reformed immigrants, as well as by German Protestants and many of the Forty-Eighters.&lt;ref&gt;John Buenker, "Wisconsin" in {{cite book|last=James H. Madison, ed. |first=|title=Heartland: Comparative Histories of the Midwestern States |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TMUCo0UXCjoC&amp;pg=PA72|year=1988|publisher=Indiana University Press|pages=72–73}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Yankees dominated New England, much of [[upstate New York]], and much of the upper Midwest, and were the strongest supporters of the new Republican party in the 1860s. This was especially true for the [[Congregationalists]], [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]]s, and (after 1860) the Methodists among them. A study of 65 predominantly Yankee counties showed that they voted only 40% for the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whigs]] in 1848 and 1852, but became 61–65% [[History of the Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] in presidential elections of 1856 through 1864.&lt;ref&gt;Kleppner p 55&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ivy League]] universities remained bastions of old Yankee culture until well after [[World War II]], particularly [[History of Harvard University|Harvard]] and [[Yale University|Yale]], as well as "[[Little Ivies|Little Ivy]]" [[liberal arts]] colleges.

===Presidential Yankees===
President [[Calvin Coolidge]] was a striking example of the modern Yankee stereotype. Coolidge moved from rural [[Vermont]] to urban [[Massachusetts]] and was educated at elite [[Amherst College]]. Yet his flint-faced, unprepossessing ways and terse rural speech proved politically attractive. "That Yankee twang will be worth a hundred thousand votes", explained one Republican leader.&lt;ref&gt;William Allen White, ''A Puritan in Babylon: The Story of Calvin Coolidge'' (1938) p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; Coolidge's laconic ways and dry humor were characteristic of stereotypical rural "Yankee humor" at the turn of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur George Crandall, [https://books.google.com/books?id=AhXdAf0lBqwC&amp;pg=PA13&amp;dq=%22new+england+joke+lore%22 ''New England Joke Lore: The Tonic of Yankee Humor''], (F.A. Davis Company, 1922).&lt;/ref&gt;

The fictional [[Harvard University|Harvard]] graduate [[Thurston Howell, III|Thurston Howell III]] of ''[[Gilligan's Island]]'' typifies the old Yankee elite in a comical way; the [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]]-born [[M*A*S*H (TV series)|''M*A*S*H'']] surgeon character [[List of M*A*S*H characters#Charles Winchester|Maj. Charles Emerson Winchester III]] was more satirical, portrayed by [[David Ogden Stiers]].

By the beginning of the 21st century, systematic Yankee ways had permeated the entire society through education. Many observers from the 1880s onward predicted that Yankee politicians would be no match for the new generations of ethnic politicians, yet the presence of Yankees at the top tier of modern American politics was typified by presidents [[George H. W. Bush]] and [[George W. Bush]], and former [[Democratic National Committee]] chairman [[Howard Dean]], as well as losing 2004 Democratic presidential nominee [[John Kerry|John Forbes Kerry]], descendant through his mother of the Scottish [[Forbes family]], which emigrated to Massachusetts in the 1750s.

==Contemporary uses==

===In the United States===
The term ''Yankee'' can have many different meanings within the United States that are contextually and geographically dependent. Traditionally, ''Yankee'' was most often used to refer to a New Englander descended from the original settlers of the region, thus often suggesting Puritanism and thrifty values.&lt;ref&gt;Bushman, (1967)&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-20th century, some speakers applied the word to any American born north of the [[Mason–Dixon Line]], though usually with a specific focus still on New England. ''New England Yankee'' might be used to differentiate.&lt;ref&gt;David Lauderdale [https://web.archive.org/web/20101226172934/http://www.islandpacket.com/2010/12/23/1489118/a-white-christmas-so-close-but.html A white Christmas – so close, but yet so far]. islandpacket.com (2010-12-23)&lt;/ref&gt; However, within New England itself, the term still refers more specifically to old-stock New Englanders of English descent. For example:

: "Certainly the Irish have for years complained of Yankee discrimination against them." 
:: —William F. Whyte&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Whyte|first1=William F.|authorlink=William Foote Whyte|title=Race Conflicts in the North End of Boston|journal=The New England Quarterly|date=December 1939|volume=12|issue=4|pages=623–642|jstor=360446}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: "There were no civil rights groups then. Even the Federal Government was controlled by bigoted Yankees and Irish who banded together against the Italian immigrant." 
:: —Fred Langone&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Langone|first1=Fred|authorlink=Frederick C. Langone|title=The North End: Where It All Began|publisher=Post-Gazette, American Independence Edition|location=Boston|date=1994|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: "The one anomaly of this era was the election of Yankee Republican Leverett Saltonstall as governor in 1938, and even then Saltonstall jokingly attributed his high vote totals in Irish districts to his 'South Boston face'." 
:: —Stephen Puleo&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Puleo|first1=Stephen|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jET-HIcybREC&amp;pg=PA185|page=185|title=The Boston Italians|date=2007|publisher=Beacon Press|location=Boston|isbn=9780807050361}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the southern United States, the term is used in derisive reference to any Northerner, especially one who has migrated to the South. Senator [[J. William Fulbright]] of Arkansas pointed out as late as 1966, "The very word 'Yankee' still wakens in Southern minds historical memories of defeat and humiliation, of the [[Atlanta Campaign|burning of Atlanta]] and [[Sherman's March to the Sea|Sherman's March to the Sea]], or of an ancestral farmhouse burned by [[Quantrill's Raiders]]".&lt;ref&gt;Fulbright's statement of March 7, 1966, quoted in Randall Bennett Woods, "Dixie's Dove: J. William Fulbright, The Vietnam War and the American South," ''The Journal of Southern History,'' vol. 60, no. 3 (Aug., 1994), p. 548.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ambrose Bierce]] defines the term in ''[[The Devil's Dictionary]]'' as: "In Europe, an American. In the Northern States of our Union, a New Englander. In the Southern States the word is unknown. (See DAMNYANK.)"

[[E. B. White]] humorously draws his own distinctions:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.org/encyclopedia/yankee/|title=Yankee|last=Society|first=National Geographic|date=2012-11-19|work=National Geographic Society|access-date=2018-09-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

::To foreigners, a Yankee is an American.
::To Americans, a Yankee is a Northerner.
::To Northerners, a Yankee is an Easterner.
::To Easterners, a Yankee is a New Englander.
::To New Englanders, a Yankee is a Vermonter.
::And in Vermont, a Yankee is somebody who eats pie for breakfast.

Major League Baseball's [[New York Yankees]] acquired the name from journalists after the team moved from Baltimore in 1903, though they were officially known as the Highlanders until 1913. The regional [[Yankees–Red Sox rivalry]] can make the utterance of the term "Yankee" unwelcome to some fans in New England, especially to the most dedicated Red Sox fans living in the northeastern United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/playoffs/2004-10-20-yanks-sox-rivalry_x.htm |title=Red Sox-Yankees is baseball's ultimate rivalry |last1=Bodley |first1=Hal |last2= |first2= |date=October 20, 2004 |work= |publisher=USAToday.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''[[Swamp Yankee]]'' is sometimes used in rural Rhode Island, Connecticut, and southeastern Massachusetts to refer to Protestant farmers of moderate means and their descendants (in contrast to richer or urban Yankees); "swamp Yankee" is often regarded as a derogatory term.&lt;ref name=ruth/&gt; Scholars note that the famous Yankee "twang" survives mainly in the hill towns of interior New England, though it is disappearing even there.&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, ''Albion's Seed'' p. 62; Edward Eggleston, ''The Transit of Civilization from England to the U.S. in the Seventeenth Century''. (1901) p. 110; Fleser (1962)&lt;/ref&gt; 

Mark Twain's novel ''[[A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court]]'' popularized the word as a nickname for residents of Connecticut, and Connecticut Air National Guard unit [[103d Airlift Wing]] is nicknamed "The Flying Yankees."

=== In other countries ===
The shortened form ''Yank'' is used as a derogatory, pejorative, playful, or colloquial term for Americans in Britain,&lt;ref&gt;David Reynolds, ''Rich relations: the American occupation of Britain, 1942-1945'' (1995)&lt;/ref&gt; Australia,&lt;ref&gt;Eli Daniel Potts, and Annette Potts, ''Yanks Down Under, 1941-45: The American Impact on Australia.

Turner and Edward F. Hale, eds. ''Yanks Are Coming: GIs in Britain in WWII'' (1983)&lt;/ref&gt; In Cockney [[rhyming slang]], an American is a ''Septic'' or ''Seppo'', derived from "Septic Tank", "Yank".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Green|first=Jonathon|title=Cassell Dictionary of Rhyming Slang|year=1998|publisher=Cassell|location=London|pages=1048}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Venezuelan Spanish has the word {{lang|es|pitiyanqui}}, derived c 1940 around the oil industry from ''petty yankee'' or ''petit yanqui'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/06/world/americas/06venez.html "A Little Insult Is All the Rage in Venezuela: 'Pitiyanqui'"], ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; a derogatory term for those who profess an exaggerated and often ridiculous admiration for anything from the United States. In the late 19th century, the Japanese were called "the Yankees of the East" in praise of their industriousness and drive to modernization.&lt;ref&gt;William Eleroy Curtis, ''The Yankees of the East, Sketches of Modern Japan''. (New York: 1896).&lt;/ref&gt; In Japan, the term ''Yankī'' has been used since the late 1970s to refer to a type of delinquent youth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.goo.ne.jp/leaf/jn2/223508/m0u/%E3%83%A4%E3%83%B3%E3%82%AD%E3%83%BC/ Daijirin dictionary], [http://dic.yahoo.co.jp/dsearch?enc=UTF-8&amp;p=ヤンキー&amp;stype=0&amp;dtype=0 Yahoo!

It is not considered offensive or anti-American, but rather a colloquial expression.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.h-net.msu.edu/gateways/migration/threads/identity/disc-southernS96.html Comments on H-South by Seppo K J Tamminen]. h-net.msu.edu&lt;/ref&gt;
