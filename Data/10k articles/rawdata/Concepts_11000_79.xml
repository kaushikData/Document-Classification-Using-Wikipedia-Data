      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2845">'''Andrey Efi''' (born '''Andrey Ivanovich Efimoff''' (Андрей Иванович Ефимов) in 1960 in [[St. Petersburg]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.artslant.com/ew/artists/show/44864-andrey-efi?tab=PROFILE Artslant.com&lt;/ref&gt;) is a well-known Russian [[artist]], [[Painting|painter]] and [[curator]]. He specializes in [[painting]]s, [[mural]]s, and in [[Graphic art|graphic]] and syncretic art,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.artistsites.org/efiandr/&lt;/ref&gt; and has also worked on [[art theory]], [[Film|cinema]], [[literature]], and as a teacher.
In 2004 Andrey Efi belong the Artconcept festival and then it's revived to ARTZOND festival of conceptual and tendentious arts.
A member of the art group Foster Brothers, to which [[Andrei Kolkoutine]] and Eugeny Lindin are also affiliated, Efi is the author of the theoretical work ''PAINTING - CHARACTERS (sources of origination; interrelation)'', published in [[Moscow]] in 1993.

He has since the mid-1990s been producing concept art, completing over 40 projects, including scripts and animated movies such as the four-minute ''Carefree Princess'', whose soundtrack was composed by the American musician Demetrius Spaneas. Other works include ''Crucifixion dedicated to [[Bill Gates]]'' and the installation ''Red Cube'', later reworked as ''White Cube'' and ultimately ''Eternal Cube'', a project that involved 120 litres of [[vodka]]. The installations ''Red Cube'', ''White Cube'', ''Eternal Cube'' are all dedicated to [[Kazimir Malevich]], as it’s started after the idea to revolve all flat squares to volumes. His performances have included "Generation NEXT", "Answer to [[Chernyshevsky]]","Talking Stove", "Ill - Each (dedicated to [[Lenin]])", "Between Past and Future", and others.

Efi's paintings are held at the [[State Russian Museum]] ([[St. Petersburg]]),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.the-art-world.com/artists/ru-efi.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and in private galleries in [[Australia]], the United States, Belgium, Canada, the UK, Germany, Russia, and Switzerland.

'''Art Ludique – The Museum''' is a 1,200m² museum in the [[13th arrondissement of Paris]], [[France]], housed in Les Docks, [[cité de la mode et du design]] and inaugurated on 16 November 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artludique.com/musee2.html |title=Le Musée – Exposition |publisher=Art Ludique |date= |accessdate=2014-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Creation==
Jean-Jacques Launier founded the Arludik gallery, now run by his wife Diane Launier, before organising an exhibition of works by [[Jean Giraud|Moebius]] and [[Hayao Miyazaki|Myazaki]] at the [[Monnaie de Paris]] in 2004, followed by exhibitions on the art of [[Ice Age (2002 film)|Ice Age]] and of [[John Howe (illustrator)|John Howe]] created for [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]. He has also written theoretical studies such as “Art Ludique”, published by Sonatine in 2011, and later decided to found a museum dedicated to contemporary art arising from the entertainment industry.

==Description==
The museum holds several temporary exhibitions each year. A permanent collection is also being prepared, bringing together the most influential figurative narrative artists of the last few centuries, as well as contemporary artists from around the globe working in [[comic books]], [[manga]], cinema, [[Live Animation|live animation]] and [[videogames]] around a shared concept: ‘art ludique&lt;ref&gt;Art Ludique, co-written by Jean-Jacques Launier, Sonatine Editions, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;’. The museum opened with the exhibition “Pixar – 25 years of animation”, created in 2006 by [[Pixar]] and the [[MoMA]], before hosting exhibitions dedicated to [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] Superheroes and to [[Studio Ghibli]]'s productions.

==Exhibitions==
• Pixar – 25 years of animation: Art Ludique – The Museum was inaugurated with the exhibition "Pixar – 25 years of animation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/culture/article/2013/11/20/pixar-fete-ses-25-ans-a-paris_3516837_3246.html |title=Pixar fête ses 25 ans à Paris |publisher=Lemonde.fr |date=2013-11-20 |accessdate=2014-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Co-created by Pixar and the New York Museum of Modern Art in 2006, the exhibition opened in Paris on 16 November 2013 after having visited London, Tokyo, Helsinki and Mexico (amongst others). The exhibition brings together over 500 artworks (drawings, sculptures, storyboards…) and two attractions: the [[Toy Story]] Zootrope created for the exhibition that gives an illusion of movement, and the Artscape, an immersive panoramic animated film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pixar.com/about/The-Exhibition |title=Pixar |publisher=Pixar |date= |accessdate=2014-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition saw over 180,000 visitors.

• The Art of the [[Marvel Comics|Marvel]] Superheroes: this exhibition created for and by the museum opened its doors on 22 March 2014 with 300 pieces of original artwork, featuring the most famous superheroes from the Marvel universe,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mailmovement.com/the-museum-art-ludique-presents-the-exhibition-the-art-of-marvel-superheroes/ |title=The Museum Art Ludique Presents The Exhibition "The Art Of Marvel Superheroes" |publisher=Mail Movement |date=2014-02-11 |accessdate=2014-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as preparatory drawings, storyboards and props from Marvel films such as [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]]’s hammer Mjolnir, [[Iron Man]]’s helmet and [[Captain America]]’s shield,  the original cover art from the first [[Silver Surfer]] comic,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lefigaro.fr/arts-expositions/2014/03/21/03015-20140321ARTFIG00164-les-super-heros-marvel-envahissent-paris-au-musee-art-ludique.php |title=Les super-héros Marvel envahissent Paris au musée Art Ludique |publisher=Lefigaro.fr |date=2014-03-21 |accessdate=2014-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as digital paintings by Ryan Meinerding, artistic supervisor for the majority of Marvel films.

• [[Studio Ghibli]] Layout Design : Understanding the secrets of [[Takahata]] and [[Hayao Miyazaki|Miyazaki]] animation : this exhibition was open from 4 October 2014 to 1 March 2015. It revealed over 1,300 preparatory drawings from the most famous films of the Japanese studio,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lefigaro.fr/arts-expositions/2014/06/11/03015-20140611ARTFIG00316-totoro-la-princesse-mononoke-et-les-yamada-au-musee-art-ludique.php&lt;/ref&gt; among which [[My Neighbor Totoro]], [[Spirited Away]], [[Grave of the Fireflies]] or [[The Wind rises]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.artludique.com/ghibli2.html&lt;/ref&gt;

• Aardman, Art That Takes Shape: the exhibition of the art of [[Aardman Animations]], creators of characters such as [[Morph (character)|Morph]], [[Wallace and Gromit]], [[Shaun the Sheep]], or the stop-motion animation films [[Chicken Run]] or [[The Pirates! In an Adventure with Scientists!]], is open from 21 March to 30 August 2015, presenting original sets from movies and shows, 350 drawings, sculptures, storyboards, film extracts, clips and advertisements.

• The Art in Video Games - French inspiration: the exhibition opened on September 25, 2015. It showcases the work of artists from French video game studios, such as [[Ubisoft]], [[Spiders]], Arkane, Osome, and Swing Swing Submarine, presenting more than 800 artworks: drawings and preparatory sketches, watercolors, sculptures and digital paintings. Emmanuel Ethis, in his contribution to the [[Nouvel Observateur]], says that "a video game is indeed a Total Art, because if it is ludique by nature, it also carries the sovereign ambition of being recorded in a connotated History, rich in correspondences and references to all art forms that preceded it, that we discover thanks to Jean-Jacques Launier, curator of the exhibition dedicated to French inspiration in the Art in the video games."

'''Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre''' ('''AUSTRAC''') is an Australian government [[financial intelligence]] agency set up to monitor financial transactions to identify [[Money laundering#Enforcement|money laundering]], [[organised crime]], [[tax evasion]], [[welfare fraud]] and [[Terrorism in Australia|terrorism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.austrac.gov.au/ar-14-15-austrac-at-a-glance |title=AUSTRAC at a glance |access-date=25 November 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160828034700/http://austrac.gov.au/ar-14-15-austrac-at-a-glance |archive-date=28 August 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; AUSTRAC was established in 1989 under the ''Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comlaw.gov.au/comlaw%5Cmanagement.nsf/lookupindexpagesbyid/IP200403474?OpenDocument Financial Transaction Reports Act 1988], at [[ComLaw]]&lt;/ref&gt; to implement in Australia the recommendations of the [[Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering]] (FATF), which Australia joined in 1990. 

AUSTRAC's existence was continued under the ''Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006'' (Cth) (AML/CTF Act).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/alacfa2006522/ | title=''Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Act 2006'' (Cth)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The AML/CTF Act came into effect on 12 December 2006,&lt;ref name=parlinfo-terror-finance&gt;{{cite web|title=Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorism Financing Bill 2006 |url=http://parlinfo.aph.gov.au/parlInfo/search/display/display.w3p;query=Id:legislation/billhome/R2654|website=parlinfo.aph.gov.au|publisher=Commonwealth of Australia|accessdate=21 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and extended the existing monitoring regime to cover financing of terrorism and listed terrorist organisations. Under Division 103 of the ''Criminal Code Act 1995'' (Cth), it is illegal to finance terrorism.&lt;ref name="Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth)"&gt;[http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2014C00793/Html/Volume_1#_Toc405451547 Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth) s 1.1], Criminal Code Act 1995 (Cth). Retrieved 20 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Attorney-General's Department (Australia)|Attorney-General's Department]] maintains a list of [[Outlawed terror organisations in Australia|outlawed terror organisations]]. In 2014 AUSTRAC released a report, ''Terrorism financing in Australia 2014'', which says, "Terrorism financing poses a serious threat to Australians and Australian interests at home and abroad."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austrac.gov.au/publications/corporate-publications-and-reports/terrorism-financing-australia-2014  |title=Terrorism financing in Australia 2014 |year=2014|work=AUSTRAC|accessdate=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AUSTRAC is a member of the [[Egmont Group of Financial Intelligence Units]] and an observer in the [[Camden Assets Recovery Interagency Network]] and is a member of FATF and the [[Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes]]. 

Certain classes of financial services are required to be reported to AUSTRAC, in particular bank cash transactions (i.e., [[banknote|note]]s and [[coin]]s) of [[Australian dollar|A]]$10,000 or more, as well as suspicious transactions and all international transfers. Reports to AUSTRAC must be made within 10 business days.&lt;ref name=Age030817 /&gt; The information that AUSTRAC collects is available for use by law enforcement, revenue, regulatory, security and other agencies.

== Operation ==
"Reporting entities" are required to report transactions to AUSTRAC. Transactions which must be reported include:

* cash transactions of A$10,000 or more, or foreign currency of that value,
* international funds transfer instructions, either into or out of Australia, of any amount, and
* suspicious transactions of any kind, being transactions the dealer may reasonably suspect of being part of [[tax evasion]] or crime, or might assist in a [[prosecution]].

Australia's [[cash controls]] require travellers to report to AUSTRAC when they carry $10,000 or more (or equivalent in a foreign currency) of cash (or equivalent) into or out of Australia, which can be done on forms available from the [[Australian Border Force|Border Force]] at airports and [[sea port]]s. The Border Force attempts to detect evasion of this requirement. Airlines are not liable for what their passengers carry. Cross-border movement of bearer negotiable instruments of any amount must also be reported if requested by a Border Force or police officer.

It's an offence under the Act for anyone to [[structuring|split a transaction]] into two or more parts with a dominant purpose of avoiding the reporting rules and thresholds.

Certain classes of transactions are exempt, or may be exempted on application. For example, established customers transacting amounts typical of their lawful business, such as for [[payroll]], or retail or [[vending machine]] takings, etc. Motor vehicle traders are specifically not eligible for exemption, as are boats, farm machinery and aircraft traders.

Under the ''[[Freedom of Information Act 1982]]'', any person can access records held by AUSTRAC, subject to certain exemptions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austrac.gov.au/freedom_of_information.html Freedom of Information Guidelines page] at AUSTRAC web site&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|title=''Freedom of information Act 1982'' (Cth)|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/cth/consol_act/foia1982222/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Entities which are required to report transactions to AUSTRAC are called "reporting entities", which are specified in the AML/CTF Act. These entities deal in cash, bullion and financial transactions, and include:

* banks and similar [[financial institution]]s, such as [[building societies]]
* corporations
* [[insurance companies]] and intermediaries
* securities dealers, such as [[brokerage firm|stock broker]]s
* [[unit trust]] managers and trustees (but cash management trusts transacting only by cheque or similar are exempt)
* [[traveler's cheque]] or money order issuers
* cash carriers and [[payroll]] preparation businesses
* [[casino]]s
* [[bookmaker]]s, including [[totalisator]] agencies
* [[bullion]] dealers
* solicitors, acting on their own behalf (e.g., their trust fund, or originated [[Mortgage loan|mortgages]])

== Identification ==
Reporting entities must identify their customers using the [[100-point check]] system.  Accounts may only be opened, but can only be operated (i.e., withdrawals made) by an identified customer; an unidentified customer is blocked from making withdrawals.  Generally identification can be transferred from one account to another, so that for instance a person once identified does not need to produce documents again when opening a second account at the same institution.

For banks and similar reporting entities, identification requirements are determined by a risk-based approach, which may differ for each reporting entity.

It's an offence to open or operate an account with a reporting entity under an [[Pseudonym|alias]] or false name, punishable by a fine or up to 2 years imprisonment.

== Other agencies ==
The information that AUSTRAC collects is also available to a large number of government agencies, including:

* [[Australian Taxation Office]] (ATO)
* State and territory revenue offices
* [[Child Support Agency Australia]] (CSA)
* [[Australian Federal Police]] (AFP), and which may then communicate information to foreign law enforcement agencies, with appropriate undertakings
* [[Law enforcement in Australia#State|State and territory police services]]
* [[Australian Security Intelligence Organisation]] (ASIO)
* [[Australian Crime Commission]]
* [[Australian Securities and Investments Commission]] (ASIC)
* [[Department of Home Affairs (Australia)|Department of Home Affairs]], Australia
* [[Centrelink]] (added in 2004)
* State commissions and royal commissions against corruption –
** [[Crime and Misconduct Commission]], Queensland
** [[Corruption and Crime Commission]], Western Australia (added in 2004)
** [[Independent Commission Against Corruption of New South Wales|Independent Commission Against Corruption]], New South Wales
** [[New South Wales Crime Commission]]
** [[Police Integrity Commission]], New South Wales
* Foreign countries, with appropriate undertakings.

== Enforcement ==
One prominent attempted evasion of the AUSTRAC rules took place ahead of the Dutch takeover of TNT (see [[TNT N.V.]]) in 1999.  [[Simon Hannes]] was an executive at [[Macquarie Bank]], which was advising TNT, and he bought about $90,000 of TNT call options under the name "Mark Booth" to profit when the bid was announced.  He was convicted of [[insider trading]] but also of two offences under the Financial Transactions Reports Act since he had made multiple cash withdrawals and deposits each just under the $10,000 threshold, apparently to avoid that reporting. His sentence for those transactions was 4 months jail.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asic.gov.au/asic/asic_pub.nsf/byheadline/02%2F452+Simon+Hannes+sentenced:+two+and+a+half+years+jail?openDocument ''Simon Hannes sentenced: two and a half years jail'']  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050721142201/http://www.asic.gov.au/asic/asic_pub.nsf/byheadline/02/452%2BSimon%2BHannes%2Bsentenced%3A%2Btwo%2Band%2Ba%2Bhalf%2Byears%2Bjail?openDocument |date=21 July 2005 }}, press release by the [[Australian Securities and Investments Commission]] on 13 December 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/supreme_ct/2002/1182.html R v Hannes (2002)], [[Supreme Court of New South Wales]] report, at [[AustLII]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, an investigation carried out by officers of AUSTRAC and other agencies determined that funds were being sent from Australia for use by the Somalia-based terrorist group, [[Al-Shabaab (militant group)|al-Shabaab]].  Money was remitted, with false names used to obscure the money trail. This investigation lead to the ultimate arrest of the suspects on charges of conspiring to commit a terrorist attack on an [[Holsworthy Barracks terror plot|Australian army base]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.austrac.gov.au/book/export/html/508#Case21|title=Case studies – Remittance services (money transfers): Case 21 – Australian terror suspects sent funds to Somalia to support terrorist group |work=[[AUSTRAC]]|accessdate=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2014, Australian authorities feared that money being transferred from Australia to Somalia could be used for [[Terrorism in Somalia|terrorist purposes]]. In 2015, Australian banks ceased to provide money-transfer facilities to Somalia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-10-17/somali-australians-plead-with-westpac-to-not-close/5822138  |title=Somali Australians plead with Westpac to not close remittance accounts |author=McGrath, Pat|date=17 October 2014|publisher=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]]|accessdate=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/leader/east/westpac-to-stop-somali-money-transfers-on-march-31/story-fngnvlxu-1227281376048  |title=Westpac to stop Somali money transfers on March 31 |author=Armitage, Laura|date=30 March 2015|work=[[Herald Sun]]|accessdate=19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 August 2017, AUSTRAC took action against the [[Commonwealth Bank]] alleging that it did not report cash transactions over $10,000 within the required 10 business day period, or at all. The alleged breach involves over 53,700 transactions over $10,000 through a type of ATM that allowed anonymous cash deposits up to $20,000.&lt;ref name=Age030817&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theage.com.au/business/banking-and-finance/austrac-alleges-cba-in-serious-breach-of-money-laundering-act-20170803-gxoirw.html  |title=Austrac alleges CBA in 'serious' breach of money laundering act |author=Clancy Yeates |date=3 August 2017 |work=The Age |accessdate=19 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''calculus of moving surfaces''' ('''CMS''') &lt;ref&gt;Grinfeld, P. (2010). "Hamiltonian Dynamic Equations for Fluid Films". Studies in Applied Mathematics. {{doi|10.1111/j.1467-9590.2010.00485.x}}. {{ISSN|0022-2526}}.&lt;/ref&gt; is an extension of the classical [[Tensor|tensor calculus]] to deforming [[manifold]]s. Central to the CMS is the Tensorial Time Derivative &lt;math&gt;\dot{\nabla}&lt;/math&gt; whose original definition &lt;ref&gt;J. Hadamard, Lecons Sur La Propagation Des Ondes et Les Equations De
l’Hydrodynamique. Paris: Hermann, 1903.&lt;/ref&gt; was put forth by [[Jacques Hadamard]]. It plays the role analogous to that of the [[covariant derivative]] &lt;math&gt;\nabla _{\alpha }&lt;/math&gt; on [[Differentiable manifold|differential manifolds]]. in that it produces a [[tensor]] when applied to a tensor.

[[File:Hadamard2.jpg|thumb|right|130px|Jacques Salomon Hadamard, French Mathematician, 1865–1963 CE]]

Suppose that &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_t&lt;/math&gt; is the evolution of the [[surface (differential geometry)|surface]] &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; indexed by a time-like parameter &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;. The definitions of the surface [[velocity]] &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; and the [[operator (mathematics)|operator]] &lt;math&gt;\dot{\nabla}&lt;/math&gt; are the [[geometric]] foundations of the CMS. The velocity C is the [[rate (mathematics)|rate]] of deformation of the surface &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; in the instantaneous [[Surface normal|normal]] direction. The value of &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; at a point &lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt; is defined as the [[limit of a function|limit]]

: &lt;math&gt;C=\lim_{h\to 0} \frac{\text{Distance}(P,P^*)}{h}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;P^{*}&lt;/math&gt; is the point on &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_{t+h}&lt;/math&gt; that lies on the straight line perpendicular to &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_{t}&lt;/math&gt; at point P. This definition is illustrated in the first geometric figure below. The velocity &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is a signed quantity: it is positive when &lt;math&gt;\overline{PP^{*}}&lt;/math&gt; points in the direction of the chosen normal, and negative otherwise. The relationship between &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_{t}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; is analogous to the relationship between location and velocity in elementary calculus:&amp;nbsp;knowing either quantity allows one to construct the other by [[Derivative|differentiation]] or [[Initial value problem|integration]].

[[File:C3x3t.png|thumb|350px|Geometric construction of the surface velocity C]]
[[File:DFdt3x3t.png|thumb|350px|Geometric construction of the &lt;math&gt;\delta/\delta t&lt;/math&gt;-derivative of an invariant field F]]

The Tensorial Time Derivative &lt;math&gt;\dot{\nabla}&lt;/math&gt; for a scalar field F defined on &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_{t}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[derivative|rate of change]] in &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; in the instantaneously normal direction:

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{\delta F}{\delta t}=\lim_{h\to 0} \frac{F(P^*)-F(P)}{h}&lt;/math&gt;

This definition is also illustrated in second geometric figure.

The above definitions are ''[[geometry|geometric]]''. In analytical settings, direct application of these definitions may not be possible. The CMS gives ''analytical'' definitions of C and &lt;math&gt;\dot{\nabla}&lt;/math&gt; in terms of elementary operations from [[calculus]] and [[differential geometry]].

==Analytical definitions==

For [[mathematical analysis|analytical]] definitions of &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\dot{\nabla}&lt;/math&gt;, consider the evolution of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; given by

: &lt;math&gt;Z^i = Z^i \left( t ,S \right) &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;Z^{i}&lt;/math&gt; are general [[curvilinear coordinates|curvilinear space coordinates]] and &lt;math&gt;S^{\alpha }&lt;/math&gt; are the surface coordinates. By convention, tensor indices of function arguments are dropped. Thus the above equations contains &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; rather than &lt;math&gt;S^\alpha&lt;/math&gt;.The velocity object &lt;math&gt;\textbf{V}=V^i\textbf{Z}_i&lt;/math&gt; is defined as the [[partial derivative]]

: &lt;math&gt;V^i =\frac{\partial Z^i \left( t ,S \right)}{\partial t }&lt;/math&gt;

The velocity &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; can be computed most directly by the formula

: &lt;math&gt;C=V^i N_i &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;N_i&lt;/math&gt; are the covariant components of the normal vector &lt;math&gt;\vec{N}&lt;/math&gt;.

Also, defining the shift tensor representation of the Surface's Tangent Space &lt;math&gt;Z^{\alpha}_{i}=\textbf{S}^\alpha\cdot\textbf{Z}_i&lt;/math&gt; and the Tangent Velocity as &lt;math&gt;V^\alpha=Z^\alpha_iV^i&lt;/math&gt; , then the definition of the &lt;math&gt;\dot{\nabla}&lt;/math&gt; derivative for an [[Tensor field|invariant]] ''F'' reads

: &lt;math&gt;\dot{\nabla}F=\frac{\partial F\left( t ,S \right)}{\partial t }-V^\alpha\nabla _{\alpha }F&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\nabla_\alpha &lt;/math&gt; is the covariant derivative on S.

For ''tensors'', an appropriate generalization is needed. The proper definition for a representative tensor &lt;math&gt;T^{i\alpha }_{j\beta }&lt;/math&gt; reads

: &lt;math&gt;\dot{\nabla}T^{i\alpha }_{j\beta }=\frac{\partial T^{i\alpha }_{j\beta }}{\partial t}-V^{\eta }\nabla _{\eta }T^{i\alpha }_{j\beta }+V^{m}\Gamma ^{i}_{mk}T^{k\alpha }_{j\beta }-V^{m}\Gamma ^{k}_{mj}T^{i\alpha }_{k\beta }+\dot{\Gamma}^\alpha_\eta T^{i\eta }_{j\beta }-\dot{\Gamma}^\eta_\beta T^{i\alpha }_{j\eta }&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\Gamma^k_{mj}&lt;/math&gt; are [[Christoffel symbols]] and &lt;math&gt;\dot{\Gamma}^\alpha_\beta=\nabla_\beta V^\alpha-C B^\alpha_\beta&lt;/math&gt; is the surface's appropriate temporal symbols (&lt;math&gt;B^\alpha_\beta&lt;/math&gt; is a matrix representation of the surface's curvature shape operator)

==Properties of the ''δ''/''δt''-derivative==

The &lt;math&gt;\dot{\nabla}&lt;/math&gt;-derivative commutes with contraction, satisfies the [[product rule]] for any collection of indices

: &lt;math&gt;\dot{\nabla}(S^i_\alpha T^\beta_j
 )=T^\beta_j\dot{\nabla}S^i_\alpha + S^i_\alpha\dot{\nabla}T^\beta_j&lt;/math&gt;

and obeys a [[chain rule]] for surface [[Function (mathematics)#Restrictions and extensions|restrictions]] of spatial tensors:

: &lt;math&gt;\dot{\nabla}F^j_k(Z,t) =\frac{\partial F^j_k}{\partial t}+CN^i \nabla _i F^j_k&lt;/math&gt;

Chain rule shows that the &lt;math&gt;\delta /\delta t&lt;/math&gt;-derivative of spatial "metrics"
vanishes

: &lt;math&gt;\dot{\nabla}\delta^i_j=0,\dot{\nabla}Z_{ij}=0,\dot{\nabla}Z^{ij}=0,\dot{\nabla}\varepsilon _{ijk}=0,\dot{\nabla}\varepsilon^{ijk}=0&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;Z_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Z^{ij}&lt;/math&gt; are covariant and contravariant [[metric tensor]]s, &lt;math&gt;\delta ^{i}_{j}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Kronecker delta]] symbol,  and &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon _{ijk}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon ^{ijk}&lt;/math&gt; are the [[Levi-Civita symbol]]s. The [[Levi-Civita symbol|main article]] on Levi-Civita symbols describes them for [[Cartesian coordinate systems]]. The preceding rule is valid in general coordinates, where the definition of the Levi-Civita symbols must include the square root of the [[determinant]] of the covariant metric tensor &lt;math&gt;Z_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Differentiation table for the δ/δt-derivative==

The &lt;math&gt;\dot{\nabla}&lt;/math&gt; derivative of the key surface objects leads to highly concise and attractive formulas. When applied to the [[covariance and contravariance of vectors|covariant]] surface [[metric tensor]] &lt;math&gt;S_{\alpha \beta }&lt;/math&gt; and the [[Covariance and contravariance of vectors|contravariant]] metric tensor &lt;math&gt;S^{\alpha \beta }&lt;/math&gt;, the following identities result

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\dot{\nabla}S_{\alpha \beta } &amp;=0 \\[8pt]
\dot{\nabla}S^{\alpha \beta } &amp;=0
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;B_{\alpha \beta }&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B^{\alpha \beta }&lt;/math&gt; are the doubly covariant and doubly contravariant [[Sectional curvature|curvature tensors]]. These curvature tensors, as well as for the mixed curvature tensor &lt;math&gt;B^\alpha_\beta&lt;/math&gt;, satisfy

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\dot{\nabla}B_{\alpha \beta }&amp; = \nabla_\alpha \nabla_\beta C + CB_{\alpha \gamma }B^\gamma_\beta \\[8pt]
\dot{\nabla}B^\alpha_\beta&amp; = \nabla_\beta\nabla^\alpha C + CB^\alpha_\gamma B^\gamma_\beta \\[8pt]
\dot{\nabla}B^{\alpha \beta }&amp; = \nabla ^\alpha \nabla^\beta C + CB^{\gamma \alpha}B^\beta_\gamma
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The shift tensor &lt;math&gt;Z^i_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and the normal&lt;math&gt;N^i&lt;/math&gt; satisfy

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\dot{\nabla}Z^i_\alpha &amp; = N^i\nabla _\alpha C \\[8pt]
\dot{\nabla}N^i &amp; = -Z^i_\alpha \nabla^\alpha C
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Finally, the surface [[Levi-Civita symbol]]s &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon _{\alpha \beta }&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon ^{\alpha \beta }&lt;/math&gt; satisfy

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\frac{\delta \varepsilon _{\alpha \beta }}{\delta t} &amp; = -\varepsilon _{\alpha \beta }CB^{\gamma }_{\gamma } \\[8pt]
\frac{\delta \varepsilon ^{\alpha \beta }}{\delta t} &amp; = \varepsilon ^{\alpha \beta }CB^\gamma_\gamma
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

{{The Works of Aristotle}}

The '''''Categories''''' ([[Ancient Greek|Greek]] Κατηγορίαι ''Katēgoriai''; [[Latin]] ''Categoriae'') is a text from [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Organon]]'' that enumerates all the possible kinds of things that can be the [[subject (grammar)|subject]] or the [[Predicate (grammar)|predicate]] of a [[proposition]].  They are "perhaps the single most heavily discussed of all Aristotelian notions".&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Robin 1995 "Logic". In J. Barnes (ed) ''The Cambridge companion to Aristotle'', Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; The work is brief enough to be divided, not into books as is usual with [[Corpus Aristotelicum|Aristotle's works]], but into fifteen chapters.

The ''Categories'' places every [[Object (philosophy)|object]] of human [[apprehension (understanding)|apprehension]] under one of ten categories (known to medieval writers as the Latin term '''''praedicamenta''''').  Aristotle intended them to enumerate everything that can be expressed without composition or structure, thus anything that can be either the subject or the predicate of a proposition.

==The text==

===The antepraedicamenta===
The text begins with an explication of what is meant by "[[synonym]]ous," or [[Wiktionary:univocal|univocal]] words, what is meant by "[[homonym]]ous," or [[Wiktionary:equivocal|equivocal]] words, and what is meant by "[[paronym]]ous," or [[Wiktionary:denominative|denominative]] (sometimes translated "derivative") words.

It then divides forms of speech as being:
* Either simple, without composition or structure, such as "man," "horse," "fights," etc.
* Or having composition and structure, such as "a man fights," "the horse runs," etc.
Only composite forms of speech can be true or false.

Next, he distinguishes between what is said "of" a subject and what is "in" a subject.  What is said "of" a subject describes the kind of thing that it is as a whole, answering the question "what is it?"  What is said to be "in" a subject is a predicate that does not describe it as a whole but cannot exist without the subject, such as the shape of something.  The latter has come to be known as [[inherence]].

Of all the things that exist, 
# Some may be predicated (that is, said) of a subject, but are in no subject; as ''man'' may be predicated of James or John (one may say "John is a man"), but is not in any subject.
# Some are in a subject, but cannot be predicated of any subject. Thus a certain individual point of grammatical knowledge is in me as in a subject, but it cannot be predicated of any subject; because it is an individual thing.
# Some are both in a subject and able to be predicated of a subject, for example [[science]], which is in the mind as in a subject, and may be predicated of [[geometry]] as of a subject ("Geometry is science").
# Last, some things neither can be in any subject nor can be predicated of any subject. These are ''individual substances'', which cannot be predicated, because they are individuals; and cannot be in a subject, because they are substances.

===The praedicamenta===
Then we come to the [[category of being|categories]] themselves, whose definitions depend upon these four forms of predication.&lt;ref&gt;The forms of predication were called by the medieval [[Scholasticism|scholastic philosophers]] the ''[[antepraedicamenta]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Note, however, that although Aristotle has apparently distinguished between “being in a subject”, and “being predicated truly of a subject”, in the ''[[Prior Analytics]]'' these are treated as synonymous. This has led some to suspect that Aristotle was not the author of the ''Categories''{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle's own text in Ackrill's standard English version is:&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Aristotle|1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Oxford Translation is universally recognized as the standard English version of Aristotle. See the [http://press.princeton.edu/titles/5967.html publisher’s blurb]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Of things said without any combination, each signifies either '''substance''' or '''quantity''' or '''qualification''' or a '''relative''' or '''where''' or '''when''' or '''being-in-a-position''' or '''having''' or '''doing''' or '''being-affected'''. To give a rough idea, examples of '''substance''' are man, horse; of '''quantity''': four-foot, five-foot; of '''qualification''': white, grammatical; of a '''relative''': double, half, larger; of '''where''': in the Lyceum, in the market-place; of '''when''': yesterday, last-year; of '''being-in-a-position''': is-lying, is-sitting; '''of having''': has-shoes-on, has-armour-on; '''of doing''': cutting, burning; of '''being-affected''': being-cut, being-burned. ([[Bekker numbers|1b25-2a4]])
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A brief explanation (with some alternative translations) is as follows:
# '''[[Substance theory|Substance]]''' ({{lang|grc|οὐσία}}, ''ousia'', essence or substance).&lt;ref&gt;Note that while Aristotle's use of ''&lt;span lang=el&gt;ousia'' is ambiguous between 'essence' and substance' there is a close link between them. See his [[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|''Metaphysics'']]&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Substance'' is that which cannot be predicated of anything or be said to be in anything. Hence, ''this particular man'' or ''that particular tree'' are substances. Later in the text, Aristotle calls these particulars “primary substances”, to distinguish them from ''secondary substances'', which are universals and ''can'' be predicated. Hence, Socrates is a primary substance, while man is a secondary substance. ''Man'' is predicated of Socrates, and therefore all that is predicated of man is predicated of Socrates.
# '''[[Quantity]]''' ({{lang|grc|ποσόν}}, ''poson'', how much). This is the extension of an object, and may be either [[wiktionary:Discrete|discrete]] or [[wiktionary:Continuous|continuous]].  Further, its parts may or may not have relative positions to each other. All medieval discussions about the nature of the continuum, of the infinite and the infinitely divisible, are a long footnote to this text.  It is of great importance in the development of mathematical ideas in the medieval and late Scholastic period. Examples: two cubits long, number, space, (length of) time.
# '''Qualification''' or [[Quality (philosophy)|quality]] ({{lang|grc|ποιόν}}, ''poion'', of what kind or quality). This determination characterizes the nature of an object. Examples: white, black, grammatical, hot, sweet, curved, straight.
# '''Relative''' ({{lang|grc|πρός τι}}, ''pros ti'', toward something). This is the way one object may be related to another. Examples: double, half, large, master, knowledge.
# '''Where''' or [[Space|place]] ({{lang|grc|ποῦ}}, ''pou'', where). Position in relation to the surrounding environment. Examples: in a marketplace, in the Lyceum.
# '''When''' or [[time]] ({{lang|grc|πότε}}, ''pote'', when). Position in relation to the course of events. Examples: yesterday, last year.
# '''[[Human position|Being-in-a-position]]''', posture, attitude ({{lang|grc|κεῖσθαι}}, ''keisthai'', to lie). The examples Aristotle gives indicate that he meant a condition of rest resulting from an action: ''‘Lying’, ‘sitting’, ‘standing’.'' Thus ''position'' may be taken as the end point for the corresponding action. The term is, however, frequently taken to mean the relative position of the parts of an object (usually a living object), given that the position of the parts is inseparable from the state of rest implied.
# '''Having''' or state, [[Condition (philosophy)|condition]] ({{lang|grc|ἔχειν}}, ''echein'', to have or be). The examples Aristotle gives indicate that he meant a condition of rest resulting from an affection (i.e. being acted on): ''‘shod’, ‘armed’.'' The term is, however, frequently taken to mean the determination arising from the physical accoutrements of an object: one's shoes, one's arms, etc. Traditionally, this category is also called a ''habitus'' (from Latin ''habere'', to have).
# '''Doing''' or [[Action (philosophy)|action]] ({{lang|grc|ποιεῖν}}, ''poiein'', to make or do). The production of change in some other object (or in the agent itself ''qua'' other).
# '''Being affected''' or [[Affection (philosophy)|affection]] ({{lang|grc|πάσχειν}}, ''paschein'', to suffer or undergo). The reception of change from some other object (or from the affected object itself ''qua'' other). Aristotle's name ''paschein'' for this category has traditionally been translated into English as "affection" and "passion" (also "passivity"), easily misinterpreted to refer only or mainly to [[affection|affection as an emotion]] or to [[passion (emotion)|emotional passion]].  For action he gave the example, ''‘to lance’, ‘to cauterize’;'' for affection, ''‘to be lanced’, ‘to be cauterized.’'' His examples make clear that action is to affection as the active voice is to the passive voice — as ''acting'' is to ''being acted on''.

The first four are given a detailed treatment in four chapters, doing and being-affected are discussed briefly in a single small chapter, the remaining four are passed over lightly, as being clear in themselves.  Later texts by scholastic philosophers also reflect this disparity of treatment{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}}.

===The postpraedicamenta===
In this part,&lt;ref&gt;This part was probably not part of the original text, but added by some unknown editor, {{Harvtxt|Ackrill|1963}} pp. 69—70&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle sets forth four ways things can be said to be opposed. Next, the work discusses five senses wherein a thing may be considered ''prior'' to another, followed by a short section on simultaneity. Six forms of movement are then defined: generation, destruction, increase, diminution, alteration, and change of place. The work ends with a brief consideration of the word 'have' and its usage.

In [[psychology]], '''cognitivism''' is a theoretical framework for understanding the mind that gained credence in the 1950s. The movement was a response to [[behaviorism]], which cognitivists said neglected to explain [[cognition]]. [[Cognitive psychology]] derived its name from the Latin ''cognoscere'', referring to knowing and information, thus cognitive psychology is an information-processing psychology derived in part from earlier traditions of the investigation of thought and problem solving.&lt;ref&gt;Mandler, G. (2002). Origins of the cognitive (r)evolution. Journal of the History of the Behavioral Sciences, 38, 339-353&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lilien-1&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Behaviorists acknowledged the existence of thinking, but identified it as a behavior. Cognitivists  argued that the way people think impacts their behavior and therefore cannot be a behavior in and of itself. Cognitivists later argued that thinking is so essential to psychology that the study of thinking should become its own field.&lt;ref name=Lilien-1 /&gt; However, cognitivists typically presuppose a specific form of mental activity, of the kind advanced by [[computationalism]].

== Cognitive development ==


The process of assimilating and expanding our intellectual horizon is termed as [[cognitive]] development. We have a complex [[physiological]] structure that absorbs a variety of [[Stimulus (physiology)|stimuli]] from the [[environment (systems)|environment]], stimuli being the interactions which are able to produce [[knowledge]] and skills. Parents   process   knowledge   informally   in   the home while teachers process knowledge formally in school. [[Knowledge]] should be pursued with zest and zeal; if not, then learning becomes a burden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=General Psychology|publisher=Neelkamal|page=60|edition=First edition, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Attention ==


Attention is the first part of cognitive development. Learning takes place when the student gives attention towards the teacher. Interest and effort closely relate to attention. Attention is an active process which involves numerous outside stimuli.  The attention of an organism at any point in time involves three concentric circles; beyond awareness, margin, and focus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=General Psychology|publisher=Neelkamal|page=59|edition=First edition, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== How does learning occur? ==


[[Cognitive]] theory mainly stresses the acquisition of [[knowledge]] and growth of the mental structure. [[Cognitive]] theory tends to focus on conceptualizing the student's [[learning]] process: how information is received; how information is processed and organized into existing schema; how information is retrieved upon recall. In other words, cognitive theory seeks to explain the process of [[knowledge]] acquisition and the subsequent effects on the mental structures within the mind. Learning is not about the mechanics of what a learner does, but rather a process depending on what the learner already knows (existing information) and their method of acquiring new [[knowledge]] (how they integrate new information into their existing schemas). Knowledge acquisition is an activity consisting of internal codification of mental structures within the student's mind. Inherent to the theory, the student must be an active participant in their own learning process. Cognitive approaches mainly focus on the mental activities of the learner like mental planning, goal setting, and organizational strategies (Shell, 1980).
In [[cognitive]] theories not only the environmental factors and instructional components play an important role in learning. There are additional key elements like learning to code, transform, rehearse, and store and retrieve the information. Learning process includes learner’s thoughts, beliefs, and attitude values(Winna, 1988).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Psychology|url=http://northweststate.edu/wp-content/uploads/files/21143_ftp.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== What is the role of memory? ==


[[Memory]] plays a vital role in the [[learning]] process. Information is stored within memory in an organised, meaningful manner. Here, teacher and designers play different roles in the [[learning]] process. Teachers supposedly facilitate learning and the organization of information in an optimal way. Whereas designers supposedly use advanced techniques (such as analogies and hierarchical relationships) to help learners acquire new information to add to their prior [[knowledge]]. Forgetting is described as an inability to retrieve information from memory. [[Memory]] loss may be a mechanism used to discard situationally irrelevant information by assessing the relevance of newly acquired information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Teaching Cognitivism|url=http://teachinglearningresources.pbworks.com/w/page/31012664/Cognitivism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== How does transfer occur? ==


According to [[cognitive]] theory, if a learner knows how to implement [[knowledge]] in different contexts and conditions then we can say that transfer has occurred. (Schunk, 1991) Understanding is composed of knowledge - in the form of rules, concepts and discrimination (Duffy and Jonassen, 1991). Knowledge stored in [[memory]] is important, but the use of such knowledge is also important. Prior knowledge will be used for identifying similarities and differences between itself and novel [[information]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Learning Theories|url=http://www.learning-theories.com/cognitivism.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== What types of learning are explained in detail by this position? ==


Cognitive theory mostly explains complex forms of learning in terms of reasoning, problem solving and information processing (Schunk, 1991). Emphasis must be placed on the fact that the goal of all aforementioned viewpoints is considered to be the same - the transfer of knowledge to the student in the most efficient and effective manner possible (Bednar et al., 1991). Simplification and standardization are two techniques used to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of knowledge transfer. Knowledge can be analysed, decomposed and simplified into basic building blocks. There is a correlation with the behaviorist model of the knowledge transfer environment. Cognitivists stress the importance of efficient processing strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Teaching and Learning Cognitivism|url=http://teachinglearningresources.pbworks.com/w/page/31012664/Cognitivism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== What are the basic assumptions/ principles of the cognitive theory or relevant to instructional design? ==


A behaviorist uses feedback (reinforcement) to change the behavior in the desired direction, while the cognitivist uses the feedback for guiding and supporting the accurate [[mind|mental]] connections (Thomson, Simon son. &amp; Hargrave, 1992).
For different reasons learners' task analyzers are critical to both cognitivists and behaviorists. Cognitivists look at the learner's predisposition to learning (How does the learner activate, maintain and direct his/her learning?) (Thompson et . al., 1992). Additionally, cognitivists examine the learner's 'how to design' [[Teaching|instruction]] that it can be assimilated. (i. e ., what about the learners existing mental structures?) In contrast, the behaviorists look at learners how to determine where the lesson should begin (i. e., At what level the learners are performing successfully?) and what are the most effective reinforcements (i.e., What are the consequences that are most desired by the learner?).

There are some specific assumptions or principles that direct the instructional design:  active involvement of the learner in the learning process, learner control, meta cognitive training (e.g., self-planning, monitoring and revising techniques), the use of hierarchical analyses to identify and illustrate prerequisite relationships (cognitive task analysis procedure), facilitating optimal processing of structuring, organizing and sequencing information (use of cognitive strategies such as outlining, summaries, synthesizers, advance organizers etc.), encouraging the students to make connections with previously learned material, and creating [[learning]] environments (recall of prerequisite skills; use of relevant examples, analogies).

== How should instruction be structured? ==


[[Cognitive]] theories emphasize mainly on making [[knowledge]] meaningful and helping learners to organizing relate new [[information]] to existing [[knowledge]] in [[memory]] . Instruction should be   based on students existing schema or mental structures, to be effective. The organisation of information is connected in such a manner that it should relate to the existing knowledge in some   meaningful way. The examples of [[cognitive]] strategy are   Analogies metaphors. The other   cognitive strategies includes the use of framing, outlining the mnemonics, concept mapping, advance organizers and so forth ( West, Farmer, and Wolff,1991). The cognitive theory mainly emphasizes the major tasks of the teacher / designer and includes analyzing that various learning experiences to the learning situation which can impact learning outcomes of different individuals.
Organizing and structuring the new information to connect the learners previously acquired knowledge abilities and experiences.
The new information is effectively and efficiently assimilated/accommodated within the learners cognitive structure (Stepich and Newby, 1988 ).

==Theoretical approach==

Cognitivism has two major components, one methodological, the other theoretical. Methodologically, cognitivism adopts a [[positivist]] approach and the belief that psychology can be (in principle) fully explained by the use of the [[scientific method]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} This is also largely a [[reductionist]] goal, with the belief that individual components of mental function (the 'cognitive architecture') can be identified and meaningfully understood.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} The second is the belief that [[cognition]] consists of discrete, internal mental states ([[representations]] or [[symbols]]) whose manipulation can be described in terms of rules or [[algorithm]]s.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}.

Cognitivism became the dominant force in [[psychology]] in the late-20th century, replacing [[behaviorism]] as the most popular paradigm for understanding mental function. [[Cognitive psychology]] is not a wholesale refutation of behaviorism, but rather an expansion that accepts that mental states exist.  This was due to the increasing criticism towards the end of the 1950s of simplistic learning models. One of the most notable criticisms was [[Noam Chomsky|Chomsky's]] argument that language could not be acquired purely through conditioning, and must be at least partly explained by the existence of internal mental states.

The main issues that interest cognitive psychologists are the inner mechanisms of human thought and the processes of knowing. Cognitive psychologists have attempted to shed some light on the alleged mental structures that stand in a causal relationship to our physical actions.

==Criticisms of psychological cognitivism==

In the 1990s, various new theories emerged and challenged cognitivism and the idea that thought was best described as computation. Some of these new approaches, often influenced by phenomenological and [[postmodern philosophy]], include [[situated cognition]], [[distributed cognition]], [[dynamicism]], [[embodied cognition]]. Some thinkers working in the field of [[artificial life]] (for example [[Rodney Brooks]]) have also produced non-cognitivist models of cognition. On the other hand, much of early cognitive psychology, and the work of many currently active cognitive psychologists does not treat cognitive processes as computational.
The idea that mental functions can be described as information processing models has been criticised by [[philosopher]] [[John Searle]] and [[mathematician]] [[Roger Penrose]] who both argue that computation has some inherent shortcomings which cannot capture the fundamentals of mental processes. 
* Penrose uses [[Kurt Gödel|Gödel's]] [[Gödel's incompleteness theorem|incompleteness theorem]] (which states that there are mathematical truths which can never be proven in a sufficiently strong mathematical system; any sufficiently strong system of axioms will also be incomplete) and [[Alan Turing|Turing's]] [[halting problem]] (which states that there are some things which are inherently non-computable) as evidence for his position.
* Searle has developed two arguments, the first (well known through his [[Chinese room]] [[thought experiment]]) is the '[[syntax]] is not [[semantics]]' argument—that a program is just syntax, while understanding requires semantics; therefore programs (hence cognitivism) cannot explain understanding. Such an argument presupposes the controversial notion of a [[private language]]. The second, which Searle now prefers but is less well known, is his 'syntax is not physics' argument—nothing in the world is intrinsically a computer program except as applied, described or interpreted by an observer, so either everything can be described as a computer and trivially a brain can but then this does not explain any specific mental processes, or there is nothing intrinsic in a brain that makes it a computer (program). Detractors of this argument might point out that the same thing could be said about any concept-object relation, and that the brain-computer analogy can be a perfectly useful model if there is a strong [[isomorphism]] between the two. {{Citation needed|date=March 2013}} Both points, Searle claims, refute cognitivism.

Another argument against cognitivism is the problems of [[Ryle's Regress]] or the [[homunculus fallacy]].  Cognitivists have offered a number of arguments attempting to refute these attacks.{{Clarify|date=April 2013}}

'''Conjunct consonants''' are a type of letters, used for example in [[Brahmi script|Brahmi]] or modern [[Devanagari]], to write [[consonant cluster]]s such as {{IPA|/pr/}} or {{IPA|/rv/}}. Although most of the time, letters are formed by using a simple consonant with the inherent value vowel "a" (as with "k" [[File:Brahmi k.svg|12px]], pronounced "ka" in Brahmi), or by combining a consonant with an vowel in the form of an [[diacritic]] (as with "ki" [[File:Brahmi letter Ki.svg|12px]] in Brahmi), the usage of conjunct consonant permits the creation of more sophisticated sounds (as with "kya" [[File:Brahmi Kya.jpg|12px]], formed with the consonants k [[File:Brahmi k.svg|10px]] and y [[File:Brahmi y.svg|10px]] assembled verticaly).&lt;ref name=MC/&gt; Conjuncts are often used with loan words. Native words typically use the basic consonant and native speakers know to suppress the vowel.

In modern Devanagari the components of a conjunct are written left to right when possible (when the first consonant has a vertical stem that can be removed at the right), whereas in Brahmi characters are joined vertically downwards.&lt;ref name=MC&gt;{{cite book |last1=Shapiro |first1=Michael C. |title=A Primer of Modern Standard Hindi |date=1989 |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publ. |isbn=9788120805088 |page=23 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vvuP8sD1wloC&amp;pg=PA23 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some simple examples of conjunct consonants in Devanagari are: त + व = त्व tva, ण + ढ = ण्ढ ṇḍha, स + थ = स्थ stha, where the vertical stroke of the first letter is simply lost in the combination. Sometimes, conjunct consonants are not clearly derived from the letters making up their components: the conjunct for kṣ is क्ष (क् + ष) and for jñ it is ज्ञ (ज् + ञ). 

Conjunct consonants are used in many other scripts as well, usually derived from the Brahmi script.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Tuṅga |first1=Sudhāṃśu Śekhara |title=Bengali and Other Related Dialects of South Assam |date=1995 |publisher=Mittal Publications |isbn=9788170995883 |page=163 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lRRYBHQvXdsC&amp;pg=PA163 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Balinese script|Balinese]], conjunct consonants are called ''Haksara Wrehastra''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Shadeg |first1=Norbert |title=Tuttle Balinese-English Dictionary |date=2014 |publisher=Tuttle Publishing |isbn=9781462910786 |page=11 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=20ktBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA11 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''nat_ind'' stands for [[mathematical induction]], ''eq_ind'' for substitution of equals and ''f_equal'' for taking the same function on both sides of the equality.  Earlier theorems are referenced showing ''m''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''m''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;0 and S&amp;nbsp;(''m''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''y'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''m''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;S&amp;nbsp;''y''.]]

In [[programming language theory]] and [[proof theory]], the '''Curry–Howard correspondence''' (also known as the '''Curry–Howard isomorphism''' or '''equivalence''', or the '''proofs-as-programs''' and '''propositions-''' or '''formulae-as-types interpretation''') is the direct relationship between [[computer program]]s and [[mathematical proof]]s. 

It is a generalization of a syntactic [[analogy]] between systems of formal logic and computational calculi that was first discovered by the American [[mathematician]] [[Haskell Curry]] and [[logician]] [[William Alvin Howard]].&lt;ref&gt;The correspondence was first made explicit in {{harvnb|Howard |1980}}. See, for example section 4.6, p.53 [http://www.ps.uni-saarland.de/courses/sem-ws07/notes/0.pdf Gert Smolka and Jan Schwinghammer (2007-8), Lecture Notes in Semantics]&lt;/ref&gt; It is the link between logic and computation that is usually attributed to Curry and Howard, although the idea is related to the operational interpretation of [[intuitionistic logic]] given in various formulations by  [[L. E. J. Brouwer]], [[Arend Heyting]] and [[Andrey Kolmogorov]] (see [[Brouwer–Heyting–Kolmogorov interpretation]])&lt;ref&gt;The Brouwer–Heyting–Kolmogorov interpretation  is also called the 'proof interpretation': p. 161 of Juliette Kennedy, Roman Kossak, eds. 2011. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=x1aPcJnz4iYC&amp;pg=PA161&amp;dq=Brouwer%E2%80%93Heyting%E2%80%93Kolmogorov+interpretation&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=CbdRVPvyB6-_iQL--YG4AQ&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Brouwer%E2%80%93Heyting%E2%80%93Kolmogorov%20interpretation&amp;f=false Set Theory, Arithmetic, and Foundations of Mathematics: Theorems, Philosophies]'' {{ISBN|978-1-107-00804-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Stephen Kleene]] (see [[Realizability]]). The relationship has been extended to include [[category theory]] as the three-way '''Curry–Howard–Lambek correspondence'''.

== Origin, scope, and consequences == &lt;!--This heading is used in other articles. Please update the links in the other articles if the heading name is changed. --&gt;

The beginnings of the '''Curry–Howard correspondence''' lie in several observations:
# In 1934 [[Haskell Curry|Curry]] observes that the [[typed lambda calculus|type]]s of the combinators could be seen as [[axiom-scheme]]s for [[intuitionism|intuitionistic]] implicational logic.{{sfn|Curry|1934}}
# In 1958 he observes that a certain kind of [[proof calculus|proof system]], referred to as [[Hilbert-style deduction system]]s, coincides on some fragment to the typed fragment of a standard [[model of computation]] known as [[combinatory logic]].{{sfn|Curry|Feys|1958}}
# In 1969 [[William Alvin Howard|Howard]] observes that another, more "high-level" [[proof calculus|proof system]], referred to as [[natural deduction]], can be directly interpreted in its [[intuitionistic]] version as a typed variant of the [[model of computation]] known as [[lambda calculus]].{{sfn|Howard|1980}}

In other words, the Curry–Howard correspondence is the observation that two families of seemingly unrelated formalisms—namely, the proof systems on one hand, and the models of computation on the other—are in fact the same kind of mathematical objects.

If one abstracts on the peculiarities of either formalism, the following generalization arises: ''a proof is a program, and the formula it proves is the type for the program''.  More informally, this can be seen as an [[analogy]] that states that the [[return type]] of a function (i.e., the type of values returned by a function) is analogous to a logical theorem, subject to hypotheses corresponding to the types of the argument values passed to the function; and that the program to compute that function is analogous to a proof of that theorem.  This sets a form of [[logic programming]] on a rigorous foundation: ''proofs can be represented as programs, and especially as lambda terms'', or ''proofs can be '''run'''''.

The correspondence has been the starting point of a large spectrum of new research after its discovery, leading in particular to a new class of [[formal system]]s designed to act both as a [[proof calculus|proof system]] and as a typed [[functional programming language]]. This includes [[Martin-Löf]]'s [[intuitionistic type theory]] and [[Thierry Coquand|Coquand]]'s [[Calculus of Constructions]], two calculi in which proofs are regular objects of the discourse and in which one can state properties of proofs the same way as of any program. This field of research is usually referred to as modern [[type theory]].

Such [[typed lambda calculus|typed lambda calculi]] derived from the Curry–Howard paradigm led to software like [[Coq]] in which proofs seen as programs can be formalized, checked, and run.

A converse direction is to ''use a program to extract a proof'', given its [[program correctness|correctness]]—an area of research closely related to [[proof-carrying code]].  This is only feasible if the [[programming language]] the program is written for is very richly typed:  the development of such type systems has been partly motivated by the wish to make the Curry–Howard correspondence practically relevant.

The Curry–Howard correspondence also raised new questions regarding the computational content of proof concepts that were not covered by the original works of Curry and Howard. In particular, [[classical logic]] has been shown to correspond to the ability to manipulate the [[continuation]] of programs and the symmetry of [[sequent calculus]] to express the duality between the two [[evaluation strategy|evaluation strategies]] known as call-by-name and call-by-value.

Speculatively, the Curry–Howard correspondence might be expected to lead to a substantial [[unifying theories in mathematics|unification]] between mathematical logic and foundational computer science:

Hilbert-style logic and natural deduction are but two kinds of proof systems among a large family of formalisms. Alternative syntaxes include [[sequent calculus]], [[proof net]]s, [[calculus of structures]], etc. If one admits the Curry–Howard correspondence as the general principle that any proof system hides a model of computation, a theory of the underlying untyped computational structure of these kinds of proof system should be possible. Then, a natural question is whether something mathematically interesting can be said about these underlying computational calculi.

Conversely, [[combinatory logic]] and [[simply typed lambda calculus]] are not the only [[models of computation]], either.  Girard's [[linear logic]] was developed from the fine analysis of the use of resources in some models of lambda calculus; is there typed version of [[Turing machine|Turing's machine]] that would behave as a proof system? [[Typed assembly language]]s are such an instance of "low-level" models of computation that carry types.

Because of the possibility of writing non-terminating programs, [[Turing-complete]] models of computation (such as languages with arbitrary [[Recursion (computer science)|recursive functions]]) must be interpreted with care, as naive application of the correspondence leads to an inconsistent logic.  The best way of dealing with arbitrary computation from a logical point of view is still an actively debated research question, but one popular approach is based on using [[Monad (functional programming)|monads]] to segregate provably terminating from potentially non-terminating code (an approach that also generalizes to much richer models of computation,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|first=Eugenio|last=Moggi|year=1991|title=Notions of Computation and Monads|journal=Information and Computation|volume=93|issue=1|url=http://www.disi.unige.it/person/MoggiE/ftp/ic91.pdf|doi=10.1016/0890-5401(91)90052-4|pages=55–92}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is itself related to modal logic by a natural extension of the Curry–Howard isomorphism&lt;ref name=PfenningDaviesJudgmental group=ext/&gt;).  A more radical approach, advocated by [[total functional programming]], is to eliminate unrestricted recursion (and forgo [[Turing completeness]], although still retaining high computational complexity), using more controlled [[corecursion]] wherever non-terminating behavior is actually desired.

==General formulation==
In its more general formulation, the Curry–Howard correspondence is a correspondence between formal [[proof calculus|proof calculi]] and [[type systems]] for [[model of computation|models of computation]]. In particular, it splits into two correspondences. One at the level of [[formula (mathematical logic)|formulas]] and [[data type|types]] that is independent of which particular proof system or model of computation is considered, and one at the level of [[mathematical proof|proofs]] and [[computer program|programs]] which, this time, is specific to the particular choice of proof system and model of computation considered.

At the level of formulas and types, the correspondence says that implication behaves the same as a function type, conjunction as a "product" type (this may be called a tuple, a struct, a list, or some other term depending on the language), disjunction as a sum type (this type may be called a union), the false formula as the empty type and the true formula as the singleton type (whose sole member is the null object). Quantifiers correspond to [[dependent type|dependent]] function space or products (as appropriate). 
&lt;!-- If quantification comes in two flavors, it is because there are two ways to think about the Curry–Howard correspondence. If one considers that every single proof step has to be computational, then [[universal quantification]] is interpreted as dependent product and [[existential quantification]] as a dependent sum (this corresponds to interpreting a proof as a term typed  [[simply typed lambda calculus|à la Church]]). If otherwise one considers that some trivial computational step can be omitted, then universal quantification is interpreted as a dependent [[Type_system#Intersection_types|intersection type]] and existential quantification as a dependent [[Type_system#Union_types|union type]] (this corresponds to interpreting a proof as a term typed [[simply typed lambda calculus|à la Curry]], which was actually the approach taken by Howard). --&gt; 
This is summarized in the following table:

{| class="wikitable" style="margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"

|}

At the level of proof systems and models of computations, the correspondence mainly shows the identity of structure, first, between some particular formulations of systems known as [[Hilbert-style deduction system]] and [[combinatory logic]], and, secondly, between some particular formulations of systems known as [[natural deduction]] and [[lambda calculus]].

== Corresponding systems ==

===Hilbert-style deduction systems and combinatory logic===
It was at the beginning a simple remark in Curry and Feys's 1958 book on combinatory logic: the simplest types for the basic combinators K and S of [[combinatory logic]] surprisingly corresponded to the respective [[axiom scheme]]s α → (β → α) and (α → (β → γ)) → ((α → β) → (α → γ)) used in [[Hilbert-style deduction system]]s. For this reason, these schemes are now often called axioms K and S. Examples of programs seen as proofs in a Hilbert-style logic are given [[#Examples|below]].

If one restricts to the implicational intuitionistic fragment, a simple way to formalize logic in Hilbert's style is as follows. Let Γ be a finite collection of formulas, considered as hypotheses. Then δ is ''derivable'' from Γ, denoted Γ ⊢ δ, in the following cases:

* δ is an hypothesis, i.e. it is a formula of Γ,
* δ is an instance of an axiom scheme; i.e., under the most common axiom system:
** δ has the form α → (β → α), or
** δ has the form (α → (β → γ)) → ((α → β) → (α → γ)),
* δ follows by deduction, i.e., for some α, both α → δ and α are already derivable from Γ (this is the rule of [[modus ponens]])

This can be formalized using [[inference rules]], as in the left column of the following table.

Typed combinatory logic can be formulated using a similar syntax: let Γ be a finite collection of variables, annotated with their types. A term T (also annotated with its type) will depend on these variables [Γ ⊢ T:δ] when:

* T is one of the variables in Γ,
* T is a basic combinator; i.e., under the most common combinator basis:
** T is K:α → (β → α) [where α and β denote the types of its arguments], or
** T is S:(α → (β → γ)) → ((α → β) → (α → γ)),
* T is the composition of two subterms which depend on the variables in Γ.

The generation rules defined here are given in the right-column below. Curry's remark simply states that both columns are in one-to-one correspondence. The restriction of the correspondence to [[intuitionistic logic]] means that some [[Classical logic|classical]] [[tautology (logic)|tautologies]], such as [[Peirce's law]] ((α → β) → α) → α, are excluded from the correspondence.

| &lt;math&gt;\frac{\Gamma \vdash E_1:\alpha \rightarrow \beta \qquad \Gamma \vdash E_2:\alpha}{\Gamma \vdash E_1\;E_2:\beta} &lt;/math&gt;
|}

Seen at a more abstract level, the correspondence can be restated as shown in the following table. Especially, the [[deduction theorem]] specific to Hilbert-style logic matches the process of [[Combinatory logic#Conversion of a lambda term to an equivalent combinatorial term|abstraction elimination]] of combinatory logic.

{| class="wikitable" style="margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;"

|- 
| axioms || combinators
|- 
| modus ponens || application
|- 
| [[deduction theorem]]  || [[Combinatory logic#Conversion of a lambda term to an equivalent combinatorial term|abstraction elimination]]
|}

Thanks to the correspondence, results from combinatory logic can be transferred to Hilbert-style logic and vice versa. For instance, the notion of [[combinatory logic#Reduction in combinatory logic|reduction]] of terms in combinatory logic can be transferred to Hilbert-style logic and it provides a way to canonically transform proofs into other proofs of the same statement. One can also transfer the notion of normal terms to a notion of normal proofs, expressing that the hypotheses of the axioms never need to be all detached (since otherwise a simplification can happen).

Conversely, the non provability in intuitionistic logic of [[Peirce's law]] can be transferred back to combinatory logic: there is no typed term of combinatory logic that is typable with type ((α → β) → α) → α.

Results on the completeness of some sets of combinators or axioms can also be transferred. For instance, the fact that the combinator '''X''' constitutes a [[Combinatory logic#One-point basis|one-point basis]] of (extensional) combinatory logic implies that the single axiom scheme
:(((α → (β → γ)) → ((α → β) → (α → γ))) → ((δ → (ε → δ)) → ζ)) → ζ,
which is the [[principal type]] of '''X''', is an adequate replacement to the combination of the axiom schemes 
:α → (β → α) and
:(α → (β → γ)) → ((α → β) → (α → γ)).

===Natural deduction and lambda calculus===
After [[Haskell Curry|Curry]] emphasized the syntactic correspondence between [[Hilbert-style deduction system|Hilbert-style deduction]] and [[combinatory logic]], [[William Alvin Howard|Howard]] made explicit in 1969 a syntactic analogy between the programs of [[simply typed lambda calculus]] and the proofs of [[natural deduction]]. Below, the left-hand side formalizes intuitionistic implicational natural deduction as a calculus of [[sequent]]s (the use of sequents is standard in discussions of the Curry–Howard isomorphism as it allows the deduction rules to be stated more cleanly) with implicit weakening and the right-hand side shows the typing rules of [[lambda calculus]]. In the left-hand side, Γ, Γ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and Γ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; denote ordered sequences of formulas while in the right-hand side, they denote sequences of named (i.e., typed) formulas with all names different.

| &lt;math&gt;\frac{\Gamma \vdash t:\alpha \rightarrow \beta \qquad \Gamma \vdash u:\alpha}{\Gamma \vdash t\;u:\beta} &lt;/math&gt;
|}

To paraphrase the correspondence, proving Γ ⊢ α means having a program that, given values with the types listed in Γ, manufactures an object of type α. An axiom corresponds to the introduction of a new variable with a new, unconstrained type, the →&amp;nbsp;I rule corresponds to function abstraction and the →&amp;nbsp;E rule corresponds to function application. Observe that the correspondence is not exact if the context Γ is taken to be a set of formulas as, e.g., the λ-terms λx.λy.x and λx.λy.y of type α → α → α would not be distinguished in the correspondence. Examples are given [[#Examples|below]].

Howard showed that the correspondence extends to other connectives of the logic and other constructions of simply typed lambda calculus. Seen at an abstract level, the correspondence can then be summarized as shown in the following table. Especially, it also shows that the notion of normal forms in [[lambda calculus]] matches [[Dag Prawitz|Prawitz]]'s notion of normal deduction in [[natural deduction]], from which it follows that the algorithms for the [[type inhabitation problem]] can be turned into algorithms for deciding [[intuitionistic]] provability.

Howard's correspondence naturally extends to other extensions of [[natural deduction]] and [[simply typed lambda calculus]]. Here is a non-exhaustive list:

===Classical logic and control operators===
At the time of Curry, and also at the time of Howard, the proofs-as-programs correspondence concerned only [[intuitionistic logic]], i.e. a logic in which, in particular, [[Peirce's law]] was ''not'' deducible. The extension of the correspondence to Peirce's law and hence to [[classical logic]] became clear from the work of Griffin on typing operators that capture the evaluation context of a given program execution so that this evaluation context can be later on reinstalled. The basic Curry–Howard-style correspondence for classical logic is given below. Note the correspondence between the [[double-negation translation]] used to map classical proofs to intuitionistic logic and the [[continuation-passing style|continuation-passing-style]] translation used to map lambda terms involving control to pure lambda terms. More particularly, call-by-name continuation-passing-style translations relates to [[Kolmogorov]]'s double negation translation and call-by-value continuation-passing-style translations relates to a kind of double-negation translation due to Kuroda.

| [[Peirce's law]]: ((α → β) → α) → α || [[call-with-current-continuation]]
|-

|}

A finer Curry–Howard correspondence exists for classical logic if one defines classical logic not by adding an axiom such as [[Peirce's law]], but by allowing several conclusions in sequents. In the case of classical natural deduction, there exists a proofs-as-programs correspondence with the typed programs of Parigot's [[lambda-mu calculus|λμ-calculus]].

===Sequent calculus===
A proofs-as-programs correspondence can be settled for the formalism known as [[Gentzen]]'s [[sequent calculus]] but it is not a correspondence with a well-defined pre-existing model of computation as it was for Hilbert-style and natural deductions.

Sequent calculus is characterized by the presence of left introduction rules, right introduction rule and a cut rule that can be eliminated. The structure of sequent calculus relates to a calculus whose structure is close to the one of some [[abstract machine]]s. The informal correspondence is as follows:

|}

==Related proofs-as-programs correspondences==

===The role of de Bruijn===

[[Nicolaas Govert de Bruijn|N. G. de Bruijn]] used the lambda notation for representing proofs of the theorem checker [[Automath]], and represented propositions as "categories" of their proofs.  It was in the late 1960s at the same period of time Howard wrote his manuscript; de Bruijn was likely unaware of Howard's work, and stated the correspondence independently (Sørensen &amp; Urzyczyn [1998] 2006, pp 98–99).  Some researchers tend to use the term Curry–Howard–de Bruijn correspondence in place of Curry–Howard correspondence.

===BHK interpretation===

The [[BHK interpretation]] interprets intuitionistic proofs as functions but it does not specify the class of functions relevant for the interpretation. If one takes lambda calculus for this class of function, then the [[BHK interpretation]] tells the same as Howard's correspondence between natural deduction and lambda calculus.

===Realizability===

[[Stephen Cole Kleene|Kleene]]'s recursive [[realizability]] splits proofs of intuitionistic arithmetic into the pair of a recursive function and of
a proof of a formula expressing that the recursive function "realizes", i.e. correctly instantiates the disjunctions and existential quantifiers of the initial formula so that the formula gets true.

[[Georg Kreisel|Kreisel]]'s modified realizability applies to intuitionistic higher-order predicate logic and shows that the [[simply typed lambda calculus|simply typed lambda term]] inductively extracted from the proof realizes the initial formula. In the case of propositional logic, it coincides with Howard's statement: the extracted lambda term is the proof itself (seen as an untyped lambda term) and the realizability statement is a paraphrase of the fact that the extracted lambda term has the type that the formula means (seen as a type).

[[Kurt Gödel|Gödel]]'s [[dialectica interpretation]] realizes (an extension of) intuitionistic arithmetic with computable functions. The connection with lambda calculus is unclear, even in the case of natural deduction.

===Curry–Howard–Lambek correspondence===
[[Joachim Lambek]] showed in the early 1970s that the proofs of intuitionistic propositional logic and the combinators of typed [[combinatory logic]] share a common equational theory which is the one of [[cartesian closed categories]]. The expression Curry–Howard–Lambek correspondence is now used by some people to refer to the three way isomorphism between intuitionistic logic, typed lambda calculus and cartesian closed categories, with objects being interpreted as types or propositions and morphisms as terms or proofs. The correspondence works at the equational level and is not the expression of a syntactic identity of structures as it is the case for each of Curry's and Howard's correspondences: i.e. the structure of a well-defined morphism in a cartesian-closed category is not comparable to the structure of a proof of the corresponding judgment in either Hilbert-style logic or natural deduction.  To clarify this distinction, the underlying syntactic structure of cartesian closed categories is rephrased below.

Objects (types) are defined by
* &lt;math&gt;\top&lt;/math&gt; is an object
* if &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; are objects then &lt;math&gt;\alpha \times \beta&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\alpha \rightarrow \beta&lt;/math&gt; are objects.

Morphisms (terms) are defined by
* &lt;math&gt;id&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\star&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{eval}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\pi_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\pi_2&lt;/math&gt; are morphisms
* if &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; is a morphism,  &lt;math&gt;\lambda t&lt;/math&gt; is a morphism
* if &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; are morphisms, &lt;math&gt;(t, u)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;u \circ t&lt;/math&gt; are morphisms.

Well-defined morphisms (typed terms) are defined by the following [[type rule|typing rules]] (in which the usual categorical morphism notation &lt;math&gt;f : \alpha \to \beta&lt;/math&gt; is replaced with [[sequent calculus]] notation &lt;math&gt;f :\!\!-~~ \alpha ~\vdash~ \beta&lt;/math&gt;).

Identity:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{}{id:\!\!-~~ \alpha ~\vdash~ \alpha}&lt;/math&gt;

Composition:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{t:\!\!-~~ \alpha ~\vdash~ \beta\qquad u:\!\!-~~ \beta ~\vdash~ \gamma}{u \circ t:\!\!- ~\alpha ~\vdash~ \gamma}&lt;/math&gt;

[[Unit type]] ([[terminal object]]):
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{}{\star:\!\!-~~\alpha ~\vdash~ \top}&lt;/math&gt;

Cartesian product:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{t:\!\!-~~\alpha ~\vdash~ \beta\qquad u:\!\!-~~\alpha ~\vdash~ \gamma}{(t,u):\!\!-~~ \alpha ~\vdash~ \beta \times \gamma}&lt;/math&gt;

Left and right projection:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{}{\pi_1:\!\!-~~ \alpha \times \beta ~\vdash~ \alpha}\qquad\frac{}{\pi_2:\!\!-~~ \alpha \times \beta ~\vdash~ \beta}&lt;/math&gt;

[[Currying]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{t:\!\!-~~ \alpha \times \beta ~\vdash~ \gamma}{\lambda t:\!\!-~~ \alpha ~\vdash~ \beta \rightarrow \gamma}&lt;/math&gt;

[[Apply|Application]]:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{}{eval:\!\!-~~ (\alpha \rightarrow \beta) \times \alpha ~\vdash~ \beta}&lt;/math&gt;

Finally, the equations of the category are
* &lt;math&gt;id \circ t = t&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;t \circ id = t&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;(v \circ u) \circ t = v \circ (u \circ t)&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\star = id&lt;/math&gt;  (if well-typed)
* &lt;math&gt;\star \circ u = \star&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\pi_1 \circ (t, u) = t&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\pi_2 \circ (t,u) = u&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;(\pi_1, \pi_2) = id&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;(t_1, t_2) \circ u = (t_1 \circ u, t_2 \circ u) &lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;eval \circ (\lambda t \circ \pi_1, \pi_2) = t&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\lambda eval = id&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\lambda t \circ u  = \lambda (t \circ (u \circ \pi_1, \pi_2))&lt;/math&gt;

These equations imply the following &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt;-laws:
* &lt;math&gt;(\pi_1 \circ t, \pi_2 \circ t) = t&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;\lambda (eval \circ (t \circ \pi_1, \pi_2)) = t&lt;/math&gt;

Now, there exists &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;t:\!\!-~ \alpha_1 \times \ldots \times \alpha_n \vdash \beta&lt;/math&gt; iff &lt;math&gt;\alpha_1, \ldots, \alpha_n \vdash \beta &lt;/math&gt; is provable in implicational intuitionistic logic,.

==Examples==
Thanks to the Curry–Howard correspondence, a typed expression whose type corresponds to a logical formula is analogous to a proof of that formula. Here are examples.

===The identity combinator seen as a proof of &lt;tt&gt;α → α&lt;/tt&gt; in Hilbert-style logic===
As an example, consider a proof of the theorem &lt;tt&gt;α → α&lt;/tt&gt;. In [[lambda calculus]], this is the type of the identity function '''I''' = λ''x''.''x'' and in combinatory logic, the identity function is obtained by applying '''S''' = λ''fgx''.''fx(gx)'' twice to '''K''' = λ''xy''.''x''.  That is, '''I''' = (('''S''' '''K''') '''K'''). As a description of a proof, this says that the following steps can be used to prove &lt;tt&gt;α → α&lt;/tt&gt;:

* instantiate the second axiom scheme with the formulas &lt;tt&gt;α&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;β → α&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;α&lt;/tt&gt;, so that to obtain a proof of &lt;tt&gt;(α → ((β → α) → α)) → ((α → (β → α)) → (α → α))&lt;/tt&gt;,
* instantiate the first axiom scheme once with &lt;tt&gt;α&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;β → α&lt;/tt&gt;, so that to obtain a proof of &lt;tt&gt;α → ((β → α) → α)&lt;/tt&gt;,
* instantiate the first axiom scheme a second time with &lt;tt&gt;α&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;β&lt;/tt&gt;, so that to obtain a proof of &lt;tt&gt;α → (β → α)&lt;/tt&gt;,
* apply modus ponens twice so that to obtain a proof of &lt;tt&gt;α → α&lt;/tt&gt;

In general, the procedure is that whenever the program contains an application of the form (''P'' ''Q''), these steps should be followed:
# First prove theorems corresponding to the types of ''P'' and ''Q''. 
# Since ''P'' is being applied to ''Q'', the type of ''P'' must have the form α → β and the type of ''Q'' must have the form α for some &lt;tt&gt;α&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;β&lt;/tt&gt;. Therefore, it is possible to detach the conclusion, &lt;tt&gt;β&lt;/tt&gt;, via the modus ponens rule.

===The composition combinator seen as a proof of &lt;tt&gt;(β → α) → (γ → β) → γ → α&lt;/tt&gt; in Hilbert-style logic===
As a more complicated example, let's look at the theorem that corresponds to the '''B''' function. The type of '''B''' is (β → α) → (γ → β) → γ → α. '''B''' is equivalent to ('''S''' ('''K''' '''S''') '''K'''). This is our roadmap for the proof of the theorem (β → α) → (γ → β) → γ → α.

The first step is to construct ('''K''' '''S'''). To make the antecedent of the '''K''' axiom look like the '''S''' axiom, set α equal to &lt;tt&gt;(α → β → γ) → (α → β) → α → γ&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;β&lt;/tt&gt; equal to &lt;tt&gt;δ&lt;/tt&gt; (to avoid variable collisions):

:&lt;tt&gt;'''K''' : α → β → α&lt;/tt&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;tt&gt;'''K'''[α = (α → β → γ) → (α → β) → α → γ, β=δ] : ((α → β → γ) → (α → β) → α → γ) → δ → (α → β → γ) → (α → β) → α → γ&lt;/tt&gt;

Since the antecedent here is just '''S''', the consequent can be detached using Modus Ponens:

:&lt;tt&gt;'''K S''' : δ → (α → β → γ) → (α → β) → α → γ&lt;/tt&gt;

This is the theorem that corresponds to the type of ('''K''' '''S'''). Now apply '''S''' to this expression. Taking '''S''' as follows

:&lt;tt&gt;'''S''' : (α → β → γ) → (α → β) → α → γ&lt;/tt&gt;,

put &lt;tt&gt;α&lt;/tt&gt; = &lt;tt&gt;δ&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;β&lt;/tt&gt; = &lt;tt&gt;α → β → γ&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;γ&lt;/tt&gt; = &lt;tt&gt;(α → β) → α → γ&lt;/tt&gt;, yielding

:&lt;tt&gt;'''S'''[α = δ, β = α → β → γ, γ = (α → β) → α → γ] : (δ → (α → β → γ) → (α → β) → α → γ) → (δ → (α → β → γ)) → δ → (α → β) → α → γ&lt;/tt&gt;

and then detach the consequent:

:&lt;tt&gt;'''S (K S)''' : (δ → α → β → γ) → δ → (α → β) → α → γ&lt;/tt&gt;

This is the formula for the type of ('''S''' ('''K''' '''S''')). A special case of this theorem has &lt;tt&gt;δ&lt;/tt&gt; = &lt;tt&gt;(β → γ)&lt;/tt&gt;:

:&lt;tt&gt;'''S (K S)'''[δ = β → γ] : ((β → γ) → α → β → γ) → (β → γ) → (α → β) → α → γ&lt;/tt&gt;

This last formula must be applied to '''K'''. Specialize '''K''' again, this time by replacing &lt;tt&gt;α&lt;/tt&gt; with &lt;tt&gt;(β → γ)&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;β&lt;/tt&gt; with &lt;tt&gt;α&lt;/tt&gt;:

:&lt;tt&gt;'''K''' : α → β → α&lt;/tt&gt;
:&lt;tt&gt;'''K'''[α = β → γ, β = α] : (β → γ) → α → (β → γ)&lt;/tt&gt;

This is the same as the antecedent of the prior formula so, detaching the consequent:

:&lt;tt&gt;'''S (K S) K''' : (β → γ) → (α → β) → α → γ&lt;/tt&gt;

Switching the names of the variables &lt;tt&gt;α&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;γ&lt;/tt&gt; gives us

:&lt;tt&gt;(β → α) → (γ → β) → γ → α&lt;/tt&gt;

which was what remained to prove.

===The normal proof of &lt;tt&gt;(β → α) → (γ → β) → γ → α&lt;/tt&gt; in natural deduction seen as a λ-term===
The diagram below gives proof of &lt;tt&gt;(β → α) → (γ → β) → γ → α&lt;/tt&gt; in natural deduction and shows how it can be interpreted as the λ-expression λ ''a''. λ''b''. λ ''g''.(''a'' (''b'' ''g'')) of type &lt;tt&gt;(β → α) → (γ → β) → γ → α&lt;/tt&gt;.

                                      a:β → α, b:γ → β, g:γ ⊢ b : γ → β    a:β → α, b:γ → β, g:γ ⊢ g : γ
 ———————————————————————————————————  ————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
 a:β → α, b:γ → β, g:γ ⊢ a : β → α      a:β → α, b:γ → β, g:γ ⊢ b g : β
 ————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————————
                a:β → α, b:γ → β, g:γ ⊢ a (b g) : α
                ————————————————————————————————————
                a:β → α, b:γ → β ⊢ λ g. a (b g) : γ → α
                ————————————————————————————————————————
                         a:β → α ⊢ λ b. λ g. a (b g) : (γ → β) -&gt; γ → α
                         ————————————————————————————————————
                                 ⊢ λ a. λ b. λ g. a (b g) : (β → α) -&gt; (γ → β) -&gt; γ → α

==Other applications==
Recently, the isomorphism has been proposed as a way to define search space partition in [[genetic programming]].&lt;ref&gt;F. Binard and A. Felty, "Genetic programming with polymorphic types and higher-order functions." In ''Proceedings of the 10th annual conference on Genetic and evolutionary computation,'' pages 1187 1194, 2008.[http://www.site.uottawa.ca/~afelty/dist/gecco08.pdf]
&lt;/ref&gt; The method indexes sets of genotypes (the program trees evolved by the GP system) by their Curry–Howard isomorphic proof (referred to as a species).

==Generalizations==
The correspondences listed here go much farther and deeper. For example, cartesian closed categories are generalized by [[closed monoidal category|closed monoidal categories]]. The [[internal language]] of these categories is the [[linear type system]] (corresponding to [[linear logic]]), which generalizes simply-typed lambda calculus as the internal language of cartesian closed categories. Moreover, these can be shown to correspond to [[cobordism]]s,&lt;ref&gt;John c. Baez and Mike Stay, "[http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/rosetta/rose3.pdf Physics, Topology, Logic and Computation: A Rosetta Stone]", (2009) [https://arxiv.org/abs/0903.0340/ ArXiv 0903.0340] in ''New Structures for Physics'', ed. Bob Coecke, ''Lecture Notes in Physics'' vol. '''813''', Springer, Berlin, 2011, pp. 95–174.&lt;/ref&gt; which play a vital role in [[string theory]].

An extended set of equivalences is also explored in [[homotopy type theory]], which became a very active area of research around 2013 and {{As of|2018|lc=y}} still is.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&amp;q=%22homotopy%20type%20theory%22 |title=homotopy type theory - Google Trends |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |website=trends.google.com |access-date=2018-01-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here, [[type theory]] is extended by the [[univalence axiom]] ("equivalence is equivalent to equality") which permits homotopy type theory to be used as a foundation for all of mathematics (including [[set theory]] and classical logic, providing new ways to discuss the [[axiom of choice]] and many other things). That is, the Curry–Howard correspondence that proofs are elements of inhabited types is generalized to the notion [[homotopy|homotopic equivalence]] of proofs (as paths in space, the [[identity type]] or [[Intuitionistic type theory#Connectives of type theory|equality type]] of type theory being interpreted as a path).&lt;ref&gt;[http://homotopytypetheory.org/book/ ''Homotopy Type Theory: Univalent Foundations of Mathematics''].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11011">Among the set of options that agents choose from, the '''default option''' is the option the chooser will obtain if he or she does nothing. Broader interpretations of default options include options that are normative or suggested. Experiments and observational studies show that making an option a default increases the likelihood that it is chosen; this is called the '''default effect'''. Different causes for this effect have been discussed. Setting or changing defaults therefore has been proposed as an effective way of influencing behavior—for example, with respect to deciding whether to become an organ donor,&lt;ref name="organ" /&gt; giving consent to receive e-mail marketing, or choosing the level of one's retirement contributions.

== Default effect ==

=== Endogenous default effects ===
In a choice context, a default refers to that option which choosers end up with if they do not make an active choice. This notion is similar to the one in [[default (computer science)|computer science]] where defaults are settings or values that are automatically assigned outside of user intervention. Setting the default affects how likely people end up with an option. This is called the default effect. More precisely, it refers to changes in the probability that an agent chooses a particular option when it is set as a default as opposed to the situation where this option has not been set as default. For example, different countries have different [[Organ Donation#Legislation|rules]] on how to become an organ donor. In countries with the opt-in policy, all citizens are automatically considered as non-donors unless they actively register as donors. In countries with the opt-out policy, all citizens are automatically considered as donors unless they actively seek to be struck from the register. It has been argued that this difference in policy is the main cause of the significant difference in donor rates across the respective countries.&lt;ref name="organ"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Johnson | first1 = E. J. | last2 = Goldstein | first2 = D. | title = MEDICINE: Do Defaults Save Lives? | doi = 10.1126/science.1091721 | journal = Science | volume = 302 | issue = 5649 | pages = 1338–1339 | year = 2003 | pmid =  14631022| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Exogenous default effects ===
Some default effects are implied by the situation. In social settings, for example, the normative choice (what others are doing) may be adopted unconsciously as a '''social default effect.'''&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Social Defaults: Observed Choices Become Choice Defaults|url = http://jcr.oxfordjournals.org/content/41/3/746|journal = Journal of Consumer Research|date = 2014-10-01|issn = 0093-5301|pages = 746–760|volume = 41|issue = 3|doi = 10.1086/677315|language = en|first = Young Eun|last = Huh|first2 = Joachim|last2 = Vosgerau|first3 = Carey K.|last3 = Morewedge}}&lt;/ref&gt; People are thus more likely to choose what they observe other choosing, even if they do not believe that other person is the more knowledgeable person. People are also more likely to treat choices that require less justification as defaults. The default option for [[Parole board|parole hearings]], for example, is to deny prisoners parole.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Extraneous factors in judicial decisions|url = http://www.pnas.org/content/108/17/6889|journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date = 2011-04-26|issn = 0027-8424|pmc = 3084045|pmid = 21482790|pages = 6889–6892|volume = 108|issue = 17|doi = 10.1073/pnas.1018033108|language = en|first = Shai|last = Danziger|first2 = Jonathan|last2 = Levav|first3 = Liora|last3 = Avnaim-Pesso}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Explanations ==
A number of different explanations have been offered for how default setting causes a change in the choice distribution. These include Cognitive Effort, Switching Costs, Loss Aversion, Recommendation and Change of Meaning.

=== Cognitive effort ===
If an agent is indifferent or conflicted between options, it may involve too much cognitive effort to base a choice on explicit evaluations. In that case, he or she might disregard the evaluations and choose according to the default heuristic instead, which simply states “if there is a default, do nothing about it”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Gigerenzer | first1 = G. | doi = 10.1111/j.1745-6916.2008.00058.x | title = Why Heuristics Work | journal = Perspectives on Psychological Science | volume = 3 | pages = 20–281 | year = 2008 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence supporting this cognitive effort account is provided in the realm of social default effects. Participants distracted by a demanding concurrent task were more likely to choose the one of two snacks that they saw a previous participant choose. Increasing the number of snacks received as a function of the choice decreased this social default effect.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Switching costs ===
If an agent faces costs when diverging from a default that surmount the possible benefits from switching to another option, then it is rational to stick with the default option. Costs of diverging from the default might involve costs for the search of information (time, consultancy fees) and/or costs for registering the choice (time, postage, lawyer fees). This amounts to a standard [[transaction cost]] explanation from [[rational choice theory]].

=== Loss aversion ===
If an agent evaluates options on multiple dimensions, then the default functions as a reference point from which some dimensions are interpreted as losses and therefore becomes more important for the choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.2307/2937956| jstor = 2937956| title = Loss Aversion in Riskless Choice: A Reference-Dependent Model| year = 1991| last1 = Tversky | first1 = A.| last2 = Kahneman | first2 = D.| journal = The Quarterly Journal of Economics| volume = 106| issue = 4| pages = 1039}}&lt;/ref&gt; This [[loss aversion]] explanation of the default effect can be illustrated with the following example. Let A, B and C be three different pension saving plans. The agent evaluates them (in terms of time-discounted utilities) on the two following dimensions, current consumption and future savings which obviously trade off: the more one saves for the future, the less one can consume in the present.
{| class="wikitable"
|-
!  !! A !! B !! C
|-
| Consumption || 10 || 20 || 30
|-
| Savings || 30 || 20 || 10

|}

Seen from plan A being the default, plans B and C constitute losses in the savings dimension. Seen from plan C being the default, however, plans A and B constitute losses in the consumption dimension. According to the theory of loss aversion, that dimension which is considered a loss influences the decision stronger than that which is considered a gain. Hence for either default A or C, the loss-averse agent would choose sticking with the default.

=== Recommendation ===
If an agent interprets the default as a signal from the policy maker, whom he or she sufficiently trusts, he or she might rationally decide to stick with this default. That the policy maker sets a default is interpreted as an implicit recommendation to choose that default option. The information taken from this recommendation might be sufficient to change some people's preferences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = McKenzie | first1 = C. R. M. | last2 = Liersch | first2 = M. J. | last3 = Finkelstein | first3 = S.

=== Change of meaning ===
Defaults also might affect the meaning of choice options and thus agents' choices over them. For example, it has been shown that under an opt-in policy in organ donation choosing not to become an organ donor is perceived as a choice of little moral failing. Under an opt-out policy, in contrast, choosing not to be an organ donor is perceived as morally more deficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Davidai | first1 = S. | last2 = Gilovich | first2 = T. | last3 = Ross | first3 = L. D. | doi = 10.1073/pnas.1211695109 | title = The meaning of default options for potential organ donors | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | volume = 109 | issue = 38 | pages = 15201 | year = 2012 | pmid =  22949639| pmc = 3458339}}&lt;/ref&gt; These differences in evaluation might affect the rational choice over these options.

== Default setting as a policy instrument ==
Setting or changing defaults has been proposed as an effective way of influencing behaviour—for example, with respect to deciding whether to become an organ donor,&lt;ref name="organ"/&gt; giving consent to receive e-mail marketing,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Johnson | first1 = E.

A '''deferred sentence''' is a sentence that is suspended until after a defendant has completed a period of [[probation]]. If the defendant fulfills the stipulations surrounding probation, a judge may then throw out the sentence and guilty plea, clearing the incident from their record. If the defendant violates probation, he or she must serve the full sentence immediately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Deferred Sentence|url=https://definitions.uslegal.com/d/deferred-sentence|website=USLegal|publisher=US Legal, Inc.|accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
In the United States, a defendant must plead guilty to at least one of the crimes he or she is accused of in order to receive a deferred sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=Sentencing in Criminal Cases - Fines, Probation and Jail|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/criminal/sentences.html|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=22 July 2017|date=1 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The promise of a deferred sentence is often traded in exchange for a guilty plea in [[plea bargain]]s.

Deferred sentences are often given to first time offenders, or to those who have committed relatively minor crimes, although ultimately, the choice to defer a sentence is left to a judge's discretion.

===New York===
{{main|Adjournment in contemplation of dismissal}}
In the state of [[New York (state)|New York]], a similar process is known as [[adjournment in contemplation of dismissal]] (ACOD).  What typically happens in such a case is that the potential sentence is deferred for six months, and if the defendant stays out of trouble, the charge is dropped entirely with no public record of the offense.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Adjournment in Contemplation of Dismissal Information Sheet|url=http://nassau18b.org/forms/adjournment_in_contemplation_of_dismissal.pdf|website=Nassau County New York  Assigned Counsel Defender Plan|accessdate=22 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A deferred sentence is not exactly the same as an ACOD. One of the primary differences is that receiving an ACOD doesn't require an admission of guilt or plea of guilty unlike a deferred sentence which requires such. Upon completion of the ACOD, the charges are automatically sealed, fingerprints &amp; mugshots are destroyed, and the arrest is annulled. There is no conviction and all rights you had prior to arrest are restored. In order to enter the deferred sentence program, a plea of guilt must be made. Even though successful completion of a deferred sentence results in a dismissal of charges and guilty plea withdrawal, most states still consider it to be a conviction since a plea of guilt was entered and you were considered "convicted" for the duration of the program. Furthermore, completion of a deferred sentence program usually requires a request to the court to have the underlying charges and arrest sealed.{{cn|date=July 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4612">'''Desiring-production''' ({{lang-fr|production désirante}}) is a term coined by the French thinkers [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari]] in their book ''[[Anti-Œdipus]]'' (1972).

==Overview==
Deleuze and Guattari oppose the [[Freud]]ian conception of the [[unconscious mind|unconscious]] as a representational "theater", instead favoring a productive "factory" model: [[desire (psychoanalysis)|desire]] is not an [[The Imaginary (psychoanalysis)|imaginary]] force based on [[Lack (manque)|lack]], but a real, productive force. They describe the machinic nature of desire as a kind of "desiring-machine" that functions as a circuit breaker in a larger "circuit" of various other machines to which it is connected. Meanwhile, the desiring-machine is also producing a flow of desire from itself. Deleuze and Guattari conceptualize a multi-functional universe composed of such machines all connected to each other: "There are no desiring-machines that exist outside the social machines that they form on a large scale; and no social machines without the desiring machines that inhabit them on a small scale&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/9826668|title=Anti-Oedipus : capitalism and schizophrenia|last=1925-1995.|first=Deleuze, Gilles,|date=1983|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|others=Guattari, Félix, 1930-1992.|year=|isbn=0816612250|location=Minneapolis|pages=340|oclc=9826668}}&lt;/ref&gt;." Desiring-production is explosive: "there is no desiring-machine capable of being assembled without demolishing entire social sectors".

The concept of desiring-production is part of Deleuze and Guattari's more general appropriation of [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]'s formulation of the [[Will to Power]].  In both concepts, a pleasurable force of appropriation of what is outside oneself, incorporating into oneself what is other than oneself,  characterizes the essential process of all life.  Similarly, a kind of reverse force of "forgetting" in Nietzsche and the [[body without organs]] in Deleuze and Guattari disavows the Will to Power and desiring-production, attempting to realize the ideal of an hermetic subject.

Thenceforth, while very interested by [[Wilhelm Reich]]'s fundamental question &amp;mdash; ''why did the masses desire fascism?'' &amp;mdash; they criticized his dualist theory leading to a rational social reality on one side, and an irrational desire reality on the other side. ''Anti-Œdipus'' was thus an attempt to think beyond [[Freudo-Marxism]]; and Deleuze and Guattari tried to do for [[Freud]] what Marx had done for [[Adam Smith]].

Published in the same year as ''Anti-Œdipus'', [[Guy Hocquenghem]]'s ''Homosexual Desire'' re-articulated desiring-production within the emergent field of [[queer theory]].

==Docking states==
A docking/berthing connection is referred to as either "soft" or "hard". Typically, a spacecraft first initiates a ''soft dock'' by making contact and latching its docking connector with that of the target vehicle. Once the soft connection is secured, if both spacecraft are pressurized, they may proceed to a ''hard dock'' where the docking mechanisms form an airtight seal, enabling interior hatches to be safely opened so that crew and cargo can be transferred.

==History==
{{Refimprove section|date=October 2018}} 
[[File:Gemini 8 docking.jpg|thumb| The first spacecraft docking was performed between [[Gemini 8]] and an unmanned [[Agena Target Vehicle]] on March 16, 1966.]]
Spacecraft docking capability depends on [[space rendezvous]], the ability of two spacecraft to find each other and [[orbital station-keeping|station-keep in the same orbit]]. This was first developed by the United States for [[Project Gemini]]. It was planned for the crew of [[Gemini 6A|Gemini 6]] to rendezvous and manually dock under the command of [[Wally Schirra]], with an unmanned [[Agena Target Vehicle]] in October 1965, but the Agena vehicle exploded during launch. On the revised mission Gemini 6A, Schirra successfully performed a rendezvous in December 1965 with the manned [[Gemini 7]], approaching to within one foot, but there was no docking capability between two Gemini spacecraft. The first docking with an Agena was successfully performed under the command of [[Neil Armstrong]] on [[Gemini 8]] on March 16, 1966. Manual dockings were performed on three subsequent Gemini missions in 1966.

The [[Apollo program]] depended on [[lunar orbit rendezvous]] to achieve its objective of landing men on the Moon. This required first a [[transposition, docking, and extraction]] maneuver between the [[Apollo Command/Service Module]] (CSM) mother spacecraft and the [[Apollo Lunar Module|Lunar Module]] (LM) landing spacecraft, shortly after both craft were sent out of Earth orbit on a path to the Moon. Then after completing the lunar landing mission, two astronauts in the LM had to rendezvous and dock with the CSM in lunar orbit, in order to be able to return to Earth. The spacecraft were designed to permit intra-vehicular crew transfer through a tunnel between the nose of the Command Module and the roof of the Lunar Module. These maneuvers were first demonstrated in [[low Earth orbit]] on March 7, 1969, on [[Apollo 9]], then in lunar orbit in May 1969 on [[Apollo 10]], then in six lunar landing missions.

Unlike the United States, which used manual piloted docking throughout the Apollo and [[Space Shuttle]] programs, the Soviet Union employed automated docking systems from the beginning of its docking attempts. The first such system, [[Igla (spacecraft docking system)|Igla]], was successfully tested on October 30, 1967 when the two uncrewed [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz]] test vehicles [[Kosmos 186]] and [[Kosmos 188]] docked automatically in orbit.&lt;ref name=MirHH&gt;{{cite web |title=Mir Hardware Heritage Part 1: Soyuz |url=https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4225/documentation/mhh/mirhh-part1.pdf |publisher=NASA |accessdate=3 October 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171226011559/https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4225/documentation/mhh/mirhh-part1.pdf |archivedate=26 December 2017 |page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.niitp.ru/en/directions/02/history/ |accessdate=June 23, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080424051917/http://www.niitp.ru/en/directions/02/history/ |archivedate=April 24, 2008|title=History}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first successful Soviet docking. Proceeding to manned docking attempts, the Soviet Union first achieved rendezvous of [[Soyuz 3]] with the unmanned [[Soyuz 2]] craft on October 25, 1968; docking was unsuccessfully attempted. The first manned Soviet docking was achieved on January 16, 1969, between [[Soyuz 4]] and [[Soyuz 5]]. This early version of the [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz spacecraft]] had no internal transfer tunnel, but two cosmonauts performed an [[extravehicular activity|extravehicular]] transfer from Soyuz 5 to Soyuz 4, landing in a different spacecraft than they had launched in. 

In the 1970s, the Soviet Union upgraded the Soyuz spacecraft to add an internal transfer tunnel and used it to transport cosmonauts during the [[Salyut]] space station program with the first successful space station visit beginning on 7 June 1971, when [[Soyuz 11]] docked to [[Salyut 1]]. The United States followed suit, docking its Apollo spacecraft to the [[Skylab]] space station in May 1973. In July 1975, the two nations cooperated in the [[Apollo-Soyuz Test Project]], docking an Apollo spacecraft with a Soyuz using a specially designed docking module to accommodate the different docking systems and spacecraft atmospheres.

Beginning with [[Salyut 6]] in 1978, the Soviet Union began using the uncrewed [[Progress (spacecraft)|Progress]] cargo spacecraft to resupply its space stations in low earth orbit, greatly extending the length of crew stays. As an uncrewed spacecraft, Progress rendezvoused and docked with the space stations entirely automatically. In 1986, the Igla docking system was replaced with the updated Kurs system on Soyuz spacecraft. Progress spacecraft received the same upgrade several years later.&lt;ref name=MirHH /&gt;{{rp|7}}  The Kurs system is still used to dock to the [[Russian Orbital Segment]] of the [[ISS]] today.

===Androgyny===
{{Wiktionary|androgynous}}

Docking/berthing systems may be either androgynous ([[hermaphroditic connector|ungendered]]) or non-androgynous ([[gender of connectors and fasteners|gendered]]), indicating which parts of the system may mate together.

Early systems for conjoining spacecraft were all non-androgynous docking system designs. Non-androgynous designs are a form of "gender mating"&lt;ref name=nasa20090317/&gt; where each spacecraft to be joined has a unique design ("male" or "female") and a specific role to play in the docking process. The roles cannot be reversed. Furthermore, two spacecraft of the same gender cannot be joined at all.

Androgynous docking (and later androgynous berthing) by contrast has an identical interface on both spacecraft. In an androgynous interface, there is a single design which can connect to a duplicate of itself. This allows system-level [[Redundancy (engineering)|redundancy]] (role reversing) as well as rescue and collaboration between any two spacecraft. It also provides more flexible mission design and reduces unique mission analysis and training.&lt;ref name=nasa20090317/&gt;

The "probe and drogue" system allows visiting spacecraft using the "probe" docking interface, such as [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz]], [[Progress (spacecraft)|Progress]] and ESA’s [[Automated Transfer Vehicle|ATV]] spacecraft, to dock to space stations that offer a port with a "drogue" interface, like the former [[Salyut program|Salyut]] and [[Mir]] or the current [[ISS]] space station.

It consisted of a spherical section (2.55 m in diameter) topped with a cylindrical tunnel (2.2 m in diameter) with an APAS-89 androgynous docking port, a modified version of the APAS-75 system developed by NPO Energiya for the 1975 Apollo-Soyuz Test Project (Page 141). The plan was for the orbiter to be launched unmanned and fly to the Mir space station, where it would dock with the axial APAS-89 docking port of the Kristall module (Page 246). In the late 1980s NPO Energiya was ordered to build three Soyuz spacecraft (serial numbers 101, 102, 103) with APAS-89 docking ports (Page 246). Soyuz craft nr. 101 was eventually launched as Soyuz TM-16 on January 1993, carrying another resident crew (Gennadiy Manakov and Aleksandr Poleshchuk) to Mir space station. Equipped with an APAS-89 docking port, it was the only Soyuz vehicle to ever docking with the Kristall module. Soyuz "rescue" vehicle nr. 102 and 103, which had only been partially assembled, were modified as ordinary Soyuz TM spacecraft with standard "probe" docking mechanisms and were given new serial numbers (Page 249). In July 1992 NASA initiated the development of the Orbiter Docking System (ODS) to support Shuttle flights to Mir. Mounted in the forward end of the payload bay, the ODS consists of an external airlock, a supporting truss structure, and an APAS docking port. While the first two elements were built by Rockwell, the APAS was manufactured by RKK Energiya. Although Energiya's internal designator for the Shuttle APAS is APAS-95, it is essentially the same as Buran's APAS-89. While the ODS was slightly modified for Shuttle missions to ISS, APAS remained unchanged (Page 380).|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VRb1yAGVWNsC&amp;dq=%22APAS-95%22+nasa&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mir Docking Module]]), [[Soyuz TM-16]],&lt;ref name=Mir/&gt;&lt;ref name="sovietspaceshuttledockingmodule"/&gt; [[Buran (spacecraft)|Buran]] (was planned).&lt;ref name="sovietspaceshuttledockingmodule"/&gt; It had a circular transfer passage with a diameter of {{convert|800|mm|in|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=her/&gt;&lt;ref name=ARDS/&gt;&lt;ref name=AdvanDock/&gt;

===Adapters===
A docking or berthing adapter is a mechanical or electromechanical device that facilitates the connection of one type of docking or berthing interface to a different interface. While such interfaces may theoretically be docking/docking, docking/berthing, or berthing/berthing, only the first two types have been deployed in space to date. Previously launched and planned to be launched adapters are listed below:

* ASTP Docking Module: An airlock module that converted U.S. Probe and Drogue to [[Androgynous Peripheral Attach System|APAS-75]].

==Docking of unmanned spacecraft==
[[File:Hubble Space Telescope Final Mission.png|thumb|350871main s125e011810 hires full (cropped&amp;rotated)|The Soft-Capture Mechanism (SCM) added in 2009 to the [[Hubble Space Telescope]]. The SCM allows both manned and unmanned spacecraft that utilize the [[NASA Docking System]] (NDS) to dock with Hubble.]]
For the first fifty years of spaceflight, the main objective of most ''docking'' and ''berthing'' missions was to transfer crew, construct or resupply a space station, or to test for such a mission (e.g. the docking between [[Kosmos 186 and Kosmos 188]]).
Therefore, commonly at least one of the participating spacecraft was "manned", with a pressurized habitable volume (e.g. a space station or a lunar lander) being the target – the exceptions were a few fully unmanned Soviet docking missions (e.g. the dockings of Kosmos 1443 and Progress 23 to an unmanned [[Salyut 7]] or [[Progress M1-5]] to an unmanned [[Mir]]).
Another exception were a few missions of the manned US [[Space Shuttle]]s, like berthings of the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] (HST) during the five HST servicing missions.

Changes to the "manned" aspect began in 2015, as a number of economically driven commercial dockings of unmanned spacecraft were planned. In 2011, two commercial spacecraft providers  announced plans to provide [[Autonomous robot|autonomous]]/[[Teleoperation|teleoperated]] [[unmanned resupply spacecraft]] for servicing other unmanned spacecraft. Notably, both of these servicing spacecraft were intending to dock with satellites that weren't designed for docking, nor for in-space servicing.

The early business model for these services was primarily in near-[[geosynchronous]] orbit, although [[delta-v|large delta-v]] [[orbital maneuver]]ing services were also envisioned.&lt;ref name=av20110321/&gt;

Building off of the 2007 [[Orbital Express]] mission — a [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]]-sponsored mission to test in-space satellite servicing with two vehicles designed from the ground up for on-orbit refueling and subsystem replacement — two companies announced plans for commercial satellite servicing missions that would require docking of two unmanned vehicles.

A prominent spacecraft that received a mechanism for unmanned dockings is the [[Hubble Space Telescope]] (HST). In 2009 the [[STS-125]] shuttle mission added the Soft-Capture Mechanism (SCM) at the aft bulkhead of the space telescope. The SCM is meant for unpressurized dockings and will be used at the end of Hubble's service lifetime to dock an unmanned spacecraft to de-orbit Hubble. The SCM used was designed to be compatible to the [[NASA Docking System]] (NDS) interface to reserve the possibility of a [[Multi-Purpose Crew Vehicle]] docked mission.&lt;ref name="softcap"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/hubble/servicing/SM4/main/SCRS_FS_HTML.html|title=The Soft Capture and Rendezvous System|accessdate=May 22, 2009|publisher=NASA|year=2008|author=NASA }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-cooperative docking==

Docking with a spacecraft (or other man made space object) that does not have an operable attitude control system might sometimes be desirable, either in order to salvage it, or to initiate a controlled [[Atmospheric entry|de-orbit]]. Some theoretical techniques for docking with non-cooperative spacecraft have been proposed so far.&lt;ref name=ieee200610&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ma |first=Zhanhua |author2=Ma, Ou |author3=Shashikanth, Banavara |last-author-amp=yes |title=Optimal Control for Spacecraft to Rendezvous with a Tumbling Satellite in a Close Range |url=http://mae.nmsu.edu/~oma/Papers/Paper_Optimal_Ctrl_IROS06.pdf |journal=Proceedings of the 2006 IEEE/RSJ International Conference on Intelligent Robots and Systems |date=October 2006 |pages=4109–4114 |accessdate=2011-08-09 |quote=''One of the most challenging tasks for satellite on-orbit servicing is to rendezvous and capture a non-cooperative satellite such as a tumbling satellite.'' |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130605184656/http://mae.nmsu.edu/~oma/Papers/Paper_Optimal_Ctrl_IROS06.pdf |archivedate=2013-06-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Ma et al. assume a standardized "docking interface" exists on each spacecraft; see pp 4109. --&gt; Yet, with the sole exception of the [[Soyuz T-13]] mission to salvage the crippled [[Salyut 7]] space station, {{asof|2006|lc=y}}&lt;!-- 2006 is the date of the source --&gt;, all spacecraft dockings in the first fifty years of spaceflight had been accomplished with vehicles where both spacecraft involved were under either piloted, autonomous or telerobotic [[attitude control]].&lt;ref name=ieee200610/&gt;

Portree describes as "one of the most impressive feats of in-space repairs in history".&lt;ref name=Mir/&gt; Solar tracking failed and due to a telemetry fault the station did not report the failure to mission control while flying autonomously.

All Soviet and Russian space stations were equipped with automatic rendezvous and docking systems, from the first space station Salyut 1 using the IGLA system, to the [[Russian Orbital Segment]] of the [[International Space Station]] using the [[Kurs (docking system)|Kurs]] system. The soyuz crew found the station was not broadcasting radar or telemetry for rendezvous, and after arrival and external inspection of the tumbling station, the crew judged proximity using handheld laser rangefinders.

Dzhanibekov piloted his ship to intercept the forward port of Salyut 7, matched the station's rotation and achieved soft dock with the station. After achieving hard dock they confirmed that the station's electrical system was dead. Prior to opening the hatch, Dzhanibekov and Savinykh sampled the condition of the station's atmosphere and found it satisfactory. Attired in winter fur-lined clothing, they entered the cold station to conduct repairs. Within a week sufficient systems were brought back online to allow robot cargo ships to dock with the station. Nearly two months went by before atmospheric conditions on the space station were normalized.&lt;ref name=Mir/&gt;

===Uncrewed dockings of non-cooperative space objects===
{{Globalize/US|date=March 2016}}
[[File:Orbital Express 2.png|thumb|left|Orbital Express: ASTRO (left) and NEXTSat (right), 2007.]]

Non-cooperative rendezvous and capture techniques have been theorized, and [[Orbital Express|one mission]] has successfully been performed with uncrewed spacecraft in orbit.&lt;ref name=sfn20070704&gt;
{{cite news |last=Clark|first=Stephen |title=In-space satellite servicing tests come to an end |url=http://spaceflightnow.com/news/n0707/04orbitalexpress/ |accessdate=2014-03-20 |newspaper=Spaceflight Now |date=2007-07-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A typical approach for solving this problem involves two phases. First, [[attitude control|attitude]] and [[Orbit (dynamics)|orbital]] changes are made to the "chaser" spacecraft until it has zero relative motion with the "target" spacecraft. Second, docking maneuvers commence that are similar to traditional cooperative spacecraft docking. A standardized docking interface on each spacecraft is assumed.&lt;ref name=nmsu2008&gt;

NASA has identified automated and autonomous rendezvous and docking — the ability of two spacecraft to rendezvous and dock "operating independently from human controllers and without other back-up, [and which requires technology] advances in sensors, software, and [[Real-time Control System|realtime]] [[Orbital station-keeping|on-orbit positioning]] and [[Attitude control (spacecraft)#Attitude Control|flight control]], among other challenges" — as a critical technology to the "ultimate success of capabilities such as in-orbit [[propellant depot|propellant storage and refueling]]," and also for complex operations in assembling mission components for interplanetary destinations.&lt;ref name=nasa20100525&gt;{{cite web|last=Tooley|first=Craig|title=A New Space Enterprise of Exploration|url=http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/458813main_FTD_AutomatedAutonomousRendezvousAndDockingVehicleOverview.pdf|date=2010-05-25|publisher=NASA|accessdate=2012-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Automated/Autonomous Rendezvous &amp; Docking Vehicle (ARDV) is a proposed [[Flagship technology demonstrations|NASA Flagship Technology Demonstration]] (FTD) mission, for flight as early as 2014/2015. An important NASA objective on the proposed mission is to advance the technology and demonstrate automated rendezvous and docking. One mission element defined in the 2010 analysis was the development of a laser proximity operations sensor that could be used for non-cooperative vehicles at distances between {{convert|1|m}} and {{convert|3|km|sigfig=1|sp=us}}. Non-cooperative docking mechanisms were identified as critical mission elements to the success of such autonomous missions.&lt;ref name=nasa20100525/&gt;

[[Grapple Fixture|Grappling]] and connecting to non-cooperative space objects was identified as a top technical challenge in the 2010 NASA Robotics, tele-robotics and autonomous systems roadmap.&lt;ref name=nasa201011&gt;{{cite web|last=Ambrose|first=Rob|title=Robotics, Tele-Robotics and Autonomous systems Roadmap (Draft)|url=http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/501622main_TA04-Robotics-DRAFT-Nov2010-A.pdf|date=November 2010|publisher=NASA|accessdate=2012-06-25|quote=''A smaller common docking system for robotic spacecraft is also needed to enable robotic spacecraft AR&amp;D within the capture envelopes of these systems.

Development and testing of autonomous robotic capture of non-cooperative target vehicles in which the target does not have capture aids such as grapple fixtures or docking mechanisms is needed to support satellite servicing/rescue.''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Berthing spacecraft and modules==
Docking and undocking describe spacecraft using a docking port, without assistance and under their own power. Berthing takes place when a spacecraft or unpowered module cannot use a docking port or requires assistance to use one. This assistance may come from a spacecraft, such as when the [[Space Shuttle]] used its robotic arm to push ISS modules into their permanent berths. In a similar fashion the [[Poisk (ISS module)|Poisk module]] was permanently berthed to a docking port after it was pushed into place by a [[Progress M-MIM2|modified Progress spacecraft]] which was then discarded. The [[Cygnus (spacecraft)|Cygnus resupply spacecraft]] arriving at the ISS does not connect to a [[Androgynous_Peripheral_Attach_System#APAS-95|docking port]], instead it is pulled into a berthing mechanism by the station's robotic arm and the station then closes the connection. The [[common berthing mechanism|berthing mechanism]] is used only on the [[US Orbital Segment|US segment]] of the ISS, the [[Russian Orbital Segment|Russian segment]] of the ISS uses [[Androgynous_Peripheral_Attach_System#APAS-95|docking ports]] for permanent berths.

==Mars surface docking==
Docking has been discussed by NASA in regards to a [[Crewed Mars rover]], such as with [[Mars habitat]] or ascent stage.&lt;reF&gt;[https://www.nasa.gov/pdf/464826main_SEV_Concept_FactSheet.pdf]&lt;/reF&gt;

'''Electrical injury''' is a physiological reaction caused by [[electric current]] passing through the (human) body.&lt;ref name="Boon"&gt;{{cite book| last1=Boon| first1=Elizabeth| last2=Parr| first2=Rebecca| last3=20,000Dayananda| first3=Samarawickrama| title=Oxford Handbook of Dental Nursing| publisher=Oxford University Press| date=2012| location=| pages=132| language=| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dx9FAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA132&amp;dq=%22electric+shock| doi=| id=| isbn=0191629863| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170306102959/https://books.google.com/books?id=dx9FAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA132&amp;dq=%22electric+shock| archivedate=2017-03-06| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Electric shock occurs upon contact of a (human) body part with any source of [[electricity]] that causes a sufficient magnitude of current to pass through the victim's [[flesh]], [[viscera]] or [[hair]].  Physical contact with energized [[electrical wiring|wiring]] or devices is the most common cause of an electric shock. In cases of exposure to high [[voltage]]s, such as on a [[power transmission tower]], physical contact with energized wiring or objects may not be necessary to cause electric shock, as the voltage may be sufficient to "jump" the air gap between the electrical device and the victim.

The injury related to electric shock depends on the magnitude of the current. &lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Reilly|1998|p=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Very small currents may be imperceptible or produce a light tingling sensation. A shock caused by low current that would normally be harmless could startle an individual and cause injury due to suddenly jerking away from the source of electricity, resulting in one striking a stationary object, dropping an object being held or falling. Stronger currents may cause some degree of discomfort or pain, while more intense currents may induce involuntary muscle contractions, preventing the victim from breaking free of the source of electricity.&lt;ref&gt;Leslie Alexander Geddes, Rebecca A. Roeder ,''Handbook of Electrical Hazards and Accidents'' Lawyers &amp; Judges Publishing Company, 2006 {{ISBN|0913875449}},  page 29&lt;/ref&gt;  Still larger currents usually result in tissue damage and may trigger [[fibrillation#Cardiology|fibrillation]] of the heart or [[cardiac arrest]], any of which may ultimately be [[death|fatal]].  If death results from an electric shock the [[cause of death]] is generally referred to as [[electrocution]].

==Signs and symptoms==

===Burns===
[[File:Verbrennung Grad 2b.jpg|thumb|Second-degree burn after a [[high tension line]] accident]]
Heating due to [[electrical resistance|resistance]] can cause extensive and deep [[burn]]s. Voltage levels of 500 to 1000 volts tend to cause internal burns due to the large energy (which is proportional to the duration multiplied by the square of the voltage divided by resistance) available from the source. Damage due to current is through tissue heating. For most cases of high-energy electrical trauma, the Joule heating in the deeper tissues along the extremity will reach damaging temperatures in a few seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=8245107|year=1993|author1=Lee|first1=R.

J.|last3=Hammer|first3=S. M.|doi=10.1097/00004630-199309000-00007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ventricular fibrillation===
A domestic power supply voltage (110 or 230&amp;nbsp;V), 50 or 60&amp;nbsp;Hz alternating current (AC) through the chest for a fraction of a second may induce [[ventricular fibrillation]] at currents as low as {{nowrap|30 mA}}.&lt;ref name=ucsb/&gt; With direct current (DC), 300 to 500&amp;nbsp;mA is required.&lt;ref name=whitaker/&gt; If the current has a direct pathway to the heart (e.g., via a [[Catheter|cardiac catheter]] or other kind of [[electrode]]), a much lower current of less than 1&amp;nbsp;mA (AC or DC) can cause fibrillation. If not immediately treated by [[defibrillation]], fibrillation is usually lethal because all of the heart muscle fibres move independently instead of in the coordinated pulses needed to pump blood and maintain circulation. Above 200&amp;nbsp;mA, muscle contractions are so strong that the heart muscles cannot move at all, but these conditions prevent fibrillation.

===Neurological effects===
Current can cause interference with nervous control, especially over the heart and lungs.  Repeated or severe electric shock which does not lead to death has been shown to cause [[neuropathy]]. Recent research has found that functional differences in [[neural]] activation during spatial working memory and implicit learning [[oculomotor]] tasks have been identified in electrical shock victims.&lt;ref&gt;Mechanism of Electrical Injury [http://www.cetri.org/mechanism Chicago Electrical Trauma Research Institute] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150503033705/http://www.cetri.org/mechanism |date=May 3, 2015 }} Accessed April 27, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

When the current path is through the head, it appears that, with sufficient current applied, loss of consciousness almost always occurs swiftly. (This is borne out by some limited [[self-experimentation]] by early designers of the [[electric chair]]{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} and by research from the field of [[animal husbandry]], where [[electric stunning]] has been extensively studied).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grandin.com/humane/elec.stun.html Electric Stunning of Pigs and Sheep] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306103752/http://www.grandin.com/humane/elec.stun.html |date=2016-03-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arc-flash hazards===
{{main|Arc flash}}
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2008}}
[[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]] found that up to 80&amp;nbsp;percent of its electrical injuries involve thermal burns due to arcing faults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|ref=harv|url=http://standards.ieee.org/announcements/pr_FINArc.html|title=Industry Backs IEEE-NFPA Arc Flash Testing Program with Initial Donations of $1.25 Million|publisher=IEEE|date=14 July 2006|accessdate=2008-01-01|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080302213538/http://standards.ieee.org/announcements/pr_FINArc.html|archivedate=2 March 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[arc flash]] in an electrical fault produces the same type of light [[radiation]] from which electric welders protect themselves using face shields with dark glass, heavy leather gloves, and full-coverage clothing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arcflash.com.au/arc_flash_protection.php|title=Arc_flash_protection.php - Arc Flash|author=|date=|website=www.arcflash.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt; The heat produced may cause severe burns, especially on unprotected flesh.  The arc blast produced by vaporizing metallic components can break bones and damage internal organs.  The degree of hazard present at a particular location can be determined by a detailed analysis of the electrical system, and appropriate protection worn if the electrical work must be performed with the electricity on.

==Pathophysiology==

The minimum current a human can feel depends on the current type ([[alternating current|AC]] or [[direct current|DC]]) as well as [[frequency]] for AC. A person can feel at least 1 [[ampere|mA]] ([[Root mean square#Average electrical power|rms]]) of AC at 60&amp;nbsp;Hz, while at least 5 mA for DC. At around 10 milliamperes, AC current passing through the arm of a {{convert|68|kg|adj=on}} human can cause powerful muscle contractions; the victim is unable to voluntarily control muscles and cannot release an electrified object.&lt;ref&gt;John Cadick et. al (ed.) ''Electrical Safety Handbook Third Edition'', McGraw Hill,2005 {{ISBN|0-07-145772-0}}  page 1-4&lt;/ref&gt; This is known as the "let go threshold" and is a criterion for shock hazard in electrical regulations.

The current may, if it is high enough and is delivered at sufficient voltage, cause tissue damage or [[fibrillation]] which can cause cardiac arrest; {{nowrap|more than 30 mA}}&lt;ref name=ucsb&gt;[http://web.physics.ucsb.edu/~phys13CH/electrical_safety.pdf ucsb.edu - Electrical Safety Information - Physics Department, UCSB] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023060415/http://web.physics.ucsb.edu/~phys13CH/electrical_safety.pdf |date=2013-10-23 }}, 2012-01-09&lt;/ref&gt; of AC (rms, 60&amp;nbsp;Hz) or {{nowrap|300 – 500 mA}} of DC at high voltage can cause fibrillation.&lt;ref name=whitaker&gt;Clifford D. Ferris, ''Electric Shock'', chapter 22.1 in Jerry C. Whitaker (ed.)

However, the potential seriousness of the shock depends on paths through the body that the currents take.&lt;ref name=whitaker/&gt; If the [[voltage]] is less than 200&amp;nbsp;V, then the human skin, more precisely the [[stratum corneum]], is the main contributor to the impedance of the body in the case of a [[macroshock]]—the passing of current between two contact points on the skin. The characteristics of the skin are non-linear however. If the voltage is above 450–600&amp;nbsp;V, then [[dielectric breakdown]] of the skin occurs.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Reilly|1998|p=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The protection offered by the skin is lowered by [[perspiration]], and this is accelerated if electricity causes muscles to contract 
above the let-go threshold for a sustained period of time.&lt;ref name=whitaker/&gt;

If an electrical circuit is established by electrodes introduced in the body, bypassing the skin, then the potential for lethality is much higher if a circuit through the heart is established. This is known as a [[microshock]]. Currents of only 10&amp;nbsp;[[micro-|µ]]A can be sufficient to cause fibrillation in this case with a probability of 0.2%.&lt;ref name="Leitgeb2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Norbert Leitgeb|title=Safety of Electromedical Devices: Law - Risks - Opportunities|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FpSH-VM5TYkC&amp;pg=PA122|date=6 May 2010|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-3-211-99683-6|page=122|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170401235716/https://books.google.com/books?id=FpSH-VM5TYkC&amp;pg=PA122|archivedate=1 April 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Body resistance===
The voltage necessary for electrocution depends on the current through the body and the duration of the current. [[Ohm's law]] states that the current drawn depends on the resistance of the body. The resistance of human skin varies from person to person and fluctuates between different times of day. The [[NIOSH]] states "Under dry conditions, the resistance offered by the human body may be as high as 100,000 ohms. Wet or broken skin may drop the body's resistance to 1,000&amp;nbsp;ohms," adding that "high-voltage electrical energy quickly breaks down human skin, reducing the human body's resistance to 500&amp;nbsp;ohms".&lt;ref name=niosh&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/98-131/pdfs/98-131.pdf|accessdate=2008-08-16|title=Publication No. 98-131: Worker Deaths by Electrocution|publisher=[[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011191854/http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/98-131/pdfs/98-131.pdf|archivedate=2008-10-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Electrotechnical Commission]] gives the following values for the total body impedance of a hand to hand circuit for dry skin, large contact areas, 50&amp;nbsp;Hz AC currents (the columns contain the distribution of the impedance in the population [[percentile]]; for example at 100&amp;nbsp;V 50% of the population had an impedance of 1875Ω or less):&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Reilly|1998|p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Voltage-current characteristic of skin===

The voltage-current characteristic of human skin is non-linear and depends on many factors such as intensity, duration, history, and frequency of the electrical stimulus. Sweat gland activity, temperature, and individual variation also influence the voltage-current characteristic of skin. In addition to non-linearity, skin impedance exhibits asymmetric and time varying properties. These properties can be modeled with reasonable accuracy.&lt;ref name=Lochner&gt;{{cite web|url=http://repository.up.ac.za/bitstream/handle/2263/28072/dissertation.pdf?sequence=1|title=The Voltage Current Characteristic of the Human Skin|publisher=[[University of Pretoria]]|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151017084822/http://repository.up.ac.za/bitstream/handle/2263/28072/dissertation.pdf?sequence=1|archivedate=2015-10-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Resistance measurements made at low voltage using a standard [[ohmmeter]] do not accurately represent the impedance of human skin over a significant range of conditions.

For sinusoidal electrical stimulation less than 10 volts, the skin voltage-current characteristic is quasilinear. Over time, electrical characteristics can become non-linear. The time required varies from seconds to minutes, depending on stimulus, electrode placement, and individual characteristics.

Between 10 volts and about 30 volts, skin exhibits non-linear but symmetric electrical characteristics. Above 20 volts, electrical characteristics are both non-linear and symmetric. Skin conductance can increase by several orders of magnitude in milliseconds. This should not be confused with [[dielectric breakdown]], which occurs at hundreds of volts. For these reasons, current flow cannot be accurately calculated by simply applying [[Ohm's law]] using a fixed resistance model.

===Point of entry===
* [[Macroshock]]: Current across intact skin and through the body. Current from arm to arm, or between an arm and a foot, is likely to traverse the heart, therefore it is much more dangerous than current between a leg and the ground.  This type of shock by definition must pass into the body through the skin.
* [[Microshock]]: Very small current source with a pathway directly connected to the heart tissue. The shock is required to be administered from inside the skin, directly to the heart i.e. a pacemaker lead, or a guide wire, conductive catheter etc. connected to a source of current. This is a largely theoretical hazard as modern devices used in these situations include protections against such currents.

=== Lethality ===
{{original research|section|date=December 2010}}

==== Electrocution ====
The term "electrocution," coined about the time of the first use of the [[electric chair]] in 1890,{{cn|date=September 2017}} originally referred only to ''electr''ical exe''cution'' and not to accidental or suicidal electrical deaths.{{cn|date=September 2017}} However, since no English word was available for non-judicial deaths due to electric shock, the word "electrocution" eventually took over as a description of all circumstances of electrical [[death]] judicial punishment or not.{{cn|date=September 2017}}

==== Factors in lethality of electric shock ====

&lt;br /&gt;AC-1: imperceptible
&lt;br /&gt;AC-2: perceptible but no muscle reaction
&lt;br /&gt;AC-3: muscle contraction with reversible effects

&lt;br /&gt;AC-4.2: 5-50% probability of fibrillation
&lt;br /&gt;AC-4.3: over 50% probability of fibrillation]]

The lethality of an electric shock is dependent on several variables:

* Current. The higher the current, the more likely it is lethal. Since current is proportional to voltage when resistance is fixed ([[ohm's law]]), high voltage is an indirect risk for producing higher currents.
* Duration. The longer the duration, the more likely it is lethal&amp;mdash;safety switches may limit time of current flow
* Pathway. If current flows through the heart muscle, it is more likely to be lethal.
* [[High voltage]] (over about 600 volts). In addition to greater current flow, high voltage may cause dielectric breakdown at the skin, thus lowering skin resistance and allowing further increased current flow.
* [[Implant (medicine)|Medical implants]]. [[Artificial cardiac pacemaker]]s or [[implantable cardioverter-defibrillator]]s (ICD) are sensitive to very small currents.&lt;ref name="Blandford2016"&gt;{{cite book|author=Claire M.

Other issues affecting lethality are [[frequency]], which is an issue in causing cardiac arrest or muscular spasms. Very high frequency electric current causes tissue burning, but does not penetrate the body far enough to cause cardiac arrest (see [[electrosurgery]]). Also important is the pathway: if the current passes through the chest or head, there is an increased chance of death. From a main circuit or power distribution panel the damage is more likely to be internal, leading to [[cardiac arrest]].{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}  Another factor is that cardiac tissue has a [[chronaxie]] (response time) of about 3 milliseconds, so electricity at frequencies of higher than about 333&amp;nbsp;Hz requires more current to cause fibrillation than is required at lower frequencies.

The comparison between the dangers of [[alternating current]] at typical power transmission frequences (i.e., 50 or 60&amp;nbsp;Hz), and [[direct current]] has been a subject of debate ever since the [[War of Currents]] in the 1880s. Animal experiments conducted during this time suggested that alternating current was about twice as dangerous as direct current per unit of current flow (or per unit of applied voltage).

It is sometimes suggested that human lethality is most common with [[alternating current]] at 100–250&amp;nbsp;volts; however, death has occurred below this range, with supplies as low as 42 volts.&lt;ref name="OSU Physics - The Fatal Current"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Fatal Current|url=https://www.physics.ohio-state.edu/~p616/safety/fatal_current.html|website=OSU Physics|publisher=Ohio State University|accessdate=4 March 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121721091400/http://www.physics.ohio-state.edu/~p616/safety/fatal_current.html|archivedate=2 January 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Assuming a steady current flow (as opposed to a shock from a capacitor or from [[static electricity]]), shocks above 2,700&amp;nbsp;volts are often fatal, with those above 11,000&amp;nbsp;volts being usually fatal, though exceptional cases have been noted.

== Deliberate uses ==

===Medical uses===
Electric shock is also used as a medical therapy, under carefully controlled conditions:
* [[Electroconvulsive therapy]] or ECT is a psychiatric therapy for [[mental illness]]. The objective of the therapy is to induce a seizure for therapeutic effect. There is no [[Consciousness|conscious]] sensation of the electric shock because of the anesthesia used beforehand.  Convulsive therapy was introduced in 1934 by Hungarian neuropsychiatrist [[Ladislas J. Meduna]] who, believing mistakenly that [[schizophrenia]] and [[epilepsy]] were antagonistic disorders, induced seizures first with [[camphor]] and then [[metrazol]] (cardiazol).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1177/0957154X9700802908 | last1 = Berrios | first1 = G E | year = 1997 | title = The scientific origins of electroconvulsive therapy | url = | journal = History of Psychiatry | volume = 8 | issue = 29 pt 1| pages = 105–119 | pmid = 11619203 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fink-history"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fink | first1 = M | year = 1984 | title = The origins of convulsive therapy | doi = 10.1176/ajp.141.9.1034 | journal = American Journal of Psychiatry | volume = 141 | issue = 9| pages = 1034–41 | pmid = 6147103 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first patient was treated by Lucio Bini and Ugo Cerlettiin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hYdLS6qyTwUC&amp;lpg=PA129 |title=Coercion as Cure: A Critical History of Psychiatry |first=Thomas |last=Szasz |year=2007 |isbn=978-1412810500 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180102234454/https://books.google.com/books?id=hYdLS6qyTwUC&amp;lpg=PA129 |archivedate=2018-01-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ECT is generally administered three times a week for about 8-12 treatments.
* As a surgical tool for cutting or coagulation. An "Electrosurgical Unit" (or ESU) uses high currents (e.g. 10 amperes) at high frequency (e.g. 500&amp;nbsp;kHz) with various schemes of amplitude modulation to achieve the desired result - cut or coagulate - or both. These devices are safe when used correctly.
* As a treatment for fibrillation or irregular heart rhythms: see [[defibrillator]] and [[cardioversion]].
* As a method of [[pain relief]]: see [[Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulator]] (more commonly referred to as a TENS unit).
* As an [[aversive]] punishment for conditioning of developmentally delayed individuals with severe behavioral problems. This controversial skin-shock method is employed only at the [[Judge Rotenberg Educational Center]], a special needs school in Massachusetts.
* As a treatment for Hyperhidrosis with the device called [[iontophoresis]]
* As part of [[electrodiagnosis]] diagnostic tests including [[nerve conduction studies]] and [[electromyography]].
* For genetic engineering and gene delivery using a non-viral vector system [[electroporation]]

===Entertainment===
[[Image:Musée Mécanique 160.JPG|thumb|upright|Electrifying machine at [[Musée Mécanique]] that actually works with vibration&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=10550|title=Addams Family Generator - Arcade by H. Betti Industries, Inc.|author=|date=|website=www.arcade-museum.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Mild electric shocks are also used for entertainment, especially as a [[practical joke]] for example in such devices as a shocking pen or a [[shocking gum]]. However devices such as a [[joy buzzer]] and most other machines in [[amusement park]]s today only use vibration that feels somewhat like an electric shock to someone not expecting it.

===Law enforcement and personal defense===
[[Electroshock weapon]]s are [[Less-lethal weapon|incapacitant]] [[weapon]]s used for subduing a person by administering electric shock to disrupt superficial [[muscle]] functions. One type is a conductive energy device (CED), an electroshock gun popularly known by the brand name "[[Taser]]", which fires projectiles that administer the shock through a thin, flexible wire. Although they are illegal for personal use in many jurisdictions, Tasers have been marketed to the general public.&lt;ref&gt;International Association of Chiefs of Police, ''[http://www.theiacp.org/research/CuttingEdge/EMDT9Steps.pdf Electro Muscular Disruption Technology: A Nine-Step Strategy for Effective Deployment] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131210211811/http://www.theiacp.org/research/CuttingEdge/EMDT9Steps.pdf |date=December 10, 2013 }}'', 2005&lt;/ref&gt;  Other electroshock weapons such as stun guns, stun batons ("cattle prods"), and [[electroshock belt]]s administer an electric shock by direct contact.

[[Electric fence]]s are barriers that uses electric shocks to deter animals or people from crossing a boundary.  The voltage of the shock may have effects ranging from uncomfortable, to painful or even lethal.  Most electric fencing is used today for [[agricultural fencing]] and other forms of animal control purposes, though it is frequently used to enhance security of restricted areas, and there exist places where lethal voltages are used.

=== Torture ===&lt;!-- [[Electric shock torture]] redirects here --&gt;
Electric shocks are used as a method of [[torture]], since the received voltage and current can be controlled with precision and used to cause pain and fear without always visibly harming the victim's body.

Such torture uses electrodes attached to parts of the victim's body: most typically, while wires are wound around the fingers, toes, or tongue; attached to the genitals; or inserted in the vagina to provide a return circuit; the voltage source (typically some sort of prod) of precisely controllable pressure is applied to other sensitive parts of the body, such as the genitals, breasts, or head. The [[Parrilla (torture)|parrilla]] is an example of this technique. Other methods of electrical torture (such as the [[picana]]) do not use a fixed wire but the prod has two electrodes of different polarity a short distance apart so as to make a circuit through the flesh between them when it is placed on the body, thus making it easy for the operator to target the shocks accurately in the places that cause the victim most pain and distress. When the voltage and current is controlled (most typically, high voltage and low current) the victim feels the pain of electric shock but is not physically harmed. Repeated shocks to the genitals will result in the victim losing control of his or her bladder and unintentionally urinating, while extensive passage of the current through the buttocks will cause the victim to unintentionally defecate.{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}}

Advocates for the [[mental illness|mentally ill]] and some [[psychiatrist]]s such as [[Thomas Szasz]] have asserted that electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is torture when used without a ''bona fide'' medical benefit against recalcitrant or non-responsive patients. A similar argument and opposition apply to the use of painful shocks as punishment for behavior modification, a practice that is openly used only at the [[Judge Rotenberg Educational Center|Judge Rotenberg Institute]].&lt;ref name=JRC-history&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.judgerc.org/history.html | title = History and Basic Principles of JRC | last = Israel | first = Matthew | accessdate = 2007-12-22 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080118082229/http://www.judgerc.org/history.html | archivedate = 2008-01-18 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MJ2007"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.motherjones.com/news/feature/2007/09/school_of_shock.html|title=School of Shock|first=Jennifer|last=Gonnerman|publisher=[[Mother Jones Magazine]]|date=20 August 2007|accessdate=2007-12-22|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071222132030/https://www.motherjones.com/news/feature/2007/09/school_of_shock.html|archivedate=22 December 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2008/01/17/showdown_over_shock_therapy/ | title = Showdown over shock therapy | accessdate = 2008-01-26 | date = 2008-01-17 | publisher = [[The Boston Globe]] | last = Wen | first = P | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100313093523/http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2008/01/17/showdown_over_shock_therapy/ | archivedate = 2010-03-13 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Capital punishment===
{{Main|Electric chair}}
[[File:Singchair.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Electric chair]] in [[Sing Sing]]]]
Electric shock delivered by an [[electric chair]] is sometimes used as an official means of [[capital punishment]] in the United States, although its use has become rare in recent times. Although some original proponents of the electric chair considered it to be a more humane execution method than hanging, shooting, poison gassing, etc., it has now generally been replaced by [[lethal injection]]s in states that practice capital punishment.  Modern reporting has claimed that it sometimes takes several shocks to be lethal, and that the condemned person may actually catch fire before the process is complete.

Other than in parts of the [[United States]], only [[the Philippines]] reportedly has used this method, from 1926 to 1976. It was intermittently replaced by the [[firing squad]], until the death penalty was abolished in that country. Electrocution remains legal in at least 5 states (Virginia, Florida, Alabama, North Carolina and Kentucky) of the United States.{{when|date=July 2015}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/state/ Death Penalty Information Center] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150523143211/http://www.deathpenaltyinfo.org/state/ |date=May 23, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Equality Act 2010'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Equality Act 2010|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15|publisher=The National Archives|accessdate=22 September 2016|ref={{sfnref|Equality Act}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]], and has the same goals as the four major EU [[Equal Treatment Directive]]s, whose provisions it mirrors and implements.&lt;ref&gt;see [[Employment Equality Framework Directive|EU Directive 2000/78/EC]], 2000/43/EC, 2006/54/EC&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary purpose of the Act is to codify the complicated and numerous array of Acts and Regulations, which formed the basis of [[anti-discrimination law]] in Great Britain. This was, primarily, the [[Equal Pay Act 1970]], the [[Sex Discrimination Act 1975]], the [[Race Relations Act 1976]], the [[Disability Discrimination Act 1995]] and three major [[statutory instruments]] protecting discrimination in employment on grounds of [[Employment Equality (Religion or Belief) Regulations 2003|religion or belief]], [[Employment Equality (Sexual Orientation) Regulations 2003|sexual orientation]] and [[Employment Equality (Age) Regulations 2006|age]].

The Act requires equal treatment in access to employment as well as private and public services, regardless of the protected characteristics of age, [[disability]], [[sex reassignment therapy|gender reassignment]], marriage and civil partnership, race, religion or belief, [[sex]], and [[sexual orientation]]. There are special protections for pregnant women. In the case of gender reassignment, the Act does not guarantee transgender people access to single-sex services where the restrictions are "a proportionate means of achieving a legitimate aim".{{sfn|Equality Act|loc=schedule 3, part 7, para 28}} In the case of disability, employers and service providers are under a duty to make [[reasonable accommodation|reasonable adjustments]] to their workplaces to overcome barriers experienced by disabled people. In this regard, the Equality Act 2010 did not change the law. Under s.217, with [[Disability in Northern Ireland| limited exceptions]] the Act does not apply to [[Northern Ireland]].{{sfn|Equality Act|loc=s.217}}

==Background==
{{main|UK employment discrimination law}}
The [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] included a commitment to an Equality Bill in its 2005 election manifesto. The ''Discrimination Law Review'' was established in 2005 to develop the legislation and was led by the [[Government Equalities Office]]. The review considered the findings of the Equalities Review Panel, chaired by [[Trevor Phillips]], which reported in February 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.equalities.gov.uk/dlr/index.htm|title=Discrimination Law Review (DLR)|publisher=Government Equalities Office}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Act is intended to simplify the law by bringing together existing anti-discrimination legislation. The Equality Act 2010 has replaced the [[Equal Pay Act 1970]], [[Sex Discrimination Act 1975]], [[Race Relations Act 1976]], [[Disability Discrimination Act 1995]], [[Employment Equality (Religion or Belief) Regulations 2003]], [[Employment Equality (Sexual Orientation) Regulations 2003]]&lt;ref&gt;See also, [[Equality Act (Sexual Orientation) Regulations]]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Employment Equality (Age) Regulations 2006]].

[[Polly Toynbee]] wrote that the bill, which was drafted under the guidance of [[Harriet Harman]], was "Labour's biggest idea for 11 years. A public-sector duty to close the gap between rich and poor will tackle the class divide in a way that no other policy has... This new duty to narrow the gap would permeate every aspect of government policy. Its possible ramifications are mind-bogglingly immense." One cabinet member described it as "socialism in one clause".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/jan/13/polly-toynbee-harriet-harman-social-mobility guardian.co.uk: "Harman's law is Labour's biggest idea for 11 years"] (Toynbee) 13 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Sections 104–105 of the Act extend until 2030 the exemption from sex discrimination law, which allows political parties to create [[all-women shortlist]]s.&lt;ref name=equalityhumanrights-2011&gt;{{cite book |pages=179-182 |url=https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/sites/default/files/servicescode_0.pdf |title=Equality Act 2010 Statutory Code of Practice - Services, public functions and associations |isbn=9780108509728 |publisher=Equality and Human Rights Commission |year=2011 |accessdate=15 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exemption was previously permitted by the [[Sex Discrimination (Election Candidates) Act 2002]].

The Parliamentary process was completed, following a debate, shortly after 11&amp;nbsp;pm on 6 April 2010, when amendments by the House of Lords were accepted in full.&lt;ref&gt;See the debate in Hansard HC vol 508 [https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmhansrd/cm100406/debtext/100406-0021.htm#1004073000001 cols 927-942] (6 April 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debate==
===Reform of the monarchy===
In April 2008, [[Solicitor General for England and Wales|Solicitor General]] [[Vera Baird]] announced that as part of the Single Equality Bill, legislation would be introduced to repeal parts of the [[Act of Settlement 1701]] that prevent [[Roman Catholics]] or those who marry Roman Catholics from ascending to the throne, and to change the inheritance of the monarchy from [[Primogeniture#Cognatic primogeniture|cognatic primogeniture]] to [[Primogeniture#Absolute primogeniture|absolute primogeniture]], so that the first-born heir would inherit the throne regardless of gender or religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/7357017.stm|accessdate=21 April 2008|title=Move to change succession laws|date=20 April 2008|publisher=[[bbc.co.uk]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, later in 2008 the Attorney General [[Patricia Scotland, Baroness Scotland of Asthal|Baroness Scotland of Asthal]] decided not to sponsor a change in the law of succession, saying, "To bring about changes to the law on succession would be a complex undertaking involving amendment or repeal of a number of items of related legislation, as well as requiring the consent of legislatures of member nations of the Commonwealth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/newstopics/theroyalfamily/1905565/U-turn-on-royal-succession-law-change.html|title=U-turn on royal succession law change|author=Andrew Pierce|publisher=The Telegraph|date=29 April 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The published draft bill did not contain any provisions to change the succession laws. Cognatic primogeniture for the British monarchy was instead abolished separately three years after the Equality Act came into force, with the enactment of the [[Succession to the Crown Act 2013]].

===Opposition by bishops===
Although the act was never going to change the law with regard to churches from its existing position, nor change the binding European Union law which covers many more Roman Catholics than those living in the United Kingdom, and although the position had been spelled out in the High Court in ''[[R (Amicus) v Secretary of State for Trade and Industry]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[2004] [http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2004/860.html EWHC 860 (Admin)]&lt;/ref&gt; a small number of Roman Catholic bishops in England and Wales made claims that they might in future be prosecuted under the Equality Act 2010 for refusing to allow women, married men, transsexual people, and gay people into the priesthood.&lt;ref name="thebostonpilot1"&gt;[http://www.thebostonpilot.com/article.asp?ID=11224 English, Welsh bishops say Equality Bill redefines who can be priest]{{dead link|date=October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cathnews.com/article.aspx?aeid=18231 |title=Equality Bill redefines who can be priest: UK Bishops |publisher=Cathnews.com |date=10 December 2009 |accessdate=3 June 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100103215847/http://cathnews.com/article.aspx?aeid=18231 |archivedate=3 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Kirsty Walker |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1228643/Christmas-killed-Harmans-Equality-Bill-bishops-warn.html |title=Christmas could be killed off by Harman's Equality Bill, bishops warn |publisher=Dailymail.co.uk |date= 18 November 2009|accessdate=3 June 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This claim was rejected by the government.  A spokesman said an exemption in the law "covers ministers of religion such as Catholic priests"&lt;ref name="thebostonpilot1"/&gt; and a document released by the Government Equalities Office states that "the Equality Bill will not change the existing legal position regarding churches and employment".&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |url=http://www.equalities.gov.uk/pdf/Equality%20Bill%20and%20Religion%20for%20press%20and%20website%20(3).pdf |title=Myth-Busting: the Equality Bill and Religion |accessdate=10 January 2010 |format=PDF |publisher=Government Equalities Office |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5mfNU5Tok?url=http://www.equalities.gov.uk/pdf/Equality%20Bill%20and%20Religion%20for%20press%20and%20website%20%283%29.pdf |archivedate=10 January 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}  ''In the case of Ministers of Religion and other jobs which exist to promote and represent religion, the Bill recognises that a church may need to impose requirements regarding sexual orientation, sex, marriage and civil partnership or gender reassignment if it is necessary to comply with its teachings or the strongly held beliefs of followers. However, it would not be right to permit such requirements across all jobs within organised religions, such as administrators and accountants, and the Equality Bill makes this clear.''&lt;/ref&gt;  The legislation was also criticised by Anglican clergy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.religiousintelligence.co.uk/news/?NewsID=5374 UK Government attacked over Equality Bil] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141014070515/http://www.religiousintelligence.co.uk/news/?NewsID=5374 |date=14 October 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Exempt occupations==
{{refimprove section|date = December 2017}}
Certain employment is exempted from the act, including:

*Priests, monks, nuns, rabbis and ministers of religion.
*Actors and models in the film, television and fashion industries (a [[British Chinese]] actress for a specific role, for instance).
*Special employment training programmes aimed at ethnic minorities, ex-offenders, young adults, the long term unemployed, or people with physical or learning disabilities.
*Employment where there are cultural sensitivities (such as a documentary where male victims of domestic violence need to be interviewed by a male researcher, or a gay men's domestic violence helpline).
*Where safety or operational efficiency could be jeopardised.
*Political parties who use 'protected characteristics' (age, race, religion, sex, sexual orientation)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/en/equality-act/protected-characteristics|title=Protected characteristics {{!}} Equality and Human Rights Commission|website=www.equalityhumanrights.com|access-date=2018-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; as candidate selection criteria; though these 'Selection arrangements do not include short-listing only such persons as have a particular protected characteristic'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2010/15/part/7/crossheading/special-provision-for-political-parties|title=Equality Act 2010|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|language=en|others=Expert Participation|access-date=2018-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;--other than sex,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/en/advice-and-guidance/sex-discrimination|title=Sex discrimination {{!}} Equality and Human Rights Commission|website=www.equalityhumanrights.com|access-date=2018-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; which may still be used to prejudice selection in some circumstances (e.g. all-women/all-men shortlists).
*Local support staff who work in embassies and high commissions, by virtue of [[diplomatic immunity]].

A '''figure of merit''' is a quantity used to characterize the performance of a device, system or method, relative to its alternatives.

==Examples==
*[[Clock rate]] of a [[CPU]]
*[[Calorie]]s per serving
*[[Contrast ratio]] of an [[LCD]]
*[[Frequency response]] of a [[Loudspeaker|speaker]]
*[[Fill factor (solar cell)|Fill factor]] of a [[solar cell]]
*[[Image resolution|Resolution]] of the [[image sensor]] in a [[digital camera]]
*Measure of the detection performance of a [[sonar]] system, defined as the [[propagation loss]] for which a 50% detection probability is achieved
*[[Noise figure]] of a radio receiver
*The [[thermoelectric figure of merit]], ''Z'', a material constant proportional to the efficiency of a thermoelectric couple made with the material
*The figure of merit of [[digital-to-analog converter]], calculated as (power dissipation)/(2&lt;sup&gt;ENOB&lt;/sup&gt; × effective bandwidth) [J/Hz]
*[[Luminous efficacy]] of [[lighting]]
*[[Profit (accounting)|Profit]] of a [[company]]
*Battery life of a [[laptop computer]] &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/25/technology/personaltech/25pogue.html Decoding Battery Life For Laptops] New York Times, June 25, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;
*Heat absorption and transfer quality for a [[solar cooker]]
*[[Amplifier figures of merit]]

[[Benchmark (computing)|Benchmark]]s are synthetic figures of merit that summarize the speed of computers in performing various typical tasks.

== Modulation systems==
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2013}}
In modulation systems for communication, figure of merit of a device means the noise figure&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;).

=== Amplitude modulation ===
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2013}}
Figure of merit for [[amplitude modulation]] (AM) is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{\frac{(SNR)_{O,AM}}{(SNR)_{C,AM}}}=\frac{k_a^2P}{1+k_a^2P}
&lt;/math&gt;

Figure of merit for [[Double-sideband suppressed-carrier transmission|double-sideband suppressed-carrier]] (DSB-SC) receiver or that of a [[Single-sideband modulation|single-sideband]] (SSB) modulation is always unity. Therefore, noise performance of AM receiver is inferior to that of a DSB-SC receiver or an SSB receiver.

=== Frequency modulation ===
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2013}}
Figure of merit for [[frequency modulation]] is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{\frac{(SNR)_{O,FM}}{(SNR)_{C,FM}}}=\frac{3k_f^2P}{W^2}
&lt;/math&gt;

==Deception==
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2013}}
The precision and verifiability of numbers sometimes make them a more effective sales tool than vague and non-numeric descriptions such as "state of the art" or "leaves the others in the dust".  When used in [[deceptive advertising]], the deception lies more in the question of relevance rather than truth since the number quoted, as a figure of merit may not be enough to determine performance when comparing products. For example, when purchasing a laptop a consumer could choose on the basis of the capacity of its hard drive. The [[Revolutions per minute|RPM]], [[Disk buffer|buffer]], and [[seek time]]s may not be noted, but may significantly affect performance.

Some figures such as [[Audio power#PMPO|peak music power]] are used in selling consumer merchandise and have the principal merit of yielding high numbers that can impress people who don't know what the numbers mean.  Other figures such as [[Specific fuel consumption (thrust)|specific fuel consumption]] are addressed to engineers and other studious buyers whom the sellers dare not mislead.

Another example is the [[megapixel]] count of a [[digital camera]]. A consumer unaware that the number of pixels on a sensor is only one factor in the quality of the image that is captured may, for example, buy a camera with more pixels squeezed onto a smaller [[image sensor]], thus losing quality to the small pixel size.&lt;ref&gt;Monkman, Jerry: Outdoor Digital Photography; 2011, Appalachian Mountain Club&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Makers of cheap, consumer-market [[optical telescope|telescopes]] often tout the magnification power of their products, sidestepping the fact that [[aperture]], optical quality, and the type and quality of the telescope's mount are more important for obtaining a quality image.

In [[United States trademark law]], the '''functionality doctrine''' prevents [[manufacturer]]s from protecting specific features of a product by means of [[trademark]] law.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/functionality_doctrine_trademark Functionality doctrine] at [[Wex]], from the [[Legal Information Institute]]&lt;/ref&gt;  There are two branches of the functionality doctrine: utilitarian functionality and aesthetic functionality. The rationale behind functionality doctrine is that product markets would not be truly competitive if newcomers could not make a product with a feature that consumers demand. Utilitarian functionality provides grounds to deny federal trademark protection to product features which do something useful.  Patent law, not trademark, protects useful processes, [[machine]]s, and material [[invention]]s.  Patented designs are presumed to be functional until proven otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;''[[TrafFix Devices, Inc. v. Marketing Displays, Inc.]]'', 532 U.S. 23 (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;  Aesthetic functionality  provides grounds to deny trademark protection to design features which are included to make the product more aesthetically appealing and commercially desirable.  Aesthetic features are within the purview of [[copyright]] law, which provides protection to creative and original works of authorship.&lt;ref&gt;{{UnitedStatesCode|17|102}}(a)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Utilitarian Functionality==

Courts will look to the following factors when determining utilitarian functionality:
* Whether a feature is essential to the use or purpose of the product; or
* Whether a feature affects the cost or quality of the product; or
* Whether granting of trademark for the exclusive use of the feature would put competitors at a significant non-reputation related disadvantage&lt;ref&gt;''[[Qualitex v. Jacobson Products]]'', 514 U.S. 159 (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2014 the federal circuit courts are split on their utilitarian functionality analysis. Most circuits, such as the Fifth Circuit&lt;ref&gt;''[[German Eppendorf-Netheler-Hinz GMBH v. Ritter GMBH]]'', 289 F.3d 351 (5th Cir. 2002)&lt;/ref&gt; and the Sixth Circuit&lt;ref&gt;''[[Antioch Co. v. Western Trimming Corp.]]'', 347 F.3d 150 (6th Cir. 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; follow the Supreme Court's analysis in ''[[TrafFix Devices, Inc. v. Marketing Displays, Inc.]]'',&lt;ref&gt;532 U.S. 23 (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; which focuses on whether the feature is essential to the use or purpose of the product. The Federal Circuit in contrast focuses its analysis on whether permitting a product feature to be trademarked would impair competitors.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Valu Engineering v. Rexnord Corp]]'', 278 F.3d 1268 (Fed. Cir. 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aesthetic Functionality==
In the United States, the “functionality” doctrine exists to stop a party from obtaining exclusive trade dress or trademark rights in the functional features of a product or its packaging. The doctrine developed as a way to preserve the division between what trademark law protects and areas that are better protected by patent or copyright law. Thus, the functionality doctrine serves to prevent trademark owners from inhibiting legitimate competition &lt;ref&gt;http://www.inta.org/INTABulletin/Pages/AestheticFunctionalityAfterLouboutin.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

When the aesthetic development of the good is intended to enhance the design and make the product more commercially desirable, trademark protection may be denied because the consumer is drawn to the design. The distinctiveness of the mark serves to identify the product rather than the source, and trademark protection becomes inappropriate. The underlying theory as aesthetics become integrated with functionality, the resulting product strongly resembles product design, which may receive no trademark protection absent secondary meaning.&lt;ref&gt;Christian Louboutin S.A. v. Yves Saint Laurent America, Inc., 778 F. Supp. 2d 445, 447–48 (S.D.N.Y. 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

This defense is generally seen in the fashion industry. Clothing brands can only be protected if they've acquired secondary meaning, and most of clothing design is held to be functional and is afforded no protection.&lt;ref&gt;https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/529/205/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Intersex''' people are born with variations in physical and [[sex characteristics]] including those of the [[chromosome]]s, [[gonad]]s, [[sex hormones]], or [[genital]]s that, according to the UN [[Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights]], "do not fit the typical definitions for [[male]] or [[female]] bodies".&lt;ref name="un-2016"&gt;{{Cite| last1 = UN Committee against Torture | author1-link = United Nations Convention against Torture#Committee against Torture | last2 = UN Committee on the Rights of the Child | author2-link = Committee on the Rights of the Child  | last3 = UN Committee on the Rights of People with Disabilities | author3-link = Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities | last4 = UN Subcommittee on Prevention of Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment | last5 = Juan Méndez, Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment | author5-link = Juan E.

== Preimplantation genetic diagnosis ==
{{further|Preimplantation genetic diagnosis}}
Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD or PIGD) refers to [[Genetics|genetic]] evaluation of [[embryo]]s and [[oocyte]]s prior to [[Implantation (human embryo)|implantation]]. When used to screen for a specific genetic condition, the method also makes it possible to select embryos with intersex conditions for termination. Some national authorities, such as the UK Human Fertilization and Embryology Authority, maintain lists of conditions for which PGD is permissible, including intersex conditions such as [[5 alpha reductase deficiency]], [[androgen insensitivity syndrome]], [[congenital adrenal hyperplasia]] and others.&lt;ref name="hfea" /&gt;

[[intersex medical interventions|Surgical interventions]] on children with intersex conditions are contentious and may lead to selection for other traits like same sex attraction.&lt;ref name="sparrow2013"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1080/15265161.2013.828115| issn = 1526-5161 | volume = 13| issue = 10| pages = 29–38| last = Sparrow| first = Robert| title = Gender Eugenics?

He concluded that the acceptability of elimination of intersex conditions has "uncomfortable" implications for "other nonpathological human variations" that do not affect physical health.&lt;ref name="sparrow2013" /&gt;

[[Organisation Intersex International Australia]] has quoted research showing [[Abortion|pregnancy termination]] rates of up to 88% in [[Klinefelter syndrome|47,XXY]] even while the [[World Health Organization]] describes the trait as "compatible with normal life expectancy", and "often undiagnosed".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Radicioni|first1=A F|last2=Ferlin|first2=A|last3=Balercia|first3=G|last4=Pasquali|first4=D|last5=Vignozzi|first5=L|last6=Maggi|first6=M|last7=Foresta|first7=C|last8=Lenzi|first8=A|date=2010|title=Consensus statement on diagnosis and clinical management of Klinefelter syndrome|journal=[[Journal of Endocrinological Investigation]]|volume=33|pages=839–850}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.who.int/genomics/gender/en/index1.html|title=Gender and Genetics|work=[[World Health Organization]] Genomic resource centre|access-date=April 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, it called for the Australian [[National Health and Medical Research Council]] to prohibit such interventions, noting a "close entanglement of intersex status, gender identity and sexual orientation in social understandings of sex and gender norms, and in medical and medical sociology literature".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite report|url=http://oii.org.au/25621/submission-ethics-genetic-selection-intersex-traits/|title=Submission on the Review of Part B of the Ethical Guidelines for the Use of Assisted Reproductive Technology in Clinical Practice and Research, 2007|last1=Carpenter|first1=Morgan|author2=Organisation Intersex International Australia|date=April 30, 2014|location=Sydney|author2-link=Organisation Intersex International Australia|work=Organisation Intersex International Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the organization wrote about the sponsorship of lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and intersex ([[LGBTI]]) events by IVF clinics in Australia, stating that, in addition to ethical issues raised by the elimination of intersex traits, "sponsorship of "LGBTI" events by such businesses raises more ethical issues still, including the nature of community and comprehension of issues relating to intersex bodily diversity".&lt;ref name="oii2016"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://oii.org.au/30555/sponsorship-elimination-intersex-traits/|title=LGBTI sponsorship and the elimination of intersex traits|last=Organisation Intersex International Australia|author-link=Organisation Intersex International Australia|date=July 10, 2016|accessdate=2017-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to Sparrow, [[Georgiann Davis]] argues that such discrimination fails to recognize that many people with intersex traits led full and happy lives, and that the "intersex community is only "invisible" to those who choose to ignore it", while "the medical profession, not the intersex trait itself, is a major source of the social and psychological harm that perpetuates intersex stigmatization and the "hostile social environment" that individuals with intersex traits encounter".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1080/15265161.2013.828119| issn = 1526-5161| volume = 13| issue = 10| pages = 51–53| last = Davis| first = Georgiann| author-link=Georgiann Davis|title = The Social Costs of Preempting Intersex Traits| journal = The American Journal of Bioethics| date = October 2013| url = http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15265161.2013.828119| pmid=24024811}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jeff Nisker links the elimination of intersex conditions to their pathologization, describing how "[o]nce a difference becomes a medical disorder to which the medical profession is dedicating time and resources to prevent, procedures to this end become endowed with appropriateness".&lt;ref name="nisker"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Nisker Jeff | year = 2013 | title = Informed Choice and PGD to Prevent "Intersex Conditions" | doi = 10.1080/15265161.2013.828125 | pmid = 24024809 | journal = The American Journal of Bioethics | volume = 13 | issue = 10| pages = 47–49 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the [[Council of Europe]] published an Issue Paper on ''Human rights and intersex people'', remarking on a right to life:

{{quotation|Intersex people's right to life can be violated in discriminatory "sex selection" and "preimplantation genetic diagnosis, other forms of testing, and selection for particular characteristics".

[[Alice Dreger]], Ellen Feder, and [[Anne Tamar-Mattis]] describe how research published by Saroj Nimkarn and [[Maria New]] in 2010 constructs "low interest in babies and men – and even interest in what they consider to be men's occupations and games – as "abnormal", and potentially preventable with prenatal dexamethasone".&lt;ref name="nimkarn2010" /&gt; The authors state that "weak and unsupported conclusions" of investigations into the attempted "prevention of benign behavioral sex variations" indicates gaps in the ethical management of clinical research.&lt;ref name="dreger2012"&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1007/s11673-012-9384-9| issn = 1176-7529| volume = 9| issue = 3| pages = 277–294| last1 = Dreger| first1 = Alice| last2 = Feder| first2 = Ellen K.| last3 = Tamar-Mattis| first3 = Anne| author1-link = Alice Dreger | author3-link = Anne Tamar-Mattis | title = Prenatal Dexamethasone for Congenital Adrenal Hyperplasia: An Ethics Canary in the Modern Medical Mine| journal = Journal of Bioethical Inquiry| date = September 2012 | url = https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s11673-012-9384-9| pmc = 3416978}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Hirvikoski and others described a lack of long-term follow-up studies of individuals exposed to prenatal treatment, and the results of a 10-year Swedish study of 43 mothers and children. The authors found evidence of unacceptable side-effects in their study, including neurological consequences. Treatment with dexamethasone was discontinued in Sweden.&lt;ref name="hirvik2012" /&gt;

{{Royal and noble ranks}}

'''Gentry''' (from [[Old French]] ''genterie'', from ''gentil'', "high-born, noble") are "well-born, genteel and well-bred people" of high [[social class]], especially in the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution = Gentry | contribution-url = http://dictionary.cambridge.org/define.asp?key=32548&amp;dict=CALD | publisher=  Cambridge | title = Advanced Learner's Dictionary}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution = Gentry | contribution-url = http://www.askoxford.com:80/concise_oed/gentry?view=ukCompact | publisher = Oxford | title = English Dictionary}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United Kingdom]], the term ''gentry'' refers to the [[landed gentry]], the majority of the land-owning social class who were typically [[coat of arms|armigerous]] (having a coat of arms), but did not have [[titles of nobility]]. ''Gentry'', in its widest connotation, refers to people of good social position connected to [[landed estate]]s (see [[manorialism]]), upper levels of the [[clergy]], and "gentle" families of long descent who never obtained the official right to bear a [[coat of arms]].  The historical term ''gentry'' by itself, so [[Peter Coss]] argues, is a construct that historians have applied loosely to rather different societies. Any particular model may not fit a specific society, yet a single definition nevertheless remains desirable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.ac.uk/reviews/review/402 Michael Hicks, review of The Origins of the English Gentry, (review no. 402)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://assets.cambridge.org/97805210/21005/frontmatter/9780521021005_frontmatter.pdf Cambridge University Press 0521021006 - The Origins of the English Gentry Peter Coss]&lt;/ref&gt; Linguistically, the word ''gentry'' arose to identify the [[Social stratification|social stratum]] created by the very small number, by the standards of Continental Europe, of the [[Peerage of England]], and of the parts of Britain, where nobility and titles are inherited by a single person, rather than the family, as usual in Europe.  

Before creation of the gentry, there were analogous traditional social elites. The adjective ''[[Patrician (post-Roman Europe)|patrician]]'' ("of or like a person of high social rank")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| work = Dictionary | url= http://dictionary.cambridge.org/search/british/?q=patrician |title=Patrician| publisher = Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt; describes the governing elites in a medieval metropolis, such as those of the [[City-state|free cities]] of Italy ([[Venice]] and [[Genoa]]), and the [[Free imperial city|free imperial cities]] of Germany and Switzerland, and the [[Hanseatic League]], which were different from the gentry.{{Efn | Following the admired example of the [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|Roman patrician]], the Venetian patrician reverted, especially in the [[Renaissance]], to a life more focused on his rural estate.}}

== Historical background of social stratification in the West==
[[Image:Three kings or three gods.jpg|thumbg|left|thumb|This part of a 12th-century Swedish tapestry has been interpreted to show, from left to right, the one-eyed [[Odin]], the hammer-wielding [[Thor]] and [[Freyr]]. This [[Triple deities|triad]] corresponds closely to the trifunctional division: Odin is the patron of priests and magicians, Thor of warriors, and Freyr of fertility and farming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Leiren, Terje I. |year=1999 |title=From Pagan to Christian: The Story in the 12th-Century Tapestry of the Skog Church |url=http://faculty.washington.edu/leiren/vikings2.html |publisher=Facutly.washington.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Indo-Europeans]] who settled [[Europe]], [[Western Asia]] and the [[Indian subcontinent]] conceived their societies to be ordered (not divided) in a tripartite fashion, the three parts being castes.&lt;ref&gt;Mallory, J.P. ''In search of the Indo-Europeans'' Thames &amp; Hudson (1991) p131&lt;/ref&gt; Castes came to be further divided, perhaps as a result of greater specialisation.

The "classic" formulation of the caste system as largely described by [[Georges Dumézil]] was that of a priestly or religiously occupied caste, a warrior caste, and a worker caste. Dumézil divided the [[Proto-Indo-European society|Proto-Indo-Europeans]] into three categories: [[sovereignty]], [[military]], and productivity (see [[Trifunctional hypothesis]]). He further subdivided [[sovereignty]] into two distinct and complementary sub-parts. One part was formal, juridical, and priestly, but rooted in this world. The other was powerful, unpredictable, and also priestly, but rooted in the "other", the supernatural and spiritual world. The second main division was connected with the use of force, the [[military]], and war. Finally, there was a third group, ruled by the other two, whose role was productivity: herding, farming, and [[crafts]].

This system of caste roles can be seen in the castes which flourished on the Indian subcontinent and amongst the [[Italic peoples]].

Examples of the Indo-European castes:
* '''Indo-Iranian''' – [[Brahmin]]/Athravan, [[Kshatriyas]]/Rathaestar, [[Vaishyas]]
* '''Roman''' – [[Flamen|Flamines]], [[Milites]], [[Quirites]]
* '''Celtic''' – [[Druid]]s, [[Equites]], [[Plebs|Plebes]] (according to [[Julius Caesar]])
* '''Anglo-Saxon''' – Gebedmen (prayer-men), Fyrdmen (army-men), Weorcmen (workmen) (according to [[Alfred the Great]])
* '''Slavic ''' – Volkhvs, Voin, Krestyanin/Smerd
* '''Nordic''' – [[Earl]], [[Churl]], [[Thrall]] (according to the [[Poetic Edda|Lay of Rig]])
* '''Greece (Attica)''' – [[Eupatridae]], [[Geomori]], [[Demiurge|Demiurgi]]
* '''Greece (Sparta)''' – [[Spartiate|Homoioi]], [[Perioeci]], [[Helots]]

Kings were born out of the warrior or noble class.

[[File:Europe 1000.jpg|thumb|[[Europe]] and the [[Byzantine Empire]] AD 1000]]

[[Emperor Constantine]] [[convoke]]d the [[First Council of Nicaea]] in 325 whose [[Nicene Creed]] included belief in "one holy catholic and apostolic Church". Emperor [[Theodosius I]] made [[First Council of Nicaea|Nicene]] Christianity the [[state church of the Roman Empire]] with the [[Edict of Thessalonica]] of 380.&lt;ref&gt;Boyd, William Kenneth (1905). ''The Ecclesiastical Edicts of the Theodosian Code'', Columbia University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the fall of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century, there emerged no single powerful secular government in the West, but there was a central ecclesiastical power in Rome, the Catholic Church. In this power vacuum, the Church rose to become the dominant power in the [[Western Roman Empire|West]].

In essence, the earliest vision of Christendom was a vision of a Christian [[theocracy]], a [[government]] founded upon and upholding [[Christian values]], whose institutions are spread through and over with [[Christian doctrine]]. The [[Catholic Church]]'s peak of authority over all European Christians and their common endeavours of the Christian community—for example, the [[Crusades]], the fight against the [[Moors]] in the [[Iberian Peninsula]] and against the [[Ottomans]] in the [[Balkans]]—helped to develop a sense of communal identity against the obstacle of Europe's deep political divisions.

The classical heritage flourished throughout the Middle Ages in both the [[Byzantine]] [[Greek East and Latin West]]. In [[Plato]]'s ideal state there are three major classes (producers, auxiliaries and guardians), which was representative of the idea of the "[[Chariot Allegory|tripartite soul]]", which is expressive of three functions or capacities of the human soul: "appetites" (or "passions"), "the spirited element" and "reason" the part that must guide the soul to truth. [[Will Durant]] made a convincing case that certain prominent features of Plato's [[The Republic (Plato)|ideal community]] were discernible in the organization, dogma and effectiveness of "the" Medieval Church in Europe:&lt;ref name="Durant"&gt;{{cite book |first=Will |last=Durant |year=2005 |title=Story of Philosophy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=suLI7RoaBEEC&amp;pg=PA34 |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |isbn=978-0-671-69500-2 |accessdate=10 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;For a thousand years Europe was ruled by an order of guardians considerably like that which was visioned by our philosopher. During the Middle Ages it was customary to classify the population of Christendom into laboratores (workers), bellatores (soldiers), and oratores (clergy). The last group, though small in number, monopolized the instruments and opportunities of culture, and ruled with almost unlimited sway half of the most powerful continent on the globe. The clergy, like Plato's guardians, were placed in authority ... by their talent as shown in ecclesiastical studies and administration, by their disposition to a life of meditation and simplicity, and ... by the influence of their relatives with the powers of state and church. In the latter half of the period in which they ruled [800 AD onwards], the clergy were as free from family cares as even Plato could desire [for such guardians] ... [Clerical] Celibacy was part of the psychological structure of the power of the clergy; for on the one hand they were unimpeded by the narrowing egoism of the family, and on the other their apparent superiority to the call of the flesh added to the awe in which lay sinners held them. ...&lt;ref name="Durant"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[Gaetano Mosca]] wrote on the same subject matter in his book The Ruling Class concerning the Medieval Church and its structure that

Beyond the fact that Clerical celibacy functioned as a spiritual discipline it also was guarantor of the independence of the Church.&lt;ref name="First Things"&gt;{{cite web |work=[[First Things]]|url=http://www.firstthings.com/article/2014/01/celibacy-as-political-resistance|title=Celibacy as Political Resistance |date= January 2014 |accessdate= 7 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
&lt;blockquote&gt;the Catholic Church has always aspired to a preponderant share in political power, it has never been able to monopolize it entirely, because of two traits, chiefly, that are basic in its structure. Celibacy has generally been required of the clergy and of monks. Therefore no real dynasties of abbots and bishops have ever been able to establish themselves. ... Secondly, in spite of numerous examples to the contrary supplied by the warlike Middle Ages, the ecclesiastical calling has by its very nature never been strictly compatible with the bearing of arms. The precept that exhorts the Church to abhor bloodshed has never dropped completely out of sight, and in relatively tranquil and orderly times it has always been very much to the fore.&lt;ref name="Mosca"&gt;{{cite book |first=Gaetano|last=Mosca|year=1939 |title=The Ruling Class|url=https://archive.org/details/rulingclass031748mbp|publisher=McGraw Hill Book Company, Inc.|accessdate=3 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Two principal estates of the realm===

The fundamental social structure in Europe in the [[Middle Ages]] was between the [[Hierarchy of the Catholic Church|ecclesiastical hierarchy]], nobles i.e. the tenants in chivalry (counts, barons, knights, esquires, [[franklin (class)|franklins]]) and the ignobles, the [[Serfdom#Villeins|villeins]], citizens, and [[Burgess (title)|burgesses]]. The division of society into classes of nobles and ignobles, in the smaller regions of medieval Europe was inexact. After the [[Reformation|Protestant Reformation]], social intermingling between the noble class and the hereditary clerical upper class became a feature in the monarchies of [[Nordic countries]].
The gentility is primarily formed on the bases of the medieval societies' two higher estates of the realm, [[nobility]] and [[clergy]], both exempted from taxation. Subsequent "gentle" families of long descent who never obtained official rights to bear a coat of arms were also admitted to the rural upper-class society: the gentry.

'''The three estates'''

The widespread three estates order was particularly characteristic of France:
* First estate included the group of all clergy, that is, members of the higher clergy and the lower clergy.
* Second estate has been encapsulated by the nobility. Here too, it did not matter whether they came from a lower or higher nobility or if they were impoverished members.
* Third estate included all nominally free citizens; in some places, free peasants.

At the top of the pyramid were the princes and estates of the king or emperor, or with the clergy, the bishops and the pope.

The feudal system was, for the people of the Middle Ages and early modern period, fitted into a God-given order. The nobility and the third estate were born into their class, and change in social position was slow. Wealth had little influence on what estate one belonged to. The exception was the Medieval Church, which was the only institution where competent men (and women) of merit could reach, in one lifetime, the highest positions in society.

The first estate comprised the entire clergy, traditionally divided into "higher" and "lower" clergy. Although there was no formal demarcation between the two categories, the upper clergy were, effectively, clerical nobility, from the families of the second estate or as in the case of [[Cardinal Wolsey]], from more humble backgrounds.

The second estate was the nobility. Being wealthy or influential did not automatically make one a noble, and not all nobles were wealthy and influential (aristocratic families have lost their fortunes in various ways, and the concept of the "poor nobleman" is almost as old as nobility itself). Countries without a feudal tradition did not have a nobility as such.

[[File:Mittelalterliches Ständebild 15. Jahrhundert.png|left|thumb|The traditional [[social stratification]] of the [[Western world]] in the 15th century]] The nobility of a person might be either inherited or earned. Nobility in its most general and strict sense is an acknowledged preeminence that is hereditary: legitimate descendants (or all male descendants, in some societies) of nobles are nobles, unless explicitly stripped of the privilege. The terms ''aristocrat'' and ''aristocracy'' are a less formal means to refer to persons belonging to this [[social environment|social milieu]].

Historically in some cultures, members of an upper class often did not have to work for a living, as they were supported by earned or inherited investments (often real estate), although members of the upper class may have had less actual money than merchants. Upper-class status commonly derived from the social position of one's family and not from one's own achievements or wealth. Much of the population that comprised the upper class consisted of aristocrats, ruling families, [[Royal and noble ranks|titled people]], and religious hierarchs. These people were usually born into their status, and historically, there was not much movement across class boundaries. This is to say that it was much harder for an individual to move up in class simply because of the structure of society.

In many countries, the term ''upper class'' was intimately associated with hereditary land ownership and titles. Political power was often in the hands of the landowners in many pre-industrial societies (which was one of the causes of the French Revolution), despite there being no legal barriers to land ownership for other social classes. Power began to shift from upper-class landed families to the general population in the [[Early modern Europe|early modern age]], leading to marital alliances between the two groups, providing the foundation for the modern upper classes in the West. Upper-class landowners in Europe were often also members of the titled nobility, though not necessarily: the prevalence of titles of nobility varied widely from country to country. Some upper classes were almost entirely untitled, for example, the [[Szlachta]] of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth.

Before the Age of [[Absolutism (European history)|Absolutism]], institutions, such as the church, legislatures, or social elites,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.sunysuffolk.edu/westn/absolutism.html|title=French Absolutism |accessdate=2007-09-29|work=SUNY Suffolk history department}}&lt;/ref&gt; restrained monarchical power. Absolutism was characterized by the ending of feudal partitioning, consolidation of power with the monarch, rise of state, rise of professional standing armies, professional bureaucracies, the codification of state laws, and the rise of ideologies that justify the absolutist monarchy. Hence, Absolutism was made possible by new innovations and characterized as a phenomenon of [[Early Modern Europe]], rather than that of the Middle Ages, where the clergy and nobility counterbalanced as a result of mutual rivalry.

===Continental Europe===
====Baltic====
{{main article|Baltic Germans|Baltic nobility}}
From the middle of the 1860s the privileged position of [[Baltic Germans]] in the Russian Empire began to waver. Already during the reign of [[Nicholas I of Russia|Nicholas I]] (1825–55), who was under pressure from Russian nationalists, some sporadic steps had been taken towards the russification of the provinces. Later, the Baltic Germans faced fierce attacks from the Russian nationalist press, which accused the Baltic aristocracy of separatism, and advocated closer linguistic and administrative integration with Russia.

Social division was based on the dominance of the Baltic Germans which formed the upper classes while the majority of indigenous population, called "Undeutsch", composed the peasantry. In the Imperial census of 1897, 98,573 Germans (7.58% of total population) lived in the [[Governorate of Livonia]], 51,017 (7.57%) in the Governorate of Curonia, and 16,037 (3.89%) in the [[Governorate of Estonia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|publisher=Demoscope |url=http://demoscope.ru/weekly/ssp/rus_lan_97.php?reg=49 |title=Language Statistics of 1897 |place=[[Russia|RU]] |language=Russian |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629071138/http://demoscope.ru/weekly/ssp/rus_lan_97.php?reg=49 |archivedate=2011-06-29 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; The social changes faced by the emancipation, both social and national, of the Estonians and Latvians where not taken seriously by the Baltic German gentry. The provisional government of Russia after 1917 revolution gave the Estonians and Latvians [[self-governance]] which meant the end of the Baltic German era in Baltics.

The Lithuanian gentry consisted mainly of [[Lithuanians]], but due to strong ties to Poland, had been culturally Polonized. After the [[Union of Lublin]] in 1569, they became less distinguishable from Polish ''[[szlachta]]'', although preserved [[Lithuania]]n national awareness.

====Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth====
In the history of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]], "gentry" is often used in English to describe the [[Polish landed gentry]] ({{lang-pl|ziemiaństwo, ziemianie}}, from ''[[ziemia]]'', "land").  They were the lesser members of the nobility (the ''[[szlachta]]''), contrasting with the much smaller but more powerful group of "magnate" families (sing. ''magnat'', plural ''magnaci'' in Polish), the [[Magnates of Poland and Lithuania]]. Compared to the situation in England and some other parts of Europe, these two parts of the overall "nobility" to a large extent operated as different classes, and were often in conflict. After the [[Partitions of Poland]], at least in the stereotypes of 19th-century nationalist lore, the magnates often made themselves at home in the capitals and courts of the partitioning powers, while the gentry remained on their estates, keeping the national culture alive.

From the 15th century, only the ''szlachta'', and a few patrician bughers from some cities, were allowed to own rural estates of any size, as part of the very extensive [[szlachta privileges]]. These restrictions were reduced or removed after the Partitions of Poland, and commoner landowners began to emerge. By the 19th century, there were at least 60,000 ''szlachta'' families, most rather poor, and many no longer owning land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

====Spain and Portugal====
In [[Spanish nobility]] and former Portuguese nobility, see [[Hidalgo (nobility)|hidalgos]] and [[infanzon]]es.

====Swedish====
In Sweden, there was not outright [[serfdom]]. Hence, the gentry was basically a class of well-off citizens that had grown from the wealthier or more powerful members of the peasantry. The two historically legally privileged [[Social class|classes]] in Sweden were the Swedish nobility ''([[Swedish nobility|Adeln]])'', a rather small group numerically, and the [[clergy]], which were part of the so-called ''[[frälse]]'' (a classification defined by tax exemptions and representation in the [[Diet (assembly)|diet]]).

At the head of the Swedish clergy stood the Archbishop of Uppsala since 1164. The clergy encompassed almost all the educated men of the day and furthermore was strengthened by considerable wealth, and thus it came naturally to play a significant political role. Until the Reformation, the clergy was the first estate but was relegated to the secular estate in the Protestant North Europe.

In the Middle Ages, celibacy in the [[Catholic Church]] had been a natural barrier to the formation of an hereditary priestly class. After compulsory celibacy was abolished in Sweden during the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]], the formation of a hereditary priestly class became possible, whereby wealth and clerical positions were frequently inheritable. Hence the bishops and the vicars, who formed the clerical upper class, would frequently have [[Manorialism|manors]] similar to those of other country gentry. Hence continued the medieval Church legacy of the intermingling between noble class and clerical upper class and the intermarriage as the distinctive element in several Nordic countries after the Reformation.

[[Swedish name#Surnames amongst the Swedish gentry|Surnames in Sweden]] can be traced to the 15th century, when they were first used by the Gentry (Frälse), i.e., priests and nobles. The names of these were usually in Swedish, Latin, German or Greek.

The adoption of Latin names was first used by the Catholic clergy in the 15th century. The given name was preceded by Herr (Sir), such as Herr Lars, Herr Olof, Herr Hans, followed by a Latinized form of [[patronymic]]  names, e.g., Lars Petersson Latinized as Laurentius Petri. Starting from the time of the Reformation, the Latinized form of their birthplace ([[Laurentius Petri Gothus]], from Östergötland) became a common naming practice for the clergy.

In the 17th and 18th centuries, the surname was only rarely the original family name of the ennobled; usually, a more imposing new name was chosen. This was a period which produced a myriad of two-word Swedish-language family names for the nobility (very favored prefixes were Adler, "eagle"; Ehren – "ära", "honor"; Silfver, "silver"; and Gyllen, "golden"). The regular difference with Britain was that it became the new surname of the whole house, and the old surname was dropped altogether.

====Ukraine====
The [[Western Ukrainian Clergy]] of the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]] were a hereditary tight-knit social caste that dominated western Ukrainian society from the late eighteenth until the mid-20th centuries, following the reforms instituted by [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II, Emperor of Austria]]. Because, like their [[Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] brethren, Ukrainian Catholic priests could marry, they were able to establish "priestly dynasties", often associated with specific regions, for many generations. Numbering approximately 2,000–2,500 by the 19th century, priestly families tended to marry within their group, constituting a tight-knit hereditary caste.&lt;ref name="Subtleny"&gt;{{Citation|first=Orest|last=Subtelny|year=1988|title=Ukraine: A History|place=Toronto|publisher=University of Toronto Press|pages=214–19}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the absence of a significant native nobility and enjoying a virtual monopoly on education and wealth within western Ukrainian society, the clergy came to form that group's native aristocracy. The clergy adopted Austria's role for them as bringers of culture and education to the Ukrainian countryside. Most Ukrainian social and political movements in Austrian-controlled territory emerged or were highly influenced by the clergy themselves or by their children.  This influence was so great that western Ukrainians were accused of wanting to create a theocracy in western Ukraine by their Polish rivals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Himka|first=John Paul|year=1999|title=Religion and Nationality in Western Ukraine|publisher=McGill-Queen's University Press|place=Montreal and Kingston|page=10}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The central role played by the Ukrainian clergy or their children in western Ukrainian society would weaken somewhat at the end of the 19th century but would continue until the mid-20th century.

===United Kingdom===

The British upper classes consist of two sometimes overlapping entities, the [[peerage]] and [[landed gentry]]; any male member of either may regard himself as a gentleman, in a special sense mutually understood between hereditary members of the class, which will often exclude life peers. In the British peerage, only the senior family member (typically the eldest son) inherits a substantive title (duke, marquess, earl, viscount, baron); these are referred to as peers or lords. The rest of the nobility are referred to as "landed gentry" (abbreviated "gentry"). Except for the eldest sons of peers, who bear their fathers' inferior titles as "courtesy titles" (but for Parliamentary purposes count as commoners), they usually bear no titles apart from the qualifications of esquire or gentleman (which are ranks recognised in law, although now without any legal consequence); exceptions include the [[baronet]] (a title corresponding to a hereditary knighthood), those that are knighted (for life, called Sir X Y), [[Baron#Scotland|Scottish barons]] (who bear the designation Baron of X after their name),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.lyon-court.com/lordlyon/536.html |title= The Court of the Lord Lyon |accessdate= 2010-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Laird|Scottish lairds]] (whose names include a description of their lands in the form of a [[territorial designation]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.debretts.com/forms-of-address/titles/scottish--and-irish-titles/chief,-chieftain,-laird.aspx |title= Debrett's Forms of Address|contribution= Lairds |accessdate= 2010-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''landed gentry'', although originally used to mean nobility, came to be used for the lesser nobility in England around 1540.  Once identical, these terms eventually became complementary. The term ''gentry'' by itself, as commonly used by historians, according to [[Peter Coss]], is a construct applied loosely to rather different societies. Any particular model may not fit a specific society, yet a single definition nevertheless remains desirable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url= http://www.history.ac.uk/reviews/review/402|first= Michael|last= Hicks|type= review|title= The Origins of the English Gentry|number= 402|place=UK}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|format= [[PDF]]|url= http://assets.cambridge.org/97805210/21005/frontmatter/9780521021005_frontmatter.pdf|publisher= Cambridge University Press|ISBN= 0-52102100-6|title= The Origins of the English Gentry|first= Peter|last= Coss}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Titles, while often considered central to the upper class, are not strictly so. Both Captain [[Mark Phillips]] and Vice Admiral Sir [[Timothy Laurence]], the respective first and second husbands of [[Forms of address in the United Kingdom|HRH]] [[Anne, Princess Royal|Princess Anne]], lacked any rank of peerage at the time of their marriage to Princess Anne. However, the  backgrounds of both men were considered to be essentially [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]], and they were thus deemed{{by whom?|date=April 2017}} suitable husbands for a princess.

The landed gentry is a traditional British [[social class]] consisting of [[gentlemen]] in the original sense; that is, those who owned land in the form of [[country estate]]s to such an extent that they were not required to actively work, except in an administrative capacity on their own lands. The estates were often (but not always) made up of [[tenant farm|tenanted farms]], in which case the gentleman could live entirely off [[renting|rent]] income.

[[Esquire]] (abbreviated Esq.) is a term derived from the French "écuyer" (which also gave equerry) the lowest designation for a nobleman, referring only to males, and used to denote a high but indeterminate social status. The most common occurrence of term ''Esquire'' today is the conferral as the suffix ''Esq.'' in order to pay an informal compliment to a male recipient by way of implying [[Nobility|gentle birth]].  In the post-medieval world, the title of ''esquire'' came to apply to all men of the higher landed gentry; an esquire ranked socially above a gentleman but below a knight. In the modern world, where all men are assumed to be gentlemen, the term has often been extended (albeit only in very formal writing) to all men without any higher title. It is used post-nominally, usually in abbreviated form (for example, "Thomas Smith, Esq.").

A [[knight]] can be either a medieval tenant giving military service as a mounted man-at-arms to a feudal landholder, or a medieval gentleman-soldier, usually high-born, raised by a sovereign to privileged military status after training as a page and squire (for a contemporary reference, see [[British honours system]]). In formal protocol, ''[[Sir]]'' is the correct [[Style (manner of address)|styling]] for a knight or for a baronet, used with (one of) the knight's [[given name]](s) or full name, but not with the [[surname]] alone. The equivalent for a woman who holds the title in her own right is [[Dame (title)|Dame]]; for such women, the title ''Dame'' is used as ''Sir'' for a man, never before the surname on its own. This usage was devised{{by whom?|date=April 2017}} in 1917, derived from the practice, up to the 17th century (and still also in legal proceedings), for the wife of a knight.  The wife of a knight or baronet is now styled "[[Lady]] [Surname]".

===Irish===

===United States===
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2012}}
{{Main article|American gentry}}
The [[Thirteen Colonies|Colonial American]] use of ''gentry'' followed the British usage (i.e., landed gentry); before the independence of the United States, [[Southern United States|Southern]] [[Planter (American South)|planter]]s were often the younger sons of British landowners, who perpetuated the British system in rural Virginia and Charleston, South Carolina, by employing [[tenant farmers]], [[indentured servants]], and [[Chattel slavery|chattel]] [[slavery|slaves]]. In the [[Northeastern United States]], the gentry included (colonial and British) offshoot families who established the city of Boston, Massachusetts, and Harvard and Yale colleges.

The families of Virginia (see [[First Families of Virginia]]) formed the Virginia gentry class as the old guard of plantation owners in United States. As General [[Robert E. Lee]]'s paternal ancestors were among the earliest settlers in Virginia, his family was considered among the oldest of the Virginia [[Gentleman#Robert E. Lee|gentry class]].

The concept of the [[gentleman farmer]] as a man who farms mainly for pleasure rather than for profit was not only a model for the Southern gentry, but very much an ideal befitting some of founding fathers of America, such as Thomas Jefferson and George Washington. Washington resumed the life of a gentleman farmer at his Mount Vernon estate in Virginia following his resignation as commander in chief of the army in December 1783.

The American gentry, even in cases where the family never had obtained official rights to bear a coat of arms in history, bore all the same hallmarks of traditional elite as in the old continent.

First Families of Virginia originated with colonists from England who primarily settled at [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]] and along the [[James River (Virginia)|James River]] and other navigable waters in the [[Colony of Virginia]] during the 17th century. As there was a propensity to marry within their narrow social scope for many generations, many descendants bear surnames which became common in the growing colony.

Many of the original English colonists considered members of the First Families of Virginia migrated to the Colony of Virginia during the [[English Civil War]] and [[English Interregnum]] period (1642–60). Royalists left England on the accession to power of Oliver Cromwell and his Parliament. Because most of Virginia's leading families recognised [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] as King following the execution of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] in 1649, Charles II is reputed to have called Virginia his "Old Dominion", a nickname that endures today.  Most of such early settlers in Virginia were so-called "Second Sons".  [[Primogeniture]] favored the first sons' inheriting lands and titles in England. Virginia evolved in a society of second or third sons of English aristocracy who inherited [[land grant]]s or land in Virginia. They formed part of the southern elite in America.  Many of the great Virginia dynasties traced their roots to families like the [[Lee family|Lees]] and the Fitzhughs, who traced lineage to England's county families and baronial legacies. But not all: even the most humble Virginia immigrants aspired to the English manorial trappings of their betters.

The Colonial families of Maryland were the leading families in the [[Province of Maryland]]. Several also had interests in the Colony of Virginia, and the two are sometimes referred to as the [[Chesapeake Colonies]]. Many of the early settlers came from the [[West Midlands (region)|West Midlands]] in England, although the Maryland families were composed of a variety of European nationalities, e.g., French, Irish, Welsh, Scottish, and Swedish, in addition to English. Charles I of England granted the province [[County palatine|palatinate]] status under [[Cecilius Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore]]. The foundational charter created an aristocracy of [[lords of the manor]] for Maryland. Maryland was uniquely created as a colony for [[Catholic church|Catholic]] aristocracy and landed gentry, but [[Anglicanism]] eventually came to dominate, partly through influence from neighbouring Virginia.

===East Asia===

====Four occupations====
{{Main article|Four occupations (East Asia)}}

The 'four divisions of society' refers to the [[Four occupations (China)|model of society in ancient China]] and was a [[meritocratic]] [[social class]] system in China and other subsequently influenced [[Confucian]] societies. The four castes—gentry, farmers, artisans and merchants—are combined to form the term Shìnónggōngshāng (士農工商).

Gentry (士) means different things in different countries. In China, Korea, and Vietnam, this meant that the Confucian scholar gentry that would – for the most part – make up most of the bureaucracy. This caste would comprise both the more-or-less hereditary aristocracy as well as the meritocratic scholars that rise through the rank by public service and, later, by imperial exams. Some sources, such as [[Xun Kuang|Xunzi]], list farmers before the gentry, based on the Confucian view that they directly contributed to the welfare of the state. In China, the farmer lifestyle is also closely linked with the ideals of Confucian gentlemen. In Japan, this caste essentially equates to the samurai class. In the [[Edo period]], with the creation of the [[Han (country subdivision)|Domains (''han'')]] under the rule of [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]], all land was confiscated and reissued as fiefdoms to the ''[[daimyō]]s''.

The small lords, the {{nihongo|samurai|武士|bushi|}}, were ordered either to give up their swords and rights and remain on their lands as peasants or to move to the castle cities to become paid retainers of the ''daimyōs''. Only a few samurai were allowed to remain in the countryside; the {{Nihongo |landed samurai|郷士|gōshi}}. Some 5 per cent of the population were samurai. Only the samurai could have proper surnames, which after the [[Meiji Restoration]], became compulsory to all inhabitants (see [[Japanese name]]).

====Hierarchical structure of Feudal Japan====
{{Main article|Edo society|Kazoku}}
[[File:Matsue daimyo c1850s.jpg|thumb|upright|Matsue ''[[daimyō]]'' (c. 1850s)]]
[[File:Sainshieum.jpg|thumb|upright|Group of [[Seonbi]] "virtuous scholar" in Korea that followed confucian precepts)  (c. 18th century)]]
There were two leading classes, i.e. the gentry, in the time of feudal Japan: the ''[[daimyō]]'' and the ''[[samurai]]''. The Confucian ideals in the Japanese culture emphasised the importance of productive members of society, so farmers and fishermen were considered of a higher status than merchants.

[[Emperor Meiji]] abolished the samurai's right to be the only armed force in favor of a more modern, Western-style, conscripted army in 1873. Samurai became ''[[Shizoku]]'' ({{lang|ja|士族}}), but the right to wear a katana in public was eventually abolished along with the right to [[execution|execute]] commoners who paid them disrespect.

In defining how a modern Japan should be, members of the Meiji government decided to follow in the footsteps of the United Kingdom and Germany, basing the country on the concept of ''[[noblesse oblige]]''. Samurai were not to be a political force under the new order. The difference between the Japanese and European feudal systems was that European feudalism was grounded in [[Roman law|Roman legal structure]], while Japan feudalism had Chinese [[Confucianism|Confucian morality]] as its basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.psych.ualberta.ca/~msnyder/Academic/japvseur.html|last=Snyder|first=MR |date=October 1994|title=Japanese vs. European Feudalism|type=guest lecturer|publisher=Alberta Vocational College|place=[[Canada|CA]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Korea====
{{main article|Yangban}}
Korean monarchy and the native ruling upper class existed in [[Korea]] until the end of the [[Korea under Japanese rule|Japanese occupation]]. The system concerning the nobility is roughly the same as that of the [[Chinese nobility]].

As the [[Jesuits]] and other preceding monastical orders did during Europe's [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]], the Buddhist monks became the purveyors and guardians of Korea's literary traditions while documenting Korea's written history and legacies from the [[Silla]] period to the end of the [[Goryeo]] dynasty. Korean Buddhist monks also developed and used the first movable metal type printing presses in history—some 500 years before [[Johannes Gutenberg|Gutenberg]]—to print ancient Buddhist texts. Buddhist monks also engaged in record keeping, food storage and distribution, as well as the ability to exercise power by influencing the Goryeo royal court.

==Values and traditions==

===Military and clerical===
{{main article|Military elite}}
[[File:Hungarian knights, Illustration for Il costume antico e moderno by Giulio Ferrario 1831 (4).jpg|thumb|[[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungarian]] nobles, circa 1831]]

Historically, the nobles in Europe became soldiers; the aristocracy in Europe can trace their origins to military leaders from the migration period and the Middle Ages. For many years, the British Army, together with the Church, was seen as the ideal career for the younger sons of the aristocracy. Although now much diminished, the practice has not totally disappeared. Such practices are not unique to the British either geographically or historically. As a very practical form of displaying patriotism, it has been at times "fashionable" for "gentlemen" to participate in the military.

The fundamental idea of gentry had come to be that of the essential superiority of the fighting man, usually maintained in the granting of arms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=John |last=Selden |title=Titles of Honour |year=1614 |page=707}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the last, the wearing of a sword on all occasions was the outward and visible sign of a "gentleman"; the custom survives in the sword worn with "court dress". A suggestion that a gentleman must have a coat of arms was vigorously advanced by certain 19th- and 20th-century heraldists, notably [[Arthur Charles Fox-Davies]] in England and [[Thomas Innes of Learney]] in Scotland. The significance of a right to a coat of arms was that it was definitive proof of the status of gentleman, but it recognised rather than conferred such a status, and the status could be and frequently was accepted without a right to a coat of arms.

===Chivalry===
[[File:Meister der Manessischen Liederhandschrift 001.jpg|upright|thumb|A knight being armed.]]
{{Main article|Chivalry}}
''Chivalry''{{Refn|group = "lower-alpha" |Etymology: English from 1292, loans from French ''chevalerie'' "[[knighthood]]", from ''chevalier'' "knight" from [[Medieval Latin]] ''caballarius'' "horseman"; ''[[cavalry]]'' is from the [[Middle French]] form of the same word.}} is a term related to the medieval institution of [[knighthood]]. It is usually associated with ideals of [[knightly virtues]], [[honour]] and [[courtly love]].

Christianity had a modifying influence on the virtues of chivalry, with limits placed on knights to protect and honour the weaker members of society and maintain peace. The church became more tolerant of war in the defence of faith, espousing theories of the [[just war]]. In the 11th century, the concept of a "knight of Christ" (''miles Christi'') gained currency in France, Spain and Italy.&lt;ref name= sweeney&gt;{{Citation|author-link=James Ross Sweeney|first=James Ross|last=Sweeney|year=1983|contribution=Chivalry|title=[[The Dictionary of the Middle Ages]]|volume=III}}.&lt;/ref&gt; These concepts of "religious chivalry" were further elaborated in the era of the [[Crusades]].&lt;ref name=sweeney/&gt;

In the later Middle Ages, wealthy merchants strove to adopt chivalric attitudes.&lt;ref name=sweeney/&gt; This was a democratisation of chivalry, leading to a new genre called the [[courtesy book]], which were guides to the behaviour of "gentlemen".&lt;ref name=sweeney/&gt;

When examining [[mediaeval literature|medieval literature]], chivalry can be classified into three basic but overlapping areas:
# Duties to countrymen and fellow Christians
# Duties to God
# Duties to women
These three areas obviously overlap quite frequently in chivalry and are often indistinguishable. Another classification of chivalry divides it into warrior, religious and courtly love strands. One particular similarity between all three of these categories is honour. Honour is the foundational and guiding principle of chivalry. Thus, for the knight, honour would be one of the guides of action.

===Gentleman===
[[File:English Gentleman.jpg|upright|thumb|A page from Brathwait's book that displays the qualities associated with being a gentleman]]
{{Main article|Gentleman}}

The term gentleman (from Latin ''gentilis'', belonging to a race or ''gens'', and  "man", [[cognate]] with the French word ''gentilhomme'', the Spanish ''hombre gentil'' and the Italian ''gentil uomo'' or ''gentiluomo''), in its original and strict signification, denoted a man of good family, analogous to the Latin ''generosus'' (its invariable translation in English-Latin documents). In this sense the word equates with the French ''gentilhomme'' ("nobleman"), which was in Great Britain long confined to the peerage. The term ''gentry'' (from the Old French ''genterise'' for ''gentelise'') has much of the social-class significance of the French ''noblesse'' or of the German ''Adel'', but without the strict technical requirements of those traditions (such as [[quarters of nobility]]). To a degree, ''gentleman'' signified a man with an income derived from [[landed property]], a [[old money|legacy]] or some other source and was thus independently wealthy and did not need to work.

===Confucianism===
The [[East Asia|Far East]] also held similar ideas to the West of what a gentleman is, which are based on [[Confucianism|Confucian]] principles. The term ''[[Junzi|Jūnzǐ]]'' (君子) is a term crucial to classical Confucianism. Literally meaning "son of a ruler", "prince" or "noble", the ideal of a "gentleman", "proper man", "exemplary person", or "perfect man" is that for which Confucianism exhorts all people to strive. A succinct description of the "perfect man" is one who "combine[s] the qualities of saint, scholar, and gentleman" ([[Catholic Encyclopedia|CE]]). A hereditary elitism was bound up with the concept, and gentlemen were expected to act as moral guides to the rest of society. They were to:
* cultivate themselves morally;
* participate in the correct performance of ritual;
* show filial piety and loyalty where these are due; and
* cultivate humaneness.

The opposite of the ''Jūnzǐ'' was the ''Xiǎorén'' (小人), literally "small person" or "petty person". Like English "small", the word in this context in Chinese can mean petty in mind and heart, narrowly self-interested, greedy, superficial, and materialistic.

===Noblesse oblige===
{{main article|Noblesse oblige}}
The idea of ''noblesse oblige'', "nobility obliges", among gentry is, as the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' expresses, that the term "suggests noble ancestry constrains to honorable behaviour; privilege entails to responsibility". Being a noble meant that one had responsibilities to lead, manage and so on. One was not to simply spend one's time in idle pursuits.

==Heraldry==
{{Main article|Coat of arms}}
[[File:Robert Glover Pedigree de Euro.jpg|thumb|An example of an [[Elizabethan era|Elizabethan]] pedigree of the de Euro family of [[Northumberland]], barons of Warkworth and Clavering. Scrivened, circa 1570 to 1588]]
A coat of arms is a heraldic device dating to the 12th century in Europe. It was originally a cloth tunic worn over or in place of armour to establish identity in battle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|contribution=Coat of arms|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/35518/coat-of-arms|title=Encyclopædia Britannica|edition=online}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The coat of arms is drawn with heraldic rules for a person, family or organisation. Family coats of arms were originally derived from personal ones, which then became extended in time to the whole family. In Scotland, family coats of arms are still personal ones and are mainly used by the head of the family.

===Ecclesiastical heraldry===
{{Main article|Ecclesiastical heraldry}}
Ecclesiastical heraldry is the tradition of heraldry developed by Christian clergy. Initially used to mark documents, ecclesiastical heraldry evolved as a system for identifying people and [[diocese]]s. It is most formalised within the Catholic Church, where most [[bishop]]s, including the [[pope]], have a personal [[coat of arms]]. Clergy in [[Anglicanism|Anglican]], [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]], [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Eastern Catholic]], and [[Eastern Christianity|Orthodox churches]] follow similar customs.

'''Gisela Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg''' (born August 2, 1929) is a German [[sociology|sociologist]], [[ethnology|ethnologist]], [[sexologist]], and writer further specializing into the fields of [[psychology]], [[Indo-European studies]], [[religious studies]], and philosophy, since 1980 also increasingly [[anthropology]]. As Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg uses these approaches in research particularly in the fields of [[sexology]], [[homophobia]], and [[prejudice|prejudice studies]], the US ''[[Society of Lesbian and Gay Anthropologists]]'' (SOLGA; formerly ''Anthropology Research Group on Homosexuality'', ARGOH)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uvm.edu/~dlrh/solga/index.html Society of Lesbian and Gay Anthropologists Homepage]&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[American Anthropological Association]] ranked Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg's works on homophobia as internationally outstanding.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anthrosource.net/doi/pdf/10.1525/sol.1991.13.3.43 ''Society of Lesbian and Gay Anthropologists Newsletter'', October 1991, Vol. 13, No. 3: pp. 43–75]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg studied sociology, [[psychology]], ethnology, [[religious studies]], philosophy and ''Indogermanistik'' (an interdisciplinarian German subject, not identical with purely linguistic [[Indo-European studies]] in Anglophone countries, consisting of historical, sociological, cultural, religious, ethnological, philological, and linguistic study relating to [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Proto-Indo-European]] and Indo-European peoples and [[Indo-European languages]]) in [[Bonn]].&lt;ref&gt;Biographical and bibliographical notes on the inside dust jacket of Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg's book ''Tabu Homosexualität'' (1st ed.), on page 2 of her book ''Angst und Vorurteil'', and on page 2 of her book ''Vom Schmetterling zur Doppelaxt''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1969, Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg graduated at the [[University of Bonn]], receiving her ''[[Magister (degree)|Magister artium]]'' (comparable to a [[Master of Arts|Master's degree]] in the Anglo-American educational system) for her thesis ''Homosexualität und Transvestition im Schamanismus'' ("Homosexuality and transvestition in shamanism"). In 1970, she received her PhD for her doctoral dissertation on ''Sexuelle Abartigkeit im Urteil der abendländischen Religions-, Geistes-, und Rechtsgeschichte im Zusammenhang mit der Gesellschaftsentwicklung'' ("The religious, philosophical, and legal construction of sexual deviance in interdependence with the development of Western society").

After university studies Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg became a scientific assistant at the Sociological Institute of Bonn University, and worked as a sociologist, writer, and independent journalist, holding memberships in a number of scientific and political organizations. She was a leading member of ''[[German Society for Social-Scientific Sexuality Research]]''. During the late 1980s, Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg was a member of the [[Bundestag|German-parliament]] commissioned ''Enquetekommission AIDS'', an inquiry commission researching into the disease's social, legal, and public health care consequences and challenges, a cooperation which spawned her 1989 book ''Angst und Vorurteil'' (see below).

Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg is married and lives in Germany.

== Fields of interest &amp; influences ==

=== "Ethno-sociologist" ===

A label commonly applied to Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg is that of an "ethno-sociologist", even though that is not to limit her approaches exclusively to non-Western cultures. Her inclusion of ethnological, cross-cultural approaches serves as one device of many that she uses to globally study and analyze mankind's nature and nurture as well as the differences and interdependencies between the two, aiming for a global perspective also applicable in modern industrialized societies.

=== Fields of interest ===

Following the ideology-critical and identity-critical approach of [[Frankfurt School]]'s Critical Theory, the emphasis of Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg's mostly [[post-structuralism|post-structural]] and [[deconstructionism|deconstructionist]] work (see [[social constructionism]] and [[social constructivism]]) on socio-psychological prejudice studies lies on the socio-cultural, socio-historical, and socio-psychological research into issues such as Western repression of sensuality (''Leibfeindlichkeit'') in Indo-European cultures, and extends into research on topics such as deviant sexuality, homophobia, misogyny, gender roles, and patriarchy.

=== Deconstructivism &amp; essentialism ===

Most of Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg's research is dedicated to cultural deconstruction of ethnocentric Western prejudices, analyzing their origins and later derivations in history, and emphasizes that this cultural nurture also determining social identities must not be misunderstood as man's essentialist human nature. According to Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg, [[Positivism#Criticisms|positivist]] misinterpretation of ethnocentric prejudices as human nature is one of the key maladies of Western civilization, known to Critical Theory as society's [[Absolute (philosophy)|totality]] also influencing much of Western scientific output. For instance, gays were throughout most of Western history said to be effeminate ''by their nature'', while this common stereotype also influenced social identities and behaviors of individual homosexuals, and these resulting identities and behaviors were in turn taken by society as justifying evidence for their prejudice.

Only two of her works, ''Mannbarkeitsriten'' (1980) and ''Der pädophile Impuls'' (1985/88) deal with anthropological research into the essential cross-cultural and cross-species nature of two particular sexual attractions beyond common Western stereotypes, paederasty (which Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg defines as "male same-sex paedophilia"&lt;ref&gt;Preface to the German edition (1986) of [[Theo Sandfort]]'s Dutch study published in English as ''The sexual aspect of paedosexual relations: The experience of 25 boys with men'' (1981, 1st reprint 1983, 2nd reprint 1987)&lt;/ref&gt;) in ''Mannbarkeitsriten'', and paedophilia (defined as "sexual contact between fertile adults and infertile juveniles" based upon preference for these activities on behalf of the adult side, rather than situational offences&lt;ref&gt;''Der pädophile Impuls – Wie lernt ein junger Mensch Sexualität?''. (1985/88)&lt;/ref&gt;) in general in ''Der pädophile Impuls''.

=== Influences ===

In her publications on prejudice studies, both general and specifically sexual deviance-related, Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg incorporates influences of [[Frankfurt School|Critical Theory]] (especially the theory of ''[[Authoritarian personality]]'', also see [[Right-wing authoritarianism]]), ''[[Labeling theory]]'' by [[George Herbert Mead]] and [[Howard S. Becker]], ''[[social identity|Social identity theory]]'' by [[Henri Tajfel]] and [[John Turner (psychologist)|John Turner]], ''[[Frustration aggression theory|Frustration-Aggression hypothesis]]'' by [[John Dollard]] and [[Neal E. Miller]], ''[[observational learning|Social learning theory]]'' by [[Albert Bandura]], ''[[dispositif]]'' and ''[[discourse analysis]]'' by [[Michel Foucault]], and the concept of ''[[wikt:derivation|derivation]]'' in the sociological sense of the term by [[Vilfredo Pareto]], denoting an irrational, ideological after-the-fact rationalization. Other notable influences include [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Mircea Eliade]], [[Marija Gimbutas]] (though only acknowledged by Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg as a summary source for a century of scholarly Central European and Scandinavian ''Indogermanistik'' publications prior to Gimbutas), the concepts of ''[[magical thinking]]'' by [[James George Frazer]] and of ''the [[numinous]]'' by [[Rudolf Otto]].

Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg's definition of prejudice is largely identical to [[Theodor W. Adorno]]'s ''Verblendungszusammenhang'', by which Adorno denotes socially constructed "delusions" (''Verblendungen'') based upon traditional socio-cultural and socio-psychological conditions or relations (''Verhältnisse'') within Western society, but also takes influence from Foucault's ''dispositif'' or ''apparatus'', whereas according to Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg, traditional ethnocentric prejudices easily adapt to social [[paradigm shift]]s throughout history in order to update their rationalizations according to dominant [[episteme]]s, with new derivations of the same old prejudices as the result. For example, during the Medieval Age, according to [[Benedictus Levita]], [[Thomas Aquinas]], and the [[Malleus Maleficarum]], same-sex activities were abhorred as the most deadliest sin of all, which was ''superbia'', i. e. the very pride to consider oneself above God and disobey His will as manifested in His most sacred commandments such as that ''sodomia'' (see [[sodomy]]), the common Medieval term for these activities, was considered identical to [[satanism]] and evil witchcraft, whereas when with the [[scientific revolution]] of Early Modernity the responsibility of priests towards sinners increasingly transformed into one of doctors and judges toward those now considered criminally insane, the rationale to keep the ban upon the very same activities along with the ostracization of those who committed such unspeakable "abominations" changed to emphasizing the alleged counter-naturality or perversion of their acts and pathologizing those who desired such.

Combining her influences, Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg's synthetized definition of ethnocentric, inherently Authoritarian prejudice is one of socially learned manifest, recurring [[intrusive thought]]s (''Zwangsvorstellungen'') that may spill over into [[Allport's Scale]] discrimination, including violent [[hate crime]]s, as a form of [[obsessive-compulsive disorder|obsessive-compulsive behavior]] (''Zwangshandlung''; also see [[Obsessive-compulsive personality disorder]]). Due to what Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg terms "distorted perception" (''verzerrte Wahrnehmung'', resembling [[Bob Altemeyer]]'s ''compartmentalized thinking'') of constructed social reality, the prejudiced aggressor regards themselves as a rectifying, maybe curing agent, as an upholder of "natural order" and "society", and/or as protector of people they perceive as "victims" of the discriminated.

According to Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg's socio-psychological, socio-historical interdisciplinary approach to the topic of homophobia, drawing from research fields such as cultural studies, religious studies, ethnology, philology, and linguistics, the ethnocentric prejudice towards particularly male same-sex attraction and activities in the history of Western, Indo-European cultures is intrinsically identical to misogyny, thus originally gave rise to, and until the modern age maintained, patriarchal structures of Indo-European society. Its roots and cultural elements can be traced back several millennia into Eurasian culture, and were originally based on the subsequent overlapping and conflict-ridden superimposition of the three basic ethnic and cultural [[stratum|strata]] (see [[stratification (archeology)|stratification]], [[social stratification]], and [[archaeological horizon]]) underlying all modern Indo-European cultures.

From there, Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg traces the genesis of homophobia via a number of historical derivations in Indo-European societies until the 20th century.

=== ''Angst und Vorurteil'' (1989) ===

{{main|Angst und Vorurteil}}

The book ''Angst und Vorurteil – AIDS-Ängste als Gegenstand der Vorurteilsforschung'' was based on the work of the parliamentary inquiry commission ''Enquetekommission AIDS'', of which Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg was a member, that was formed in order to research into the disease's social, cultural, legal, and public health care consequences and challenges, as well as Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg's own final report brought forth in parliamentary hearings and towards the [[Cabinet Kohl III|Helmut Kohl administration]].

In ''Angst und Vorurteil'', Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg on the one hand supplements the structural history of Western ''Leibfeindlichkeit'' (repression of sensuality) she related at a fuller scope in ''Tabu Homosexualität'' before, by pointing out in ''Angst und Vorurteil'' further aspects she had already brushed on in ''Der pädophile Impuls'' four years earlier.

On the other hand, in ''Angst und Vorurteil'' Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg gives a thorough, comprehensive description of post-WWII scientific prejudice studies, particularly regarding the re-inforcement of traditional Western ''Leibfeindlichkeit'' (prejudices directed against factual or putative sexual deviance) triggered by HIV, and chronicles the field's academic history from its roots. Bleibtreu-Ehrenberg's understanding of prejudice largely builds on Critical Theory and its concept of the Authoritarian personality, but also incorporates, among other schools of prejudice studies, Labeling theory, Social identity theory, Frustration-Aggression hypothesis, Social learning theory, and Foucault's ''dispositif'' and discourse analysis.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6394">'''Hate mail''' (as [[e-mail|electronic]], [[mail|posted]], or otherwise) is a form of [[harassment]], usually consisting of invective and potentially [[intimidating]] or threatening comments towards the recipient. Hate mail often contains exceptionally abusive, foul or otherwise hurtful language.

The recipient may receive disparaging remarks concerning their [[ethnicity]], [[Human sexual behavior|sexuality]], [[gender]], [[religion]], [[intelligence]], [[Ideologies of parties|political ideology]], sense of [[ethics]], or sense of [[aesthetics]]. The text of hate mail often contains [[profanity]], or it may simply contain a negative, disappropriating message. 

Senders of hate mail normally send anonymous letters or pose as someone else (either a different or fictitious individual) in order to avoid being identified and tracked down, as the nature of some hate mail would inevitably result in criminal charges if the sender was identified.

Famous individuals including actors, members of the [[Royal Family]], politicians and sports people are known to have frequently received hate mail. Players and managers have frequently received hate mail from supporters of rival football clubs, and hate mail has also frequently been sent by fans to players and managers of their own club when they feel that their performance or attitude has been inadequate. Racially motivated hate mail has also been a frequent occurrence, as well as hate mail relating to the [[Sectarian]] divide between [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] and [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] in [[Glasgow]], [[Scotland]], in particular [[Neil Lennon]], who managed Celtic from 2010 to 2014.

Victims of high-profile crimes have also received hate mail, including the parents of murdered and missing children. Sara Payne, whose daughter Sarah was murdered by a paedophile in July 2000, revealed in 2004 that she and her family received a letter while her daughter was still missing, alleging that Sarah had been killed by her father and grandfather. In the years after Sarah's body was found, Sara and her husband Michael received a number of letters criticising them for allowing Sarah and her siblings to play unsupervised on a beach before Sarah's disappearance. Kevin Wells, whose 10-year-old daughter Holly was one of the [[Soham Murders|two girls]] murdered by school caretaker [[Ian Huntley]] at [[Soham]], [[Cambridgeshire]], in August 2002, later revealed that he received a catalogue of hate mail after his daughter's body was found. He was accused of murdering his daughter as well as her friend Jessica Chapman, but also of having murdered Sarah Payne (whose killer [[Roy Whiting]] had already been convicted by this stage), and [[Milly Dowler]] (the missing [[Surrey]] teenager whose body was found in September 2002 but whose killer [[Levi Bellfield]] was not convicted until nearly a decade later). Kevin Wells also received letters accusing him of being the leader of an international paedophile ring. He also received religion-influenced hate mail from several people who condemned him and his wife Nicola for allowing his daughter to "play out on the [[Sabbath]]", as they had been murdered on a Sunday. Milly Dowler's family later received letters from a hoaxer who claimed that the human remains found were not those of their daughter, and that she was in fact living in [[Poland]]. 

[[Jane Tomlinson]], the charity fundraiser who died in September 2007 after a long battle against cancer, received abusive letters, phone calls and e-mails from individuals accusing her of feigning her terminal illness during the final year of her life.

Gerry and Kate McCann, whose young daughter [[Disappearance of Madeleine McCann|Madeleine McCann]] has been missing since May 2007, have frequently received hate mail since the unsolved disappearance of their daughter, often from individuals accusing them of killing their daughter, while others have berated them for leaving Madeleine and her younger twin siblings unsupervised in their [[Portugal|Portuguese]] holiday home while they attended a party at a neighbouring house, and some have given what have since been identified as false accounts of what might have happened to their daughter.

Graffiti aimed at an individual in the same manner as hate mail has also occurred on many occasions. A notable example during the 1990s was the desecration of the grave of [[Moors Murders]] victim Lesley Ann Downey, who had been murdered in December 1964. Some 30 years after her death, a string of messages appeared on her headstone, calling for the release from prison of Moors Murderer Myra Hindley, and making threats to Lesley Ann Downey's mother Ann West, who was at the centre of a campaign to keep Myra Hindley in prison.

'''Jeremiah Daniel Baltimore''' (April 15, 1852 &amp;ndash; July 29, 1929) was an engineer and educator in Washington, DC. For many years, he was an engineer in the service of the [[United States Navy]] and served as chief engineer at the [[Freedmen's Hospital]]. He was also a teacher of mechanics, and was responsible for mechanical instruction in the African American schools in the city from 1890 to 1922. He was on the trial board of the Naval [[battleship]] [[USS Texas (1892)]] and was among the organizers and officers of the Potomac Hospital and Training School. In 1903 he was elected a member of the [[Franklin Institute]] of [[Philadelphia]]. In 1915 he was made member of the [[Royal Society of Arts|Royal Society for the Encouragement of Art, Manufactures, and Commerce]] of [[London]].

== Early life and education ==
[[File:Ulysses S. Grant 1870-1880.jpg|thumb|[[Ulysses S. Grant]] was a mentor to Baltimore.]]
Jeremiah Daniel Baltimore was born in Washington DC on April 15, 1852 to Thomas and Hannah Baltimore. While Thomas was a [[Catholic]], Jeremiah followed his mother and became a Methodist, being baptized at the Wesley Zion Church in 1866. He attended [[Enoch Ambush]]'s school and then Washington, D.C. public schools. As a boy he liked to experiment with steam and told his mother that he wished to be an engineer. His mother said that this was impossible as she and her father would not be able to get him through school. His experiments continued and he made a [[steam boiler]] and attached it to an engine, but this failed. In spite of this, the pastor at his church, Reverend [[William P. Ryder]] placed it in an exhibition at the Wesley Zion Sunday School and then it was put on exhibition in the [[United States Treasury Department]] where officers and employers were impressed. This encouraged Baltimore to keep trying. Baltimore then used bricks and flower pots to hold molten metal, using a kitchen stove to melt brass, and using a file, old shears and an old knife for cutting, created a [[steam engine]] of the horizontal high pressure style with a tubular boiler. The engine was brought to the [[United States Patent Office|patent office]] with the aid of [[Anthony Bowen]], a Washington D.C. City Councilman. The device was widely discussed in the press,&lt;ref name="Simmons1887"/&gt; appearing the ''Iron Age'' of London&lt;ref name="Crisis1924"&gt;The Horizon, The Crisis, February 1924, page 181&lt;/ref&gt; and locally in the ''Sunday Chronicle''. The boy then went to the [[White House]] and sent a copy of the article to the desk of President [[Ulysses S. Grant]], who then invited Baltimore to his office. Grant gave Baltimore a card to deliver to the [[Secretary of the Navy]] to ask that Baltimore be given work in the Navy Yard to learn and work on the machinery.&lt;ref name="Simmons1887"&gt;Simmons, William J., and Henry McNeal Turner. Men of Mark: Eminent, Progressive and Rising. GM Rewell &amp; Company, 1887. p267&amp;ndash;272&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early engineering career ==
[[File:Washington_Navy_Yard_3b06890u.tif|thumb|View of [[Washington Navy Yard]]'s dock, circa 1867]]
Baltimore was then given a position as apprentice in the department of steam engineering at the [[Washington Navy Yard]]. Baltimore faced a lot of prejudice on account of his color, and after a few months complained. Professor [[John M. Langston]] brought the complaints to the Secretary of the Navy who allowed Baltimore to transfer to the [[Philadelphia Navy Yard]]. He again was discriminated against, but endeavored to study on his own early in the mornings and after work. His study paid off and he was admitted to the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia. He was the second black person to be admitted at the institute. His apprenticeship continued and every sign of growth and learning was countered with further examples of prejudice and intimidation. In spite of this, he finished his apprenticeship about September 6, 1873, working for three years and six months.&lt;ref name="Simmons1887"/&gt;

He then was assigned to the Philadelphia Naval Station on [[League Island]] to assist repairs on [[Monitor (warship)|Monitors]]. He was released from the job when force sizes reduced. He then worked at a large mill, and next at a manufacturing firm, [[Sellers &amp; Brother]] after being refused from [[William Cramp &amp; Sons|Cramp &amp; Sons]] and multiple previous applications at Sellers &amp; Brother. He resigned for health reasons and moved back to Washington, DC.&lt;ref name="Simmons1887"/&gt;

In Washington he became engineer of the [[United States Coast Survey]] and opened a general repair shop. On August 2, 1880, he was appointed chief engineer and mechanician at the Freedmen's Hospital.&lt;ref name="Simmons1887"/&gt; He attended [[Howard University]] Medical College in 1880-1881 and received an A.M. (a master's degree) in 1883 from [[Livingstone College]].&lt;ref&gt;Lamb, Daniel Smith. A Historical, Biographical and Statistical Souvenir. Beresford, 1900. p234&lt;/ref&gt; He was frequently noted for inventing a [[pyrometer]] device, for which he received a patent. As an engineer, he was a member of the Mechanics Union and played a key role in merging black and white unions in 1887.&lt;ref name="Simmons1887"/&gt;

== Public life ==
Baltimore was active in Republican politics. In 1876 he was secretary of the 17th District Republicans and was a delegate to the [[1876 Republican National Convention]] in Cincinnati.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/6711893/seventeenth_district_national/|title=Seventeenth District. National Republican (Washington, DC) June 7, 1876, page 4 - Newspapers.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1880, he was made chairman of the group and was again delegate at the [[1880 Republican National Convention|National convention in Chicago]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/6711939/the_chicago_convention_evening_star/|title=The Chicago Convention, Evening Star (Washington, DC), February 6, 1880, page 4 - Newspapers.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Armstrong_Manual_Training_School.jpg|thumb|The [[Armstrong Manual Training School]] opened in 1902.]]
He was recommended as a trustee for public schools in 1883&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/6722279/a_south_washington_delegation_evening/|title=A South Washington Delegation, Evening Star (Washington, DC), June 28, 1883, page 5 - Newspapers.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1889.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/6722288/want_a_trustee_from_south_washington/|title=Want a Trustee from South Washington, Evening Star (Washington, DC), August 16, 1889, page 8 - Newspapers.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1890 he was appointed to take charge of machine instruction in the colored public schools in Washington, a position he held until 1922.&lt;ref name="Crisis1924"/&gt; His position included the responsibility of teaching at the [[Armstrong Manual Training School]]. He was highly respected as a professor, adopting the methods of the [[Bureau of Steam Engineering|United States Bureau of Steam Engineering]]. One of his techniques was that he constructed an engine made of glass to help the students see the workings of the engine and the effect of heat on water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/6721762/a_leader_of_his_race_the_times/|title=A Leader of his Race, The Times (Philadelphia, Pennsylvania) July 28, 1892, page 4 - Newspapers.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1895 he was selected by the Navy to serve as assistant engineer officer on the trial board of the battleship, USS Texas.&lt;ref name="Crisis1924"/&gt; In 1906, Baltimore was among the organizers of the [[Potomac Hospital and Training School]] and was its treasurer. The organizers included Reverend W. J. Howard, Dr. A. R. Collins, and Dr. Harry J. Williams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/6721891/site_for_new_hospital_the_washington/|title=Site for New Hospital, The Washington Post (Washington, DC) April 5, 1906, page 4 - Newspapers.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Honors and affiliations ==

Baltimore was very active in DC Society. In 1875, he was elected recording secretary of the Colored Sabbath School Union of Washington, DC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/6711731/sunday_schools_national_republican/|title=Sunday Schools, National Republican (Washington, DC) July 7, 1875, page 4 - Newspapers.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Baltimore's belief in scientific reason occasionally put him at odds with the religious community, as in 1876 when he took part in a debate with Dr. J. L. N. Bowen wherein Baltimore argued that geological evidence showed that the first verses of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] did not definitely fix the age of the world at about 6,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/6711811/science_and_religion_national/|title=Science and Religion.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19315">The '''Jewish skeleton collection''' was an attempt by the Nazis to create an [[Anthropology|anthropological]] display to showcase the alleged racial inferiority of the "[[Jews|Jewish]] race" and to emphasize the Jews' status as ''[[Untermensch]]en'' ("sub-humans"), in contrast to the [[Germans|German]] race, which the Nazis considered to be [[Aryan]] ''[[Übermensch]]en''. The collection was to be housed at the Anatomy Institute at the [[Reichsuniversität Straßburg|Reich University of Strasbourg]] in the annexed region of [[Alsace]], where the initial preparation of the corpses was performed.

The collection was sanctioned by  Reichsführer of the SS [[Heinrich Himmler]], and designed by and under the direction of [[August Hirt]] with [[Rudolf Brandt]] and [[Wolfram Sievers]], general manager of the [[Ahnenerbe]], being responsible for procuring and preparing the corpses.

Work by [[Hans-Joachim Lang]] published in 2004 revealed the identities and family history of all the victims of this project, based on discovery of the prisoner numbers found at Natzweiler-Struthof in records of those vaccinated against typhus at Auschwitz. The list of names has been placed on a memorial at the cemetery where all were buried, at the facility used to murder them, and at the Anatomical Institute where the corpses were found in 1944.

==Selection==

The project was designed by August Hirt, who directed the phases that were performed before the end of the war ceased the project prior to its completion. Originally the "specimens" to be used in the collection were to be Jewish [[Commissar|commisars]] in the [[Red Army]] captured on the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern front]] by the [[Wehrmacht]]. The 86 individuals ultimately chosen for the collection were obtained from among a pool of 115 Jewish inmates at [[Auschwitz concentration camp]] in [[Occupation of Poland (1939–1945)|Occupied Poland]]. They were chosen for their perceived [[Stereotype|stereotypical]] racial characteristics. The initial selections and preparations were carried out by SS-Hauptsturmführer Dr. [[Bruno Beger]] and Dr. [[Hans Fleischhacker]], who arrived in Auschwitz in the first half of 1943 and finished the preliminary work by June 15, 1943. {{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

Due to a [[typhus]] [[epidemic]] at Auschwitz, the candidates chosen for the skeleton collection were [[quarantine]]d in order to prevent them from becoming ill and ruining their value as anatomical specimens. In that time, the physical measurements were taken from the selected group of people. An excerpt from a letter written by Sievers in June 1943 reports on the preparation and the typhus epidemic: "Altogether 115 persons were worked on, 79 were Jews, 30 were Jewesses, 2 were Poles, and 4 were Asiatics. At the present time these prisoners are segregated by sex and are under [[quarantine]] in the two hospital buildings of Auschwitz."
In February 1942, Sievers submitted to Himmler, through Rudolf Brandt, a report from which the following is an extract read at the Nuremberg Doctors Trial by  General [[Telford Taylor]], Chief Counsel for the prosecution at Nuremberg:
[[File:Wolfram Sievers.jpg|thumb|[[Wolfram Sievers]]]]

{{quote|We have a nearly complete collection of skulls of all races and peoples at our disposal. Only very few specimens of skulls of the Jewish race, however, are available with the result that it is impossible to arrive at precise conclusions from examining them. The [[Eastern Front (World War II)|war in the East]] now presents us with the opportunity to overcome this deficiency. By procuring the skulls of the Jewish-[[Bolshevik]] [[Commissar]]s, who represent the prototype of the repulsive, but characteristic subhuman, we have the chance now to obtain a palpable, scientific document.

The best, practical method for obtaining and collecting this skull material could be handled by directing the Wehrmacht to turn over alive all captured Jewish-Bolshevik Commissars to the [[Feldgendarmerie|Field Police]]. They in turn are to be given special directives to inform a certain office at regular intervals of the number and place of detention of these captured Jews and to give them special close attention and care until a special delegate arrives. This special delegate, who will be in charge of securing the "material" has the job of taking a series of previously established photographs, anthropological measurements, and in addition has to determine, as far as possible, the background, date of birth, and other personal data of the prisoner. Following the subsequently induced death of the Jew, whose head should not be damaged, the delegate will separate the head from the body and will forward it to its proper point of destination in a [[Hermetic seal|hermetically]] sealed tin can especially produced for this purpose and filled with a conserving fluid.

Having arrived at the laboratory, the comparison tests and anatomical research on the skull, as well as determination of the race membership of pathological features of the skull form, the form and size of the brain, etc., can proceed. The basis of these studies will be the photos, measurements, and other data supplied on the head, and finally the tests of the skull itself.}}

==Preparation==

[[Image:BU 003749.jpeg|thumb|[[Josef Kramer]], photographed in [[leg irons]] at [[Belsen concentration camp]] before being removed to the POW cage at [[Celle]], 17 April 1945.]]

Ultimately, 87 of the inmates were shipped to [[Natzweiler-Struthof]]. These people were kept for about two weeks in Block 13 of the camp so that they might eat well to improve their appearance for the desired casts of their corpses. The deaths of 86 of these inmates were, in the words of Hirt, "induced" in an improvised [[Gas chamber|gassing facility]] at [[Natzweiler-Struthof]], and their corpses were sent to Strasbourg — 57 men and 29 women. The gassing occurred on August 11, 13, 17, and 19th, conducted by commandant [[Josef Kramer]], who directed the victims to undress, placed the poison in the ventilation, and watched the people fall to their deaths. One victim was shot for fighting to avoid being gassed and thus was not part of the collection.&lt;ref name=Bernas&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.rfi.fr/hebdo/20141024-au-nom-de-la-race-et-de-la-science-documentaire-crime-nazi-meconnu-prime-waterloo/ |title=Un documentaire sur un crime nazi méconnu primé à Waterloo |trans-title=A documentary about a misunderstood Nazi crime winning at Waterloo |date=October 24, 2014 |accessdate=March 8, 2016 |author=Bernas, Anne |language=French |publisher=RFI les voix du monde}}&lt;/ref&gt; Josef Kramer, acting commandant of Natzweiler-Struthof (who became the commandant at Auschwitz and the last commandant of [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp|Bergen Belsen]]), personally carried out the gassing of the victims, per his testimony at his post-war trial. It is believed that three men died in transport from Auschwitz to Natzweiler-Struthof.&lt;ref name=Lang&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.die-namen-der-nummern.de/index.php/en/scientific-murders |title=Scientific Murders, Anthroplogists at Auschwitz |author=Lang, Hans-Joachim |work=The Names of the Numbers, In Memoriam of 86 Jewish People who Fell Victim to the Nazi Scientists |accessdate=March 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next part of the process for this "collection" was to make anatomical casts of the bodies prior to reducing them to skeletons. With the approach of the Allies in 1944, there was concern over the possibility that the corpses could be discovered, as they had still not been [[excarnation|defleshed]]. In September 1944, Sievers telegrammed Brandt: "The collection can be defleshed and rendered unrecognizable. This, however, would mean that the whole work had been done for nothing-at least in part-and that this singular collection would be lost to science, since it would be impossible to make plaster casts afterwards."

He was chosen to be an anatomical specimen, shipped to [[Natzweiler-Struthof]] and executed in the gas chamber in August 1943]]

Some work had been done at the Anatomical Institute, but the project was never completed. The body casts were not made, and the corpses were not defleshed as skeletons. When the Allies arrived, they found the corpses, some complete and some beheaded, preserved by formalin.&lt;ref name="Bazelon" /&gt;

==Aftermath==


Brandt and Sievers were indicted, tried, and convicted in the [[Doctors' Trial]] in [[Nuremberg]], and both were hanged in [[Landsberg Prison]] on June 2, 1948. Josef Kramer was convicted of war crimes and hanged in {{ill|Hamelin prison|de|Gefängnis Hameln}} by British executioner [[Albert Pierrepoint]] on December 13, 1945. August Hirt, who conceived the project, was sentenced to death in absentia at the Military War Crimes Trial at Metz on 23 December 1953.&lt;ref name=LangZeit /&gt; It was unknown at the time that Hirt had shot himself in the head on June 2, 1945 near the town of [[Schluchsee, Baden-Württemberg|Schluchsee]], while hiding in the [[Black Forest]].&lt;ref name=LangZeit&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lang|first1=Hans-Joachim |title=Skelette für Straßburg Eines der grausigsten Wissenschaftsverbrechen des "Dritten Reiches" ist endlich aufgeklärt |trans-title=Skeletons for Strasbourg: One of the most gruesome crimes of science in the "Third Reich" is finally cleared |url=http://www.zeit.de/2004/35/A-Strassburg|website=Die Zeit|accessdate=April 3, 2016|language=German|date=19 August 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, Bruno Beger was convicted by a West German court as an accessory to 86 murders for his role in procuring the victims of the Jewish skeleton collection. He was sentenced to three years imprisonment, the minimum sentence, but did not serve any time in prison. According to his family, Beger died in [[Königstein im Taunus]] on October 12, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://einestages.spiegel.de/external/ShowAuthorAlbumBackground/a5804/l1/l0/F.html#featuredEntry |title=NS-Verbrechen - Die Spur der Skelette |trans-title=Nazi crimes - The trail of the skeletons |publisher=Spiegel Online |language=German |date=January 6, 2010 |accessdate=October 9, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.die-namen-der-nummern.de/index.php/en/the-perpetrators |title=The Perpetrators – Bruno Beger |publisher=Die-namen-der-nummern |author=Lang, Hans-Joachim |accessdate=March 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Doctors from Hell: the Horrific Account of Nazi Experiments on Humans |author=Spitz, Vivien |publisher=Sentient Publications |date=May 25, 2005 |isbn=1-59181-032-9 |pages=232–234}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Substantive and Procedural Aspects of International Criminal Law : The Experience of International and National Courts: Materials |author=McDonald, Gabrielle Kirk |publisher=Springer |edition=1st |date=March 1, 2000 |isbn=90-411-1134-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
For many years, only a single victim was positively identified through the efforts of [[Serge and Beate Klarsfeld]]: Menachem Taffel (prisoner no. 107969), a [[Polish Jew|Polish born Jew]] who had been living in [[Berlin]]. In 2003, Dr. [[Hans-Joachim Lang]], a German professor at the [[University of Tübingen]], succeeded in identifying all the victims by comparing a list of inmate numbers of the 86 corpses at the Reichs University in Strasbourg, surreptitiously recorded by Hirt's French assistant Henri Henrypierre, with a list of numbers of inmates vaccinated at Auschwitz. The names and biographical information of the victims were published in the book ''Die Namen der Nummern'' (''The Names of the Numbers'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Die Namen der Nummern:  Wie es gelang, die 86 Opfer eines NS-Verbrechens zu identifizieren |trans-title=The names of the numbers: How it was possible to identify the 86 victims of a Nazi crime |edition=hardback |author=Hans-Joachim Lang |publisher=Hoffmann + Campe Vlg GmbH |date=August 31, 2004 |isbn=3-455-09464-3 |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rachel Gordon and Joachim Zepelin translated the Introduction to the book into English at the web site where the whole book is posted in German, including the biographies of the 86 people.&lt;ref name=LangEng&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.die-namen-der-nummern.de/html/the_names.html |title=Die Namen Der Nummern |year=2007 |author=Rachel Gordon, translator |author2=Joachim Zepelin, translator |location=Berlin |accessdate=8 February 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150208080253/http://die-namen-der-nummern.de/html/the_names.html |archivedate=February 8, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lang recounts in detail the story of how he determined the identities of the 86 victims gassed for Dr. August Hirt's project of the Jewish skeleton collection.

In [[philosophy]] and [[media studies]], a '''knowledge space''' is described as an emerging anthropological space in which the knowledge of individuals becomes the primary focus for social structure, values, and beliefs. The concept is put forward and explored by philosopher and media critic [[Pierre Lévy (philosopher)|Pierre Lévy]] in his 1997 book ''Collective Intelligence''.&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Levy, ''Collective Intelligence'', trans. Robert Bononno, Perseus Books, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

== Anthropological Space ==
Levy's notion of the "knowledge space" relies on his conception of anthropological spaces, which he defines as "a system of proximity (space) unique to the world of humanity (anthropological), and thus dependent on human technologies, significations, language, culture, conventions, representations, and emotions" (5). Building on the language of the philosophers [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari]], he states that "anthropological spaces in themselves are neither infrastructures nor superstructures but planes of existence, frequencies, velocities, determined within the social spectrum" (147). Each space contains "worlds of signification" (149) by which humans come to understand and make sense of the world. Furthermore, although one space may dominate, many spaces can and do exist simultaneously.

Levy describes three existing anthropological spaces. They are:
# ''Earth'' - This space corresponds with hunter-gatherer eras in which people identify themselves by familial relationships, derive meaning via intimate connection with the signifier, and where conceptions of time are driven by reminiscence. Passed down narratives become the guiding instruments that exist within the body of the community.
# ''Territorial'' - This space corresponds to the rise of civilizations and the insistent division of things and signs. Within this space history becomes closed and authoritative.  Within territorial space people identify themselves by property ownership and nationality and look to religion for guidance, with the book become the substrate of choice.
# ''Commodity'' - This space corresponds to the rise of industrial revolution and world-markets in which people begin to identify themselves through one's career and wealth. In this space, meaning becomes illusory, our sense of time becomes abstract and uniform (through the use of clocks) while our sense of space becomes configured into a network. Statistics and probability become guiding concepts and indexes and networks of information becomes the substrate through which knowledge is passed on. (175,210)

==The emerging knowledge space==
The knowledge space is an emerging anthropological space which, while it has always existed (139), is only now coming into fruition as a guiding space of humanity. In this space, singularities (individuals) are recognized as singularities and knowledge becomes the guiding value for humanity. Since all human experience represents unique knowledge, within the knowledge space all individuals are valued for their unique knowledge regardless of race (earth space), nationality (territorial space), or economic status (commodity space). Within this space static identity gives way to the "quantum identities" as individuals become participates and the distinction between of "us" and "them" disappears (159). Instead, humanity forms "collective intelligences" in which knowledge is valued and freely traded. What is "real" becomes "that which implies the practical activity, intellectual and imaginary, of living subjects" (168). Life, experiences, and knowledge become the underlying and ever changing guiding path for human societies.

== Relation to Technology ==
Levy's theories rely heavily on the technological developments of the 1990s, particularly the rise of biotechnology, nanotechnology, the Internet, new media and information technologies. In chapter 3, he describes how technologies have made a shift from the molar to the molecular (a move which makes literal a distinction by Delueze and Guattari) in that technologies now handle units as individuals (his term is "singularities") rather than in mass. He suggests that this mirrors our rising recognition of the individuals as singularities rather than massive conglomerated groups.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7111">'''Language preservation''' is the effort to prevent languages from becoming unknown. A language is at risk of being lost when it no longer is taught to younger generations, while fluent speakers of the language (usually the elderly) die.

[[Language]] is an important part of any [[society]], because it enables people to communicate and express themselves.  When a language dies out, future generations lose a vital part of the [[culture]] that is necessary to completely understand it.  This makes language a vulnerable aspect of [[cultural heritage]], and it becomes especially important to preserve it.  According to the [[United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization]] (UNESCO), from facts published in their "Atlas of Languages in Danger of Disappearing," there are an estimated 6,000 languages spoken worldwide today, and half of the world’s population speaks the eight most common.&lt;ref name="portal.unesco"&gt;{{cite web | title=Language Preservation: UNESCO-CI |url=http://portal.unesco.org/ci/en/ev.php-URL_ID=11171&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |accessdate=2007-06-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 3,000 languages are reportedly spoken by fewer than 10,000 people each. ''Ethnologue,'' a reference work published by [[SIL International]], has cataloged the world’s known living languages, and it estimates that 417 languages are on the verge of extinction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ethnologue: Languages of the World |url=http://www.ethnologue.com/ |accessdate=2007-06-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reasons for language endangerment or extinction==
There are different factors that can put a language in danger of becoming extinct. One is when a language is no longer being taught to the children of the community, or at least to a large number of the [[children]]. In these cases, the remaining fluent speakers of the language are generally the older members of the [[community]], and when they pass on, the language dies out with them.

Child speakers are not enough to ensure the survival of a language however.  If the children who do speak the language are relocated to another area where it is not spoken, it becomes endangered.  Political and military turmoil can also endanger a language.&lt;ref name="portal.unesco" /&gt;  When people are forced from their homes into new lands, they may have to learn the language of the new area to adapt, and they end up losing their language.  Likewise, when a country or territory is successfully invaded, the population may be forced to learn the invader's language.

A language can also become associated with a lower [[social class]].&lt;ref name="portal.unesco" /&gt; In this instance, parents will encourage their children to use the language used more often in society to distance themselves from the perceived lower class.  Within one or two generations of this occurrence, the language can easily be lost.

==Importance of preservation==
When a language dies, the knowledge of and ability to understand the culture who spoke it is threatened because the teachings, customs, [[oral traditions]] and other inherited knowledge are no longer transmitted among native speakers.  As each language dies, [[science]] in [[linguistics]], [[anthropology]], [[prehistory]] and [[psychology]] lose some diversity in data sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Foundation for Endangered Languages |url= http://www.ogmios.org/manifesto/index.htm | accessdate=2007-06-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ways to preserve a language==
There are different ideas about the best ways to preserve a language.  One way is to encourage younger generations to speak the language as they grow, so they will then teach their children the language as well.  In many cases, this option is nearly impossible.  There are often many factors that endanger a language, and it is impossible to control each of these factors to ensure its survival.

The [[internet]] can be used to raise awareness about the issues of language extinction and language preservation.  It can be used to translate, catalog, store, and provide information and access to languages.  New technologies such as [[podcasts]] can be used to preserve the spoken versions of languages, and written documents can preserve information about the native literature and linguistics of languages.

The international internet provider [[VeriSign]] estimates that 65-70% of all internet content is in [[English language|English]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=VeriSign Announces Plan to Further Enhance .com and .net Global Internet Constellation Sites with Regional Resolution Servers |url=http://www.verisign.com/verisign-inc/news-and-events/news-archive/us-news-2005/page_029135.html |accessdate=2007-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using written documents to preserve information about the native [[literature]] and [[linguistics]] is also not without potential problems.  Just because a language is written down, this does not mean it will survive.  Written information in [[book]] or [[manuscript]] form is subject to [[acid]] issues, [[bookbinding|binding]] problems, [[environmental monitoring]] problems, and [[security]] concerns.

[[Technology]] can also be used to preserve the integrity of spoken versions of languages.  Many of the same techniques used in recording [[oral history]] can be used to preserve spoken languages.  [[Preservationist]]s can use [[reel-to-reel audio tape recording]]s, along with [[video recording]]s, and new technologies like [[podcast]]s to record spoken accounts of languages.  Technology is also vulnerable to new [[technology]].  Preservation efforts would fail if the technology to listen to or watch certain media such as audio tape recordings or [[video tape]]s is lost.

The [http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/ana/index.html Administration for Native Americans] has published the [http://www.acf.hhs.gov/programs/ana/programs/LanguageGuide.html "Reference Guide for Establishing Archives and Repositories,"] which explains why language repositories are vital to long-term language preservation efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=ANA Reference Guide for Establishing Archives and Repositories |url=http://www.ackco.com/repositoryguide/docs/Repository.pdf |accessdate=2010-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The guide offers practical advice on what to preserve and why; it explains what a language repository is, how to build one, and the costs involved; and lists other resources for creating an archive and repository.

The '''Laysan millerbird''' (''Acrocephalus familiaris familiaris'') was a subspecies of the [[millerbird]], similar in appearance to the remaining subspecies, the [[Nihoa millerbird]]. Its [[Dorsum (biology)|dorsal]] side was brown, and its belly was grayish. Its name derives from its favorite food, several species of moths of the genus ''[[Agrotis]]'' (such as the endemic and likewise extinct ''[[Laysan Noctuid Moth|Agrotis laysanensis]]'') commonly referred to as "millers" (Butler &amp; Usinger, 1963).

==Extinction==
[[File:Acrocepahlus familiaris, Rothsch..jpg|thumb|left|upright|Illustration by [[John Gerrard Keulemans]]]] 
[[File:Laysan Millerbird and Black Mamo.jpg|thumb|left|Laysan millerbird and [[black mamo]] specimens in 1901]] 
Very tame, it was abundant on [[Laysan]], where it was [[Endemism|endemic]], in the 1890s (Udvardy, 1996). After the fateful introduction of [[domestic rabbit]]s in 1903, which nearly denuded the island of vegetation in the next few years, the birds probably declined rapidly. Supposedly, there were 1500 still alive in April 1915 as reported by the [[USCGC Thetis|USCGC ''Thetis'']] expedition (Clapp ''et al.'', 1996), but a thorough 1911 census by the [[State University of Iowa]] expedition had found only "a few" (Dill &amp; Bryan, 1912), as did a brief visit in February 1916. As land bird populations on Laysan fluctuate heavily and because there was considerable poaching for the Japanese [[Hatmaking|millinery]] trade in the 1910s, the supposed 1915 figure cannot be discounted, but it seems highly improbable. At any rate, the 1923 [[Tanager Expedition|expedition]] by the {{USS|Tanager|AM-5}} reported only one unconfirmed sighting which seems to have been erroneous (Olson, 1996). Thus, it can be concluded that the bird disappeared at some time in the late 1910s.

As the vegetation disappeared, the bird suffered increased egg predation by [[Laysan finch]]es (''Telespiza cantans''), [[ruddy turnstone]]s (''Arenaria interpres'') and [[bristle-thighed curlew]]s (''Numenius tahitiensis''), as well as increased competition for food and nesting habitat; a small patch of tree tobacco (''[[Nicotiana glauca]]'') was the only locality left where the millerbird, the [[Laysan rail]] (''Porzana palmeri'') and the [[Laysan honeycreeper]] (''Himatione fraithii'') could nest with a reasonable chance of success. Additionally, the moths which formed its main food source became likewise extinct or exceedingly rare as their food plants were eaten by the rabbits, and thus the only significant food left were brine flies, which, though abundant, would also be utilized by the other land birds and the [[Laysan duck]] (''Anas laysanensis''), all of which were more aggressive than the millerbird. It is most likely that the Laysan millerbird was the first of the three avian taxa to have gone extinct on Laysan, the last individuals of the {{okina}}apapane disappearing in a sandstorm around April 24, 1923 and the rail also disappearing around that time.

'''Lessons learned''' or '''lessons learnt''' are experiences distilled from a project that should be actively taken into account in future projects. 

There are several definitions of the concept. The one used by the [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]], [[European Space Agency]] and [[Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency]] sounds as follows: 
“A lesson learned is knowledge or understanding gained by experience. The experience may be positive, as in a successful test or mission, or negative, as in a mishap or failure...A lesson must be significant in that it has a real or assumed impact on operations; valid in that is factually and technically correct; and applicable in that it identifies a specific design, process, or decision that reduces or eliminates the potential for failures and mishaps, or reinforces a positive result.” &lt;ref&gt;[Secchi, P. (Ed.) (1999). Proceedings of Alerts and Lessons Learned: An Effective way to prevent failures and problems (Technical Report WPP-167). Noordwijk, The Netherlands: ESTEC] &lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Development Assistance Committee]] of the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] defines lessons learned as “Generalizations based on evaluation experiences with projects, programs, or policies that abstract from the specific circumstances to broader situations. Frequently, lessons highlight strengths or weaknesses in preparation, design, and implementation that affect performance, outcome, and impact.” &lt;ref&gt;[OECD – DAC (2002) Glossary of Key Terms in Evaluation and Results Based Management. Evaluation and Aid Effectiveness No 6. http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/29/21/2754804.pdf] &lt;/ref&gt;

In the practice of the [[United Nations]] the concept has been made explicit in the name of their [[Working Group on Lessons Learned]] of the [[Peacebuilding Commission]].
In the military field, conducting a Lessons learned analysis requires a leader-led after-actions debriefing. These debriefings require the leader to extend the lessons-learned orientation of the standard after-action review. He uses the event reconstruction approach or has the individuals present their own roles and perceptions of the event, whichever best fits the situation and time available.&lt;ref&gt;Department of the Army (2009). Field Manual No. 6-22.5. Combat and Operational Stress Control Manual for Leaders and Soldiers. Department of the Army Headquarters, Washington, DC, 18 March 2009. p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Monier Williams]], ''māyā'' meant "wisdom and extraordinary power" in an earlier older language, but from the Vedic period onwards, the word came to mean "illusion, unreality, deception, fraud, trick, sorcery, witchcraft and magic".&lt;ref name="sb"&gt;Bhattacharji, Sukumari (1970), [https://books.google.com/books?id=lDc9AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA35 The Indian Theogony: A Comparative Study of Indian Mythology from the Vedas to the Puraṇas], pages 35-37, Cambridge University Press Archive&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, P. D. Shastri states that the Monier Williams' list is a "loose definition, misleading generalization", and not accurate in interpreting ancient Vedic and medieval era Sanskrit texts; instead, he suggests a more accurate meaning of ''māyā'' is "appearance, not mere illusion".&lt;ref&gt;P. D. Shastri, [https://archive.org/details/thedoctrineofmaa00shaauoft The Doctrine of Maya] Luzac &amp; Co, London, page 5 and ix&lt;/ref&gt;

According to William Mahony, the root of the word may be ''man-'' or "to think", implying the role of imagination in the creation of the world. In early Vedic usage, the term implies, states Mahony, "the wondrous and mysterious  power to turn an idea into a physical reality".&lt;ref name=wmahonytau32&gt;William Mahony (1997), The Artful Universe: An Introduction to the Vedic Religious Imagination, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791435809}}, pages 32-33&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Teun Goudriaan (2008), Maya: Divine And Human, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120823891}}, pages 1-2&lt;/ref&gt;

Franklin Southworth states the word's origin is uncertain, and other possible roots of ''māyā'' include ''may-'' meaning mystify, confuse, intoxicate, delude, as well as ''māy-'' which means "disappear, be lost".&lt;ref&gt;Franklin Southworth (2012), Linguistic Archaeology of South Asia, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415655446}}, page 92&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jan Gonda]] considers the word related to ''mā'', which means "mother",&lt;ref name=jangonda/&gt; as do Tracy Pintchman&lt;ref&gt;Tracy Pintchman (1994), The Rise of the Goddess in the Hindu Tradition, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791421123}}, page 30, '''Quote:''' "This material power is thereby readily linked to maternal creativity, a link made evident in the Sanskrit noun ''mā'', meaning both "mother" and "measure".&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Adrian Snodgrass]],&lt;ref name=adriansnodgrass29/&gt; serving as an epithet for goddesses such as [[Lakshmi]].&lt;ref name=jangonda/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Monier Williams, A Sanskrit-English Dictionary Etymologically and Philologically Arranged, Oxford University Press, page 764 (Article on "मा"), Quote: 4.

====The Vedas====
Words related to and containing ''Māyā'', such as ''Mayava'', occur many times in the [[Vedas]]. These words have various meanings, with interpretations that are contested,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z3ksBrWoZm0C|title=Vedic Civilization|last=Pruthi|first=Raj|date=|publisher=Discovery Publishing House|year=2004|isbn=9788171418756|location=|pages=222–223|language=en|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some are names of deities that do not appear in texts of 1st millennium BCE and later. The use of word Māyā in Rig veda, in the later era context of "magic, illusion, power", occurs in many hymns. One titled [[Mayabheda|Māyā-bheda]] (मायाभेद:, Discerning Illusion) includes hymns 10.177.1 through 10.177.3, as the battle unfolds between the good and the evil, as follows,&lt;ref name=lauriepatton/&gt;

The wise behold with their mind in their heart the Sun, made manifest by the illusion of the [[Asura]];
The sages look into the solar orb, the ordainers desire the region of his rays.
The Sun bears the word in his mind; the Gandharva has spoken it within the wombs; 
sages cherish it in the place of sacrifice, brilliant, heavenly, ruling the mind.
I beheld the protector, never descending, going by his paths to the east and the west;
clothing the quarters of the heaven and the intermediate spaces. He constantly revolves in the midst of the worlds.

The above Maya-bheda hymn discerns, using symbolic language, a contrast between mind influenced by light (sun) and magic (illusion of Asura). The hymn is a call to discern one's enemies, perceive artifice, and distinguish, using one's mind, between that which is perceived and that which is unperceived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Bringing the Gods to Mind:Mantra and Ritual in Early Indian Sacrifice|author=Laurie L.

The contextual meaning of Maya in Atharvaveda is "power of creation", not illusion.&lt;ref name=beamsc/&gt; [[Jan Gonda|Gonda]] suggests the central meaning of Maya in Vedic literature is, "wisdom and power enabling its possessor, or being able itself, to create, devise, contrive, effect, or do something".&lt;ref name=teun&gt;Teun Goudriaan (2008), Maya: Divine And Human, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120823891}}, page 1, and 2-17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J.

====The Upanishads====
[[File:Waterfall.svg|thumb|[[M. C. Escher]] paintings such as the [[Waterfall (M. C. Escher)|Waterfall]] – redrawn in this sketch – demonstrates the Hindu concept of Maya, states Jeffrey Brodd.&lt;ref&gt;J Brodd, World Religions: A Voyage of Discovery, 3rd Edition, Saint Mary's Press, {{ISBN|978-0884899976}}, page 55&lt;/ref&gt; The impression of water-world the sketch gives, in reality is not what it seems.]]
The [[Upanishads]] describe the universe, and the human experience, as an interplay of [[Purusha]] (the eternal, unchanging principles, consciousness) and [[Prakṛti]] (the temporary, changing material world, nature).&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Deussen]], {{Google books|2h0YAAAAYAAJ|The Philosophy of the Upanishads|page=161}}, pages 161, 240-254&lt;/ref&gt; The former manifests itself as [[Ātman (Hinduism)|Ātman]] (Soul, Self), and the latter as Māyā. The Upanishads refer to the knowledge of Atman as "true knowledge" (''Vidya''), and the knowledge of Maya as "not true knowledge" (''Avidya'', Nescience, lack of awareness, lack of true knowledge).&lt;ref name=beamsc/&gt; [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]], states Ben-Ami Scharfstein, describes Maya as "the tendency to imagine something where it does not exist, for example, atman with the body".&lt;ref name=beamsc/&gt; To the Upanishads, knowledge includes empirical knowledge and spiritual knowledge, complete knowing necessarily includes understanding the hidden principles that work, the realization of the soul of things.

Hendrick Vroom explains, "The term ''Maya'' has been translated as 'illusion,' but then it does not concern normal illusion. Here 'illusion' does not mean that the world is not real and simply a figment of the human imagination. ''Maya'' means that the world is not as it seems; the world that one experiences is misleading as far as its true nature is concerned."&lt;ref&gt;H.M. Vroom (1996), No Other Gods, Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, {{ISBN|978-0802840974}}, page 57&lt;/ref&gt; Lynn Foulston states, "The world is both real and unreal because it exists but is 'not what it appears to be'."&lt;ref name=lynnfoulston/&gt; According to Wendy Doniger, "to say that the universe is an illusion (māyā) is not to say that it is unreal; it is to say, instead, that it is not what it seems to be, that it is something constantly being made. Māyā not only deceives people about the things they think they know; more basically, it limits their knowledge."&lt;ref&gt;Wendy Doniger O'Flaherty (1986), Dreams, Illusion, and Other Realities, University of Chicago Press, {{ISBN|978-0226618555}}, page 119&lt;/ref&gt;

Māyā pre-exists and co-exists with [[Brahman]] – the Ultimate Principle, Consciousness.&lt;ref name=aegough&gt;Archibald Edward Gough (2001), The Philosophy of the Upanishads and Ancient Indian Metaphysics, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415245227}}, pages 47-48&lt;/ref&gt; Maya is perceived reality, one that does not reveal the hidden principles, the true reality. Maya is unconscious, Atman is conscious. Maya is the literal, Brahman is the figurative ''Upādāna'' – the principle, the cause.&lt;ref name=aegough/&gt; Maya is born, changes, evolves, dies with time, from circumstances, due to invisible principles of nature, state the Upanishads. Atman-Brahman is eternal, unchanging, invisible principle, unaffected absolute and resplendent consciousness. Maya concept in the Upanishads, states Archibald Gough, is "the indifferent aggregate of all the possibilities of emanatory or derived existences, pre-existing with Brahman", just like the possibility of a future tree pre-exists in the seed of the tree.&lt;ref name=aegough/&gt;

The concept of Maya appears in numerous Upanishads. The verses 4.9 to 4.10 of [[Svetasvatara Upanishad]], is the oldest explicit occurrence of the idea that Brahman (Supreme Soul) is the hidden reality, nature is magic, Brahman is the magician, human beings are infatuated with the magic and thus they create bondage to illusions and delusions, and for freedom and liberation one must seek true insights and correct knowledge of the principles behind the hidden magic.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 1, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120814684}}, pages 316-317&lt;/ref&gt; Gaudapada in his Karika on [[Mandukya Upanishad]] explains the interplay of Atman and Maya as follows,&lt;ref name=pauldvol2&gt;Paul Deussen, Sixty Upanishads of the Veda, Volume 2, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120814691}}, page 618&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|
&lt;poem&gt;
The Soul is imagined first, then the particularity of objects,
External and internal, as one knows so one remembers.
As a rope, not perceived distinctly in dark, is erroneously imagined,
As snake, as a streak of water, so is the Soul (Atman) erroneously imagined.
As when the rope is distinctly perceived, and the erroneous imagination withdrawn,
Only the rope remains, without a second, so when distinctly perceived, the Atman.
When he as Pranas (living beings), as all the diverse objects appears to us,
Then it is all mere Maya, with which the Brahman (Supreme Soul) deceives himself.

Sarvasara Upanishad refers to two concepts: ''Mithya'' and ''Maya''.&lt;ref name=knaiyar/&gt; It defines ''Mithya'' as illusion and calls it one of three kinds of substances, along with Sat (Be-ness, True) and Asat (not-Be-ness, False).  ''Maya'', Sarvasara Upanishad defines as all what is not Atman. Maya has no beginning, but has an end. Maya, declares Sarvasara, is anything that can be studied and subjected to proof and disproof, anything with [[Guṇa]]s.&lt;ref name=knaiyar/&gt; In the human search for Self-knowledge, Maya is that which obscures, confuses and distracts an individual.&lt;ref name=knaiyar&gt;KN Aiyar (Translator, 1914), Sarvasara Upanishad, in Thirty Minor Upanishads, page 17, {{oclc|6347863}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The Puranas and Tamil texts====
[[File:Kamchipuram 4015.jpg|thumb|Markandeya sees Vishnu as an infant on a fig leaf in the deluge.]]

In [[Puranas]] and Vaishnava theology, ''māyā'' is described as one of the nine shaktis of [[Vishnu]].&lt;ref name="sb1"&gt;Bhattacharji, Sukumari (1970). The Indian Theogony: A Comparative Study of Indian Mythology from the Vedas to the Puraṇas, p.312-345. CUP Archive.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''Māyā'' became associated with sleep; and Vishnu's ''māyā'' is sleep which envelopes the world when he awakes to destroy evil. Vishnu, like Indra, is the master of ''māyā''; and ''māyā'' envelopes Vishnu's body.&lt;ref name="sb1"/&gt; The ''[[Bhagavata Purana]]'' narrates that the sage [[Markandeya]] requests Vishnu to experience his ''māyā''. Vishnu appears as an infant floating on a fig leaf in a deluge and then swallows the sage, the sole survivor of the cosmic flood. The sage sees various worlds of the universe, gods etc. and his own hermitage in the infant's belly. Then the infant breathes out the sage, who tries to embrace the infant, but everything disappears and the sage realizes that he was in his hermitage the whole time and was given a flavor of Vishnu's ''māyā''.&lt;ref name="Brown1990"&gt;{{cite book|author=Cheever Mackenzie Brown|title=The Triumph of the Goddess: The Canonical Models and Theological Visions of the Devi-Bhagavata Purana|year=1990|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-7914-0363-1|chapter=The two Bhagavatas|pages=27–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The magic creative power, ''Māyā'' was always a monopoly of the central Solar God; and was also associated with the early solar prototype of Vishnu in the early Aditya phase.&lt;ref name="sb1"/&gt;

Maya, to Shaiva Siddhanta sub-school of Hinduism, states Hilko Schomerus, is reality and truly existent, and one that exists to "provide Souls with ''Bhuvana'' (a world), ''Bhoga'' (objects of enjoyment), ''Tanu'' (a body) and ''Karana'' (organs)".&lt;ref&gt;Hilko Schomerus (2000), Śaiva Siddhānta: An Indian School of Mystical Thought, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120815698}}, page 118&lt;/ref&gt;

===Schools of Hinduism===
====Need to understand Māyā====
The various schools of Hinduism, particularly those based on naturalism ([[Vaisheshika|Vaiśeṣika]]), rationalism ([[Samkhya]]) or ritualism ([[Mimamsa]]), questioned and debated what is Maya, and the need to understand Maya.&lt;ref name=adishankarabr&gt;Adi Shankara (Translator: S Vireswarananda), Commentary on Brahma-sutras, Advaita Ashrama, pages 30-37, [https://archive.org/stream/BrahmaSutraBhashyaByAdiShankaracharyasanskrit.pdf/Brahma.Sutra.Bhashya.By.Adi.Shankaracharya.Sanskrit#page/n1/mode/2up Archive in Sanskrit], [http://www.estudantedavedanta.net/Brahma%20Sutras%20-%20According%20to%20Sri%20Sankara%20by%20Swami%20Vireswarananda%20&amp;#91;Sanskrit-English&amp;#93;.pdf Translated in English]&lt;/ref&gt; The Vedanta and Yoga schools explained that complete realization of knowledge requires both the understanding of ignorance, doubts and errors, as well as the understanding of invisible principles, incorporeal and the eternal truths. In matters of Self-knowledge, stated Shankara in his commentary on [[Taittiriya Upanishad]],&lt;ref name=adishankaratu/&gt; one is faced with the question, "Who is it that is trying to know, and how does he attain Brahman?" It is absurd, states Shankara, to speak of one becoming himself; because "Thou Art That" already. Realizing and removing ignorance is a necessary step, and this can only come from understanding Maya and then looking beyond it.&lt;ref name=adishankaratu&gt;Adi Shankara, {{Google books|d0oAAAAYAAJ|Commentary on Taittiriya Upanishad}}, SS Sastri (Translator), Harvard University Archives, pages 191-198&lt;/ref&gt;

The need to understand Maya is like the metaphorical need for road. Only when the country to be reached is distant, states Shankara, that a road must be pointed out. It is a meaningless contradiction to assert, "I am right now in my village, but I need a road to reach my village."&lt;ref name=adishankaratu/&gt; It is the confusion, ignorance and illusions that need to be repealed. It is only when the knower sees nothing else but his Self that he can be fearless and permanent.&lt;ref name=adishankarabr/&gt;&lt;ref name=adishankaratu/&gt; Vivekananda explains the need to understand Maya as follows (abridged),&lt;ref name=vivekananda7&gt;S Vivekananda, {{Google books|UAONAwAAQBAJ|The Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda}}, Volume 7, pages 63-65&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|
The Vedas cannot show you Brahman, you are That already. They can only help to take away the veil that hides truth from our eyes. The cessation of ignorance can only come when I know that God and I are one; in other words, identify yourself with Atman, not with human limitations. The idea that we are bound is only an illusion [Maya]. Freedom is inseparable from the nature of the Atman. This is ever pure, ever perfect, ever unchangeable.

[[Vācaspati Miśra]]'s commentary on the ''Samkhyakarika'', for example, questions the Maya doctrine saying "It is not possible to say that the notion of the phenomenal world being real is false, for there is no evidence to contradict it".&lt;ref name="nakamura"/&gt; Samkhya school steadfastly retained its duality concept of Prakrti and Purusha, both real and distinct, with some texts equating Prakrti to be Maya that is "not illusion, but real", with three [[Guṇa]]s in different proportions whose changing state of equilibrium defines the perceived reality.&lt;ref&gt;Teun Goudriaan (2008), Maya: Divine And Human, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120823891}}, pages 4 and 167&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James R. Ballantyne|James Ballantyne]], in 1885, commented on Kapila's Sánkhya aphorism 5.72{{refn|group=note|प्रकृतिपुरुष योरन्यत्सर्वमनित्यम् ॥७२॥}} which he translated as, "everything except nature and soul is uneternal". According to Ballantyne, this aphorism states that the mind, ether, etc. in a state of cause (not developed into a product) are called Nature and not Intellect. He adds, that scriptural texts such as [[Shvetashvatara Upanishad]] to be stating "He should know Illusion to be Nature and him in whom is Illusion to be the great Lord and the world to be pervaded by portions of him'; since Soul and Nature are also made up of parts, they must be uneternal".&lt;ref name=ballantyne373&gt;Ballantyne, James Robert (1885), The Sánkhya Aphorisms of Kapila, pp. 373-374 with footnote 6, Trubner's Oriental Series, Reprinted by Routledge (2000), {{ISBN|0415245141}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, acknowledges Ballantyne,&lt;ref name=ballantyne373/&gt; Edward Gough translates the same verse in [[Shvetashvatara Upanishad]] differently, 'Let the sage know that Prakriti is Maya and that Mahesvara is the Mayin, or arch-illusionist.

====Nyaya school====
The realism-driven Nyaya school of Hinduism denied that either the world (Prakrti) or the soul (Purusa) are an illusion. Naiyayikas developed theories of illusion, typically using the term ''Mithya'', and stated that illusion is simply flawed cognition, incomplete cognition or the absence of cognition.&lt;ref name= stephenphillipsnyaya/&gt; There is no deception in the reality of Prakrti or ''[[Pradhana]]'' (creative principle of matter/nature) or Purusa, only confusion or lack of comprehension or lack of cognitive effort, according to Nyaya scholars. To them, illusion has a cause, that rules of reason and proper ''[[Pramanas]]'' (epistemology) can uncover.&lt;ref name= stephenphillipsnyaya/&gt;

Illusion, stated Naiyayikas, involves the projection into current cognition of predicated content from memory (a form of rushing to interpret, judge, conclude). This "projection illusion" is misplaced, and stereotypes something to be what it is not.&lt;ref name=stephenphillipsnyaya&gt;Stephen H Phillips (2012), Epistemology in Classical India: The Knowledge Sources of the Nyaya School, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-1138008816}}, Chapter 3&lt;/ref&gt; The insights on theory of illusion by Nyaya scholars were later adopted and applied by Advaita Vedanta scholars.&lt;ref&gt;Bina Gupta (1995), Perceiving in Advaita Vedānta: Epistemological Analysis and Interpretation, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120812963}}, pages 29-38, 117-132&lt;/ref&gt;

====Yoga school====
Maya in Yoga school is the manifested world and implies divine force.&lt;ref name=teun66&gt;Teun Goudriaan (2008), Maya: Divine And Human, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120823891}}, page 66&lt;/ref&gt; Yoga and Maya are two sides of the same coin, states Zimmer, because what is referred to as Maya by living beings who are enveloped by it, is Yoga for the Brahman (Universal Principle, Supreme Soul) whose yogic perfection creates the Maya.&lt;ref&gt;HR Zimmer (1978), Maya: der indische Mythos, Insel-Verlag, {{ISBN|978-3458058816}}, page 62 (German), {{oclc|760396118}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maya is neither illusion nor denial of perceived reality to the Yoga scholars, rather Yoga is a means to perfect the "creative discipline of mind" and "body-mind force" to transform Maya.&lt;ref&gt;Teun Goudriaan (2008), Maya: Divine And Human, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120823891}}, pages 65-66&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of Yoga as power to create Maya has been adopted as a compound word ''Yogamaya'' (योगमाया) by the theistic sub-schools of Hinduism. It occurs in various mythologies of the Puranas; for example, Shiva uses his ''yogamāyā'' to transform Markendeya's heart in [[Bhagavata Purana]]'s chapter 12.10, while Krishna counsels Arjuna about ''yogamāyā'' in hymn 7.25 of [[Bhagavad Gita]].&lt;ref name=teun66/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/भगवद्गीता/ज्ञानविज्ञानयोगः भगवद्गीता/ज्ञानविज्ञानयोगः], Bhagavad Gita 7.25, Wikisource (Sanskrit)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Vedanta school====
Maya is a prominent and commonly referred to concept in Vedanta philosophies.&lt;ref&gt;PD Shastri, [https://archive.org/details/thedoctrineofmaa00shaauoft The Doctrine of Maya] Luzac &amp; Co, London, page 3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S. Radhakrishnan, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2376777 The Vedanta Philosophy and the Doctrine of Maya], International Journal of Ethics, Vol. 24, No. 4 (Jul., 1914), pages 431-451&lt;/ref&gt; Maya is often translated as "illusion", in the sense of "appearance".&lt;ref&gt;Donald Braue (2006), Maya in Radhakrishnan's Thought, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120822979}}, pages 19-21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joseph P. Schultz (1979), Judaism and the Gentile Faiths: Comparative Studies in Religion, Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press, {{ISBN|978-0838617076}}, page 93&lt;/ref&gt; Human mind constructs a subjective experience, states Vedanta school, which leads to the peril of misunderstanding Maya as well as interpreting Maya as the only and final reality. Vedantins assert the "perceived world including people are not what they appear to be".&lt;ref&gt;HM Vroom (1989), Religions and the Truth: Philosophical Reflections and Perspectives, Eerdmans Publishing, {{ISBN|978-0802805027}}, pages 122-123&lt;/ref&gt; There are invisible principles and laws at work, true invisible nature in others and objects, and invisible soul that one never perceives directly, but this invisible reality of Self and Soul exists, assert Vedanta scholars. Māyā is that which manifests, perpetuates a sense of false [[dualism (Indian philosophy)|duality]] (or divisional plurality).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Brodd | first = Jefferey | authorlink = | coauthors = | title = World Religions | publisher = Saint Mary's Press | year = 2003 | location = Winona, MN | pages = | url = | doi =  | isbn = 978-0-88489-725-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This manifestation is real, but it obfuscates and eludes the hidden principles and true nature of reality. Vedanta school holds that liberation is the unfettered realization and understanding of these invisible principles – the Self, that the Self (Soul) in oneself is same as the Self in another and the Self in everything (Brahman).&lt;ref&gt;PD Shastri, [https://archive.org/details/thedoctrineofmaa00shaauoft The Doctrine of Maya] Luzac &amp; Co, London, page 58-73&lt;/ref&gt; The difference within various sub-schools of Vedanta is the relationship between individual soul and cosmic soul (Brahman). Non-theistic Advaita sub-school holds that both are One, everyone is thus deeply connected Oneness, there is God in everyone and everything;&lt;ref&gt;A Rambachan (2006), The Advaita Worldview: God, World, and Humanity, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791468524}}, pages 47, 99-103&lt;/ref&gt; while theistic Dvaita and other sub-schools hold that individual souls and God's soul are distinct and each person can at best love God constantly to get one's soul infinitely close to His Soul.&lt;ref&gt;James Lewis and William Travis (1999), Religious Traditions of the World, {{ISBN|978-1579102302}}, pages 279-280&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Padiyath (2014), The Metaphysics of Becoming, De Gruyter, {{ISBN|978-3110342550}}, pages 155-157&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Advaita Vedanta'''

In [[Advaita Vedanta]] philosophy, there are two realities: ''Vyavaharika'' (empirical reality) and ''Paramarthika'' (absolute, spiritual reality).&lt;ref name=fredfost&gt;Frederic F. Fost (1998), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1400333 Playful Illusion: The Making of Worlds in Advaita Vedānta], Philosophy East and West, Vol. 48, No. 3 (Jul., 1998), pages 387-405&lt;/ref&gt; Māyā is the empirical reality that entangles consciousness. Māyā has the power to create a bondage to the empirical world, preventing the unveiling of the true, unitary Self—the Cosmic Spirit also known as [[Brahman]]. The theory of māyā was developed by the ninth-century Advaita Hindu philosopher [[Adi Shankara]]. However, competing theistic Dvaita scholars contested Shankara's theory,&lt;ref&gt;Surendranath Dasgupta, ''A History of Indian Philosophy.'' Cambridge University Press Archive, 1955, page 1. "He [Bhaskara] speaks in very strong terms against the commentator [Shankara] who holds the ''māyā'' doctrine and is a Buddhist in his views. But, though he was opposed to Shankara, it was only so far as Shankara had introduced the ''māyā'' doctrine, and only so far as he thought the world had sprung forth not as a real modification of Brahman, but only through ''māyā''."&lt;/ref&gt; and stated that Shankara did not offer a theory of the relationship between Brahman and Māyā.&lt;ref&gt;Pratima Bowes, "Mysticism in the Upanishads and Shankara's Vedanta" in Karel Werner, ed., ''The Yogi and the Mystic." Routledge, 1995, page 67.&lt;/ref&gt; A later Advaita scholar Prakasatman addressed this, by explaining, "Maya and Brahman together constitute the entire universe, just like two kinds of interwoven threads create a fabric. Maya is the manifestation of the world, whereas Brahman, which supports Maya, is the cause of the world."&lt;ref&gt;Esther Abraham Solomon (1969), Avidyā: A Problem of Truth and Reality, {{oclc|658823}}, pages 269-270&lt;/ref&gt;

Māyā is a fact in that it is the appearance of phenomena. Since Brahman is the sole metaphysical truth, Māyā is true in epistemological and empirical sense; however, Māyā is not the metaphysical and spiritual truth. The spiritual truth is the truth forever, while what is empirical truth is only true for now. Since Māyā is the perceived material world, it is true in perception context, but is "untrue" in spiritual context of Brahman. Māyā is not false, it only clouds the inner Self and principles that are real. True Reality includes both ''Vyavaharika'' (empirical) and ''Paramarthika'' (spiritual), the Māyā and the Brahman. The goal of spiritual enlightenment, state Advaitins, is to realize Brahman, realize the fearless, resplendent Oneness.&lt;ref name=fredfost/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Arvind Sharma (2007), Advaita Vedānta: An Introduction, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120820272}}, pages 19-40, 53-58, 79-86&lt;/ref&gt;

Vivekananda said: "When the Hindu says the world is Maya, at once people get the idea that the world is an illusion. This interpretation has some basis, as coming through the Buddhistic philosophers, because there was one section of philosophers who did not believe in the external world at all. But the Maya of the Vedanta, in its last developed form, is neither Idealism nor Realism, nor is it a theory. It is a simple statement of facts — what we are and what we see around us."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ramakrishnavivekananda.info/vivekananda/volume_2/jnana-yoga/maya_and_illusion.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buddhism==

{{see also|Kleshas (Buddhism)|Maya (Buddhist mental factor)|Maya (mother of the Buddha)}}
The [[Early Buddhist Texts]] contain some references to illusion, the most well known of which is the ''Pheṇapiṇḍūpama Sutta'' in Pali (and with a Chinese Agama parallel at SĀ 265) which states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Suppose, monks, that a magician (māyākāro) or a magician’s apprentice (māyākārantevāsī) would display a magical illusion (māyaṃ) at a crossroads. A man with good sight would inspect it, ponder, and carefully investigate it, and it would appear to him to be void (rittaka), hollow (tucchaka), coreless (asāraka). For what core (sāro) could there be in a magical illusion (māyāya)? So too, monks, whatever kind of cognition there is, whether past, future, or present, internal or external, gross or subtle, inferior or superior, far or near: a monk inspects it, ponders it, and carefully investigates it, and it would appear to him to be void (rittaka), hollow (tucchaka), coreless (asāraka). For what core (sāro) could there be in cognition?&lt;ref&gt;Shi Huifeng. ''Is “Illusion” a Prajñāpāramitā Creation? The Birth and Death of a Buddhist Cognitive Metaphor.'' Fo Guang University. Journal of Buddhist Philosophy, Vol. 2, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One sutra in the Āgama collection known as "Mahāsūtras" of the (Mūla)Sarvāstivādin tradition entitled the ''Māyājāla'' (Net of Illusion) deals especially with the theme of Maya. This sutra only survives in Tibetan translation and compares the five aggregates with further metaphors for illusion, including: an echo, a reflection in a mirror, a mirage, sense pleasures in a dream and a madman wandering naked.&lt;ref&gt;Shi Huifeng. ''Is “Illusion” a Prajñāpāramitā Creation? The Birth and Death of a Buddhist Cognitive Metaphor.'' Fo Guang University. Journal of Buddhist Philosophy, Vol. 2, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

These texts give the impression that māyā refers to the insubstantial and essence-less nature of things as well as their deceptive, false and vain character.&lt;ref&gt;Shi Huifeng. ''Is “Illusion” a Prajñāpāramitā Creation? The Birth and Death of a Buddhist Cognitive Metaphor.'' Fo Guang University. Journal of Buddhist Philosophy, Vol. 2, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; 

Later texts such as the [[Lalitavistara]] also contain references to illusion:

:"Complexes have no inner might, are empty in themselves; Rather like the stem of the plantain tree, when one reflects on them, Like an illusion (māyopama) which deludes the mind (citta), Like an empty fist with which a child is teased."&lt;ref&gt;Shi Huifeng. ''Is “Illusion” a Prajñāpāramitā Creation? The Birth and Death of a Buddhist Cognitive Metaphor.'' Fo Guang University. Journal of Buddhist Philosophy, Vol. 2, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Salistamba Sutra]] also puts much emphasis on illusion, describing all dharmas as being “characterized as illusory” and “vain, hollow, without core”. Likewise the Mahāvastu, a highly influential Mahāsāṃghikan text on the life of the Buddha, states that the Buddha “has shown that the aggregates are like a lightning flash, as a bubble, or as the white foam on a wave.”&lt;ref&gt;Shi Huifeng. ''Is “Illusion” a Prajñāpāramitā Creation? The Birth and Death of a Buddhist Cognitive Metaphor.'' Fo Guang University. Journal of Buddhist Philosophy, Vol. 2, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theravada===
In [[Theravada|Theravada Buddhism]] 'Māyā' is the name of the mother of the Buddha as well as a metaphor for the consciousness aggregate (''viññana''). The Theravada monk Bhikkhu Bodhi considers the Pali ''Pheṇapiṇḍūpama Sutta'' “one of the most radical discourses on the empty nature of conditioned phenomena.”&lt;ref&gt;Shi Huifeng. ''Is “Illusion” a Prajñāpāramitā Creation? The Birth and Death of a Buddhist Cognitive Metaphor.'' Fo Guang University. Journal of Buddhist Philosophy, Vol. 2, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Bodhi also cites the Pali commentary on this sutra, the ''Sāratthappakāsinī'' (Spk), which states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Cognition is like a magical illusion (māyā) in the sense that it is insubstantial and cannot be grasped. Cognition is even more transient and fleeting than a magical illusion. For it gives the impression that a person comes and goes, stands and sits, with the same mind, but the mind is different in each of these activities. Cognition deceives the multitude like a magical illusion (māyā).&lt;ref&gt;Bodhi, Connected Discourses of the Buddha Vol I p. 1087, n. 194.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Likewise, Bhikkhu [[Katukurunde Nyanananda Thera]] has written an exposition of the ''Kàlakàràma Sutta'' which features the image of a magical illusion as its central metaphor.&lt;ref&gt;Katukurunde Nyanananda Thera. The Magic of the Mind (PDF), Buddhist Publication Society, 1974, OCLC 2999880&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sarvastivada===
The ''Nyānānusāra Śāstra'', a Vaibhāṣika response to [[Vasubandhu]]’s [[Abhidharmakosha]] cites the ''Māyājāla sutra'' and explains:

&lt;blockquote&gt;“Seeing an illusory object (māyā)”: Although what one apprehends is unreal, nothing more than an illusory sign. If one does not admit this much, then an illusory sign should be non-existent. What is an illusory sign? It is the result of illusion magic. Just as one with higher gnosis can magically create forms, likewise this illusory sign does actually have manifestation and shape. Being produced by illusion magic, it acts as the object of vision. That object which is taken as really existent is in fact ultimately non-existent. Therefore, this [Māyājāla] Sūtra states that it is non-existent, due to the illusory object there is a sign but not substantiality. Being able to beguile and deceive one, it is known as a “deceiver of the eye.”&lt;ref&gt;Shi Huifeng. ''Is “Illusion” a Prajñāpāramitā Creation? The Birth and Death of a Buddhist Cognitive Metaphor.'' Fo Guang University. Journal of Buddhist Philosophy, Vol. 2, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Mahayana===
In [[Mahayana sutras]], illusion is an important theme of the [[Prajñāpāramitā]] sutras. Here, the magician's illusion exemplifies how people misunderstand and misperceive reality, which is in fact empty of any essence and cannot be grasped. The Mahayana uses similar metaphors for illusion: magic, a dream, a bubble, a rainbow, lightning, the moon reflected in water, a mirage, and a city of celestial musicians." &lt;ref&gt;Thinley Norbe Rinpoche in The Dzogchen Primer, Marcia Binder Schmidt ed. Shambala, Boston, 2002, pg. 215 {{ISBN|1-57062-829-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Understanding that what we experience is less substantial than we believe is intended to serve the purpose of liberation from ignorance, fear, and clinging and the attainment of enlightenment as a Buddha completely dedicated to the welfare of all beings. The Prajñaparamita texts also state that all dharmas (phenomena) are like an illusion, not just the [[five aggregates]], but all beings, including [[Bodhisattva]]s and even [[Nirvana]].&lt;ref&gt;Shi Huifeng. ''Is “Illusion” a Prajñāpāramitā Creation? The Birth and Death of a Buddhist Cognitive Metaphor.'' Fo Guang University. Journal of Buddhist Philosophy, Vol. 2, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Prajñaparamita-ratnaguna-samcayagatha'' (Rgs) states:

:This gnosis shows him all beings as like an illusion, Resembling a great crowd of people, conjured up at the crossroads, By a magician, who then cuts off many thousands of heads; He knows this whole living world as a magical creation, and yet remains without fear. ''Rgs'' 1:19 
And also:
:Those who teach Dharma, and those who listen when it is being taught; Those who have won the fruition of a Worthy One, a Solitary Buddha, or a World Savior; And the nirvāṇa obtained by the wise and learned— All is born of illusion—so has the Tathāgata declared. - ''Rgs'' 2:5 &lt;ref&gt;Shi Huifeng. ''Is “Illusion” a Prajñāpāramitā Creation? The Birth and Death of a Buddhist Cognitive Metaphor.'' Fo Guang University. Journal of Buddhist Philosophy, Vol. 2, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Ven. Dr. Huifeng, what this means is that Bodhisattvas see through all conceptualizations and conceptions, for they are deceptive and illusory, and sever or cut off all these cognitive creations.&lt;ref&gt;Shi Huifeng. ''Is “Illusion” a Prajñāpāramitā Creation? The Birth and Death of a Buddhist Cognitive Metaphor.'' Fo Guang University. Journal of Buddhist Philosophy, Vol. 2, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; 

Depending on the stage of the practitioner, the magical illusion is experienced differently. In the ordinary state, we get attached to our own mental phenomena, believing they are real, like the audience at a magic show gets attached to the illusion of a beautiful lady. At the next level, called actual relative truth, the beautiful lady appears, but the magician does not get attached.  Lastly, at the ultimate level, the Buddha is not affected one way or the other by the illusion. Beyond conceptuality, the Buddha is neither attached nor non-attached.&lt;ref&gt;Thinley Norbe Rinpoche in The Dzogchen Primer, Marcia Binder Schmidt ed. Shambala, Boston, 2002, pg. 217 {{ISBN|1-57062-829-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the middle way of Buddhism, which explicitly refutes the extremes of both eternalism and [[nihilism]].

[[Nāgārjuna]]'s [[Madhyamaka]] philosophy discusses ''nirmita'', or illusion closely related to māyā.  In this example, the illusion is a self-awareness that is, like the magical illusion, mistaken. For Nagarjuna, the self is not the organizing command center of experience, as we might think.  Actually, it is just one element combined with other factors and strung together in a sequence of causally connected moments in time. As such, the self is not substantially real, but neither can it be shown to be unreal. The continuum of moments, which we mistakenly understand to be a solid, unchanging self, still performs actions and undergoes their results. "As a magician creates a magical illusion by the force of magic, and the illusion produces another illusion, in the same way the agent is a magical illusion and the action done is the illusion created by another illusion."&lt;ref&gt;Nagarjuna's Mulamadhyamakakarika Prajna Nama, J.W. DeJong, Christian Lindtner (eds.) quoted in Nagarjuna's Madhyamaka: A Philosophical Introduction, Jan Westerhoff, Oxford University Press, New York, 2009. p. 163 {{ISBN|978-0-19-537521-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; What we experience may be an illusion, but we are living inside the illusion and bear the fruits of our actions there. We undergo the experiences of the illusion. What we do affects what we experience, so it matters.&lt;ref&gt;Nagarjuna's Madhyamaka: A Philosophical Introduction, Jan Westerhoff, Oxford University Press, New York, 2009. p. 164 {{ISBN|978-0-19-537521-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this example, Nagarjuna uses the magician's illusion to show that the self is not as real as it thinks, yet, to the extent it is inside the illusion, real enough to warrant respecting the ways of the world.

For the Mahayana Buddhist, the self is māyā like a magic show and so are objects in the world. Vasubandhu's ''Trisvabhavanirdesa'', a Mahayana [[Yogacara]] "Mind Only" text, discusses the example of the magician who makes a piece of wood appear as an elephant.&lt;ref name="autogenerated61"&gt;The Emptiness of Emptiness: An Introduction to Early Indian Madhyamika.  C.W. Huntingdon, Jr. with Geshe Namgyal Wangchen, University of Hawaii Press, Honolulu, 1989, {{ISBN|0-8248-1165-8}}, p.61-62.&lt;/ref&gt;  The audience is looking at a piece of wood but, under the spell of magic, perceives an elephant instead.  Instead of believing in the reality of the illusory elephant, we are invited to recognize that multiple factors are involved in creating that perception, including our involvement in dualistic subjectivity, causes and conditions, and the ultimate beyond duality. Recognizing how these factors combine to create what we perceive ordinarily, ultimate reality appears. Perceiving that the elephant is illusory is akin to seeing through the magical illusion, which reveals the [[dharmadhatu]], or ground of being.&lt;ref name="autogenerated61"/&gt;

===Tantra===
Buddhist [[Tantra]], a further development of the Mahayana, also makes use of the magician's illusion example in yet another way. In the completion stage of Buddhist Tantra, the practitioner takes on the form of a deity in an illusory body (māyādeha), which is like the magician's illusion. It is made of wind, or [[prana]], and is called illusory because it appears only to other [[yogis]] who have also attained the illusory body. The illusory body has the markings and signs of a Buddha. There is an impure and a pure illusory body, depending on the stage of the yogi's practice.&lt;ref&gt;Highest Yoga Tantra: An Introduction to the Esoteric Buddhism of Tibet, Daniel Cozort, Snow Lion Publications, Ithaca, NY 1986, pgs. 94-95.  {{ISBN|0-937938-32-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept that the world is an illusion is controversial in Buddhism. The Buddha does not state that the world is an illusion, but ''like'' an illusion. In the [[Dzogchen]] tradition the ''perceived reality'' is considered literally unreal, in that objects which make-up perceived reality are known as objects within one's mind, and that, ''as we conceive them'', there is no pre-determined object, or assembly of objects in isolation from experience that may be considered the "true" object, or objects. As a prominent contemporary teacher puts it: "In a real sense, all the visions that we see in our lifetime are like a big dream [...]".&lt;ref name="ChNN_dream_yoga_book"&gt;[[Chögyal Namkhai Norbu]] ''Dream Yoga And The Practice Of Natural Light'' Edited and introduced by Michael Katz, Snow Lion Publications, Ithaca, NY, {{ISBN|1-55939-007-7}}, pp. 42, 46, 48, 96, 105.&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, the term ''visions'' denotes not only visual perceptions, but appearances perceived through all senses, including sounds, smells, tastes and tactile sensations.

Different schools and traditions in [[Tibetan Buddhism]] give different explanations of the mechanism producing the illusion usually called "reality".&lt;ref&gt;Elías Capriles.

==Jainism==

''Maya'', in Jainism, means appearances or deceit that prevents one from ''Samyaktva'' (right belief). Maya is one of three causes of failure to reach right belief. The other two are ''Mithyatva'' (false belief)&lt;ref&gt;JL Jaini (Editor: FW Thomas), Outlines of Jainism, Jain Literature Society, Cambridge University Press Archive, page 94&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Nidana'' (hankering after fame and worldly pleasures).&lt;ref&gt;Robert Williams (1998), Jaina Yoga: A Survey of the Mediaeval Śrāvakācāras, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120807754}}, page 50&lt;/ref&gt;

''Maya'' is a closely related concept to ''Mithyatva'', with Maya a source of wrong information while Mithyatva an individual's attitude to knowledge, with relational overlap.

[[Śvētāmbara|Svetambara]] Jains classify categories of false belief under ''Mithyatva'' into five: ''Abhigrahika'' (false belief that is limited to one's own scriptures that one can defend, but refusing to study and analyze other scriptures); ''Anabhigrahika'' (false belief that equal respect must be shown to all gods, teachers, scriptures); ''Abhiniviseka'' (false belief resulting from pre-conceptions with a lack of discernment and refusal to do so); ''Samsayika'' (state of hesitation or uncertainty between various conflicting, inconsistent beliefs); and ''Anabhogika'' (innate, default false beliefs that a person has not thought through on one's own).&lt;ref name=robertwilliams48&gt;Robert Williams (1998), Jaina Yoga: A Survey of the Mediaeval Śrāvakācāras, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120807754}}, pages 47-49&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Digambara]] Jains classify categories of false belief under ''Mithyatva'' into seven: ''Ekantika'' (absolute, one sided false belief), ''Samsayika'' (uncertainty, doubt whether a course is right or wrong, unsettled belief, skepticism), ''Vainayika'' (false belief that all gods, gurus and scriptures are alike, without critical examination), ''Grhita'' (false belief derived purely from habits or default, no self-analysis), ''Viparita'' (false belief that true is false, false is true, everything is relative or acceptable), ''Naisargika'' (false belief that all living beings are devoid of consciousness and cannot discern right from wrong), ''Mudha-drsti'' (false belief that violence and anger can tarnish or damage thoughts, divine, guru or [[dharma]]).&lt;ref name=robertwilliams48/&gt;

''Māyā'' (deceit) is also considered as one of four ''[[Kashaya (Jainism)|Kaṣaya]]'' (faulty passion, a trigger for actions) in Jain philosophy. The other three are ''Krodha'' (anger), ''Māna'' (pride) and ''Lobha'' (greed).&lt;ref&gt;Robert Williams (1998), Jaina Yoga: A Survey of the Mediaeval Śrāvakācāras, Motilal Banarsidass, {{ISBN|978-8120807754}}, page 33&lt;/ref&gt; The ancient Jain texts recommend that one must subdue these four faults, as they are source of bondage, attachment and non-spiritual passions.&lt;ref&gt;P Jaini (1998), The Jaina Path of Purification, Motilal Banarsidass. {{ISBN|81-20815785}}, pages 119-122&lt;/ref&gt;

When he wishes that which is good for him, he should get rid of the four faults — Krodha, Māna, Māyā and Lobha — which increase evil. Anger and pride when not suppressed, and deceit and greed when arising: all these four black passions water the roots of re-birth.

==Sikhism==
[[File:Khanda Orange.jpg|thumb|120px|Sikhism]]
In [[Sikhism]], the [[world]] is regarded as both transitory and relatively [[reality|real]].&lt;ref name="Kohli"&gt;Surinder Singh Kohli, ''Guru Granth Sahib: An Analytical Study.'' Singh Brothers, Amritsar, 1992, page 262.&lt;/ref&gt; [[God in Sikhism|God]] is viewed as the only reality, but within God exist both [[conscious]] [[souls]] and [[Consciousness|nonconscious]] objects; these created objects are also real.&lt;ref name="Kohli" /&gt; [[Natural]] [[phenomena]] are real but the effects they generate are unreal. māyā is as the events are real yet māyā is not as the effects are unreal. Sikhism believes that people are trapped in the world because of five vices: lust, anger, greed, attachment, and ego. Maya enables these five vices and makes a person think the physical world is "real," whereas, the goal of Sikhism is to rid the self of them. Consider the following example: In the moonless night, a [[rope]] lying on the ground may be mistaken for a [[snake]]. We know that the rope alone is real, not the snake. However, the failure to perceive the rope gives rise to the false [[perception]] of the snake. Once the darkness is removed, the rope alone remains; the snake disappears.

* ''Sakti adher jevarhee bhram chookaa nihchal siv ghari vaasaa.''&lt;br /&gt;In the darkness of māyā, I mistook the rope for the snake, but that is over, and now I dwell in the eternal home of the Lord.&lt;br /&gt;(Sri Guru Granth Sahib 332).
* ''Raaj bhuiang prasang jaise hahi ab kashu maram janaaiaa.''&lt;br /&gt;Like the story of the rope mistaken for a snake, the mystery has now been explained to me. Like the many bracelets, which I mistakenly thought were gold; now, I do not say what I said then. (Sri Guru Granth Sahib 658).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gurbani.org/articles/webart14.htm Deceptive māyā]&lt;/ref&gt;

In some [[mythologies]] the [[symbol]] of the snake was associated with [[money]], and māyā in modern [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] refers to money. However, in the [[Guru Granth Sahib]] māyā refers to the "grand illusion" of [[materialism]]. From this māyā all other [[evil]]s are born, but by understanding the nature of māyā a [[person]] begins to approach [[spirituality]].

* ''Janam baritha jāṯ rang mā▫i▫ā kai. ||1|| rahā▫o.''&lt;br /&gt;You are squandering this life uselessly in the love of māyā.&lt;br /&gt;Sri Guru Granth Sahib M.5 Guru Arjan Dev ANG 12

The teachings of the [[Sikh Guru]]s push the idea of [[Selfless service|sewa]] (selfless service) and [[simran]] ([[prayer]], [[meditation]], or remembering one's true [[death]]). The depths of these two [[concept]]s and the core of [[Sikhism]] comes from [[sangat (term)|sangat]] (congregation): by joining the congregation of true [[saints]] one is [[salvation|saved]]. By contrast, most people are believed to suffer from the [[false consciousness]] of materialism, as described in the following extracts from the Guru Granth Sahib:

* ''Mā▫i▫ā mohi visāri▫ā jagaṯ piṯā parṯipāl.''&lt;br /&gt;In attachment to māyā, they have forgotten the Father, the Cherisher of the World.&lt;br /&gt;Sri Guru Granth Sahib M3 Guru Amar Das  ANG 30
* ''Ih sarīr mā▫i▫ā kā puṯlā vicẖ ha▫umai ḏustī pā▫ī.''&lt;br /&gt;This body is the [[puppet]] of māyā. The evil of [[egotism]] is within it.&lt;br /&gt;Sri Guru Granth Sahib M3 Guru Amar Das
* ''Bābā mā▫i▫ā bẖaram bẖulā▫e.''&lt;br /&gt;O Baba, māyā deceives with its illusion.&lt;br /&gt;Sri Guru Granth Sahib M1 Guru Nanak Dev ANG 60
* "For that which we cannot see, feel, smell, touch, or understand, we do not believe. For this, we are merely fools walking on the grounds of great potential with no comprehension of what is."&lt;br /&gt;[[Buddhist]] [[monk]] quotation&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/search?q=māyā+site:srigranth.org&amp;hl=en&amp;rlz=1T4ADBF_en-GBGB267GB268&amp;start=10&amp;sa=N extracts on māyā from Guru Granth Sahib]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mechanical–electrical analogies''' are the representation of [[mechanical system]]s as [[electrical network]]s.  At first, such analogies were used in reverse to help explain [[electrical phenomena]] in familiar mechanical terms.  [[James Clerk Maxwell]] introduced analogies of this sort in the 19th century.  However, as [[Network analysis (electrical circuits)|electrical network analysis]] matured it was found that certain mechanical problems could more easily be solved through an electrical [[analogy]].  Theoretical developments in the electrical domain&lt;ref name=":0" group="note" /&gt; that were particularly useful where the representation of an electrical network as an abstract topological diagram (the [[circuit diagram]]) using the [[lumped element model]] and the ability of network analysis to [[Network synthesis filters|synthesise a network]] to meet a prescribed [[frequency function]].

This approach is especially useful in the design of [[mechanical filter]]s—these use mechanical devices to implement an electrical function.  However, the technique can be used to solve purely mechanical problems, and can also be extended into other, unrelated, energy domains.  Nowadays, analysis by analogy is a standard design tool wherever more than one energy domain is involved.  It has the major advantage that the entire system can be represented in a unified, coherent way.  Electrical analogies are particularly used by [[transducer]] designers, by their nature they cross energy domains, and in [[control system]]s, whose [[sensor]]s and [[actuator]]s will typically be domain-crossing transducers.  A given system being represented by an electrical analogy may conceivably have no electrical parts at all.  For this reason domain-neutral terminology is preferred when developing network diagrams for control systems.

Mechanical–electrical analogies are developed by finding relationships between variables in one domain that have a mathematical form identical to variables in the other domain.  There is no one, unique way of doing this; numerous analogies are theoretically possible, but there are two analogies that are widely used: the [[impedance analogy]] and the [[mobility analogy]].  The impedance analogy makes force and voltage analogous while the mobility analogy makes force and current analogous.  By itself, that is not enough to fully define the analogy, a second variable must be chosen.  A common choice is to make pairs of power [[Conjugate variables (thermodynamics)|conjugate variables]] analogous.  These are variables which when multiplied together have units of power.  In the impedance analogy, for instance, this results in force and velocity being analogous to voltage and current respectively.

Variations of these analogies are used for rotating mechanical systems, such as in [[electric motor]]s.  In the impedance analogy, instead of force, [[torque]] is made analogous to voltage.  It is perfectly possible that both versions of the analogy are needed in, say, a system that includes rotating and [[reciprocating motion|reciprocating]] parts, in which case a force-torque analogy is required within the mechanical domain and a force-torque-voltage analogy to the electrical domain.  Another variation is required for acoustical systems; here pressure and voltage are made analogous (impedance analogy).  In the impedance analogy, the ratio of the power conjugate variables is always a quantity analogous to [[electrical impedance]].  For instance force/velocity is [[mechanical impedance]].  The mobility analogy does not preserve this analogy between impedances across domains, but it does have another advantage over the impedance analogy.  In the mobility analogy the topology of networks is preserved, a [[mechanical network]] diagram has the same topology as its analogous electrical network diagram.

== Applications ==
Mechanical–electrical analogies are used to represent the function of a mechanical system as an equivalent electrical system by drawing analogies between mechanical and electrical parameters.  A mechanical system by itself can be so represented, but analogies are of greatest use in [[electromechanics|electromechanical systems]] where there is a connection between mechanical and electrical parts.  Analogies are especially useful in analysing [[mechanical filter]]s.  These are filters constructed of mechanical parts but designed to work in an electrical circuit through [[transducer]]s.  Circuit theory is well developed in the electrical domain in general and in particular there is a wealth of filter theory available.  Mechanical systems can make use of this electrical theory in mechanical designs through a mechanical–electrical analogy.&lt;ref&gt;Busch-Vishniac, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

Mechanical–electrical analogies are useful in general where the system includes [[transducer]]s between different energy domains.&lt;ref group="note" name=":0"&gt;An '''energy domain''' pertains to a system or subsystem in which the energy and forces are all of a particular kind such as electrical, mechanical, acoustical, thermal, and so on.&lt;/ref&gt;  Another area of application is the mechanical parts of [[acoustics|acoustic systems]] such as the [[magnetic cartridge|pickup]] and [[tonearm]] of [[record player]]s.  This was of some importance in early phonographs where the audio is transmitted from the pickup needle to the horn through various mechanical components entirely without electrical amplification.  Early phonographs suffered badly from unwanted [[resonance]]s in the mechanical parts.  It was found that these could be eliminated by treating the mechanical parts as components of a [[low-pass filter]] which has the effect of flattening out the [[passband]].&lt;ref&gt;Darlington, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Electrical analogies of mechanical systems can be used just as a teaching aid, to help understand the behaviour of the mechanical system.  In former times, up to about the early 20th century, it was more likely that the reverse analogy would be used; mechanical analogies were formed of the then little understood electrical phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;Care, pp. 74-77&lt;/ref&gt;

== Forming an analogy ==
Electrical systems are commonly described by means of a [[circuit diagram]].  These are network diagrams that describe the [[topology (electrical circuits)|topology of the electrical system]] using a specialised [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]] notation.   The circuit diagram does not try and represent the true physical dimensions of the electrical components or their actual spatial relationship to each other.  This is possible because the electrical components are represented as ideal lumped elements, that is, the element is treated as if it is occupying a single point (lumped at that point).  Non-ideal components can be accommodated in this model by using more than one element to represent the component.  For instance, a [[electromagnetic coil|coil]] intended for use as an [[inductor]] has [[Electrical resistance|resistance]] as well as [[inductance]].  This can be represented on the circuit diagram as a [[resistor]] in series with an inductor.&lt;ref&gt;Chan, pp. 2-3&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, the first step in forming an analogy of a mechanical system is to describe it as a mechanical network in a similar way, that is, as a topological graph of ideal elements.&lt;ref&gt;Busch-Vishniac, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;  Alternative, more abstract, representations to the circuit diagram are possible, for instance the [[bond graph]].&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Busch-Vishniac, pp. 17-18|Borutzky}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Mobility analogy resonator vertical.svg|thumb|A mechanical network diagram of a simple resonator (top) and one possible electrical analogy for it (bottom)]]In an electrical network diagram, limited to [[linear system]]s, there are three [[Passivity (engineering)|passive]] elements: resistance, inductance, and [[capacitance]]; and two active elements: the [[voltage source|voltage generator]], and the [[current source|current generator]].&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The five-element scheme can be extended to active devices such as transistors by the use of [[two-port network]]s containing [[dependent source|dependent generators]] provided the transistor is operating in a substantially linear region.&lt;/ref&gt;  The mechanical analogs of these elements can be used to construct a [[mechanical network]] diagram.  What the mechanical analogs of these elements are depends on what variables are chosen to be the fundamental variables.  There is a wide choice of variables that can be used, but most commonly used are a power [[Conjugate variables (thermodynamics)|conjugate pair of variables]] (described below) and the pair of Hamiltonian variables derived from these.&lt;ref&gt;Busch-Vishniac, pp. 18, 21&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a limit to the applicability of this [[lumped element model]].  The model works well if the components are small enough that the time taken for a wave to cross them is insignificant, or equivalently, if there is no significant [[phase (waves)|phase]] difference in the wave either side of the component.  What amounts to significant depends on how accurate the model is required to be, but a common [[rule of thumb]] is to require components to be smaller than one sixteenth of a [[wavelength]].&lt;ref&gt;Kleiner, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt;  Since wavelength decreases with frequency, this puts an upper limit on the frequency that can be covered in this kind of design.  This limit is much lower in the mechanical domain than the equivalent limit in the electrical domain.  This is because the much higher propagation speeds in the electrical domain lead to longer wavelengths (mechanical vibrations in steel propagate at about 6,000&amp;nbsp;m/s,&lt;ref&gt;Myers, p. 136&lt;/ref&gt; electromagnetic waves in common cable types propagate at about {{nowrap|2 x 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; m/s}}&lt;ref&gt;White, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;).  For instance, traditional mechanical filters are only made up to around 600&amp;nbsp;kHz&lt;ref&gt;Carr, pp. 170-172&lt;/ref&gt; (although [[MEMS]] devices can operate at much higher frequencies due to their very small size).  In the electrical domain, on the other hand, the transition from the lumped element model to the [[distributed element model]] occurs in the hundreds of megahertz region.&lt;ref&gt;Froehlich &amp; Kent, vol. 6, p. 434&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases it is possible to continue using a topological network diagram even when components needing a distributed element analysis are present.  In the electrical domain, a [[transmission line]], a basic distributed element component, can be included in the model with the introduction of the additional element of [[electrical length]].&lt;ref&gt;Joines ''et al.'', pp. 69-71&lt;/ref&gt;  The transmission line is a special case because it is invariant along its length and hence the full geometry need not be modelled.&lt;ref&gt;Radmanesh, p. 214&lt;/ref&gt;  Another way of dealing with distributed elements is to use a [[finite element analysis]] whereaby the distributed element is approximated by a large number of small lumped elements.  Just such an approach was used in one paper to model the [[cochlea]] of the human ear.&lt;ref&gt;Fukazawa &amp; Tanaka, pp. 191-192&lt;/ref&gt;  Another condition required of electrical systems for the application of the lumped element model is that no significant [[Field (physics)|field]]s exist outside the component since these can [[Coupling (physics)|couple]] to other unrelated components.&lt;ref&gt;Agarwal &amp; Lang, pp. 9-11&lt;/ref&gt;  However, these effects can often be modelled by introducing some virtual lumped elements called strays or [[Parasitic element (electrical networks)|parasitics]].&lt;ref&gt;Semmlow, p. 405&lt;/ref&gt;  An analog of this in mechanical systems is vibration in one component being coupled to an unrelated component.&lt;ref&gt;Sen, pp. 29, 41&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Power conjugate variables ===
The power conjugate variables are a pair of variables whose product is power.  In the electrical domain the power conjugate variables chosen are invariably [[voltage]] (''v'') and [[Current (electricity)|current]] (''i'').  Thus, the power conjugate variables in the mechanical domain are analogs.  However, this is not enough to make the choice of mechanical fundamental variables unique.  The usual choice for a [[Translation (physics)|translational]] mechanical system is force (''F'') and velocity (''u'') but it is not the only choice.  A different pair may be more appropriate for a system with a different geometry, such as a rotational system.&lt;ref&gt;Busch-Vishniac, pp. 18-19&lt;/ref&gt;

Even after the mechanical fundamental variables have been chosen, there is still not a unique set of analogs.  There are two ways that the two pairs of power conjugate variables can be associated with each other in the analogy.  For instance the associations ''F'' with ''v'' and ''u'' with ''i'' can be made.  However, the alternative associations ''u'' with ''v'' and ''F'' with ''i'' are also possible.  This leads to two classes of analogies, the impedance analogies and the mobility analogies.&lt;ref&gt;Busch-Vishniac, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;  These analogies are the [[Duality (mathematics)|dual]] of each other.  The same mechanical network has analogs in two different electrical networks.  These two electrical networks are the [[dual impedance|dual circuits]] of each other.&lt;ref&gt;Eargle, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hamiltonian variables ===
The Hamiltonian variables, also called the energy variables, are those variables which when time [[derivative|differentiated]] are equal to the power conjugate variables.  The Hamiltonian variables are so called because they are the variables which usually appear in [[Hamiltonian mechanics]].  The Hamiltonian variables in the electrical domain are [[Electric charge|charge]] (''q'') and [[flux linkage]] (λ) because,

:&lt;math&gt;\frac {d \lambda}{dt} = v &lt;/math&gt; ([[Faraday's law of induction]]) and, &lt;math&gt;\frac {dq}{dt} = i&lt;/math&gt;

In the translational mechanical domain the Hamiltonian variables are distance [[Displacement (vector)|displacement]] (''x'') and [[momentum]] (''p'') because,

:&lt;math&gt;\frac {dp}{dt} = F &lt;/math&gt; ([[Newton's second law|Newton's second law of motion]]) and, &lt;math&gt;\frac {dx}{dt} = u&lt;/math&gt;
There is a corresponding relationship for other analogies and sets of variables.&lt;ref&gt;Busch-Vishniac, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;  The Hamiltonian variables are also called the energy variables.  The [[integrand]] of a power conjugate variable with respect to a Hamiltonian variable is a measure of energy.  For instance,

:&lt;math&gt; \int F dx &lt;/math&gt; and, &lt;math&gt; \int u dp &lt;/math&gt;

are both expressions of energy.  They can also be called ''generalised momentum'' and ''generalised displacement'' after their analogs in the mechanical domain.  Some authors discourage this terminology because it is not domain neutral.  Likewise, the use of the terms ''I-type'' and ''V-type'' (after current and voltage) is also discouraged.&lt;ref&gt;Borutzky, pp. 27-28&lt;/ref&gt;

== Classes of analogy ==
There are two principle classes of analogy in use.  The impedance analogy (also called the Maxwell analogy) preserves the analogy between mechanical, acoustical and electrical impedance but does not preserve the topology of networks.  The mechanical network is arranged differently to its analogous electrical network.  The mobility analogy (also called the Firestone analogy) preserves network topologies at the expense of losing the analogy between impedances across energy domains.  There is also the ''through and across'' analogy, also called the Trent analogy.  The through and across analogy between the electrical and mechanical domain is the same as in the mobility analogy.  However, the analogy between the electrical and acoustical domains is like the impedance analogy.  Analogies between the mechanical and acoustical domain in the through and across analogy have a dual relationship with both the impedance analogy and mobility analogy.&lt;ref&gt;Busch-Vishniac, pp. 18-20&lt;/ref&gt;

Different fundamental variables are chosen for mechanical translation and rotational systems leading to two variants for each of the analogies.  For instance, linear distance is the displacement variable in a translational system, but this is not so appropriate for rotating systems where [[angle]] is used instead.  Acoustical analogies have also been included in the descriptions as a third variant.  While acoustical energy is ultimately mechanical in nature, it is treated in the literature as an instance of a different energy domain, the fluid domain, and has different fundamental variables.  Analogies between all three domains − electrical, mechanical and acoustical − are required to fully represent electromechanical audio systems.&lt;ref&gt;Kleiner, pp. 67-68&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Impedance analogies ===
Impedance analogies, also called the Maxwell analogy, classify the two variables making up the power conjugate pair as an ''effort'' variable and a ''flow'' variable.  The effort variable in an energy domain is the variable analogous to force in the mechanical domain.  The flow variable in an energy domain is the variable analogous to velocity in the mechanical domain.  Power conjugate variables in the analog domain are chosen that bear some resemblance to force and velocity.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Busch-Vishniac, p. 18|Borutzsky, pp. 22-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the electrical domain, the effort variable is voltage and the flow variable is electrical current.  The ratio of voltage to current is [[electrical resistance]] ([[Ohm's law]]).  The ratio of the effort variable to the flow variable in other domains is also described as resistance.  Oscillating voltages and currents give rise to the concept of [[electrical impedance]] when there is a phase difference between them.  Impedance can be thought of as an extension to the concept of resistance.  Resistance is associated with energy dissipation.  Impedance encompasses energy storage as well as energy dissipation.  The impedance analogy gives rise to the concept of impedance in other energy domains (but measured in different units).&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Busch-Vishniac, p. 18|de Silva, p. 132}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The acoustical impedance analogy gives rise to the idea of [[acoustic impedance]].  The unit of acoustic impedance is the [[acoustic ohm]]; in SI units this is N-s/m&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Kleiner, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mobility analogies ===
Mobility analogies, also called the Firestone analogy, are the [[Duality (electrical circuits)|electrical duals]] of impedance analogies.  That is, the effort variable in the mechanical domain is analogous to current (the flow variable) in the electrical domain, and the flow variable in the mechanical domain is analogous to voltage (the effort variable) in the electrical domain.  The electrical network representing the mechanical system is the [[dual impedance|dual network]] of that in the impedance analogy.&lt;ref&gt;Eargle, pp.4-5&lt;/ref&gt;

The mobility analogy is characterised by [[admittance]] in the same way that the impedance analogy is characterised by impedance.  Admittance is the algebraic inverse of impedance.  In the mechanical domain, mechanical admittance is more usually called ''mobility''.&lt;ref&gt;Kleiner, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Through and across analogies ===
Through and across analogies, also called the '''Trent analogy''', classify the two variables making up the power conjugate pair as an ''across'' variable and a ''through'' variable.  The across variable is a variable that appears across the two terminals of an element.  The across variable is measured relative to the element terminals.  The through variable is a variable that passes through, or acts through an element, that is, it has the same value at both terminals of the element.  The through variable is not a relative measure.  Thus, in the electrical domain the across variable is voltage and the through variable is current.  In the mechanical domain the analogous variables are velocity and force, as in the mobility analogy.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Busch-Vishniac, pp. 19-20|Jackson, p. 17|Regtien, p. 20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pressure is an across variable because pressure is measured relative to the two terminals of an element, not as an absolute pressure.  It is thus not analogous to force which is a through variable, even though pressure is in units of force per area.  Forces act through an element; a rod with a force applied to the top will transmit the same force to an element connected to its bottom.  Thus, in the through and across analogy the mechanical domain is analogous to the electrical domain like the mobility analogy, but the acoustical domain is analogous to the electrical domain like the impedance analogy.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Busch-Vishniac, pp. 19-20|de Silva, pp. 132-133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Other energy domains ===
The electrical analogy can be extended to many other energy domains.  In the field of [[sensor]]s and [[actuator]]s, and for [[Control Systems Engineering|control systems]] using them, it is a common method of analysis to develop an electrical analogy of the entire system.  Since sensors can be sensing a variable in any energy domain, and likewise outputs from the system can be in any energy domain, analogies for all energy domains are required.  The following table gives a summary of the most common power conjugate variables used to form analogies.&lt;ref&gt;Busch-Vishniac, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

{| class="wikitable"

It is perhaps more common in the thermal domain to choose temperature and thermal power as the fundamental variables because, unlike entropy, they can be measured directly.  The concept of [[thermal resistance]] is based on this analogy.  However, these are not power conjugate variables and are not fully compatible with the other variables in the table.  An integrated electrical analogy across multiple domains that includes this thermal analogy will not correctly model energy flows.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Busch-Vishniac, p. 19|Regtien, p. 21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, the commonly seen analogy using mmf and magnetic flux as the fundamental variables, which gives rise to the concept of [[magnetic reluctance]], does not correctly model energy flow.  The variable pair mmf and magnetic flux is not a power conjugate pair.  This reluctance model is sometimes called the reluctance-resistance model since it makes these two quantities analogous.  The analogy shown in the table, which does use a power conjugate pair, is sometimes called the [[gyrator-capacitor model]].&lt;ref&gt;Hamill, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transducers ==
A [[transducer]] is a device that takes energy from one domain as input and converts it to another energy domain as output.  They are often reversible, but are rarely used in that way.  Transducers have many uses and there are many kinds, in electromechanical systems they can be used as actuators and sensors.  In audio electronics they provide the conversion between the electrical and acoustical domains.  The transducer provides the link between the mechanical and electrical domains and thus a network representation is required for it in order to develop a unified electrical analogy.&lt;ref&gt;Busch-Vishniac, pp. 11-12&lt;/ref&gt;  To do this the concept of [[Port (circuit theory)|port]] from the electrical domain is extended into other domains.&lt;ref&gt;Janschek, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt;

Transducers have (at least&lt;ref group=note&gt;[[Piezoelectric transducer]]s are frequently modelled as three-port devices, one electrical and two mechanical, because mechanical vibrations are induced on both sides of the crystal (Cheeke, pp. 213-214).&lt;/ref&gt;) two ports, one port in the mechanical domain and one in the electrical domain, and are analogous to electrical [[two-port network]]s.  This is to be compared to the elements discussed so far which are all one-ports.  Two-port networks can be represented as a 2×2 matrix, or equivalently, as a network of two [[dependent generator]]s and two impedances or admittances.  There are six canonical forms of these representations:  [[impedance parameters]], [[chain parameters]], [[hybrid parameters]] and their [[Matrix inverse|inverses]]. Any of them can be used.  However, the representation of a passive transducer converting between analogous variables (for instance an effort variable to another effort variable in the impedance analogy) can be simplified by replacing the dependent generators with a [[transformer]].&lt;ref&gt;Lenk ''et al.'', pp. 207-208&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, a transducer converting non-analogous power conjugate variables cannot be represented by a transformer.  The two-port element in the electrical domain that does this is called a [[gyrator]].  This device converts voltages to currents and currents to voltages.  By analogy, a transducer that converts non-analogous variables between energy domains is also called a gyrator.  For instance, electromagnetic transducers convert current to force and velocity to voltage.&lt;ref&gt;Eargle, pp. 5-6&lt;/ref&gt;  In the impedance analogy such a transducer is a gyrator.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Beranek &amp; Mellow, pp. 70-71|Lenk ''et al.'', p. 147|Janschek. pp. 94-95}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Whether a transducer is a gyrator or a transformer is analogy related; the same electromagnetic transducer in the mobility analogy is a transformer because it is converting between analogous variables.&lt;ref&gt;Janschek, 95-96&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[James Clerk Maxwell]] developed very detailed mechanical analogies of electrical phenomena.  He was the first to associate force with voltage (1873) and consequently is usually credited with founding the impedance analogy.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Bishop, p. 8.4|Busch-Vishniac, p. 20}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This was the earliest mechanical–electrical analogy.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, p. 1648&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the term ''impedance'' was not coined until 1886, long after Maxwell's death, by [[Oliver Heaviside]].&lt;ref&gt;Martinsen &amp; Grimnes, p. 287&lt;/ref&gt;  The idea of [[complex impedance]] was introduced by [[Arthur E. Kennelly]] in 1893, and the concept of impedance was not extended into the mechanical domain until 1920 by Kennelly and [[Arthur Gordon Webster]].&lt;ref&gt;Hunt p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;

Maxwell's purpose in constructing this analogy was not to represent mechanical systems in terms of electrical networks.  Rather, it was to explain electrical phenomena in more familiar mechanical terms.  As electrical phenomena became better understood the reverse of this analogy, using electrical analogies to explain mechanical systems, started to become more common.  Indeed, the lumped element abstract topology of electrical analysis has much to offer problems in the mechanical domain, and other energy domains for that matter.  By 1900 the electrical analogy of the mechanical domain was becoming commonplace.  From about 1920 the electrical analogy became a standard analysis tool.  [[Vannevar Bush]] was a pioneer of this kind of modelling in his development of [[analogue computer]]s, and a coherent presentation of this method was presented in a 1925 paper by [[Clifford A. Nickle]].&lt;ref&gt;Care, p. 76&lt;/ref&gt;

The application of [[Network analysis (electrical circuits)|electrical network analysis]], most especially the newly developed field of [[filter theory]], to mechanical and acoustic systems led to huge improvements in performance.  According to [[Warren P. Mason]] the efficiency of ship electric foghorns grew from less than one per cent to 50 per cent.  The [[Bandwidth (signal processing)|bandwidth]] of mechanical [[phonograph]]s grew from three to five [[octave]]s when the mechanical parts of the sound transmission were designed as if they were the elements of an electric filter ('' see also {{section link|Mechanical filter|Sound reproduction}}'').  Remarkably, the [[conversion efficiency]] was improved at the same time (the usual situation with [[amplifier|amplifying]] systems is that [[gain (electronics)|gain]] can be traded for bandwidth such that the [[gain-bandwidth product]] remains constant).&lt;ref&gt;Mason, p. 405&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1933 [[Floyd A. Firestone]] proposed a new analogy, the mobility analogy, in which force is analogous to current instead of voltage.  Firestone introduced the concept of across and through variables in this paper and presented a structure for extending the analogy into other energy domains.&lt;ref&gt;{{Multiref|Bishop, p. 8.2|Smith, p. 1648}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A variation of the force-current analogy was proposed by [[Horace M. Trent]] in 1955 and it is this version that is generally meant by the through and across analogy.&lt;ref&gt;Busch-Vishniac, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;  Trent used a linear graph method of representing networks which has resulted in the force-current analogy historically being associated with linear graphs.  The force-voltage analogy is historically used with bond graph representations, introduced in 1960 by [[Henry M. Paynter]], however, it is possible to use either analogy with either representation if desired.&lt;ref&gt;Bishop, p. 8.8&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22974">The following systems arose from [[Ancient weights and measures|earlier systems]], and in many cases utilise parts of much older systems. For the most part they were used to varying degrees in the [[Middle Ages]] and surrounding time periods.  Some of these systems found their way into later systems, such as the [[Imperial unit|Imperial system]] and even [[SI]]. There were several types to measure that is given below.

== English system ==
Before Roman units were reintroduced in 1066 by Norman [[William the Conqueror]], there was an [[Anglo-Saxon]] (Germanic) system of measure based on the units of the ''barleycorn'' and the ''gyrd'' (rod).{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}} The systems partly merged.

Later development of the [[English unit|English system]] continued by issuing measurement standards from the then capital [[Winchester, Hampshire|Winchester]] in about 1215. Standards were renewed in 1496, 1588 and 1758.

The last ''Imperial Standard Yard'' in bronze was made in 1845; it served as the standard in the [[United Kingdom]] until the yard was internationally redefined as 0.9144 metre in 1959 (statutory implementation: Weights and Measures Act of 1963).

Much of the units would go on to be used in later [[Imperial units]] and in the [[U.S. customary units|US system]], which are based on the [[English unit|English system]] from the 1700s.

== Danish system ==
From May 1, 1683, King [[Christian V of Denmark]] introduced an office to oversee weights and measures, a ''justervæsen'', to be led by [[Ole Rømer]]. The definition of the ''alen'' was set to 2 Rhine feet. Rømer later discovered that differing standards for the Rhine foot existed, and in 1698 an [[iron]] [[Copenhagen]] standard was made. A pendulum definition for the foot was first suggested by Rømer, introduced in 1820, and changed in 1835. The metric system was introduced in 1907.

=== Length ===
* ''mil'' &amp;ndash; Danish mile. Towards the end of the 17th century, Ole Rømer connected the mile to the circumference of the earth, and defined it as 12000 ''alen''. This definition was adopted in 1816 as the Prussian ''Meile''. The coordinated definition from  1835 was 7.532&amp;nbsp;km. Earlier, there were many variants, the most commonplace the ''[[Sjælland]]sk miil'' of 17600 ''fod'' or 11.130&amp;nbsp;km.
* ''palme'' &amp;ndash; Palm, for circumference, 8.86&amp;nbsp;cm
* ''alen'' &amp;ndash; Forearm, 2 ''fod''
* ''fod'' &amp;ndash; Defined as a ''Rheinfuss'' 31.407&amp;nbsp;cm from 1683, before that 31.41&amp;nbsp;cm with variations.
* ''kvarter'' &amp;ndash; Quarter, 1 / 4 ''alen''
* ''tomme'' &amp;ndash; Inch, 1 / 12 ''fod''
* ''linie'' &amp;ndash; Line, 1 / 12 ''tomme''
* ''skrupel'' &amp;ndash; Scruple, 1 / 12 ''linie''

=== Volume ===
* ''potte'' &amp;ndash; Pot, from 1683 1 / 32 ''fot''³
* ''smørtønde'' &amp;ndash; Barrel of butter, from 1683 136 ''potter''
* ''korntønde'' &amp;ndash; Barrel of corn, from 1683 144 ''potter''

=== Weight ===
* ''pund'' &amp;ndash; Pound, from 1683 the weight of 1 / 62 ''fot''³ of water, 499.75&amp;nbsp;g

=== Miscellaneous ===
* ''dusin'' &amp;ndash; 12
* ''snes'' &amp;ndash; 20
* ''gross'' &amp;ndash; 144

== Dutch system ==
The Dutch system was not standardised until Napoleon introduced the metric system.  Different towns used measures with the same names but differing sizes.

Some common measures:

=== Weight ===
*''Ons, Once'' &amp;ndash; 1/16 pond = 30.881&amp;nbsp;g
*''Pond'' (Amsterdam) &amp;ndash; 494.09&amp;nbsp;g (other ponds were also in use)
*''Scheepslast'' &amp;ndash; 4000 Amsterdam ''pond'' = 1976.4&amp;nbsp;kg = 2.1786 short tons

=== Length ===
*''duim'' &amp;ndash;2.54&amp;nbsp;cm
*''kleine palm'' &amp;ndash;3&amp;nbsp;cm
*''grote palm'' &amp;ndash;9.6&amp;nbsp;cm, after 1820, 10&amp;nbsp;cm

== French system ==
In [[France]], again, there were many local variants. For instance, the ''lieue'' could vary from 3.268&amp;nbsp;km in [[Beauce, France|Beauce]] to 5.849&amp;nbsp;km in [[Provence]]. Between 1812 and 1839, many of the traditional units continued in ''metrified'' adaptations as the ''mesures usuelles''.

In Paris, the redefinition in terms of metric units made 1&amp;nbsp;m = 443.296 ''ligne'' = 3&amp;nbsp;''pied'' 11.296 ''ligne''.

In Quebec, the surveys in French units were converted using the relationship 1 ''pied'' (of the French variety; the same word is used for English feet as well) = 12.789 inches (of English origin).  Thus a square arpent was 5299296.0804&amp;nbsp;in² or about 36,801&amp;nbsp;ft² or 0.8448 acre.

There were many local variations; the metric conversions below apply to the Quebec and Paris definitions.

== Norwegian system ==
Before 1541, there were no common definition for length measures in [[Norway]], and local variants flourished. In 1541, an ''alen'' in [[Denmark]] and [[Norway]] was defined by law to be the [[Sjælland]] ''alen''. Subsequently, the ''alen'' was defined by law as 2 Rhine feet from 1683. From 1824, the basic unit was defined as a ''fot'' being derived from [[astronomy]] as the length of a one-second pendulum times 12/38 at a [[latitude]] of 45°. The [[metric system]] was introduced in 1887.

In 1855, a decimal reform was instituted that defined a new Swedish inch as 1/10 foot. It did not last long, because the metric system was subsequently introduced in 1889. Up to the middle of the 19th century there was a death penalty for falsifying weights or measures.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23467">'''Mnemic neglect''' is a term used in [[social psychology]] to describe a pattern of selective forgetting in which certain autobiographical memories tend to be recalled more easily if they are consistent with positive [[self-concept]].  The mnemic neglect model stipulates that memory is self-protective if the information is negative, self-referent, and concerns central traits. 
&lt;ref name="Pinter, B. 2011"&gt;Pinter, B., Green, J.D., Sedikides, C., &amp; Gregg, A.P. (2011) Self-protective memory: Separation/integration as a mechanism for mnemic neglect. Social Cognition, 29 (5), 612-624.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mnemic neglect model==
Experiments have been conducted to test for the specific conditions under which mnemic neglect occurs. A standard procedure has been used across several experiments to test for these conditions. In this procedure, participants are presented with a list of 32 behavioral traits. They are asked to either encode each trait as if it applied to them (i.e. "consider people describing you with these traits") or as if it applied to a stranger named Chris (i.e. "consider people describing Chris with these traits").&lt;ref name="Saunders 2"/&gt; Several of these experiments have found that the first condition under which mnemic neglect occurs is that the traits must be negative. Feedback from others is less easily recalled when it is negative in nature than when it is positive. Second, the information must be self-referent. Sedikides and Green (2004) conducted a study using the standard procedure in which half of the participants were asked to consider feedback as if it applied to them and half were asked to consider the same feedback as if it applied to someone else. They found that negative feedback was recalled as frequently as positive feedback when the feedback was directed at another. However, when the feedback was directed at oneself, negative feedback was recalled less frequently than positive feedback.&lt;ref name="Green"/&gt; Third, the information must pertain to a central, rather than peripheral, self-conception. A central self-conception is a generally positive trait that is considered fixed and highly descriptive (i.e. trustworthy vs. untrustworthy). In contrast, a peripheral self-conception is considered only moderately descriptive, less positive, and less important (i.e. modest vs. immodest). Feedback that counteracts a central self-conception is recalled much less frequently than feedback that counteracts a peripheral self-conception. In fact, the recall for feedback on modifiable traits was unaffected by whether the feedback was positive or negative.&lt;ref&gt;Green, J.D., Pinter, B., &amp; Sedikides, C. (2005). Mnemic neglect and self-threat: Trait modifiability moderates self-protection. European Journal of Social Psychology, 35 (2), 225-235.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hypothesized mechanism==
Sedikides and Green (2004) offered a mechanism by which they believe mnemic neglect occurs. Self-referent information is processed in two stages. The first stage checks the information for compatibility with self-concept. Self-threatening information is confined to this stage because it is found to be incompatible with self-concept. During the second stage, self-flattering information is compared to similar [[episodic memories]]. The theory is that deeper processing occurs at the second stage, so information processed at this stage is recalled more easily.&lt;ref&gt;Sedikides, C., &amp; Green, J.D. (2004). What I don’t recall can’t hurt me: Information negativity versus information inconsistency as determinants of memorial self-defense. Social Cognition, 22 (1), 4-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although research has demonstrated a difference in recall between threatening and non-threatening information, there is no difference in recognition of threatening and non-threatening information.&lt;ref&gt;Wyer, R. S., Jr., Bodenhausen, G. V., &amp; Srull, T.K. (1984). The cognitive representation of persons and groups and its effect on recall and recognition memory. Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 20, 445-469.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, self-threatening information is recalled less easily than non-threatening information but it is recognized equally well, meaning that subjects can identify whether they received the information or not regardless of its connotations. However, in a free recall task, subjects show a memory bias for non-threatening information. To account for this difference, Pinter, Green, Sedikides, and Gregg (2011) modified the suggested mechanism behind mnemic neglect. They hypothesized that people compare incoming information to past experience. If the information is consistent with self-knowledge, then the information is integrated with this knowledge. If the information is inconsistent with self-knowledge, then it is processed separately. Therefore, self-threatening information is less easily recalled but just as easily recognized as non-threatening information because separate processing leads to fewer retrieval routes.

This mechanism was tested by Pinter and his colleagues experimentally. Half of the participants were prompted to incorporate the information they were given into their self-concept. They were instructed to find similarities between the information and their self-knowledge and determine reasons for why the information described them. This process was termed integration. The other half of the participants were prompted to separate the information from their self-concept. They were asked to identify differences between the information and their self-knowledge and determine reasons for why the information did not describe them.  This process was termed separation. The first finding of the experiment was that recall for both positive and negative information was poorer for separation than for integration. However, recognition was the same between the two groups. The second finding was that self-protection is more important that self-enhancement. A greater effect was seen for attempting to integrate central negative information than for attempting to separate central positive information.&lt;ref name="Pinter, B. 2011"/&gt;

This mechanism has been challenged by those who believe that mnemic neglect is a product of expectancies rather than self-protection motives.&lt;ref&gt;Swann, W. B. Jr. (1983). Self-verification: Bringing social reality into harmony with the self. In Psychological perspectives on the self, 2, 33–66.&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, negative information is not processed as deeply as positive information because it is incompatible with self-concept as opposed to simply unflattering. People do not recall a behavior describing them that indicates untrustworthiness not because they want to protect themselves but because this behavior is inconsistent with how they would actually behave. This alternative explanation accounts for the absence of memory bias in recalling information about a stranger (Chris). People have no expectancies about this stranger Chris, so positive and negative information are processed equally well.&lt;ref name="Newman"&gt;Newman, L.S., Nibert, J.A., &amp; Winer, E.S. (2009). Mnemic neglect is not an artifact of expectancy: The moderating role of defensive pessimism. European Journal of Social Psychology, 39 (3), 477-486&lt;/ref&gt;

Newman, Nibert, and Winer (2009) emphasized ruling out the possibility that mnemic neglect occurs due to incompatibility with expectancies. It was suspected that mnemic neglect might be an issue of self-verification rather than self-protection or self-enhancement. Self-verification and self-protection are difficult concepts to separate because most people tend to think of themselves favorably.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, S. E., &amp; Brown, J. D. (1988). Illusion and well-being: A social psychological perspective on mental health. Psychological Bulletin, 103, 193–210.&lt;/ref&gt; Green and Sedikides (2004) attempted to address this concern by conducting two experiments. In one experiment, the participants were pre-selected. Half viewed themselves positively on certain dimensions and half viewed themselves negatively. All participants had better recall for positive dimensions. In another experiment, a stranger Chris was described to participants before they read the behaviors. Chris was described as a superhuman, incredibly kind and trustworthy, in an attempt to establish expectancies about Chris. Other participants in the same study were asked to imagine the traits described a close friend whom the participants hold in high regard. In comparison to these two cases, recall for positive traits was still better when these traits were self-referent rather than directed at another.&lt;ref name="Green"&gt;Green, J. D., &amp; Sedikides, C. (2004). Retrieval selectivity in the processing of self-referent information: Testing the boundaries of selfprotection. Self and Identity, 3, 69–80.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite these findings, the mechanism was still challenged because the results were open to interpretation. Perhaps participants had more favorable expectancies for themselves than for others. Newman, Nibert, and Winer (2009) sought to test the expectancies possibility more directly. They hypothesized that participants who were more focused on testing information against their expectancies would have different recall biases than participants who were more likely to be focused on self-protection. Defensive pessimists were identified as people who are more likely to focus on expectancies. Defensive pessimists think extensively about possible future outcomes, both positive and negative. Their ultimate goal is to be prepared. They should still exhibit a preference for positive over negative information, but they are more likely to approach a situation with “Is this a reasonable thing to expect?” as opposed to “Will this make me feel bad about myself?” Thus, it was hypothesized that defensive pessimists would recall more favorable than unfavorable behaviors in both themselves and others when subjected to the standard test for mnemic neglect. The findings supported the hypothesis. Defensive pessimists showed a bias for the recall of positive information over negative information for both themselves and others, thereby offering further support to the hypothesized mechanism of mnemic neglect (i.e. mnemic neglect is based on self-protection rather than self-verification).&lt;ref name="Newman"/&gt;

==Evidence against hypothesized mechanism==
The recollection of [[autobiographical memory|autobiographical memories]] can trigger emotions. Research shows that the intensity of the emotion experienced at the time of the event decreases over time, such that the intensity of the emotion associated with the recollection of the event is less than the intensity of the emotion experienced during the event.&lt;ref&gt;Hartnett, J. L., &amp; Skowronski, J. J. (2008). Tragic to hilarious: Why do some negative autobiographical memories become funny? Presented at the 80th Annual Meeting of the MidwesternPsychological Association, Chicago, IL, May 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[fading affect bias]] is a phenomenon in which emotions associated with a negative event fade faster than emotions associated with a positive event.

Like mnemic neglect, the fading affect bias is hypothesized to promote positive self-concept. Despite the similarities between mnemic neglect and fading affect bias, the hypothesized mechanisms of fading affect bias differ from that of mnemic neglect. One hypothesized mechanism of fading affect bias is that negative experiences are gradually reinterpreted as transformative events.&lt;ref&gt;Levine, L. J., &amp; Bluck, S. (2004). How emotions fade: Valence, appraisals, and the emotional impact of remembered events. Advances in psychology research, 30, 3–20.&lt;/ref&gt; In the process, these memories lose emotional intensity. For example, people often reinterpret hardships as opportunities to experience personal growth. A second hypothesized mechanism suggests that the conveying of autobiographical events to others minimizes negative aspects of the story and emphasizes positive aspects. In fact, a study by Skowronski, Gibbons, Vogl, and Walker (2004) demonstrated that fading affect bias is stronger for events frequently disclosed to others. Both of these mechanisms suggest that the superior retention of positive emotions over negative emotions is not a function of initial coding. Rather, poorer retention of negative emotions may be a function of recoding over time.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, W.R., &amp; Skowronski, J.L. (2009). The fading affect bias: But what the hell is it for? Applied Cognitive Psychology, 23 (8), 1122-1136.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Limits of the mnemic neglect model: selective nature of self-protection==
One limitation of the mnemic neglect model is its inability to explain why people respond to negative information differently. Why is it that sometimes people react to negative feedback with defensive anger and other times with thoughtful reflection? Green, Sedikides, Pinter, and Van Tongeren (2009) conducted two experiments to determine the boundaries of mnemic neglect. They hypothesized that the self-protection aspect of mnemic neglect is flexible and that the mnemic neglect model is only upheld under certain conditions. More specifically, these researchers hypothesized that mnemic neglect does not occur when there is an opportunity for self-improvement and when feedback concerning an individual’s personality is provided in the context of a close relationship.

In their first experiment, these researchers tested the effect motivation to improve the self has on mnemic neglect. They hypothesized that mnemic neglect would not be observed in individuals motivated to enhance themselves because this motivation leads to deeper processing which in turn creates more retrieval routes. In this experiment, half of the participants were exposed to a task aimed to prime them for self-motivation. The other half was not exposed to this task. After the priming task, all of the participants were exposed to the standard test for mnemic neglect in which they were asked to read through a list of personality traits. Some were asked to imagine that the traits applied to them while others were asked to imagine that the traits applied to another named Chris. In the condition where self-improvement was primed, self-threatening and self-affirming information were recalled equally. Researchers believe that the findings of this experiment indicate the existence of a balance between the desire to protect oneself and the desire to improve oneself.

In their second experiment, participants signed up as pairs. Half of the participants were assigned to work with their partner while the other half were assigned to work with strangers. One of the partners completed a personality test. The other partner received the first partner’s answers to the personality test and rated each of the responses as either positive or negative. The first participant then had an opportunity to review each of their partner’s positive/negative ratings. After a brief distractor test, the first participant was asked to recall as many of their partner’s feedback ratings as possible. Researchers found that when the two partners had a close relationship, mnemic neglect was not demonstrated. When the two partners were strangers, mnemic neglect was maintained.

Green, Sedikides, Pinter, and Van Tongeren admit that further research must be conducted to determine the mechanism behind the effect relationships have on mnemic neglect. Feedback from close friends may be more useful because individuals feel more comfortable to use the feedback constructively if it is provided within a supportive relationship. An alternative explanation is that recalling feedback from a friend may be important for maintaining a healthy relationship. However, a third explanation is that individuals commit this feedback to memory so that they may better prepare counterarguments for the future.

This research opens the door for future research to investigate individual differences in order to create a list of [[moderator variable]]s that affect mnemic neglect.&lt;ref&gt;Green, J.D., Sedikides, C., Pinter, B., &amp; Van Tongeren, D.R. (2009). Two sides to self-protection: Self-improvement strivings and feedback from close relationships eliminate mnemic neglect. Self and Identity, 8 (2-3), 233-250.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mnemic neglect and dysphoria==
[[Mood (psychology)|Mood]] can affect cognitive performance.&lt;ref name="Saunders 2"/&gt; Research has demonstrated that individuals with [[dysphoria]] recall negative information more easily than positive information&lt;ref&gt;Burt, D. B., Zembar, M. J., &amp; Niederehe, G. (1995). Depression and memory impairment. A meta analysis of the association, its pattern, and specificity. Psychological Bulletin, 117, 285-305.&lt;/ref&gt; Saunders (2011) conducted three experiments to determine the relationship between dysphoria and mnemic neglect. In the first experiment, it was hypothesized that dysphoric patients are prone to malfunctioning mnemic neglect. They suffer from the inability to forget negative information. Thus, they should have better recall for self-threatening information than nondysphoric individuals. Participants were subjects to the standard mnemic neglect test procedure. It was determined that people with dysphoria have greater recall for central negative information. It was further hypothesized that a defect in mnemic neglect leads to more negative memories.

Experiment 1 also indicated that dysphoria patients had better recall for central negative information than peripheral negative information. Thus, it was hypothesized a reverse mnemic neglect model in dysphoria patients. For the second experiment, the same traits were presented to two separate groups of dysphoria patients. The first group received information before receiving the list of traits that described the traits as all unmodifiable, meaning that if one exhibits the trait as a child, he or she will certainly exhibit the trait as an adult. The second group received information that described the traits as all modifiable, meaning that if one exhibits the trait as a child, he or she can change as an adult. It was concluded that dysphoria patients recall unmodifiable traits better than they do modifiable traits.

In Experiment 3, it was hypothesized that individuals with dysphoria would demonstrate better recall for highly diagnostic behaviors than low diagnostic behaviors. A highly diagnostic behavior is one that is very descriptive of a trait. For instance, “I can keep secrets” is highly diagnostic of the trait trustworthiness. A low diagnostic behavior for trustworthiness might be “I would take a pen from a bank after using it”. This experiment followed the same procedure as Experiment 1 except that half of the dysphoria patients were presented highly diagnostic behaviors and half were presented low diagnostic behaviors. As expected, the participants negative information was more easily recalled when the information was highly diagnostic as opposed to low diagnostic.

Saunders explains her findings by suggesting that self-referent, negative, central information receives elaboration form dysphoric patients. They process this information more deeply than nondysphoric patients. In addition, individuals with dysphoria may have inhibitory deficits, where they are unable to keep negative information from flooding their conscious minds. These difficulties in suppressing negative memories could explain why the negative mood is sustained.

Dysphoric patients rated central negative traits just as negative as nondysphoric patients did, but they rated these traits as more important. It has been argued that the differences in mnemic neglect between individuals with and without dysphoria can be explained by mood-dependent memory (link). Simply, individuals with dysphoria believe that negative information is more self-referent than positive information. However, Saunders argues that there are effects beyond mood-dependent memory because the same effect would be seen for peripheral negative information, which in fact saw no difference in recall between the two groups. She also emphasizes that she would not have observed differences for modifiability and diagnosticity either if this were the case.&lt;ref&gt;Saunders, J. (2011). Reversed mnemic neglect of self-threatening memories in dysphoria. Cognition &amp; Emotion, 25 (5), 854-867.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mnemic neglect and anxiety==
There is evidence that individuals with [[anxiety]] also experience reverse mnemic neglect. Many studies have found no difference in memory bias between anxious and non-anxious individuals,&lt;ref&gt;Dalgliesh, T. (1994). The relationship between anxiety and memory biases for material that has been selectively processed in a prior task. Behaviour Research and Therapy, 32, 227-231&lt;/ref&gt; but these studies have been criticized for using traits low in self-reference.&lt;ref name="Saunders 2"&gt;Saunders, J. (2013). Selective memory bias for self-threatening memories in trait anxiety. Cognition &amp; Emotion, 27(1), 21-36&lt;/ref&gt; A meta-analysis conducted by Mitte (2008) found that anxious individuals have better recall than non-anxious individuals for negative information and that non-anxious individuals have better recall than anxious individuals for neutral and positive information.&lt;ref&gt;Mitte, K. (2008). Memory bias for self-threatening information in anxiety and anxiety disorders: A meta-analytic review. Psychological Bulletin, 134, 886-911&lt;/ref&gt;

Saunders (2013) hypothesized that highly anxious individuals have better recall for central, negative traits than non-anxious individuals. A series of three experiments was conducted. Experiment 1 used the standard mnemic neglect procedure to compare the recall for various traits between high-anxious participants and low-anxious participants. As hypothesized, high-anxious participants showed greater recall than did low-anxious participants for central, negative traits.

Experiment 2 tested for the recall of highly diagnostic traits. It was hypothesized that high-anxious participants would show mnemic neglect for modifiable traits because these traits are not perceived as very threatening. However, unmodifiable traits would be immune to mnemic neglect for these participants and thus they would be recalled more easily. In this experiment, traits were either presented following a description of the traits as being changeable over time or following a description of the traits as being unalterable throughout life. As hypothesized, anxious participants were able to recall more unmodifiable than modifiable central negative traits.

It was hypothesized that anxious participants have better recall for highly diagnostic central negative traits. Diagnosticity refers to how well a behavior indicates an underlying trait. In experiment 3, both anxious and non-anxious participants were asked to rate how diagnostic each behavior was of a trait (i.e. Based on this behavior, how likely is it that this person is trustworthy?). No difference in diagnostic ratings was found between the two groups. However, anxious participants had higher recall than non-anxious participants for highly diagnostic central negative traits when they directed at themselves.

Thus, reverse mnemic neglect is experienced for unmodifiable and highly diagnostic traits among high-anxious individuals.&lt;ref name ="Saunders 2"/&gt;

{{Nukapu Conflict}}
The '''Nukapu Expedition''' occurred between October 1871 and February 1872 and was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[punitive expedition|punitive operation]] in response to the murder of [[Bishop]] [[John Coleridge Patteson]] by the natives of [[Nukapu]]. A [[Royal Navy]] warship was sent to the island and it sank a group of hostile [[canoe|war-canoes]] and landed men to attack a fortified village.

==Expedition==
In October 1871, the screw [[sloop-of-war]] [[HMS Rosario (1860)|HMS ''Rosario'']] was operating against [[South Sea Islands|South Seas]] [[blackbirder]]s when her captain, [[Commander|Acting-Commander]] [[Albert Hastings Markham]] received orders to sail for Nukapu in the [[Solomon Islands]]. A contemporary newspaper described the events thus:
{{cquote|''The Rosario{{'}}s boat had got to within 50 yards of the mainland when the natives commenced their war dance and made other hostile indications. They then sent a shower of arrows at the Rosario{{'}}s boat, which however, all fell short. The boat then returned to the ship to report the attack, and to ask permission to return it. The boat was ordered to return, and the ship was cleared for action, and opened fire with shell from the [[RBL 40 pounder Armstrong gun|40-pounder Armstrong]], and the [[RML 7 inch gun|7in. six and a half ton gun]]; while the crew of the boat opened fire with their rifles. The Rosario made a circuit of the island, and when abreast of the native village fired on it with shell at 2,300 yards. At 4 p.m., it being high water, the boats were able to cross the reef, and four of them advanced on the village with small arms, and engaged the natives, who kept up a continual discharge of arrows; the ship sent in shell at a range of a mile. After firing several hundred rounds, the men landed from the boats and drove the natives in from the beach. Here one of the arrows struck Corporal Marcus in the arm, and the wound afterwards proved fatal. The native canoes were destroyed, and the seamen pulled on to the village, where one of them received two bad wounds, but ultimately recovered from their effects. The village proved to be very strongly fortified with stonework, which was thrown up in front of each hut. In a few minutes the native habitations were set in flames. It was estimated that from 20 to 30 natives were killed in the engagement.|20px|20px|The ''Rosario'' and the Murderers of Bishop Patteson, reported in ''The Argus''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The ''Rosario'' and the Murderers of Bishop Patteson|newspaper=[[The Argus (Australia)|The Argus]]| location = [[Melbourne]] |date= 15 February 1872|url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article5859743}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Montgomery, pg. 32-323&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Markham published an account of the cruise under the title ''The cruise of the ''Rosario'' amongst the New Hebrides and Santa Cruz Islands, exposing the recent atrocities connected with the kidnapping of natives in the South Seas.''&lt;ref name=CR&gt;{{cite book |title=The cruise of the ''Rosario'' amongst the New Hebrides and Santa Cruz Islands |last=Markham |first=Albert Hastings |authorlink=Albert Hastings Markham  |year=1873 |publisher=Sampson Low, Marston, Low, and Searle |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The measures taken by ''Rosario'' became the subject of questions in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1872/mar/11/question-5#S3V0209P0_18720311_HOC_34|title=Hansard, 11 March 1872|accessdate=2009-11-19|quote=Mr W Johnston asked the Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, If there is any foundation for the statement that Her Majesty's ship ''Rosario'' has shelled and destroyed the village in the Island of Nukapu, in which resided the natives who murdered Bishop Patteson; and, if so, by whose orders this was done?}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Markham's book&lt;ref name=CR/&gt; on the subject may well have been prompted by them. The book itself makes clear that Markham clearly understood the cycle of violence and deplored both the murderous activities of the Blackbirders, and the apparent need for further violence in restoring order.&lt;ref name=CR/&gt;

[[File:Obsolete Russian units of length - ru.svg|thumb]]
A native system of weights and measures was used in [[Imperial Russia]] and after the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]], but it was abandoned after [[July 1925#July 21, 1925 (Tuesday)|July 21, 1925]], when the [[Soviet Union]] adopted the [[metric system]], per the order of the [[Council of People's Commissars]].

The [[Obsolete Tatar weights and measures|Tatar system]] is very similar to the Russian one, but some names are different.{{cn|date=February 2014}}

The system existed since [[ancient Rus']], but under [[Peter the Great]], the Russian units were redefined relative to the [[English unit|English system]].&lt;ref name=Shost&gt;Шостьин Н. А. Очерки истории русской метрологии XI — начала XX века. М.: 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; Until Peter the Great the system also used [[Cyrillic numerals]], and only in the 18th century did Peter the Great replace it with the [[Hindu-Arabic numeral system]].&lt;ref name=Shost/&gt;

==Length==
The basic unit is the Russian [[cubit]], called the ''arshin'', which has been in use since the 16th century.  It was standardized by [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]] in the 18th century to measure exactly twenty-eight English inches ({{convert|28|in|cm|2|abbr=on|disp=output only}}). Thus, 80 vershoks = 20 piads = 5 arshins = 140 English inches ({{convert|140|in|cm|2|abbr=on|disp=output only}}).&lt;ref name=Carda&gt;{{cite book|author=Cardarelli, F.|year=2004|title=Encyclopaedia of Scientific Units, Weights and Measures: Their SI Equivalences and Origins|publisher=Springer|edition=2nd|pages=120–124|isbn=1-85233-682-X|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6KCx8Ww75VkC&amp;pg=PA118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''piad'' ({{lang|ru|пядь}}, “palm”, “five”) or ''chetvert'' ({{lang|ru|че́тверть}}, “quarter”) is a [[span (unit)|hand span]], the distance between ends of the spread thumb and [[index finger]].

*** 3 proprietor's desiatinas = 4 official desiatinas

==Volume==
As in many ancient systems of measurement the Russian distinguishes between dry and liquid measurements of capacity. Note that the chetvert appears in both lists with vastly differing values.

== Weight/mass ==

Two systems of weight were in use, an ordinary one in common use, and an [[apothecaries' system]].

|}

The pood was first mentioned in a number of documents of the twelfth century. {{cn|date=February 2014}} It may still be encountered in documents dealing with agricultural production (especially with reference to cereals), and has been revived in determining weights when casting bells in belfries following the rebirth of the Orthodox Churches in the former Soviet lands.  It is also popular in the modern fitness industry of the 21st century, as the pood is used when referencing the weight of a [[kettlebell]], a Russian invention, especially in CrossFit. {{cn|date=February 2014}}

===Apothecaries' system===
The Imperial Russian apothecaries' weight was defined by setting the grain ({{lang-ru|гран}}) to be exactly seven-fifths of a ''dolia''.  The only unit name shared between the two was the ''funt'' (pound), but the one in the apothecaries' system is exactly seven-eighths of the ordinary ''funt''.

==Idiomatic expressions==
The obsolete units of measurement survived in [[Russian culture]] in a number of [[idiom]]atic expressions and [[proverb]]s, for example:

* Слышно за ''версту'': (It) can be heard a verst away - about something very loud
* Бешеной собаке семь ''вёрст'' не крюк.: 7 versts is not a detour for a mad dog - about excessive energy or hassle
* Милому дружку семь ''вёрст'' не околица: 7 verst is not too far for a darling friend
* ''Верста'' коломенская: [[Kolomna]] verst - about a very tall and slim person (in this case the reference is to the verst pole road mark: (''verstovoy stolb''))
* ''Косая сажень'' в плечах:  Skew sazhen in the shoulders - about a strong, wide-shouldered person
* Мерить всех на свой ''аршин''. To gauge everybody by the same [literally: one's own] yardstick
* Проглотить ''аршин''. To swallow an arshin (yardstick)  - about standing very straight and still 
* От горшка два ''вершка''. Two vershok above the pot. - Very young kid
* Сто ''пудов''. - Hundred poods - very large amount. In modern colloquial Russian it is used in a generic meanings of "very much" and "very", as well as "most surely";&lt;ref&gt;English-Russian-English dictionary of slang, jargon and Russian names. 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The adjective 'stopudovy' and the adverb 'stopudovo' derive from this expression, although it is more likely a mangled contraction of "100%" (stoprocentny).
* Семь ''пядей'' во лбу. Seven 'pyad' across the forehead - very smart
* Не семь ''пядей'' во лбу. Not seven 'pyad' across the forehead - not so smart
* Мал ''золотник'', да до́рог. A zolotnik is small, but expensive : when quality rather than quantity is important 
* Идти ''семимильными'' шагами. To walk in 7-mile steps  - Any kind of very fast progress, e.g., of improvement
* Узнать, почём ''фунт'' лиха. To learn how much a pound of ''[[likho]]'' costs - To experience something bad
* Ни ''пяди'' земли (не уступить). Do not give up (even) a ''pyad'' of land
* Съесть ''пуд'' соли (вместе с кем-либо). To eat a 'pood' of salt (with somebody) - To have a long common experience with somebody (with the implication "to know someone well")

The '''Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict''' (OSRSG-SVC), is an office of the [[United Nations Secretariat]] tasked with serving the [[United Nations]]' spokesperson and political advocate on conflict-related sexual violence, the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict (SRSG-SVC). The Special Representative holds the rank of [[Under-Secretary-General of the United Nations]] and chairs the UN Action Against Sexual Violence in Conflict.&lt;ref name="unsvc"&gt;[http://www.un.org/sexualviolenceinconflict/about-us/about-the-office/ About the Office]&lt;/ref&gt; The mandate of the SRSG-SVC was established by [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1888|Security Council Resolution 1888]], introduced by [[Hillary Clinton]], and the first Special Representative, [[Margot Wallström]], took office in 2010. The current Special Representative is [[Pramila Patten]] of Mauritius, who was appointed by United Nations Secretary General [[António Guterres]] in April 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/press/en/2017/sga1719.doc.htm|title=Secretary-General Appoints Pramila Patten of Mauritius Special Representative on Sexual Violence in Conflict {{!}} Meetings Coverage and Press Releases|website=www.un.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work of the SRSG-SVC is supported by the United Nations Team of Experts on the Rule of Law/Sexual Violence in Conflict, co-led by the [[United Nations Department of Peacekeeping Operations|Department of Peacekeeping Operations]] (DPKO), [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights]] (OHCHR) and the [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP), also established under Security Council Resolution 1888.

==History and Role==

The mandate was established in 2009 by [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1888]], one in a series of resolutions which recognized the detrimental impact that sexual violence in conflict has on communities, and acknowledged that the crime undermines peace and security efforts. The resolution signaled a change in the way the international community views and responds to conflict-related sexual violence. It is no longer seen as an inevitable by-product of war, but rather a, a crime that is preventable and punishable under international human rights law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.int/pm/special-representative-secretary-general-sexual-violence-conflict-srsgsvc|title=Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict (SRSG/SVC) {{!}} Permanent Missions|website=www.un.int|language=en|access-date=2018-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2010, the first Special Representative, [[Margot Wallström]] of Sweden took office and in September 2012 [[Zainab Bangura|Zainab Hawa Bagura]] of Sierra Leone took over and served until early 2017. Progress achieved by the Office so far includes:

• Greater visibility, political will and momentum than ever before;

• Development of a robust legislative framework in the Security Council, which has given the Office new tools to drive the mandate to the ground and begin to effect some changes in behaviour;

• More strategic and structured engagement with the security and justice sectors, as part of a prevention strategy;

• Beginning to see some accountability at international and national levels, as a vital aspect of deterrence and prevention;

• Beginning to see national ownership, leadership and responsibility, evident in formal commitments that many governments are making to deal with this problem in their countries as well as commitments by regional organizations.

The three priorities of current SRSG [[Pramila Patten]] are:

i. Converting cultures of impunity into cultures of prevention and deterrence through justice and accountability

ii. Addressing structural gender-based inequality as the root cause and invisible driver of sexual violence in times of war and peace

iii. Fostering national ownership and leadership for a sustainable and holistic survivor-centered response.

According to the 2017 Report of the Secretary-General on Conflict-Related Sexual Violence, the Office focuses on 19 country situations, including 13 conflict settings, four post-conflict countries and two additional situations of concern.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/sexualviolenceinconflict/key-documents/reports/sg-reports/|title=SG Reports {{!}} United Nations Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict|website=www.un.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Team of Experts ==
The Office's Team of Experts (TOE) on the Rule of Law and Sexual Violence in Conflict works to strengthen the capacity of national rule of law and justice actors to investigate and prosecute for acts of conflict-related sexual violence. The lack of adequate national capacity to deliver justice often leads to widespread impunity and threatens survivors' access to justice, security and safety. The Team of Experts has been operational since 2011 and is the sole Security Council-mandated body tasked with building national capacity to enhance accountability for conflict-related sexual violence. It includes experts from the [[United Nations Department of Peacekeeping Operations|Department of Peacekeeping Operations]] (DPKO), the [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights]] (OHCHR) and the [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP), which serve as co-lead entities. In addition, the Team is complemented by a law enforcement expert seconded by the Government of [[Sweden]] and a reparations expert. Pursuant to [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1888|Security Council Resolution 1888]] (2009), the Team focuses on: (i) working closely with national legal and judicial officials and other personnel in the relevant governments’ civilian and military justice systems to address impunity, including by strengthening national capacity and drawing attention to the full range of justice mechanisms to be considered; (ii) identifying gaps in national response and encouraging a holistic national approach in addressing conflict-related sexual violence, including by enhancing criminal accountability, judicial capacity and responsiveness to victims (such as reparations mechanisms); (iii) making recommendations to coordinate domestic and international efforts and resources to reinforce governments’ ability to address conflict-related sexual violence; and (iv) working with other UN mechanisms including UN Missions, Country Teams, and the SRSG-SVC towards the full implementation of resolutions [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1820|1820]] (2008), [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1888|1888]] (2009), [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1960|1960]] (2010), [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 2106|2106]] (2013) and 2331 (2016). In line with its mandate, the Team of Experts provides assistance to governments, including in the areas of criminal investigation and prosecution; military justice; legislative reform; protection of victims and witnesses; reparations for survivors; and security sector oversight. In support of the Office of the SRSG-SVC, the TOE also serves a catalytic role in implementing joint communiqués and frameworks of cooperation agreed between the SRSG-SVC and national authorities, regional actors and other UN entities, complementing the work of UN country presences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/sexualviolenceinconflict/key-documents/reports/team-of-experts-rule-of-lawsexual-violence-in-conflict-reports/|title=Team of Experts Reports {{!}} United Nations Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict|website=www.un.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== UN Action Against Sexual Violence in Conflict (UN Action) ==
UN Action is a cross-UN initiative that unites the work of 14 entities with the goal of ending conflict-related sexual violence. The Chair of UN Action is the Special Representative on Sexual Violence in Conflict, Ms. [[Pramila Patten]]. Endorsed by the Secretary-General's Policy Committee in June 2007, it represents a concerted effort by the UN to work as one by amplifying advocacy, improving coordination and accountability and supporting country efforts to prevent conflict-related sexual violence and respond effectively to the needs of survivors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://stoprapenow.org/about/|title=Stop Rape Now - About|last=luccaco.com|website=stoprapenow.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UN Action Secretariat is based in the OSRSG-SVC and focuses on three main pillars:

Country-level Action: Strategic support to integrated UN Missions to help them design comprehensive strategies to combat conflict-related sexual violence and targeted support to strengthen joint UN programming.

Advocacy for Action: Raising public awareness and generating political will to address conflict-related sexual violence as part of a broader campaigns to Stop Rape Now and Unite to End Violence Against Women.

Learning by Doing: Creating a knowledge hub on the scale of conflict-related sexual violence and effective responses by the UN and partners.

The 14 entities in the network are: [[United Nations Department of Political Affairs]] (DPA), [[UN Women|United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women]] (UN Women), [[United Nations Population Fund]] (UNFPA), [[United Nations Development Programme]] (UNDP), [[Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS|Joint United Nations Program on HIV/AIDS]] (UNAIDS), [[United Nations Department of Peacekeeping Operations|Department of Peacekeeping Operations]] (DPKO), [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] (UNHCR), United Nations Peacebuilding Support Office (UN-PBSO), [[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights]] (OHCHR), [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), [[United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs|Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs]] (OCHA), [[UNICEF|United Nations Children's Fund]] (UNICEF), [[World Food Programme]] (WFP) and the [[International Organization for Migration]] (IOM).

== Secretary-General's Report on Conflict-Related Sexual Violence ==
The Office publishes the Report of the Secretary-General on Conflict-Related Sexual Violence annually to highlight a number of new and emerging concerns in relation to the use of sexual violence by parties to armed conflict as a tactic of war and terrorism. The report contains an annex of a list of parties credibly suspected of committing or being responsible for patterns of rape or other forms of sexual violence in situations of armed conflict, the majority of whom are non-state actors. It tracks developments relevant to the implementation of Resolutions [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1820|1820]] (2008), [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1888|1888]] (2009) and [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 1960|1960]] (2010) in 19 conflict-affected and post-conflict states and it is compiled through the analysis of data provided by United Nations offices, civil society and regional organizations, as well as Member States. The 2017 Report covers the following countries: Afghanistan, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Burundi, Central African Republic, Colombia, Cote d’Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Iraq, Libya, Mali, Myanmar, Nepal, Nigeria, Somalia, South Sudan, Sri Lanka, Sudan (Darfur), Syrian Arab Republic and Yemen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/sexualviolenceinconflict/key-documents/reports/sg-reports/|title=SG Reports {{!}} United Nations Office of the Special Representative of the Secretary-General on Sexual Violence in Conflict|website=www.un.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Omnipresence''' or '''ubiquity''' is the property of being present everywhere. The term omnipresence is most often used in a [[religious]] context as an attribute of a [[deity]] or [[God|supreme being]], while the term ubiquity is generally used to describe something "existing or being everywhere at the same time, constantly encountered, widespread, common." Ubiquitous can also be used as a synonym for words like worldwide, universal,  global, pervasive, all over the place. 

The omnipresence of a supreme being is conceived differently by different religious systems. In [[Monotheism|monotheistic]] beliefs like [[Christianity]], [[Judaism]], and [[Islam]] the divine and the universe are separate, but the divine is present everywhere. In [[Pantheism|pantheistic]] beliefs the divine and the universe are identical. In [[Panentheism|panentheistic]] beliefs the divine interpenetrates the universe, but extends beyond it in time and space.

==Introduction==
[[Hinduism]], and other religions that derive from it, incorporate the theory of ''transcendent and immanent omnipresence'' which is the traditional meaning of the word, [[Brahman]]. This theory defines a universal and fundamental substance, which is the source of all physical existence.

Divine omnipresence is thus one of the divine attributes, although in [[Western Christianity]] it has attracted less philosophical attention than such attributes as [[omnipotence]], [[omniscience]], or being eternal.

In Western theism, omnipresence is roughly described as the ability to be "present everywhere at the same time",&lt;ref&gt;[[Oxford Dictionary of English]]: http://www.askoxford.com/concise_oed/omnipresent&lt;/ref&gt; referring to an unbounded or universal presence. Omnipresence means minimally that there is no place to which God’s knowledge and power do not extend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Craig|first=William Lane|title=Doctrine of God (part 9)|url=http://www.reasonablefaith.org/defenders-2-podcast/transcript/s3-9|accessdate=20 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is related to the concept of ubiquity, the ability to be everywhere or in many places at once.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| work=Merriam Webster's Collegiate Dictionary| url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/ubiquity|title=ubiquity |accessdate=2013-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes unlimited temporal presence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06612a.htm#IIB |title=Nature and Attributes of God |work= [[Catholic Encyclopedia]] | publisher=NewAdvent.org |date=September 1, 1909 |accessdate=2013-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[William Lane Craig]] states that we shouldn’t think of God as being in space in the sense of being spread out like an invisible ether throughout space. He is not like an invisible gas that is everywhere present in space. This would be incorrect for several reasons. For one, it would mean that if the universe is finite, which is perfectly possible, then God would be finite. We do not want to say that because God is infinite. More seriously, if God is spread out throughout space, like an invisible ether, that means that he is not fully present everywhere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Craig|first=William Lane|title=Doctrine of God (part 8)|url=http://www.reasonablefaith.org/defenders-2-podcast/transcript/s3-8|accessdate=20 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some{{Who|date=June 2010}} argue that omnipresence is a derived characteristic: an [[omniscient]] and [[omnipotent]] deity knows everything and can be and act everywhere, simultaneously. Others propound a deity as having the "Three O's", including omnipresence as a unique characteristic of the deity. Most [[Christian denominations]] — following [[theology]] standardized by the [[Nicene Creed]] — explain the concept of omnipresence in the form of the "Trinity", by having a single deity (God) made up of three omnipresent persons, Father, Son and Holy Spirit.

==Omnipresence in religions==
&lt;!--''Comment: It is unclear as to what is meant by "Vedic religion" or labels such as "Indian Vedics." The article seems to claim omnipresence originated in South-east Asia. Possible, but highly unlikely.'' --&gt;
Several ancient cultures such as the [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic]] and the [[Native American religion|Native American]] civilizations share similar views on omnipresent nature; the ancient [[Ancient Egyptian religion|Egyptians]], [[Religion in ancient Greece|Greeks]] and [[Religion in ancient Rome|Romans]] did not worship an omnipresent being. While most [[Paleolithic]] cultures followed [[Paleolithic religion|polytheistic practices]]{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}, a form of omnipresent deity arises from a worldview that does not share ideas with [[mono-local deity]] cultures. Some omnipresent religions see the whole of [[existence]] as a manifestation of the deity. There are two predominant viewpoints here: [[pantheism]], deity is the summation of Existence; and panentheism, deity is an emergent property of existence. The first is closest to the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]]' worldview; the latter resembles the [[Vedic period|Vedic]] outlook.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

In traditional Jewish monotheism belief of panentheism, or an omnipresent God, is rejected.&lt;ref&gt;[[Saadia Gaon]] in his ''HaNivchar BaEmunot U'va-Deot'', II, 11 (English translation of portion free online at end of [https://forthodoxy.org/2015/11/23/parashat-vayetze-yaakov-hamakom-gods-place-or-the-place-of-god/ this post]; Rosenblatt translation [The Book of Beliefs and Opinions, Yale University, 1948], p. 124-125; Arabic/Hebrew Kafih ed. [הנבחר באמונות ובדעות, Jerusalem, 1970] p. 106). Cf. [[Maimonides]]' rejection of panentheism in his Commentary on the Mishnah, Tractate Sanhedrin, 10:1, third principle (English translation by Rosner in ''Maimonides' Commentary on the Mishnah: Tractate Sanhedrin'' [New York, 1981], p. 151; p. 141 in Kafih's Hebrew edition of the Order of Neziqin with Maimonides' Commentary [Jerusalem, 1963]) and [https://forthodoxy.org/2016/02/03/is-judaism-panentheistic-a-mekori-perspective/ Is Judaism Panentheistic? – A Brief Mekori Perspective].&lt;/ref&gt; While the "entire concept of God occupying physical space, or having any category of spatial reference apply to him was completely rejected by pure Judaic monotheism," [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] teachings, along with certain [[Kabbalistic]] systems, diverged to postulate belief in panentheism.&lt;ref&gt;Ilan, Yehudah B. [https://forthodoxy.org/2015/11/23/parashat-vayetze-yaakov-hamakom-gods-place-or-the-place-of-god/ Parashat Vayetze: HaMakom – God’s Place or the Place of God?] Retrieved 2016-02-16.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Islamic beliefs, pantheism is also rejected and omnipresence is described to transcend the physical. According to Shia tradition in [[Nahj al-Balagha]], a compilation of [[Ali]]'s teachings and letters, with commentary by [[Morteza Motahhari]], the only territory that God does not enter is that of nothingness and non-existence. God is with everything, but not in anything, and nothing is with him. God is not within things, though not out of them. He is over and above every kind of condition, state, similarity and likeness.  [[Ali]] says about God's omnipresence: 
* "He is with everything but not in physical nearness.  He is different from everything but not in physical separation." 
* “He  is  not  inside  things  in  the  sense  of  physical  [pervasion  or] penetration  and  is  not  outside  them  in  the  sense  of  [physical]  exclusion [for exclusion entails a kind of finitude].” 
* “He is distinct from things because He overpowers them, and the things are distinct from Him because of their subjection to Him.”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.duas.org/pdfs/Nahjul-Balagha.pdf pg 42&lt;/ref&gt;

In Christianity, as well as in Kabbalistic and Hasidic philosophy, God is omnipresent. However, the major difference between them and other religious systems is that God is still [[transcendence (religion)|transcendent]] to His [[Genesis creation myth|creation]] and yet [[immanence|immanent]] in relating to creation. God is not immersed in the substance of creation, even though he is able to interact with it as he chooses. He cannot be excluded from any location or object in creation. God's presence is continuous throughout all of creation, though it may not be revealed in the same way at the same time to people everywhere. At times, he may be actively present in a situation, while he may not reveal that he is present in another circumstance in some other area. God is omnipresent in a way that he is able to interact with his creation however he chooses, and is the very essence of his creation. While contrary to normal physical intuitions, such omnipresence is logically possible by way of the classic geometric point or its equivalent, in that such a point is, by definition, within all of space without taking up any space. The [[Bible]] states that God can be both present to a person in a manifest manner ([[Psalm]] 46:1, [[Isaiah]] 57:15) as well as being present in every situation in all of creation at any given time (Psalm 33:13-14). Specifically, Oden states that the Bible shows that God can be present in every aspect of human life:

* God is naturally present in every aspect of the natural order, in every level of [[causality]], every fleeting [[Moment (time)|moment]] and momentous event of [[natural history]]...(Psalm 8:3, Isaiah 40:12, [[Nahum]] 1:3)
*God is bodily present in the [[Incarnation (Christianity)]] of his Son, [[Jesus]] [[Christ]] ([[Gospel of John]] 1:14, [[Colossians]] 2:9)
*God is sacredly present and becomes known in special places where God chooses to meet us, places that become set apart by the faithful remembering community ([[1 Corinthians]] 11:23-29) where it may said: "Truly the Lord is in this place" ([[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 28:16, Matthew 18:20)" &lt;ref&gt;Oden, Thomas C.  ''The Living God''.  ''Systematic Theology'' Vol. 1, 67-69&lt;/ref&gt;

Marbaniang points out that omnipresence doesn't mean divine occupation of all space, nor divine distribution over all space, nor indwelling of every entity, nor that God cannot move in space, nor the divinification of the universe; but means that God is fully present every-where, and that God can do different things at different places at the same time.&lt;ref&gt;Domenic Marbaniang, "Omnipresence", &lt;i&gt;Light of Life&lt;/i&gt;, Mumbai, February 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5099">'''Political subjectivity''' is a term used to indicate the deeply embedded nature of [[subjectivity]] and [[subjective experience]] in a socially constructed system of [[Power (social and political)|power]] and [[Meaning (linguistics)|meaning]]&lt;ref&gt;Solomon, T., 2015. The politics of subjectivity in American foreign policy discourses. University of Michigan Press.&lt;/ref&gt;. The notion of political subjectivity is an emerging idea in [[social sciences]] and [[humanities]]&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D. 2016.

&lt;/ref&gt;. In some sense the term political subjectivity reflects the converging point of a number of traditionally distinct disciplinary lines of investigation, such as [[philosophy]], [[anthropology]], [[political theory]], and [[psychoanalytic theory]]. Above all, the current conceptualization of political subjectivity has become possible due to a fundamental shift in humanities and social sciences during the 20th century, commonly known as the [[linguistic turn]].

Major figures associated with the question of political subjectivity come from diverse disciplinary backgrounds, such as German philosopher [[GWF Hegel]], French psychoanalyst [[Jacques Lacan]], French historian [[Michel Foucault]], American literary critic [[Fredric Jameson]], American cultural anthropologist [[Clifford Geertz]], American medical anthropologist [[Byron J. Good]], American philosopher and gender theorist [[Judith Butler]], Canadian medical anthropologist [http://artsandscience.usask.ca/profile/SRahimi Sadeq Rahimi], Argentine political theorist [[Ernesto Laclau]], Slovenian philosopher [[Slavoj Zizek]], Greek political theorist [[Yannis Stavrakakis]], and many others.

The term "political subjectivity" had been used in earlier literature, such as Steven Brown's book, ''Political subjectivity: Applications of Q methodology in political science''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Brown |first1=Steven |title=Political subjectivity: Applications of Q methodology in political science |date=1980 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven |isbn=0300025793}}&lt;/ref&gt; to refer to individual political view points as affected by social and personal psychological processes. But the term was later re-appropriated to refer to the much more intricate idea that the very experience of [[subjectivity]] is fundamentally political. According to Sadeq Rahimi in ''[https://www.academia.edu/12387120/Meaning_Madness_and_Political_Subjectivity Meaning, Madness and Political Subjectivity]'', "Politicality is not an added aspect of the subject, but indeed the mode of being of the subject, that is, precisely what the subject is."&lt;ref name="Meaning, Madness and Political Subjectivity"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rahimi |first1=Sadeq |title=Meaning, Madness and Political Subjectivity |date=2015 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=1138840823 |url=http://www.routledgementalhealth.com/books/details/9781138840829/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An early (1981) book by [[Fredric Jameson]], ''[[The Political Unconscious|The Political Unconscious: Narrative as a Socially Symbolic Act]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jameson|first1=Fredric|title=The Political Unconscious: Narrative as a Socially Symbolic Act|date=1981|publisher=Cornell University Press|location=Ithaca|isbn=080149222X}}&lt;/ref&gt; can be considered one of the forerunners of the notion of political subjectivity.  In his book Jameson attributed what he termed a "political unconscious" to [[Text (literary theory)|text]], asserting that all [[Text (literary theory)|text]] has embedded in it, albeit in an implicit form, the encodings of the political history of the environment in which they have been produced.  He then proposed “the doctrine of a political unconscious,” as an analytic method for unearthing the [[Hermeneutics|hermeneutically]] repressed political memories of [[Text (literary theory)|text]], and “restoring to the surface of the text the repressed and buried reality of this fundamental history” (p.&amp;nbsp;20).  While Jameson's original theory of the political unconscious was primarily a [[Neo-Marxism|neo-Marxist]] approach to [[literary criticism]], later proliferation and interdisciplinary cross-fertilization of theories of subjectivity have greatly expanded Jameson's original ideas to include the range of political, cultural and psychological processes within the framework of political subjectivity.

In [[psychology]] and [[cognitive science]], the '''positivity effect''' is the ability to constructively analyze a situation where the desired results are not achieved; but still obtain positive feedback that assists our future progression. When a person is considering people they like (including themselves), the person tends to make situational attributions about their negative behaviors and dispositional attributions about their positive behaviors. The reverse may be true for people that the person dislikes. This may well be because of the [[cognitive dissonance|dissonance]] between liking a person and seeing them behave negatively.
Example: If a friend hits someone, one would tell them the other guy deserved it or that he had to defend himself.

== In attribution==
{{Main article|Selective perception}}
The positivity effect pertains to the tendency of people, when evaluating the causes of the behaviors of a person they like or prefer, to attribute the person's inherent disposition as the cause of their positive behaviors and the situations surrounding them as the cause of their negative behaviors. The positivity effect is the inverse of the ''[[negativity effect]]'', which is found when people evaluate the causes of the behaviors of a person they dislike. Both effects are [[attributional bias]]es.

== In perception ==
On online social networks like [[Twitter]], users prefer to share positive news, and are emotionally affected by positive news more than twice than by negative news.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title = Measuring Emotional Contagion in Social Media |journal = [[PLoS ONE]] |volume = 10 |issue = 1 |year = 2015 |pages = e0142390 |doi = 10.1371/journal.pone.0142390|last1 = Ferrara |first1 = Emilio |last2 = Yang |first2 = Zeyao |pmid=26544688 |pmc=4636231}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |title = Quantifying the effect of sentiment on information diffusion in social media |journal = Peer J Computer Science |volume = 1 |year = 2015 |pages = e26 |doi = 10.7717/peerj-cs.26|last1 = Ferrara |first1 = Emilio |last2 = Yang |first2 = Zeyao }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3602">In psychology, the '''positivity offset''' is a phenomenon where people tend to interpret neutral situations as mildly positive, and rate their lives as good, most of the time. The positivity offset stands in notable asymmetry to the [[negativity bias]].

==In perception==
[[Social neuroscience]] researcher [[John Cacioppo]] has assembled evidence that people typically see their surroundings as positive, whenever a clear threat is not present. Because of the positivity offset, people are motivated to explore and engage with their surroundings, instead of being balanced inactive between approach and avoidance.&lt;ref name=Cacioppo1999/&gt;

==In life satisfaction==
Across most cultures, nations, and groups of people, the [[average]] and [[median]] ratings of [[life satisfaction]] are not neutral, as one might expect, but mildly positive.

Groups of people who do not show a positivity offset include people with [[Clinical depression|depression]], people in severe [[poverty]], and people who live in perpetually threatening situations. However, many groups of people that outsiders would not expect{{Says who|date=July 2011}} to show the positivity offset do, such as people with [[paraplegia]] and [[spinal injury]], very [[elderly]] people, and people with many [[chronic illness]]es. In some cases these individuals never become as satisfied or happy with their lives as before their illness or injury, but over time (generally approximately two years), they still stabilize at a level substantially above neutral. That is, they judge themselves overall as satisfied or happy and not dissatisfied or unhappy.&lt;ref name="Lucas2007"/&gt;

Many of the major psychological publications on life satisfaction ratings have come from [[Ed Diener]] and colleagues.&lt;ref name="Diener1996"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Diener2004"/&gt; This empirical work gathered life-satisfaction judgments from many modern and traditional cultures worldwide.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11769">'''Pregroup grammar (PG)''' is a [[Formal grammar|grammar formalism]] intimately related to [[categorial grammar]]s. Much like categorial grammar (CG), PG is a kind of [[type logical grammar]]. Unlike CG, however, PG does not have a distinguished function type. Rather, PG uses inverse types combined with its monoidal operation.

== Definition of a pregroup ==

A pregroup is a [[partial order|partially ordered]] [[universal algebra|algebra]] &lt;math&gt;(A, 1, \cdot, -^l, -^r, \leq)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;(A, 1, \cdot)&lt;/math&gt; is a [[monoid]], satisfying the following relations:

* &lt;math&gt;x^l \cdot x \leq 1 \qquad x \cdot x^r \leq 1&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(contraction)
* &lt;math&gt;1 \leq x \cdot x^l \qquad 1 \leq x^r \cdot x&lt;/math&gt; &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(expansion)

The contraction and expansion relations are sometimes called  [[Ajdukiewicz]] laws.

From this, it can be proven that the following equations hold:

* &lt;math&gt;1^l = 1 = 1^r&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;x^{lr} = x = x^{rl}&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;(x\cdot y)^l = y^l \cdot x^l \qquad (x\cdot y)^r = y^r \cdot x^r&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;x^l&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x^r&lt;/math&gt; are called the [[left adjoint|left]] and [[right adjoint]]s of ''x'', respectively.

The symbol &lt;math&gt;\cdot&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\leq&lt;/math&gt; are also written &lt;math&gt;\otimes&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\to&lt;/math&gt; respectively. In [[category theory]], pregroups are also known as [[autonomous category|autonomous categories]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference

== Definition of a pregroup grammar ==

A pregroup grammar consists of a [[lexicon]] of words (and possibly [[morphemes]]) ''L'', a set of atomic types ''T'' which [[free object|freely generates]] a pregroup, and an relation &lt;math&gt;:&lt;/math&gt; that relates words to types. In simple pregroup grammars, typing is a function that maps words to only one type each.

=== Examples ===

Some simple, intuitive examples using English as the language to model demonstrate the core principles behind pregroups and their use in linguistic domains.

Let ''L'' = {John, Mary, the, dog, cat, met, barked, at}, let ''T'' = {''N, S, N''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}, and let the following typing relation holds:

: &lt;math&gt;\text{John} : N \qquad \text{Mary} : N \qquad \text{the} : N \cdot N_0^l \qquad \text{dog} : N_0 \qquad \text{cat} : N_0&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\text{met} : N^r \cdot S \cdot N^l \qquad \text{barked} : N^r \cdot S \qquad \text{at} : S^r \cdot N^{rr} \cdot N^r \cdot S \cdot N^l&lt;/math&gt;

A sentence ''S'' that has type ''T'' is said to be grammatical if &lt;math&gt;T \leq S&lt;/math&gt;. We can prove this by use of a chain of &lt;math&gt;\leq&lt;/math&gt;. For example, we can prove that &lt;math&gt;\text{John met Mary} : N \cdot N^r \cdot S \cdot N^l \cdot N&lt;/math&gt; is grammatical by proving that &lt;math&gt;N \cdot N^r \cdot S \cdot N^l \cdot N \leq S&lt;/math&gt;:

: &lt;math&gt;N \cdot N^r \cdot S \cdot N^l \cdot N ~\leq~ S \cdot N^l \cdot N ~\leq~ S&lt;/math&gt;

by first using contraction on &lt;math&gt;N \cdot N^r&lt;/math&gt; and then again on &lt;math&gt;N^l \cdot N&lt;/math&gt;. A more convenient notation exists, however, that indicates contractions by connecting them with a drawn link between the contracting types (provided that the links are nested, i.e. don't cross). Words are also typically placed above their types to make the proof more intuitive. The same proof in this notation is simply

[[File:PregroupGrammar-Example-JohnMetMary.png|center|frameless]]

A more complex example proves that ''the dog barked at the cat'' is grammatical:

== Historical notes ==

Pregroup grammars have been introduced by [[Joachim Lambek]] in 1993 as a development of his [[Categorial grammar|syntactic calculus]], replacing the quotients by adjoints.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such adjoints had already been used earlier by [[Zellig Harris|Harris]] but without iterated adjoints and expansion rules.
Adding such adjoints was interesting to handle more complex linguistic cases, where the fact that &lt;math&gt;a^{ll} \neq a&lt;/math&gt; is needed. It was also motivated by a more algebraic viewpoint: the definition of a pregroup is a weakening of that of a [[Group (mathematics)|group]], introducing a distinction between the left and right inverses and replacing the equality by an order. This weakening was needed because using types from a [[free group]] would not work: an adjective would get the type &lt;math&gt;N \cdot N^{-1} = 1&lt;/math&gt;, hence it could be inserted at any position in the sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

== Semantics of pregroup grammars ==

Because of the lack of function types in PG, the usual method of giving a semantics via the [[Lambda calculus|λ-calculus]] or via function denotations is not available in any obvious way. Instead, two different methods exist, one purely formal method that corresponds to the λ-calculus, and one denotational method analogous to (a fragment of) the tensor mathematics of [[quantum mechanics]].

=== Purely formal semantics ===

The purely formal semantics for PG consists of a logical language defined according to the following rules:

* Given a set of atomic terms ''T'' = {''a'', ''b'', ...} and atomic function symbols ''F'' = {''f&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;, g&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'', ...} (where subscripts are meta-notational indicating arity), and variables ''x'', ''y'', ..., all constants, variables, and well-formed function applications are basic terms (a function application is well-formed when the function symbol is applied to the appropriate number of arguments, which can be drawn from the atomic terms, variables, or can be other basic terms)
* Any basic term is a term
* Given any variable ''x'', [''x''] is a term
* Given any terms ''m'' and ''n'', &lt;math&gt;m \cdot n&lt;/math&gt; is a term

Some examples of terms are ''f''(''x''), ''g''(''a'',''h''(''x'',''y'')), &lt;math&gt;g(x,b) \cdot [x]&lt;/math&gt;. A variable ''x'' is free in a term ''t'' if [''x''] does not appear in ''t'', and a term with no free variables is a closed term. Terms can be typed with pregroup types in the obvious manner.

The usual conventions regarding α conversion apply.

For a given language, we give an assignment ''I'' that maps typed words to typed closed terms in a way that respects the pregroup structure of the types. For the English fragment given above we might therefore have the following assignment (with the obvious, implicit set of atomic terms and function symbols):

: &lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
I(John : N) &amp;= j : E
\\
I(Mary : N) &amp;= m : E
\\
I(the : N \cdot N_0^l) &amp;= \iota(p) \cdot [p] : E \cdot E_0^l
\\
I(dog : N_0) &amp;= dog : E_0
\\
I(cat : N_0) &amp;= cat : E_0
\\
I(met : N^r \cdot S \cdot N^l) &amp;= [x] \cdot met(x,y) \cdot [y] : E^r \cdot T \cdot E^l
\\
I(barked : N^r \cdot S) &amp;= [x] \cdot barked(x) : E^r \cdot T
\\
I(at : S^r \cdot N^{rr} \cdot N^r \cdot S \cdot N^l) &amp;= [x] \cdot y \cdot [y] \cdot at(x,z) \cdot [z] : T^r \cdot E^{rr} \cdot E^r \cdot T \cdot E^l
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''E'' is the type of entities in the domain, and ''T'' is the type of truth values.

Together with this core definition of the semantics of PG, we also have a reduction rules that are employed in parallel with the type reductions. Placing the syntactic types at the top and semantics below, we have

[[File:PregroupGrammar-LeftAdjointReduction.png|center|frameless|upright=1.5]]

[[File:PregroupGrammar-RightAdjointReduction.png|center|frameless|upright=1.5]]

For example, applying this to the types and semantics for the sentence &lt;math&gt;\text{John met Mary} : N \cdot (N^r \cdot S \cdot N^l) \cdot N&lt;/math&gt; (emphasizing the link being reduced)

[[File:SemanticCalculation-JohnMetMary.png|center|frameless|upright=1.25]]

For the sentence &lt;math&gt;\text{the dog barked at the cat} : (N \cdot N_0^l) \cdot N_0 \cdot (N^r \cdot S) \cdot (S^r \cdot N^{rr} \cdot N^r \cdot S \cdot N^l) \cdot (N \cdot N_0^l) \cdot N_0&lt;/math&gt;:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1927">In [[mathematical logic]], a '''propositional variable''' (also called a '''sentential variable''' or '''sentential letter''') is a [[Variable (mathematics)|variable]] which can either be '''true''' or '''false'''. Propositional variables are the basic building-blocks of [[propositional formula]]s, used in [[propositional logic]] and higher logics.
==Uses==
Formulas in logic are typically built up recursively from some propositional variables, some number of [[logical connective]]s, and some [[logical quantifier]]s.  Propositional variables are the [[atomic formula]]s of propositional logic. 

;Example
In a given propositional logic, we might define a formula as follows:

*Every propositional variable is a formula.
*Given a formula ''X'' the [[negation]] ''¬X'' is a formula.
*Given two formulas ''X'' and ''Y'', and a [[binary connective]] ''b'' (such as the [[logical conjunction]] ∧), then ''(X b Y)'' is a formula. (Note the parentheses.)

In this way, all of the formulas of propositional logic are built up from propositional variables as a basic unit. Propositional variables should not be confused with the [[metavariable]]s which appear in the [[Propositional_logic#Example_1._Simple_axiom_system|typical axioms of propositional calculus]]; the latter effectively range over well-formed formulae.

==In first order logic==
Propositional variables are represented as nullary [[Predicate (mathematical logic)|predicates]] in [[first order logic]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3309">A '''rank abundance curve''' or '''Whittaker plot''' is a chart used by ecologists to display [[relative species abundance]], a component of [[biodiversity]]. It can also be used to visualize [[species richness]] and [[species evenness]]. It overcomes the shortcomings of [[diversity index|biodiversity indices]] that cannot display the relative role different variables played in their calculation.

[[Image:Rank abundance chart.JPG|thumb|A rank abundance curve]]

The curve is a 2D chart with relative abundance on the Y-axis and the abundance rank on the X-axis.
* X-axis: The abundance rank. The most abundant species is given rank 1, the second most abundant is 2 and so on.
* Y-axis: The relative abundance. Usually measured on a log scale, this is a measure of a species abundance (e.g., the number of individuals) relative to the abundance of other species.

==Interpreting a rank abundance curve==
The rank abundance curve visually depicts both species richness and species evenness. Species richness can be viewed as the number of different species on the chart i.e., how many species were ranked. Species evenness is reflected in the slope of the line that fits the graph (assuming a linear, i.e. logarithmic series, relationship). A steep gradient indicates low evenness as the high-ranking species have much higher abundances than the low-ranking species. A shallow gradient indicates high evenness as the abundances of different species are similar.

==Quantitative comparison of rank abundance curves==
Quantitative comparison of rank abundance curves of different communities can be done using RADanalysis package in [[R (programming language)|R]]. This package uses the [[max rank normalization]] method&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Saeedghalati | first1 = M. | title = Quantitative Comparison of Abundance Structures of Generalized Communities: From B-Cell Receptor Repertoires to Microbiomes | doi = 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1005362 | journal = PLoS Comput. Biol. | volume =  | issue =  | pages =  | year = 2017 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which a rank abundance distribution is made by normalization of rank abundance curves of communities to the same number of ranks and then normalize the relative abundances to one.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6420">In [[computer science]], '''run-time algorithm specialization''' is a methodology for creating efficient algorithms for costly computation tasks of certain kinds. The methodology originates in the field of [[automated theorem proving]] and, more specifically, in the [[Vampire theorem prover]] project.

The idea is inspired by the use of [[partial evaluation]] in optimising program translation. 
Many core operations in theorem provers exhibit the following pattern.
Suppose that we need to execute some algorithm &lt;math&gt;\mathit{alg}(A,B)&lt;/math&gt; in a situation where a value of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; ''is fixed for potentially many different values of'' &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;. In order to do this efficiently, we can try to find a specialization of &lt;math&gt;\mathit{alg}&lt;/math&gt; for every fixed &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., such an algorithm &lt;math&gt;\mathit{alg}_A&lt;/math&gt;, that executing &lt;math&gt;\mathit{alg}_A(B)&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to executing &lt;math&gt;\mathit{alg}(A,B)&lt;/math&gt;.

The specialized algorithm may be more efficient than the generic one, since it can ''exploit some particular properties'' of the fixed value &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. Typically, &lt;math&gt;\mathit{alg}_A(B)&lt;/math&gt; can avoid some operations that &lt;math&gt;\mathit{alg}(A,B)&lt;/math&gt; would have to perform, if they are known to be redundant for this particular parameter &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. 
In particular, we can often identify some tests that are true or false for &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, unroll loops and recursion, etc.

== Difference from partial evaluation ==
The key difference between run-time specialization and partial evaluation is that the values of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; on which &lt;math&gt;\mathit{alg}&lt;/math&gt; is specialised are not known statically, so the ''specialization takes place at run-time''.

There is also an important technical difference. Partial evaluation is applied to algorithms explicitly represented as codes in some programming language. At run-time, we do not need any concrete representation of &lt;math&gt;\mathit{alg}&lt;/math&gt;. We only have to ''imagine'' &lt;math&gt;\mathit{alg}&lt;/math&gt; ''when we program'' the specialization procedure.
All we need is a concrete representation of the specialized version &lt;math&gt;\mathit{alg}_A&lt;/math&gt;. This also means that we cannot use any universal methods for specializing algorithms, which is usually the case with partial evaluation. Instead, we have to program a specialization procedure for every particular algorithm &lt;math&gt;\mathit{alg}&lt;/math&gt;. An important advantage of doing so is that we can use some powerful ''ad hoc'' tricks exploiting peculiarities of &lt;math&gt;\mathit{alg}&lt;/math&gt; and the representation of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, which are beyond the reach of any universal specialization methods.

==Specialization with compilation==

The specialized algorithm has to be represented in a form that can be interpreted.
In many situations, usually when &lt;math&gt;\mathit{alg}_A(B)&lt;/math&gt; is to be computed on many values &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; in a row, we can write &lt;math&gt;\mathit{alg}_A&lt;/math&gt; as a code of a special [[abstract machine]], and we often say that &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is ''compiled''.  
Then the code itself can be additionally optimized by answer-preserving transformations that rely only on the semantics of instructions of the abstract machine.

Instructions of the abstract machine can usually be represented as records. One field of such a record stores an integer tag that identifies the instruction type, other fields may be used for storing additional parameters of the instruction, for example a pointer to another
instruction representing a label, if the semantics of the instruction requires a jump. All instructions of a code can be stored in an array, or list, or tree.

Interpretation is done by fetching instructions in some order, identifying their type
and executing the actions associated with this type. 
In [[C (programming language)|C]] or C++ we can use a '''switch''' statement to associate 
some actions with different instruction tags. 
Modern compilers usually compile a '''switch''' statement with integer labels from a narrow range rather efficiently by storing the address of the statement corresponding to a value &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; in the &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;-th cell of a special array. One can exploit this
by taking values for instruction tags from a small interval of integers.

==Data-and-algorithm specialization==

There are situations when many instances of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; are intended for long-term storage and the calls of &lt;math&gt;\mathit{alg}(A,B)&lt;/math&gt; occur with different &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; in an unpredictable order.
For example, we may have to check &lt;math&gt;\mathit{alg}(A_1,B_1)&lt;/math&gt; first, then &lt;math&gt;\mathit{alg}(A_2,B_2)&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\mathit{alg}(A_1,B_3)&lt;/math&gt;, and so on.
In such circumstances, full-scale specialization with compilation may not be suitable due to excessive memory usage.  
However, we can sometimes find a compact specialized representation &lt;math&gt;A^{\prime}&lt;/math&gt;
for every &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, that can be stored with, or instead of, &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. 
We also define a variant &lt;math&gt;\mathit{alg}^{\prime}&lt;/math&gt; that works on this representation 
and any call to &lt;math&gt;\mathit{alg}(A,B)&lt;/math&gt; is replaced by &lt;math&gt;\mathit{alg}^{\prime}(A^{\prime},B)&lt;/math&gt;, intended to do the same job faster.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21861">In [[theoretical physics]], a '''scalar–tensor theory''' is a theory that includes both a [[Scalar field theory|scalar field]] and a [[tensor]] field to represent a certain interaction.  For example, the [[Brans–Dicke theory]] of [[gravitation]] uses both a scalar field and a [[tensor field]] to mediate the gravitational interaction.

== Tensor fields and field theory ==
Modern physics tries to derive all physical theories from as few principles as possible. In this way, [[Newtonian mechanics]] as well as [[quantum mechanics]] are derived from [[William Rowan Hamilton|Hamilton]]'s ''[[principle of least action]]''. In this approach, the behavior of a system is not described via [[force]]s, but by functions which describe the energy of the system. Most important are the energetic quantities known as the [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]] function and the [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] function. Their derivatives in space are known as [[Hamiltonian field theory|Hamiltonian density]] and [[Lagrangian (field theory)|the Lagrangian density]]. Going to these quantities leads to the field theories.

Modern physics uses [[field (physics)|field]] theories to explain reality. These fields can be [[scalar (physics)|scalar]], [[vector field|vectorial]] or [[tensor field|tensorial]]. An example of a scalar field is the temperature field. An example of a vector field is the wind velocity field. An example of a tensor field is the [[Cauchy stress tensor|stress tensor]] field in a stressed body, used in [[continuum mechanics]].

== Gravity as field theory ==
In physics, forces (as vectorial quantities) are given as the derivative (gradient) of scalar quantities named potentials. In classical physics before [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]], gravitation was given in the same way, as consequence of a gravitational force (vectorial), given through a scalar potential field, dependent of the mass of the particles. Thus, [[Isaac Newton|Newtonian]] gravity is called a [[scalar theory]]. The gravitational force is dependent of the distance ''r'' of the massive objects to each other (more exactly, their centre of mass). Mass is a parameter and space and time are unchangeable.

Einstein's theory of gravity, the [[General Relativity]] (GR) is of another nature. It unifies space and time in a 4-dimensional ''manifold'' called space-time. In GR there is no gravitational force, instead, the actions we ascribed to being a force are the consequence of the local curvature of space-time. That curvature is defined mathematically by the so-called [[Metric (mathematics)|metric]], which is a function of the total energy, including mass, in the area. The derivative of the metric is a function that approximates the classical Newtonian force in most cases. The metric is a tensorial quantity of degree 2 (it can be given as a 4x4 matrix, an object carrying 2 indices).

Another possibility to explain gravitation in this context is by using both tensor (of degree n&gt;1) and scalar fields, i.e. so that gravitation is given neither solely through a scalar field nor solely through a metric. These are scalar–tensor theories of gravitation.

The field theoretical start of General Relativity is given through the Lagrange density. It is a scalar and gauge invariant (look at [[gauge theories]]) quantity dependent on the curvature scalar R. This Lagrangian, following Hamilton's principle, leads to the field equations of [[David Hilbert|Hilbert]] and [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]. If in the Lagrangian the curvature (or a quantity related to it) is multiplied with a square scalar field, field theories of scalar–tensor theories of gravitation are obtained. In them, the [[gravitational constant]] of Newton is no longer a real constant but a quantity dependent of the scalar field.

===Mathematical formulation===

An action of such a gravitational scalar–tensor theory can be written as follows:

:&lt;math&gt; S = \frac{1}{c} \int {d^4 x \sqrt{-g} \frac{1}{2 \mu}} \times \left[ \Phi  R-\frac{\omega(\Phi)}{\Phi} (\partial_\sigma \Phi)^2-V(\Phi)+ 2 \mu~\mathcal{L}_m (g_{\mu \nu}, \Psi)  \right], &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is the metric determinant, &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the Ricci scalar constructed from the metric &lt;math&gt;g_{\mu \nu}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is a coupling constant with the dimensions &lt;math&gt;L^{-1} M^{-1}T^2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;V(\Phi)&lt;/math&gt; is the scalar-field potential, &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}_m&lt;/math&gt; is the material Lagrangian and &lt;math&gt;\Psi&lt;/math&gt; represents the non-gravitational fields. Here, the Brans–Dicke parameter &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; has been generalized to a function. Although &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; is often written as being &lt;math&gt;8 \pi G / c^4&lt;/math&gt;, one has to keep in mind that the fundamental constant &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; there, is not the [[Gravitational constant|constant of gravitation]] that can be measured with, for instance, [[Cavendish experiment|Cavendish type experiments]]. Indeed, the [[Gravitational constant|empirical gravitational constant]] is generally no longer a constant in scalar–tensor theories, but a function of the scalar field &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt;. The metric and scalar-field equations respectively write:

:&lt;math&gt;R_{\mu \nu}-\frac{1}{2}g_{\mu \nu}R= \frac{\mu}{\Phi}T_{\mu
\nu}+ \frac{1}{\Phi} [\nabla_\mu \nabla_\nu -g_{\mu \nu}\Box]\Phi 
+\frac{\omega(\Phi)}{\Phi^2}(\partial_\mu \Phi \partial_\nu \Phi
- \frac{1}{2}g_{\mu \nu}(\partial_\alpha \Phi)^2)-g_{\mu \nu} \frac{V(\Phi)}{2 \Phi} , &lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{2\omega(\Phi)+3}{\Phi}\Box \Phi=  \frac{\mu}{\Phi} T   - \frac{\omega'(\Phi)}{\Phi} (\partial_\sigma \Phi)^2 + V'(\Phi) - 2 \frac{V(\Phi)}{\Phi} . &lt;/math&gt;
Also, the theory satisfies the following conservation equation, implying that test-particles follow space-time [[Geodesics in general relativity|geodesics]] such as in general relativity:
:&lt;math&gt;\nabla_\sigma T^{\mu \sigma} = 0, &lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt; T^{\mu \sigma}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Stress–energy tensor|stress-energy tensor]] defined as
:&lt;math&gt;T_{\mu \nu}=-\frac{2}{\sqrt{-g}} \frac{\delta(\sqrt{-g}\mathcal{L}_m)}{\delta g^{\mu \nu}}. &lt;/math&gt;

====The Newtonian approximation of the theory====

Developing perturbatively the theory defined by the previous action around a Minkowskian background, and assuming non-relativistic gravitational sources, the first order gives the Newtonian approximation of the theory. In this approximation, and for a theory without potential,  the metric writes
:&lt;math&gt;g_{00}=-1+ 2 \frac{U}{c^2}+\mathcal{O}(c^{-3}),~ g_{0i}=\mathcal{O}(c^{-2}),~ g_{ij}=\delta_{ij}+\mathcal{O}(c^{-1}),&lt;/math&gt;
with &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; satisfying the following usual [[Poisson's equation|Poisson equation]] at the lowest order of the approximation:
:&lt;math&gt;\triangle U = 8 \pi G_\mathrm{eff}~ \rho+\mathcal{O}(c^{-1}),&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \rho&lt;/math&gt; is the density of the gravitational source and &lt;math&gt; G_\mathrm{eff}= \frac{2 \omega_0 +4}{2 \omega_0 +3} \frac{G}{\Phi_0}&lt;/math&gt; (the subscript &lt;math&gt;_0 &lt;/math&gt; indicates that the corresponding value is taken at present cosmological time and location). Therefore, the [[Gravitational constant|empirical gravitational constant]] is a function of the present value of the scalar-field background &lt;math&gt; \Phi_0 &lt;/math&gt; and therefore theoretically depends on time and location.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Galiautdinov|first=Andrei|last2=Kopeikin|first2=Sergei M.|date=2016-08-10|title=Post-Newtonian celestial mechanics in scalar-tensor cosmology|url=https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevD.94.044015|journal=[[Physical Review D]]|volume=94|issue=4|pages=044015|arxiv=1606.09139|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.94.044015|via=|bibcode=2016PhRvD..94d4015G}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, no deviation from the constancy of the Newtonian gravitational constant has been measured,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Uzan|first=Jean-Philippe|date=2011-12-01|title=Varying Constants, Gravitation and Cosmology|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.12942/lrr-2011-2|journal=[[Living Reviews in Relativity]]|language=en|volume=14|issue=1|pages=2|doi=10.12942/lrr-2011-2|issn=2367-3613|via=|arxiv=1009.5514|bibcode=2011LRR....14....2U}}&lt;/ref&gt; implying that the scalar-field background &lt;math&gt; \Phi_0 &lt;/math&gt; is pretty stable over time. Such a stability is not theoretically generally expected but can be theoretically explained by several mechanisms.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Damour|first=Thibault|author-link=Thibault Damour|last2=Nordtvedt|first2=Kenneth|author-link2=Kenneth Nordtvedt|date=1993-04-12|title=General relativity as a cosmological attractor of tensor-scalar theories|url=https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.70.2217|journal=[[Physical Review Letters]]|volume=70|issue=15|pages=2217–2219|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.70.2217|via=|bibcode=1993PhRvL..70.2217D}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The first post-Newtonian approximation of the theory====

Developing the theory at the next level leads to the so-called first post-Newtonian order. For a theory without potential and in a system of coordinates respecting the weak isotropy condition&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Damour|first=Thibault|last2=Soffel|first2=Michael|last3=Xu|first3=Chongming|date=1991-05-15|title=General-relativistic celestial mechanics.

:&lt;math&gt;g_{00}=-1+\frac{2 W}{c^2} - \beta \frac{2 W^2}{c^4}+\mathcal{O}(c^{-5}) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;g_{0i}=-(\gamma+1) \frac{2W_i}{c^3}+\mathcal{O}(c^{-4}) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;g_{ij}=\delta_{ij} \left(1+\gamma \frac{2 W}{c^2} \right)+\mathcal{O}(c^{-3}) &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\Box W+\frac{1+2\beta -3\gamma }{c^2} W\triangle W+\frac{2}{c^2}(
1+\gamma) \partial_t J =-4\pi G_\mathrm{eff}\Sigma+ \mathcal{O}(c^{-3}) ,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\triangle W_i-\partial x_i J =-4\pi G_\mathrm{eff}\Sigma^i + \mathcal{O}(c^{-1}), &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;J&lt;/math&gt; is a function depending on the coordinate gauge

:&lt;math&gt;J =\partial_t W+\partial_k W_k+\mathcal{O}(c^{-1}).&lt;/math&gt;

It corresponds to the remaining [[General covariance|diffeomorphism]] degree of freedom that is not fixed by the weak isotropy condition. The sources are defined as

:&lt;math&gt;\Sigma =\frac{1}{c^2} (T^{00}+\gamma T^{kk}), ~~~\Sigma^i =\frac{1}{c} T^{0i},&lt;/math&gt;

the so-called [[Parameterized post-Newtonian formalism|post-Newtonian parameters]] are

:&lt;math&gt;\gamma = \frac{\omega_0 +1}{\omega_0 +2}, ~~\beta = 1+\frac{\omega_0^{\prime}}{( 2\omega_0 +3) (2\omega_0+4)^2},&lt;/math&gt;

and finally the [[Gravitational constant|empirical gravitational constant]] &lt;math&gt;G_\mathrm{eff}&lt;/math&gt; is given by

:&lt;math&gt;G_\mathrm{eff}= \frac{2\omega_0+4}{2\omega_0+3}G,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is the (true) constant that appears in the coupling constant &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; defined previously.

== Observational constraints on the theory ==

Current observations indicate that &lt;math&gt;\gamma-1=(2.1 \pm 2.3)\times 10^{-5}&lt;/math&gt;,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; which means that &lt;math&gt;\omega_0 &gt; 40 000&lt;/math&gt;. Although explaining such a value in the context of the original [[Brans–Dicke theory]] is impossible, [[Thibault Damour|Damour]] and [[Kenneth Nordtvedt|Nordtvedt]] found that the field equations of the general theory often lead to an evolution of the function &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; toward infinity during the evolution of the universe.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Hence, according to them, the current high value of the function &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; could be a simple consequence of the evolution of the universe.

The best current constraint on the post-Newtonian parameter &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; comes from Mercury's perihelion shift and is &lt;math&gt;|\beta-1|&lt;3 \times 10^{-3}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Both constraints show that while the theory is still a potential candidate to replace general relativity, the scalar field must be very weakly coupled in order to explain current observations.

Generalized scalar-tensor theories have also been proposed as explanation for the [[Accelerating expansion of the universe|accelerated expansion of the universe]] but the measurement of the speed of gravity with the gravitational wave event [[GW170817]] has ruled this out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv |title=Challenges to Self-Acceleration in Modified Gravity from Gravitational Waves and Large-Scale Structure |first1=Lucas|last1=Lombriser |first2=Nelson|last2=Lima |arxiv=1602.07670 |class=astro-ph.CO |date=24 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://phys.org/news/2017-02-quest-riddle-einstein-theory.html|title=Quest to settle riddle over Einstein's theory may soon be over|date=February 10, 2017|access-date=October 29, 2017|website=[[phys.org]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://arstechnica.co.uk/science/2017/02/theoretical-battle-dark-energy-vs-modified-gravity/|title=Theoretical battle: Dark energy vs. modified gravity|date=February 25, 2017|access-date=October 27, 2017|website=[[Ars Technica]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ezquiaga|first=Jose María|last2=Zumalacárregui|first2=Miguel|date=2017-12-18|title=Dark Energy After GW170817: Dead Ends and the Road Ahead|url=https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.119.251304|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=119|issue=25|pages=251304|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.119.251304|bibcode=2017PhRvL.119y1304E|arxiv=1710.05901}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Creminelli|first=Paolo|last2=Vernizzi|first2=Filippo|date=2017-12-18|title=Dark Energy after GW170817 and GRB170817A|url=https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.119.251302|journal=Physical Review Letters|volume=119|issue=25|pages=251302|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.119.251302|arxiv=1710.05877|bibcode=2017PhRvL.119y1302C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Higher-dimensional relativity and scalar–tensor theories ==

After the postulation of the [[General Relativity]] of Einstein and Hilbert, [[Theodor Kaluza]] and [[Oskar Klein]] proposed in 1917 a generalization in a 5-dimensional manifold: [[Kaluza–Klein theory]]. This theory possesses a 5-dimensional metric (with a ''compactified and constant 5th metric component, dependent on the ''gauge potential'') and unifies [[gravitation]] and [[electromagnetism]], i.e. there is a geometrization of electrodynamics.

This theory was modified in 1955 by [[P. Jordan]] in his ''Projective Relativity'' theory, in which, following group-theoretical reasonings, Jordan took a functional 5th metric component that lead to a variable gravitational constant ''G''. In his original work, he introduced coupling parameters of the scalar field, to change energy conservation as well, according to the ideas of [[Paul Dirac|Dirac]].

Following the ''Conform Equivalence theory'', multidimensional theories of gravity are ''conform equivalent'' to theories of usual General Relativity in 4 dimensions with an additional scalar field. One case of this is given by Jordan's theory, which, without breaking energy conservation (as it should be valid, following from microwave background radiation being of a black body), is equivalent to the theory of [[Carl H. Brans|C. Brans]] and [[Robert H. Dicke]] of 1961, so that it is usually spoken about the ''Brans–Dicke theory''. The [[Brans–Dicke theory]] follows the idea of modifying Hilbert-Einstein theory to be compatible with [[Mach's principle]]. For this, Newton's gravitational constant had to be variable, dependent of the mass distribution in the universe, as a function of a scalar variable, coupled as a field in the Lagrangian. It uses a scalar field of infinite length scale (i.e. long-ranged), so, in the language of [[Hideki Yukawa|Yukawa]]'s theory of nuclear physics, this scalar field is a ''massless field''. This theory becomes Einsteinian for high values for the parameter of the scalar field.

In 1979, R. Wagoner proposed a generalization of scalar–tensor theories using more than one scalar field coupled to the scalar curvature.

JBD theories although not changing the geodesic equation for test particles, change the motion of composite bodies to a more complex one. The coupling of a universal scalar field directly to the gravitational field gives rise to potentially observable effects for the motion of matter configurations to which gravitational energy contributes significantly. This is known as the "Dicke–Nordtvedt" effect, which leads to possible violations of the Strong as well as the Weak Equivalence Principle for extended masses.

JBD-type theories with short-ranged scalar fields use, according to Yukawa's theory, ''massive scalar fields''. The first of this theories was proposed by A. Zee in 1979. He proposed a Broken-Symmetric Theory of Gravitation, combining the idea of Brans and Dicke with the one of Symmetry Breakdown, which is essential within the [[Standard Model]] SM of [[elementary particles]], where the so-called Symmetry Breakdown leads to mass generation (as a consequence of particles interacting with the Higgs field). Zee proposed the Higgs field of SM as scalar field and so the Higgs field to generate the gravitational constant.

The interaction of the Higgs field with the particles that achieve mass through it is short-ranged (i.e. of Yukawa-type) and gravitational-like (one can get a Poisson equation from it), even within SM, so that Zee's idea was taken 1992 for a scalar–tensor theory with Higgs field as scalar field with Higgs mechanism. There, the massive scalar field couples to the masses, which are at the same time the source of the scalar Higgs field, which generates the mass of the elementary particles through Symmetry Breakdown. For vanishing scalar field, this theories usually go through to standard General Relativity and because of the nature of the massive field, it is possible for such theories that the parameter of the scalar field (the coupling constant) does not have to be as high as in standard JBD theories. Though, it is not clear yet which of these models explains better the phenomenology found in nature nor if such scalar fields are really given or necessary in nature. Nevertheless, JBD theories are used to explain [[cosmic inflation|inflation]] (for massless scalar fields then it is spoken of the inflaton field) after the [[Big Bang]] as well as the [[quintessence (physics)|quintessence]]. Further, they are an option to explain dynamics usually given through the standard [[cold dark matter]] models, as well as [[MOND]], [[Axion]]s (from Breaking of a Symmetry, too), [[MACHOS]],...

== Connection to string theory ==

A generic prediction of all string theory models is that the spin-2 graviton has a spin-0 partner called the [[dilaton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Damour|first=Thibault|author-link=Thibault Damour|last2=Piazza|first2=Federico|last3=Veneziano|first3=Gabriele|author-link3=Gabriele Veneziano|date=2002-08-05|title=Runaway Dilaton and Equivalence Principle Violations|url=https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevLett.89.081601|journal=[[Physical Review Letters]]|volume=89|issue=8|pages=081601|arxiv=gr-qc/0204094|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.89.081601|via=|bibcode=2002PhRvL..89h1601D}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, string theory predicts that the actual theory of gravity is a scalar–tensor theory rather than general relativity. However, the precise form of such a theory is not currently known because one does not have the mathematical tools in order to address the corresponding non-perturbative calculations. Besides, the precise effective 4-dimensional form of the theory is also confronted to the so-called [[String theory landscape|landscape issue]].

[[File:Moll - Map of South America - Detail Potosi.png|thumb|alt=Inset view of Potosí by Bernard Lens from Herman Moll. ''Map of South America''. London: c. 1715.|[[Cerro Rico|Cerro Rico de Potosí]] as depicted in 1715, a possible origin of the Sierra de la Plata myth.]]

The '''Sierra de la Plata''' ("Silver Mountains") was a mythical source of [[silver]] in the interior of [[South America]]. The legend began in the early 16th century when [[castaway]]s from the [[Juan Díaz de Solís]] expedition heard indigenous stories of a mountain of silver in an inland region ruled by the so-called White King. The first European to lead an expedition in search of it was the castaway [[Aleixo Garcia]], who crossed nearly the entire continent to reach the Andean [[altiplano]]. On his way back to the coast, Garcia died in an ambush by indigenous tribespeople in [[Paraguay]], but survivors brought [[precious metal]]s back to corroborate their story. The legend inspired other expeditions, all of which ended in failure.

The [[Río de la Plata]] (literally "Silver River") and the modern country of [[Argentina]] (from the [[Latin language|Latin]] ''argentum'', "silver") both take their names from the myth. The legend of the Sierra de la Plata may have been based on the [[Cerro Rico|Cerro Rico de Potosí]] in [[Bolivia]], which was discovered by a Spanish expedition traveling from [[Peru]] in 1545.

== Origins of the Legend ==

=== Juan Díaz de Solís ===

[[File:Brazil 16thc map.jpg|thumb|Map from the [[Miller Atlas]] (1519) showing the coast of Brazil and the mouths of the [[Amazon River]] and the [[Río de la Plata]].]]

The legend of the White King and the Sierra de la Plata began with the expeditions of [[Juan Díaz de Solís]] along the coast of South America. On his first voyage in 1512,&lt;ref name="Gómara"&gt;López de Gómara, Francisco. ''Historia General de las Indias''. Medina del Campo: 1553; Zaragoza: 1555. [http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/servlet/SirveObras/02588400888014428632268/index.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; Solís followed the coast of [[Brazil]] until he came across an enormous estuary, the Río de la Plata, which [[Amerigo Vespucci]] had named the River Jordan&lt;ref&gt;García Mata, Rafael. "Había un Río Jordan al sur del Nuevo Mundo... y era el Río de la Plata". ''La Nación'' [Buenos Aires, Argentina] 6 May 2001. [http://www.lanacion.com.ar/210790-habia-un-rio-jordan-al-sur-del-nuevo-mundo-y-era-el-rio-de-la-plata]&lt;/ref&gt; on his [[Amerigo Vespucci#First voyage|1501-02 expedition]] and the local inhabitants called Paranaguazu ("river like the sea" or "great water").&lt;ref name="Gómara" /&gt; Solís decided to call it the Mar Dulce ("Freshwater Sea") due to its great size. After exploring the area and guessing it could be a strait connecting the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] to the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]], Solís returned to [[Spain]] to stake his claim as conqueror and governor of the region.&lt;ref name="Gómara" /&gt; In 1516, he returned with the title of Captain General, but when Solís and his party landed on the eastern bank of the Río de la Plata, they were attacked and killed by [[Guaraní people|Guaranís]]. Seeing this, the crew remaining on the ships decided to weigh anchor and return to Spain.&lt;ref name="Gómara" /&gt;

=== Aleixo Garcia ===

On their way back to Europe, one of the Solís expedition's vessels shipwrecked off the coast of [[Santa Catarina Island]] in what is now Brazil, leaving eighteen men stranded. One of them, the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] explorer [[Aleixo Garcia]], became friendly with the local Tupí-Guaranís, and through them learned of a great mountain of shining metals far into the mainland.

Garcia left Santa Catarina along with other castaways and a large indigenous party to search for the Sierra de la Plata, crossing most of South America before reaching the Andean altiplano. This was supposedly the home of the White King, whose throne was entirely decorated with silver. After taking a few valuable pieces, the explorers headed back to the Brazilian coast, but along the way, Aleixo Garcia and the other Europeans were killed in a [[Payaguá people|Payaguá]] ambush. The few Tupí-Guaranís who managed to escape told their story, showing off the silver pieces they had gotten from the realms of the White King.

== Search for Sierra de la Plata ==

=== Sebastian Cabot ===

[[File:Riodelaplatabasinmap.png|thumb|300px|[[Río de la Plata Basin]]]]

In 1526, the [[Venice|Venetian]] explorer [[Sebastian Cabot (explorer)|Sebastian Cabot]] left Spain with the goal of reaching the [[Maluku Islands|Molucca Islands]] in [[Indonesia]] by way of the [[Straits of Magellan]]. During a stopover in [[Pernambuco]] in northern Brazil, he first heard the story about a land rich in precious metals far inland, which could be reached via an enormous estuary further south. The estuary ended up being called the Río de la Plata for its role as the supposed natural gateway to the treasure. The legend captivated Cabot, so he abandoned his mission and decided to find the Sierra de la Plata, assuming that the royal authorities would be indulgent if he found enough silver.

On Santa Catarina, the castaways Melchor Rodríguez and Enrique Morales confirmed the stories, telling Cabot about Aleixo Garcia's expedition and showing him the metals that had been brought back. Cabot headed toward Río de la Plata, where he disembarked to repair two ships that had been damaged in a storm. There, the expedition met former cabin boy [[Francisco del Puerto]], the sole survivor of Solís's landing party. Del Puerto, who was living with the Guaranís, also verified the legend and offered his services as guide and interpreter.

After entering the Río de la Plata, the expedition divided in two: Cabot would continue up the [[Paraná River]] and [[Antón de Grajeda]] would travel up the [[Uruguay River]]. In 1527, at the confluence of the Paraná and [[Carcarañá River|Carcarañá]] Rivers, Cabot established the fort of [[Sancti Spiritu (Argentina)|Sancti Spiritu]], the first European settlement in the [[Río de la Plata basin]], and a future base for expeditions to the land of the White King. The party was suffering from hunger and sickness, and since they could not travel by land, they continued north upriver until they landed at an island they named Año Nuevo ("New Year"). There, they traded colored glass with the [[Timbú people|Timbús]] for food, but Cabot, thinking he had been shortchanged, ordered his men to kill them, burn their homes, and take their food.

In February 1529, they reached an indigenous town they called Santa Ana, where they were treated hospitably, fed well, and told rumors of other "white men" who were coming up the river behind them. Cabot, however, stuck to his plan and continued up the [[Paraguay River]] until strong currents prevented him from going further. There, he had a [[brigantine]] sent ahead under the command of [[Miguel de Rifos]]. Near the confluence of the [[Pilcomayo River]], Rifos decided to disembark with a few men after being welcomed by some indigenous people on the shore. The Europeans headed through the forest to the village, where they were unexpectedly ambushed. Supposedly, it was a trap arranged by the local chief and Del Puerto, who wanted a larger share of the plunder.

Those who had stayed in the brigantine managed to escape, and when they returned to Cabot, he decided to head back to Sancti Spiritu. On the way, he came across [[Diego García de Moguer|Diego García]], the "other white man" he had been told about. García, like Cabot, had been commissioned to travel to the Moluccas, but had deserted when he heard the tales of the White King. After a brief dispute, the two captains decided to join forces to find the Sierra de la Plata, with Cabot in charge of the unified fleet.

At Sancti Spiritu, Captain [[Francisco César]] was chosen to explore the local region together with another fifteen soldiers. Three months later César returned with half of his men and a rumor that nearby was a great city full of riches that from then on would be known as the [[City of the Caesars|Ciudad de los Césares]] ("City of the Caesars").

The Sebastian Cabot expedition ended in failure when Cabot and Diego García made their next attempt to find the Sierra de la Plata. The local indigenous people took advantage of their absence to attack and destroy Fort Sancti Spiritu, killing many of his men. Low on morale, food, and supplies, Cabot and his crew were finally forced to give up their goal and return to Europe.

=== Pedro de Mendoza ===

[[File:Buenos Aires shortly after its foundation 1536.png|thumb|300px|Santa María de los Buenos Ayres, shortly after its foundation in 1536.]]

In 1534, King [[Charles I of Spain|Charles I]] authorized [[Pedro de Mendoza]] to "conquer and populate the lands and provinces around the Solís River, which some call the Plate". With fourteen ships and some 1,200 men, it was at the time the largest and most important expedition that had left Europe for America.&lt;ref name="fundaciones"&gt;Pigna, Felipe. "Fundaciones de Ciudades". ''El Historiador'' [http://www.elhistoriador.com.ar/articulos/conquista_y_colonia/fundaciones_de_ciudades.php]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1536 Pedro de Mendoza founded the port of [[Buenos Aires|Santa María de los Buenos Ayres]], which was probably located in what is now the [[Lezama Park|Parque Lezama]] in Buenos Aires.&lt;ref name="fundaciones" /&gt; Resources were in short supply to support such a population, and after the Spaniards mistreated the local [[Querandí]]s, they stopped supplying food to the settlement. Mendoza decided to send out two fleets in search of food: the first, led by his nephew [[Gonzalo de Mendoza]], headed toward Brazil, and the second, led by [[Juan de Ayolas]], went up the River Paraná with three ships and 270 men. Meanwhile, Mendoza ordered his brother [[Diego de Mendoza (conquistador)|Diego]] to take 300 soldiers and 30 cavalrymen to fight the Querandís. The battle was a failure. Diego de Mendoza was killed, and the Querandís began a long-lasting siege of Buenos Aires. Cut off from supplies, the settlers began to eat their horses and their dead. Finally, the Querandís withdrew, and in a few days, the Juan de Ayolas expedition returned with the news that they had managed to build a fort called Corpus Christi upriver near the modern-day town of [[Gaboto]] and had encountered some indigenous people who talked about the Sierra de la Plata. Pedro de Mendoza decided to travel to the fort with Ayolas and some 400 men.

During the voyage, some 200 men died of sickness and hunger, and once they reached Corpus Christi, Mendoza consulted Cabot's map to find that they were still far from their destination. These major setbacks, along with the [[syphilis]] he had contracted, convinced Mendoza to return to Europe after a short stop in Buenos Aires.

Pedro de Mendoza died on the open sea on June 23, 1537.&lt;ref name="fundaciones" /&gt; Juan de Ayolas, who had left Corpus Christi on October 14, 1536 with a fleet of three brigantines and 170 soldiers, inherited his title of ''[[adelantado]]''. Meanwhile, Buenos Aires had overcome its famine thanks to provisions Gonzalo de Mendoza brought from Brazil, and was left under the provisional command of Captain [[Francisco Ruiz Galán]], who ordered the first planting of corn with the goal of making the fort self-sustainable.

=== Juan de Ayolas ===

[[File:Pilcomayo rio.jpg|thumb|300px|The Pilcomayo river at [[Tarija]], [[Bolivia]].]]

Before Pedro de Mendoza left Buenos Aires, having no news of the Ayolas expedition, he sent [[Juan de Salazar Espinosa]] upriver in search of him. On August 15, 1537, Espinosa established the fort of [[Asunción|Nuestra Señora de la Asunción]] (today Asunción, Paraguay) at the junction of the rivers Paraguay and Pilcomayo.

Meanwhile, Juan de Ayolas was further up the river Paraguay in Payagua territory, where he met one of Aleixo Garcia's former companions, who told him how difficult the journey had been, due to all the gold and silver that weighed them down. Hearing this story, Ayolas decided to found the port of Candelaria on the spot (close to present-day [[Corumbá]]) and commissioned [[Domingo Martínez de Irala]] as provisional Lieutenant Governor until he returned from an overland expedition with 130 soldiers. After a short time, with no news of Ayola, Irala decided to abandon his post and return downriver to the fort of Asunción.

However, the Juan de Ayolas expedition had successfully reached a mountainous area where precious metals were mined. On his return trip, his party suffered losses from skirmishes with indigenous people, and before he reached the Paraguay River, he ordered his men to bury most of the treasure they carried. When he returned, he was disappointed to find the port of Candelaria abandoned, so he accepted the invitation of the Payaguas to rest in their village. On his way there, a fight broke out between the Spaniards and the local people, and almost the entire expedition was killed, including Juan de Ayolas.

After this, Domingo Martínez de Irala became the expedition's new leader, and he took up the goal of conquering the Sierra de la Plata and the lands of the White King. Irala decided to convert Asunción into the headquarters of the conquest, and ordered the colonists at Buenos Aires to tear down their buildings and move to Asunción. However, their newly planted corn was yielding a good crop, and they refused to move. Six months later, Irala disembarked at Buenos Aires to carry out the order. The first settlement at Buenos Aires was finally destroyed and abandoned in 1541.

=== Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca ===

[[File:Iguassu falls rainbow.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Iguazú Falls]] on the border of Argentina and Brazil.]]

While Irala was preparing his expedition to the Sierra de la Plata, Spain had chosen [[Álvar Núñez Cabeza de Vaca]] as the official successor to Pedro de Mendoza's title of ''adelantado''. Known for his long residence among the Indians of modern-day [[Texas]] and northern [[Mexico]], Cabeza de Vaca decided to cross Paraguay on foot rather than travel by boat up the Río de la Plata. In October 1541, his expedition left Santa Catalina, crossing jungles, mountains, and rivers to reach Asunción. In January 1542, they passed [[Iguazú Falls]] and on March 11, 1542, they reached Asunción, where they met Domingo Martínez de Irala.

Cabeza de Vaca clashed with the colonists at Asunción, calling the village a "Moorish paradise," as each colonist had taken multiple indigenous women as wives.

Soon, Cabeza de Vaca began to prepare an expedition to the lands of the White King. First, he sent Irala up the Paraguay River to see if it led to the Sierra de la Plata. He reached [[La Gaiba Lake]] in the [[Pantanal]] region, where he founded the [[Puerto de los Reyes]]. In September 1543, Cabeza de Vaca led his own expedition through the forest, but sickness and clashes with his officers, mostly Irala's men, convinced him to abandon his search and return to Asunción.

With his authority undermined and disliked by the colonists, the Captain General was soon overthrown. On April 25, 1544, Irala's men entered Cabeza de Vaca's house and took him prisoner. Eleven months later, he was sent to Spain on a ship under the command of Gonzalo de Mendoza. During the voyage, a violent storm broke out, which the superstitious sailors interpreted as divine punishment, so they decided to free all of their prisoners. In Spain, Cabeza de Vaca denounced the colonists' actions to the court, but the case was never resolved, and he never returned to the Americas.

=== Domingo Martínez de Irala ===

[[File:El palacio.jpg|thumb|300px|View of modern-day Asunción, Paraguay.]]

With his authority confirmed, [[Domingo Martínez de Irala]] organized an expedition of 300 Spanish men and 3,000 indigenous men in search of the Sierra de la Plata. After a few battles with indigenous peoples, Irala's men reached a tribe of [[Macasí]]s, who immediately began speaking to them in Spanish. They told them their lord was Pedro Anzures, and therefore they were out of their jurisdiction. Irala sent a party to speak with the governor of Peru, [[Pedro de la Gasca]], who only ordered the expedition to go no further under pain of death, so they had no choice but to return to Asunción.

Irala organized several other expeditions to legendary locations like the "Land of Riches", the "Lake of [[El Dorado]]", and "[[Paititi]]". All of these expeditions ended in failure, with great cost in human lives and materials. Meanwhile, the king named [[Juan de Sanabria]] as the new ''adelantado'' in the region, but he died during preparations and was replaced by his son [[Diego de Sanabria|Diego]], who ended up staying in Europe even though several of his ships had already sailed. Finally, the crown decided to formalize Irala's de facto power, so as Irala was preparing his next expedition, a royal emissary arrived in Asunción, informing Irala that he had been named governor of the [[Governorate of New Andalusia]] (also known as the Governorate of the Río de la Plata and Paraguay) with express orders not to lead any more expeditions. With Buenos Aires destroyed and the Sierra de la Plata under another jurisdiction, Paraguay experienced a long period of isolation under Irala, who finally died in October 1556 at the age of 70.

== Cerro Rico de Potosí ==

The Sierra de la Plata legend likely corresponds to the [[Cerro Rico|Cerro Rico de Potosí]] in Bolivia, and the White King to the [[Inca]] [[Huayna Cápac]]. When Aleixo Garcia explored the region and discovered precious metals in the early 16th century, Spain had barely begun colonizing the coasts of Panama and Colombia, and Portugal had barely begun colonizing the coast of Brazil. Neither of the two crowns knew about the existence of the [[Inca Empire]] until [[Francisco Pizarro]] encountered it in 1528, traveling from the Pacific coast. King Charles I tried to solve conflicts between conquistadors by dividing South America into several governorates: [[Governorate of New Castile|New Castile]], under Francisco Pizarro, which reached from the [[Santiago River (Ecuador)|Santiago River]], [[Ecuador]] to [[Pisco]], Peru; [[Governorate of New Toledo|New Toledo]], under [[Diego de Almagro]], from Pisco to [[Taltal]], [[Chile]]; and [[Governorate of New Andalusia|New Andalusia]], under Pedro de Mendoza, two hundred leagues south. Of these three, it was Almagro's men who first found the Cerro Rico de Potosí, leaving New Andalusia without any claim to the Sierra de la Plata.

In 1958, Harvard psychologist [[Herbert Kelman]] identified three broad varieties of social influence.&lt;ref name="Kelman"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kelman, H.|year=1958|title=Compliance, identification, and internalization: Three processes of attitude change|journal=Journal of Conflict Resolution|volume=2|issue=1|pages=51–60|doi=10.1177/002200275800200106|url=http://scholar.harvard.edu/hckelman/files/Compliance_identification_and_internalization.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#'''[[Compliance (psychology)|Compliance]]''' is when people appear to agree with others but actually keep their dissenting opinions private.
#'''[[Identification (psychology)|Identification]]''' is when people are influenced by someone who is liked and respected, such as a famous celebrity.
#'''[[Internalisation (sociology)|Internalization]]''' is when people accept a belief or behavior and agree both publicly and privately.

Morton Deutsch and Harold Gerard described two psychological [[need]]s that lead humans to conform to the expectations of others. These include our need to be right ([[informational social influence]]) and our need to be liked ([[normative social influence]]).&lt;ref name="Gerard"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Deutsch, M.|author2=Gerard, H. B.|lastauthoramp=y|year=1955|title=A study of normative and informational social influences upon individual judgment|journal=Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology|volume=51|issue=3|pages=629–636|pmid=13286010|doi=10.1037/h0046408|url=http://web.comhem.se/u52239948/08/deutsch55.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Informational influence (or ''social proof'') is an influence to accept information from another as evidence about reality. Informational influence comes into play when people are uncertain, either because stimuli are intrinsically ambiguous or because there is social disagreement. Normative influence is an influence to conform to the positive expectations of others. In terms of Kelman's typology, normative influence leads to public compliance, whereas informational influence leads to private acceptance.&lt;ref name=Kelman /&gt;

==Types==
Social influence is a broad term that relates to many different phenomena. Listed below are some major types of social influence that are being researched in the field of [[social psychology]]. For more information, follow the main article links provided.

===Kelman's varieties===
There are three processes of [[attitude change]] as defined by Harvard psychologist [[Herbert Kelman]] in a 1958 paper published in the ''Journal of Conflict Resolution''.&lt;ref name="Kelman" /&gt; The purpose of defining these processes was to help determine the effects of social influence: for example, to separate public conformity (behavior) from private acceptance (personal belief).

====Compliance====
{{Main article|Compliance (psychology)}}
Compliance is the act of responding favorably to an explicit or implicit request offered by others. Technically, compliance is a change in [[behavior]] but not necessarily in [[Attitude (psychology)|attitude;]] one can comply due to mere [[Obedience (human behavior)|obedience]] or by otherwise opting to withhold private thoughts due to social pressures.&lt;ref name="Aronson"&gt;Aronson, Elliot, Timothy D. Wilson, and Robin M. Akert. Social Psychology. Upper Saddle River, NJ: Prentice Hall, 2010. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Kelman's 1958 paper, the satisfaction derived from compliance is due to the social effect of the accepting influence (i.e., people comply for an expected reward or punishment-aversion).&lt;ref name="Kelman" /&gt;

====Identification====
{{Main article|Identification (psychology)}}
Identification is the changing of attitudes or behaviors due to the influence of someone who is admired. [[Advertisements]] that rely upon [[celebrities|celebrity]] endorsements to market their products are taking advantage of this phenomenon. According to Kelman, the desired relationship that the identifier relates to the behavior or attitude change.&lt;ref name="Kelman" /&gt;

====Internalization====
{{Main article|Internalization}}
Internalization is the process of acceptance of a set of norms established by people or groups that are influential to the individual. The individual accepts the influence because the content of the influence accepted is intrinsically rewarding. It is congruent with the individual's value system, and according to Kelman the "reward" of internalization is "the content of the new behavior".&lt;ref name="Kelman" /&gt;

===Conformity===
{{Main article|Conformity}}
Conformity is a type of social influence involving a change in behavior, belief, or thinking to align with those of others or with normative standards. It is the most common and pervasive form of social influence. [[Social psychology]] research in conformity tends to distinguish between two varieties: [[informational social influence|informational conformity]] (also called ''social proof'', or "internalization" in Kelman's terms ) and [[normative social influence|normative conformity]] ("compliance" in Kelman's terms).&lt;ref name="Aronson" /&gt;

In the case of [[peer pressure]], a person is convinced to do something that they might not want to do (such as taking [[illegal drugs]]) but which they perceive as "necessary" to keep a positive [[Interpersonal relationship|relationship]] with other people (such as their [[friend]]s). Conformity from peer pressure generally results from identification with the group members or from compliance of some members to appease others.

Conformity can be in appearance, or may be more complete in nature; impacting an individual both publicly and privately.

Compliance (also referred to as acquiescence) demonstrates a public conformity to a group majority or norm, while the individual continues to privately disagree or dissent, holding on to their original beliefs or to an alternative set of beliefs differing from the majority. Compliance appears as conformity, but there is a division between the public and the private self.

Conversion includes the private acceptance that is absent in compliance. The individual's original behaviour, beliefs, or thinking changes to align with that of others (the influencers), both publicly and privately. The individual has accepted the behavior, belief, or thinking, and has internalized it, making it his own. Conversion may also refer to individual members of a group changing from their initial (and varied) opinions to adopt the opinions of others, which may differ from their original opinions. The resulting group position may be a hybrid of various aspects of individual initial opinions, or it may be an alternative independent of the initial positions reached through consensus.

What appears to be conformity may in fact be congruence. Congruence occurs when an individual's behavior, belief, or thinking is already aligned with that of the others, and no change occurs.

In situations where conformity (including compliance, conversion, and congruence) is absent, there are non-conformity processes such as independence and anti-conformity. Independence, also referred to as dissent, involves an individual (either through their actions or lack of action, or through the public expression of their beliefs or thinking) being aligned with their personal standards but inconsistent with those of other members of the group (either all of the group or a majority). Anti-conformity, also referred to as counter-conformity, may appear as independence, but it lacks alignment with personal standards and is for the purpose of challenging the group. Actions as well as stated opinions and beliefs are often diametrically opposed to that of the group norm or majority. The underlying reasons for this type of behavior may be rebelliousness/obstinacy or it may be to ensure that all alternatives and view points are given due consideration.&lt;ref&gt;Forsyth, D. R. (2010, 2006). Group Dynamics. Belmont: Wadsworth, Cengage Learning.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Minority influence===
{{Main article|Minority influence}}
Minority influence takes place when a majority is influenced to accept the beliefs or behaviors of a minority. Minority influence can be affected by the sizes of majority and minority groups, the level of consistency of the minority group, and situational factors (such as the affluence or social importance of the minority).&lt;ref name="Moscovici"&gt;Moscovici, S. and Nemeth (1974) Minority influence. In C. Nemetn (ed.), Social psychology: Classic and contemporary integrations (pp. 217-249), Chicago:Rand McNally&lt;/ref&gt; Minority influence most often operates through [[informational social influence]] (as opposed to [[normative social influence]]) because the majority may be indifferent to the liking of the minority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Wood, W.|author2=Lundgren, S.|author3=Ouellette, J.|author4=Busceme, S.|author5=Blackstone, T.|year=1994|lastauthoramp=y|title=Minority Influence: A Meta-Analytic Review of Social Influence Processes|journal=Psychological Bulletin|volume=115|number=3|pages=323–345|pmid=8016284|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.115.3.323}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Self-fulfilling prophecy===
{{Main article|Self-fulfilling prophecy}}
A self-fulfilling prophecy is a prediction that directly or indirectly causes itself to become true due to positive feedback between [[belief]] and [[behavior]]. A prophecy declared as truth (when it is actually false) may sufficiently influence people, either through fear or logical confusion, so that their reactions ultimately fulfill the once-false prophecy. This term is credited to [[sociologist]] [[Robert K. Merton]] from an article he published in 1948.&lt;ref name=SFP-48&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reactance===
{{Main article|Reactance (psychology)}}
Reactance is the adoption of a view contrary to the view that a person is being pressured to accept, perhaps due to a perceived threat to behavioral freedoms. This phenomenon has also been called ''anticonformity''. While the results are the opposite of what the influencer intended, the reactive behavior is a result of [[social pressure]].&lt;ref name="Brehm"&gt;Brehm, J. W. (1966). A theory of psychological reactance. Academic Press&lt;/ref&gt; It is notable that anticonformity does not necessarily mean ''independence''. In many studies, reactance manifests itself in a deliberate rejection of an influence, even if the influence is clearly correct.&lt;ref name="Frager"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Frager | first1 = R | year = 1970 | title = Conformity and anti-conformity in Japan | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 15 | issue = | pages = 203–210 | doi=10.1037/h0029434}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Obedience===
{{Main article|Obedience (human behavior)}}
Obedience is a form of social influence that derives from an authority figure. The [[Milgram experiment]], Zimbardo's [[Stanford prison experiment]], and the [[Hofling hospital experiment]] are three particularly well-known experiments on obedience, and they all conclude that humans are surprisingly obedient in the presence of perceived legitimate authority figures.

===Persuasion===
{{Main article|Persuasion}}
Persuasion is the process of guiding oneself or another toward the adoption of an attitude by rational or symbolic means. [[Robert Cialdini]] defined six "weapons of influence": [[norm of reciprocity|reciprocity]], commitment, [[social proof]], [[authority]], liking, and [[scarcity]]. These "weapons of influence" attempt to bring about conformity by directed means. Persuasion can occur through [[Reason|appeals to reason]] or [[Appeal to emotion|appeals to emotion]].&lt;ref name="Cialdini"&gt;Cialdini, Robert B. (2001). ''Influence: Science and practice (4th ed.)''. Boston: Allyn &amp; Bacon. {{ISBN|0-321-01147-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychological manipulation===
{{Main article|Psychological manipulation}}
Psychological manipulation is a type of social influence that aims to change the behavior or [[perception]] of others through [[abuse|abusive]], [[deceptive]], or underhanded tactics.&lt;ref name=braiker&gt;{{Cite book|title=Who's Pulling Your Strings ? How to Break The Cycle of Manipulation |first=Harriet B.|last=Braiker |year=2004 |isbn=0-07-144672-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; By advancing the interests of the manipulator, often at another's expense, such methods could be considered exploitative, abusive, devious, and deceptive.
 
Social influence is not necessarily negative. For example, doctors can try to [[persuade]] patients to change unhealthy habits. Social influence is generally perceived to be harmless when it respects the right of the influenced to accept or reject it, and is not unduly coercive. Depending on the context and motivations, social influence may constitute underhanded manipulation.

===Abusive power and control===
{{Main article|Abusive power and control}}
Controlling abusers use tactics to exert power and control over their victims. The goal of the abuser is to control and [[intimidate]] the victim or to influence them to feel that they do not have an equal voice in the relationship.&lt;ref name="Cory p. 30"&gt;Jill Cory; Karen McAndless-Davis. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=qBFdlUnxmkkC&amp;pg=PA30 When Love Hurts: A Woman's Guide to Understanding Abuse in Relationships]''. WomanKind Press; 1 January 2000. {{ISBN|978-0-9686016-0-0}}. p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Propaganda===
{{Main article|Propaganda}}
Propaganda is information that is not [[Objectivity (journalism)|objective]] and is used primarily to influence an audience and further an agenda, often by presenting facts selectively to encourage a particular synthesis or perception, or using [[loaded language]] to produce an emotional rather than a rational response to the information that is presented.&lt;ref name="brit_BLS"&gt;{{cite web | last = Smith | first = Bruce L. | author-link = Bruce Lannes Smith | title = Propaganda | website = britannica.com | publisher = [[Encyclopædia Britannica|Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc.]] | date = 17 February 2016 | url = http://www.britannica.com/topic/propaganda | access-date = 23 April 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hard power===
{{Main article|Hard power}}
Hard power is the use of [[military]] and [[economics|economic]] means to influence the behavior or interests of other political bodies. This form of [[political power]] is often aggressive ([[coercion]]), and is most effective when imposed by one political body upon another of lesser military and/or economic power.&lt;ref name=hard&gt;{{cite web|title=Hard Power Vs. Soft Power|url=http://www.themarknews.com/articles/895-hard-power-vs-soft-power|publisher=The Mark|accessdate=26 April 2012|author=Daryl Copeland|date=Feb 2, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120501050956/http://www.themarknews.com/articles/895-hard-power-vs-soft-power|archivedate=1 May 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hard power contrasts with [[soft power]], which comes from [[diplomacy]], [[culture]] and [[history]].&lt;ref name=hard/&gt;

== Antecedents ==
Many factors can affect the impact of social influence.

===Social impact theory===
{{Main article|Social impact theory}}
Social impact theory was developed by [[Bibb Latané]] in 1981. This theory asserts that there are three factors which increase a person's likelihood to respond to social influence:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Latané | first1 = B | year = 1981 | title = The psychology of social impact | doi = 10.1037/0003-066x.36.4.343 | journal = American Psychologist | volume = 36 | issue = | pages = 343–356 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*''Strength'': The importance of the influencing group to the individual
*''Immediacy'': Physical (and temporal) proximity of the influencing group to the individual at the time of the influence attempt
*''Number'': The number of people in the group

===Cialdini's "weapons of influence"===
[[Robert Cialdini]] defines six "weapons of influence" that can contribute to an individual's propensity to be influenced by a persuader:&lt;ref name="Cialdini" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://conceptually.org/concepts/6-principles-of-influence/ |title=What are the 6 principles of influence? |website=conceptually.org |access-date= October 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[norm of reciprocity|Reciprocity]]: People tend to return a favor.
*[[Promise|Commitment]] and [[consistency]]: People do not like to be self-contradictory. Once they commit to an idea or behavior, they are averse to changing their minds without good reason.
*[[Social proof]]: People will be more open to things that they see others doing. For example, seeing others compost their organic waste after finishing a meal may influence the subject to do so as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Sussman, R.|author2=Gifford, R.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2013|title=Be the Change You Want to See: Modeling Food Composting in Public Places|journal=Environment &amp; Behavior|volume=45|issue=3|pages=323–343|DOI=10.1177/0013916511431274}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Authority]]: People will tend to obey authority figures.
*Liking: People are more easily swayed by people they like.
*[[Scarcity]]: A perceived limitation of resources will generate demand.

===Unanimity===
Social Influence is strongest when the group perpetrating it is consistent and committed. Even a single instance of dissent can greatly wane the strength of an influence. For example, in Milgram's first set of [[Milgram experiment|obedience experiments]], 65% of participants complied with fake authority figures to administer "maximum shocks" to a confederate. In iterations of the Milgram experiment where three people administered shocks (two of whom were confederates), once one confederate disobeyed, only ten percent of subjects administered the maximum shocks.&lt;ref name=ObedStudy&gt;{{cite journal|last=Milgram |first=Stanley |year=1963 |title=Behavioral Study of Obedience |journal=Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology |volume=67 |issue=4 |pages=371–378 |pmid=14049516 |url=http://content.apa.org/journals/abn/67/4/371 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120717013242/http://content.apa.org/journals/abn/67/4/371 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-07-17 |doi=10.1037/h0040525 }} [http://www.garfield.library.upenn.edu/classics1981/A1981LC33300001.pdf Full-text PDF.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611105753/http://www.garfield.library.upenn.edu/classics1981/A1981LC33300001.pdf |date=June 11, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Status ===
{{Main article|Appeal to authority}}
{{See also|Reputation}}
Those perceived as [[experts]] may exert social influence as a result of their perceived expertise. This involves [[credibility]], a tool of social influence from which one draws upon the notion of trust. People believe an individual to be credible for a variety of reasons, such as perceived experience, attractiveness, knowledge, etc. Additionally, pressure to maintain one's reputation and not be viewed as fringe may increase the tendency to agree with the group. This phenomenon is known as [[groupthink]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/05/books/05deba.html?scp=5&amp;sq=Shiller%20groupthink&amp;st=cse Ivory Tower Unswayed by Crashing Economy]. ''New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt; Appeals to authority may especially affect norms of [[Obedience (human behavior)|obedience]]. The compliance of normal humans to authority in the famous [[Milgram experiment]] demonstrate the [[Power (social and political)|power]] of perceived authority.

Those with access to the media may use this access in an attempt to influence the public. For example, a politician may use speeches to persuade the public to support issues that he or she does not have the power to impose on the public. This is often referred to as using the "[[bully pulpit]]." Likewise, celebrities don't usually possess any political power, but they are familiar to many of the world's citizens and, therefore, possess [[social status]].

Power is one of the biggest reasons an individual feels the need to follow through with the suggestions of another. A person who possesses more authority (or is perceived as being more powerful) than others in a group is an icon or is most "popular" within a group. This person has the most influence over others. For example, in a child's school life, people who seem to control the perceptions of the students at school are most powerful in having a social influence over other children.&lt;ref&gt;C. Mugny; L Souchet; C Codaccioni; A Quiamzade (2008). Social Representation and Social Influence. 53 (2), pg 223-237.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Culture ===

[[Culture]] appears to play a role in the willingness of an individual to conform to the standards of a group. [[Stanley Milgram]] found that conformity was higher in [[Norway]] than in [[France]].&lt;ref&gt;Blass, T. (2004). The man who shocked the world: The life and legacy of Stanley Milgram. New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt; This has been attributed to Norway's longstanding tradition of social responsibility, compared to France's cultural focus on individualism. Japan likewise has a collectivist culture and thus a higher propensity to conformity. However, a 1970 [[Asch conformity experiments|Asch-style study]] found that when alienated, Japanese students were more susceptible to ''anticonformity'' (giving answers that were ''incorrect'' even when the group had collaborated on ''correct'' answers) one third of the time, significantly higher than has been seen in Asch studies in the past.&lt;ref name="Frager" /&gt;

While [[gender]] does not significantly affect a person's likelihood to conform, under certain conditions  [[gender roles]] do affect such a likelihood. Studies from the 1950s and 1960s concluded that women were more likely to conform than men. But a 1971 study found that [[experimenter bias]] was involved; all of the researchers were male, while all of the research participants were female. Studies thereafter found that the likelihood to conform almost equal between the genders. Furthermore, men conformed more often when faced with traditionally feminine topics, and women conformed more often when presented with masculine topics. In other words, ignorance about a subject can lead a person to defer to [[informational social influence|"social proof"]].&lt;ref&gt;Sistrunk, Frank; McDavid, John W.; Journal of Personality and Social Psychology, Vol 17(2), Feb, 1971. pp. 200-207.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Emotions ===
{{Main article|Appeal to emotion}}
Emotion and disposition may affect an individual's likelihood of conformity or anticonformity.&lt;ref name="Brehm" /&gt; In 2009, a study concluded that fear increases the chance of agreeing with a group, while romance or lust increases the chance of going against the group.&lt;ref&gt;EurekAlert. (2009). [http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2009-03/uom-for032309.php Fear or romance could make you change your mind, U of Minnesota study finds].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social structure ==

===Social networks===
{{Main article|Social network analysis}}
A [[social network]] is a [[social structure]] made up of nodes (representing individuals or organizations) which are connected (through ''ties'', also called ''edges'', ''connections'', or ''links'') by one or more types of interdependency (such as friendship, common interests or beliefs, sexual relations, or kinship). [[Social network analysis]] uses the lens of [[network theory]] to examine [[social relationships]]. Social network analysis as a field has become more prominent since the mid-20th century in determining the channels and effects of social influence. For example, [[Nicholas A. Christakis|Christakis]] and [[James H. Fowler|Fowler]] found that social networks transmit states and behaviors such as obesity,&lt;ref name="content.nejm.org"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Christakis | first1 = N.A. | last2 = Fowler | first2 = J.H. | year = 2007 | title = The Spread of Obesity in a Large Social Network Over 32 Years | url = | journal = New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 357 | issue = 4| pages = 370–379 | doi=10.1056/nejmsa066082 | pmid=17652652}}&lt;/ref&gt; smoking,&lt;ref name="J.H.

Identifying the extent of social influence, based on large-scale observational data with a latent [[social network]] structure, is pertinent to a variety of collective social phenomena including [[crime]], [[civil disorder|civil unrest]], and [[voting behavior]] in elections. For example, methodologies for disentangling social influence by peers from external influences—with latent social network structures and large-scale observational data—were applied to US presidential elections,&lt;ref&gt;Braha, D., &amp; de Aguiar, M. A. (2016). [https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.04406 Voting Contagion]. arXiv preprint arXiv:1610.04406.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Braha, D., &amp; de Aguiar, M. A. (2017).

[[Image:USMC-110507-M-GR773-089.jpg|right|thumb|These two teams of young [[soccer]] ([[football]]) players line up and high-five after a game to learn about good sportsmanship]]

'''Sportsmanship''' is an aspiration or ethos that a [[sport]] or activity will be enjoyed for its own sake, with proper consideration for [[wikt:fairness|fairness]], [[ethics]], [[respect]], and a sense of [[fellow]]ship with one's competitors. A "sore loser" refers to one who does not take defeat well, whereas a "good sport" means being a "good winner" as well as being a "good loser"&lt;ref&gt;See, ''e.g.'', Joel Fish and Susan Magee, ''101 Ways to Be a Terrific Sports Parent'', p. 168. Fireside, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;David Lacey, [http://blogs.guardian.co.uk/sport/2007/11/10/it_takes_a_bad_loser_to_become.html "It takes a bad loser to become a good winner."] ''The Guardian'', November 10, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; (someone who shows courtesy towards another in a sports game).

== Analysis ==

Sportsmanship can be conceptualized as an enduring and relatively stable characteristic or disposition such that individuals differ in the way they are generally expected to behave in sports situations. In general, sportsmanship refers to virtues such as fairness, self-control, courage, and persistence,&lt;ref name="Shields &amp; Bredemeier, 1995"&gt;Shields &amp; Bredemeier, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; and has been associated with interpersonal concepts of treating others and being treated fairly, maintaining self-control if dealing with others, and respect for both authority and opponents. Sportsmanship is also looked at as being the way one 
reacts to a sport/game/player.

The four elements of sportsmanship are often shown being good form, the will to win, equity and fairness. All four elements are critical and a balance must be found among all four for true sportsmanship to be illustrated.&lt;ref name="abad" /&gt; These elements may also cause conflict, as a person may desire to win more than play in equity and fairness and thus resulting in a clash within the aspects of sportsmanship. This will cause problems as the person believes they are being a good sportsman, but they are defeating the purpose of this idea as they are ignoring two key components of being sportsman like. When athletes become too self-centred, the idea of sportsmanship is dismissed.&lt;ref name="ahola"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/07303084.2006.10597902|title =Promoting Sportsmanship in Youth Sports|last1 = Goldstein |first1=Jay|last2=Iso-Ahola |first2 = Seppo|date = 2006|journal =Journal of Physical Education, Recreation &amp; Dance|doi = 10.1080/07303084.2006.10597902|issue = 7|volume = 77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today's sporting culture, in particular the base of elite sport, places great importance on the idea of competition and winning and thus sportsmanship takes a back seat as a result.&lt;ref name="ahola" /&gt; In most, if not all sports, sportsmen at the elite level make the standards on sportsmanship and no matter whether they like it or not, they are seen as leaders and role models in society.&lt;ref name="clifford"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Ken |last=Clifford |journal=Newcastle Herald |date=2013 |title=Sport's also about sportsmanship |volume=1 |issue=33 |url=http://bv8ja7kw5x.search.serialssolutions.com/?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;ctx_enc=info%3Aofi%2Fenc%3AUTF-8&amp;rfr_id=info:sid/summon.serialssolutions.com&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.atitle=Sport%27s+also+about+sportsmanship&amp;rft.jtitle=Newcastle+Herald&amp;rft.au=KEN+CLIFFORD&amp;rft.date=2013-12-10&amp;rft.pub=Fairfax+Digital&amp;rft.issn=0727-9825&amp;rft.spage=33&amp;rft.externalDocID=3149922301&amp;paramdict=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since every sport is rule driven, the most common offence of bad sportsmanship is the act of cheating or breaking the rules to gain an unfair advantage this is called [[unsportsmanlike conduct]].&lt;ref name="feez"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00948705.1986.9714436|title = Sportsmanship|last = Feezell|first = Randolph|date = 1986|journal = Journal of the Philosophy of Sport|doi = 10.1080/00948705.1986.9714436|issue = 1|volume = 13}}&lt;/ref&gt; A competitor who exhibits poor sportsmanship after losing a game or contest is often called a "sore loser", while a competitor who exhibits poor sportsmanship after winning is typically called a "bad winner". Sore loser behavior includes blaming others for the loss, not accepting responsibility for personal actions that contributed to the defeat, reacting to the loss in an immature or improper fashion, [[rationalization (psychology)|making excuses]] for the defeat, and citing unfavorable conditions or other petty issues as reasons for the defeat.&lt;ref&gt;"MJD", [https://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/blog/shutdown_corner/post/If-he-s-going-to-lose-Bill-Belichick-would-rath?urn=nfl,64971 "If he's going to lose, Bill Belichick would rather be elsewhere"].

Not showing respect to the other team is considered to being a bad sportsman and could lead to demoralising effects; as Leslie Howe describes: "If a pitcher in baseball decides to pitch not to his maximum ability suggest that the batter is not at an adequate level, [it] could lead to the batter to have low self-confidence or worth."&lt;ref name="howe"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00948705.2004.9714661|title =Gamesmanship|last = Howe|first = Leslie|date = 2008|journal = Journal of the Philosophy of Sport|doi = 10.1080/00948705.2004.9714661|issue = 2|volume = 31 |pp=212–225}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are six different categories relating to sportsmanship: the elements of sports, the elements of sportsmanship, clarifications, conflicts, balance and irreducibility.&lt;ref name="abad" /&gt; All six of these characterize a person with good sportsmanship. Even though there is some affinity between some of the categories, they are distinct elements.&lt;ref name="abad"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.tandfonline.com.ipacez.nd.edu.au/doi/full/10.1080/17511320903365227#abstract|title = Sportsmanship|last = Abad|first = Diana|date = 2010|journal = Sport, Ethics and Philosophy|doi = 10.1080/17511320903365227|issue = 1|volume = 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; "In essence, play has for its directed and immediate end joy, pleasure, and delights and which is dominated by a spirit of moderation and generosity.

(Feelezz, 1896, pp.&amp;nbsp;3) Hence, the virtues of a player are radically different from the virtues of an athlete. (Feelezz, 1896, pp.&amp;nbsp;3). When talking about misunderstanding sportsmanship, Rudd and Stoll (2013) provide an example from 1995, a U.S. high school athletic league banned the post-game handshake that was a part of sports such as football and basketball. The handshaking was banned because of fights that were ensuing after the handshake.(pp.&amp;nbsp;41) Most players are influenced by the leaders around them such as coaches and older players, ''if there are coaches and administrators who don't understand sportsmanship, then what about the players?''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.tandfonline.com.ipacez.nd.edu.au/doi/pdf/10.1080/07303084.1998.10605629|title = Understanding Sportsmanship|last = Rudd; Stoll|first = Andrew; Sharon K|date = 2013|journal = Journal of Education, Recreation &amp; Dance|p=41|doi = 10.1080/07303084.1998.10605629|volume = 69|issue = 9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
[[File:Sportmanship sculpture.jpg|thumb|A moment of sportmanship when [[John Landy]] helped [[Ron Clarke]] get up after he had fallen.]]

There are various ways that sportsmanship is practiced in different sports. Being a good sport often includes treating others as you would also like to be treated, cheer for good plays (even if it is made by the opposition), accept responsibility for your mistakes, and keep your perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bachel|first1=Beverly|title=Scoring big: It's not whether you win or lose, it's how you play|journal=Current Health 2, a Weekly Reader Publication|date=2009|volume=35|issue=7|pages=16–20|url=http://bv8ja7kw5x.search.serialssolutions.com/?ctx_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;ctx_enc=info%3Aofi%2Fenc%3AUTF-8&amp;rfr_id=info:sid/summon.serialssolutions.com&amp;rft_val_fmt=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:journal&amp;rft.genre=article&amp;rft.atitle=Scoring+big%3A+it%27s+not+whether+you+win+or+lose%2C+it%27s+how+you+play&amp;rft.jtitle=Current+Health+2%2C+a+Weekly+Reader+publication&amp;rft.au=Bachel%2C+Beverly&amp;rft.date=2009-03-01&amp;rft.pub=Weekly+Reader+Corp&amp;rft.issn=0163-156X&amp;rft.volume=35&amp;rft.issue=7&amp;rft.spage=16&amp;rft.externalDBID=n%2Fa&amp;rft.externalDocID=194620867&amp;paramdict=en-US|accessdate=April 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of treating others how you would like to be treated would include being respectful and polite to other team members and the opposition because in return you would also like to be treated the same way.&lt;ref name="clifford" /&gt; Cheer for good plays could include if in netball a player of the opposition made a good lead for the ball, which then resulted in a goal, everyone would either clap or make a supportive comment to acknowledge that what the player did was very well done. To accept responsibility for your mistakes will entail not placing the blame on other people.&lt;ref name="feez" /&gt;

Some popular examples of good sportsmanship include shaking hands, help an opponent who may have fallen over, encourage everyone, cheer, clap or hi-five, and be respectful to everyone including teammates, the opposition, parents and officials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Josephson|first1=Michael|title=Ethics and sportsmanship (part I)|url=https://charactercounts.org/sports/Olympic/olympic-report-ethicssportsmanship.htm|website=Pursuing Victory with Honor|accessdate=April 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most importantly it is often encouraged and said regarding sportsmanship that "It's not whether you win or lose, it's how you play the game."&lt;ref name="feez" /&gt;

Sportsmanship can be manifested in different ways depending on the game itself or the culture of the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bigthink.com/ideafeed/concepts-of-sportsmanship-vary-across-cultures|title=Concepts of Sportsmanship Vary Across Cultures|first=Dustin|last=Petzold|date=|website=bigthink.com|accessdate=April 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contributing factors ==

Sportsmanship can be affected by a few contributing factors such as the players' values and attitudes towards the sport and also the professional role models that are shown to the public. Role models in sport are expected to act in a moral and respectful way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jones|first1=Carwyn|title=Drunken role models: Rescuing our sporting exemplars|journal=Sport, Ethics and Philosophy|date=2011|volume=5|issue=4|pages=414–432|doi=10.1080/17511321.2011.561254}}&lt;/ref&gt; When elite sporting role models do not encourage sportsmanship this can also encourage people in society to act in similar ways to the athletes that they look up to and idolize. For example, if an individual looked up to an athlete who was drinking excessively, they may see this as acceptable behavior.&lt;ref name="ahola" /&gt; The direct correlation between sportsmanship and leadership is also considered to be another contributing factor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wells|first1=M. S.|title=Creating an environment for sportsmanship outcomes: A systems perspective|journal=Journal of Physical Education, Recreation &amp; Dance|date=2006|volume=77|issue=7|pages=1–58}}&lt;/ref&gt; Having a positive environment in your sporting team will therefore create good sportsmanship from the individuals. Having a positive leadership by the captains, coaches and supporters would then encourage a positive sporting environment.&lt;ref name="ahola" /&gt;

'''Tonya Maxene Price''' (née '''Harding'''; born November 12, 1970) is a retired American [[figure skating|figure skater]].

A native of [[Portland, Oregon]], Harding was raised primarily by her mother, who enrolled her in ice skating lessons beginning at age four. Harding would spend much of her early life training, eventually dropping out of high school to devote her time to the sport. After climbing the ranks in the [[U.S. Figure Skating Championships]] between 1986 and 1989, Harding won the 1989 [[Skate America]] competition. She was the 1991 and 1994 U.S. champion before being stripped of her 1994 title, and 1991 [[1991 World Figure Skating Championships|World silver medalist]]. In 1991, she earned distinction as being the first American woman to successfully land a triple [[Axel jump|Axel]] in competition, and the second woman to do so in history (behind [[Midori Ito]]). She is also a two-time Olympian and a two-time Skate America Champion.

In January 1994, Harding became embroiled in controversy when her ex-husband, Jeff Gillooly, orchestrated an attack on fellow US Olympian [[Nancy Kerrigan]]. After the [[1994 Winter Olympics]], Harding ultimately pleaded guilty to hindering the prosecution on March 16 and was banned for life on June 30, 1994 from the [[U.S. Figure Skating Association]].

In the early 2000s, Harding competed as a [[professional boxer]], and her life has been the subject of numerous films, documentaries, books, and academic studies. In 2014, two [[Television documentary|documentary television films]] about Harding's life and skating career (''Nancy &amp; Tonya'' and ''The Price of Gold'') were aired within two months of each other — inspiring [[Steven Rogers (screenwriter)|Steven Rogers]] to write the [[Black comedy|darkly comedic]] [[biographical film]] ''[[I, Tonya]]'', released in 2017 and starring [[Margot Robbie]] as Harding. In 2018, she was a contestant on [[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. season 26)|season 26]] of ''[[Dancing with the Stars (U.S. TV series)|Dancing with the Stars]]'', finishing in third place.

== Early life ==
[[File:Ice chalet lloyd center portland oregon lec by andrew parodi.jpeg|thumb|Right|Ice Chalet at Portland's [[Lloyd Center]], where Harding began skating at age four]]

Tonya Maxene Harding was born on November 12, 1970, in Portland, Oregon, to LaVona Golden and Albert Gordon Harding (1933–2009).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.tillamookheadlightherald.com/obituaries/albert-gordon-harding/article_fbf7f286-1e22-5e3d-8d4b-3c27f9952c35.html |title=Albert Gordon Harding |newspaper=Headlight-Herald|date=2009-04-14| accessdate=2018-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was raised in [[East Portland, Oregon|East Portland]], and began skating at age three, training with coach Diane Rawlinson. During her youth, Harding also hunted, drag raced, and learned automotive mechanics from her father. LaVona struggled to support the family while working as a waitress, and hand-sewed her daughter's skating costumes as they could not afford to purchase them. Harding's parents divorced after 19 years of marriage in 1987, when she was 16 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=dpNODgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=They%20divorced%20in%201987|url-access=subscription|last1=Prouse|first1=Lynda D.|last2=Harding|first2=Tonya|title=The Tonya Tapes|year=2008|page=40|access-date=2018-08-03|quote=[My parents] divorced in 1987.

According to Harding, she was frequently abused by her mother. She stated that by the time she was seven years old, both physical and psychological abuse had become a regular part of her life. LaVona admitted to one instance of hitting Harding at an ice rink.&lt;ref name="Oprah Sk Sc"&gt;{{cite web |website=Oprah.com |url=http://www.oprah.com/world/Tonya-Hardings-Figure-Skating-Scandal/5 |title=Tonya Harding's Skating Scandal |access-date=2016-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2018, Harding's childhood friend and filmmaker, Sandra Luckow, spoke in defence of Harding's mother because she felt that the 2017 film ''I, Tonya'' stretched some truths about LaVona's character. Luckow said that although Harding's mother could be "egregious" towards her daughter, LaVona actually funded and appreciated Harding's skating lessons – and had "a huge amount of humanity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://people.com/movies/tonya-harding-mother-monster-friend/|first=Ale|last=Russian|title=Was Tonya Harding's Mom Really a Monster?

In Harding's 2008 authorized biography, ''The Tonya Tapes'' (written by Lynda D. Prouse from recorded interviews she had with Harding), she revealed she was the victim of acquaintance rape in 1991&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=dpNODgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=I%20never%20told%20anybody%20because%20I%20knew%20the%20person|url-access=subscription|last1=Prouse|first1=Lynda D.|last2=Harding|first2=Tonya|title=The Tonya Tapes|year=2008|pages=125; 132|access-date=July 31, 2018|quote=I was separated from Jeff [at the] time in '91.

In 1986, Harding called the police after Davison had been sexually harassing and terrorizing her. He was arrested and spent a short time in prison. Harding claimed that her parents were in denial about Davison's behavior and told her not to press criminal charges against him. Davison was killed in a 1988 unsolved vehicular hit-and-run accident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=dpNODgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=.And%20my%20mother%20and%20father%20came%20home%20and%20said%20I%20was|url-access=subscription|last1=Prouse|first1=Lynda D.|last2=Harding|first2=Tonya|title=The Tonya Tapes|year=2008|pages=57–62|access-date=July 30, 2018|quote=[The police] ended up arresting [Davison]...And my mother and father came home and said I was [lying about the harassment].}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Not Your Average Ice Queen"&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://www.si.com/vault/1992/01/13/125774/not-your-average-ice-queen-a-troubled-past-hasnt-stopped-tonya-harding-from-becoming-a-figure-skating-champion|title=Not Your Average Ice Queen|magazine=Sports Illustrated|date=Jan 13, 1992|accessdate=2018-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 3, 1994, during an interview with [[Rolonda Watts]], Harding said that Chris Davison was the lone person in her life unworthy of forgiveness and "the only person I've ever hated."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://variety.com/1994/tv/news/rolonda-first-talker-to-nab-tonya-interview-120020/|title='Rolonda' first talker to nab Tonya interview|last=Flint|first=Joe|magazine=Variety|date=April 8, 1994|accessdate=2018-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=95rjRhjESUg&amp;t=1012s Rolonda Watts' Interview with Tonya Harding].

== Skating career ==
Harding trained as a figure skater throughout her youth with coach Diane Rawlinson. In the mid-1980s, she began working her way up the competitive skating ladder. She placed sixth at the 1986 U.S. Figure Skating Championships, fifth in 1987 and 1988, and third in 1989.

Harding's breakthrough year came in 1991 when, at the [[1991 United States Figure Skating Championships|U.S. Championships]], she completed her first [[triple Axel]] in competition on February 16 — the first American woman to execute the jump.&lt;ref name=nyt910312&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/12/sports/figure-skating-a-triple-axel-with-rippling-effects.html |title=A Triple Axel With Rippling Effects |first=Michael |last=Janofsky |newspaper=New York Times |date=March 12, 1991|accessdate=2017-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; She won the 1991 U.S. Ladies' Singles title with the event's first 6.0 technical merit score since [[Janet Lynn]]'s 1973 performance at the U.S. Championships.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt; At the March 1991 World Championships, an international event, she again completed the triple Axel.

At the September [[1991 Skate America]] competition, Harding recorded three more firsts:
* The first woman to complete a triple Axel in the short program
* The first woman to successfully execute two triple Axels in a single competition
* The first ever to complete a triple Axel in combination (with the double [[toe loop]])

Despite these record-breaking performances, after 1991, Harding was never able to successfully complete the triple Axel in competition again; her competitive results began to decline. She and Dody Teachman had briefly parted ways in April 1991, but had reunited in June;&lt;ref name="Not Your Average Ice Queen" /&gt; Harding was still training under Teachman for the upcoming 1992 season.

In 1994, Harding won the U.S. Championships, but was later stripped of her title because of her involvement in the attack on Nancy Kerrigan.

== Attack on Nancy Kerrigan and aftermath ==

On {{start date|1994|1|6}}, one day before the [[1994 United States Figure Skating Championships|U.S. Figure Skating Championship]] first Ladies' Singles competition, [[Nancy Kerrigan]] was attacked after a practice session at the Detroit [[Cobo Center|Cobo Arena]]. The assailant was Shane Stant, contracted to break her right leg.&lt;ref name="anatomy of plot"/&gt; Stant and his uncle, Derrick Smith, were hired for this [[assault]] by Harding's ex-husband, Jeff Gillooly, and her one-time bodyguard, Shawn Eckardt.&lt;ref&gt;[https://sportsworld.nbcsports.com/nancy-tonya/].

Tonya telling a reporter "Shawn is my bodyguard" while he walks beside her on January 10, 1994 - time code ca 0:29:14&lt;/ref&gt; After failing to find Kerrigan at her Massachusetts training rink, Stant had taken a 20-hour bus trip to Detroit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/23/sports/figure-skating-traveling-far-and-lying-low-to-get-nancy-kerrigan.html|title=Traveling Far and Lying Low to Get Nancy Kerrigan|work=New York Times|first=Joseph B. |last=Treaster|date=Jan 23, 1994|accessdate=2018-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nancy Kerrigan was walking behind a curtain to a corridor when Stant rushed behind her. Using both hands, he then swung a 21-inch [[ASP, Inc.|ASP]] [[telescopic baton]] at her right leg, striking her above the knee. The intent was preventing her competing in both the National Championships (Kerrigan was the defending [[1993 U.S. Figure Skating Championships|1993 U.S. Ladies' Champion]]) and the Winter Olympics. Kerrigan's leg was not broken but severely bruised, forcing her to withdraw from the Championships and forgo competing to retain the U.S. Ladies' title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/01/07/sports/figure-skating-kerrigan-attacked-after-practice-assailant-flees.html|title=Kerrigan Attacked After Practice; Assailant Flees

On March 21, 1994, a Portland grand jury issued an indictment stating there was evidence Harding participated in the attack plot.

Smith then interviewed Kerrigan, asking how she responded to that statement.  Nancy Kerrigan referred to transcripts she had read from Harding's FBI interview on January 18, 1994.

In Harding's 2008 biography, ''The Tonya Tapes'' (transcribed by Lynda D.

In 2002, Harding boxed against [[Paula Jones]] on the [[Fox Network|Fox TV network]] ''[[Celebrity Boxing]]'' event, winning the fight. On February 22, 2003, she made her official [[women's boxing|women's professional boxing]] debut, losing a four-round [[split decision]] against Samantha Browning on the undercard of [[Mike Tyson vs. Clifford Etienne]]. Harding's boxing career came about amid rumors that she was having financial difficulties and needed to fight in the ring to earn money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Tonya Harding Loses in Pro Boxing Debut |url=http://www.ourmidland.com/news/article/Tonya-Harding-Loses-in-Pro-Boxing-Debut-7070027.php |first=Barry |last=Wilner |date=Feb 21, 2003 |newspaper=Midland Daily News}}&lt;/ref&gt; She did another celebrity boxing match, on ''[[The Man Show]]'', and won against co-host [[Doug Stanhope]].

On March 23, 2004, it was reported that she canceled a planned boxing match against Tracy Carlton in [[Oakland, California]], because of an alleged death threat against her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Why Harding wasn't in bout / Manager cites death threats, skills of foe |url=http://www.sfgate.com/sports/article/Why-Harding-wasn-t-in-bout-Manager-cites-death-2777303.php

On June 24, 2004, after reportedly not having boxed for over a year, she was beaten in a match in [[Edmonton]], Alberta, by Amy Johnson. Fans reportedly booed her as she entered the ring and cheered wildly for Johnson when she won in the third round.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Harding takes pounding|url=https://www.news24.com/xArchive/Sport/MoreSport/Tonya-Harding-takes-pounding-20040626 |website=News24.com|date=2004-06-26|accessdate=2017-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Academic assessment ===
Because Harding admitted to obstructing the investigation of Nancy Kerrigan's assault, her name is often first associated with the 1994 scandal. However, numerous academic essays have theorized additional reasons, particularly considering her [[Social class in the United States|national class culture]] and past figure skating membership, for Harding's perceived [[social stigma]]tization.&lt;ref name= believermag.com&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Marshall |first=Sarah |url=https://believermag.com/remote-control/ |title=Remote Control: Tonya Harding, Nancy Kerrigan, and the Spectacles of Female Power &amp; Pain |magazine=The Believer|date=Jan 2014|accessdate=2017-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, the book ''Women on Ice: Feminist Essays on the Tonya Harding/Nancy Kerrigan Spectacle'' was published, containing numerous essays analyzing Harding's public image.{{sfn|Baughman|2013|pages=i–v}} For example, Abigail Feder-Kane wrote that there existed "[[Overdetermination|overdetermined]] [[femininity]] in Ladies' Figure Skating...femininity and [[Women's sports|athleticism]] are mutually exclusive concepts in [[Culture of the United States|American culture]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Oates|first=Thomas P.|editor-last=Burns|editor-first=Gary|year=2016|title=A Companion to Popular Culture (Blackwell Companions in Cultural Studies)|url-access=subscription|pages=275; 282|chapter=Part 5: Pastimes &amp; Practices|department=Sports: Marketing of the Black Style &amp; Containing Gendered Threats|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=P2jWCgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=abigail%20feder-kane|isbn=9781405192057|oclc=959326257|ref=harv|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd|access-date=Aug 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sam Stoloff believed that, during the scandal, the media placed a greater emphasis on Harding's [[Working class in the United States|class]] rather than her gender (femininity). He noted how she was subjected to a "litany of vaguely [[pejorative]] or mocking expressions" associated with "low class" cultural attributes, sometimes due to Harding's personal interests and hobbies. Stoloff theorized that Harding represented an American social class that required interpretation ("the class Other") as he referenced the [[Anthropology|anthropological]] tone of [[Susan Orlean]]'s 1994 essay "Figures in a Mall," written for ''[[The New Yorker]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stoloff|first=Sam|editor1-last=Birrell|editor1-first=Susan|editor2-last=McDonald|editor2-first=Mary G.|year=2000|pages=234–250|title=Reading Sport: Critical Essays on Power and Representation|orig-year=1995|department=Tonya Harding, Nancy Kerrigan, &amp; the Bodily Figuration of Social Class|url-access=subscription|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=U4ukmwWWzgEC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=sam%20stoloff|oclc=43036842|isbn=1555534309|ref=harv|publisher=Northeastern University Press|access-date=Aug 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Orlean" /&gt;

In academic Sarah Marshall's 2014 essay entitled "Remote Control: Tonya Harding, Nancy Kerrigan, and the Spectacles of Female Power and Pain," she noted the pervasive role of the media in the 1994 scandal, particularly the manner in which Harding's life outside the realm of skating became publicly scrutinized: "Somehow, in the scandal's aftermath, the form of the Tonya-bash was able to alchemize even the most chilling details of Tonya's life into tabloid gold." Marshall also examined the role of Harding's "[[tomboy]]" persona in the context of figure skating. She theorized that Harding was rejected by the figure skating [[ethos]] because she did not conform – as Marshall believed many figure skaters including Nancy Kerrigan did – to appearing as "beautiful without being sexual, strong without being intimidating, and vulnerable without being weak."&lt;ref name=believermag.com/&gt;

In Tyler Chase Knowles' 2016 honors thesis entitled "Taking Out the Trash: Middle Class Anxieties and The White Trash Menace," he extrapolated on a quotation made by Emma Gray in her 2014 ''[[HuffPost]]'' article. The quotation explored how Gray believed Harding was labelled "the skating world's perfect villain" due to her appearance, [[Dysfunctional family|broken home]], and [[Poverty in the United States|impoverished background]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/emma-gray/nancy-kerrigan-tonya-harding-the-price-of-gold_b_4578036.html|department=The Blog|title=What We Missed About The Nancy Kerrigan-Tonya Harding Scandal 20 Years Ago|first=Emma|last=Gray|newspaper=HuffPost|date=Jan 10, 2014|accessdate=Aug 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Knowles theorized that there also existed the [[Sociocultural perspective|socio-cultural]] personified "Defender" who also chose to reject Harding. He defined the "Defender" as a person or persons who sympathize(s) with the [[working poor]], a group including the [[Poor white|white underclass]]. The "Defender" would blame the plight of the poor on [[Economic sociology|societal]] and [[Income inequality in the United States|economic]] factors, yet the "Defender" would continue to reinforce [[Normality (behavior)|conventional values]] such as [[Class stratification|distinguishing the class border]]. Knowles argued that Harding did not belong in the "Defender's" approved category of "poor white" because she did not – in the opinion of the "Defender" – make enough effort, given her figure skating membership, to [[Cultural assimilation|assimilate]] towards [[elite culture]]. The "Defender" wanted Tonya Harding to use her USFSA membership for [[social mobility]], caring little whether she could prove herself to be [[High performance sport|among the best Olympic competitors]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Knowles|first=Tyler Chase|date=April 2016|publication-place=Connecticut|title=Taking Out the Trash: Middle Class Anxieties and The White Trash Menace|department=The Perfect Woman: A Case Study on Tonya Harding|type=Honors Thesis|chapter=2|publisher=Faculty of Wesleyan University |url=https://wesscholar.wesleyan.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://scholar.google.ca/&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=2584&amp;context=etd_hon_theses|access-date=Aug 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Trefoil-Architectural.svg|150px|thumb|right|Architectural trefoil]]
'''Trefoil''' (from Latin ''{{lang|la|trifolium}}'', "three-leaved plant") is a graphic form composed of the outline of three overlapping rings used in architecture and [[Christian symbolism]]. The term is also applied to other symbols of three-fold shape.

==Architecture==

===Ornamentation===
Trefoil is a term in [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] [[architecture]] given to the ornamental foliation or cusping introduced in the heads of window-lights, tracery, and panellings, in which the center takes the form of a three-lobed [[leaf]] (formed from three partially overlapping circles). One of the earliest examples is in the plate tracery at [[Winchester Cathedral|Winchester]] (1222–1235).  The fourfold version of an architectural trefoil is a [[quatrefoil]].

A simple trefoil shape in itself can be symbolic of the Trinity,&lt;ref&gt;''Our Christian Symbols'' by Friedrich Rest ({{ISBN|0-8298-0099-9}}), p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; while a trefoil combined with an equilateral triangle was also a moderately common symbol of the Christian [[Trinity]] during the [[late Middle Ages]] in some parts of Europe.  Two forms of this are shown below:

&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Trefoil-Architectural-Equilateral-Triangle-outlined.svg|Outlined
File:Trefoil-Architectural-Equilateral-Triangle-interlaced.svg|Interlaced
&lt;/gallery&gt;

A [[Doves as symbols#Christianity|dove]], which symbolizes the [[Holy Spirit]], is sometimes depicted within the outlined form of the trefoil combined with a triangle.

===Architectural layout===

In architecture and archaeology, trefoils describe a layout or floorplan consisting of three [[apse]]s in clover-leaf shape, as for example in the [[Megalithic temples of Malta]].

Particularly in church architecture, such a layout may be called a "triconchos".
&lt;gallery&gt;
File:Evolution du plan des temples copie.jpg|Evolution of layout of Maltese Megalithic temples; [[Skorba Temples|Skorba]] (upper right) has a typical trefoil plan
File:Trikonchos.gif|Triconchos
&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Heraldry==
The [[heraldry|heraldic]] ''trefoil'' is a stylized [[clover]]. It should not be confused with the figure named in French heraldry ''tiercefeuille'', which is a stylized flower with three petals. It differs from the heraldic trefoil in being not slipped. It could be translated as ''threefoil''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}. The French terms ''quartefeuille'' and ''quintefeuille'' are translated as ''quatrefoils'' and ''cinquefoils''.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Symbols==

Symmetrical Trefoils are particularly popular as warning and informational symbols. If a box containing hazardous material is moved around and shifted into different positions, it is still easy to recognize the symbol,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hms.harvard.edu/orsp/coms/BiosafetyResources/History-of-Biohazard-Symbol.htm|title=Committee on Microbiological Safety - HMS|author=|date=|website=www.hms.harvard.edu|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the distinctive trefoil design of the [[recycling symbol]] makes it easy for a consumer to notice and identify the packaging the symbol has been printed on as recyclable. Easily stenciled symbols are also favored.
&lt;gallery&gt;

File:WikiProject Scouting trefoil fade.svg|One particular stylized form of the heraldic trefoil is used as the main element in the logo of most [[Girl Guiding and Girl Scouting]] organizations. For Girl Scouts, the three trefoil leaves represent the three-fold promise:  "To serve God and my country, to help people at all times, and to live by the Girl Scout law."
&lt;/gallery&gt;

While the green trefoil is considered by many to be the symbol of Ireland, the harp has much greater officially recognized status.  Therefore, shamrocks generally do not appear on Irish coins or postage stamps.

A trefoil is also part of the logo for [[Adidas Originals]], which also includes three stripes.

'''Truth''' is most often used to mean being in accord with [[fact]] or [[reality]], or fidelity to an original or standard.&lt;ref name = Merriam-Webster-def&gt;Merriam-Webster's Online Dictionary, [http://m-w.com/dictionary/truth truth], 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Truth is also sometimes defined in [[modernity|modern]] contexts as an idea of "truth to self", or [[authenticity (philosophy)|authenticity]].

Truth is usually held to be [[principle of bivalence|opposite]] to [[Falsity|falsehood]], which, correspondingly, can also suggest a logical, factual, or ethical meaning. The [[concept]] of truth is discussed and [[debate]]d in several contexts, including philosophy, art, theology, and science. Most human activities depend upon the concept, where its nature as a concept is assumed rather than being a subject of discussion; these include most of the [[science]]s, [[law]], [[journalism]], and everyday life. Some philosophers view the concept of truth as basic, and unable to be explained in any terms that are more easily understood than the concept of truth itself. To some, truth is viewed as the correspondence of [[language]] or [[thought]] to an independent [[reality]], in what is sometimes called the [[correspondence theory of truth]].

Various theories and views of truth continue to be debated among scholars, philosophers, and theologians.&lt;ref name=PUP32014&gt;{{cite book|author1=Alexis G. Burgess and John P. Burgess|title=Truth|date=March 20, 2011|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0691144016|edition=1st|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/9460.html|accessdate=October 4, 2014|format=hardcover|quote=a concise introduction to current philosophical debates about truth}}&lt;/ref&gt; Language is a means by which humans convey [[information]] to one another. The method used to determine whether something is a truth is termed a [[criteria of truth|criterion of truth]]. There are varying stances on such questions as what constitutes truth: what things are [[truthbearer]]s capable of being true or false; how to define, identify, and distinguish truth; what roles do faith and empirical knowledge play; and whether truth can be [[Subjectivity|subjective]] or is [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]]: [[knowledge relativity|relative]] truth versus [[Absolute (philosophy)|absolute]] truth.

[[File:An angel carrying the banner of "Truth", Roslin, Midlothian.JPG|thumb|left|An angel carrying the banner of "Truth", [[Roslin, Midlothian]]]]
The English word ''[[:wikt:truth|truth]]'' is derived from [[Old English]] ''tríewþ, tréowþ, trýwþ'', [[Middle English]] ''trewþe'', cognate to [[Old High German]] ''triuwida'', [[Old Norse]] ''tryggð''. Like ''[[Troth (disambiguation)|troth]]'', it is a ''[[:wikt:-th|-th]]'' nominalisation of the adjective ''true'' (Old English ''tréowe'').

The English word ''[[:wikt:true|true]]'' is from Old English ([[West Sexaon dialect (Old English)|West Saxon]]) ''(ge)tríewe, [[:wikt:treowe|tréowe]]'', cognate to [[Old Saxon]] ''(gi)trûui'', [[Old High German]] ''(ga)triuwu'' ([[Modern German]] ''treu'' "faithful"), [[Old Norse]] ''tryggr'', [[Gothic language|Gothic]] ''triggws'',&lt;ref&gt;see [[Holtzmann's law]] for the ''-ww-'' : ''-gg-'' alternation.&lt;/ref&gt; all from a [[Proto-Germanic]] ''*trewwj-'' "having [[good faith]]", perhaps ultimately from PIE *dru- "tree", on the notion of "steadfast as an oak" (e.g., Sanskrit "taru" tree).&lt;ref name="Truth from Online Etymology"&gt;{{cite web|last=Etymology|first=Online|title=Online Etymology|url=http://www.etymonline.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Old Norse ''{{lang|is|trú}}'', "faith, word of honour; religious faith, belief"&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.northvegr.org/zoega/h442.php A Concise Dictionary of Old Icelandic]'', Geir T. Zoëga (1910), Northvegr.org&lt;/ref&gt; (archaic English ''[[:wikt:troth|troth]]'' "loyalty, honesty, good faith", compare ''{{lang|is|[[wikt:Ásatrú|Ásatrú]]}}'').

Thus, 'truth' involves both the quality of "faithfulness, fidelity, loyalty, sincerity, veracity",&lt;ref&gt;[[OED]] on ''true'' has "Steadfast in adherence to a commander or friend, to a principle or cause, to one's promises, faith, etc.; firm in allegiance; faithful, loyal, constant, trusty; Honest, honourable, upright, virtuous, trustworthy; free from deceit, sincere, truthful " besides "Conformity with fact; agreement with reality; accuracy, correctness, verity; Consistent with fact; agreeing with the reality; representing the thing as it is; Real, genuine; rightly answering to the description; properly so called; not counterfeit, spurious, or imaginary."&lt;/ref&gt; and that of "agreement with [[fact]] or [[reality]]", in Anglo-Saxon expressed by ''[[:wikt:sōþ|sōþ]]'' (Modern English ''[[:wikt:sooth|sooth]]'').

All Germanic languages besides English have introduced a terminological distinction between truth "fidelity" and truth "factuality". To express "factuality", [[North Germanic languages|North Germanic]] opted for nouns derived from ''sanna'' "to assert, affirm", while continental [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic]] (German and Dutch) opted for continuations of ''wâra'' "faith, trust, pact" (cognate to Slavic ''věra'' "(religious) faith", but influenced by Latin ''[[veritas|verus]]''). [[Romance language]]s use terms following the Latin ''[[veritas]]'', while the Greek ''[[aletheia]]'', Russian ''[[:wikt:pravda|pravda]]'' and South Slavic ''istina'' have separate etymological origins.

The question of what is a proper basis for deciding how words, symbols, ideas and beliefs may properly be considered true, whether by a single person or an entire society, is dealt with by the five most prevalent substantive theories of truth listed below. Each presents perspectives that are widely shared by published scholars.&lt;ref name="EPT"&gt;[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Supp., "Truth", auth: Michael Williams, pp. 572–73 (Macmillan, 1996)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blackburn, Simon, and Simmons, Keith (eds., 1999), ''Truth'', Oxford University Press, Oxford, UK. Includes papers by James, Ramsey, Russell, Tarski, and more recent work.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | editor1-last = Hale | editor1-first = Bob| editor2-first = Crispin | doi = 10.1111/b.9780631213260.1999.00015.x | pages = 309–30 | year = 1999 | isbn = 9780631213260 | pmid =  | pmc = | editor2-last = Wright | title = A Companion to the Philosophy of Language}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theories other than the most prevalent substantive theories are also discussed. More recently developed "[[deflationary theory of truth|deflationary]]" or "minimalist" theories of truth have emerged as possible alternatives to the most prevalent substantive theories. Minimalist reasoning centres around the notion that the application of a term like ''true'' to a statement does not assert anything significant about it, for instance, anything about its ''nature''. Minimalist reasoning realises ''truth'' as a label utilised in general discourse to express agreement, to stress claims, or to form general assumptions.&lt;ref name = EPT/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Horwich, Paul, ''Truth'', (2nd edition, 1988),&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Field, Hartry, ''Truth and the Absence of Fact'' (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Substantive theories===

====Correspondence theory====
{{Main|Correspondence theory of truth}}
Correspondence theories emphasise that true beliefs and true statements correspond to the actual state of affairs.&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Vol.2, "Correspondence Theory of Truth", auth.: [[Arthur N. Prior]], p. 223 (Macmillan, 1969). Prior uses [[Bertrand Russell]]'s wording in defining correspondence theory. According to Prior, Russell was substantially responsible for helping to make correspondence theory widely known under this name.&lt;/ref&gt; This type of theory stresses a relationship between thoughts or statements on one hand, and things or objects on the other. It is a traditional model tracing its origins to [[ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] philosophers such as [[Socrates]], [[Plato]], and [[Aristotle]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Vol.2, "Correspondence Theory of Truth", auth.: Arthur N. Prior, pp. 223–24 (Macmillan, 1969).&lt;/ref&gt; This class of theories holds that the truth or the falsity of a representation is determined in principle entirely by how it relates to "things", by whether it accurately describes those "things." A classic example of correspondence theory is the statement by the thirteenth century philosopher and theologian [[Thomas Aquinas]]: "[[Veritas est adaequatio rei et intellectus]]" ("Truth is the adequation of things and [[intellect]]"), which Aquinas attributed to the ninth century [[Neoplatonist]] [[Isaac Israeli ben Solomon|Isaac Israeli]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Vol. 2, "Correspondence Theory of Truth", auth.: Arthur N. Prior, Macmillan, 1969, p. 224.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/truth-correspondence "Correspondence Theory of Truth", in Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Aquinas, ''[[Summa Theologiae]]'', I. Q.16, A.2 arg. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Aquinas also restated the theory as: "A judgment is said to be true when it conforms to the external reality".&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/truth-correspondence "Correspondence Theory of Truth", in Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy] (citing ''De Veritate'' Q.1, A.1–3 and ''[[Summa Theologiae]]'', I. Q.16).&lt;/ref&gt;

Correspondence theory centres heavily around the assumption that truth is a matter of accurately copying what is known as "[[objective reality]]" and then representing it in thoughts, words and other symbols.&lt;ref&gt;''See, e.g.,'' Bradley, F.H., "On Truth and Copying", in Blackburn, ''et al.'' (eds., 1999),''Truth'', 31–45.&lt;/ref&gt; Many modern theorists have stated that this ideal cannot be achieved without analysing additional factors.&lt;ref name=EPT/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Vol.2, "Correspondence Theory of Truth", auth: Arthur N. Prior, pp. 223 ''ff''. Macmillan, 1969. See especially, section on "Moore's Correspondence Theory", 225–26, "Russell's Correspondence Theory", 226–27, "Remsey and Later Wittgenstein", 228–29, "Tarski's Semantic Theory", 230–31.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, language plays a role in that all languages have words to represent concepts that are virtually undefined in other languages. The [[German language|German]] word ''[[Zeitgeist]]'' is one such example: one who speaks or understands the language may "know" what it means, but any translation of the word apparently fails to accurately capture its full meaning (this is a problem with many abstract words, especially those derived in [[agglutinative languages]]). Thus, some words add an additional parameter to the construction of an accurate [[truth predicate]]. Among the philosophers who grappled with this problem is [[Alfred Tarski]], whose [[semantic theory of truth|semantic theory]] is summarized further below in this article.&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Vol.2, "Correspondence Theory of Truth", auth: Arthur N. Prior, pp. 223 ''ff''. Macmillan, 1969. See the section on "Tarski's Semantic Theory", 230–31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents of several of the theories below have gone further to assert that there are yet other issues necessary to the analysis, such as interpersonal power struggles, community interactions, personal biases and other factors involved in deciding what is seen as truth.

====Coherence theory====
{{Main|Coherence theory of truth}}
[[File:Statue of Truth.jpg|thumb|left|[[Walter Seymour Allward]]'s ''Veritas'' (Truth) outside [[Supreme Court of Canada]], [[Ottawa, Ontario]] [[Canada]]]]

For coherence theories in general, truth requires a proper fit of elements within a whole system. Very often, though, coherence is taken to imply something more than simple logical consistency; often there is a demand that the propositions in a coherent system lend mutual inferential support to each other. So, for example, the completeness and comprehensiveness of the underlying set of concepts is a critical factor in judging the validity and usefulness of a coherent system.&lt;ref&gt;[[Immanuel Kant]], for instance, assembled a controversial but quite coherent system in the early 19th century, whose validity and usefulness continues to be debated even today. Similarly, the systems of [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]] and [[Spinoza]] are characteristic systems that are internally coherent but controversial in terms of their utility and validity.&lt;/ref&gt;  A pervasive tenet of coherence theories is the idea that truth is primarily a property of whole systems of propositions, and can be ascribed to individual propositions only according to their coherence with the whole.  Among the assortment of perspectives commonly regarded as coherence theory, theorists differ on the question of whether coherence entails many possible true systems of thought or only a single absolute system.

Some variants of coherence theory are claimed to describe the essential and intrinsic properties of [[formal system]]s in logic and mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Vol.2, "Coherence Theory of Truth", auth: Alan R. White, pp. 130–31 (Macmillan, 1969)&lt;/ref&gt;  However, formal reasoners are content to contemplate [[independence (mathematical logic)|axiomatically independent]] and sometimes mutually contradictory systems side by side, for example, the various [[noneuclidean geometry|alternative geometries]]. On the whole, coherence theories have been rejected for lacking justification in their application to other areas of truth, especially with respect to assertions about the [[Natural environment|natural world]], [[empirical]] data in general, assertions about practical matters of psychology and society, especially when used without support from the other major theories of truth.&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Vol.2, "Coherence Theory of Truth", auth: Alan R. White, pp. 131–33, ''see'' esp., section on "Epistemological assumptions" (Macmillan, 1969)&lt;/ref&gt;

Coherence theories distinguish the thought of [[rationalism|rationalist]] philosophers, particularly of [[Spinoza]], [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], and [[G.W.F. Hegel]], along with the British philosopher [[F.H. Bradley]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Vol.2, "Coherence Theory of Truth", auth: Alan R. White, p. 130&lt;/ref&gt;  They have found a resurgence also among several proponents of [[logical positivism]], notably [[Otto Neurath]] and [[Carl Hempel]].

====Constructivist theory====
{{Main|Constructivist epistemology}}

[[Constructivist epistemology|Social constructivism]] holds that truth is constructed by social processes, is historically and culturally specific, and that it is in part shaped through the power struggles within a community. Constructivism views all of our knowledge as "constructed," because it does not reflect any external "transcendent" realities (as a pure correspondence theory might hold).  Rather, perceptions of truth are viewed as contingent on convention, human perception, and social experience. It is believed by constructivists that representations of physical and biological reality, including [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], and [[gender]], are socially constructed.

[[Giambattista Vico]] was among the first to claim that history and culture were man-made. Vico's [[epistemology|epistemological]] orientation gathers the most diverse rays and unfolds in one axiom—''verum ipsum factum''—"truth itself is constructed". [[Hegel]] and [[Marx]] were among the other early proponents of the premise that truth is, or can be, socially constructed. Marx, like many critical theorists who followed, did not reject the existence of objective truth but rather distinguished between true knowledge and knowledge that has been distorted through power or ideology. For Marx, scientific and true knowledge is "in accordance with the dialectical understanding of history" and ideological knowledge is "an epiphenomenal expression of the relation of material forces in a given economic arrangement".&lt;ref&gt;May, Todd, 1993, Between Genealogy and Epistemology: Psychology, politics in the thought of Michel Foucault' with reference to Althusser and Balibar, 1970&lt;/ref&gt;

====Consensus theory====
{{Main|Consensus theory of truth}}

[[Consensus theory of truth|Consensus theory]] holds that truth is whatever is agreed upon, or in some versions, might come to be agreed upon, by some specified group. Such a group might include all human beings, or a [[subset]] thereof consisting of more than one person.

Among the current advocates of consensus theory as a useful accounting of the concept of "truth" is the philosopher [[Jürgen Habermas]].&lt;ref&gt;''See, e.g.'', Habermas, Jürgen, ''Knowledge and Human Interests'' (English translation, 1972).&lt;/ref&gt; Habermas maintains that truth is what would be agreed upon in an [[ideal speech situation]].&lt;ref&gt;''See, e.g.'', Habermas, Jürgen, ''Knowledge and Human Interests'' (English translation, 1972), esp. Part III, pp. 187 ''ff''.&lt;/ref&gt; Among the current strong critics of consensus theory is the philosopher [[Nicholas Rescher]].&lt;ref&gt;Rescher, Nicholas, ''Pluralism: Against the Demand for Consensus'' (1995).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Islamic tradition, this principle is exemplified by the [[hadith]] in which [[Muhammad]] states, "My [[ummah|community]] will never agree upon an error"&lt;ref&gt;Narrated by [http://sunnah.com/tirmidhi/33/10 al-Tirmidhi (4:2167)], ibn Majah (2:1303), Abu Dawood, and others with slightly different wordings.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pragmatic theory====
{{Main|Pragmatic theory of truth}}

The three most influential forms of the ''pragmatic theory of truth'' were introduced around the turn of the 20th century by [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], [[William James]], and [[John Dewey]].  Although there are wide differences in viewpoint among these and other proponents of pragmatic theory, they hold in common that truth is verified and confirmed by the results of putting one's concepts into practice.&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Vol. 5, "Pragmatic Theory of Truth", 427 (Macmillan, 1969).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charles Sanders Peirce|Peirce]] defines truth as follows:  "Truth is that concordance of an abstract statement with the ideal limit towards which endless investigation would tend to bring scientific belief, which concordance the abstract statement may possess by virtue of the confession of its inaccuracy and one-sidedness, and this confession is an essential ingredient of truth."&lt;ref name="Peirce Truth and Falsity"&gt;Peirce, C.S. (1901), "Truth and Falsity and Error" (in part), pp. 716–20 in [[James Mark Baldwin]], ed., ''Dictionary of Philosophy and Psychology'', v. 2. Peirce's section is entitled "''Logical''", beginning on p. 718, column 1, and ending on p. 720 with the initials "(C.S.P.)", see Google Books [https://books.google.com/books?id=Dc8YAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA718 Eprint]. Reprinted, ''[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#CP|Collected Papers]]'' v. 5, pp. 565–73.&lt;/ref&gt;  This statement stresses Peirce's view that ideas of approximation, incompleteness, and partiality, what he describes elsewhere as ''[[fallibilism]]'' and "reference to the future", are essential to a proper conception of truth.  Although Peirce uses words like ''concordance'' and ''correspondence'' to describe one aspect of the pragmatic [[sign relation]], he is also quite explicit in saying that definitions of truth based on mere correspondence are no more than ''nominal'' definitions, which he accords a lower status than ''real'' definitions.

[[William James]]'s version of pragmatic theory, while complex, is often summarized by his statement that "the 'true' is only the expedient in our way of thinking, just as the 'right' is only the expedient in our way of behaving."&lt;ref name=WJP&gt;James, William, ''The Meaning of Truth, A Sequel to 'Pragmatism','' (1909).&lt;/ref&gt;  By this, James meant that truth is a ''quality'', the value of which is confirmed by its effectiveness when applying concepts to practice (thus, "pragmatic").

[[John Dewey]], less broadly than James but more broadly than Peirce, held that [[inquiry]], whether scientific, technical, sociological, philosophical or cultural, is self-corrective over time ''if''  openly submitted for testing by a community of inquirers in order to clarify, justify, refine and/or refute proposed truths.&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Vol.2, "Dewey, John", auth [[Richard J. Bernstein]], p. 383 (Macmillan, 1969)&lt;/ref&gt;

Though not widely known, a new variation of the pragmatic theory was defined and wielded successfully from the 20th century forward. Defined and named by [[William Ernest Hocking]], this variation is known as "negative pragmatism".  Essentially, what works may or may not be true, but what fails cannot be true because the truth always works.&lt;ref&gt;Sahakian, W.S. &amp; Sahakian, M.L., Ideas of the Great Philosophers, New York: Barnes &amp; Noble, 1966, {{LCCN|66-23155}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Feynman]] also ascribed to it: "We never are definitely right, we can only be sure we are wrong."&lt;ref name="FeynmanThe"&gt;Feynman, The Character of Physical Law, New York: Random House, 1994, {{ISBN|0-679-60127-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This approach incorporates many of the ideas from Peirce, James, and Dewey.  For Peirce, the idea of "... endless investigation would tend to bring about scientific belief ..." fits negative pragmatism in that a negative pragmatist would never stop testing.  As Feynman noted, an idea or theory "... could never be proved right, because tomorrow's experiment might succeed in proving wrong what you thought was right."&lt;ref name="FeynmanThe" /&gt;  Similarly, James and Dewey's ideas also ascribe truth to repeated testing which is "self-corrective" over time.

Pragmatism and negative pragmatism are also closely aligned with the [[coherence theory of truth]] in that any testing should not be isolated but rather incorporate knowledge from all human endeavors and experience.  The universe is a whole and integrated system, and testing should acknowledge and account for its diversity.  As Feynman said, "... if it disagrees with experiment, it is wrong."&lt;ref&gt;Feynman, ''The Character of Physical Law'', p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Minimalist (deflationary) theories===
{{Main|Deflationary theory of truth}}

Modern developments in the field of philosophy, starting with the relatively modern notion that a theory being old does not necessarily imply that it is completely flawless, have resulted in the rise of a new thesis: that the term ''truth'' does not denote a real property of sentences or propositions. This thesis is in part a response to the common use of ''truth predicates'' (e.g., that some particular thing "...is true") which was particularly prevalent in philosophical discourse on truth in the first half of the 20th century.  From this point of view, to assert that "'2 + 2 = 4' is true" is logically equivalent to asserting that "2 + 2 = 4", and the phrase "is true" is completely dispensable in this and every other context. In common parlance, truth predicates are not commonly heard, and it would be interpreted as an unusual occurrence were someone to utilise a truth predicate in an everyday conversation when asserting that something is true. Newer perspectives that take this discrepancy into account and work with sentence structures that are actually employed in common discourse can be broadly described:
* as ''deflationary'' theories of truth, since they attempt to deflate the presumed importance of the words "true" or ''truth'',
* as ''disquotational'' theories, to draw attention to the disappearance of the quotation marks in cases like the above example, or
* as ''minimalist'' theories of truth.&lt;ref name=EPT/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Blackburn, Simon, and Simmons, Keith (eds., 1999), ''Truth'' in the Introductory section of the book.&lt;/ref&gt;

Whichever term is used, deflationary theories can be said to hold in common that "[t]he predicate 'true' is an expressive convenience, not the name of a property requiring deep analysis."&lt;ref name=EPT/&gt; Once we have identified the truth predicate's formal features and utility, deflationists argue, we have said all there is to be said about truth. Among the theoretical concerns of these views is to explain away those special cases where it ''does'' appear that the concept of truth has peculiar and interesting properties. (See, e.g., [[Semantic paradox]]es, and below.)

In addition to highlighting such formal aspects of the predicate "is true", some deflationists point out that the concept enables us to express things that might otherwise require infinitely long sentences. For example, one cannot express confidence in Michael's accuracy by asserting the endless sentence:
:''Michael says, 'snow is white' and snow is white, or he says 'roses are red' and roses are red or he says ... etc.''
This assertion can also be succinctly expressed by saying: ''What Michael says is true''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Kirkham]], [[Theories of Truth: A Critical Introduction]], MIT Press, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Performative theory of truth====
Attributed to [[P. F. Strawson]] is the performative theory of truth which holds that to say "'Snow is white' is true" is to perform the [[speech act]] of signaling one's agreement with the claim that snow is white (much like nodding one's head in agreement). The idea that some statements are more actions than communicative statements is not as odd as it may seem. Consider, for example, that when the bride says "I do" at the appropriate time in a wedding, she is performing the act of taking this man to be her lawful wedded husband. She is not ''describing'' herself as taking this man, but actually doing so (perhaps the most thorough analysis of such "illocutionary acts" is [[J. L. Austin]], "[[How to Do Things With Words]]"&lt;ref&gt;J. L. Austin, "How to Do Things With Words". Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1975&lt;/ref&gt;).

Strawson holds that a similar analysis is applicable to all speech acts, not just illocutionary ones: "To say a statement is true is not to make a statement about a statement, but rather to perform the act of agreeing with, accepting, or endorsing a statement.  When one says 'It's true that it's raining,' one asserts no more than 'It's raining.'  The function of [the statement] 'It's true that...' is to agree with, accept, or endorse the statement that 'it's raining.'"&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], Vol. 6: ''Performative Theory of Truth'', auth: Gertrude Ezorsky, p. 88 (Macmillan, 1969)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Redundancy and related theories====
{{Main|Redundancy theory of truth}}

According to the [[redundancy theory of truth]], asserting that a statement is true is completely equivalent to asserting the statement itself.  For example, making the assertion that "&amp;nbsp;'Snow is white' is true" is equivalent to asserting "Snow is white".  Redundancy theorists infer from this premise that truth is a redundant concept; that is, it is merely a word that is traditionally used in conversation or writing, generally for emphasis, but not a word that actually equates to anything in reality.  This theory is commonly attributed to [[Frank P. Ramsey]], who held that the use of words like ''fact'' and ''truth'' was nothing but a [[periphrasis|roundabout]] way of asserting a proposition, and that treating these words as separate problems in isolation from judgment was merely a "linguistic muddle".&lt;ref name="EPT"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ramsey, F.P. (1927), "Facts and Propositions", Aristotelian Society Supplementary Volume 7, 153–70. Reprinted, pp. 34–51 in F.P. Ramsey, Philosophical Papers, David Hugh Mellor (ed.), Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Le Morvan, Pierre. (2004) "Ramsey on Truth and Truth on Ramsey", ''The British Journal for the History of Philosophy'' 12(4), pp. 705–18.&lt;/ref&gt;

A variant of redundancy theory is the disquotational theory which uses a modified form of [[Alfred Tarski|Tarski]]'s [[Truth#Semantic theory of truth|schema]]: To say that '"P" is true' is to say that P.  A version of this theory was defended by [[C. J. F. Williams]] in his book ''What is Truth?''.  Yet another version of deflationism is the prosentential theory of truth, first developed by Dorothy Grover, Joseph Camp, and [[Nuel Belnap]] as an elaboration of Ramsey's claims.  They argue that sentences like "That's true", when said in response to "It's raining", are [[prosentence]]s, expressions that merely repeat the content of other expressions.  In the same way that ''it'' means the same as ''my dog'' in the sentence ''My dog was hungry, so I fed it'', ''That's true'' is supposed to mean the same as ''It's raining''—if you say the latter and I then say the former.  These variations do not necessarily follow Ramsey in asserting that truth is ''not'' a property, but rather can be understood to say that, for instance, the assertion "P" may well involve a substantial truth, and the theorists in this case are minimizing only the redundancy or prosentence involved in the statement such as "that's true."&lt;ref name=EPT/&gt;

Deflationary principles do not apply to representations that are not analogous to sentences, and also do not apply to many other things that are commonly judged to be true or otherwise.  Consider the analogy between the sentence "Snow is white" and the character named Snow White, both of which can be true in some sense.  To a minimalist, saying "Snow is white is true" is the same as saying "Snow is white," but to say "Snow White is true" is ''not'' the same as saying "Snow White."

====Philosophical skepticism====
{{see also|Philosophical skepticism|Certainty}}

[[Philosophical skepticism]] is generally any questioning attitude or [[doubt]] towards one or more items of knowledge or belief which ascribe truth to their assertions and propositions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=R. H. |last=Popkin |title=The History of Skepticism from Erasmus to Descartes (rev. ed. 1968); C. L. Stough, Greek Skepticism (1969); M. Burnyeat, ed., The Skeptical Tradition (1983); B. Stroud, The Significance of Philosophical Skepticism (1984) |url=http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Skeptikoi |work=Encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Philosophical views are typically classed as skeptical when they involve advancing some degree of doubt regarding claims that are elsewhere taken for granted." [http://www.utm.edu/research/iep/s/skepcont.htm utm.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; It is often directed at domains, such as the [[supernatural]], morality ([[moral skepticism]]), religion (skepticism about the existence of God), or knowledge (skepticism about the possibility of knowledge, or of certainty).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Oxford Handbook of Skepticism|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Ozv0lftrUeEC|publisher = Oxford University Press, US|year = 2008|isbn = 9780195183214|language = en|first = John|last = Greco|authorlink=John Greco (philosopher)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Formally, skepticism as a topic occurs in the context of philosophy, particularly [[epistemology]], although it can be applied to any topic such as politics, religion, and pseudoscience.

Philosophical skepticism comes in various forms. Radical forms of skepticism deny that knowledge or rational belief is possible and urge us to suspend judgment regarding ascription of truth on many or all controversial matters. More moderate forms of skepticism claim only that nothing can be known with certainty, or that we can know little or nothing about the "big questions" in life, such as whether God exists or whether there is an afterlife. [[Religious skepticism]] is "doubt concerning basic religious principles (such as immortality, providence, and revelation)".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Definition of SKEPTICISM|url = http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/skepticism|website = www.merriam-webster.com|access-date = 2016-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Scientific skepticism]] concerns testing beliefs for reliability, by subjecting them to [[wikt:systematic|systematic]] investigation using the [[scientific method]], to discover [[empirical evidence]] for them.

===Pluralist theories===
{{Main|Pluralist theories of truth}}
Several of the major theories of truth hold that there is a particular property the having of which makes a belief or proposition true. Pluralist theories of truth assert that there may be more than one property that makes propositions true: ethical propositions might be true by virtue of coherence. Propositions about the physical world might be true by corresponding to the objects and properties they are about.

Some of the pragmatic theories, such as those by [[Charles Sanders Peirce|Charles Peirce]] and [[William James]], included aspects of correspondence, coherence and constructivist theories.&lt;ref name="Peirce Truth and Falsity"/&gt;&lt;ref name=WJP/&gt; [[Crispin Wright]] argued in his 1992 book ''Truth and Objectivity'' that any predicate which satisfied certain platitudes about truth qualified as a truth predicate. In some discourses, Wright argued, the role of the truth predicate might be played by the notion of superassertibility.&lt;ref&gt;Truth and Objectivity, Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Lynch (philosopher)|Michael Lynch]], in a 2009 book ''Truth as One and Many'', argued that we should see truth as a functional property capable of being multiply manifested in distinct properties like correspondence or coherence.&lt;ref&gt;Truth as One and Many (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Most believed theories===
According to a survey of professional philosophers and others on their philosophical views which was carried out in November 2009 (taken by 3226 respondents, including 1803 philosophy faculty members and/or PhDs and 829 philosophy graduate students) 45% of respondents accept or lean towards correspondence theories, 21% accept or lean towards deflationary theories and 14% [[Epistemic theories of truth|epistemic theories]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://philpapers.org/surveys/results.pl?affil=All+respondents&amp;areas0=0&amp;areas_max=1&amp;grain=medium |title=The PhilPapers Surveys – Preliminary Survey results |website=The PhilPapers Surveys |publisher=Philpapers.org |date= |accessdate=2012-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formal theories==

===Truth in logic===
{{Main|Logical truth|Criteria of truth|Truth value}}

[[Logic]] is concerned with the patterns in [[reason]] that can help tell us if a [[proposition]] is true or not. However, logic does not deal with truth in the absolute sense, as for instance a [[metaphysics|metaphysician]] does. Logicians use [[formal language]]s to express the truths which they are concerned with, and as such there is only truth under some [[interpretation (logic)|interpretation]] or truth within some [[logical system]].

A logical truth (also called an analytic truth or a necessary truth) is a statement which is true in all possible worlds&lt;ref&gt;[[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; or under all possible interpretations, as contrasted to a ''[[fact]]'' (also called a ''[[Analytic-synthetic distinction|synthetic claim]]'' or a ''[[Necessary and sufficient condition|contingency]]'') which is only true in this [[World (philosophy)|world]] as it has historically unfolded. A proposition such as "If p and q, then p" is considered to be a logical truth because of the meaning of the [[symbol (formal)|symbols]] and [[well-formed formula|words]] in it and not because of any fact of any particular world. They are such that they could not be untrue.

[[Degree of truth|Degrees]] of [[truth values|truth]] in logic may be represented using two or more discrete values, as with [[principle of bivalence|bivalent logic]] (or [[Boolean logic|binary logic]]), [[three-valued logic]], and other forms of [[finite-valued logic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Kretzmann| first=Norman| title=William of Sherwood's Treatise on Syncategorematic Words| chapter=IV, section&lt;nowiki&gt;=&lt;/nowiki&gt;2.

===Truth in mathematics===
{{Main|Model theory|Proof theory}}

There are two main approaches to truth in mathematics.  They are the ''[[model theory|model theory of truth]]'' and the ''[[proof theory|proof theory of truth]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Penelope Maddy; ''Realism in Mathematics''; Series: Clarendon Paperbacks; Paperback: 216 pages; Publisher: Oxford University Press, US (October 15, 1992); {{ISBN|019824035X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, with the nineteenth century development of [[Boolean algebra (logic)|Boolean algebra]] mathematical models of logic began to treat "truth", also represented as "T" or "1", as an arbitrary constant.  "Falsity" is also an arbitrary constant, which can be represented as "F" or "0".  In [[propositional logic]], these symbols can be manipulated according to a set of [[axioms]] and [[rules of inference]], often given in the form of [[truth table]]s.

In addition, from at least the time of [[Hilbert's program]] at the turn of the twentieth century to the proof of [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems]] and the development of the [[Church–Turing thesis]] in the early part of that century, true statements in mathematics were [[logical positivism|generally assumed]] to be those statements that are provable in a formal axiomatic system.&lt;ref&gt;Elliott Mendelson; ''Introduction to Mathematical Logic''; Series: Discrete Mathematics and Its Applications; Hardcover: 469 pages; Publisher: Chapman and Hall/CRC; 5 edition (August 11, 2009); {{ISBN|1584888768}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The works of [[Kurt Gödel]], [[Alan Turing]], and others shook this assumption, with the development of statements that are true but cannot be proven within the system.&lt;ref&gt;''See, e.g.,'' Chaitin, Gregory L., ''The Limits of Mathematics'' (1997) esp. 89 ''ff''.&lt;/ref&gt; Two examples of the latter can be found in [[Hilbert's problems]]. Work on [[Hilbert's 10th problem]] led in the late twentieth century to the construction of specific [[Diophantine equations]] for which it is undecidable whether they have a solution,&lt;ref&gt;M. Davis. "Hilbert's Tenth Problem is Unsolvable." ''American Mathematical Monthly'' 80, pp. 233–69, 1973&lt;/ref&gt; or even if they do, whether they have a finite or infinite number of solutions. More fundamentally, [[Hilbert's first problem]] was on the [[continuum hypothesis]].&lt;ref&gt;Yandell, Benjamin H.. ''The Honors Class. Hilbert's Problems and Their Solvers'' (2002).&lt;/ref&gt; Gödel and [[Paul Cohen (mathematician)|Paul Cohen]] showed that this hypothesis cannot be proved or disproved using the standard [[axiom]]s of [[set theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Chaitin, Gregory L., ''The Limits of Mathematics'' (1997) 1–28, 89 ''ff''.&lt;/ref&gt; In the view of some, then, it is equally reasonable to take either the continuum hypothesis or its negation as a new axiom.

Reconsidered assumptions about the essence of truth arose in the wake of Gödel's incompleteness theorems. [[Martin Heidegger]] pointed out that truth may be essentially a matter of letting [[Being and Time|beings]] (entities of any kind, which can include logical propositions)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Heidegger| first=Martin| title=Being and Time| year=1927| url=http://pdf-objects.com/files/Heidegger-Martin-Being-and-Time-trans.-Macquarrie-Robinson-Blackwell-1962.pdf}} See page 39.&lt;/ref&gt; be free to reveal themselves as they are, and stated:
{{quote|“Truth” is not a feature of correct propositions which are asserted of an “object” by a human “subject” and then are “valid” somewhere, in what sphere we know not. Rather, truth is disclosure of beings through which an openness essentially unfolds [''west''].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Heidegger| first=Martin| title=On the Essence of Truth| year=1943| url=https://aphelis.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Martin-Heidegger-On-the-Essence-of-Truth.pdf}} See pages 7-8. The quoted text is translated from the German by John Sallis.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Gödel agreed that the ability to perceive the truth of a mathematical or logical proposition is a matter of [[logical intuition|intuition]], an ability he admitted could be ultimately beyond the scope of a formal theory of logic or mathematics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Ravitch| first=Harold| title=On Gödel's Philosophy of Mathematics| year=1998| url=http://www.friesian.com/goedel/chap-2.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Solomon| first=Martin| title=On Kurt Gödel's Philosophy of Mathematics| year=1998| url=http://calculemus.org/lect/07logika/godel-solomon.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and perhaps best considered in the realm of human [[comprehension (logic)|comprehension]] and communication, but commented:

===Tarski's semantic theory of truth===
{{main|Semantic theory of truth|Tarski's theory of truth}}

The [[semantic theory of truth]] has as its general case for a given language:
:'P' is true if and only if P
where 'P' refers to the sentence (the sentence's name), and P is just the sentence itself.

[[Tarski's theory of truth]] (named after [[Alfred Tarski]]) was developed for formal languages, such as [[formal logic]]. Here he restricted it in this way: no language could contain its own truth predicate, that is, the expression ''is true'' could only apply to sentences in some other language. The latter he called an ''object language'', the language being talked about. (It may, in turn, have a truth predicate that can be applied to sentences in still another language.) The reason for his restriction was that languages that contain their own truth predicate will contain [[Liar paradox|paradoxical]] sentences such as, "This sentence is not true". As a result, Tarski held that the semantic theory could not be applied to any natural language, such as English, because they contain their own truth predicates. [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]] used it as the foundation of his [[truth-conditional semantics]] and linked it to [[radical interpretation]] in a form of [[coherentism]].

[[Bertrand Russell]] is credited with noticing the existence of such paradoxes even in the best symbolic formations of mathematics in his day, in particular the paradox that came to be named after him, [[Russell's paradox]]. Russell and [[Alfred North Whitehead|Whitehead]] attempted to solve these problems in ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'' by putting statements into a hierarchy of [[type theory|types]], wherein a statement cannot refer to itself, but only to statements lower in the hierarchy.  This in turn led to new orders of difficulty regarding the precise natures of types and the structures of conceptually possible [[type system]]s that have yet to be resolved to this day.

===Kripke's semantic theory of truth===
{{Main|Kripke's theory of truth}}
[[Kripke's theory of truth]] (named after [[Saul Kripke]]) contends that a natural language can in fact contain its own truth predicate without giving rise to contradiction. He showed how to construct one as follows:
* Begin with a subset of sentences of a natural language that contains no occurrences of the expression "is true" (or "is false"). So ''The barn is big'' is included in the subset, but not " ''The barn is big'' is true", nor problematic sentences such as "''This sentence'' is false".
* Define truth just for the sentences in that subset.
* Then extend the definition of truth to include sentences that predicate truth or falsity of one of the original subset of sentences. So "''The barn is big'' is true" is now included, but not either "''This sentence'' is false" nor "'''The barn is big'' is true' is true".
* Next, define truth for all sentences that predicate truth or falsity of a member of the second set. Imagine this process repeated infinitely, so that truth is defined for ''The barn is big''; then for "''The barn is big'' is true"; then for "'''The barn is big'' is true' is true", and so on.

Notice that truth never gets defined for sentences like ''This sentence is false'', since it was not in the original subset and does not predicate truth of any sentence in the original or any subsequent set. In Kripke's terms, these are "ungrounded." Since these sentences are never assigned either truth or falsehood even if the process is carried out infinitely, Kripke's theory implies that some sentences are neither true nor false. This contradicts the [[Principle of bivalence]]: every sentence must be either true or false. Since this principle is a key premise in deriving the [[Liar paradox]], the paradox is dissolved.&lt;ref&gt;Kripke, Saul. "Outline of a Theory of Truth", Journal of Philosophy, 72 (1975), 690–716&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it has been shown by [[Proof sketch for Gödel's first incompleteness theorem|Gödel]] that self-reference cannot be avoided naively, since propositions about seemingly unrelated objects can have an informal self-referential meaning; in Gödel's work, these objects are integer numbers, and they have an informal meaning regarding propositions. In fact, this idea—manifested by the [[diagonal lemma]]—is the basis for [[Tarski's undefinability theorem|Tarski's theorem]] that truth cannot be consistently defined.

It has thus been claimed&lt;ref&gt;Keith Simmons, ''Universality and the Liar: An Essay on Truth and the Diagonal Argument'', Cambridge University Press, Cambridge 1993&lt;/ref&gt; that Kripke's system indeed leads to contradiction: while its truth predicate is only partial, it does give truth value (true/false) to propositions such as the one built in Tarski's proof, and is therefore inconsistent. While there is still a debate on whether Tarski's proof can be implemented to every similar partial truth system, none have been shown to be consistent by [[Consistency proof|acceptable methods]] used in [[mathematical logic]].

===Revision theory of truth===
{{Main|Revision theory#Truth}}

The revision theory of truth, as developed by Anil Gupta and Nuel Belnap, takes truth to be a circular concept whose definition is the set of biconditionals of the form
:'A' is true if and only if A.&lt;ref&gt;Gupta and Belnap (1993).&lt;/ref&gt;
Unlike Kripke's theory of truth, revision theory can be used with classical logic and can maintain the principle of bivalence.

==Folk beliefs about truth==
The [[truth predicate]] "''P'' is true" has great practical value in human language, allowing us to ''efficiently'' endorse or impeach claims made by others, to emphasize the truth or falsity of a statement, or to enable various indirect ([[Gricean]]) conversational implications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Scharp|first1=Kevin|title=Replacing truth|date=2013|publisher=Oxford Univ.

* [[Law of noncontradiction|Noncontradiction]]: A statement can't be both true and false
* Normativity: It is usually good to believe what is true
* False beliefs: The notion that believing a statement doesn't necessarily make it true

Like many folk theories, our folk theory of truth is useful in everyday life but, upon deep analysis, turns out to be technically self-contradictory; in particular, any [[formal system]] that fully obeys Capture and Release semantics for truth (also known as the ''[[T-schema]]''), and that also respects classical logic, is provably [[inconsistent]] and succumbs to the [[liar paradox]] or to a similar contradiction.&lt;ref&gt;Bueno, Otávio, and Mark Colyvan.

==Notable views==

===Ancient history===
The ancient [[Greek language|Greek]] origins of the words "true" and "truth" have some consistent definitions throughout great spans of history that were often associated with topics of [[logic]], [[geometry]], [[mathematics]], [[Deductive reasoning|deduction]], [[inductive reasoning|induction]], and [[natural philosophy]].

[[Socrates]]', [[Plato]]'s and [[Aristotle]]'s ideas about truth are seen by some as consistent with correspondence theory. In his ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]'', Aristotle stated:  "To say of what is that it is not, or of what is not that it is, is false, while to say of what is that it is, and of what is not that it is not, is true".&lt;ref name=StanfordCorr&gt;David, Marion (2005). [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/truth-correspondence/#1 "Correspondence Theory of Truth"] in [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] proceeds to say of Aristotle:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[...] Aristotle sounds much more like a genuine correspondence theorist in the ''Categories'' (12b11, 14b14), where he talks of "underlying things" that make statements true and implies that these "things" (pragmata) are logically structured situations or facts (viz., his sitting, his not sitting). Most influential is his claim in ''De Interpretatione'' (16a3) that thoughts are "likenesses" (homoiosis) of things. Although he nowhere defines truth in terms of a thought's likeness to a thing or fact, it is clear that such a definition would fit well into his overall philosophy of mind. [...]&lt;ref name=StanfordCorr/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Very similar statements can also be found in Plato (Cratylus 385b2, Sophist 263b).&lt;ref name=StanfordCorr/&gt;

In [[Hinduism]], Truth is defined as "unchangeable", "that which has no distortion", "that which is beyond distinctions of time, space, and person", "that which pervades the universe in all its constancy". The human body, therefore is not completely true as it changes with time, for example. There are many references, properties and explanations of truth by Hindu sages that explain varied facets of truth, such as the national motto of [[India]]: "[[Satyameva Jayate]]" (Truth alone wins), as well as "Satyam muktaye" (Truth liberates), "Satya' is 'Parahit'artham' va'unmanaso yatha'rthatvam' satyam" (Satya is the benevolent use of words and the mind for the welfare of others or in other words responsibilities is truth too), "When one is firmly established in speaking truth, the fruits of action become subservient to him ( patanjali yogasutras, sutra number 2.36 ), "The face of truth is covered by a golden bowl. ''Unveil it, O Pusan (Sun), so that I who have truth as my duty (satyadharma) may see it!''" (Brhadaranyaka V 15 1–4 and the brief IIsa Upanisad 15–18), Truth is superior to silence ([[Manusmriti]]), etc. Combined with other words, satya acts as modifier, like "'''ultra'''" or "'''highest'''," or more literally "'''truest'''," connoting '''purity and excellence'''. For example, satyaloka is the "highest heaven' and Satya Yuga is the "golden age" or best of the four cyclical cosmic ages in Hinduism, and so on.

===Middle Ages===

====Avicenna (980–1037)====
In [[early Islamic philosophy]], [[Avicenna]] (Ibn Sina) defined truth in his work [[Kitab Al-Shifa]] ''[[The Book of Healing]]'', Book I, Chapter 8, as:

''{{quote|What corresponds in the mind to what is outside it.&lt;ref&gt;Osman Amin (2007), "Influence of Muslim Philosophy on the West", ''Monthly Renaissance'' '''17''' (11).&lt;/ref&gt;}}''

[[Avicenna]] elaborated on his definition of truth later in Book VIII, Chapter 6:

''{{Quote|The truth of a thing is the property of the being of each thing which has been established in it.&lt;ref name=Aertsen&gt;Jan A. Aertsen (1988), ''Nature and Creature: Thomas Aquinas's Way of Thought'', p. 152. Brill, {{ISBN|90-04-08451-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}''

However, this definition is merely a rendering of the [[medieval]] Latin translation of the work by Simone van Riet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
| author = Simone van Riet
| title = Liber de philosophia prima, sive Scientia divina
| page = 413
| language = Latin}}&lt;/ref&gt; A modern translation of the original Arabic text states:

''{{quote|Truth is also said of the veridical belief in the existence [of something]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

| isbn = 978-0-934893-77-0
}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Aquinas (1225–1274)====
Reevaluating Avicenna, and also Augustine and Aristotle, [[Thomas Aquinas]] stated in his ''Disputed Questions on Truth'':

{{quote|A natural thing, being placed between two intellects, is called ''true'' insofar as it conforms to either. It is said to be true with respect to its conformity with the divine intellect insofar as it fulfills the end to which it was ordained by the divine intellect... With respect to its conformity with a human intellect, a thing is said to be true insofar as it is such as to cause a true estimate about itself.&lt;ref&gt;''Disputed Questions on Truth'', 1, 2, c, reply to Obj. 1. Trans. Mulligan, McGlynn, Schmidt, ''Truth'', vol. I, pp. 10–12.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Thus, for Aquinas, the truth of the human intellect (logical truth) is based on the truth in things (ontological truth).&lt;ref&gt;"Veritas supra ens fundatur" (Truth is founded on being). ''Disputed Questions on Truth'', 10, 2, reply to Obj. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Following this, he wrote an elegant re-statement of Aristotle's view in his [http://www.newadvent.org/summa/1016.htm Summa I.16.1]:

{{quote|Veritas est adæquatio intellectus et rei. &lt;br&gt; (Truth is the conformity of the intellect and things.)}}  Aquinas also said that real things participate in the act of being of the [[God|Creator God]] who is Subsistent Being, Intelligence, and Truth. Thus, these beings possess the light of intelligibility and are knowable. These things (beings; [[reality]]) are the foundation of the truth that is found in the human mind, when it acquires knowledge of things, first through the [[sense]]s, then through the [[understanding]] and the [[judgement]] done by [[reason]]. For Aquinas, human [[intelligence]] ("intus", within and "legere", to read) has the capability to reach the [[essence]] and [[existence]] of things because it has a non-material, [[Spirituality|spiritual]] element, although some moral, educational, and other elements might interfere with its capability.

====Changing concepts of truth in the Middle Ages====
[[Richard Firth Green]] examined the concept of truth in the later Middle Ages in his ''A Crisis of Truth'', and concludes that roughly during the reign of [[Richard II of England]] the very meaning of the concept changes. The idea of the oath, which was so much part and parcel of for instance [[Romance (heroic literature)|Romance literature]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rock|first=Catherine A.|year=2006|title=Forsworn and Fordone: Arcite as Oath-Breaker in the "Knight's Tale"|journal=[[The Chaucer Review]]|volume=40|issue=4|pages=416–32|jstor=25094334|doi=10.1353/cr.2006.0009}}&lt;/ref&gt; changes from a subjective concept to a more objective one (in [[Derek Pearsall]]'s summary).&lt;ref name=pearsall&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pearsall|first=Derek|year=2004|title=Medieval Literature and Historical Enquiry|journal=[[Modern Language Review]]|volume=99|issue=4|pages=xxxi–xlii|jstor=3738608|doi=10.2307/3738608}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas truth (the "trouthe" of ''[[Sir Gawain and the Green Knight]]'') was first "an ethical truth in which truth is understood to reside in persons", in Ricardian England it "transforms...into a [[political truth]] in which truth is understood to reside in documents".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fowler|first=Elizabeth|year=2003|title=Rev. of Green, ''A Crisis of Truth''|journal=[[Speculum (journal)|Speculum]]|volume=78|issue=1|pages=179–82|jstor=3301477|doi=10.1017/S0038713400099310}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern age===

====Kant (1724–1804)====
[[File:Immanuel Kant (painted portrait).jpg|thumb|[[Immanuel Kant]]]]

[[Immanuel Kant]] endorses a definition of truth along the lines of the correspondence theory of truth.&lt;ref name=StanfordCorr/&gt; Kant writes in the ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'': "The nominal definition of truth, namely that it is the agreement of cognition with its object, is here granted and presupposed".&lt;ref name = "Kant-1781"&gt;Kant, Immanuel (1781/1787), ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]''. Translated and edited by Paul Guyer and Allen W. Wood (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1998), A58/B82.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Kant denies that this correspondence definition of truth provides us with a test or criterion to establish which judgements are true. Kant states in his logic lectures:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[...] Truth, it is said, consists in the agreement of cognition with its object. In consequence of this mere nominal definition, my cognition, to count as true, is supposed to agree with its object. Now I can compare the object with my cognition, however, only ''by cognizing it''.&lt;!-- I wonder if the original had this cursive... --&gt; Hence my cognition is supposed to confirm itself, which is far short of being sufficient for truth. For since the object is outside me, the cognition in me, all I can ever pass judgement on is whether my cognition of the object agrees with my cognition of the object.

The ancients called such a circle in explanation a ''diallelon''. And actually the logicians were always reproached with this mistake by the sceptics, who observed that with this definition of truth it is just as when someone makes a statement before a court and in doing so appeals to a witness with whom no one is acquainted, but who wants to establish his credibility by maintaining that the one who called him as witness is an honest man. The accusation was grounded, too. Only the solution of the indicated problem is impossible without qualification and for every man. [...]&lt;ref name = "Kant-1801"&gt;Kant, Immanuel (1801), ''The Jäsche Logic'', in ''Lectures on Logic''. Translated and edited by J. Michael Young (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1992), pp. 557–58.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
This passage makes use of his distinction between nominal and real definitions. A nominal definition explains the meaning of a linguistic expression. A real definition describes the essence of certain [[Object (philosophy)|objects]] and enables us to determine whether any given item falls within the definition.&lt;ref name = "Vanzo-Kant"&gt;Alberto Vanzo, "Kant on the Nominal Definition of Truth", ''Kant-Studien'', 101 (2010), pp. 147–66.&lt;/ref&gt; Kant holds that the definition of truth is merely nominal and, therefore, we cannot employ it to establish which judgements are true. According to Kant, the ancient skeptics were critical of the logicians for holding that, by means of a merely nominal definition of truth, they can establish which judgements are true. They were trying to do something that is "impossible without qualification and for every man".&lt;ref name = "Kant-1801" /&gt;

====Hegel (1770–1831)====
[[Georg Hegel]] distanced his philosophy from psychology by presenting truth as being an external self-moving object instead of being related to inner, subjective thoughts. Hegel's truth is analogous to the [[mechanics]] of a material body in motion under the influence of its own inner force. "Truth is its own self-movement within itself."&lt;ref&gt;"Die Wahrheit ist die Bewegung ihrer an ihr selbst." ''[[The Phenomenology of Spirit]]'', Preface, ¶ 48&lt;/ref&gt; Teleological truth moves itself in the three-step form of [[Dialectic|dialectical triplicity]] toward the final goal of perfect, final, absolute truth. According to Hegel, the progression of philosophical truth is a resolution of past oppositions into increasingly more accurate approximations of absolute truth. [[Heinrich Moritz Chalybäus|Chalybäus]] used the terms "[[Thesis, antithesis, synthesis|thesis]]", "[[Thesis, antithesis, synthesis|antithesis]]", and "[[Thesis, antithesis, synthesis|synthesis]]" to describe Hegel's dialectical triplicity.  The "thesis" consists of an incomplete historical movement. To resolve the incompletion, an "antithesis" occurs which opposes the "thesis." In turn, the "synthesis" appears when the "thesis" and "antithesis" become [[Aufheben|reconciled]] and a higher level of truth is obtained. This "synthesis" thereby becomes a "thesis," which will again necessitate an "antithesis," requiring a new "synthesis" until a final state is reached as the result of reason's historical movement. History is the [[Absolute (philosophy)|Absolute Spirit]] moving toward a goal. This historical progression will finally conclude itself when the Absolute Spirit understands its own infinite self at the very end of history. Absolute Spirit will then be the complete expression of an infinite [[God]].

====Schopenhauer (1788–1860)====
For [[Arthur Schopenhauer]],&lt;ref&gt;''On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason'', §§ 29–33&lt;/ref&gt; a [[judgment]] is a combination or separation of two or more [[concept]]s. If a judgment is to be an expression of [[knowledge]], it must have a [[Principle of sufficient reason|sufficient reason]] or ground by which the judgment could be called true. ''Truth is the reference of a judgment to something different from itself which is its sufficient reason (ground)''. Judgments can have material, formal, transcendental, or metalogical truth. A judgment has ''material'' truth if its concepts are based on intuitive perceptions that are generated from sensations. If a judgment has its reason (ground) in another judgment, its truth is called logical or ''formal''. If a judgment, of, for example, pure mathematics or pure science, is based on the forms (space, time, causality) of intuitive, empirical knowledge, then the judgment has ''transcendental'' truth.

====Kierkegaard (1813–1855)====
When [[Søren Kierkegaard]], as his character ''Johannes Climacus'', ends his writings: ''My thesis was, subjectivity, heartfelt is the truth'', he does not advocate for [[subjectivism]] in its extreme form (the theory that something is true simply because one believes it to be so), but rather that the objective approach to matters of personal truth cannot shed any light upon that which is most essential to a person's life. Objective truths are concerned with the facts of a person's being, while subjective truths are concerned with a person's way of being. Kierkegaard agrees that objective truths for the study of subjects like mathematics, science, and history are relevant and necessary, but argues that objective truths do not shed any light on a person's inner relationship to existence. At best, these truths can only provide a severely narrowed perspective that has little to do with one's actual experience of life.&lt;ref&gt;Kierkegaard, Søren. ''Concluding Unscientific Postscript''. Princeton, Princeton University Press, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

While objective truths are final and static, subjective truths are continuing and dynamic. The truth of one's existence is a living, inward, and subjective experience that is always in the process of becoming. The values, morals, and spiritual approaches a person adopts, while not denying the existence of objective truths of those beliefs, can only become truly known when they have been inwardly appropriated through subjective experience. Thus, Kierkegaard criticizes all systematic philosophies which attempt to know life or the truth of existence via theories and objective knowledge about reality. As Kierkegaard claims, human truth is something that is continually occurring, and a human being cannot find truth separate from the subjective experience of one's own existing, defined by the values and fundamental essence that consist of one's way of life.&lt;ref&gt;Watts, Michael. ''Kierkegaard'', Oxford: Oneworld Publications, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

====Nietzsche (1844–1900)====
[[Friedrich Nietzsche]] believed the search for truth, or 'the will to truth', was a consequence of the ''[[will to power]]'' of philosophers. He thought that truth should be used as long as it promoted life and the ''will to power'', and he thought untruth was better than truth if it had this life enhancement as a consequence. As he wrote in ''[[Beyond Good and Evil]]'', "The falseness of a judgment is to us not necessarily an objection to a judgment... The question is to what extent it is life-advancing, life-preserving, species-preserving, perhaps even species-breeding..." (aphorism 4). He proposed the ''will to power'' as a truth only because, according to him, it was the most life-affirming and sincere perspective one could have.

Robert Wicks discusses Nietzsche's basic view of truth as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[...] Some scholars regard Nietzsche's 1873 unpublished essay, "On Truth and Lies in a Nonmoral Sense" ("Über Wahrheit und Lüge im außermoralischen Sinn") as a keystone in his thought. In this essay, Nietzsche rejects the idea of universal constants, and claims that what we call "truth" is only "a mobile army of metaphors, metonyms, and anthropomorphisms." His view at this time is that arbitrariness completely prevails within human experience: concepts originate via the very artistic transference of nerve stimuli into images; "truth" is nothing more than the invention of fixed conventions for merely practical purposes, especially those of repose, security and consistence. [...]&lt;ref&gt;Robert Wicks, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nietzsche/#EarWri187187 Friedrich Nietzsche – Early Writings: 1872–1876], The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy  (Spring 2008 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Separately Nietzsche suggested that an ancient, metaphysical belief in the divinity of Truth lies at the heart of and has served as the foundation for the entire subsequent [[Western intellectual tradition]]: "But you will have gathered what I am getting at, namely, that it is still a metaphysical faith on which our faith in science rests—that even we knowers of today, we godless anti-metaphysicians still take ''our'' fire too, from the flame lit by the thousand-year old faith, the Christian faith which was also Plato's faith, that God is Truth; that Truth is 'Divine'..."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Vf8KETLiKXMC&amp;pg=PA201&amp;lpg=PA201&amp;dq=%22even%20we%20knowers%20of%20today%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22even%20we%20knowers%20of%20today%22&amp;f=false|title=Nietzsche: The Gay Science: With a Prelude in German Rhymes and an Appendix of Songs|first1=Friedrich|last1=Nietzsche|first2=Bernard|last2=Williams|first3=Josefine|last3=Nauckhoff|date=23 August 2001|publisher=Cambridge University Press|via=Google Books|isbn=9780521636452}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=wMzu8j4D1SYC&amp;pg=PA112&amp;lpg=PA112&amp;dq=%22even%20we%20knowers%20of%20today%22#v=onepage&amp;q=god%20is%20truth&amp;f=false|title=Nietzsche: 'On the Genealogy of Morality' and Other Writings Student Edition|first=Friedrich|last=Nietzsche|date=30 October 2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|via=Google Books|isbn=9781139461214}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Heidegger (1889–1976)====
Other philosophers take this common meaning to be secondary and derivative. According to [[Martin Heidegger]], the original meaning and [[essence]] of truth in [[Ancient Greece]] was unconcealment, or the revealing or bringing of what was previously hidden into the open, as indicated by the original Greek term for truth, ''[[aletheia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;http://aphelis.net/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/Martin-Heidegger-On-the-Essence-of-Truth.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ontology.co/heidegger-aletheia.htm|title=Martin Heidegger on Aletheia (Truth) as Unconcealment|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On this view, the conception of truth as correctness is a later derivation from the concept's original essence, a development Heidegger traces to the [[Latin]] term ''[[veritas]]''.

====Whitehead (1861–1947)====
[[Alfred North Whitehead]], a British mathematician who became an American philosopher, said: "There are no whole truths; all truths are half-truths. It is trying to treat them as whole truths that plays the devil".&lt;ref&gt;Alfred North Whitehead, ''Dialogues'', 1954: Prologue.&lt;/ref&gt;

The logical progression or connection of this line of thought is to conclude that truth can lie, since [[half-truth]]s are deceptive and may lead to a false conclusion.

====Peirce (1839–1914)====
[[Pragmatists]] like [[C. S. Peirce]] take truth to have some manner of essential relation to human practices for inquiring into and [[discovering]] truth, with Peirce himself holding that truth is what human [[inquiry]] would find out on a matter, if our practice of inquiry were taken as far as it could profitably go: "The opinion which is fated to be ultimately agreed to by all who investigate, is what we mean by the truth..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peirce.org/writings/p119.html|title=How to Make Our Ideas Clear|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Nishida (1870–1945)====
According to [[Kitaro Nishida]], "knowledge of things in the world begins with the differentiation of unitary consciousness into knower and known and ends with self and things becoming one again. Such unification takes form not only in knowing but in the valuing (of truth) that directs knowing, the willing that directs action, and the feeling or emotive reach that directs sensing."&lt;ref&gt;John Maraldo, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/nishida-kitaro/#2.2 Nishida Kitarô – Self-Awareness], in: ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Spring 2005 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fromm (1900–1980)====
[[Erich Fromm]] finds that trying to discuss truth as "absolute truth" is sterile and that emphasis ought to be placed on "optimal truth". He considers truth as stemming from the survival imperative of grasping one's environment physically and intellectually, whereby young children instinctively seek truth so as to orient themselves in "a strange and powerful world". The accuracy of their perceived approximation of the truth will therefore have direct consequences on their ability to deal with their environment. Fromm can be understood to define truth as a functional approximation of reality. His vision of optimal truth is described partly in "Man from Himself: An Inquiry into the Psychology of Ethics" (1947), from which excerpts are included below.

: the dichotomy between 'absolute = perfect' and 'relative = imperfect' has been superseded in all fields of scientific thought, where "it is generally recognized that there is no absolute truth but nevertheless that there are objectively valid laws and principles".

: In that respect, "a scientifically or rationally valid statement means that the power of reason is applied to all the available data of observation without any of them being suppressed or falsified for the sake of a desired result". The history of science is "a history of inadequate and incomplete statements, and every new insight makes possible the recognition of the inadequacies of previous propositions and offers a springboard for creating a more adequate formulation."

: As a result "the history of thought is the history of an ever-increasing approximation to the truth. Scientific knowledge is not absolute but optimal; it contains the optimum of truth attainable in a given historical period." Fromm furthermore notes that "different cultures have emphasized various aspects of the truth" and that increasing interaction between cultures allows for these aspects to reconcile and integrate, increasing further the approximation to the truth.

====Foucault (1926–1984)====
[[File:What-is-truth02.jpg|thumb|''[[John 18:38|Quid Est Veritas?]]'' [[Christ]] and [[Pilate]], by [[Nikolai Ge]].]]

Truth, says [[Michel Foucault]], is problematic when any attempt is made to see truth as an "objective" quality.  He prefers not to use the term truth itself but "Regimes of Truth".  In his historical investigations he found truth to be something that was itself a part of, or embedded within, a given power structure.  Thus Foucault's view shares much in common with the concepts of [[Truth#Nietzsche|Nietzsche]].  Truth for Foucault is also something that shifts through various [[episteme]] throughout history.&lt;ref&gt;Foucault, M. "The Order of Things", London: Vintage Books, 1970 (1966)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Baudrillard (1929–2007)====
[[Jean Baudrillard]] considered truth to be largely simulated, that is pretending to have something, as opposed to dissimulation, pretending to not have something.  He took his cue from [[iconoclasm|iconoclasts]] who he claims knew that images of God demonstrated that God did not exist.&lt;ref name = "Baudrillard"&gt;Jean Baudrillard. Simulacra and Simulation. Michigan: Michigan University Press, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; Baudrillard wrote in "Precession of the Simulacra":
::The [[simulacrum]] is never that which conceals the truth—it is the truth which conceals that there is none.  The simulacrum is true.
::—Ecclesiastes&lt;ref&gt;Baudrillard, Jean. [http://www.stanford.edu/dept/HPS/Baudrillard/Baudrillard_Simulacra.html "Simulacra and Simulations", in ''Selected Writings''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040209024621/http://www.stanford.edu/dept/HPS/Baudrillard/Baudrillard_Simulacra.html |date=2004-02-09 }}, ed. [[Mark Poster]], [[Stanford University Press]], 1988; 166 ''ff''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baudrillard's attribution of this quote to [[Ecclesiastes]] is deliberately fictional. "Baudrillard attributes this quote to Ecclesiastes.  However, the quote is a fabrication (see Jean Baudrillard.  Cool Memories III, 1991–95. London:   Verso, 1997). Editor's note: In Fragments: Conversations With François L'Yvonnet. New York: Routledge, 2004:11, Baudrillard acknowledges this 'Borges-like' fabrication." Cited in footnote #4 in Smith, Richard G., [https://www.ubishops.ca/baudrillardstudies/vol2_1/smith.htm#_edn4 "Lights, Camera, Action: Baudrillard and the Performance of Representations"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180425060347/https://www2.ubishops.ca/baudrillardstudies/vol2_1/smith.htm#_edn4 |date=2018-04-25 }}, International Journal of Baudrillard Studies, Volume 2, Number 1 (January 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

Some examples of simulacra that Baudrillard cited were: that prisons simulate the "truth" that society is free; scandals (e.g., [[Watergate scandal|Watergate]]) simulate that corruption is corrected; Disney simulates that the U.S. itself is an adult place. One must remember that though such examples seem extreme, such extremity is an important part of Baudrillard's theory. For a less extreme example, consider how movies usually end with the bad being punished, humiliated, or otherwise failing, thus affirming for viewers the concept that the good end happily and the bad unhappily, a narrative which implies that the status quo and established power structures are largely legitimate.&lt;ref name = "Baudrillard"/&gt;

==In medicine and psychiatry==
There is controversy as to the truth value of a proposition made in [[bad faith]] self-deception, such as when a [[hypochondriac]] has a complaint with no physical symptom.&lt;ref name=PMREN&gt;"Absent a lesion or a physiological disturbance to account readily for the complaint, the complaint was likely to be regarded as male fide", Post-Modern Reflections on the Ethics of Naming, The Ethics of Diagnosis Philosophy and Medicine, 1992, Volume 40, Section V, 275–300, George Khushf, [http://www.springerlink.com/content/r6735871m3782056/ springerlink.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a [[novel]], [[theatrical]] [[Play (theatre)|script]], [[screenplay]], [[sketch story|sketch stories]], and [[poetry]], a '''vignette''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=en-us-vignette.ogg|v|ɪ|n|ˈ|j|ɛ|t}}, {{small|UK also}} {{IPAc-en|v|ɪ|ˈ|n|ɛ|t}}) is a short impressionistic scene that focuses on one moment or character and gives a trenchant impression about that character, an idea, setting, and/or object.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://100movies100theaters.blogspot.ca/2010/02/top-10-interwoven-vignettes.html|title=100 Movies, 100 Theaters: Top 10 Interwoven Vignettes|website=100movies100theaters.blogspot.ca|access-date=2016-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a short, descriptive passage, more about evoking meaning through imagery than about plot.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.shmoop.com/house-on-mango-street/writing-style.html|title=The House on Mango Street Writing Style|website=www.shmoop.com|access-date=2016-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/vignette|title=vignette Meaning in the Cambridge English Dictionary|website=dictionary.cambridge.org|access-date=2016-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[blog]] or [[web series]] can also provide a form of vignette or be presented as a series of vignettes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://writinginwonderland.blogspot.co.uk/2011/04/vignette-in-literature.html | title=Vignette in Literature | publisher=[[Blogspot]] |work=[writinginwonderland.blogspot.co.uk/ Writing in Wonderland] | date=26 April 2011 | accessdate=18 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this is the critically acclaimed web series ''[[High Maintenance (TV series)|High Maintenance]]'', which presents a different set of characters in each episode, focusing intensely on their specific traits, ideas, and worlds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2013/04/10/high-maintenance|title=High Maintenance|website=Entertainment Weekly's EW.com|access-date=2016-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thecannabist.co/2014/11/12/high-maintenance-vimeo/23089/|title=Five must-reads celebrating the return of series ‘High Maintenance’|last=Baca|first=Ricardo|last2=Staff|first2=The Cannabist|website=The Cannabist|access-date=2016-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2014/11/11/363288754/despite-the-dope-high-maintenance-is-about-more-than-potheads|title=Despite The Dope, 'High Maintenance' Is About More Than Potheads|website=NPR.org|access-date=2016-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/ellenhuet/2014/11/11/vimeo-original-programming-high-maintenance/#4008c623f269|title=Vimeo Takes A Bet On 'High Maintenance' As Its First Original Series|last=Huet|first=Ellen|website=Forbes|access-date=2016-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vignettes are more commonly used and have been particularly influential in the development of the contemporary notions of a [[scene (drama)|scene]] as shown in [[postmodern theater]], [[Postmodernist film|film]] and [[Modern Television|television]], where less emphasis is placed on adhering to the conventions of traditional structure and story development. It is also a part of something bigger than itself: for example, a vignette about a house belonging to a collection of vignettes or a whole story, such as ''[[The House On Mango Street]]'', by [[Sandra Cisneros]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.ca/House-Mango-Street-Sandra-Cisneros/dp/0679734775|title=The House on Mango Street|last=Cisneros|first=Sandra|date=1991-04-03|publisher=Vintage|isbn=9780679734772|edition=Reissue|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
The word ''[[wikt:vignette|vignette]]'' means "little vine" in French,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/vignette|title=Definition of VIGNETTE|website=www.merriam-webster.com|access-date=2016-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the name of the literary form comes from the drawings of little vines that nineteenth-century printers used to decorate the title pages and beginnings of chapters.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
