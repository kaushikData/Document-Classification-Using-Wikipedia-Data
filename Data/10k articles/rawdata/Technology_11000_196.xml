      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5048">A '''DSL loop extender''' is a device that a [[telephone company]] can place between subscriber premises equipment and central office interfaces to extend the distance and increase the [[channel capacity]] of [[digital subscriber line]] (DSL) connections. ADSL repeaters are deployed by rural telephone companies trying to provide [[rural Internet]] service to farms and small towns where it is impractical to place the [[DSLAM]] closer to the subscriber. Typical distance improvements with a loop extender are shown in the diagram below, with rate in megabits per second and distance in thousands of feet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.strowger.com Strowger :: Infinite Reach ADSL]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ADSL Loop Extender.JPG|center]]

Multiple loop extenders can be placed on a line, effectively making the reach of the ADSL signal infinite.  That is, it is possible to reach any subscriber with any ADSL speed if one uses multiple loop extenders.

A [[repeater]] can either be an amplifier or a re-generator.  Amplifiers increase the signal level of the analog transmission signal; re-generators demodulate the signal to binary, then re-modulate it into the original transmission frequency. Because regeneration restores the signal to binary, an indefinite number of re-generators can be placed on a line and is the preferred choice for services like T1 ([[Digital Signal 1]]) that have no distance limits. Because of the simplicity of the amplifier circuits, amplifiers are of lower cost than re-generators.

Before the development of ADSL loop extenders and remote DSLAMs, ADSL was limited to 3–6 miles (5–10&amp;nbsp;km) from the [[telephone exchange|Central Office]] depending on the [[wire gauge]] used.  An ADSL Loop Extender works as an amplifier, boosting the signal level so it can travel longer distances. In some cases, service can now be established as far as 10 miles from the Central Office.

In 2006, US telco promoted [[Fiber to the Home]]. This was driven by a rapidly growing housing sector that was creating the "[[Greenfield project|greenfield]]" customers that are needed to make fiber to the home profitable. Later, with the housing sector in a serious recession, that "greenfield" seems to be drying up fast.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lightreading.com/document.asp?doc_id=146115 Light Reading - Broadband - Carrier Scorecard: Economic Uncertainty - Telecom News Analysis&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; With most of the "[[Brownfield land|brownfield]]" market already tapped for ADSL,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lightreading.com/document.asp?doc_id=139019 Light Reading - Broadband - US Broadband Growth Slows - Telecom News Analysis&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Telcos finally are interested in extending ADSL to those semi-rural areas that have never been important before.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newpa.com/newsDetail.aspx?id=534 NewPA.com : Press Releases&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927010854/http://www.newpa.com/newsDetail.aspx?id=534 |date=September 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the US Federal Government updated the subsidies paid to rural telephone companies so that broadband is subsidized rather than phone service in a program called Connect America Fund.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fcc.gov/encyclopedia/connecting-america Connect America Fund]&lt;/ref&gt; In order to qualify for subsidy, the telephone company must provide 4 mbits downstream and 1 mbit upstream.  This has increased the demand for ADSL loop extenders because loop extenders will allow the telephone companies to reach the most distant subscribers in a way that is more cost effective than deploying remote DSLAMs.

Some ADSL loop extenders aren't repeaters, but instead convert to a different signal (like [[G.shdsl]]) that fares better over extreme distances. This is because G.shdsl can use the lower frequencies that ADSL reserved for voice use.

[[Crosstalk]] has been analyzed using T1.417 Method B and found to be compliant. Since the objective is to provide DSL to locations where no other data service can reach, or is needed (e.g. onto a farm), and ordinary telephone service is very immune to cross talk from ADSL due to ADSL not using voice frequency range, the cross talk issue is further reduced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Nikil Jayant|title=Broadband Last Mile: Access Technologies for Multimedia Communications|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dhujlmN8imkC&amp;pg=PA239|date=2005|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-1-4200-3066-2|page=339}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Converting to [[G.shdsl]] or other technologies has problems too. These technologies have limited downstream speed, thus are less useful except to extend services to the most distant customers. Their many components (special C.O., re-generators, CPE) make them more expensive than ADSL amplifiers.

In February 2013, ''[[Business Insider]]'' estimated that 10% of all smartphones worldwide ran Titanium-built apps.&lt;ref name="business-insider-microsoft"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.businessinsider.com/microsoft-eyes-appcelerator-acquisition-2013-2#ixzz2YmNSFhT7 | title=Microsoft Might Buy A Startup That Powers 10 Percent Of The World's Smartphones | work=[[Business Insider]] | date=1 February 2013 | accessdate=11 July 2013 | author=Julie Bort}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2017}}, Titanium had amassed over 950,000 developer registrations.&lt;ref name="appc-2017"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.appcelerator.com/ | title=Appcelerator | work=[[Appcelerator]] | date=7 May 2017 | accessdate=7 May 2017 | author=Appcelerator}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The core component of Titanium is the [[Apache License|Apache-licensed]] [[software development kit]], Titanium SDK. Appcelerator also makes Alloy, an Apache-licensed, Titanium-based [[model–view–controller]] framework, and Appcelerator Studio a [[proprietary software|proprietary]] [[integrated development environment]] starting for free.

==Architecture==
The core features of Titanium SDK include:
* A cross-platform API for accessing native UI components such as navigation bars, menus, and dialog boxes and native device functionality including the file system, network, [[geolocation]], accelerometer, and maps.
* Transparent access to native functionality covered by Hyperloop and native modules.
* MVC-based framework Alloy

All application source code gets deployed to the mobile device where it is [[interpreter (computing)|interpreted]]&lt;ref&gt;http://developer.appcelerator.com/question/45001/is-appcelerator-titanium-mobile-really-a-cross-compiler&lt;/ref&gt; using a [[JavaScript engine]]; Mozilla's [[Rhino (JavaScript engine)|Rhino]] is used on Android and BlackBerry, and Apple's [[JavascriptCore]] is used on iOS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://developer.appcelerator.com/blog/2010/12/titanium-guides-project-js-environment.html|title=Titanium Guides Project: JS Environment|quote=Titanium runs your application's JavaScript using one of two JavaScript interpreters – JavaScriptCore on iOS (the interpreter used by Webkit) and Mozilla Rhino on Android and BlackBerry.|author=Kevin Whinnery|publisher=Appcelerator}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 it was announced that a port to Google's [[V8 (JavaScript engine)|V8 JavaScript engine]] is in development which, when complete, will significantly improve performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://developer.appcelerator.com/blog/2011/09/platform-engineering-android-runtime-performance-improvements.html|title=Platform Engineering: Android Runtime Performance Improvements|publisher=Appcelerator|author=Don Thorp|date=2011-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Program loading takes longer than it does for programs developed with the native SDKs, as the interpreter and all required libraries must be loaded before interpreting the source code on the device can begin.

Titanium does much more than just build apps that run on multiple platforms. Its true power comes from how it helps in developing ''best of breed''{{Citation needed|reason=This claim reads like an advertisement for the platform without providing any substantial evidence of purported 'best of breed' applications.|date=March 2018}}, ''native'' apps that take full advantage of the platforms on which they run. It enables:
* Use of hardware-specific features, such as the Android menu button
* Use of OS-specific controls, such as the Cocoa UI controls on iOS
* Participate in the platform ecosystem, for example using platform-appropriate notification mechanisms

==History==
When it was introduced in December 2008, Titanium was intended for developing cross-platform desktop applications and was sometimes compared to [[Adobe Integrated Runtime|Adobe Air]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.techcrunch.com/2008/12/09/appcelerator-raises-41-million-for-open-source-ria-platform/|title= Appcelerator Raises $4.1 Million for Open Source RIA Platform|publisher= Techcrunch|date=9 December 2008|accessdate=29 October 2009 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091102082958/http://www.techcrunch.com/2008/12/09/appcelerator-raises-41-million-for-open-source-ria-platform/| archivedate= 2 November 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.eweek.com/c/a/Application-Development/Appcelerator-Takes-on-Adobe-AIR-with-Titanium/|title= Appcelerator Takes On Adobe AIR with Titanium|publisher=eWeek|date=9 December 2008|accessdate=29 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it added support for developing iPhone and Android mobile applications in June 2009, and in 2012, Titanium Desktop was spun off into a separate, community-driven project named [[TideSDK]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://developer.appcelerator.com/blog/2012/01/the-future-of-titanium-desktop.html Appcelerator Developer Blog - The Future of Titanium Desktop]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.infoworld.com/d/developer-world/appcelerator-enables-iphone-android-app-dev-655 |title=Appcelerator enables iPhone, Android app dev |publisher=InfoWorld |date=8 June 2009 |accessdate=29 October 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091121063423/http://www.infoworld.com/d/developer-world/appcelerator-enables-iphone-android-app-dev-655 |archivedate=21 November 2009 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; Support for developing iPad-based tablet apps was added in April 2010.&lt;ref name=mashable&gt;{{Cite web | url =http://mashable.com/2010/04/05/titanium-tablet-sdk/|title =Appcelerator Simplifies iPad App Development | date= 5 April 2010 |accessdate=6 April 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100407122653/http://mashable.com/2010/04/05/titanium-tablet-sdk/| archivedate= 7 April 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; BlackBerry support was announced on June 2010,&lt;ref&gt;http://blackberryrocks.com/2010/05/06/appcelerator-announces-titanium-mobile-beta-support-blackberry-news/&lt;/ref&gt; and has been in beta since April 2013. Tizen support was also added in April 2013 with the 3.1.0 Titanium Studio and SDK releases. The latest addition to the platform in 2016 has been Hyperloop, a technology to access native API's on iOS, Android and Windows with JavaScript.&lt;ref name=hyperloop&gt;{{Cite web | url =http://www.appcelerator.com/blog/2016/08/hyperloop-is-here/ |title =Appcelerator Simplifies iPad App Development | date= 11 August 2016 | accessdate=7 May 2017 | author=Jeff Haynie}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2010, Appcelerator expanded the Titanium product line with the Titanium Tablet SDK. The Titanium Tablet SDK draws heavily from the existing support for iPhone, but it also includes native support for iPad-only user interface controls such as split views and popovers. Initially the mobile SDK only supported development for iPad, but support now includes Android-based tablets as well.

In June 2011, Appcelerator released Studio and Titanium Mobile 1.7.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Perez|first=Sarah|title=Appcelerator Launches Titanium Studio: Mobile, Desktop &amp; Web Development in One|url=http://www.readwriteweb.com/mobile/2011/06/appcelerator-launches-titanium-studio-mobile-desktop-web-development-in-one.php|publisher=ReadWriteWeb|date=14 June 2011|accessdate=14 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studio is a full open standards IDE that is derived from Aptana Studio which Appcelerator acquired in January 2011.

In June 2013, Jeff Haynie, Appcelerator's CEO, announced that the company had begun Ti.Next, a project to rewrite the Titanium SDK in Javascript for improved performance and to bring Titanium's end users, who write in Javascript, closer to the internal code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Ti.Next: What's It All About? Appcelerator, Part 2 of 2 | work=[[InfoQ]] | date=10 August 2013 | author=Martin Monroe}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a blog post, he wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;We believe JavaScript should be the right language to build Titanium, not just apps on top of the Titanium SDK. With Ti.Next, we've created a small [[microkernel]] design that will allow us to have minimal bootstrap code in the native language ([[C (programming language)|C]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[C sharp (programming language)|C#]], etc) that talks to a common set of [[compiler]]s, tools and a single JavaScript [[virtual machine|Virtual Machine]]. We have found a way to make the [[WebKit]] [[KJS (KDE)|KJS]] {{abbr|VM|virtual machine}} work on multiple platforms instead of using different VMs per platform. This means we can heavily optimize the microkernel (herein after called the "TiRuntime") and maintenance, optimizations and profiling can be greatly simplified. We're talking about {{abbr|~5K|about 5,000}} {{abbr|LOC|lines of code}} vs. 100K LOC per platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.appcelerator.com/blog/2013/07/thoughts-on-ti-next/ | title=Thoughts on Ti.Next | date=3 July 2013 | accessdate=4 February 2014 | author=Jeff Haynie}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In January 2016, Appcelerator was acquired by [[Axway Software|Axway]], a global software company with more than 11,000 public- and private-sector customers in 100 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.appcelerator.com/blog/2016/01/axway-acquires-appcelerator-and-why-this-is-great-news-for-all/ | title=Axway Acquires Appcelerator—And Why This is Great News for All | date=17 January 2016 | accessdate=5 May 2017 | author=Jeff Haynie}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the  Indie plans have been made free again, including native API access with Hyperloop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.appcelerator.com/blog/2017/05/free-plan-announcement/ | title=Appcelerator Indie Plans Are Now Free!

==History==
The Armed Forces Financial Network was founded in 1985 at the request of the [[United States Army]] to support the "Surepay" [[direct deposit]] initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|url=http://www.affn.org/about-us|website=www.affn.org|accessdate=19 January 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180119060705/http://www.affn.org/about-us|archivedate=19 January 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The AFFN's role in the Surepay initiative was to be one way U.S. military personnel could gain access to their money.

In 2017 the Armed Forces Financial Network launched a chip and pin travel card.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Armed Forces Financial Network Launches Travel Card - Association of Military Banks of America|url=http://www.ambahq.org/members-section/armed-forces-financial-network-launches-travel-card/|website=Association of Military Banks of America|accessdate=19 January 2018|date=6 August 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180119175425/http://www.ambahq.org/members-section/armed-forces-financial-network-launches-travel-card/|archivedate=19 January 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10284">'''Baking''' (verb), also known as 'cooking' is a [[Cosmetics|make-up]] technique originally used in [[Drag queen|Drag]], now popularised by  celebrities and [[make-up artist]]s. This technique includes applying a heavy amount of translucent [[Face powder|powder]] under the [[eye]]s and on the high points of the [[face]], including the 'T' zone, to set the base [[Cosmetics|make-up]]. It is also used to extract oils from your face.

This technique can be used on a variety of different skin types and shades.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bustle.com/articles/118632-7-baking-makeup-tutorials-to-watch-because-this-technique-is-important-videos|title=Bustle|website=www.bustle.com|access-date=2016-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; To highlight the under eye area and high points of the face such as the cheek bones, the bridge of the [[nose]], the [[chin]] and the [[forehead]]. The effects of the [[Face powder|powder]] are to soak up facial oils and to help the [[Foundation (cosmetics)|foundation]] melt into the [[skin]]. This prevents creasing in the baked areas while maximising coverage and longevity of the [[Cosmetics|make-up]] to leave the face looking matte.

== Background ==

=== Brief History ===
The [[Cosmetics|cosmetic]] technique of baking is a "very old [[Cosmetics|make-up]] technique"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.glamour.com/lipstick/blogs/girls-in-the-beauty-department/2015/07/makeup-artist-mario-dedivanovi|title=What Is "Baking" and Do You Need It in Your Life?|last=Magazine|first=Glamour|website=Glamour|access-date=2016-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; that may be traced back to times such as [[Ancient Egypt]] and the early [[Victorian era]].

The use of make-up can be traced back to times as early as [[Ancient Egypt]]. High class members of Egyptian society would use make-up to display their wealth, beliefs and positions within the community. Cosmetics were regarded as a symbol of high status and a sign of holiness and were often a major part of the [[burial ceremony]] along with [[jewellery]].

Although, [[Egyptians]] are renowned for heavy [[eye]] make-up, facial products were also used but were mainly focused on [[cheek]]s.

Despite the fact that [[Cosmetics|make-up]] developed over time it remained an ideological concept of wealth and a display of class. In the lead up and throughout the early [[Victorian era]] [[cosmetics]] took aspects from [[Ancient Egypt]] and began to be used by [[Actor|actresses]] and [[Prostitution|prostitutes]] to define the [[face]] and eyes, however this was condemned by [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]] who described the type of dark [[Cosmetics|make-up]] as 'vulgar'.

From the [[Renaissance]] up until the [[20th century]] the lower classes predominately worked outside in jobs such as [[Agriculture|agricultural]] work, therefore, the stereotypical light-coloured [[British people|British]] [[skin]] was darkened by exposure to the [[sun]], this created the trend of 'pale faces' in mainland [[Europe]]. This type of cosmetic technique was used especially by [[royal family|royalty]] and the higher classes to segregate them from the poor. The whiter the [[complexion]], the higher the class and nobility of the person. Consequently why [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]] is famous for her pale skin.

=== Popularisation ===
Baking was brought into the spotlight by celebrities such as [[Kim Kardashian]] whose [[make-up artist]], [http://www.makeupbymario.com/ Mario Dedivanovic] uses the technique to set the famous [[Keeping Up with the Kardashians|Kardashian's]] [[Cosmetics|make-up]] for events. He argues that this practice shouldn't be used every day and he only uses it for [[Celebrity|celebrities]] that like "a very dramatic, long lasting, matte finish to the [[face]]" or if he is working on [[Performing arts|stage performers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.glamour.com/lipstick/blogs/girls-in-the-beauty-department/2015/07/makeup-artist-mario-dedivanovi|title=What Is "Baking" and Do You Need It in Your Life?|last=Magazine|first=Glamour|website=Glamour|access-date=2016-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; This technique was also brought into light with the increased visibility of the [[Drag queen|drag community]] following the popular [[Television program|television show]] [[RuPaul's Drag Race]]. The technique of baking can be seen throughout the episodes when the [[Drag queen|queens]] are in the 'work room' preparing for the [[Runway (fashion)|runway]]. Baking isn't just used for [[Drag queen|drag]] performers, it has been adopted by many [[make-up artist]]s and is now used throughout [[Special-effects makeup|special effects]] [[Cosmetics|make-up]] to set [[Bruise|bruising]] and cuts so that the products applied to the [[face]] melt in seamlessly and look as realistic as possible.

This tecnhnique was then popularised further by many [[bloggers]] and [[vloggers]] who have created videos and pages, teaching [[Cosmetics|make-up]] enthusiasts and the general public how to bake or cook their [[face]]. This type of [[tutorial]] has taken over [[social media]] sites such as [[YouTube|Youtube]] and [[Instagram]], bringing baking into the mainstream as a new internet 'buzzword'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://stylecaster.com/beauty/cooking-makeup/|title=The "Baking" or "Cooking" Makeup Trend Has Nothing to Do With Your Kitchen|website=StyleCaster|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; These such videos have gathered thousands of views, one of the most popular tutorials, by Heidi Hamoud,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Heidi Hamoud|title=Perfect Under Eye Highlight, NO CREASING + Baking Explained!|date=2015-04-09|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_EgD31_XcSE|accessdate=2016-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; managed to gain over 2 millions views since its upload in April 2015.

Someone who has taken this technique directly from the [[Drag queen|drag]] community, into the [[social media]] and [[Cosmetics|make-up]] [[tutorial]] scene, is [[Miss Fame]]. A [[RuPaul's Drag Race (season 7)|season 7]] contestant on [[RuPaul's Drag Race|RuPaul's drag race]], who is now planning a [[Cosmetics|make-up]] tour&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://missfamenyc.bigcartel.com/|title=Miss Fame NYC — Home|website=missfamenyc.bigcartel.com|access-date=2016-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; where she plans to teach people the art of 'painting', a term used in the [[Drag queen|drag]] community to refer to 'making up'. [[Miss Fame]] features heavily on [[YouTube|Youtube]], not only with her own channel of tutorials and how to guides but also throughout other 'beauty gurus' channels where she 'paints' them and provides viewers with tips and tricks from the drag community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cosmopolitan.co.uk/beauty-hair/makeup/tips/a37663/beauty-tips-rupauls-drag-race/|title=8 actually really great beauty tips from RuPaul|date=2015-08-03|website=Cosmopolitan|access-date=2016-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Products and tools ==
* [[Concealer]] (for the best results use a concealer lighter than your [[Human skin color|skin tone]])
* Loose setting [[Face powder|powder]] (ideally translucent)
* Beauty/[[Cosmetics|make-up]] sponge
* [[Makeup brush|Make-up brush]] (a fluffy brush)

== Uses ==
As seen above there are different ways in which one can bake the face. [http://jamiemakeup.com/ Jamie Greenberg], a [[make-up artist]],said that baking falls under the umbrella of [[contouring]], which includes highlighting and shading.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://stylecaster.com/beauty/cooking-makeup/|title=The "Baking" or "Cooking" Makeup Trend Has Nothing to Do With Your Kitchen|website=StyleCaster|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore baking can be used alongside [[contouring]] as a non-shimmery form of highlighting to emphasize the higher points of the [[face]]. Paired with [[contouring]], it can also work to give the illusion of definition. Baking directly underneath the [[Contouring|contour]] on the cheekbones can create a more crisp and clean [[Contouring|contour]]. Paired with a highlighter or a strobing cream or powder, baking can set a base for a highlight, as well as intensifying it.

Baking is used by many [[Performing arts|performers]] as it increases the longevity of the [[Cosmetics|make-up]], meaning it will not easily melt or rub off during [[performance]]s. This technique is utilised by many [[make-up artist]]s for [[Celebrity|celebrities]] and [[Model (people)|models]] as "a way to set your make-up when standing under hot lights",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://stylecaster.com/beauty/cooking-makeup/|title=The "Baking" or "Cooking" Makeup Trend Has Nothing to Do With Your Kitchen|website=StyleCaster|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; as it reduces the need for touch-ups. It also increases the coverage of the [[Cosmetics|make-up]] giving a more poreless and flawless, matte finish to the [[face]], something which works well for [[Celebrity|celebrities]] and [[Performing arts|performers]] especially when flash [[photography]] is being used.

Baking can also be used as a form of [[Color correction|colour correction]]. People tend to get dark circles under their [[eye]]s, baking this area is said to reduce the appearance of dark circles as the light shade and brightness from the [[Face powder|powder]] or [[concealer]] can counteract the darkness around the eyes. People often bake their under [[eye]]s to reduce dark circles and also to prevent creasing in their fine lines and [[wrinkle]]s, especially in the under [[eye]] area. Although, many [[make-up artist]]s argue this isn't a good technique for [[ageing]] [[skin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mimichatter.com/baking-method-might-be-new-contouring-1228556633.html|title=This Cooking-Inspired Makeup Trend Might Be Taking Over Contouring|last=Militare|first=Jessie|website=MIMI|access-date=2016-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, [[make-up artist]]s&lt;nowiki/&gt; also use baking for practical reasons. For example, when applying [[eye shadow]], they often bake under the [[eye]]s to catch any [[eye shadow]] that may fall down onto the [[face]] from its application, allowing the product to be easily [[Makeup brush|brushed]] away with the excess [[Face powder|powder]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7655">[[File:Praha-Klánovice, zatopený starý podchod (03).jpg|thumb|Red-and-white warning tape marking off an unsafe route]]
'''Barricade tape''' is brightly colored [[Flagging (tape)|tape]] (often incorporating a two-tone pattern of alternating yellow-black or red-white stripes or the words "Caution" or "Danger" in prominent lettering) that is used to warn or catch the attention of passersby of an area or situation containing a possible hazard. It acts as a minor impediment to prevent accidental entrance to that area or situation and as a result enhances general safety. 
Barricade tape is also known as '''construction tape''' or '''barrier tape''' or in reference to the safety hazard involved as '''caution tape''', '''warning tape''', '''danger tape''' or '''hazard tape'''. When used by a police force, the tape is named '''police tape'''.

The tape is often wrapped and affixed as a visual [[warning sign]] and demarcation, for instance against entering a dangerous area, such as an industrial or commercial building site, a [[roadworks]] [[construction]] site or the scene of an [[accident]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.indiana.edu/~libpres/manual/materials/cautape.html Caution Tape]&lt;/ref&gt; or a crime (for [[crime scene preservation]]), or against handling inoperative [[machinery]] or [[home appliance|appliances]].

== Description ==

Barricade tape is made with durable, resilient, tear-proof [[plastic]] materials such as polyethylene, polypropylene, or nylon. It is at least 2&amp;nbsp;mm thick and 3 inches wide.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} However, different manufacturers offer different sizes and thicknesses of barricade tape. Other common sizes of barricade tape are 2, 4 or 6 inches wide and 4 or 10&amp;nbsp;mm thick.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

Barricade tape often has a bright background and pre-printed bold warning text. It is also possible to purchase plain barricade tape and write a custom message on it. However, care should be taken when using custom tape, as all barricade tape designs are required to comply with [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] (OSHA) and [[American National Standards Institute]] (ANSI) regulations (when used for purposes subject to regulation by these organizations).

== Types ==
[[File:Airmen team up to build shelter 120413-F-UP124-080.jpg|thumb|Police tape marking off a crime scene]]
Barricade tape is used according to the color specifications set by OSHA and ANSI. Barricade tape may be use primarily as a safety precaution for various industries and procedures.

'''Construction Tape''' – is used in construction zones to notify people about ongoing construction and that there are possible hazards within the demarcated area. Construction tape usually employs a yellow-black color combination and incorporates printed text, such as "Under Construction", "Caution", "Work Zone", and "Keep Out" (among others). This type of barrier tape is commonly found at the site of renovations, demolition, and minor repairs.

'''Hazard Tape''' – is used in locations containing a substantial danger. Examples include electrocution hazards or areas within which there is a risk of exposure to toxic chemicals. Hazard tape is available in different color combinations, each of which indicates certain classes of threat. For example, yellow-black tape is used to signal the presence of a physical hazard (e.g., a hole), while magenta-yellow denotes a radiation hazard. This type of barrier tape is commonly used in laboratories, production areas, and industrial zones.

'''[[Road traffic control device|Traffic Control Device]] Tape''' – this type of barrier tape, as its name implies is used to control traffic, whether foot traffic or vehicle traffic. Traffic control device tapes are used as temporary traffic signal to redirect traffic during parade or whenever a road is closed. These are usually brightly colored, either in solid orange or orange-white combination.

'''Police Tape or Law Enforcement Tape''' – this type of barrier tape is used to isolate, protect and preserve a crime scene. Police tape is used to notify the public that an investigation is on going and that a particular area is restricted. This is usually seen with a yellow-white, yellow-black or blue-white color combination.

'''Firefighter Tape''' – serves the same purpose as police tape and hazard tape. Firefighter tape is used to isolate a particular area during or after a fire to keep the public away from fire-related risks (e.g., smoke inhalation, airborne particulate matter, and damaged structures).

== Foreground (tape) and Background colours ==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Dimbokro Nzi River Bridge Red &amp; White Tape.png| Foreground (tape) against Background of Black and White Sky.]] --&gt;

The choice of colours of barricade tape depends on the contrast with its background, which in the case of the sky, can vary from black to white.

To have a reasonable chance of being visible against most backgrounds, the tape needs a light colour (white or yellow) and a darker colour.

== OSHA and ANSI requirements for barricade tape ==

[[File:OSHA barricade tapes colours.svg|framed|right|The seven OSHA color combinations for barricade tape.]]

OSHA and ANSI provide precise specification for barricade tape colors. These are found in OSHA regulations [https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=STANDARDS&amp;p_id=9714 1910.22] and [https://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_table=STANDARDS&amp;p_id=9793 1910.144]{{Citation needed|reason=Neither 1910.22 nor 1910.144 include the color combinations listed in the 'OSHA-specified barricade tape colors' section below.|date=March 2017}} and [[ANSI Z535]].5-2007, ''Safety Tags and Barricade Tapes (for Temporary Hazards)''. However, the dimension, thickness, and materials of the barricade tape are left to the discretion of the manufacturer.

=== OSHA-specified barricade tape colors ===

# Red / white for Fire Prevention and Protection Equipment.
# Black / white for Housekeeping and Aisle Marking
# Magenta / yellow for Radiation Hazards
# Green / white for Safety and First Aid
# Blue / white for Defective Machinery
# Orange / white for Traffic and Caution Warning
# Black / yellow for Physical Hazards

=== ANSI-specified barricade tape colors ===

:1. Yellow/Black Barricade Tape serves as CAUTION and POTENTIAL HAZARD from:
::* Excavation less than 1.2 meters (4 feet) in depth
::* Identification of trip hazards and low hanging objects
::* Material storage on site
:2. Red Barrication Tape indicates DANGER and SERIOUS HAZARD from:
::* Overhead work
::* Live electrical components

A '''bridge management system''' or '''BMS''' is a means for managing [[bridge]]s throughout [[design]], [[construction]], [[Operations management|operation]] and [[Maintenance, repair and operations|maintenance]] of the bridges. As funds available become tighter, road authorities around the world are facing challenges related to bridge management and the escalating maintenance requirements of large infrastructure assets. Bridge management systems help agencies to meet their objectives, such as building inventories and inspection databases, planning for maintenance, repair and rehabilitation (MR&amp;R) interventions in a systematic way, optimizing the allocation of financial resources, and increasing the safety of bridge users.

The major tasks in bridge management are: collection of [[inventory]] data; inspection; assessment of condition and strength; repair, strengthening or replacement of components; and prioritizing the allocation of funds. A BMS is a means of managing bridge information to formulate maintenance programs within cost limitations.  A BMS includes four basic components: data storage, cost and deterioration models, optimization and analysis models, and updating functions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://montreal.ciise.concordia.ca/infra/publications/Jerry/Thesis/Final%20Submmision.pdf Mobile Location-Based Bridge Inspection Decision-Support System&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060925131840/http://montreal.ciise.concordia.ca/infra/publications/Jerry/Thesis/Final%20Submmision.pdf |date=September 25, 2006 }}

'''Customer attrition''', also known as '''customer churn''', '''customer turnover''', or '''customer defection''', is the loss of clients or customers.

[[Bank]]s, telephone service companies, [[Internet service provider]]s, [[pay TV]] companies, [[insurance]] firms, and alarm monitoring services, often use customer attrition analysis and customer attrition rates as one of their key business [[Metric (mathematics)|metrics]] (along with [[cash flow]], [[EBITDA]], etc.) because the cost of retaining an existing customer is far less than acquiring a new one.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hbr.org/1990/09/zero-defections-quality-comes-to-services/ar/1 ''Zero Defections: Quality comes to service.''], Reichheld &amp; Sasser. Harvard Business review. 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; Companies from these sectors often have [[customer service]] branches which attempt to win back defecting clients, because recovered long-term customers can be worth much more to a company than newly recruited clients.

Companies usually make a distinction between '''voluntary churn''' and '''involuntary churn'''. Voluntary churn occurs due to a decision by the customer to switch to another company or service provider, involuntary churn occurs due to circumstances such as a customer's relocation to a long-term care facility, death, or the relocation to a distant location. In most applications, involuntary reasons for churn are excluded from the analytical models. Analysts tend to concentrate on voluntary churn, because it typically occurs due to factors of the company-customer relationship which companies control, such as how billing interactions are handled or how after-sales help is provided.

When companies are measuring their customer turnover, they typically make the distinction between '''gross attrition''' and '''net attrition'''. Gross attrition is the loss of existing customers and their associated [[recurring revenue]] for contracted goods or services during a particular period. Net attrition is gross attrition plus the addition or recruitment of similar customers at the original location. Financial institutions often track and measure attrition using a weighted calculation called '''Recurring Monthly Revenue''' (or '''RMR''').   In the 2000s, there are also a number of [[business intelligence]] software programs which can [[data mining|mine databases]] of customer information and analyze the factors that are associated with customer attrition, such as dissatisfaction with service or technical support, billing disputes, or a disagreement over company policies. More sophisticated [[predictive analytics]] software use churn prediction models that predict customer churn by assessing their propensity of risk to churn. Since these models generate a small prioritized list of potential defectors, they are effective at focusing [[customer retention]] marketing programs on the subset of the customer base who are most vulnerable to churn.

==Retail services applications==
[[Financial services]] such as banking and insurance use applications of [[predictive analytics]] for churn modeling, because customer retention is an essential part of most financial services' [[business model]]s. Other sectors have also discovered the power of predictive analytics, including [[retail]]ing, [[telecommunications]] and pay-TV operators. One of the main objectives of modeling customer churn is to determine the causal factors, so that the company can try to prevent the attrition from happening in the future. Some companies want to prevent their ''good'' customers from deteriorating (e.g., by falling behind in their payments) and becoming less profitable customers, so they introduced the notion of '''partial customer churn'''.

Customer attrition merits special attention by mobile telecom service providers worldwide. This is due to the low barriers to switching to a competing service provider especially with the advent of Mobile Number Portability (MNP) in several countries. This allows customers to switch to another provider while preserving their phone numbers. While mature markets with high teledensity (phone market penetration) have [[churn rate]]s ranging from 1% to 2% per month, high growth developing markets such as India and China are experiencing churn rates between 3% to 4% per month. By deploying new technologies such churn prediction models coupled with effective retention programs, customer attrition could be better managed to stem the significant revenue loss from defecting customers.

Customer attrition is a major concern for US and Canadian banks, because they have much higher churn rates than banks in Western Europe. US and Canadian banks with the lowest churn rates have achieved customer turnover rates as low as 12% per year, by using tactics such as free checking accounts, [[online banking]] and bill payment, and improved customer service. However, once banks can improve their churn rates by improving customer service, they can reach a point beyond which further customer service will not improve retention; other tactics or approaches need to be explored.

Churn or Customer attrition is often used as an indicator of customer satisfaction. However the churn rate can be kept artificially low by making it difficult for the customers to resiliate their services. This can include ignoring resiliations requests, implementing lengthy and complicated resiliation procedures to follow through by an average consumer and various other barriers to resiliation. Thus, churn can improve while customer satisfaction deteriorates. This practice is short sighted and will backfire. However, it was shown{{By whom|date=October 2017}} to be common in telephone companies and among internet providers.

==Research==
Scholars have studied customer attrition at European financial services companies, and investigated the predictors of churn and how the use of [[customer relationship management]] (CRM) approaches can impact churn rates. Several studies combine several different types of predictors to develop a churn model. This model can take [[Demography|demographic characteristics]], environmental changes, and other factors into account.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Customer Attrition Analysis For Financial Services Using Proportional Hazard Models | citeseerx = 10.1.1.62.8919 | author1 = Van Den Poel | author2 = Lariviére | journal = European Journal of Operational Research | year = 2004 | doi = 10.1016/s0377-2217(03)00069-9 | volume=157 | pages=196–217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research on customer attrition data modeling may provide businesses with several tools for enhancing customer retention. Using data mining and software, one may apply statistical methods to develop nonlinear attrition causation models. One researcher notes that "...retaining existing customers is more profitable than acquiring new customers due primarily to savings on acquisition costs, the higher volume of service consumption, and customer referrals." The argument is that to build an "...effective customer retention program," managers have to come to an understanding of "...why customers leave" and "...identify the customers with high risk of leaving" by accurately predicting customer attrition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lib.unb.ca/Texts/JCIM/bin/get.cgi?directory=vol6_1/&amp;filename=li.html ''Applying and evaluating models to predict customer attrition using data mining techniques''], Tom Au, et al. Journal of Comparative International Management. 1 June 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prediction==
In the [[business]] context, "churn" refers both to customers' migration and to their loss of value. So, "churn rate" refers, on the one hand, to the percentage of customers who end their relation with the organization, or, on the other hand, to the customers who still receive their services, but not as much or not as often as they used to.
Current organizations face therefore a huge challenge: to be able to anticipate to customers’ abandon in order to retain them on time, reducing this way costs and risks and gaining efficiency and competitivity.
There are in the market advanced analytics tools and applications, especially designed to analyze in depth the enormous amount of data inside the organizations, and to make predictions based on the information obtained from analyzing and exploring those data. They aim to put at the service of [[marketing]] departments and agencies –and of all business users- the necessary weapons to:
* Detect soon which customers are about to abandon and to know them in depth, answering to questions such as: Who are they? or How do they behave?
* Know the real value of the potential loss of those customers, with the aim of establishing priorities and distributing business efforts and resources efficiently, optimizing resources and maximizing the value of the current customers’ portfolio.
* Put into practice personalized retention plans in order to reduce or avoid their migration, increasing the capability to react and anticipating to possible non-predicted fugues.

==Reduction==
There are organizations that have developed international standards regarding recognition and sharing of global best practice in [[customer service]] in order to reduce customer attrition. [[The International Customer Service Institute]] has developed The International Customer Service Standard to strategically align organizations so they focus on delivering excellence in customer service, whilst at the same time providing recognition of success through a 3rd Party registration scheme.

==Management==
Not all customer attrition is bad. For many firms, it is useful and desirable that unprofitable customers should churn away. This is known as customer divestment of unprofitable customers.&lt;ref&gt;Ka‐shing Woo, Henry K.Y. Fock, (2004) Retaining and divesting customers: an exploratory study of right customers, “at‐risk” right customers, and wrong customers. ''Journal of Services Marketing, 18'', 187-197.&lt;/ref&gt; However, simply because a customer is unprofitable does not mean that the customer should be divested, because there are strategic reasons for retaining unprofitable customers.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4171">{{Well logging}}
'''Density logging''' is a [[well logging]] tool that can provide a continuous record of a [[Formation (geology)|formation's]] [[bulk density]] along the length of a [[borehole]].  In geology, bulk density is a function of the density of the minerals forming a rock (i.e. [[rock matrix|matrix]]) and the fluid enclosed in the pore spaces.  This is one of three well logging tools that are commonly used to calculate porosity, the other two being [[sonic logging]] and [[Formation evaluation neutron porosity|neutron porosity logging]]

==History &amp; Principle==
The tool was initially developed in the 1950s and was in use throughout the hydrocarbon industry by the 1960s.  A type of active nuclear tool, a [[radioactive source]] and detector are lowered down the borehole and the source emits medium-energy [[gamma ray]]s into the formation.  Radioactive sources are typically a directional Cs-137 source.  These gamma rays interact with electrons in the formation and are scattered in an interaction known as [[Compton scattering]].  The number of scattered gamma rays that reach the detector, placed at a set distance from the emitter, is related to the formation's electron density,&lt;ref name="Gluyas"&gt;Gluyas, J. &amp; Swarbrick, R. (2004) Petroleum Geoscience. Publ. Blackwell Publishing. p32&lt;/ref&gt; which itself is related to the formation's bulk density (&lt;math&gt;\rho_\text{bulk}&lt;/math&gt;) via
:&lt;math&gt;\rho_\text{e} = 2\rho_\text{bulk} \ \frac{ Z}{A}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt;  is the atomic number, and &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is the molecular weight of the compound. For most elements &lt;math&gt;Z/A&lt;/math&gt; is about 1/2 (except for hydrogen where this ratio is 1). The electron density (&lt;math&gt;\rho_\text{e}&lt;/math&gt;) in g/cm³ determines the response of the density tool.

==General tool design==

The tool itself initially consisted of a radioactive source and a single detector, but this configuration is susceptible to the effects of the [[drilling fluid]].  In a similar way to how the [[sonic logging]] tool was improved to compensate for borehole effects, density logging now conventionally uses 2 or more detectors.  In a 2 detector configuration, the short-spaced detector has a much shallower depth of investigation than the long-spaced detector so it is used to measure the effect that the drilling fluid has on the gamma ray detection.  This result is then used to correct the long-spaced detector.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com/Display.cfm?Term=compensated-density%20log Schlumberger Oilfield Glossary. Compensated-density Log.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inferring porosity from bulk density==

Assuming that the measured bulk density (&lt;math&gt;\rho_\text{bulk}&lt;/math&gt;) only depends on [[rock matrix|matrix]] density (&lt;math&gt;\rho_\text{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;) and fluid density (&lt;math&gt;\rho_\text{fluid}&lt;/math&gt;), and that these values are known along the wellbore, [[porosity]] (&lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;) can be inferred by the formula
:&lt;math&gt;\phi = \frac{\rho_\text{matrix} - \rho_\text{bulk}}{\rho_\text{matrix}-\rho_\text{fluid}}&lt;/math&gt;

Common values of matrix density &lt;math&gt;\rho_\text{matrix}&lt;/math&gt; (in [[gram|g]]/cm³) are:

* [[Quartz]] sand - 2.65
* [[Limestone]] - 2.71
* [[Dolomite]] - 2.87

This method is the most reliable porosity indicator for sandstones and limestones because their density is well known.&lt;ref name=Gluyas /&gt;  On the other hand, the density of [[clay mineral]]s such as [[mudstone]] is highly variable, depending on [[depositional environment]], [[overburden]] pressure, type of clay mineral and many other factors. It can vary from 2.1 (montmorillonite) to 2.76 (chlorite) so this tool is not as useful for determining their porosity.  A fluid bulk density &lt;math&gt;\rho_\text{fluid}&lt;/math&gt; of 1 [[gram|g]]/cm³ is appropriate where the water is fresh but highly [[saline water]] has a slightly higher density and lower values should be used for [[hydrocarbon reservoir]]s, depending on the hydrocarbon density and residual saturation.

In some applications hydrocarbons are indicated by the presence of abnormally high log porosities.

[[File:D-VOR PEK.JPG|thumb|D-VOR/DME ground station]]
[[File:DME SGT.jpg|thumb|DME antenna beside the DME transponder shelter]]

'''Distance measuring equipment''' ('''DME''') is a transponder-based radio navigation technology that measures [[slant range]] distance by timing the [[propagation delay]] of [[Very high frequency|VHF]] or [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] radio signals.

Developed in Australia, it was invented by James "Gerry" Gerrand&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/obituaries/engineer-exploded-myths-in-many-fields-20130108-2cell.html|title=Engineer exploded myths in many fields|date=9 January 2013|publisher=|via=The Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt; under the supervision of [[Edward George Bowen|Edward George "Taffy" Bowen]] while employed as Chief of the Division of Radiophysics of the [[Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation]] (CSIRO). Another engineered version of the system was deployed by [[Amalgamated Wireless Australasia Limited]] in the early 1950s operating in the 200&amp;nbsp;MHz [[VHF]] band. This Australian domestic version was referred to by the Federal Department of Civil Aviation as DME(D) (or DME Domestic), and the later international version adopted by [[ICAO]] as DME(I). 
 
DME is similar to [[Secondary surveillance radar|secondary radar]], except in reverse. The system was a post-war development of the IFF ([[identification friend or foe]]) systems of [[World War II]]. To maintain compatibility, DME is functionally identical to the distance measuring component of [[TACAN]].

==Operation==
Aircraft use DME to determine their distance from a land-based transponder by sending and receiving pulse pairs – two pulses of fixed duration and separation. The ground stations are typically collocated with [[VHF omnidirectional range|VORs]] or [[Instrument Landing System|ILS]] systems. A low-power DME can be collocated with an ILS [[Instrument_landing_system#Glide_slope_of_ILS_(G/S)|glide slope]] antenna installation where it provides an accurate distance to touchdown function, similar to that otherwise provided by ILS [[marker beacon]]s.

A typical Distance measuring equipment ground transponder system for en-route or terminal navigation will have a 1&amp;nbsp;kW peak pulse output on the assigned UHF channel.

==Hardware==
The DME system comprises a UHF transmitter/receiver (interrogator) in the aircraft and a UHF receiver/transmitter ([[transponder]]) on the ground.

[[File:DME VOR avionics.svg|thumb|400px|DME distance and VOR/ADF cockpit display instruments]]

==Timing==

SEARCH MODE: 150 interrogation pulse-pairs per second.

The aircraft interrogates the ground transponder with a series of pulse-pairs (interrogations) and, after a precise time delay (typically 50 microseconds), the ground station replies with an identical sequence of pulse-pairs. The DME receiver in the aircraft searches for reply pulse-pairs (X-mode= 12 microsecond spacing) with the correct interval and reply pattern to its original interrogation pattern. (Pulse-pairs that are not coincident with the individual aircraft's interrogation pattern e.g. not synchronous, are referred to as filler pulse-pairs, or [[squitter]]. Also, replies to other aircraft that are therefore non-synchronous also appear as squitter).

TRACK MODE: less than 30 interrogation Pulse-pairs per second, as the average number of pulses in SEARCH and TRACK is limited to max 30 pulse pairs per second.

The aircraft interrogator locks on to the DME ground station once it recognizes a particular reply pulse sequence has the same spacing as the original interrogation sequence. Once the receiver is locked on, it has a narrower window in which to look for the echoes and can retain lock.

==Distance calculation==
A radio signal takes approximately 12.36 microseconds to travel {{convert|1|nmi|m|0|lk=in}} to the target and back—also referred to as a radar-mile. The time difference between interrogation and reply, minus the 50 microsecond ground transponder delay, is measured by the interrogator's timing circuitry and converted to a distance measurement ([[slant range]]), in nautical miles, then displayed on the cockpit DME display.

The distance formula, ''distance = rate * time'', is used by the DME receiver to calculate its distance from the DME ground station. The rate in the calculation is the velocity of the radio pulse, which is the speed of light (roughly {{convert|300000000|m/s|mi/s|-3|abbr=on|disp=or|lk=on}}). The time in the calculation is ''(total time – 50µs)/2''.

== Accuracy ==
The accuracy of DME ground stations is 185 m (±0.1 [[nautical mile|nmi]]).&lt;ref name="FRS2001"&gt;{{cite web
 | author=Department of Defense and Department of Transportation 
 | date=December 2001
 | url=http://www.navcen.uscg.gov/pdf/frp/frp2001/FRS2001.pdf
 | title=2001 Federal Radionavigation Systems
 | format=PDF
 | accessdate=5 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It's important to understand that DME provides the physical distance from the aircraft to the DME transponder. This distance is often referred to as 'slant range' and depends trigonometrically upon both the altitude above the transponder and the ground distance from it.

For example, an aircraft directly above the DME station at 6,076&amp;nbsp;ft (1 nmi) altitude would still show {{convert|1.0|nmi|km|abbr=on}} on the DME readout. The aircraft is technically a mile away, just a mile straight up. Slant range error is most pronounced at high altitudes when close to the DME station.

Radio-navigation aids must keep a certain degree of accuracy, given by international standards, FAA,&lt;ref name="FAA Order 9840.1"&gt;{{cite web
 | author=Federal Aviation Administration
 | date=2 September 1982
 | url=http://www.faa.gov
 | title=U.S. National Aviation Standard for the VOR/DME/TACAN Systems}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[European Aviation Safety Agency|EASA]], [[International Civil Aviation Organization|ICAO]], etc. To assure this is the case, [[flight inspection]] organizations check periodically critical parameters with properly equipped aircraft to calibrate and certify DME precision.

[[International Civil Aviation Organization|ICAO]] recommends accuracy of less than the sum of 0.25&amp;nbsp;nmi plus 1.25% of the distance measured.

==Specification==
A typical DME ground based responder beacon has a limit of 2700 interrrogations per second (pulse pairs per second – pps). This means that it can provide distance information for up to 100 aircraft at a time—95% of transmissions for aircraft in tracking mode (typically 25 pps) and 5% in search mode (typically 150 pps). Above this limit the transponder avoids overload by limiting the sensitivity (gain) of the receiver. Replies to weaker (normally the more distant) interrogations are ignored to lower the transponder load.

==Radio frequency and modulation data==
DME frequencies are paired to VHF omnidirectional range (VOR) frequencies and a DME interrogator is designed to automatically tune to the corresponding DME frequency when the associated VOR frequency is selected. An airplane’s DME interrogator uses frequencies from 1025 to 1150&amp;nbsp;MHz. DME transponders transmit on a channel in the 962 to 1213&amp;nbsp;MHz range and receive on a corresponding channel between 1025 and 1150&amp;nbsp;MHz. 
The band is divided into 126 [[Channel (communications)|channels]] for interrogation and 126 channels for reply. The interrogation and reply frequencies always differ by 63&amp;nbsp;MHz. The spacing of all channels is 1&amp;nbsp;MHz with a signal spectrum width of 100&amp;nbsp;kHz.

Technical references to X and Y channels relate only to the spacing of the individual pulses in the DME pulse pair, 12 microsecond spacing for X channels and 30 microsecond spacing for Y channels.

DME facilities identify themselves with a 1,350&amp;nbsp;Hz [[Morse code]] three letter identity. If collocated with a VOR or ILS, it will have the same identity code as the parent facility. Additionally, the DME will identify itself between those of the parent facility. The DME identity is 1,350&amp;nbsp;Hz to differentiate itself from the 1,020&amp;nbsp;Hz tone of the VOR or the ILS localizer.

==Terminal DME==
A terminal DME, referred to as a TDME in [[navigational chart]]s, is a DME that is designed to provide a 0 reading at the threshold point of the runway, regardless of the physical location of the equipment. It is typically associated with [[Instrument landing system|ILS]] or other instrument approach.

==Future==
DME operation will continue and possibly expand as an alternate navigation source to space-based navigational systems such as [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] and [[Galileo positioning system|Galileo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Department of Defense, Department of Homeland Security and Department of Transportation | date=January 2009 | url=http://www.navcen.uscg.gov/pdf/2008_Federal_Radionavigation_Plan.pdf | title=2008 Federal Radionavigation Plan | format=PDF | accessdate= 8 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9236">[[File:B-58 Escape Capsule.jpg|thumb|Crewmember escape capsule from a [[B-58 Hustler]]]]
An '''escape crew capsule''' is an [[escape capsule]] that allows one or more occupants of an aircraft or spacecraft to escape from the craft while it is subjected to extreme conditions, such as high speed or altitude. The occupant remains encapsulated and protected until such time as the external environment is suitable for direct exposure or the capsule reaches the ground.

==Escape types==
There are two ways to do this:
* Ejecting individual crew capsules (one for each pilot/crew member) or "capsule ejection"
* Ejecting the entire crew cabin, or "cabin ejection"

Some examples of U.S. military aircraft that have escape crew capsules are:&lt;ref name="Goodrich"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071026161344/http://showcase.netins.net/web/herker/ejection/eject_paper.html B.F.Goodrich - ''HISTORY OF AIRCRAFT ESCAPE SYSTEM PROPULSION'']&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Convair B-58 Hustler]] Mach 2 bomber and [[North American XB-70 Valkyrie]] Mach 3 bomber prototype had individual encapsulated seats.  A cabin ejection for the XB-70 Valkyrie was also tested. The B-58's capsule had a control stick, a bottle of oxygen, and a drogue chute.
* The [[General Dynamics F-111 Aardvark]] used cabin ejection where both side-by-side seats were in a single 3000 [[pound (mass)|lb]] (1360&amp;nbsp;kg) capsule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite |url=http://www.ejectionsite.com/f111restore.htm |work=Ejection Site  |title=F-111 Aardvark}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Three of the four [[Rockwell B-1 Lancer#B-1A program|Rockwell B-1A]] prototypes also used cabin ejection. They had a single capsule "roughly the size of a mini-van" &lt;ref name="Weber"&gt;[http://www.ejectionsite.com/b1seat.htm Ejection Site - ''B-1A Lancer'']&lt;/ref&gt; for all four crew members.

==Design and development==
Pioneering developments in jettisonable-cockpit style escape capsule systems occurred in [[Nazi Germany]], by both ''[[Heinkel]] Flugzeugwerke'' and by the ''[[Deutsche Forschungsanstalt für Segelflug]]'' (German Institute for Glider Research).  ''Heinkel Flugzeugwerke'' built the first ejection-seat-equipped combat aircraft, the [[Heinkel He 219]].  ''Deutsche Forschungsanstalt für Segelflug'' flew the [[Heinkel He 176]] rocket plane (in 1939), and the [[DFS 228]] research aircraft, both of which had a jettisonable nose.&lt;ref name="Tuttle"&gt;Tuttle, Jim. ''Eject! The Complete History of U.S. Aircraft Escape Systems''. St. Paul, Minnesota: MBI Publishing Company, 2002. {{ISBN|0-7603-1185-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The British design for a supersonic test aircraft [[Miles M.52]] of necessity had a jettisonable pilot capsule at the front of the aircraft. The aircraft progressed no further than a nearly complete airframe before cancellation in 1946, although a one-third scale remote control model successfully broke the sound barrier in 1948.

The first American attempt to design such an escape capsule was for the U.S. Navy [[F4D Skyray]].&lt;ref name="Goodrich"/&gt; It was tested in 1951-52 but was never installed in the aircraft. The [[Bell X-2]], designed for flight in excess of Mach 3, could jettison the cockpit, though the pilot would still have to jump out and descend under his own parachute.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/centers/dryden/news/FactSheets/FS-079-DFRC.html NASA Dryden Research Fact Sheet - ''Bell X-2 Starbuster'']&lt;/ref&gt; The first production aircraft with an escape crew capsule was the [[Mach number|Mach]] 2 [[B-58 Hustler]]. It was developed by the [[Stanley Aviation Company]] for Convair.  The capsule was pressurized, sheltered the pilot from the airstream, and contained food and survival supplies.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120206042919/http://www.aeromuseum.org/aircraft_b58.html Octave Chanute Aerospace Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ejectionsite.com/eb58caps.htm Ejection Site - ''EB-58 Hustler'']&lt;/ref&gt;  During testing of the "Stanley Capsule" in 1962, a [[bear]] became the first living creature to survive a supersonic ejection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ejection-history.org.uk/Aircraft_by_Type/B-58_hustler.htm |title= Convair B-58 Hustler - Losses &amp; Ejections |accessdate= 2009-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mach 3 XB-70's two crew escape capsules did not work well the only time they were needed. On June 8, 1966, XB-70 airframe AV/2 was involved in a mid-air crash with an [[F-104 Starfighter]]. Maj. Carl Cross's seat was unable to retract backwards into the escape capsule due to high-[[g-force|''g''-forces]] as the plane spiraled downwards. He died in the crash. Maj. [[Alvin S. White|Al White]]'s seat did retract but his elbow protruded from the capsule and blocked the closing clamshell doors. He struggled to free his trapped elbow. As soon as he freed the doors, he was ejected from the plane and descended by parachute as planned. Due to pain and confusion, White failed to trigger the manually activated airbag that would normally cushion the capsule upon landing. When the capsule hit the ground, White was subjected to an estimated 33 to 44 [[g-force|''g'']] (320 to 430&amp;nbsp;m/s²). He received serious injuries, but nevertheless survived.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/centers/dryden/news/FactSheets/FS-084-DFRC.html NASA Dryden Research Fact Sheet - ''XB-70'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.labiker.org/xb70.html Labiker XB-70]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:F-111E Escape Pod.JPG|thumb|Escape capsule from [[F-111|F-111E]]]]
In the 1960s and 1970s, the F-111 and B-1A introduced the method of jettisoning the entire front fuselage as a means of crew escape. The crew remains strapped in the cabin, unencumbered by a parachute harness, while 27,000 [[pound-force|lbf]] (120 [[kilonewton|kN]]) of thrust from rockets accelerates the module away from the rest of the aircraft. A single, large parachute retards the descent of the capsule. On landing, an [[airbag]] system cushions the landing.  In the event of a water landing the airbag acts as a flotation device. Additional airbags could be activated to right the capsule in the event of a water landing (similar to the Apollo capsule), or an additional airbag could be selected for auxiliary flotation.  With a movement of a pin at the base of the pilot's control stick, a [[bilge pump]] could be activated and extra air pumped into the airbags.

Three of the four B-1A prototypes featured a single crew escape capsule for the crew members. For the fourth prototype and for the B-1B, this was changed to use conventional [[ejection seat]]s. One source gives the reason "due to concerns about servicing the pyrotechnical components of the system,"&lt;ref name = "Weber"/&gt; while another says this was done "to save cost and weight."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/systems/b-1a.htm Global Security's B-1A Lancer]&lt;/ref&gt; On August 29, 1984, B-1A prototype #2 crashed and the capsule was ejected at low altitude. The parachute deployed improperly and one of the three crew died.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/5msSr2bpc?url=http://www.vectorsite.net/avb1.html Vector Site B-1B]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ejectionsite.com/b1amodule.htm Ejection Seat Site B-1A]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ejection seats vs. escape crew capsules==
[[Clarence Johnson|Kelly Johnson]], founder of [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] [[Skunk Works]], and developer of the [[Lockheed U-2|U-2]] and [[SR-71 Blackbird]] family of spy planes, commented on escape crew capsules when discussing development of the [[Lockheed YF-12|YF-12A]] (Blackbird) ejection seat: "We set ourselves a very high goal in providing crew escape systems. We were determined to develop a system good for zero escape velocity on the ground and through the complete flight spectrum, having speeds above Mach 3 at 100,000 feet. We did achieve our design goals.... I have never been convinced that a capsule ejection is required for anything other than high velocity re-entry from outer space. Our escape system in a very important sense really provides a capsule, which is the [[pressure suit]], which is surely capable of meeting the speeds and temperatures likely to be encountered in the near future of manned aircraft."&lt;ref&gt;"Some Development Aspects of the YF-12A Interceptor Aircraft", Clarence "Kelly" Johnson, Vice President, Lockheed Aircraft Corporation, Burbank, California, July 1969. As quoted in Miller, Jay, "Lockheed Martin's Skunk Works", Midland Publishing Ltd., page 212, middle of column 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than using escape capsules, SR-71 and U-2 pilots wore full pressure suits for high-altitude ejections. The suits were also heat-resistant so that SR-71 pilots could survive the high temperatures generated from a Mach 3 ejection.

The ''' European Lead Factory''' is a [[Public–private partnership|public-private partnership]] that aims to accelerate early [[drug discovery]] in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imi.europa.eu/content/european-lead-factory|title=IMI Innovative Medicines Initiative - ELF - European Lead Factory|website=IMI Innovative Medicines Initiative}}&lt;/ref&gt; The European Lead Factory is funded by the [[Innovative Medicines Initiative]] and consists of a pan-European consortium that includes 7 [[European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations|pharmaceutical companies]] as well as partners from academia and [[small and medium-sized enterprises]] (SMEs).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.euronews.com/2016/12/28/business-planet-innovative-medicines-initiative-imi|title=The vital role of SMEs in medical research|date=2016-12-28|website=euronews|access-date=2017-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.europeanleadfactory.eu/about/partners/|title=Partners - European Lead Factory|website=www.europeanleadfactory.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Drug discovery platform ==
The European Lead Factory is operational since 2013 and consists of two main components: the Joint European [[Chemical library|Compound Library]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.europeanleadfactory.eu/about/assets/joint-european-compound-library/|title=Joint European Compound Library - European Lead Factory|website=www.europeanleadfactory.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the European Screening Centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.europeanleadfactory.eu/about/assets/eu-screening-centre/|title=EU Screening Centre - European Lead Factory|website=www.europeanleadfactory.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together these elements provide a platform for pharmaceutical researchers in Europe to identify drug discovery starting points, by connecting innovative drug targets to high-quality [[small molecule]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Karawajczyk|first=Anna|last2=Orrling|first2=Kristina M.|last3=Vlieger|first3=De|last4=B|first4=Jon S.|last5=Rijnders|first5=Ton|last6=Tzalis|first6=Dimitrios|date=2017|title=The European Lead Factory: A Blueprint for Public–Private Partnerships in Early Drug Discovery|url=http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fmed.2016.00075/full|journal=Frontiers in Medicine|language=English|volume=3|doi=10.3389/fmed.2016.00075|issn=2296-858X|pmc=5243859|pmid=28154815}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The European Lead Factory – An experiment in collaborative drug discovery - Laverty HG, et al., Journal of Medicines Development Sciences 1.1 (2015), doi: 10.18063/JMDS.2015.01.009&lt;/ref&gt; The result is defined in a ‘hit list’: a number of compounds that show affinity for the target. The compounds on those lists can either be used as probes to better understand biological pathways or as starting points for lead discovery efforts for novel drugs. These hits can be further optimised outside of the European Lead Factory, for affinity but also for drug-like properties as selectivity, solubility and metabolism in the human body. The ultimate goal is that these candidate drugs will solve unmet medical needs when fully approved as drug by the authorities.

[[File:Hywind.jpg|thumb|The world’s first full-scale floating wind turbine, Hywind, being assembled in the Åmøy Fjord near [[Stavanger]], [[Norway]] in 2009, before deployment in the [[North Sea]]]]
A '''floating wind turbine''' is an [[offshore wind power|offshore]] [[wind turbine]] mounted on a floating structure that allows the turbine to generate [[electricity]] in water depths where fixed-foundation turbines are not feasible.&lt;ref name=ge20110913/&gt;
Floating wind farms have the potential to significantly increase the sea area available for offshore wind farms, especially in countries with limited shallow waters, such as Japan.
Locating wind farms farther offshore can also reduce [[visual pollution]],&lt;ref name=ge20110913&gt;{{cite news|last=Laskow|first=Sarah|title=Hope Floats for a New Generation of Deep-Water Wind Farms|url=http://www.good.is/post/hope-floats-for-a-new-generation-of-deep-water-wind-farms/|accessdate=12 October 2011|newspaper=Good Environment|date=13 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; provide better accommodation for fishing and [[shipping lane]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailyfinance.com/2009/09/09/the-worlds-first-floating-wind-turbine-goes-on-line-in-norway/|title=The world's first floating wind turbine goes on line in Norway|author=[http://www.dailyfinance.com/bloggers/mark-svenvold/ Mark Svenvold]|date=9 September 2009|accessdate=20 October 2009|publisher=DailyFinance.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucsusa.org/clean_energy/technology_and_impacts/impacts/farming-the-wind-wind-power.html|title=Farming the Wind: Wind Power and Agriculture|author=[[Union of Concerned Scientists]]|date=15 July 2003|accessdate=20 October 2009|quote=&lt;!-- This citation added to support the removal of unsupported statements regarding competition between wind turbines and agriculture --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reach stronger and more consistent winds.&lt;ref name="Musial2003"/&gt;

Commercial floating wind turbines are mostly at the early phase of development, with several single turbine prototypes having been installed since 2007. 
As of 2018, the only operational floating wind farm is Hywind Scotland, developed by [[Statoil]] and commissioned in October 2017. 
The farm has 5 floating turbines with a total capacity of 30 MW.&lt;ref name="cleantechnica.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hywind Scotland, World's First Floating Wind Farm, Performing Better Than Expected {{!}} CleanTechnica|url=https://cleantechnica.com/2018/02/16/hywind-scotland-worlds-first-floating-wind-farm-performing-better-expected/|website=cleantechnica.com|accessdate=7 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept for large-scale offshore floating wind turbines was introduced by Professor William E. Heronemus at the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]] in 1972. 
It was not until the mid 1990s, after the commercial wind industry was well established, that the topic was taken up again by the mainstream research community.&lt;ref name="Musial2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Musial|first=W.|author2=S.

The turbine was constructed by [[Siemens Wind Power]] and mounted on a floating tower with a 100 m deep draft, with a float tower constructed by [[Technip]].

After assembly in the calmer waters of Åmøy Fjord near [[Stavanger|Stavanger, Norway]], the 120 m tall tower was towed 10&amp;nbsp;km offshore into 220 m deep water, 10&amp;nbsp;km southwest of [[Karmøy]], on 6 June 2009 for a two-year test deployment.&lt;ref name="Patel2009"/&gt;

In October 2011, WindFloat prototype was installed 4&amp;nbsp;km offshore of Aguçadoura, Portugal by Principle Power in approximately 45&amp;nbsp;m of water (previously the [[Aguçadoura Wave Farm]] site). 
The WindFloat was fitted with a Vestas V80 2.0-MW offshore wind turbine and grid connected. 
The installation was the first offshore wind turbine to be deployed without the use of any offshore heavy lift vessels as the turbine was fully commissioned onshore prior to the unit's being towed offshore. 
This is the first offshore wind turbine installed in open Atlantic waters, and the first to employ a semi-submersible type floating foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://principlepowerinc.com/news/press_PPI_WF_deployment.html | title= First WindFloat Successfully Deployed Offshore|date=30 November 2011 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311201309/http://www.principlepowerinc.com/news/press_PPI_WF_deployment.html | archivedate=11 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=March 2012}}

In June 2013, the [[University of Maine]] deployed the VolturnUS 1:8, a {{convert|65|foot|m}} tall floating turbine prototype that is 1:8th the scale of a 6-megawatt (MW), {{convert|450|foot|m}} rotor diameter design.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bangordailynews.com/video/volturnus-18-windturbine-launched/|title=VolturnUS 1:8 windturbine launches in 2013|access-date=5 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
VolturnUS 1:8 was the first grid-connected offshore wind turbine deployed in the Americas. 
The VolturnUS design utilizes a concrete semi-submersible floating hull and a composite materials tower designed to reduce both capital and Operation &amp; Maintenance costs, and to allow local manufacturing. 
The technology was the result of collaborative research and development conducted by the University of Maine-led DeepCwind Consortium.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://composites.umaine.edu/our-research/offshore-wind/deepcwind-consortium/|title=DeepCwind Consortium {{!}} Advanced Structures &amp; Composites Center {{!}} University of Maine|website=composites.umaine.edu|access-date=5 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{update after|2018|8|3}}

==Anchoring systems==
[[File:Floating tension leg wind turbine diagram.svg|thumb|Left-hand tower-bearing structure (grey) is free floating, the right-hand structure is pulled by the tensioned cables (red) down towards the seabed anchors (light-grey).]]
Two common types of engineered design for anchoring floating structures include [[Tension-leg platform|tension-leg]] and [[catenary]] [[Mooring (watercraft)|loose mooring]] systems.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}&lt;ref name=jonk/&gt;{{rp|2–4}}
''Tension leg mooring systems'' have vertical tethers under tension providing large restoring [[Moment of inertia|moments]] in [[Roll, pitch, and yaw|pitch]] and [[Flight dynamics|roll]]. 
''Catenary mooring systems'' provide station–keeping for an offshore structure yet provide little stiffness at low tensions."&lt;ref name=mit200710&gt;[http://web.mit.edu/flowlab/pdf/Floating_Offshore_Wind_Turbines.pdf Floating Offshore Wind Turbines: Responses in a Seastate -- Pareto Optimal Designs and Economic Assessment], P. Sclavounos et al, October 2007&lt;/ref&gt; 
A third form of mooring system is the ''ballasted catenary'' configuration, created by adding multiple-tonne weights hanging from the midsection of each anchor cable in order to provide additional cable tension and therefore increase stiffness of the above-water floating structure.&lt;ref name=mit200710/&gt;

The [[IEC 61400]]–3 design standard requires that a loads analysis be based on site-specific external conditions such as wind, wave and currents.&lt;ref name=jonk/&gt;{{rp|75}}
The IEC 61400–3-2 standard applies specifically to floating wind turbines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iec.ch/dyn/www/f?p=103:38:0::::FSP_ORG_ID,FSP_APEX_PAGE,FSP_LANG_ID,FSP_PROJECT:1282,23,25/,IEC/TS%2061400-3-2%20Ed.%201.0#|title=IEC - TC 88 Dashboard &gt; Projects: Work programme, Publications, Maintenance cycle, Project files, TC/SC in figures|publisher=Iec.ch|date=15 October 2010|accessdate=2 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.veristar.com/content/static/veristarinfo/images/4706.26.572NI_2010-11.pdf | title=Classification and Certification of Floating Offshore Wind Turbines|publisher=Veristar.com|accessdate=2 December 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203004709/http://www.veristar.com/content/static/veristarinfo/images/4706.26.572NI_2010-11.pdf|archivedate=3 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economics==
The technical feasibility of deepwater floating wind turbines is not questioned, as the long-term survivability of floating structures has been successfully demonstrated by the marine and [[offshore oil drilling platform|offshore oil industries]] over many decades. However, the economics that allowed the deployment of thousands of offshore oil rigs have yet to be demonstrated for floating wind turbine platforms. For deepwater wind turbines, a floating structure will replace pile-driven monopoles or conventional concrete bases that are commonly used as foundations for shallow water and land-based turbines. The floating structure must provide enough buoyancy to support the weight of the turbine and to restrain pitch, roll and heave motions within acceptable limits. The capital costs for the wind turbine itself will not be significantly higher than current marine-proofed turbine costs in shallow water. Therefore, the economics of deepwater wind turbines will be determined primarily by the additional costs of the floating structure and [[power distribution]] system, which are offset by higher [[wind resource assessment|offshore winds]] and close proximity to large load centres (e.g. shorter transmission runs).&lt;ref name="Musial2003"/&gt;

{{As of|2009}} however, the economic feasibility of [[Shallow-water offshore wind power|shallow-water offshore wind technologies]] is more completely understood. 
With empirical data obtained from fixed-bottom installations off many countries since the late 1990s, representative costs are well understood. 
Shallow-water turbines cost between 2.4 and 3&amp;nbsp;million [[United States dollar]]s per megawatt to install, according to the [[World Energy Council]],&lt;ref name="Patel2009"&gt;{{cite news|last=Patel|first=Prachi|title=Floating Wind Turbines to Be Tested|work=|publisher=[[IEEE Spectrum]]|date=22 June 2009|url=http://www.spectrum.ieee.org/green-tech/wind/floating-wind-turbines-to-be-tested|accessdate=25 June 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090628200828/http://www.spectrum.ieee.org/green-tech/wind/floating-wind-turbines-to-be-tested|archive-date=28 June 2009|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the practical feasibility and per-unit economics of deep-water, floating-turbine offshore wind is yet to be established. 
Initial deployment of single full-capacity turbines in deep-water locations began only in 2009.&lt;ref name="Patel2009"/&gt;

{{as of|2010|10}}, new feasibility studies are supporting that floating turbines are becoming both technically and economically viable in the UK and global energy markets. 
"The higher up-front costs associated with developing floating wind turbines would be offset by the fact that they would be able to access areas of deep water off the coastline of the UK where winds are stronger and reliable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2010/oct/11/floating-turbines-reliable-wind |title=Floating turbines promise to deliver reliable wind, says report &amp;#124; Environment|publisher=theguardian.com|accessdate=2 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The recent Offshore Valuation study conducted in the UK has confirmed that using just one third of the UK's wind, wave and tidal resource could generate energy equivalent to 1&amp;nbsp;billion barrels of oil per year; the same as North Sea oil and gas production. 
A significant challenge when using this approach is the coordination needed to develop transmission lines.

A 2015 report by [[Carbon Trust]] recommends 11 ways to reduce cost.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carbontrust.com/resources/reports/technology/floating-offshore-wind-market-technology-review/ Floating Offshore Wind Market Technology Review] ''[[Carbon Trust]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2015, researchers at [[University of Stuttgart]] estimated cost at €230/MWh.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sintef.no/globalassets/project/eera-deepwind-2015/presentations/f/f_matha_univ-stuttgart.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oil well injection===
When [[oil field]]s become depleted, the operator [[Water injection (oil production)|injects water to keep pressure high]] for [[Extraction of petroleum#Secondary recovery|further extraction]]. This requires power, but installing gas turbines means shutting down the extraction process, losing valuable income. The [[classification society]] [[DNV GL]] has calculated that in some cases a floating wind turbine can economically provide power for injection, as the [[oil platform]] can keep on producing, avoiding a costly pause.&lt;ref name=waterin&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.offshorewind.biz/2016/11/25/in-depth-techtalk-floating-wind-powered-water-injection/ |title= Floating wind-powered water injection|work=Offshore Wind|date=25 November 2016|accessdate=27 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jan&gt;Nilsen, Jannicke.

The US State of [[Maine]] solicited proposals in September 2010 to build a floating wind farm. 
The [[RFP]]{{clarify|date=March 2018}} is seeking proposals for 25&amp;nbsp;MW of deep-water offshore wind capacity to supply power for 20-year long-term contract period in the [[Gulf of Maine]]. 
Proposals were due by May 2011.&lt;ref name=be20100903&gt;[http://www.brighterenergy.org/15782/news/marine-hydro/maine-seeks-30mw-of-offshore-wind-and-tidal-pilots/ Maine seeks 30MW of offshore wind and tidal pilots], ''BrighterEnergy.org'', 3 September 2010, accessed 12 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mst20100606&gt;[http://www.pressherald.com/news/the-point-man-on-offshore-wind-clearly-energized_2010-06-06.html State point man on offshore wind clearly energized], ''[[Maine Sunday Telegram]]'', 6 June 2010, accessed 13 June 2010: ''"In September, the state plans to send out bids to build the world's first floating, commercial wind farm off the Maine coast."''&lt;/ref&gt;
In April 2012 Statoil received state regulatory approval to build a large four-unit demonstration wind farm off the coast of Maine.&lt;ref name=hb20120430&gt;{{cite news|last=Hampton|first=Stuart|title=Statoil to demonstrate floating offshore wind turbines in the US|url=http://bizmology.hoovers.com/2012/04/30/statoil-to-demonstrate-floating-offshore-wind-turbines-in-the-us/|accessdate=20 May 2012|publisher=Hoovers|newspaper=Bizmology|date=30 April 2012|quote=''Statoil has secured the support of government officials in Maine to develop a demonstration wind park in the US with four full-scale offshore wind turbines.''}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{asof|2013|04}}, the ''Hywind&amp;nbsp;2'' 4-tower, 12–15&amp;nbsp;MW wind farm was being developed by Statoil North America for placement {{convert|20|km}} off the east coast of [[Maine]] in {{convert|140|-|158|m}}-deep water of the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. 
Like the first Hywind installation off Norway, the turbine foundation will be a ''spar floater''.&lt;ref name=4cos20140403&gt;{{cite web|title=Hywind 2 Demonstration (Maine)|url=http://www.4coffshore.com/windfarms/hywind-2-demonstration-%28maine%29-united-states-us3b.html|work=Offshore Wind Farms Project Database|publisher=4C Offshore|accessdate=3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[State of Maine]] [[Public Utility Commission]] voted to approve the construction and fund the US$120&amp;nbsp;million project by adding approximately 75&amp;nbsp;cents/month to the average retail electricity consumer. Power could be flowing into the grid no earlier than 2016.&lt;ref name=pph20130125&gt;{{cite news|title=Pioneering Maine wind project passes 'biggest hurdle'|url=http://www.pressherald.com/news/PUC-approves-maine-statoil-wind-turbine-offshore-deepwater.html?pagenum=full|accessdate=3 April 2013|newspaper=Portland Press Herald|date=25 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As a result of [[Maine Legislature|legislation]] in 2013 ([http://www.mainelegislature.org/LawMakerWeb/summary.asp?ID=280048788 LD 1472]) by the [[State of Maine]], [[Statoil]] placed the planned Hywind Maine floating wind turbine development project on hold in July 2013. 
The legislation required the [[Maine Public Utilities Commission]] to undertake a second round of bidding for the offshore wind sites with a different set of ground rules, which subsequently led Statoil to suspend due to increased uncertainty and risk in the project. Statoil is considering other locations for its initial US demonstration project.&lt;ref name=osw20130705&gt;{{cite news|title=USA: Statoil Freezes Hywind Maine Project|url=http://www.offshorewind.biz/2013/07/05/usa-statoil-freezes-hywind-maine-project/|accessdate=2 August 2013|newspaper=OffshoreWind.biz|date=5 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some vendors who could bid on the proposed project in Maine expressed concerns in 2010 about dealing with the [[Federal government of the United States|United States]] regulatory environment. Since the proposed site is in [[Outer Continental Shelf|Federal waters]], developers would need a permit from the US [[Minerals Management Service]], "which took more than seven years to approve a [[Cape Wind|yet-to-be-built, shallow-water wind project]] off [[Cape Cod]]". Also, the agency is under fire in June 2010 for lax oversight of deepwater oil drilling in Federal waters.
"Uncertainty over regulatory hurdles in the United States … is 'the Achilles heel' for Maine's ambitions for deepwater wind."&lt;ref name=mst20100606/&gt;

==Other applications==
As they are suitable for towing, floating wind turbine units can be relocated to any location on the sea without much additional cost. So they can be used as prototype test units to practically assess the design adequacy and wind power potential of prospective sites.

When the transmission of generated wind power to nearby land is not economical, the power can be used in [[power to gas]] applications to produce [[hydrogen]] gas, [[ammonia]] / [[urea]], [[reverse osmosis]] water [[desalination]], [[natural gas]], [[Liquefied petroleum gas|LPG]], [[alkylate]] / [[gasoline]], etc. on floating platforms which can be easily transported to nearby consuming centres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Offshore Wind Costs Fall Below New Nuclear Plants in U.K.|url=http://www.eqmagpro.com/offshore-wind-costs-fall-below-new-nuclear-plants-in-u-k/|accessdate=17 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Floating wind turbines can be used to provide motive power for achieving artificial [[upwelling]] of nutrient-rich deep ocean water to the surface for enhancing fisheries growth in areas with tropical and temperate weather.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download;jsessionid=EA65E2A45138AE993750B20FAC628ECC?doi=10.1.1.526.2024&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|title=Enhancing fish stocks with artificial upwelling |accessdate=7 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though deep seawater (below 50 metres depth) is rich in nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus, the [[phytoplankton]] growth is poor due to the absence of sunlight. The most productive ocean fishing grounds are located in cold water seas at high latitudes where natural upwelling of deep sea water occurs due to inverse [[thermocline]] temperatures. The electricity generated by the floating wind turbine would be used to drive high–flow and low–head water pumps to draw cold water from below 50 meters water depth and mixed with warm surface water by [[Water eductor|eductors]] before releasing into the sea. [[Mediterranean Sea]], [[Black Sea]], [[Caspian Sea]], [[Red Sea]], [[Persian Gulf]], deep water lakes/reservoirs are suitable for artificial upwelling for enhancing fish catch economically. These units can also be mobile type to utilise the seasonal favourable winds all around the year.

===GICON===
The GICON-TLP is a floating substructure system based on a tension leg platform (TLP) developed by GICON GmbH.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gicon-sof.de/en/sof1.html|title=Home: Das GICON®-SOF  Schwimmendes Offshorefundament|website=www.gicon-sof.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The system is deployable from 45 meters to 350 meters water depth. 
It consists of six major components: four buoyancy bodies, horizontal pipes for structural base, vertical pipes which pass through the water line, angled piles for connection with the transition piece. 
Casted nodes are used to connect all components. 
The TLP can be equipped with an offshore wind turbine in range of 6–10 MW.

The GICON-TLP is anchored to the seabed via four pre-tensioned mooring ropes with a buoyant gravity-base anchor consisting of concrete. No pile driving or drilling for anchoring is necessary. All ropes are connected at the corners of the square based system.
The TLP for a 6MW wind turbine is currently being developed by the GICON Group and their key partner, the Endowed Chair for Wind Energy Technology (LWET) at the University of Rostock, utilizing prefabricated steel-concrete composite components in combination with components of steel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lwet.uni-rostock.de/en/research/design-concepts-for-wind-turbines/third-generation-floating-offshore-foundation-sof-3/|title=Third-Generation Floating Offshore Foundation (SOF-3) - Stiftungslehrstuhl für Windenergietechnik - Universität Rostock|website=www.lwet.uni-rostock.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
A main focus of the TLP design is on the modularity and the possibility of assembly in any dry dock near to the installation site and without the use of construction vessels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nLjeSqaER0|title=Transport und Installation GICON®-SOF mit Fundament und Schwergewichtsanker|first=|last=GICON Firmengruppe|date=21 August 2015|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frank Adam u. a.: Entwicklung eines Fundaments für Offshore-Windenergieanlagen aus Stahl-Beton-Verbundbauteilen. In: Schiff &amp; Hafen. Heft 11/2016, S. 40–43, ISSN 0938-1643&lt;/ref&gt; 
After offshore location is reached, joints of TLP and anchor will be decoupled and the gravity anchor will be lowered down by using ballast water. Once the anchor has reached the bottom, it is filled with sand. One unique feature of the system is the sufficient floating stability during transport as well as during operations.

In October 2017, model tests took place in the model test facility of French École Centrale de Nantes (ECN) with 1:50 model of the GICON®-TLP incl. wind turbine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.offshorewind.biz/2017/11/10/gicon-floater-passes-first-tank-test-video/?uid=59262|title=Gicon Floater Passes First Tank Test (VIDEO)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on this test a TRL of 5 was reached.

===Ideol===
[[File:Floater fully coated hires.jpg|alt=|thumb|Steel floating substructure designed by Ideol for 3.2 MW NEDO project (Japan) based on Ideol technology, fully coated in dry dock before wind turbine installation]]
[[File:Floatgen.jpg|thumb|left|Ideol's 2MW floating wind turbine installed off France ]]
Ideol’s engineers have developed and patented a ring-shaped floating foundation based on a central opening system (Damping Pool) used for optimizing foundation + wind turbine stability. As such, the sloshing water contained in this central opening counteracts the swell-induced floater oscillations. Foundation-fastened mooring lines are simply attached to the seabed to hold the assembly in position. This floating foundation is compatible with all wind turbines without any modification and has reduced dimensions (from 36 to 55 metres per side for a wind turbine between 2 and 8 MW). Manufacturable in concrete or steel, this floating foundation allows for local construction near project sites. Ideol leads the FLOATGEN project, a floating wind turbine demonstration project based on Ideol’s technology, built by Bouygues Travaux Publics and to be installed off the coast of Le Croisic on the offshore experimentation site of Ecole Centrale de Nantes (SEM-REV). The construction of this project, France's first offshore wind turbine (precisely 2 MW), is completed and the floating wind turbine was installed in April 2018.

In June 2015, the company has sealed its first commercial contract with the Japanese conglomerate Hitachi Zosen, for the design of the two latest Japanese floating offshore wind demonstrators.&lt;ref&gt;http://renews.biz/85423/french-help-japan-with-floaters/&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2016, Ideol and Hitachi Zosen have signed a contract launching the construction phase of their 2 floating offshore wind turbines. Construction of the first one, manufactured in steel, is completed in dry dock and due to be commissioned before September 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.rechargenews.com/wind/1511342/steel-ideol-floating-wind-unit-ready-for-tow-out-off-japan|title=Steel Ideol floating wind unit ready for tow-out off Ja|date=13 June 2018|work=Recharge {{!}} Renewable energy news and articles|access-date=19 June 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2017, the French government has  selected Eolmed, a consortium led by Quadran in association with Ideol, Bouygues Travaux Publics and Senvion, a French renewable energy developer, for the development and construction of a 25MW Mediterranean floating offshore wind farm 15&amp;nbsp;km off the coastal town of Gruissan (Languedoc-Roussillon), planned to be commissioned 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.offshorewind.biz/2016/07/25/senvion-turbines-to-float-off-french-mediterranean-coast/|title=Senvion Turbines to Float off French Mediterranean Coast|work=Offshore Wind|accessdate=1 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nautica Windpower===
Nautica Windpower has proposed a technique for potentially reducing system weight, complexity and costs for deepwater sites. Scale model tests in open water have been conducted (September 2007) in Lake Erie and structural dynamics modeling was done in 2010 for larger designs.&lt;ref name="LudingtonDailyNews2010"&gt;{{cite web|last=Braciszeski |first=Kevin |title=Why Not Floating Windmills? |publisher=Ludington Daily News |date=23 January 2010 |url=http://www.ludingtondailynews.com/news/47569-why-not-floating-windmills |accessdate=8 February 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714000645/http://www.ludingtondailynews.com/news/47569-why-not-floating-windmills |archivedate=14 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nautica Windpower's Advanced Floating Turbine (AFT) uses a single mooring line and a downwind two-bladed rotor configuration that is deflection tolerant and aligns itself with the wind without an active yaw system. Two-bladed, downwind turbine designs that can accommodate flexibility in the blades will potentially prolong blade lifetime, diminish structural system loads and reduce offshore maintenance needs, yielding lower lifecycle costs.&lt;ref name="USOWC2009"&gt;{{cite web|title=US Offshore Wind Energy: A Path Forward|work=Working Paper page 24|publisher=US Offshore Wind Collaborative|date=16 October 2009|url=http://www.usowc.org/pdfs/PathForwardfinal.pdf|accessdate=7 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===SeaTwirl===
SeaTwirl develops a floating vertical axis wind turbine (VAWT). The floater is based on a SPAR solution and is rotating along with the turbine. The concept limits the need for moving parts as well as bearings in the hub region. SeaTwirl is based in Gothenburg Sweden and is registered on the European growth market First North. 2015 SeaTwirl launched a 30kW prototype in the archipelago of Sweden which is connected to the grid at Lysekil. The aim is to scale the concept and to prove the scalability with a turbine of 1MW size in 2020. The concept is scalable for sizes well over 10MW.

===VolturnUS ===
[[File:VolturnUS 1-8 in Castine ME.jpg|thumb|The VolturnUS design utilizes a concrete semi-submersible floating hull and a composite materials tower designed to reduce both capital and Operation &amp; Maintenance costs, and to allow local manufacturing.]]
VolturnUS is North America’s first floating grid-connected wind turbine. 
It was lowered into the [[Penobscot River]] in [[Maine]] on 31 May 2013 by the [[UMaine Advanced Structures and Composites Center|University of Maine Advanced Structures and Composites Center]] and its partners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Danko|first=Pete|url=http://www.earthtechling.com/2013/05/maine-floating-turbine-in-the-water/|title=First US Floating Wind Turbine Launches In Maine|publisher=EarthTechling|accessdate=2 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nature.com/news/renewable-energy-wind-power-tests-the-waters-1.15992|title=Renewable energy: Wind power tests the waters|work=Nature News &amp; Comment}}&lt;/ref&gt;
During its deployment, it experienced numerous storm events representative of design environmental conditions prescribed by the American Bureau of Shipping (ABS) Guide for Building and Classing Floating Offshore Wind Turbines, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=VolturnUS 1:8|url=http://composites.umaine.edu/our-research/volturnus/|website=UMaine Advanced Structures and Composites Center|publisher=University of Maine|accessdate=5 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The VolturnUS floating concrete hull technology can support wind turbines in water depths of 45 m or more. 
With 12 independent cost estimates from around the U.S. and the world, it has been found to significantly reduce costs compared to existing floating systems.
The design has also received a complete third-party engineering review.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://composites.umaine.edu/2016/05/30/new-england-aqua-ventus-i-selected-by-the-doe-for-additional-funding/|title=New England Aqua Ventus I Selected by the DOE for up to $39.9 Million in Additional Funding {{!}} Advanced Structures &amp; Composites Center {{!}} University of Maine|website=composites.umaine.edu|access-date=5 July 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160719035555/http://composites.umaine.edu/2016/05/30/new-england-aqua-ventus-i-selected-by-the-doe-for-additional-funding/|archivedate=19 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2016, the UMaine-led New England Aqua Ventus I project won top tier status from the US Department of Energy (DOE) Advanced Technology Demonstration Program for Offshore Wind. This means that the Aqua Ventus project is now automatically eligible for an additional $39.9 Million in construction funding from the DOE, as long as the project continues to meet its milestones.

===WindFloat===
{{external media |align=right | video1 =[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IO7GXLR4YUo A video describing the WindFloat.]}}
[[File:Diagram of Principle Power's WindFloat.jpg|upright|thumb|A diagram of the WindFloat system.]]
WindFloat is a floating foundation for offshore [[wind turbine]]s designed and patented by [[Principle Power]].
A full-scale prototype was constructed in 2011 by Windplus, a joint-venture between [[Energias de Portugal|EDP]], [[Repsol]], Principle Power, A. Silva Matos, Inovcapital, and FAI.&lt;ref name=bgWP/&gt; 
The complete system was assembled and commissioned onshore including the turbine. 
The entire structure was then wet-towed {{convert|400|km}} (from southern to northern Portugal) to its final installed location {{convert|5|km}} offshore of Aguçadoura, [[Portugal]], previously the [[Aguçadoura Wave Farm]].

The triangular platform is then "moored" using a conventional [[catenary]] mooring consisting of four lines, two of which are connected to the column supporting the turbine, thus creating an "asymmetric mooring."&lt;ref name="REW200812"&gt;{{cite news|last=Balogh|first=Emily |title=Deepwater Offshore Wind Power Generation Using Oil and Gas Platform Technology |publisher=RenewableEnergyWorld.com |date=18 December 2008|url= http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2008/12/deepwater-offshore-wind-power-generation-using-oil-and-gas-platform-technology-54314 |accessdate=3 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As the wind shifts direction and changes the loads on the turbine and foundation, a secondary hull-trim system shifts ballast water between each of the three columns.&lt;ref name=ingWP&gt;Rasmussen, Daniel.

Source: ''Ing.dk'', 21 February 2011. Accessed: 22 February 2011 ''"When the wind turns, the platform is kept level by pumping more water into one of the three cylinders."''&lt;/ref&gt; 
This permits the platform to maintain even keel while producing the maximum amount of energy. 
This is in contrast to other floating concepts which have implemented control strategies that de-power the turbine to compensate for changes in turbine thrust-induced overturning moment.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

''GSP Jupiter'' drilling rig was designed by [[Sonnat Offshore]] and was built by [[Petrom]] at the [[Port of Galați|Galaţi Shipyard]] in 1987.&lt;ref name="jupiter"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gspoffshore.com/download/technical_documents/GSP%20Jupiter.pdf|title=GSP Jupiter|year=2010|publisher=Grup Servicii Petroliere|language=Romanian|accessdate=4 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rig was completely reconstructed and refurbished in 2007 at a cost of US$55 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telegrafonline.ro/1186434000/articol/32838/platforma_8222jupiter8221_din_nou_in_marea_neagra.html|title=Platforma „Jupiter”, din nou în Marea Neagră|date=7 August 2007|publisher=''Telegraf Online''|language=Romanian|accessdate=4 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rig was owned and operated by [[Petrom]] from 1987 to 2005 when the company sold its six offshore platforms (including [[GSP Atlas|Atlas]], Jupiter, [[GSP Orizont|Orizont]], [[GSP Prometeu|Prometeu]] and [[GSP Saturn|Saturn]]) to [[Grup Servicii Petroliere]] for US$100 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sfin.ro/articol_9126/gsp_vrea_platforme_de_foraj_in_marea_nordului.html|title=GSP vrea platforme de foraj in Marea Nordului|date=25 May 2007|publisher=''Săptămâna Financiară''|language=Romanian|accessdate=4 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''GSP Jupiter'' has a length of {{convert|52.4|m|ft}}, breadth of {{convert|40.8|m|ft}}, draft of {{convert|9.75|m|ft}}, height of {{convert|120|m|ft}} and depth of {{convert|6.4|m|ft}}. She has a maximum drilling depth of {{convert|9100|m|ft}} and she could operate at a water depth of {{convert|91|m|ft|-2}}.&lt;ref name="jupiter"/&gt; As a drilling rig, ''GSP Jupiter'' is equipped with advanced drilling equipment and has to meet strict levels of certification under international law. ''GSP Jupiter'' is able to maneuver with its own [[engine]]s (to counter [[Stokes drift|drift]] and ocean currents), but for long-distance relocation it must be moved by specialist [[tugboat]]s. The rig is capable of withstanding severe sea conditions including {{convert|12|m|ft}} waves and {{convert|155|km/h|mi/h}} winds.&lt;ref name="jupiter"/&gt;

==Operations==
Currently the GSP Jupiter is operated by the [[Great Britain|British]] company [[Melrose Resources]] which uses the drilling rig at its [[Black Sea]] [[oil]] and [[natural gas]] prospects. On 19 May 2010 the GSP Jupiter started a drilling program at the [[Kaliakra East gas field]] which is thought to have 59 bcft of natural gas. After finishing this program the rig will be moved to the [[Kavarna East gas field]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.novinite.com/view_news.php?id=116363|title=Melrose Resources Teams Up with GSP Jupiter in Bulgaria|date=19 May 2010|publisher=novinite.com|accessdate=4 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Optokoppler.gif|thumb|right|An [[opto-isolator]] is a very popular method of isolation in digital circuits.]]
[[File:Optoisolator topologies both.svg|thumb|right|Cross-section of [[dual in-line package]] opto-isolators.  Relative sizes of LED (red) and sensor (green) are exaggerated.]]

'''Galvanic isolation''' is a principle of isolating functional sections of [[Electricity|electrical systems]] to prevent current flow; no direct conduction path is permitted.&lt;ref&gt;John Huntington ''Show Networks and Control Systems: Formerly Control Systems for Live Entertainment '' 2012 {{ISBN|0615655904}}, page 98 &lt;/ref&gt; Energy or information can still be exchanged between the sections by other means, such as [[capacitance]], [[electromagnetic induction|induction]] or electromagnetic waves, or by optical, acoustic or mechanical means.

Galvanic isolation is used where two or more electric circuits must communicate, but their [[Ground (electricity)|grounds]] may be at different [[Electric potential|potentials]]. It is an effective method of breaking [[ground loop (electricity)|ground loops]] by preventing unwanted current from flowing between two units sharing a ground [[electrical conductor|conductor]]. Galvanic isolation is also used for safety, preventing [[electric shock|accidental current from reaching ground through a person's body]].

==Methods ==

===Transformer===
[[Transformer]]s couple by [[magnetic flux]]. The primary and secondary windings of a transformer are not connected to each other (an [[autotransformer]] has a conductive connection between its windings and so does not provide isolation). The voltage difference that may safely be applied between windings without risk of breakdown (the isolation voltage) is specified in [[kilovolt]]s by an [[Technical standard|industry standard]]. The same applies to [[Magnetic amplifier|transductors]]. While transformers are usually used to change voltages, [[isolation transformer]]s with a 1:1 ratio are used in safety applications.

If two [[electronic system]]s have a common ground, they are not galvanically isolated. The common ground might not normally and intentionally have connection to functional poles, but might become connected. For this reason isolation transformers do not supply a ''GND/earth pole''.

===Opto-isolator===
[[Opto-isolator]]s transmit information by [[light waves]]. The sender ([[light source]]) and receiver ([[Photosensitivity|photosensitive device]]) are not electrically connected; typically they are held in place within a matrix of transparent, insulating plastic.

===Capacitor===
[[Capacitor]]s allow [[alternating current]] (ac) to flow, but block [[direct current]]; they couple ac signals between circuits at different direct voltages.  Depending on conditions, a capacitor may fail and become "short circuited", ending its electric isolation function, which creates risk to the "now connected circuit" and, possibly, human danger. To address this question, there are special ratings for capacitors used for safety isolation, such as "Class Y".

===Hall effect===
[[Hall effect sensor]]s allow an inductor to transfer information across a small gap magnetically. Unlike opto-isolators they do not contain a light source with a finite life, and in contrast to a transformer based approach they don't require DC balancing.

===Magnetoresistance===
[[Giant magnetoresistance#Applications|Magnetocouplers]] use [[giant magnetoresistance]] (GMR) to couple from AC down to DC.

==Applications==
Optocouplers are used within a system to decouple a function block from another connected to the [[power grid]] or other high voltage, for safety and equipment protection. For example, power semiconductors connected to the line voltage may be switched by optocouplers driven from low-voltage circuits, which need not be insulated for the higher line voltage. 

Transformers allow the output of a device to "float" relative to ground to avoid 
potential ground loops. Power isolation transformers  increase the safety of a device, so that a person touching a live portion of the circuit will not have current flow through them to earth. Power sockets intended for [[electric razor]] supply may use an [[isolation transformer]] to prevent an electric shock if the razor should be dropped into water.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8457">[[File:Salicornia europaea MS 0802.JPG|thumb|right|300px|''[[Salicornia]] europaea'' (common  glasswort).]]

The '''glassworts''' are various succulent, annual [[halophytes]] plants, that is, plants that thrive in [[saline water|saline]] environments, such as seacoasts and [[salt marshes]]. The original English glasswort plants belong to the [[genus]] ''[[Salicornia]]'', but today the glassworts include halophyte plants from several genera, some of which are native to continents unknown to the medieval English, and growing in ecosystems, such as [[mangrove]] swamps, never envisioned when the term glasswort was coined.

The common name "glasswort" came into use in the 16th century to describe plants growing in England whose ashes could be used for making [[soda ash|soda-based]] (as opposed to [[potash]]-based) [[glass]].&lt;ref&gt;"Definition of ''glasswort''," ''Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd Edition'' (Oxford University Press, 1989). Definition retrieved from [http://www.oed.com online edition] (subscription required) July 20, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Turner"&gt;Turner, William (1995). ''A New Herball: Parts II and III'', edited by George T. L. Chapman, Frank McCombie, and Anne U. Wesencraft (Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-0-521-44549-8}}). This book contains a facsimile of Turner's original 1562 and 1568 volumes, along with an edited transcript. The transcript of Turner's article on Kali (p. 673) includes the sentence "Kali, as I do remember, hath no name in English, and although it be very plenteous in England, yet I never could meet with any man that knew it. But lest this herb should be without a name, it may be called Saltwurt, because it is salt in taste, and Salalkali is made thereof. It may also be called Glas Wede, because the ashes of it serve to make glass."&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Industrial uses==
The ashes of glasswort plants, and also of their Mediterranean counterpart [[saltwort]] plants, yield [[soda ash]], which is an important ingredient for [[glassmaking]] and [[soapmaking]]. Soda ash is an [[alkali]] whose active ingredient is now known to be [[sodium carbonate]]. 
Glasswort and saltwort plants sequester the sodium they absorb from salt water into their tissues (see ''[[Salsola soda]]''). Ashing of the plants converts some of this sodium into [[sodium carbonate]] (or "soda," in one of the old uses of the term).

In the medieval and early post-medieval centuries, various glasswort plants were collected at tidal marshes and other saline places in the Mediterranean region. The collected plants were burned. The resulting ashes were mixed with water. Sodium carbonate is soluble in water. Non-soluble components of the ashes sank to the bottom of the water container. The water with the sodium carbonate dissolved in it was then transferred to another container, and then the water was evaporated off, leaving behind the sodium carbonate. Another major component of the ashes that is soluble in water is potassium carbonate, a.k.a. potash. The resulting product consisted mainly of a mixture of sodium carbonate and potassium carbonate. This product was called "soda ash" (was also called "alkali"). It contained 20% to 30% sodium carbonate. For glassmaking, it was superior to a potash product obtained by the same procedure from the ashes of non-salty plants. If plant ashes were not washed as just described, they were still usable in glassmaking but the results were not as good.

The appearance of the word ''glasswort'' in English is reasonably contemporaneous with a 16th-century resurgence in English glassmaking, which had suffered a long decline after Roman times.&lt;ref&gt;Engle, Anita (1977). ''Readings in Glass History: No. 8'' (Phoenix Press, Jerusalem,  ASIN B0007BPWYG). Quoted in
[https://www.jstor.org/stable/3103401 review] by Haden, H. J. (1973). ''Technology and Culture'', Vol. 19, No. 3 pp. 548&amp;ndash;550.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kurinsky, Samuel (1991). ''The Glassmakers: Odyssey of the Jews'' (Hippocrene Books, {{ISBN|978-0-87052-901-6}}). See also the [http://www.hebrewhistory.info/factpapers.htm web version], retrieved July 31, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; This resurgence was led by glassmakers who emigrated to England from [[Lorraine (province)|Lorraine]] and from [[Venice]]. The Lorraine glassmakers brought with them the technology of [[forest glass]], the greenish glass that used [[potash]] from wood ashes as a flux. The [[Venetian glass]]makers brought with them the technology of [[cristallo]], the immaculately clear glass that used [[soda ash]] as a flux. These glassmakers would have recognized ''[[Salicornia europaea]]'' growing in England as a source for soda ash. Prior to their arrival, it was said that the plant "hath no name in English."&lt;ref name="Turner" /&gt;

By the 18th century, [[Spain]] had an enormous industry producing soda ash from saltworts; the soda ash from this source was known as ''[[barilla|barrilla]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Pérez, Joaquín Fernández (1998). [https://www.webcitation.org/5W0IroD9s?url=http://www.ucm.es/info/antilia/revista/vol4-en/ant4-1-en.htm "From the barrilla to the Solvay factory in Torrelavega: The Manufacture of Saltwort in Spain,"] ''Antilia: The Spanish Journal of History of Natural Sciences and Technology,'' Vol. IV, Art. 1. {{ISSN|1136-2049}}. Archived at WebCite from [http://www.ucm.es/info/antilia/revista/vol4-en/ant4-1-en.htm this original URL] on 2008-03-01.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Scotland]] had a large 18th-century industry producing soda ash from seaweed. The source of this ash was [[kelp]]. This industry was so lucrative that it led to overpopulation in the [[Western Isles]] of Scotland, and one estimate is that 100,000 people were occupied with "kelping" during the summer months.&lt;ref&gt;Clow, Archibald and Clow, Nan L. (1952). ''Chemical Revolution,'' (Ayer Co Pub, June 1952), pp. 65&amp;ndash;90. {{ISBN|0-8369-1909-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the same period, soda ash (''la soude de Narbonne'') was produced in quantity from glasswort proper around [[Narbonne]], France.&lt;ref&gt;Pereira, Jonathan (1842). ''Elements of Materia Medica and Therapeutics, Vol. I'' (Longman, Brown, Green, and Longmans, London), p. 551. Pereira indicates that ''soude de Narbonne'' was obtained from ''Salicornia herbacea'', and had an alkali content of 14-15%. Online version at https://books.google.com/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fremy, Edmond (1883). ''Encyclopédie Chimique: Tome V, Application de Chimique Inorganique'' (Dunod, Paris), p. 548. [https://books.google.com/books?id=saQAAAAAMAAJ Online version] retrieved July 21, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The commercialization of the [[Leblanc process]] for synthesizing sodium carbonate (from salt, [[limestone]], and [[sulfuric acid]]) brought an end to the era of farming for soda ash in the first half of the 19th century.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4745">'''''Imagineering''''' is a [[portmanteau]] combining the words "imagination" and "engineering". Imagineering is the implementation of creative ideas in practical form.

The word is a [[Registered trademark symbol|registered trademark]] of [[The Walt Disney Company]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IMAGINEERING - Trademark Details|url=https://trademarks.justia.com/738/03/imagineering-73803332.html|publisher=Justia Trademarks|accessdate=21 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is well known for its use within the name of [[Walt Disney Imagineering]]; however, contrary to popular belief, the term was neither coined by Disney, nor did it originate there. The word was "invented" by [[Alcoa]] around 1940, and appeared widely in numerous publications of several disciplines such as urban design, geography and politics, evolutionary economics, corporate culture and futures studies.

==Earliest usages==
[[Image:Alcoa-time-02-16-1942-059.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|Alcoa's 1942 advertisement of "The Place They Do Imagineering"]]During [[World War II]], [[Alcoa]] created an internal "Imagineering" program to encourage innovative usage of aluminum in order to keep up with demand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Aluminum Exhibits Its Versatility in Art, Life|last=Bykon|first=Maureen|date=November 2000|url=http://www.tms.org/pubs/journals/jom/0011/byko-0011.html|publisher=JOM}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] magazine ad from February 16, 1942, titled "The Place They Do Imagineering" relates the origin:
{{blockquote|For a long time we've sought a word to describe what we all work at hard here at Alcoa... IMAGINEERING is the word... Imagineering is letting your imagination soar, and then engineering it down to earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Place They Do Imagineering|url=http://graphic-design.tjs-labs.com/show-picture?id=1118935951&amp;size=FULL|publisher=''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''|date=1942-02-16|page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Other notable pre-Disney usages include an October 24, 1942, mention in ''The New York Times'' in an article titled "Christian Imagineering," a 1944 [[Oxford English Dictionary]] entry which cites an advertisement from the ''Wall Street Journal'', and the use by artist [[Arthur Radebaugh]] to describe his work, which was mentioned in the article "Black Light Magic,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bp0.blogger.com/_sGYULzoQCgA/RkkUljB_-_I/AAAAAAAAAnQ/ZwsShB1vkjk/s1600-h/1947+May+2+Portsmouth+Times+-+Portsmouth+OH+imagineering.jpg|title=1947+May+2+Portsmouth+Times+-+Portsmouth+OH+imagineering.jpg (image)|website=bp0.blogger.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the ''Portsmouth Times'', [[Portsmouth, Ohio]], 1947.

Other early usage includes Richard F. Sailer's 1957 article "BRAINSTORMING IS IMAGINation enginEERING"  written for the ''[[National Carbon Company]] Management Magazine'', and reprinted by the [[Union Carbide|Union Carbide Company]].

WED Enterprises applied for a trademark for the term in 1967, claiming first use in 1962.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

In 1981, a book with the title ''Imagineering for Health: Self-Healing Through the Use of the Mind'', authored by Serge King, was published by Quest Books ([[Wheaton, Illinois]]).&lt;!-- (listed among the references of ''Developing a 21st Century Mind'' by Marsha Sinetar, Villard Books, NY 1991) --&gt;

* [[Imagineering Australia]], a [[microcomputer]] software and hardware distributor founded by Australian businessman [[Jodee Rich]].
* [[Larsen &amp; Toubro]] (L&amp;T), an Indian engineering and construction giant, in its advertising. It has been used in its ad campaign, released in mainline publications and on outdoor media nationwide describing the new tagline of the company - "It's all about Imagineering".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110113182620/http://www.larsentoubro.com/|title=Cached by Google on 2017-06-20 at larsentoubro.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Applied Imagineering]], used by Dr. Snyder in the United States Salvation Naval Academy. "The quantum concepts generated with our imaginations are applied with words and deeds.

'''Jinisys Software Inc.''' is a [[Philippines|Filipino]] software engineering company that delivers various [[property management system]] for hospitality and real estates. Headquartered in Cebu Holdings Center, [[Cebu Business Park]], [[Cebu City]], [[Philippines]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://download2.polytechnic.edu.na/pub4/sourceforge/f/fo/folioplushotelmanagementsystem/COMPANY%20PROFILE%20JINISYS%20SOFTWARE.pdf |title=Company Profile Jinisys Software}}&lt;/ref&gt; with other offices in Northgate Cyberzone, Filinvest City, [[Alabang]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jinisyssoftware.com/contact-us/ |title=Jinisys Software Inc. contact us}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The company's well-known products are Folio+, Event+, Resto+, Call+, Queue+, and [[SAP Business One]] as re-seller. The company 
also provides custom software development services.

== History ==

It started by two people who have seen the lack automation towards hotel management in the Philippines. As software engineers, they started to develop a software that could handle most [[hotel management]] tasks from basic to advance users. They began to distribute their hotel software to a few clients and their customer grew in time. The company was legally established on year 2008 through Philippine [[Securities and Exchange Commission (Philippines)|SEC]] registration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iregister.sec.gov.ph/MainServlet?param=search |title=Search Reserved/Registered Company Names}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Products ==

On September 5, 2012, Jinisys Software filed and registered a patent right to [[Intellectual Property Office (Philippines)|Intellectual Property Office of the Philippines]] for its product Folio+.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jinisyssoftware.com/products/ |title=Products - Jinisys Software Inc.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://onlineservices.ipophil.gov.ph/tmgazette/Unlimited/Attachment/JO_20130601.PDF |title=Allowed national marks}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://onlineservices.ipophil.gov.ph/tmgazette/Unlimited/Attachment/JO_20121202.pdf |title=Allowed national marks}}&lt;/ref&gt; Folio+ is a [[hotel reservation system]] with additional features that mainly automates hotel management tasks.

Jinisys Software's Resto+ has been included on [[Bureau of Internal Revenue (Philippines)|BIR]]'s list of accredited [[Point of sale|POS]] software in the Philippines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=ftp://ftp.bir.gov.ph/webadmin1/pdf/list_of_acc_crm-pos_and_obm.pdf |title=List of Accredited CRM / POS / Sales Receipting Software}}&lt;/ref&gt; Resto+ is a [[restaurant management software]] that internally interacts with [[Point of sale]] software and hardware.

== Academe ==

Twenty local universities in the Philippines integrated Folio+ with their hospitality curriculum.&lt;ref name="client milestone"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sunstar.com.ph/network/business/2014/05/16/jinisys-software-reaches-420-client-milestone-343175 |title=Jinisys Software Inc. reaches 420-client milestone |work=Sun.Star}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Internationalization ==

In the year 2014, the company started expanding towards Asian countries specifically in [[Papua New Guinea]].&lt;ref name="client milestone"/&gt;

== Partnerships ==

Jinisys Software is a partner of [[SAP SE|SAP]] Philippines&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://global.sap.com/partners/directories/searchpartner.epx |title=SAP (n.d.) Partner Finder}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fitacademy.ph/fellowship-night/ |title=Partners and Educators Fellowship Night}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a [[Cisco Systems|Cisco]] certified partner (Cisco, n.d.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tools.cisco.com/WWChannels/LOCATR/openBasicSearch.do |title=Cisco (n.d.)

by E.M. Grimm, R. van Everdingen, and M. J. L. C. Schöppin.&lt;/ref&gt; '''Loudness units relative to full scale''' ('''LUFS''') is a synonym for LKFS that was introduced in [[EBU]] R128.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=EBU Recommendation R 128: Loudness normalisation and permitted maximum level of audio signals |url=http://tech.ebu.ch/docs/r/r128.pdf |publisher=[[European Broadcasting Union]] |date=August 2011 |page=3 |accessdate=2013-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Loudness units''' ('''LU''') is an additional unit used in EBU R128. It describes L&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; without direct absolute reference and therefore describes loudness level differences.

LKFS is standardized in '''ITU-R  BS.1770'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=ITU-R  BS.1770 Algorithms to measure audio programme loudness and true-peak audio level |url=http://www.itu.int/dms_pubrec/itu-r/rec/bs/R-REC-BS.1770-0-200607-S!!PDF-E.pdf |publisher=International Telecommunications Union ([[ITU]])}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2011, the ITU introduced a loudness gate in the second revision of the recommendation, ITU-R BS.1770-2.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=ITU-R  BS.1770-2 Algorithms to measure audio programme loudness and true-peak audio level |url=http://www.itu.int/dms_pubrec/itu-r/rec/bs/R-REC-BS.1770-2-201103-S!!PDF-E.pdf |publisher=International Telecommunications Union}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2012, the [[ITU]] released the third revision of this recommendation ITU-R BS.1770-3.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=ITU-R  BS.1770-3 Algorithms to measure audio programme loudness and true-peak audio level |url=http://www.itu.int/dms_pubrec/itu-r/rec/bs/R-REC-BS.1770-3-201208-S!!PDF-E.pdf |publisher=International Telecommunications Union}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2015, the ITU released the fourth revision of this recommendation ITU-R BS.1770-4.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=ITU-R  BS.1770-4 Algorithms to measure audio programme loudness and true-peak audio level |url=https://www.itu.int/dms_pubrec/itu-r/rec/bs/R-REC-BS.1770-4-201510-I!!PDF-E.pdf |publisher=International Telecommunications Union}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EBU has suggested that the ITU should change the unit to LUFS, as LKFS does not comply with scientific naming conventions and is not in line with the standard set out in ISO 80000-8. Furthermore, they suggest the symbol for 'Loudness level, k-weighted' should be '''L&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''', which would make L&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; and LUFS equivalent when LUFS indicates the value of L&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt; with reference to digital full scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title= EBU Tech 3343 - Practical guidelines for Production and Implementation in accordance with EBU R 128 |url=https://tech.ebu.ch/docs/tech/tech3343.pdf |publisher=European Broadcasting Union |accessdate=2014-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

LKFS and LUFS are identical in that they are both measured in absolute scale and both equal to one [[decibel]] (dB).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Loudness Explained |url=https://www.tcelectronic.com/brand/tcelectronic/loudness-explained|publisher=TC Electronics |accessdate=2018-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lars Löfgren was involved in extending the logical and linguistic approaches to various problems raised by early cybernetics. His work helped
develop a more consistent conceptual base for cybernetics through a holistic approach to second order cybernetics.&lt;ref name="ASC award"/&gt;

He was one of the internationally renown cyberneticians invited by [[Heinz von Förster]] to the [[Biological Computer Laboratory]],&lt;ref name="BHE"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Beginning of Heaven and Earth Has No Name: Seven Days with Second-Order Cybernetics by Heinz Von Foerster, 2014 {{!}} Online Research Library: Questia|url=https://www.questia.com/library/120081345/the-beginning-of-heaven-and-earth-has-no-name-seven|website=www.questia.com|accessdate=20 January 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he did most of his work while professor at [[Lund University]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2404">The '''Lewis number''' ('''Le''') is a [[dimensionless number]] defined as the ratio of [[thermal diffusivity]] to [[mass diffusivity]]. It is used to characterize [[fluid]] flows where there is simultaneous heat and mass transfer.

It is defined as&lt;ref&gt;E.R. Cohen et al. "Quantities, Units and Symbols in Physical Chemistry", IUPAC Green Book 3rd Ed., IUPAC &amp; RSC Publishing, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Le} = \frac{\alpha}{D} = \frac{\lambda}{\rho D_{im} c_p}&lt;/math&gt; 

where &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is the [[thermal diffusivity]] and &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; the [[mass diffusivity]], &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; the [[thermal conductivity]], &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; the [[density]], &lt;math&gt;D_{im}&lt;/math&gt; the mixture-averaged diffusion coefficient, and &lt;math&gt;c_p&lt;/math&gt; the specific heat capacity at constant pressure. 

The Lewis number can also be expressed in terms of the [[Prandtl number]] and the [[Schmidt number]] :
:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Le} = \frac{\mathrm{Sc}}{\mathrm{Pr}}&lt;/math&gt;.

It is named after [[Warren K. Lewis]] (1882–1975),&lt;ref&gt;W. K. Lewis: ''The Evaporation of a Liquid Into a Gas'' In: ''Transactions of the American Society of Mechanical Engineers'', No. 1849, 1922, p. 325-340.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. Klinkenberg, H. H. Mooy: ''Dimensionless Groups in Fluid Friction, Heat, and Material Transfer'' In: ''Chemical Engineering Progress'', Vol. 44, No. 1, 1948, p. 17-36.&lt;/ref&gt; who was the first head of the Chemical Engineering Department at [[MIT]]. Some workers in the field of combustion assume (incorrectly) that the Lewis number was named for [[Bernard Lewis (scientist)|Bernard Lewis]] (1899–1993), who for many years was a major figure in the field of combustion research.

== History ==

=== Inspiration ===
Back in 2009, Md. Waliullah Bhuiyan, founder of Light of Hope, was working on a rural project with [[BRAC (NGO)|BRAC]] in a small village of Patuakhali. In that village, they were talking with a group of women about how they make money for living. As there was no electricity on that 'Chor' area, some people from local market developed solar energy for electricity. The village people started going to the local market and charge their cell phones with exchange of an amount of money. Electricity providers were making profit out of this as well as using it for their own works. So, the women of that area used the idea as it could help them to earn some extra money. Ambiya Khatun was the pioneer of this idea. She first applied that idea in practical. She convinced her husband who was a rickshaw puller, to start this business. Somehow that poor couple managed the money and bought a solar system from Grameen Shakti on monthly installment and set their business up. The business went successful and they made a good profit out of this. Watching them doing business successfully, many people got involved into this business and the area was being developed gradually. Md. Waliullah Bhuiyan was inspired by this improvement. 
Md. Waliullah Bhuiyan made the plan of this project and shared it with his two friends Nasimul Islam Maruf  and Md. Asaduzzaman Shoeb. They liked the plan and designed the project. But there was financial problem. They did not have enough money to start the project and no one was agreed to sponsor it. So, they were waiting for an opportunity to start their project.

=== Dell Education Challenge 2013 ===
Dell issued its second Dell Education Challenge in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.dell.com/learn/us/en/uscorp1/secure/2013-06-24-dell-education-challenge/ |title=Dell Education Challenge to Support and Fund Innovative Learning Approaches |work=Dell |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131010040255/http://www.dell.com/learn/us/en/uscorp1/secure/2013-06-24-dell-education-challenge |archive-date=10 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dell sought their inspiration, imagination and innovation to re-engineer today's learning environments, both in and outside of the classroom. The competition sought to continue to inspire innovative ideas from around the world that would help solve today's biggest issues in education, including those identified in a poll commissioned by Dell about new education models. The poll showed that respondents view a personalized approach to learning as most effective.

More than 400 projects were submitted in the last Dell Education Challenge and the winning teams were bringing their ideas to fruition. Grand prize winner, Forward Tutoring, was helping to create more support for individual learning needs and support for students by students via their online platform where credits are earned for volunteering in the community. Those students then redeemed their credits for tutoring from other qualified students. Tutors in turn could earn scholarships and internships from supporting organizations. Dell's competition was mainly focused on social entrepreneurship.

The founder, Md. Waliullah Bhuiyan and his co-founders,  Mr. Nasimul Islam Maruf and Md. Asaduzzaman Shoeb shared their plan with their friends and family. As all of them engineers, they started thinking about how they can use our idea in practical field. Then Dell Education Challenge 2013 came up. They were studying in different countries at that time. They arranged a meeting on the skype and discussed the matter. After discussing, they submitted their project to Dell Education Challenge, 2013. Their idea got selected to the top 50. After the final selection, their idea got the third position and they got an invitation letter to Texas. Md. Waliullah went to Texas for the final competition. The other participant teams from U.S. and Texas, had already taken their project on pilot phase. But Md. Waliullah's idea was still not on working condition. If they had enough funding, they would start working. So, they won the third position along with the 2500 dollar price.They went for [[crowdfunding]] over the internet and gathered 4500 dollar. With a total sum of 6000 dollars they started their pilot project targeting two of schools as our first mission. Today those two of schools are running their multimedia education successfully. One school is in Chittagong and another is in Kishoregonj in Bangladesh. Now they have their project going successfully. They have targeted 4000 schools all over Bangladesh to be multimedia schools.

== Project 'PORUA- The Reader' ==
Light of Hope started their journey with a school project. And now they have another project running called 'PORUA- The Reader'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/porua-the-reader#/story/ |title=Porua- The Reader |work= INDIEGOGO}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a campaign for collecting books. The goal of this project is to create reader among the poor and neglected children who has thirst for knowledge but cannot afford books. In this Porua campaign, the 'Porua' team members collect books in different ways like they go to different schools and universities to collect books. They mainly ask for primary level story books. They also ask different social organization for donation. For an example, there is an organization in America named Room to Read. They donate books as a social service. Team 'Porua' asked them for donation. Also people who want to donate money can contact with this 'Porua' team. They ran their first campaign on AIUB, as they started the journey of our organization from there. 'Porua' team collected almost 200 books in one day and they got a wonderful response. Their campaign went successful and they wanted to spread the campaign countrywide. They opened a Facebook event for collecting books and set our representative in different universities for collecting books. Many organizations like [[BRAC (NGO)|BRAC]], [[Room to Read]], [[Save the Children]] etc. donated books to this project. rokomari.com donated 200 books. They have 3 years project plan for 'Porua- the Reader' and their target is to set up library in 500 schools.

A '''meat thermometer''' or '''cooking thermometer''' is a [[thermometer]] used to measure the internal temperature of [[meat]], especially roasts and [[steak]]s, and other cooked foods. The degree of "doneness" of meat or [[bread]] correlates closely with the internal temperature, so that a thermometer reading indicates when it is cooked as desired. When cooking, food should always be cooked so that the interior reaches a temperature sufficient, that in the case of meat is enough to kill pathogens that may cause [[foodborne illness]] or, in the case of bread, that is done [[baking]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://bakingbites.com/2008/02/how-do-you-know-when-bread-is-done-baking/ How do you know when bread is done baking?]&lt;/ref&gt; the thermometer helps to ensure this.

==Characteristics==

A meat thermometer is a unit which will measure core temperature of meats while cooking. It will have a metal probe with a sharp point which is pushed into the meat, and a dial or [[digital display]]. Some show the temperature only; others also have markings to indicate when different kinds of meat are done to a specified degree (e.g., "beef medium rare").

Meat thermometers are usually designed to have the probe in the meat during cooking. Some use a [[Bi-metallic strip#Applications|bimetallic strip]] which rotates a needle which shows the temperature on a dial; the whole thermometer can be left inside the oven during cooking. Another variety commonly used on [[Domesticated turkey|turkey]] is the pop-up timer, which uses a spring held in by a soft material that "pops up" when the meat reaches a set temperature.

Other types use an electronic sensor in the probe, connected by a flexible heat-resistant cable to a display. The probe is inserted in the meat, and the cable comes out of the oven (oven seals are flexible enough to allow this without damage) and is connected to the display. These types can be set to sound an alarm when the specified temperature is reached. Wireless types, where the display does not have to be close to the oven, are also available.

==Models==
Meat thermometers have many different models, such as single probe and multiprobe.

Single probe models are usually the cheapest, but they can only monitor one section of the meat. So you need to insert the probe into different places to monitor the whole piece of meat.
Multiprobe models are more expensive, and usually can connect 2-8 probes. More probes means you can more accurately monitor the temperature of the whole piece meat.

==Use==
[[File:Bratenthermometer-1.jpg|thumb|A meat thermometer with various cooking temperatures denoted for various meat types]]
The probe can be inserted into the meat before starting cooking, and cooking continued until the desired internal temperature is reached. Alternatively the meat can be cooked for a certain time and taken out of the oven, and the temperature checked before serving. The tip of the probe should be in the thickest part of the meat, but not touching bone, which conducts heat and gives an overestimate of the meat temperature.

===Poultry===
For [[poultry]] insert the meat thermometer into the thigh, but do not touch the bone. The suggested temperature for poultry to reach before it is safe to consume is 74&amp;nbsp;°C (165&amp;nbsp;°F), unless the [[poultry]] is stuffed, in which case the temperature in the center of the [[stuffing]] should be about 74&amp;nbsp;°C (165&amp;nbsp;°F).&lt;ref name="Canadian Food Inspection Authority"&gt;[http://www.inspection.gc.ca/english/fssa/concen/tipcon/thermoe.shtml Canadian Food Inspection Authority] Accessed 2014-10-17&lt;/ref&gt;

===Beef, lamb, or veal===
For [[beef]], [[lamb and mutton|lamb]], or [[veal]] insert the meat thermometer away from bone, fat, or cartilage.  The meat should reach a temperature of between 63&amp;nbsp;°C (145&amp;nbsp;°F) for medium-rare, and 77&amp;nbsp;°C (170&amp;nbsp;°F) for well done.&lt;ref name="Canadian Food Inspection Authority" /&gt;

===Pork===
[[Pork]] needs to reach the same temperature 71&amp;nbsp;°C (160&amp;nbsp;°F) as [[beef]], [[lamb and mutton|lamb]], or [[veal]] and the same rules for use of the thermometer apply.&lt;ref name="Canadian Food Inspection Authority" /&gt;

===Ground meat ===
For [[ground meat]], you should insert the digital food thermometer into the thickest part of the piece. For [[hamburger]]s you should insert the thermometer probe through the side of the [[patty]], all the way to the middle. Make sure to check each piece of meat or patty because heat can be uneven. Temperature should be 71&amp;nbsp;°C (160&amp;nbsp;°F) for [[beef]], [[lamb and mutton|lamb]], [[veal]], or [[pork]] and 74&amp;nbsp;°C (165&amp;nbsp;°F) for [[poultry]].&lt;ref name="Canadian Food Inspection Authority" /&gt;

=== Casseroles, and eggs===
For [[casserole]]s, and [[egg (food)|egg]]s insert the thermometer into the thickest area. The temperature for casseroles should be 71&amp;nbsp;°C (160&amp;nbsp;°F) and for eggs 74&amp;nbsp;°C (165&amp;nbsp;°F).&lt;ref name="Canadian Food Inspection Authority" /&gt;

=== Seafood ===

For [[fish]] the temperature should be 70&amp;nbsp;°C (158&amp;nbsp;°F). For [[shellfish]] (for example, [[shrimp]], [[lobster]], [[crab]], [[scallop]]s, [[clam]]s, [[mussel]]s and [[oyster]]s) the temperature should be at 74&amp;nbsp;°C (165&amp;nbsp;°F). For shellfish that are difficult to open, discard any that did not open during cooking.&lt;ref name="Canadian Food Inspection Authority" /&gt;
===Bread===

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15240">'''Medical photography''' is a specialized area of photography that concerns itself with the documentation of the clinical presentation of patients, medical and surgical procedures, medical devices and specimens from autopsy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Peres|first1=Michael R.|title=Focal Encyclopedia of Photography|year=2007|publisher=Focal Press|author2=Larsson, Staffan, Brane, Jonas|edition=Fourth|editor=Peres, Michael R.|page=569}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice requires a high level of technical skill to present the photograph free from misleading information that may cause misinterpretation. The photographs are used in clinical documentation, research, publication in scientific journals and teaching.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Williams|first=Robin|title=Medical Photography Study Guide|year=1984|publisher=MTP Press Limited|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The profession==

===Employment===
Medical photographers document patients at various stages of an illness, injuries and before and after surgical procedures. They record the work of healthcare professionals to assist in the planning of treatment and education of the public and other healthcare professionals. The nature of the work requires a respect for and sensitivity to people, an awareness of sterile procedures and an adherence to privacy legislation and policies.

The BioCommunications Association, in a survey commissioned in 2008 of individuals working in medical photography, found that most medical photographers are employed by university affiliated hospitals and research centers. Ten percent were freelancers working in specialty clinics such as dermatology, ophthalmology and plastic surgery. A few of these provided services to the medical-legal profession. Medical photographers photograph patients in clinics, wards and in operating rooms. They may also be called to photograph an autopsy and gross specimens in the pathology department. Specialized photography techniques using photomacrography and ultra-violet and fluorescence photography may also be used. The role of the medical photographer has changed over the years from being exclusively medical to incorporating more general photography of a commercial or editorial nature to support public relations and education. Video production is playing an increased role; medical photographers are often responsible for video conferencing from operating rooms and are involved in tele-medicine. Departments employing medical photographers tend to number five people or less. Some medical photographers specialize in areas such as ophthalmology and dermatology.

===Education and training===
Most medical photographers have a degree in photography from a college or university and frequently have a degree in the sciences. They need to have a good understanding of photographic and optical principles, and also understand the technical requirements of a particular job in order select or modify equipment. Knowledge of digital imaging software is necessary to edit and output images while maintaining scale and color balance.

An interest in science and medicine are important. A basic knowledge of anatomy and physiology coupled with a working knowledge of medical terminology is required in order to discuss the photographic needs with medical staff and other healthcare providers. Because they are working with patients, medical photographers must have the manners and sensitivity to make patients comfortable while being photographed. They must also be aware of the laws governing privacy and copyright.

== History ==
The sciences were quick to realize the merits of photography because of its perceived ability to present an objective image of what was seen. This solved a problem of representation by artists who were asked to produce illustrations only from description or highly influenced by the interpretation of physicians and surgeons. The first application of photography in medicine appears in 1840 when [[Alfred François Donné]] of the Charité Hospital in Paris photographed sections of bones and teeth. He began making daguerreotypes through a microscope. Donné published engravings made from photographs by his student [[Léon Foucault]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Donné |first1=Alfred|title=Cours de microscopie complémentaire des etudes médicales, execute d’apres nature au microscop-daguerréotype|year=1845|publisher=Balliere|location=Paris|author2=Foucault,Léon}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hugh Welch Diamond]], a physician and founding member of the [[Royal Photographic Society]], used photography as a tool in medicine, particularly in the field of mental illness. He was working in the women’s section of the Surrey County Asylum in Twickenham in 1852, where he attempted to create a catalog of visual signs of insanity by photographing the patients and organizing the photographs by symptom. [[Duchenne de Boulogne|Guillaume-Benjamin Duchenne de Boulogne]] began photographing inmates in the [[Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital|Salpêtrière]] mental hospital in Paris in 1856. He devised a method for activating individual muscles of the face through electronic stimulation. With the assistance of Adrien Tournachon, brother of [[Nadar (photographer)|Felix Nadar]], he photographed facial expressions and at one point listed 53 emotions that could be identified based on the muscular action. His work was published in 1862 in ''[[Mécanisme de la physionomie humaine]]'' in what was the most remarkable of all photographically illustrated books in medical science prior to 1900.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kemp|first=Martin|title=Beauty of Another Order, Photography in Science.|year=1997|publisher=Yale University Press|pages=136|editor=Thomas, Ann}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Duchenne-FacialExpressions.jpg|thumb|G.-B. Duchanne de Boulogne, Synoptic plate 4 from ''Le Mécanisme de la Physionomie Humaine''. 1862, [[albumen print]]. In the upper row and the lower two rows, patients with different expressions on either side of their faces]]
[[Jean-Martin Charcot|Dr. Jean-Martin Charcot]], a student of Duchenne de Boulogne, believed like Diamond that photographs would play a significant role in the diagnosis and management of patients. A medical photography unit was established at Salpêtrière hospital in Paris in 1878 by Charcot. He hired [[Albert Londe]] who worked at Salpêtrière under Charcot's supervision. Londe was to not only make photographs but to create new apparatus to record signs and symptoms. Charcot began publishing ''Nouvelle iconographie de la Salpêtriere'' in 1888 that used photographs to show clinical presentations of cases at Salpêtrière. Londe published a major reference on the practice of medical photography ''La Photographie médicale''. in 1893. Londe developed a systematic method for photographing patients in fixed views that took into account depth of field and distortion caused by lens design and lens to subject distance.

There was growing interest in cultures and peoples in distant regions of the globe and photography was a way to place them under study especially when combined with influences from the study of [[phrenology]] and Darwin’s work on natural selection. In 1850, [[Joseph T. Zealy]] (1812–93) was commissioned by [[Louis Agassiz]] to make daguerreotypes of plantation workers of African origin in the southern United States of America. The pictures were intended as scientific documentation to support theories of ethnology. Carl Damman published a collection of photographs of different ethnic groups in ''Anthropologisch-ethnographisches Album in Photographien''. and in the same year William Marshall published ''A phrenologist amongst the Todas, or the Study of a Primitive Tribe in South India. History, Character, Customs, Religion, Infanticide, Polyandry, Language''. [[Thomas Henry Huxley|Thomas Huxley]] established a system of photographing the human body with fixed views which included a rod of known dimension to make measurements. [[Francis Galton]] believed it was possible to systematically organize traits of inheritable attributes, intellectual, moral and physical with respect to families, groups, classes and racial types. He believed that mental attributes could be measured by studying physical attributes. In an effort to identify and group characteristics, he made composites of up to two hundred photographs to create a universal physiognomy example of a group or type.
 
Dr. [[Reed Brockway Bontecou|Reed B.

Attempts to publish medical photographs in anatomy text books was met with limited success in the early years of photography. The lack of textural and tonal variation made photographs difficult to interpret. This may have been due to the spectral sensitivity of early materials to blue, violet and ultra-violet light. This grouped the other tones together and rendered them as similar shades of black. Orthochromatic plates did not become commercially available until 1883 and even then the process allowed separation only of the blues, greens and yellows. In 1861, [[Nikolaus Rüdinger|Nicolaus Rüdinger]] published ''Atlas des peripherischen Nervensystems des menchlichen Körpers, Cotta’schen'', using photographs by Joseph Albert of frozen sections. The photographs had to be retouched to make the structures obvious. [[Stereoscopy|Sterophotography]] became of interest as a way to add a three-dimensional quality to show the spatial relationships of gross anatomy and clinical case studies. Between 1894-1900, Albert Neisser of Leipzig produced a stereo atlas of anatomy and pathology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ludwig S. Neisser|first=Albert|title=Stereoskopischer Atlas.

There were attempts to photograph inside the body as early as 1883. Emil Behnke used a carbon arc lamp, lenses and reflectors to photograph human vocal cords at exposures of ¼ second.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Behnke |first1=Emil |title=Voice, Song and Speech|year=1883|publisher=Low, Marston, Searle and Rivington|location=London|author2=Brown,Lennox}}&lt;/ref&gt; Walter Woodbury had published a “photogastroscope” in 1890 that showed pictures of the interior of the stomach&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Woodbury|first=Walter|title=Encyclopedia of Photography|year=1890|publisher=Iliffe|location=London|pages=509–510}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1894, Max Nitze published photographs of the bladder using a cystoscope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Nitze|first=Max|title=Kystophotographischer Atlas|year=1894|publisher=Bergman, Wiesbaden}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1870, Maury and Duhring had established a journal based on using medical photography, ''The Photographic Review of Medicine and Surgery'', published by Lippincott in Philadelphia, USA provided case studies and before and after photographs. Most major centres of medical education had adopted photography as a method of documentation and study by the 1900s. Many photographers were working in multi-faceted disciplines from radiology, pathology and ophthalmology. Medical photography became a special field of photography and in 1931 a group of photographers working in medicine came together at [[Yale University]] in the United States of America to form the Biological Photographic Association, which later became the BioCommunications Association Inc.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bca.org&lt;/ref&gt; The group  published a journal; the Journal of Biological Photography which was later incorporated into the Journal of BioCommunication.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jbiocommunication.org&lt;/ref&gt; Other organizations formed in England, Scandinavia and Australia. Photography continues today to play a role in medicine through documentation, research and education.

During the [[Middle Ages]] from the 5th century AD to the 16th century, Western Europe saw a blooming period for the mining industry. The first important mines here were those at Goslar in the Harz mountains, taken into commission in the tenth century. Another famous mining town is Falun in Sweden where copper has been mined since the thirteenth century.
The rise of Western European mining industry depended, of course, closely on the increasing weight of Western Europe on the stage of world history. Although the subject has sometimes been overlooked by historians, advances in Medieval mining and metallurgy  made the flourishing of Western European civilization to a large extent possible.

Metallurgical activities were also encouraged by central political power, regional authorities, [[monastic orders]] and ecclesiastical overlords, who always tried to have control and claimed Regalian rights over the mines and a share in the output, both in private lands and regions belonging to the Crown. They were particularly interested in the extraction of the precious metal ores, but not only, and for this reason the mines in their territories were open to all miners (Nef 1987, 706-715).

== Early Middle Ages, 5th to 10th centuries==
The social, political, economic stagnation and decline that followed the Roman World affected Europe, throughout the early medieval period, and had critical impact upon the technological progress, trade and social organization. Technological developments that affected the course of metal production were only feasible within a stable political environment, and this was not the case until the 9th century (Martinon-Torres &amp; Rehren in press, a).

During the first medieval centuries, the output of metal was in a steady decline and constraint in small scale activities. Miners adopted methods much less efficient than those of the [[Roman times]]. [[Ores]] were extracted only from shallow depths or from remnants of former abandoned mines, assuming that the old shafts weren't already sunk. The vicinity of the mine to villages or towns was also a determinant factor when deciding about working on site, because of the high cost of material transportation (Martinon-Torres &amp; Rehren in press, b). It seems like only the output of [[iron]] diminished less in relation to the rest of the base and precious metals until the 8th century. This fact, correlated with the dramatic decrease in [[copper]] production, in particular, may indicate a possible displacement of copper and [[bronze]] artifacts from iron ones (Forbes 1957, 64; Bayley et al. 2008, 50).

By the end of the 9th century, economic and social conditions, which dictated the increased need of metal for agriculture, arms, stirrups, and decoration, started to favor metallurgy and a slow but steady general progress was noted. Smelting sites were multiplied and new mines were discovered and exploited, like the well-known [[Mines of Rammelsberg]], close to the town of Goslar by the [[Harz Mountains]]. [[Open-cast mining]] and metallurgical activities were mostly concentrated in the Eastern Alps, Saxony, Bohemia, Tuscany, the Rhineland, Gaul and Spain (Nef 1987). French, Flemish, but mainly German miners and metallurgists were the generators of metal production.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; north of [[Oberschulenberg]] in [[Germany]].]]
The period right after the 10th century, marks the widespread application of several innovations in the field of mining, and ore treatment. It marks a shift to large scale and better quality production. Medieval miners, and metallurgists, had to find solutions for the practical problems that limited former metal production, in order to meet the market demands for metals. The increased demand for metal was due to the remarkable population growth from the 11th to the 13th centuries. This growth had impact on agriculture, trade, and building construction, including the great Gothic churches.

The main concern had to do with inefficient means for draining water out of shafts and [[adite|tunnels]] in [[underground mining]]. This resulted in the flooding of mines which limited the extraction of ore to shallow depths close to the surface.

The secondary concerns were the separation of the metal bearing minerals from the [[gangue|worthless material]] that surrounds, or is closely mixed with, it. There was also the difficulty of the transportation of the ore, which resulted in additional high costs.

The economic value of mining resulted in investment in the development of solutions to these problems, which had a distinct positive impact on medieval metal output. This included innovations such as [[water power]] using [[waterwheel]]s for powering draining engines, [[bellows]], [[hammers]]; or the introduction of advanced types of furnaces. These innovations were not adopted at once, or applied to all mines and smelting sites. Throughout the medieval period these technical innovations, and the traditional techniques, coexisted. Their application depended on the time period, and geographical region. Water power in medieval mining and metallurgy was introduced well before the 11th century, but it was only in the 11th century that it was widely applied. The introduction of the [[blast furnace]], mostly for iron smelting, in all the established centres of metallurgy contributed to quantitative and qualitative improvement of the metal output, making metallic iron available at a lower price.

In addition, [[cupellation]], developed in the 8th century, was more often used. It is used for the refinement of lead-silver ores, to separate the silver from the lead (Bayley 2008). Parallel production with more than one technical method, and different treatment of ores would occur wherever multiple ores were present at one site. (Rehren et al. 1999).

Underground work in [[Ventilation shaft|shafts]], although limited in depth, was accomplished either by [[fire-setting]] for massive ore bodies or with iron tools for smaller scale extraction of limited veins. The sorting of base and precious metal ores was completed underground and they were transferred separately (Martinon-Torres &amp; Rehren in press, b).

Permanent mining in [[Sweden proper]] begun in the [[High Middle Ages]] and did not spread to Finland until 1530 when the first iron mine was begun operations there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Eilu |first=P.|last2=Boyd |first2=R.|last3=Hallberg |first3=A.|last4=Korsakova |first4=M.|last5=Krasotkin |first5=S.|last6=Nurmi |first6=P.A.|last7=Ripa |first7=M.|last8=Stromov |first8=V.|last9=Tontti |first9=M. |date=2012 |chapter=Mining history of Fennoscandia|title=Mineral deposits and metallogeny of Fennoscandia|editor-last=Eilu|editor-first=Pasi |url= |location=Espoo |publisher= |pages=19–32 |isbn=978-952-217-175-7 |author-link=|series=Geological Survey of Finland, Special Paper|volume=53 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Late Middle Ages, 14th to 16th centuries==
[[File:Beschreibung allerfürnemisten mineralischen Ertzt unnd Bergkwercks Arten Title Page AQ24 (3).TIF|thumb|upright|''Beschreibung allerfürnemisten mineralischen Ertzt unnd Bergkwercks Arten (Description of most distinguished kinds of mineral ores and mines)'' by Lazarus Ercker, 1580]]
By the 14th century, the majority of the more easily accessible ore deposits were exhausted. Thus, more advanced technological achievements were introduced in order to keep up with the demand in metal. The alchemical laboratory, separating precious metals from the baser ones they are typically found with, was an essential feature of the metallurgical enterprise.  However, a significant hiatus in underground mining was noted during the 14th and the early 15th century because of a series of historical events with severe social and economic impacts. The [[Great Famine of 1315–1317|Great Famine]] (1315–1317), the [[Black Death]] (1347–1353), which diminished European population by 1/3 to 1/2, and the [[Hundred Years War]] (1337–1453), which amongst others caused severe deforestation, had also dramatic influences in metallurgical industry and trade. Lead mining, for example, ground to a halt due to the Black Death pandemic, when atmospheric lead pollution from smelting dropped to natural levels (zero) for the first and only time in the last 2000 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/2017GH000064/full| author=Alexander More et al.| title=Next generation ice core technology reveals true minimum natural levels of lead (Pb) in the atmosphere: insights from the Black Death| publisher=GeoHealth, American Geophysical Union| date=May 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.popsci.com/black-death-plague-air-pollution| author=Kate Baggaley| title=The Black Death helped reveal how long humans have polluted the planet| publisher=Popular Science Magazine| date=September 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/humans-polluted-air-much-earlier-previously-thought-180963528/| author=Erin Blakemore| title=Humans Polluted the Air Much Earlier than Previously Thought| publisher=Smithsonian Magazine| date=June 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://eos.org/scientific-press/human-activity-has-polluted-european-air-for-2000-years| author=American Geophysical Union| title=Human Activity Has Polluted European Air for 2000 Years| publisher=Eos Science News| date=May 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The great demand of metals, e.g. for armour, could not be met due to the lack of manpower and capital investment.

It was only by the end of the 13th century that great capital expenditures were invested and more sophisticated machinery was installed in underground mining, which resulted in reaching great depths. The wider application of water- and horse-power was necessary for draining water out of these deep shafts. Also, acid parting in separating gold from silver was introduced in the 14th century (Bayley 2008). However, notable signs of recovery were present only after the mid-15th century, when the improved methods were widely adopted (Nef 1987, 723).

Determinant for the European metal production and trade was the discovery of the [[New World]], which has affected world economy ever since. Even though new rich ore deposits were found in Central Europe during the 15th century, this was not enough to meet the large amounts of precious metal imports from America.

== Smiths and miners within medieval society ==
Metallurgists throughout medieval Europe were free to move within different regions. German metallurgists in search of rich precious metal ores, for instance, took the leading part in mining and affected the course of metal production, not only in East and South Germany but in almost all Central Europe and the Eastern Alps. As mining gradually became a task for specialized craftsmen, miners moved in large groups and they formed settlements with their own customs close to mines. They were always welcome by the regional authorities since the latter were interested in increasing the revenue and the exploitation of the mineral-rich subsurface was quite profitable. The authorities, lay and ecclesiastical, claimed a part of the output and smiths and miners were provided with land for cottages, mills, [[forge]]s, farming, and pasture and they were allowed to use streams and lumber (Nef 1987, 706-715).

Progressing to the high and late Middle Ages, as smelting sites became geographically independent from mines, metalworking was separated from ore smelting. The urban expansion from the 10th century onwards and the dominant role of towns provided metallurgists with the right environment to develop and improve their technology. Metallurgists got organized in [[guilds]] and, usually, their workshops were concentrated in town peripheries (McLees 1996).

In medieval societies, liberal and mechanical arts were considered as totally different from each other. Metallurgists, as all craftsmen and artisans, lacked the methodical intellectual background but they were the pioneers of causal thinking, based on empirical observation and experimentation (Zilsel 2000).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6868">The '''National Innovation System''' (also '''NIS''', '''National System of Innovation''') is the flow of technology and information among people, enterprises and institutions which is key to the innovative process on the national level. According to [[innovation system|innovation system theory]], [[innovation]] and technology development are results of a complex set of relationships among actors in the system, which includes enterprises, universities and government research institutes.

==Origins of term==
The term National System of Innovation originated when [[Christopher Freeman]] and [[Bengt-Åke Lundvall]] worked together in the late 1980s. Freeman's research drew heavily on political economy of [[Friedrich List]] and his historical account of the rise of Japan as an economic superpower. Lundvall's work explored the important social interactions between suppliers and customers and their role in encouraging innovation in Denmark.  Apart from a general definition, as above, there is no [[canon (basic principle)|canon]]ical definition of national innovation systems. A few dominant definitions are listed below (quoted by the [[OECD]] publication [http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/35/56/2101733.pdf National Innovation Systems], 1997) which overlap quite a bit:

A national system of innovation has been defined as follows:

* '' .. the network of institutions in the public and private sectors whose activities and interactions initiate, import, modify and diffuse new technologies.''&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher Freeman|Freeman, C.]] (1995), “The National System of Innovation in Historical Perspective”, Cambridge Journal of Economics, No. 19, pp. 5–24&lt;/ref&gt;
* '' .. the elements and relationships which interact in the production, diffusion and use of new, and economically useful, knowledge ... and are either located within or rooted inside the borders of a nation state.''&lt;ref&gt;[[B.-Å. Lundvall|Lundvall, B-Å.]] (ed.) (1992). National Innovation Systems: Towards a Theory of Innovation and Interactive Learning, Pinter, London.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''... a set of institutions whose interactions determine the innovative performance ... of national firms.''&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, R. (ed.) (1993), National Innovation Systems. A Comparative Analysis, Oxford University Press, New York/Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '' .. the national institutions, their incentive structures and their competencies, that determine the rate and direction of technological learning (or the volume and composition of change generating activities) in a country.''&lt;ref&gt;Patel, P. and K. Pavitt (1994), “The Nature and Economic Importance of National Innovation Systems”, STI Review, No. 14, OECD, Paris.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''.. that set of distinct institutions which jointly and individually contribute to the development and diffusion of new technologies and which provides the framework within which governments form and implement policies to influence the innovation process. As such it is a system of interconnected institutions to create, store and transfer the knowledge, skills and artefacts which define new technologies.''&lt;ref&gt;Metcalfe, S. (1995), “The Economic Foundations of Technology Policy: Equilibrium and Evolutionary Perspectives”, in P. Stoneman (ed.), Handbook of the Economics of Innovation and Technological Change, Blackwell Publishers, Oxford (UK)/Cambridge (US).&lt;/ref&gt;

A country’s innovative performance largely depends on how these actors relate to
each other as elements of a collective system of knowledge creation and use as well as
the technologies they use. For example, public research institutes, academia and
industry serve as research producers carrying out R&amp;D activities. On the other hand,
governments either central or regional play the role of coordinator among research
producers in terms of their policy instruments, visions and perspectives for the future.
Furthermore, in order to promote innovation the different innovative actors must
have strong linkages with each other based on a strong level of trust and governments
should promote and activate trust among the different innovation actors.&lt;ref&gt;Chung, S. Building a National Innovation System through regional innovation systems, Technovation Volume 22, Issue 8, August 2002, Pages 485-491Available&lt;/ref&gt; The linkages can take the form of joint research, personnel exchanges, crosspatenting,
and purchase of equipment&lt;ref&gt;Organisation for Economic Co-operation AND Development, National Innovation Systems,&lt;/ref&gt; (OECD, 1997).
Finally, NSI are shaped by distinct socio-cultural qualities of national communities.
Therefore, there are national trajectories of innovativeness, technology orientation and
learning, which results in each nation, either highly developed or not, having some
kind of NSI, no matter if working well or not.&lt;ref&gt;Eissebith, M., ‘Bridging Scales in Innovation Policies: How to Link Regional, National and International Innovation Systems’, European Planning Studies Vol. 15, No. 2, February 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Further more, the
Success factors of NSI have been seen by many scholars in the creation of supportive
institutions and organizations (with a key role of education) and collaboration
linkages Bridging Scales in Innovation Policies throughout the various elements that
constitute a NSI. Examples include public R&amp;D and companies, as well as common
objectives and innovative cultures of agents, altogether entailing self reinforcing
progress and synergies. Differences in the structures and strategies of NSI among
various economically successful countries indicate however, that there is no universal
best practise recipe.&lt;ref&gt;Eissebith, M., ‘Bridging Scales in Innovation Policies: How to Link Regional, National and International Innovation Systems’, European Planning Studies Vol. 15, No. 2, February 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2394">A '''Normally Unmanned Installation (NUI)''' is a type of automated offshore [[Oil platform |Oil/Gas platform]] designed to be primarily operated remotely, without the constant presence of personnel.  

These generally were characterized by their small size, often consisting of just a [[well bay]] with a [[helipad]] on top.  
They are often a compromise of providing the convenience of surface [[wellhead]]s, which are easier to build and maintain, while avoiding the high operating costs of a full [[production platform]].

They are generally only used in shallower water, where constructing many small NUIs is a relatively easy and cheap option as compared to the cost of using subsea wells.  

This can be seen in the Southern [[North Sea]] where large numbers of wells are on smaller NUIs, compared with the more northern areas of the continental shelf where fewer larger platforms and subsea sites are the norm. NUIs are also common offshore Western Australia where distances to populated areas are huge.

NUIs are commonly serviced from a nearby larger platform, e.g., [[Eastern Trough Area Project|Mungo]] serviced from [[Marnock]].  These installations will include an emergency shelter with essential food and water in order to provide a safe refuge in the event that weather or other considerations prevent a visiting crew from returning to base.  Regular visits may be made for [[Planned maintenance|routine maintenance]] and for smaller [[well work]] such as [[Slickline|wireline]] operations.  Anything larger requires a [[drilling rig]] to be brought in, but this is still an advantage over subsea wells, which require a [[drilling rig]] or light intervention vessel for any [[well intervention]].

In recent times NUI has become a phase within the decommissioning of previously manned offshore installations. Platforms would generally be positively isolated from [[hydrocarbons]] and flushed clean to suit environmental issues. Platforms would then only be visited infrequently for integrity checks and maintenance of temporary equipment left for power requirements and safety functionality. The platform would then remain in this phase until further decommissioning activities are carried out to remove the topsides in modules or piece small, then remove the [[wikt:jacket|jacket]].

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to control engineering:

'''[[Control engineering]]''' &amp;ndash; engineering discipline that applies control theory to design systems with desired behaviors. The practice uses sensors to measure the output performance of the device being controlled and those measurements can be used to give feedback to the input actuators that can make corrections toward desired performance. When a device is designed to perform without the need of human inputs for correction it is called automatic control (such as cruise control for regulating a car's speed).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="46979">'''Peaceful nuclear explosions''' ('''PNEs''') are [[nuclear explosion]]s conducted for non-military purposes. Proposed uses include excavation for the building of [[canal]]s and [[harbours]], electrical generation, the use of nuclear explosions to drive spacecraft, and as a form of wide-area [[Hydraulic fracturing|fracking]]. PNEs were an area of some research from the late 1950s into the 1980s, primarily in the [[United States]] and [[Soviet Union]].

In the US, a series of tests were carried out under [[Project Plowshare]]. Some of the ideas considered included blasting a new [[Panama Canal]], the use of underground explosions to create electricity, and a variety of geological studies. The largest of the excavation tests was carried out in the [[Sedan (nuclear test)|Sedan nuclear test]] in 1962, which released large amounts of radioactive gas into the air. By the late 1960s, public opposition to Plowshare was increasing, and a 1970s study of the economics of the concepts suggested they had no practical use. Plowshares saw decreasing interest from the 1960s, and was officially cancelled in 1977.

The Soviet program started a few years after the US efforts and explored many of the same concepts under their [[Nuclear Explosions for the National Economy]] program. The program was more extensive, eventually conducting 239 nuclear explosions. Some of these tests also released radioactivity, including a significant release of [[plutonium]] into the groundwater and the polluting of an area near the [[Volga River]]. A major part of the program in the 1970s and 80s was the use of very small bombs to produce shock waves as a seismic measuring tool, and as part of these experiments, two bombs were successfully used to seal blown-out oil wells. The program officially ended in 1988.

As part of ongoing [[arms control]] efforts, both programs came to be controlled by a variety of agreements. Most notable among these is the 1976 Peaceful Nuclear Explosions Treaty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fordlibrarymuseum.gov/library/document/0248/whpr19760527-013.pdf |date=May 28, 1976 |title=Announcement of Treaty on Underground Nuclear Explosions Peaceful Purposes (PNE Treaty) |publisher=Gerald R. Ford Museum and Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=6245 |title= Gerald R. Ford: "Message to the Senate Transmitting United States-Soviet Treaty and Protocol on the Limitation of Underground Nuclear Explosions," July 29, 1976 |author1=Peters, Gerhard |author2=Woolley, John T |publisher = University of California - Santa Barbara |work= The American Presidency Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Comprehensive Nuclear-Test-Ban Treaty]] of 1996 prohibits all nuclear explosions, regardless of whether they are for peaceful purposes or not. Since that time the topic has been raised several times, often as a method of [[asteroid impact avoidance]].

==Peaceful Nuclear Explosions Treaty==
In the PNE Treaty, the signatories agreed: not to carry out any individual nuclear explosions having a [[Nuclear weapon yield|yield]] exceeding 150 [[kilotons]]; not to carry out any group explosion (consisting of a number of individual explosions) having an aggregate yield exceeding 1,500 kilotons; and not to carry out any group explosion having an aggregate yield exceeding 150 kilotons unless the individual explosions in the group could be identified and measured by agreed verification procedures. The parties also reaffirmed their obligations to comply fully with the [[Limited Test Ban Treaty]] of 1963.

The parties reserve the right to carry out nuclear explosions for peaceful purposes in the territory of another country if requested to do so, but only in full compliance with the yield limitations and other provisions of the PNE Treaty and in accord with the [[Non-Proliferation Treaty]].

Articles IV and V of the PNE Treaty set forth the agreed verification arrangements. In addition to the use of national technical means, the treaty states that information and access to sites of explosions will be provided by each side, and includes a commitment not to interfere with verification means and procedures.

The protocol to the PNE Treaty sets forth the specific agreed arrangements for ensuring that no weapon-related benefits precluded by the [[Threshold Test Ban Treaty]] are derived by carrying out a nuclear explosion used for peaceful purposes, including provisions for use of the [[hydrodynamic]] yield measurement method, [[seismic]] monitoring and on-site inspection.

The agreed statement that accompanies the treaty specifies that a "peaceful application" of an underground nuclear explosion would not include the developmental testing of any nuclear explosive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Peaceful Nuclear Explosions Treaty|url=http://www.armscontrol.org/documents/pnet|publisher=Arms Control Association|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130506134002/http://www.armscontrol.org/documents/pnet|archivedate=2013-05-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States: Operation Plowshare==
[[Image:Project Chariot plans.jpg|thumb|right|upright|One of the ''Chariot'' schemes involved chaining five thermonuclear devices to create the artificial harbor.]]
[[Operation Plowshare]] was the name of the U.S. program for the development of techniques to use [[nuclear explosive]]s for peaceful purposes. The name was coined in 1961, taken from [[Book of Micah|Micah]] 4:3 ("And he shall judge among the nations, and shall rebuke many people: and they shall beat their [[swords to ploughshares|swords into plowshares]], and their spears into pruning hooks: nation shall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any more").  Twenty-eight nuclear blasts were detonated between 1961 and 1973.

One of the first U.S. proposals for peaceful nuclear explosions that came close to being carried out was [[Operation Chariot (1958)|Project Chariot]], which would have used several [[hydrogen bomb]]s to create an [[artificial harbor]] at [[Cape Thompson, Alaska|Cape Thompson]], Alaska. It was never carried out due to concerns for the native populations and the fact that there was little potential use for the harbor to justify its risk and expense. There was also talk of using nuclear explosions to excavate a second [[Panama Canal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=https://archive.org/stream/congressionalrec114junit#page/n3/mode/1up|title=Report of the Atlantic–Pacific transoceanic canal study commission|place=Washington, DC, [[United States of America|US]]|type=message from the President|newspaper=Congressional Record: proceedings &amp; debates of the 90th Congress, second session|page=25747|date= 1968-09-05|series=Senate|publisher=Congress|quote=The collection of data was substantially completed on Route 17 in Panama one of the routes considered for nuclear excavations… The Atomic Energy Commission has recently conducted the first two of the planned series of nuclear excavation experiments designed to determine the feasibility of nuclear excavation of a sea level canal.|accessdate=2012-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest excavation experiment took place in 1962 at the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]]'s [[Nevada Test Site]]. The [[Sedan (nuclear test)|Sedan nuclear test]] carried out as part of [[Operation Storax]] displaced 12 million tons of earth, creating the largest human-made crater in the world, generating a large [[nuclear fallout]] over [[Nevada]] and [[Utah]]. Three tests were conducted in order to [[Operation Plowshare#Natural gas stimulation experiment|stimulate natural gas production]], but the effort was abandoned as impractical because of cost and [[radioactive contamination]] of the gas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|place=US|publisher=Department of Energy, Office of Legacy Management|title=Rulison, CO|contribution=Site|format=[[PDF]]|type=fact sheet|contribution-url=http://www.lm.doe.gov/Rulison/Fact_Sheet_-_Rulison,_Colorado.pdf|title-link=Colorado}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gasbuggy"&gt;{{Citation|title=Project Gasbuggy and Catch-85*: *That's krypton-85, one of the radioactive by-products of nuclear explosions that release natural gas|quote=It's 95 per cent safe? We worry about the other 5|first=Peter|last=Metzger|newspaper=The New York Times|date=February 22, 1970|page=SM14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were many negative impacts from Project Plowshare's 27 nuclear explosions. For example, the [[Gasbuggy]] site,&lt;ref name="gasbuggy"/&gt; located 55 miles east of [[Farmington, New Mexico|Farmington]], New Mexico, still contains nuclear contamination from a single subsurface blast in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.em.doe.gov/SiteInfo/PrjGasBuggy.aspx|publisher=DOE|series=Environmental Management (EM)|title=Gas Buggy|accessdate=2010-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other consequences included blighted land, relocated communities, [[tritium]]-contaminated water, radioactivity, and fallout from debris being hurled high into the atmosphere. These were ignored and downplayed until the program was terminated in 1977, due in large part to public opposition, after $770 million had been spent on the project.&lt;ref name=bks2011&gt;{{Citation|first=Benjamin K|last=Sovacool|year=2011|contribution= [[Contesting the Future of Nuclear Power]]: A Critical Global Assessment of Atomic Energy|title=World Scientific|pages=171–2|title-link=World Scientific}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=November 2016}}

==Soviet Union: Nuclear Explosions for the National Economy==
The [[Soviet Union]] conducted a much more vigorous program of 239 nuclear tests, some with multiple devices, between 1965 and 1988 under the auspices of Program No. 6 and Program No. 7 – [[Nuclear Explosions for the National Economy]].

The initial program was patterned on the US version, with the same basic concepts being studied. One test, [[Chagan (nuclear test)|Chagan test]] in January 1965, has been described as a "near clone" of the US Sedan shot. Like Sedan, Chagan also resulted in a massive plume of radioactive material being blown high into the atmosphere, with an estimated 20% of the fission products with it. Detection of the plume over Japan led to accusations by the US that the Soviets had carried out an above-ground test in violation of the [[Partial Test Ban Treaty]], but these charges were later dropped.

The later, and more extensive, "Deep Seismic Sounding" Program focused on the use of much smaller explosions for various geological uses. Some of these tests are considered to be operational, not purely experimental.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Nordyke|first=MD|title=The Soviet Program for Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Explosions|format=[[PDF]]|publisher=Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory|date=2000-09-01|pages=34–35|id=Report no.: UCRL-ID-124410 Rev 2; US Department of Energy contract no.: W-7405-Eng48|url=https://e-reports-ext.llnl.gov/pdf/238468.pdf|doi=10.2172/793554}}&lt;/ref&gt; These included the use of peaceful nuclear explosions to create  deep [[Seismology|seismic]] profiles. Compared to the usage of conventional explosives or mechanical methods, nuclear explosions allow the collection of longer seismic profiles (up to several thousand kilometers).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |publisher=University of Wyoming |url=http://w3.uwyo.edu/~seismic/dss/ |title=Seismic |contribution=DSS|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308001204/http://w3.uwyo.edu/~seismic/dss/|archivedate=2012-03-08|df=}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are proponents for continuing the PNE programs in modern [[Russia]]. They state that the program already paid for itself and saved the [[USSR]] billions of rubles and can save even more if continued.  They also say that the PNE is the only feasible way to put out large gushers and fires on natural gas deposits and the safest and most economically viable way to destroy [[chemical weapon]]s.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}

Their opponents, including the discredited,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/environment/georgemonbiot/2011/apr/13/anti-nuclear-lobby-interrogate-beliefs "Nuclear opponents have a moral duty to get their facts straight  ''"...report by Alexey Yablokov, Vassily Nesterenko and Alexey Nesterenko, which claims that 980,000 people died as a result of Chernobyl.

Reports on the successful Soviet use of nuclear explosions in extinguishing out-of-control gas well fires were widely cited in United States policy discussions of options for stopping the 2010 Gulf of Mexico [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url= https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/03/us/03nuke.html|title=Nuclear Option on Gulf Oil Spill?

==Other nations==
[[Germany]] at one time considered manufacturing nuclear explosives for civil engineering purposes. In the early 1970s a feasibility study was conducted for a project to [[Qattara Depression Project|build a canal]] from the [[Mediterranean Sea]] to the [[Qattara Depression]] in the Western Desert of [[Egypt]] using nuclear demolition. This project proposed to use 213 devices, with yields of 1 to 1.5 megatons detonated at depths of 100 to 500 meters, to build this canal for the purpose of producing hydroelectric power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archive.unu.edu/unupress/unupbooks/80858e/80858E0a.htm#2.11%2520Mediterranean-Qattara%2520solar-hydro%2520and%2520pwnped-sto|title=Managing water for peace in the Middle East|website=archive.unu.edu|access-date=2016-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://basementgeographer.com/flooding-the-qattara-depression/|title=Flooding the Qattara Depression {{!}} The Basement Geographer|website=basementgeographer.com|access-date=2016-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ministry of Electric Power and Energy|date=1978|title=Development of the Qattara Project, Egypt|url=http://inis.iaea.org/Search/search.aspx?orig_q=RN:13653898|journal=Technical Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Explosions; Vienna, Austria; 22 - 24 Nov 1976|volume=IAEA-TC--81-5/6|issue=|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Australia]], nuclear blasting was proposed as a way of mining iron ore in the [[Pilbara]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|contribution= Nuclear blasting proposed for Pilbara Iron Ore Project|title=Industrial Reviews and Mining Year Book|year=1970|pages=255–9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sedan Plowshare Crater.jpg|thumb|left|The 1962 [[Sedan (nuclear test)|Sedan nuclear test]] formed a crater 100 m (330 ft) deep with a diameter of about 390 m (1,300 ft), as a means of investigating the possibilities of using peaceful nuclear explosions for large-scale earth moving.

Apart from their use as weapons, [[nuclear explosive]]s have been tested and used, in a similar manner to chemical [[high explosives]], for various non-military uses. These have included large-scale earth moving, [[Operation Plowshare|isotope production]] and the stimulation and the closing-off of the flow of [[natural gas]].

At the peak of the [[Atomic Age]], the United States initiated [[Operation Plowshare]], involving "peaceful nuclear explosions". The [[United States Atomic Energy Commission]] chairman announced that the Plowshares project was intended to "highlight the peaceful applications of nuclear explosive devices and thereby create a climate of world opinion that is more favorable to weapons development and tests".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://bos.sagepub.com/content/69/5/56.full |title=Nuclear denial: From Hiroshima to Fukushima |first=Charles |last=Perrow |date=September–October 2013 |volume=69 |issue=5 |journal=Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"semiannual report to Congress in January 1958".

Due to the inability of the U.S. physicists to reduce the fission fraction of small, approximately 1 kiloton, yield nuclear devices that would have been required for many [[civil engineering]] projects, when long term health and clean-up costs from [[fission product]]s were included in the cost, there was virtually no economic advantage over conventional explosives, except for potentially the very largest of projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/060106/6kirsch.htm |title=Q&amp;A with Scott Kirsch: Digging with bombs |publisher=Usnews.com |date= |accessdate=November 25, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100131082633/http://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/060106/6kirsch.htm |archivedate=January 31, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZGXS_Qgfqno Declassified U.S. Nuclear Test Film #35 c. 12:00 minutes]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Qattara Depression Project]], as developed by Professor [[Friedrich Bassler]], who during his appointment to the West German ministry of economics in 1968, put forth a plan to create a Saharan lake and [[hydroelectric]] power station by blasting a tunnel between the [[Mediterranean sea]] and the [[Qattara Depression]] in Egypt, an area that lies below sea level. The core problem of the entire project was the water supply to the depression. Calculations by Bassler showed that digging a canal or tunnel would be too expensive, therefore Bassler determined that the use of nuclear explosive devices, to excavate the canal or tunnel, would be the most economical. The Egyptian government declined to pursue the idea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.miktechnology.com/pdf/Qattara%20Depression%20Potential%20Paper-IEEE%20Egypt%20Conference.pdf|title=Global Hyper Saline Power Generation Qattara Depression Potentials|work=MIK Technology|date=December 19, 2010|accessdate=November 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Soviet Union]] conducted a much more exhaustive program than Plowshare, with 239 nuclear tests, between 1965 and 1988. Furthermore, many of the "tests" were considered economic applications, not tests, in the [[Nuclear Explosions for the National Economy]] program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Nordyke|first=MD|title=The Soviet Program for Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Explosions|format=[[PDF]]|publisher=Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory|date=September 1, 2000|pages=34–35|id=Report no.: UCRL-ID-124410 Rev 2; US Department of Energy contract no.: W-7405-Eng48|url=https://e-reports-ext.llnl.gov/pdf/238468.pdf|doi=10.2172/793554}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The public records for devices that produced the highest proportion of their yield via fusion-only reactions are possibly the [[Pechora–Kama Canal#The nuclear option|Taiga]] Soviet peaceful nuclear explosions of the 1970s, with 98% of their 15 [[kiloton]] explosive yield being derived from fusion reactions, a total fission fraction of 0.3 [[kiloton]]s in a 15 kt device.&lt;ref name="disturbing"&gt;Disturbing the Universe – Freeman Dyson&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bibliotecapleyades.net/ciencia/ciencia_uranium27.htm The Soviet Program for Peaceful Uses of Nuclear Explosions] by Milo D.

The repeated detonation of nuclear devices underground in [[salt domes]], in a somewhat analogous manner to the explosions that power a car [[internal combustion engine]] (in that it would be a [[heat engine]]) has also been proposed as a means of [[fusion power]], in what is termed [[PACER (fusion)|PACER]].&lt;ref&gt;John Nuckolls, [http://www.osti.gov/bridge/servlets/purl/658936-fpqpjO/webviewable/658936.pdf "Early Steps Toward Inertial Fusion Energy (IFE)"], LLNL, June 12, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ralphmoir.com/pacer/ Ralph Moir, PACER development]&lt;/ref&gt; Other investigated uses for low-yield peaceful nuclear explosions were underground detonations to stimulate, by a process analogous to [[fracking]], the flow of [[petroleum]] and [[natural gas]] in [[Tight gas|tight formations]], this was most developed in the Soviet Union, with an increase in the production of many [[well head]]s being reported.&lt;ref name="e-reports-ext.llnl" /&gt;

In 2015, billionaire entrepreneur [[Elon Musk]] popularized an approach in which the cold planet [[Mars]], could be [[Terraforming|terraform]]ed by utilizing the detonation of high-fusion-yielding thermonuclear devices over the mostly [[dry-ice]] containing [[carbon dioxide]]-icecaps on the planet.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost.com"&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/elon-musk-nuke-mars_us_55f1c071e4b093be51bdfffc  Sorry, Elon Musk: One Does Not Simply Nuke Mars Into Habitability “It is silly to expect Mars to become easily habitable.” ]&lt;/ref&gt; Musk's specific suggested plan would not be very feasible within the limitations of the energy of historically manufactured ~megaton range nuclear devices, therefore requiring major advancements in nuclear devices for it to be considered feasible. In part due to these fundamental problems with the concept, the physicist [[Michio Kaku]] who is considered to have initially put forward the concept, instead suggests to use [[nuclear reactor]]s in the typical land based [[district heating]] manner to make isolated [[Biosphere 2|tropical biomes]] on the Martian surface.&lt;ref name="huffingtonpost.com"/&gt;

Alternatively, as nuclear detonations are presently somewhat energy limited in terms of ''demonstrated'' achievable yield, the use of an off-the-shelf [[Asteroid impact avoidance#Stand-off approach|nuclear explosive device could be employed to "nudge"]] a Martian-[[Earth-grazing fireball|grazing comet]] towards the poles of the planet and upon impact would be a much more efficient scheme to deliver the required energy, water vapor, [[greenhouse gases]] and other [[Ammonia#Ammonia.27s role in biological systems and human disease|biologically significant volatiles]] that could begin to quickly terraform Mars, one such missed opportunity for this occurred in October 2014, when a "1 in a million years" comet designated as [[C/2013 A1]], also known as comet "Siding Spring", came within 87,000 miles of the [[martian atmosphere]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2014/12aug_marscomet/ Comet Siding Spring will pass by Mars only 139,500 km away--which would be like a comet passing about 1/3 of the distance between Earth and the Moon.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://luminarydaily.com/comet-grazes-by-mars-atmosphere-in-once-in-a-lifetime-event/ Comet Grazes by Mars’ Atmosphere in ‘Once-In-A-Lifetime’ Event By Luminary Daily]&lt;/ref&gt;

The discovery and synthesis of new [[chemical element]]s by [[nuclear transmutation]], and their production in the necessary quantities to allow the studying of their properties, was carried out in nuclear explosive device testing. For example, the discovery of the short lived [[einsteinium]] and [[fermium]], both created under the intense [[neutron]] flux environment within thermonuclear explosions, followed the first [[Teller-Ulam]] thermonuclear device test – [[Ivy Mike]]. The rapid capture of so many neutrons required in the synthesis of [[einsteinium]] would provide the needed direct experimental confirmation &lt;!--"convincing evidence of the reality of"--&gt; of the so-called [[r-process]], the multiple neutron absorptions needed to explain the cosmic [[nucleosynthesis]] (production) of all heavy chemical elements heavier than [[nickel]] on the periodic table, in [[supernova]] explosions, before [[beta decay]], with the r-process explaining the existence of many stable elements in the universe.&lt;ref&gt;Byrne, J.

The first preliminary examination of the effects of nuclear detonations upon various metal and non-metal materials, occurred in 1955 with [[Operation Teapot]], were a chain of approximately basketball sized spheres of material, were arrayed at fixed aerial distances, descending from the shot tower.&lt;ref name="Operation Teapot 1954"&gt;Declassified video 0800017 - Operation Teapot, Military Effects Studies - 1954. circa 19 mins&lt;/ref&gt; In what was then a surprising experimental observation, all but the spheres directly within the shot tower survived, with the greatest [[ablation]] noted on the aluminum sphere located 60 feet from the detonation point, were slightly over 1 inch of surface material, was absent upon recovery.&lt;ref name="Operation Teapot 1954"/&gt; These spheres are often referred to as "[[Lew Allen]]'s balls", after the project manager during the experiments.&lt;ref name="worldcat.org"&gt;[https://www.worldcat.org/title/project-orion-the-true-story-of-the-atomic-spaceship/oclc/51918543 Project Orion : the true story of the atomic spaceship 2002]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ablation data collected for various materials and the distances the spheres were propelled, serve as the bedrock for the nuclear pulse propulsion study, [[Project Orion (nuclear propulsion)|Project Orion]].&lt;ref name="worldcat.org"/&gt; The direct use of nuclear explosives, by using the impact of ablated propellant [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] from a nuclear [[shaped charge]] acting on the rear pusher plate of a ship, was and continues to be seriously studied as a potential [[propulsion]] mechanism.

Although likely never achieving orbit due to [[aerodynamic drag]], the first [[macroscopic]] object to obtain Earth [[orbital speed|orbital velocity]] was a "manhole cover" propelled by the somewhat focused detonation of test shot [[Operation Plumbbob#Propulsion of steel plate cap|Pascal-B]] in August 1957. The use of a subterranean shaft and nuclear device to propel an object to escape velocity has since been termed a "thunder well".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nuclearweaponarchive.org/Usa/Tests/Plumbob.html#PascalB|title=Operation Plumbbob|publisher=|accessdate=October 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Project Excalibur]] intended to focus these x-rays to allow attacks over long distances.]]
In the 1970s [[Edward Teller]], in the United States, popularized the concept of using a nuclear detonation to power an explosively pumped ''soft'' [[X-ray laser]] as a component of a [[ballistic missile defense]] shield known as [[Project Excalibur]]. This created dozens of highly focused X-ray beams that would cause the missile to break up due to [[laser ablation]].

Laser ablation is one of the damage mechanisms of a [[laser weapon]], but it is also one of the researched methods behind pulsed [[laser propulsion]] intended for spacecraft, though usually powered by means of conventionally pumped, laser arrays. For example, ground flight testing by Professor Leik Myrabo, using a non-nuclear, conventionally powered pulsed laser [[test-bed]], successfully lifted a [[lightcraft]] 72 meters in altitude by a method similar to [[ablative laser propulsion]] in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Laser Propulsion Thrusters for Space Transportation|journal=Springer.com|volume=129|pages=435–454|doi=10.1007/978-0-387-30453-3_17|series = Springer Series in Optical Sciences|year = 2007|last1 = Schall|first1 = W.

A proposed means of averting an [[asteroid]] impacting with Earth, assuming low lead times between [[Torino scale|detection and Earth impact]], is to detonate one, or a series, of nuclear explosive devices, [[surface burst|on]], [[Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator|in]], or in a [[proximity fuze|stand-off]] proximity orientation with the asteroid,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Solem|first=J.

A 2007 [[NASA]] analysis of impact avoidance strategies using various technologies stated:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://neo.jpl.nasa.gov/neo/report2007.html|title=Near-Earth Object Survey and Deflection Analysis of Alternatives Report to Congress March 2007|work=National Aeronautics and Space Administration|accessdate=November 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Nuclear [[proximity fuze|stand-off]] explosions are assessed to be 10–100 times more effective than the non-nuclear alternatives analyzed in this study. Other techniques involving the [[surface burst|surface]] or [[Robust Nuclear Earth Penetrator|subsurface]] use of nuclear explosives may be more efficient, but they run an increased risk of fracturing the target near-Earth object. They also carry higher development and operations risks.

[[File:An aesthetic braille typewriter video.ogv|thumb|"braille typewriter"]]

The '''Perkins Brailler''' is a "braille typewriter" with a key corresponding to each of the six dots of the [[braille]] code, a space key, a backspace key, and a line space key.  Like a manual [[typewriter]], it has two side knobs to advance paper through the machine and a carriage return lever above the keys.  The rollers that hold and advance the paper have grooves designed to avoid crushing the raised dots the brailler creates.

Although braille notation was designed for people who are blind or [[visually impaired]] to read, prior to the introduction of the Perkins Brailler, writing braille was a cumbersome process. Braille writers created braille characters with a [[stylus and slate]] (as developed by [[Louis Braille]]) or by using one of the complex, expensive, and fragile braille writing machines available at the time.

==History==
The original Perkins Brailler was produced in 1951&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Perkins School for the Blind Timeline|url=http://www.perkins.org/about-us/history/historical-timeline.html|accessdate=14 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  by David Abraham (1896–1978), a woodworking teacher at the [[Perkins School for the Blind]].  The director of the Perkins School for the Blind, [[Gabriel Farrell]], asked Abraham to create an inexpensive and reliable machine to allow students to more easily write braille.  Farrell and Abraham worked with Edward Waterhouse, who was a math teacher at Perkins, to create the design for the Brailler.

In 2008, a lighter and quieter version was developed and launched. It also includes an erase key and an integrated carrying handle. The new model won the Silver Award in the 2009 International Design Excellence Awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.boston.com/business/technology/articles/2008/10/03/a_lighter_touch/ |title=A lighter touch: Perkins School hopes compact Braille machine brings renewed interest |date=October 3, 2008 |author=Dave Copeland |work=The Boston Globe}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The paper placement is achieved by rolling the paper onto an internal drum, unrolling it when the user presses a line-feed key, and using a clock-like escapement to move an embossing carriage over the paper.  A system of six cams consisting of rods with a square cross-section transfers keystrokes to the wire-like styli contained in the carriage.  Tolerances are close, and the buildup of oily dirt with normal use necessitates periodic cleaning and adjustment.

==SMART Brailler==
[[File:Perkins SMART brailler.jpg|thumb|The SMART Brailler, invented by David S. Morgan in 2012 combines Next Generation ease of use with modern text-to-speech audio/visual technology (a speaker and digital display) to further aid in Braille literacy.]]

A new version of the Perkins Brailler, the SMART Brailler, was invented by David S. Morgan and released in 2011.  The SMART Brailler is based on the mechanical action of the classic Perkins Brailler, and, when unpowered, is operable as a standard Brailler.  The SMART Brailler includes sensors capturing the mechanical motion of the embosser, and, when powered, adds text-to-speech audio feedback and a digital display for use by both sighted and blind individuals.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.perkins.org/smartbrailler/features-benefits.html&lt;/ref&gt; Software for the SMART Brailler includes multi-lingual speech and Braille support, including English, UK English, Arabic, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, Polish, Russian, and Turkish.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.perkinssmartbrailler.org&lt;/ref&gt;

==Embossers==
With the advent of computers, many users create braille output using a computer and a [[braille embosser]] connected to the computer.  Visually impaired users can read the computer screen by using [[screen reader]] [[computer software]] and/or [[braille display]]s.  Users of such a system can use a computer keyboard in the standard way for typing or can use a special keyboard driver that allows the six keys ''sdf-jkl'' to be used as a braille entry device similar to the Perkins Brailler.

==Braille notetakers==
Many visually impaired users use electronic portable note-taking devices that allow keyboard entry in braille using the 6-key layout of the Perkins Brailler and output in synthesized speech and/or a one or two-line [[refreshable braille display]] consisting of tiny pins made of metal and plastic.

Notetakers include PDA features such as an address book and calculator.  Because of the many moving parts and the accessibility of the refreshable braille displays to the environment, notetakers are typically quite expensive.  They are easily damaged and must be returned to their country of origin for periodic cleaning.

A '''planter''' is a [[agricultural machinery|farm implement]], usually towed behind a [[tractor]], that [[sowing|sows]] (plants) [[seed]]s in rows throughout a [[field (agriculture)|field]].&lt;ref name="fin"&gt;http://farmindustrynews.com/mag/farming_bulking_2/&lt;/reff&gt;http://cornandsoybeandigest.com/equipment/planting-perfection-0215/&lt;/ref&gt; It is connected to the tractor with a drawbar or a [[three-point hitch]]. Planters lay the seeds down in precise manner along rows. Planters vary greatly in size, from 1 row to 54, with the biggest in the world being the 48-row [[John Deere DB120]]. Such larger and newer planters comprise multiple [[modular design|modules]] called row units.&lt;ref name="fin" /&gt; The row units are spaced evenly along the planter&lt;ref name="fin" /&gt; at intervals that vary widely by crop and locale. The most common row spacing in the United States today is 30 inches.&lt;ref name="fin" /&gt;

[[File:Kinze 2200 planter.jpg|thumb|A [[Kinze Manufacturing|Kinze]] 2200 planter]]

Various machines meter out seeds for sowing in rows. The ones that handle larger seeds tend to be called planters, whereas the ones that handle smaller seeds tend to be called [[seed drill]]s, grain drills, and seeders (including precision seeders). They all share a set of similar [[concept]]s in the ways that they work, but there is established [[usage]] in which the machines for sowing some [[crop]]s including [[maize]] (corn), [[bean]]s, and [[pea]]s are mostly called planters, whereas those that sow [[cereal]]s are drills.

On smaller and older planters, a marker extends out to the side half the width of the planter and creates a line in the field where the tractor should be centered for the next pass. The marker is usually a single [[disc harrow]] disc on a rod on each side of the planter. On larger and more modern planters, GPS navigation and auto-steer systems for the tractor are often used, eliminating the need for the marker. Some precision farming equipment such as Case IH AFS uses GPS/RKS and computer-controlled planter to sow seeds to precise position accurate within 2&amp;nbsp;cm. In an irregularly shaped field, the precision farming equipment will automatically hold the seed release over area already sewn when the tractor has to run overlapping pattern to avoid obstacles such as trees.

Older planters commonly have a seed bin for each row and a fertilizer bin for two or more rows. In each seed bin plates are installed with a certain number of teeth and tooth spacing according to the type of seed to be sown and the rate at which the seeds are to be sown. The tooth size (actually the size of the space between the teeth) is just big enough to allow one seed in at a time but not big enough for two. Modern planters often have a large bin for seeds that are distributed to each row known as central commodity systems.

{{Anchor|Corn lister}}
A class of planters that dig down farther than others are called listers. They are not used much anymore, as their use belonged to a set of high-[[tillage|till]] methods that low-till and [[no-till farming|no-till]] methods have largely replaced. Corn listers were common on the [[Great Plains]] in the 1920s through 1950s.

== Drive systems ==
There are different types of planters available with the main difference being mechanically driven vs. hydraulic/electrical driven.  In a mechanical drive system the unit works by a small suspended tire being driven by another which is in contact with the ground (driven) tire.  As the operator lowers the planter the two tires make contact and the planter is engaged.  When the driven wheel begins to turn it then turns a series of gears that determine the population of the seed produced.  The gears can be changed by the operator in order to change the planting population.  A hydraulic driven system came about to correct the shortfalls of the ground driven system.  Hydraulic driven systems allow the operator to change population on the go, as well as allowing the computer controller to follow a prepared prescription for an individual field. The system also allowed for plant populations to be infinite in that mechanical gears systems are limited to set number of population settings and gears available from manufactures.  In 2014 [[John Deere]] introduced the [http://www.deere.com/en_US/products/equipment/planting_and_seeding_equipment/planters/row_units/exact_emerge_row_unit/exactemerge_row_unit.page? ExactEmerge row unit] which introduced high-speed planting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://farmindustrynews.com/planters/john-deere-launches-high-speed-planter|title=John Deere launches high-speed planter|website=farmindustrynews.com|access-date=2016-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Precision Planting followed suit and released the vDrive system. These system were unique, not that they were electrical, but that they allowed an operator to double their speed when planting.  Other manufacturers had already developed an electrical planter, but lacked these additional improvements.  Traditionally, an operator would plant at about 4.5-5.5&amp;nbsp;mph for optimal performance. However, with the advent of these systems electrical motors match the speed of the tractor and "dead-drop" the seed in the trench using either a belt or brush-belt which cause the forward momentum of the planter to be offset by the rearward momentum of the seed.  Older systems would instead drop the seed through a tube after the meter rather than place it in the seed trench directly.

[[File:Polyphenylenether.svg|thumb|right|]]
'''Poly(''p''-phenylene oxide)'''  or '''poly(''p''-phenylene ether)''' ('''PPE''') is a high-temperature [[thermoplastic]]. It is rarely used in its pure form due to difficulties in processing. It is mainly used as blend with polystyrene, high impact styrene-butadiene copolymer or polyamide.  PPO is a registered trademark of [[SABIC]] Innovative Plastics IP B.V. under which various polyphenylene ether resins are sold.

==History==
Polyphenylene ether was discovered in 1956 by [[Allan Hay]], and was commercialized by General Electric in 1960.

While it was one of the cheapest high-temperature resistant plastics, processing was difficult, while the impact and heat resistance gradually decreased with time. Mixing it with polystyrene in any ratio could compensate for the disadvantages. In the 1960s, modified PPE came into the market under the trademark [[Noryl]].&lt;ref&gt;D. Alberti "Modifizierte aromatische Polyether" in Kunststoffe 10/87, S. 1001&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties==
PPE is an amorphous high-performance plastic. The [[glass transition temperature]] is 215 °C, but it can be varied by mixing with [[polystyrene]]. Through modification and the incorporation of fillers such as glass fibers, the properties can be extensively modified.

==Applications==
[[File:Druckerpatrone.jpg|thumb|A [[Ink cartridge|printer cartridge]] made of PPE and polystyrene; it is an example of a product which requires good dimensional stability and accuracy to fit]]
PPE blends are used for structural parts, electronics, household and automotive items that depend on high heat resistance, dimensional stability and accuracy. They are also used in medicine for sterilizable instruments made of plastic.&lt;ref&gt;A. Hohmann, W. Hielscher: Lexikon der Zahntechnik: Das grundlegende Werk: 12,000 Begriffe aus Zahntechnik und Zahnheilkunde in einem Band. Verlag Neuer Merkur, 1998, {{ISBN|978-3-929360-28-8}} - they are used. [6] The PPE blends are characterized by hot water resistance with low water absorption, high impact strength, halogen-free fire protection and low density.&lt;/ref&gt;

This plastic is processed by injection molding or extrusion; depending on the type, the processing temperature is 260-300 °C. The surface can be printed, hot-stamped, painted or metallized. Welds are possible by means of heating element, friction or ultrasonic welding. It can be glued with halogenated solvents or various adhesives.

This plastic is also used to produce [[Membrane_gas_separation|air separation membranes]] for [http://www.parkern2.com/membrane generating] nitrogen. The PPO is spun into a hollow fiber membrane with a porous support layer and a very thin outer skin. The permeation of oxygen occurs from inside to out across the thin outer skin with an extremely high flux. Due to the manufacturing process, the fiber has excellent dimensional stability and strength. Unlike hollow fiber membranes made from polysulfone, the aging process of the fiber is relatively quick so that air separation performance remains stable throughout the life of the membrane. PPO makes the air separation performance suitable for low temperature (35-70F)(2-21C) applications where polysulfone membranes require heated air to increase permeation.

== Production from natural products ==
[[Natural phenol]]s can be [[enzyme|enzymatically]] polymerised. [[Laccase]] and [[peroxidase]] induce the polymerization of [[syringic acid]] to give a poly(1,4-phenylene oxide) bearing a [[carboxylic acid]] at one end and a [[phenol]]ic hydroxyl group at the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1021/bk-2000-0764.ch009 | chapter = Enzymatic Polymerization of Natural Phenol Derivatives and Enzymatic Synthesis of Polyesters from Vinyl Esters | title = Polymers from Renewable Resources | series = ACS Symposium Series | year = 2001 | last1 = Uyama | first1 = Hiroshi | last2 = Ikeda | first2 = Ryohei | last3 = Yaguchi | first3 = Shigeru | last4 = Kobayashi | first4 = Shiro | isbn = 0-8412-3646-1 | volume = 764 | page = 113 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the company is headquartered in Springfield, Missouri, and its main manufacturing plant is also located there, Positronic also has plants in [[Puerto Rico]], [[France]], [[China]], [[Singapore]], and [[India]]. Sales offices are located worldwide in major metropolitan areas.&lt;ref name="BBW 1"/&gt;

==History==
Positronic was founded by [[Jack Gentry (entrepreneur)|Jack Gentry]], a former [[United States Marine Corps|marines officer]] and a [[metallurgy|metallurgical]] [[engineer]]. Upon being discharged from the military, Gentry worked for [[Honeywell]] as a sales engineer.&lt;ref name="1983 Fire"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Fire Brings Positronic Industries Plant Back Home | author=Jim Ellison | pages=40–42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On a flight from [[Los Angeles]] to [[New York City]], Gentry met business manager and [[philanthropist]] [[Harry Gray (business)|Harry Gray]]. Four months later, Gray called Gentry and offered him a job with [[Litton Industries]]. During his stay at Litton Industries, Gentry established a plant of the company in [[Springfield, Missouri]]. However, feeling that he needed to explore other opportunities, he decided to create his own small company. By October 1966, he had founded Positronic Industries in Springfield, Missouri and initially, the company manufactured electronic components and connectors for the [[aerospace industry]].&lt;ref name="1983 Fire"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://smartdata.usbid.com/datasheets/dsid/229692.pdf | title=Catalog of Industrial and Military Application Subminiature-D Connectors | publisher=''USBid, Inc.'' | accessdate=May 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eight years later, Positronic moved to [[Rogersville, Missouri]], and in the following years, it progressed and managed three expansions. Tragically, the company’s growth was shaken in February 1983, when a fire destroyed its new headquarters and manufacturing plant. Fearing that the company's competitors would take advantage of the situation, Gentry and his employees worked tirelessly to rebuild Positronic. They moved the company back to Springfield, Missouri, where Positronic’s headquarters is still located today.&lt;ref name="1983 Fire"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Positronic starts afresh | year=1984 | agency=''[[The News Leader]]'' | author=Andy Backler}}&lt;/ref&gt; And as the company gradually recovered from its losses, Positronic decided to venture overseas. Just months after the fire, the company expanded its operations into [[Europe]]. This expansion continued into [[Puerto Rico]] in 1991, [[Singapore]] in 1995, and [[India]] in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://sbj.net/main.asp?Search=1&amp;ArticleID=93020&amp;SectionID=48&amp;SubSectionID=108&amp;S=1 | title=Exporters push to expand global reach | publisher=''Springfield Business Journal'' | date=December 12, 2012 | accessdate=May 16, 2013 | author=Ed Peaco}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 1993, Positronic began offering on-the-job training as a part of its [[apprenticeship|apprenticeship program]]. The program is geared toward [[high school]] students seeking jobs in [[high-tech manufacturing]], and it is offered to 17 and 18-year-olds as a school-to-work career opportunity. After graduation, successful apprentices are offered both employment with Positronic and funding for their college education for two years.&lt;ref name="Vote Smart"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://votesmart.org/public-statement/37196/in-recognition-of-jack-t-gentry#.UZJm_7VTBqU | title=In Recognition of Jack T.

In March 1995, employees of the main plant in Springfield were sent home after a [[chemical accident]] released a [[chlorine]] odor throughout the facility. A treatment plant operator caused the accident by improperly mixing chemicals in a waste treatment holding tank, creating pockets of chlorine gas. No one was harmed in the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Positronics clears plant after accident | date=March 4, 1995 | agency=''Springfield Business Journal''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the [[1997 Asian financial crisis|Asian financial crisis]] in the late 1990s, Positronic opened its 43,000&amp;nbsp;ft&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; assembly plant in [[Mount Vernon, Missouri]] in 1999. Although the company had established a presence in Mount Vernon years before on July 5, 1988, the opening of the new facility was a part of Positronic’s expansion into the Mount Vernon area.&lt;ref name="Record 1"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.lawrencecountyrecord.com/eedition/news/page_1b39da2e-26c4-5562-a9d0-d543cf5ec251.html | title=Positronic moving 81 jobs to town | date=November 9, 2011 | agency=''[[TownNews|Lawrence County Record]]'' | accessdate=May 11, 2013 | location= [[Mount Vernon, Missouri]] | pages=1, 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Positronic to build here, Springfield company to construct new plant in southwest part of Mt.

In 2002, less than a year after the [[September 11 attacks]], then-[[US Senator]]ial candidate [[Jim Talent]] of Missouri visited Springfield. Talent put forward the message that the US government had to increase its military spending, especially in regard to building a strong [[Missile defense|missile defense system]]. On his tour of Positronic's facility on North Eldon Avenue, Talent stated that increasing the government’s defense spending would produce more jobs for the American people. Positronic, a creator of domestic manufacturing jobs, produces electronic products that are being used in [[satellites]], [[missiles]], and other [[military equipment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Talent touts missile-defense system | date=July 30, 2002 | agency=''[[The News Leader]]'' | author=Beryl Chong | pages=3B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recent events===
In 2011, Positronic moved eighty-one jobs from the two Springfield manufacturing plants to its Mount Vernon manufacturing plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.news-leader.com/article/20111103/BUSINESS05/111030338/positronic-springfield-mount-vernon | title=Positronic transferring 81 jobs | publisher=''[[The News Leader]]'' | date=November 2, 2011 | accessdate=May 16, 2013 | author=Wes Johnson}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shift was made in order to double the workforce of the Mount Vernon plant and to consolidate the company's two electrical connector assembly lines.&lt;ref name="Record 1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://ozarksfirst.com/fulltext?nxd_id=547857 | title=Positronic Industries Moving 81 Jobs to Lawrence County | publisher=''[[KOLR|Ozarks First]]'' | date=November 2, 2011 | accessdate=May 14, 2013 | author=Brad Haller}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the increase in workforce, the company became one of the largest private employers in Mount Vernon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Our View: Positive Positronic | date=November 9, 2011 | agency=''[[TownNews|Lawrence County Record]]'' | location=[[Mount Vernon, Missouri]] | pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same year, the company provided two $15,000 gift funds to [[Ozarks Technical Community College]]. The funds supported the expansion of the Information Commons West on the Springfield campus and financed the Middle College program. A new classroom in the Information Commons West was named in honor of Positronic.&lt;ref&gt;BKD Foundation, Positronic Industries Help Fund Expansion". OTC Foundation - Annual Report 2011. ''[[Ozarks Technical Community College]]''. June 22, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ethical concerns==
NGOs, journalists, and food writers have raised concerns that the current laws on processing aids amount to a loophole that enables food producers to avoid transparency, and thereby to deceive consumers as to the contents of their food.&lt;ref name="guardian-2015-02-21" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sustainweb.org/realbread/bread_labelling/ |title=Bread Labelling Transparency |website=Sustainweb.org |date= |accessdate=2016-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sustainweb.org/realbread/processing_aids/ |title=Processing aids |doi=10.1016/j.jcs.2007.05.004 |website=Sustainweb.org |date= |accessdate=2016-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=s35WFE4hxmQC&amp;pg=PT14&amp;lpg=PT14&amp;dq=%22processing+aid%22+food+%22loophole%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=oRjXSM5XZC&amp;sig=B_ZkatVKRmK3-lfWq-OhLRKE440&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjxvaqam_7PAhUpKcAKHfuXBsEQ6AEIJDAC#v=onepage&amp;q=%22processing%20aid%22%20food%20%22loophole%22&amp;f=false |title=Bread Matters: The State of Modern Bread and a Definitive Guide to Baking ... |author=Andrew Whitley |page=14 |website=Books.google.co.uk |date=2011-08-17 |accessdate=2016-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Oliver Nieburg |url=http://www.bakeryandsnacks.com/Regulation-Safety/Federation-of-Bakers-and-Real-Bread-Campaign-at-odds-over-labelling-of-bread-processing-aids |title=Federation of Bakers and Real Bread Campaign at odds over labelling of bread processing aids |website=Bakeryandsnacks.com |date=2011-10-19 |accessdate=2016-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ydR5na_9fnYC&amp;pg=PP55&amp;lpg=PP55&amp;dq=%22processing+aid%22+%22loophole%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=E0cj1Q9azp&amp;sig=kdzZwZML3qiFa1U8oR0DhpMy6yM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjEhOSyrf7PAhXCfxoKHRBvB_0Q6AEILTAE#v=onepage&amp;q=%22processing%20aid%22%20%22loophole%22&amp;f=false |title=Sandwich: A Global History |author=Bee Wilson |page=55 |website=Books.google.co.uk |date=2010-10-15 |accessdate=2016-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jurisdictions==
===United Kingdom===
Under the [[United Kingdom food labelling regulations]], a "processing aid" is defined as follows:&lt;ref name="reading-def"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foodlaw.rdg.ac.uk/label/pro-def.htm|title='Processing Aid' Definition|last=Jukes|first=David|work=Foodlaw-Reading|publisher=University of Reading|accessdate=28 October 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070714204929/http://www.foodlaw.rdg.ac.uk/label/pro-def.htm |archive-date=2007-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States of America===
Under the law of the United States of America, a substance is legally a "processing aid" and can be excluded from ingredients labels if it meets any of the following criteria:&lt;ref name="fsn-2013-06-10"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foodsafetynews.com/2013/06/processing-aids-whats-not-on-the-label-and-why/|title=Processing Aids: What’s Not on the Label, and Why?|last=Andrews|first=James|date=10 June 2013|publisher=Food Safety News|accessdate=28 October 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150215024023/http://www.foodsafetynews.com/2013/06/processing-aids-whats-not-on-the-label-and-why/ |archive-date=2015-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote |text=1. It is added to the food but later removed. E.g. [[activated charcoal]], which removes certain impurities.

2. It is added to the food, but gets converted into a substance already present in the food. E.g. a [[pH]] adjuster that converts to [[salt]] and does not significantly add to the food's salt level.

3. It is added for a technical effect during processing but is not present at "significant" levels in the food. E.g. a preservative added to an ingredient, like anti-caking agent [[sodium silicoaluminate]] in the seasoning of some sausages.}}

'''''Quadrafile''''' was an [[LP record|LP]] recording released in 1976 intended as a demonstration of four different systems of [[quadraphonic sound]] reproduction on [[phonograph record]]s.{{r|Studio-Sound-1977-04}}{{r|Thorne-2001}}

== Background ==

The record was a [[double album]], with four sides containing identical material presented in each of the four LP based quadraphonic sound formats: [[Stereo Quadraphonic|SQ]], [[QS Regular Matrix|QS]], [[Compatible Discrete 4|CD-4]] and [[UD-4]].  These had evolved as the result of four competing companies ([[CBS]], [[Sansui Electric|Sansui]], [[JVC]] and [[Nippon Columbia]] respectively) pursuing their own quadraphonic systems independently.  This, and the incompatibility of the systems were factors in the slow uptake and eventual downfall of quadraphonic recordings.

The project was put together by Mike Thorne, then editor of ''Studio Sound'' magazine.{{r|Studio-Sound-1977-04}}  Able to persuade JVC and CBS via his own contacts, he soon found agreement from Sansui and Nippon Columbia and all four companies agreed to encode a side of the album each.  Assembling material was more difficult since compilations spanning record labels were not as commonplace as they eventually became.

== Tracks ==

The eventual album included a set of single and paired reference sounds, a surround-sound demonstration named "Electronic Footsy" (created in collaboration with engineer [[Tony Faulkner]]), a [[Stéphane Grappelli]] violin duet and two classical pieces by [[Gustav Mahler|Mahler]] and [[Béla Bartók|Bartok]], the latter being conducted by [[Pierre Boulez]].

The album also included [[Pink Floyd]]'s "[[Money (Pink Floyd song)|Money]]" and 2 excerpts from [[Mike Oldfield]]'s ''[[Tubular Bells]]''.{{r|Fitch-discography}}  To ensure consistency in the mastering process, Thorne took possession of the actual master tapes of the Pink Floyd album ''[[The Dark Side of the Moon|Dark Side of the Moon]]'', which caused him considerable paranoia to the extent that he hid it inside his piano, reasoning that a burglar was unlikely to steal such a hefty object.

[[File:Quadrafile_disc_labels.jpg|thumb|right|''Quadrafile'' disc labels]]

== Reception ==

The album was released just as quadraphonic sound was on the wane.  Only 5,000 numbered copies were pressed and are extremely rare collector's items.{{r|Fitch-discography}}  Some collectors have sought out this release as the only example of Mike Oldfield and Pink Floyd recordings being presented in the a particular quad format.

In 1976, ''[[Music Educators Journal]]'' described ''Quadrafile'' in an article on useful materials for music professionals.{{r|Music-Educators-Journal-1976-11|page=24}}

[[File:Qfp.svg|thumb|A typical QFP circuit diagram]]
Invented by [[Eiichi Goto]] at the [[University of Tokyo]], the '''Quantum Flux Parametron''' ('''QFP''') is an improvement over his earlier [[parametron]] based digital logic technology. Unlike its predecessor, QFP uses [[superconductivity|superconducting]] [[Josephson junction]]s on integrated circuits to improve speed and energy efficiency enormously. In some applications, the complexity of the [[cryogenic]] cooling system required is negligible compared to the potential speed gains. While his design makes use of [[Quantum mechanics|quantum]] principles, it is not a [[quantum computer]] technology, gaining speed only through higher [[Clock signal|clock]] speeds. Apart from the speed advantage over traditional [[CMOS]] [[integrated circuit]] design is that parametrons can be operated with zero energy loss (no local increase in [[entropy]]), making [[reversible computing]] possible. Low energy use and heat generation is critical in [[supercomputer]] design, where [[thermal load]] per unit volume has become one of the main limiting factors.

A related technology is the [[Rapid single flux quantum|Rapid Single Flux Quantum]] digital logic.

The '''Raspberry Pi Foundation''' is a [[charitable organization|charity]] founded in 2009 to promote the study of basic [[computer science]] in schools, and is responsible for developing a [[single-board computer]] called the [[Raspberry Pi]], the UK's best-selling [[personal computer|PC]] of all time.

==Foundation==
[[File:Raspberry Pi 3 B+ (39906369025).png|thumb|right|The foundation created the line of low-cost [[Raspberry Pi]] micro-computers, which have sold millions of units.]]
The Raspberry Pi Foundation is a charitable organization registered with the [[Charity Commission for England and Wales]].&lt;ref name="charitycommission"/&gt; The board of trustees was assembled by 2008&lt;ref name="makeuseof"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/raspberry-pi-creditcard-sized-arm-computer-25/ | title=Raspberry Pi – A Credit-Card Sized ARM Computer – Yours For Only $25 | work=[[MakeUseOf]] | date=24 February 2012 | accessdate=29 February 2012 | author=Brookes, Tim }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="techspot vilches 2012"&gt;{{cite news|last=Vilches|first=Jose|title=Interview with Raspberry's Founder Eben Upton|url=http://www.techspot.com/article/531-eben-upton-interview/|accessdate=19 June 2012|newspaper=[[TechSpot]]|date=22 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''Raspberry Pi Foundation'' was founded as a registered charity in May 2009 in [[Caldecote, South Cambridgeshire|Caldecote]], [[Cambridgeshire]], [[United Kingdom|UK]].&lt;ref name="charitycommission"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.charity-commission.gov.uk/Showcharity/RegisterOfCharities/CharityWithoutPartB.aspx?RegisteredCharityNumber=1129409&amp;SubsidiaryNumber=0 | title=1129409 - Raspberry Pi Foundation | publisher=[[Charity Commission for England and Wales]] | date=6 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, The Foundation moved its headquarters to [[Station Road, Cambridge]], Cambridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweekly.co.uk/news/property-and-construction/raspberry-pi-and-ja-kemp-move-iconic-station-road-hqs|website=Business Weekly|publisher=Business Weekly|accessdate=17 February 2017|title=Raspberry Pi and JA Kemp move to iconic Station Road HQs}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Foundation is supported by the [[University of Cambridge Computer Laboratory]] and [[Broadcom]].&lt;ref name="cl.cam.ac.uk mullins"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~rdm34/raspi/ | title=Robert Mullins: Raspberry Pi | publisher=[[University of Cambridge]] | year=2012 | accessdate=29 February 2012 | author=Mullins, Robert}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Its aim is to "promote the study of computer science and related topics, especially at school level, and to put the fun back into learning computing."&lt;ref name="raspberrypi"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.raspberrypi.org/ | title=Raspberry Pi Foundation | publisher=Raspberry Pi Foundation | accessdate=2 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Project co-founder [[Eben Upton]] is a former academic, currently employed by [[Broadcom]] as a [[system-on-chip]] architect and associate technical director.&lt;ref name="linuxuser 2012-03" /&gt; Components, albeit in small numbers, were able to be sourced from suppliers, due to the charitable status of the organization.&lt;ref name="techspot vilches 2012" /&gt;

===History===
When the decline in numbers and skills of students applying for Computer Science became a concern for a team that included [[Eben Upton]], Rob Mullins, Jack Lang and [[Alan Mycroft]] at the University of Cambridge’s Computer Laboratory in 2006, a need for a tiny and affordable computer came to their minds. Several versions of the early Raspberry Pi prototypes were designed but were very limited by the high cost and low power processors for mobile devices at that time.&lt;ref name="raspberry pi foundation"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.raspberrypi.org/about/ | title=About Us | publisher=Raspberry Pi Foundation | accessdate=24 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, the team started a collaboration with Pete Lomas, MD of Norcott Technologies and [[David Braben]], the co-author of the seminal BBC micro game [[Elite (video game)|Elite]], and formed the Raspberry Pi Foundation. Three years later, the Raspberry Pi Model B was born and it had sold over two million units within two years of mass production.&lt;ref name="raspberry pi foundation"/&gt;

The original founders of the organization includes
*[[Eben Upton]]
* [[Rob Mullins]]: a Senior Lecturer in the Computer Laboratory at the University of Cambridge
* Jack Lang: an affiliated Lecturer at the Computer Laboratory and the founder of Electronic Share Information Ltd
* [[Alan Mycroft]]: professor of Computing in the Computer Laboratory and co-founded the European Association for Programming Languages and Systems
* Pete Lomas: director of Engineering at Norcott Technologies
* [[David Braben]]: CEO of Frontier Developments and co-writer of  the seminal [[Elite (video game)|Elite]]

In early 2013 the organization split into two parts: Raspberry Pi Foundation which is responsible for the charitable and educational activities; and Raspberry Pi (Trading) Ltd responsible for the engineering and trading activities.&lt;ref name="Welcome Lance"/&gt; Raspberry Pi (Trading) Ltd is a wholly owned subsidiary of Raspberry Pi Foundation, with the money earned from sales of [[Raspberry Pi]] products being used to fund the charitable work of the Foundation. Eben Upton was initially CEO of both divisions, but in September 2013 Lance Howarth became CEO of the Raspberry Pi Foundation,&lt;ref name="Welcome Lance"&gt;{{cite web|title = Welcome Lance!|publisher = Raspberry Pi Foundation|url = http://www.raspberrypi.org/welcome-lance/|accessdate=24 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; with Eben Upton remaining as CEO of Raspberry Pi (Trading) Ltd. Philip Colligan took over from Lance Howarth as CEO of Raspberry Pi Foundation in July 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Welcome Philip! | publisher=Raspberry Pi Foundation | url=https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/welcome-philip/ | accessdate=7 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.computerweekly.com/photostory/450427418/The-50-Most-Influential-Women-in-UK-Tech-2017/3/3-Carrie-Anne-Philbin-director-of-education-Raspberry-Pi-Foundation|title=3.

===Trustees and Patron===
As of 31 December 2015, the foundation has 7&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Raspberry Pi Foundation Trustees Report | date=31 December 2015 | url=https://www.raspberrypi.org/files/about/RaspberryPiFoundationReport2015.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Trustees:
* Jack Lang (trustee and company secretary)
* [[David Braben]]
* [[David Cleevely]] (Chairman)
* Sherry Coutu (angel investor, Canadian but now Cambridge-based)
* Louis Glass (corporate lawyer; partner at [[Olswang]])
* Pete Lomas
* [[Chris Mairs]] (chief scientist at [[Metaswitch Networks]])

The Board of Trustees is elected by and supported by the Members of the Foundation, with Members serving in a voluntary role and coming from a range of backgrounds.&lt;ref name="governance"/&gt;

[[Prince Andrew, Duke of York]] serves as Patron of the Raspberry Pi Foundation.&lt;ref name="governance"/&gt;

===Early expectations===
The Foundation expected that children would program using [[Scratch (programming language)|Scratch]] and that the input/output functionality would be used to control external devices. Additionally, the low power requirement facilitates battery-powered usage in [[robots]], while the video capabilities have led to interest in use as a [[home theater PC|home media centre]].&lt;ref name="element14 robert mullins 2012"&gt;{{cite video | url=http://www.element14.com/community/docs/DOC-43237/l/robert-mullins-co-founder-raspberry-pi-foundation-unboxes-raspberry-pi | title=Robert Mullins, Co-Founder, Raspberry Pi Foundation, Unboxes Raspberry Pi | publisher=[[Premier Farnell]] | work=Element 14 community | date=February 28, 2012 | accessdate=March 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education fund===
In April 2014, the foundation announced a £1 million education fund to support projects that enhance the understanding of computing and to promote the use of technology in other subjects, particularly [[STEM fields|STEM]] and creative arts for children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.raspberrypi.org/announcing-our-million-pound-education-charity-fund/ | title=ANNOUNCING OUR MILLION-POUND EDUCATION CHARITY FUND | publisher=Raspberry Pi Foundation | accessdate=26 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
They offer to provide up to 50% of the total projected costs to successful applicants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.raspberrypi.org/education-fund/| title=EDUCATION FUND | publisher=Raspberry Pi Foundation | accessdate=26 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carrie Anne Philbin]] is the Director of Education.

===Logo===
In October 2011, the logo was selected from a number submitted from open competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Logo competition|url=https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/logo-competition/|publisher=Raspberry Pi Foundation|accessdate=27 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A shortlist of six was drawn up, with the final judging taking several days. The chosen design was created by Paul Beech&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Logo competition - we have a winner!|url=https://www.raspberrypi.org/blog/logo-competition-we-have-a-winner/|publisher=Raspberry Pi Foundation|accessdate=27 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and based on a [[Buckminsterfullerene|buckyball]].&lt;ref name="geek.com very clever logo"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.geek.com/articles/chips/raspberry-pi-selects-a-very-clever-logo-20111010/ | title=Raspberry Pi selects a very clever logo | publisher=geek.com | accessdate=11 October 2011 | author=Humphries, Matthew}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Magazines==
&lt;!-- Might need some information here. Additional information should be based on coverage in independent reliable sources. --&gt;
The Raspberry Pi Foundation publishes three magazines. ''The MagPi'' is the official magazine of the Raspberry Pi.&lt;ref &gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.raspberrypi.org/magpi/about-us/ | title=About Us - The MagPi Magazine | publisher=raspberrypi.org/magpi/ | accessdate=3 July 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Hello World'' is a "computing and digital making" magazine and was first published in January 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://helloworld.raspberrypi.org/ | title=Hello World | accessdate=3 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wireframe, launched in November 2018, is a magazine about videogames and videogame development.

==Raspberry Pi Zero==
In 2015 the foundation unveiled the Raspberry Pi Zero. This version of the microcomputer had a significantly reduced form factor and a lower price, launching at £4/$5. The new model features a 1Ghz, Single-core CPU; 512MB RAM, Mini HDMI and USB ports, Micro USB power, HAT-compatible 40-pin header as well as Composite video and reset headers [https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/pi-zero/]. As a fully functioning Linux system the Raspberry Pi Zero's 1&amp;nbsp;GHz processor is comparable to the middle of the road for the Intel Pentium 3 architecture (450&amp;nbsp;MHz to 1.4&amp;nbsp;GHz), a standard in 2000. The reduced price and smaller form factor encourages use in smaller and embedded projects.

'''S11 House''', located in [[Petaling Jaya]], is [[Malaysia]]’s first [[green building|Green Building]] Index Platinum rated house that won the Tropical Building Category of the Asean Energy Awards in 2013, designed by [[Ar. Dr. Tan Loke Mun]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=ArchiCentre's S11 House wins Asean Energy Award|journal=The Edge Malaysia|date=9 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This single residential structure was conceptualized along the lines of a large tree canopy and is equipped with 5 KW peak [[photo-voltaic]] installation on the roof; rainwater is also collected on the canopy roof drains and is stored in harvesting tanks. Water features and multiple pools are located at the two extreme north-south ends to provide evaporative cooling for the house. The house proves that even in the hot and humid [[tropical climate]] of [[South East Asia]], it is possible to lessen a building's reliance on [[air-conditioning]] and also minimize its use of other natural resources, most notably water and electricity.

A [[composting]] yard treats all the household organic and garden wastes and provides high grade compost [[fertilizer]] for the vegetable and fruit gardens. It has an overall roof [[U value]] of 0.14. The glazing roof comprises 9.38mm thick [[low-E]] safety laminated glass which can be opened up to 90%. The overall [[building envelope]] [[OTTV]] is 29.63.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=S11House|url=http://www.s11house.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

S11 House is a testament to the opportunities available to build green for the architect and owner of this house, Dr. Tan. The successful structure has since been replicated in the S14 House&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=S14House|url=http://www.archicentre.com.my/work.php?id=43&amp;projectid=39/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other commissions of private homes. The hope is that the constant experiments done on these private homes eventually will find their way into the larger consumer and mass market housing industry. This is Tan’s process of taking a theory and testing it on a lab project (usually a house) and then finding a larger mass market application for the idea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Learning How To Fly|journal=Putra Architectural Exhibition PAX 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The house is physical proof that upper-end residential houses can work sustainably with the environment regarding their construction and on-going maintenance.

The snow knife was originally made from available materials such as bone or horn but the Inuit adapted to using metal after the arrival of Europeans.&lt;ref name=aaas/&gt;

==Historical descriptions==
The [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] noted in 1883:

{{quote|The only instrument used in the construction of the igloo is the snow-knife. Where the Inuits{{sic}} have intercourse with white men, they barter for cheese-knives or long-bladed butcher-knives, remove the double-handle from the [[Tang (tools)|tang]], and put on a single one about three times as long, which can be readily grasped by both hands. The old knives were made of reindeer-horn or from the shin-bone of the [[reindeer]].

Among the [[Eskimo|Esquimaux]] in and around [[King William Island|King William's Land]] I found snow-knives made of copper stripped from Sir [[John Franklin]]'s ships, the imprints of the queen's [[broad arrow]] still showing on many, the blades double-edged or dagger-shape, and the handles of [[Muskox|musk-ox]] and reindeer horn rudely attached by sinew lashings.

The snow-knife of iron, while more convenient in many ways, is far more liable to break in the intense cold of the winter weather, such accidents with them being very common. I have seen igloos built when the thermometer registered −70°F. At such temperatures the snow becomes almost stone-like in its compactness. The snow-knife is often used as a substitute for the snow-tester whenever that instrument is broken or left behind, for the Esquimaux are a very careless and absentminded people.&lt;ref name=aaas&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Mgj3y5qnHaQC&amp;pg=PA259&amp;lpg=PA259&amp;dq=%22snow+knife%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=FRBLXYN8HJ&amp;sig=9OqWgQ2wQjKxwLGMWskww_JeGH0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=6TlOUPvPC6iw0QHD0YDwBQ&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22snow%20knife%22&amp;f=false Science, Volume 2 By American Association for the Advancement of Science, HighWire Press, JSTOR (Organization)]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A [[space elevator]] is a theoretical system using a super-strong ribbon going from the surface of the Earth to a point beyond [[Geosynchronous orbit]]. The [[center of gravity]] of the ribbon would be exactly in geosynchronous orbit, so that the ribbon would always stay above the anchor point. Vehicles would climb the ribbon powered by a beam of energy projected from the surface of the Earth. Building a space elevator requires materials and techniques that do not currently exist. A variety of Space Elevator competitions have been held in order to stimulate the development of such materials and techniques.

Space elevators were first conceived in 1895, but until the discovery of [[carbon nanotubes]], no technology was envisioned that could make them possible. Building an actual elevator is still out of reach, but the directions for research are clear. This makes the area ripe for incentive prizes like the [[X Prize]], and prizes and competitions have been set up since 2005&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Space Elevator Competitions|url=http://www.isec.org/index.php/activities/space-elevator-competitions|publisher=International Space Elevator Competition|accessdate=2013-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; to encourage the development of relevant technologies. There are two main areas of research remaining, and these are where the competitions focus: building cables ("a Tether challenge"), and climbing and descending cables ("a Power Beam challenge").

In a [[Power Beam|Power Beam Challenge]], each team designs and builds a climber (a machine capable of traveling up and down a tether ribbon). In a Tether challenge, each team attempts to build the longest and strongest cable. In the Power Beam challenge climber carry a payload. Power is beamed from a transmitter to a receiver on the climber. With each competition, the tethers reach higher altitudes, and the climbers are expected to climb further. Each competition can have minimum lengths and maximum weight per meter for cables, and minimum speed and distance goals for climbers.

==Space elevator challenge results==

Like many competitions modeled after the X prize, competitors have to meet a minimum baseline, and then prizes are awarded to the best entry that exceed that target. In 2005, there was only a climbing challenge, and none of the entrants met the minimum speed requirement of 1&amp;nbsp;m/s. Starting in 2006, [[Elevator:2010]], sponsored by spaceward.org&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Space Elevator Challenge|url=http://www.spaceward.org/games|publisher=The Spaceward Foundation|accessdate=2013-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and NASA conducted a series of competitions. For 2006, the prize was increased, and the speed requirement dropped slightly to 50 meters in under a minute. 13 teams entered, and one was able to climb the 50 meters in 58 seconds. In 2009 at Edwards Air Force Base, the challenge was climbing a 900&amp;nbsp;m tether, and one entry managed the feat several times, with a top speed of 3.5&amp;nbsp;m/s. NASA didn't renew their sponsorship after 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NASA, the Space Elevator Challenges and the Kansas City Space Pirates|url=http://www.spaceelevatorblog.com/?p=1544|publisher=SpaceElevatorBlog|accessdate=2013-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Strong Tether Challenge|url=http://challenge.gov/NASA/27-strong-tether-challenge|accessdate=2013-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; pending "further advancements in material science".

The [[International Space Elevator Consortium]] was formed in 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Leading Players in the Space Elevator Movement Join Together to Form New International Consortium|url=http://www.isec.org/images/PressReleases/ISECAnnouncementNR-final.pdf|accessdate=2013-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has held annual conferences. They announced a $10,000 Strong Tether Challenge competition for 2013. The Challenge was canceled for lack of competitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isec.org/sec/|title=ISEC Space Elevator Conference|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2011, 2012, and 2013 ISEC conferences also featured [[FIRST]]-style High School robotics competitions for climbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2013 Space Elevator Conference|url=http://www.isec.org/sec/|publisher=International Space Elevator Consortium|accessdate=2013-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2013 Space Elevator Conference – Day 2|url=http://www.spaceelevatorblog.com/?p=1579|publisher=Space Elevator Blog|accessdate=2013-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and occasional competitions.

The Japan Space Elevator Association held a climbing competition in August 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=On the implementation results of the SPEC2013|url=http://www.jsea.jp/technology/challenge/000405.html|publisher=Japan Space Elevator Association|accessdate=2013-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hot air balloons]] were used to hoist a tether, and Team Okusawa's entry&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.goo.ne.jp/orbitalelevator/c/93257aab9f4951e3c84d7c6aaa989aa7|title=Orbital elevator group|accessdate=2013-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; succeeded in climbing to 1100 meters,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Team Okusawa 1,100 m elevation climber video |url=http://www.jsea.jp/technology/challenge/000412.html|publisher=Japan Space Elevator Association|accessdate=2013-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a team from Nihon University reached 1200 meters.

The Japan Space Elevator Association held a climbing competition in August 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=On the implementation results of the SPEC2014|url=http://www.jsea.jp/technology/challenge/000439.html|publisher=Japan Space Elevator Association|accessdate=2014-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hot air balloons]] were used to hoist both rope (11&amp;nbsp;mm) and ribbon (35&amp;nbsp;mm x 2&amp;nbsp;mm) to 200&amp;nbsp;m and 1200&amp;nbsp;m. Team Okusawa climbed to 1200&amp;nbsp;m and descended twice. Kanagawa University carried a 100&amp;nbsp;kg payload to 123&amp;nbsp;m on the 200&amp;nbsp;m ribbon. Kanagawa University's three teams climbed respectively to 1200&amp;nbsp;m (rope), 1150&amp;nbsp;m (rope) and 1100&amp;nbsp;m (ribbon). Munich University of Technology reached 1000&amp;nbsp;m (rope).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6335">'''Supersonic gas separation''' is a technology to remove one or several gaseous components out of a mixed gas (typically raw [[natural gas]]). The process condensates the target components by cooling the gas through expansion in a [[Laval nozzle]] and then separates the condensates from the dried gas through an integrated [[Cyclonic separation|cyclonic gas/liquid separator]].   The separator is only using a part of the field pressure as energy and has technical and commercial advantages when compared to commonly used conventional technologies.

== Background ==
{{main|Natural gas processing}}
Raw natural gas out of a well is usually not a salable product but a mix of various hydro-carbonic gases with other gases, liquids and solid contaminants. This raw gas needs gas conditioning to get it ready for pipeline transport and [[Natural gas processing|processing]] in a gas processing plant to separate it into its components.&lt;br /&gt;Some of the common processing steps are CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; removal, [[dehydration]], LPG extraction, dew-pointing. Technologies used to achieve these steps are [[adsorption]], [[Absorption (chemistry)|absorption]], membranes and low temperature systems achieved by refrigeration or expansion through a [[Joule–Thomson effect|Joule Thomson Valve]] or a [[Turboexpander]].
If such expansion is done through the Supersonic Gas Separator instead, frequently mechanical, economical and operational advantages can be gained as detailed below.

==The supersonic gas separator==
A supersonic gas separator consists of several consecutive sections in tubular form, usually designed as flanged pieces of pipe.

The feed gas (consisting of at least two components) first enters a section with an arrangement of static blades or wings, which induce a fast swirl in the gas.
Thereafter the gas stream flows through a [[De Laval nozzle|Laval nozzle]], where it accelerates to supersonic speeds and undergoes a deep pressure drop to about 30% of feed pressure. This is a near [[isentropic]] process and the corresponding temperature reduction leads to [[condensation]] of target components of the mixed feed gas, which form a fine mist. The droplets agglomerate to larger drops, and the swirl of the gas causes [[cyclonic separation]].&lt;ref name=Malyshkina2008&gt;Malyshkina, M. M., ''The Structure of Gasdynamic Flow in a Supersonic Separator of Natural Gas'', High Temperature (2008, Vol 46, No 1, ISSN 0018-151X).&lt;/ref&gt;
The dry gas continues forward, while the liquid phase together with some slip gas (about 30% of the total stream) is separated by a concentric divider and exits the device as a separate stream. The final section are [[diffuser (thermodynamics)|diffusers]] for both streams, where the gas is slowed down and about 80% of the feed pressure (depending on application) is recovered. This section might also include another set of static devices to undo the swirling motion.&lt;ref name=Feygin&gt;[http://www.igu.org/html/wgc2006/pdf/paper/add11530.pdf Feygin, Vladimir et al, ''Supersonic Gas Technologies''].&lt;/ref&gt;

==The installation scheme==
The supersonic separator requires a certain process scheme, which includes further auxiliary equipment and often forms a skid or processing block.
The typical basic scheme for supersonic separation is an arrangement where the feed gas is pre-cooled in a heat exchanger by the dry stream of the separator unit.

The liquid phase from the supersonic separator goes into a [[vapor-liquid separator|2-phase or 3-phase separator]], where the slip gas is separated from water and/or from liquid hydrocarbons. The gaseous phase of this secondary separator joins the dry gas of the supersonic separator, the liquids go for transport, storage or further processing and the water for treatment and disposal.

Depending on the task at hand other schemes are possible and for certain cases have advantages. Those variations are very much part of the supersonic gas separation process to achieve thermodynamic efficiency and several of them are protected by patents.&lt;ref name=CanPatent&gt;Canadian Patent Application 2520800, (2006/03/24).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages and application==
The supersonic gas separator recovers part of the pressure drop needed for cooling and as such has a higher efficiency than a JT valve in all conditions of operation.

The supersonic gas separator can in many cases have a 10–20% higher efficiency than a turboexpander.

The supersonic separator has a smaller footprint and a lower weight than a turboexpander or contactor columns. This is of particular advantage for platforms, FPSOs and crowded installations.
It needs a lower capital investment and lower operating expenditure as it is completely static. Very little maintenance is required and no (or greatly reduced) amounts of chemicals.

The fact that no operational or maintenance personnel is required might enable unmanning of usually manned platforms with the associated large savings in capital and operational expenditure.

The fields of application commercially developed until today on an industrial scale are:
* dehydration
* dewpointing (water and/or hydrocarbons)
* [[Liquefied Petroleum Gas|LPG]] extraction

Applications in the development stage for near term commercialization are:
* [[Acid Gas|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] and [[Hydrogen sulfide|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S]] bulk removal

==Commercial realization==
There are several patents on supersonic gas separation, relating to features of the device as well as methods.
The technology has been researched and proven in laboratory installations since about 1998, special [[Aspen Technology|HYSYS]] modules have been developed as well as 3D gas computer modeling. The supersonic gas separation technology has meanwhile moved successfully into industrial applications (e.g. in Nigeria, Malaysia and Russia) for dehydration as well as for LPG extraction.
Consultancy, engineering and equipment for supersonic gas separation are being offered by ENGO Engineering Ltd. under the brand "3S".&lt;ref name="ENGO Engineering Ltd."&gt;[http://www.engo3s.com ENGO Engineering Ltd. Web site].&lt;/ref&gt; They are also provided by Twister BV, a Dutch firm affiliated with Royal Dutch Shell, under the brand "Twister Supersonic Separator".&lt;ref name="TwisterBV Web site"&gt;http://www.TwisterBV.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3951">A '''typewriter mystery game''' was a specific type of [[typewriter art]] popular in the mid-20th century. 

[[File:A modern typewriter mystery game.jpg|thumb|A photo of a typewriter mystery game, its result, and the typewriter it was written on.]]

A [[typewriter]] owner would be presented with a set of instructions: press a key this many times, press another key, move on to the next line. Upon finishing the typing, a picture would emerge on the page. First lines of a simple typewriter mystery could look like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
[1] 36 spaces, 4 X
[2] 31 spaces, 20 X
[3] 27 spaces, 32 X
[4] 23 spaces, 43 X, 2 spaces, 5 X
&lt;/pre&gt;

Typewriter mystery games were published in magazines (such as [[Woman's Realm]]&lt;ref name="higham"&gt;{{cite article|title=Typewriter Art|date=August 29, 2014|author=Nick Higham|accessdate=April 14, 2018|url=https://nickhigham.wordpress.com/2014/08/29/typewriter-art/}}&lt;/ref&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Journal of Business Education&lt;/em&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|title=Typewriter Mystery Game|date=1963|accessdate=April 14, 2018|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08832323.1963.10116707?journalCode=vjeb19}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and collected in separate books.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|title=Bob Neill’s Typewriter Art|date=January 31, 2013|accessdate=April 14, 2018|url=https://barbaraneill.wordpress.com/2013/01/31/142/|author=Barbara Neill}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|title=D.I.Y.

The end result of a typewriter mystery game would be a picture similar to the later [[ASCII art]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article|title=The Lost Ancestors of ASCII Art|date=January 30, 2014|author=Alexis Madrigal|accessdate=April 14, 2018|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2014/01/the-lost-ancestors-of-ascii-art/283445/}}&lt;/ref&gt; except it would often use [[overtyping]] – making several passes over the same line,&lt;ref name="higham"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; unavailable or difficult on computer screens. The photo would often be a portrait of a person&lt;ref name="higham"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; or an animal.

The '''Ultraperformance Nanophotonic Intrachip Communications''' (UNIC) program is a project of [[DARPA]]. It is dedicated to funding projects by chip makers to create [[nanophotonics|nanophotonic]] [[microprocessor]]s.

On March 3, 2008, [[Sun Microsystems]] announced that it had received a US$44.29M grant from UNIC for a "five and a half-year research project focused on microchip interconnectivity via on-chip optical networks enabled by Silicon photonics and [[proximity communication]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sun.com/aboutsun/pr/2008-03/sunflash.20080324.1.xml Sun Microsystems Awarded $44 Million Department of Defense Contract to Develop Microchip Interconnect System]&lt;/ref&gt;"; this project also involves collaboration with [[Luxtera]], [[Kotura]], [[Stanford University]] and the [[University of California, San Diego]].

A '''plate''' or '''wall plate''' is a horizontal, structural, load-bearing member in wooden building framing.

==Timber framing==
A '''plate''' in [[timber framing]] is "A piece of Timber upon which some considerable weight is framed...Hence Ground-Plate...Window-plate [obsolete]..." etc.&lt;ref&gt;Moxon, Joseph. ''Mechanick exercises, or, The doctrine of handy-works''. The 2nd ed. London: Printed and sold by J. Moxon, 1693, 1701. 163. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Also called a '''wall plate''',&lt;ref&gt;Oxford English Dictionary Second Edition on CD-ROM (v. 4.0) © Oxford University Press 2009&lt;/ref&gt; '''raising plate''',&lt;ref&gt;Sturgis, Russell. ''Sturgis' illustrated dictionary of architecture and building: an unabridged reprint of the 1901-2 edition''. 1901. Reprint. Mineola, N.Y.: Dover, 1989. 159. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; or '''top plate''',&lt;ref&gt;Sherwood, Gerald E., and Robert C. Stroh. ''Wood-frame house construction''. Washington, D.C.: U.S. Dept. of Agriculture, Forest Service :, 1989. 54. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; An exception to the use of the term plate for a large, load-bearing timber in a wall is the [[bressummer]], a timber supporting a wall over a wall opening (see also: [[Lintel (architecture)|lintel]]). These are common in Australia.

The terms '''sole plate''' or '''[[sill plate]]''' are used for the members at the bottom of a wall at the foundation but are most often just called a ''sole'' or ''sill'' without the word ''plate''. Other load bearing timbers use the term plate but are not in the wall such as ''crown plate'', a [[purlin]]-like beam carried by [[crown post]]s in roof framing, and a ''purlin plate'' which supports common rafters.

==Platform framing==
In platform framing there are three types of wall plates and are located at the top and bottom of a wall section, and the two hold the wall studs parallel and spaced at the correct interval. Each type continues in a piecewise fashion around the whole perimeter of the structure.

* '''[[Sill plate]]s''' &amp;mdash; a lower wall plate which is bolted or strapped securely to the top of a foundation wall or concrete slab. These hold the house down against heavy winds. Normally, "J-bolts" are placed in the curing concrete after the mason levels the foundation and finishes dressing the concrete or [[anchor bolt]]s are drilled into the concrete foundation. Newer systems of galvanized strapping with a J-bolt like anchor placed in the concrete allows the builder to avoid the mating step of drilling the sill plates for the bolts. 
* '''Lower wall plates''', base plate, floor plate, or bottom plate&lt;ref&gt;Sherwood, Gerald E., and Robert C. Stroh. ''Wood-frame house construction''. Washington, D.C.: U.S. Dept. of Agriculture, Forest Service :, 1989. 54. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;mdash; a second lower wall plate to which the wall studs are through nailed and which is the bottom of the wall section when assembled as a rectangular assembly. On an upper story, the lower wall plate is nailed to the [[platform (construction)|platform]] of the supporting floor. The supporting platform is being supported by the wall studs of the even lower walls below.
* '''Upper wall plate''', '''''top plate''''' or ceiling plate &amp;mdash; upper wall plate which is fastened along the top of the wall studs, before the wall is lifted into position and on which the platform of the next story or the ceiling and roof assembly rest and are attached.  A second layer of dimensional lumber is always fastened to the top plates of the erected walls so that no joints overlap, providing greatly increased stability.  In North America this is known as a "double top plate" and the process of installing the second top plate is known as "top plating."
