'''G-AOVD''' was a [[Bristol Britannia]] 312 operated by [[BOAC]] which crashed near [[Christchurch, Dorset]] in the [[south of England]] on Christmas Eve 1958, killing two of the five crew and all seven passengers.&lt;ref&gt;{{ASN accident|id=19581224-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Weather conditions ==
On 24 December 1958 much of the south of England was covered in thick fog making travel by any means hazardous. Many aircraft had to be diverted as visibility was below the minimum permissible distance at most of the airports on the south coast. To a [[aircraft pilot|pilot]] who was less than aware of the conditions on the ground and the altitude at which they were flying, this fog would have an appearance very similar to normal [[cloud cover]]. For the pilots of G-AOVD this may have added to the illusion that they were at a much higher altitude and that they were reading the instruments correctly.

== Accident sequence ==
The aircraft departed from [[London Heathrow Airport]] at 10:10&amp;nbsp;am on a [[test flight]] to renew its [[Airworthiness certificate|certificate of airworthiness]] with 12 persons aboard including five crew. After completing the test, at approximately 11:55&amp;nbsp;am, the crew requested clearance to descend from 12,000 feet to 3,000 feet for approach to [[Bournemouth Airport|Hurn Airport]], possibly as an alternate destination due to poor weather at Heathrow. Approximately 3 minutes later, at 11:58&amp;nbsp;am, Hurn Airport lost contact with the aircraft as it struck the ground, crossing a road into a ploughed field, bringing down telephone lines and trees and alerting residents in the nearby villages. Upon realising they had lost contact with the aircraft, the controller at Hurn contacted the emergency services giving the last known position before contact was lost. Likewise the residents of [[Winkton]], [[Sopley]], and people living near [[Bransgore]] contacted emergency services saying they believed that they had heard the sound of a low flying aircraft and the sound of a crash.

== Emergency response and rescue of survivors ==
Around midday, the members of the volunteer [[fire service]] in Burley and Christchurch were alerted by an [[air raid siren]] calling them to the station to respond to the report of the crash. The initial report from Hurn Airport stated that they were unaware of the type of aircraft involved or how many passengers were being carried, and that they believed the aircraft was to the north of the airport when it crashed. However, on receiving updated information on the reports from Winkton and Sopley the fire crews decided to start the search for the aircraft in that area.

The fire service searching in Winkton discovered the location of the wreckage after travelling a short distance along the Burley Road and finding telephone poles and cables which had been broken and dragged into a field off the road. A foot search was mounted and eventually the crew spotted some broken trees along with aircraft debris and a fire. The crew chief sent a message to fire control to confirm the location of the crash and set up a rendezvous at a local [[public house]] to give emergency services a positive location. Another [[Fire apparatus|appliance]] which had been sent to Sopley to search there could not be contacted as it was not fitted with a radio; fortunately, however, its crew encountered other appliances heading  towards the incident, and were then informed of the location.

Another hindrance to the emergency effort was the lack of a [[four-wheel drive]] appliance which meant that the firemen had to attempt to drive an eight-ton vehicle over a ploughed field, which delayed the rescue. While this was going on, the crew chief and some of the crew from the first appliance on the scene continued to search on foot and eventually found the remains of the cockpit with the injured co-pilot trapped inside. They began to cut him free and as further emergency services arrived on the scene, a coordinated search and rescue effort was mounted over the site, fanning out and finding a further two survivors. The fire station was eventually able to confirm what aircraft had been involved and the number of people on board at the time. Having received this information the emergency services were able to account for all the people involved and to continue putting out the fires.

== Investigation ==
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2013}}
The crash was attributed to a failure on the part of the [[Pilot in command|captain]] and [[First officer (aeronautics)|first officer]] to correctly establish the altitude of the aircraft before and during the descent. The Britannia aircraft was fitted with a three-handed [[altimeter]] which required a higher degree of concentration to read correctly than was desirable. The crew misread the instrument believing that they were at 11,500 feet when they began descending, when in fact they were at only 1,500 feet. As a result, they flew the aircraft into the ground which was obscured by [[fog]] at the time. The type of flight in which the aircraft was engaged was also thought to be a contributing factor.

It was concluded that this crash was a [[controlled flight into terrain]] (CFIT) and that there were no defects with the aircraft or its systems which contributed to the crash. For this the failure to read the instruments correctly rests with the captain. This was not the first crash involving a crew misreading this type of altimeter in this long distance, high altitude aircraft. As a direct result of this and other similar incidents, altimeters would now be required to display a cross-hatch or chequered flag when indicating an altitude below 1500 feet. Furthermore, all fire appliances in Christchurch would now be fitted with radios for improved communication, and when four-wheel drive appliances became available, Christchurch was one of the first rural stations to be allocated one.

==Aftermath==
As a result of the accident the Ministry of Transport issued a directive to replace all three-pointer altimeters in British registered aircraft which operated at over 20,000 feet before September 1959. This followed an investigation of the problems of interpretation of the display. An interim flight safety warning was also issued pending altimeter replacement which described the risk of misreading these altimeters as "most likely when the routine monitoring of the instrument panel has been interrupted. If this happened during climb or descent the height when the instruments are rescanned may be very different from the anticipated."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[Flight International|Flight]]|date=6 March 1959|page=333|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1959/1959%20-%200670.htm|title=Altimeter Accident and Altimeter Policy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Airborne Launch Control System''' ('''ALCS''') provides a survivable launch capability for the United States Air Force's [[LGM-30 Minuteman|LGM-30G Minuteman III]] intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) force. The ALCS is operated by airborne missileers from [[Air Force Global Strike Command]]'s (AFGSC) [[625th Strategic Operations Squadron]] (STOS) and [[United States Strategic Command]] (USSTRATCOM). The weapon system is located onboard the United States Navy's [[E-6B Mercury]], which serves as USSTRATCOM's "[[Operation Looking Glass|Looking Glass]]" Airborne Command Post (ABNCP). The ALCS crew is integrated into the ABNCP battle staff and is on alert around-the-clock.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stratcom.mil/Media/Factsheets/Factsheet-View/Article/960928/e-6b-airborne-command-post-abncp/ USSTRATCOM ABNCP Fact Sheet]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inception==
[[File:Mobile Minuteman train.png|thumb|upright|Train-mobile Minuteman ICBM testing underway.]]
In 1962, when the Minuteman ICBM was  first placed on alert, the Soviet Union did not have the number of weapons, accuracy, nor significant nuclear yield to completely destroy the Minuteman ICBM force during an attack. However, [[Strategic Air Command]] (SAC) planners knew it was only a matter of time before the Soviets could have such capability. Early on, the Air Force experimented with using trains to make the Minuteman ICBMs mobile, and therefore more survivable. However, the Air Force decided to scrap the mobile Minuteman ICBM concept and emplace Minuteman in 1000 missile silos along with their 100 associated LCCs. Each facility was spread out several miles apart from each other so that the Soviets could not destroy multiple sites with just one nuclear warhead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://afmissileers.com/Mar17.pdf |title=ALCS Article, page 13 |access-date=2017-04-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170702014829/http://afmissileers.com/Mar17.pdf |archive-date=2017-07-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in the mid-1960s, the Soviets began to gain parity with the US and now had the potential capability to target and successfully attack the Minuteman force with an increased number of ICBMs that had greater yields and accuracy than were previously available. Studying the problem even more, SAC realized that in order to prevent the US from launching all 1000 Minuteman ICBMs, the Soviets did not have to target all 1000 Minuteman missile silos. The Soviets only needed to launch a disarming decapitation strike against the 100 Minuteman LCCs - the [[Missile launch control center|command and control sites]] - in order to prevent the launch of all Minuteman ICBMs. Even though the Minuteman ICBMs would have been left unscathed in their missile silos following an LCC decapitation strike, the Minuteman missiles could not be launched without a command and control capability. In other words, the Soviets only needed 100 warheads to fully eliminate command and control of the Minuteman ICBMs. Even if the Soviets chose to expend two to three warheads per LCC for assured damage expectancy, the Soviets would only have had to expend up to 300 warheads to disable the Minuteman ICBM force - far less than the total number of Minuteman silos. The Soviets could have then used the remaining warheads to strike other targets they chose.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://afmissileers.com/Mar17.pdf |title=ALCS Article, page 13 |access-date=2017-04-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170702014829/http://afmissileers.com/Mar17.pdf |archive-date=2017-07-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Faced with only a few Minuteman LCC targets, the Soviets could have concluded that the odds of being successful in a Minuteman LCC decapitation strike were higher with less risk than it would have been having to face the almost insurmountable task of successfully attacking and destroying 1000 Minuteman silos and 100 Minuteman LCCs to ensure Minuteman was disabled. This theory motivated SAC to design a survivable means to launch Minuteman, even if all the ground-based command and control sites were destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://afmissileers.com/Mar17.pdf |title=ALCS Article, page 13 |access-date=2017-04-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170702014829/http://afmissileers.com/Mar17.pdf |archive-date=2017-07-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Born out of an original concept to have an airborne launch capability from SAC’s [[Operation Looking Glass|Looking Glass]] aircraft to launch the [[Emergency Rocket Communication System]] (ERCS), SAC modified this plan to launch the entire Minuteman force from the air as well. The ERCS was an [[Ultra High Frequency]] (UHF) communications package placed on top of a Minuteman II ICBM in place of its nuclear warhead. [[Missile combat crew|Missile crews]] could record an [[Emergency Action Message]] (EAM) into the ERCS and launch the missile on a lofted trajectory broadcasting the recorded EAM below to any available strategic forces. Placed on a modified [[Boeing EC-135|EC-135]] command post aircraft and thoroughly tested, the ALCS demonstrated its capability on 17 April 1967 by launching an ERCS configured Minuteman II out of Vandenberg AFB, CA. This first test launch using the ALCS and ERCS shows the original roots of ALCS. However, all Minuteman ICBM sites were modified and built to have the capability to receive commands from ALCS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://afmissileers.com/Mar17.pdf |title=ALCS Article, page 14 |access-date=2017-04-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170702014829/http://afmissileers.com/Mar17.pdf |archive-date=2017-07-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After successfully demonstrating the ALCS could launch a Minuteman ICBM from the air, ALCS achieved Initial Operational Capability (IOC) on 31 May 1967. From that point on, airborne missileers stood alert with [[Airborne Launch Control Center|ALCS-capable EC-135 aircraft]] for several decades. Over the years, ALCS operations were adapted in order to ensure the most effective use of this survivable ICBM launch capability. With ALCS now standing alert around-the-clock, the Soviets could no longer successfully launch a Minuteman LCC decapitation strike. Even if the Soviets attempted to do so, EC-135s equipped with the ALCS could  fly overhead and launch the remaining Minuteman ICBMs in retaliation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://afmissileers.com/Mar17.pdf |title=ALCS Article, page 14 |access-date=2017-04-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170702014829/http://afmissileers.com/Mar17.pdf |archive-date=2017-07-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Now that ALCS was on alert, this complicated Soviet war planning by forcing the Soviets to not only target the 100 LCCs, but also the 1000 silos with more than one warhead in order to guarantee destruction. This would have required upwards of 3000 warheads to complete such an attack. The odds of being successful in such an attack on the Minuteman ICBM force would have been extremely low. What is more, the Soviets would have been faced with attacking the remainder of the US [[nuclear triad]], which would have made the odds even lower. Therefore, the mission of ALCS and the [[nuclear triad]] was to deter the Soviets from launching any attack in the  first place. This deterrence mission continues to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://afmissileers.com/Mar17.pdf |title=ALCS Article, page 14 |access-date=2017-04-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170702014829/http://afmissileers.com/Mar17.pdf |archive-date=2017-07-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Strategic Air Command Era===
From 1967 to 1970, ALCS missile crews belonged to the [[68th Strategic Missile Squadron]] (SMS) at [[Ellsworth AFB]], SD and [[91st Strategic Missile Wing]] (SMW) at [[Minot AFB]], ND. ALCS equipment was installed on various [[Boeing EC-135|EC-135]] variants to include the EC-135A, EC-135C, EC-135G, and for a short while on the EC-135L. From 1967 to 1970 these aircraft belonged to the [[28th Expeditionary Air Refueling Squadron|28th Air Refueling Squadron]] (AREFS) at Ellsworth AFB, SD, the [[906th Air Refueling Squadron|906th AREFS]] at Minot AFB, ND, and the [[38th Reconnaissance Squadron|38th Strategic Reconnaissance Squadron]] (SRS) at [Offutt AFB], NE.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://afmissileers.com/Mar17.pdf |title=ALCS Article, page 14 |access-date=2017-04-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170702014829/http://afmissileers.com/Mar17.pdf |archive-date=2017-07-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[Hopkins III, Robert S. 1997. Boeing KC-135 Stratotanker: More Than Just a Tanker. Leicester, England: Midland Publishing Limited, p. 196]&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 1970, there were only two SAC squadrons that operated [[Airborne Launch Control Center|ALCS-capable aircraft]]. This included the [[2nd Airborne Command and Control Squadron]] (ACCS) operating EC-135C aircraft out of Offutt AFB, NE and the [[4th Airborne Command and Control Squadron|4th ACCS]] operating EC-135A, EC-135C, and EC-135G aircraft out of Ellsworth AFB, SD. All three variants of these EC-135A/C/G aircraft had ALCS equipment installed onboard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://afmissileers.com/Mar17.pdf |title=ALCS Article, page 14 |access-date=2017-04-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170702014829/http://afmissileers.com/Mar17.pdf |archive-date=2017-07-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Boeing EC-135G (717-148), USA - Air Force AN0823212.jpg|thumb|EC-135G at Ellsworth AFB, SD]]

The [[4th Airborne Command and Control Squadron|4th ACCS]] was the workhorse of ALCS operations. Three dedicated [[Airborne Launch Control Center|Airborne Launch Control Centers]] (ALCC) (pronounced “Al-see”), designated ALCC No. 1, ALCC No. 2, and ALCC No. 3 were on ground alert around-the-clock providing ALCS coverage for five of the six Minuteman ICBM Wings. These dedicated ALCCs were mostly EC-135A aircraft but sometimes were EC-135C or EC-135G aircraft, depending on availability. ALCC No. 1 was on ground alert at Ellsworth AFB, SD and during a wartime scenario, its role would have been to take off and orbit between the Minuteman Wings at [[Ellsworth AFB]], SD and [[F.E. Warren AFB]], WY, providing ALCS assistance if needed. ALCCs No. 2 and No. 3 were routinely on forward deployed ground alert at Minot AFB, ND. During a wartime scenario, ALCC No. 3’s role would have been to take off and orbit between the Minuteman ICBM Wings at [[Minot AFB]], ND and [[Grand Forks AFB]], ND, providing ALCS assistance if needed. ALCC No. 2’s dedicated role was to take off and orbit near the Minuteman ICBM Wing at [[Malmstrom AFB]], MT, providing ALCS assistance if needed. The 4th ACCS also maintained an EC-135C or EC-135G on ground alert at Ellsworth as the West Auxiliary Airborne Command Post (WESTAUXCP), which was a backup to SAC’s [[Operation Looking Glass|Looking Glass]] Airborne Command Post (ABNCP), as well as a radio relay link between the Looking Glass and ALCCs when airborne. Although equipped with ALCS, the WESTAUXCP did not have a dedicated Minuteman ICBM wing to provide ALCS assistance to.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://afmissileers.com/Mar17.pdf |title=ALCS Article, page 14 |access-date=2017-04-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170702014829/http://afmissileers.com/Mar17.pdf |archive-date=2017-07-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ALCS 6.png|thumb|ALCS Crewmember from 2 ACCS]]

The [[2nd Airborne Command and Control Squadron|2nd ACCS]] was another major player in ALCS operations. The primary mission of the 2nd ACCS was to fly the SAC ABNCP [[Operation Looking Glass|Looking Glass]] aircraft in continuous airborne operations. However, due to its close proximity in orbiting over the central US, the airborne Looking Glass provided ALCS coverage for the Minuteman Wing located at [[Whiteman AFB]], MO. Not only did Whiteman AFB have Minuteman II ICBMs, but it also had ERCS configured Minuteman missiles on alert. The 2 ACCS also had an additional EC-135C on ground alert at Offutt AFB, NE as the EASTAUXCP, providing backup to the airborne Looking Glass, radio relay capability, and a means for the Commander in Chief of SAC to escape an enemy nuclear attack. Although the EASTAUXCP was ALCS capable, it did not have a dedicated ALCS mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://afmissileers.com/Mar17.pdf |title=ALCS Article, page 15 |access-date=2017-04-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170702014829/http://afmissileers.com/Mar17.pdf |archive-date=2017-07-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For a short time in the early 1980s, one E-4B [[National Emergency Airborne Command Post]] (NEACP) also had ALCS equipment installed onboard during a test proof-of-concept program. Originally, SAC planned for a whole fleet of E-4Bs to replace all of the existing EC-135 Looking Glass aircraft in a program known as the Advanced Airborne Command Post. During the test trial, an E-4B, with a full SAC battlestaff and ALCS crew onboard, periodically flew Looking Glass missions out of Offutt AFB, NE in order to ascertain the feasibility of replacing the EC-135 fleet. In the end however, too many resources were needed and it was deemed too expensive to have the E-4B replace the EC-135. The ALCS equipment was subsequently removed from the E-4B and it continued the NEACP mission while the various EC-135s continued to perform the ABNCP and ALCC missions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://afmissileers.com/Mar17.pdf |title=ALCS Article, page 15 |access-date=2017-04-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170702014829/http://afmissileers.com/Mar17.pdf |archive-date=2017-07-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ALCS 1.png|thumb|Common ALCS equipment came online in 1987 so that the ALCS could be compatible with the new Peacekeeper ICBM. The Common ALCS equipment is still in use today.]]

Needless to say, this was the heyday of ALCS operations. Around-the-clock, there were three dedicated ALCCs on ground alert, one ALCS capable Looking Glass SAC ABNCP airborne at all times, and at least two ALCS-capable Auxiliary ABNCPs on ground alert. Airborne missileers, along with all other Cold Warriors kept the peace for several decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://afmissileers.com/Mar17.pdf |title=ALCS Article, page 15 |access-date=2017-04-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170702014829/http://afmissileers.com/Mar17.pdf |archive-date=2017-07-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-Cold War Era===
With the collapse of the Warsaw Pact and Soviet Union and subsequent end of the Cold War, several unfortunate events for ALCS unfolded. First, the 4th ACCS was deactivated along with the retirement of most of the EC-135 aircraft in the Air Force’s inventory. Looking Glass continuous airborne operations ceased, the Strategic Air Command was disbanded, and the 2nd ACCS was redesignated as the 7th ACCS. Even though times had changed and many were eager to cash in on the so-called “Peace Dividend” of the post-Cold War era, there were others that argued against these changes. In the end, it was impossible to stop the momentum of world events and all these changes. However, through all the turmoil, airborne missileers operating ALCS remained on alert and continued to remain vigilant, just like they always had. Although ALCS operations were no longer as wide spread as they once were with dedicated ALCCs on alert, ALCS remained on alert with the SAC and the US Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM) EC-135C ABNCPs. The Looking Glass alert posture was now a mix of both airborne and ground alert operations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://afmissileers.com/Mar17.pdf |title=ALCS Article, page 15 |access-date=2017-04-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170702014829/http://afmissileers.com/Mar17.pdf |archive-date=2017-07-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another big change to ALCS operations occurred on 1 October 1998. On this day, the Air Force’s EC-135Cs ceased to perform USSTRATCOM Looking Glass operations and was subsequently retired. The Navy’s [[E-6B Mercury]] took over USSTRATCOM’s Looking Glass mission and associated ALCS mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://afmissileers.com/Mar17.pdf |title=ALCS Article, page 15 |access-date=2017-04-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170702014829/http://afmissileers.com/Mar17.pdf |archive-date=2017-07-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally, the E-6A was built to perform the TAke Charge And Move Out ([[TACAMO]]) mission of relaying Emergency Action Messages to Navy Ballistic Missile Submarines in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. However, when it was decided to retire the remainder of the Air Force’s EC-135C fleet, the E-6A was extensively modified. A battlestaff compartment was added, additional communications equipment was installed, and ALCS equipment was installed. Due to these extensive modifications, this new variant of the Mercury was redesignated from the E-6A to the E-6B. Now, whenever a USSTRATCOM battlestaff and ALCS crew are onboard, the E-6B is known as the USSTRATCOM ABNCP.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://afmissileers.com/Mar17.pdf |title=ALCS Article, page 15 |access-date=2017-04-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170702014829/http://afmissileers.com/Mar17.pdf |archive-date=2017-07-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:E-6B_Mercury_flies_over_Solomons_Island_in_November_2014.JPG|thumb|E-6B Mercury. Current ALCS equipped aircraft.]]

===Current Era===
Today, at least one USSTRATCOM ABNCP is on alert around-the-clock. It is postured with a full USSTRATCOM battlestaff and ALCS crew onboard to perform the Looking Glass mission in the event the USSTRATCOM Global Operations Center (GOC) is incapacitated. The aircraft can takeoff quickly to avoid any threat. The ALCS crew onboard still provides a survivable launch capability for the Air Force’s Minuteman III ICBMs located at the three remaining Missile Wings located at [[Malmstrom Air Force Base|Malmstrom AFB]], MT; [[Minot Air Force Base|Minot AFB]], ND; and [[Francis E. Warren Air Force Base|F.E. Warren AFB]], WY. Just like its original inception, ALCS on alert today provides an adversary with an insurmountable task of trying to destroy the Minuteman ICBM force. Even if the ground Launch Control Centers are destroyed, the USSTRATCOM ABNCP can fly overhead and the airborne missileers onboard can launch the remaining Minuteman III ICBMs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://afmissileers.com/Mar17.pdf |title=ALCS Article, pages 15-16 |access-date=2017-04-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170702014829/http://afmissileers.com/Mar17.pdf |archive-date=2017-07-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==ALCS Personnel==
Although the ALCS now resides on a Navy aircraft, the ALCS equipment is owned and operated by Air Force Global Strike Command (AFGSC). The Missile Combat Crew Commander-Airborne (MCCC-A) is always a second or third tour assignment missileer and is from the [[625th Strategic Operations Squadron]] (STOS) located at Offutt AFB, NE. The Deputy Missile Combat Crew Commander-Airborne (DMCCC-A) is a joint USSTRATCOM position. Both ALCS crewmembers go through initial and monthly recurring ALCS training provided by the 625th STOS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://afmissileers.com/Mar17.pdf |title=ALCS Article, page 16 |access-date=2017-04-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170702014829/http://afmissileers.com/Mar17.pdf |archive-date=2017-07-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer''', also designated '''AMS-02''', is a [[particle physics]] experiment module that is mounted on the [[International Space Station]] (ISS).

In March 2013, at a seminar at CERN, Professor Samuel Ting reported that AMS had observed over 400,000 [[positron]]s, with the positron to electron fraction increasing from 10 GeV to 250 GeV. (Later results have shown a decrease in positron fraction at energies over about 275 GeV). There was "no significant variation over time, or any preferred incoming direction. These results are consistent with the positrons originating from the annihilation of dark matter particles in space, but not yet sufficiently conclusive to rule out other explanations." The results have been published in ''[[Physical Review Letters]]''.&lt;ref name="physrevltrs413"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Aguilar | first1 = M. | last2 = Alberti | first2 = G. | last3 = Alpat | first3 = B. | last4 = Alvino | first4 = A. | last5 = Ambrosi | first5 = G. | last6 = Andeen | first6 = K. | last7 = Anderhub | first7 = H. | last8 = Arruda | first8 = L. | last9 = Azzarello | first9 = P. | last10 = Bachlechner | first10 = A. | last11 = Barao | first11 = F. | last12 = Baret | first12 = B. | last13 = Barrau | first13 = A. | last14 = Barrin | first14 = L. | last15 = Bartoloni | first15 = A. | last16 = Basara | first16 = L. | last17 = Basili | first17 = A. | last18 = Batalha | first18 = L. | last19 = Bates | first19 = J. | last20 = Battiston | first20 = R. | last21 = Bazo | first21 = J. | last22 = Becker | first22 = R. | last23 = Becker | first23 = U. | last24 = Behlmann | first24 = M. | last25 = Beischer | first25 = B. | last26 = Berdugo | first26 = J. | last27 = Berges | first27 = P. | last28 = Bertucci | first28 = B. | last29 = Bigongiari | first29 = G. | last30 = Biland | first30 = A. | title = First Result from the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer on the International Space Station: Precision Measurement of the Positron Fraction in Primary Cosmic Rays of 0.5–350 GeV | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.110.141102 | journal = Physical Review Letters | volume = 110 | issue = 14 | pages = 141102 | date = 2013 |bibcode = 2013PhRvL.110n1102A | display-authors = 29 | pmid=25166975| url = https://boa.unimib.it/bitstream/10281/44680/1/2013_PhysRevLett.110.141102_positron_fraction.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional data are still being collected.&lt;ref name="physrevltrs413" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AMS-20130403"&gt;{{cite web |author=Staff |title=First Result from the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer Experiment |url=http://www.ams02.org/2013/04/first-results-from-the-alpha-magnetic-spectrometer-ams-experiment/ |date=3 April 2013 |work=AMS Collaboration |accessdate=3 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AP-20130403"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Heilprin |first1=John |last2=Borenstein |first2=Seth |title=Scientists find hint of dark matter from cosmos |url=http://apnews.excite.com/article/20130403/DA5E6JAG3.html |date=3 April 2013 |work=[[AP News]] |accessdate=3 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC-20130403"&gt;{{cite news |last=Amos |first=Jonathan |title=Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer zeroes in on dark matter |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-22016504 |date=3 April 2013 |work=[[BBC]] |accessdate=3 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NASA-20130403"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Perrotto |first1=Trent J. |last2=Byerly |first2=Josh |title=NASA TV Briefing Discusses Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer Results |url=http://www.nasa.gov/home/hqnews/2013/apr/HQ_M13-054_AMS_Findings_Briefing.html |date=2 April 2013 |work=[[NASA]] |accessdate=3 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20130403"&gt;{{cite news |last=Overbye |first=Dennis |title=New Clues to the Mystery of Dark Matter |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/04/science/space/new-clues-to-the-mystery-of-dark-matter.html |date=3 April 2013 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=3 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://home.web.cern.ch/about/updates/2013/04/ams-experiment-measures-antimatter-excess-space&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The alpha magnetic spectrometer was proposed in 1995 by [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] particle physicist Samuel Ting, not long after the cancellation of the [[Superconducting Super Collider]]. The proposal was accepted and Ting became the [[principal investigator]].&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite news|first=Dennis |last=Overbye

An AMS prototype designated AMS-01, a simplified version of the detector, was built by the international consortium under Ting's direction and flown into space aboard the {{OV|103}} on [[STS-91]] in June 1998. By not detecting any  [[antihelium#Antihelium|antihelium]] the ''AMS-01'' established an upper limit of 1.1×10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; for the antihelium to helium [[flux]] ratio&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Physics Reports |volume=366 |issue=6 |pages=331–405 |date=August 2002 |author=AMS Collaboration |last2=Aguilar |first2=M. |last3=Alcaraz |first3=J. |last4=Allaby |first4=J. |last5=Alpat |first5=B. |last6=Ambrosi |first6=G. |last7=Anderhub |first7=H. |last8=Ao |first8=L. |last9=Arefiev |first9=A. |displayauthors=8|title=The Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS) on the International Space Station: Part I – results from the test flight on the space shuttle |bibcode=2002PhR...366..331A |doi=10.1016/S0370-1573(02)00013-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and proved that the detector concept worked in space.

=== AMS-02 ===
[[File:AMS01Geneva.jpg|thumb|right|AMS-02 during integration and testing at [[CERN]] near Geneva.]]
After the flight of the prototype, Ting began the development of a full research system designated AMS-02. This development effort involved the work of 500 scientists from 56 institutions and 16 countries organized under [[United States Department of Energy]] (DOE) sponsorship.

The instrument which eventually resulted from a long evolutionary process has been called "the most sophisticated particle detector ever sent into space", rivaling very large detectors used at major [[particle accelerator]]s, and has cost four times as much as any of its ground-based counterparts.  Its goals have also evolved and been refined over time.  As built it is a more comprehensive detector which has a better chance of discovering evidence of [[dark matter]] along other goals.&lt;ref&gt;Controversy Follows Pricey Space Station Experiment to Launch Pad, SCIENCE, VOL. 332, 22 APRIL 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The power requirements for AMS-02 were thought to be too great for a practical independent spacecraft. So AMS-02 was designed to be installed as an external module on the International Space Station and use power from the ISS. The post-{{OV|102}} plan was to deliver AMS-02 to the ISS by space shuttle in 2005 on [[assembly of the International Space Station|station assembly]] mission '''UF4.1''', but technical difficulties and shuttle scheduling issues added more delays.&lt;ref name="overview"&gt;{{cite web

A cryogenic, [[superconducting magnet]] system was developed for the AMS-02. With [[Obama administration]] plans to extend International Space Station operations beyond 2015, the decision was made by AMS management to exchange the AMS-02 superconducting magnet for the non-superconducting magnet previously flown on AMS-01. Although the non-superconducting magnet has a weaker [[field strength]], its on-orbit operational time at ISS is expected to be 10 to 18 years versus only three years for the superconducting version.&lt;ref name="AWST"&gt;{{cite web

==Design==
The detector module consists of a series of detectors that are used to determine various characteristics of the radiation and particles as they pass through. Characteristics are determined only for particles that pass through from top to bottom. Particles that enter the detector at any other angles are rejected. From top to bottom the subsystems are identified as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Experimental evidence indicates that [[Milky Way|our galaxy]] is made of [[matter]]; however, scientists believe there are about 100–200 billion galaxies in the Universe and some versions of the [[Big Bang]] theory of the origin of the Universe require equal amounts of matter and antimatter. Theories that explain this apparent asymmetry violate other measurements. Whether or not there is significant antimatter is one of the fundamental questions of the origin and nature of the Universe. Any observations of an [[antihelium]] nucleus would provide evidence for the existence of antimatter in space. In 1999, ''AMS-01'' established a new upper limit of 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; for the antihelium/helium flux ratio in the Universe. AMS-02 will search with a sensitivity of 10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt;, an improvement of three orders of magnitude over ''AMS-01'', sufficient to reach the edge of the expanding Universe and resolve the issue definitively.

===Dark matter===
{{See also|Dark matter}}
The visible matter in the Universe, such as stars, adds up to less than 5 percent of the total mass that is known to exist from many other observations. The other 95 percent is dark, either dark matter, which is estimated at 20 percent of the Universe by weight, or [[dark energy]], which makes up the balance. The exact nature of both still is unknown. One of the leading candidates for dark matter is the [[neutralino]]. If neutralinos exist, they should be colliding with each other and giving off an excess of charged particles that can be detected by AMS-02. Any peaks in the background [[positron]], [[antiproton]], or [[gamma ray]] flux could signal the presence of neutralinos or other dark matter candidates, but would need to be distinguished from poorly known [[confounding]] astrophysical signals.

===Strangelets===
{{See also|Strangelet}}
Six types of [[quark]]s ([[up quark|up]], [[down quark|down]], [[strange quark|strange]], [[charm quark|charm]], [[bottom quark|bottom]] and [[top quark|top]]) have been found experimentally; however, the majority of matter on Earth is made up of only up and down quarks. It is a fundamental question whether there exists stable matter made up of strange quarks in combination with up and down quarks. Particles of such matter are known as [[strangelet]]s. Strangelets might have extremely large mass and very small charge-to-mass ratios. It would be a totally new form of matter. AMS-02 may determine whether this extraordinary matter exists in our local environment.

===Space radiation environment===
[[Cosmic ray|Cosmic radiation]] during transit is a significant obstacle to [[human mission to Mars|sending humans to Mars]]. Accurate measurements of the cosmic ray environment are needed to plan appropriate countermeasures. Most cosmic ray studies are done by balloon-borne instruments with flight times that are measured in days; these studies have shown significant variations. AMS-02 is operative on the [[International Space Station|ISS]], gathering a large amount of accurate data and allowing measurements of the long term variation of the cosmic ray flux over a wide energy range, for nuclei from [[proton]]s to [[iron]]. In addition to the understanding the radiation protection required for astronauts during [[human spaceflight|interplanetary flight]], this data will allow the interstellar propagation and origins of cosmic rays to be identified.

==Results==
In July 2012, it was reported that AMS-02 had observed over 18 billion cosmic rays.&lt;ref name="BBC_2012-07-25" /&gt;

In February 2013, Samuel Ting acknowledged that he would be publishing the first scholarly paper in a few weeks, and that in its first 18 months of operation AMS had recorded 25 billion particle events including nearly eight billion fast electrons and positrons.&lt;ref name="BBC_2013-02-18" /&gt; The AMS paper reported the positron-electron ratio in the mass range of 0.5 to 350 [[GeV]], providing evidence about the [[weakly interacting massive particle]] (WIMP) model of dark matter.

On 30 March 2013, the first results from the AMS experiment were announced by the [[CERN]] press office.&lt;ref name="physrevltrs413" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AMS-20130403" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AP-20130403" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC-20130403" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NASA-20130403" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20130403" /&gt;&lt;ref name="First result from the AMS experiment"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first physics results were published in ''[[Physical Review Letters]]'' on 3 April 2013.&lt;ref name="physrevltrs413" /&gt;  A total of 6.8×10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; [[positron]] and [[electron]] events were collected in the energy range from 0.5 to 350 GeV.  The positron fraction (of the total electron plus positron events) steadily increased from energies of 10 to 250  GeV, but the slope decreased by an order of magnitude above 20 GeV, even though the fraction of positrons still increased. There was no fine structure in the positron fraction spectrum, and no [[anisotropies]] were observed.  The accompanying ''Physics'' Viewpoint&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Coutu | first1 = S. | title = Positrons Galore | doi = 10.1103/Physics.6.40 | journal = Physics | volume = 6 | date = 2013 |bibcode = 2013PhyOJ...6...40C }}&lt;/ref&gt; said that "The first results from the space-borne Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer confirm an unexplained excess of high-energy positrons in Earth-bound cosmic rays." These results are consistent with the positrons originating from the annihilation of dark matter particles in space, but not yet sufficiently conclusive to rule out other explanations. [[Samuel Ting]] said "Over the coming months, AMS will be able to tell us conclusively whether these positrons are a signal for dark matter, or whether they have some other origin."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://home.web.cern.ch/about/updates/2013/04/ams-experiment-measures-antimatter-excess-space| title= AMS experiment measures antimatter excess in space}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 18, 2014, new results with almost twice as much data were presented in a talk at CERN and published in ''Physical Review Letters''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=L Accardo|author2=AMS Collaboration|title=High Statistics Measurement of the Positron Fraction in Primary Cosmic Rays of 0.5–500 GeV with the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer on the International Space Station|journal=Physical Review Letters|date=18 September 2014|volume=113|page=121101|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.113.121101|url=http://ams.nasa.gov/Documents/AMS_Publications/PhysRevLett.113.121101.pdf|bibcode = 2014PhRvL.113l1101A }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New results from the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer on the International Space Station|url=http://ams.nasa.gov/Documents/AMS_Publications/ams_new_results_-_18.09.2014.pdf|website=AMS-02 at NASA|accessdate=21 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schirber|first1=Michael|title=Synopsis: More Dark Matter Hints from Cosmic Rays?|url=http://physics.aps.org/synopsis-for/10.1103/PhysRevLett.113.121102|publisher=American Physical Society|accessdate=21 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A new measurement of positron fraction up to 500 GeV was reported, showing that positron fraction peaks at a maximum of about 16% of total electron+positron events, around an energy of 275 ± 32 GeV. At higher energies, up to 500 GeV, the ratio of positrons to electrons begins to fall again.

AMS presented for 3 days at CERN in April 2015, covering new data on 300 million proton events and helium flux.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Physics community to discuss latest results of the AMS experiment {{!}} CERN press office|url = http://press.web.cern.ch/press-releases/2015/04/physics-community-discuss-latest-results-ams-experiment|website = press.web.cern.ch|accessdate = 2015-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; It revealed in December 2016 that it had discovered a few signals consistent with antihelium nuclei amidst several billion helium nuclei. The result remains to be verified, and the team is currently trying to rule out contamination.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/04/giant-space-magnet-may-have-trapped-antihelium-raising-idea-lingering-pools-antimatter|title=Giant space magnet may have trapped antihelium, raising idea of lingering pools of antimatter in the cosmos|publisher=Science|author=Joshua Sokol|date=April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy''', or ACEEE, is a [[nonprofit organization|nonprofit]], [[501(c)#501.28c.29.283.29|501(c)(3)]] organization. Founded in 1980, ACEEE's mission is to act as a catalyst to advance [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] policies, programs, technologies, investments, and behaviors in order to help achieve greater economic prosperity, energy security, and environmental protection.

ACEEE promotes energy efficiency by conducting technical and policy analyses; advising policymakers and program managers; and working collaboratively with businesses, government officials, public interest groups, and other organizations. It convenes conferences and workshops, primarily for energy efficiency professionals, and produces reports, books, conference proceedings, and media outreach.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guidestar.org/pqShowGsReport.do?partner=justgivews&amp;ein=94-2711707 GuideStar Organization Details]&lt;/ref&gt;

ACEEE employs more than 35 [[Washington, D.C.]]-based employees, and holds field offices in Delaware, Michigan, Washington, and Wisconsin. The organization's primary focuses are on end-use efficiency in [[industry]], [[buildings]], [[utilities]], and [[transportation]]; [[economic impact analysis|economic analysis]] and [[human behavior]]; and state and national [[Public policy|policy]].

== Federal and State Energy Policy ==

===Federal Policy===
ACEEE has worked on [[US energy policy|federal energy policy]] since the 1980s. The organization played central roles in the development of the [[National Appliance Energy Conservation Act]] of 1987, energy efficiency provisions in the [[Energy Policy Act of 1992]] and the [[Energy Policy Act of 2005]], and the [[Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007]]. It also played a role in the development of energy efficiency sections in recent [[U.S. farm bill|farm bills]]. Many of these provisions were developed in cooperation with interested business and received [[bipartisan]] support.

ACEEE staff testify before [[United States Congress|Congress]] and work closely with Congressional staff in both [[political party|parties]] to help shape new initiatives and analyze the impacts of energy and climate policy proposals. They weigh in on the [[United States budget process|federal budget process]], promoting and increasing funding for what they deem the most effective energy efficiency programs.

The organization also works with federal agencies such as the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] and the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] on programs and policies, and participates in formal rulemakings on energy efficiency issues. Most of ACEEE's federal policy work involves research and education; however, they do a limited amount of [[lobbying]] using unrestricted funds.

They supported the [[EPS Service Parts Act of 2014 (H.R. 5057; 113th Congress)]], a bill that would exempt certain [[external power supply|external power supplies]] from complying with standards set forth in a final rule published by the [[United States Department of Energy]] in February 2014.&lt;ref name=cbo5057&gt;{{cite web|title=CBO - H.R. 5057|url=http://www.cbo.gov/publication/45574|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|accessdate=9 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ITIhankin&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hankin|first1=Christopher|title=House Energy &amp; Commerce Committee passes bipartisan regulatory relief for external power supplies|url=http://blog.itic.org/blog/house-energy-commerce-committee-passes-bipartisan-regulatory-relief-for-external-power-supplies|publisher=Information Technology Industry Council|accessdate=10 September 2014|date=15 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce]] describes the bill as a bill that "provides regulatory relief by making a simple technical correction to the [[Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007|2007 Energy Independence and Security Act]] to exempt certain power supply (EPS) service and spare parts from federal efficiency standards."&lt;ref name=ECCpr&gt;{{cite web|title=Committee to Build on #RecordOfSuccess with Nine Bills On the House Floor This Week|url=http://energycommerce.house.gov/press-release/committee-build-recordofsuccess-nine-bills-house-floor-week|publisher=House Energy and Commerce Committee|accessdate=10 September 2014|date=8 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===State Policy===
At the state level, ACEEE works closely with public officials and local energy efficiency advocates, providing advice, analysis, and technical support. In order to maximize its impact, the organization concentrates its efforts on large states that are poised to make major decisions on energy efficiency policy issues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wapa.gov/es/pubs/ESB/2008/nov/nov085.htm Western Area Power Association: Website of the Month]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in 2007 and 2008, it emphasized work in [[Florida]], [[Maryland]], [[Michigan]], [[Ohio]], [[Pennsylvania]], [[Texas]], and [[Virginia]]. All of these states passed significant energy efficiency legislation, with additional legislation and regulations likely in some of them.

ACEEE also works on state policies that can potentially be adopted at the national level. For example, staff have worked with several states to develop state appliance and equipment [[Minimum energy performance standard|efficiency standards]], which have subsequently been adopted by Congress.

== Research and Analysis ==

ACEEE devotes much of its resources to research and analysis in order to discern the best technical, program, and policy practices that promote efficient energy use, and to define the magnitude of benefits of energy efficiency. Research staff survey market trends and activities, analyze technical and economic potential for energy efficiency, seek to understand consumer energy decisions, and assess the potential for [[regulations]], policies, and programs to achieve energy savings.
ACEEE's research programs include:
*'''Buildings and equipment''' - ACEEE's oldest research program analyzes opportunities for energy efficiency in [[Home appliance|appliances]] and equipment; [[green building|building design]], [[construction]], and operation; and programs and policies that encourage consumers to make energy-efficient product choices.
*'''Utilities''' - Serves as the principal documenter and reviewer of publicly funded energy efficiency programs and supporting policies, preparing regular surveys of best practices and supporting implementers and [[Regulatory agency|regulators]] in designing the next generation of programs and policies.
*'''Transportation''' - Tracks vehicle technology and estimates the potential for future energy efficiency. In addition, the program explores technologies and policies that encourage changes in personal and [[freight]] transportation markets to further reduce energy use.
*'''Industry''' - Applies unique experience in energy efficiency for the [[manufacturing]] sector (including [[Distributed Energy Resources|distributed energy resources]] such as [[combined heat and power]]), and assesses [[Emerging technologies|technologies]], [[Best practice|practices]], programs, and policies to achieve increased energy efficiency in manufacturing.
*'''Agriculture''' - Addresses the unique energy efficiency program and policy needs of [[farms]] and [[rural communities]] through assessment of energy use patterns, and opportunities for more energy efficiency practices and technologies.
*'''Economic analysis''' - Encourages the use of sound [[economic model]]ing practices, studies the impacts of energy policies on the economy, and projects the [[Cost-benefit analysis|economic benefits]] of energy efficiency technologies, practices, and policies.
*'''State analysis''' - Cross-program effort that combines expertise from other research programs to assess state energy policies, analyze the potential for energy efficiency at the state level, and collect key resources to support state policymakers, program implementers, and efficiency advocates.
*'''International''' - Works with colleagues from transitional economies to adapt technology, program, and policy experiences from the United States to these economies.

== Outreach ==
ACEEE attempts to reach out to and inform diverse audiences in a variety of ways:

===Conferences===
ACEEE holds several conferences each year that aim to bring together disparate stakeholders to focus on multiple aspects of energy efficiency and the role it plays in addressing critical issues such as [[climate change]], [[energy resources]], utility structure and regulation, and energy use in buildings, industry, and agriculture.

'''Bismuth''' is a [[chemical element]] with symbol&amp;nbsp;'''Bi''' and [[atomic number]] 83. It is a [[pentavalent]] [[post-transition metal]] and one of the [[pnictogen]]s with chemical properties resembling its lighter homologs [[arsenic]] and [[antimony]]. Elemental bismuth may occur naturally, although its [[sulfide]] and [[oxide]] form important commercial ores. The [[free element]] is 86% as dense as [[lead]]. It is a brittle metal with a silvery white color when freshly produced, but surface [[redox|oxidation]] can give it a pink tinge. Bismuth is marginally [[radioactive]], and the most naturally [[Diamagnetism|diamagnetic]] element, and has one of the lowest values of [[thermal conductivity]] among metals.

Bismuth was long considered the element with the highest atomic mass that is stable, but in 2003 it was discovered to be extremely weakly [[radioactive]]: its only [[primordial isotope]], [[bismuth-209]], decays via [[alpha decay]] with a [[half-life]] more than a [[1000000000 (number)|billion]] times the estimated [[age of the universe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://physicsworld.com/cws/article/news/2003/apr/23/bismuth-breaks-half-life-record-for-alpha-decay| title=Bismuth breaks half-life record for alpha decay| date=23 April 2003| publisher=Physicsworld| first=Belle| last= Dumé}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kean&gt;{{cite book|last=Kean|first=Sam|title=The Disappearing Spoon (and other true tales of madness, love, and the history of the world from the Periodic Table of Elements)|publisher=Back Bay Books |location=New York/Boston|year=2011|pages=158–160|isbn=978-0-316-051637}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of its tremendously long half-life, bismuth may still be considered stable for almost all purposes.&lt;ref name=Kean/&gt;

Bismuth metal has been known since ancient times, although it was often confused with lead and tin, which share some physical properties. The etymology is uncertain, but possibly comes from Arabic ''bi ismid'', meaning having the properties of antimony&lt;ref&gt;[http://webmineral.com/data/Bismuth.shtml Bismuth]. WebMineral. Retrieved on 17 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; or the German words ''weiße Masse'' or ''Wismuth'' ("white mass"), translated in the mid-sixteenth century to [[New Latin]] ''bisemutum''.&lt;ref name=oet/&gt;

Bismuth compounds account for about half the production of bismuth. They are used in cosmetics, pigments, and a few pharmaceuticals, notably [[bismuth subsalicylate]], used to treat diarrhea.&lt;ref name="Kean"/&gt; Bismuth's unusual propensity to expand upon freezing is responsible for some of its uses, such as in casting of printing type.&lt;ref name="Kean"/&gt; Bismuth has unusually low [[toxicity]] for a heavy metal.&lt;ref name="Kean"/&gt; As the toxicity of lead has become more apparent in recent years, there is an increasing use of bismuth alloys (presently about a third of bismuth production) as a replacement for lead.

== History ==

[[File:Bismuth symbol by Torbern Bergman.png|thumb|upright=0.5|left|[[Alchemical symbol]] used by [[Torbern Bergman]], 1775]]

The name ''bismuth'' dates from around the 1660s, and is of uncertain etymology. It is one of the first 10 metals to have been discovered. Bismuth appears in the 1660s, from obsolete [[German language|German]] ''{{lang|de|Bismuth}}'', ''{{lang|de|Wismut}}'', ''{{lang|de|Wissmuth}}'' (early 16th century); perhaps related to [[Old High German]] ''{{lang|goh|hwiz}}'' ("white").&lt;ref name=oet&gt;{{OEtymD|bismuth}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[New Latin]] ''{{lang|la|bisemutum}}'' (due to [[Georgius Agricola]], who Latinized many German mining and technical words) is from the German ''{{lang|de|Wismuth}}'', perhaps from ''{{lang|de|weiße Masse}}'', "white mass".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=vVhpurkfeN4C&amp;pg=PA41| page = 41| title = Chemistry of arsenic, antimony, and bismuth| isbn = 978-0-7514-0389-3| author1 = Norman| first1 = Nicholas C.| date = 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; The element was confused in early times with [[tin]] and lead because of its resemblance to those elements. Bismuth has been known since ancient times, so no one person is credited with its discovery. [[Georgius Agricola|Agricola]], in [[De Natura Fossilium]] (c. 1546) states that bismuth is a distinct metal in a family of metals including tin and lead. This was based on observation of the metals and their physical properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Agricola, Georgious| title = De Natura Fossilium| location = New York| publisher = Mineralogical Society of America| origyear= 1546 | date=1955| page = 178}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- https://books.google.com/books?id=9pxPAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA143 --&gt; Miners in the age of alchemy also gave bismuth the name ''{{lang|la|tectum argenti}},'' or "silver being made," in the sense of silver still in the process of being formed within the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| chapter-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=GL5PAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PT181| page = 181| chapter = Bismuth| title = American edition of the British encyclopedia: Or, Dictionary of Arts and sciences ; comprising an accurate and popular view of the present improved state of human knowledge| author1 = Nicholson| first1 = William| date = 1819}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Weeks"&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.1021/ed009p11|title = The discovery of the elements.

&lt;!-- "Artificial bismuth" was commonly used in place of the actual metal. It was made by hammering tin into thin plates, and cementing them by a mixture of white tartar, [[Potassium nitrate|saltpeter]], and [[arsenic]], stratified in a [[crucible]] over an open fire.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} --&gt;

=== Physical characteristics ===
Bismuth is a brittle metal with a white, silver-pink hue, often with an [[Iridescence|iridescent]] [[Bismuth(III) oxide|oxide]] tarnish showing many colors from yellow to blue. The spiral, stair-stepped structure of bismuth crystals is the result of a higher growth rate around the outside edges than on the inside edges. The variations in the thickness of the oxide layer that forms on the surface of the crystal cause different wavelengths of light to interfere upon reflection, thus displaying a rainbow of colors. When [[combustion|burned]] in [[oxygen]], bismuth burns with a blue [[flame]] and [[bismuth oxide|its oxide]] forms yellow [[Vapor|fumes]].&lt;ref name="CRC" /&gt; Its [[toxicity]] is much lower than that of its neighbors in the [[periodic table]], such as lead, [[antimony]], and [[polonium]].

No other metal is verified to be more naturally [[Diamagnetism|diamagnetic]] than bismuth.&lt;ref name="CRC" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kruger|Krüger]], p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Superdiamagnetism]] is a different physical phenomenon.) Of any metal, it has one of the lowest values of [[thermal conductivity]] (after [[manganese]], and maybe [[neptunium]] and [[plutonium]]) and the highest [[Hall effect|Hall coefficient]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| doi = 10.1098/rspa.1936.0126 |jstor = 96773| title = The Theory of the Galvomagnetic Effects in Bismuth| date = 1936| last1 = Jones| first1 = H.| journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences| volume = 155| issue = 886| page = 653|bibcode = 1936RSPSA.155..653J}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has a high [[Electrical resistivity and conductivity|electrical resistivity]].&lt;ref name="CRC"&gt;{{cite book| first= C.

Though virtually unseen in nature, high-purity bismuth can form distinctive, colorful [[hopper crystal]]s.

=== Chemical characteristics ===

Bismuth is stable to both dry and moist air at ordinary temperatures. When red-hot, it reacts with water to make bismuth(III) oxide.&lt;ref name=s8/&gt;

: 2 Bi + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

It reacts with [[fluorine]] to make [[bismuth(V) fluoride]] at 500&amp;nbsp;°C or [[bismuth(III) fluoride]] at lower temperatures (typically from Bi melts); with other [[halogen]]s it yields only bismuth(III) halides.&lt;ref name=w770&gt;[[#Wiberg|Wiberg]], pp. 769–770.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=g559&gt;[[#Greenwood|Greenwood]], pp. 559–561.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=k185/&gt; The trihalides are corrosive and easily react with moisture, forming [[oxyhalides]] with the formula BiOX.&lt;ref name=s9&gt;[[#Suzuki|Suzuki]], p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

: 2 Bi + 3 X&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 BiX&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (X = F, Cl, Br, I)

Bismuth dissolves in concentrated [[sulfuric acid]] to make [[bismuth(III) sulfate]] and [[sulfur dioxide]].&lt;ref name=s8&gt;[[#Suzuki|Suzuki]], p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

: 6 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 Bi → 6 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 3 SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

It reacts with [[nitric acid]] to make [[bismuth(III) nitrate]].

: Bi + 6 HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + 3 NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + Bi(NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

It also dissolves in [[hydrochloric acid]], but only with oxygen present.&lt;ref name=s8/&gt;

: 4 Bi + 3 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 12 HCl → 4 BiCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 6 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

It is used as a [[Transmetalation|transmetalating]] agent in the synthesis of alkaline-earth metal complexes:

: 3 Ba + 2 BiPh&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → 3 BaPh&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 Bi

=== Isotopes ===
{{main|Isotopes of bismuth}}

The only primordial [[isotope]] of bismuth, [[bismuth-209]], was traditionally regarded as the heaviest stable isotope, but it had long been suspected&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.1007/BF02824346|title = Alpha-activity of {{SimpleNuclide2|Bismuth|209}}|date = 1972|last1 = Carvalho|first1 = H. G.|last2 = Penna|first2 = M.|journal = Lettere al Nuovo Cimento|volume = 3|issue = 18|page = 720}}&lt;/ref&gt; to be unstable on theoretical grounds. This was finally demonstrated in 2003, when researchers at the Institut d'Astrophysique Spatiale in [[Orsay]], France, measured the [[Alpha decay|alpha emission]] [[half-life]] of {{SimpleNuclide2|Bismuth|209|link=yes}} to be {{val|1.9|e=19|u=years}},&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Marcillac|first = Pierre de| author2 = Noël Coron| author3 = Gérard Dambier| author4 = Jacques Leblanc| author5 = Jean-Pierre Moalic| last-author-amp = yes|date=2003|title = Experimental detection of α-particles from the radioactive decay of natural bismuth|journal = Nature|volume = 422|pages = 876–878|pmid=12712201|doi = 10.1038/nature01541|issue = 6934| bibcode= 2003Natur.422..876D}}&lt;/ref&gt; over a [[1000000000 (number)|billion]] times longer than the current estimated [[age of the universe]].&lt;ref name=Kean /&gt; Owing to its extraordinarily long half-life, for all presently known medical and industrial applications, bismuth can be treated as if it is stable and nonradioactive. The radioactivity is of academic interest because bismuth is one of a few elements whose radioactivity was suspected and theoretically predicted before being detected in the laboratory.&lt;ref name=Kean /&gt; Bismuth has the longest known alpha decay half-life, although [[Isotopes of tellurium|tellurium-128]] has a [[double beta decay]] half-life of over {{val|2.2|e=24|u=years}}.&lt;ref name="NUBASE"&gt;{{cite journal| first = Audi| last = Georges|title = The NUBASE Evaluation of Nuclear and Decay Properties| journal = Nuclear Physics A| volume = 729| issue = 1| pages = 3–128| date = 2003| doi=10.1016/j.nuclphysa.2003.11.001| bibcode= 2003NuPhA.729....3A| last2 = Bersillon| first2 = O.| last3 = Blachot| first3 = J.| last4 = Wapstra| first4 = A. H.| citeseerx = 10.1.1.692.8504}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bismuth's extremely long half life means that less than one billionth of the bismuth present at the formation of the planet Earth would have decayed into thallium since then.

Several isotopes of bismuth with short half-lives occur within the radioactive disintegration chains of [[actinium]], [[radium]], and [[thorium]], and more have been synthesized experimentally. Bismuth-213 is also found on the decay chain of [[uranium-233]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZAHJkrJlwbYC&amp;pg=PA78|page =78 |title=Modern Nuclear Chemistry |isbn=978-0-471-11532-8 |last1= Loveland |first1=Walter D. |last2=Morrissey |first2=David J. |last3=Seaborg |first3=Glenn T. |date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commercially, the radioactive isotope bismuth-213 can be produced by bombarding [[radium]] with [[bremsstrahlung]] photons from a [[linear particle accelerator]]. In 1997, an antibody conjugate with bismuth-213, which has a 45-minute half-life and decays with the emission of an alpha particle, was used to treat patients with leukemia. This isotope has also been tried in cancer treatment, for example, in the targeted alpha therapy (TAT) program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S0360-3016(01)01585-1| title=Advancements in cancer therapy with alpha-emitters: a review|date=2001| last1=Imam|first1=S.| journal=International Journal of Radiation Oncology Biology Physics|volume=51|page=271}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y6haWM6lFkYC&amp;pg=PT520|page =520 |title=Issues in Cancer Epidemiology and Research |date= 2011 |isbn=978-1-4649-6352-0 |last= Acton | first= Ashton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Chemical compounds ==
{{category see also|Bismuth compounds}}

Bismuth forms trivalent and pentavalent compounds, the trivalent ones being more common. Many of its chemical properties are similar to those of [[arsenic]] and [[antimony]], although they are less toxic than derivatives of those lighter elements.

=== Oxides and sulfides ===

At elevated temperatures, the vapors of the metal combine rapidly with oxygen, forming the yellow trioxide, [[Bismuth(III) oxide|{{chem|Bi|2|O|3}}]].&lt;ref name="w768"/&gt;&lt;ref name=g553&gt;[[#Greenwood|Greenwood]], p. 553.&lt;/ref&gt; When molten, at temperatures above 710&amp;nbsp;°C, this oxide corrodes any metal oxide, and even platinum.&lt;ref name=k185&gt;[[#Kruger|Krüger]], p. 185&lt;/ref&gt; On reaction with base, it forms two series of [[oxyanion]]s: {{chem|BiO|2|-}}, which is polymeric and forms linear chains, and {{chem|BiO|3|3-}}. The anion in {{chem|Li|3|BiO|3}} is actually a cubic octameric anion, {{chem|Bi|8|O|24|24-}}, whereas the anion in {{chem|Na|3|BiO|3}} is tetrameric.&lt;ref name="norman1" /&gt;

[[Bismuth oxychloride]] (BiOCl, see figure at right) and [[bismuth oxynitrate]] (BiONO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) stoichiometrically appear as simple anionic salts of the bismuthyl(III) cation (BiO&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) which commonly occurs in aqueous bismuth compounds. However, in the case of BiOCl, the salt crystal forms in a structure of alternating plates of Bi, O, and Cl atoms, with each oxygen coordinating with four bismuth atoms in the adjacent plane. This mineral compound is used as a pigment and cosmetic (see below).&lt;ref name=k184/&gt;

=== Bismuthine and bismuthides ===

Unlike the lighter [[pnictogen]]s nitrogen, phosphorus, and arsenic, but similar to [[antimony]], bismuth does not form a stable [[hydride]]. Bismuth hydride, [[bismuthine]] ({{chem|BiH|3}}), is an [[endothermic]] compound that spontaneously decomposes at room temperature. It is stable only below −60&amp;nbsp;°C.&lt;ref name="norman1"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bismuthide|Bismuthides]] are [[intermetallic]] compounds between bismuth and other metals.

In 2014 researchers discovered that sodium bismuthide can exist as a form of matter called a “three-dimensional topological Dirac semi-metal” (3DTDS) that possess 3D [[Dirac fermion]]s in bulk. It is a natural, three-dimensional counterpart to [[graphene]] with similar [[electron mobility]] and velocity. Graphene and [[topological insulator]]s (such as those in 3DTDS) are both crystalline materials that are electrically insulating inside but conducting on the surface, allowing them to function as [[transistor]]s and other electronic devices. While sodium bismuthide ({{chem|Na|3|Bi}}) is too unstable to be used in devices without packaging, it can demonstrate potential applications of 3DTDS systems, which offer distinct efficiency and fabrication advantages over planar graphene in [[semiconductor]] and [[spintronics]] applications.

=== Halides ===

The [[halide]]s of bismuth in low oxidation states have been shown to adopt unusual structures. What was originally thought to be bismuth(I) chloride, BiCl, turns out to be a complex compound consisting of Bi{{su|b=9|p=5+}} cations and BiCl{{su|b=5|p=2−}} and Bi{{su|b=2}}Cl{{su|b=8|p=2−}} anions.&lt;ref name="norman1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gillespie1"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bi{{su|b=9|p=5+}} cation has a distorted tricapped [[trigonal prism]]atic molecular geometry, and is also found in {{chem|Bi|10|Hf|3|Cl|18}}, which is prepared by reducing a mixture of [[hafnium(IV) chloride]] and [[bismuth chloride]] with elemental bismuth, having the structure {{chem|[Bi|+|] [Bi|9|5+|] [HfCl|6|2-|]|3}}.&lt;ref name="norman1"/&gt;{{rp|50}} Other polyatomic bismuth cations are also known, such as Bi{{su|b=8|p=2+}}, found in {{chem|Bi|8|(AlCl|4|)|2}}.&lt;ref name="gillespie1" /&gt; Bismuth also forms a low-valence bromide with the same structure as "BiCl". There is a ''true'' monoiodide, BiI, which contains chains of {{chem|Bi|4|I|4}} units. BiI decomposes upon heating to the triiodide, [[Bismuth(III) iodide|{{chem|BiI|3}}]], and elemental bismuth. A monobromide of the same structure also exists.&lt;ref name="norman1" /&gt;
In oxidation state +3, bismuth forms trihalides with all of the halogens: [[bismuth trifluoride|{{chem|BiF|3}}]], [[bismuth(III) chloride|{{chem|BiCl|3}}]], [[bismuth tribromide|{{chem|BiBr|3}}]], and [[bismuth(III) iodide|{{chem|BiI|3}}]]. All of these except {{chem|BiF|3}} are [[hydrolyze]]d by water.&lt;ref name="norman1" /&gt;

[[Bismuth(III) chloride]] reacts with [[hydrogen chloride]] in [[ether]] solution to produce the acid {{chem|HBiCl|4}}.&lt;ref name=s8/&gt;

The oxidation state +5 is less frequently encountered. One such compound is [[bismuth pentafluoride|{{chem|BiF|5}}]], a powerful oxidizing and fluorinating agent. It is also a strong fluoride acceptor, reacting with [[xenon tetrafluoride]] to form the {{chem|XeF|3|+}} cation:&lt;ref name=s8/&gt;

In the Earth's crust, bismuth is about [[Abundances of the elements (data page)|twice as abundant as gold]]. The most important [[ore]]s of bismuth are [[bismuthinite]] and [[bismite]].&lt;ref name=CRC/&gt; Native bismuth is known from Australia, Bolivia, and China.&lt;ref name="arizona1"&gt;{{cite book|editor=Anthony, John W.|editor2=Bideaux, Richard A.|editor3=Bladh, Kenneth W.|editor4=Nichols, Monte C. |title=Handbook of Mineralogy |publisher=Mineralogical Society of America |place=Chantilly, VA, US |volume=I (Elements, Sulfides, Sulfosalts) |chapter-url=http://rruff.geo.arizona.edu/doclib/hom/bismuth.pdf |chapter-format=PDF |chapter=Bismuth |accessdate=5 December 2011 |isbn=978-0-9622097-0-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kruger|Krüger]], pp. 172–173.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[United States Geological Survey]], the world mining production of bismuth in 2014 was 13,600 tonnes, with the major contributions from China (7,600 tonnes), Vietnam (4,950 tonnes) and Mexico (948 tonnes).&lt;ref name=usgs2016&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/bismuth/mcs-2016-bismu.pdf|title=2016 USGS Minerals Yearbook: Bismuth|format = PDF| accessdate =1 July 2016|publisher = United States Geological Survey|last=Anderson|first= Schuyler C.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The refinery production in 2010 was 16,000 tonnes, of which China produced 13,000, Mexico 850 and Belgium 800 tonnes.&lt;ref name=usgs2010&gt;{{cite web|url=http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/bismuth/myb1-2010-bismu.pdf|title=2010 USGS Minerals Yearbook: Bismuth|format = PDF| accessdate =9 September 2010|publisher = United States Geological Survey|last=Carlin|first= James F., Jr.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The difference reflects bismuth's status as a byproduct of extraction of other metals such as lead, copper, tin, molybdenum and tungsten.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kruger|Krüger]], p. 173.&lt;/ref&gt; World bismuth production from refineries is a more complete and reliable statistic.&lt;ref name="Oje"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi = 10.1016/0891-3919(57)90180-8 |title = The preparation of bismuth for use in a liquid-metal fuelled reactor |date = 1957 |last1 = Horsley |first1 = G.

Bismuth travels in crude lead bullion (which can contain up to 10% bismuth) through several stages of refining, until it is removed by the [[Kroll-Betterton process]] which separates the impurities as slag, or the electrolytic [[Betts process]]. Bismuth will behave similarly with another of its major metals, copper.&lt;ref name="Oje"&gt;{{cite journal |doi = 10.1007/BF03222821 |title = Bismuth—Production, properties, and applications |date = 1992 |last1 = Ojebuoboh |first1 = Funsho K. |journal = JOM |volume = 44 |issue = 4 |pages = 46–49|bibcode = 1992JOM....44d..46O}}&lt;/ref&gt; The raw bismuth metal from both processes contains still considerable amounts of other metals, foremost lead. By reacting the molten mixture with chlorine gas the metals are converted to their chlorides while bismuth remains unchanged. Impurities can also be removed by various other methods for example with fluxes and treatments yielding high-purity bismuth metal (over 99% Bi).

=== Price ===

[[File:BiPrice.png|thumb|upright=1.3|World mine production and annual averages of bismuth price (New York, not adjusted for inflation).&lt;ref name=usgs/&gt;]]
The price for pure bismuth metal has been relatively stable through most of the 20th century, except for a spike in the 1970s. Bismuth has always been produced mainly as a byproduct of lead refining, and thus the price usually reflected the cost of recovery and the balance between production and demand.&lt;ref name=usgs/&gt;

Demand for bismuth was small prior to World War II and was pharmaceutical – bismuth compounds were used to treat such conditions as digestive disorders, [[sexually transmitted infection]]s and burns. Minor amounts of bismuth metal were consumed in fusible alloys for [[fire sprinkler]] systems and [[Fuse (electrical)|fuse wire]]. During World War II bismuth was considered a [[strategic material]], used for solders, fusible alloys, medications and atomic research. To stabilize the market, the producers set the price at $1.25 per pound (2.75 $/kg) during the war and at $2.25 per pound (4.96 $/kg) from 1950 until 1964.&lt;ref name=usgs/&gt;

In the early 1970s, the price rose rapidly as a result of increasing demand for bismuth as a metallurgical additive to aluminium, iron and steel. This was followed by a decline owing to increased world production, stabilized consumption, and the recessions of 1980 and 1981–82. In 1984, the price began to climb as consumption increased worldwide, especially in the United States and Japan. In the early 1990s, research began on the evaluation of bismuth as a nontoxic replacement for lead in ceramic glazes, fishing sinkers, food-processing equipment, free-machining [[brass]]es for plumbing applications, lubricating greases, and shot for [[waterfowl hunting]].&lt;ref name=s14&gt;[[#Suzuki|Suzuki]], p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Growth in these areas remained slow during the middle 1990s, in spite of the backing of lead replacement by the US Government, but intensified around 2005. This resulted in a rapid and continuing increase in price.&lt;ref name=usgs&gt;[http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/bismuth/ Bismuth Statistics and Information]. see "Metal Prices in the United States through 1998" for a price summary and "Historical Statistics for Mineral and Material Commodities in the United States" for production. USGS.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Recycling ===
Most bismuth is produced as a byproduct of other metal-extraction processes including the smelting of lead, and also of tungsten and copper. Its [[sustainability]] is dependent on increased recycling, which is problematic.

It was once believed that bismuth could be practically recycled from the soldered joints in electronic equipment. Recent efficiencies in solder application in electronics mean there is substantially less solder deposited, and thus less to recycle. While recovering the silver from silver-bearing solder may remain economic, recovering bismuth is substantially less so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://leadfree.ipc.org/files/RoHS_15.pdf|author = Warburg, N|publisher = University of Stuttgart|title = IKP, Department of Life-Cycle Engineering|accessdate = 5 May 2009|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090225155540/http://leadfree.ipc.org/files/RoHS_15.pdf|archivedate = 25 February 2009|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Next in recycling feasibility would be sizeable catalysts with a fair bismuth content, such as bismuth phosphomolybdate.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}, bismuth used in galvanizing, and as a free-machining metallurgical additive.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

Bismuth in uses where it is dispersed most widely include certain stomach medicines ([[bismuth subsalicylate]]), paints ([[bismuth vanadate]]), [[pearlescent]] cosmetics ([[bismuth oxychloride]]), and bismuth-containing bullets. Recycling bismuth from these uses is impractical.

== Applications ==

Bismuth has few commercial applications, and those applications that use it generally require small quantities relative to other raw materials. In the United States, for example, 884 tonnes of bismuth were consumed in 2010, of which 63% went into chemicals (including pharmaceuticals, pigments, and cosmetics); 26% into metallurgical additives for casting and galvanizing;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.1016/j.matlet.2006.06.029|title = The effect of bismuth on the structure of zinc hot-dip galvanized coatings|date = 2007|last1 = Pistofidis|first1 = N.|last2 = Vourlias|first2 = G.|last3 = Konidaris|first3 = S.|last4 = Pavlidou|first4 = El.|last5 = Stergiou|first5 = A.|last6 = Stergioudis|first6 = G.|journal = Materials Letters|volume = 61|issue = 4–5|page = 994}}&lt;/ref&gt; 7% into bismuth alloys, solders and ammunition; and 4% into research and other uses.&lt;ref name=usgs2010/&gt;

Some manufacturers use bismuth as a substitute in equipment for potable water systems such as valves to meet "lead-free" mandates in the U.S. (began in 2014).  This is a fairly large application since it covers all residential and commercial building construction.

In the early 1990s, researchers began to evaluate bismuth as a nontoxic replacement for lead in various applications.

=== Medicines ===

Bismuth is an ingredient in some pharmaceuticals,&lt;ref name=Kean /&gt; although the use of some of these substances is declining.&lt;ref name=k184/&gt;
* [[Bismuth subsalicylate]] is used as an [[diarrhea|antidiarrheal]];&lt;ref name=Kean /&gt; it is the [[active ingredient]] in such "Pink Bismuth" preparations as [[Pepto-Bismol]], as well as the 2004 reformulation of [[Kaopectate]]. It is also used to treat some other gastro-intestinal diseases and [[cadmium poisoning]].&lt;ref name=Kean /&gt; The mechanism of action of this substance is still not well documented, although an [[oligodynamic effect]] (toxic effect of small doses of heavy metal ions on microbes) may be involved in at least some cases. [[Salicylic acid]] from [[hydrolysis]] of the compound is antimicrobial for toxogenic ''E. coli,'' an important pathogen in [[traveler's diarrhea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Sox TE|author2= Olson CA|title=Binding and killing of bacteria by bismuth subsalicylate|journal =Antimicrob Agents Chemother|date= 1989|volume=33|issue=12|pages=2075–82|pmid=2694949|pmc=172824|doi=10.1128/AAC.33.12.2075}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* a combination of [[bismuth subsalicylate]] and [[bismuth subcitrate]] is used to treat the bacteria causing [[peptic ulcer]]s.
* [[Bibrocathol]] is an organic bismuth-containing compound used to treat eye infections.
* [[Bismuth subgallate]], the [[active ingredient]] in Devrom, is used as an internal deodorant to treat malodor from [[flatulence]] and [[feces]].
* Bismuth compounds (including [[sodium bismuth tartrate]]) were formerly used to treat syphilis&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Parnell, R. J. G. |title=Bismuth in the Treatment of Syphilis|journal=Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine|date=1924|volume=17|pages=19–26|pmc=2201253|issue=War section|pmid=19984212}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite patent|country=USA|number=1540117|title=Manufacture of bismuth tartrates|inventor=Giemsa, Gustav }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Milk of bismuth" (an aqueous suspension of [[bismuth hydroxide]] and [[bismuth subcarbonate]]) was marketed as an alimentary cure-all in the early 20th century.
* [[Bismuth subnitrate]] (Bi&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;O(OH)&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;(NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[bismuth subcarbonate]] (Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)) are also used in medicine.&lt;ref name=CRC/&gt;

=== Cosmetics and pigments ===

[[Bismuth oxychloride]] (BiOCl) is sometimes used in cosmetics, as a pigment in paint for eye shadows, hair sprays and nail polishes.&lt;ref name=Kean /&gt;&lt;ref name=k184/&gt;&lt;ref name="Effp"&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.1016/j.porgcoat.2005.07.003|title = Effect pigments—past, present and future|date = 2005|last1 = Maile|first1 = Frank J.|last2 = Pfaff|first2 = Gerhard|last3 = Reynders|first3 = Peter|journal = Progress in Organic Coatings|volume = 54|issue = 3|page = 150}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Paff"&gt;{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Q1Pc0aY-vg4C&amp;pg=PA36| page = 36|title = Special effect pigments: Technical basics and applications|isbn = 978-3-86630-905-0|author1 = Pfaff|first1 = Gerhard|date = 2008|publisher=Vincentz Network GmbH}}&lt;/ref&gt; This compound is found as the mineral bismoclite and in crystal form contains layers of atoms (see figure above) that refract light chromatically, resulting in an [[iridescent]] appearance similar to [[nacre]] of pearl. It was used as a cosmetic in [[ancient Egypt]] and in many places since. ''Bismuth white'' (also "Spanish white") can refer to either bismuth oxychloride or [[bismuth oxynitrate]] (BiONO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), when used as a white pigment. Bismuth vanadate is used as a light-stable non-reactive paint pigment (particularly for artists' paints), often as a replacement for the more toxic cadmium sulfide yellow and orange-yellow pigments. The most common variety in artists' paints is a lemon yellow, visually indistinguishable from its cadmium-containing alternative.

=== Metal and alloys ===

Bismuth is used in metal alloys with other metals such as iron, to create alloys to go into automatic sprinkler systems for fires. It was also used to make [[bismuth bronze]] which was used in the Bronze Age.

==== Lead replacement ====

The density difference between lead (11.32&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) and bismuth (9.78&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) is small enough that for many [[ballistics]] and weighting applications, bismuth can substitute for [[lead]]. For example, it can replace lead as a dense material in [[fishing sinker]]s. It has been used as a replacement for lead in [[Shot (pellet)|shot]], bullets and [[less-lethal]] [[riot gun]] ammunition. The Netherlands, Denmark, England,  Wales, the US, and many other countries now prohibit the use of lead shot for the hunting of wetland birds, as many birds are prone to [[lead poisoning]] owing to mistaken ingestion of lead (instead of small stones and grit) to aid digestion, or even prohibit the use of lead for all hunting, such as in the Netherlands. Bismuth-tin alloy shot is one alternative that provides similar ballistic performance to lead. (Another less expensive but also more poorly performing alternative is "steel" shot, which is actually soft iron.) Bismuth's lack of [[malleability]] does, however, make it unsuitable for use in expanding hunting bullets.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole paragraph|date=January 2015}}

Bismuth, as a dense element of high atomic weight, is used in bismuth-impregnated [[latex shield]]s to shield from X-ray in medical examinations, such as [[X-ray computed tomography|CTs]], mostly as it is considered non-toxic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hopper KD|author2=King SH|author3=Lobell ME|author4=TenHave TR|author5=Weaver JS|title= The breast: inplane x-ray protection during diagnostic thoracic CT—shielding with bismuth radioprotective garments|pmid=9393547|date=1997|volume=205|issue=3|pages=853–8|journal=Radiology|doi=10.1148/radiology.205.3.9393547}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[European Union]]'s [[Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive]] (RoHS) for reduction of lead has broadened bismuth's use in electronics as a component of low-melting point solders, as a replacement for traditional tin-lead solders.&lt;ref name=usgs2010/&gt; Its low toxicity will be especially important for solders to be used in food processing equipment and copper water pipes, although it can also be used in other applications including those in the automobile industry, in the EU for example.&lt;ref name=lohse&gt;{{cite web|first1 = Joachim |last1 = Lohse|first2 = Stéphanie |last2 = Zangl|first3=Rita|last3=Groß|first4=Carl-Otto|last4=Gensch|first5=Otmar|last5=Deubzer|url = http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/pdf/description_layout.pdf|format = PDF| accessdate =11 September 2009|title = Adaptation to Scientific and Technical Progress of Annex II Directive 2000/53/EC|publisher=European Commission|date=September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bismuth has been evaluated as a replacement for lead in free-machining [[brass]]es for [[plumbing]] applications,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.1016/j.matchar.2006.02.005|title = Compositional distributions in classical and lead-free brasses|date = 2006|last1 = La Fontaine|first1 = A.|last2 = Keast|first2 = V. J.|journal = Materials Characterization|volume = 57|issue = 4–5|page = 424}}&lt;/ref&gt; although it does not equal the performance of leaded steels.&lt;ref name=lohse/&gt;

==== Other metal uses and specialty alloys ====

&lt;!-- *The high diamagnetic susceptibility of bismuth is used for [[Magnetic levitation|diamagnetic levitation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.instructables.com/id/Magnetic-Levitation-Sculpture/ |title=Magnetic Levitation Sculpture |publisher=Instructables.com |date=30 August 2011 |accessdate=14 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;&lt;!-- Hardly a significant application --&gt;&lt;!--  *Diamagnetic levitation with bismuth uses blocks of this metal as a shield to provide the levitation of very strong small magnets (typically neodymium, iron, boron compositions). The system must be very well adjusted including many times the action of external strong magnets. Practical examples of experiments can be found in the Internet under the clue "Bismuth Magnetic Levitation" --&gt;
Many bismuth [[alloy]]s have low [[melting point]]s and are found in specialty applications such as [[solder]]s. Many automatic sprinklers, electric fuses, and safety devices in fire detection and suppression systems contain the eutectic In19.1-Cd5.3-Pb22.6-Sn8.3-Bi44.7 alloy that melts at {{convert|47|C}}&lt;ref name=CRC/&gt;  This is a convenient temperature since it is unlikely to be exceeded in normal living conditions. Low-melting alloys, such as Bi-Cd-Pb-Sn alloy which melts at 70&amp;nbsp;°C, are also used in automotive and aviation industries. Before deforming a thin-walled metal part, it is filled with a melt or covered with a thin layer of the alloy to reduce the chance of breaking. Then the alloy is removed by submerging the part in boiling water.&lt;ref name=k183&gt;[[#Kruger|Krüger]], p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bismuth is used to make [[free-machining steel]]s and free-machining aluminium alloys for precision machining properties.

The shrinking on solidification in lead and the expansion of bismuth compensate each other and therefore lead and bismuth are often used in similar quantities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Wl1azjcJblIC&amp;pg=PA239|page = 239|title = Steels: Metallurgy and applications|isbn = 978-0-7506-3757-2|author1 = Llewellyn|first1 = D.

* [[Bismuth vanadate]] is an opaque yellow pigment used by some artists' oil, acrylic, and watercolor paint companies, primarily as a replacement for the more toxic cadmium sulfide yellows in the greenish-yellow (lemon) to orange-toned yellow range. It performs practically identically to the cadmium pigments, such as in terms of resistance to degradation from UV exposure, opacity, tinting strength, and lack of reactivity when mixed with other pigments. The most commonly-used variety by artists' paint makers is lemon in color. In addition to being a replacement for several cadmium yellows, it also serves as a non-toxic visual replacement for the older chromate pigments made with zinc, lead, and strontium. If a green pigment and barium sulfate (for increased transparency) are added it can also serve as a replacement for barium chromate, which possesses a more greenish cast than the others. In comparison with lead chromates, it does not blacken due to hydrogen sulfide in the air (a process accelerated by UV exposure) and possesses a particularly brighter color than them, especially the lemon, which is the most translucent, dull, and fastest to blacken due to the higher percentage of lead sulfate required to produce that shade. It is also used, on a limited basis due to its cost, as an vehicle paint pigment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi = 10.1016/j.dyepig.2005.08.027|title = The photochromic effect of bismuth vanadate pigments: Investigations on the photochromic mechanism|date = 2007|last1 = Tücks|first1 = Andreas|last2 = Beck|first2 = Horst P.|journal = Dyes and Pigments|volume = 72|issue = 2|page = 163}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=WZV_hX9u0yIC&amp;pg=PA92|chapter = Yellow pigments|pages = 91–93|title = Coloring of plastics: Fundamentals, colorants, preparations|isbn = 978-1-56990-352-0|author = Müller, Albrecht|publisher=Hanser Verlag|date = 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[oxidation state]] of [[oxygen]] is −2 in almost all known '''compounds of oxygen'''. The oxidation state &amp;minus;1 is found in a few compounds such as [[peroxide]]s. Compounds containing oxygen in other oxidation states are very uncommon: −{{frac|2}} ([[superoxide]]s), −{{frac|3}}  ([[ozonide]]s), 0 (elemental, [[hypofluorous acid]]), +{{frac|2}} ([[dioxygenyl]]), +1 ([[dioxygen difluoride]]), and +2 ([[oxygen difluoride]]). 

Oxygen is reactive and will form oxides with all other elements except the [[noble gas]]es [[helium]], [[neon]], [[argon]], and [[krypton]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lenntech.com/Periodic-chart-elements/O-en.htm#Oxygen Chemical properties of Oxygen], Lenntech. Accessed January 25, 2008. "Oxygen is reactive and will form oxides with all other elements except helium, neon, argon and krypton."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oxides==
[[Water]] ({{chem|H|2|O}}) is the [[oxide]] of [[hydrogen]] and  most familiar oxygen compound. Its bulk properties partly result from the interaction of its component atoms, oxygen and hydrogen, with atoms of nearby water molecules. Hydrogen atoms are [[covalent bonding|covalently bonded]] to oxygen in a water molecule but also have an additional attraction (about 23.3&amp;nbsp;kJ·mol&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; per hydrogen atom) to an adjacent oxygen atom in a separate molecule.&lt;ref&gt;P. Maksyutenko, T. R. Rizzo, and O. V. Boyarkin (2006). "A direct measurement of the dissociation energy of water", J. Chem. Phys. 125 doi 181101.&lt;/ref&gt; These [[hydrogen bond]]s between water molecules hold them approximately 15% closer than what would be expected in a simple liquid with just [[Van der Waals force]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Water Hydrogen Bonding|last=Chaplin|first=Martin|url=http://www.lsbu.ac.uk/water/hbond.html|accessdate=2008-01-06|date=2008-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Also, since oxygen has a higher electronegativity than
hydrogen, the charge difference makes it a [[polar molecule]]. The interactions between the different [[dipole]]s of each molecule cause a net attraction force.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Rust screw.jpg|thumb|right|Oxides, such as [[iron oxide]] or [[rust]], {{chem|Fe|2|O|3}}, form when oxygen combines with other elements]]
Due to its [[electronegativity]], oxygen forms [[chemical bond]]s with almost all other free elements at elevated temperatures to give corresponding [[oxide]]s. However, some elements, such as [[iron]] which oxidises to [[iron oxide]], or rust, {{chem|Fe|2|O|3}}, readily oxidise at [[standard conditions for temperature and pressure]] (STP). The surface of metals like [[aluminium]] and [[titanium]] are oxidized in the presence of air and become coated with a thin film of oxide that [[Passivation (chemistry)|passivates]] the metal and slows further [[corrosion]].&lt;ref&gt;The [[aluminium oxide]] layer can be built to greater thickness by the process of [[electrolysis|electrolytic]] [[anodizing]].&lt;/ref&gt; So-called noble metals, such as [[gold]] and [[platinum]], resist direct chemical combination with oxygen, and substances like [[gold(III) oxide]] ({{chem|Au|2|O|3}}) must be formed by an indirect route.

The [[alkali metal]]s and [[alkali earth metal]]s all react spontaneously with oxygen when exposed to dry air to form oxides, and form hydroxides in the presence of oxygen and water. As a result, none of these elements is found in nature as a free metal. [[Caesium]] is so reactive with oxygen that it is used as a [[getter]] in [[vacuum tube]]s. Although solid magnesium reacts slowly with oxygen at STP, it is capable of burning in air, generating very high temperatures, and its metal powder may form explosive mixtures with air.

Oxygen is present as compounds in the atmosphere in trace quantities in the form of [[carbon dioxide]] ({{chem|C||O|2}}) and [[nitrogen oxide|oxides of nitrogen]] (NO&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;). The [[earth's crust]]al [[Rock (geology)|rock]] is composed in large part of oxides of [[silicon]] ([[silica]] {{chem|Si||O|2}}, found in [[granite]] and [[sand]]), [[aluminium]] ([[aluminium oxide]] {{chem|Al|2|O|3}}, in [[bauxite]] and [[corundum]]), [[iron]] ([[iron (III) oxide]] {{chem|Fe|2|O|3}}, in [[hematite]] and [[rust]]) and other oxides of [[metal]]s.

==Other inorganic compounds==
[[Image:Quartz oisan.jpg|thumb|left|[[Quartz]] is a common crystalline mineral made of [[silica]], or [[silicon dioxide]] ({{chem|Si||O|2}})]]
The rest of the Earth's crust is formed also of oxygen compounds, most importantly [[calcium carbonate]] (in [[limestone]]) and [[silicate]]s (in [[feldspar]]s).  Water-[[solubility|soluble]] silicates in the form of {{chem|Na|4|Si||O|4}}, {{chem|Na|2|Si||O|3}}, and {{chem|Na|2|Si|2|O|5}} are used as [[detergent]]s and [[adhesive]]s.&lt;ref name="ECE507"/&gt;

[[Peroxide]]s retain some of oxygen's original molecular structure (&lt;(&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt;O-O&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt;). White or light yellow [[sodium peroxide]] ({{chem|Na|2|O|2}}) is formed when metallic [[sodium]] is burned in oxygen. Each oxygen atom in its peroxide [[ion]] may have a full [[Octet rule|octet]] of 4 pairs of [[electron]]s.&lt;ref name="ECE507"&gt;[[#Reference-Cook-1968|Cook 1968]], p.507&lt;/ref&gt; [[Superoxide]]s are a class of compounds that are very similar to peroxides, but with just one unpaired electron for each pair of oxygen atoms ({{chem|O|2|-}}).&lt;ref name="ECE507"/&gt; These compounds form by oxidation of alkali metals with larger ionic radii (K, Rb, Cs). For example, [[potassium superoxide]] ({{chem|KO|2}}) is an orange-yellow solid formed when [[potassium]] reacts with oxygen. 

[[Hydrogen peroxide]] ({{chem|H|2|O|2}}) can be produced by passing a volume of 96% to 98% [[hydrogen]] and 2 to 4% oxygen through an electric discharge.&lt;ref name="ECE506"/&gt; A more commercially-viable method is to allow autoxidation of an organic intermediate,   [[Anthraquinone|2-ethylanthrahydroquinone]] dissolved in an organic solvent, to oxidize to {{chem|H|2|O|2}} and 2-ethylanthraquinone.&lt;ref name="ECE506"/&gt; The 2-ethylanthraquinone is then reduced and recycled back into the process.

When dissolved in water, many metallic oxide form [[alkaline]] solutions, while many oxides of nonmetals form [[acid]]ic solutions. For example, [[sodium oxide]] in solution forms the strong base [[sodium hydroxide]], while [[phosphorus pentoxide]] in solution forms [[phosphoric acid]].&lt;ref name="ECE506"&gt;[[#Reference-Cook-1968|Cook 1968]], p.506&lt;/ref&gt;

Oxygenated [[anion]]s such as [[chlorate]]s ({{chem|ClO|3|-}}), [[perchlorate]]s ({{chem|ClO|4|-}}), [[chromate]]s ({{chem|CrO|4|2-}}), [[dichromate]]s ({{chem|Cr|2|O|7|2-}}), [[permanganate]]s ({{chem|MnO|4|-}}), and [[nitrate]]s ({{chem|NO|3|-}}) are strong oxidizing agents.  Oxygen forms [[heteropoly acid]]s and [[polyoxometalate]] ions with [[tungsten]], [[molybdenum]] and some other [[transition metal]]s, such as [[phosphotungstic acid]] ({{chem|H|3|P||W|12|O|40}}) and octadecamolybdophosphoric acid ({{chem|H|6|P|2|Mo|18|O|62}}).

One unexpected oxygen compound is [[dioxygenyl hexafluoroplatinate]], {{chem|O|2|+|PtF|6|-}}, discovered in studying the properties of [[platinum hexafluoride]] ({{chem|PtF|6}}).&lt;ref name="ECE505"&gt;[[#Reference-Cook-1968|Cook 1968]], p.505&lt;/ref&gt; A change in color when this compound was exposed to atmospheric air suggested that dioxygen was being oxidized (in turn the difficulty of oxidizing oxygen led to the hypothesis that [[xenon]] might be oxidized by {{chem|PtF|6}}, resulting in discovery of the first xenon compound [[xenon hexafluoroplatinate]] {{chem|Xe|+|PtF|6|-}}). The cations of oxygen are formed only in the presence of stronger oxidants than oxygen, which limits them to the action of fluorine and certain fluorine compounds. Simple [[oxygen fluoride]]s are known.&lt;ref name=cotton-wilkinson&gt;Cotton, F. Albert and Wilkinson, Geoffrey (1972). ''Advanced Inorganic Chemistry: A comprehensive Text''. (3rd Edition).

==Organic compounds==
[[Image:Acetone-3D-vdW.png|thumb|[[Acetone]] is an important feeder material in the chemical industry.&lt;br&gt;&lt;small&gt;(oxygen is in red, carbon in black and hydrogen in white)&lt;/small&gt;]] 

Among the most important classes of organic compounds that contain oxygen are (where "R" is an organic group): [[alcohol]] (R-OH); [[ether]]s (R-O-R); [[ketone]]s (R-CO-R); [[aldehyde]]s (R-CO-H); [[carboxylic acid]]s (R-COOH); [[ester]]s (R-COO-R); [[acid anhydride]]s (R-CO-O-CO-R); [[amide]]s (R-C(O)-NR&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). There are many important organic [[solvent]]s that contain oxygen, among which: [[acetone]], [[methanol]], [[ethanol]], [[isopropanol]], [[furan]], [[tetrahydrofuran|THF]], [[diethyl ether]], [[dioxane]], [[ethylacetate]], [[dimethylformamide|DMF]], [[dimethyl sulfoxide|DMSO]], [[acetic acid]], [[formic acid]]. [[Acetone]] ({{chem|(CH|3|)|2|CO}}) and [[phenol]] ({{chem|C|6|H|5|OH}}) are used as feeder materials in the synthesis of many different substances. Other important organic compounds that contain oxygen are: [[glycerol]], [[formaldehyde]], [[glutaraldehyde]], [[citric acid]], [[acetic anhydride]], [[acetamide]], etc. [[Epoxide]]s are [[ether]]s in which the oxygen
atom is part of a ring of three atoms. 

Oxygen reacts spontaneously with many [[organic chemistry|organic]] compounds at or below room temperature in a process called [[autoxidation]].&lt;ref name="ECE506"/&gt; Alkaline solutions of [[pyrogallol]], benzene-1,2,3-triol absorb oxygen from the air, and are used in the determination of the atmospheric concentration of oxygen. Most of the [[organic compound]]s that contain oxygen are not made by direct action of oxygen. Organic compounds important in industry and commerce are made by direct oxidation of a precursor include:&lt;ref name="ECE507"/&gt;

* [[Ethylene oxide]] (used to make the [[antifreeze]] [[ethylene glycol]]) is obtained by direct oxidation of [[ethylene]]:
::{{chem|C|2|H|4}} + ½ {{chem|O|2}} + {{su|p=[[catalyst]]|b=———→}} {{chem|C|2|H|4|O}}

* [[Peracetic acid]] (feeder material for various [[epoxy]] compounds) is obtained from [[acetaldehyde]]:
::{{chem|CH|3|CHO}} + {{chem|O|2}} + {{su|p=catalyst|b=———→}} {{chem|CH|3|C(O)-OOH}}

==Biomolecules==
[[Image:ATP structure.svg|thumb|left|Oxygen represents more than 40% of the [[molecular weight]] of the [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] molecule]]
The element is found in almost all [[biomolecule]]s that are important to, or generated by, life. Only a few common complex biomolecules, such as [[squalene]] and the [[carotene]]s, contain no oxygen. Of the organic compounds with biological relevance, [[carbohydrate]]s contain the largest proportion by mass of oxygen (about 50%). All [[fat]]s, [[fatty acid]]s, [[amino acid]]s, and [[protein]]s contain oxygen (due to the presence of [[carbonyl]] groups in these acids and their [[ester]] residues). Furthermore, seven of the amino acids which are incorporated into proteins, have oxygen incorporated into their side-chains, as well. Oxygen also occurs in [[phosphate]] (PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3&amp;minus;&lt;/sup&gt;) groups in the biologically important energy-carrying molecules [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] and [[Adenosine diphosphate|ADP]], in the backbone and the [[purine]]s (except [[adenine]]) and [[pyrimidine]]s of [[RNA]] and [[DNA]], and in [[bone]]s as [[calcium phosphate]] and [[hydroxylapatite]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1242">'''Consuta''' was a revolutionary form of construction of watertight hulls for boats and marine aircraft, comprising four veneers of mahogany planking interleaved with waterproofed [[Calico (textile)|calico]] and stitched together with copper wire.

The technique was patented by Sam Saunders of [[Goring-on-Thames]] and was first used on the 1898 [[Umpire#Rowing|umpire's]] steam launch of the same name. Having been restored, the steam launch Consuta was returned to service on the [[River Thames]] on 15 October 2001.&lt;ref&gt;The Consuta Trust&lt;/ref&gt;

After opening the S. E. Saunders boatyard at [[East Cowes]] on the [[Isle of Wight]], the technique was further used to build the crew and engine gondolas for [[HMA No. 1|HMA1 Mayfly]], Britain's first airship. Later, the same technique was used to construct the hull of the [[Sopwith Bat Boat]], the early [[flying boat]] that won the [[Mortimer Singer prize]].

The technique remained in use until waterproof glues became available in the 1950s.

{{infobox curium}}
'''Curium''' is a [[transuranic element|transuranic]] [[radioactive decay|radioactive]] [[chemical element]] with symbol '''Cm''' and [[atomic number]] 96. This element of the [[actinide]] series was named after [[Marie Skłodowska-Curie|Marie]] and [[Pierre Curie]] – both were known for their research on [[radioactivity]]. Curium was first intentionally produced and identified in July 1944 by the group of [[Glenn T. Seaborg]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. The discovery was kept secret and only released to the public in November 1947. Most curium is produced by bombarding [[uranium]] or [[plutonium]] with [[neutron]]s in [[nuclear reactor]]s – one [[tonne]] of spent [[nuclear fuel]] contains about 20&amp;nbsp;grams of curium.

Curium is a hard, dense, silvery metal with a relatively high melting point and boiling point for an actinide. Whereas it is [[paramagnetism|paramagnetic]] at [[Standard conditions for temperature and pressure|ambient conditions]], it becomes [[antiferromagnetism|antiferromagnetic]] upon cooling, and other magnetic transitions are also observed for many curium compounds. In compounds, curium usually exhibits [[valence (chemistry)|valence]] +3 and sometimes +4, and the +3 valence is predominant in solutions. Curium readily oxidizes, and its oxides are a dominant form of this element. It forms strongly [[fluorescence|fluorescent]] complexes with various organic compounds, but there is no evidence of its incorporation into [[bacteria]] and [[archaea]]. When introduced into the human body, curium accumulates in the bones, lungs and liver, where it promotes [[cancer]].

All known [[isotope]]s of curium are radioactive and have a small [[critical mass]] for a sustained [[nuclear chain reaction]]. They predominantly emit [[alpha radiation|α-particles]], and the heat released in this process can serve as a heat source in [[radioisotope thermoelectric generator]]s, but this application is hindered by the scarcity and high cost of curium isotopes. Curium is used in production of heavier actinides and of the &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;Pu [[radionuclide]] for power sources in [[artificial pacemaker]]s. It served as the [[alpha radiation|α-source]] in the [[alpha particle X-ray spectrometer]]s installed on several space probes, including the [[Mars Pathfinder|Sojourner]], [[Spirit rover|Spirit]], [[Opportunity rover|Opportunity]] and [[Curiosity rover|Curiosity]] [[Mars]] rovers and the [[Philae lander]] on [[comet]] [[67P/Churyumov–Gerasimenko]], to analyze the composition and structure of the surface.

==History==
[[File:Glenn Seaborg - 1964.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Glenn T. Seaborg]]]]
[[File:Berkeley 60-inch cyclotron.gif|thumb|left|upright|The {{convert|60|in|cm|adj=on}} cyclotron at the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory, University of California, Berkeley, in August 1939.]]
Although curium had likely been produced in previous nuclear experiments, it was [[discoveries of the chemical elements|first intentionally synthesized]], isolated and identified in 1944, at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], by [[Glenn T. Seaborg]], [[Ralph A. James]], and [[Albert Ghiorso]]. In their experiments, they used a {{convert|60|in|cm|adj=on}} [[cyclotron]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = The New Chemistry: A Showcase for Modern Chemistry and Its Applications|first = Nina|last = Hall|publisher = Cambridge University Press|date = 2000|pages = 8–9|isbn = 978-0-521-45224-3|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=U4rnzH9QbT4C&amp;pg=PA8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Curium was chemically identified at the Metallurgical Laboratory (now [[Argonne National Laboratory]]) at the [[University of Chicago]]. It was the third [[transuranium element]] to be discovered even though it is the fourth in the series – the lighter element [[americium]] was unknown at the time.&lt;ref name="E96"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Seaborg|first1=Glenn T. |last2=James |first2=R. A. |last3=Ghiorso|first3=A.|title=The New Element Curium (Atomic Number 96)|journal=NNES PPR ''(National Nuclear Energy Series, Plutonium Project Record)''|volume=14 B|series=The Transuranium Elements: Research Papers, Paper No.&amp;nbsp;22.2 |publisher=McGraw-Hill Book Co., Inc., New York, |year=1949|osti=http://www.osti.gov/cgi-bin/rd_accomplishments/display_biblio.cgi?id=ACC0049&amp;numPages=13&amp;fp=N|url=http://www.osti.gov/accomplishments/documents/fullText/ACC0049.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Morrs"/&gt;

The sample was prepared as follows: first [[plutonium]] nitrate solution was coated on a [[platinum]] foil of about 0.5&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; area, the solution was evaporated and the residue was converted into [[plutonium(IV) oxide]] (PuO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) by [[annealing (metallurgy)|annealing]]. Following cyclotron irradiation of the oxide, the coating was dissolved with [[nitric acid]] and then precipitated as the hydroxide using concentrated aqueous [[ammonium hydroxide|ammonia solution]]. The residue was dissolved in [[perchloric acid]], and further separation was carried out by [[ion exchange]] to yield a certain isotope of curium. The separation of curium and americium was so painstaking that the Berkeley group initially called those elements ''[[wikt:pandemonium|pandemonium]]'' (from Greek for ''all demons'' or ''hell'') and ''[[wikt:delirium|delirium]]'' (from Latin for ''madness'').&lt;ref name=radio/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Krebs, Robert E. [https://books.google.com/books?id=yb9xTj72vNAC&amp;pg=PA322 The history and use of our earth's chemical elements: a reference guide], Greenwood Publishing Group, 2006, {{ISBN|0-313-33438-2}} p. 322&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|pandemonium}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|delirium}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The curium-242 isotope was produced in July–August 1944 by bombarding &lt;sup&gt;239&lt;/sup&gt;Pu with [[alpha radiation|α-particles]] to produce curium with the release of a [[neutron]]:
: &lt;chem&gt;^{239}_{94}Pu + ^{4}_{2}He -&gt; ^{242}_{96}Cm + ^{1}_{0}n&lt;/chem&gt;

Curium-242 was unambiguously identified by the characteristic energy of the α-particles emitted during the decay:
: &lt;chem&gt;^{242}_{96}Cm -&gt; ^{238}_{94}Pu + ^{4}_{2}He&lt;/chem&gt;
The [[half-life]] of this [[alpha decay]] was first measured as 150 days and then corrected to 162.8 days.&lt;ref name="nubase"/&gt;

Another isotope &lt;sup&gt;240&lt;/sup&gt;Cm was produced in a similar reaction in March 1945:
: &lt;chem&gt;^{239}_{94}Pu + ^{4}_{2}He -&gt; ^{240}_{96}Cm + 3^{1}_{0}n&lt;/chem&gt;
The half-life of the &lt;sup&gt;240&lt;/sup&gt;Cm α-decay was correctly determined as 26.7 days.&lt;ref name="nubase"/&gt;

The discovery of curium, as well as americium, in 1944 was closely related to the [[Manhattan Project]], so the results were confidential and declassified only in 1945. Seaborg leaked the synthesis of the elements 95 and 96 on the U.S. radio show for children, the [[Quiz Kids]], five days before the official presentation at an [[American Chemical Society]] meeting on November 11, 1945, when one of the listeners asked whether any new transuranium element beside plutonium and [[neptunium]] had been discovered during the war.&lt;ref name=radio&gt;{{cite web|url = http://pubs.acs.org/cen/80th/americium.html|title = Chemical &amp; Engineering News: It's Elemental: The Periodic Table – Americium|accessdate = 2008-12-07| first = Rachel Sheremeta|last = Pepling|date = 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discovery of curium (&lt;sup&gt;242&lt;/sup&gt;Cm and &lt;sup&gt;240&lt;/sup&gt;Cm), their production and compounds were later patented listing only Seaborg as the inventor.&lt;ref&gt;Seaborg, G. T. {{US patent|3161462}} "Element", Filing date: 7 February 1949, Issue date: December 1964&lt;/ref&gt;

{{double image|left|Marie Curie (Nobel-Chem).jpg|150|Curie-pierre.jpg|150|[[Marie Curie|Marie]] and [[Pierre Curie]]}}
The new element was named after [[Marie Curie|Marie Skłodowska-Curie]] and her husband [[Pierre Curie]] who are noted for discovering [[radium]] and for their work in [[radioactivity]]. It followed the example of [[gadolinium]], a [[lanthanide]] element above curium in the periodic table, which was named after the explorer of the [[rare earth element]]s [[Johan Gadolin]]:&lt;ref&gt;Greenwood, p. 1252&lt;/ref&gt;
::''"As the name for the element of atomic number 96 we should like to propose "curium", with symbol Cm. The evidence indicates that element 96 contains seven 5f electrons and is thus analogous to the element gadolinium with its seven 4f electrons in the regular rare earth series. On this base element 96 is named after the Curies in a manner analogous to the naming of gadolinium, in which the chemist Gadolin was honored."&lt;ref name="E96"/&gt;''

The first curium samples were barely visible, and were identified by their radioactivity. Louis Werner and [[Isadore Perlman]] created the first substantial sample of 30&amp;nbsp;µg curium-242 hydroxide at the University of California in 1947 by bombarding [[americium]]-241 with neutrons.&lt;ref name=CRC&gt;Hammond C.

A synthetic, radioactive element, curium is a hard, dense metal with a silvery-white appearance and physical and chemical properties resembling those of [[gadolinium]]. Its melting point of 1340&amp;nbsp;°C is significantly higher than that of the previous transuranic elements neptunium (637&amp;nbsp;°C), plutonium (639&amp;nbsp;°C) and americium (1173&amp;nbsp;°C). In comparison, gadolinium melts at 1312&amp;nbsp;°C. The boiling point of curium is 3110&amp;nbsp;°C. With a density of 13.52&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, curium is significantly lighter than neptunium (20.45&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) and plutonium (19.8&amp;nbsp;g/cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), but is heavier than most other metals. Between two crystalline forms of curium, the α-Cm is more stable at ambient conditions. It has a hexagonal symmetry, [[space group]] P6&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;/mmc, lattice parameters ''a'' = 365 [[picometer|pm]] and ''c'' = 1182 pm, and four [[formula unit]]s per [[unit cell]].&lt;ref name="Milman"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Milman|first1=V.|title=Crystal structures of curium compounds: an ab initio study|journal=Journal of Nuclear Materials|volume=322|issue=2–3|page=165|date=2003|doi=10.1016/S0022-3115(03)00321-0|bibcode=2003JNuM..322..165M|last2=Winkler|first2=B.|last3=Pickard|first3=C.

At pressures above 23 [[Pascal (unit)|GPa]], at room temperature, α-Cm transforms into β-Cm, which has a [[Cubic crystal system|face-centered cubic]] symmetry, space group Fm{{overline|3}}m and the lattice constant ''a'' = 493 pm.&lt;ref name = "Milman"/&gt; Upon further compression to 43 GPa, curium transforms to an [[Orthorhombic crystal system|orthorhombic]] γ-Cm structure similar to that of α-uranium, with no further transitions observed up to 52 GPa.

Curium has peculiar magnetic properties. Whereas its neighbor element americium shows no deviation from [[Curie–Weiss law|Curie-Weiss]] [[paramagnetism]] in the entire temperature range, α-Cm transforms to an [[Antiferromagnetism|antiferromagnetic]] state upon cooling to 65–52 K,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kanellakopulos|first1=B.|title=The magnetic susceptibility of Americium and curium metal|journal=Solid State Communications|volume=17|issue=6|page=713|date=1975|doi=10.1016/0038-1098(75)90392-0|bibcode = 1975SSCom..17..713K|last2=Blaise|first2=A.|last3=Fournier|first3=J.

The lanthanide analogue of curium, gadolinium, as well as its pnictides, also show magnetic transitions upon cooling, but the transition character is somewhat different: Gd and GdN become ferromagnetic, and GdP, GdAs and GdSb show antiferromagnetic ordering.&lt;ref&gt;Nave, S.

In accordance with magnetic data, electrical resistivity of curium increases with temperature – about twice between 4 and 60 K – and then remains nearly constant up to room temperature. There is a significant increase in resistivity over time (about 10 µΩ·cm/h) due to self-damage of the crystal lattice by alpha radiation. This makes uncertain the absolute resistivity value for curium (about 125 µΩ·cm). The resistivity of curium is similar to that of gadolinium and of the actinides plutonium and neptunium, but is significantly higher than that of americium, uranium, [[polonium]] and [[thorium]].&lt;ref name=res/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schenkel|first1=R.|title=The electrical resistivity of 244Cm metal|journal=Solid State Communications|volume=23|issue=6|page=389|date=1977|doi=10.1016/0038-1098(77)90239-3|bibcode = 1977SSCom..23..389S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

About 20 [[Radionuclide|radioisotopes]] and 7 [[nuclear isomer]]s between &lt;sup&gt;233&lt;/sup&gt;Cm and &lt;sup&gt;252&lt;/sup&gt;Cm are known for curium, and no stable [[isotope]]s. The longest half-lives have been reported for &lt;sup&gt;247&lt;/sup&gt;Cm (15.6 million years) and &lt;sup&gt;248&lt;/sup&gt;Cm (348,000 years). Other long-lived isotopes are &lt;sup&gt;245&lt;/sup&gt;Cm (half-life 8500 years), &lt;sup&gt;250&lt;/sup&gt;Cm (8,300 years) and &lt;sup&gt;246&lt;/sup&gt;Cm (4,760 years). Curium-250 is unusual in that it predominantly (about 86%) decays via [[spontaneous fission]]. The most commonly used curium isotopes are &lt;sup&gt;242&lt;/sup&gt;Cm and &lt;sup&gt;244&lt;/sup&gt;Cm with the half-lives of 162.8 days and 18.1 years, respectively.&lt;ref name="nubase"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Audi |first1=G. |doi=10.1016/S0375-9474(97)00482-X |title=The N? evaluation of nuclear and decay properties |date=1997 |page=1 |issue=1 |volume=624 |journal=Nuclear Physics A |url=http://www.nndc.bnl.gov/amdc/nubase/Nubase2003.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080923135135/http://www.nndc.bnl.gov/amdc/nubase/Nubase2003.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-09-23 |bibcode=1997NuPhA.624....1A |last2=Bersillon |first2=O. |last3=Blachot |first3=J. |last4=Wapstra |first4=A.

All isotopes between &lt;sup&gt;242&lt;/sup&gt;Cm and &lt;sup&gt;248&lt;/sup&gt;Cm, as well as &lt;sup&gt;250&lt;/sup&gt;Cm, undergo a self-sustaining [[nuclear chain reaction]] and thus in principle can act as a [[nuclear fuel]] in a reactor. As in most transuranic elements, the [[nuclear fission]] cross section is especially high for the odd-mass curium isotopes &lt;sup&gt;243&lt;/sup&gt;Cm, &lt;sup&gt;245&lt;/sup&gt;Cm and &lt;sup&gt;247&lt;/sup&gt;Cm. These can be used in [[thermal-neutron reactor]]s, whereas a mixture of curium isotopes is only suitable for [[fast breeder reactor]]s since the even-mass isotopes are not fissile in a thermal reactor and accumulate as burn-up increases.&lt;ref name="irsn"&gt;Institut de Radioprotection et de Sûreté Nucléaire: [http://ec.europa.eu/energy/nuclear/transport/doc/irsn_sect03_146.pdf "Evaluation of nuclear criticality safety. data and limits for actinides in transport"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519171204/http://ec.europa.eu/energy/nuclear/transport/doc/irsn_sect03_146.pdf |date=May 19, 2011 }}, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; The mixed-oxide (MOX) fuel, which is to be used in power reactors, should contain little or no curium because the [[neutron activation]] of &lt;sup&gt;248&lt;/sup&gt;Cm will create [[californium]]. Californium is a strong [[neutron]] emitter, and would pollute the back end of the fuel cycle and increase the dose to reactor personnel. Hence, if the [[minor actinides]] are to be used as fuel in a thermal neutron reactor, the curium should be excluded from the fuel or placed in special fuel rods where it is the only actinide present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=National Research Council (U.S.).

The adjacent table lists the [[critical mass]]es for curium isotopes for a sphere, without a moderator and reflector. With a metal reflector (30&amp;nbsp;cm of steel), the critical masses of the odd isotopes are about 3–4&amp;nbsp;kg. When using water (thickness ~20–30&amp;nbsp;cm) as the reflector, the critical mass can be as small as 59&amp;nbsp;gram for &lt;sup&gt;245&lt;/sup&gt;Cm, 155&amp;nbsp;gram for &lt;sup&gt;243&lt;/sup&gt;Cm and 1550&amp;nbsp;gram for &lt;sup&gt;247&lt;/sup&gt;Cm. There is a significant uncertainty in these critical mass values. Whereas it is usually on the order of 20%, the values for &lt;sup&gt;242&lt;/sup&gt;Cm and &lt;sup&gt;246&lt;/sup&gt;Cm were listed as large as 371&amp;nbsp;kg and 70.1&amp;nbsp;kg, respectively, by some research groups.&lt;ref name="irsn"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Okundo, H.|author2=Kawasaki, H.|last-author-amp=yes  |title=Critical and Subcritical Mass Calculations of Curium-243 to −247 Based on JENDL-3.2 for Revision of ANSI/ANS-8.15|journal=Journal of Nuclear Science and Technology|date=2002|volume=39|pages=1072–1085|doi=10.3327/jnst.39.1072|issue=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, curium is not used as a nuclear fuel owing to its low availability and high price.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bundesrecht.juris.de/atg/__2.html § 2 Begriffsbestimmungen (Atomic Energy Act)] (in German)&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;sup&gt;245&lt;/sup&gt;Cm and &lt;sup&gt;247&lt;/sup&gt;Cm have a very small critical mass and therefore could be used in portable [[nuclear weapon]]s, but none have been reported thus far. Curium-243 is not suitable for this purpose because of its short half-life and strong α emission which would result in excessive heat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jukka Lehto|author2=Xiaolin Hou|title=Chemistry and Analysis of Radionuclides: Laboratory Techniques and Methodology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v2iRJaO3SMIC&amp;pg=PA303|accessdate=19 April 2011|date=2 February 2011|publisher=Wiley-VCH|isbn=978-3-527-32658-7|pages=303–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Curium-247 would be highly suitable, having a half-life 647 times that of plutonium-239.

===Occurrence===
[[File:Ivy Mike - mushroom cloud.jpg|thumb|Several isotopes of curium were detected in the fallout from the ''Ivy Mike'' nuclear test.]]
The longest-lived isotope of curium, &lt;sup&gt;247&lt;/sup&gt;Cm, has a half-life of 15.6 million years. Therefore, any [[primordial nuclide|primordial]] curium, that is curium present on the Earth during its formation, should have decayed by now, although some of it would be detectable as an [[extinct radionuclide]] as an excess of its nearly stable daughter &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U. Curium is produced artificially, in small quantities for research purposes. Furthermore, it occurs in spent [[nuclear fuel]]. Curium is present in nature in certain areas used for the atmospheric [[nuclear weapons testing|nuclear weapons tests]], which were conducted between 1945 and 1980.&lt;ref name="lenntech"&gt;[http://www.lenntech.de/pse/pse.htm Curium] (in German)&lt;/ref&gt; So the analysis of the debris at the testing site of the first U.S. [[hydrogen bomb]], [[Ivy Mike]], (1 November 1952, [[Enewetak Atoll]]), beside [[einsteinium]], [[fermium]], [[plutonium]] and [[americium]] also revealed isotopes of berkelium, californium and curium, in particular &lt;sup&gt;245&lt;/sup&gt;Cm, &lt;sup&gt;246&lt;/sup&gt;Cm and smaller quantities of &lt;sup&gt;247&lt;/sup&gt;Cm, &lt;sup&gt;248&lt;/sup&gt;Cm and &lt;sup&gt;249&lt;/sup&gt;Cm. For reasons of military secrecy, this result was published only in 1956.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fields|first1=P. R.|last2=Studier|first2=M. H.|last3=Diamond|first3=H.|last4=Mech|first4=J.

Atmospheric curium compounds are poorly soluble in common solvents and mostly adhere to soil particles. Soil analysis revealed about 4,000 times higher concentration of curium at the sandy soil particles than in water present in the soil pores. An even higher ratio of about 18,000 was measured in [[loam]] soils.&lt;ref name=LA2/&gt;

Curium is produced in small quantities in [[nuclear reactor]]s, and by now only kilograms of it have been accumulated for the &lt;sup&gt;242&lt;/sup&gt;Cm and &lt;sup&gt;244&lt;/sup&gt;Cm and grams or even milligrams for heavier isotopes. This explains the high price of curium, which has been quoted at 160–185 [[United States dollar|USD]] per milligram,&lt;ref name=CRC/&gt; with a more recent estimate at 2,000 USD/g for &lt;sup&gt;242&lt;/sup&gt;Cm and 170 USD/g for &lt;sup&gt;244&lt;/sup&gt;Cm.&lt;ref name=lect/&gt; In nuclear reactors, curium is formed from &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;U in a series of nuclear reactions. In the first chain, &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;U captures a neutron and converts into &lt;sup&gt;239&lt;/sup&gt;U, which via [[beta decay|β&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; decay]] transforms into &lt;sup&gt;239&lt;/sup&gt;Np and &lt;sup&gt;239&lt;/sup&gt;Pu.

Further neutron capture followed by β&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;-decay produces the &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am isotope of [[americium]] which further converts into &lt;sup&gt;242&lt;/sup&gt;Cm:

For research purposes, curium is obtained by irradiating not uranium but plutonium, which is available in large amounts from spent nuclear fuel. A much higher neutron flux is used for the irradiation that results in a different reaction chain and formation of &lt;sup&gt;244&lt;/sup&gt;Cm:&lt;ref name = "Morrs"&gt;Morss, L. R.; Edelstein, N.

Curium-244 decays into &lt;sup&gt;240&lt;/sup&gt;Pu by emission of alpha particle, but it also absorbs neutrons resulting in a small amount of heavier curium isotopes. Among those, &lt;sup&gt;247&lt;/sup&gt;Cm and &lt;sup&gt;248&lt;/sup&gt;Cm are popular in scientific research because of their long half-lives. However, the production rate of &lt;sup&gt;247&lt;/sup&gt;Cm in thermal neutron reactors is relatively low because of it is prone to undergo fission induced by thermal neutrons.&lt;ref name=haire/&gt; Synthesis of &lt;sup&gt;250&lt;/sup&gt;Cm via [[neutron absorption]] is also rather unlikely because of the short half-life of the intermediate product &lt;sup&gt;249&lt;/sup&gt;Cm (64 min), which converts by β&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; decay to the [[berkelium]] isotope &lt;sup&gt;249&lt;/sup&gt;Bk.&lt;ref name=haire/&gt;
&lt;!-- Curium-250 is obtained instead from the α-decay of &lt;sup&gt;254&lt;/sup&gt;Cf. For this however, the production rate is low as &lt;sup&gt;254&lt;/sup&gt;Cf decays mainly by spontaneous fission, and only slightly by emission of α-particles into &lt;sup&gt;250&lt;/sup&gt;Cm.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}} --&gt;

The above cascade of (\ce n,γ) reactions produces a mixture of different curium isotopes. Their post-synthesis separation is cumbersome, and therefore a selective synthesis is desired. Curium-248 is favored for research purposes because of its long half-life. The most efficient preparation method of this isotope is via α-decay of the [[californium]] isotope &lt;sup&gt;252&lt;/sup&gt;Cf, which is available in relatively large quantities due to its long half-life (2.65 years). About 35–50&amp;nbsp;mg of &lt;sup&gt;248&lt;/sup&gt;Cm is being produced by this method every year. The associated reaction produces &lt;sup&gt;248&lt;/sup&gt;Cm with isotopic purity of 97%.&lt;ref name=haire&gt;{{cite book

Another interesting for research isotope &lt;sup&gt;245&lt;/sup&gt;Cm can be obtained from the α-decay of &lt;sup&gt;249&lt;/sup&gt;Cf, and the latter isotope is produced in minute quantities from the β&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;-decay of the [[berkelium]] isotope &lt;sup&gt;249&lt;/sup&gt;Bk.

Most synthesis routines yield a mixture of different actinide isotopes as [[oxide]]s, from which a certain isotope of curium needs to be separated. An example procedure could be to dissolve spent reactor fuel (e.g. [[MOX fuel]]) in [[nitric acid]], and remove the bulk of the uranium and plutonium using a [[PUREX]] ('''P'''lutonium – '''UR'''anium '''EX'''traction) type extraction with [[tributyl phosphate]] in a hydrocarbon. The lanthanides and the remaining actinides are then separated from the aqueous residue ([[raffinate]]) by a diamide-based extraction to give, after stripping, a mixture of trivalent actinides and lanthanides. A curium compound is then selectively extracted using multi-step [[chromatographic]] and centrifugation techniques with an appropriate reagent.&lt;ref&gt;Penneman, pp. 34–48&lt;/ref&gt; [[BTBP|''Bis''-triazinyl bipyridine]] complex has been recently proposed as such reagent which is highly selective to curium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author = Magnusson D|author2 = Christiansen B|author3 = Foreman MRS|author4 = Geist A|author5 = Glatz JP|author6 = Malmbeck R|author7 = Modolo G|author8 = Serrano-Purroy D|author9 = Sorel C|last-author-amp = yes|journal = Solvent Extraction and Ion Exchange|date = 2009|volume = 27|issue = 2|page = 97|doi = 10.1080/07366290802672204|title = Demonstration of a SANEX Process in [[centrifugal extractor|Centrifugal Contactors]] using the CyMe4-BTBP Molecule on a Genuine Fuel Solution}}&lt;/ref&gt; Separation of curium from a very similar americium can also be achieved by treating a slurry of their hydroxides in aqueous [[sodium bicarbonate]] with [[ozone]] at elevated temperature. Both americium and curium are present in solutions mostly in the +3 valence state; whereas americium oxidizes to soluble Am(IV) complexes, curium remains unchanged and can thus be isolated by repeated centrifugation.&lt;ref&gt;Penneman, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

Metallic curium is obtained by [[Redox|reduction]] of its compounds. Initially, curium(III) fluoride was used for this purpose. The reaction was conducted in the environment free from water and oxygen, in the apparatus made of [[tantalum]] and [[tungsten]], using elemental [[barium]] or [[lithium]] as reducing agents.&lt;ref Name="Morrs"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "CM_METALL" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cunning"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cunningham|first1=B.

The colorless curium(III) fluoride (CmF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) can be produced by introducing fluoride ions into curium(III)-containing solutions.

==Applications==

===Radionuclides===
[[File:Curium self-glow radiation.jpg|thumb|right|The radiation from curium is so strong that the metal glows purple in the dark.]]
Curium is one of the most radioactive isolable elements. Its two most common isotopes &lt;sup&gt;242&lt;/sup&gt;Cm and &lt;sup&gt;244&lt;/sup&gt;Cm are strong alpha emitters (energy 6&amp;nbsp;MeV); they have relatively short half-lives of 162.8 days and 18.1 years, and produce as much as 120 W/g and 3 W/g of thermal energy, respectively.&lt;ref name=CRC/&gt;&lt;ref name="Binder"&gt;Binder, Harry H.: ''Lexikon der chemischen Elemente'', S. Hirzel Verlag, Stuttgart 1999, {{ISBN|3-7776-0736-3}}, pp.&amp;nbsp;174–178.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Gmelin Handbook of Inorganic Chemistry'', System No. 71, Volume 7a, transuranics, Part A2, p. 289&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, curium can be used in its common oxide form in [[radioisotope thermoelectric generator]]s like those in spacecraft. This application has been studied for the &lt;sup&gt;244&lt;/sup&gt;Cm isotope, while &lt;sup&gt;242&lt;/sup&gt;Cm was abandoned due to its prohibitive price of around 2000 USD/g. &lt;sup&gt;243&lt;/sup&gt;Cm with a ~30 year half-life and good energy yield of ~1.6 W/g could make a suitable fuel, but it produces significant amounts of harmful [[Gamma ray|gamma]] and [[Beta ray|beta]] radiation from radioactive decay products. Though as an α-emitter, &lt;sup&gt;244&lt;/sup&gt;Cm requires a much thinner radiation protection shielding, it has a high spontaneous fission rate, and thus the neutron and gamma radiation rate are relatively strong. As compared to a competing thermoelectric generator isotope such as &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;Pu, &lt;sup&gt;244&lt;/sup&gt;Cm emits a 500-fold greater fluence of neutrons, and its higher gamma emission requires a shield that is 20 times thicker — about 2&amp;nbsp;inches of lead for a 1&amp;nbsp;kW source, as compared to 0.1 in for &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;Pu. Therefore, this application of curium is currently considered impractical.&lt;ref name=lect&gt;[http://fti.neep.wisc.edu/neep602/SPRING00/lecture5.pdf Basic elements of static RTGs], G.L. Kulcinski, NEEP 602 Course Notes (Spring 2000), Nuclear Power in Space, University of Wisconsin Fusion Technology Institute (see last page)&lt;/ref&gt;

A more promising application of &lt;sup&gt;242&lt;/sup&gt;Cm is to produce &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;Pu, a more suitable radioisotope for thermoelectric generators such as in cardiac pacemakers. The alternative routes to &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;Pu use the (n,γ) reaction of &lt;sup&gt;237&lt;/sup&gt;Np, or the [[deuteron]] bombardment of uranium, which both always produce &lt;sup&gt;236&lt;/sup&gt;Pu as an undesired by-product — since the latter decays to &lt;sup&gt;232&lt;/sup&gt;U with strong gamma emission.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kronenberg.kernchemie.de/ Kronenberg, Andreas], [http://www.kernenergie-wissen.de/pu-batterien.html Plutonium-Batterien] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131226011403/http://www.kernenergie-wissen.de/pu-batterien.html |date=2013-12-26 }} (in German)

The most practical application of &lt;sup&gt;244&lt;/sup&gt;Cm — though rather limited in total volume — is as α-particle source in the [[alpha particle X-ray spectrometer]]s (APXS).

An elaborated APXS setup is equipped with a sensor head containing six curium sources having the total radioactive decay rate of several tens of [[curie|millicuries]] (roughly a [[Becquerel|gigabecquerel]]). The sources are collimated on the sample, and the energy spectra of the alpha particles and protons scattered from the sample are analyzed (the proton analysis is implemented only in some spectrometers). These spectra contain quantitative information on all major elements in the samples except for hydrogen, helium and lithium.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060302040531/http://athena.cornell.edu/pdf/tb_apxs.pdf Alpha Particle X-Ray Spectrometer (APXS)], Cornell University&lt;/ref&gt;

==Safety==
Owing to its high radioactivity, curium and its compounds must be handled in appropriate laboratories under special arrangements. Whereas curium itself mostly emits α-particles which are absorbed by thin layers of common materials, some of its decay products emit significant fractions of beta and gamma radiation, which require a more elaborate protection.&lt;ref Name="lenntech"/&gt; If consumed, curium is excreted within a few days and only 0.05% is absorbed in the blood. From there, about 45% goes to the [[liver]], 45% to the bones, and the remaining 10% is excreted. In the bone, curium accumulates on the inside of the interfaces to the [[bone marrow]] and does not significantly redistribute with time; its radiation destroys [[bone marrow]] and thus stops [[red blood cell]] creation. The [[biological half-life]] of curium is about 20 years in the liver and 50 years in the bones.&lt;ref Name="lenntech"/&gt;&lt;ref name=LA2/&gt; Curium is absorbed in the body much more strongly via inhalation, and the allowed total dose of &lt;sup&gt;244&lt;/sup&gt;Cm in soluble form is 0.3 μ[[Curie (unit)|C]].&lt;ref name=CRC/&gt; Intravenous injection of &lt;sup&gt;242&lt;/sup&gt;Cm and &lt;sup&gt;244&lt;/sup&gt;Cm containing solutions to rats increased the incidence of [[bone tumor]], and inhalation promoted [[Lung|pulmonary]] and [[liver cancer]].&lt;ref name="lenntech"/&gt;

Curium isotopes are inevitably present in spent nuclear fuel with a concentration of about 20 g/tonne.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffmann, K. ''Kann man Gold machen? Gauner, Gaukler und Gelehrte. Aus der Geschichte der chemischen Elemente'' (Can you make gold? Crooks, clowns and scholars.

This procedure, [[nuclear transmutation]], while well documented for other elements, is still being developed for curium.&lt;ref name="denecke"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6971">A '''Dahlander motor ''' (also known as a '''pole changing motor''', dual- or two speed-motor) is a type of multispeed [[induction motor]], in which the speed of the motor is varied by altering the number of poles; this is achieved by altering the wiring connections inside the motor. The motor may have fixed or variable [[torque]] depending on the [[Stator|stator winding]]. It is named after its inventor Robert Dahlander (1870–1935).&lt;ref&gt;{{patent|US|725415}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lexikon"&gt;{{cite book |title=Lexikon der Elektrotechniker|last1=Heilbronner |first1=Friedrich |last2=Jäger |first2=Kurt |edition=2 |year=2010|publisher=VDE-Verlag |location=Germany |language=DE |isbn=978-3-8007-2903-6  |page=93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Invention==
[[File:Robert Dahlander.jpg|thumb|80px|Robert Dahlander]]
Robert Dahlander, a [[Sweden|Swedish]] engineer working for [[Allmänna Svenska Elektriska Aktiebolaget|ASEA]],&lt;ref name="swedish online dictiornary"&gt;{{cite web  |title=Robert Dahlander |url=http://sok.riksarkivet.se/sbl/Presentation.aspx?id=15785 |work=Dictionary of Swedish National Biography  |publisher=Riksarkivet (National Archives of Sweden |language=Swedish |accessdate=12 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; discovered that switching the poles in a motor led to a reduction in the speed of the motor. In 1897 he invented an electrical configuration to switch between poles in a motor for which he was granted a patent along with his co-worker Karl Arvid Lindstroem. The new connection was named the "Dahlander connection" and a motor having such a configuration is commonly referred to as a "pole changing motor" or a "Dahlander motor".&lt;ref&gt;{{patent|US|725415}}, {{patent|CH|14112}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{patent|DE|98417}}''Arrangement for obtaining two different pole numbers for asynchronous AC motors'', 11 February 1897&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operation==
[[File:Dahlander.svg|thumb|Dahlander motor wiring for low speed ([[Delta connection]]) and high speed (double [[Y-Δ transform|star connection]])]]
The Dahlander motor is based on a 'consequent pole' connection. The primary factor in determining the speed of an induction motor is the number of poles, given by the formula
:&lt;math&gt;n_s={120\times{f}\over{p}}&lt;/math&gt; (RPM),
where
:''n&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'' = Synchronous speed, in revolutions per minute
:''f'' = AC power frequency
:''p'' = Number of poles per phase winding&lt;ref name=MDEMRC&gt;{{cite web |url=http://machinedesign.com/motorsdrives/difference-between-ac-induction-permanent-magnet-and-servomotor-technologies |last=Eitel |first=Elisabeth |title=The difference between AC induction, permanent magnet, and servomotor technologies |publisher=Machine Design |date=1 April 2012 |accessdate=21 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
A regular induction motor has an equal number of opposite poles; that is, at any instant, there are an equal number of North and South magnetic poles. Some smaller induction motors are connected so that all the poles are identical, causing the motor to act as though there is an equal number of opposite poles in between.

A Dahlander motor achieves different speeds by switching the configuration of the electrical windings, indirectly adding or removing poles and thus varying the rotor speed. The poles can be varied at a ratio of 1:2 and thus the speed can be varied at 2:1.&lt;ref name="Steuerungstechnik"/&gt;&lt;ref name=drive&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4I-5ETTWvu0C&amp;pg=PA48|title=Electric Drive: Design Methodology|first=Marcel|last=Jufer|year=2013|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=111862159X|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Toliyat&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4-Kkj53fWTIC&amp;pg=PA234|title=Handbook of Electric Motors|editor1-first=Hamid A. |editor1-last=Toliyat|editor2-first=Gerald B. |editor2-last=Kliman|year=2004|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=1420030388|edition=2nd|pages=234–235}}&lt;/ref&gt; Normally, the electrical configuration of windings is varied from a [[Delta connection]] (Δ) to a double star connection (YY) configuration in order to change the speed of the motor for constant [[torque]] applications, such as the hoists in [[Crane (machine)|cranes]].&lt;ref name="Steuerungstechnik"/&gt;&lt;ref name=drive/&gt; Star connections ([[Delta connection|Y]]) varied to double star connections (YY) are used for quadratic torque applications, such as [[pump]]s.&lt;ref name="Steuerungstechnik"&gt;{{cite book |title=Die Meisterprüfung Elektrische Maschinen und Steuerungstechnik|last1=Boy |first1=Günter |last2=Flachmann |first2=Horst |edition=4 |year=1983|publisher= Vogel-Verlag |location=Wurzburg, Germany |language=DE |isbn=3-8023-0725-9  |page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages and disadvantages==
Dahlander motors have advantages compared to other speed control systems like [[variable frequency drive]]s, as there is less power loss. This is because most of the power is used to drive the motor and no electrical pulse switching is done. The system is much simpler and easier to use compared to other speed control methods available. However, the Dahlander motor has the disadvantage of fast mechanical wear and tear due to changing speeds in such a drastic ratio; this type of connection also produces high [[harmonic distortion]] during the shifting of poles as the angular distance between the power generated increases as the poles are decreased in the motor.&lt;ref name=Toliyat/&gt;

==Application==
Pole changing motors are normally used in applications where two speed controls are necessary.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4677">'''Disordered hyperuniformity''' is a type of [[liquid]] which has [[crystal]] properties. It greatly suppresses variations in the [[density]] of [[particles]], like a crystal, and the particles have the same physical properties in all directions at shorter distances, like a liquid. It was discovered in the [[eyes]] of [[chickens]]. This is thought to be the case because chicken eyes cannot support the ordered, complex system best for eyesight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://gizmodo.com/disordered-hyperuniformity-a-weird-new-state-of-matter-1548659862|title=Disordered Hyperuniformity: A Weird New State of Matter in Chicken Eyes|author=

Unique optical properties have been uncovered in dense hyperuniform materials, wherein light of a wavelength specific to the material is able to propagate forward despite high particle density due to microscopic order.  The uniformly spaced particles scatter light as it propagates through the material, but most of the scattering self-interferes except that in the direction of propagation.  In conditions where light is propagated through an uncorrelated disordered material of the same density, the material would appear opaque due to multiple scattering.  Such materials can be theoretically designed for light of any wavelength, and the applications of the concept cover a wide variety of fields of wave physics and materials engineering.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.osapublishing.org/optica/abstract.cfm?uri=optica-3-7-763&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''hyperuniformity'' was coined by chemist and [[packing problems|packing]] expert [[Salvatore Torquato]], co-author of a pioneering 2003 paper on the topic.&lt;ref name="PRE-68"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Torquato|first1=Salvatore|last2=Stillinger|first2=Frank H.|title=Local density fluctuations, hyperuniformity, and order metrics|journal=Physical Review E|date=Oct 29, 2003|volume=68|page=041113|doi=10.1103/PhysRevE.68.041113|url=http://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.68.041113|accessdate=13 July 2016|publisher=American Physical Society|arxiv=cond-mat/0311532|bibcode=2003PhRvE..68d1113T}}&lt;/ref&gt; Torquato says that another example of this ordering is that found in a shaken box of marbles, which fall into an arrangement, called ''maximally random jammed packing''. Two classes of hyperuniformity include equilibrium systems - such as [[quasicrystal]]s - and non-equilibrium systems, which include shaken marbles, emulsions, colloids and ensembles of cold atoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wolchover|first1=Natalie|title=A Bird’s-Eye View of Nature’s Hidden Order|url=https://www.quantamagazine.org/20160712-hyperuniformity-found-in-birds-math-and-physics/|website=Quanta Magazine|publisher=Simons Foundation|accessdate=13 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It's also thought to emerge on the mysterious biological patterns known as [[fairy circle (arid grass formation)|fairy circles]] - circle and patterns of circles that emerge in arid places.&lt;ref&gt;Press article on ''[[The Washington Post]]'' [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2017/01/18/the-astonishing-science-behind-namibias-mysterious-fairy-circles/ Dragons, aliens, bugs?

A '''double sunset''' is a rare astro-geographical phenomenon, in which the sun appears to set twice in the same evening from a specific viewing-point. Such phenomena may have been regarded as significant in prehistoric times, and double sunsets have been discussed in the context of [[archaeoastronomy]] by researchers such as [[Alexander Thom]].&lt;ref name="Thom"/&gt;

==England==
[[File:BosleyCloud.jpg|thumb|[[The Cloud (Peak District)|Bosley Cloud]]]]

===Staffordshire===
A well-documented example of a double or occulted sunset is associated with [[Leek, Staffordshire|Leek]], [[Staffordshire]], England. The phenomenon is viewable from the town on and around the [[summer solstice]] in good weather.{{sfn|Kent|2001|pages=1, 3, 4}}&lt;ref&gt;''Staffordshire Tales of Mystery &amp; Murder'', pages 26 and 28–30, David Bell, Countryside Books, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DVD notes| url=http://www.megalithic.co.uk/shop/prehistory_of_the_peak_district.htm |title=The Prehistory of the Peak District |first=Byron |last=Machin |date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first published mention of the Leek double sunset was made in 1686 by Dr [[Robert Plot]] in his book ''The Natural History Of Stafford-Shire''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Natural History Of Stafford-shire'', pages 2–3, Robert Plot LL.D., Oxford The Theatre, 1686.&lt;/ref&gt; The phenomenon would have been visible well before the seventeenth century. However, the alignment of sun and landscape is subject to change over the centuries as it is affected by the Earth's [[axial precession]]. This was realised by Plot who suggested that the sunset could be used to measure the [[obliquity of the ecliptic]].&lt;ref name="KK"&gt;{{Citation|title=Dr Plot and the amazing double sunset|first=Kevin J.|last=Kilburn|journal=[[Astronomy &amp; Geophysics]]|volume=40|issue=1|year=1999|pages=1.20–1.22|doi=10.1093/astrog/40.1.1.20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
(see note{{ref|a|1}})

The traditional location for observing the phenomenon, as described by Plot, is the churchyard belonging to the [[St Edward the Confessor's Church, Leek|parish church of St Edward the Confessor]]. The church is a medieval building, and it has been conjectured that the churchyard is an example of an ancient sacred site having been [[Christianized sites|Christianised]]. Because of the chronology of the changing alignment, it seems that the site could not have been a viewing-point for the double sunset before the [[European Iron Age|Iron Age]]. The first people to view the phenomenon may have been the area's Iron Age inhabitants.&lt;ref name="KK"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
It has been argued by [[Jeff Kent (author)|Jeff Kent]] that the first people to witness the spectacle may have been Danish settlers from the [[Great Heathen Army]], which invaded England in the ninth century.{{sfn|Kent|2001|pages=29-32}} 

From a particular point in the churchyard, the whole of the sun set on the summit of [[The Cloud (Peak District)|Bosley Cloud]], a [[millstone grit]] hill six miles to the northwest. The sun partially reappeared from The Cloud's steep northern slope and soon afterwards set for a second and final time on the horizon.{{sfn|Kent|2001|pages=3–4}} The spectacle was last reliably witnessed, and filmed, from the churchyard in 1977,&lt;ref&gt;''Evening Sentinel'', 22 June 1977, page 11.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Kent|2001|pages=53, 66–69, 74}} but is no longer visible from the location because of tree interference.&lt;ref&gt;''Leek Post &amp; Times'', 19 June 1996, page 2.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Kent|2001|pages=53, 74, 80–81}} It is, however, still observable from Leek on and around the summer solstice from the road to Pickwood Hall, off Milltown Way,{{sfn|Kent|2001|page=125}} and from Lowe Hill on the outskirts of the town.{{sfn|Kent|2001|pages=124–126}} Better viewing points, though, are from the A 523, above [[Rudyard Lake]],{{sfn|Kent|2001|page=154}} and Woodhouse Green,{{sfn|Kent|2001|page=168}} both of which are nearer to The Cloud and therefore enable a larger proportion of the sun to reappear.

===Derbyshire===
Further double sunsets were identified by Jeff Kent in 1997 from three places in west [[Derbyshire]], observed against [[Chrome Hill]], [[Parkhouse Hill]] and [[Thorpe Cloud]] (three [[limestone]] [[reef knoll]]s):{{sfn|Kent|2001|pages=101, 102, 103–104, 106, 111}}
*Chrome Hill. Observed from Glutton Bridge for a short period around the summer solstice. The sun sets just to the southwest of the summit of the hill, begins to re-emerge almost immediately afterwards from its steep northeastern slope before fully reappearing and later sets for a second and final time at the foot of the hill.{{sfn|Kent|2001|pages=102, 110, 111, 113–114, 200}}
*Parkhouse Hill. Visible from nearby Glutton Grange in late March, early April and September. The sun sets just to the south of the summit of the hill, begins to re-emerge almost immediately afterwards from its steep northern slope before fully reappearing and later sets for a second and final time at the foot of the hill.{{sfn|Kent|2001|pages=103–104, 106, 201, 202}}
*Thorpe Cloud. Viewed from the top of nearby Lin Dale on and around the summer solstice and perhaps beyond. The sun sets on the summit of the hill, partially reappears from its steep northern slope and sets for a second and final time shortly afterwards.{{sfn|Kent|2001|pages=101, 113}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whitestuff.com/julia-bradbury-secret-walks/ Julia Bradbury's Secret Walks]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scotland==
In the 1950s Alexander Thom surveyed a [[megalithic]] site at Kintraw, a locality on the mainland of Scotland, in the context of a double sunset on the island of [[Jura, Scotland|Jura]] (both the island and the mainland site are in [[Argyll and Bute]]).&lt;ref name="Thom"&gt;Thom, A (1954) “The solar observatories of Megalithic man.” [[Journal of the British Astronomical Association|Journ. Brit. Astron. Assoc.]] 64, pp. 397-00.&lt;/ref&gt; The proposed alignment is to a notch at a distance of 28 miles between the mountains of [[Beinn Shiantaidh]] and [[Beinn a' Chaolais]] which are visible from Kintraw.&lt;ref name="megalithic"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=35469 |title=Kintraw hill platform |website=www.megalithic.co.uk |access-date=2017-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Kintraw standing stone, Argyll. - geograph.org.uk - 65878.jpg|thumb|The 4 metre high [[Menhir|standing stone]] at Kintraw.]]
Thom described the site as a type of midwinter observatory, but his interpretation has been the subject of controversy, one point at issue being the visibility of the midwinter notch: a higher observation point is needed to see the midwinter notch on Jura over a nearby ridge.
Euan MacKie, recognising that Thom's theories needed to be tested, excavated at the site in 1970 and 1971, and found evidence for an observation platform.&lt;ref&gt;Euan W. MacKie.

'''Fereydoon Abbasi-Davani''' ({{lang-fa|فریدون عباسی دوانی}}; born 11 July 1958) is an Iranian nuclear scientist who was head of [[Atomic Energy Organization of Iran|Atomic Energy Organization]] from 2011 to 2013. He survived an assassination attempt in 2010, but was seriously wounded.

==Early life and education==
Abbasi was born in [[Kazerun]], [[Iran]], on 11 July 1958.&lt;ref name=aljaz1&gt;[http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2010/11/201011297228879910.html "Iranian 'nuclear scientist' killed"], ''Al Jazeera'', 29 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Mashregh News]], an Iranian news website, he holds a PhD in [[nuclear physics]].&lt;ref name=aljaz1/&gt;

==Career==
Abbasi was a professor of nuclear physics at [[Shahid Beheshti University]] and has reportedly been a member of Iran's [[Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps]] (IRGC) since the [[1979 Islamic Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Survivor of Attack Leads Nuclear Effort in Iran|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/23/world/middleeast/23iran.html?pagewanted=all|accessdate=17 August 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=23 July 2011|author=David E. Sanger|author2=William J. Broad}}&lt;/ref&gt; He reportedly did nuclear research at the [[Atomic Energy Organization of Iran]] (AEOI). Prior to his appointment as head of the AEOI he chaired the physics department at [[Tehran]]'s [[Imam Hossein University]].&lt;ref name=isis&gt;[http://isis-online.org/isis-reports/detail/will-fereydoun-abbasi-davani-lead-iran-to-nuclear-weapons ISIS online report on Abbasi, 24 June 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

Abbasi was appointed head of AEOI by then [[President of Iran|President]] [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]] on 13 February 2011 to succeed [[Ali Akbar Salehi]]. In his tenure the AEOI was unwilling to cooperate with the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA). In fact in May 2011 Fereydoon Abbasi was the recipient of a letter from the IAEA, where its Director General Yukiya Amano reiterated the agency's concerns about the "existence of a possible military dimension" to Iran's nuclear programme and stressed the importance of clarifying these issues, requesting prompt access to relevant locations, equipment, documentation and persons. In June 2011 Abbasi replayed evasively, so much so that the IAEA Director could only repeat his request for credible assurances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Sasha Henriques |date=6 June 2011 |title=June Board of Governors Meeting Convenes - Islamic Republic of Iran |website=IAEA |url=https://www.iaea.org/newscenter/news/june-board-governors-meeting-convenes |accessdate=2018-01-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Abbasi was removed from office on 16 August 2013 and Salehi replaced him in the post.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Iran Parliament approves big Rouhani cabinet nominees, rejects 3|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/Default.aspx?pageID=238&amp;nid=52665|accessdate=17 August 2013|newspaper=Hurriyet|date=16 August 2013|agency=Reuters|location=Dubai}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
Abbasi has regularly been linked to Iran's alleged efforts to make the nuclear weapon, a process called weaponization. According to an [[Institute for Science and International Security]] report citing an expert close to the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), Abbasi was a key scientist in the alleged Iranian covert nuclear weapons program headed by [[Mohsen Fakhrizadeh-Mahabadi]], a strong supporter of Iran's alleged nuclear weapons program. Abbasi personally directed work to calculate the yield of a nuclear weapon as well as work on high energy neutron sources, this expert added.&lt;ref name=isis/&gt;

According to the same report, the IAEA had information that Abbasi was the head of the Institute of Applied Physics (IAP), which was a follow-on organization to the Physics Research Center. Both of the organizations acted as fronts for scientific work on a possible Iranian nuclear weapons program.&lt;ref name=isis/&gt;

==Designation by the UN==
Abbasi is "listed in an annex to U.N. Security Council Resolution 1747 of 24 March 2007, as a person involved in Iran's nuclear or ballistic missile activities". This resolution imposes an asset freeze and travel notification requirements. Abbasi is described as a "Senior Ministry of Defence and Armed Forces Logistics (MODAFL) scientist with links to the Institute of Applied Physics, working closely with Mahabadi (also designated by the UN).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=24 March 2007 |title=Security Council toughens sanctions against Iran, adds arms embargo, with Unanimous Adoption of Resolution 1747 (2007) |website=United Nations |url=https://www.un.org/press/en/2007/sc8980.doc.htm |accessdate=2018-01-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Assassination attempt==
On 29 November 2010, Abbasi was seriously wounded and narrowly survived an assassination attempt on a Tehran street, as a man on a motorbike attached a bomb to his car as he drove to work.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/07/23/world/middleeast/23iran.html Survivor of Attack Leads Iran’s Nuclear Acceleration - The New York Times&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tehrantimes.com/news/411878/Israel-s-role-in-assassinations-of-nuclear-scientists Israel’s role in assassinations of nuclear scientists - Tehran Times&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-11860928 Iranian nuclear scientist killed in motorbike attack - BBC News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://americanfreepress.net/major-media-suppressing-obama-assassination-story/ Major Media Suppressing Obama Assassination Story – American Free Press&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; A separate similar bomb attack the same day killed another scientist, Dr. [[Majid Shahriari]], who also taught at [[Shahid Beheshti University]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/bomb-blast-blamed-on-israel-and-us-kills-iran-nuclear-scientist-2146996.html ''Bomb blast blamed on Israel and US kills Iran nuclear scientist''], ''The Independent'', 30 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

'''Formvar''' refers to any of several [[thermoplastic]] [[resins]] that are polyvinyl formals, which are polymers formed from [[polyvinyl alcohol]] and [[formaldehyde]] as [[copolymers]] with [[polyvinyl acetate]]. They are typically used as coatings, [[adhesives]], and molding materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/formvar|title=Formvar|year=2014|publisher=Merriam-Webster, Inc.|website=Merriam-Webster.com|accessdate=10 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Formvar" used to be the registered [[trade name]] of the polyvinyl formal resin produced by [[Monsanto Chemical Company]] in [[St. Louis, Missouri]]. That manufacturing unit was sold and formvar is now distributed under the name "Vinylec".&lt;ref name="SPI"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.2spi.com/catalog/submat/formvar-resins.shtml|title=SPI-Chem Vinylec (Formvar) Resins|publisher=Structure Probe, Inc.|date=10 July 2014|accessdate=10 July 2014|website=2SPI.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
Formvar is used in many different applications, such as wire insulation, coatings for musical instruments, magnetic tape backing, and support films for [[electron microscopy]].&lt;ref name="SPI" /&gt;  Formvar is also used as a main ingredient for special adhesives in structural applications such as the aircraft industry.&lt;ref name="SPI app"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.2spi.com/catalog/submat/vinylec-applications.html|title=Vinylec® Resins|publisher=Structure Probe, Inc.|year=2000|accessdate=10 July 2014|website=2SPI.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Magnet wire===
The major application of formvar resins is as [[electrical insulation]] for [[magnet wire]]. It is combined with other "wire enamels" which are then coated onto [[copper wire]] and cured in an oven to create a crosslinked film coating.&lt;ref name="SPI app" /&gt;

===Transmission electron microscopy===
Most specimens used in [[transmission electron microscopy]] (TEM) need to be supported by a thin electron-transparent film to hold the sample in place. Formvar films are a common choice of film grid for TEM. Formvar is favored because it allows users to utilize grids with lower mesh rating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.2spi.com/catalog/submat/sup_film3.shtml|title=SPI-Chem™ Formvar® Resin for Electron Microscopy|publisher=Structure Probe, Inc.|date=10 July 2014|accessdate=10 July 2014|website=2SPI.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physical characteristics==
Formvar resin has a high softening point and strong electric insulation properties. It is also very flexible, water-insoluble, and resistant to abrasion. Formvar is also halogen free. Formvar resins are combustible and can cause [[dust explosion]]s. For this reason exposure to heat, sparks, and flame should be avoided. Formvar is most commonly dissolved in [[ethylene dichloride]], [[chloroform]], and [[dioxane]].&lt;ref name="SPI" /&gt;

'''Gallium phosphide''' ('''{{Gallium}}{{Phosphorus}}'''), a [[phosphide]] of [[gallium]], is a [[compound semiconductor|compound]] [[semiconductor material]] with an [[indirect bandgap|indirect]] [[band gap]] of 2.26 [[electronvolt|eV]](300K). The polycrystalline material has the appearance of pale orange pieces. Undoped single crystal wafers appear clear orange, but strongly doped wafers appear darker due to free-carrier absorption. It is odorless and insoluble in water.

[[Sulfur]] or [[tellurium]] are used as [[doping (semiconductors)|dopant]]s to produce [[n-type semiconductor]]s.  [[Zinc]] is used as a dopant for the [[p-type semiconductor]].

Gallium phosphide has applications in optical systems. Its [[refractive index]] is between 4.30 at 262&amp;nbsp;nm (UV), 3.45 at 550&amp;nbsp;nm (green) and 3.19 at 840&amp;nbsp;nm (IR)&lt;ref&gt;http://refractiveindex.info/?group=CRYSTALS&amp;material=GaP&lt;/ref&gt;, which is higher than in most known materials, including [[diamond]] (2.4).

==Light-emitting diodes==
Gallium phosphide has been used in the manufacture of low-cost red, orange, and green [[light-emitting diode]]s (LEDs) with low to medium brightness since the 1960s. It has a relatively short life at higher current and its lifetime is sensitive to temperature. It is used standalone or together with [[gallium arsenide phosphide]].

Pure GaP LEDs emit green light at a wavelength of 555&amp;nbsp;nm. [[Nitrogen]]-doped GaP emits yellow-green (565&amp;nbsp;nm) light, [[zinc oxide]] doped GaP emits red (700&amp;nbsp;nm).

Gallium phosphide is transparent for yellow and red light, therefore GaAsP-on-GaP LEDs are more efficient than GaAsP-on-[[gallium arsenide|GaAs]].

At temperatures above ~900&amp;nbsp;°C, gallium phosphide dissociates and the phosphorus escapes as a gas. In crystal growth from a 1500&amp;nbsp;°C melt (for LED wafers), this must be prevented by holding the phosphorus in with a blanket of molten [[Boron trioxide|boric oxide]] in inert gas pressure of 10-100 atmospheres.  The process is called Liquid Encapsulated Czochralski (LEC) growth, an elaboration of the [[Czochralski process]] used for silicon wafers.

==Plot==
Wealthy Texas rancher Jordan "Bick" Benedict Jr. travels to [[Maryland]] to buy a horse. There he meets and courts [[socialite]] Leslie Lynnton, who ends a budding relationship with British diplomat Sir David Karfrey and marries Bick after a whirlwind romance. They return to Texas to start their life together on the family ranch, Reata, where Bick's older sister Luz runs the household. Leslie meets Jett Rink, a local handyman, and he becomes infatuated with her. On a ride with Jett, Leslie discovers the local Mexican workers' living conditions are terrible. After tending to one of the Mexican children, Angel Obregon II, she presses Bick to take steps to improve their condition.

When riding Leslie's beloved horse, War Winds, Luz expresses her hostility for Leslie by cruelly digging in her spurs. War Winds bucks her off, killing her. She leaves Jett a small piece of land on the Benedict ranch. Bick, who despises Jett, tries to buy back the land, but Jett refuses to sell. Jett makes the land his home and names it Little Reata. Over the next ten years, Leslie and Bick have twins, Jordan III ("Jordy") and Judy, and later have a daughter, Luz II.

After discovering oil within a footprint left by Leslie, Jett begins digging and strikes oil on his land. He then drives to the Benedict house, covered in crude, to proclaim to the Benedicts that he will be richer than them. Jett makes a pass at Leslie, and this leads to a brief fistfight with Bick before he drives off. Jett's oil drilling company prospers over the years, and he tries to persuade Bick to let him drill for oil on Reata. Bick is determined to preserve his family legacy, however, and refuses.

Meanwhile, tensions arise regarding the now-grown children. Bick insists that Jordy succeed him and run the ranch, but Jordy wants to become a doctor. Leslie wants Judy to attend [[finishing school]] in Switzerland, but Judy wants to study [[animal husbandry]] at [[Texas Tech University|Texas Tech]]. Both children succeed in pursuing their own vocations, each asking one parent to convince the other to let them have their way.

At the family Christmas party, Bick tries to interest Judy's new husband, Bob Dace, in working on the ranch after he returns from the [[World War II|recently declared war]], but Dace refuses. Jett arrives and persuades Bick to allow oil production on his land. Realizing that his children will not take over the ranch when he retires, Bick agrees. Luz II, now in her teens, starts flirting with Jett. Once oil production starts on the ranch, the Benedict family becomes even wealthier and more powerful. Meanwhile, the now-grown Angel is killed in the war, and his body is sent home for burial.

The Benedict–Rink rivalry comes to a head when the Benedicts discover that Luz II and the much older Jett have been dating. At a huge party given by Jett in his own honor at his hotel in Austin, he orders his staff not to serve Jordy's Mexican wife, Juana. Enraged, Jordy tries to start a fight with Jett, who beats him and has him thrown out. Fed up, Bick challenges Jett to a fight. Drunk and almost incoherent, Jett leads the way to a wine storage room. Seeing that Jett is in no state to defend himself, Bick lowers his fists, and instead topples Jett's wine cellar shelves. The Benedict family leaves the party. Jett staggers into the banquet hall, takes his seat of honor, and passes out on the table. Later, Luz II sees Jett drunkenly bemoaning his unrequited love for Leslie. Luz II leaves, heartbroken, as Jett falls over onto the floor.

The next day, on their way home, the Benedicts stop at a diner with a sign at the counter saying, "We reserve the right to refuse service to anyone," which during the mid-twentieth century in the southern United States was often taken as meaning that ethnic minorities were not welcome. The racist owner, Sarge, insults Juana and her and Jordy's son Jordan IV. When the owner goes on to eject a Mexican family from the diner, Bick tells Sarge to leave them alone. Bick fights Sarge, who beats him, but then takes down the sign and tosses it on top of Bick. Back at the ranch, Bick laments that he has failed to preserve the Benedict family legacy. Leslie replies that, after the fight in the diner, he was her hero for the first time, and that she considers their own family legacy a success. They look at their two grandchildren, one white and one Hispanic.

==Production==
===Writing===
Ferber's character of Jordan Benedict II and her description of the Reata Ranch were based on [[King Ranch|Robert "Bob" J. Kleberg Jr. (1896–1974) and the King Ranch]] in [[Kingsville, Texas]]. Like the over half-million-acre Reata, King Ranch comprises 825,000 acres (3,340&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; 1,289&amp;nbsp;sq&amp;nbsp;mi) and includes portions of six Texas counties, including most of [[Kleberg County]] and much of [[Kenedy County]], and was largely a livestock ranch before the discovery of oil. The fictional character Jett Rink was inspired partly by the extraordinary rags-to-riches life story of the wildcatter oil tycoon [[Glenn Herbert McCarthy]] (1907–1988). Author Edna Ferber met McCarthy when she was a guest at his [[Houston]], [[Texas]], [[Shamrock Hotel]] (known as the Shamrock Hilton after 1955), the fictional Emperador Hotel in both the book and the film.

===Casting===
The Australian actor [[Rod Taylor]] was cast in one of his earliest Hollywood roles after being seen in an episode of ''[[Studio 57]]'', "The Black Sheep's Daughter".&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Vagg, ''Rod Taylor: An Australian in Hollywood'', Bear Manor Media, 2010 p49&lt;/ref&gt;

Stevens gave Hudson a choice between [[Elizabeth Taylor]] and [[Grace Kelly]] to play his leading lady, Leslie. Hudson chose Taylor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Giant: Summary and Notes|url=http://www.afi.com/members/catalog/DetailView.aspx?s=&amp;Movie=53655|work=Catalog of Feature Films|publisher=American Film Institute|accessdate=20 August 2012|quote=According to modern and contemporary sources, Grace Kelly was sought for the role of Leslie Benedict. Modern sources claim that once her engagement to Prince Rainier of Monaco was announced, however, M-G-M decided not to loan her out for Giant. Elizabeth Taylor, who ultimately received the highly desirable role, was also under to M-G-M, which loaned her out to Warner Bros. Modern sources also claim that Hudson, when given the choice of his leading lady by Stevens, chose Taylor.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[James Dean]]'s death late in production, [[Nick Adams (actor, born 1931)|Nick Adams]] overdubbed some of Dean's lines, which were nearly inaudible, as Rink's voice.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt; George Stevens had a reputation as a meticulous film editor, and the film spent an entire year in the editing room.&lt;ref&gt;Perry, p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Filming===
[[Image:GiantSet.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Cast members and crew at work on the Reata mansion set. The [[Second Empire architecture|Second-empire]] [[Victorian architecture|Victorian]] mansion facade designed by [[Boris Leven]] became an iconic image for the film.]]
The film begins with Jordan "Bick" Benedict, played by Hudson, arriving at [[Ardmore, Maryland]], to purchase a stallion from the Lynnton family. The first part of the picture was actually shot in [[Albemarle County]], [[Virginia]], and used the [[Keswick, Virginia]], railroad station as the Ardmore railway depot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Maurer|first=David|title=Giant effort to make it in movies|url=http://www2.dailyprogress.com/lifestyles/cdp-lifestyles/2008/may/11/giant_effort_to_make_it_in_movies-ar-79181/|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130121123030/http://www2.dailyprogress.com/lifestyles/cdp-lifestyles/2008/may/11/giant_effort_to_make_it_in_movies-ar-79181/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=21 January 2013|publisher=Daily Progress|accessdate=20 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Much of the subsequent film, depicting "Reata", the Benedict ranch, was shot in and around the town of [[Marfa, Texas]], and the remote, dry plains found nearby, with interiors filmed at the Warner Brothers studios in [[Burbank, California]].&lt;ref name="Moss2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Marilyn Ann Moss|title=Giant: George Stevens, a Life on Film|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iPEhCJbul9QC&amp;pg=PA217|date=4 August 2015|publisher=Terrace Books, University of Wisconsin Press|isbn=978-0-299-20433-4|page=217}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "Jett Rink Day" parade and airport festivities were filmed at the [[Bob Hope Airport|Burbank Airport]].

===Music===
During the restaurant fight scene at the film's end, the jukebox plays ''[[The Yellow Rose of Texas (song)|The Yellow Rose of Texas]]'' by [[Mitch Miller]]. That version of the song happened to be the #1 pop single on the ''Billboard Magazine'' Best Sellers chart at the time of James Dean's death.

===Themes===
The movie is an epic portrayal of a powerful Texas ranching family challenged by changing times and the coming of big oil.&lt;ref name=McMurtry&gt;{{cite news|last=McMurtry|first=Larry|title=Men Swaggered, Women Warred, Oil Flowed|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/09/29/movies/men-swaggered-women-warred-oil-flowed.html|accessdate=21 August 2012|newspaper=New York Times|date=September 29, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; A major subplot concerns the [[racism]] of many Anglo-European Americans in Texas during the mid twentieth century and the discriminatory social [[Racial segregation|segregation]] enforced against [[Mexican American]]s.&lt;ref name="Stacy2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Lee Stacy|title=Mexico and the United States during that time in history|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DSzyMGh8pNwC&amp;pg=PA326|date=1 October 2002|publisher=Marshall Cavendish|isbn=978-0-7614-7402-9|page=326}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first third of the film, Bick and Luz treat the Mexicans who work on their ranch condescendingly, which upsets the more socially-conscious Leslie. Bick eventually comes to realize his moral shortcomings&amp;nbsp;–  in a climactic scene at a roadside diner he loses a fistfight to the racist owner, but earns Leslie's respect for defending the [[human rights]] of his brown-skinned daughter-in-law and grandson. Another subplot involves Leslie's own striving for women's equal rights as she defies the [[Patriarchy|patriarchal]] social order, asserting herself and expressing her own opinions when the men talk. She protests being expected to suppress her beliefs in deference to Bick's; this conflict leads to their temporary separation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Giant: Summary and Notes|url=http://www.afi.com/members/catalog/DetailView.aspx?s=&amp;Movie=53655|work=Catalog of Feature Films|publisher=American Film Institute|accessdate=20 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Giant'' is [[Edna Ferber]]'s third novel dealing with racism; the first was ''[[Show Boat (novel)|Show Boat]]'' (1926), which was adapted into the legendary Broadway musical ''[[Show Boat]]'' (1927); her second was ''[[Cimarron (novel)|Cimarron]]'' (1929), which was adapted to film twice, in [[Cimarron (1931 film)|1931]] and [[Cimarron (1960 film)|1960]].&lt;ref name="McGraw2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Eliza McGraw|title=Edna Ferber's America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ut2dAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA50|date=7 January 2014|publisher=LSU Press|isbn=978-0-8071-5189-1|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

U.K.|isbn=978-095-649-427-6|pages=227, 233|edition=paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the local [[DuMont Television Network|DuMont]] station, [[WNYW|WABD]], televising the arrival of cast and crew, as well as other celebrities and studio chief [[Jack L. Warner]]{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}.  The picture was released to nationwide distribution on November 24, 1956.&lt;ref name=Perry/&gt;

[[Capitol Records]], which had issued some of [[Dimitri Tiomkin]]'s music from the soundtrack (with the composer conducting the Warner Brothers studio orchestra) on an LP, later digitally remastered the tracks and issued them on CD, including two tracks conducted by [[Ray Heindorf]]. Both versions used a [[monaural]] blend of the multi-channel soundtrack recording.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

==Reception==
''Giant'' won praise from both critics and the public, and according to the Texan author, [[Larry McMurtry]], was especially popular with Texans, even though it was sharply critical of Texan society.&lt;ref name=McMurtry /&gt; [[Bosley Crowther]] of the ''[[New York Times]]'' wrote that "[[George Stevens]] takes three hours and seventeen minutes to put his story across. That's a heap of time to go on about Texas, but Mr. Stevens has made a heap of film." He continued to write that "''Giant'', for all its complexity, is a strong contender for the year's top-film award."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9B07E2D61F38E13BBC4952DFB667838D649EDE | title= Movie Review: ''Giant'' (1956).

[[Variety (magazine)|''Variety'']]'s "Hift" claimed that ''Giant'' was "for the most part, an excellent film which registers strongly on all levels, whether it's in its breathtaking panoramic shots of the dusty Texas plains; the personal, dramatic impact of the story itself, or the resounding message it has to impart."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://variety.com/1956/film/reviews/giant-2-1200418151/ |title=''Giant'' (Review) |last="Hift" |date=October 10, 1956 |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[TV Guide]]'' gave the film four stars out of five, saying of James Dean's performance "This was the last role in Dean's all-too-brief career&amp;nbsp;– he was dead when the film was released – and his presence ran away with the film. He performs his role in the overwrought method manner of the era, and the rest of the cast seems to be split between awe of his talent and disgust over his indulgence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://movies.tvguide.com/giant/review/124399|title=''Giant'' (1956)| work = [[TV Guide]] | accessdate=May 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film received a 95% approval rating on the [[review aggregator]] site [[Rotten Tomatoes]], based on 39 reviews, with an average rating of 7.6/10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/giant/ | title=Giant (1956) | publisher=[[Fandango Media]] |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |accessdate=March 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Less praising was director and critic [[François Truffaut|Francois Truffaut]], who in an early review called ''Giant'' a ”silly, solemn, sly, parternalistic, demagogic movie without any boldness, rich in all sorts of concessions, pettiness, and contemptible actions.”[https://books.google.se/books?id=XP4Ugr7Bv8UC&amp;pg=PA84&amp;lpg=PA84#v=onepage&amp;q=reviews%20by%20truffaut]

===Box office===
The movie earned $12 million in rentals in North America during its initial release.&lt;ref&gt;"All Time Domestic Champs", ''Variety'', 6 January 1960 p.&amp;nbsp;34&lt;/ref&gt;  It was one of the biggest hits of the year in France, with admissions of 3,723,209.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficestory.com/france-1957-c22750201 |title=Box Office France 1957 |last=Soyer|first=Renaud |work=Box Office Story|date=November 9, 2014|accessdate=March 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:12. Тлеечко празнење.ogv|thumb|250px|Glow discharge in a low-pressure tube caused by electric current.]]
A '''glow discharge''' is a [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] formed by the passage of [[electric current]] through a gas. It is often created by applying a voltage between two [[electrode]]s in a glass tube containing a low-pressure gas. When the voltage exceeds a value called the [[striking voltage]], the gas [[ionization]] becomes self-sustaining, and the tube glows with a colored light.  The color depends on the gas used.

Glow discharges are used as a source of light in devices such as [[neon light]]s, [[fluorescent lamp]]s, and [[plasma display|plasma-screen televisions]]. Analyzing the light produced with [[spectroscopy]] can reveal information about the atomic interactions in the gas, so glow discharges are used in [[plasma physics]] and [[analytical chemistry]]. They are also used in the surface treatment technique called [[sputtering]].

==Electrical conduction in gas==

Conduction in a gas requires charge carriers, which can be either electrons or ions.  Charge carriers come from ionizing some of the gas molecules.  In terms of current flow, glow discharge falls between dark discharge and arc discharge.

*In a dark discharge, the gas is ionized (the carriers are generated) by a radiation source such as ultraviolet light or [[Cosmic rays]]. At higher voltages across the anode and cathode, the freed carriers can gain enough energy so that additional carriers are freed during collisions; the process is a [[Townsend avalanche]] or multiplication.
*In a glow discharge, the carrier generation process reaches a point where the average electron leaving the cathode allows another electron to leave the cathode. For example, the average electron may cause dozens of ionizing collisions via the Townsend avalanche; the resulting positive ions head toward the cathode, and a fraction of those that cause collisions with the cathode will dislodge an electron by [[secondary emission]].
*In an [[arc discharge]], electrons leave the cathode by [[thermionic emission]] and [[field emission]], and the gas is ionized by thermal means.&lt;ref name="alex"&gt;{{cite book | last = Fridman | first = Alexander | title = Plasma physics and engineering | publisher = [[CRC Press]] | location = Boca Raton, FL | year = 2011 | isbn = 978-1439812280 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Below the [[breakdown voltage]] there is no or little glow and the electric field is uniform. When the electric field increases enough to cause ionization, the Townsend discharge starts. &lt;!-- Light may be visible during the upper end of the Townsend region. --&gt; When a glow discharge develops, the electric field is considerably modified by the presence of positive ions; the field is concentrated near the cathode. The glow discharge starts as a normal glow. As the current is increased, more of the cathode surface is involved in the glow. When the current is increased above the level where the entire cathode surface is involved, the discharge is known as an abnormal glow. If the current is increased still further, other factors come into play and an [[Electric arc|arc discharge]] begins.&lt;ref&gt;Principles of Electronics By V.K. Mehta {{ISBN|81-219-2450-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mechanism==
The simplest type of glow discharge is a [[direct-current]] glow discharge. In its simplest form, it consists of two electrodes in a cell held at low pressure (0.1–10 [[torr]]; about 1/10000th to 1/100th of atmospheric pressure). A low pressure is used to increase the [[mean free path]]; for a fixed electric field, a longer mean free path allows a charged particle to gain more energy before colliding with another particle. The cell is typically filled with neon, but other gases can also be used. An [[electric potential]] of several hundred volts is applied between the two electrodes. A small fraction of the population of atoms within the cell is initially [[ionized]] through random processes, such as thermal collisions between atoms or by [[gamma ray]]s. The positive ions are driven towards the [[cathode]] by the electric potential, and the electrons are driven towards the [[anode]] by the same potential. The initial population of ions and electrons collides with other atoms, [[Excited state|exciting]] or ionizing them. As long as the potential is maintained, a population of ions and electrons remains.

===Secondary emission===
Some of the ions' kinetic energy is transferred to the cathode. This happens partially through the ions striking the cathode directly. The primary mechanism, however, is less direct. Ions strike the more numerous neutral gas atoms, transferring a portion of their energy to them. These neutral atoms then strike the cathode. Whichever species (ions or atoms) strike the cathode, collisions within the cathode redistribute this energy resulting in electrons ejected from the cathode. This process is known as  secondary electron emission. Once free of the cathode, the electric field accelerates electrons into the bulk of the glow discharge.  Atoms can then be excited by collisions with ions, electrons, or other atoms that have been previously excited by collisions.

===Light production===
Once excited, atoms will lose their energy fairly quickly. Of the various ways that this energy can be lost, the most important is radiatively, meaning that a photon is released to carry the energy away. In optical [[atomic spectroscopy]], the wavelength of this photon can be used to determine the identity of the atom (that is, which [[chemical element]] it is) and the number of photons is directly proportional to the concentration of that element in the sample. Some collisions (those of high enough energy) will cause ionization. In atomic [[mass spectrometry]], these ions are detected. Their mass identifies the type of atoms and their quantity reveals the amount of that element in the sample.

The illustrations to the right shows the main regions that may be present in a glow discharge.  Regions described as "glows" emit significant light; regions labeled as "dark spaces" do not. As the discharge becomes more extended (i.e., stretched horizontally in the geometry of the illustrations), the positive column may become [[wikt:striated|striated]]. That is, alternating dark and bright regions may form. Compressing the discharge horizontally will result in fewer regions. The positive column will be compressed while the negative glow will remain the same size, and, with small enough gaps, the positive column will disappear altogether. In an analytical glow discharge, the discharge is primarily a negative glow with dark region above and below it.

===Cathode layer===
The cathode layer begins with the Aston dark space, and ends with the negative glow region.  The cathode layer shortens with  increased gas pressure.  The cathode layer has a positive space charge and a strong electric field.&lt;ref name="fridman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="KonjevicVidenovic1997"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Konjevic|first1=N.|last2=Videnovic|first2=I. R.|last3=Kuraica|first3=M. M.|title=Emission Spectroscopy of the Cathode Fall Region of an Analytical Glow Discharge|journal=Le Journal de Physique IV|volume=07|issue=C4|year=1997|pages=C4-247–C4-258|issn=1155-4339|doi=10.1051/jp4:1997420 |url=https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/jpa-00255576/document |accessdate=June 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Aston dark space====
Electrons leave the cathode with an energy of about 1 eV, which is not enough to ionize or excite atoms, leaving a thin dark layer next to the cathode.&lt;ref name="fridman"&gt;{{cite book | last = Fridman | first = Alexander | title = Plasma chemistry | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]] | location = Cambridge | p=177 | year = 2012 | isbn = 978-1107684935 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cathode glow====
Electrons from the cathode eventually attain enough energy to excite atoms.  These excited atoms quickly fall back to the ground state, emitting light at a wavelength corresponding to the difference between the energy bands of the atoms.  This glow is seen very near the cathode.&lt;ref name="fridman"/&gt;

===={{anchor| cathode fall}}Cathode dark space====
As electrons from the cathode gain more energy, they tend to ionize, rather than excite atoms.  Excited atoms quickly fall back to ground level emitting light, however, when atoms are ionized, the opposite charges are separated, and do not immediately recombine.  This results in more ions and electrons, but no light.&lt;ref name="fridman"/&gt;  This region is sometimes called [[William Crookes|Crookes]] dark space, and sometimes referred to as the ''cathode fall'', because the largest voltage drop in the tube occurs in this region.

====Negative glow====
The ionization in the cathode dark space result in a high electron density, but slower electrons, making it easier for the electrons to recombine with positive ions, leading to intense light, through a process called [[bremsstrahlung radiation]].&lt;ref name="fridman"/&gt;

====Faraday dark space====
As the electrons keep losing energy, less light is emitted, resulting in another dark space.&lt;ref name="fridman"/&gt;

===Anode layer===
The anode layer begin with the positive column, and ends at the anode.  The anode layer has a negative space charge and a moderate electric field.&lt;ref name="fridman"/&gt;

====Positive column====
With fewer ions, the electric field increases, resulting in electrons with energy of about 2 eV, which is enough to excite atoms and produce light.  With longer glow discharge tubes, the longer space is occupied by a longer positive column, while the cathode layer remains the same.&lt;ref name="fridman"/&gt;  For example, with a neon sign, the positive column occupies almost the entire length of the tube.

====Anode glow====
An electric field increase results in the anode glow.&lt;ref name="fridman"/&gt;

====Anode dark space====
Fewer electrons result in another dark space.&lt;ref name="fridman"/&gt;

===Striations===
Bands of alternating light and dark in the positive column are called [[wikt:striations|striations]].  Striations occur because only discrete amounts of energy can be absorbed or released by atoms, when electrons move from one [[quantum]] level to another.  The effect was [[Franck–Hertz experiment#Franck.E2.80.93Hertz experiment with neon|explained by  Franck and Hertz]] in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Fundamentals of Light Sources and Lasers |pages=31–36 |chapter=2.6 The Franck–Hertz Experiment |first=Mark |last=Csele |publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] |year=2011 |isbn=9780471675228 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xQfKWwvH42kC&amp;pg=PA31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sputtering===
In addition to causing secondary emission, positive ions can strike the cathode with sufficient force to eject particles of the material from which the cathode is made.  This process is called [[sputtering]] and it gradually [[ablation|ablates]] the cathode.  Sputtering is useful when using [[spectroscopy]] to analyze the composition of the cathode, as is done in [[Glow-discharge optical emission spectroscopy]].&lt;ref name="Mavrodineanu1984"/&gt;

However, sputtering is not desirable when glow discharge is used for lighting, because it shortens the life of the lamp.  For example, [[neon sign]]s have [[hollow cathode effect|hollow cathodes]] designed to minimize sputtering, and contain charcoal to continuously remove undesired ions and atoms.&lt;ref name="claude"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Claude |first=Georges |title=The Development of Neon Tubes |journal=The [[Engineering Magazine]] |date=November 1913 |pages=271–274|lccn=sn83009124 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=erpMAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA271}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Carrier gas===
In the context of sputtering, the gas in the tube is called "carrier gas," because it carries the particles from the cathode.&lt;ref name="Mavrodineanu1984"/&gt;

===Color difference===
Because of sputtering occurring at the cathode, the colors emitted from regions near the cathode are quite different than the anode.  Particles sputtered from the cathode are excited and emit radiation from the metals and oxides that make up the cathode.  The radiation from these particles combines with radiation from excited carrier gas, giving the cathode region a white or blue color, while in the rest of the tube, radiation is only from the carrier gas and tends to be more monochromatic.&lt;ref name="Mavrodineanu1984"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mavrodineanu|first1=R.|title=Hollow Cathode Discharges - Analytical Applications|journal=Journal of Research of the National Bureau of Standards|volume=89|issue=2|year=1984|pages=147|issn=0160-1741|doi=10.6028/jres.089.009 |url=http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/jres/089/jresv89n2p143_A1b.pdf |accessdate=June 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Electrons near the cathode are less energetic than the rest of the tube. Surrounding the cathode is a negative field, which slows electrons as they are ejected from the surface. Only those electrons with the highest velocity are able to escape this field, and those without enough kinetic energy are pulled back into the cathode. Once outside the negative field, the attraction from the positive field begins to accelerate these electrons toward the anode. During this acceleration electrons are deflected and slowed down by positive ions speeding toward the cathode, which, in turn, produces bright blue-white [[bremsstrahlung]] radiation in the negative glow region.&lt;ref name="whitaker"&gt;{{cite book | last = Whitaker | first = Jerry | title = Power vacuum tubes handbook, Second Edition | page=94 | publisher = CRC Press | location = Boca Raton | year = 1999 | isbn = 1420049658 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use in analytical chemistry==

Glow discharges can be used to analyze the elemental, and sometimes molecular, composition of solids, liquids, and gases, but elemental analysis of solids is the most common. In this arrangement, the sample is used as the cathode. As mentioned earlier, gas ions and atoms striking the sample surface knock atoms off of it, a process known as sputtering.

The sputtered atoms, now in the gas phase, can be detected by atomic absorption, but this is a comparatively rare strategy. Instead, atomic emission and mass spectrometry are usually used.  Collisions between the gas-phase sample atoms and the plasma gas pass energy to the sample atoms. This energy can excite the atoms, after which they can lose their energy through atomic emission.

By observing the wavelength of the emitted light, the atom's identity can be determined. By observing the intensity of the emission, the concentration of atoms of that type can be determined. Energy gained through collisions can also ionize the sample atoms. The ions can then be detected by mass spectrometry. In this case, it is the mass of the ions that identify the element and the number of ions that reflect the concentration. This method is referred to as glow discharge mass spectrometry (GDMS) and it has detection limits down to the sub-ppb range for most elements that are nearly matrix-independent.

===Depth analysis===
Both bulk and depth analysis of solids may be performed with glow discharge. Bulk analysis assumes that the sample is fairly homogeneous and averages the emission or mass spectrometric signal over time. Depth analysis relies on tracking the signal in time, therefore, is the same as tracking the elemental composition in depth.

Depth analysis requires greater control over operational parameters. For example, conditions (current, potential, pressure) need to be adjusted so that the crater produced by sputtering is flat bottom (that is, so that the depth analyzed over the crater area is uniform). In bulk measurement, a rough or rounded crater bottom would not adversely impact analysis. Under the best conditions, depth resolution in the single nanometer range has been achieved (in fact, within-molecule resolution has been demonstrated).{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

The chemistry of ions and neutrals in vacuum is called [[gas phase ion chemistry]] and is part of the analytical study that includes glow discharge.

==Powering modes==
[[File:Neon lamp on DC.JPG|thumb|upright=0.8|DC powered neon lamp, showing glow discharge surrounding only the cathode]]

In [[analytical chemistry]], glow discharges are usually operated in direct-current mode. For direct-current, the cathode (which is the sample in solids analysis) must be conductive.  In contrast, analysis of a non conductive cathode requires the use of a high frequency alternating current.

The potential, pressure, and current are interrelated. Only two can be directly controlled at once, while the third must be allowed to vary. The pressure is most typically held constant, but other schemes may be used. The pressure and current may be held constant, while potential is allowed to vary. The pressure and voltage may be held constant while the current is allowed to vary. The power (product of voltage and current) may be held constant while the pressure is allowed to vary.

Glow discharges may also be operated in radio-frequency. The use of this frequency will establish a negative DC-bias voltage on the sample surface. The DC-bias is the result of an alternating current waveform that is centered about negative potential; as such it more or less represent the average potential residing on the sample surface. Radio-frequency has ability to appear to flow through insulators (non-conductive materials).

Both radio-frequency and direct-current glow discharges can be operated in pulsed mode, where the potential is turned on and off. This allows higher instantaneous powers to be applied without excessively heating the cathode. These higher instantaneous powers produce higher instantaneous signals, aiding detection. Combining time-resolved detection with pulsed powering results in additional benefits. In atomic emission, analyte atoms emit during different portions of the pulse than background atoms, allowing the two to be discriminated. Analogously, in mass spectrometry, sample and background ions are created at different times.

==Application to analog computing==
An interesting application for using glow discharge was described in a 2002 scientific paper by Ryes, Ghanem ''et al.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt;
According to a Nature news article describing the work,&lt;ref&gt;Mini-map gives tourists neon route signs: http://www.nature.com/news/2002/020527/full/news020520-12.html&lt;/ref&gt; researchers at Imperial College London demonstrated how they built a mini-map that glows along the shortest route between two points.  The Nature news article describes the system as follows:

:To make the one-inch London chip, the team etched a plan of the city centre on a glass slide. Fitting a flat lid over the top turned the streets into hollow, connected tubes. They filled these with helium gas, and inserted electrodes at key tourist hubs. When a voltage is applied between two points, electricity naturally runs through the streets along the shortest route from A to B - and the gas glows like a tiny neon strip light.

The approach itself provides a novel visible [[analog computing]] approach for solving a wide class of maze searching problems based on the properties of lighting up of a glow discharge in a microfluidic chip.

==Application to voltage regulation==
[[File:5651RegulatorTubeInOperation.jpg|thumb|upright|A 5651 voltage-regulator tube in operation]]
In the mid-20th century, prior to the development of [[solid state electronics|solid state]] components such as [[Zener diodes]], [[Voltage regulator#DC voltage stabilizers|voltage regulation]] in circuits was often accomplished with [[voltage-regulator tube]]s, which used glow discharge.

The '''HVDC Haenam–Cheju''' is a 101 kilometer long [[HVDC]] [[submarine power cable|submarine cable]] connection between the [[Korean Peninsula]] and the island of [[Jeju-do|Jeju]] (spelled Cheju until 2000) in [[South Korea]], which went into service in 1996. The connection is [[High-voltage direct current#Bipolar|bipolar]], consisting of two 180kV cables with a maximum transmission power of 300 [[megawatt]]s.

The Haenam–Cheju HVDC system is owned and operated by [[Korea Electric Power Corporation]] (KEPCO).

The line runs from the Haenam converter station situated at {{Coord|34|22|03|N|126|35|34|E|type:landmark|name=Haenam Converter Station}} to Jeju converter station at {{Coord|33|32|06|N|126|35|44|E|type:landmark|name=Jeju Converter Station}} and has no overhead line sections. The first 5 kilometres on Korean Mainland are underground, the rest of the cable is laid partially buried in the sea. As the [[HVDC converter station|converter station]] on Jeju is close to the sea, all equipment (even the AC harmonic filters) is installed indoors in order to prevent corrosion and pollution-related flashovers from sea salt.&lt;ref&gt;System Characteristics of Haenam-Cheju HVDC link in Korea, Kim JY, Kwon GO, Lim SJ, ICEE 97 Conference, Beijing, Aug 12 1996, p558.&lt;/ref&gt;

The system is designed to take over the full power supply of Jeju and is therefore equipped with [[Synchronous condenser|synchronous compensators]] delivering the required reactive power and commutation voltage when there is no generation unit at Jeju in operation.&lt;ref&gt;Equipment and control features of Haenam–Cheju HVDC link in South Korea, Thanawala, H.L et al, [[International Council on Large Electric Systems|CIGRÉ]] session, Paris, 1994, paper ref 14-303.&lt;/ref&gt; These synchronous compensators can be started with gas turbines, which allows starting and subsequently running the HVDC transmission scheme when there is no generation available on the island.

The HVDC scheme includes several unusual design features arising from the design objective of using the HVDC link as the sole source of power to Jeju, in which mode it must define the frequency of the island system. For this reason the inverter on Jeju island must be able to control the received power rapidly without reliance on telecommunications to the mainland. As a result, the control characteristics are reversed from the conventional practice, the inverter (Jeju) station controlling current and the rectifier (Haenam) station controlling DC voltage. The thyristor valves are also designed to operate with a minimum power down to zero (compared with the usual minimum of 5-10%).

'''Habermaaß''' GmbH is a [[Germany|German]] toy manufacturing company (commonly referred to as HABA) based in [[Bad Rodach]], [[Bavaria]]. The company defines itself as an “Inventor for inquisitive minds”, offering a broad selection of products such as wooden and textile toys, home furnishings and accessories for babies and children. Today the company is still a family run company, under the leadership of the managing partner Klaus Habermaaß and the managing director Harald Grosch.

== History ==
In  1938, Eugen Habermaaß and Anton Engel founded “Habermaaß &amp; Co.” as a “factory for fine wooden products”, and a couple of months later  “Wehrfritz &amp; Co." in cooperation with Karl Wehrfritz.
In 1940, only two years after its foundation, when Anton Engel withdrew from the company, Eugen Habermaaß became its sole managing director. When he died, in 1955, his wife Luise Habermaaß took over the management of the company. At the same time, their son, Klaus Habermaaß, later to become the managing director of the company, decided to start an apprenticeship in cabinetmaking. On finishing his engineering studies in 1961, he became actively engaged in the running of the company, which grew and expanded in the following years.

The small [[manufacturer]] of wooden toys sets out to become a market leader in the sector, facing up to the challenge of globalization. The toy manufacturer based in Upper Frankonia expands first in the United States where in 1980 the American company “Skaneateles Handicrafters” becomes part of the Habermaaß Inc., first as a production and later as a sales and distribution site. Renamed in the following years as “T.C. Timber”, in 2002 the company receives the definitive company name of “Habermaaß Corp. Inc.". In the meantime, in 1993, a subsidiary is founded in the [[France|French]] location of [[Evry]] near [[Paris]] under the name of “HABA S.A.R.L" and in 2005 the “HABA UK” site is established in the United Kingdom.

In order to expand their product range even further the corporate family of HABA and Wehrfritz decided back in 1987 to found Jako-o GmbH, a joint mail-order company for children’s fashion, toys and accessories which in 2004 was enlarged with the addition of the sales branches Fit-z and Qiéro.

== Product range ==
Since the company was founded in 1938, [[wood]]en toys have been a trademark of HABA. The company became known in particular for its [[construction blocks]], which up until now have been an integral part of the product range. Over the decades the product range has expanded: first incorporating other wooden toys such as pulling figures, vehicles, clutching toys and a complex upgradeable ball track system, followed later by the first society games. Which is how in 1986 the most famous HABA game “The Orchard” was created. The connections with the closely related Wehrfritz company were also taken advantage of in the upcoming development and production of children’s furniture –all made in a child friendly way using only the finest woods.

Even today the main focus of the company still lies in manufacturing out of wood. However, progressively different materials have been incorporated: with dolls and fabric animals, rugs, furniture for children’s rooms and illumination articles finding their way into the product range which is further complemented by gift articles, accessories and children’s jewelry. All products made by the Habermaaß company, however, have one shared aim, fostering the healthy development of children.

== Company sites and distribution areas ==

Since it was founded in 1938, the company’s production site has been located in the Upper Frankonian town of Bad Rodach, just a few kilometers away from the federal state boundary with [[Thuringia]]. It is from here that all business and the daily activities of the different branch offices are monitored and directed. The company holds distribution branches in the USA, France and the United Kingdom. Today the company is firmly established in both the European and world markets – with distribution areas stretching from Japan, Russia, the [[Near East]] and [[Europe]] to [[North america|North]] and [[South America]].

== Awards ==
Amongst the most prestigious awards that have been conferred on HABA are the Best Children's Game of the Year, the German Children;s Games award, the Toy Innovation Award and the German Educational Game Award.

*Best Children's Game of the Year
**2000 – ''Pete the Pirate''
**2002 – ''Highly Suspect''
**2003 – ''Shiver-Stone Castle''
**2005 – ''Akaba''
*German Children's Games award
**2001 – ''Klondike''

**2010 – ''Dragon Diego Dart''
*Toy Innovation Award''
**2005 – ''Akaba''
*German Educational Game Award
**2006 – ''Big Cheese''
**2007 – ''Said and done!''

Many HABA playthings have also been designated with the "Spiel Gut" ('Good Toy') stamp.

''Karuba'', one of HABA's strategy board games, was nominated for the 2016 [[Spiel des Jahres]] award.&lt;ref&gt;https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/183251/karuba&lt;/ref&gt;

Prof '''Henri Victor Regnault''' [[Royal Society of London|FRS]] H[[FRSE]] (21 July 1810 – 19 January 1878) was a French [[chemist]] and [[physicist]] best known for his careful measurements of the thermal properties of gases.  He was an early [[thermodynamicist]] and was mentor to [[William Thomson, 1st Baron Kelvin|William Thomson]] in the late 1840s.

==Biography==
Born in [[Aachen]] in 1810, he moved to Paris at the age of eight, following the death of his parents.  There, he worked for an upholstery firm until he was eighteen.  In 1830, he was admitted to the [[École Polytechnique]], and in 1832 he graduated from the [[École nationale supérieure des mines de Paris|École des mines]].

Working under [[Justus von Liebig]] at [[Gießen]], Regnault distinguished himself in the nascent field of [[organic chemistry]] by synthesizing several [[chlorine|chlorinated]] [[hydrocarbons]] (e.g. [[vinyl chloride]], [[polyvinylidene chloride]], [[dichloromethane]]), and he was appointed professor of chemistry at the University of [[Lyon]].  In 1840, he was appointed the chair of chemistry of the École Polytechnique, and in 1841, he became a professor of Physics in the [[Collège de France]].

Beginning in 1843, he began compiling extensive numerical tables on the properties of steam.  These were published in 1847, and led to his receiving the [[Rumford Medal]] of the [[Royal Society of London]] and appointment as [[Chief Engineer of Mines]]. In 1851 he was elected a foreign member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]]. In 1854 he was appointed director of the [[porcelain]] works at [[Sèvres]], the ''[[Manufacture nationale de Sèvres]]''.

At Sèvres, he continued work on the thermal properties of matter.  He designed sensitive [[thermometer]]s, [[hygrometer]]s, [[hypsometer]]s and [[calorimeter]]s, and measured the [[specific heat]]s of many substances and the [[coefficient of thermal expansion]] of gases.  In the course of this work, he discovered that not all gases expand equally when heated and that [[Boyle's Law]] is only an approximation, especially at temperatures near a substance's boiling point.

Regnault was also an avid amateur photographer.  He introduced the use of [[pyrogallic acid]] as a developing agent, and was one of the first photographers to use paper negatives.  In 1854, he became the founding president of the [[Société française de photographie]].

In 1871, his laboratory at Sèvres was destroyed and his son [[Alex-Georges-Henri Regnault]] killed, both as a result of the [[Franco-Prussian War]].  He retired from science the next year, never recovering from these losses.

==Legacy==
The crater [[Regnault (crater)|Regnault]] on the [[Moon]] is named after Regnault, and his name is one of the [[List of the 72 names on the Eiffel Tower|72 names inscribed on the Eiffel Tower]].  Some have suggested that the symbol ''R'' for the [[ideal gas constant]] is also named after him.&lt;ref name="Jensen"&gt;{{cite journal

Kaonic hydrogen has been created in very low energy collisions of kaons with the protons in a gaseous hydrogen target. At DAFNE, kaons are produced by the decay of [[Phi meson|&amp;phi; meson]]s which are in turn created in collisions between [[electron]]s and [[positron]]s. The experiments analyzed X-rays from several [[Atomic electron transition|electronic transitions]] in kaonic hydrogen.

Unlike in the [[hydrogen atom]], where the binding between electron and proton is dominated by the [[electromagnetic interaction]], kaons and protons interact also to a large extent by the [[strong interaction]].
In kaonic hydrogen this strong contribution was found to be repulsive, shifting the ground state energy by 283&amp;nbsp;±&amp;nbsp;36&amp;nbsp;(statistical)&amp;nbsp;±&amp;nbsp;6&amp;nbsp;(systematic)&amp;nbsp;[[electronvolt|eV]], thus making the system unstable with a [[resonance (particle physics)|resonance width]] of 541&amp;nbsp;±&amp;nbsp;89&amp;nbsp;(stat)&amp;nbsp;±&amp;nbsp;22&amp;nbsp;(syst)&amp;nbsp;eV&lt;ref name="Dafne2011" /&gt; (decay into [[lambda baryon|Λ]][[pion|π]] and [[sigma baryon|Σ]][[pion|π]]&lt;ref&gt;Yiguang Yan, Kaonic hydrogen atom and kaon-proton scattering length, {{arXiv|0905.4818}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

Kaonic hydrogen is studied mainly because of its importance for the understanding of kaon-[[nucleon]] interactions and for testing [[quantum chromodynamics]].

Ward]] in 1960 that has broad implications in the field of [[electron]] transport. It arises frequently in theoretical models of correlated electrons, such as the [[high-temperature superconductivity|high-temperature superconductor]]s, and in [[photoemission]], where a metal's [[Fermi surface]] can be directly observed.

==Definition==

Luttinger's theorem states that '''the volume enclosed by a material's Fermi surface is directly proportional to the particle density'''.

While the theorem is an immediate result of the [[Pauli exclusion principle]] in the case of noninteracting particles, it remains true even as interactions between particles are taken into consideration provided that the appropriate definitions of Fermi surface and particle density are adopted. Specifically, in the interacting case the Fermi surface must be defined according to the criteria that
:&lt;math&gt;G(\omega=0,\,p) \to 0&lt;/math&gt;   or   &lt;math&gt;\infty,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is the single-particle [[Green's function|Green function]] in terms of [[frequency]] and [[momentum]]. Then Luttinger's theorem can be recast into the form&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;n = 2 \int_{G(\omega=0,p)&gt;0}\frac{d^D k}{(2\pi)^D}&lt;/math&gt;,
where &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is as above and &lt;math&gt;d^D k&lt;/math&gt; is the differential volume of &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-space in &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; dimensions.

The '''Gossamer Penguin''' was a solar-powered experimental aircraft created by [[Paul MacCready]]'s [[AeroVironment]].&lt;ref name=Macready/&gt;

The Penguin was a 3/4 scale version of the [[Gossamer Albatross|Gossamer Albatross II]], and had a 71&amp;nbsp;ft.(21.64 meter) wingspan and a weight, without pilot, of {{convert |68|lb |abbr=on}}. The powerplant was an [[AstroFlight]] Astro-40 electric motor, driven by a 541 watt solar panel consisting of 3920 solar cells.&lt;ref name = "SolarFlight"/&gt;

Initial test flights were performed using a 28 cell NiCad battery pack instead of a panel. The test pilot for these flights was MacCready's 13-year-old son Marshall, who weighed {{convert |80|lb |abbr=on}}.

The official pilot for the project was Janice Brown, a charter pilot with commercial, instrument, and glider ratings who weighed slightly less than {{convert | 100|lb |abbr=on}}. She flew the Penguin approximately 40 times before a {{convert | 1.95| mi |abbr=on}} public demonstration at [[NASA]]'s [[Dryden Flight Research Center]] on August 7, 1980.&lt;ref name = "nasa"/&gt;

[[Natural disaster]]s in [[Colombia]] are the result of several different '''natural hazards''' that affect the country according to its particular geographic and geologic features.&lt;!--??:, which move from potential in to an active phase, and as a result affects human activities.--&gt; Human vulnerability, exacerbated by the lack of planning or lack of appropriate [[emergency management]], and the fragility of the economy and infrastructure contribute to a high rate of financial, structural, and human losses.

Some of the natural hazards present in Colombia are:

==Geologic==

Colombia is part of the [[Pacific Ring of Fire]] and [[Andean Volcanic Belt]] due to the collision of the [[South American Plate]] and the [[Nazca Plate]].  This produces an increased risk of [[earthquake]]s and [[volcanic eruption]]s.  Some natural disasters of this type are:
*The [[1875 Cúcuta earthquake]]
*The 8.2 {{M|w}} [[1979 Tumaco earthquake|Tumaco earthquake]] shook [[Colombia]] and [[Ecuador]] with a maximum [[Mercalli intensity scale|Mercalli intensity]] of IX (''Violent''), killing 300–600, and generating a large tsunami.
*The 1982 [[Popayán]] earthquake
*The 1985 eruption of [[Nevado del Ruiz]] [[volcano]] and subsequent [[Armero tragedy]]
*The [[1994 Páez River earthquake]]
*The [[1999 Armenia earthquake]] that affected heavily the city of [[Armenia, Colombia]] in the [[Quindío]] department.

==Hydrologic==

[[Image:Colombia.A2004117.1535.250m.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Flooding in Colombia, April 2004]]

Rainfall is heaviest in the Pacific lowlands and in parts of eastern Colombia, where rain is almost a daily occurrence and rain forests predominate. Precipitation exceeds 760 centimeters annually in most of the Pacific lowlands, making this one of the wettest regions in the world. The highest average annual precipitation in the world is estimated to be in Lloro, Colombia, with 13,299&amp;nbsp;mm (523.9&amp;nbsp;inches).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/globalextremes.html Global Measured Extremes of Temperature and Precipitation]. ''[[National Climatic Data Center]]''.  August 9, 2005.  Last accessed January 18, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In eastern Colombia, it decreases from 635 centimeters in portions of the Andean piedmont to 254 centimeters eastward. Extensive areas of the Caribbean interior are permanently flooded, more because of poor drainage than because of the moderately heavy precipitation during the rainy season.
The [[Caribbean Region of Colombia]], valleys of [[Magdalena river]] and [[Cauca river]] and the eastern [[savannah]]s are prone to floods during the two main [[monsoon]] seasons (April and November).  The opposite phenomenon of [[drought]] is also frequent. January through March and July through September are the dry seasons, when abnormally dry periods cause shortage in the water supply to crops and urban centers.

==Climatic==
[[Image:Atlantic hurricane graphic.gif|thumb|180px|right|Diagram of converging and diverging winds north to the [[Caribbean Region of Colombia]]]]
{{See also|Climate of Colombia}}

The presence of coastal regions both in the Atlantic and the Pacific oceans increases the risk of [[hurricane]]s and [[tropical storm]]s. Waves in the trade winds in the Atlantic Ocean—areas of converging winds that move along the same track as the prevailing wind—create instabilities in the [[atmosphere]] that may lead to the formation of [[hurricanes]].  Some of the events of this type that have affected the country are:
*[[Tropical Storm Bret (1993)]]
*[[Hurricane Cesar-Douglas]]
*[[Hurricane Joan-Miriam]]

==Health and disease==
[[Image:Dengue06.png|right|thumb|250px|Worldwide dengue distribution, 2006. Red: Epidemic [[dengue fever]]. Blue: ''[[Aedes aegypti]]''.]]
{{See also|Medicine in Colombia}}

Some of the main public health issues in Colombia are: [[malnutrition]], [[pregnancy]]-related deaths, [[neonatal]] deaths, acute respiratory disease-related deaths in children under 5 years, [[diarrhea]]-related deaths in children under 5 years, lack of [[vaccination]]s, [[tropical diseases]] such as [[malaria]], [[dengue fever]], hemorrhagic dengue fever, [[yellow fever]], [[Chagas disease]] and [[leishmaniasis]],  poly-[[parasitism]], [[snakebite]]s and violence related causes of mortality.

'''Nuclear Power School''' is a technical school operated by the [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] in [[Goose Creek, South Carolina]] to train enlisted sailors, officers, [[Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory|KAPL]] civilians and [[Bettis Atomic Power Laboratory|Bettis]] civilians for [[United States Naval reactor|shipboard nuclear power plant]] operation and maintenance of [[naval ship|surface ships]] and [[submarine]]s in the U.S. [[nuclear navy]]. 
The United States Navy currently operates 95 total nuclear power plants including 71 submarines (each with one reactor), 10 aircraft carriers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Active [US Navy Ships] In Commission|url=http://www.nvr.navy.mil/NVRSHIPS/ACTIVE/FLEET.HTM|accessdate=18 October 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605223708/http://www.nvr.navy.mil/nvrships/active/fleet.htm|archivedate=5 June 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (each with two reactors), and 4 training/research prototype plants.

== Overview ==
[[File:NNPTC Logo.gif|left|thumb|Naval Nuclear Power Training Command Logo]]
Prospective enlisted enrollees in the Nuclear Power Program must have qualifying line scores on the [[Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery|ASVAB]] exam, may need to pass the NAPT (nuclear aptitude test), and must undergo a NACLC investigation for attaining a "Secret" [[security clearance]].  Additionally, each applicant must pass an interview with the Advanced Programs Coordinator in the associated recruiting district.

All officer students have had college-level courses in calculus and calculus-based physics. Acceptance to the officer program requires successful completion of interviews at [[Naval Reactors]] in Washington, D.C., and a final approval via a direct interview with the Director, Naval Nuclear Propulsion, a unique eight-year, [[admiral|four-star admiral]] position which was originally held by the program's founder, Admiral [[Hyman G. Rickover]].

Women were allowed into the Naval Nuclear Field from 1978 until 1980, when the Navy began only allowing men again.{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}}  With the repeal of the Combat Exclusion Law in the 1994 Defense Authorization Act, and the decision to open combatant ships to women, the Navy once again began accepting women into NNPS for duty aboard nuclear-powered surface combatant ships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://nnsa.energy.gov/naval_reactors/index.htm |title=Naval Reactors |author=National Nuclear Security Administration |accessdate=2008-09-14 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080625025446/http://nnsa.energy.gov/naval_reactors/index.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Female graduates of NNPS may serve at shore commands and on [[Nimitz Class]] aircraft carriers. Female officers may also serve aboard [[SSBN]] and [[SSGN]] submarines. The first female officers bound for submarines began training at NNPTC in late August 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2010/US/02/23/women.sub.duty/ |work=CNN |title=Navy says it is ready to end ban on women in submarines |date=2010-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Enlisted personnel graduate from Nuclear Field "A" School for rating as [[Machinist's Mate]] (MMN), [[Electrician's Mate]] (EMN), or [[Electronics Technician (United States Navy)|Electronics Technician]] (ETN) and are advanced to the rank of a Third Class Petty Officer. They then continue to Nuclear Power School. Graduates of the Nuclear Power School continue training with twenty four weeks of instruction at a [[Naval Nuclear Power School#Nuclear Power Training Unit|Nuclear Power Training Unit]]. This training involves the operation and simulated maintenance of nuclear reactor plants and steam plants. Graduates of NPTU are qualified nuclear operators and continue on to serve in the fleet, unless they are selected as a Junior Staff Instructor (JSI). JSIs go through training to be instructors at a NPTU where they will directly assist in qualifying future students. The enlisted school has a very high academic attrition rate.

Sailors in the nuclear ratings account for 3% of the enlisted Navy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://usmilitary.about.com/od/navy/l/blnukeschool.htm |work=About.com |title=U.S. Navy Nuke School |accessdate=2012-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of locations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.navsea.navy.mil/Home/NNPTC/History.aspx|title=Naval Sea Systems Command &gt; Home &gt; NNPTC &gt; History|author=|date=|website=www.navsea.navy.mil}}&lt;/ref&gt;==
Training for Fleet operators was initially conducted by civilian engineers at Idaho Falls, Idaho (1955-1958) and West Milton, New York (1955-1956). The first formal Nuclear Power School was established in New London, Connecticut in January 1956 with a pilot course offered for six officers and fourteen enlisted men.
 
Subsequent locations include [[United States Naval Training Center, Bainbridge|Naval Training Center Bainbridge]], Maryland (1956-1976); [[Mare Island Naval Shipyard|Naval Shipyard Mare Island]], California (1958-1976); [[Naval Training Center Orlando]], Florida (1976-1998) and its current location, Goose Creek, South Carolina. In 1986, Nuclear Field A School was established in Orlando to provide nuclear in-rate training to Sailors prior to attending Nuclear Power School.

In 1993, in response to the [[Base Realignment and Closure|BRAC]]-directed closure of NTC Orlando by the end of Fiscal Year 1999, the Nuclear Field A School and Nuclear Power School were joined to create Naval Nuclear Power Training Command. A move from Orlando, Florida to Goose Creek, South Carolina began in May 1998 and was completed in January 1999. Construction of the new command allowed Nuclear Field A School and Nuclear Power School to be located in the same building.

Many improvements were added to the command to improve each sailor's quality of life and the effectiveness of training. The Bachelor Enlisted Quarters include microwaves and refrigerators along with semiprivate rooms joined by a common bath. The complex also includes a galley, recreation building, and recreation fields conveniently located for the sailors' use. The NNPTC complex is fully manned with over 3,600 students and 480 staff members. Naval Health Clinic Charleston is located across NNPTC Circle from the NNPTC site and is a short walk from the main Rickover Center building.

==Curriculum==
The following topics are learned in the curriculum for all program attendees:

* [[Mathematics]]
* [[Calculus-based physics]]
* [[Fluid Dynamics]]
* [[Applied Hydraulics]]
* [[Nuclear physics]]
* [[Electric power|Electrical power theory]] and [[Electricity generation|generating equipment]]
* [[Nuclear reactor technology]]
* [[Thermodynamics]]
* [[Heat Transfer]]
* [[Chemistry]]
* [[Materials science]] and [[metallurgy]]
* [[Health physics]]
* [[Nuclear reactor physics|Reactor principles]]
* [[Nuclear reactor avoidance|Reactor ethics]]

Even more intensive than the enlisted course, the officer course involves extensive post-calculus mathematical examination of reactor dynamics.  Officers cover all topics in equal depth, whereas enlisted training is specialized for each student's job [[Naval rating|rating]] (with significant cross-training in the remaining "nuke" specialties). The officer course also assumes students have undergraduate engineering or science degrees.&lt;sup&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100527044657/http://www.navy.com/navy/careers/nuclear-energy/submarine-warfare-nuclear.html]&lt;/sup&gt;

The nuclear program is widely acknowledged as having the most demanding academic program in the U.S. military. The school operates at a fast pace, with stringent academic standards in all subjects. Students typically spend 45 hours per week in the classroom, and are required to study an additional 10 to 35 hours per week outside lecture hours, five days per week. Because the classified materials are restricted from leaving the training building, students cannot study outside the classroom.

Students who fail tests and otherwise struggle academically are required to review their performance with instructors. The student may be given remedial homework or other study requirements. Failing scores due to personal negligence, rather than a lack of ability, can result in charges of ''dereliction of duty'' under the [[Uniform Code of Military Justice]]. Failing students may be held back to repeat the coursework with a new group of classmates, but such students are typically released from the Nuclear Power Program and are re-designated or discharged.

==College credit (enlisted training)==
The American Council of Education recommends an average of 60-80 semester-hours of college credit, in the lower-division baccalaureate/associate degree category, for completion of the entire curriculum including both Nuclear Field "A" School and Naval Nuclear Power School. The variation in total amount depends on the specific pipeline completed&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; MM, EM, or ET. Further, under the Servicemembers Opportunity Colleges degree program for the Navy ([http://www.soc.aascu.org/socnav/Default.html SOCNAV]), the residency requirements at these civilian institutions are reduced to only 10-25%, allowing a student to take as little as 9 units of coursework (typically 3 courses) through the degree-granting institution to complete their Associate in Applied Science degree in nuclear engineering technology or as much as 40 units to complete a Bachelor in Nuclear Engineering Technology degree.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

The following select colleges offer college credit and degree programs to graduates of the U.S. Naval Nuclear Power School ([http://www.navy.com/joining/college-options/nupoc.html NUPOC]),.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.navy.com/joining/college-options/nupoc.html |title=NUPOC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nuclear Power Training Unit==
Nuclear Power Training Unit (NPTU), one of which is also located at the former [[Naval Weapons Station Charleston]], has two decommissioned submarines, [[USS Daniel Webster (SSBN-626)|ex-''Daniel Webster'' (MTS-626)]] and [[USS Sam Rayburn (SSBN-635)|ex-''Sam Rayburn'' (MTS-635)]]. These moored training ships have their missile compartments removed, but have fully operational [[S5W reactor]] power plants. Both of these training ships are equipped with a diesel-powered Supplemental Water Injection System (SWIS) to provide emergency cooling water in the event of an accident.

''[[USS La Jolla (SSN-701)]]'' was placed in commissioned (Reserve, Stand down) status in February 2015 for conversion to a Moored Training Ship (MTS).  The conversion is expected to take 32 months according to the Commanding Officer. During that time, the submarine will be cut into three pieces, and a portion of the hull will be taken out. Three new hull sections from General Dynamics Electric Boat will be added to accommodate the sub’s new mission. A newly fabricated hull section will be welded in place, and the new space will contain training spaces, office spaces, and a Supplemental Water Injection System (SWIS) to provide emergency cooling water in the event of an accident. The future MTS-701 will be permanently moored at Nuclear Power Training Unit (NTPU) at Naval Support Activity Charleston in South Carolina.

''La Jolla'' is the first [[Los_Angeles-class_submarine |Los Angeles-class]] boat to undergo the conversion to a training ship and will be followed by the ''[[USS San Francisco (SSN-711)]]'' about two years later, according to the Navy’s long-range ship decommissioning plans.

Two land-based reactor prototypes are based at the [[Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory]], Kenneth A. Kesselring Site Operation, in [[Ballston Spa, New York]]. These are the MARF/[[S7G reactor|S7G]] and the [[S8G]] Trident prototypes.  (The S8G core has now been replaced with the [[S6W reactor]] core).  At one time, two additional prototypes were operational: [[D1G reactor|D1G]] and [[S3G reactor|S3G]].

===NPTU History===
Knolls Atomic Power Laboratory in New York has the longest operational history of NPTUs. However, two other sites also provided operational training during the [[Cold War]].

From the early 1950s to the mid-1990s, [[Naval Reactors Facility]] (NRF) in Idaho trained nearly 40,000 Navy personnel in surface and submarine nuclear power plant operations with three nuclear propulsion prototypes&amp;nbsp;&amp;mdash; [[A1W reactor|A1W]], [[S1W reactor|S1W]], and [[S5G reactor|S5G]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.idahonews.com/special/siteofimpact/story.php?accession=1001-01272008
|title=Cleaning house and charting a future at INL 
|author=Paul Menser }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1959 until 1993, over 14,000 Naval operators were trained at the [[S1C reactor|S1C]] prototype at [[Windsor, Connecticut]] including President Carter.

'''Peter Droege''' Prof. Peter Droege

DI (TUM) MAAS (MIT) ISDE
Overview: policy, design, planning and training background

Peter Droege is an international urban sustainability expert and experienced mind on advanced urban policy, management, design, planning and renewable infrastructure development – and the director of the Liechtenstein Institutes for Strategic Development (http://www.eurisd.org and http://www.eurisd.de). He is particularly knowledgeable in International Building Exhibitions (IBA), especially from an urban sustainability point of view. He holds a Conjoint Professorship at the University of Newcastle’s School of Architecture and Built Environment and has developed a Chair for Sustainable Spatial Development at the University of Liechtenstein. Peter Droege’s academic career stretches from the School of Architecture and Planning at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and his position at the University of Tokyo as Urban Development Engineering Endowed Chair to his position as Lend Lease Chair and Professor of Urban Design at the University of Sydney, to the University of Liechtenstein.
 
Award winning author and editor of seminal books on city futures, resilience, regenerative design, energy and climate

A recipient of the European Solar Prize, Peter Droege not only produced the major textbook on space and IT, Intelligent Environments (Elsevier 1998), but also has become an influential author and editor of seminal books on transforming the urban system: “The Renewable City” (Wiley 2006), “Urban Energy Transition” (Elsevier 2008), “100 Percent Renewable” (Routledge 2012, Earthscan 2009), “Climate Design” (ORO Editions 2010), “Regenerative Region” (Oekom 2014) as well as chapters in the new “Handbook of Architectural Theory” (Sage 2011), “Encyclopedia of Energy” (Elsevier 2004), “The New Blackwell Guide to the City” (Blackwell 2011), “Sustainable Urbanism and Beyond” (Rizzoli 2012), and “Superlux” (Thames and Hudson 2015). These findings and ideas combined with his projects led Peter Droege to serve as sustainability innovation advisor to the City of Zurich’s Urban Design Department, Principal Advisor to Beijing’s Municipal Institute for City Planning and Design, be elected as President of Eurosolar, appointed as General Chairman of the World Council for Renewable Energy, and be invited as inaugural Selection Committee member of Masdar’s Zayed Future Energy Prize. In June 2016 Peter Droege was commissioned by the world’ largest science publisher, Elsevier, to develop a second edition of his 2008 bestseller, Urban Energy Transition: From Fossil Fuel to Renewable Power, to be published in 2018 as Urban Energy Trantion, 2nd Edition - Handbook for Cities and Regions.
 
International ecological and renewable energy based urban management, planning and design expertise

Peter Droege initiated in 2007 the ‘Renewable Wilhelmsburg’ theme of the International Building Exhibition IBA-Hamburg, and advised the organisation on energy and climate design and planning issues. Peter Droege has long pursued the innovative IBA Bodensee / International Building Exhibition Lake Constance development initiative, the first IBA based on universal sustainable lifestyle and metro-regional best practice across all scales and types of intervention. Peter Droege is also a highly valued urban sustainabiliy policy and governance advisor for organisiations as varied as UNDP, UNCHS, UNECE, Australian, German, Vietnamese and Indonesian governments, and has also long been active in Japan and China, winning a number of important competitions.

In [[aerodynamics]], '''pitch-up''' is a severe form of [[Stall (flight)|stall]] in an [[aircraft]]. It is directly related to inherent properties of all [[swept wing]]s, and seen primarily on those platforms. Unlike conventional low-speed stalls, pitch-up can occur at any speed, and are especially dangerous when they take place in the [[transonic]]; at these speeds the aerodynamic loads can become so high as to break up the aircraft, as occurred in 1964 when a [[Republic F-105 Thunderchief|F-105 Thunderchief]] of the [[USAF Thunderbirds]] broke up in mid-air.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.check-six.com/Crash_Sites/Thunderbirds_F-105_crash_site.htm "The Crash of the Thunderbirds' F-105B"]&lt;/ref&gt; It can also occur at low speeds, in which case it has been called a '''Sabre dance''', a particularly dangerous behaviour of swept wings that became apparent during the development of the [[USAF]] [[F-100 Super Sabre]].

==History==
Pitch-up problems were first noticed on high-speed test aircraft with swept wings. It was a common problem on the [[Douglas Skyrocket]], which was used extensively to test the problem.

Before the pitch-up phenomenon was well understood, it plagued all early swept-wing aircraft. In the [[F-100 Super Sabre]] it even got its own name, the [[Sabre dance (pitch-up)|Sabre dance]]. In aircraft with high-mounted tailplanes, like the [[F-101 Voodoo]], recovery was especially difficult because the tailplane was placed directly in the wing wake during the pitch-up, causing [[Stall (flight)#Deep stall|deep stall]] (although the T-tail was meant to prevent pitch-up from starting in the first place). Deployment of the braking parachute and a considerable height above the ground were essential for a chance at recovery.

==Description==
[[File:MiG-17F Top View.JPG|right|thumb|The MiG-17 mounts its wing forward in order to place the center of pressure near the balance point of the aircraft. To control span wise flow, it included prominent [[wing fence]]s.]]

Wings generate a relatively complex pattern of forces at different points on their planform. These are usually described as lift and drag components, using vector decomposition. If these vectors are added up for the entire wing, the result is a single force acting at some point on the wing. This point is known as the "[[Center of pressure (fluid mechanics)|center of pressure]]", or CoP, and is normally located somewhere between ⅓ and ½ of the way back from the [[leading edge]]. The exact location changes with changes in the [[angle of attack]], which leads to the requirement to [[Trim (aircraft)|trim]] aircraft as they change their speed or power settings.&lt;ref name=ion&gt;Ion Paraschivoiu, [https://books.google.com/books?id=8yMUi31pKDIC&amp;pg=PA33 "Subsonic Aerodynamics"], Presses inter Polytechnique, 2003, §1.9&lt;/ref&gt;

Another major consideration for aircraft design is a similar vector addition of all of the weight terms of the parts of the aircraft, including the wing. This too can be reduced to a single weight term acting at some point along the [[Aircraft principal axes|longitudinal axis]] of the aircraft, the "[[center of gravity]]", or CoG. If the wing is positioned so its CoP lies near CoG for the aircraft, in level flight the wing will lift the aircraft straight up. This reduces any net forces pitching the aircraft up or down, but for a number of reasons the two points are normally slightly separated and a small amount of force from the [[flight control surfaces]] is used to balance this out.&lt;ref name=ion/&gt;

The same basic layout is desirable for an aircraft with a swept wing as well. On a conventional rectangular wing, the CoP meets the aircraft at the point on the chord running directly out from the root. While the same analysis will reveal a center of pressure point for a swept wing, its location may be considerably behind the leading edge ''measured at the root of the wing''. For highly swept planforms, the CoP may lie behind the [[trailing edge]] of the wing root, requiring the wing to meet the aircraft at a seemingly far-forward location.&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm Abzug &amp; Eugene Larrabee, "Airplane Stability and Control", Cambridge University Press, 2005, p. 179&lt;/ref&gt;

In this case of a swept wing, changes to the CoP with angle of attack may be magnified.&lt;ref name=stability&gt;Malcolm Abzug &amp; Eugene Larrabee, "Airplane Stability and Control", Cambridge University Press, 2005, p. 177&lt;/ref&gt;

The introduction of swept wings took place during a move to more highly tapered designs as well. Although it had long been known that an elliptical planform is "perfect" from an [[induced drag]] standpoint, it was also noticed that a linear taper of the wing had much the same effect, while being lighter. Research during the war&lt;ref&gt;Eastman Jacobs, [http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a800824.pdf  "Tapered Wings, Tip Stalling, And Preliminary Results From Tests Of The Stall-Control Flap"], NACA, 13 May 1947&lt;/ref&gt; led to widespread use of taper, especially in the post-war era. However, it had been noticed early on that such designs had unfavourable stall characteristics; as the tips were more highly loaded in high angles of attack, they operated closer to their stall point.

Although this effect was unfavourable in a conventional straight wing aircraft, on a swept-wing design it had unexpected and dangerous results. When the tips stall on a swept wing, the center of pressure, the average lift point for the wing as a whole, moves forward. This is because the section still generating considerable lift is further forward. This causes further nose-up force, increasing the angle of attack and causing more of the tip area to stall. This may lead to a chain reaction that causes violent nose-up pitching of the aircraft.

This effect first noticed in the [[Douglas D-558-2 Skyrocket]] in August 1949, when a 0.6 G turn suddenly increased out of control to 6 G. This was not entirely surprising; the effect had been seen earlier in [[wind tunnel]] simulations.&lt;ref name=stability/&gt; These effects can be seen at any speed; in the Skyrocket they occurred primarily in the transonic (the Weil-Gray criteria) but with more highly swept and tapered planforms, like on the [[North American F-100 Super Sabre]], the effect was common at low speeds as well (the Furlong-McHugh boundary), when the aircraft flew at higher angles of attack in order to maintain lift at low speeds.&lt;ref name=nasa&gt;Kenneth Spreemann, [http://thehuwaldtfamily.org/jtrl/research/Aircraft%20Stability%20and%20Control/NACA-™-X-26,%20Design%20Guide%20for%20Pitch-Up%20Evaluation%20and%20Investigation%20at%20High%20Subsonic%20Speeds,%201961.pdf "Design Guide For Pitch-Up Evaluation And Investigation At High Subsonic Speeds Of Possible Limitations Due To Wing-Aspect-Ratio Variations"], NASA ™ X-26, 1959, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, swept wings tend to generate span wise flow of the [[boundary layer]], causing some of the airflow to move "sideways" along the wing. This occurs all along the wing, but as one moves towards the tip the sideways flow increases, as it includes both the contribution of the wing at that point, as well as span wise flow from points closer to the root. This effect takes time to build up, at higher speeds the span wise flow tends to be blown off the back of the wing before it has time to become serious. At lower speeds, however, this can lead to a considerable buildup of the [[boundary layer]] at the wing tip, adding to the problems noted above.&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm Abzug &amp; Eugene Larrabee, "Airplane Stability and Control", Cambridge University Press, 2005, p. 174&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, while not directly related to the effects above, it was common during the early jet age to use [[T-tail]] designs in order to keep the aerodynamic surfaces well clear of the jet engine area. In this case it is possible for a pitch-up event to cause the turbulent air behind the wing to flow across the horizontal stabilizer, making it difficult or impossible to apply nose-down pressure to counteract the pitch-up. Aircraft with low-mounted tail surfaces did not suffer from this effect, and in fact improved their control authority as the wing's wake cleared the controls surfaces, flowing above it. This was not always enough to correct for the problem, however; the F-86 continued to suffer from pitch-up in spite of increasing nose-down pressure from the tail surfaces.&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm Abzug &amp; Eugene Larrabee, "Airplane Stability and Control", Cambridge University Press, 2005, p. 178&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mitigation==
[[File:Canadian CF-18.jpg|right|thumb|Washout (aviation)|[[Washout (aviation)|Washout]] is clearly visible in this image of a CF-18 Hornet. Note the angle of the Sidewinder missile on the wingtip rail as compared to the angle of attack of the fuselage.]]

As the primary causes of the pitch-up problem are due to spanwise flow and more loading at the tips, measures to address these issues can eliminate the problem. In early designs these were typically "add-ons" to an otherwise conventional wing planform, but in modern designs this is part of the overall wing design and normally controlled via the existing [[high-lift device]]s.

The first known attempt to address these problems took place on the platform where they were first noticed, the Douglas Skyrocket. This took the form of a series of [[vortex generator]]s added to the outboard portions of the wing, breaking up the boundary layer. However, this was found to have almost no effect in practice. Nevertheless, a similar solution was attempted on the [[Boeing B-47 Stratojet]] where it proved considerably more effective. This may have been helped by the presence of the [[podded engine]]s, whose vertical mountings acted as barriers to span wise flow.

More common solutions to the problem of spanwise flow is the use of a [[wing fence]] or the related dogtooth notch on the leading edge of the wing. This disrupts the flow and re-directs it rearward, while also causing the buildup of stagnant air inboard to lower the stall point. This does have an effect on overall airflow on the wing, and is generally not used where the sweep is mild.

To address the problems with spanwise loading, a wider variety of techniques have been used, including dedicated [[Leading edge slats|slats]] or flaps, the use of [[Washout (aviation)|washout]] or automated control of the [[aileron]]s. An unusual solution tried on the [[XF-91 Thunderceptor]] prototype fighter was to give the wingtips a wider [[Chord (aircraft)|chord]] than the wing roots. The idea was to increase wingtip efficiency and cause the wing roots to stall first.

[[Angle of attack]] sensors on the aircraft can also detect when the angle of attack approaches the attitude known to result in pitch-up and activate devices like the [[stick shaker]] to warn the pilot, and the [[stick pusher]] which overpowers the pilot and forces the nose of the aircraft down to a safer angle of attack. Twist or [[Washout (aviation)|washout]] built into the wingtips can also alleviate pitch-up. In effect, the angle of attack at the wingtip becomes smaller than elsewhere on the wing, meaning that the inboard portions of the wing will stall first.

A commonly used solution to pitch-up in modern combat aircraft is to use a [[Canard (aeronautics)#Control-canard|control-canard]].&lt;ref&gt;Raymer, Daniel P. (1989), ''Aircraft Design: A Conceptual Approach'', Section 4.5 - Tail geometry and arrangement. American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc., Washington, DC. {{ISBN|0-930403-51-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another modern solution to pitch-up is the use of slats. When slats are extended they increase wing camber and increase maximum [[lift coefficient]].&lt;ref&gt;Clancy, L.J. (1975), ''Aerodynamics'', Section 6.9&lt;/ref&gt;

Pitch-up is also possible in aircraft with [[forward-swept wing]]s as used on the [[Grumman X-29]]. With forward-swept wings the span wise flow is inboard, causing the wing root to stall before the wingtip. Although at first glance it would appear that this would cause pitch-''down'' problems, the extreme rear mounting of the wing means that when the root stalls the lift moves forward, towards the tips.

==Sabre dance==
When a swept wing starts to stall, the outermost portions tend to stall first. Since these portions are behind the [[center of lift]], the overall lift force moves forward, pitching the nose of the aircraft upwards. This leads to a higher [[angle of attack]] and causes more of the wing to stall, which exacerbates the problem. The pilot often loses control, with fatal results at low altitude because there was insufficient time for the pilot to regain control or [[ejection seat|eject]] before hitting the ground. A large number of aircraft were lost to this phenomenon during landing, which left aircraft tumbling onto the runway, often in flames.

One of the most notorious incidents was the loss of F-100C-20-NA [[F-100 Super Sabre|Super Sabre]] 54-1907 and its pilot during an attempted emergency landing at [[Edwards AFB]], [[California]] on January 10, 1956. By chance, this particular incident was recorded in detail on [[16 mm film]] by cameras set up to cover an unrelated test. The pilot fought desperately to regain control due to faulty landing technique,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sabredance.net/officialaccidentreport.htm&lt;/ref&gt; finally rolling and yawing to the right before striking the ground with the fuselage turned approximately 90 degrees to the line of flight. Anderson,1993&lt;ref&gt;http://ftp.rta.nato.int/public//PubFulltext/RTO/TR/RTO-TR-029///TR-029-$$ALL.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; states the F-100 was noticeably underpowered for its day and had very pronounced "backside" tendencies if airspeed was allowed to decay too much.

The brand new F-100C was flown by Lt. Barty R. Brooks, a native of [[Martha, Oklahoma]] and a [[Texas A&amp;M]] graduate, of the 1708th Ferrying Wing, Detachment 12, [[Kelly AFB]], [[Texas]]. The aircraft was one of three being delivered from North American's [[Palmdale, California|Palmdale]] plant to [[George AFB]], California, but the nose gear pivot pin worked loose, allowing the wheel to swivel at random, so he diverted to Edwards, which had a longer runway.&lt;ref name="historynet.com"&gt;[http://www.historynet.com/deadly-sabre-dance.htm Deadly Sabre Dance&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; On approach, at a high angle of attack, the fighter exceeded its flight envelope, and, too far into stall condition, lost directional control with fatal results. These scenes were inserted in the movie ''[[The Hunters (1958 film)|The Hunters]]'', starring [[Robert Mitchum]] and [[Robert Wagner]], in the movie ''[[X-15 (film)|X-15]]'' with actor [[Charles Bronson]] playing the pilot, and in the Made for TV film ''Red Flag: The Ultimate Game'', although in ''The Hunters'' and in ''Red Flag: The Ultimate Game'', the aircraft supposedly represented were respectively an [[North American F-86 Sabre|F-86]] and an [[Northrop F-5|F-5E]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150810235933/http://www.ameliaslanding.com/the_sabre_dance.htm The Sabre Dance&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The incident was also commemorated in the fighter pilot song "Give Me Operations" (set to the tune of the California Gold Rush song "What Was Your Name in the States?"):&lt;ref&gt;Ives, Burl, "Burl Ives Song Book", Ballantine Books, Inc., New York, November 1953, page 240.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lichtenberg figure in block of Plexiglas.jpg|thumb|right|[[Lichtenberg figure]]: high voltage dielectric breakdown in an acrylic polymer block]]
'''Poly(methyl methacrylate)''' ('''PMMA'''), also known as '''acrylic''' or '''acrylic glass''' as well as by the trade names '''Crylux''', '''Plexiglas''', '''Acrylite''', '''Lucite''', and '''Perspex''' among several others (see below), is a [[transparency (optics)|transparent]] [[thermoplastic]] often used in sheet form as a lightweight or shatter-resistant alternative to [[soda-lime glass|glass]].  The same material can be used as a casting resin, in inks and coatings, and has many other uses.

Although not a type of familiar [[silica]]-based glass, the substance, like many thermoplastics, is often technically classified as a type of [[glass]] (in that it is a non-crystalline vitreous substance) hence its occasional historical designation as ''acrylic glass''. Chemically, it is the [[list of synthetic polymers|synthetic polymer]] of [[methyl methacrylate]]. The material was developed in 1928 in several different laboratories by many chemists, such as William Chalmers, [[Otto Röhm]], and Walter Bauer, and was first brought to market in 1933 by the [[Rohm and Haas|Rohm and Haas Company]] under the [[trademark]] Plexiglas.

PMMA is an economical alternative to [[polycarbonate]] (PC) when [[tensile strength]], [[flexural strength]], [[Transparency and translucency|transparency]], polishability, and UV tolerance are more important than [[impact strength]], chemical resistance and heat resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hydrosight.com/acrylic-vs-polycarbonate-a-quantitative-and-qualitative-comparison/|title=Acrylic vs. Polycarbonate: A quantitative and qualitative comparison|author=Hydrosight|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170119194950/http://www.hydrosight.com/acrylic-vs-polycarbonate-a-quantitative-and-qualitative-comparison/|archivedate=2017-01-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, PMMA does not contain the potentially harmful [[bisphenol-A]] subunits found in polycarbonate. It is often preferred because of its moderate properties, easy handling and processing, and low cost. Non-modified PMMA behaves in a brittle manner when under load, especially under an [[impact (mechanics)|impact force]], and is more prone to scratching than conventional inorganic glass, but modified PMMA is sometimes able to achieve high scratch and impact resistance.

==History==
The first acrylic acid was created in 1843. [[Methacrylic acid]], derived from [[acrylic acid]], was formulated in 1865. The reaction between methacrylic acid and [[methanol]] results in the ester methyl methacrylate. Polymethyl methacrylate was discovered in the early 1930s by British chemists Rowland Hill and John Crawford at [[Imperial Chemical Industries]] (ICI) in England. ICI registered the product under the trademark Perspex. About the same time, chemist and industrialist [[Otto Röhm]] of Rohm and Haas AG in Germany attempted to produce safety glass by polymerizing methyl methacrylate between two layers of glass. The polymer separated from the glass as a clear plastic sheet, which Röhm gave the trademarked name Plexiglas in 1933. Both Perspex and Plexiglas were commercialized in the late 1930s. In the United States, E.I. du Pont de Nemours &amp; Company (now DuPont Company) subsequently introduced its own product under the trademark Lucite. In 1936 ICI Acrylics (now Lucite International) began the first commercially viable production of acrylic safety glass. During World War II both Allied and Axis forces used acrylic glass for submarine periscopes and aircraft windshields, canopies, and gun turrets.  Airplane pilots whose eyes were damaged by flying shards of PMMA fared much better than those injured by standard glass, demonstrating better compatibility between human tissue and PMMA than glass.&lt;ref name="Schwarcz2012"&gt;{{citation|author=Schwarcz, Joe|title=The Right Chemistry: 108 Enlightening, Nutritious, Health-Conscious and Occasionally Bizarre Inquiries into the Science of Daily Life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ar_wkXGvB8UC&amp;pg=PT226|date=6 November 2012|publisher=Doubleday Canada|isbn=978-0-385-67160-6|page=226|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160420210611/https://books.google.com/books?id=Ar_wkXGvB8UC&amp;pg=PT226|archivedate=20 April 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Civilian applications followed after the war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.britannica.com/science/polymethyl-methacrylate |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-05-22 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171031004312/https://www.britannica.com/science/polymethyl-methacrylate |archivedate=2017-10-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synthesis==
PMMA is routinely produced by [[emulsion polymerization]], [[solution polymerization]], and [[bulk polymerization]]. Generally, radical initiation is used (including [[living polymerization]] methods), but anionic polymerization of PMMA can also be performed. To produce {{convert|1|kg|abbr=on}} of PMMA, about {{convert|2|kg|abbr=on}} of [[petroleum]] is needed.{{citation needed|reason=Since the C and H are preserved, and oxygen is added, it should be less than 1|date=May 2016}} PMMA produced by [[radical polymerization]] (all commercial PMMA) is [[atactic]] and completely amorphous.

==Processing==
The [[glass transition temperature]] (''T&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;'') of [[Tacticity|atactic]] PMMA is {{convert|105|C|F}}.  The ''T&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;'' values of commercial grades of PMMA range from {{convert |85|to|165|C|F}}; the range is so wide because of the vast number of commercial compositions which are copolymers with co-monomers other than methyl methacrylate.  PMMA is thus an organic glass at room temperature; i.e., it is below its ''T&lt;sub&gt;g&lt;/sub&gt;''.  The forming temperature starts at the glass transition temperature and goes up from there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Ashby | first = Michael F. | author-link = Michael F. Ashby | title = Materials Selection in Mechanical Design | publisher = Elsevier | year = 2005 | edition = 3rd | isbn = 978-0-7506-6168-3 |page=519}}&lt;/ref&gt;  All common molding processes may be used, including [[injection molding]], [[compression molding]], and [[extrusion]].  The highest quality PMMA sheets are produced by [[cell casting]], but in this case, the polymerization and molding steps occur concurrently.  The strength of the material is higher than molding grades owing to its extremely high [[molecular mass]].  [[Rubber toughening]] has been used to increase the toughness of PMMA to overcome its brittle behavior in response to applied loads.

==Handling, cutting, and joining==
PMMA can be joined using [[cyanoacrylate]] cement (commonly known as [[superglue]]), with heat (welding), or by using solvents such as [[dichloromethane|di-]] or [[chloroform|trichloromethane]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.science-projects.com/Plastics/PlexiglasWork.htm "Working with Plexiglas&lt;SUP&gt;&amp;®&lt;/SUP&gt;"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150221110921/http://www.science-projects.com/Plastics/PlexiglasWork.htm |date=2015-02-21 }}. ''science-projects.com''.&lt;/ref&gt; to dissolve the plastic at the joint, which then fuses and sets, forming an almost invisible [[solvent welding|weld]]. Scratches may easily be removed by polishing or by heating the surface of the material.

[[Laser cutting]] may be used to form intricate designs from PMMA sheets. PMMA vaporizes to gaseous compounds (including its monomers) upon laser cutting, so a very clean cut is made, and cutting is performed very easily. However, the pulsed lasercutting introduces high internal stresses along the cut edge, which on exposure to solvents produce undesirable "stress-crazing" at the cut edge and several millimetres deep. Even ammonium-based glass-cleaner and almost everything short of soap-and-water produces similar undesirable crazing, sometimes over the entire surface of the cut parts, at great distances from the stressed edge.&lt;ref name=hjsandersen&gt;{{cite web|last1=Andersen|first1=Hans J|title=Tensions in acrylics when laser cutting|url=http://www.support.induflex.dk/Plast_Laserskaering_acryl.aspx?Lang=en-GB#lblTensions|accessdate=23 December 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208045021/http://www.support.induflex.dk/Plast_Laserskaering_acryl.aspx?Lang=en-GB#lblTensions|archivedate=8 December 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Annealing the PMMA sheet/parts is therefore an obligatory post-processing step when intending to chemically bond lasercut parts together.

In the majority of applications, it will not shatter. Rather, it breaks into large dull pieces. Since PMMA is softer and more easily scratched than glass, [[Anti-scratch coating|scratch-resistant coatings]] are often added to PMMA sheets to protect it (as well as possible other functions).

[[Methyl methacrylate]] "[[synthetic resin]]" for casting (simply the bulk liquid chemical) may be used in conjunction with a polymerization catalyst such as [[MEKP]], to produce hardened transparent PMMA in any shape, from a mold. Objects like insects or coins, or even dangerous chemicals in breakable quartz ampules, may be embedded in such "cast" blocks, for display and safe handling.

===Modification of properties===
Pure poly(methyl methacrylate) homopolymer is rarely sold as an end product, since it is not optimized for most applications. Rather, modified formulations with varying amounts of other comonomers, additives, and fillers are created for uses where specific properties are required. For example,
* A small amount of acrylate comonomers are routinely used in PMMA grades destined for heat processing, since this stabilizes the polymer to [[depolymerization]] ("unzipping") during processing.
* Comonomers such as butyl acrylate are often added to improve impact strength.
* Comonomers such as methacrylic acid can be added to increase the glass transition temperature of the polymer for higher temperature use such as in lighting applications.
* Plasticizers may be added to improve processing properties, lower the glass transition temperature, or improve impact properties.
* Dyes may be added to give color for decorative applications, or to protect against (or filter) UV light.
* Fillers may be added to improve cost-effectiveness.

Being transparent and durable, PMMA is a versatile material and has been used in a wide range of fields and applications such as rear-lights and instrument clusters for vehicles, appliances, and lenses for glasses. PMMA in the form of sheets affords to shatter resistant panels for building windows, skylights, bulletproof security barriers, signs &amp; displays, sanitary ware (bathtubs), LCD screens, furniture and many other applications.  It is also used for coating polymers based on MMA provides outstanding stability against environmental conditions with reduced emission of VOC.

In particular, acrylic-type contact lenses are useful for cataract surgery in patients that have recurrent ocular inflammation (uveitis), as acrylic material induces less inflammation. 
* [[Glasses|Eyeglass]] lenses are commonly made from PMMA.
* Historically, hard [[contact lens]]es were frequently made of this material. Soft contact lenses are often made of a related polymer, where acrylate monomers containing one or more [[hydroxyl|hydroxyl group]]s make them [[hydrophile|hydrophilic]].
*In [[orthopedic surgery]], PMMA [[bone cement]] is used to affix implants and to remodel lost bone. It is supplied as a powder with liquid methyl methacrylate (MMA). Although PMMA is biologically compatible, MMA is considered to be an irritant and a possible [[carcinogen]]. PMMA has also been linked to [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation|cardiopulmonary]] events in the operating room due to [[hypotension]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Timothy J. |last1=Kaufmann |first2=Mary E. |last2=Jensen |first3=Gabriele |last3=Ford |first4=Lena L. |last4=Gill |first5=William F. |last5=Marx |first6=David F. |last6=Kallmes |title=Cardiovascular Effects of Polymethylmethacrylate Use in Percutaneous Vertebroplasty |journal=American Journal of Neuroradiology |pmid=11950651 |url=http://www.ajnr.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=11950651 |date=2002-04-01 |volume=23 |issue=4 |pages=601–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bone cement acts like a [[grout]] and not so much like a glue in [[arthroplasty]]. Although sticky, it does not bond to either the bone or the implant, it primarily fills the spaces between the prosthesis and the bone preventing motion. A disadvantage of this bone cement is that it heats up to {{Convert|82.5|C|F}} while setting that may cause thermal necrosis of neighboring tissue. A careful balance of initiators and monomers is needed to reduce the rate of polymerization, and thus the heat generated.
*In [[plastic surgery|cosmetic surgery]], tiny PMMA microspheres suspended in some biological fluid are injected as a soft tissue filler under the skin to reduce wrinkles or scars permanently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Filling in Wrinkles Safely|url=http://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ConsumerUpdates/ucm049349.htm|publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration|accessdate=8 December 2015|date=February 28, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151121160450/http://www.fda.gov/ForConsumers/ConsumerUpdates/ucm049349.htm|archivedate=21 November 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; PMMA as a soft tissue filler was widely used in the beginning of the century to restore volume in patients with HIV-related facial wasting. PMMA is used illegally to shape muscles by some [[Bodybuilding|bodybuilders]]. 
*[[Plombage]] is an outdated treatment of [[tuberculosis]] where the [[pleural]] space around an infected [[lung]] was filled with PMMA balls, in order to compress and collapse the affected lung. 
*Emerging biotechnology and [[Medical research|Biomedical research]] uses PMMA to create [[microfluidics|microfluidic]] [[lab-on-a-chip]] devices, which require 100 micrometre-wide geometries for routing liquids. These small geometries are amenable to using PMMA in a [[biochip]] fabrication process and offers moderate [[biocompatibility]].
*[[Bioprocess]] [[chromatography]] columns use cast acrylic tubes as an alternative to glass and stainless steel. These are pressure rated and satisfy stringent requirements of materials for [[biocompatibility]], toxicity and extractables.

=== Uses in dentistry ===
Due to its aforementioned biocompatibility, Poly(methyl methacrylate) is a commonly used material in modern dentistry, particularly in the fabrication of dental prosthetics, artificial teeth, and orthodontic appliances.

* '''Acrylic Prosthetic''' '''Construction''': Pre-polymerized, powdered PMMA spheres are mixed with a Methyl Methacrylate liquid monomer, Benzoyl Peroxide (initiator), and NN-Dimethyl-P-Toluidine (accelerator), and placed under heat and pressure to produce a hardened polymerized PMMA structure. Through the use of injection molding techniques, wax based designs with artificial teeth set in predetermined positions built on gypsum stone models of patients' mouths can be converted into functional prosthetics used to replace missing dentition. PMMA polymer and methyl methacrylate monomer mix is then injected into a flask containing a gypsum mold of the previously designed prosthesis, and placed under heat to initiate polymerization process. Pressure is used during the curing process to minimize polymerization shrinkage, ensuring an accurate fit of the prosthesis. Though other methods of polymerizing PMMA for prosthetic fabrication exist, such as chemical and microwave resin activation, the previously described heat-activated resin polymerization technique is the most commonly used due to its cost effectiveness and minimal polymerization shrinkage. 
* '''Artificial''' '''Teeth''': While denture teeth can be made of several different materials, PMMA is a material of choice for the manufacturing of artificial teeth used in dental prosthetics. Mechanical properties of the material allow for heightened control of aesthetics, easy surface adjustments, decreased risk of fracture when in function in the oral cavity, and minimal wear against opposing teeth. Additionally, since the bases of dental prosthetics are often constructed using PMMA, adherence of PMMA denture teeth to PMMA denture bases is unparalleled, leading to the construction of a strong and durable prosthetic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Prosthodontic treatment for edentulous patients : complete dentures and implant-supported prostheses|date=2013|publisher=Elsevier Mosby|others=Zarb, George A.

* [[Acrylic paint]] essentially consists of PMMA suspended in water; however since PMMA is [[hydrophobe|hydrophobic]], a substance with both hydrophobic and hydrophilic groups needs to be added to facilitate the [[suspension (chemistry)|suspension]].
* Modern [[furniture]] makers, especially in the 1960s and 1970s, seeking to give their products a space age aesthetic, incorporated Lucite and other PMMA products into their designs, especially office chairs. Many other products (for example, guitars) are sometimes made with acrylic glass to make the commonly opaque objects translucent.
* Perspex has been used as a surface to paint on, for example by [[Salvador Dalí]].
* [[Diasec]] is a process which uses acrylic glass as a substitute for normal glass in [[picture frame]]s. This is done for its relatively low cost, light weight, shatter-resistance, aesthetics and because it can be ordered in larger sizes than standard [[picture framing glass]].
*As early as 1939, Los Angeles-based Dutch sculptor [[Jan de Swart|Jan De Swart]] experimented with samples of Lucite sent to him by DuPont; De Swart created tools to work the Lucite for sculpture and mixed chemicals to bring about certain effects of color and refraction&lt;ref&gt;de Swart, Ursula. My Life with Jan. Collection of Jock de Swart, Durango, CO&lt;/ref&gt;
* From approximately the 1960s onward, sculptors and glass artists such as [[Jan Kubíček]] and [[Leroy Lamis]] began using acrylics, especially taking advantage of the material's flexibility, light weight, cost and its capacity to refract and filter light.
* In the 1950s and 1960s, Lucite was an extremely popular material for jewelry, with several companies specialized in creating high-quality pieces from this material. Lucite beads and ornaments are still sold by jewelry suppliers. 
* Acrylic Sheets are produced in dozens of standard colors,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.professionalplastics.com/professionalplastics/content/PlexiglassColorChart.pdf Plexiglas ® Color Numbers] {{webarchive|url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160518084847/http://www.professionalplastics.com/professionalplastics/content/PlexiglassColorChart.pdf |date=2016-05-18 }}. professionalplastics.com&lt;/ref&gt; most commonly sold using color numbers developed by Rohm &amp; Haas in the 1950s.

===Other uses===
* PMMA, in the commercial form Tecnovit 7200 is used vastly in the medical field. It is used for plastic histology, electron micropsy, as well as many more uses.

* Acrylic is used in tanning beds as the transparent surface that separates the occupant from the tanning bulbs while tanning. The type of acrylic used in tanning beds is most often formulated from a special type of polymethyl methacrylate, a compound that allows the passage of ultraviolet rays
* Sheets of PMMA are commonly used in the sign industry to make flat cut out letters in thicknesses typically varying from {{convert|3|to|25|mm|in|1|sp=us}}. These letters may be used alone to represent a company's name and/or logo, or they may be a component of illuminated channel letters.  Acrylic is also used extensively throughout the sign industry as a component of wall signs where it may be a backplate, painted on the surface or the backside, a faceplate with additional raised lettering or even photographic images printed directly to it, or a spacer to separate sign components.

* In [[semiconductor]] research and industry, PMMA aids as a [[Resist (semiconductor fabrication)|resist]] in the [[electron beam lithography]] process. A solution consisting of the polymer in a solvent is used to [[spin coating|spin coat]] [[silicon]] and other semiconducting and semi-insulating wafers with a thin film. Patterns on this can be made by an electron beam (using an [[electron microscope]]), deep UV light (shorter wavelength than the standard [[photolithography]] process), or [[X-ray]]s. Exposure to these creates chain scission or (de-[[cross-link]]ing) within the PMMA, allowing for the selective removal of exposed areas by a chemical developer, making it a positive photoresist. PMMA's advantage is that it allows for extremely high resolution patterns to be made.

'''Provan Gas Works''' is an industrial gas holding plant in the city of [[Glasgow]], [[Scotland]].  The plant is in the [[Provanmill]] area of the city, and was built by [[Glasgow Corporation]] between 1900 and 1904.&lt;ref name=rcahms&gt;{{cite web |url=http://canmore.rcahms.gov.uk/en/site/45018/details/glasgow+provan+road+provan+gasworks/ |title=Provan Gas Works |work=[[CANMORE]] |publisher=[[RCAHMS]] |accessdate=13 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It later became part of [[British Gas plc|British Gas]], and subsequently [[National Grid plc|Transco]] and most recently [[Scotia Gas Networks]] (a subsidiary of [[Scottish and Southern Energy]]) who operate it today.

Originally the plant was a [[gasworks]], manufacturing [[town gas]] via the [[Coke (fuel)|coking]] of [[coal]]. The plant was expanded after 1919.&lt;ref name=rcahms/&gt; Following [[nationalisation]] of the gas supply in 1948, the plant passed to the [[Scottish Gas Board]], and then to [[British Gas plc|British Gas]] in 1973. In 1972, supplies of inexpensive [[natural gas]] from [[North Sea oil]]fields became available. The gasworks was downsized significantly in the 1980s in response to changing economic conditions arising as the British gas industry was privatised under Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]].  Today the plant is largely unmanned, used solely for gas storage and distribution.

The plant has become significant for its two massive column-guided [[gas holder|gasometers]] and an additional spiral-guided gasometer, which have become an iconic industrial landmark in Glasgow's [[East End, Glasgow|East End]].  Among the largest of their kind in the UK, each of the towers can hold {{convert|283000|m3|-3|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} of gas,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thegreenwichphantom.co.uk/local-images/gasholder.pdf |title=Gaslight: Issue 141 |date=December 2007 |publisher=North West Gas Historical Society |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is {{convert|85.4|m}} in diameter.&lt;ref name=rcahms/&gt;  Their combined storage capacity is {{convert|566000|m3|-3|sigfig=3|abbr=on}} – each enough to supply a city the size of [[York]] for an entire day.

Since the construction of the [[M8 motorway (Scotland)|M8]] and [[M80 motorway|M80]] motorways in the 1970s &amp; 1980s, which run directly next to the plant, the twin gasholders have become an unofficial portal into the city's central area for drivers from [[Edinburgh]] and the north. The towers have also gained an affectionate following among locals since they are often used to display huge placards showcasing the various promotional slogans for the city, the most memorable being the "[[Glasgow's miles better|Glasgow's Miles Better]]" and "Everyone's Glasgowing On" campaigns.

The future of the plant is under discussion: [[Glasgow City Council]] have proposed plans for decontaminating the unused land on the [[brownfield site]] and redeveloping it for commercial use.  In 2012, Scotia Gas Networks announced that the twin gasometers were to be decommissioned, with no decision made on their future.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/13243570.What_now_for_city_s_Provan_gas_towers_/|title=What now for city's Provan gas towers?|author=Rebecca Gray|work=[[Evening Times]]|date=21 November 2012 |accessdate=4 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.eveningtimes.co.uk/news/13243570.What_now_for_city_s_Provan_gas_towers_/|title=Glasgow's skyline could be changing as future of historic Provan gasworks up for debate|author=Hannah Rodger|work=[[Evening Times]]|date=10 October 2017 |accessdate=4 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/row-over-historic-protection-for-eyesore-gasworks-1-4742730|title=Row over historic protection for “eyesore” gasworks|author=Alison Campsie|work=[[The Scotsman]]|date=21 May 2018|accessdate=4 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7303">'''Reticulated foam''' is a very [[porosity|porous]], low density solid [[foam]]. 'Reticulated' means like a [[net (device)|net]]. Reticulated foams are extremely open foams i.e. there are few, if any, intact bubbles or cell windows. In contrast, the foam formed by [[soap bubbles]] is composed solely of intact (fully enclosed) bubbles. In a reticulated foam only the lineal boundaries where the bubbles meet (Plateau borders) remain. 
[[File:Reticulated foam.JPG|300px|thumb|Reticulated foam|Foam before reticulation (left), after reticulation (right)]]
The solid component of a reticulated foam may be an [[organic polymer]] like [[polyurethane]], a [[ceramic]] or a [[metal]]. These materials are used in a wide range of applications where the high porosity and large [[surface area]] are needed, including [[filtration|filters]], [[catalysis|catalyst]] supports, [[fuel tank]] inserts, and [[loudspeaker]] covers.

==Structure and properties==
[[File:12-14-hedral honeycomb.png|right|thumb|Weaire–Phelan structure]]
A description of the structure of reticulated foams is still being developed. While [[Plateau's laws]], the rules governing the shape of soap films in foams were developed in the 19th century, a mathematical description of the structure is still debated. The computer-generated [[Weaire–Phelan structure]] is the most recent. In a reticulated foam only the [[Edge (geometry)|edges]] of the [[polyhedra]] remain; the [[Face (geometry)|faces]] are missing. In commercial reticulated foam, up to 98% of the faces are removed. The [[dodecahedron]] is sometimes given as the basic unit for these foams,&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.crestfoam.com/decanew2.html|title=The "shape" of our foam|publisher=Crest Foams|accessdate=2009-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the most representative shape is a polyhedron with 13 faces.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://smu.edu/math/research/rmfoam.pdf|title=Structure of random monodisperse foam}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a912045341~db=all|title=A new counter-example to Kelvin's conjecture on minimal foams}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cell size and cell size distribution are critical parameters for most applications.

==Production==
Robert A. Volz is credited with discovering the first process for making reticulated polyurethane foam in 1956 while working for the [[Scott Paper Company]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.pfa.org/fame/inductees.html#6|title=Hall of Fame|publisher=Polyurethane Foam Association|accessdate=2009-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Producing reticulated [[Polyurethane uses|polyurethane foam]] is a two step procedure: a conventional closed-cell polyurethane foam is produced, then the faces (or "windows") of the cells are removed. The high surface area and lower mass of the cells' faces compared with the cells' struts (or edges) makes them much more susceptible to both combustion and chemical degradation; either filling the closed-cell foam with a combustible gas like [[hydrogen]] and igniting it under controlled conditions, or exposing the foam to a [[sodium hydroxide]] solution will remove the faces and leave the edges.&lt;ref name=ufp&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://steplaw.com/reticulatedfoam.html|title=Reticulated foam|publisher=United Foam |accessdate=2009-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Reticulated [[ceramic]] foams are made by coating a reticulated polyurethane foam with an aqueous suspension of a ceramic powder then heating the material to first evaporate the water then fuse the ceramic particles and finally to burn off the organic polymer.&lt;ref name=ceramic&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://machinedesign.com/article/where-reticulated-polyurethane-foam-s-a-fit-0221|title=Where Reticulated Polyurethane Foam’s a Fit|first=Robert|last=Gliganic|publisher=MachineDesign.com|date=February 21, 2008|accessdate=2009-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reticulated [[metal]] foam can also be made using polyurethane foam as a template similar to its use in ceramic foams. Metals can be [[Physical vapor deposition|vapor deposited]] onto the polyurethane foam and then the organic polymer burned off.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Queheillalt |first1=Douglas T. |last2= Derek D.

'''Rock flour''', or '''glacial flour''', consists of fine-grained, [[silt]]-sized particles of rock, generated by mechanical grinding of bedrock by [[Glacier#Glacial erosion|glacial erosion]] or by artificial grinding to a similar size. Because the material is very small, it becomes suspended in [[meltwater]] making the water appear cloudy, which is sometimes known as '''glacial milk'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.physicalgeography.net/physgeoglos/g.html "Glossary of Terms: G: Glacial Milk"] PhysicalGeography.net&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gornitz, Vivien (editor) (2007) "Glacial Geomorphology" pp. 361-374 ''Encyclopedia of paleoclimatology and ancient environments'' Springer Netherland, Berlin, [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=yRMgYc-8mTIC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA365 page 365], {{ISBN|978-1-4020-4551-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

When the sediments enter a river, they turn the river's colour grey, light brown, iridescent blue-green, or milky white. If the river flows into a [[glacial lake]], the lake may appear [[Turquoise (colour)|turquoise]] in colour as a result. When flows of the flour are extensive, a distinct layer of a different colour flows into the lake and begins to dissipate and settle as the flow extends from the increase in water flow from the glacier during snow melts and heavy rain periods. Examples of this phenomenon may be seen at [[Lake Pukaki]] and [[Lake Tekapo]] in New Zealand, [[Lake Louise (Alberta)|Lake Louise]], [[Moraine Lake]], [[Emerald Lake (British Columbia)|Emerald Lake]], and [[Peyto Lake]] in Canada, [[Gjende]] lake in Norway, and several lakes (among others, [[Nordenskjöld Lake|Nordenskjöld]] and [[Lake Pehoé|Pehoé]]) in Chile's [[Torres del Paine National Park]].

==Formation==
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2018}}
[[Image:Muru memurubu.jpg|thumb|[[Muru]] river pours rock flour into [[Gjende]] lake, Norway]]
[[Image:Blanktjärn.jpg|thumb|Östra Blanktjärn Lake in [[Vålådalen Nature Reserve]], Sweden]]

Typically, natural rock flour is formed during [[glacial motion|glacial migration]], where the [[glacier]] grinds against the sides and bottom of the [[Rock (geology)|rock]] beneath it, but also is produced by [[Freeze-Thaw Cycle|freeze-and-thaw action]], where the act of water freezing and expanding in cracks helps break up [[rock formations]]. Multiple cycles create a greater amount. 

Although clay-sized, the flour particles are not [[clay minerals]] but typically ground up [[quartz]] and [[feldspar]]. Rock flour is carried out from the system via [[meltwater]] streams, where the particles travel in [[Suspension (chemistry)|suspension]]. Rock flour particles may travel great distances either suspended in water or carried by the wind, in the latter case forming deposits called [[loess]].

==Agricultural use==
{{Unreferenced section|date=May 2018}}
Some [[Agricultural science|agronomists]]{{who|date=May 2018}} believe that rock flour has a powerful effect in restoring trace minerals to soil. An early experimenter was the German miller, [[Julius Hensel]], author of ''Bread from Stones'', who reported successful results with ''steinmehl'' (stonemeal) in the 1890s. His ideas were not taken up due to technical limitations and, according to proponents of his method, because of opposition from the champions of conventional [[fertiliser]]s.

[[John D. Hamaker]] argued that widespread [[remineralization]] of soils with [[rock dust]] will be necessary to reverse soil depletion by current agriculture and forestry practice.

While this originally was an [[Alternative culture|alternative]] concept, increasing mainstream research has been devoted to [[soil amendment]] and other benefits of rock flour application: for instance, a pilot project on the use of glacial rock, [[granite]] and [[basalt]]ic fines by the [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]] exists at the [[Henry A. Wallace Beltsville Agricultural Research Center]]. The SEER Centre in Scotland is a leading source of information on the use of rock dusts and mineral fines. The Soil Remineralization Forum was established with sponsorship from the Scottish Environment Protection Agency and has commissioned a portfolio of research into the benefits of using mineral fines. The Forum provides an interface among research, [[environmentalist]]s, and industry.

A '''sandwich-structured composite''' is a special class of [[composite material]]s that is fabricated by attaching two thin but stiff skins to a lightweight but thick core. The core material is normally low strength material, but its higher thickness provides the sandwich composite with high [[bending]] [[stiffness]] with overall low [[density]].

Open- and closed-cell-structured [[foam]]s like [[polyethersulfone]] [[polyvinylchloride]], [[polyurethane]], [[polyethylene]] or [[polystyrene]] foams, [[balsa|balsa wood]], [[syntactic foam]]s, and [[composite honeycomb|honeycomb]]s are commonly used core materials. Sometimes, the honeycomb structure is filled with other foams for added strength. Open- and closed-cell [[metal foam]] can also be used as core materials.

[[Laminate]]s of [[glass]] or [[carbon fiber|carbon]] fiber-reinforced [[thermoplastic]]s or mainly [[thermosetting polymer|thermoset]] polymers ([[Polyester resin|unsaturated polyesters]], [[Epoxy|epoxies]]...) are widely used as skin materials. [[Sheet metal]] is also used as skin material in some cases.

The core is bonded to the skins with an [[adhesive]] or with metal components by [[brazing]] together.

== Types of sandwich structures ==
Metal composite material (MCM) is a type of sandwich formed from two thin skins of metal bonded to a plastic core in a continuous process under controlled pressure, heat, and tension.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Flanagan |first=Jim |year=2007 |title=The Realm of Building Possibilities Created by MCM and Insulated Metal Panels |journal=Metal construction news |volume=28 |issue=10 |url=http://d.wanfangdata.com.cn/NSTLQK_NSTL_QK14842580.aspx }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Recycled paper]] is also now being used over a closed-cell recycled kraft honeycomb core, creating a lightweight, strong, and fully repulpable composite board. This material is being used for applications including point-of-purchase displays, bulkheads, recyclable office furniture, exhibition stands, and wall dividers.

To fix different panels, among other solutions, a transition zone is normally used, which is a gradual reduction of the core height, until the two fiber skins are in touch. In this place, the fixation can be made by means of bolts, rivets, or adhesive.

With respect to the core type and the way the core supports the skins, sandwich structures can be divided into the following groups: homogeneously supported, locally supported, regionally supported, unidirectionally supported, bidirectionally supported.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://econcore.com/en/classification|title=Sandwich panel classification (by type of core)|publisher=EconCore.com |accessdate=2014-10-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter group is represented by [[honeycomb structure]] which, due to an optimal performance-to-weight ratio, is typically used in most demanding applications including [[aerospace]].

== Properties of  sandwich structures ==
The strength of the composite material is dependent largely on two factors:
:#'''The outer skins:'''  If the sandwich is supported on both sides, and then stressed by means of a downward force in the middle of the beam, then the bending moment will introduce shear forces in the material.  The shear forces result in the bottom skin in tension and the top skin in compression.  The core material spaces these two skins apart.  The thicker the core material the stronger the composite.  This principle works in much the same way as an [[I-beam]] does.&lt;ref name=Gere&gt;{{Cite book | author=Gere, James M |title=Mechanics of Materials |year= 2004|publisher=Thomson Brooks/Cole |location= |isbn=0-534-41793-0 |pages=393–463}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:#'''The interface between the core and the skin:'''  Because the [[shear stress]]es in the composite material change rapidly between the core and the skin, the adhesive layer also sees some degree of shear force.  If the adhesive bond between the two layers is too weak, the most probable result will be delamination.

== Application of sandwich structures ==
[[File:Composite honeycomb exhaust duct (2).jpg|thumb|The composite honeycomb structure of a helicopter nozzle]]
Sandwich structures can be widely used in [[sandwich panel]]s, this kinds of panels can be in different types such as FRP sandwich panel, [[aluminium composite panel]] etc. FRP polyester reinforced composite honeycomb panel (sandwich panel) is made of polyester reinforced plastic, multi-axial high-strength glass fiber and PP honeycomb panel in special antiskid tread pattern mold through the process of constant temperature vacuum adsorption &amp; agglutination and solidification.

==Theory==
{{main|Sandwich theory}}
Sandwich theory&lt;ref name=Plantema&gt;Plantema, F, J., 1966, '''Sandwich Construction: The Bending and Buckling of Sandwich Beams, Plates, and Shells''', Jon Wiley and Sons, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Zenkert&gt;Zenkert, D., 1995, '''An Introduction to Sandwich Construction''', Engineering Materials Advisory Services Ltd, UK.&lt;/ref&gt; describes the behaviour of a [[beam theory|beam]], [[plate theory|plate]], or [[Plate theory|shell]] which consists of three layers - two face sheets and one core.  The most commonly used sandwich theory is [[linear]] and is an extension of first order [[beam theory]].  Linear local buckling sandwich theory is of importance for the design and analysis of Sandwich plates or [[Sandwich Panel|sandwich panels]], which are of use in building construction, vehicle construction, airplane construction and refrigeration engineering.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8299">In [[computational fluid dynamics]], '''shock-capturing methods''' are a class of techniques for computing [[inviscid flow]]s with [[shock wave]]s. The computation of flow containing shock waves is an extremely difficult task because such flows result in sharp, discontinuous changes in flow variables such as pressure, temperature, density, and velocity across the shock.

==Method==
In shock-capturing methods, the governing equations of inviscid flows (i.e. [[Euler_equations_(fluid_dynamics)|Euler equations]]) are cast in conservation form and any shock waves or discontinuities are computed as part of the solution. Here, no special treatment is employed to take care of the shocks themselves, which is in contrast to the shock-fitting method, where shock waves are explicitly introduced in the solution using appropriate shock relations ([[Rankine–Hugoniot relation]]s). The shock waves predicted by shock-capturing methods are generally not sharp and may be smeared over several grid elements. Also, classical shock-capturing methods have the disadvantage that unphysical oscillations ([[Gibbs phenomenon]]) may develop near strong shocks.

==Euler equations==
The [[Euler_equations_(fluid_dynamics)|Euler equations]] are the governing equations for inviscid flow. To implement shock-capturing methods, the conservation form of the Euler equations are used. For a flow without external heat transfer and work transfer (isoenergetic flow), the conservation form of the Euler equation in [[Cartesian coordinate system]] can be written as

:&lt;math&gt;
 \frac{\partial {\mathbf U}}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial {\mathbf F}}{\partial x} + \frac{\partial {\mathbf G}}{\partial y} +
 \frac{\partial {\mathbf H}}{\partial z} = 0
&lt;/math&gt;

where the vectors '''U''', '''F''', '''G''', and '''H''' are given by

:&lt;math&gt; {\mathbf U} = \left[
\begin{array}{c}
 \rho \\
 \rho u \\
 \rho v \\
 \rho w \\
 \rho e_t \\
\end{array} \right] \quad

{\mathbf F} = \left[
\begin{array}{c}
 \rho u\\
 \rho u^2 + p \\
 \rho uv \\
 \rho uw \\
 (\rho e_t + p)u \\
\end{array} \right] \quad

{\mathbf G} = \left[
\begin{array}{c}
 \rho v\\
 \rho vu \\
 \rho v^2 + p \\
 \rho vw \\
 (\rho e_t + p)v \\
\end{array} \right] \quad

{\mathbf H} = \left[
\begin{array}{c}
 \rho w\\
 \rho wu \\
 \rho wv \\
 \rho w^2 + p \\
 (\rho e_t + p)w \\
\end{array} \right] \qquad
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;e_t&lt;/math&gt; is the total energy (internal energy + kinetic energy + potential energy) per unit mass. That is

:&lt;math&gt;
  e_t = e + \frac{u^2 + v^2 + w^2}{2} + gz
&lt;/math&gt;

The Euler equations may be integrated with any of the shock-capturing methods available to obtain the solution.

==Classical and modern shock capturing methods==
From a historical point of view, shock-capturing methods can be classified into two general categories: '''classical methods''' and '''modern shock capturing methods''' (also called high-resolution schemes). Modern shock-capturing methods are generally [[upwind scheme|upwind biased]] in contrast to classical symmetric or central discretizations. Upwind-biased differencing schemes attempt to discretize hyperbolic partial differential equations by using differencing based on the direction of the flow. On the other hand, symmetric or central schemes do not consider any information about the direction of wave propagation.

Regardless of the shock-capturing scheme used, a stable calculation in the presence of shock waves requires a certain amount of numerical dissipation, in order to avoid the formation of unphysical numerical oscillations. In the case of classical shock-capturing methods, numerical dissipation terms are usually linear and the same amount is uniformly applied at all grid points. Classical shock-capturing methods only exhibit accurate results in the case of smooth and weak shock solutions, but when strong shock waves are present in the solution, non-linear instabilities and oscillations may arise across discontinuities. Modern shock-capturing methods usually employ nonlinear numerical dissipation, where a feedback mechanism adjusts the amount of artificial dissipation added in accord with the features in the solution. Ideally, artificial numerical dissipation needs to be added only in the vicinity of shocks or other sharp features, and regions of smooth flow must be left unmodified. These schemes have proven to be stable and accurate even for problems containing strong shock waves.

Some of the well-known classical shock-capturing methods include the [[MacCormack method]] (uses a discretization scheme for the numerical solution of hyperbolic partial differential equations), [[Lax–Wendroff method]] (based on finite differences, uses a numerical method for the solution of [[hyperbolic partial differential equation]]s), and [[Beam and Warming scheme|Beam–Warming method]]. Examples of modern shock-capturing schemes include higher-order [[total variation diminishing]] (TVD) schemes first proposed by [[Ami Harten|Harten]], [[flux-corrected transport]] scheme introduced by Boris and Book, [[MUSCL scheme|Monotonic Upstream-centered Schemes for Conservation Laws]] (MUSCL) based on [[Godunov's scheme|Godunov approach]] and introduced by [[Bram van Leer|van Leer]], various [[essentially non-oscillatory]] schemes (ENO) proposed by Harten et al., and the [[piecewise parabolic method]] (PPM) proposed by [[Phillip Colella|Colella]] and Woodward. Another important class of high-resolution schemes belongs to the approximate [[Riemann solver]]s proposed by [[Roe solver|Roe]] and by [[Stanley Osher|Osher]]. The schemes proposed by [[Antony Jameson|Jameson]] and Baker, where linear numerical dissipation terms depend on nonlinear switch functions, fall in between the classical and modern shock-capturing methods.

[[File:VulcanizationMold1941.jpg|thumb|250px|Worker placing tire in a mold before vulcanization.]]

'''Sulfur vulcanization''' or '''sulfur vulcanisation''' is a [[chemical process]] for converting [[natural rubber]] or related [[polymer]]s into more durable materials by heating them with [[sulfur]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| isbn = 0-12-464786-3| pages = 768| author = James E. Mark, Burak Erman (eds.)| title = Science and technology of rubber| year = 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; or other equivalent curatives or [[Accelerant|accelerators]].&lt;ref name="Rev1"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Akiba |first1=M |title=Vulcanization and crosslinking in elastomers |journal=Progress in Polymer Science |date=1997 |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=475–521 |doi=10.1016/S0079-6700(96)00015-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sulfur forms [[cross-link]]s (bridges) between sections of [[polymer chain]] which results in increased rigidity and durability, as well as other changes in the mechanical and electronic properties of the material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| isbn = 0-12-464786-3| pages = 768| author = James E. Mark, Burak Erman (eds.)| title = Science and technology of rubber| year = 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; A vast array of products are made with vulcanized rubber, including tires, shoe soles, hoses, and [[conveyor belt]]s. The term {{em|[[vulcanization]]}} is derived from [[Vulcan (mythology)|Vulcan]], the [[Roman god]] of fire. 

The main polymers subjected to sulfur vulcanization are [[polyisoprene]] (natural  rubber, NR), [[polybutadiene]] rubber (BR) and [[styrene-butadiene]] rubber (SBR), all of which are rich in [[Saturation (chemistry)|unsaturated]] groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Coran |first1=A.Y. |title=The science and technology of rubber |date=2013 |publisher=Elsevier |isbn=978-0-12-394584-6 |pages=337-381 |edition=Fourth |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780123945846000078 |chapter=Chapter 7 - Vulcanization}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together these have a wide range of applications of which vehicle [[tire]]s are perhaps the main example. Several other specialty rubbers may also be vulcanised, such as [[nitrile rubber]] (NBR), [[butyl rubber]] (IIR) and [[EPDM rubber]]. 

Vulcanization, in common with the curing of other [[thermosetting polymer]]s, is generally irreversible; however there has been significant effort to try and develop 'de-vulcanisation' processes in order to improve the recycling of rubber wastes.

==Chemistry==

The chemistry of vulcanisation is complex,&lt;ref name="web-rev"&gt;{{cite web |title=Vulcanization |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/materials-science/vulcanization |website=www.sciencedirect.com |publisher=ScienceDirect |accessdate=31 October 2018}}{{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mary Joseph |first1=Anu |last2=George |first2=Benny |last3=Madhusoodanan |first3=K.

The reactive sites, often referred to as 'cure sites', are [[Saturation (chemistry)|unsaturated]] groups such as [[alkene]]s and [[allyl]]s. During vulcanization sulfur bridges are formed between these sites, crosslinking the polymer. These bridges may consist one or several sulfur atoms. 
Both the extent of crosslinking and the number of sulfur atoms in the crosslinks strongly influences the physical properties of the rubber produced:

* Excessive crosslinking can convert the rubber into a hard and brittle substance (i.e. [[ebonite]]).
* Short crosslinks, possessing lower numbers of sulfur atoms, give the rubber better heat resistance. 
* Longer crosslinks, with higher numbers of sulfur atoms, give the rubber improved physical durability. 

Sulfur, by itself, is a slow vulcanizing agent and does not vulcanize synthetic polyolefins. Even with natural rubber large amounts of sulfur as well as high temperatures and long heating periods are necessary, with the end products often being of an unsatisfactory quality.

Over the last 200 years various chemicals have been developed to improve the speed and efficiency of vulcanisation, as well as to control the nature of the cross-linking, in order to produce rubber articles with the desired properties.&lt;ref name="Ullmann's"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Engels|first1=Hans-Wilhelm|last2=Weidenhaupt|first2=Herrmann-Josef|last3=Pieroth|first3=Manfred|last4=Hofmann|first4=Werner|last5=Menting|first5=Karl-Hans|last6=Mergenhagen|first6=Thomas|last7=Schmoll|first7=Ralf|last8=Uhrlandt|first8=Stefan|title=Rubber, 9. Chemicals and Additives|journal=Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry|year=2011|doi=10.1002/14356007.a23_365.pub3}}&lt;/ref&gt; When used together to give a rubber with particular properties vulcanization reagents are generally referred to as a cure package.

==Cure Package==
The cure package consists of various reagents that modify the kinetics and chemistry of crosslinking. These include accelerators, activators, retarders and inhibitors.&lt;ref name="Ullmann's" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Aprem |first1=Abi Santhosh |last2=Joseph |first2=Kuruvilla |last3=Thomas |first3=Sabu |title=Recent Developments in Crosslinking of Elastomers |journal=Rubber Chemistry and Technology |date=July 2005 |volume=78 |issue=3 |pages=458–488 |doi=10.5254/1.3547892}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Note that these are merely the additives used for vulcanisation and that other compounds may also be added to the rubber such as [[Filler (materials)|fillers]] or [[polymer stabilizers]].

===Sulfur source===
Ordinary sulfur ([[octasulfur]]) is by far the most commonly used reagent due to its low cost and low toxicity, however it is possible replace sulfur with other sulfur-donating compounds, for example accelerators bearing [[disulphide]] groups, in what is often termed 'efficient vulcanization' (EV).&lt;ref name="Rev1" /&gt; [[Disulfur dichloride]] may also be used for 'cold vulcanization'. Under normal circumstances sulfur is not miscible in the polymer prior to vulcanization and attention is paid to prevent [[Bloom (sulfur)|sulfur bloom]], where it migrates to the surface of the article.

===Accelerators===
{{see also|Accelerant#Rubber_vulcanization}}
[[Accelerators]] act much like [[catalysts]] allowing vulcanisation to be performed cooler yet faster and with a more efficient use of sulfur.&lt;ref name="Rev1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hewitt |first1=Norman |last2=Ciullo |first2=Peter A. |title=The rubber formulary |publisher=Noyes Publications |isbn=9780815514343 |pages=4-49 |date=1999 |url=https://doi.org/10.1016/B978-081551434-3.50003-8|chapter=COMPOUNDING MATERIALS}}&lt;/ref&gt;
They achieve this by reacting with and breaking the sulfur ring to form a reactive intermediate, referred to as a sulfurating agent. This in turn reacts with cure site in the rubber to bring about vulcanization.

There are two major classes of vulcanization accelerators: primary accelerators and secondary accelerators (also known as ultra accelerators). Primary activators date back to the use of ammonia in 1881,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Geer |first1=W. C. |last2=Bedford |first2=C. W. |title=The History of Organic Accelerators in the Rubber Industry. |journal=Industrial &amp; Engineering Chemistry |date=April 1925 |volume=17 |issue=4 |pages=393–396 |doi=10.1021/ie50184a021}}&lt;/ref&gt; with secondary accelerators have been developed from around 1920.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Whitby |first1=G. Stafford. |title=Accelerators of Vulcanization. |journal=Industrial &amp; Engineering Chemistry |date=October 1923 |volume=15 |issue=10 |pages=1005–1008 |doi=10.1021/ie50166a007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Primary (fast-accelerators)
Primary accelerators perform the bulk of the accelerating and mostly consist of [[thiazole]]s, often derivatised with [[sulfenamide]] groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1070/RC1996v065n05ABEH000218 | title = Synthesis and application of sulfenamides | year = 1996 | last1 = Koval' | first1 = I V | journal = Russian Chemical Reviews | volume = 65 | issue = 5 | pages = 421|bibcode = 1996RuCRv..65..421K }}&lt;/ref&gt; The principle compound is 2-[[mercaptobenzothiazole]] (MBT) which has been in use since the 1920s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sebrei |first1=L. B. |last2=Boord |first2=C. E. |title=1-Mercaptobenzothiazole and Its Derivatives as Accelerators of Rubber Vulcanization. |journal=Industrial &amp; Engineering Chemistry |date=October 1923 |volume=15 |issue=10 |pages=1009–1014 |doi=10.1021/ie50166a009}}&lt;/ref&gt; it remains a moderately fast curing agent giving sulfur chains of a medium length but it's relatively short [[induction period]] can be a disadvantage. Other primary accelerators are essentially 'masked' forms of MBT which take time to decompose into MBT during vulcanisation and thus have longer inductions periods.

&lt;gallery widths=140&gt;

N,N-dicyclohexyl-2-benzothiazolesulfenamide.svg | Dicyclohexyl-2-benzothiazolesulfenamide (DCBS)
&lt;/gallery&gt;

Oxidative [[Dimer (chemistry)|dimerization]]  of MBT gives mercaptobenzthiazole [[disulfide]] (MBTS), sulfenamide derivatives are produced by reacting this with primary [[amine]]s like [[cyclohexylamine]] or [[tert-butylamine]]. Secondary amines like [[dicyclohexylamine]] can be used and result in even slower accelerators. Such a slow accelerator is required in applications in which the rubber is being cured onto a metal component to which is it required to adhere, such as the steel cords in vehicle tires.

;Secondary (ultra-accelerators)
Secondary or ultra-accelerators are used in small amounts to augment the behaviour of primary accelerators, they act to boost the cure speed and increase cross-link density but also shorten the induction time which can lead to premature vulcanization.&lt;ref name="Ullmann's" /&gt; Chemically, they consist mainly of thio-carbonyl species such as [[Thiuram disulfide|thiurams]], [[dithiocarbamate]]s, [[xanthate]]s and organic [[thiourea]]s. Many of these compounds need to be combined with activators, typically zinc ions, in order to be fully active. Aromatic [[guanidine]]s are also used.

&lt;gallery widths=140&gt;

1,3-difenylguanidine t.png | diphenylguanidine (DPG)
&lt;/gallery&gt;

Secondary accelerators have very fast vulcanization speeds with minimal induction time, making them unsuitable as primary accelerators in highly unsaturated rubbers such as NR or SBR, however they can be use as primary accelerators in compounds with fewer curing site such as [[EPDM]]. Xanthates (principally, zinc isopropyl xanthate) are important in the vulcanization of latex, which is cured at relatively low temperature (100-120°C) and therefore need an inherently rapid accelerator.
The major thiurams used are TMTD ([[tetramethylthiuram disulfide]]) and TETD ([[Disulfiram|tetraethylthiuram disulfide]]). The major dithiocarbamates are the zinc salts ZDMC ([[zinc bis(dimethyldithiocarbamate)|zinc dimethyldithiocarbamate]]), ZDEC (zinc diethyldithiocarbamate) and ZDBC (zinc dibutyldithiocarbamate).

===Activators===
Activators consist of various metal salts, fatty acids as well as nitrogen-containing bases, the most important these being [[zinc oxide]]. Zinc actives many accelerators by coordination, for example causing [[thiuram]] to convert into [[ziram]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nieuwenhuizen |first1=P. J. |last2=Reedijk |first2=J. |last3=van Duin |first3=M. |last4=McGill |first4=W. J. |title=Thiuram- and Dithiocarbamate-Accelerated Sulfur Vulcanization from the Chemist's Perspective; Methods, Materials and Mechanisms Reviewed |journal=Rubber Chemistry and Technology |date=July 1997 |volume=70 |issue=3 |pages=368–429 |doi=10.5254/1.3538436}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zinc also coordinates to the sulfur-chains of sulfurating agents, changing the most likely bond to break during cross-link formation, untilmately they promote efficient use of sulfur to give a high density of cross-links.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Nieuwenhuizen |first1=Peter J. |last2=Ehlers |first2=Andreas W. |last3=Haasnoot |first3=Jaap G. |last4=Janse |first4=Sander R. |last5=Reedijk |first5=Jan |last6=Baerends |first6=Evert Jan |title=The Mechanism of Zinc(II)-Dithiocarbamate-Accelerated Vulcanization Uncovered; Theoretical and Experimental Evidence |journal=Journal of the American Chemical Society |date=January 1999 |volume=121 |issue=1 |pages=163–168 |doi=10.1021/ja982217n}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the low solubility of ZnO it is often combined with fatty acids such as [[stearic acid]] to form more soluble metallic soap (i.e. [[zinc stearate]]).

===Retarders and Inhibitors===
[[Image:Cyclohexylthiophthalimid.svg|140px|thumb|[[Cyclohexylthiophthalimide]] is used to impede the onset of vulcanization.&lt;ref name="Ullmann's" /&gt;]]

In order for good quality vulcanisation to take place the rubber, sulfur, accelerators, activators and other compounds must be fully mixed to give a homogeneous liquid. In practise this can involve melting the sulfur (mpt. 115°C) and at these temperatures vulcanisation can begin prematurely. This is often undesirable as the mixture may still need to be pumped and moulded into its final form before it sets solid. 
Premature vulcanisation is often referred to as 'scorch' and can be prevented by the addition of retarders or inhibitors which increase the [[induction period]] before vulcanisation commences and thus provide scorch resistance.
A retarder slows down both the onset and rate of vulcanisation, whereas inhibitors only delay the start of vulcanisation and do not effect the rate to any great extent.&lt;ref name="DeWhite2001"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Sadhan K. De|author2=Jim R. White|title=Rubber Technologist's Handbook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2rxFOm68Ui8C&amp;pg=PA184|year=2001|publisher=iSmithers Rapra Publishing|isbn=978-1-85957-262-7|pages=184–}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general inhibitors are preferred, with [[cyclohexylthiophthalimide]] (often termed PVI - pre vulcanisation inhibitor) being the most common example.

== Devulcanization ==
{{Main|Tire recycling}}
The market for new raw rubber or equivalent is large. The auto industry consumes a substantial fraction of natural and synthetic rubber. Reclaimed rubber has altered properties and is unsuitable for use in many products, including tires. Tires and other vulcanized products are potentially amenable to devulcanization, but this technology has not produced material that can supplant unvulcanized materials. The main problem is that the carbon-sulfur linkages are not readily broken, without the input of costly reagents and heat. Thus, more than half of scrap rubber is simply burned for fuel.&lt;ref&gt;Myhre, Marvin; MacKillop, Duncan A. "Rubber Recycling" ''Rubber Chemistry and Technology'' (2002), volume 75, number 3, pp 429–474.  {{DOI|10.5254/1.3547678}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inverse vulcanization==
Although polymeric sulfur is unstable and decomposes back to its monomer, it is possible to create stable polymers consisting mostly of sulfur via a reaction with low levels of unsaturated organic linkers (e.g. 1,3‐diisopropenylbenzene).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chung |first1=Woo Jin |last2=Griebel |first2=Jared J. |last3=Kim |first3=Eui Tae |last4=Yoon |first4=Hyunsik |last5=Simmonds |first5=Adam G. |last6=Ji |first6=Hyun Jun |last7=Dirlam |first7=Philip T. |last8=Glass |first8=Richard S. |last9=Wie |first9=Jeong Jae |last10=Nguyen |first10=Ngoc A. |last11=Guralnick |first11=Brett W. |last12=Park |first12=Jungjin |last13=Somogyi |first13=Árpád |last14=Theato |first14=Patrick |last15=Mackay |first15=Michael E. |last16=Sung |first16=Yung-Eun |last17=Char |first17=Kookheon |last18=Pyun |first18=Jeffrey |title=The use of elemental sulfur as an alternative feedstock for polymeric materials |journal=Nature Chemistry |date=14 April 2013 |volume=5 |issue=6 |pages=518–524 |doi=10.1038/nchem.1624}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process is called inverse vulcanisation and produces polymers where sulfur is the main component. It is not currently of commercial importance but had been investigated as a means of producing polymers for [[lithium–sulfur battery]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dirlam |first1=Philip T. |last2=Glass |first2=Richard S. |last3=Char |first3=Kookheon |last4=Pyun |first4=Jeffrey |title=The use of polymers in Li-S batteries: A review |journal=Journal of Polymer Science Part A: Polymer Chemistry |date=15 May 2017 |volume=55 |issue=10 |pages=1635–1668 |doi=10.1002/pola.28551}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for creating water filters with a high affinity for [[Mercury (element)|mercury]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Parker |first1=D.

== History ==
The [[curing (chemistry)|curing]] of rubber has been carried out since prehistoric times.&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hosler|first1=D.|title=Prehistoric Polymers: Rubber Processing in Ancient Mesoamerica|journal=Science|date=18 June 1999|volume=284|issue=5422|pages=1988–1991|doi=10.1126/science.284.5422.1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name of the first major civilization in Guatemala and Mexico, the [[Olmec]], means 'rubber people' in the [[Aztec]] language. Ancient [[Mesoamerica]]ns, spanning from ancient Olmecs to Aztecs, extracted [[latex]] from ''[[Castilla elastica]]'', a type of [[Hevea brasiliensis|rubber tree]] in the area. The juice of a local vine, ''[[Ipomoea alba]]'', was then mixed with this latex to create processed rubber as early as 1600 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = D Hosler, SL Burkett and MJ Tarkanian | title = Prehistoric Polymers: Rubber Processing in Ancient Mesoamerica | journal = Science | volume = 284 | pages = 1988–1991 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10373117 | doi = 10.1126/science.284.5422.1988 | issue = 5422}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Western world, rubber remained a curiosity, although it was eventually used to produce waterproofed products, such as [[Mackintosh]] rainwear, beginning in the early 1800s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whonamedit.com/doctor.cfm/2088.html|title=Whonamedit – James Syme|publisher=Whonamedit|accessdate=23 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modern developments ===
In 1832–1834 [[Nathaniel Hayward]] and Friedrich Ludersdorf discovered that rubber treated with sulfur lost its stickiness. It is likely Hayward shared his discovery with [[Charles Goodyear]], possibly inspiring him to make the discovery of vulcanization.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=BZtrCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP5&amp;dq=Ludersdorf+Vulcanisation&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjsm8WJnJzPAhWsK8AKHW0gDyMQ6AEIPjAG#v=onepage&amp;q=Ludersdorf%20Vulcanisation&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thomas Hancock (inventor)|Thomas Hancock]] (1786–1865), a scientist and engineer, was the first to patent vulcanization of rubber. He was awarded a British patent on May 21, 1845. Three weeks later, on June 15, 1845, Charles Goodyear was awarded a patent in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=1493: Uncovering the New World Columbus Created|publisher=Random House Digital, Inc.|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Veu9u0brhrcC&amp;pg=PA245&amp;dq=Thomas+Hancock+and+Charles+Goodyear+vulcanization#v=onepage&amp;q=Thomas%20Hancock%20and%20Charles%20Goodyear%20vulcanization&amp;f=false|pages=244–245|isbn=9780307265722|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was Hancock's friend [[William Brockedon]] who coined term 'vulcanization'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fisher |first1=Harry L. |title=VULCANIZATION OF RUBBER Vulcanization of Rubber |journal=Industrial &amp; Engineering Chemistry |date=November 1939 |volume=31 |issue=11 |pages=1381–1389 |doi=10.1021/ie50359a015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Goodyear claimed that he had discovered vulcanization earlier, in 1839. He wrote the story of the discovery in 1853 in his autobiographical book ''Gum-Elastica''. Here is Goodyear's account of the [[invention]], taken from ''Gum-Elastica''. Although the book is an [[autobiography]], Goodyear chose to write it in the [[Grammatical person|third person]] so that {{em|the inventor}} and {{em|he}} referred to in the text are the author. He describes the scene in a rubber [[factory]] where his brother worked:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The inventor made experiments to ascertain the effect of heat on the same compound that had decomposed in the mail-bags and other articles. He was surprised to find that the specimen, being carelessly brought into contact with a hot stove, charred like leather.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Goodyear goes on to describe how his discovery was not readily accepted.

&lt;blockquote&gt;He directly inferred that if the process of charring could be stopped at the right point, it might divest the gum of its native adhesiveness throughout, which would make it better than the native gum. Upon further trial with heat, he was further convinced of the correctness of this inference, by finding that the India rubber could not be melted in boiling sulfur at any heat, but always charred.

He made another trial of heating a similar fabric before an open fire. The same effect, that of charring the gum, followed. There were further indications of success in producing the desired result, as upon the edge of the charred portion appeared a line or border, that was not charred, but perfectly cured.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Goodyear then goes on to describe how he moved to [[Woburn, Massachusetts]] and carried out a series of systematic experiments to optimize the curing of rubber, collaborating with [[Nathaniel Hayward]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;On ascertaining to a certainty that he had found the object of his search and much more, and that the new substance was proof against cold and the solvent of the native gum, he felt himself amply repaid for the past, and quite indifferent to the trials of the future.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Later developments ===
The discovery of the rubber-sulfur reaction revolutionized the use and applications of rubber, changing the face of the [[Industry|industrial]] world. Formerly, the only way to seal a small gap between moving machine parts was to use [[leather]] soaked in oil. This practice was acceptable only at moderate pressures, but above a certain point, machine designers were forced to compromise between the extra [[friction]] generated by tighter packing and greater leakage of steam. Vulcanized rubber solved this problem. It could be formed to precise shapes and dimensions, it accepted moderate to large deformations under load and recovered quickly to its original dimensions once the load is removed. These exceptional qualities, combined with good durability and lack of stickiness, were critical for an effective sealing material. Further experiments in the processing and compounding of rubber by Hancock and his colleagues led to a more reliable process.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

Around 1900, [[disulfiram]] was introduced as a vulcanizing agent, and became widely used.&lt;ref name=Kragh&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kragh |first1=Helge |title=From Disulfiram to Antabuse: The Invention of a Drug |journal=Bulletin for the History of Chemistry |date=2008 |volume=33 |issue=2 |pages=82-88 |url=http://www.scs.illinois.edu/~mainzv/HIST/bulletin_open_access/v33-2/v33-2%20p82-88.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1905 [[George Oenslager]] discovered that a derivative of [[aniline]] called [[thiocarbanilide]] accelerated the reaction of sulfur with rubber, leading to shorter cure times and [[Energy conservation|reducing energy consumption]]. This breakthrough was almost as fundamental to the rubber industry as Goodyear's sulfur cure. Accelerators made the cure process faster, improved the reliability of the process and enabled vulcanization to be applied to synthetic polymers. One year after his discovery, Oenslager had found hundreds of applications for his additive. Thus, the science of accelerators and retarders was born. An accelerator speeds up the cure reaction, while a retarder delays it. A typical retarder is [[cyclohexylthiophthalimide]]. In the subsequent century chemists developed other accelerators and ultra-accelerators, that are used in the manufacture of most modern rubber goods.

'''Thermate''' is a variation of [[thermite]] and is an [[incendiary ammunition|incendiary]] [[pyrotechnic composition]] that can generate short bursts of very high temperatures focused on a small area for a short period of time. It is used primarily in [[Grenade#Incendiary|incendiary grenades]]. 

The main chemical reaction in thermate is the same as in thermite: an [[aluminothermic reaction]] between powdered [[aluminium]] and a [[metal oxide]]. In addition to thermite, thermate also contains [[sulfur]] and sometimes [[barium nitrate]], both of which increase its thermal effect, create [[flame]] in burning, and significantly reduce the ignition temperature.&lt;ref name="DODPage"&gt;."Incendiary device".  US Patent {{cite patent|US|6766744}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various mixtures of these compounds can be called thermate, but to avoid confusion with thermate-TH3, one can refer to them as thermite variants or analogs.  The composition by weight of '''Thermate-TH3''' (in military use) is 68.7% thermite, 29.0% barium nitrate, 2.0% sulfur and 0.3% [[Binder (material)|binder]] (such as [[Polybutadiene acrylonitrile|PBAN]]). As both thermite and thermate are notoriously difficult to ignite, initiating the reaction normally requires supervision and sometimes persistent effort.

Because thermate burns at higher temperatures than ordinary thermite,&lt;ref name="DODPage" /&gt; it has military applications in cutting through tank armor or other hardened military vehicles or bunkers.  As with thermite, thermate's ability to burn without an external supply of [[oxygen]] renders it useful for underwater incendiary devices.

'''Tonewood''' refers to specific [[wood]] varieties that possess tonal properties that make them good choices for use in woodwind or acoustic stringed instruments.

==Varieties of tonewood==
As a rough generalization it can be said that stiff-but-light softwoods are favored for the soundboards or soundboard-like surface that transmits the vibrations of the strings to the ambient air. Hardwoods are favored for the body or framing element of an instrument. Woods used for woodwind instruments include African Blackwood, (Dalbergia melanoxylon), also known as Grenadilla wood, used in modern clarinets and oboes. Bassoons are usually made of maple, especially [[Acer platanoides]]. Wooden flutes, recorders, and baroque and classical period instruments may be made of various hardwoods, such as pear wood ([[Pyrus]] species), boxwood ([[Buxus]] species), or ebony ([[Diospyros]] species).

===Softwoods===
* [[Spruce]]s are often used in the sound boards of instruments from the [[lute]], [[violin]], [[oud]], [[mandolin]], [[guitar]], and [[harpsichord]] families; as well as the [[piano]].  Spruce is particularly suited for this use because of its high stiffness-to-weight ratio. Commonly used varieties are Sitka (or Alaskan) spruce (''[[Picea sitchensis]]''), Adirondack (or Red) spruce (''[[Picea rubens]]''), Engelmann spruce (''[[Picea engelmannii]]''), and ''[[Picea abies]]'' (variously known as Norwegian, German, Alpine, Italian or European spruce).
* [[Cedrus|Cedars]], particularly [[Western Redcedar]] (''Thuja plicata'', not a true cedar), have since the 1950s been used in the tops of classical guitars and to a less degree in steel string acoustic guitars.
* [[Yew]] was once widely used for [[lute]] bowls.
* Other softwoods, such as [[redwood]] and [[Douglas fir]] have been used to a limited degree.

===Hardwoods===
* [[Maple]] is traditionally used for the backs and sides of violin family instruments.  It is also frequently seen in acoustic guitars and mandolins.  Most [[Fender Musical Instruments Corporation|Fender]] electric guitars feature maple necks (it is one of the hardest and most stable tonewoods, so it is often used in the neck because of its ability to withstand high tension). Hard-rock maple is commonly used for wooden tripods for its vibration dampening properties. Variations of maple (commonly maple wood with flamed or quilted grains) are used on the tops of electric guitars for aesthetic purposes. The very sturdy frame of the modern piano is usually made of maple or of [[beech]]. 
* [[Mahogany]] may be used in the tops of some guitars as well as the back, sides, and necks of instruments of the [[mandolin]] and [[guitar]] families. Mahogany may also be used for the solid bodies of electric guitars, such as the [[Gibson Les Paul]].  Due to lack of availability other similar woods are used as mahogany replacements, such as [[Toona]], [[Khaya]], [[Shorea|Meranti]], [[Agathis]], [[Nato wood]] and [[Sapele]]. Some of these alternatives are Mahogany family timbers.
* [[Rosewood]]s are often used in the back and/or sides of guitars and mandolins and [[fretboards]] on guitars. The most sought-after variety, Brazilian Rosewood, ''[[Dalbergia nigra]]'', has become scarce and expensive due to severe trade restrictions (embargo and CITES), scarcity and demand. The most widely used rosewood used now is east Indian Rosewood, often paired with a spruce top for steel string guitars and with spruce or cedar for classical guitars.
* [[Koa]] is traditionally used for [[ukulele]]s.  Koa is also used for steel string guitars mostly due to its beauty and compressed dynamic range.
* [[Ebony]] is also often used in many types of instruments for [[fingerboard]]s, [[tailpiece]]s, tuning pegs, and so forth due to its attractive appearance, smoothness to the touch, hardness and wear resistance.  Several varieties of ebony are used.  Ebony is often dyed to make it appear more uniformly black than the natural wood, which sometimes shows brown streaks.
* [[Cocobolo]] used in upper-end clarinets and guitars.
* ''[[Paubrasilia]]'', commonly called Pernambuco or Brazilwood, is the most sought-after material for the bows of classical stringed instruments, because of its effects on the tones they produce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/saving-the-music-tree-101375575/ |title=Saving the Music Tree. |website=Smithsonian Magazine. |accessdate=2017-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Acacia melanoxylon|Blackwood]] (Tasmanian/Australian).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elliottguitars.com/alternate-woods1.html |title=Alternate Woods - Jeffrey R Elliott - Guitars hand crafted by Jeffrey Elliott |website=Elliottguitars.com |date= |accessdate=2016-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Walnut]] is often used for the backs and sides of guitars and mandolin family instruments.
* [[Fraxinus|Ash]], [[Alder]] and [[Basswood]] are commonly used for the bodies of electric guitars for their stiff properties.

==Selection of tonewoods==
In addition to perceived differences in acoustic properties, a luthier may use a tonewood because of:

* Availability
* Stability
* Cosmetic properties such as the color or grain of the wood
* Tradition
* Size (Some instruments require large pieces of suitable wood)

==Sources==
Many tonewoods come from sustainable sources through specialist dealers. Spruce, for example, is very common, but large pieces with even grain represent a small proportion of total supply and can be expensive. Some tonewoods are particularly hard to find on the open market, and small-scale instrument makers often turn to reclamation,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.michelettiguitars.com/Salvaged_Wood.htm |title=Acoustic Guitar Central: Recycled Tonewoods |website=Michelettiguitars.com |date= |accessdate=2016-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.guitarbench.com/2009/02/10/adrian-lucas-luthier-interview-mp3/ |title=Adrian Lucas.

Tonewood profile. &amp;#124; Guitarbench Magazine |website=Guitarbench.com |date=2009-11-04 |accessdate=2016-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mass market instrument manufacturers have started using Asian and African woods, such as Bubinga (''[[Guibourtia]]'' species) and Wenge (''[[Millettia laurentii]]''), as inexpensive alternatives to traditional tonewoods.

The [[Fiemme Valley]], in the Alps of Northern Italy, has long served as a source of high-quality spruce for musical instruments,&lt;ref&gt;See article posted by [[National Public Radio]]: [http://www.classicalmpr.org/story/2014/12/09/in-the-italian-alps-stradivari-s-trees-live-on], as well as the web site of [http://www.ciresafiemme.it/en.html Ciresa], a tonewood company based in the Fiemme Valley.&lt;/ref&gt; dating from the violins of [[Antonio Stradivari]] to the piano soundboards of the contemporary maker [[Fazioli]].

==Preparation==
Tonewood choices vary greatly among different instrument types.  Guitar makers generally favor [[quartersawn]] wood because it provides added stiffness and dimensional stability.  Soft woods, like spruce, may be split rather than sawn into boards so the board surface follows the grain as much as possible, thus limiting [[run-out]].

For most applications, wood must be dried before use, either in air or kilns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hvgb.net/~tonewood/servicepage.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-04-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110503050132/http://www.hvgb.net/~tonewood/servicepage.htm |archivedate=2011-05-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some luthiers prefer further seasoning for several years. Some guitar manufacturers subject the wood to [[rarefaction]], which mimics the natural aging process of tonewoods. [[Torrefaction]] is also used for this purpose, but it often changes the cosmetic properties of the wood.

'''Troy weight''' is a system of [[Physical unit|unit]]s of [[mass]] customarily used for [[precious metal]]s and [[gemstone]]s. One troy ounce (abbreviated "t oz" or "oz t") is equal to {{val|31.1034768|ul=grams}}, (or about 1.0971 oz. [[avoirdupois]], the "avoirdupois" ounce being the most common definition of an "ounce" in the US).&lt;ref name=nist&gt;https://www.nist.gov/file/330151 pdf National Institute of Standards and Technology - Handbook 44 - Appendix C - General Tables of Units of Measurement&lt;/ref&gt; There are only 12 troy ounces per troy pound, rather than the 16 ounces per pound found in the more common [[Avoirdupois | avoirdupois system]]. The avoirdupois pound has 7000 [[Grain (unit)|grains]] whereas the troy pound has only 5760  grains (i.e. 12 × 480 grains). Both systems use the same grain defined by the [[international yard and pound]] agreement of 1959 as  {{val|0.06479891|u=grams}}. Therefore, the troy ounce is {{convert|480|gr|sigfig=4|disp=or}}, compared with the avoirdupois ounce, which is {{convert|437.5|gr|disp=or}}. The troy ounce, then, is about 10% heavier (ratio 192/175) than the avoirdupois ounce. Although troy ounces are still used to weigh [[gold]], [[silver]], and [[gemstone]]s, troy weight is no longer used in most other applications. One troy ounce of [[Gold as an investment|gold]] is denoted with the [[ISO 4217|ISO 4217 currency code]] XAU, while one troy ounce of [[Silver as an investment|silver]] is denoted as XAG.&lt;ref name="currency-iso.org"&gt;{{Cite web

==Etymology==
Troy weight probably takes its name from the French market town of [[Troyes]] in France where English merchants traded at least as early as the early 9th century.&lt;ref name="OED3troy2"&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Oxford English Dictionary]]|chapter-url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/206831|date=June 2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, England|chapter=troy, n.&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;|quote=The received opinion is that it took its name from a weight used at the fair of Troyes in France}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Partridge|first=Eric|authorlink=Eric Partridge|title=Origins: A Short Etymological Dictionary of Modern English|year=1958|publisher=Routledge and Kegan Paul|location=London|page=3566|chapter=Trojan|oclc=250202885|quote=…the great fairs established for all Europe the weight-standard ''Troyes'', whence…''Troy''…}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name "troy" is first attested in 1390, describing the weight of a platter, in an account of the travels in Europe of the [[Henry IV of England#Relationship with Richard II|Earl of Derby]].&lt;ref name="OED3troy2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=L.

Charles Moore Watson (1844–1916) proposes an alternative etymology:  ''The Assize of Weights and Measures'' (also known as ''[[Weights and Measures Acts (UK)#Acts of Parliament|Tractatus de Ponderibus et Mensuris]]''), one of the [[statutes of uncertain date]] from the reign of either [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] or [[Edward I of England|Edward I]], thus before 1307, specifies "troni ponderacionem"—which the Public Record Commissioners translate as "troy weight".  The word "troni" refers to markets.  Watson finds the dialect word "troi", meaning a [[Weighing scale|balance]] in Wright's Dialect Dictionary.  Troy weight referred to the tower system; the earliest reference to the modern troy weights is in 1414.&lt;ref name="CMW1910"&gt;{{cite book|last=Watson|first=Charles Moore|title=British weights and measures as described in the laws of England from Anglo-Saxon times|url=https://archive.org/stream/britishweightsme00watsuoft/britishweightsme00watsuoft_djvu.txt|year=1910|publisher=John Murray|location=London|page=82|oclc=4566577|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160401195759/http://archive.org/stream/britishweightsme00watsuoft/britishweightsme00watsuoft_djvu.txt|archivedate=2016-04-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wright|first=Joseph|authorlink=Joseph Wright (linguist)|title=The English dialect dictionary|volume=6|year=1898|publisher=English Dialect Society|location=Oxford|page=250|oclc=63381077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Many aspects of the troy weight system were indirectly derived from the [[Roman currency|Roman monetary system]]. The [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] used bronze bars of varying weights as currency. An {{Lang|la|[[aes grave]]}} ("heavy bronze") weighed one [[Pound (mass)|pound]]. One twelfth of an {{lang|la|aes grave}} was called an {{lang|la|[[Ancient Roman units of measurement#Weight|uncia]]}}, or in English, an "ounce". Before the adoption of the metric system, many systems of troy weights were in use in various parts of Europe, among them Holland troy, Paris troy, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Kelly, LL.D. - [https://books.google.com/books?id=iqtLAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA20&amp;dq=%22The+Universal+Cambist%22+%22when+silver+is+sold+in+bars%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=L5q-TojYF6OziQK37cmoCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Universal Cambist and Commercial Instructor, Vol. 1] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170327193151/https://books.google.com/books?id=iqtLAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA20&amp;dq=%22The+Universal+Cambist%22+%22when+silver+is+sold+in+bars%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=L5q-TojYF6OziQK37cmoCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwAA |date=2017-03-27 }} p. 20 (1811)&lt;/ref&gt; Their values varied from one another by up to several percentage points. Troy weights were first used in England in the 15th century, and were made official for gold and silver in 1527.&lt;ref name="HallockWade1906"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hallock|first1=William|authorlink1=William Hallock|last2=Wade|first2=Herbert Treadwell|title=Outlines of the evolution of weights and measures and the metric system|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kJ0gAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA34|accessdate=14 August 2012|year=1906|publisher=The Macmillan company|location=London|page=34|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140105072502/http://books.google.com/books?id=kJ0gAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA34|archivedate=5 January 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The British Imperial system of weights and measures (also known as [[Imperial units]]) was established in 1824, prior to which the troy weight system was a subset of pre-Imperial [[English units]].

The troy ounce in use today is essentially the same as the British Imperial troy ounce (1824–1971), adopted as an official weight standard for [[United States]] coinage by Act of Congress on May 19, 1828.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The British Imperial troy ounce (known more commonly simply as the imperial troy ounce) was based on, and virtually identical with, the pre-1824 British troy ounce and the pre-1707 English troy ounce. (1824 was the year the British Imperial system of weights and measures was adopted, 1707 was the year of the [[Acts of Union 1707|Act of Union]] which created the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]].) Troy ounces have been used in England since about 1400 and the English troy ounce was officially adopted for coinage in 1527. Before that time, various sorts of troy ounces were in use on the continent.&lt;ref name="1977zupko"&gt;{{cite book

The troy ounce and grain were also part of the [[apothecaries' system]]. This was long used in medicine, but has now been largely replaced by the [[metric system]] (milligrams).&lt;ref name="dictionary.com"&gt;{{cite web | title=Troy Ounce | url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/troy%20ounce | work=WordNet 3.0, Dictionary.com | publisher=Princeton University | accessdate=2008-01-10 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080226004653/http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/troy%20ounce | archivedate=2008-02-26 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The only troy weight in widespread use today is the British Imperial troy ounce and its American counterpart. Both are currently based on a grain of 0.06479891&amp;nbsp;gram (exact, by definition), with 480 grains to a troy ounce (compared with {{frac|437|1|2}} grains for an ounce avoirdupois).

The British Empire abolished the 12-ounce troy pound in the 19th century, though it has been retained (although rarely used) in the American system.

===Origin===
The origin of the troy weight system is unknown. Although the name probably comes from the [[Champagne fairs]] at [[Troyes]], in northeastern France,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; the units themselves may be of more northern origin.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}} English troy weights were nearly identical to the troy weight system of [[Bremen]]. (The Bremen troy ounce had a mass of 480.8 British Imperial grains.)&lt;ref name="1977zupko"/&gt;

An alternative suggestion is that the weights come from the Muslim domains by way of the Gold [[Dirham|Dirhem]] (47.966 British Imperial grains), in the manner that [[King Offa]]'s weights were derived from the silver Dirhem (about 45.0 British grains).

According to Watson, troy relates to a dialect word '''troi''' (balance).  Then troy weight is a style of weighing, like [[auncel]] or [[bismar]] weights, or other kindred methods.  The troy weight then refers to weighing of small precious or potent goods, such as [[bullion]] and medicines.&lt;ref name="CMW1910"/&gt;

Troy ounces are still often used in precious metal markets in countries that otherwise use [[International System of Units]] (SI),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boerse-frankfurt.de/de/rohstoffe/xetra+gold|title=Börse Frankfurt: Aktien, Kurse, Charts und Nachrichten|author=|date=|website=www.boerse-frankfurt.de|accessdate=28 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151101044103/http://www.boerse-frankfurt.de/de/rohstoffe/xetra+gold|archivedate=1 November 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perthmint.com.au/education_uom.aspx|title=Units of Measure - The Perth Mint|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924071802/http://www.perthmint.com.au/education_uom.aspx|archivedate=2015-09-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; except in [[East Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.numismaster.com/ta/numis/Article.jsp?ArticleId=28158|title=Do grams or ounces win?|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160506234211/http://www.numismaster.com/ta/numis/Article.jsp?ArticleId=28158|archivedate=2016-05-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[People's Bank of China]], in particular, which has never historically used troy measurements, has begun issuing [[Chinese Gold Panda#The 2016 Panda gold coin|Gold Pandas]] minted according to [[International System of Units|SI weights]].

==Units of measurement==
[[File:comparison of pounds.svg|thumb|400px|Chart comparing the mass (in grams) of tower, Troy, merchant, avoirdupois and London pounds. Each colored block represents one ounce (gold=Troy, blue= avoirdupois, purple=tower)]]

=== Troy pound ===
The troy pound is 5 760&amp;nbsp;grains (≈ 373.24&amp;nbsp;g, 12&amp;nbsp;oz&amp;nbsp;t), while an [[avoirdupois]] pound is approximately 21.53% heavier at 7 000&amp;nbsp;grains (≈ 453.59&amp;nbsp;g).

=== Troy ounce (oz&amp;nbsp;t) ===
One troy ounce (oz&amp;nbsp;t) is equal to {{nowrap|31.103 476 8}} grams.
Also equal to {{nowrap|1.097 142 86}} avoirdupois ounces, exactly {{frac|192|175}}, or about 10% larger.

=== Pennyweight (dwt) ===
{{main|Pennyweight}}

The pennyweight symbol is ''dwt''. There are 24 grains in 1 dwt, and 20 dwt in one troy ounce. Because there were 12 troy ounces in the old troy pound, there would have been 240 pennyweights to the pound—the basis of the fact that the old [[pound sterling|British pound sterling]] of currency contained 240 pence. (However, prior to 1526, English [[pound sterling]] was based on the [[tower pound]], which is {{frac|15|16}} of a troy pound.) The ''d'' in ''dwt'' stands for ''[[denarius]]'', the ancient Roman coin that equates loosely to a penny. The symbol ''d'' for penny can be recognized in the notation for British pre-decimal pennies, in which pounds, shillings, and pence were indicated using the symbols ''£'', ''s'', and ''d'', respectively. For example, ''£6 11s 8d'' indicated six pounds, eleven shillings, and eight pence.

Mint weights, also known as ''moneyers' weights'' were legalised by Act of Parliament dated 17 July 1649 entitled ''An Act touching the monies and coins of England''. A grain is 20 mites, a mite is 24 droits, a droit is 20 perits, a perit is 24 blanks.&lt;ref name="Britain)1891"&gt;{{cite book|author=Philological Society (Great Britain)|title=A new English dictionary on historical principles: founded mainly on the materials collected by the Philological Society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k2xXAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA675|accessdate=21 April 2012|year=1891|publisher=Clarendon Press|page=675|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140627192804/http://books.google.com/books?id=k2xXAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA675|archivedate=27 June 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Miege"&gt;{{cite book|author=Miege, Guy|title=The Present State of Great Britain and Ireland|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BDs2AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA307&amp;lpg=PA307#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=6 June 2017|year=1738|publisher=J.

==Scottish system==
In Scotland, the Incorporation of Goldsmiths of the City of Edinburgh used a system in multiples of sixteen. (''See Assay-Master's Accounts, 1681–1702, on loan from the Incorporation to the National Archives of Scotland''.) Thus, there were 16 drops to the troy ounce, 16 ounces to the troy pound, and 16 pounds to the troy stone. The Scots had several other ways of measuring precious metals and gems, but this was the common usage for gold and silver.

The Pound was 7716 BI grains, but after the union, rounded to 7680 BI grains.  This divides to 16 ounces, each of 16 drops, each of 30 grains.  The rounding makes the ounce and grain equal to the English standard.

==Dutch system==
The Dutch troy system is based on a Mark, of 8 Ounces, the ounce of 20 Engels (pennyweight), the Engel of 32 As. The mark was rated as 3798 Grains, English troy, or 246.084 metric grams.  The divisions are identical to the tower system.&lt;ref name=Kelly&gt;{{cite book|last=Kelly|first=Patric|title=Universal Cambist|year=1835|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{English pounds}}

The troy system was used in the [[apothecaries' system]], but with different further subdivisions.

==Relationship to British coinage==
King [[Offa]]'s [[currency]] reform replaced the [[sceat]] with the [[silver]] [[penny]].  This coin was derived from half of a silver [[dirhem]].  The weights were then derived by a count of coins, by a mix of [[Charlemagne]] and [[Roman Empire|Roman]] systems.  A [[shilling]] was set to twelve [[pence]], an [[ounce]] to twenty pence, and a [[British pound|pound]] to twelve ounces or twenty shillings.  The penny was quite a lot of money, so weight by coins was not a general practice.

Later kings debased the coin, both in weight and fineness.  The original pound divided was the [[tower pound]] of 5400 [[grain]]s, but a later pound of 5760 grains displaced it.  Where once 240 pence made a tower pound (and 256 make a troy pound), by the time of the [[Weights and Measures Acts (UK)|United Kingdom Weights and Measures Act]] of 1824, a troy pound gives 792 silver pence, still minted as such as [[Maundy Money]].

[[Sterling silver|Sterling]] originally referred to the Norman silver penny of the late 11th century.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} The coin was minted to a fineness of 11 oz, 2 dwt (in the pound), or 925 [[Millesimal fineness]].

'''''Tulsa''''' is a 1949 American [[Technicolor]] [[western (genre)|Western]] [[action film]] directed by [[Stuart Heisler]] and starring [[Susan Hayward]] and [[Robert Preston (actor)|Robert Preston]], and featured [[Lloyd Gough]], [[Chill Wills]] (as the narrator), and [[Ed Begley]] in one of his earliest film [[Role (performing arts)|roles]], billed as Edward Begley.

The film's plot revolved around greed, conservation, and romance.&lt;ref name="all"/&gt; It was nominated for an Oscar for its special effects in 1950.&lt;ref name="imdawards"&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0041994/awards Tulsa (1949) - Awards] [https://www.imdb.com Internet Movie Database] (accessed June 7, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The plot revolved around the [[Tulsa, Oklahoma]] [[Petroleum|oil]] boom of the 1920s and detailed how obsession with accumulating [[wealth]] and power can tend to corrupt moral character.&lt;ref name="all"&gt;[http://www.allmovie.com/work/1:51201 Tulsa Plot Synopsis] (accessed June 7, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; The story begins with the death of rancher Nelse Lansing, who is killed by an oil well blowout while visiting a well operated by Tanner Petroleum to report that pollution from the oil production has killed some of his cattle.&lt;ref name="tcm"&gt;[http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title.jsp?stid=26005 Tulsa (1949) Synopsis] (accessed June 7, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; The plot thickens as Lansing's daughter, Cherokee, acquires drilling rights and meets Brad Brady, a geologist who wants the oil drillers to limit their drilling in order to minimize oil field depletion and to preserve the area's grasslands.&lt;ref name="tcm"/&gt;

A fire in a derrick tailing pool started by Jim Redbird, a Cherokee who had been made a rich owner of oil land through crooked dealings of oilmen, and who later renounces his holdings, results in an extravagant fire scene for which the movie got its Oscar nomination.&lt;ref name="all"/&gt; In its aftermath, in recognition of the destruction caused by improper oil drilling, and how money and power can corrupt even those who love the land, the oil drillers and the geologist learn to work together.&lt;ref name="all"/&gt;

==Cast==
* [[Susan Hayward]] as Cherokee Lansing
* [[Robert Preston (actor)|Robert Preston]] as Brad Brady
* [[Pedro Armendáriz]] as Jim Redbird
* [[Lloyd Gough]] as Bruce Tanner
* [[Chill Wills]] as Pinky Jimpson (narrator)
* [[Ed Begley]] as John J. 'Johnny' Brady (as Edward Begley)
* [[Jimmy Conlin]] as Homer Triplette
* Roland Jack as Steve, Cherokee's ranch hand

==Reception==
The film earned an estimated $1.6 million in the US.&lt;ref name="top"&gt;{{cite magazine|url=https://archive.org/stream/variety177-1950-01#page/n58/mode/1up|title=Top Grossers of 1949|magazine=Variety|date=4 January 1950|page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; It recorded a loss of $746,099.&lt;ref name="wagner"/&gt;

'''''Ultimate Tornado''''' is a documentary that first aired on the [[National Geographic Channel]] on April 12, 2006. It focuses on several unusually violent tornado events that have occurred in the United States, which include the  2004 [[Attica, Kansas]] tornado outbreak (F2-F4), the 1995 [[Pampa, Texas]] tornado (F4), the [[1997 Central Texas tornado outbreak|Jarrell tornado outbreak]] (F5), and the [[1999 Oklahoma tornado outbreak]] (F5). 

It last examined the possible effects of a theoretical F6 tornado hitting downtown [[Dallas, Texas]], postulating that this would be the worst tornado in history in terms of cost, damage, destruction and loss of life.

[[File:Soho Foundry.jpg|thumb|Main gate to Soho Foundry, head office of W&amp;T Avery]]
'''W &amp; T Avery Ltd.''' is a British manufacturer of [[weighing machine]]s. The company was founded in the early 18th century and took the name W &amp; T Avery in 1818. Having been taken over by [[General Electric Company plc|GEC]] in 1979 the company was later renamed into GEC-Avery. The company became [[Avery Berkel]] in 1993 when GEC acquired the Dutch company Berkel. After the take over by Weigh-Tronix in 2000 the company was again renamed to be called [[Avery Weigh-Tronix]]. The company is based in [[Smethwick]], West Midlands, United Kingdom.

==History==
[[File:Balance Roberval white.jpg|thumb|Set of scales made by Avery early 20th century]]
[[File:Yarloop wkshop gnangarra 14.jpg|thumb|Set of scales made by Avery in the 1960s]]
[[File:Leominster Museum - 2014-07-11 - Andy Mabbett - 16.JPG|thumb|An Avery weighing machine, for weighing a person, now in [[Leominster Museum]] ]]

The undocumented origin of the company goes back to 1730 when James Ford established the business in [[Digbeth]]. On Joseph Balden the then owner's death in 1813 William and Thomas Avery took over his scalemaking business and in 1818 renamed it W &amp; T Avery. The business rapidly expanded and in 1885 they owned three factories: the Atlas Works in West Bromwich, the Mill Lane Works in Birmingham and the Moat Lane Works in Digbeth. In 1891 the business became a limited company with a board of directors and in 1894 the shares were quoted on the London Stock Exchange. In 1895 the company bought the legendary [[Soho Foundry]] in Smethwick, a former steam engine factory owned by James Watt &amp; Co. In 1897 the move was complete and the steam engine business was gradually converted to pure manufacture of weighing machines. The turn of the century was marked by managing director William Hipkins' determined efforts in broadening the renown of the Avery brand and transforming the business into a specialist manufacturer of weighing machines.&lt;ref&gt;Hipkins died on the Titanic in 1912.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1914 the company occupied an area of 32,000m² and had some 3000 employees.

In the inter-war period the growth continued with the addition of specialised shops for cast parts, enamel paints and weighbridge assembly and the product range diversified into counting machines, testing machines, automatic packing machines and petrol pumps. During the second world war the company also produced various types of heavy guns. At that time the site underwent severe damage from parachute mines and incendiary bombs. 

From 1931 to 1973 the company occupied the 18th-century [[Middlesex Sessions House]] in [[Clerkenwell]] as its headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-first=Philip |editor-last=Temple |chapter=Clerkenwell Green |series=Survey of London |volume=46 |title=South and East Clerkenwell |place=New Haven, London |publisher=English Heritage |year=2008 |pages=86-114 |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=119413#s7 |ISBN=9780300137279 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Changes in weighing machine technology after World War II led to the closure of the foundry, the introduction of load cells and electronic weighing with the simultaneous gradual disappearance of purely mechanical devices.

The continued expansion was partly achieved through a series of acquisitions of other companies. The most important are:&lt;ref&gt;Source: Chapter Four of ''The General Electric Company Limited and Averys Limited: A Report on the Proposed Merger''&lt;/ref&gt;

*1959 Geo Driver &amp; Son Ltd.; merged in 1966 with Southall and Smith Ltd. to form Driver Southall Ltd.
*1968 Stanton Redcroft Ltd.
*1973 Telomex Ltd.

After almost a century of national and international expansion the company was taken over by [[General Electric Company plc|GEC]] in 1979. Keith Hodgkinson, managing director at the time, completed the turn-around from mechanical to electronic weighing with a complete overhaul of the product range of retail scales and industrial platform scales. In 1993 GEC took over the Dutch-based company Berkel and the Avery-Berkel name was introduced. In 2000 the business was in turn acquired by the US-American company Weigh-Tronix, who already owned Salter, and is today operating as Avery Weigh-Tronix.

In 2008 [[Illinois Tool Works]] Inc. purchased Avery Weigh-Tronix from its then owners, European Capital.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. [http://www.averyweigh-tronix.com/news/ ILLINOIS TOOL WORKS (ITW) PURCHASES AVERY WEIGH-TRONIX]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Properties==
Zerodur has both an [[amorphous]] (vitreous) component and a [[crystalline]] component. Its most important properties&lt;ref name="Schott2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.schott.com/advanced_optics/english/products/optical-materials/zerodur-zero-expansion-glass-ceramic/zerodur/index.html|title=ZERODUR® Extremely Low Expansion Glass Ceramic: SCHOTT Advanced Optics - SCHOTT AG|author=|date=|website=www.schott.com|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; are:
* Particularly low [[coefficient of thermal expansion|thermal expansion]]: in the range 0 to 50&amp;nbsp;°C it has a mean of 0 ± 0.007{{e|-6}} K&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, which is two orders of magnitude better than [[Fused quartz#Physical properties|that of fused quartz]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.schott.com/advanced_optics/english/syn/advanced_optics/products/optical-materials/zerodur-zero-expansion-glass-ceramic/zerodur/index.html SCHOTT CTE Grades] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004223930/http://www.schott.com/advanced_optics/english/syn/advanced_optics/products/optical-materials/zerodur-zero-expansion-glass-ceramic/zerodur/index.html |date=October 4, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="optomechanicalservices.com"&gt;http://optomechanicalservices.com/Papers.html&lt;/ref&gt;
* High 3D [[Homogeneity (physics)|homogeneity]]&lt;ref name="optomechanicalservices.com"/&gt; with few inclusions, bubbles and internal stria (as contrasted to [[Cer-Vit]]).
* Hardness similar to [[borosilicate glass]], so that it can be ground and polished more easily than [[fused quartz]].
* High affinity for [[Optical coating|coatings]].
* Low helium permeability.
* Non-porous (as contrasted to [[sintered]] ceramics).
* Good chemical stability similar to that of [[fused quartz]].
* [[Fracture toughness]] approximately 0.9 MPa·m&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name= "Viens1"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "Hartmann1"&gt;{{Cite web| last = Hartmann| first = P.| authorlink =| title = ZERODUR - Deterministic Approach for Strength Design| work = | publisher = NASA| date = 18 December 2012| url = http://opticalengineering.spiedigitallibrary.org/article.aspx?articleid=1486944| format = PDF| doi =| accessdate = 11 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
