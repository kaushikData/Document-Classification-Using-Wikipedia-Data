[[Colonel (United Kingdom)|Colonel]] '''Alexander Hepburne Macklin''' [[OBE]] [[Military Cross|MC]] [[Territorial Decoration|TD]] (1889 – 21 March 1967) was a British physician who served as one of the two surgeons on Sir [[Ernest Shackleton]]'s [[Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition]] of 1914–1917. In 1921–22 he joined Shackleton on his last [[Shackleton-Rowett Expedition|expedition]] on the ''Quest''.

==Early life==
Alexander Macklin was born in 1889 in [[British Raj|India]], where his father was a doctor. When the family returned to England Dr Macklin set up practice in the [[Scilly Isles]], where young Macklin became an enthusiastic and proficient boat handler.
He went to [[Plymouth College]] and then to the [[University of London]]. After working for a short time as a deckhand, he continued his education at the [[Victoria University of Manchester]], where he qualified as a doctor.

==Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition==
{{main|Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition}}
Soon after qualifying he applied to join Shackleton's expedition and was accepted. As well as his surgeon's duties he was put in charge of the ship's dogs and was also assigned a team of [[sled dog|sledge dogs]] to drive. The ''[[Endurance (1912 ship)|Endurance]]'' became trapped in the ice and was later crushed, forcing Shackleton to lead his men across the ice to open water where they travelled by boat to [[Elephant Island]]. After the ship became trapped in the ice, Macklin's dog team was put to work. He brought back several [[pinniped|seals]] that had been shot for food, and once the men began the long trek across the ice, he and the other dog teams were sent back to Ocean Camp (the first camp established near the ship) to fetch supplies. Eventually all the dogs had to be shot, but Macklin's team was the last to be killed.

After arriving at Elephant Island, Shackleton and five men took one of the boats, the ''[[James Caird (boat)|James Caird]]'', and set out to fetch help from [[South Georgia Island|South Georgia]]. Macklin and [[James McIlroy (surgeon)|McIlroy]], the other surgeon, were left behind as Shackleton knew the skills would be required more on the island than on the boat: [[Lewis Rickinson|Rickinson]] had a heart condition, [[Hubert Hudson|Hudson]] was suffering a nervous breakdown. [[Perce Blackborow|Blackborow]] had [[gangrene]] in his toes and shortly after the boat left, Macklin and McIlroy were forced to amputate all the toes on his left foot; Macklin gave him a [[chloroform]] [[anesthesia|anaesthetic]] while McIlroy removed the toes. Like most of the other ship's officers, Macklin was awarded the Silver [[Polar Medal]] for his efforts during the expedition.

==After the expedition==
On his return to England, Macklin gained a commission as a temporary lieutenant in the [[Royal Army Medical Corps]] (RAMC), with effect from 22 November 1916.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=29858|supp=y|page=12092|date=8 December 1916}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was promoted to temporary captain on 22 November 1917.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=30423|supp=y|page=12993|date=11 December 1917}}&lt;/ref&gt; During World War I he served in France, Russia and Italy. He won the [[Military Cross]] (MC) for bravery in tending the wounded under fire while serving in Italy. 

After the war, Macklin continued to serve with the RAMC, seeing service with the Allied Expeditionary Force in Northern Russia along with his old Boss, Shackleton. He rose to the acting rank of major on 4 May 1919&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=31462|supp=y|page=9116|date=15 July 1919}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, for his service in Russia, was appointed an [[Officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire|Officer of the Order of the British Empire]] on 11 November 1919&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=31764|supp=y|page=1376|date=30 January 1920}}&lt;/ref&gt; and awarded the Russian [[Order of Saint Stanislaus]].&lt;ref name=Wright&gt;Damien Wright. ''Shackleton's men in the Arctic: polar explorers and Arctic warfare in North Russia 1918–19''. Orders &amp; Medals Research Society Journal, September 2017, page 197.&lt;/ref&gt; He resigned his commission on 23 March 1920, retaining the rank of captain.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=31858|supp=y|page=4314|date=9 April 1920}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Together with former ''Endurance'' crew members [[Frank Worsley|Worsley]], [[Leonard Hussey|Hussey]], [[Frank Wild|Wild]], [[James McIlroy (surgeon)|McIlroy]], [[A.J. Kerr|Kerr]], [[Thomas MacLeod|MacLeod]] and Charles Green, Shackleton invited Macklin to join him for the [[Shackleton-Rowett Expedition]] in 1922 on board the ''[[Quest (ship)|Quest]]''. Shackleton had no fixed plans for the expedition; the ship put in at [[Rio de Janeiro]] and then headed for South Georgia. Shackleton was troubled with heart pain throughout the voyage, but despite Macklin's orders refused to rest. In Rio, Shackleton suffered a heart attack but would not let Macklin examine him. The ship landed in South Georgia on 4 January 1922. Early in the morning of 5 January, Macklin was called to Shackleton's quarters to find him having another heart attack. He died shortly after Macklin arrived. As the ship's surgeon, it was Macklin's role to prepare the body for burial on South Georgia.

In 1926 Macklin established a practice in [[Dundee]], where he would work for the next 21 years. At the start of World War II, he returned to active service as a major in the Medical Corps, serving in East Africa and rising to lieutenant-colonel. He received the [[Territorial Decoration]] (TD), and retired from the army in August 1948 with the honorary rank of colonel.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=38644|supp=y|page=3049|date=21 June 1949}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He married Jean in 1948 and moved to [[Aberdeen]] where he worked in various of the Aberdeen hospitals before retiring from full-time practice in 1960. He continued to work in the University Student Health Service for some years. He and Jean had two sons, Alexander and Richard. He died on 21 March 1967.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8936">'''Algorithmic learning theory''' is a mathematical framework for analyzing 
[[machine learning]] problems and algorithms. Synonyms include '''formal learning theory''' and '''algorithmic inductive inference'''. Algorithmic learning theory is different from [[statistical learning theory]] in that it does not make use of statistical assumptions and analysis. Both algorithmic and statistical learning theory are concerned with machine learning and can thus be viewed as branches of [[computational learning theory]].

==Distinguishing characteristics==

Unlike statistical learning theory and most statistical theory in general, algorithmic learning theory does not assume that data are random samples, that is, that data points are independent of each other. This makes the theory suitable for domains where observations are (relatively) noise-free but not random, such as language learning &lt;ref&gt;Jain, S. et al (1999): ''Systems That Learn'', 2nd ed. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and automated scientific discovery.&lt;ref&gt;Langley, P.; Simon, H.; Bradshaw, G. &amp; Zytkow, J. (1987), ''Scientific Discovery: Computational Explorations of the Creative Processes'', MIT Press, Cambridge&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schulte, O. (2009), ''Simultaneous Discovery of Conservation Laws and Hidden Particles With Smith Matrix Decomposition'', in Proceedings of the Twenty-First International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI-09), pp. 1481-1487&lt;/ref&gt;

The fundamental concept of algorithmic learning theory is learning in the limit: as the number of data points increases, a learning algorithm should converge to a correct hypothesis on ''every'' possible data sequence consistent with the problem space. This is a non-probabilistic version of [[Consistency (statistics)|statistical consistency]], 
which also requires convergence to a correct model in the limit, but allows a learner to fail on data sequences with probability measure 0.

Algorithmic learning theory investigates the learning power of [[Turing machine]]s. Other frameworks consider a much more restricted class of  learning algorithms than Turing machines, for example learners that compute hypotheses more quickly, for instance in [[polynomial time]]. An example of such a framework is [[probably approximately correct learning]].

==Learning in the limit==

The concept was introduced in [[E. Mark Gold]]'s seminal paper "[[Language identification in the limit]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}} [http://www.isrl.uiuc.edu/~amag/langev/paper/gold67limit.html The original paper.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090125120159/http://www.isrl.uiuc.edu/~amag/langev/paper/gold67limit.html |date=2009-01-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The objective of [[language identification]] is for a machine running one program to be capable of developing another program by which any given sentence can be tested to determine whether it is "grammatical" or "ungrammatical". The language being learned need not be [[english language|English]] or any other [[natural language]] - in fact the definition of "grammatical" can be absolutely anything known to the tester.

In Gold's learning model, the tester gives the learner an example sentence at each step, and the learner responds with a [[hypothesis]], which is a suggested [[computer program|program]] to determine grammatical correctness. It is required of the tester that every possible sentence (grammatical or not) appears in the list eventually, but no particular order is required. It is required of the learner that at each step the hypothesis must be correct for all the sentences so far.{{citation needed|reason=In his paper 'Language Identification in the Limit', Gold did not require this, see the definition of 'Learnability' on p.449.|date=November 2013}}

A particular learner is said to be able to "learn a language in the limit" if there is a certain number of steps beyond which its hypothesis no longer changes.{{citation needed|reason=Gold additionally required the hypothesis to be correct, see previous 'citation needed' remark.|date=November 2013}} At this point it has indeed learned the language, because every possible sentence appears somewhere in the sequence of inputs (past or future), and the hypothesis is correct for all inputs (past or future), so the hypothesis is correct for every sentence. The learner is not required to be able to tell when it has reached a correct hypothesis, all that is required is that it be true.

Gold showed that any language which is defined by a [[Turing machine]] program can be learned in the limit by another [[Turing-complete]] machine using [[enumeration]].{{clarify|reason=Gold introduces a methode called 'identification by enumeration' (p.458), but he didn't claim that each language 'defined by a Turing machine program can be learned' by that method, or by any other. Such a result would contradict the unlearnability result stated in the next section of this article.|date=November 2013}} This is done by the learner testing all possible Turing machine programs in turn until one is found which is correct so far - this forms the hypothesis for the current step. Eventually, the correct program will be reached, after which the hypothesis will never change again (but note that the learner does not know that it won't need to change).

Gold also showed that if the learner is given only positive examples (that is, only grammatical sentences appear in the input, not ungrammatical sentences), then the language can only be guaranteed to be learned in the limit if there are only a [[finite set|finite]] number of possible sentences in the language (this is possible if, for example, sentences are known to be of limited length).{{clarify|reason=The problem Gold investigated is not about learning a language, but about learning a language class. For example, it is trivial to learn an infinite language L from a class consisting of L only.) Gold's result meant here is probably that of his Theorem I.8 (p.470). The paragraph should be repharsed accordingly.|date=November 2013}}

Language identification in the limit is a highly abstract model. It does not allow for limits of [[Run time (program lifecycle phase)|runtime]] or [[computer memory]] which can occur in practice, and the enumeration method may fail if there are errors in the input. However the framework is very powerful, because if these strict conditions are maintained, it allows the learning of any program known to be computable. This is because a Turing machine program can be written to mimic any program in any conventional [[programming language]]. See [[Church-Turing thesis]].

==Other identification criteria==

Learning theorists have investigated other learning criteria,&lt;ref&gt;Jain, S. et al (1999): ''Systems That Learn'', 2nd ed. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt; such as the following.

* ''Efficiency'': minimizing the number of data points required before convergence to a correct hypothesis.
* ''Mind Changes'': minimizing the number of hypothesis changes that occur before convergence.&lt;ref&gt;Luo, W. &amp; Schulte, O. (2005), ''Mind Change Efficient Learning'', in Peter Auer &amp; Ron Meir, ed., Proceedings of the Conference on Learning Theory (COLT), pp. 398-412&lt;/ref&gt;

Mind change bounds are closely related to [[Winnow algorithm#Mistake bounds|mistake bounds]] that are studied in [[statistical learning theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Jain, S. and Sharma, A. (1999), ''On a generalized notion of mistake bounds'', Proceedings of the Conference on Learning Theory (COLT), pp.249-256.&lt;/ref&gt;  Kevin Kelly has suggested that minimizing mind changes is closely related to choosing maximally simple hypotheses in the sense of [[Occam’s Razor]].&lt;ref&gt;Kevin T. Kelly (2007), ''Ockham’s Razor, Empirical Complexity, and Truth-finding Efficiency'', Theoretical Computer Science, 383: 270-289.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Amin Faghiri''' (30 Shiraz Persian date Azar 1322 AH, 22 December 1943 CE) is an Iranian researcher and writer.

== Early life ==

Amin Faghiri is from [[Shiraz]] and was born into a large family. He had a difficult childhood.  ''Pour with the rain'' is a documentary about him&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |title=پای صحبت کارگردان موفق بین المللی که در جشنواره‌های ملی جایی ندارد |newspaper= |location= |pages= |language= Persian |publisher=خبرگزاری ایرنا |date=8 January 2018 |url=http://www.irna.ir/fa/News/82788893 | access-date = 28 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Ali Zare Ghanat Nowi]] which is going to be released soon.

== Writing ==

His early difficulties led him to write short stories. He had a precise method and style of writing. His stories employed [[realism (arts)|realism]] and an honest [[visual style]].

His first collection of short stories took four years to write. At the age of 23, he published ''Primal''. The book was published five times before the [[Iranian revolution]]. The sixth edition was published in 1382 (2003 CE). In the book, he described the loneliness and boredom of rural teachers. He also told stories of peasant violence and the [[sociological]] persecution they faced. Faghiri, alongside [[Mahoud Dowlat Abadi]], was one of the first Iranian rural story writers. The stories in the collection have been translated into more than a dozen languages, including English, German, Russian, Urdu, Italian, French, and Japanese. He has nineteen books in total.

== Honors ==
Faghiri won the Golden Tablet for best fiction in 1376 (1997 CE).

The '''BP Structure''', also known as '''Gebel Dalma''', is an exposed [[impact crater]] in [[Libya]]. It is so called because it was identified by a [[BP]] (then British Petroleum) geological survey team.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Earth Impact DB | name = BP | linkname = bpstructure | accessdate = 2009-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The crater is 2&amp;nbsp;km in [[diameter]] and its age is estimated to be less than 120 million years ([[Lower Cretaceous]] or later).

The '''bilinear transform''' (also known as '''[[Arnold Tustin|Tustin]]'s method''') is used in [[digital signal processing]] and discrete-time [[control theory]] to transform continuous-time system representations to discrete-time and vice versa.

The bilinear transform is a special case of a [[conformal map]]ping (namely, a [[Möbius transformation]]), often used to convert a [[transfer function]] &lt;math&gt; H_a(s) \ &lt;/math&gt; of a [[linear]], [[time-invariant]] ([[LTI system theory|LTI]]) filter in the [[continuous function|continuous]]-time domain (often called an [[analog filter]]) to a transfer function &lt;math&gt; H_d(z) \ &lt;/math&gt; of a linear, shift-invariant filter in the [[discrete signal|discrete]]-time domain (often called a [[digital filter]] although there are analog filters constructed with [[switched capacitor]]s that are discrete-time filters). It maps positions on the &lt;math&gt; j \omega \ &lt;/math&gt; axis, &lt;math&gt; Re[s]=0 \ &lt;/math&gt;, in the [[s-plane]] to the [[unit circle]], &lt;math&gt; |z| = 1 \ &lt;/math&gt;, in the [[complex plane|z-plane]].  Other bilinear transforms can be used to warp the [[frequency response]] of any discrete-time linear system (for example to approximate the non-linear frequency resolution of the human auditory system) and are implementable in the discrete domain by replacing a system's unit delays &lt;math&gt; \left( z^{-1} \right) \ &lt;/math&gt; with first order [[all-pass filter]]s.

The transform preserves [[BIBO stability|stability]] and maps every point of the [[frequency response]] of the continuous-time filter, &lt;math&gt; H_a(j \omega_a) \ &lt;/math&gt; to a corresponding point in the frequency response of the discrete-time filter, &lt;math&gt; H_d(e^{j \omega_d T}) \ &lt;/math&gt; although to a somewhat different frequency, as shown in the [[#Frequency warping|Frequency warping]] section below.  This means that for every feature that one sees in the frequency response of the analog filter, there is a corresponding feature, with identical gain and phase shift, in the frequency response of the digital filter but, perhaps, at a somewhat different frequency.  This is barely noticeable at low frequencies but is quite evident at frequencies close to the [[Nyquist frequency]].

== Discrete-time approximation ==
The bilinear transform is a first-order approximation of the natural logarithm function that is an exact mapping of the ''z''-plane to the ''s''-plane.  When the [[Laplace transform]] is performed on a discrete-time signal (with each element of the discrete-time sequence attached to a correspondingly delayed [[Dirac delta function|unit impulse]]), the result is precisely the [[Z transform]] of the discrete-time sequence with the substitution of

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
z &amp;= e^{sT}   \\
  &amp;= \frac{e^{sT/2}}{e^{-sT/2}} \\
  &amp;\approx \frac{1 + s T / 2}{1 - s T / 2}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; T \ &lt;/math&gt; is the [[numerical integration]] step size of the [[trapezoidal rule]] used in the bilinear transform derivation;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Discrete Time Signal Processing Third Edition |last=Oppenheim |first=Alan |year=2010 |publisher=Pearson Higher Education, Inc. |location=Upper Saddle River, NJ |isbn=978-0-13-198842-2 |page=504}}&lt;/ref&gt; or, in other words, the sampling period. The above bilinear approximation can be solved for &lt;math&gt; s \ &lt;/math&gt; or a similar approximation for &lt;math&gt; s = (1/T) \ln(z) \  \ &lt;/math&gt; can be performed.

The inverse of this mapping (and its first-order bilinear [[Logarithm#Power series|approximation]]) is

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
s &amp;= \frac{1}{T} \ln(z)  \\
  &amp;= \frac{2}{T} \left[\frac{z-1}{z+1} + \frac{1}{3} \left( \frac{z-1}{z+1} \right)^3  + \frac{1}{5} \left( \frac{z-1}{z+1} \right)^5  + \frac{1}{7} \left( \frac{z-1}{z+1} \right)^7 + \cdots \right] \\
  &amp;\approx  \frac{2}{T} \frac{z - 1}{z + 1} \\
  &amp;=  \frac{2}{T} \frac{1 - z^{-1}}{1 + z^{-1}}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The bilinear transform essentially uses this first order approximation and substitutes into the continuous-time transfer function, &lt;math&gt; H_a(s) \ &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;s \leftarrow \frac{2}{T} \frac{z - 1}{z + 1}.&lt;/math&gt;

That is

:&lt;math&gt;H_d(z) = H_a(s) \bigg|_{s = \frac{2}{T} \frac{z - 1}{z + 1}}= H_a \left( \frac{2}{T} \frac{z-1}{z+1} \right). \ &lt;/math&gt;

== Stability and minimum-phase property preserved ==
A continuous-time causal filter is [[BIBO stability|stable]] if the [[Pole (complex analysis)|poles]] of its transfer function fall in the left half of the [[complex number|complex]] [[s-plane]]. A discrete-time causal filter is stable if the poles of its transfer function fall inside the [[unit circle]] in the [[complex plane|complex z-plane]]. The bilinear transform maps the left half of the complex s-plane to the interior of the unit circle in the z-plane. Thus, filters designed in the continuous-time domain that are stable are converted to filters in the discrete-time domain that preserve that stability.

Likewise, a continuous-time filter is [[minimum-phase]] if the [[Zero (complex analysis)|zeros]] of its transfer function fall in the left half of the complex s-plane. A discrete-time filter is minimum-phase if the zeros of its transfer function fall inside the unit circle in the complex z-plane. Then the same mapping property assures that continuous-time filters that are minimum-phase are converted to discrete-time filters that preserve that property of being minimum-phase.

== Example ==
As an example take a simple [[low-pass]] [[RC filter]].  This continuous-time filter has a transfer function

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
H_a(s) &amp;= \frac{1/sC}{R+1/sC} \\
&amp;= \frac{1}{1 + RC s}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

If we wish to implement this filter as a digital filter, we can apply the bilinear transform by substituting for &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; the formula above; after some reworking, we get the following filter representation:

:{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;H_d(z) \ &lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt; =H_a \left( \frac{2}{T} \frac{z-1}{z+1}\right) \ &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;= \frac{1}{1 + RC \left( \frac{2}{T} \frac{z-1}{z+1}\right)} \ &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;= \frac{1 + z}{(1 - 2 RC / T) + (1 + 2RC / T) z} \ &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;= \frac{1 + z^{-1}}{(1 + 2RC / T) + (1 - 2RC / T) z^{-1}}. \ &lt;/math&gt;
|}

The coefficients of the denominator are the 'feed-backward' coefficients and the coefficients of the numerator are the 'feed-forward' coefficients used to implement a real-time [[digital filter]].

== General second-order biquad transformation ==
It is possible to relate the coefficients of a continuous-time, analog filter with those of a similar discrete-time digital filter created through the bilinear transform process. Transforming a general, second-order continuous-time filter with the given transfer function

:&lt;math&gt;H_a(s) = \frac{b_0 s^2 + b_1 s + b_2}{a_0 s^2 + a_1 s + a_2} = \frac{b_0 + b_1 s^{-1} + b_2 s^{-2}}{a_0 + a_1 s^{-1} + a_2 s^{-2}}&lt;/math&gt;

using the bilinear transform (without prewarping any frequency specification) requires the substitution of

:&lt;math&gt;s \leftarrow K \frac{1 - z^{-1}}{1 + z^{-1}}&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;K \triangleq \frac{2}{T} &lt;/math&gt;.

However, if the frequency warping compensation as described below is used in the bilinear transform, so that both analog and digital filter gain and phase agree at frequency &lt;math&gt;\omega_0&lt;/math&gt;, then

:&lt;math&gt;K \triangleq \frac{\omega_0}{\tan\left(\frac{\omega_0 T}{2}\right)} &lt;/math&gt;.

This results in a discrete-time [[digital biquad filter]] with coefficients expressed in terms of the coefficients of the original continuous time filter:
:&lt;math&gt;H_d(z)=\frac{(b_0 K^2 + b_1 K + b_2) + (2b_2 - 2b_0 K^2)z^{-1} + (b_0 K^2 - b_1 K + b_2)z^{-2}}{(a_0 K^2 + a_1 K + a_2) + (2a_2 - 2a_0 K^2)z^{-1} + (a_0 K^2 - a_1 K + a_2)z^{-2}}&lt;/math&gt;

Normally the constant term in the denominator must be normalized to 1 before deriving the corresponding [[difference equation]].  This results in

:&lt;math&gt;H_d(z)=\frac{\frac{b_0 K^2 + b_1 K + b_2}{a_0 K^2 + a_1 K + a_2} + \frac{2b_2 - 2b_0 K^2}{a_0 K^2 + a_1 K + a_2}z^{-1} + \frac{b_0 K^2 - b_1 K + b_2}{a_0 K^2 + a_1 K + a_2}z^{-2}}{1 + \frac{2a_2 - 2a_0 K^2}{a_0 K^2 + a_1 K + a_2}z^{-1} + \frac{a_0 K^2 - a_1 K + a_2}{a_0 K^2 + a_1 K + a_2}z^{-2}}. &lt;/math&gt;

The difference equation (using the [[Digital filter#Direct Form I|Direct Form I]]) is

:&lt;math&gt;
y[n] = \frac{b_0 K^2 + b_1 K + b_2}{a_0 K^2 + a_1 K + a_2} \cdot x[n] + \frac{2b_2 - 2b_0 K^2}{a_0 K^2 + a_1 K + a_2} \cdot x[n-1] + \frac{b_0 K^2 - b_1 K + b_2}{a_0 K^2 + a_1 K + a_2} \cdot x[n-2] - \frac{2a_2 - 2a_0 K^2}{a_0 K^2 + a_1 K + a_2} \cdot y[n-1] - \frac{a_0 K^2 - a_1 K + a_2}{a_0 K^2 + a_1 K + a_2} \cdot y[n-2] \ .
&lt;/math&gt;

== Frequency warping ==
To determine the frequency response of a continuous-time filter, the [[transfer function]] &lt;math&gt; H_a(s) &lt;/math&gt; is evaluated at &lt;math&gt;s = j \omega_a &lt;/math&gt; which is on the &lt;math&gt; j \omega &lt;/math&gt; axis.  Likewise, to determine the frequency response of a discrete-time filter, the transfer function &lt;math&gt; H_d(z) &lt;/math&gt; is evaluated at &lt;math&gt;z = e^{ j \omega_d T} &lt;/math&gt; which is on the unit circle, &lt;math&gt; |z| = 1 &lt;/math&gt;.  The bilinear transform maps the &lt;math&gt; j \omega &lt;/math&gt; axis of the ''s''-plane (of which is the domain of &lt;math&gt; H_a(s) &lt;/math&gt;) to the unit circle of the ''z''-plane, &lt;math&gt; |z| = 1 &lt;/math&gt; (which is the domain of &lt;math&gt; H_d(z) &lt;/math&gt;), but it is '''not''' the same mapping &lt;math&gt; z = e^{sT} &lt;/math&gt; which also maps the &lt;math&gt; j \omega &lt;/math&gt; axis to the unit circle.  When the actual frequency of &lt;math&gt; \omega_d &lt;/math&gt; is input to the discrete-time filter designed by use of the bilinear transform, then it is desired to know at what frequency, &lt;math&gt; \omega_a &lt;/math&gt;, for the continuous-time filter that this &lt;math&gt; \omega_d &lt;/math&gt; is mapped to.

:&lt;math&gt;H_d(z) = H_a \left( \frac{2}{T} \frac{z-1}{z+1}\right) &lt;/math&gt;

:{|
|-
|&lt;math&gt;H_d(e^{ j \omega_d T}) &lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;= H_a \left( \frac{2}{T} \frac{e^{ j \omega_d T} - 1}{e^{ j \omega_d T} + 1}\right) &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;= H_a \left( \frac{2}{T} \cdot \frac{e^{j \omega_d T/2} \left(e^{j \omega_d T/2} - e^{-j \omega_d T/2}\right)}{e^{j \omega_d T/2} \left(e^{j \omega_d T/2} + e^{-j \omega_d T/2 }\right)}\right) &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;= H_a \left( \frac{2}{T} \cdot \frac{\left(e^{j \omega_d T/2} - e^{-j \omega_d T/2}\right)}{\left(e^{j \omega_d T/2} + e^{-j \omega_d T/2 }\right)}\right) &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;= H_a \left(j \frac{2}{T} \cdot \frac{ \left(e^{j \omega_d T/2} - e^{-j \omega_d T/2}\right) /(2j)}{\left(e^{j \omega_d T/2} + e^{-j \omega_d T/2 }\right) / 2}\right) &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;= H_a \left(j \frac{2}{T} \cdot \frac{ \sin(\omega_d T/2) }{ \cos(\omega_d T/2) }\right) &lt;/math&gt;
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;= H_a \left(j \frac{2}{T} \cdot \tan \left( \omega_d T/2 \right) \right) &lt;/math&gt;
|}

This shows that every point on the unit circle in the discrete-time filter z-plane, &lt;math&gt;z = e^{ j \omega_d T}&lt;/math&gt; is mapped to a point on the &lt;math&gt;j \omega&lt;/math&gt; axis on the continuous-time filter s-plane, &lt;math&gt;s = j \omega_a&lt;/math&gt;. That is, the discrete-time to continuous-time frequency mapping of the bilinear transform is

:&lt;math&gt; \omega_a = \frac{2}{T} \tan \left( \omega_d \frac{T}{2} \right) &lt;/math&gt;

and the inverse mapping is

:&lt;math&gt; \omega_d = \frac{2}{T} \arctan \left( \omega_a \frac{T}{2} \right). &lt;/math&gt;

The discrete-time filter behaves at frequency &lt;math&gt;\omega_d&lt;/math&gt; the same way that the continuous-time filter behaves at frequency &lt;math&gt; (2/T) \tan(\omega_d T/2) &lt;/math&gt;.  Specifically, the gain and phase shift that the discrete-time filter has at frequency &lt;math&gt;\omega_d&lt;/math&gt; is the same gain and phase shift that the continuous-time filter has at frequency &lt;math&gt;(2/T) \tan(\omega_d T/2)&lt;/math&gt;.  This means that every feature, every "bump" that is visible in the frequency response of the continuous-time filter is also visible in the discrete-time filter, but at a different frequency.  For low frequencies (that is, when &lt;math&gt;\omega_d \ll 2/T&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\omega_a \ll 2/T&lt;/math&gt;), then the features are mapped to a ''slightly'' different frequency; &lt;math&gt;\omega_d \approx \omega_a &lt;/math&gt;.

One can see that the entire continuous frequency range

: &lt;math&gt; -\infty &lt; \omega_a &lt; +\infty &lt;/math&gt;

is mapped onto the fundamental frequency interval

: &lt;math&gt; -\frac{\pi}{T} &lt; \omega_d &lt; +\frac{\pi}{T}. &lt;/math&gt;

The continuous-time filter frequency &lt;math&gt; \omega_a = 0 &lt;/math&gt; corresponds to the discrete-time filter frequency &lt;math&gt; \omega_d = 0 &lt;/math&gt; and the continuous-time filter frequency &lt;math&gt; \omega_a = \pm \infty &lt;/math&gt; correspond to the discrete-time filter frequency &lt;math&gt; \omega_d = \pm \pi / T. &lt;/math&gt;

One can also see that there is a nonlinear relationship between &lt;math&gt; \omega_a \ &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \omega_d.&lt;/math&gt;  This effect of the bilinear transform is called '''frequency warping'''. The continuous-time filter can be designed to compensate for this frequency warping by setting &lt;math&gt; \omega_a = \frac{2}{T} \tan \left( \omega_d \frac{T}{2} \right) &lt;/math&gt; for every frequency specification that the designer has control over (such as corner frequency or center frequency).  This is called '''pre-warping''' the filter design.

It is possible, however, to compensate for the frequency warping by pre-warping a frequency specification &lt;math&gt; \omega_0 &lt;/math&gt; (usually a resonant frequency or the frequency of the most significant feature of the frequency response) of the continuous-time system.  These pre-warped specifications may then be used in the bilinear transform to obtain the desired discrete-time system. When designing a digital filter as an approximation of a continuous time filter, the frequency response (both amplitude and phase) of the digital filter can be made to match the frequency response of the continuous filter at a specified frequency &lt;math&gt; \omega_0 &lt;/math&gt;, as well as matching at DC, if the following transform is substituted into the continuous filter transfer function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Astrom |first=Karl J. |date=1990 |title=Computer Controlled Systems, Theory and Design |edition=Second |publisher=Prentice-Hall |page=212 |isbn=0-13-168600-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a modified version of Tustin's transform shown above.

:&lt;math&gt;s \leftarrow \frac{\omega_0}{\tan\left(\frac{\omega_0 T}{2}\right)} \frac{z - 1}{z + 1}.&lt;/math&gt;

However, note that this transform becomes the original transform

:&lt;math&gt;s \leftarrow \frac{2}{T} \frac{z - 1}{z + 1}&lt;/math&gt;

as &lt;math&gt; \omega_0 \to 0 &lt;/math&gt;.

The main advantage of the warping phenomenon is the absence of aliasing distortion of the frequency response characteristic, such as observed with [[Impulse invariance]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2016">'''Binary liquid''' is a type of [[chemical]] combination, which creates a special reaction or feature as a result of two [[liquid]] chemicals, normally inert or having no function by themselves, being mixed. A number of chemical products are produced as a result of mixing two chemicals as a binary liquid, such as [[plastic]] foams and some [[explosives]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1178">A '''bridesman''' is a close male relative and/or friend of the bride, one who walks down the aisle in the bridal ceremony in the traditional place of a [[bridesmaid]].

The term, however, has an ancient and obscure, possibly [[Confabulation|confabulated]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lexic.us/definition-of/bridemen#literary|title=Literary usage of Bridemen |publisher=Lexus.us}}&lt;/ref&gt; origin. The term is first noted by the [[Encyclopaedia Judaica]] from the European Jewish Diaspora of the middle of the 13th century. In this context, a bridesman was not a friend of the bride but of the groom. He paid for and arranged the wedding from his own money and would be repaid someday by the groom. It was a position of the highest level of honor in male friendship. It was akin to the modern-day [[best man]]. 

In [[Hungary]], where the word for bridesman is "[[vőfély]]" or sometimes "vőfény" (depending on the region), the ancient tradition of the bridesman is still very popular. The vőfély is the "spokesman" of the bridegroom ("vő" means son-in-law).

The '''Carnegie Science Center''' is one of the four [[Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh|Carnegie Museums]] of [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]]. It is located in the [[Chateau (Pittsburgh)|Chateau]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.city.pittsburgh.pa.us/cp/maps/chateau.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100726114703/http://www.city.pittsburgh.pa.us/cp/maps/chateau.html |archivedate=2010-07-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; neighborhood. It is located across the street from [[Heinz Field]].

==Overview==
The Carnegie Science Center is the most visited museum in Pittsburgh. It has four floors of interactive exhibits. Among its attractions are the Buhl Planetarium (which features the latest in digital projection technology), the Rangos Omnimax Theater (promoted as "the biggest screen in Pittsburgh"), [[Highmark SportsWorks|SportsWorks]], the [[Miniature Railroad &amp; Village]], the [[USS Requin (SS-481)|USS ''Requin'']] (a [[World War II]] [[submarine]]) and Roboworld, touted as "the world's largest permanent [[robotics]] exhibition." The Roboworld exhibition contains more than 30 interactive displays featuring "all things robotic", and is also the first physical home for [[Carnegie Mellon University]]’s [[Robot Hall of Fame]]. It is closed on Sundays when there is a Steelers home game.

==Updates==
According to Nicholas Efran, "The Carnegie Science Center has been a gathering place for kids and families for many years." However, currently there are many new exhibits that staff are "Not able to include because of the smaller size of the building"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.carnegiesciencecenter.org|title=Carnegie Science Center: Home|website=www.carnegiesciencecenter.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now undergoing construction to add a new wing to the building. (As of December 2017)

==History==
Its predecessor was the [[Buhl Planetarium and Institute of Popular Science Building|Buhl Planetarium and Institute of Popular Science]], which opened on October 24, 1939. The Buhl Planetarium was the fifth major [[planetarium]] in the [[United States]], and was popular for several decades.  However, by the 1980s it had begun to show signs of age. An expansion was ruled out, so the Institute was relocated to the Chateau neighborhood. However, it became apparent to the Buhl Institute that the relocation efforts would require more staffing than they were able to provide. At this point, the [[Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh|Carnegie Institute]] (under the leadership of [[Robert Wilburn]]) stepped in, showing interest in merging with the Buhl Institute. Both parties agreed to the merger in 1987. On October 5, 1989, construction began on the $40 million building, which was renamed the Carnegie Science Center as a result of the merger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r3HxNErlwt4C&amp;pg=PA188&amp;lpg=PA188&amp;dq=%22carnegie+science+center%22+1989+$+million&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ZGr0bUUB5P&amp;sig=aVb7TfmvWVDS3IISrbO1IAwJAyc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ZtUwVLHOA46jyATyi4LIBA&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=%22carnegie%20science%20center%22%201989%20%24%20million&amp;f=false |title=Twentieth-century Pittsburgh: The post-steel era |author=Roy Lubove |page=188 |website=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2016-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Henry Buhl, Jr. Planetarium and Observatory was reinvented in this new facility. The Center opened in October 1991.&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carnegiesciencecenter.org/about/about-our-history/ |title=Our History |publisher=Carnegie Science Center |date= |accessdate=2016-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Roboworld==
[[File:Roboworld at Carnegie Science Center.JPG|thumb|Roboworld at the Carnegie Science Center.]]
The Roboworld area is the second-floor attraction at the Carnegie Science Center. It is touted as "the world's largest permanent robotics exhibition", with more than 30 interactive displays featuring "all things robotic".

The first [[robot]] encounter in Roboworld is [[Android (robot)|Andy Roid]], the Robothespian. He is an [[Interactivity|interactive]], [[animatronic]] robot that introduces visitors to the concepts of robotic sensing, thinking, and acting. The area's other exhibits showcase different types of robots, and videos containing more information about them.

The Robot Hall of Fame features famous robots from [[science fiction]] films, television, and video games, such as [[R2-D2]], [[C-3PO]], [[Data (Star Trek)|Data]], [[Terminator (character)|the T-800 Terminator]], [[R.O.B.]], [[Maschinenmensch]], [[Gort (The Day the Earth Stood Still)|Gort]], [[Robby the Robot]], [[Robot B-9]], [[HAL 9000]], and Huey, Dewey, and Louie from ''[[Silent Running]]''.

==Highmark SportsWorks==
'''Highmark SportsWorks''' (formerly '''UPMC SportsWorks''') is one of the major, permanent exhibits of the Carnegie Science Center.  It is one of larger science and sports exhibitions in the world, with over 30 interactive experiences in which visitors can participate.  SportsWorks features three themed areas:  Physics of Sports (exploring the science of balance, trajectory, center of gravity, momentum, etc.), LifeWorks (featuring information for keeping a healthy lifestyle), and Sports Challenge (demonstrating various physical activities present in many sports).

The previous sponsor, [[University of Pittsburgh Medical Center|UPMC]], ended its sponsorship of SportsWorks in 2006. On November 13, 2008, the Carnegie Science Center unveiled plans for a new {{convert|12000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} SportsWorks, sponsored by [[Highmark]].  It reopened in the Fall of 2009. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carnegiesciencecenter.org/default.aspx?pageId=39 |title=Carnegie Science Center |website=Carnegiesciencecenter.org |accessdate=2016-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From October 8, 2007 until May 2008, SportsWorks housed the controversial exhibit [[BODIES... The Exhibition]].  At least one employee of the Carnegie Science Center left her job due to the implementation of this exhibit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/07175/796418-109.stm |title=Sunday Forum: Exhibition of exploitation &amp;#124; Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |website=Post-gazette.com |date=2007-06-22 |accessdate=2016-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A committee of the [[Port authority of allegheny county|Pittsburgh Port Authority]] recommended in 2007 that the site be purchased and that SportsWorks be demolished to allow for construction of tracks for the [[North Shore Connector]], an extension of Pittsburgh's light rail line to the North Side of Pittsburgh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Silver |first=Jonathan D. |url=http://www.postgazette.com/pg/07264/819450-100.stm |title=Port Authority plans to buy, demolish SportsWorks &amp;#124; Pittsburgh Post-Gazette |website=Postgazette.com |date=2007-09-21 |accessdate=2016-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==E-motion cone==
The ''E-motion cone'' is a white-colored, inverted cone which sits atop the Science Center building. It was installed in 2000. At night, it is lit with different colors, [[weather beacon|signalling]] the weather forecast for the coming day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carnegiesciencecenter.org/about/about-emotion/ |title=E-Motion Cone |publisher=Carnegie Science Center |date= |accessdate=2016-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pittsburghartplaces.org/accounts/view/272 |title=Pittsburgh Art Places |publisher=Pittsburgh Art Places |date= |accessdate=2016-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this visualization, the [[Big Bang]] took place at the beginning of January 1 at midnight, and the current moment maps onto the end of December 31 just before midnight.&lt;ref name="astrosocietyorg"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Universe At Your Fingertips Activity: Cosmic Calendar|url=http://www.astrosociety.org/education/astro/act2/cosmic.html|year=1995|author=Therese Puyau Blanchard|accessdate=2007-12-15|publisher=[[Astronomical Society of the Pacific]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071216233615/http://www.astrosociety.org/education/astro/act2/cosmic.html|archivedate=2007-12-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
At this scale, there are 437.5 years per second, 1.575 million years per hour, and 37.8 million years per day.

The concept was popularized by [[Carl Sagan]] in his book ''[[The Dragons of Eden]]'' (1977) and on his television series ''[[Cosmos: A Personal Voyage|Cosmos]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa1ImgOcOPM&amp;t=52m55s Cosmos, episode 1 (1980)]&lt;/ref&gt; Sagan goes on to extend the comparison in terms of surface area, explaining that if the Cosmic Calendar is scaled to the size of a football field, then "all of human history would occupy an area the size of [his] hand".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pa1ImgOcOPM&amp;t=53m38s Episode 1: The Shores of the Cosmic Ocean (Cosmos: A Personal Voyage, Carl Sagan)]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cumulonimbus velum''' ('''Cb vel''') (from the [[Latin]] ''cumulonimbus'', "column-rain" + ''velum'', "veil") is a cumulonimbus cloud with a small layer of [[altostratus]] cloud wrapped around its mid area, representing an area of humid stable air created as a result of the growth of the parent cumulonimbus&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://glossary.ametsoc.org/wiki/Velum | title= Velum | publisher = [[American Meteorological Society]] | work= Meteorological glossary |accessdate = May 2, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;. The altostratus velum cloud appears dark in comparison to its parent cloud, and can persist even after the cumulonimbus has disintegrated. The velum is very rare, as conditions necessary in development are infrequent.

'''''Data Economy''''' is an international [[Technology journalism|technology]] [[business journalism|business]] news and opinion website, magazine and broadcaster founded in 2016&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.datacloudcongress.com/press-releases/broadgroup-launches-data-economy-first-truly-global-publication-dedicated-data|title=BroadGroup launches Data Economy, the first truly global publication dedicated to data centres and cloud|website=|access-date=2016-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The media outlet is headquartered in [[London]], [[UK]] and focuses on the business strategy and finance and investment within the [[IT infrastructure]] space, mainly [[data center|data centres]]. 

Broadmedia Communications, trading as BroadGroup and established in 2002, and a member company of [[FTSE 250 Index|FTSE 250 firm]] [[Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC]] (LSE: ERM), is registered as Data Economy's publisher. The title is also a member of the [[Professional Publishers Association|Professional Publishers Association (PPA)]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ppa.co.uk/en/resources/members|title=Professional Publishers Association members list|website=|access-date=2018-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== History ==

The Data Economy news website was created in September 2016 following a business dinner in [[Monaco]] between publisher and Broadmedia Communications CEO Philip Low and journalist João Marques Lima&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pressreleases.responsesource.com/news/91204/broadgroup-names-jo-o-marques-lima-editor-of-datacentres-com/|title=BroadGroup names João Marques Lima editor of datacentres.com|website=|access-date=2016-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The publication acquired in November 2016, datacentres.com, created in 2005 and whose reporting focused on the development of data centres and cloud infrastructure across the globe. Before the end of the year, Data Economy also launched the Frontline video series, in which it interviews [[Executive officer|executive officers]], technology entrepreneurs and government figures.  

Data Economy became part of the Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC portfolio in March 2017, when the organisation acquired Broadmedia Communications&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://data-economy.com/euromoney-acquires-broadgroup/|title=Euromoney acquires BroadGroup|website=|access-date=2017-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The [[Daily Mail and General Trust]] (LSE: DMGT) is the majority shareholder of Euromoney Institutional Investor PLC with 49% of the company's stake. 

The news source released in June 2017 its first print magazine, with production amounting to six editions yearly&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pressreleases.responsesource.com/newsroom/BroadGroup/release/93448/data-economy-launches-the-definitive-industry-leading-magazine/|title=Data Economy launches the definitive industry leading magazine|website=|access-date=2017-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Data Economy also runs a special supplement for specific market regions on a monthly basis&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://data-economy.com/data-tiger-finding-the-new-edge-of-ireland/|title=Data Economy introduces regional print specials|website=|access-date=2018-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In late 2017, Data Economy launched its Live series of events made of forums and summits targeted at industry executives, especially investors, operational companies, government and regional investment authorities and law firms. Data Economy is also the official global media partner of all Broadmedia Communications events including the Datacloud and Edge Congress series. 

In September 2018, the group revamped its slogan, changing from "Defining data centres and cloud 24/7" to "Invest Wisely", matching its finance and investment focused coverage of the IT infrastructure sector. 

== Readership and content ==
Data Economy is aimed at a worldwide elite of senior IT and operations professionals in the data centre, cloud and data spaces. The publication also targets executives in the finance and investment spectrum and legal ecosphere&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://data-economy.com/faq/|title=Data Economy readers profile|website=|access-date=2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  

The publication's content is showcased across its website for [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infotainment#Journalism|soft and hard news stories]] and opinion, its magazine for in depth interviews and analysis, and its broadcasting services through video interviews and live streaming from Data Economy, Datacloud and Edge Congress editions worldwide. 

===Magazine===
Data Economy launched its first print edition in Monaco 2017 during Datacloud Europe, attended by 1,800 delegates that year.
Data Economy produces six editions a year with unveilings at events in Europe, APAC, North America and Africa along with regional Data Economy Brief magazines. The magazines are also distributed globally and hosted online.  

The magazine is usually 92 pages long and features content with C-Level executive and analysis. Some of the personalities interviewed for the magazine include the [[List of Prime Ministers of Luxembourg|Prime Minister of Luxembourg]] [[Xavier Bettel]], [[Lenovo|Lenovo's]] chairman and CEO [[Yang Yuanqing]], and [[NetApp|NetApp's]] George Kurian.

The magazine is laid out into the following sections: Global Leadership Talks, Finance and Investment Watch, Technology Business Talks and a People &amp; Lifestyle Watch. Each issue also contains a special focus such as the Data Economy EMEA 50 or APAC 50, which lists the industry’s top minds in data centre, cloud and edge in the given region.

=== Biannual Lists ===

In 2017, Data Economy launched the "EMEA 50", a regional ranking of the data centre and cloud sector's top 50 influencers. The list is composed biannually and realised in the publication's June magazine, during the Datacloud Global Congress in Monaco. In the first edition, English industry entrepreneur, businessman, author and philanthropist [[Michael Tobin (entrepreneur)|Michael Tobin OBE]] ranked as EMEA's most influential leader&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://data-economy.com/data-economy-emea-50-the-top-influencers-in-data-centres-cloud-and-data-in-2017/|title=Data Economy EMEA 50: The top influencers in data centres, cloud and data in 2017|website=|access-date=2017-06-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;.   

Following the launch of the "EMEA 50", Data Economy also initiated other rankings including ‘The 30 Under 30’, showcasing the young people who are leading the data centre, cloud and data industries&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://data-economy.com/30-30-young-disruptors-data-centres-cloud-data/|title=The 30 under 30: The young disruptors in data centres, cloud and data|website=|access-date=2017-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the world’s top 25 finance and investment movers and shakers in data centres and cloud&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://data-economy.com/fif25-the-worlds-top-25-finance-investment-movers-and-shakers-in-data-centres-and-cloud/|title=FIF25.

===Frontline===

Launched at the same time as when the publication was founded, Data Economy Frontline is a series of interviews in which industry leaders are questioned about their business and market trends. 

== Data Economy Live ==

In November 2017, the first Data Economy Live event was held in London, focusing on [[edge computing]]. Other events include the Data Economy Summit due for April 2019, focusing on the global investment, finance and M&amp;A activity across the global IT infrastructure space. The event, a spin-off of Broadmedia Communications' 11-year running Finance and Investment Forum, gathers the strategic and financial leadership, private equity specialists, financiers, industry investors, REITs, professional transactional and advisory firms, and government.

All people need to [[decision-making|make decisions]] from time to time. Given limited time in formulating policies and addressing public problems, public administrators must enjoy a certain degree of discretion in planning, revising and implementing public policies. In other words, they must engage in [[decision-making]] (Gianakis, 2004). Over the years, many scholars tried to devise '''decision-making models''' to account for the policy making process.

== Rationality ==

Since the development of [[public administration]], scholars have assumed that people make decisions rationally. By [[rationality]], [[]] (1976) means ”a style of behaviour that is appropriate to the achievement of given goals, within the limits imposed by given conditions and constraints” (P. 405).
[[Max Weber]], in the early part of the 20th century, suggested distinguishing two types of economic rationality:  formal rationality and substantive rationality.  The "formal rationality of economic action" referred to "the extent of quantitative calculation or accounting which is technically possible and . . . actually applied." "Substantive rationality" referred to the degree to which economic action serves "ultimate values no matter what they may be." (Weber, The Theory of Social and Economic Organization, Parsons, ed., 1947, pp. 184-186) Weber noted that "the requirements of formal and of substantive rationality are always in principle in conflict."  (Ibid., p. 212) Decades later, Simon used a similar terminology to distinct two meanings of "rationality", which have developed separately in economic and psychology. He defined substantive rationality, stemming from the concept of rationality within [[economics]], as behavior that "is appropriate to the achievement of given goals within the limits imposed by given conditions and constraints". Procedural rationality, based in [[psychology]], refers to behavior that "is the outcome of appropriate deliberation". &lt;ref&gt;Simon, H. A. (1976). From Substantive to Procedural Rationality. In S. J. Latsis (Ed.), ''Method and Appraisal in Economics''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press: pp. 130-131&lt;/ref&gt;

== Facts ==

According to Gortner (2001), facts are the information and knowledge that the public administrators possess in formulating policies. Facts are important in deciding the appropriate means to take to achieve higher ends. They may not be readily known by administrators but need to be acquired through extensive research and analysis.
Rationality is defined in terms of appropriateness for the accomplishment of specific goals.

== Values ==

Values are internal [[perceptions]] on the desirability and priority of one’s actions and choices. (Van Wart, 2004) Besides setting goals for their plans, decision-makers make priorities, interpret facts and act upon objective situations according to their values. Besides balancing conflicting values within an individual, government has to weigh and balance values embodied in different departments (Van Wart, 1996, 1998).

== Means ==

Means are the instruments to satisfy a higher end (Simon, 1997). Although they are used to achieve a higher end, they are not neutral in [[Value theory|value]]. When policy makers devise their strategies, they choose their means according to their internal values and consequences...

== Ends ==

Ends are the intermediate goals to a more final objective. In a [[means-end hierarchy]], the concept of means and ends is relative.&lt;ref&gt;Simon, H. A. (1964). On the Concept of Organizational Goal. ''Administrative Science Quarterly'', 9(1), 1-22. &lt;/ref&gt; An action can be a mean relative to the higher levels in the hierarchy but an end relative to the lower levels. However, in this hierarchy, an action is more value-based when moving upwards in the hierarchy but more fact-based when moving downwards.

== Types ==

There are several models of decision-making:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zeepedia.com/read.php?decision_making_history_personal_rationality_social_model_conceptual_organizational_psychology&amp;b=93&amp;c=29 zeepedia.com]&lt;/ref&gt; 
===Economic rationality model===
This model comes from the classical economist models, in which the decision-maker is perfectly and completely rational in every way. In this, following conditions are assumed.&lt;br /&gt;
# The decision will be completely rational in means ends sense.
# There is a complete and consistent system of preferences that allows a choice among  alternatives.
# There is a complete awareness of all the possible alternatives
# Probability calculations are neither frightening nor mysterious
# There are no limits to the complexity of computations that can be performed to determine the best alternatives

===Social model===
At the opposite extreme from the economic rationality model is the social model drawn from psychology. Sigmund Freud viewed humans as bundles of feelings, emotions and instincts, with their behavior guided by their unconscious desires. These processes have even an impact in the international arena as they provide some basic rules of protocol.


===Simon’s bounded rationality model===
To present a more realistic alternative to the economic rationality model, [[Herbert A. Simon|Herbert Simon]] proposed an alternative model. He felt that management decision-making behaviour could be described as follows:
# In choosing between alternatives, manager attempt to satisfy or looks for the one which is satisfactory or “good enough”. Examples of satisfying criteria would be adequate profit or share or the market and fair price.
# They recognize that the world they perceive is drastically simplified model of the real world. They are content with the simplification because they believe the real world is mostly empty anyway.
# Because they satisfy rather than maximise, they can make their choices without first determining all possible behaviour alternatives and without ascertaining that these are all the alternatives.
# The managers treat the world as empty, they are able to make decision with simple rule of thumb. These techniques do not make impossible demands upon their capacity for thought.

===Neuroscientific (neurocognitive) model===
In [[cognitive neuroscience]] decision-making  refers  to  the  cognitive  process of evaluating a number of possibilities, and selecting  the  most  appropriate  thereof  in order to further a specific goal, or task. This faculty is a fundamental component of executive functions, although recent studies show that a complex brain network is involved including motor areas.&lt;ref&gt;O’Sullivan, Owen (2014). [http://www.crossingdialogues.com/Ms-A14-05.pdf Losing control: the hidden role of motor areas in decision-making.] ''Dialogues in Philosophy, Mental and Neuro Sciences'', '''7'''(2):45–49.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Neuropsychology}}
In [[neuropsychology]], '''dissociation''' involves identifying the [[neural substrate]] of a particular brain function through identification of case studies, [[neuroimaging]], or neuropsychological testing.

==Dissociation types==

===Single dissociation===
When dissecting complex mental tasks into their subcomponents, a researcher can establish a "single dissociation" between functions. This is done by demonstrating that a lesion to brain structure A disrupts function X but not function Y. Such a demonstration allows one to infer that function X and function Y are independent of each other in some way.

Dr. [[Oliver Sacks]] has described many famous cases of dissociation in his books. An example of "single dissociation" is a patient who cannot name an object when he or she can only see it, but can when he or she uses other senses like touching or smelling. Patient D.F. was unable to place a card in a slot, but could do so when told to place it "as if mailing a letter". From this the conclusion was drawn that judging orientation is one ability (which D.F. had lost) and visual control of an action another (which D.F. could still do).&lt;ref name=Goldstein&gt;E. Bruce Goldstein: Sensation and Perception. Wadsworth, Pacific Grove (USA), 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Double dissociation===
To strengthen a single dissociation, a researcher can establish a "double dissociation", a term that was introduced by [[Hans-Lukas Teuber]] in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-10954167_ITM What do double dissociations prove? | Cognitive Science (January, 2001)&lt;!--Bot generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; This is the demonstration that two experimental manipulations each have different effects on two dependent variables; if one manipulation affects the first variable and not the second, the other manipulation affects the second variable and not the first.&lt;ref&gt;Huettel, Scott A.; Song, Allen W.; McCarthy, Gregory: "Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging" p. 439. Sinauer Associates, Inc., 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; If one can demonstrate that a lesion in brain structure A impairs function X but not Y, and further demonstrate that a lesion to brain structure B impairs function Y but spares function X, one can make more specific inferences about brain function and function localization.

In [[cognitive neuroscience]], double dissociation is an experimental technique by which two areas of neocortex are functionally dissociated by two behavioral tests, each test being affected by a lesion in one zone and not the other.&lt;ref&gt;Kolb &amp; Whishaw: ''Fundamentals of Human Neuropsychology,'' 2003&lt;/ref&gt; In a series of patients with [[traumatic brain injury]], one might find two patients, A and B. Patient A has difficulty performing cognitive tests for, say auditory memory but has no problem with visual memory. Patient B has the opposite problem. By using [[neuroimaging]] (or [[neuropathology]] post-mortem) to identify the overlap and dissociation between lesioned areas of the brain, one can infer something about the localization of visual and auditory function in the normal brain.

Establishing a single dissociation between two functions provides limited and potentially misleading information, whereas a double dissociation can conclusively demonstrate that the two functions are localized in different areas of the brain.

To make the difference between single and double dissociations easier to understand, Parkin&lt;ref name=Parkin&gt;A.J. Parkin: Explorations in Cognitive Neuropsychology. Blackwell, Oxford, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; gives the following example:
&lt;blockquote&gt;If your TV set suddenly loses the color you can conclude that picture transmission and color information must be separate processes (single dissociation: they cannot be independent because you cannot lose the picture and still have the color). If on the other hand you have two TV sets, one without sound and one without a picture you can conclude that these must be two independent functions (double dissociation).&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Examples of double dissociations ===
[[Paul Broca]] and [[Carl Wernicke]] were two physicians of the 1800s whose patients were evidence of the double dissociation between generating language (speech) and understanding language. Broca's patients could no longer speak but could understand language ([[non-fluent aphasia]]) while Wernicke's patients could no longer understand language but could produce jumbled speech ([[fluent aphasia]]). Post-mortems revealed lesions in separate areas of the brain in each case (now referred to as [[Broca's area]] and [[Wernicke's area]] respectively). Although the neurophysiology of language is now known to be more complicated than described by Broca or Wernicke, this classic double dissociation acted to begin modern neuropsychological investigation of language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = First-Pass versus Second-Pass Parsing Processes in a Wernicke's and a Broca's Aphasic: Electrophysiological Evidence for a Double Dissociation|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0093934X97919064|journal = Brain and Language|date = 1998-05-01|pages = 311–341|volume = 62|issue = 3|doi = 10.1006/brln.1997.1906|first = Angela D.|last = Friederici|first2 = Anja|last2 = Hahne|first3 = D. Yves|last3 = von Cramon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The conditions [[Capgras delusion]] and [[prosopagnosia]] have also been argued to represent a double dissociation. In the former, a patient is able to recognise a person but does not get the feeling of knowing them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Capgras delusion: a window on face recognition|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S136466130001620X|journal = Trends in Cognitive Sciences|date = 2001-04-01|pages = 149–156|volume = 5|issue = 4|doi = 10.1016/S1364-6613(00)01620-X|first = Hadyn D.|last = Ellis|first2 = Michael B.|last2 = Lewis}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the latter, a patient is unable to recognise a familiar person but sometimes has a feeling of knowing.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2044">'''Electrocapillarity''' or '''electrocapillary phenomena''' are the phenomena related to changes in the [[surface energy]] (or [[interfacial tension]]) of the [[dropping mercury electrode]] (DME) as the [[electrode potential]] changes or the [[electrolyte|electrolytic solution]] composition and concentration change. The term "electro-capillary" is used to describe the change in [[mercury (element)|mercury]] (Hg) [[electrode]] potential as a function of the change in the surface or interfacial tension of the Hg determined by the [[capillary action|capillary rise]]  method. The phenomena are the historic main contributions for understanding and validating the models of the structure of the electrical double layer. The phenomena are related to the electrokinetic phenomena and consequently to the [[colloid]] chemistry.

==Interfacial tension==
&lt;!-- Outdated units, see talk page --&gt;
The interfacial (surface) tension, St, (dyne cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;), can be calculated by applying the equation of capillary rise method (when the contact angle Ө → 0):&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;math&gt;St = \frac{h \cdot r \cdot g \cdot d}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

where:
* h (cm) is the height of Hg column above the Hg [[Meniscus (liquid)|meniscus]] in the capillary
* r (cm) is the [[radius]] of capillary
* g is the [[acceleration]] due to [[Standard gravity|gravity]]
* d (g cm&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;) is the Hg [[density]]

The circuit contains Hg electrode as the [[ideally polarizable electrode]] and a [[reference electrode]] as the non-polarizable electrode. Thus, when an external voltage is applied, only EM/S of Hg/solution interface is changed.

'''Electrophoretic light scattering''' (also known as '''laser Doppler electrophoresis''' or '''phase analysis light scattering''' ) is based on [[dynamic light scattering]]. The [[frequency]] shift or [[phase (waves)|phase]] shift of an incident [[laser]] beam depends on the [[dispersed particles]] mobility. In the case of ''dynamic light scattering'', Brownian motion causes particle motion. In the case of ''electrophoretic light scattering'', [[oscillating]] [[electric field]] performs the same function.

This method is used for measuring [[electrophoretic mobility]] and then calculating [[zeta potential]]. Instruments to apply the method are commercially available from several manufacturers. The last set of calculations requires information on [[viscosity]] and [[dielectric permittivity]] of the [[dispersion medium]]. Appropriate [[electrophoresis]] theory is also required. Sample dilution is often necessary in order to eliminate multiple scattering of the incident laser beam and/or particle interactions.

==Instrumentation of Electrophoretic light scattering==
[[Image:Optics 0002.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Fig.3. Commercial heterodyne optical system of an electrophoretic light scattering instrument with a modulator (from Ref. 11).]]

A laser beam passes through the electrophoresis cell, irradiates the particles dispersed in it, and is scattered by the particles. The scattered light is detected by a photo-multiplier after passing through two pinholes. There are two types of optical systems: heterodyne and fringe.
Ware and Flygare &lt;ref&gt;R. Ware and W.H. Flygare, J.Colloid Interface Sci. 39: 670 (1972).&lt;/ref&gt; developed a heterodyne-type ELS instrument, that was the first instrument of this type. In a fringe optics ELS instrument,&lt;ref&gt;J. Josefwiicz and F.R. Hallett, Appl. Opt. 14: 740 ( (1975).&lt;/ref&gt; a laser beam is divided into two beams. Those cross inside the electrophresis cell at a fixed angle to produce a fringe pattern. The scattered light from the particles, which migrates inside the fringe, is intensity-modulated. The frequency shifts from both types of optics obey the same equations. The observed spectra resemble each other.
Oka et al. developed an ELS instrument of heterodyne-type optics&lt;ref&gt;K. Oka, W. Otani, K. Kameyama, M. Kidai, and T. Takagi, Appl. Theor. Electrophor. 1: 273-278 (1990).&lt;/ref&gt; that is now available commercially. Its optics is shown in Fig. 3.

If the frequencies of the intersecting laser beams are the same then it is not possible to resolve the direction of the motion of the migrating particles. Instead, only the magnitude of the velocity (i.e., the speed) can be determined. Hence, the sign of the zeta potential cannot be ascertained. This limitation can be overcome by shifting the frequency of one of the beams relative to the other. Such shifting may be referred to as frequency modulation or, more colloquially, just modulation. Modulators used in ELS may include piezo-actuated mirrors or acousto-optic modulators. This modulation scheme is employed by the heterodyne light scattering method, too.

==Heterodyne light scattering==
The frequency of light scattered by particles undergoing electrophoresis is shifted by the amount of the Doppler effect, &lt;math&gt;\upsilon_D\,&lt;/math&gt;  from that of the incident light, :&lt;math&gt;\upsilon\,&lt;/math&gt; .
The shift can be detected by means of heterodyne optics in which the scattering light is mixed with the reference light.
The autocorrelation function of intensity of the mixed light, &lt;math&gt;g(\tau) \,&lt;/math&gt;, can be approximately described by the following damped cosine function [7].

: &lt;math&gt;g(\tau)=A+B \exp(-\Gamma\tau)\cos(2\pi\upsilon_o)+C \exp(-2\Gamma \tau)\,\qquad (1)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\Gamma\,&lt;/math&gt;    is a decay constant and A, B, and C are positive constants dependent on the optical system.

Damping frequency &lt;math&gt;\upsilon_o\,&lt;/math&gt;  is an observed frequency, and is the frequency difference between scattered and reference light.

:    &lt;math&gt;\upsilon_o =| \upsilon_s - \upsilon_r   | = | (\upsilon_i+\upsilon_D)-(\upsilon_i+\upsilon_M ) |\qquad(2)&lt;/math&gt;

where  &lt;math&gt;\upsilon_s\,&lt;/math&gt;  is the frequency of scattered light, &lt;math&gt;\upsilon_r\,&lt;/math&gt;  the frequency of the reference light,
&lt;math&gt;\upsilon_i\,&lt;/math&gt;  the frequency of incident light (laser light),
and &lt;math&gt;\upsilon_M\,&lt;/math&gt;  the modulation frequency.

The power spectrum of mixed light, namely the Fourier transform of &lt;math&gt;g(\tau) \,&lt;/math&gt;, gives a couple of Lorenz functions at &lt;math&gt;\pm\Delta\upsilon \,&lt;/math&gt;  having a half-width of  &lt;math&gt;\Gamma/2\pi\,&lt;/math&gt; at the half maximum.

In addition to these two, the last term in equation (1) gives another Lorenz function at
&lt;math&gt;\upsilon = 0\,&lt;/math&gt;

The Doppler shift of frequency and the decay constant are dependent on the geometry of the optical system and are expressed respectively by the equations.

:    &lt;math&gt;\upsilon_D = \frac{Vq}{2\pi} \qquad(3)
&lt;/math&gt;
and

:&lt;math&gt;\Gamma = D|q|^2 \qquad(4)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\  V \,&lt;/math&gt;   is velocity of the particles,  &lt;math&gt;\ q \,&lt;/math&gt; is the amplitude of the scattering vector, and &lt;math&gt;\ D \,&lt;/math&gt; is the [[diffusion constant|translational diffusion constant]] of particles.

The amplitude of the scattering vector &lt;math&gt;\ q \,&lt;/math&gt;  is given by the equation

:     &lt;math&gt;\  |q|  = \frac{4 \pi n}{\lambda_0 }\sin\left( \frac{\theta}{2}\right) \qquad(5)&lt;/math&gt;

Since velocity &lt;math&gt;\  V \,&lt;/math&gt;      is proportional to the applied electric field, &lt;math&gt;\  E \,&lt;/math&gt;, the apparent electrophoretic mobility &lt;math&gt;\  \mu_{obs}  \,&lt;/math&gt;  is define by the equation

:     &lt;math&gt;\  \vec{V}  =  \mu_{obs} \vec{E}  \qquad(6)&lt;/math&gt;

Finally, the relation between the Doppler shift frequency and mobility is given for the case of the optical configuration of Fig. 3 by the equation

:    &lt;math&gt;\upsilon_D = \mu_{obs} \frac{n E}{\lambda_0} \sin \theta \qquad(7)&lt;/math&gt;

where  &lt;math&gt;\  E \,&lt;/math&gt;   is the strength of the electric field, &lt;math&gt;\ n\,&lt;/math&gt; the refractive index of the medium, &lt;math&gt;\ \lambda_0  \,&lt;/math&gt;, the wavelength of the incident light in vacuum, and &lt;math&gt;\  \theta \,&lt;/math&gt;    the scattering angle.
The sign of  &lt;math&gt;\  v_D  \,&lt;/math&gt; is a result of vector calculation and depends on the geometry of the optics.

The spectral frequency can be obtained according to Eq. (2).
When &lt;math&gt;\ | \upsilon_M | &gt; | \upsilon _D  | \,&lt;/math&gt;, Eq. (2) is modified and expressed as

:    &lt;math&gt;\upsilon_p = \upsilon_o = \pm( \upsilon _D -| \upsilon _M | ) \qquad(8)&lt;/math&gt;

The modulation frequency &lt;math&gt; \upsilon _M \,&lt;/math&gt;  can be obtained as the damping frequency without an electric field applied.

The particle diameter is obtained by assuming that the particle is spherical. This is called the hydrodynamic diameter,  &lt;math&gt;\  d_H\,&lt;/math&gt;   .

:    &lt;math&gt;\ d_H =  \frac{k_BT}{3 \pi  \eta D} \qquad(10)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\  k_B  \,&lt;/math&gt;   is [[Boltzmann constant|Boltzmann coefficient]], &lt;math&gt;\  T  \,&lt;/math&gt;  is the absolute temperature, and &lt;math&gt;\  \eta  \,&lt;/math&gt;  the [[dynamic viscosity]] of the surrounding fluid.

==Profile of Electro-Osmotic Flow==
Figure 4 shows two examples of heterodyne autocorrelation functions of scattered light from sodium polystyrene sulfate solution (NaPSS; MW 400,000; 4&amp;nbsp;mg/mL in 10 mM NaCl). The oscillating correlation function shown by Fig. 4a is a result of interference between the scattered light and the modulated reference light.
The beat of Fig. 4b includes additionally the contribution from the frequency changes of light scattered by PSS molecules under an electrical field of 40 V/cm.

Figure 5 shows heterodyne power spectra obtained by Fourier transform of the autocorrelation functions shown in Fig. 4.

Figure 6 shows plots of Doppler shift frequencies measured at various cell depth and electric field strengths, where a sample is the NaPSS solution.
These parabolic curves are called profiles of electro-osmotic flow and indicate that the velocity of the particles changed at different depth.
The surface potential of the cell wall produces electro-osmotic flow.
Since the electrophoresis chamber is a closed system, backward flow is produced at the center of the cell.
Then the observed mobility or velocity from Eq. (7) is a result of the combination of osmotic flow and electrophoretic movement.

Electrophoretic mobility analysis has been studied by Mori and Okamoto [16], who have taken into account the effect of electro-osmotic flow at the side wall.

The profile of velocity or mobility at the center of the cell is given approximately by Eq. (11) for the case where k&gt;5.
:    &lt;math&gt;\ U_a (z) = AU_0(z/b)^2 + \Delta U_0(z/b)+(1-A) U_0 + U_p \qquad(11)&lt;/math&gt;
where
: &lt;math&gt;\ z  = \,&lt;/math&gt;  cell depth
: &lt;math&gt;\ U_a (z) = \,&lt;/math&gt;  apparent electrophoretic velocity of particle at position z.

: &lt;math&gt;\ U_p = \,&lt;/math&gt;  true electrophoretic velocity of the particles.

: &lt;math&gt;\ z/b = \,&lt;/math&gt; thickness of the cell

:   &lt;Math&gt;\ U_0 = \,&lt;/math&gt; average velocity of osmotic flow at upper and lower cell wall.

:  &lt;Math&gt;\Delta U_0 = \,&lt;/math&gt; difference between velocities of osmotic flow at upper and lower cell wall.

:  &lt;Math&gt;\ A = \frac{1}{( 2/3) - (0.420166/k)} \qquad(12)&lt;/math&gt;
:  &lt;math&gt; \ k = a/b \,&lt;/math&gt; , a ratio between two side lengths of the rectangular cross section.

The parabolic curve of frequency shift caused by electro-osmotic flow shown in Fig. 6 fits with Eq. (11) with application of the least squares method.

Since the mobility is proportional to a frequency shift of the light scattered by a particle and the migrating velocity of a particle as indicated by Eq. (7), all the velocity, mobility, and frequency shifts are expressed by parabolic equations.
Then the true electrophoretic mobility of a particle, the electro-osmotic mobility at the upper and lower cell walls, ware obtained.
The frequency shift caused only by the electrophoresis of particles is equal to the apparent mobility at the stationary layer.

The velocity of the electrophoretic migration thus obtained is proportional to the electric field as shown in Fig. 7.
The frequency shift increases with increase of the scattering angle as shown in Fig. 8.
This result is in agreement with the theoretical Eq. (7).

==Applications==
Electrophoretic Light Scattering (ELS) is primarily used for characterizing the surface charges of [[colloidal particle]]s like [[macromolecules]] or synthetic polymers (ex. [[polystyrene]]&lt;ref&gt;Okubo, Tsuneo, and Mitsuhiro Suda. "Absorption of polyelectrolytes on colloidal surfaces as studied by electrophoretic and dynamic light-scattering techniques." Journal of colloid and interface science 213.2 (1999): 565-571.&lt;/ref&gt;) in liquid media in an electric field. In addition to information about surface charges, ELS can also measure the particle size of proteins &lt;ref&gt;Boeve, E. R., et al. "Zeta potential distribution on calcium oxalate crystal and Tamm-Horsfall protein surface analyzed with Doppler electrophoretic light scattering." The Journal of urology 152.2 Pt 1 (1994): 531-536.&lt;/ref&gt; and determine the [[zeta potential]] distribution.

===Biophysics===
ELS is useful for characterizing information about the surface of proteins. Ware and Flygare (1971) demonstrated that electrophoretic techniques can be combined with laser beat spectroscopy in order to simultaneously determine the electrophoretic mobility and diffusion coefficient of [[bovine serum albumin]].&lt;ref&gt;Ware BR, Flygare WH. The simultaneous measurement of the electrophoretic mobility and diffusion coefficient in bovine serum albumin solutions by light scattering. Chem Phys Lett. 1971;12(1):81.&lt;/ref&gt; The width of a [[Doppler effect|Doppler shifted]] spectrum of light that is scattered from a solution of macromolecules is proportional to the [[Mass diffusivity|diffusion coefficient]].&lt;ref&gt;H.Z. Cummins, N. Knable and Y. Yeh, Physical Review Letters. 12 (1964) 150.&lt;/ref&gt; The Doppler shift is proportional to the [[Electrophoresis|electrophoretic mobility]] of a macromolecule.&lt;ref&gt;W.H. Flygare, The effect of an electric field on the Rayleigh scattered light from a solution of macromolecules, Report No. III, ARPA Contract No. DAHC-15-67-C-0062 to the Materials Research Laboratory, University of Michigan.&lt;/ref&gt; From studies that have applied this method to [[polylysine|poly (L-lysine)]], ELS is believed to monitor fluctuation mobilities in the presence of solvents with varying salt concentrations.&lt;ref&gt;Wilcoxon, Jess P., and J. Michael Schurr. "Electrophoretic light scattering studies of poly (L‐lysine) in the ordinary and extraordinary phase. Effects of salt, molecular weight, and polyion concentration." The Journal of chemical physics 78.6 (1983): 3354-3364.&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been shown that electrophoretic mobility data can be converted to [[zeta potential]] values, which enables the determination of the [[isoelectric point]] of proteins and the number of [[Surface charge#Electrokinetic phenomena|electrokinetic]] charges on the surface.&lt;ref&gt;Jachimska B, Wasilewska M, Adamczyk Z. Characterization of globular protein solutions by dynamic light scattering, electrophoretic mobility, and viscosity measurements. Langmuir. 2008;24(13):6866–72.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other biological macromolecules that can be analyzed with ELS include [[polysaccharide]]s. pKa values of [[chitosan]]s can be calculated from the dependency of electrophoretic mobility values on pH and charge density.&lt;ref&gt;Strand, Sabina P., et al. "Electrophoretic light scattering studies of chitosans with different degrees of N-acetylation." Biomacromolecules 2.4 (2001): 1310-1314.&lt;/ref&gt; Like proteins, the size and zeta potential of chitosans can be determined through ELS.&lt;ref&gt;Jiang, Hu-Lin, et al. "Chitosan-graft-polyethylenimine as a gene carrier." Journal of Controlled Release 117.2 (2007): 273-280.&lt;/ref&gt;

ELS has also been applied to [[nucleic acid]]s and viruses. The technique can be extended to measure electrophoretic mobilities of large bacteria molecules at low ionic strengths.&lt;ref&gt;Hartford, S. L., and W. H. Flygare. "Electrophoretic light scattering on calf thymus deoxyribonucleic acid and tobacco mosaic virus." Macromolecules 8.1 (1975): 80-83.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nanoparticles===
ELS has been used to characterize the [[Dispersity|polydispersity]], nanodispersity, and stability of [[Carbon nanotube#Single-walled|single-walled carbon nanotubes]] in an aqueous environment with surfactants.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Ji Yeong, et al. "Electrophoretic and dynamic light scattering in evaluating dispersion and size distribution of single-walled carbon nanotubes." Journal of nanoscience and nanotechnology 5.7 (2005): 1045-1049.&lt;/ref&gt; The technique can be used in combination with [[dynamic light scattering]] to measure these properties of nanotubes in many different solvents.

[[File:Mirror baby.jpg|thumb|right|160px|Even very young children perform rudimentary experiments to learn about the world and how things work.]]
An '''experiment''' is a procedure carried out to support, refute, or validate a [[hypothesis]]. Experiments provide insight into [[Causality|cause-and-effect]] by demonstrating what outcome occurs when a particular factor is manipulated. Experiments vary greatly in goal and scale, but always rely on repeatable procedure and logical analysis of the results. There also exists [[natural experiment| natural experimental studies]].

A child may carry out basic experiments to understand gravity, while teams of scientists may take years of systematic investigation to advance their understanding of a phenomenon. Experiments and other types of hands-on activities are very important to student learning in the science classroom. Experiments can raise test scores and help a student become more engaged and interested in the material they are learning, especially when used over time.&lt;ref name=Stohr-Hunt&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stohr-Hunt|first1=Patricia|title=An Analysis of Frequency of Hands-on Experience and Science Achievement|journal=Journal of Research in Science Teaching|date=1996|volume=33|doi=10.1002/(SICI)1098-2736(199601)33:1&lt;101::AID-TEA6&gt;3.0.CO;2-Z}}&lt;/ref&gt; Experiments can vary from personal and informal natural comparisons (e.g. tasting a range of chocolates to find a favorite), to highly controlled (e.g. tests requiring complex apparatus overseen by many scientists that hope to discover information about subatomic particles). Uses of experiments vary considerably between the [[Natural science|natural]] and [[Social science|human]] sciences.

Experiments typically include [[scientific control|controls]], which are designed to minimize the effects of variables other than the single [[independent variable]]. This increases the reliability of the results, often through a comparison between control [[measurement]]s and the other measurements. Scientific controls are a part of the [[scientific method]]. Ideally, all variables in an experiment are controlled (accounted for by the control measurements) and none are uncontrolled. In such an experiment, if all controls work as expected, it is possible to conclude that the experiment works as intended, and that results are due to the effect of the tested variable.

==Overview==
In the [[scientific method]], an experiment is an [[Empirical research|empirical]] procedure that arbitrates competing [[scientific models|models]] or [[hypotheses]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cooperstock|first1=Fred I.|title=General relativistic dynamics : extending Einstein's legacy throughout the universe|date=2009|publisher=World Scientific|location=Singapore|isbn=978-981-4271-16-5|page=12|edition= Online-Ausg.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Griffith&gt;{{cite book|last1=Griffith|first1=W. Thomas|title=The physics of everyday phenomena : a conceptual introduction to physics|date=2001|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=Boston|isbn=0-07-232837-1|pages=3–4|edition= 3rd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers also use experimentation to test existing [[Scientific theory|theories]] or new hypotheses to support or disprove them.&lt;ref name=Griffith/&gt;&lt;ref name=Wilczek&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wilczek|first1=Frank|last2=Devine|first2=Betsy|title=Fantastic realities : 49 mind journeys and a trip to Stockholm|date=2006|publisher=World Scientific|location=New Jersey|isbn=978-981-256-649-2|pages=61–62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An experiment usually tests a [[hypothesis]], which is an expectation about how a particular process or phenomenon works. However, an experiment may also aim to answer a "what-if" question, without a specific expectation about what the experiment reveals, or to confirm prior results. If an experiment is carefully conducted, the results usually either support or disprove the hypothesis. According to some [[philosophy of science|philosophies of science]], an experiment can never "prove" a hypothesis, it can only add support. On the other hand, an experiment that provides a [[counterexample]] can disprove a theory or hypothesis, but a theory can always be salvaged by appropriate [[ad hoc]] modifications at the expense of simplicity.  An experiment must also control the possible [[confounding|confounding factors]]—any factors that would mar the accuracy or repeatability of the experiment or the ability to interpret the results. Confounding is commonly eliminated through [[scientific control]]s and/or, in [[randomized experiment]]s, through [[random assignment]].

In [[engineering]] and the physical sciences, experiments are a primary component of the scientific method. They are used to test theories and hypotheses about how physical processes work under particular conditions (e.g., whether a particular engineering process can produce a desired chemical compound). Typically, experiments in these fields focus on [[Replication (statistics)|replication]] of identical procedures in hopes of producing identical results in each replication. Random assignment is uncommon.

In medicine and the [[social sciences]], the prevalence of experimental research varies widely across disciplines. When used, however, experiments typically follow the form of the [[clinical trial]], where experimental units (usually individual human beings) are randomly assigned to a treatment or control condition where one or more outcomes are assessed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Holland|first1=Paul W.|title=Statistics and Causal Inference|journal=Journal of the American Statistical Association|date=December 1986|volume=81|issue=396|pages=945|doi=10.2307/2289064|jstor=2289064}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to norms in the physical sciences, the focus is typically on the [[average treatment effect]] (the difference in outcomes between the treatment and control groups) or another [[test statistic]] produced by the experiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Druckman|editor-first1=James N.|editor-last2=Greene|editor-first2=Donald P.|editor-last3=Kuklinski|editor-first3=James H.|editor-last4=Lupia|editor-first4=Arthur|title=Cambridge handbook of experimental political science|date=2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=9780521174558}}&lt;/ref&gt; A single study typically does not involve replications of the experiment, but separate studies may be aggregated through [[systematic review]] and [[meta-analysis]].

There are various differences in  experimental practice in each of the [[branches of science]]. For example, [[agriculture|agricultural]] research frequently uses randomized experiments (e.g., to test the comparative effectiveness of different fertilizers), while [[experimental economics]] often involves experimental tests of theorized human behaviors without relying on random assignment of individuals to treatment and control conditions.

==History==
{{main|History of experiments}}

One of the first methodical approaches to experiments in the modern sense is visible in the works of the Arab mathematician and scholar [[Ibn al-Haytham]]. He conducted his experiments in the field of optics - going back to optical and mathematical problems in the works of [[Ptolemy]] - by controlling his experiments due to factors such as self-criticality, reliance on visible results of the experiments as well as a criticality in terms of earlier results. He counts as one of the first scientists/ philosophers using an inductive-experimental method for achieving results.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2018-03-10|title=History of scientific method|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=History_of_scientific_method&amp;oldid=829729095|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=El-Bizri|first=Nader|date=2005|title=A Philosophical Perspective on Alhazen’s Optics|url=|journal=Arabic Sciences and Philosophy (Cambridge University Press)|volume= 15| issue = 2|pages= 189–218|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book "Optics" he describes the fundamentally new approach to knowledge and research in an experimental sense:

''“We should, that is, recommence the inquiry into its principles and premisses, beginning our investigation with an inspection of the things that exist and a survey of the conditions of visible objects. We should distinguish the properties of particulars, and gather by induction what pertains to the eye when vision takes place and what is found in the manner of sensation to be uniform, unchanging, manifest and not subject to doubt. After which we should ascend in our inquiry and reasonings, gradually and orderly, criticizing premisses and exercising caution in regard to conclusions – our aim in all that we make subject to inspection and review being to employ justice, not to follow prejudice, and to take care in all that we judge and criticize that we seek the truth and not to be swayed by opinion. We may in this way eventually come to the truth that gratifies the heart and gradually and carefully reach the end at which certainty appears; while through criticism and caution we may seize the truth that dispels disagreement and resolves doubtful matters. For all that, we are not free from that human turbidity which is in the nature of man; but we must do our best with what we possess of human power. From God we derive support in all things.“''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Optics|last=Ibn al-Haytham|first=Abu Ali Al-Hasan|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to his explanation, a strictly controlled test execution with a sensibility for the subjectivity and susceptibility of outcomes due to the nature of man is necessary. Furthermore, a critical view on the results and outcomes of earlier scholars is necessary:

''“It is thus the duty of the man who studies the writings of scientists, if learning the truth is his goal, to make himself an enemy of all that he reads, and, applying his mind to the core and margins of its content, attack it from every side. He should also suspect himself as he performs his critical examination of it, so that he may avoid falling into either prejudice or leniency.”''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dubitationes in Ptolemaeum|last=Ibn al-Haytham|first=Abi Ali Al-Hasan|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, a comparison of earlier results with the experimental results is necessary for an objective experiment - the visible results being more important. In the end, this may mean that an experimental researcher must find enough courage to discard traditional opinions or results, especially if these results are not experimental but results from a logical/ mental derivation. In this process of critical consideration, the man himself should not forget that he tends to subjective opinions - through "prejudices" and "leniency" - and thus has to be critical about his own way of building hypotheses.

[[Francis Bacon]] (1561–1626), an English [[philosophy|philosopher]] and [[scientist]] active in the 17th century, became an influential supporter of experimental science in the [[English Renaissance|English renaissance]]. He disagreed with the method of answering scientific questions by [[deductive reasoning|deduction]] - similar to [[Ibn al-Haytham]] - and described it as follows: "Having first determined the question according to his will, man then resorts to experience, and bending her to conformity with his placets, leads her about like a captive in a procession."&lt;ref&gt;"Having first determined the question according to his will, man ''then'' resorts to experience, and bending her to conformity with his placets, leads her about like a captive in a procession." Bacon, Francis. ''Novum Organum'', i, 63. Quoted in {{harvnb|Durant|2012|p=170}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Bacon wanted a method that relied on repeatable observations, or experiments. Notably, he first ordered the scientific method as we understand it today. {{quotation | There remains simple experience; which, if taken as it comes, is called accident, if sought for, experiment. The true method of experience first lights the candle [hypothesis], and then by means of the candle shows the way [arranges and delimits the experiment]; commencing as it does with experience duly ordered and digested, not bungling or erratic, and from it deducing axioms [theories], and from established axioms again new experiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Durant|first1=Will|title=The story of philosophy : the lives and opinions of the great philosophers of the western world|date=2012|publisher=Simon and Schuster|location=New York|isbn=978-0-671-69500-2|edition= 2nd|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|101}}}}

In the centuries that followed, people who applied the scientific method in different areas made important advances and discoveries.  For example, [[Galileo Galilei]] (1564-1642) accurately measured time and experimented to make accurate measurements and conclusions about the speed of a falling body. [[Antoine Lavoisier]] (1743-1794), a French chemist, used experiment to describe new areas, such as [[combustion]] and [[biochemistry]] and to develop the theory of [[conservation of mass]] (matter).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bell|first1=Madison Smartt|title=Lavoisier in the Year One: The Birth of a New Science in an Age of Revolution|date=2005|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company|isbn= 9780393051551}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Louis Pasteur]] (1822-1895) used the scientific method to disprove the prevailing theory of [[spontaneous generation]] and to develop the [[germ theory of disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Brock|editor-first1=Thomas D|title=Pasteur and Modern Science|date=1988|publisher=Springer|isbn=9783540501015|edition= New illustrated}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of the importance of controlling potentially confounding variables, the use of well-designed [[laboratory]] experiments is preferred when possible.

A considerable amount of progress on the design and analysis of experiments occurred in the early 20th century, with contributions from statisticians such as [[Ronald Fisher]] (1890-1962), [[Jerzy Neyman]] (1894-1981), [[Oscar Kempthorne]] (1919-2000), [[Gertrude Mary Cox]] (1900-1978), and [[William Gemmell Cochran]] (1909-1980), among others.

==Types of experiment==
Experiments might be categorized according to a number of dimensions, depending upon professional norms and standards in different fields of study. In some disciplines (e.g., [[psychology]] or [[political science]]), a 'true experiment' is a method of social research in which there are two kinds of [[Variable (mathematics)|variables]]. The [[independent variable]] is manipulated by the experimenter, and the [[dependent variable]] is measured. The signifying characteristic of a true experiment is that it [[Randomized experiment|randomly allocates]] the subjects to neutralize experimenter bias, and ensures, over a large number of iterations of the experiment, that it controls for all [[Confounding|confounding factors]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Types of experiments|url=http://psychology.ucdavis.edu/SommerB/sommerdemo/experiment/types.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141219220204/http://psychology.ucdavis.edu/faculty_sites/sommerb/sommerdemo/experiment/types.htm|archive-date=19 December 2014|publisher=Department of Psychology, University of California Davis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controlled experiments===
{{Main|Scientific control|Design of experiments}}
A controlled experiment often compares the results obtained from experimental samples against  ''control'' samples, which are practically identical to the experimental sample except for the one aspect whose effect is being tested (the [[dependent and independent variables|independent variable]]). A good example would be a drug trial. The sample or group receiving the drug would be the experimental group ([[treatment group]]); and the one receiving the [[placebo]] or regular treatment would be the [[control group|control]] one. In many laboratory experiments it is good practice to have several [[Replicate (statistics)|replicate]] samples for the test being performed and have both a [[Scientific control#Positive|positive control]] and a [[Scientific control#Negative|negative control]]. The results from replicate samples can often be averaged, or if one of the replicates is obviously inconsistent with the results from the other samples, it can be discarded as being the result of an experimental error (some step of the test procedure may have been mistakenly omitted for that sample). Most often, tests are done in duplicate or triplicate. A positive control is a procedure similar to the actual experimental test but is known from previous experience to give a positive result. A negative control is known to give a negative result. The positive control confirms that the basic conditions of the experiment were able to produce a positive result, even if none of the actual experimental samples produce a positive result. The negative control demonstrates the base-line result obtained when a test does not produce a measurable positive result. Most often the value of the negative control is treated as a "background" value to subtract from the test sample results. Sometimes the positive control takes the quadrant of a [[standard curve]].

An example that is often used in teaching laboratories is a controlled [[protein]] [[assay]]. Students might be given a fluid sample containing an unknown (to the student) amount of protein. It is their job to correctly perform a controlled experiment in which they determine the concentration of protein in the fluid sample (usually called the "unknown sample"). The teaching lab would be equipped with a protein standard solution with a known protein concentration. Students could make several positive control samples containing various dilutions of the protein standard. Negative control samples would contain all of the reagents for the protein assay but no protein. In this example, all samples are performed in duplicate. The assay is a [[Colorimetry (chemical method)#Colorimetric Assays|colorimetric assay]] in which a [[spectrophotometer]] can measure the amount of protein in samples by detecting a colored complex formed by the interaction of protein molecules and molecules of an added dye. In the illustration, the results for the diluted test samples can be compared to the results of the standard curve (the blue line in the illustration) to estimate the amount of protein in the unknown sample.

Controlled experiments can be performed when it is difficult to exactly control all the conditions in an experiment. In this case, the experiment begins by creating two or more sample groups that are ''probabilistically equivalent,'' which means that measurements of traits should be similar among the groups and that the groups should respond in the same manner if given the same treatment. This equivalency is determined by [[statistics|statistical]] methods that take into account the amount of variation between individuals and the [[number]] of individuals in each group. In fields such as [[microbiology]] and [[chemistry]], where there is very little variation between individuals and the group size is easily in the millions, these statistical methods are often bypassed and simply splitting a [[solution]] into equal parts is assumed to produce identical sample groups.

Once equivalent groups have been formed, the experimenter tries to treat them identically except for the one ''variable'' that he or she wishes to isolate. [[Human experimentation]] requires special safeguards against outside variables such as the ''[[Placebo#Mechanism of the effect|placebo effect]]''. Such experiments are generally ''[[Blind experiment|double blind]]'', meaning that neither the volunteer nor the researcher knows which individuals are in the control group or the experimental group until after all of the data have been collected. This ensures that any effects on the volunteer are due to the treatment itself and are not a response to the knowledge that he is being treated.

In human experiments, researchers may give a [[research subject|subject]] (person) a [[stimulation|stimulus]] that the subject responds to. The goal of the experiment is to [[Measurement|measure]] the response to the stimulus by a [[test method]].

[[Image:Snow-cholera-map-1.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Original map by [[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]] showing the [[Cluster (epidemiology)|clusters]] of cholera cases in the London epidemic of 1854]]

In the [[design of experiments]], two or more "treatments" are applied to estimate the  [[Average treatment effect|difference]] between the mean [[response variable|responses]] for the treatments. For example, an experiment on baking bread could estimate the difference in the responses associated with quantitative variables, such as the ratio of water to flour, and with qualitative variables, such as strains of yeast. Experimentation is the step in the [[scientific method]] that helps people decide between two or more competing explanations – or [[hypotheses]]. These hypotheses suggest reasons to explain a phenomenon, or predict the results of an action. An example might be the hypothesis that "if I release this ball, it will fall to the floor": this suggestion can then be tested by carrying out the experiment of letting go of the ball, and observing the results.  Formally, a hypothesis is compared against its opposite or [[null hypothesis]] ("if I release this ball, it will not fall to the floor"). The null hypothesis is that there is no explanation or predictive power of the phenomenon through the reasoning that is being investigated.  Once hypotheses are defined, an experiment can be carried out and the results analysed to confirm, refute, or define the accuracy of the hypotheses.

=== Natural experiments ===
{{main|Natural experiment}}
The term "experiment" usually implies a controlled experiment, but sometimes controlled experiments are prohibitively difficult or impossible.  In this case researchers resort to ''natural experiments'' or ''[[quasi-experiments]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Dunning|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Natural experiments rely solely on observations of the variables of the [[system]] under study, rather than manipulation of just one or a few variables as occurs in controlled experiments.  To the degree possible, they attempt to collect data for the system in such a way that contribution from all variables can be determined, and where the effects of variation in certain variables remain approximately constant so that the effects of other variables can be discerned.  The degree to which this is possible depends on the observed [[correlation]] between [[explanatory variables]] in the observed data.  When these variables are ''not'' well correlated, natural experiments can approach the power of controlled experiments.  Usually, however, there is some correlation between these variables, which reduces the reliability of natural experiments relative to what could be concluded if a controlled experiment were performed.  Also, because natural experiments usually take place in uncontrolled environments, variables from undetected sources are neither measured nor held constant, and these may produce illusory correlations in variables under study.

Much research in several [[science]] disciplines, including [[economics]], [[political science]], [[geology]], [[paleontology]], [[ecology]], [[meteorology]], and [[astronomy]], relies on quasi-experiments.  For example, in astronomy it is clearly impossible, when testing the hypothesis "Stars are collapsed clouds of hydrogen", to start out with a giant cloud of hydrogen, and then perform the experiment of waiting a few billion years for it to form a star. However, by observing various clouds of hydrogen in various states of collapse, and other implications of the hypothesis (for example, the presence of various spectral emissions from the light of stars), we can collect data we require to support the hypothesis.  An early example of this type of experiment was the first verification in the 17th century that light does not travel from place to place instantaneously, but instead has a measurable speed. Observation of the appearance of the moons of Jupiter were slightly delayed when Jupiter was farther from Earth, as opposed to when Jupiter was closer to Earth; and this phenomenon was used to demonstrate that the difference in the time of appearance of the moons was consistent with a measurable speed.

=== Field experiments ===
{{main|Field experiment}}
Field experiments are so named to distinguish them from [[laboratory]] experiments, which enforce scientific control by testing a hypothesis in the artificial and highly controlled setting of a laboratory. Often used in the social sciences, and especially in economic analyses of education and health interventions, field experiments have the advantage that outcomes are observed in a natural setting rather than in a contrived laboratory environment. For this reason, field experiments are sometimes seen as having higher [[external validity]] than laboratory experiments. However, like natural experiments, field experiments suffer from the possibility of contamination: experimental conditions can be controlled with more precision and certainty in the lab. Yet some phenomena (e.g., voter turnout in an election) cannot be easily studied in a laboratory.

==Contrast with observational study==
[[File:Blackbox3D-obs.png|thumb|252px|The [[black box|black box model]] for observation (input and output are ''observables''). When there are a [[feedback]] with some observer's control, as illustrated, the observation is also an experiment.]]

An [[observational study]] is used when it is impractical, unethical, cost-prohibitive (or otherwise inefficient) to fit a physical or social system into a laboratory setting, to completely control confounding factors, or to apply random assignment. It can also be used when confounding factors are either limited or known well enough to analyze the data in light of them (though this may be rare when social phenomena are under examination). For an observational science to be valid, the experimenter must know and account for [[confounding]] factors. In these situations, observational studies have value because they often suggest hypotheses that can be tested with randomized experiments or by collecting fresh data.

Fundamentally, however, observational studies are not experiments. By definition, observational studies lack the manipulation required for [[Baconian method|Baconian experiments]]. In addition, observational studies (e.g., in biological or social systems) often involve variables that are difficult to quantify or control. Observational studies are limited because they lack the statistical properties of randomized experiments. In a randomized experiment, the method of randomization specified in the experimental protocol guides the statistical analysis, which is usually specified also by the experimental protocol.&lt;ref name="Hinkelmann, Klaus and Kempthorne, Oscar 2008"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without a statistical model that reflects an objective randomization, the statistical analysis relies on a subjective model.&lt;ref name="Hinkelmann, Klaus and Kempthorne, Oscar 2008"/&gt; Inferences from subjective models are unreliable in theory and practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Freedman|first1=David|last2=Pisani|first2=Robert|last3=Purves|first3=Roger|author1-link=David A. Freedman|title=Statistics|date=2007|publisher=Norton|location=New York|isbn=978-0-393-92972-0|edition= 4th}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, there are several cases where carefully conducted observational studies consistently give wrong results, that is, where the results of the observational studies are inconsistent and also differ from the results of experiments. For example, epidemiological studies of colon cancer consistently show beneficial correlations with broccoli consumption, while experiments find no benefit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Freedman|first1=David A.|title=Statistical models : theory and practice|date=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-521-74385-3|edition= Revised}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A particular problem with observational studies involving human subjects is the great difficulty attaining fair comparisons between treatments (or exposures), because such studies are prone to [[selection bias]], and groups receiving different treatments (exposures) may differ greatly according to their covariates (age, height, weight, medications, exercise, nutritional status, ethnicity, family medical history, etc.). In contrast, randomization implies that for each covariate, the mean for each group is expected to be the same. For any randomized trial, some variation from the mean is expected, of course, but the randomization ensures that the experimental groups have mean values that are close, due to the [[central limit theorem]] and [[Markov's inequality]]. With inadequate randomization or low sample size, the systematic variation in covariates between the treatment groups (or exposure groups) makes it difficult to separate the effect of the treatment (exposure) from the effects of the other covariates, most of which have not been measured. The mathematical models used to analyze such data must consider each differing covariate (if measured), and results are not meaningful if a covariate is neither randomized nor included in the model.

To avoid conditions that render an experiment far less useful, physicians conducting medical trials – say for U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] approval – quantify and randomize the covariates that can be identified. Researchers attempt to reduce the biases of observational studies with complicated statistical methods such as [[propensity score matching]] methods, which require large populations of subjects and extensive information on covariates. Outcomes are also quantified when possible (bone density, the amount of some cell or substance in the blood, physical strength or endurance, etc.) and not based on a subject's or a professional observer's opinion. In this way, the design of an observational study can render the results more objective and therefore, more convincing.

== Ethics ==
{{main|Research ethics}}

By placing the distribution of the independent variable(s) under the control of the researcher, an experiment – particularly when it involves [[human subject research|human subjects]] – introduces potential ethical considerations, such as balancing benefit and harm, fairly distributing interventions (e.g., treatments for a disease), and [[informed consent]]. For example, in psychology or health care, it is unethical to provide a substandard treatment to patients. Therefore, ethical review boards are supposed to stop clinical trials and other experiments unless a new treatment is believed to offer benefits as good as current best practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bailey|first1=R.A.|title=Design of comparative experiments|date=2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=9780521683579}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also generally unethical (and often illegal) to conduct randomized experiments on the effects of substandard or harmful treatments, such as the effects of ingesting arsenic on human health. To understand the effects of such exposures, scientists sometimes use observational studies to understand the effects of those factors.

Even when experimental research does not directly involve human subjects, it may still present ethical concerns. For example, the nuclear bomb experiments conducted by the [[Manhattan Project]] implied the use of nuclear reactions to harm human beings even though the experiments did not directly involve any human subjects.

== Experimental method in law ==

The experimental method can be useful in solving juridical problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zippelius|first1=von Reinhold|title=Die experimentierende Methode im Recht|date=1991|publisher=Steiner|location=Stuttgart|isbn=978-3515059015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''George Bass''' was an optician known to have made an [[achromatic lens|achromatic]] [[doublet (lens)|doublet]] around 1733.  

The instructions for the constructions were given by [[Chester Moore Hall]].  According to [[Fred Hoyle|Hoyle]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Fred Hoyle]], ''Astronomy; A history of man's investigation of the universe'', Rathbone Books Limited, 1962, {{LCCN|6214108}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hall wished to keep his work on the achromatic lenses a secret and contracted the manufacture of the [[Crown glass (optics)|crown]] and [[flint glass|flint]] lenses to two different opticians, [[Edward Scarlett]] and James Mann.&lt;ref name="Dollond"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mhs.ox.ac.uk/sphaera/index.htm?issue8/articl5 | title=Peter Dollond answers Jesse Ramsden | publisher=[[Museum of the History of Science, Oxford]] | work=Sphaera 8 |author=J.

He realized the two components were for the same client and, after fitting the two parts together, noted the achromatic properties.  Not being as reticent as Hall, Bass let others know of the lens's properties and the method of making an achromatic doublet spread.

'''{{nihongo|Izuo Hayashi|林 厳雄|Hayashi Izuo|}}''' (May 1, 1922 – September 26, 2005) was a Japanese [[physicist]].

Hayashi was born in [[Tokyo]] in 1922 and graduated from the faculty of science, [[University of Tokyo]] in 1946. He worked as assistant professor at the Institute for Nuclear Research of the same university and defended his PhD in 1962. After the PhD defense, he stayed for a year at [[MIT]], and between 1964 and 1971 worked at [[Bell Labs]] on [[semiconductor laser]]s. In 1971 he joined the Research Laboratories of [[NEC]] where he continued his studies of semiconductor lasers, aiming to improve their reliability and lifetime. Between 1982 and 1987 he was a head scientist at NEC and in 1987–1994 became director of the Optoelectronics Technology Research Laboratory in [[Tsukuba]]. From 1994 till retirement in 1996 he served as advisor in the same laboratory. Hayashi died of [[acute leukemia]] in 2005.&lt;ref name=r1/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eaj.or.jp/eajnews/news107/news107-6-j.html Obituary of Izuo Hayashi] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120728234626/http://www.eaj.or.jp/eajnews/news107/news107-6-j.html |date=2012-07-28 }}.

JMMS was founded by [[Joseph Gelfer]] who remains the executive editor.

==Overview==

JMMS seeks to be as inclusive as possible in its area of enquiry. Papers address the full spectrum of [[masculinities]] and sexualities, particularly those which are seldom heard. Similarly, JMMS addresses not only [[monotheistic]] religions and spiritualities but also Eastern, [[indigenous peoples|indigenous]], [[new religious movements]] and other spiritualities which resist categorization. JMMS papers address historical and contemporary phenomena as well as speculative essays about future spiritualities.

The first issue of JMMS featured, published in January 2007, an editorial by Joseph Gelfer; research notes of Yvonne Maria Werner and Anna Prestjan; articles by Roland Boer, Frank A. Salamone, David Shneer, Juan M. Marin and Rini Bhattacharya Mehta; and book reviews by Joseph Gelfer, James Bryant, Wisam Mansour, Sophie Smith, Katharina von Kellenbach and Nathan Abrams.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jmmsweb.org/issues/volume1/number1 Volume 1, Number 1: Table of Contents] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130628105537/http://www.jmmsweb.org/issues/volume1/number1 |date=2013-06-28 }} JMMS.&lt;/ref&gt;

Issues of JMMS are included in the [https://web.archive.org/web/20080719204549/http://www.informit.com.au/humanitiessocialsciencecollection.html Informit e-Library], an Australasian online scholarly research repository; as well as [[EBSCO Industries|EBSCO]], and [[Gale (publisher)| Gale Cengage]].

'''LI-900''' is a type of reusable surface insulation tile developed and manufactured by [[Lockheed Martin|Lockheed Missiles and Space Company]] in [[Sunnyvale, California|Sunnyvale]], [[California]]. It was designed for use on the [[Space Shuttle orbiter]] as part of its [[Space Shuttle thermal protection system|thermal protection system]] to minimize [[thermal conductivity]] while providing maximum [[thermal shock]] resistance.&lt;ref name="nasareport"/&gt;

==Statistics==

LI-900 has a bulk density of 144.2&amp;nbsp;kg/m³ (9&amp;nbsp;lb/ft³). It was for this reason that it was called the LI-900. It is made from 99.9% pure [[silica glass]] fibres, and is 94% air by volume. An LI-900 tile can be heated to 1204&amp;nbsp;°C (about 1478 K or 2200 Fahrenheit) and then immediately plunged into cold water and suffer no damage.&lt;ref name="nasareport"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/kennedy/pdf/167473main_TPS-06rev.pdf |title=Orbiter Thermal Protection System, Thermal Materials |publisher=[[NASA]] |format=[[PDF]] |year=2006 |pages=3 |accessdate=2008-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*White tiles (known as LRSI) were used mainly on the upper surface and have higher thermal reflectivity. These are therefore pointed towards the sun in order to minimize solar gain.
*Black tiles (known as HRSI) are optimized for maximum emissivity, which means they lose heat faster than white tiles. This property is required in order to maximise heat rejection during re-entry.

There are typically 20,000 HRSI LI-900 tiles on a Space Shuttle, and 725 LRSI LI-900 tiles.

[[File:Shuttle tile.jpg|thumb|A used tile from ''[[Space Shuttle Atlantis|Atlantis]]'']]

===Strength===
As a result of optimizing its thermal properties, overall strength was reduced. The tile was therefore not suitable to be used in high-stress areas such as around the landing gear doors and windows. To solve this, a higher strength version of the LI-900 material was produced, with a bulk density of 352.4&amp;nbsp;kg/m³ (22&amp;nbsp;lbs/ft³), which was called the LI-2200.&lt;ref name="nasareport"/&gt; This tile provided the strength and insulating properties, but with a considerable weight penalty.

===Damage reduction===
A research and development program was started to establish a means for substantially improving the damage resistance and micrometeorite orbital debris (MMOD) characteristics of the LI-900 shuttle baseline tile. This would result in a greatly reduced amount of damage and therefore less repair between flights.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

A short term solution was found by developing a new surface treatment for the tile, which took advantage of the Ames technology previously developed, and designated TUFI. A prototype of this material was produced successfully, its damage resistance was determined, and its microstructural stability was demonstrated.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

A longer term solution used AETB-8 as the insulation substrate. This substrate is significantly stronger than the LI-900 substrate, and is more compatible with the TUFI surface treatment.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}

This is a '''list of Chinese astronauts''', people trained by the [[China National Space Administration]] (CNSA) to command, pilot, or serve as a crew member of a [[spacecraft]].

As the [[Chinese space program]] developed during the sixties, various proposals for manned spacecraft were made. The first manned spacecraft proposed by the [[People's Republic of China]] during the late 1960s and early 1970s was the [[Shuguang (spacecraft)|Shuguang One]] which was expected to bring the first Chinese [[astronaut]] in 1973 into space.&lt;ref name="Shuguang 1"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.astronautix.com/craft/shuuang1.htm|title= Shuguang 1|accessdate= 2011-02-13|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070714161906/http://www.astronautix.com/craft/shuuang1.htm|archivedate= 2007-07-14|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For this programme 19 astronauts were selected in 1971.&lt;ref name="Shuguang 1"/&gt; However, shortly after these plans were made, several leading scientists attached to the project were denounced during the [[Cultural Revolution]], bringing progress to a standstill.&lt;ref name="Shuguang 1"/&gt; Instead, NASA astronaut [[Taylor Wang]], a naturalized U.S. citizen born in China, became the first ethnically Chinese person in space in 1985.

The [[People's Liberation Army Astronaut Corps]] was established in 1998 for the selection of [[Shenzhou program]] astronauts.&lt;ref name="Xi2003"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.people.com.cn/GB/keji/1059/2139570.html |title=中国航天员诞生记 |last=Xi |first=Qixin |date=2003-10-17 |work=Xinhua.net |access-date=2018-11-11 |agency=Xinhua |last2=Fan |first2=Juwei |editor-last=Xu |editor-first=Dongmei |trans-title=Birth of Chinese Astronauts |last3=Liu |first3=Cheng}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, [[Yang Liwei]] was launched aboard [[Shenzhou 5]], becoming the first person sent into space by the Chinese space program.&lt;ref name="Shenzhou 5"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.astronautix.com/flights/shezhou5.htm|title= Shenzhou 5|accessdate= 2011-02-13|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110628182248/http://www.astronautix.com/flights/shezhou5.htm|archivedate= 2011-06-28|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This achievement made China the third country to independently send humans into space. During the [[Shenzhou 7]] mission in 2008, [[Zhai Zhigang]] became the first Chinese citizen to carry out a [[spacewalk]].&lt;ref name="Shenzhou 7"&gt;{{cite web |url=  http://www.astronautix.com/flights/shezhou7.htm |title= Shenzhou 7|accessdate=2011-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, [[Liu Yang (astronaut)|Liu Yang]] became the first Chinese woman to be launched into space when she was launched aboard [[Shenzhou 9]].

As of 2017, eleven Chinese nationals have traveled in space.

This is a '''list of [[Unicode]] [[character (computing)|characters]]'''. As of version 11.0, Unicode contains a repertoire of over 137,000 characters covering 146 modern and historic [[Script (Unicode)|scripts]], as well as multiple symbol sets. As it is [[WP:CHOKING|not technically possible]] to list all of these characters in a single Wikipedia page, this list is limited to a subset of the most important characters for English-language readers, with links to other pages which list the supplementary characters. This page includes the 1062 characters in the Multilingual European Character Set 2 ([[MES-2]]) subset, and some additional related characters.

==Character reference overview==
{{See also|List of XML and HTML character entity references|Unicode input}}
An [[HTML]] or [[XML]] ''numeric character reference'' refers to a character by its [[Universal Character Set]]/[[Unicode]] ''code point'', and uses the format

:&lt;code&gt;&amp;#&lt;/code&gt;''nnnn''&lt;code&gt;;&lt;/code&gt;
or
:&lt;code&gt;&amp;#x&lt;/code&gt;''hhhh''&lt;code&gt;;&lt;/code&gt;

where ''nnnn'' is the code point in [[decimal]] form, and ''hhhh'' is the code point in [[hexadecimal]] form. The ''x'' must be lowercase in XML documents. The ''nnnn'' or ''hhhh'' may be any number of digits and may include leading zeros. The ''hhhh'' may mix uppercase and lowercase, though uppercase is the usual style.

In contrast, a ''character entity reference'' refers to a character by the name of an ''[[SGML entity|entity]]'' which has the desired character as its ''replacement text''. The entity must either be predefined (built into the markup language) or explicitly declared in a [[Document Type Definition]] (DTD). The format is the same as for any entity reference:

:&lt;code&gt;&amp;&lt;/code&gt;''name''&lt;code&gt;;&lt;/code&gt;

where ''name'' is the case-sensitive name of the entity. The semicolon is required.

==Control codes==
{{Main|Unicode control characters|C0 and C1 control codes}}
{{See also|ASCII#ASCII control characters|Control Pictures}}
65 characters, including [[Delete character|DEL]] but not [[Space (punctuation)|SP]]. All belong to the [[common (script)|common]] script.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31185">A list of [[particle accelerator]]s used for [[particle physics]] experiments. Some early particle accelerators that more properly did [[nuclear physics]], but existed prior to the separation of particle physics from that field, are also included. Although a modern accelerator complex usually has several stages of accelerators, only accelerators whose output has been used directly for experiments are listed.

== Early accelerators ==

These all used single beams with fixed targets. They tended to have very briefly run, inexpensive, and unnamed experiments.

=== Cyclotrons ===

== Hypothetical accelerators ==
Besides the real accelerators listed above, there are hypothetical accelerators often used
as hypothetical examples or optimistic projects by particle physicists.
* '''Eloisatron''' (Eurasiatic Long Intersecting Storage Accelerator) was a project of [[INFN]] headed by [[Antonio Zichichi]] at the [[Ettore Majorana Foundation and Centre for Scientific Culture]] in [[Erice]], [[Sicily]]. The center-of-mass energy was planned to be 200 TeV, and the size was planned to span parts of [[Europe]] and [[Asia]].
* '''Fermitron''' was an accelerator sketched by [[Enrico Fermi]] on a notepad in the 1940s proposing an accelerator in stable orbit around the earth.
* The '''undulator radiation collider'''&lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.04469 [1704.04469&amp;#93; The Undulator Radiation Collider: An Energy Efficient Design For A $\sqrt{s}=10^{15}$ GeV Collider&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; is a design for an accelerator with a center-of-mass energy around the [[Grand unification energy|GUT scale]]. It would be [[light-week]]s across and require the construction of a [[Dyson swarm]] around the [[Sun]].
* '''Planckatron''' is an accelerator with a center-of-mass energy of the order of the [[Planck scale]]. It is estimated that the radius of the Planckatron would have to be roughly the radius of the Milky Way. It would require so much energy to run that it could only be built by at least a [[Kardashev scale|Kardashev Type II civilization]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.01509 [1503.01509&amp;#93; SETI at Planck Energy: When Particle Physicists Become Cosmic Engineers&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Arguably also in this category falls the [[Zevatron]], a hypothetical source for observed ultra-high-energy cosmic rays.
&lt;!--

Google testers: only the Fermitron cannot be googled successfully (yet). If someone knows a better phrase, fine --&gt;

{{History of printing}}
'''Lithography''' ({{ety|grc|''[[wikt:λίθος|λίθος]]'', lithos|stone||''[[wikt:γράφειν|γράφειν]]'', graphein|to write}})&lt;ref name=EB1911&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Lithography |volume=16 |pages=785–789 |first=Frederick Vincent |last=Brooks}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a method of [[printing]] originally based on the [[miscibility|immiscibility]] of oil and water.&lt;ref&gt;Weaver, Peter. (1964) ''The Technique of Lithography''. London: [[B.T. Batsford]], p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; The printing is from a stone ([[lithographic limestone]]) or a metal plate with a smooth surface. It was invented in 1796 by German author and actor [[Alois Senefelder]] as a cheap method of publishing theatrical works.&lt;ref name="meggspage146"&gt;Meggs, Philip B. A History of Graphic Design. (1998) John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. p 146 {{ISBN|0-471-29198-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="carterpage11"&gt;Carter, Rob, Ben Day, Philip Meggs. Typographic Design: Form and Communication, Third Edition. (2002) John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. p 11&lt;/ref&gt; Lithography can be used to print text or [[artwork (graphic arts)|artwork]] onto paper or other suitable material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Lithography and Lithographers |publisher=T. Fisher Unwin Publisher |place=London |year=1915 |editor=Pennel ER |url=https://archive.org/details/lithographylitho00penn }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lithography originally used an image drawn with oil, fat, or wax onto the surface of a smooth, level [[lithographic limestone]] plate. The stone was treated with a mixture of acid and [[gum arabic]], ''[[etching]]'' the portions of the stone that were not protected by the grease-based image. When the stone was subsequently moistened, these etched areas retained water; an [[offset ink|oil-based ink]] could then be applied and would be repelled by the water, sticking only to the original drawing. The ink would finally be transferred to a blank [[paper]] sheet, producing a [[printing|printed page]]. This traditional technique is still used in some [[fine art]] printmaking applications.

In modern lithography, the image is made of a [[polymer]] coating applied to a flexible plastic or metal plate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stbarnabaspress.co.uk/digital-photographic.html|title=Digital &amp; Photographic|first=James|last=Hill|website=www.stbarnabaspress.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The image can be printed directly from the plate (the orientation of the image is reversed), or it can be [[offset printing|offset]], by transferring the image onto a flexible sheet (rubber) for printing and publication.

As a printing technology, lithography is different from [[intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio printing]] (gravure), wherein a plate is either [[engraving|engraved]], [[etching|etched]], or [[mezzotint|stippled]] to score cavities to contain the printing ink; and [[woodblock printing]] or [[letterpress]] printing, wherein ink is applied to the raised surfaces of letters or images. Today, most types of high-volume books and magazines, especially when illustrated in colour, are printed with [[offset lithography]], which has become the most common form of printing technology since the 1960s.

The related term "[[photolithography]]" refers to when photographic images are used in lithographic printing, whether these images are printed directly from a stone or from a metal plate, as in offset printing. "Photolithography" is used synonymously with "offset printing".  The technique as well as the term were introduced in Europe in the 1850s. Beginning in the 1960s, photolithography has played an important role in the fabrication and [[mass production]] of [[integrated circuit]]s  in the [[microelectronics industry]].&lt;ref&gt;Hannavy, John. editor. ''Encyclopedia of nineteenth-century photography: A-I, index, Volume 1.'' Taylor &amp; Francis (2008). {{ISBN|9780415972352}}. page 865.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mansuripur, Masud. ''Classical Optics and Its Applications''. Cambridge University Press (2002) {{ISBN|9780521804998}}. page 416&lt;/ref&gt;

==The principle of lithography==
Lithography uses simple chemical processes to create an image.  For instance, the positive part of an image is a water-repelling ("[[Hydrophobe|hydrophobic]]") substance, while the negative image would be water-retaining ("[[hydrophilic]]").  Thus, when the plate is introduced to a compatible printing ink and water mixture, the ink will adhere to the positive image and the water will clean the negative image.  This allows a flat print plate to be used, enabling much longer and more detailed print runs than the older physical methods of printing (e.g., [[Intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio printing]], [[letterpress printing]]).

Lithography was invented by [[Alois Senefelder]]&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; in the [[Kingdom of Bavaria]] in 1796.  In the early days of lithography, a smooth piece of [[limestone]] was used (hence the name "lithography": "lithos" (λιθος) is the ancient Greek word for stone).  After the oil-based image was put on the surface, a solution of [[gum arabic]] in water was applied, the gum sticking only to the non-oily surface. During printing, water adhered to the gum arabic surfaces and was repelled by the oily parts, while the oily ink used for printing did the opposite.

===Lithography on limestone===
[[Image:Litography negative stone and positive paper.jpg|thumb|Lithography stone and [[mirror image]] print of a map of Munich]]

Lithography works because of the mutual [[Hydrophobe|repulsion of oil and water]]. The image is drawn on the surface of the print plate with a fat or oil-based medium (hydrophobic) such as a wax crayon, which may be pigmented to make the drawing visible. A wide range of oil-based media is available, but the durability of the image on the stone depends on the [[lipid]] content of the material being used, and its ability to withstand water and acid. After the drawing of the image, an aqueous [[solution]] of [[gum arabic]], weakly acidified with nitric acid {{chem|HNO|3}} is applied to the stone. The function of this solution is to create a hydrophilic layer of [[calcium nitrate]] salt, {{chem|Ca(NO|3|)|2}}, and gum arabic on all non-image surfaces.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt; The gum solution penetrates into the pores of the stone, completely surrounding the original image with a hydrophilic layer that will not accept the printing ink. Using lithographic [[turpentine]], the printer then removes any excess of the greasy drawing material, but a hydrophobic molecular film of it remains tightly bonded to the surface of the stone, rejecting the gum arabic and water, but ready to accept the oily ink.&lt;ref&gt;[[A. Hoen &amp; Co.|A. B. Hoen]], Discussion of the Requisite Qualities of Lithographic Limestone, with Report on Tests of the Lithographic Stone of Mitchell County, Iowa, [https://books.google.com/books?id=XBIMAAAAYAAJ&amp;lpg=RA1-PA339&amp;pg=RA1-PA339 Iowa Geological Survey Annual Report, 1902], Des Moines, 1903; pages 339–352.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gascoigne|first1=Bamber|title=How to Identify Prints: a complete guide to manual and mechanical processes from woodcut to ink jet|date=1988|publisher=Thames and Hudson|location=Spain|page=1c}}&lt;/ref&gt; When printing, the stone is kept wet with water. Naturally the water is attracted to the layer of gum and salt created by the acid wash. [[Printing ink]] based on drying oils such as [[linseed oil]] and varnish loaded with [[pigment]] is then rolled over the surface. The water repels the greasy ink but the hydrophobic areas left by the original drawing material accept it. When the hydrophobic image is loaded with ink, the stone and paper are run through a press that applies even pressure over the surface, transferring the ink to the paper and off the stone.

Senefelder had experimented during the early 19th century with multicolor lithography; in his 1819 book, he predicted that the process would eventually be perfected and used to reproduce paintings.&lt;ref name="meggspage146"/&gt; Multi-color printing was introduced by a new process developed by [[Godefroy Engelmann]] (France) in 1837 known as [[chromolithography]].&lt;ref name="meggspage146"/&gt; A separate stone was used for each color, and a print went through the press separately for each stone. The main challenge was to keep the images aligned (''[[Printing registration|in register]]''). This method lent itself to images consisting of large areas of flat color, and resulted in the characteristic poster designs of this period.

"Lithography, or printing from soft stone, largely took the place of engraving in the production of English commercial maps after about 1852. It was a quick, cheap process and had been used to print British army maps during the [[Peninsula War]]. Most of the commercial maps of the second half of the 19th century were lithographed and unattractive, though accurate enough."&lt;ref&gt;Lynam, Edward. 1944. British Maps and Map Makers. London: W. Collins. Page 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern lithographic process===
{{main|Offset printing}}
[[Image:Gubernie zachodnie krolestwo polskie 1902.jpg|thumb|A 1902 lithograph map (original size 33×24 cm)]]

High-volume lithography is used presently to produce posters, maps, books, newspapers, and packaging—just about any smooth, mass-produced item with print and graphics on it. Most books, indeed all types of high-volume text, are now printed using [[Offset printing|offset lithography]].

For offset lithography, which depends on photographic processes, flexible aluminum, polyester, mylar or paper printing plates are used instead of stone tablets. Modern printing plates have a brushed or roughened texture and are covered with a photosensitive [[emulsion]].  A photographic negative of the desired image is placed in contact with the emulsion and the plate is exposed to ultraviolet light. After development, the emulsion shows a reverse of the negative image, which is thus a duplicate of the original (positive) image. The image on the plate emulsion can also be created by direct laser imaging in a CTP ([[Computer to plate|Computer-To-Plate]]) device known as a platesetter. The positive image is the emulsion that remains after imaging. Non-image portions of the emulsion have traditionally been removed by a chemical process, though in recent times plates have come available that do not require such processing.

[[Image:Litography press with map of Moosburg 02.jpg|thumb|left|Lithography press for printing maps in Munich]]
[[Image:Lithography machine in Bibliotheca Alexandrina.jpg|thumb|right|Lithography machine in [[Bibliotheca Alexandrina]]]]
The plate is affixed to a cylinder on a printing press. Dampening rollers apply water, which covers the blank portions of the plate but is repelled by the emulsion of the image area. Hydrophobic ink, which is repelled by the water and only adheres to the emulsion of the image area, is then applied by the inking rollers.

If this image were transferred directly to paper, it would create a mirror-type image and the paper would become too wet. Instead, the plate rolls against a cylinder covered with a rubber ''blanket'', which squeezes away the water, picks up the ink and transfers it to the paper with uniform pressure. The paper passes between the blanket cylinder and a counter-pressure or impression cylinder and the image is transferred to the paper. Because the image is first transferred, or ''offset'' to the rubber blanket cylinder, this reproduction method is known as ''offset lithography'' or ''[[offset printing]]''.&lt;ref&gt;see diagram at [http://www.compassrose.com/static/Offset.jpg compassrose.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many innovations and technical refinements have been made in printing processes and presses over the years, including the development of [[Printing press|presses]] with multiple units (each containing one printing plate) that can print multi-color images in one pass on both sides of the sheet, and presses that accommodate continuous rolls (''webs'') of paper, known as web presses. Another innovation was the continuous dampening system first introduced by Dahlgren, instead of the old method (conventional dampening) which is still used on older presses, using rollers covered with molleton (cloth) that absorbs the water. This increased control of the water flow to the plate and allowed for better ink and water balance. Current dampening systems include a "delta effect or vario," which slows the roller in contact with the plate, thus creating a sweeping movement over the ink image to clean impurities known as "hickies".

[[Image:Litography archive of the Bayerisches Vermessungsamt.jpg|thumb|Archive of lithographic stones in Munich]]

The process of lithography printing is illustrated by [http://www.istc.illinois.edu/info/library_docs/manuals/printing/images/offsetlitho.gif this simplified diagram]. This press is also called an ink pyramid because the ink is transferred through several layers of rollers with different purposes. Fast lithographic 'web' printing presses are commonly used in newspaper production.

The advent of [[desktop publishing]] made it possible for type and images to be modified easily on personal computers for eventual printing by desktop or commercial presses. The development of digital [[imagesetter]]s enabled print shops to produce negatives for platemaking directly from digital input, skipping the intermediate step of photographing an actual page layout. The development of the digital [[platesetter]] during the late 20th century eliminated film negatives altogether by exposing printing plates directly from digital input, a process known as [[computer to plate]] printing.

==Microlithography and nanolithography==
{{Main|Photolithography}}
Microlithography and [[nanolithography]] refer specifically to lithographic patterning methods capable of structuring material on a fine scale. Typically, features smaller than 10 [[micrometers]] are considered microlithographic, and features smaller than 100 [[nanometers]] are considered nanolithographic. [[Photolithography]] is one of these methods, often applied to [[semiconductor]] manufacturing of [[integrated circuit|microchips]]. Photolithography is also commonly used for fabricating [[microelectromechanical systems]] (MEMS) devices. Photolithography generally uses a pre-fabricated [[photomask]] or reticle as a master from which the final pattern is derived.

Although photolithographic technology is the most commercially advanced form of nanolithography, other techniques are also used. Some, for example [[electron beam lithography]], are capable of much greater patterning resolution (sometimes as small as a few nanometers). Electron beam lithography is also important commercially, primarily for its use in the manufacture of photomasks. Electron beam lithography as it is usually practiced is a form of [[maskless lithography]], in that a mask is not required to generate the final pattern. Instead, the final pattern is created directly from a digital representation on a computer, by controlling an electron beam as it scans across a [[resist]]-coated substrate. Electron beam lithography has the disadvantage of being much slower than photolithography.

In addition to these commercially well-established techniques, a large number of promising microlithographic and [[nanolithography|nanolithographic]] technologies exist or are being developed, including [[nanoimprint lithography]], [[interference lithography]], [[X-ray lithography]], [[extreme ultraviolet lithography]], [[magnetolithography]] and [[scanning probe lithography]]. Some of these new techniques have been used successfully for small-scale commercial and important research applications.

==Lithography as an artistic medium==
[[File:Redon smiling-spider.jpg|thumb|left|''Smiling Spider'' by [[Odilon Redon]], 1891]]
During the first years of the 19th century, lithography had only a limited effect on [[printmaking]], mainly because technical difficulties remained to be overcome. Germany was the main center of production in this period. [[Godefroy Engelmann]], who moved his press from [[Mulhouse]] to Paris in 1816, largely succeeded in resolving the technical problems, and during the 1820s lithography was adopted by artists such as [[Eugène Delacroix|Delacroix]] and [[Géricault]]. After early experiments such as ''Specimens of Polyautography'' (1803),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=''Specimens of Polyautography, Consisting of Impressions taken from Original Drawings, Made on Stone purposely for this Work’' | date=1803|  publisher=Philipp André| location=London|  url=http://primo.getty.edu/GRI:GETTY_ALMA21118663020001551}}&lt;/ref&gt; which had experimental works by  a number of British artists including [[Benjamin West]], [[Henry Fuseli]],  [[James Barry (painter)|James Barry]], [[Thomas Barker of Bath]],  [[Thomas Stothard]],   [[Henry Richard Greville]], [[Richard Cooper Jr.|Richard Cooper]],   [[Henry Singleton (painter)|Henry Singleton]], and  [[William Henry Pyne]], London also became a center, and some of Géricault's prints were in fact produced there. [[Goya]] in Bordeaux produced his last series of prints by lithography—''The Bulls of Bordeaux'' of 1828. By the mid-century the initial enthusiasm had somewhat diminished in both countries, although the use of lithography was increasingly favored for commercial applications, which included the prints of [[Daumier]], published in newspapers. [[Rodolphe Bresdin]] and [[Jean-François Millet]] also continued to practice the medium in France, and [[Adolf Menzel]] in Germany. In 1862 the publisher Cadart tried to initiate a portfolio of lithographs by various artists, which was not successful but included several prints by [[Manet]]. The revival began during the 1870s, especially in France with artists such as [[Odilon Redon]], [[Henri Fantin-Latour]] and [[Degas]] producing much of their work in this manner. The need for strictly limited [[edition (printmaking)|edition]]s to maintain the price had now been realized, and the medium became more accepted.

[[File:Edvard Munch - Self-Portrait (1895) G0192-59 - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''Self Portrait with Skeleton Arm'' by [[Edvard Munch]]]]
In the 1890s, color lithography gained success in part by the emergence of [[Jules Chéret]], known as the ''father of the modern poster'', whose work went on to inspire a new generation of poster designers and painters, most notably [[Toulouse-Lautrec]], and former student of Chéret, [[Georges de Feure]]. By 1900 the medium in both color and monotone was an accepted part of printmaking.

During the 20th century, a group of artists, including [[Georges Braque|Braque]], [[Alexander Calder|Calder]], [[Chagall]], [[Dufy]], [[Léger]], [[Matisse]], [[Joan Miró|Miró]], and [[Picasso]], rediscovered the largely undeveloped artform of lithography thanks to the [[Mourlot Studios]], also known as ''Atelier Mourlot'', a Parisian printshop founded in 1852 by the Mourlot family. The Atelier Mourlot originally specialized in the printing of wallpaper; but it was transformed when the founder's grandson, [[Fernand Mourlot]], invited a number of 20th-century artists to explore the complexities of fine art printing. Mourlot encouraged the painters to work directly on lithographic stones in order to create original artworks that could then be executed under the direction of master printers in small editions&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.academia.edu/36544351/PICASSO_LITHOGRAPHER_AND_ACTIVIST|title=Picasso lithographer and activist|last=Orozco|first=Miguel|publisher=Academia.edu|year=2018|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The combination of modern artist and master printer resulted in lithographs that were used as posters to promote the artists' work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fiaf.org/laboutique/mourlot History of 20th century lithography by Picasso, Matisse, Chagall, Braque, Leger at Atelier Mourlot, French Institute Alliance Française] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120723085822/http://www.fiaf.org/laboutique/mourlot |date=July 23, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mourlot, Fernand. ''Twentieth Century Posters.'' Wellfleet Press: Secaucus, New Jersey, 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Grant Wood]], [[George Bellows]], [[Alphonse Mucha]], [[Max Kahn]], [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Eleanor Coen]], [[Jasper Johns]], [[David Hockney]], [[Susan Dorothea White]] and [[Robert Rauschenberg]] are a few of the artists who have produced most of their prints in the medium. [[M. C. Escher]] is considered a master of lithography, and many of his prints were created using this process. More than other printmaking techniques, [[printmaker]]s in lithography still largely depend on access to good [[Printer (publishing)|printer]]s, and the development of the medium has been greatly influenced by when and where these have been established.
{{Further|List of printmakers}}
As a special form of lithography, the serilith process is sometimes used. Seriliths are mixed media original prints created in a process in which an artist uses the [[lithograph]] and [[serigraph]] processes. The separations for both processes are hand-drawn by the artist. The serilith technique is used primarily to create fine art limited print editions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrysideart.com/serigraphy.htm|title=What is a Serilith?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''MS ''Polarfront''''' was a Norwegian [[weather ship]] located in the North Atlantic. She was the last remaining weather ship in the world, maintained by the [[Norwegian Meteorological Institute]].

A weather ship is a [[ship]] stationed in mid-[[ocean]] to make meteorological observations for [[weather forecasting]]. Since the 1960s this role has been largely superseded by [[satellite]]s, long range [[aircraft]] and [[weather buoy]]s.

MS ''Polarfront'' was known as the weather station M ("Mike"), and was located at 66°N, 02°E. Standard meteorological observations were performed on an hourly basis since the beginning of the 1960s.

On 27 February 2009, the cancellation of the station was announced.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yr.no/nyheter/1.6499421 Siste reis for værskipet - yr.no (Norwegian)]&lt;/ref&gt;  MS ''Polarfront'' was removed from service on 1 January 2010.

== History of Station M ==
The [[International Civil Aviation Organization]] (ICAO) took the responsibility to operate an international network of Ocean Weather Stations in The North-Atlantic. The network was established in 1948 and consisted of 13 stations. Station ‘M’ (Mike) was one of these. The need for weather ships from civil aviation decreased gradually while the Meteorological society still needed the observations from the oceans. In 1974 the [[World Meteorological Organization]] (WMO) took the responsibility for the four remaining stations. The international agreement about weather ships was ended in 1990. Great Britain and Norway continued the operation of one station each, Lima west of Scotland and Mike in the Norwegian Sea. Lima was ended in the middle of the 1990s. Thus Mike was the only one still remaining.

The first two weather ships to man station “M” were ''Polarfront I'' and ''Polarfront II''. The Norwegian authorities were the ship owners. The ships were rebuilt [[Royal Navy]] [[Flower-class corvette|corvettes]] ({{HMS|Saxifrage|K04|6}} and {{HMS|Bryony|K192|6}}). They were on duty until 1974 and 1976. In 1974 the Norwegian state made an agreement with the shipping company Misje Offshore Marine AS in [[Bergen]] to hire a new and modern ship, which was given the name ''Polarfront''.

For several years the ship alternated with the Dutch weather ship ''Cumulus'' to man station ‘M’. From 1986 and onward ''Polarfront'' manned station ‘M’ alone. Each month ''Polarfront'' left the station for 1–2 days to take on a new crew and new supplies. Once a year, usually in the beginning of October, the ship stayed in her home port for a week to carry out maintenance.

== LATITUDE BLANCHE the polar french line ==
Since the 28 June 2017, Polarfront is owned and operated by the French shipping company Latitude Blanche for expedition purposes in high latitudes.

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
A '''pelvic fracture''' is a [[bone fracture|break of the bony structure]] of the [[pelvis]].&lt;ref name=OI2016/&gt; This includes any break of the [[sacrum]], [[hip bone]]s ([[ischium]], [[pubis (bone)|pubis]], [[ilium (bone)|ilium]]), or [[tailbone]].&lt;ref name=OI2016/&gt; Symptoms include pain, particularly with movement.&lt;ref name=OI2016/&gt; Complications may include [[internal bleeding]], [[injury to the bladder]], or [[vaginal trauma]].&lt;ref name=ATLS2018/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pei2008/&gt;

&lt;!-- Cause and diagnosis --&gt;
Common causes include [[fall]]s, [[motor vehicle collisions]], a [[pedestrian]] being hit by a vehicle, or a direct [[crush injury]].&lt;ref name=ATLS2018/&gt; In younger people [[significant trauma]] is typically required while in older people less significant trauma can result in a fracture.&lt;ref name=OI2016/&gt; They are divided into two types: stable and unstable.&lt;ref name=OI2016/&gt; Unstable fractures are further divided into anterior posterior compression, lateral compression, vertical shear, and combined mechanism fractures.&lt;ref name=ATLS2018&gt;{{cite book|title=ATLS - Advanced Trauma Life Support - Student Course Manual|date=2018|publisher=American College of Surgeons|isbn=78-0-9968262-3-5|pages=89, 96–97|edition=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=OI2016/&gt; Diagnosis is suspected based on symptoms and [[physical examination|examination]] with confirmation by [[Radiography|X-ray]]s or [[Computed tomography|CT scan]].&lt;ref name=OI2016/&gt; If a person is fully awake and has no pain of the pelvis medical imaging is not needed.&lt;ref name=ATLS2018/&gt;

&lt;!-- Treatment --&gt;
Emergency treatment generally follows [[Advanced Trauma Life Support|advanced trauma life support]].&lt;ref name=ATLS2018/&gt; This begins with efforts to stop bleeding and [[replace fluids]].&lt;ref name=ATLS2018/&gt; Bleeding control may be achieved by using a [[pelvic binder]] or [[bed-sheet]] to support the pelvis.&lt;ref name=ATLS2018/&gt; Other efforts may include [[angiographic embolization]] or [[preperitoneal packing]].&lt;ref name=ATLS2018/&gt; After stabilization, the pelvis may require surgical reconstruction.&lt;ref name=ATLS2018/&gt;

&lt;!-- Epidemiology and history --&gt;
Pelvic fractures make up around 3% of adult fractures.&lt;ref name=OI2016/&gt; Stable fractures generally have a good outcome.&lt;ref name=OI2016/&gt; The risk of death with an unstable fracture is about 15%, while those who also have low blood pressure have a risk of death approaching 50%.&lt;ref name=ATLS2018/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ros2017&gt;{{cite book|last1=Walls|first1=Ron|last2=Hockberger|first2=Robert|last3=Gausche-Hill|first3=Marianne|title=Rosen's Emergency Medicine - Concepts and Clinical Practice E-Book|date=2017|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=9780323390163|pages=577, 588|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=OANODgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA577|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unstable fractures are often associated with injuries to other parts of the body.&lt;ref name=Pei2008&gt;{{cite book|last1=Peitzman|first1=Andrew B.|last2=Rhodes|first2=Michael|last3=Schwab|first3=C.

==Signs and symptoms==
Symptoms include pain, particularly with movement.&lt;ref name=OI2016/&gt;
===Complications===
Complications are likely to result in cases of excess blood loss or punctures to certain organs, possibly leading to [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]].&lt;ref name=Walker2011 /&gt;&lt;ref name=OrthoInfo_PelvicFx&gt;{{cite web|title=Fracture of the Pelvis|url=http://orthoinfo.aaos.org/topic.cfm?topic=a00223|work=OrthoInfo|publisher=American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons}}&lt;/ref&gt; Swelling and bruising may result, more so in high-impact injuries.&lt;ref name=OrthoInfo_PelvicFx /&gt; Pain in the affected areas may differ where severity of impact increases its likelihood and may radiate if symptoms are aggravated when one moves around.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

==Causes==
Common causes include [[fall]]s, [[motor vehicle collisions]], a [[pedestrian]] being hit by a vehicle, or a direct [[crush injury]].&lt;ref name=ATLS2018/&gt; In younger people [[significant trauma]] is typically required while in older people less significant trauma can result in a fracture.&lt;ref name=OI2016/&gt;

==Pathophysiology==

The bony pelvis consists of the [[Ilium (bone)|ilium]] (i.e., iliac wings), [[ischium]], and [[Pubis (bone)|pubis]], which form an anatomic ring with the sacrum. Disruption of this ring requires significant energy. When it comes to the stability and the structure of the [[Human pelvis|pelvis]], or pelvic girdle, understanding its function as support for the trunk and legs helps to recognize the effect a pelvic fracture has on someone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jr|first=Theodore Dimon|title=The body in motion : its evolution and design|year=2010|publisher=North Atlantic Books|location=Berkeley, Calif.|isbn=978-1556439704|pages=49–56}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pubic bone, the ischium and the ilium make up the pelvic girdle, fused together as one unit. They attach to both sides of the spine and circle around to create a ring and sockets to place [[Hip bone|hip]] [[Ball and socket joint|joints]]. Attachment to the [[Spine (human anatomy)|spine]] is important to direct force into the trunk from the legs as movement occurs, extending to one’s back. This requires the pelvis to be strong enough to withstand pressure and energy. Various muscles play important roles in pelvic stability. Because of the forces involved, pelvic fractures frequently involve injury to organs contained within the bony pelvis. In addition, trauma to extra-pelvic organs is common. Pelvic fractures are often associated with severe hemorrhage due to the extensive blood supply to the region. The veins of the presacral pelvic plexus are particularly vulnerable. Greater than 85 percent of bleeding due to pelvic fractures is venous or from the open surfaces of the bone.

===Classification===
[[File:FractureRtSandIRami(Sin2).png|thumb|Fractures of the superior (in two places) and inferior pubic rami on the person's right, in a person who has had prior hip replacements]]
Pelvic fractures are most commonly described using one of two classification systems. The different forces on the pelvis result in different fractures. Sometimes they are determined based on stability or instability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Young|first=JW|author2=Resnik, CS|title=Fracture of the Pelvis: Current Concepts of Classification|journal=AJR. American Journal of Roentgenology|date=December 1990|volume=155|issue=6|pages=1169–75|pmid=2122661|doi=10.2214/ajr.155.6.2122661}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tile classification====
The [[Tile classification]] system is based on the integrity of the posterior sacroiliac complex.

In type A injuries, the sacroiliac complex is intact. The pelvic ring has a stable fracture that can be managed nonoperatively.
Type B injuries are caused by either external or internal rotational forces resulting in partial disruption of the posterior sacroiliac complex. These are often unstable.
Type C injuries are characterized by complete disruption of the posterior sacroiliac complex and are both rotationally and vertically unstable. These injuries are the result of great force, usually from a motor vehicle crash, fall from a height, or severe compression.

====Young-Burgess classification====
[[File:Pelvic Fracture Young-Burgess Classification.png|Pelvic Fracture Young-Burgess Classification|right|300px|Superior view, Pelvic Fracture Types (2006).
Force and break are shown by matching color:
Anteroposterior compression type I (orange), Anteroposterior compression type  II (green), Anteroposterior compression type III (blue); Lateral compression type I (red), Lateral compression type II (purple), F. Lateral compression type III (black).
Increased force and breaks are shown by increasing size.
]]
[[File:Anterior view, Vertical Shear Fracture.png|Anterior view, Vertical Shear Fracture|right|300px|This fracture is best viewed anteriorly, while the other fractures are viewed superiorly. The arrow indicates where the force is coming from, and the colored lines indicate where the break occurs.]]

The [[Young-Burgess classification]] system is based on mechanism of injury: anteroposterior compression type I, II and III, lateral
compression types I, II and III, and vertical shear,&lt;ref name=Walker2011&gt;{{cite journal|last=Walker|first=J|title=Pelvic fractures: classification and nursing management.|journal=Nursing standard (Royal College of Nursing (Great Britain) : 1987)|date=Nov 9–15, 2011|volume=26|issue=10|pages=49–57; quiz 58|pmid=22206172|doi=10.7748/ns2011.11.26.10.49.c8816}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a combination of forces.

Lateral compression (LC) fractures involve transverse fractures of the pubic rami, either ipsilateral or contralateral to a posterior injury.
*Grade I&amp;nbsp;– Associated sacral compression on side of impact
*Grade II&amp;nbsp;– Associated posterior iliac ("crescent") fracture on side of impact
*Grade III&amp;nbsp;– Associated contralateral sacroiliac joint injury

The most common force type, lateral compression (LC) forces, from side-impact automobile accidents and pedestrian injuries, can result in an internal rotation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lee|first=C|author2=Porter, K|title=The prehospital management of pelvic fractures.|journal=Emergency medicine journal : EMJ|date=February 2007|volume=24|issue=2|pages=130–3|pmid=17251627|doi=10.1136/emj.2006.041384|pmc=2658194}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Superior pubic ramus|superior]] and [[Inferior pubic ramus|inferior pubic rami]] may fracture anteriorly, for example. Injuries from shear forces, like falls from above, can result in disruption of ligaments or bones. When multiple forces occur, it is called combined mechanical injury (CMI).

===Open book fracture===
One specific kind of pelvic fracture is known as an 'open book' fracture. This is often the result from a heavy impact to the [[groin]] (pubis), a common motorcycling accident injury. In this kind of injury, the left and right halves of the pelvis are separated at front and rear, the front opening more than the rear, i.e. like an open book that falls to the ground and splits in the middle. Depending on the severity, this may require surgical reconstruction before rehabilitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Anteroposterior Compression Fracture of Pelvis (Open Book Fracture)|url=http://www.netterimages.com/image/344.htm|publisher=Elsevier: Netter's Images}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Forces from an anterior or posterior direction, like head-on car accidents, usually cause external rotation of the hemipelvis, an “open-book” injury. Open fractures have increased risk of infection and hemorrhaging from vessel injury, leading to higher mortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rothenberger|first=D|author2=Velasco, R |author3=Strate, R |author4=Fischer, RP |author5= Perry JF, Jr |title=Open pelvic fracture: a lethal injury.|journal=The Journal of Trauma|date=March 1978|volume=18|issue=3|pages=184–7|pmid=642044|doi=10.1097/00005373-197803000-00006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==
If a person is fully awake and has no pain of the pelvis medical imaging of the pelvis is not needed.&lt;ref name=ATLS2018/&gt;

==Prevention==
As the human body ages, the bones become more weak and [[brittle]] and are therefore more susceptible to [[fractures]]. Certain precautions are crucial in order to lower the risk of getting pelvic fractures. The most damaging is one from a car accident, cycling accident, or falling from a high building which can result in a high energy injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=High Energy Fractures|url=http://www.fractures.com/trauma.html|publisher=International Society for Fracture Repair|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130127081443/http://www.fractures.com/trauma.html|archivedate=2013-01-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This can be very dangerous because the [[pelvis]] supports many internal organs and can damage these organs. Falling is one of the most common causes of a pelvic fracture. Therefore, proper precautions should be taken to prevent this from happening.

==Treatment==
[[File:PelvicBinding.webm|thumb|upright=1.3|An example of pelvic binding using a sheet and cable ties]]
A pelvic fracture is often complicated and treatment can be a long and painful process. Depending on the severity, pelvic fractures can be treated with or without surgery.

===Initial===

A high index of suspicion should be held for pelvic injuries in any one with major trauma. The pelvis should be stabilized with a [[pelvic binder]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Ideal Pelvic Binder |url=http://www.trauma.org/index.php/main/article/657/ |website=www.trauma.org |accessdate=5 June 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be a purpose made device, but improvised pelvic binders have also been used around the world to good effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Mallinson, T | title=Alternative improvised pelvic binder. | journal=African Journal of Emergency Medicine | year= 2013 | volume= 3 | issue= 4 | pages= 195–6 | pmid=| doi=10.1016/j.afjem.2013.04.006 | pmc= | url=http://www.afjem.org/article/S2211-419X(13)00071-2/pdf  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stabilisation of the pelvic ring reduces blood loss from the pelvic vessels and reduced the risk of death.

===Surgery===

Surgery is often required for pelvic fractures. Many methods of pelvic stabilization are used including [[external fixation]] or [[internal fixation]] and [[Traction (orthopedics)|traction]].&lt;ref name="pmid19858983"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Mirghasemi A, Mohamadi A, Ara AM, Gabaran NR, Sadat MM | title=Completely displaced S-1/S-2 growth plate fracture in an adolescent: case report and review of literature. | journal=J Orthop Trauma | year= 2009 | volume= 23 | issue= 10 | pages= 734–8 | doi=10.1097/BOT.0b013e3181a23d8b | pmc= | pmid=19858983  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Taguchi|first=T|author2=Kawai, S |author3=Kaneko, K |author4= Yugue, D |title=Operative management of displaced fractures of the sacrum.|journal=Journal of Orthopaedic Science|year=1999|volume=4|issue=5|pages=347–52|pmid=10542038|doi=10.1007/s007760050115}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are often other injuries associated with a pelvic fracture so the type of surgery involved must be thoroughly planned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hancharenka|first=V.|author2=Tuzikov, A. |author3=Arkhipau, V. |author4= Kryvanos, A. |title=Preoperative planning of pelvic and lower limbs surgery by CT image processing|journal=Pattern Recognition and Image Analysis|date=March 2009|volume=19|issue=1|pages=109–113|doi=10.1134/S1054661809010209}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rehabilitation===

Pelvic fractures that are treatable without surgery are treated with bed rest. Once the fracture has healed enough, rehabilitation can be started with first standing upright with the help of a [[physical therapist]], followed by starting to walk using a [[Walker (mobility)|walker]] and eventually progressing to a [[Assistive cane|cane]].

==Prognosis==
Mortality rates in people with pelvic fractures are between 10 and 16 percent.&lt;ref name=Vincent /&gt; However, death is typically due to associated trauma affecting other organs, such as the brain.  Death rates due to complications directly related to pelvic fractures, such as bleeding, are relatively low.&lt;ref name=Vincent /&gt;

==Epidemiology==
About 10 percent of people that seek treatment at a [[level 1 trauma center]] after a blunt force injury have a pelvic fracture.&lt;ref name=Vincent&gt;{{cite book|last=Vincent|first=Jean-Louis|title=Textbook of Critical Care.|publisher=Elsevier/Saunders|location=Philadelphia, PA|isbn=9781437713671|page=1523|edition=6th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Motorcycle injuries are the most common cause of pelvic fractures, followed by injuries to pedestrians caused by motor vehicles, large falls (over 15 feet), and motor vehicle crashes.&lt;ref name=Vincent /&gt;

'''Performance-Based Building Design''' is an approach to the [[design]] of any complexity of building, from single-detached homes up to and including high-rise apartments and office buildings.  A building constructed in this way is required to meet certain measurable or predictable performance requirements, such as energy efficiency or seismic load, without a specific prescribed method by which to attain those requirements.  This is in contrast to traditional prescribed [[building codes]], which mandate specific [[construction]] practises, such as stud size and distance between studs in [[framing (construction)|wooden frame construction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hsh.k12.nf.ca/technology/cmhc/english/book/appendix/table20/index.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-06-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150504062800/http://www.hsh.k12.nf.ca/technology/cmhc/english/book/appendix/table20/index.htm |archivedate=2015-05-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Such an approach provides the freedom to develop tools and methods to evaluate the entire life cycle of the building process, from the business dealings, to [[procurement]], through construction and the evaluation of results.

==Background==
One of the first implementations of performance-based building design requirements was in [[Hammurabi's Code]] (c. 1795 to 1750 BC), where is stated that “a house should not collapse and kill anybody”. This concept is also described in [[Vitruvius]]’s ''“De architectura libri decem”'' (“[[The ten books of architecture|The Ten Books of Architecture]]”) in first century BC.In modern times, the first definition of performance-based building design was introduced in 1965 in France by Blachère with the Agrément system &lt;ref&gt;http://www.cstb.fr/CSTB{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this, the building process remained relatively conventional for the next 50 years, based solely on experience and codes, regulations prescribed by [[law]] which stifled [[innovation]]s and change.  The prescription approach is a technical procedure based on past experience which consists of comparing the proposed design with standardized codes, so no [[simulation]] or [[Verification and validation|verification]] tools are needed for the design and building process.

A new approach began to emerge during the second half of the 20th century, when many local building markets began to show that they needed greater flexibility in the procurement procedures to facilitate the exchange of building goods between countries and to improve the speed of procedures and innovations in the building process.  This innovative approach to the procurement, design, contracting, management and maintenance of buildings was '''performance-based building''' (PBBD).

Most recently the clearest definition of performance based building approach was explained in 1982 by the CIB W60 Commission in the report n.64, where Gibson stated that ''“first and foremost, the performance approach is [...]  the practice of thinking and working in terms of ends rather than means.[ …] It is concerned with what a building or building product is required to do, and not with prescribing how it is to be constructed”.''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cibworld.nl&lt;/ref&gt;

Many research establishments have studied the implementation of PBBD during the last fifty years.&lt;ref&gt;Foster 1972&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ASTM/CIB/RILEM 1982&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;CSTB 1988&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Davis and Ventre 1990&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Becker and Paciuk 1996&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;CIB 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Huovila 2005&lt;/ref&gt;  A majority of areas of building design remain open to innovation.

During 1998-2001, the CIB Board and Programme Committee initiated the Proactive Programme on Performance-Based Building&lt;ref&gt;Foliente et al. 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Foliente 1998&lt;/ref&gt; in order to practically implement technical developments of performance-based building. This programme was followed by the establishment of the Performance-Based Building &lt;ref&gt;http://www.pebbu.nl&lt;/ref&gt; '''(PeBBu)''', running from October 2001 to October 2005, thanks to funds from the European Commission (EC) [[Fifth Framework Programme]].

The PeBBu Network had a broad and varied programme, a set of activities and produced many papers to aid in the implementation of such vision.

==PeBBu Thematic Network==
PeBBu Thematic Network was managed by the CIB General Secretariat (International Council for Research and Innovation in Building Construction), particularly by the CIB Development Foundation (CIBdf). The PeBBu Network started working in 2001 and completed in 2005.  In the PeBBu Network 73 organisations, included CIBdf (coordinating contractor), BBRI (Belgium), VTT (Finland), CSTB (France), EGM (Netherlands), TNO (Netherlands), BRE (UK), cooperated to this project bringing people together to share their work, their information and knowledge. The objectives of the Network was to stimulate and facilitate international dissemination and implementation of Performance Based Building in building and construction sector, maximising the contribution to this by the international Research and Development community.
The PeBBu Thematic Network result is described and explained in 26 final reports which included three reports with an overall PBB scope, a multitude of research reports from the PeBBu Domains, User Platforms and Regional Platforms, a Final Management report and four practice reports for providing practical support to the actual application of PBB concept in building and [[construction]] sector.

==PBB: Conceptual framework==
A conceptual framework for implementing a PBB market was identified while reviewing various viewpoints during the compilation of the 2nd International State of the Art Report for the PeBBu Thematic Network (Becker and Foliente 2005).
The building facility is a multi-component system with a generally very long life cycle. The system’s design agenda as a whole, and the more specific design objectives of its parts, originate from relevant user requirements. These requirements evolve into a comprehensive set of Performance Requirements that should be established by a large number of [[stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]] (the users, entrepreneur/owner, regulatory framework, design team, and manufacturers).
The main steps in a Performance Based Building Design process are
*# identifying and formulating the relevant User Requirements,
*# transforming the User Requirements identified into Performance Requirements and quantitative performance criteria,
*# using reliable design and evaluation tools to assess whether proposed solutions meet the stated criteria at a satisfactory level.

===Performance concept===
In a Performance-based approach, the focus of all decisions, is on the required performance-in-use and on the evaluations and testing of building asset.
Performance Based Building (PBB) is focused on performance required in use for the business processes and the needs of the users, and then on the evaluations and verification of building assets result. The Performance approach can be used whether the process is about an existing or new assets. It is applicable to the procurement of constructed assets and to any phase of the whole life cycle Building Process, such as [[strategic planning]], [[asset management]], briefing/programming, design and construction, operation and maintenance, management and use, renovations and alterations, codes, regulations and standards.
It includes many topics and criteria, which can be categorized as physical, functional, environmental, financial, economical, psychological, social, facilities, and other more. These criteria are related to singular project, according to the context
and the situation.

===Two key characterisics of performance concept===
Performance concept is based on two key characteristics :
* '''the use of two languages''', one for the clients/users requirements and the other for the supply of the performance;
* '''the need for validation and verification of results''' against performance targets.

====Two languages====
The Performance concept requires two languages: the language of demand requirements and the language of the required performance which should have a capability to fulfill the demand. It is important to recognize that these languages are different.
Szigeti and Davis (Performance Based Building: Conceptual Framework, 2005) explain that  ''“the dialog between client and supplier can be described as two halves of a “hamburger bun”, with the statement of the requirement in functional or performance language (FC - functional concept) matched to a solution (SC - solution concept) in more technical language, and the matching, verification / validation that needs to occur in between”.'' 
    
In a recent paper Ang, Groosman, and Scholten (2005) explain that the functional concept represents the set of unquantified objectives and scopes to be satisfied by the supply solutions, related to performance requirements. The solution concept represents technical realization that satisfies at least the required performance. Design decision is a development of a solution concept.

====Assessing result – match and compare====
Building performance evaluation is the process of systematically comparing  and matching the performance in use of building assets with explicitly documented or implicitly criteria for their expected performance. In the PBB approach is essential matching and comparing demand and supply.  It can be done by using a [[Verification and validation|validation]] method, by measurement, calculation, or testing. Tools and methods are used to permit some form of measurement of testing of the requirements, and the relating measurement of the capability of assets to perform.

There are many types of in-depth specialized technical evaluations and audits. These validations generally require time, a major effort by the customer group, and a high level of funding. Normally, the most valuable methods and tools are comprehensive scans which are performance based and include metrics that can easily be measured without lab-type instruments.
Evaluations and reviews, are integral  part of asset and portfolio management, design, construction, commissioning.
Evaluations can be used for different purposes, depending on the requirements being considered, for example they could be used in support of funding decisions, they could include a condition assessment to ensure that the level of degradation or the obsolescence is known, they could include an assessment of the utilization or  an assessment of the capability of the product result to perform functional expected requirements. Such evaluations can be used at any time during the life cycle of the asset.
PBB evaluations should be done in a routine manner, really the evaluations are often done only as part of Commissioning or shortly thereafter, or when there is a problem.

There are two different kinds of performance verifications. Performance evaluations  rate
the physical asset according to a set of existing criteria and indicators of capability, and match the results against the required levels of performance. The Occupant Satisfaction Surveys record the perceptions of the users, usually through a scale of satisfaction measurements. Both types of evaluations complement each other.
* '''Tools'''
Innovative decision-support methodologies are taking place in building sector. There are some tools explicitly based on the demand and supply concepts and other ones which employ standardized performance metrics that for the first time link facility
condition to the functional requirements of organizations and their customers. Projects can be planned, prioritize, and budgeted using a multi-criteria approach, that is transparent, comprehensive and auditable.
One of the methodologies that can be used is a '''gap analysis''' based on calibrated scales that measure both the levels of requirements and the capability of the asset that is either already used, or being designed, or offer to be bought, or leased. Such methodology is an ASTM and American National (ANSI) standard and is currently being considered as an ISO standard.
It is particularly useful when the information about the “gap”, if any, can be presented in support of funding decisions and actions.

There are a large number of  verification methodologies, (e.g. POEs, CRE-FM), and all of these need to refer back to explicit statements of requirements to be able to compare with expected performance.
To evaluate the result of a building asset against the expected performance requirements it is necessary to fix some tools used during the process.  These tools are the reference of whole life cycle building process, so organizations use '''‘key performance indicators (KPI)’'''  to prove that they are meeting the targets that have been set by senior management. At the same time performance measurement (PM) becomes central to managing organizations, their operations and logistic support.
These methodologies include the feedback loop that links a facility in use to the requirements and capabilities that are compared and matched whenever decisions are needed.

===Performance approach and prescriptive approach===
A prescriptive approach describes the way a building asset must be constructed, rather than the end result of the building process, and is related to the type and quality of materials used, the method of construction, and the workmanship, etc.
This type of approach is strictly mandated by a combination of law, codes, standards, and regulations, etc., and is based on past experience and consolidated know-how. The content of prescriptive codes and standards is usually a consequence of an accident causing injury or death which requires a remedy to avoid a repeat, as a consequence of some hazardous situation, or as a consequence of some recognized social need. In many countries, in both the public and private sector, research is taking place into a different set of codes, methods and tools based on performance criteria to complement the traditional prescriptive codes.
In the 1970s, this search produced the '''“Nordic Model”''' (NKB 1978), which constituted the reference model of  next performance-based codes. This model links easily to one of the key characteristics of the Performance approach, the dialog between the WHY, the WHAT and the HOW.

Using a Performance Based approach does not preclude the use of prescriptive specifications. Although the benefits of the adopting of a PBBD approach are significant, it is recognized that employing a performance-based approach at any stage in the building process is more complex and expensive than using the simpler prescriptive route. So, the application of this approach should not be regarded as an end in itself. When simple building are concerned or well proven technologies are used, the use of prescriptive codes results more effective, efficient, faster, or less costly, so prescriptive specifications will continue to be useful in many situations.

At the same time for the complex projects use of the performance based route at every stage is indispensable, in particular during design and evaluation phases.

It is not likely that a facility will be planned, procured, delivered, maintained, used and renovated using solely Performance Based documents at each step of the way, down the supply chain, to the procurement of products and materials, because there is not yet enough experience with the Performance Based Building approach. At the same time the prescriptive approach can bring to stifle changes and innovations, so best way to set building process is blending both different approaches.

==Statements of Requirements (SoR)==
The Statements of Requirements represents a reference for the whole life cycle management of facilities, they are the core of the conceptual framework came up from the PeBBu Thematic Network. They constitute the key to implementation of the PBB in the construction sector.

The SoRs is a document prepared by clients, or in the verbal statements communicated to supplies, it is based on the user functional needs. These user requirements are converted into performance requirements, which can be explicit or implicit. Such document should include information about what is essential to the client. SoRs will take different forms depending on the kind of client and what is being procured, at what phase of the Life Cycle or where in the supply chain a document is being used.
The SoRs should be, dynamic, not static, and should include more and more details as projects proceed. This document should be prepared at different levels of granularity, how detailed the documentation is at each stage depends on the complexity of the project and on the procurement route chosen for the project.

The SoRs represent a very important part of a continuous process of communication between clients (demand) and their project team (supply), they will be updated and managed using computerized tools and will contain all requirements throughout the life of the facility. This process is called “briefing” in UK and Commonwealth English, and “programming” in American English. An SoR is normally prepared for any project, whether it is a PBB project or not. Assembling such a document usually leads to a more appropriate match between the needs of clients and users and the constructed assets.
Statements of Requirements have to be very carefully stated so that it is easy to verify that a proposed solution can meet those requirements.

High level statement of requirements need to be paired with indicators of capability so design solutions can be evaluated before they are built in order to avoid mistakes. In the SoRs it is important to take into account some design aspect like flexibility indicators because constructed assets need for change during their life cycle, uses and activities can change very rapidly, so it is essential to test different solutions way that the spaces might be used according to anticipate changes.
SoRs, as understood in ISO 9000, include not only what the client requires and is prepared to pay for, but also the process and indicators that will provide the means to verify, and validate, that the product or service delivered meets those stated requirements.

As part of the worldwide movement to implement a PBB approach and to develop tools that will make it easier to shift to PBB, the [http://www.iai-tech.org International Alliance for Interoperability (IAI)] set up projects to map the processes that are part of Whole Life Cycle Management as ''Portfolio and Asset Management: Performance (PAMPeR) and Early Design” (ED).''
The IAI efforts are complemented by many other efforts to create standards for the information to be captured and analyzed to verify performance-in-use.

==Performance requirements (PR)==
Performance requirements translate user requirements in more precise quantitative measurable and technical terms, usually for a specific purpose.

Supply team prepares a document that includes, objectives and goals, performance requirements and criteria. It is important to include “indicators of performance” in the way that it can be measured the results against explicit requirements, whether qualitative or quantitative. Performance indicators need to be easily understood by the users and the evaluators. To validate the indicators and verify that required performance-in-use has been achieved it is necessary using appropriate methods and tools.
Levels of performance requirements can be stated as part of the preparation of SoRs, as part of project programs, or as part of requests for proposals and procurement contracts.
It is preferable adopting a flexible approach to the expression and comparison of performance levels, so required and achieved performance can be expressed not as single values but as bands between upper and lower limits. In consequence, in performance terms the criteria can be expressed as graduated scales, divided into broad bands.

==Performance based codes==
In the building and construction industry, until 25–30 years old, prescriptive codes, regulations and standards  made innovation and change difficult and costly to implement, and created technical restrictions to trade. These concerns have been the major drivers towards the use of a Performance Based approach to codes, regulations and standards. Performance-based building regulations have been implemented or are being developed in many countries but they have not yet reached their full potential. In part, this can be attributed to the fact that the overall regulatory system has not yet been fully addressed, and gaps exist in several key areas.
Bringing the regulatory and non-regulatory models together is probably the best way to work. This is shown in the '''“Total Performance System Models”''' diagram (Meacham, et al. 2002), that maps the flow of decision making from society and business objectives to construction solutions.

The difference between the regulatory and non-regulatory parts of the Total Performance System Models is that the first one is mandated by codes and regulations based on the law, while those other functional requirements, included in Statements of Requirements, are an integral part of what the client requires and is willing to pay for.
* '''Consequences relating to procedure'''
For procurements in the public sector and for publicly traded corporations, it’s important that the decisions and choices are transparent and explicit, regardless of the specific procurement route. All procurement processes can be either Prescriptive or Performance Based. Design-Build, Public Private Partnerships (PPP), [[private finance initiative]] (PFI) and similar procurement procedures are particularly suited to the use of a strong Performance Based Building application. If the expected performance are not stated explicitly and verifiably then these procurement methods will likely be more subject to disappointments and legal problems.
To get the benefits from these procurement approaches, it is essential to organize the services of the supply chain in order to get innovative, less costly, or better solutions by shifting decisions about “how” to the integrated team.

==Future scenarios==
Although the effort of a large number of research establishments in order to implement and diffuse the PBBD approach, it is difficult to innovate the practice of working and thinking in building sector. The positive trend is that more and more interest in this approach is happening around the world. Many countries tried to reform the way that building and construction is regulated and managed.

The core of implementation of PBB approach is that the clients, the users really know and understand why and what they require and that they can state easily and clearly their SoRs document. It is also important that the client is active, involved, informed and able to understand and choose best way for its interest, whether he’s a private or a public client, a big or a little structure, whether the  asset is for its own use or for use by others.

Procurement will be the key to improve performance approach when clients learn to be more explicit in their demands and to participate more aggressively in the management and delivery process of their most significant investment and resource.

'''Petre Melikishvili''' ({{lang-ka|პეტრე მელიქიშვილი}}) (1850–1927) was a [[Georgian people|Georgian]] chemist. He was the co-founder of [[Tbilisi State University]] (TSU) and the first Rector of TSU. 
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Petre Melikishvili.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Petre Melikishvili, First Rector of the TSU|{{deletable image-caption|1=Sunday, 4 October 2009}}]] --&gt;

== Biography ==
In 1868 he finished [[Tbilisi First Gymnasium]] and in 1872 [[Odessa University|Novorossiya University]], faculty of Physics and mathematics, department of Natural Sciences. In 1873 he is abroad were he acquainted ''L.Mayer's'' and ''Vilicenuce's'' laboratories. In 1876 he started working in the chemical laboratory of Novorossiya University. In 1881 he became Magister of the chemistry and in 1885 he became Doctor of the Chemistry.  In 1884 he was a docent and from 1885 until 1917 he was Professor of Novorrossiya University.

== Works ==
His works in [[Organic Chemistry]] developed [[Stereochemical Theory]]. Melikishvili discovered one of the class of organic [[Chemical compound|compounds]] [[Glycidacids]] (named by him). The second cycle of his works are about [[Inorganic Chemistry]]. Melikishvili with his pupil L. Pizarjevski synthesized superacids of some elements (''U, Nb, Ta, W, Mo, B, Ti, V'') (1897–1913). they also showed that from many supposed formulas of [[Hydrogen Peroxide]] the correct is ''H-O-O-H''.

== In Tbilisi State University ==
Melikishvili has a big merit in creation of [[Georgian Chemical Terminology]]. He founded four chemical laboratories and departments of Inorganic, Organic and [[Agronomic Chemistry]] in TSU.

The igneous rocks are formed when molten lava from a volcano cools down. These rocks are also known as primary rocks as they are the first to be formed and are further of two types: extrusive and intrusive." https://www.learnnext.com/nextgurukul/wiki/concept/CBSE/VII/Geography/Rocks-and-Minerals.htm&lt;/ref&gt; containing no organic remains, such as [[granite]], [[gneiss]] and [[schist]] as well as [[igneous]] and [[magmatic]] formations from all ages. Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary published in 1913&lt;ref&gt;Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary, published 1913 by C. &amp; G. Merriam Co. Cited in: http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Primary+rocks&lt;/ref&gt; provides the following term as used in geology:
{{Quote
 |quote = Primary rocks
(geol.) a term early used for rocks supposed to have been first formed, being crystalline and containing no organic remains, as granite, gneiss, etc.; - called also primitive rocks. The terms Secondary, Tertiary, and Quaternary rocks have also been used in like manner, but of these the last two only are now in use.
 |source = Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary - 1913}}
Ninety years later the McGraw-Hill Dictionary of Scientific &amp; Technical Terms published in 2003&lt;ref&gt;McGraw-Hill Dictionary of Scientific &amp; Technical Terms, 6E, Copyright © 2003 by The McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc. Cited in: http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Primary+rocks&lt;/ref&gt; places the term in the geologic field of [[petrology]]:
{{Quote
 |quote = Primary rocks [′prī‚mer·ē ′räks]
(petrology) Rocks whose constituents are newly formed particles that have never been constituents of previously formed rocks and that are not the products of alteration or replacement, such as limestones formed by precipitation from solution.
 |source = McGraw-Hill Doctionary of Scientific &amp; Technical Terms - 2003}}
The term dates from the late 18th century (see [[Giovanni Arduino (geologist)|Giovanni Arduino]] and [[Abraham Gottlob Werner]]) when the first attempts to formulate a [[geologic time scale]] divided crustal rocks into four types: Primary, Secondary, [[Tertiary (geology)|Tertiary]], and [[Quaternary (geology)|Quaternary]]. Darwin used the phrase "primary rocks" in 1838 in the Geological Introduction to Zoology of The Voyage of HMS Beagle Fossil Mammalia Described by Richard Owen The last two terms have survived on most geological time scales used in the 20th and 21st centuries. For an example of the extensive use and explication of this term as debated in the mid-18th century, see "On the Origin of Eruptive and Primary Rocks" by Thomas Macfarlane and published in three parts in The Canadian Naturalist and Geologist Journal of 1863.&lt;ref&gt;"On the Origin of Eruptive and Primary Rocks", Thomas Macfarlane: Part 1 p. 295 XXIII, Part 2 p. 329 XXV, Part 3 p. 457 XXXI.&lt;/ref&gt; And for an example in Australian geology literature, where it is capitalized to stress the unique use of the word, see "Report on Country in the Neighborhood of Lake Eyre" by H.Y.L. Brown, Government Geologist, published in 1892.&lt;ref&gt;"Report on Country in the Neighborhood of Lake Eyre", H.Y.L. Brown; Bristow (1892): p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;
Primary rock is also referred to as primitive rock,&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl Friedrich Naumann|Naumann, C.F.]]; ''Lehrbuch der Geognosie'' (2 vols. and atlas, 1849-1854, ed. 2, 1858-1872): https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/009800307&lt;/ref&gt; [[pluton]]ic rock, and the crystalline [[Basement (geology)|basement]] rock of the Earth’s continental [[craton]]s.  It is also loosely, and less precisely, referred to as [[bedrock]], especially in civil engineering, geophysical surveys and drilling science.

The Austrian-American astrophysicist [[Thomas Gold]] utilized this term in his book "The Deep Hot Biosphere"&lt;ref&gt;Gold, Thomas; The Deep Hot Biosphere; Springer Verlag New York Inc. (1999): p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; in the chapter titled "The Siljan Experiment" regarding the deep drilling project in Sweden to prove the [[Abiogenic petroleum origin|theory of abiotic/abiogenic oil and gas]]: "...the ground of Sweden, composed almost entirely of primary rock and not of sediments...."

Primary rocks are the source of [[primary minerals]] and [[primary water]].

A '''Schmidt corrector plate''' is an [[aspheric lens]] which is designed to correct the [[spherical aberration]] in the [[Spherical reflector|spherical primary mirror]] it is combined with. It was invented by [[Bernhard Schmidt]] in 1931,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; although it may have been independently invented by Finnish astronomer [[Yrjö Väisälä]] in 1924 (sometimes called the [[Schmidt-Väisälä camera]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telescope-optics.net/Schmidt-camera.htm telescopeѲptics.net, 10.2.2. - Full-aperture Schmidt corrector: Schmidt camera]&lt;/ref&gt; Schmidt originally designed it as part of a wide-field photographic [[catadioptric telescope]], the [[Schmidt camera]], and is also used in other telescope designs, camera lenses and image projection systems.

==Function==
[[File:Aberration de sphéricité d'un miroir sphérique concave.svg|thumb|left]]
[[File:Correction par lame asphérique de Schmidt.svg|thumb|left|Example of an optical system using just a spherical mirror (''top'') and a spherical mirror combined with a Schmidt corrector plate (''bottom'').]]
Schmidt corrector plates work because they are aspheric lenses with spherical aberration that is equal to but opposite of the spherical primary mirrors they are placed in front of. They are placed at the center of curvature "'''C'''" of the mirrors for a pure [[Schmidt camera]] and just behind the prime focus for a [[Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope|Schmidt-Cassegrain]]. The Schmidt corrector is thicker in the middle and the edge. This corrects the light paths so light reflected from the outer part of the mirror and light reflected from the inner portion of the mirror is brought to the same common focus "'''F'''". The Schmidt corrector only corrects for spherical aberration. It does not change the focal length of the system.

==Manufacture==
Schmidt corrector plates can be manufactured in many ways. The most basic method, called the "classical approach",&lt;ref name="freepatentsonline.com"&gt;[http://www.freepatentsonline.com/3837124.html METHOD FOR MAKING REPLICA CONTOUR BLOCK MASTERS FOR PRODUCING SCHMIDT CORRECTOR PLATES, United States Patent 3837124]&lt;/ref&gt; involves directly [[figuring]] the corrector by grinding and polishing the aspherical shape into a flat glass blank using specially shaped and sized tools. This method requires a high degree of skill and training on the part of the [[optical engineer]] creating the corrector.&lt;ref name="freepatentsonline.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DWL"&gt;[http://uncle-rods.blogspot.com/2010/02/down-with-love.html Rod Mollise, Down with Love, uncle-rods.blogspot.com, Sunday, February 21, 2010]&lt;/ref&gt;

Schmidt himself worked out a second, more elegant, scheme for producing the complex figure needed for the correcting plate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Hodges | first = Paul C. | title = Bernhard Schmidt and his Reflector Camera | journal = The American Journal of Roentgenology and Radium Therapy | volume = 59 | pages =  | date = January 1948 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A thin glass disk with a perfectly polished accurate flat form was placed on a heavy metal pan. The upper edge of the pan was ground at a precise angle or [[bevel]] based on the [[Elasticity Coefficient|coefficient of elasticity]] of the particular type of glass plate that was being used.  The glass plate was sealed to the ground edge of the pan, then a [[vacuum pump]] was used to exhaust the air until a particular negative pressure had been achieved. This caused the glass plate to warp slightly. The exposed side was then ground and polished to a perfect flat. When the vacuum was released, the plate sprang back until its bottom surface was again plane, while the upper surface had the correct figure. Schmidt's vacuum figuring method is rarely used today. The glass plate will usually break if bent enough to generate a curve for telescopes of [[focal ratio]] f/2.5 or faster.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Everhart | first = Edgar | title = Making Corrector Plates by Schmidt's Vacuum Method | journal = Applied Optics | volume = 5 | pages = 713–715 | date = May 1966 |bibcode = 1966ApOpt...5..713E |doi = 10.1364/AO.5.000713 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   Also, for fast focal ratios, the curve obtained is not sufficiently exact and requires additional hand correction.

A third method, invented in 1970 for [[Celestron]] by Tom Johnson and John O'rourke,&lt;ref name="freepatentsonline.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.universetoday.com/guide-to-space/telescopes/celestron-telescope/ Tammy Plotner, universetoday.com, Celestron Telescope]&lt;/ref&gt; uses a vacuum pan with the correct shape of the curve pre-shaped into the bottom of the pan, called a "master block". This removes the need to have to hold a shape by applying an exact vacuum and allows for the mass production of corrector plates of the same exact shape.&lt;ref name="DWL"/&gt;

The technical difficulties associated with the production of Schmidt corrector plates led some designers, such as [[Dmitri Dmitrievich Maksutov]] and [[Albert Bouwers]], to come up with alternative designs using more conventional [[Meniscus corrector]] lenses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.weasner.com/etx/guests/mak/MAKSTO.HTM John F. Gills, Ph.D, From James Gregory to John Gregory - The 300 Year Evolution of the Maksutov-Cassegrain Telescope]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Science for the People''' ('''SftP''') is a [[Left wing politics|left-wing]] socialist organization that emerged from the [[Peace movement|antiwar culture]] of the [[United States]] in the late 1960s. Since 2014 it has experienced a revival focusing primarily on the dual nature of science.  The organization advocates for a scientific establishment that is not isolated from society, rather one that uses scientific discoveries to advocate for and advance social justice and critically approach science as a social endeavor&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://scienceforthepeople.org/index.php/2018/04/12/dual-nature-of-science/|title=The Dual Nature of Science – Science for the People|website=scienceforthepeople.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== History ==
The original group was composed of [[professor]]s, students, workers, and other concerned citizens who sought to end potential oppression brought on by [[pseudoscience]], or by what it considered the misuse of science. SftP generated much [[controversy]] in the 1970s for the radical tactics of some of its members. Over the initial few years there was an emergence of multiple differing opinions about the nature and mission of SftP should be. A faction wanted SftP to pay special attention to scientific issues that support class struggle. Another wanted to develop "a science for the people." The majority, however, wanted to be the scientific community's critical conscience and expose, from within, the dangers of the misuse of science. After a bitter internal struggle and departure of many, the group that remained focused its efforts, primarily through its magazine, on criticism of scientific misuse. During this time it became identified with prominent academic scientists such as [[Stephen Jay Gould]] and [[Richard Lewontin]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scienceforthepeople.com/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=21|title=Greetings from the past :: Science for the People :: Science for the People|date=2007-09-28|access-date=2018-04-14|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928192107/http://www.scienceforthepeople.com/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=21|archivedate=2007-09-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Relationship with the scientific establishment ==
In the first five years SftP became known in the US scientific community for its attempts at disrupting the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] (AAAS). SftP members considered the AAAS, the world’s largest association of scientists, aligned with the government and the ruling elite. SftP particularly decried what it considered AAAS' complicity in war, sexism, racism and capitalism. A specific focus of the activists was the scientific community's involvement in the Vietnam war. Some of the tactics use to disrupt the AAAS meetings were picketing, demonstrations, impromptu speeches and confrontational interruptions.&lt;ref name="worldcat.org"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1015275127|title=Science for the people : documents from America's movement of radical scientists|others=Schmalzer, Sigrid,, Chard, Daniel S.,, Botelho, Alyssa,|isbn=9781625343185|location=Amherst|oclc=1015275127}}&lt;/ref&gt; These actions led to the arrest of several SftP activists in the early 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://science-for-the-people.org/resources/fbi/fbi_aaas-arrests-names_1973-jan-3.pdf|title=http://science-for-the-people.org/resources/fbi/fbi_aaas-arrests-names_1973-jan-3.pdf|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the formation of SftP and its radical activism against the scientific establishment similar attempts had taken place with other organizations. One notable example is [[University of California, Berkeley]] nuclear physicist Charles Schwartz's 1967 attempt to amend the [[American Physical Society]]'s (APS) constitution to allow 1% of members to call for a vote on any social or scientific issue. His motion was defeated because APS members did not think the society should take a stance on social issues. Another instance is the petition physicists began to the APS not to hold its 1970 meeting [[Chicago]] because of the police brutality at the [[1968 Democratic National Convention|Democratic National Convention]] in 1968. The APS Council polled members and upheld its decision to keep the meeting in Chicago.&lt;ref name="Consciousness Raising"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.aps.org/publications/apsnews/200001/knowledge.cfm|title=Consciousness Raising|language=en|access-date=2018-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1971 a proposed amendment to change the APS's mission statement to include the phrase "The Society...shall shun those activities which are judged to contribute harmfully to the welfare of mankind." was defeated&lt;ref name="Consciousness Raising"/&gt;.

In following years, thanks to the actions of dedicated activists such as Schwartz and [[Martin Lewis Perl|Martin Perl]] and others, APS took certain steps towards social responsibility. These included the 1972 creation of the Committee on the Status of Women in Physics&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aps.org/about/governance/committees/cswp/index.cfm Committee on the Status of Women in Physics]&lt;/ref&gt; the 1979 boycott of states that had not ratified the [[Equal Rights Amendment]] (ERA) and the 1983 Arms Control Resolution.&lt;ref name="Consciousness Raising"/&gt; The latter was strongly criticized by [[George A. Keyworth II|George Keyworth]], science advisor to president [[Ronald Reagan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sciencepolicy.colorado.edu/admin/publication_files/resource-2719-2009.05.pdf|title=Science Policy Colorado University May 2009|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Positions and Views ==

=== Anti-militarism ===
[[File:39080024065598_001_resized.jpg|thumb|Statement by MIT scientists about the anti-war protest walkout on March 4, 1969]]

From its inception in January 1969 SftP opposed the involvement of scientists in the military. SftP also challenged the established notion that organizations such as [[American Association for the Advancement of Science|the American Association for the Advancement of Science]] (AAAS) and the [[American Physical Society]] (APS) can stay neutral vis a vis the [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] war. Early on, a number of SftP scientists mobilized against US Congress' [[Anti-ballistic missile|Anti-Ballistic Missile]] (ABM) Program, arguing that the ABM was not feasible and the funds would be better spent on basic scientific research.&lt;ref name="worldcat.org"/&gt; On March 4, 1969 [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] scientists staged a mass walkout in protest of the ABM.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://libguides.mit.edu/c.php?g=633358&amp;p=4430869|title=LibGuides: March 4: Scientists, Students, and Society: Archival Collections|last=Suiter|first=Greta|website=libguides.mit.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1969, Scientists and Engineers for Social and Political Action (SESPA), SftP's predecessor, held an orderly march of 250 physicists to the White House to protest the ABM.&lt;ref name="Consciousness Raising"/&gt;

This type of activism among scientists in the US led to the [[Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty|anti-ABM treaty]] of 1972 with the [[Soviet Union]]. In the 1980s SftP opposed president Reagan's attempt to revive the arms race with the Soviet Union as well as the US involvement in [[Nicaraguan Revolution|Nicaragua]]&lt;ref name="worldcat.org" /&gt;.

=== Position on nuclear energy ===

In the mid-70s SftP cautioned against the ways that nuclear power was being promoted as a safe and environmentally clean alternative to coal.&lt;ref name="worldcat.org" /&gt; In May of 1976 the organization published a pamphlet arguing that the push for nuclear energy in the US over solar and other cleaner, cheaper alternatives benefitted the Atomic-Industrial complex and not the general public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://science-for-the-people.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/SftPv8n3s.pdf|title=SfrP May 1976 Issue|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s, especially in the wake of such disasters as [[Three Mile Island accident|Three Mile Island]], SftP questioned the environmental safety of nuclear energy and the toxic waste it produces.&lt;ref&gt;Cina C and T Goldfarb, Three Mile Island and Nuclear Power. Science for the People 1979;11(4):10-17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brown L|first=Allen D|date=|title=Toxic Waste and Citizen Action|url=http://science-for-the-people.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/SftPv15n4s.pdf|journal=Science for the People|volume=15|pages=6-13|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Views on technology ===
Throughout the 1970s and 1980s SftP considered technology an important outcome of scientific advancement.&lt;ref name="worldcat.org" /&gt; The organization favored the more concrete nature of technological developments over purely intellectual exercise of theoretical science.&lt;ref name="worldcat.org" /&gt; Key to the group’s support for technology was the conviction that it should neither replace humans in the workplace nor harm the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://science-for-the-people.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/SftPv7n6s.pdf|title=New Robotics|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; SftP members advocated for research and development programs to be chosen based on equity and social need and not to meet the government's needs of economic and military security.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dickson|first=David|date=|title=Choosing Technology|url=http://science-for-the-people.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/SftPv19n5s.pdf|journal=Science for the People|volume=19|pages=6-10|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Position on science education ===

One of the core tenants of the SftP was that science and particularly biology and medicine cannot remain neutral. The organization not only believed that these disciplines should focus on correcting societal ills they also actively participated in educating people on work place hazards such as asbestos and other chemical and environmental exposures.&lt;ref name="worldcat.org"/&gt;

In the early 1970s a Boston several SftP members known as the Boston Science Teaching Group, published and distributed series of pamphlets on topics such as genetics and ecology. Other members who were professional educators volunteered to teach biology in Boston’s underserved school districts. In 1971 two university professors, Rita Arditti and Tom Strunk, in an attempt to reform college biology curriculum, created a socially conscious first year college course called “Objecting to Objectivity: A Course in Biology”. The course covered genetic engineering, physical and social limitations and implications of human gene maps, polygenic inheritance and prenatal diagnosis. It also discussed reproduction, birth control and abortion including the contemporary research and public policies about reproductive health. Other topics included population growth and Malthusian and Marxist theories and ethics of human research.&lt;ref name="worldcat.org"/&gt;

=== Positions on race and gender ===
Advocating for racial and gender equality in science and medicine was one of the core tenets of SftP.&lt;ref name="worldcat.org" /&gt; The organization included multiple feminist members who were pioneering women in [[science]].&lt;ref name="worldcat.org" /&gt; These included  Arditti and other biologists such as, [[Anne Fausto-Sterling]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.annefaustosterling.com/fields-of-inquiry/gender/|title=Gender &amp; Sexuality - Dr. Anne Fausto-Sterling|work=Dr. Anne Fausto-Sterling|access-date=2018-05-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Freda Friedman Salzman&lt;ref&gt;[http://site.www.umb.edu/faculty/salzman_g/Freda/index.htm Freda Friedman Salzman]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ruth Hubbard]],&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/careers/2016/10/ruth-hubbard-and-evolution-biology|title=Ruth Hubbard and the evolution of biology|date=2016-10-05|work=Science {{!}} AAAS|access-date=2018-05-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and author and activist Barbara Beckwith. Hubbard, for instance, was the first woman to attain tenure in biology at [[Harvard University]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; SftP also embraced the cause of gender equality in the society at large and advocated for reproductive rights, gender equality at the workplace and addressed issues surrounding sexuality.&lt;ref name="worldcat.org" /&gt; It also fought against domestic violence and traditional gender roles in family structure.&lt;ref name="worldcat.org" /&gt; While focusing on the world of science, feminist members of SftP faced an uphill battle in introducing gender parity for women in science at the universities.&lt;ref name="worldcat.org" /&gt; They also sought to change the discriminatory gender dynamics in academia and in laboratories.&lt;ref name="worldcat.org" /&gt;

SftP's efforts at promoting gender equality were paralleled with its efforts to promote racial and ethnic equality.&lt;ref name="worldcat.org" /&gt; Although made up primarily of white Americans, some SftP members maintained relations with the [[Black Panther Party]].&lt;ref name="worldcat.org" /&gt; The two organizations urged the scientific community to create a free science program for black communities to enhance their scientific knowledge. The organization also criticized attacks on affirmative action and featured pieces by black and other minority scientists in its publication.&lt;ref name="worldcat.org" /&gt; It also uncovered occupational health hazards among black and ethnic minority workers both in the US and abroad and fought to improve workplace conditions to eliminate these risks.&lt;ref name="worldcat.org" /&gt; SftP's antiracist ideology put it at odds with the concepts of [[sociobiology]] and [[genetic determinism]].&lt;ref name="worldcat.org" /&gt;

===Criticism of sociobiology===
Biologists within SftP were highly critical of [[sociobiology]], because of objectionable premises to the organization of the discipline and for the implications of using sociobiology to support [[racism]], [[capitalism]], and [[imperialism]].&lt;ref name=SftP /&gt; [[E. O. Wilson]], a [[Biology|biologist]] and [[entomology]] professor in the Department of Organismic and [[Evolutionary Biology]] at [[Harvard University]], whose book ''[[Sociobiology: A New Synthesis]]'' had helped start the debate, wrote that "the political objections forcefully made by the [[Sociobiology Study Group]] of Science for the People in particular took me by surprise."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lrainc.com/swtaboo/taboos/wilson01.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=June 17, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060618120537/http://www.lrainc.com/swtaboo/taboos/wilson01.html |archivedate=June 18, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

SftP condemned the 1969 arguments that genetic differences were the underlying reason for differences in educational achievements between blacks and whites.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/840937252|title=Sex itself : the search for male and female in the human genome|last=1980-|first=Richardson, Sarah S.,|isbn=022608468X|location=Chicago|oclc=840937252}}&lt;/ref&gt; SftP also took issue with the [[Harvard XYY study]] in 1975.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The goal of the XYY study was to assess the risk of criminality the extra Y chromosome supposedly conferred.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The SftP scientists pointed out the ethical and methodological failures of the above study, including open ended consents, stigmatization of individuals with XYY, lack of controls and absence of double blinding.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Positions on healthcare and medicine ===
Health care providers who were SftP members worked to strengthen healthcare infrastructure in underserved communities. They partnered with both the Black Panthers and [[Young Lords]] Organization to bring medical services to minorities, who often could not access the medical establishment both as practitioners and as patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www2.iath.virginia.edu/sixties/HTML_docs/Resources/Primary/Manifestos/Young_Lords_health.html|title=Ten-Point Health Program of the Young Lords|website=www2.iath.virginia.edu|access-date=2018-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Morabia|first=Alfredo|date=1 January 2016|title=Unveiling the Black Panther Party Legacy to Public Health|journal=American Journal of Public Health|volume=106|issue=10|pages=1732–1733|doi=10.2105/AJPH.2016.303405|issn=1541-0048|pmc=5024399|pmid=27626336}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bassett|first=Mary T.|date=1 January 2016|title=Beyond Berets: The Black Panthers as Health Activists|journal=American Journal of Public Health|volume=106|issue=10|pages=1741–1743|doi=10.2105/AJPH.2016.303412|issn=1541-0048|pmc=5024403|pmid=27626339}}&lt;/ref&gt; SftP joined with other New Left Health organizations such as Health Policy Advisory Center and [[Medical Committee for Human Rights]], fought for a fair and just healthcare system and advocated for women’s reproductive rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.healthpacbulletin.org|title=The Health/PAC Digital Archive: Three Decades of Health and Social Justice|website=www.healthpacbulletin.org|access-date=2018-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

SftP members, such as cancer researcher John Valentine at [[Wayne State University]], exposed the capitalist interests that drove biomedical research. He argued that the 1971 [[National Cancer Act]], signed by president [[Richard Nixon]], failed to fund research into cancer causes such as poor preventative healthcare, occupational hazards and environmental exposures. He also criticized the use of public funds only to develop new chemotherapeutic agents instead of using some of it to minimize cancer risk due to workplace exposures and cancer-causing consumer products.&lt;ref name="worldcat.org"/&gt;

SftP biologists also opposed [[recombinant DNA]] (rDNA) research before its public health and environmental impact can be thoroughly elucidated.  They also expressed concerns and, accurately, predicted that rDNA can commercialize biomedical research and make it a market commodity.  They urged the scientific community and the general public to consider who decides what research gets done and who benefits from these decisions.&lt;ref name="worldcat.org"/&gt;

=== Views on agriculture and ecology ===
SftP argued that the existing contemporary agricultural models were neither benefitting the consumer, as food prices were rising astronomically, nor the farmer because their increasing debt without a raise in income.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lewontin|first=Richard|date=1982|title=AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH AND THE PENETRATION OF CAPITAL|url=http://science-for-the-people.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/SftPv14n1s.pdf|journal=Science for the People|volume=14|pages=12-17|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The primary benefiters were input and output capital enterprises such has fertilizer companies, insecticide and herbicide manufacturers and farm machinery companies.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Members of the SftP formed the New World Agriculture Group (NWAG) that attempted to discover and develop ecologically rational alternative agricultural methods.  Methods that protected the environment and preserved long-term productive capacity.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Uriel Kitron|first=Brian Schultz|date=1983|title=ALTERNATIVES IN AGRICULTURE|url=http://science-for-the-people.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/SftPv15n1s.pdf|journal=Science for the People|volume=15|pages=25-30|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  NWAG also proposed partnering with farm labor organizations to help bring an end to worker exploitation and the unequal wealth distribution.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== International relations ===
From its inception SftP condemned the use of technology and science to oppress and colonize other countries.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Collective|first=Red Crate|date=1971|title=Help for Science Education in Cuba and Vietnam|url=http://science-for-the-people.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/SftPv3n2s.pdf|journal=Science For the People|volume=3|pages=28|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization gave the examples of both Vietnam and Cuba where, it stated, the US technological and scientific superiority was being used to both militarily and economically repress the smaller nations.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In response to the US policy, in 1971, a group of SftP members in Cambridge, Massachusetts collected and shipped large amounts of scientific books and journals to [[Vietnam]] and [[Cuba]] to aid in science education there.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The same year, molecular biologist Dr. [[Mark Ptashne]] and zoologist Dr. [[Bert Pfeiffer|Bert Pfeiffe]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;r&lt;ref&gt;[http://missoulian.com/news/local/retired-um-professor-bert-pfeiffer-dies/article_72969ca0-76c4-5a99-bb71-71ed47048d58.html Bert Pfeiffer]&lt;/ref&gt; went to Hanoi and lectured to Vietnamese scientists and physicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pshatne|first=Mark|date=1971|title=A Scientific Visit to Hanoi|url=http://science-for-the-people.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/SftPv3n3s.pdf|journal=Science for the People|volume=3|pages=19-23|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There were also successful efforts of networking with scientists in [[China]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dove|first=John et al|date=1974|title=Book Review: China: Science Walks on Two Legs|url=http://science-for-the-people.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/SftPv6n6s.pdf|journal=Science for the People|volume=6|pages=19-23|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, in the 1980s, with the scientific and technological community in [[Nicaragua]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Michael Harris|first=Victor Lopez-Tosado|date=1986|title=Science for Nicaragua|url=http://science-for-the-people.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/SftPv18n3s.pdf|journal=Science for the People|volume=18|pages=22-25|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 2014 revitalization ==
Since the fall of 2014, an effort to revive and reorganize SftP has been underway. The SftP revitalization efforts emerged from the convention held April 11–13, 2014, at the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst|University of Massachusetts]] Amherst.&lt;ref name="SftP"/&gt; At the 2014 conference various topics including the history of the SftP, health care, climate change, social justice, science education, gender and racial bias and militarization of science were discussed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://science-for-the-people.org/conference-2014/|title=Conference 2014 – Science for the People|website=science-for-the-people.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, inspired by the original 1970s-1980s group, this new formation has dedicated itself to building a social movement around progressive and radical perspectives on science and society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scienceforthepeople.org/ |title=Science for the People organization website |accessdate=February 16, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several local chapters of the SftP participated in the first annual [[March for Science]] on April 22, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/04/scientists-prepare-march-science-people-reboots|title=As scientists prepare to march, Science for the People reboots|date=2017-04-04|work=Science {{!}} AAAS|access-date=2018-04-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The revived SftP also published a statement titled "Which Way for Science?".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://scienceforthepeople.org/index.php/2017/04/18/which-way-for-science/|title=Which Way for Science? – Science for the People|website=scienceforthepeople.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The statement hailed the March for Science as "an exciting first step," but it also criticized the "apolitical" nature of the event and for their lack of attention to the experiences of scientists from historically marginalized groups such as women, people of color and others. "Which Way for Science" called attention to science's historic ties to U.S. capitalism and militarism, and called for a radical shift in its practice.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== 2018 National Convention ==
The national convention, held at the [[University of Michigan]]'s Ann Arbor campus in February 2018, brought together close to one hundred scientists and activists to formalize the group's bylaws and structure.&lt;ref name="scienceforthepeople.org"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://scienceforthepeople.org/index.php/national-convention/|title=National Convention – Science for the People|website=scienceforthepeople.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://michiganradio.org/post/science-people-revived-movement-radical-scientists-meet-week-ann-arbor|title=Science for the People, a revived movement of radical scientists, to meet this week in Ann Arbor|last=Staff|first=Stateside|access-date=2018-04-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the three days the attendees discussed the history and future of SftP, heard from local chapters that included representatives from Atlanta, Mexico City, New York and seven other North American locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://scienceforthepeople.org/index.php/sftp-chapters/|title=SftP Chapters – Science for the People|website=scienceforthepeople.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organizational structure of SftP was explored and these discussions served as a guide to developing an inclusive, radical and democratic political movement for scientists and [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]] workers.&lt;ref name="scienceforthepeople.org"/&gt; There were a dozen presentations on variety of topics related to SftP's mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://scienceforthepeople.org/index.php/2018-convention-presentations/|title=2018 Convention Presentations – Science for the People|website=scienceforthepeople.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the call to organize more local chapters a number of working groups was also developed during the meeting.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://scienceforthepeople.org/index.php/working-groups/|title=Working groups – Science for the People|website=scienceforthepeople.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; These included groups dealing with Climate Change, Reproductive Justice, Science education and others.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Plans to participate in the second annual March for Science on April 14, 2018 were also initiated at the convention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://scienceforthepeople.org/index.php/2017/04/18/which-way-for-science/|title=Which Way for Science? – Science for the People|website=scienceforthepeople.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8641">[[image:Front of Quadrant.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Sinecal Quadrant or as it is known in Arabic: Rub‘ul mujayyab]]
The '''sine quadrant''' (Arabic: Rub‘ul mujayyab, الربع المجيب) was a type of [[Quadrant (instrument)#Geometric quadrant|quadrant]] used by medieval [[Astronomy in medieval Islam|Arabic astronomers]]. It is also known as a "sinecal quadrant" in the English-speaking world.  The [[Islamic astronomy#Instruments|instrument]] could be used to measure [[Celestial coordinate system|celestial angles]], to tell time, to find directions, or to determine the apparent positions of any celestial object for any time. The name is derived from the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] "rub‘‘‘" meaning a quarter and "mujayyab" meaning marked with sine.&lt;ref name="cosmolabe"&gt;http://cosmolabe.tripod.com/id1.html&lt;/ref&gt;  It was described, according to King, by [[Muhammad ibn Mūsā al-Khwārizmī]] in 9th century Baghdad.&lt;ref&gt;David A. King, "Islamic Astronomy", in Christopher Walker (1999), ed., Astronomy before the telescope, p. 167-168. British Museum Press. {{ISBN|0-7141-2733-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Sighting the Pole Star Quadrant.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Using the Sinecal Quadrant to measure the altitude of a celestial object.  Note the index finger of the left hand ready to pin the cord to the quadrant as soon as the star sight is perfected.]]
[[File:Taking the Measure Quadrant.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Reading the scale after taking the celestial altitude.]]
[[File:Sun Sight Quadrant.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Taking the altitude of the Sun with the Sinecal Quadrant.  Note shadow of sight vane with dot of sunlight on index finger of observer.]]

The instrument is a quarter of a circle made of wood or metal (usually brass) divided on its [[Arc (geometry)|arc]] side into 90 equal parts or degrees.  The 90 divisions are gathered in 18 groups of five degrees each and are generally numbered both ways from the ends of the arc.  That is, one set of numbers begins at the left end of the arc and goes to 90 at the right end while the other set the zero is at the right and the 90 is at the left.  This double numbering enables the instrument to measure either celestial altitude or zenith distance or both simultaneously. 

At the apex where the two graduated straight sides of the grid pattern meet in a right angle there is a pin hole with a cord in it and a small weight on the free end with a small bead that slides along the cord. The cord is called “Khait” and is used as a [[plumb line]] when measuring celestial altitudes.  It is also used as the indicator of angles when doing calculations with the instrument.  The sliding bead facilitates trigonometric calculations with the instrument. 

Traditionally the line from the beginning of the arc to the apex is called “Jaibs” and the line from the end of the arc to the apex is called “Jaib tamams”. Both jaibs and jaib tamams are divided into 60 equal units and the sixty  parallel lines to the jaibs are called sitheeniys or” sixtys “ and the sixty parallel lines to the jaib tamams are “juyoobul mabsootah”. 

The reason for sixty divisions along the Jaibs and Jaib Tamams is that the instrument uses the [[Sexagesimal]] number system. That is it is graduated to the number base 60 and not to the base 10 or decimal system that we presently use.  Time, angular measurement and geographical coordinate measurements are about the only hold overs from the Sumerian/Babylonian number system that are still in current use.

Like the arc, the Jaibs and Jaib tamams have their sixty divisions gathered into groups of five that are numbered in both directions to and from the apex.  The double numbering of the arc means that the “Jaibs” and “Jaib tamams” labels are relative to the measurement being taken or to the calculation being performed at the time and the terms are not attached to one or the other of the graduated scales on the instrument.

==Measuring A Celestial Altitude With The Quadrant==

On one of the straight edges of the non maritime quadrant (solid sheet form) there are two sighting plates which are called “Hadafatani”.  Each of the alignment plates having a small, centrally placed aperture or "pinhole", the two apertures (front and back) forming the optical axis through which one sights an incline object or Sun.  The light rays from the Sun passing through both apertures, the spot image of the Sun being concentric with the center of the rear plate pinhole, imaging on to a finger (project screen) if desired but not necessary or less frequent the eye at night. The hanging plum line serving two functions the first being to provide a means (indicator) to reading the angular orientation of the instrument, the second function ensuring that the instrument when optically aligned with the object of interest is situated parallel with the vertical plane (perpendicular with the ground).

It has been stated by non astronomers and non navigators, that two people are required to use the small instrument successfully; one to take the sight and one to read the cord (plum line) position on the radius segment and incorrect presumption as the instrument is to be held flush (face on) and below eye level with a single user, the two holes used for projecting the image of the Sun not direct sighting.  As one can see from the photograph, it is easy to optically aligned the instrument with the Sun using simple image projection method, the device held in a single hand.  At the moment of alignment, one views the face of the instrument to read the angular position of the cord relative to the radii segment of the instrument.  However, it does help to have another person write down the scale readings as they are taken if a single operator is not able to do such because of environmental conditions, the single operator not having the capability to sufficiently hold the device stable, retaining the optical alignment, with just one hand.  

Making altitude (elevation) measurements of the Sun being simple and direct, requiring the user to aligning the image of the Sun through the front pinhole (aperture), centered onto the rear back plate which operates more like a mask and not a viewing pass hole for sighting the Sun with the naked eye. Much in the same manner as performing eyepiece projection with a telescope, one fashioned with a front and rear aperture (font lens and rear eyepiece) along with a projection screen behind the eyepiece, or more rudimentary, the projecting of the Sun’s image upon a small screen plate such as that done with a mariner’s back staff. The rear, or second aperture (pass hole) having the function of working as a blacken attenuator so that any reflecting, annulus shaped sunlight off the metal aperture is not too bright, the Sun’s image (light) passing through the second hole and similar in task though void of a fixed image plane, to that of an iris (diaphragm) in a camera lens to reduce the light intensity.  For relative to human physiology, focusing on a bright spot of light such as a pin point image of the Sun for any extended period or repetitively over a short duration of time adversely effects momentarily, a person’s visual acuity, thus making it more challenging to focus one’s eyes to read the angular scale. It being typical to orientate the instrument such that the operator faces looking slightly down upon the scale, the Sun at the users left, with right hand placed in such a way that the rays of sunlight pass through the two, perforated sighting plates, forming a bright illuminated spot on the observer’s finger (see photo), the finger functioning as a projection screen.  At the moment an optical alignment with the Sun is established, the angular value of the device is read by the operator at the point where the graduated scale is bisected by the hanging plumb line. 

These instruments, with poor angular resolution, not principally intended to function with stars at night, as an astronomical measuring device, since it is impractical to sight a star through the front pin hole (aperture) less on a fixed, stabilized mount relative to the half degree width of the very intense Sun. The maritime (navigation) version of these devices being skeletal in design rather than solid sheet form, so as to limit buffeting or displacement of the instrument while in the operators hand from wind exposure.

The '''Sokol space suit''', also known as the '''Sokol IVA suit''' or simply the '''Sokol''' ({{lang-ru|'''Cокол'''}}, ''Falcon''), is a type of [[Russia]]n [[space suit]], worn by all who fly on the [[Soyuz spacecraft]]. It was introduced in 1973 and is still used {{As of|2018|lc=on}}. The Sokol is described by its makers as a ''rescue suit''{{ref|abramov}} and it is not capable of being used outside the spacecraft in a spacewalk or [[extra-vehicular activity]]. Instead, its purpose is to keep the wearer alive in the event of an accidental depressurisation of the spacecraft. In this respect, it is similar to the [[Advance Crew Escape System Pressure Suit|ACES]] suit that was worn aboard [[NASA]]'s [[Space Shuttle]] during launch and landing.

== Description ==

The current version of the suit is the Sokol-KV2, manufactured by [[NPP Zvezda]] (НПП Звезда). It consists of an inner pressure layer of rubberised [[polycaprolactam]] and an outer layer of white nylon [[canvas]]. Boots are integrated with the suit but gloves are removable and attach by means of blue [[Anodising|anodised aluminium]] wrist couplings. The [[polycarbonate]] visor can open on hinges mounted near the ears and seals with an anodised aluminium clavicle flange when closed; the hood or 'soft helmet' folds when the visor is raised. The suit has four pockets and adjustment straps on the arms, legs, chest, and abdomen.

There is a suit pressure gauge on the left wrist. A mirror on an elastic wrist band is worn on the right&amp;mdash;this helps the wearer see things that would otherwise be outside his or her field of view. During re-entry, an [[altimeter]] on a wrist strap may also be worn{{snd}} this gives an immediate check on cabin pressure and warns when to brace for touchdown (during the last phase of landing the cabin opens to the outside air.) A wristwatch is often worn as well, with an elastic wrist band replacing the strap so it may fit over the bulky suit glove. The watches are often privately purchased and a wide variety of Swiss and Russian models have been used.{{ref|sotherbys1}}{{ref|sotherbys2}}

Electrical cables are mounted on the right abdomen of the suit; on the left abdomen there are separate hoses for air and oxygen. Normally, an electric blower ventilates the suit with cabin air through the larger hose at the rate of {{convert|150|l|cuft|abbr=off}} per minute. If the cabin pressure drops below {{convert|600|hPa|atm psi|abbr=off}}, the air supply is automatically replaced with oxygen from pressurised bottles.{{ref|abramov}} at a rate of {{convert|22|l|cuft|abbr=off}} per minute.&lt;ref name="ESA"/&gt; Both air and oxygen exhaust through the blue pressure relief valve at the centre of the chest; this valve also regulates the pressure of the suit.

Effectively, the suit uses an open-circuit life support system that somewhat resembles [[Scuba set|scuba]] equipment. This has the advantage of simplicity; the disadvantage of a high rate of oxygen consumption is considered acceptable given that it is only intended for emergency use.

The suits weigh around {{convert|10|kg|lb}} and are described by those who have used them as a considerable encumbrance when worn on the ground.{{ref|sharman}} Despite this, they are intended to be worn for up to 30 hours in a pressurised environment or two hours in a vacuum. They can also float and have a neck dam that allows the visor to be raised in water without the risk of flooding the suit. However, Soyuz crews are provided with buoyancy aids and cold-water survival suits which would preferably be used if the Soyuz accidentally landed in water.{{ref|sharman}}{{ref|sotherbys1}}

{{As of|2002}}, a total of 309 flight suits had been made along with 135 training and testing suits.{{ref|abramov}}

== Operational use ==
[[Image:Expedition 16 suit up.jpg|thumb|right|[[Peggy Whitson]] wearing an inflated Sokol-KV2 spacesuit (2007)]]
[[File:Expedition 47 Qualification Exams (NHQ201602250020).jpg|thumb|right|Sokol portable ventilation units]]
Each Soyuz crew member is provided with a made-to-measure suit for flight although, from the numbers made, it appears that the suits provided for ground training are re-used. It is considered vital that the flight suit fits correctly and the wearer will spend two hours sitting in a launch couch with the suit inflated to make sure of this. Straps on the arms, legs and chest allow the fit to be adjusted slightly. 

To don the suit, the two zips that make a 'V' on the chest are opened. Underneath, there is a large tubular opening in the inner pressure layer known as the ''appendix''. Legs go in first, followed by the arms into the sleeves and head into the helmet. When the suit is on, an airtight seal is made by tightly rolling up the appendix and securing it with strong elastic bands. The large bulge of the rolled-up appendix is secured under the V shaped flap in the suit's outer layer. When worn on the ground, the suit is attached to a portable ventilation unit &amp;mdash;a hand-held device that supplies air to the suit, cooling it first with an ice filled heat exchanger. Grey leather outer boots are also worn on the ground; they protect the feet of the suit from damage and are removed before entering the spacecraft to avoid carrying debris into the cabin. 

The suit is worn during launch and re-entry of the Soyuz spacecraft&amp;mdash;the gloves are attached and the visor is sealed at these times. In an emergency, the suit pressure is usually maintained at 400 hPa (0.39 atm, 5.8 psi) above the ambient by the pressure relief valve. However, the suits only have a rudimentary pressure relief layer so they tend to balloon when inflated. Movement of the wearer becomes restricted, although it is still possible to function inside the capsule.

If more than limited movement is required, the pressure relief valve may be adjusted to a lower setting of 270 hPa (0.26 atm, 3.9 psi). Pure oxygen at this pressure will support life, but the setting is only intended for use in extreme emergencies;{{ref|sharman}} the risk of [[decompression sickness]] becomes significant if the wearer spends more than 15 minutes at the lower pressure setting.{{ref|abramov}}

The maximum length of time the suits may be used in a vacuum is 125 minutes. The time is limited because the oxygen flow to the suit is enough for life support, but insufficient to carry away the cosmonaut's body heat and longer use of the suit risks [[Heat exhaustion]]. If the capsule becomes depressurised, either accidentally or deliberately to extinguish a fire, it must land within that time.&lt;ref name="ESA"&gt;{{Cite video |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oE5Z3Uxbezc |title=Fire in the Soyuz! |date=May 18, 2015 |publisher=European Space Agency }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Pressure suits were worn on the [[Vostok program|Vostok]] space missions, but when the Soyuz spacecraft was being developed in the mid-1960s, the controversial decision was taken by its designers, [[OKB-1]], not to use them on the new spacecraft. Some of the early Soyuz flights carried [[Yastreb]] space suits but these were only for space walks and were only worn in orbit.

On June 30, 1971, the crew of [[Soyuz 11]] died when their spacecraft depressurised during re-entry. One of the recommendations of the investigating government commission was that pressure suits should be worn by future crews during critical phases of their mission - launch, docking and landing.

NPP Zvezda was given the task of providing the suits. They rejected the use of existing Soviet space suits and chose to base a new suit on the existing Sokol aviation [[pressure suit]]. The main modification was the replacement of the Sokol suit's hard helmet. Other features of the aviation suit that were considered unnecessary were removed to save weight.

At the same time, a life support system was developed in co-operation with [[OKB-1]]. The new suit was named the Sokol-K, K (Kosmos) is the abbreviation of the Russian word for space.

The first version of the suit, it was used on [[Soyuz 12]], launched on September 27, 1973.

=== Sokol-KR ===
A version intended for use with the [[TKS spacecraft]] which was to be used as part of the [[Almaz]] programme. The suit was never used as the TKS never flew with a crew. Its main difference was that it was designed to work with a regenerative life support system.

=== Sokol-KM and Sokol-KV ===
Work on improving the Sokol-K began 1973, immediately after its introduction. The Sokol-KM and KV were intermediate models on which many of the features of the Sokol-KV2 were developed, neither was ever used in space.

To be donned, the Sokol-KM and KV split into upper and lower halves joined by zip fasteners. However, this feature was discarded in the Sokol-KV2 and the appendix was retained as a means of donning the suit{{snd}} it was thought to be more reliable than the airtight zippers the Russians were able to make. Other changes included alterations to the fabric around the joints, to improve mobility, and improvement of the gloves, to make it easier to operate the spacecraft controls. 

The KM and KV also featured a liquid-cooled undergarment that would increase the comfort of the wearer by efficiently removing body-heat; other suits relied on the flow of air to do this.

The Sokol-KV2, the current version of the suit, was first used on the [[Soyuz T-2]] mission, launched on June 5, 1980.

The main improvement was the replacement of the rubber pressure layer of the Sokol-K with rubberised polycaprolactam to save weight. The visor was modified and enlarged to give the wearer a better field of view. Laces in the outer canvas layer were replaced with zippers to make the suit quicker to don and the pressure relief valve was moved from the left abdomen to the centre of the chest so either hand could be used to alter the suit's pressure setting. The improved arms, legs, and gloves of the Sokol-KV were retained although the liquid cooled undergarment of the KM and KV was discarded.

== Foreign use ==
[[Image:Yang Liwei space suit.JPG|thumb|200px|[[Space program of China|Chinese]] space suit worn by [[Yang Liwei]]  during the ''[[Shenzhou 5]]'' space flight.]]

The [[People's Republic of China|Chinese]] have bought a number of space suits from the Russians for use in their [[Space program of China|space programme]]. The suit worn by [[Yang Liwei]] on ''[[Shenzhou 5]]'', the first manned Chinese space flight, closely resembles a Sokol-KV2 suit, but it is believed to be a Chinese-made version rather than an actual Russian suit. Pictures show that the suits worn by [[Fei Junlong]] and [[Nie Haisheng]] on ''[[Shenzhou 6]]'' differ in detail from the earlier suit; they are also reported to be lighter.

Sokol suits have been bought for uses other than spaceflight. It was planned that the crew of the [[Great Britain|British]] [[QinetiQ 1]] high-altitude balloon would wear modified Sokol suits purchased from [[NPP Zvezda|Zvezda]]. As the balloonists would have occupied an open platform during their twelve-hour flight, the Sokol suits, together with heavily insulated outer garments, would have protected them from the cold and low pressure of the [[stratosphere]] as the balloon ascended to a height of around 40&amp;nbsp;km (25 miles, 132,000 feet).

[[Bulgaria]] developed its own version of the space suit in the mid-1970s.

== U.S. equivalent ==
During the flight of [[Gemini 7]], [[Frank Borman]] and [[Jim Lovell]] wore modified Gemini spacesuits that somewhat resemble the Sokol suits, but with significant differences. Their suits were known as the '''[[Gemini Spacesuit|G5C]]''' by their manufacturer, the [[David Clark Company]].

== Collectors' market ==
Sokol space suits, including ones flown in space, were first sold by [[Sotheby's]] at an auction devoted to Russian space history in 1993. Subsequently, components such as gloves, communications caps, and wrist mirrors have frequently come up for sale on [[eBay]]; even complete suits have occasionally come up for sale, such as the one that [[Heritage Auctions]] sold for US$31,070 in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://historical.ha.com/common/view_item.php?Sale_No=6033&amp;Lot_No=41208] Talgat Musabayev Space-flown Sokol KV-2 Pressurized Spacesuit&lt;/ref&gt; These are usually worn out items that have been discarded after use during ground training and were never intended for use in space. As these items are nominally the property of the Russian government, the legitimacy of their sale has been questioned.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart (2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Soyuz''' ({{lang-ru|Союз}}, meaning "union", [[GRAU index]] '''11A511''') was a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[expendable launch system|expendable]] [[carrier rocket]] designed in the 1960s by [[OKB-1]] and manufactured by [[State Aviation Plant No. 1]] in [[Samara, Russia|Kuybyshev, Soviet Union]]. It was commissioned to launch [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz spacecraft]] as part of the [[Soyuz programme|Soviet human spaceflight program]], first with 8 unmanned test flights, followed by the first 19 [[human spaceflight|manned]] launches.&lt;ref name=gunter /&gt; The original Soyuz also propelled four test flights of the improved [[Soyuz 7K-T]] capsule between 1972 and 1974. In total it flew 30 successful missions over 10 years and suffered two failures.&lt;ref name=gunter /&gt;

The Soyuz 11A511 type, a member of the [[R-7 (rocket family)|R-7]] family of rockets. first flew in 1966. Derived from the [[Voskhod (rocket)|Voskhod]] 11A57 type, It was a two-stage rocket, with four liquid-fuelled strap-on boosters clustered around the first stage, with a Block I second stage. The new, uprated core stage and strap-ons became standard for all R-7 derived launch vehicles to replace the numerous older variants in use on the 8A92, 11A57, and 8K78M types. While the original Blok I stage as developed in 1960 used RD-107 engines, the Soyuz boosters instead had RD-110s, which were more powerful due to the heavier weight of the Soyuz craft and also had several design improvements to increase reliability and safety on manned missions. The Molniya 8K78M booster also adopted the RD-110 during 1965, but Voskhod boosters continued using the older RD-107.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.samspace.ru/ENG/RN/ser_souz.htm |title="Soyuz" - series launch vehicles |publisher=Samara Space Centre |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120207031915/http://www.samspace.ru/ENG/RN/ser_souz.htm |archivedate=7 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 1973, the original Soyuz rocket was gradually superseded by the [[Soyuz-U]] derivative type, which became the world's most prolific launcher, flying hundreds of missions over 43 years until its retirement scheduled for 2016. Other direct variants were [[Soyuz-L]] for [[low Earth orbit]] tests of the [[LK (spacecraft)|LK lunar lander]] (3 flights) and [[Soyuz-M]] built for a quickly abandoned [[Military Soyuz|military spacecraft]] and used for [[Zenit-4|reconnaissance satellites]] instead (8 flights).

The aborted [[Soyuz 18-1]] launch in 1975 was the final manned flight of the 11A511 and as it occurred shortly before the [[Apollo–Soyuz Test Project|ASTP mission]], the United States requested that the Soviets provide details about this failure. They stated that Soyuz 19 would be using the newer 11A5511U booster model (i.e. [[Soyuz-U]]) so that the Soyuz 18-1 malfunction had no bearing on it.

Soyuz rockets were assembled horizontally in the [[MIK Building]] at the launch site. The rocket was then rolled out, and erected on the launch pad.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}

The '''Swiss cheese model''' of accident causation is a model used in [[Risk analysis (engineering)|risk analysis]] and [[risk management]], including [[aviation safety]], [[engineering]], [[healthcare]], emergency service organizations, and as the principle behind [[layered security]], as used in [[computer security]] and [[Defense in depth (computing)|defense in depth]]. It likens human systems to multiple slices of [[swiss cheese]], stacked side by side, in which the risk of a threat becoming a reality is mitigated by the differing layers and types of defenses which are "layered" behind each other.  Therefore, in theory, lapses and weaknesses in one defense do not allow a risk to materialize, since other defenses also exist, to prevent a [[single point of failure]]. The model was originally formally propounded by Dante Orlandella and James T. Reason of the [[University of Manchester]],{{sfn|Reason|1990}} and has since gained widespread acceptance.  It is sometimes called the '''cumulative act effect'''.

Although the Swiss cheese model is respected and considered to be a useful method of relating concepts, it has been subject to criticism that it is used too broadly, and without enough other models or support.&lt;ref name="eurocontrol"&gt;{{cite web| publisher=Eurocontrol| title=Revisiting the Swiss cheese model of accidents| date= October 2006| url=http://www.eurocontrol.int/eec/gallery/content/public/document/eec/report/2006/017_Swiss_Cheese_Model.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Failure domains==
Reason hypothesized that most accidents can be traced to one or more of four failure domains: organizational influences, supervision, preconditions, and specific acts.&lt;ref&gt;1. J.A. Doran (Shell International Exploration and Production B.V.)  |G.C. van der Graaf (Shell International Exploration and Production B.V.) Tripod-BETA: Incident investigation and analysis, Proceedings of the SPEE Health, Safety and Environment in Oil and Gas Exploration and Production Conference, 9-12 June, New Orleans, Louisiana Publication Date1996&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;2. A.D. Gower-Jones (Shell International Exploration and Production)  |  G.C. van der Graf (Shell International Exploration and Production) Experience with Tripod BETA Incident Analysis Proceedings of the SPE International Conference on Health, Safety, and Environment in Oil and Gas Exploration and Production, 7-10 June, Caracas, Venezuela Publication Date1998&lt;/ref&gt;For example, in aviation, preconditions for unsafe acts include fatigued air crew or improper communications practices.  Unsafe supervision encompasses for example, pairing inexperienced pilots on a night flight into known adverse weather. Organizational influences encompass such things as reduction in expenditure on pilot training in times of financial austerity.&lt;ref name=Wieg/&gt;&lt;ref name=Stranks /&gt;

==Holes and slices==
In the Swiss cheese model, an organisation's defenses against failure are modeled as a series of barriers, represented as slices of cheese. The holes in the slices represent weaknesses in individual parts of the system and are continually varying in size and position across the slices. The system produces failures when a hole in each slice momentarily aligns, permitting (in Reason's words) "a trajectory of accident opportunity", so that a hazard passes through holes in all of the slices, leading to a failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Controlling Pilot Error|author1=Daryl Raymond Smith |author2=David Frazier |author3=L W Reithmaier |author4=James C Miller  |last-author-amp=yes |pages=10|year=2001|publisher=McGraw-Hill Professional|isbn=0071373187}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages=4&amp;ndash;6|title=Clinical Risk Management in Midwifery: the right to a perfect baby?|author1=Jo.

==Active and latent failures==
The model includes both active and latent failures.  Active failures encompass the unsafe acts that can be directly linked to an accident, such as (in the case of aircraft accidents) a [[navigation]] error. Latent failures include contributory factors that may lie dormant for days, weeks, or months until they contribute to the accident. Latent failures span the first three domains of failure in Reason's model.&lt;ref name=Wieg&gt;{{cite book|title=A human error approach to aviation accident analysis: the human factors analysis and classification system|author1=Douglas A. Wiegmann |author2=Scott A. Shappell |lastauthoramp=yes |pages=48&amp;ndash;49|year=2003|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|isbn=0754618730}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early days of the Swiss Cheese model, late 1980 to about 1992, attempts were made to combine two theories: James Reason multi-layer defence model and Willem Albert Wagenaar’s [[Tripod Beta|Tripod theory of accident causation]]. This resulted in a period where the Swiss Cheese diagram was represented with the slices of cheese labels as Active Failures, Preconditions and latent failures. 

These attempts to combine both theories still causes confusion today. A more correct version of the combined theories is shown with the Active Failures (now called immediate causes) Precondition and Latent Failure (now called underlying causes) shown as the reason each barrier (slice of cheese) has a hole in it and the slices of cheese as the barriers.

==Applications==
The same framework can be applicable in some areas of healthcare. For example, a latent failure could be the similar packaging of two drugs that are then stored close to each other in a pharmacy. Such a failure would be a contributory factor in the administration of the wrong drug to a patient. Such research led to the realization that [[medical error]] can be the result of "system flaws, not character flaws", and that greed, ignorance, malice or laziness are not the only causes of error.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Annual Review of Nursing Research Volume 24: Focus on Patient Safety|editor1=Joyce J.

Westrum models latent failures as voids within this envelope, and active failures as factors external to the envelope that are acting to breach it.

{{DISPLAYTITLE:''TV Guide'''s 100 Greatest Episodes of All-Time}}
'''100 Greatest Episodes of All-Time''' (1997) and '''Top 100 Episodes of All Time''' (2009) are lists of the 100 best [[television show]] [[episode]]s in [[Television in the United States|U.S. television]] history.  ''[[TV Guide]]'' published both lists: the first, published in June 28, 1997, was produced in collaboration with [[Nick at Nite]]'s [[TV Land]].&lt;ref name=TCOTCoH/&gt;&lt;ref name=THLHMTAFMAT1RHSGO/&gt; A revised list was published in June 15, 2009.  The lists excluded [[game show]]s and [[variety show]]s, but included [[situation comedy|situation comedies]] and [[drama series]].&lt;ref name=THLHMTAFMAT1RHSGO/&gt;

==History and differences==
About 25 shows from the original list were featured during a special week on [[Nick at Night]] on [[Nickelodeon]] and TV Land.&lt;ref name=TCOTCoH/&gt;&lt;ref name=YtT/&gt; On the original list several shows, including ''[[I Love Lucy]]'', ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'', ''[[The Dick Van Dyke Show]]'', ''[[Seinfeld]]'', ''[[Cheers]]'', and ''[[The Odd Couple (1970 TV series)|The Odd Couple]]'' had multiple entries, but none did on the 2009 list.&lt;ref name=YtT/&gt; The original list included 35 episodes from the 1950s and 1960s, while the 2009 list only included 10.&lt;ref name=YtT/&gt; Over one-third of the new list first aired in the twelve years since the original list, including 14 from the most recent two years.&lt;ref name=YtT/&gt; The June 2009 list included episodes as recent as the April 12, 2009, "[[Peekaboo (Breaking Bad)|Peekaboo]]" episode of ''[[Breaking Bad]]'' and the April 7, 2009, "Baptism" episode of  ''[[Rescue Me (U.S. TV series)|Rescue Me]]'', while the 1997 list included a two-month-old episode of ''[[The X-Files]]''.&lt;ref name=YtT/&gt;

[[CBS]] was the original broadcaster of 35 of the 1997 list members, including both of the top two: "[[Chuckles Bites the Dust]]" of ''The Mary Tyler Moore Show'' and "[[Lucy Does a TV Commercial]]" from ''I Love Lucy''.&lt;ref name=TCOTCoH/&gt; Several television series were represented by a different episode in 2009 than they were in 1997. The 2009 top rated show was "[[The Contest]]" from ''Seinfeld'' although in 1997 the show had been represented by "[[The Boyfriend (Seinfeld)|The Boyfriend]]" (number four) and "[[The Parking Garage]]" (number 33), instead of "The Contest".&lt;ref name=YtT/&gt; Three of the top 10 1997 episodes were removed although the series continued to be represented by other episodes: "[[The $99,000 Answer]]" (number 6) from ''[[The Honeymooners]]'', "[[Thanksgiving Orphans]]" (number 7) from ''[[Cheers]]''; and "Coast-to-Coast Big Mouth" (number 8) from ''The Dick Van Dyke Show''.&lt;ref name=YtT/&gt;

The 1997 list included detailed show descriptions for all episodes, while only a select few were accompanied by more than a single sentence in the ascending order 2009 list.&lt;ref name=YtT/&gt; Only one of the thirteen contributors to the 2009 list was involved in the 1997 list.&lt;ref name=YtT/&gt;

==Reception==
[[Paley Center for Media]]'s James Sheridan regretted the recent bias of the newer list.&lt;ref name=YtT/&gt; Hal Boedeker of the ''[[Orlando Sentinel]]'' viewed the original list as a triumphant result despite its conflict of interest.&lt;ref name= TCOTCoH/&gt; The original list was derided for omitting ''[[Bonanza]]'' and ''[[The Golden Girls]]'' entirely.&lt;ref name=TCOTCoH/&gt; ''[[Daily News (New York)|Daily News]]''{{'}} David Bianculli was critical of the original list, saying that many selections would not be on a more legitimate top-100 list.&lt;ref name= THLHMTAFMAT1RHSGO/&gt; He claimed that episodes chosen from ''[[Murder One (TV series)|Murder One]]'', ''[[The Partridge Family]]'', ''[[The Love Boat]]'', and ''[[Speed Racer]]'' reveal a lack of either maturity or perspective, while others showed taste and bravery.&lt;ref name=THLHMTAFMAT1RHSGO/&gt; ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' critic Steve Johnson complained that it was premature to claim that any episode of ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'' had established sufficient cultural significance to rank third on the original list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1997-06-30/features/9706300002_1_top-tv-cable-advertiser|title=Top TV episodes: The cover of TV Guide this week trumpets...|accessdate=March 25, 2012|date=June 30, 1997|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|last=Johnson |first=Steve}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jaime Weinman of ''[[Maclean's]]'' complained that the 2009 list was composed of the most well-known episode of famous series, claiming that they were largely unexceptional episodes.&lt;ref name=TG1EWHOL&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www2.macleans.ca/2009/06/16/tv-guides-100-episodes-weve-heard-of-list/| title=TV Guide's "100 Episodes We've Heard Of" List| accessdate= March 25, 2012|date= June 16, 2009 |work=[[Maclean's]]|last=Weinman |first=Jaime}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He preferred the 1997 list, which he said was produced when ''TV Guide'' was a higher caliber publication.&lt;ref name=TG1EWHOL/&gt;
