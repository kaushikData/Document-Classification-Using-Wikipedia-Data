[[File:Oil price chronology-june2007.gif|450px|right|thumb|Detailed analysis of 1970–2007 changes in nominal oil price, unadjusted for inflation.]]

The '''1980s oil glut''' was a serious surplus of [[Petroleum|crude oil]] caused by falling demand following the [[1970s energy crisis]]. The world price of oil, which had peaked in 1980 at over [[United States dollar|US$]]35 per barrel (equivalent to ${{Inflation|US|35|1980}} per barrel in 2008 dollars, when adjusted for inflation), fell in 1986 from $27 to below $10 (${{Inflation|US|27|1986}} to ${{Inflation|US|10|1986}} in 2008 dollars).&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Oil Prices Pass Record Set in ’80s, but Then Recede | date=2008-03-08 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/03/business/worldbusiness/03cnd-oil.html?hp | newspaper = New York Times | first=Jad | last=Mouawad | accessdate=2010-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The glut began in the early 1980s as a result of slowed economic activity in industrial countries (due to the crises of the 1970s, especially in [[1973 energy crisis|1973]] and [[1979 energy crisis|1979]]) and the energy conservation spurred by high fuel prices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Oil Glut, Price Cuts: How Long Will They Last?| journal=[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]| date= 1980-08-18| volume= 89 |issue = 7 | page= 44 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[inflation]]-adjusted [[Real versus nominal value (economics)|real 2004 dollar value]] of oil fell from an average of $78.2 in 1981 to an average of $26.8 per barrel in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cta.ornl.gov/data/tedb26/Spreadsheets/Table10_03.xls Oak Ridge National Lab data]{{dead link|date=January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1981, ''[[The New York Times]]'' stated an "Oil glut! ... is here"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news 
|title=How the Oil Glut Is Changing Business |newspaper=The New York Times |date=21 June 1981 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/06/21/business/how-the-oil-glut-is-changing-business.html?pagewanted=all |first=Robert D. |last=Hershey Jr.|accessdate=30 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and ''[[Time Magazine]]'' stated: "the world temporarily floats in a glut of oil",&lt;ref name="Christopher Byron"&gt;{{cite news |title= Problems for Oil Producers | journal= Time

He wrote that the main cause of the glut was declining consumption.  In the United States, Europe and Japan, oil consumption had fallen 13% from 1979 to 1981, due to "in part, in reaction to the very large increases in oil prices by the [[Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries]] and other oil exporters", continuing a trend begun during the 1973 price increases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

After 1980, reduced demand and increased production produced a glut on the world market. The result was a six-year decline in the price of oil, which culminated by plunging more than half in 1986 alone.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;

==Production==

===Non-OPEC===
During the 1980s, reliance on [[Middle East]] production dwindled as commercial exploration developed major non-OPEC oilfields in Siberia, Alaska, the [[North Sea oil|North Sea]], and the Gulf of Mexico,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1cJhK-Sd8QgC&amp;pg=PT95 |title=American Power and the Prospects for International Order |first=Simon |last=Bromley |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |year=2013 |isbn=9780745658414 |page=95}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Soviet Union became the world's largest producer of oil.&lt;ref&gt;"World: Saudis Edge U.S. on Oil". ''Washington Post'', January 3, 1980, p.

====USA====
In April 1979, [[Jimmy Carter]] signed an executive order which was to remove [[price controls]] from petroleum products by October 1981, so that prices would be wholly determined by the free market. Carter's successor, [[Ronald Reagan]] signed an executive order on January 28, 1981, which enacted this reform immediately,&lt;ref = Executive Order 12287&gt;{{cite news | title=Executive Order 12287 -- Decontrol of Crude Oil and Refined Petroleum Products | date=January 28, 1981| url=http://www.reagan.utexas.edu/archives/speeches/1981/12881a.htm| accessdate= 9 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; allowing the [[free market]] to adjust oil prices in the US.&lt;ref = Urban Transportation Planning&gt;{{cite book |quote= "By September 30, 1981, petroleum prices were to be determined by the free market.

Additionally, [[Trans-Alaska Pipeline System]] began pumping oil in 1977.

===OPEC===
From 1980 to 1986, [[OPEC]] decreased oil production several times and nearly in half, in an attempt to maintain oil's high prices.  However, it failed to hold on to its preeminent position, and by 1981, its production was surpassed by non-OPEC countries{{Clarify|date=April 2008}}.  OPEC had seen its share of the world market drop to less than a third in 1985, from about half during the 1970s.&lt;ref name="NYT" /&gt;  In February 1982, the ''[[Boston Globe]]'' reported that OPEC's production, which had previously peaked in 1977, was at its lowest level since 1969. Non-OPEC nations were at that time supplying most of the West's imports.&lt;ref name="BoGlobe"&gt;{{cite news |title=The economy: the Oil Glut deepens; OPEC's grip loosens; but a boom or a bomb could spur prices back up| newspaper=Boston Globe| date=1982-02-28 | first=David | last=Warsh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

OPEC's membership began to have divided opinions over what actions to take. In September 1985, [[Saudi Arabia]] became fed up with de facto propping up prices by lowering its own production in the face of high output from elsewhere in OPEC.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite book |first=Daniel |last=Yergin |title=[[The Prize: The Epic Quest for Oil, Money, and Power]] |publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster |date=1991 |isbn=0-671-50248-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985, daily output was around 3.5 million bpd, down from around 10 million in 1981.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; During this period, OPEC members were supposed to meet production quotas in order to maintain price stability; however, many countries inflated their reserves to achieve higher quotas, cheated, or outright refused to accord with the quotas.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; In 1985, the Saudis tired of this behavior and decided to punish the undisciplined OPEC countries.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The Saudis abandoned their role as [[swing producer]] and began producing at full capacity, creating a "huge surplus that angered many of their colleagues in OPEC".&lt;ref name="TIME"&gt;{{cite news |title= Cheap Oil!| journal= Time | date= 1986-04-14 | url=http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,961087,00.html |first=Stephen |last=Koepp | accessdate= 19 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[EROEI|High-cost]] oil production facilities became less or even not profitable. Oil prices as a result fell to as low as $7 per barrel.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Reduced demand==

OPEC had relied on the [[price elasticity of demand|price inelasticity of demand]] of oil to maintain high consumption, but underestimated the extent to which other sources of supply would become profitable as prices increased.

== History ==
[[Image:Show pic1.jpg|140px|thumb|Behind the scenes at one of the Bronner Bros. trade shows]]Nathaniel and Arthur Bronner, with the help of their sister, Emma Bronner, started Bronner Bros. in 1947 as a way to teach [[cosmetology]] at the local [[YMCA]]. About 300 people attended the first show but as the attendance grew, it was moved to the Royal Peacock Social Club and then to the Auburn Avenue Casino.&lt;ref name="cutting"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Thomas|first1=Chandra|title=Cutting Edge|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=qg4AAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA163&amp;lpg=PA163&amp;dq=The+Ark+of+Salvation+bronner&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=XsP7zOvMmh&amp;sig=a_AADYNpz3xV4FB808be3UimmwQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwin2vDz-PbRAhXFBcAKHQLwAlMQ6AEITDAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20Ark%20of%20Salvation%20bronner&amp;f=false|accessdate=4 February 2017|agency=Atlanta|date=September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1967, Bronner Bros. signed a contract with the new [[Hyatt Regency Hotel]] and the show was on that gas held there annually for the next 20 years. During this time, the Bronners secured a number of popular guest speakers, including Dr. [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]], [[Jackie Robinson]], [[Dick Gregory]] and Dr. [[Benjamin Mays]].&lt;ref name="OurHistory"&gt;{{cite web|title=Our History|url=http://bronnerbros.com/our-history/|website=BronnerBros.com|accessdate=4 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With Nathaniel Bronner, Sr's death in 1993, Bernard Bronner took over the company as president and CEO and the trade show has continued to grow by leaps and bounds. In 1996, all Bronner Bros. delegates traveled to [[Orlando, Florida]] for a large conference. The annual trade show is now held in the prestigious [[Georgia World Congress Center]]. As of 2015, the Bronner Bros. International Beauty Show was the largest gathering of multicultural beauty professionals in the U.S., pulling in 22,000 attendees and 300 exhibitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Whaley|first1=Kacie|title=2015 Bronner Bros.

'''''Manihot esculenta''''', [[common name|commonly called]] '''cassava''' ({{IPAc-en|k|ə|ˈ|s|ɑː|v|ə}}), '''manioc''',&lt;ref name=GRIN&gt;{{GRIN |accessdate=4 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''yuca''', '''macaxeira''', '''mandioca''', '''aipim''' and '''Brazilian arrowroot''',{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} is a woody [[shrub]] native to South America of the [[spurge]] family, [[Euphorbiaceae]]. It is extensively cultivated as an annual [[agriculture|crop]] in [[tropical]] and [[subtropical]] regions for its edible [[starch]]y [[tuberous root]], a major source of [[carbohydrate]]s. Though it is often called '''''yuca''''' in Spanish and in the United States, it differs from [[yucca]], an unrelated fruit-bearing shrub in the family [[Asparagaceae]]. Cassava, when dried to a powdery (or pearly) extract, is called [[tapioca]]; its fried, granular form is named ''[[garri]]''.

Cassava is the third-largest source of food carbohydrates in the tropics, after [[rice]] and [[maize]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cassava|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|url=http://www.fao.org/ag/agp/agpc/gcds/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Fauquet Claude |author2=Fargette Denis | year = 1990 | title = African Cassava Mosaic Virus: Etiology, Epidemiology, and Control | url = http://www.apsnet.org/publications/PlantDisease/BackIssues/Documents/1990Articles/PlantDisease74n06_404.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Plant Disease | volume = 74 | issue = 6| pages = 404–11 | doi=10.1094/pd-74-0404}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cassava is a major [[staple food]] in the developing world, providing a basic diet for over half a billion people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dimensions of Need: An atlas of food and agriculture |publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|year=1995|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/u8480e/U8480E01.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of the most drought-tolerant crops, capable of growing on marginal soils.  Nigeria is the world's largest producer of cassava, while Thailand is the largest exporter of dried cassava.

Cassava is classified as either sweet or bitter. Like other roots and tubers, both bitter and sweet varieties of cassava contain [[antinutrient|antinutritional]] factors and toxins, with the bitter varieties containing much larger amounts.&lt;ref name="fao.org"&gt;{{cite book|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations |year=1990|title=Roots, tubers, plantains and bananas in human nutrition|chapter= Ch. 7 Toxic substances and antinutritional factors|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/t0207e/T0207E08.htm#Cassava%20toxicity |place=Rome|isbn=9789251028629}}&lt;/ref&gt; It must be properly prepared before consumption, as improper preparation of cassava can leave enough residual [[cyanide]] to cause acute [[cyanide poisoning|cyanide intoxication]],&lt;ref name="promedmail-4799579"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.promedmail.org/post/4799579|title=CASSAVA POISONING – VENEZUELA|date=29 January 2017|access-date=29 January 2017|publisher=[[ProMED-mail]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cassava poisoning was integral to Episode 177 of Series 17 of the BBC drama 'Doctors' |publisher=BBC|date=5 February 2016 |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/b06zn3j8/doctors-series-17-177-a-taste-of-home}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[goiter]]s, and even [[ataxia]], partial paralysis, or death. The more toxic varieties of cassava are a fall-back resource (a "[[food security]] crop") in times of famine or food insecurity in some places.&lt;ref name="promedmail-4799579" /&gt;&lt;ref name="fao.org"/&gt; Farmers often prefer the bitter varieties because they deter pests, animals, and thieves.&lt;ref name="leisa"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Chiwona-Karltun, Linley; Katundu, Chrissie; Ngoma, James; Chipungu, Felistus; Mkumbira, Jonathan; Simukoko, Sidney and Jiggins, Janice |year=2002|title=Bitter cassava and women: an intriguing response to food security|journal=LEISA Magazine| volume =18 |issue =4|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/255687456}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The cassava root is long and tapered, with a firm, homogeneous flesh encased in a detachable rind, about 1&amp;nbsp;mm thick, rough and brown on the outside. Commercial [[cultivar]]s can be {{convert|5|to|10|cm|abbr=on}} in diameter at the top, and around {{convert|15|to|30|cm|abbr=on}} long. A woody vascular bundle runs along the root's [[Coordinate axis|axis]]. The flesh can be chalk-white or yellowish. Cassava roots are very rich in [[starch]] and contain small amounts of calcium (16&amp;nbsp;mg/100 g), phosphorus (27&amp;nbsp;mg/100 g), and vitamin C (20.6&amp;nbsp;mg/100 g).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Basic Report:  11134, Cassava, raw|url=https://ndb.nal.usda.gov/ndb/foods/show/2907?manu=&amp;fgcd=&amp;ds=|website=National Nutrient Database for Standard Reference Release 28|date=May 2016|publisher=Agricultural Research Service, US Department of Agriculture|accessdate=7 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they are poor in [[protein]] and other [[nutrient]]s. In contrast, cassava leaves are a good source of protein (rich in lysine), but deficient in the [[amino acid]] [[methionine]] and possibly [[tryptophan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Ravindran |first=Velmerugu|title=Preparation of cassava leaf products and their use as animal feeds. |journal=FAO Animal Production and Health Paper|issue=95|pages=111–125|year=1992|url=http://www.fao.org/Ag/AGA/AGAP/FRG/AHPP95/95-111.pdf|accessdate=13 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Albert_Eckhout_-_Mandioca.jpg|thumb|left|17th c. painting by [[Albert Eckhout]] in [[Dutch Brazil]]]]
Wild populations of ''M. esculenta'' subspecies ''flabellifolia'', shown to be the progenitor of domesticated cassava, are centered in west-central Brazil, where it was likely first domesticated no more than 10,000 years [[Before Present|BP]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Olsen | first1 = KM

Cassava was a staple food of [[pre-Columbian]] peoples in the Americas and is often portrayed in [[Pre-Columbian art|indigenous art]]. The [[Moche (culture)|Moche]] people often depicted yuca in their ceramics.&lt;ref&gt;Berrin, Katherine &amp; Larco Museum. ''The Spirit of Ancient Peru:Treasures from the [[Larco Museum|Museo Arqueológico Rafael Larco Herrera]].'' New York: [[Thames &amp; Hudson]], 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

Spaniards in their early occupation of Caribbean islands did not want to eat cassava or maize, which they considered insubstantial, dangerous, and not nutritious. They much preferred foods from Spain, specifically wheat bread, olive oil, red wine, and meat, and considered maize and cassava damaging to Europeans. For these Christians in the [[New World]], cassava was not suitable for communion since it could not undergo [[transubstantiation]] and become the body of Christ. "Wheat flour was the symbol of Christianity itself" and colonial-era catechisms stated explicitly that only wheat flour could be used.&lt;ref&gt;Earle, Rebecca (2012) ''The Body of the Conquistador: Food, Race, and the Colonial Experience in Spanish America, 1492–1700''. New York: Cambridge University Press. pp. 54–57, 151. {{ISBN|978-1107693296}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The cultivation and consumption of cassava was nonetheless continued in both Portuguese and Spanish America. Mass production of cassava bread became the first Cuban industry established by the Spanish,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=Rn9LZ2XrIWgC&amp;pg=PA75|title=Conquest and food: consequences of the encounter of two worlds; page 75|author=Long, Janet|publisher=UNAM|date=2003|isbn=978-9703208524}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ships departing to Europe from Cuban ports such as [[Havana]], [[Santiago de Cuba|Santiago]], [[Bayamo]], and [[Baracoa]] carried goods to Spain, but sailors needed to be provisioned for the voyage. The Spanish also needed to replenish their boats with dried meat, water, fruit, and large amounts of cassava bread.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sjsu.edu/faculty/watkins/havana.htm|title=The Economic History of Havana, Cuba: A City So Beautiful and Important It Was Once Worth More Than All of Florida|author=Watkins, Thayer |publisher=San José State University, Department of Economics|date=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sailors complained that it caused them digestive problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Super, John C. |title=Spanish Diet in the Atlantic Crossing|journal=Terra Incognita|volume= 16 |year=1984|pages=60–63}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tropical Cuban weather was not suitable for wheat planting and cassava would not go stale as quickly as regular bread.

Cassava was introduced to Africa by Portuguese traders from Brazil in the 16th century. Around the same period, it was also introduced to Asia through [[Columbian Exchange]] by Portuguese and Spanish traders, planted in their colonies in Goa, Malacca, Eastern Indonesia, Timor and the Philippines. [[Maize]] and cassava are now important staple foods, replacing native African crops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Nweke, Felix I.  |url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/009/a0154e/A0154E02.HTM |chapter=The cassava transformation in Africa|publisher=The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations |place=Rome|year= 2005|title=A review of cassava in Africa with country case studies on Nigeria, Ghana, the United Republic of Tanzania, Uganda and Benin|series =Proceedings of the Validation Forum on the Global Cassava Development Strategy|

==Production==
In 2016, global production of cassava root was 277 million [[tonne]]s, with [[Nigeria]] as the world's largest producer having 21% of the world total (table). Other major growers were [[Thailand]], [[Brazil]], and [[Indonesia]].&lt;ref name=faostat16/&gt;

Cassava is one of the most drought-tolerant crops, can be successfully grown on marginal soils, and gives reasonable yields where many other crops do not grow well. Cassava is well adapted within latitudes 30° north and south of the equator, at elevations between sea level and {{convert|2000|m|abbr=on}} above sea level, in equatorial temperatures, with rainfalls from {{convert|50|mm|abbr=on}} to {{convert|5|m|abbr=on}} annually, and to poor soils with a pH ranging from acidic to alkaline. These conditions are common in certain parts of Africa and South America.

Cassava is a highly-productive crop when considering food calories produced per unit land area, per unit of time. Significantly higher than other staple crops, cassava can produce food calories at rates exceeding 250 kcal/hectare/day, as compared with 176 for rice, 110 for wheat and 200 for maize (corn).

==Economic importance==
{{see also|Tapioca#Production}}

[[File:Manihot esculenta - cross section 2.jpg|thumb|A cross-section of cassava]]

Cassava, [[Yam (vegetable)|yam]]s (''[[Dioscorea]]'' spp.), and [[sweet potato]]es (''Ipomoea batatas'') are important sources of food in the tropics. The cassava plant gives the third-highest yield of [[carbohydrates]] per cultivated area among crop plants, after [[sugarcane]] and [[sugar beet]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gardeningplaces.com/articles/nutrition-per-hectare1.htm Nutrition per Hectare for Staple Crops]. gardeningplaces.com&lt;/ref&gt; Cassava plays a particularly important role in agriculture in developing countries, especially in [[sub-Saharan Africa]], because it does well on poor soils and with low rainfall, and because it is a perennial that can be harvested as required. Its wide harvesting window allows it to act as a famine reserve and is invaluable in managing labor schedules. It offers flexibility to resource-poor farmers because it serves as either a subsistence or a cash crop.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Stone | first1 = G. D. | doi = 10.1086/341532 | title = Both Sides Now | journal = Current Anthropology | volume = 43 | issue = 4 | pages = 611–630 | year = 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Worldwide, 800 million people depend on cassava as their primary food staple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Save and Grow: Cassava|date=2013|publisher=[[Food and Agriculture Organization]]|location=Rome|isbn=978-92-5-107641-5|page=iii|url=http://www.fao.org/3/a-i3278e.pdf|accessdate=27 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  No continent depends as much on root and tuber crops in feeding its population as does Africa. In the humid and sub-humid areas of tropical Africa, it is either a primary staple food or a secondary costaple. In [[Ghana]], for example, cassava and yams occupy an important position in the agricultural economy and contribute about 46 percent of the agricultural gross domestic product. Cassava accounts for a daily caloric intake of 30 percent in [[Ghana]] and is grown by nearly every farming family. The importance of cassava to many Africans is epitomised in the [[Ewe language|Ewe]] (a language spoken in Ghana, [[Togo]] and [[Benin]]) name for the plant, ''agbeli'', meaning "there is life".

In [[Tamil Nadu]], India, there are many cassava processing factories alongside [[National Highway 68 (India)(old numbering)|National Highway 68]] between [[Thalaivasal]] and [[Attur]]. Cassava is widely cultivated and eaten as a staple food in [[Andhra Pradesh]] and in [[Kerala]]. In [[Assam]] it is an important source of carbohydrates especially for natives of hilly areas.

In the subtropical region of southern China, cassava is the fifth-largest crop in term of production, after [[rice]], [[sweet potato]], [[sugar cane]], and [[maize]]. China is also the largest export market for cassava produced in Vietnam and Thailand. Over 60 percent of cassava production in China is concentrated in a single province, [[Guangxi]], averaging over seven million tonnes annually.

[[Alcoholic beverage]]s made from cassava include [[cauim]] and [[tiquira]] (Brazil), [[kasiri]] (Guyana, Suriname), impala (Mozambique), masato (Peruvian [[Chicha#Amazonia|Amazonia chicha]]), [[Cassava#Beverages|parakari]] or kari (Guyana), [[nihamanchi]] (South America) also known as nijimanche (Ecuador and Peru), ö döi (chicha de yuca, Ngäbe-Bugle, Panama), sakurá (Brazil, Suriname), tarul ko jaarh (Darjeeling, Sikkim, India).

===Culinary===
{{main|Cassava-based dishes}}
[[File:Cassava heavy cake.jpg|thumb|right|Cassava heavy cake]]

[[Cassava-based dishes]] are widely consumed wherever the plant is cultivated; some have regional, national, or ethnic importance.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick Douglass Opie, ''Hog and Hominy: Soul Food from Africa to America'', (Columbia University Press 2008), chapters 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt; Cassava must be cooked properly to detoxify it before it is eaten.

Cassava can be cooked in many ways. The root of the sweet variety has a delicate flavor and can replace potatoes. It is used in [[cholent]] in some households. It can be made into a flour that is used in breads, cakes and cookies. In Brazil, detoxified manioc is ground and cooked to a dry, often hard or crunchy meal known as ''farofa'' used as a condiment, toasted in butter, or eaten alone as a side dish.

Raw cassava is 60% water, 38% [[carbohydrates]], 1% [[protein]], and has negligible [[fat]] (table).&lt;ref name="fao"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Global Cassava Development Strategy|year=2004|author=Tewe, Olumide O. |publisher=[[U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization]]|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/007/j1255e/j1255e00.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 100 gram amount, raw cassava provides 160 [[calories]] and contains 25% of the [[Daily Value]] (DV) for [[vitamin C]], but otherwise has no [[micronutrients]] in significant content (no values above 10% DV; table). Cooked cassava starch has a [[digestibility]] of over 75%.&lt;ref name=fao/&gt;

Cassava, like other foods, also has [[antinutrient|antinutritional]] and toxic factors. Of particular concern are the [[Glycoside#Cyanogenic glycosides|cyanogenic glucosides]] of cassava ([[linamarin]] and [[lotaustralin]]). On hydrolysis, these release [[hydrocyanic acid|hydrocyanic acid (HCN)]].{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} The presence of cyanide in cassava is of concern for human and for animal consumption. The concentration of these antinutritional and unsafe glycosides varies considerably between varieties and also with climatic and cultural conditions. Selection of cassava species to be grown, therefore, is quite important. Once harvested, bitter cassava must be treated and prepared properly prior to human or animal consumption, while sweet cassava can be used after simply boiling.

===Comparison with other major staple foods===

A [[Staple food#Part of balanced nutrition|comparative table]] shows that [[Staple food#Part of balanced nutrition|cassava is a good energy source]]. In its prepared forms in which its toxic or unpleasant components have been reduced to acceptable levels, it contains an extremely high proportion of starch.  Compared to most staples however, cassava accordingly is a poorer dietary source of protein and most other essential nutrients. Though an important staple, its main value is as a component of a balanced diet.

Comparisons between the nutrient content of cassava and other major [[staple food]]s when raw, [[Staple food#Part of balanced nutrition|as shown in the table]], must be interpreted with caution because most staples are not edible in such forms and many are indigestible, even dangerously poisonous or otherwise harmful.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} For consumption, each must be prepared and cooked as appropriate. Suitably cooked or otherwise prepared, the nutritional and antinutritional contents of each of these staples is widely different from that of raw form and depends on the methods of preparation such as soaking, fermentation, sprouting, boiling, or baking.

===Biofuel===
In many countries, significant research has begun to evaluate the use of cassava as an [[ethanol]] [[biofuel]] feedstock. Under the Development Plan for Renewable Energy in the [[Eleventh Five-Year Plan (People's Republic of China)|Eleventh Five-Year Plan]] in the [[People's Republic of China]], the target is to increase the production of ethanol fuel from nongrain feedstock to two million tonnes, and that of biodiesel to 200 thousand tonnes by 2010. This is equivalent to the replacement of 10 million tonnes of petroleum. As a result, cassava (tapioca) chips have gradually become a major source of ethanol production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stuartsbrasil.blogspot.com/2009/01/aipim-mandioca-manioc-pao-de-pobre.html|title=Stuart's Brasil|format=Blog|date=30 January 2009|accessdate=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 December 2007, the largest cassava [[ethanol fuel]] production facility was completed in [[Beihai]], with annual output of 200 thousand tons, which would need an average of 1.5 million tons of cassava. In November 2008, China-based Hainan Yedao Group invested US$51.5 million in a new [[wikt:biofuel|biofuel]] facility that is expected to produce {{convert|33|e6USgal|m3}} a year of bioethanol from cassava plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessgreen.com/business-green/news/2229852/bio-ethanol-plant-open-china|title=Cassava bio-ethanol plant to open in China|work=businessGreen|date=5 November 2008|accessdate=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cassava tubers and hay are used worldwide as animal feed. Cassava hay is harvested at a young growth stage (three to four months) when it reaches about {{convert|30|to|45|cm|abbr=on}} above ground; it is then sun-dried for one to two days until its final dry matter content approaches 85 percent. Cassava hay contains high protein (20–27 percent [[Protein (nutrient)|crude protein]]) and condensed [[tannin]]s (1.5–4 percent CP). It is valued as a good roughage source for [[ruminant]]s such as cattle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=R. Lunsin |author2=M. Wanapat |author3=P. Rowlinson |title=Effect of cassava hay and rice bran oil supplementation on rumen fermentation, milk yield and milk composition in lactating dairy cows |journal=Asian-Australasian Journal of Animal Sciences (AAJS) |date=October 2012 |volume=25 |issue=10 |pages=1364–1373 |doi=10.5713/ajas.2012.12051 |pmc=4093022 |pmid=25049491}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Laundry starch===
Manioc is also used in a number of commercially available laundry products, especially as starch for shirts and other garments. Using manioc starch diluted in water and spraying it over fabrics before ironing helps stiffen collars.

===Medicinal use===
According to the [[American Cancer Society]], cassava is [[List of ineffective cancer treatments|ineffective]] as an anti-cancer agent: "there is no convincing scientific evidence that cassava or tapioca is effective in preventing or treating cancer".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Potential toxicity===
Cassava roots, peels and leaves should not be consumed raw because they contain two [[Cyanogenic glycoside|cyanogenic glucosides]], [[linamarin]] and [[lotaustralin]]. These are decomposed by [[linamarase]], a naturally occurring [[enzyme]] in cassava, liberating [[hydrogen cyanide]] (HCN).&lt;ref name="cereda"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Cereda | first1 = M. P. | last2 = Mattos | first2 = M. C. Y. | doi = 10.1590/S0104-79301996000100002 | title = Linamarin: the Toxic Compound of Cassava | journal = Journal of Venomous Animals and Toxins | volume = 2 | year = 1996 | pmid =  | pmc = | pages=06–12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cassava varieties are often categorized as either sweet or bitter, signifying the absence or presence of toxic levels of cyanogenic glucosides, respectively. The so-called sweet (actually not bitter) cultivars can produce as little as 20 milligrams of [[cyanide]] (CN) per kilogram of fresh roots, whereas bitter ones may produce more than 50 times as much (1 g/kg). Cassavas grown during [[drought]] are especially high in these toxins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Aregheore E. M. |author2=Agunbiade O.

Symptoms of acute cyanide intoxication appear four or more hours after ingesting raw or poorly processed cassava: vertigo, vomiting, and collapse. In some cases, death may result within one or two hours. It can be treated easily with an injection of [[thiosulfate]] (which makes sulfur available for the patient's body to detoxify by converting the poisonous cyanide into thiocyanate).&lt;ref name="fao.org"/&gt;

"Chronic, low-level cyanide exposure is associated with the development of [[goiter]] and with tropical ataxic neuropathy, a nerve-damaging disorder that renders a person unsteady and uncoordinated. Severe cyanide poisoning, particularly during famines, is associated with outbreaks of a debilitating, irreversible paralytic disorder called [[konzo]] and, in some cases, death. The incidence of konzo and [[tropical ataxic neuropathy]] can be as high as three percent in some areas."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wagner|first=Holly|title=Cassava's cyanide-producing abilities can cause neuropathy |url=http://www.cidpusa.org/cassava.htm |accessdate=21 June 2010 |publisher=cidpusa.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=J AOAC Int|date=September–October 2007 |volume=90|issue=5|pages=1450–5 |author1=Siritunga D |author2=Sayre RT |title=Transgenic approaches for cyanogen reduction in cassava |pmid=17955993 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[shortages in Venezuela]] in the late-2010s, dozens of deaths were reported due to Venezuelans resorting to eating bitter cassava in order to curb starvation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Castro|first1=Maolis|title=La yuca amarga alimenta la muerte en Venezuela|url=https://elpais.com/internacional/2017/03/05/america/1488744764_611719.html|accessdate=25 February 2018|work=[[El País]]|date=6 March 2017|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Estragos de la crisis: Ocho niños han muerto en Aragua por consumir yuca amarga|url=https://www.lapatilla.com/site/2018/02/22/estragos-de-la-crisis-ocho-ninos-han-muerto-en-aragua-por-consumir-yuca-amarga/|accessdate=25 February 2018|work=[[La Patilla]]|date=22 February 2018|language=es-ES}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Societies that traditionally eat cassava generally understand that some processing (soaking, cooking, fermentation, etc.) is necessary to avoid getting sick. Brief soaking (four hours) of cassava is not sufficient, but soaking for 18–24 hours can remove up to half the level of cyanide. Drying may not be sufficient, either.&lt;ref name="fao.org"/&gt;

[[File:PeeledCassava.jpg|right|thumb|Cassava root, peeled and soaking]]

For some smaller-rooted, sweet varieties, cooking is sufficient to eliminate all toxicity. The cyanide is carried away in the processing water and the amounts produced in domestic consumption are too small to have environmental impact.&lt;ref name="cereda"/&gt; The larger-rooted, bitter varieties used for production of flour or starch must be processed to remove the cyanogenic glucosides. The large roots are peeled and then ground into flour, which is then soaked in water, squeezed dry several times, and toasted. The starch grains that float to the surface during the soaking process are also used in cooking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Padmaja | first1 = G. | last2 = Steinkraus | first2 = K.

Industrial production of cassava flour, even at the cottage level, may generate enough cyanide and cyanogenic glycosides in the effluents to have a severe environmental impact.&lt;ref name="cereda"/&gt;

===Food preparation===
[[File:Cassava bread.jpg|thumb|Cassava bread]]

A safe processing method known as the "wetting method" is to mix the cassava flour with water into a thick paste and then let it stand in the shade for five hours in a thin layer spread over a basket.&lt;ref name="fca"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bradbury|first1=J.H.|title=Simple wetting method to reduce cyanogen content of cassava flour|journal=J Food Composition Analysis|date=2006|volume=19|issue=4|pages=388–393|url=http://biology-assets.anu.edu.au/hosted_sites/CCDN/papers/Howard_06.pdf|doi=10.1016/j.jfca.2005.04.012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that time, about 83% of the cyanogenic [[glycoside]]s are broken down by the [[linamarase]]; the resulting hydrogen cyanide escapes to the atmosphere, making the flour safe for consumption the same evening.&lt;ref name=fca/&gt;

The traditional method used in West Africa is to peel the roots and put them into water for three days to ferment. The roots then are dried or cooked. In Nigeria and several other west African countries, including Ghana, Cameroon, Benin, Togo, Ivory Coast, and Burkina Faso, they are usually grated and lightly fried in palm oil to preserve them. The result is a foodstuff called ''gari''. Fermentation is also used in other places such as Indonesia (see [[Tapai]]). The fermentation process also reduces the level of [[antinutrient]]s, making the cassava a more nutritious food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Oboh G, Oladunmoye MK |title=Biochemical changes in micro-fungi fermented cassava flour produced from low- and medium-cyanide variety of cassava tubers|journal=Nutr Health|volume=18|issue=4|pages=355–67|year=2007|pmid=18087867|doi=10.1177/026010600701800405}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reliance on cassava as a food source and the resulting exposure to the [[goitrogen]]ic effects of [[thiocyanate]] has been responsible for the endemic [[goiter]]s seen in the [[Akoko]] area of southwestern [[Nigeria]].&lt;ref name="pmid10497657"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Akindahunsi AA, Grissom FE, Adewusi SR, Afolabi OA, Torimiro SE, Oke OL |title=Parameters of thyroid function in the endemic goitre of Akungba and Oke-Agbe villages of Akoko area of southwestern Nigeria|journal=African Journal of Medicine and Medical Sciences|volume=27|issue=3–4|pages=239–42|year=1998|pmid=10497657}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=J Neurol Sci |date=15 February 2015 |volume=349 |issue=1–2 |pages=149–53 |doi=10.1016/j.jns.2015.01.007 |vauthors=Bumoko GM, Sadiki NH, Rwatambuga A, Kayembe KP, Okitundu DL, Mumba Ngoyi D, Muyembe JJ, Banea JP, Boivin MJ, Tshala-Katumbay D |title=Lower serum levels of selenium, copper, and zinc are related to neuromotor impairments in children with konzo |pmid=25592410 |pmc=4323625 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Farming==

===Harvesting===
Cassava is harvested by hand by raising the lower part of the stem and pulling the roots out of the ground, then removing them from the base of the plant. The upper parts of the stems with the leaves are plucked off before harvest. Cassava is propagated by cutting the stem into sections of approximately 15&amp;nbsp;cm, these being planted prior to the wet season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Howeler, Reinhardt H. |title=Production techniques for sustainable cassava production in Asia |url=http://ciat-library.ciat.cgiar.org/Articulos_Ciat/07169_Production_techniques_cassava.pdf|year=2007|publisher=Centro Internacional de Agricultura Tropical (CIAT), Bangkok}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cassava undergoes post-harvest physiological deterioration (PPD) once the tubers are separated from the main plant. The tubers, when damaged, normally respond with a healing mechanism. However, the same mechanism, which involves [[coumaric acid]]s, starts about 15 minutes after damage, and fails to switch off in harvested tubers. It continues until the entire tuber is oxidized and blackened within two to three days after harvest, rendering it unpalatable and useless. PPD is related to the accumulation of [[reactive oxygen species]] (ROS) initiated by cyanide release during mechanical harvesting. Cassava shelf life may be increased up to three weeks by overexpressing a cyanide insensitive alternative oxidase, which suppressed ROS by 10-fold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zidenga | first1 = T | display-authors = etal  | year = 2012 | title = Extending cassava root shelf life via reduction of reactive oxygen species production | journal = Plant Physiology | volume = 159 | issue = 4| pages = 1396–1407 | doi=10.1104/pp.112.200345 | pmid=22711743 | pmc=3425186}}&lt;/ref&gt; PPD is one of the main obstacles  preventing farmers from exporting cassavas abroad and generating income. Fresh cassava can be preserved like potato, using [[thiabendazole]] or bleach as a fungicide, then wrapping in plastic, coating in wax or freezing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/x5415e/x5415e04.htm |title=Storage and processing of roots and tubers in the tropics |publisher=[[U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization]] |accessdate=4 May 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While alternative methods for PPD control have been proposed, such as preventing ROS effects by use of plastic bags during storage and transport or coating the roots with wax, and freezing roots, such strategies have proved to be economically or technically impractical, leading to [[plant breeding|breeding]] of cassava varieties more tolerant to PPD and with improved durability after harvest.&lt;ref name="gmr"&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=27173317|year=2016|author1=Venturini|first1=M.

These pests were rampant in the 1970s and 1980s but were brought under control following the establishment of the "Biological Control Centre for Africa" of the [[International Institute of Tropical Agriculture]] (IITA) under the leadership of [[Hans Rudolf Herren]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldfoodprize.org/en/laureates/19871999_laureates/1995_herren/ |title=1995: Herren |publisher=The World Food Prize Foundation|accessdate=29 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Centre investigated [[biological control]] for cassava pests; two [[South America]]n natural enemies ''[[Apoanagyrus lopezi]]'' (a [[parasitoid]] wasp) and ''[[Typhlodromalus]] aripo'' (a predatory mite) were found to effectively control the cassava mealybug and the cassava green mite, respectively.

A wide range of plant parasitic nematodes have been reported associated with cassava worldwide. These include ''[[Pratylenchus brachyurus]]'', ''[[Rotylenchulus reniformis]]'', ''[[Helicotylenchus]]'' spp., ''[[Scutellonema]]'' spp. and ''[[Root-knot nematode|Meloidogyne]]'' spp., of which ''[[Meloidogyne incognita]]'' and ''[[Meloidogyne javanica]]'' are the most widely reported and economically important.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Mc Sorley, R.|author2=Ohair, S.

Galls later merge as the females grow and enlarge, and they interfere with water and nutrient supply.&lt;ref name=Gapasin/&gt; Cassava roots become tough with age and restrict the movement of the juveniles and the egg release.

'''Cintel''' was a British [[digital cinema]] company founded in 1927 by [[John Logie Baird]] and based in [[Ware, Hertfordshire|Ware]], [[Hertfordshire]]. The early company was called ''Cinema Television Ltd''. Cinema Television was sold to J Arthur Rank Organization renamed Rank Cintel in 1958. It specialized in the design and manufacture of professional [[post-production]] equipment, for transcribing film into video or data formats. It was formerly part of the [[Rank Organisation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earlytelevision.org/rank_cintel_crt.html earlytelevision.org, cathode ray tube Rank Cintel]&lt;/ref&gt; Along with a line of [[telecine|telecines]], Rank Cintel made 3 tube RGB color video projectors in the 1960s.

Their main products were based on either [[cathode ray tube]] (CRT) or [[charge coupled device]] (CCD) technology and include, like the diTTo, diTTo Evolution &amp; dataMill film scanners, Millennium II, Millennium HD &amp; C-Reality &amp; DSX telecines, imageMill 1 &amp; 2 image processing system. The CRT tubes were made by Rank and Brimar. In September 2002 Cintel purchased ITK - '''Innovation TK Ltd'''. ITK held a number of patents for features used in Cintel products and also made the competitive unit the Millennium telecine. ITK founded in 1994, also made upgrade products include the TWiGi system, the SCAN’dAL, and the Y-Front.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shots.net/news/article/60126/cintel-snaps-up-itk-assets shots.net, Cintel snaps up ITK, 18 September 2002]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-93450571.html highbeam.com, Cintel purchases ITK, 2002]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/cintel-buys-itk-assets/1155974.article broadcastnow.co.uk Cintel buys ITK assets, 16 September, 2002]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many movies and TV shows for TV were transferred from film to TV on Cintel Telecines. Cintel saw reduced sales with the introduction of [[Spirit DataCine]] in 1996. The business was in administration until its announced liquidation. On July 24, 2012 [[Blackmagic Design]] acquired the assets of Cintel.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/cintel blackmagicdesign.com cintel]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Business administration}}

'''Customer-relationship management''' ('''CRM''') is an approach to manage a company's interaction with current and potential [[customers]]. It uses [[data analysis]] about customers' history with a company to improve business relationships with customers, specifically focusing on [[customer retention]] and ultimately driving [[sales]] growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Management Tools - Customer Relationship Management - Bain &amp; Company|url = http://www.bain.com/publications/articles/management-tools-customer-relationship-management.aspx|website = www.bain.com|accessdate = 23 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One important aspect of the CRM approach is the systems of CRM that compile [[data]] from a range of different communication channels, including a company's website, telephone, email, live chat, marketing materials and more recently, social media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Computer Aided Marketing &amp; Selling|last = Shaw|first = Robert|publisher = Butterworth Heinemann|year = 1991|isbn = 978-0-7506-1707-9|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the CRM approach and the systems used to facilitate it, businesses learn more about their target audiences and how to best cater to their needs.

==Software history==
The concept of customer-relationship management started in the early 1970s, when customer satisfaction was evaluated using annual surveys or by front-line asking.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} At that time, businesses had to rely on [[Mainframe computer|standalone mainframe systems]] to automate sales, but the extent of technology allowed them to categorize customers in [[spreadsheet]]s and lists. In 1982, Kate and Robert D. Kestnbaum introduced the concept of [[Database marketing]], namely applying statistical methods to analyze and gather customer data.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}} By 1986, [[Pat Sullivan (programmer)|Pat Sullivan]] and [[Mike Muhney]] released a customer evaluation system called [[Act! CRM|ACT!]] based on the principle of digital rolodex, which offered a contact management service for the first time.

The trend was followed by numerous developers trying to maximize leads' potential, including [[Thomas Siebel|Tom Siebel]], who designed the first CRM product [[Siebel Systems]] in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.nojitter.com/post/240172247/how-context-sits-at-intersection-of-crm-acd|title=How Context Sits at Intersection of CRM, ACD|access-date=8 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, customer relationship management popularized in 1997, due to the work of Siebel, [[Gartner]], and [[IBM]]. Between 1997 and 2000, leading CRM products were enriched with [[enterprise resource planning]] functions, and shipping and marketing capabilities.&lt;ref name="COMP"&gt;{{cite news|title=History of CRM Software|url=http://comparecamp.com/introduction-history-crm-software/|accessdate=8 February 2017|publisher=''comparecamp.com''|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Siebel introduced the first mobile CRM app called Siebel Sales Handheld in 1999. The idea of a cloud-hosted and moveable customer bases was soon adopted by other leading providers at the time, including [[PeopleSoft]], [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]], and SAP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NbnZwhUjlF0C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Customer Relationship Management: A Strategic Approach|author=Lakshman Jha|access-date=8 June 2017|isbn=9788190721127|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first open-source CRM system was developed by [[SugarCRM]] in 2004. During this period, CRM was rapidly migrating to cloud, as a result of which it became accessible to sole entrepreneurs and small teams. This increase in accessibility generated a huge wave of price reduction.&lt;ref name="COMP"/&gt; Around 2009, developers began considering the options to profit from social media's momentum, and designed tools to help companies become accessible on all users' favorite networks. Many startups at the time benefited from this trend to provide exclusively [[social CRM]] solutions, including [[Base CRM|Base]] and [[Nutshell CRM|Nutshell]].&lt;ref name="COMP"/&gt; The same year, Gartner organized and held the first Customer Relationship Management Summit, and summarized the features systems should offer to be classified as CRM solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gartner Announces Customer Relationship Management Summit 2009|url=http://www.gartner.com/newsroom/id/1114712|accessdate=8 February 2017|publisher=''gartner.com''|date=5 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 and 2014, most of the popular CRM products were linked to business intelligence systems and communication software to improve corporate communication and end-users' experience. The leading trend is to replace standardized CRM solutions with industry-specific ones, or to make them customizable enough to meet the needs of every business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Industry Specific/Vertical Market CRM Solutions|url=http://www.smallbizcrm.com/vertical-market-crm/|accessdate=8 February 2017|publisher=''smallbizcrm.com''|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2016, ''Forrester'' released a report where it "identified the nine most significant CRM suites from eight prominent vendors," among them companies such as [[Infor]], [[Microsoft]], and NetSuite.&lt;ref name=forrester-crm&gt;{{Citation|date=November 21, 2016 |title=The Forrester Wave: CRM Suites For Enterprise Organizations, Q4 2016 |publisher=''[[Forrester Research|Forrester]]'' |url=https://www.forrester.com/report/The+Forrester+Wave+CRM+Suites+For+Enterprise+Organizations+Q4+2016/-/E-RES129311 |accessdate=September 13, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==
=== Strategic ===
Strategic CRM is focused upon the development of a customer-centric business culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=slGhBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA5#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | title=Customer Relationship Management: Concepts and Technologies| isbn=9781317654766| last1=Buttle| first1=Francis| last2=Maklan| first2=Stan| date=2015-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Operational ===
The primary goal of customer relationship management systems is to integrate and [[Business process automation|automate]] sales, marketing, and customer support. Therefore, these systems typically have a dashboard that gives an overall view of the three functions on a [[single customer view]], a single page for each customer that a company may have. The dashboard may provide client information, past sales, previous marketing efforts, and more, summarizing all of the relationships between the customer and the firm. Operational CRM is made up of 3 main components: sales force automation, marketing automation, and service automation.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Types of CRM and Examples {{!}} CRM Software|url = http://www.crmsoftware.com/types-of-crm-and-examples/|website = www.crmsoftware.com|accessdate = 22 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Sales force management system|Sales force automation]] works with all stages in the sales cycle, from initially entering contact information to converting a prospective client into an actual client.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = What is sales force automation (SFA)? - Definition from WhatIs.com|url = http://whatis.techtarget.com/definition/sales-force-automation-SFA|website = WhatIs.com|accessdate = 26 November 2015|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; It implements [[sales promotion]] analysis, automates the tracking of a client's account history for repeated sales or future sales and coordinates sales, marketing, call centers, and retail outlets. It prevents duplicate efforts between a salesperson and a customer and also automatically tracks all contacts and follow-ups between both parties&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Customer relationship management|last=Buttle|first=Francis|publisher=Routledge|year=2003|isbn=9781136412578|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
* [[Marketing automation]] focuses on easing the overall marketing process to make it more effective and efficient. CRM tools with marketing automation capabilities can automate repeated tasks, for example, sending out automated marketing emails at certain times to customers, or posting marketing information on social media. The goal with marketing automation is to turn a sales lead into a full customer. CRM systems today also work on [[customer engagement]] through social media.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|title = What is customer relationship management (CRM) ? - Definition from WhatIs.com|url = http://searchcrm.techtarget.com/definition/CRM|website = SearchCRM|accessdate = 22 November 2015|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Service automation is the part of the CRM system that focuses on direct customer service technology. Through service automation, customers are supported through multiple channels such as phone, email, knowledge bases, ticketing portals, FAQs, and more.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt;

=== Analytical ===
The role of analytical CRM systems is to analyze customer data collected through multiple sources and present it so that business managers can make more informed decisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Josiah |first1=Ahaiwe |last2=Ikenna |first2=Oluigbo |date=February 2015 |title=Role of Technology in Accounting and E-accounting |url=http://www.academia.edu/12111029/The_Relevance_of_Analytical_CRM_and_Knowledge_Management_in_an_Organisation_A_Data_Mining_Structure |journal=International Journal of Computer Science and Mobile Computing |volume=4 |issue=2 |pages=208-215 |doi=  |access-date=27 October 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Analytical CRM systems use techniques such as data mining, correlation, and pattern recognition to analyze the customer data. These analytics help improve customer service by finding small problems which can be solved, perhaps, by marketing to different parts of a consumer audience differently.&lt;ref name=":02"/&gt; For example, through the analysis of a customer base's buying behavior, a company might see that this customer base has not been buying a lot of products recently. After scanning through this data, the company might think to market to this subset of consumers differently, in order to best communicate how this company's products might benefit this group specifically.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Definition - www.smartcrm.com|url = http://www.smartcrm.com/definition/items/analytical_CRM.html|website = www.smartcrm.com|accessdate = 26 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Collaborative ===
The third primary aim of CRM systems is to incorporate external stakeholders such as suppliers, vendors, and distributors, and share customer information across groups/departments and organisations. For example, feedback can be collected from technical support calls, which could help provide direction for marketing products and services to that particular customer in the future.&lt;ref name=":23"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Theoretical Models of Customer Relationship Management in Organizations|author1=Tavana, Ali Feizbakhsh. |author2=Fili, Saeed. |author3=Tohidy, Alireza. |author4=Vaghari, Reza. |author5= Kakouie, Saed. |last-author-amp=yes|date = November 2013 |journal = International Journal of Business and Behavioral Sciences|volume=3|issue=11|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Customer data platform===
A [[customer data platform]] (CDP) is a computer system used by marketing departments that assembles data about individual people from various sources into one database, with which other software systems can interact.&lt;ref name=ZDnet/&gt;  As of February 2017 there were about twenty companies selling such systems and revenue for them was around US$300&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name=ZDnet&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/introduction-to-customer-data-platforms/|title=How customer data platforms can benefit your business|last=Greenberg|first=Paul|work=ZDNet|date=February 13, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Components ==
[[File:CRMTypesComponents2.png|thumb|Components in the different types of CRM&lt;ref name=":23"/&gt;]]The main components of CRM are building and managing customer relationships through marketing, observing relationships as they mature through distinct phases, managing these relationships at each stage and recognizing that the distribution of value of a relationship to the firm is not homogenous. When building and managing customer relationships through marketing, firms might benefit from using a variety of tools to help organizational design, incentive schemes, customer structures, and more to optimize the reach of its marketing campaigns. Through the acknowledgement of the distinct phases of CRM, businesses will be able to benefit from seeing the interaction of multiple relationships as connected transactions. The final factor of CRM highlights the importance of CRM through accounting for the profitability of customer relationships. Through studying the particular spending habits of customers, a firm may be able to dedicate different resources and amounts of attention to different types of consumers.&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The Customer Relationship Management Process: Its Measurement and Impact on Performance|last1=Reinartz |first1=Werner |last2=Krafft |first2=Manfred |last3=Hoyer |first3=Wayne D. |date = August 2004|journal = Journal of Marketing Research|doi = 10.1509/jmkr.41.3.293.35991|pmid = |volume = 41 |issue = 3 |pages = 293–305}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Relational Intelligence, or awareness of the variety of relationships a customer can have with a firm, is an important component to the main phases of CRM. Companies may be good at capturing [[demographic data]], such as gender, age, income, and education, and connecting them with purchasing information to categorize customers into [[profitability]] tiers, but this is only a firm's mechanical view of customer relationships.&lt;ref name=":72"&gt;{{Cite web|title = What's Your Relational Intelligence?|url = http://www.strategy-business.com/article/15103?gko=5de4a|website = strategy+business|accessdate = 23 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This therefore is a sign that firms believe that customers are still resources that can be used for [[up-selling|up-sell]] or [[cross-sell]] opportunities, rather than humans looking for interesting and personalized interactions.&lt;ref name=":45"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Unlock the Mysteries of Your Customer Relationships|url = https://hbr.org/2014/07/unlock-the-mysteries-of-your-customer-relationships|website = Harvard Business Review|accessdate = 22 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CRM systems include:

* [[Data warehouse]] technology, used to aggregate transaction information, to merge the information with CRM products, and to provide key performance indicators.
* [[Opportunity management]] which helps the company to manage unpredictable growth and demand, and implement a good forecasting model to integrate sales history with sales projections.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Customer relationship management (CRM) in business‐to‐business (B2B) e‐commercenull|journal = Information Management &amp; Computer Security|date = 1 March 2003|issn = 0968-5227|pages = 39–44|volume = 11|issue = 1|doi = 10.1108/09685220310463722|last1 = Zeng|first1 = Yun E|last2 = Wen|first2 = H. Joseph|last3 = Yen|first3 = David C}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* CRM systems that track and measure marketing campaigns over multiple networks, tracking customer analysis by customer clicks and sales.
* Some CRM software is available as a [[software as a service]] (SaaS), delivered via the internet and accessed via a web browser instead of being installed on a local computer. Businesses using the software do not purchase it, but typically pay a recurring subscription fee to the software vendor.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;
* For small businesses a CRM system may consist of a contact manager system that integrates emails, documents, jobs, faxes, and scheduling for individual accounts.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; CRM systems available for specific markets (legal, finance) frequently focus on event management and relationship tracking as opposed to financial [[return on investment]] (ROI).
* CRM systems for [[eCommerce]], focused on marketing automation tasks, like: cart rescue, re-engage users with email, personalization.
* Customer-centric relationship management (CCRM) is a nascent sub-discipline that focuses on customer preferences instead of customer leverage. CCRM aims to add value by engaging customers in individual, interactive relationships.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;
* Systems for non-profit and membership-based organizations help track constituents, fundraising, sponsors' demographics, membership levels, membership directories, volunteering and communication with individuals.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Got Softwares -Complete ERP Solutions|url = http://gotsoftwares.com/crm/|website = gotsoftwares.com|accessdate = 22 November 2015|first = WebMan -|last = www.webmandesign.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Effect on customer satisfaction==
[[Customer satisfaction]] has important implications for the economic performance of firms because it has the ability to increase customer loyalty and usage behavior and reduce customer complaints and the likelihood of customer defection.&lt;ref&gt;Bolton, Ruth N. (1998), “A Dynamic Model of the Duration of the Customer's Relationship with a Continuous Service Provider: The Role of Satisfaction,” Marketing Science, 17 (1), 45–65.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fornell, Claes (1992), "A National Customer Satisfaction Barometer: The Swedish Experience", Journal of Marketing, 56 (January), 6-22&lt;/ref&gt; The implementation of a CRM approach is likely to have an effect on customer satisfaction and customer knowledge for a variety of different reasons.

Firstly, firms are able to customize their offerings for each customer.&lt;ref name=":112"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Why Do Customer Relationship Management Applications Affect Customer Satisfaction?|author1=Mithas, Sunil. |author2=Krishnan, M.S. |author3= Fornell, Claes |last-author-amp=yes |date = October 2005|journal = Journal of Marketing|volume=69|issue=4|pages=201–209|doi = 10.1509/jmkg.2005.69.4.201 |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt; By accumulating information across customer interactions and processing this information to discover hidden patterns, CRM applications help firms customize their offerings to suit the individual tastes of their customers.&lt;ref name=":112" /&gt; This customization enhances the perceived quality of products and services from a customer's viewpoint, and because perceived quality is a determinant of customer satisfaction, it follows that CRM applications indirectly affect customer satisfaction. CRM applications also enable firms to provide timely, accurate processing of customer orders and requests and the ongoing management of customer accounts.&lt;ref name=":112" /&gt; For example, Piccoli and Applegate discuss how Wyndham uses IT tools to deliver a consistent service [[customer experience|experience]] across its various properties to a customer. Both an improved ability to customize and a reduced variability of the consumption experience enhance perceived quality, which in turn positively affects customer satisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;Piccoli, Gabriele and L. Applegate (2003), "Wyndham International: Fostering High-Touch with High-Tech", Case Study No. 9-803-092, Harvard Business School&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, CRM applications also help firms manage customer relationships more effectively across the stages of relationship initiation, maintenance, and termination.&lt;ref&gt;Piccoli, Gabriele and L. Applegate (2003), "Wyndham International: Fostering High-Touch with High-Tech", Case Study No. 9-803-092, Harvard Business School.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Customer benefits ===
With Customer relationship management systems customers are served better on day to day process and with more reliable information their demand of [[self service]] from companies will decrease. If there is less need to interact with the company for different problems, [[customer satisfaction]] level increases.&lt;ref&gt;Business Strategy;, 1999.22. Leach, B., Success of CRM systems hinges on establishment of measureable benefits. Pulp &amp; Paper 2003. 77(6): p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; These central benefits of CRM will be connected hypothetically to the three kinds of equity that are relationship, value and brand, and in the end to [[customer equity]]. Eight benefits were recognized to provide value drivers.&lt;ref&gt;Richards, A. Keith, and E. Jones, Customer relationship management: Finding value drivers. Industrial Marketing Management, 2008. 37(2): p.120-130.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Enhanced ability to [[:wikt:targeting|target]] profitable customers.
# Integrated assistance across channels
# Enhanced [[sales|sales force]] efficiency and effectiveness
# Improved [[pricing]]
# Customized products and services
# Improved customer service efficiency and effectiveness
# Individualized marketing messages also called campaigns 
# Connect customers and all channels on a single platform.&amp;nbsp; 
In 2012, after reviewing the previous studies, someone selected some of those benefits which are more significant in customer's satisfaction and summarized them into the following cases:&lt;ref&gt;Mohammadhossein, N., &amp; Zakaria, N. H. (2012). Customer relationship management  Benefits for Customers: Literature Review (2005-2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

# Improve customer services: In general, customers would have some questions, concerns or requests. CRM services provide the ability to a company for producing, allocating and managing requests or something made by customers. For example, [[call center]] software, which helps to connect a customer to the manager or person who can best assist them with their existing problem, is one of the CRM abilities that can be implemented to increase efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;Bolte, T. Still Struggling to Reduce Call Center Costs Without Losing Customers ? 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Increased personalized service or one-to-one service: [[Personalization|Personalizing]] customer service or one-to-one service provides companies to improve understanding and gaining knowledge of the customers and also to have better knowledge about their customers' preferences, requirements and demands.
# Responsive to customer's needs: Customers' situations and needs can be understood by the firms focusing on customer needs and requirements.&lt;ref&gt;Silverman, L.L., CUSTOMERS: RESPONSIVENESS, FOCUS, OR OBSESSION? The Australasian Powder Coater Painter-Fabricator, 2000. 29(2).&lt;/ref&gt;
# Customer segmentation: In CRM, [[Market segmentation|segmentation]] is used to [[categorize]] customers, according to some similarity, such as industry, job or some other characteristics, into similar groups.&lt;ref&gt;Collica, R.S., CRM Segmentation and Clustering Using SAS Enterprise Miner.2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Although these characteristics, can be one or more attributes. It can be defined as a subdividing the customers based on already known good discriminator.
# Improve customization of marketing: Meaning of customization of marketing is that, the firm or organization adapt and change its services or products based on presenting a different and unique product or services for each customer. With the purpose of ensuring that customer needs and requirements are met Customization is used by the organization. Companies can put investment in information from customers and then customize their products or services to maintain customer interests.
# Multichannel integration: [[Multichannel marketing|Multichannel]] integration shows the point of co creation of customer value in CRM. On the other hand, a company's skill to perform multichannel integration successfully, is heavily dependent on the organization's ability getting together customer information from all channels and incorporate it with other related information.&lt;ref&gt;Adrian Payne, P.F., A Strategic Framework for Customer Relationship Management. Journal of Marketing, 2005.69.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Time saving: CRM will let companies to interact with customers more frequently, by personalized message and communication way which can be produced rapidly and matched on a timely basis, and finally they can better understand their customers and therefore look forward to their needs.&lt;ref&gt;Corie. The Top 5 Time-Saving Benefits of CRM. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
# Improve customer knowledge: Firms can make and improve products and services through the information from tracking (e.g. via [[website tracking]]) [[customer behaviour]] to customer tastes and needs.&lt;ref&gt;Nambisan, S., Designing Virtual Customer Environment for New Product Development: Toward a Theory. Academy of Management Review, 2002. 27(3).&lt;/ref&gt; CRM could contribute to a competitive advantage in improving firm's ability of customer information collecting to customize products and services according to customer needs.

=== Examples ===
Research has found a 5% increase in customer retention boosts lifetime customer profits by 50% on average across multiple industries, as well as a boost of up to 90% within specific industries such as insurance.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|title = The story behind successful CRM - Bain &amp; Company|url = http://www.bain.com/publications/articles/the-story-behind-successful-crm.aspx|website = www.bain.com|accessdate = 23 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Companies that have mastered customer relationship strategies have the most successful CRM programs. For example, [[MBNA]] Europe has had a 75% annual profit growth since 1995. The firm heavily invests in screening potential cardholders. Once proper clients are identified, the firm retains 97% of its profitable customers. They implement CRM by marketing the right products to the right customers. The firm's customers' card usage is 52% above industry norm, and the average expenditure is 30% more per transaction. Also 10% of their account holders ask for more information on cross-sale products.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

[[Amazon.com|Amazon]] has also seen great success through its customer proposition. The firm implemented personal greetings, collaborative filtering, and more for the customer. They also used CRM training for the employees to see up to 80% of customers repeat.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

==Customer profile==
{{see|Consumer behaviour|Biology and consumer behaviour|Buying decision}}
Customer or consumer profiles are the essence of the [[customer data|data]] that is collected alongside core data (name, address, company) and processed through [[customer analytics]] methods, essentially a type of [[profiling (information science)|profiling]]. A customer is abstracted to information that sums up [[consumption (economics)|consumption]] habits so far and [[extrapolation|projects them into the future]] so that they can be grouped for marketing and [[advertising]] purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=DeVault | first=Gigi | title=Wondering How to Create the Ideal Consumer Profile? Learn the Basics | website=The Balance Small Business | date=2012-03-28 | url=https://www.thebalancesmb.com/consumer-profile-defining-the-ideal-customer-2296932 | ref=harv | access-date=2018-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Improving CRM within a firm ==
Consultants, such as [[Bain &amp; Company]], argue that it is important for companies establishing strong CRM systems to improve their relational intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = A Dozen Simple Ways to Improve Customer Relations - Enterprise Apps Today|url = http://www.enterpriseappstoday.com/crm/ways-to-improve-customer-relations-1.html|website = www.enterpriseappstoday.com|accessdate = 23 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this argument, a company must recognize that people have many different types of relationships with different brands. One research study analyzed relationships between consumers in China, Germany, Spain, and the United States, with over 200 brands in 11 industries including airlines, cars and media. This information is valuable as it provides demographic, behavioral, and value-based customer segmentation. These types of relationships can be both positive and negative. Some customers view themselves as friends of the brands, while others as enemies, and some are mixed with a love-hate relationship with the brand. Some relationships are distant, intimate or anything in between.&lt;ref name=":45"/&gt;

=== Analyzing the information ===
Managers must understand the different reasons for the types of relationships, and provide the customer with what they are looking for. Companies can [[data collection|collect]] this information by using [[survey (human research)|surveys]], interviews, and more, with current customers. For example, [[Frito-Lay]] conducted many [[ethnographic]] interviews with customers to try and understand the relationships they wanted with the companies and the brands. They found that most customers were adults who used the product to feel more playful. They may have enjoyed the company's bright orange color, messiness and shape.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Companies must also improve their relational intelligence of their CRM systems. These days, companies store and receive huge amounts of data through [[email]]s, [[online chat]] sessions, phone calls, and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = A CRM success story|url = http://www.computerworld.com/article/2578532/crm/a-crm-success-story.html|website = Computerworld|accessdate = 23 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many companies do not properly make use of this great amount of data, however. All of these are signs of what types of relationships the customer wants with the firm, and therefore companies may consider investing more time and effort in building out their relational intelligence.&lt;ref name=":72"/&gt; Companies can use [[data mining]] technologies and [[web search]]es to understand relational signals. [[Social media]] such as Facebook, Twitter, [[blog]]s, etc. is also a very important factor in picking up and analyzing information. Understanding the customer and capturing this data allows companies to convert customer's signals into information and knowledge that the firm can use to understand a potential customer's desired relations with a brand.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Avery, Jill. (2014). "Unlock the Mysteries of Your Customer Relationships", Harvard Business Review. August 2014. https://hbr.org/2014/07/unlock-the-mysteries-of-your-customer-relationships Retrieved: 20 November 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also very important to analyze all of this information to determine which relationships prove the most valuable. This helps convert data into profits for the firm. Stronger bonds contribute to building [[market share]]. By managing different portfolios for different segments of the customer base, the firm can achieve strategic goals.{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

=== Employee training ===
Many firms have also implemented training programs to teach employees how to recognize and effectively create strong customer-brand relationships. For example, [[Harley Davidson]] sent its employees on the road with customers, who were motorcycle enthusiasts, to help solidify relationships. Other employees have also been trained in [[social psychology]] and the [[social science]]s to help bolster strong customer relationships. [[Customer service]] representatives must be educated to value customer relationships, and trained to understand existing customer profiles. Even the finance and legal departments should understand how to manage and build relationships with customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 9 Ways to Improve Your Company's CRM System|url = http://www.cio.com/article/2376209/enterprise-software/9-ways-to-improve-your-company-s-crm-system.html|website = CIO|accessdate = 23 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Application ===
Applying new technologies while using CRM systems requires changes in infrastructure of the organization as well as deployment of new technologies such as business rules, [[database]]s and [[information technology]].&lt;ref name=":6"/&gt;

==In practice==

===Call centers===
[[Call centre|Contact center]] CRM providers are popular for small and mid-market businesses. These systems codify the interactions between company and customers by using analytics and [[key performance indicator]]s to give the users information on where to focus their marketing and customer service. This allows agents to have access to a caller's history to provide personalized customer communication. The intention is to maximize [[average revenue per user]], decrease [[churn rate]] and decrease idle and unproductive contact with the customers.&lt;ref name=sap1&gt;SAP Insider (15 November 2007) [http://www.sdn.sap.com/irj/scn/go/portal/prtroot/docs/library/uuid/e044e180-8375-2a10-a2b2-b5709ea68ccb Still Struggling to Reduce Call Center Costs Without Losing Customers?]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.genesys.com/definitions/what-is-contact-center-crm| title=What Is Contact Center CRM?| author=Genesys}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.networkworld.com/article/3176118/software/the-contact-center-and-crm-collision-leads-to-a-new-dominant-species.html| title=The contact center and CRM collision leads to a new dominant species| author=Network World}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Growing in popularity is the idea of gamifying, or using game design elements and game principles in a non-game environment such as customer service environments. The gamification of customer service environments includes providing elements found in games like rewards and bonus points to customer service representatives as a method of feedback for a job well done.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Gamification Comes to the Contact Center|url = http://www.destinationcrm.com/Articles/ReadArticle.aspx?ArticleID=93677|website = CRM Magazine|accessdate = 26 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Gamification]] tools can motivate agents by tapping into their desire for rewards, recognition, achievements, and competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CRM in Customer Service|url = http://www.destinationcrm.com/Articles/ReadArticle.aspx?ArticleID=99909|website = CRM Magazine|accessdate = 22 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contact-center automation===
Contact-center [[automation]], the practice of having an integrated system that coordinates contacts between an organization and the public, is designed to reduce the repetitive and tedious parts of a contact center agent's job. Automation prevents this by having pre-recorded audio messages that help customers solve their problems. For example, an automated contact center may be able to re-route a customer through a series of commands asking him or her to select a certain number in order to speak with a particular contact center agent who specializes in the field in which the customer has a question.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Contact center automation takes flight|url = http://searchcrm.techtarget.com/tip/Contact-center-automation-takes-flight|website = SearchCRM|accessdate = 26 November 2015|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Software tools can also integrate with the agent's desktop tools to handle customer questions and requests. This also saves time on behalf of the employees.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt;

=== Social media ===
[[Social CRM]] involves the use of social media and technology to engage and learn from consumers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = 7 Ways CRM Can Increase Your Sales [Infographic]|url = https://www.salesforce.com/blog/2013/03/accounting-crm-increase-sales-productivity.html|website = Salesforce Blog|accessdate = 23 November 2015|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the public, especially young people, are increasingly using social networking sites, companies use&lt;ref name=":45"/&gt; these sites to draw attention to their products, services and brands, with the aim of building up customer relationships to increase demand.

Some CRM systems integrate social media sites like Twitter, LinkedIn and Facebook to track and communicate with customers. These customers also share their own opinions and experiences with a company's products and services, giving these firms more insight. Therefore, these firms can both share their own opinions and also track the opinions of their customers.&lt;ref name=":23"/&gt;

Enterprise feedback management software platforms, such as Confirmit, Medallia, and Satmetrix, combine internal survey data with trends identified through social media to allow businesses to make more accurate decisions on which products to supply.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Customer relationship management from theory to practice: Implementation steps|last = Prasongsukarn|first = Kriengsin|date = 2006|journal = Inspire Research Company|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Location-based services ===

CRM systems can also include technologies that create geographic marketing campaigns. The systems take in information based on a customer's physical location and sometimes integrates it with popular location-based GPS applications. It can be used for networking or contact management as well to help increase sales based on location.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

===Business-to-business transactions===
Despite the general notion that CRM systems were created for the customer-centric businesses, they can also be applied to B2B environments to streamline and improve customer management conditions. For the best level of CRM operation in a B2B environment, the software must be personalized and delivered at individual levels.&lt;ref name=Henderson&gt;Rebekah Henderson, ''B2B Insights'' (2013) [http://www.b2binsights.com/how-to-build-a-b2b-friendly-crm/ How to build a B2B-friendly CRM]&lt;/ref&gt;

The main differences between business-to-consumer (B2C) and [[business-to-business]] CRM systems concern aspects like sizing of contact databases and length of relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = B2B Marketing: What Makes It Special? {{!}} B2B International|url = https://www.b2binternational.com/publications/b2b-marketing/|website = B2B International|accessdate = 22 November 2015|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Business-to-business companies tend to have smaller contact databases than business-to-consumer, the volume of sales in business-to-business is relatively small. There are fewer figure propositions in business-to-business, but in some cases, they cost a lot more than business-to-consumer items and relationships in business-to-business environment are built over a longer period of time. Furthermore, business-to-business CRM must be easily integrated with products from other companies. Such integration enables the creation of forecasts about customer behavior based on their buying history, bills, business success, etc. An application for a business-to-business company must have a function to connect all the contacts, processes and deals among the customers segment and then prepare a paper. Automation of sales process is an important requirement for business-to-business products. It should effectively manage the deal and progress it through all the phases towards signing. Finally, a crucial point is personalization. It helps the business-to-business company to create and maintain strong and long-lasting relationship with the customer.

The four largest vendors with CRM system offerings are [[Salesforce.com|Salesforce]], [[SAP SE|SAP]], [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]], and [[Microsoft]], which represented 42 percent of the market in 2015.&lt;ref name = Forbes2015/&gt; Other providers also are popular for small and mid market businesses. Splitting CRM providers into nine different categories (Enterprise CRM Suite, Midmarket CRM Suite, Small-Business CRM Suite, [[Sales force management system|sales force automation]], incentive management, marketing solutions, [[business intelligence]], [[data quality]], [[Consultant|consultancies]]), each category has a different market leader. Additionally, applications often focus on professional fields such as [[Health care|healthcare]], [[manufacturing]], and other areas with branch-specific requirements.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

==Market trends==
In the Gartner CRM Summit 2010 challenges like "system tries to capture data from social networking traffic like Twitter, handles Facebook page addresses or other online social networking sites" were discussed and solutions were provided that would help in bringing more clientele.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hcltech.com/sites/default/files/CRM_Trends_Insurance.pdf CRM Trends in Insurance Industry]''CRM Trends in Insurance Industry'': April 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Many CRM vendors offer subscription-based web tools ([[cloud computing]]) and SaaS. Some CRM systems are equipped with mobile capabilities, making information accessible to remote sales staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Integrating your Phone Systems with your CRM - Manage your Sales and Customer Effectively - Hybrid TP|url = http://www.hybridtp.ie/integrating-your-phone-systems-with-your-crm-manage-your-sales-and-customer-effectively/|website = Hybrid TP|accessdate = 30 November 2015|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Salesforce.com]] was the first company to provide enterprise applications through a web browser, and has maintained its leadership position.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pcworld.com/article/193463/put_cloud_crm_to_work.html Put Cloud CRM to Work] ''PC World'': April 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional providers have recently moved into the cloud-based market via acquisitions of smaller providers: [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]] purchased [[RightNow]] in October 2011&lt;ref&gt;[https://techcrunch.com/2011/10/24/oracle-buys-cloud-based-customer-service-company-rightnow-for-1-5-billion/ Oracle Buys Cloud-based Customer Service Company RightNow For $1.5 Billion] ''Techcrunch'': 24 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt; and [[SAP AG|SAP]] acquired [[SuccessFactors]] in December 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessweek.com/news/2011-12-07/sap-challenges-oracle-with-3-4-billion-successfactors-purchase.html SAP Challenges Oracle With $3.4 Billion SuccessFactors Purchase] ''Bloomberg Businessweek'': 7 December 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The era of the "social customer"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | year = 2009 | last = Greenberg | first = Paul | title = CRM at the Speed of Light | publisher = McGraw Hill | edition = 4th | page = 7}}&lt;/ref&gt; refers to the use of social media ([[Twitter]], [[Facebook]], [[LinkedIn]], [[Google Plus]], [[Pinterest]], [[Instagram]], [[Yelp, Inc.|Yelp]], customer reviews in [[Amazon.com|Amazon]], etc.) by customers. CRM philosophy and strategy has shifted to encompass social networks and user communities.

Sales forces also play an important role in CRM, as maximizing [[Sales Effectiveness|sales effectiveness]] and increasing sales [[productivity]] is a driving force behind the adoption of CRM. Empowering [[Sales management|sales managers]] was listed as one of the top 5 CRM trends in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= Top 5 CRM Trends for 2013 | url=http://www.enterpriseappstoday.com/crm/top-5-crm-trends-for-2013.html| publisher=Enterprise Apps Today | accessdate=7 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another related development is [[vendor relationship management]] (VRM), which provide tools and services that allow customers to manage their individual relationship with vendors. VRM development has grown out of efforts by ProjectVRM at Harvard's [[Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society]] and Identity Commons' Internet Identity Workshops, as well as by a growing number of startups and established companies. VRM was the subject of a cover story in the May 2010 issue of ''CRM'' Magazine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.destinationcrm.com/Issue/1776-May-2010.htm Destinationcrm.com] ''CRM Magazine'': May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Pharmaceutical companies were some of the first investors in sales force automation (SFA) and some are on their third- or fourth-generation implementations. However, until recently, the deployments did not extend beyond SFA—limiting their scope and interest to Gartner analysts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Gartner's Top 54 CRM Case Studies, Sorted by Industry, for 2005 | url=https://www.gartner.com/doc/481170/gartners-top--crm-case | accessdate=20 May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another trend worth noting is the rise of [[Customer Success]] as a discipline within companies. More and more companies establish Customer Success teams as separate from the traditional Sales team and task them with managing existing customer relations. This trend fuels demand for additional capabilities for more holistic understanding of the customer health, which is a limitation for many existing vendors in the space.&lt;ref&gt;Nirpaz G., Pizarro F., Farm Don't Hunt: The Definitive Guide to Customer Success, March 2016, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, a growing number of new entrants enter the market, while existing vendors add capabilities in this area to their suites. In 2017, [[artificial intelligence]] and [[predictive analytics]] were identified as the newest trends in CRM.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.cmswire.com/customer-experience/7-top-crm-trends-for-2017-a-look-ahead/| title=7 Top CRM Trends for 2017: A Look Ahead| author=CMS Wire}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
{{see also|Anonymization|Customer rights}}
Companies face large challenges when trying to implement CRM systems. Consumer companies frequently manage their customer relationships haphazardly and unprofitably.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = CRM and ERP: What's The Difference?|url = http://www.crmswitch.com/crm-value/understanding-crm-erp/|website = CRM Switch|accessdate = 26 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; They may not effectively or adequately use their connections with their customers, due to misunderstandings or misinterpretations of a CRM system's analysis. Clients who want to be treated more like a friend may be treated like just a party for exchange, rather than a unique individual, due to, occasionally, a lack of a bridge between the CRM data and the CRM analysis output. Many studies show that customers are frequently frustrated by a company's inability to meet their relationship expectations, and on the other side, companies do not always know how to translate the data they have gained from CRM software into a feasible action plan.&lt;ref name=":45"/&gt; In 2003, a [[Gartner]] report estimated that more than $2 billion had been spent on software that was not being used. According to CSO Insights, less than 40 percent of 1,275 participating companies had end-user adoption rates above 90 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Demystifying CRM Adoption Rates|url = http://www.destinationcrm.com/Articles/Columns-Departments/Reality-Check/Demystifying-CRM-Adoption-Rates-42496.aspx|website = CRM Magazine|date = 1 July 2006|accessdate = 22 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many corporations only use CRM systems on a partial or fragmented basis.&lt;ref&gt;It's all about the Customer, Stupid – The Importance of Customer Centric Partners.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2007 survey from the UK, four-fifths of senior executives reported that their biggest challenge is getting their staff to use the systems they had installed. 43 percent of respondents said they use less than half the functionality of their existing systems.&lt;ref&gt;Jim Dickie, ''CSO Insights'' (2006) Demystifying CRM Adoption Rates.&lt;/ref&gt; However, market research regarding consumers' preferences may increase the adoption of CRM among the developing countries' consumers.&lt;ref&gt;Joachim, David. "CRM tools improve access, usability." (cover story). ''B to B'' 87, no. 3 (11 March 2002).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Data collection|Collection]] of customer data such as [[personally identifiable information]] must strictly obey [[customer privacy]] [[privacy law|laws]], which often requires extra expenditures on legal support.

Part of the paradox with CRM stems from the challenge of determining exactly what CRM is and what it can do for a company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/pdfplus/10.1108/02634500310458153.|title=From customer relationship management to customer‐managed relationship: unraveling the paradox with a co‐creative perspective|year=2003|journal=Marketing Intelligence &amp; Planning|volume=21|issue=1|pages=51–60|doi=10.1108/02634500310458153|author1=Monica Law|author2=Theresa Lau|author3=Y.H. Wong|via=EmeraldInsight|hdl=10397/60525}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CRM paradox, also referred to as the "dark side of CRM",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1108/07363761311290812|title = The dark side of CRM: Advantaged and disadvantaged customers|journal = Journal of Consumer Marketing|volume = 30|pages = 17–30|year = 2013|last1 = Nguyen|first1 = Bang|last2 = Simkin|first2 = Lyndon}}&lt;/ref&gt; may entail favoritism and differential treatment of some customers.

CRM technologies can easily become ineffective if there is no proper management, and they are not implemented correctly. The data sets must also be connected, distributed, and organized properly, so that the users can access the information that they need quickly and easily. Research studies also show that customers are increasingly becoming dissatisfied with contact center experiences due to lags and wait times. They also request and demand multiple channels of communications with a company, and these channels must transfer information seamlessly. Therefore, it is increasingly important for companies to deliver a cross-channel customer experience that can be both consistent as well as reliable.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt;

A '''digital signal controller''' (DSC) is a hybrid of [[microcontrollers]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; and [[digital signal processors]] (DSPs).  Like microcontrollers, DSCs have fast [[interrupt]] responses, offer control-oriented [[peripheral]]s like [[Pulse-width modulation|PWM]]s and [[watchdog timer]]s, and are usually programmed using the [[C (programming language)|C programming language]], although they can be programmed using the device's native [[assembly language]].  On the DSP side, they incorporate features found on most DSPs such as single-cycle multiply–accumulate ([[multiply–accumulate|MAC]]) units, [[barrel shifter]]s, and large [[accumulator (computing)|accumulator]]s. Not all vendors have adopted the term DSC. The term was first introduced by [[Microchip Technology]] in 2002 with the launch of their 6000 series DSCs and subsequently adopted by most, but not all DSC vendors.  For example, Infineon and Renesas refer to their DSCs as microcontrollers.)

DSCs are used in a wide range of applications, but the majority go into motor control, power conversion, and sensor processing applications.  Currently DSCs are being marketed as green technologies for their potential to reduce power consumption in electric motors and power supplies.

In order of market share, the top three DSC vendors are [[Texas Instruments]], [[Freescale]], and [[Microchip Technology]], according to market research firm Forward Concepts (2007). These three companies dominate the DSC market, with other vendors such as Infineon and Renesas taking a smaller slice of the pie.

==DSC software==

DSCs, like microcontrollers and DSPs, require software support.  There are a growing number of software packages that offer the features required by both DSP applications and microcontroller applications.  With a broader set of requirements, software solutions are more rare.  They require: development tools, DSP libraries, optimization for DSP processing, fast interrupt handling, multi-threading, and a tiny footprint.

[[File:Thumbtack.png|thumb|Push-pin or Map pin]]
A '''drawing pin''' (British English) or '''thumb tack''' (North American English) is a short [[nail (fastener)|nail]] or [[pin]] used to fasten items to a wall or board for display and intended to be inserted by hand, usually using the thumb. A variety of names are used to refer to different designs intended for various purposes. A '''push pin''' has a head that allows for easier removal. '''Map pin''' or '''map tack''' refers to push pins used to mark locations on a [[map]] or to hold the map in place. Thumb tack and push pin are both sometimes compounded ('''thumbtack''' or '''pushpin''') or hyphenated ('''thumb-tack''' or '''push-pin'''). 

Thumb tacks made of [[brass]], [[tin]] or [[iron]] may be referred to as '''brass tacks''', '''brass pins''', '''tin tacks''' or '''iron tacks''', respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=tack, n. 1.a. |url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/22729#eid14908084 |work=[[Oxford English Dictionary]] |publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; These terms are particularly used in the [[idiom]]atic expression ''to come'' (or ''get'') ''down to brass'' (or otherwise) ''tacks'', meaning to consider basic facts of a situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=brass, n. P2. |url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/22729#eid14908084 |work=[[Oxford English Dictionary]] |publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The drawing pin was invented in name and as a mass-produced item in what is now the United States in the mid/late 1750s. It was first mentioned in the Oxford English Dictionary in 1759. It was said that the use of the newly invented drawing pin to attach notices to school house doors was making significant contribution to the whittling away of their gothic doors. Modern drawing pins were also found as standard in architects’ drawing boxes in the late 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;"Parish and Belonging: Community, Identity and Welfare in England and Wales – 1700-1950", K.D.M Snell, Professor of Rural and Cultural History at Leicester University; Cambridge Press, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Edwin Moore patented the "push-pin" in the US in 1900 and founded the Moore Push-Pin Company. Moore described them as a pin with a handle. Later, in 1903, in [[Lychen]], German clockmaker Johann Kirsten invented flat-headed pins for use with drawings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  |page=56  |isbn=9781446354834  |title=Essential Shit: Bollocks!

A drawing pin has two basic components: the head, often made of [[plastic]], [[metal]] or  [[wood]], and the body, usually made of [[steel]] or [[brass]]. The head is wide to distribute the force of pushing the pin in, allowing only the hands to be used. Many head designs exist: flat, domed, spherical, cylindrical and a variety of novelty heads such as [[Heart (symbol)|heart]]s or [[Star (polygon)|star]]s. Drawing pin heads also come in a variety of colours. These can be particularly useful to mark different locations on a map. Some drawing pin designs have the body cut out of the head and bent downward to produce a pin.

Domed or gripped heads are sometimes preferred over flat heads as dropped flat-headed pins will point upward, posing a hazard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Teelucksingh |first=S |author2=V Naraynsingh |title=Injury to Diabetic Feet by Thumb Tacks|journal=[[The Lancet]] |date=July 1997 |volume=350 |issue=9070 |page=74 |url=http://www.lancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(05)66286-1/fulltext|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(05)66286-1 |pmid=9217749}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drawing pins also pose a hazard of ingestion and choking, where they may do serious harm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Robert|first=Rea|title=Perforation of the Esophagus by a Thumb Tack and Subsequent removal by an electromagnet|journal=Journal of the American Medical Society: Otolaryngology&amp;mdash;Head and Neck Surgery|date=August 1949|volume=50|issue=2|url=http://archotol.jamanetwork.com/article.aspx?articleid=586263}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Energy balance''', in terms of [[energy economics]], is concerned with all processes within an organization that have a reference to [[energy]]. It derives from the [[life-cycle assessment|ecobalance]] and has the ambition to analyze and verify the emergence, transformation and use of energy resources in an [[organization]] in detail.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20161026230301/http://lak-energiebilanzen.de/seiten/energiebilanzenMethodik.cfm Zur Methodik der Energiebilanzen], retrieved 22 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Energy balances serve as a major statistical data base for [[energy policy]] and [[energy management]] decisions. They contain important information such as the amount and composition of [[energy consumption]], its changes or the transformation of energy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130116143010/http://www.ag-energiebilanzen.de:80/viewpage.php?idpage=5 AGEB Erläuterungen], retrieved 22 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Approach ==

The basic idea of a balance is that nothing can get lost or annihilated - this fits to [[Thermodynamics#Laws of thermodynamics|the first law of thermodynamics]], which assigns energy this property. But energy splits up during usage and its output does not have the same potential for the physical performance as before.&lt;ref&gt;Böning, Jeanette A.: Methoden betrieblicher Ökobilanzierung, 1994, {{ISBN|3-89518-014-9}}, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

For this reason it is important to distinguish between input and output of energy usage. The input side can easily be measured with the help of the meter readings. But on the output side there may be effects that are difficulty predictable, such as [[heat]], [[dust]] or [[noise]]. In this context it is very interesting, how much of the energy used has actually reached the intended use. Based on this [[calculation]], improvement measures can be derived. A separation in energy sources and places of consumption is necessary. An Outline based on the cost centre of the organization is also possible.&lt;ref&gt;Johannes Kals: ''Betriebliches Energiemanagement - Eine Einführung.'' Kohlhammer, Stuttgart 2010, {{ISBN|978-3-17-021133-9}}, p. 25 - 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Environmental Science Services Administration''' (ESSA) was a [[United States federal government|United States Federal executive agency]] created in 1965 as part of a reorganization of the [[United States Department of Commerce]].&lt;ref name=noaahistoryreorg21965&gt;[http://www.history.noaa.gov/legacy/act5.html history.noaa.gov Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1965 (Reorg. Plan No. 2 of 1965, 3 C.F.R. xxx (1965), reprinted in 5 U.S.C. app. at 1517 (1994), and in 79 Stat. 1318-20 (1965), and in 30 Fed. Reg. 8819-xx (1965))]&lt;/ref&gt; Its mission was to unify and oversee the [[Meteorology|meteorological]], [[Climatology|climatological]], [[Hydrography|hydrographic]], and [[Geodesy|geodesic]] operations of the [[United States]]. It operated until 1970, when it was replaced by the new [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA).

The first U.S. Government organization with the word "environment" in its title,&lt;ref name=white58&gt;[http://www.meteohistory.org/2006historyofmeteorology3/4white_noaa.pdf meteohistory.org "The Making of NOAA, 1963-2005: AN Evening With Robert M.

White at Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum, Washington, D.C., December 1, 2005, p. 58.]&lt;/ref&gt; ESSA was the first such organization chartered to study the global [[natural environment]] as whole, bringing together the study of the oceans with that of the both the [[lower atmosphere]] and the [[ionosphere]]. This allowed the U.S Government for the first time to take a comprehensive approach to studying the oceans and the atmosphere, also bringing together various technologies – ships, aircraft, [[satellite]]s, [[radar]], and communications systems – that could operate together in gathering data for scientific study.&lt;ref name=white59&gt;[http://www.meteohistory.org/2006historyofmeteorology3/4white_noaa.pdf meteohistory.org "The Making of NOAA, 1963-2005: AN Evening With Robert M. White", transcription of presentation by Robert M. White at Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum, Washington, D.C., December 1, 2005, p. 59.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Establishment and mission==

In May 1964, the U.S. Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Science and Technology, Dr. [[Herbert Holloman]], established a special committee to review the [[environmental science]] service activities and responsibilities of the [[United States Department of Commerce]]. Committee members included the Director of the [[United States Weather Bureau]], Dr. [[Robert M. White (meteorologist)|Robert M. White]] (1923–2015); the Director of the [[United States Coast and Geodetic Survey]], [[Rear Admiral (United States)|Rear Admiral]] [[Henry Arnold Karo]] (1903–1986) of the [[United States Coast and Geodetic Survey Corps]]; the Director of the [[National Bureau of Standards]], [[Allen V. Astin]] (1904–1984); and a panel of scientists from industry and academia. The committee's goal was to consider ways of improving the Department of Commerce's environmental science efforts by improving management efficiency and making the provision of environmental science services to the public more effective. The committee's work resulted in its recommendation that the Department of Commerce consolidate various scientific efforts scattered within and between the Weather Bureau, Coast and Geodetic Survey, and National Bureau of Standards by establishing a new parent agency – the Environmental Science Services Administration (ESSA) – which would coordinate the activities of the Weather Bureau and Coast and Geodetic Survey and bring at least some of their efforts, along with some of the work done in the National Bureau of Standards, together into new organizations that focused scientific and engineering mission support for shared areas of inquiry.&lt;ref name=noaahistory4&gt;[http://www.history.noaa.gov/legacy/noaahistory_4.html history.noaa.gov NOAA's Heritage: Environmental Science Services Administration]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a message to the [[United States Congress]] dated 13 May 1965 in which he formally proposed the creation of ESSA, [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Lyndon Johnson]] described ESSA's mission in this way:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The new Administration will then provide a single national focus for our efforts to describe, understand, and predict the state of the oceans, the state of the lower and upper [[atmosphere]], and the size and shape of the earth.&lt;ref name=noaahistory4/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Director of the Weather Bureau, Dr. Robert M. White, explained that the creation of ESSA:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
*responded to an increasing national need for adequate warnings of severe natural hazards (e.g., [[tornado]]es, [[hurricane]]s, [[flood]]s);
*responded to technological advances in capabilities to observe the [[physical environment]] and communicate and process environmental data; and
*would enable scientists to investigate the physical environment as a "scientific whole" rather than a "collection of separate and distinct fields of scientific interest."&lt;ref name=noaahistory4/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

ESSA was established on 13 July 1965 under the Department of Commerce's Reorganization Plan No. 2 of 1965. Its creation brought the Weather Bureau and the Coast and Geodetic Survey, as well as the [[Central Radio Propagation Laboratory]] that had been part of the National Bureau of Standards,&lt;ref name=white59/&gt; together under a single parent scientific agency for the first time. Although the Weather Bureau and Coast and Geodetic Survey retained their independent identities under ESSA, the offices of Director of the Weather Bureau and Director and Deputy Director of the Coast and Geodetic Survey were abolished. These offices were replaced by a new Administrator and Deputy Administrator of ESSA.&lt;ref name=noaahistoryreorg21965/&gt;

==Components and activities==

===Headquarters===

ESSA was headquartered in [[Rockville, Maryland|Rockville]], [[Maryland]], with the ESSA Administrator as its senior executive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.photolib.noaa.gov/htmls/pers0027.htm NOAA Photo Library: Image ID: pers0027, NOAA's People Collection (caption)]&lt;/ref&gt; It consisted of five principal service and research elements, each of which reported directly to the ESSA Administrator: the Institutes for Environmental Research, reorganized in 1967 as the ESSA Research Laboratories; the Environmental Data Service; the United States Weather Bureau; the National Environmental Satellite Center; and the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey. Various other headquarters staff elements also reported directly to the Administrator, including the U.S. ESSA Commissioned Officer Corps (or "ESSA Corps").&lt;ref&gt;[https://docs.lib.noaa.gov/rescue/journals/essa_news/QC801E71965v1no8.pdf Anonymous, "Pattern Set For Titles and Names of Organizational Components," ''ESSA News'', October 12, 1965, pp. 3, 5.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Institutes for Environmental Research/ESSA Research Laboratories===

To tackle scientific and technological problems related to understanding the global environment,&lt;ref name=noaahistorycreation&gt;[http://www.history.noaa.gov/legacy/noaahistory_7.html history.noaa.gov NOAA -- AT ITS CREATION: The Environmental Science Services Administration]&lt;/ref&gt; ESSA created the '''Institutes for Environmental Research''', based in [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder]], [[Colorado]].&lt;ref name=noaahistorycreation/&gt; The four institutes were:&lt;ref name=noaahistorycreation/&gt;

* The '''Institute for [[Telecommunications]] Sciences and [[Aeronomy]]''', made up mostly of personnel from the [[National Bureau of Standards]]′ old [[Central Radio Propagation Laboratory]] and the [[Geoacoustics]] Group of the National Bureau of Standards.
* The '''Institute for [[Earth Sciences]]''', made up of staff from the Research Division of the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey. 
* The '''Institute for [[Oceanography]]''', made up of Coast and Geodetic Survey personnel.
* The '''Institute for [[Atmospheric Sciences]]''', mostly staffed by personnel from the U.S. Weather Bureau's Office of Meteorological Research.

To more precisely reflect the scope and mission of the individual elements of the institutes, ESSA reorganized them into the '''ESSA Research Laboratories''' in 1967.&lt;ref name=noaahistorycreation/&gt; The ESSA Research Laboratories were made up of:&lt;ref name=noaahistorycreation/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://docs.lib.noaa.gov/noaa_documents/NOAA_historic_documents/ESSA/ESSA_TR_ERL/175-ITS_112.pdf docs.lib.noaa.gov ESSA TECHNICAL REPORT ERL 175-ITS 112: On the Role of Vertical Neutral-Gas Motions in Producing Ion Convergence at E-Region Heights]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The '''Earth Sciences Laboratory''' at Boulder, Colorado, which studied [[geomagnetism]], [[seismology]], [[geodesy]], and related earth sciences; [[earthquake]] processes; the internal structure and accurate [[figure of the Earth]]; and the distribution of the Earth's [[mass]].
* The '''[[Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory|Atlantic Oceanographic Laboratory]]''' at [[Miami, Florida|Miami]], [[Florida]],  which studied [[oceanography]], with an emphasis on the [[geology]] and [[geophysics]] of [[ocean basin]]s, oceanic processes, sea-air interactions, [[hurricane]] research, and [[weather modification]].
* The '''Pacific Oceanographic Laboratory''' at [[Seattle, Washington|Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], which studied oceanography, the geology and geophysics of the [[Pacific Ocean]] Basin and its margins; oceanic processes and dynamics; and [[tsunami]] generation, propagation, modification, detection, and monitoring   
* The '''Atmospheric Physics and Chemistry Laboratory''' at Boulder, Colorado, which studied the [[physics]] of [[cloud]]s, [[precipitation]], and the chemical composition of and [[Nucleation|nucleating]] substances in the [[lower atmosphere]], and conducted laboratory and field experiments examining ways of developing feasible methods of weather modification
* The '''[[Air Resources Laboratory]]''' at [[Silver Spring, Maryland|Silver Spring]], [[Maryland]], which studied the diffusion, transport, and dissipation of atmospheric contaminants and the development of methods for the prediction and control of [[air pollution]].
* The '''[[Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory]]''' at [[Princeton, New Jersey|Princeton]], [[New Jersey]], which studied the dynamics and physics of [[Geophysics|geophysical]] [[Fluid dynamics|fluid systems]] and the development of a theoretical basis for the behavior and properties of the atmosphere and the oceans through mathematical modeling and computer simulation,.
* The '''[[National Hurricane Research Laboratory]]''' at Miami, Florida, which examined [[tropical cyclone]]s scientifically in order to improve predictions.
* The '''[[National Severe Storms Laboratory]]''' at [[Norman, Oklahoma|Norman]], [[Oklahoma]], which studied [[tornado]]es, [[squall line]]s, [[thunderstorm]]s, and other severe local [[Convection|convective]] phenomena with a goal of improving methods of forecasting, detecting, and providing advance warnings of such storms.
* The '''Space Disturbances Laboratory'''  at Boulder, Colorado, which studied the nature, behavior, and mechanisms of [[Outer space|space]] disturbances and the development and use of techniques for continuous monitoring and early detection and reporting of important space disturbances.
* The '''[[Aeronomy]] Laboratory''' at Boulder, Colorado, which conducted theoretical, laboratory, rocket, and satellite studies of the physical and chemical processes controlling the [[ionosphere]] and [[exosphere]] of the Earth and other planets.
* The '''[[Wave propagation|Wave Propagation]] Laboratory''' at Boulder, Colorado, which sought to develop new methods for remote sensing of the geophysical environment, with a special emphasis on the propagation of [[sound wave]]s and of [[electromagnetic wave]]s at [[Millimeter wave|millimeter]], [[infrared]], and optical frequencies.
* The '''Institute for Telecommunications Science''' in Boulder, Colorado, which served as the central U.S. Government agency for research and services in the propagation of [[radio wave]]s, the [[radio]] properties of the Earth and its atmosphere, the nature of [[Noise (radio)|radio noise]] and [[electromagnetic interference]], information transmission and [[Antenna (radio)|antenna]]s, and methods for the more effective use of the [[radio spectrum]] for [[telecommunications]].
* The '''Research Flight Facility''' in Miami, Florida, which outfitted and operated aircraft specially instrumented for research and made aerial environmental measurements for ESSA and other groups.

===Environmental Data Service===
Under ESSA, the National Data Center was renamed the Environmental Data Service (EDS). In 1966, ESSA transferred the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey's [[Seismology]] Data Centers to [[Asheville, North Carolina|Asheville]], [[North Carolina]], where they merged with the U.S. Weather Bureau's National Weather Records Center to create ESSA's Environmental Data Center.&lt;ref name=noaahistorycreation/&gt;

===United States Weather Bureau===
{{main|National Weather Service}}
Under the 1965 reorganization, the [[United States Weather Bureau]] became subordinate to ESSA. It retained its identity as the U.S. Weather Bureau while under ESSA. It was renamed the [[National Weather Service]] (NWS) in 1970.

[[File:ESSA-9.jpg|thumb|The [[ESSA-9]] [[weather satellite]] in February 1969. It operated from February 1969 to November 1972.]]

===National Environmental Satellite Center===
{{main|Television Infrared Observation Satellite}}
The [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA) began [[weather satellite]] programs in 1958, and ESSA inherited these upon its creation in 1965. ESSA's '''National Environmental Satellite Center''' worked jointly with NASA to develop weather satellite capabilities. It managed the first operational U.S. [[polar orbit]]ing [[weather satellite]] system, known as the [[Television Infrared Observation Satellite]] (TIROS) Program. These satellites, launched between 1960 and 1965 and known as TIROS 1 through 10, were the first generation of American weather satellites. These early satellites carried low-resolution television and [[infrared camera]]s. Designed mainly to test the feasibility of weather satellites, TIROS proved to be extremely successful. Four were still operating when ESSA was established.

TIROS paved the way for the more advanced weather satellites of the TIROS Operational System (TOS). The ESSA National Environmental Satellite Center worked jointly with NASA to deploy the new TOS satellites, which constituted an operational experiment with early imaging and weather broadcast systems.&lt;ref name=noaahistorycreation/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nixonfoundation.org/2014/07/president-nixons-message-congress-epa-noaa/ nixonfoundation.org President Nixon On Establishing the EPA and NOAA]&lt;/ref&gt; Nine of ESSA's TOS satellites were launched between 1966 and 1969, each named "ESSA" followed by a number from 1 to 9, beginning with the launch of [[ESSA-1]] on 3 February 1966.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earth.nasa.gov/history/essa/essa1.html earth.nasa.gov NASA Earth Science]&lt;/ref&gt; The last of these satellites was decommissioned in 1977, but ESSA's work with NASA laid the foundation for the deployment of the first [[Geostationary orbit|geostationary]] weather satellites, the [[Synchronous Meteorological Satellite]]s of 1974 and 1975.&lt;ref name=noaahistorycreation/&gt;

===United States Coast and Geodetic Survey===
{{main|National Geodetic Survey}}

Under the 1965 reorganization, the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey was subordinated to ESSA. While under ESSA, it retained its distinct identity and continued to carry out its responsibilities for coastal and oceanic [[hydrographic survey]]s, geodetic work in the interior of the United States and at sea, and other scientific work, such as in seismology. The Coast and Geodetic Survey also continued to operate its fleet of [[survey ship]]s and [[research ship]]s while subordinate to ESSA.

===U.S. ESSA Commissioned Officer Corps (ESSA Corps)===
{{main|NOAA Commissioned Officer Corps}}

In the 1965 reorganization, the [[commissioned officer]]s of the [[United States Coast and Geodetic Survey Corps]], a component of the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey with a history dating back to 1917, were transferred to the control of the [[United States Secretary of Commerce]].&lt;ref name=noaahistoryreorg21965/&gt; This created the [[ESSA Corps|United States Environmental Science Services Commissioned Officer Corps]], known informally as the "ESSA Corps," whose director reported directly to the ESSA Administrator. Like the Coast and Geodetic Survey Corps before it, the ESSA Corps was responsible for providing commissioned officers to operate the Coast and Geodetic Survey's ships, fly aircraft, support peacetime defense requirements and purely civilian scientific projects, and provide a ready source of technically skilled officers which could be incorporated into the [[United States armed forces]] in time of war, and was one of the seven [[uniformed services of the United States]].

==Senior leadership==

[[Robert M. White (meteorologist)|Robert M. White]] (1923–2015) served as the Administrator of ESSA throughout its existence.
[[File:Environmental Science Services Administration flag.jpg|left|thumb|An ESSA flag, showing creases from having been folded.]]
On the day ESSA and the ESSA Corps were created, Coast and Geodetic Survey Corps [[Rear admiral (United States)|Rear Admiral]] [[Henry Arnold Karo]] (1903–1986) simultaneously became an ESSA Corps officer and was promoted to [[Vice admiral (United States)|vice admiral]] to serve as ESSA's first deputy administrator. At the time the highest-ranking officer in the combined history of the Coast and Geodetic Survey Corps and ESSA Corps, Vice Admiral Karo served as Deputy Administrator of ESSA from 1965 to 1967. He was the only officer in the combined history of the Coast and Geodetic Survey Corps, ESSA Corps, and the ESSA Corps′ successor, the [[NOAA Commissioned Officer Corps|National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Commissioned Corps]] (NOAA Corps), to reach that rank until NOAA Corps Rear Admiral [[Michael S. Devany]] was promoted to vice admiral on 2 January 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.noaanews.noaa.gov/stories2014/20140102_devany.html|title=Vice Adm.

The first Director of the ESSA Corps was Rear Admiral [[James C. Tison, Jr.]] (1908–1991), who served in this capacity from 1965 to 1968. He was succeeded by the second and last Director of the ESSA Corps, Rear Admiral [[Don A. Jones]] (1912–2000), who served from 1968 to 1970.

==Flag==
The flag of the Environmental Science Services Administration was in essence the [[United States Coast and Geodetic Survey#Flag|flag of the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey]], modified by the addition of a blue circle to the center of the red triangle, within which was a stylized, diamond-shaped map of the world. Because the Coast and Geodetic Survey retained its identity after it was placed under ESSA in 1965, ships of the Survey's fleet continued to fly the Coast and Geodetic Survey flag as a [[distinguishing mark]] while the Survey was subordinate to ESSA.

==Disestablishment and replacement by NOAA==
In June 1966, the U.S. Congress passed the Marine Resources and Engineering Development Act,&lt;ref name=noaahistory3&gt;[http://www.history.noaa.gov/legacy/noaahistory_3.html history.noaa.gov A History of NOAA: Background] {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; which declared that it was U.S. Government policy to:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...develop, encourage, and maintain a coordinated, comprehensive, and long-range national program in [[marine science]] for the benefit of mankind, to assist in protection of health and property, enhancement of commerce, transportation, and [[national security]], rehabilitation of our [[Commercial fishing|commercial fisheries]], and increased utilization of these and other resources.&lt;ref name=noaahistory3/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The act created a Commission on Marine Science, Engineering, and Resources – which came to be known informally as the "Stratton Commission" – and gave it the responsibility to review ongoing and planned U.S. Government marine science activities and recommend a national oceanographic program and a reorganization of the U.S. Government to carry out the program. President Lyndon Johnson appointed 15 members to the commission; [[Ford Foundation]] chairman [[Julius Adams Stratton|Julius A. Stratton]] chaired it, and its members included attorney [[Leon Jaworski]], Dean of the Graduate School of Oceanography at the [[University of Rhode Island]] [[John Knauss]], ESSA Administrator Robert M. White, and other representatives of U.S. Government agencies, [[U.S. state]] governments, industry, academia, and other institutions with programs or interest in marine science and technology; it also included four U.S. Congressional advisors, including former U.S. Senator [[Warren G. Magnuson]] of [[Washington (state)|Washington]].&lt;ref name=noaahistory3/&gt; The commission began its work in early 1967, and on 9 January 1969 it issued its final report, entitled ''Our Nation and the Sea: A Plan For National Action''.&lt;ref name=noaahistory3/&gt; The Commission determined that "because of the importance of the seas to this Nation and the world, our Federal organization of marine affairs must be put in order," and that fulfilling the U.S. ocean policy declared in the 1966 act and making "full and wise use of the marine environment" required the study of both the ocean and the atmosphere and their interactions with one another.&lt;ref name=noaahistory3/&gt; Accordingly, it recommended the creation of an independent "National Oceanic and Atmospheric Agency" to administer the principal civil marine and atmospheric programs of the United States, and that the new agency be composed of the [[United States Coast Guard]] from the [[United States Department of Transportation]]; ESSA and its subordinates, the National Weather Service and U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey, from the U.S. Department of Commerce; the Bureau of Commercial Fisheries and the functions of the Bureau of Sport Fisheres and Wildlife dealing with marine and migratory fishes from the [[United States Department of the Interior]]′s [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]]; the [[National Sea Grant Program]] from the [[National Science Foundation]]; elements of the [[United States Lake Survey]] from the [[United States Department of the Army]]; and the [[National Oceanographic Data Center]] from the [[United States Department of the Navy]].&lt;ref name=noaahistory3/&gt;

Soon after the Commission published the report, the U.S. Congress began to deliberate action on it, as did the Advisory Council on Executive Organization created by President [[Richard Nixon]] in 1969. Among the Advisory Council's proposals for reorganization of the [[Executive branch of the United States government|executive branch of the United States Government]] was one that proposed the replacement of the U.S. Department of the Interior with a new U.S. Department of Natural Resources, and that this new department include a "National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration" which combined ESSA with some elements of the Department of the Interior; the Nixon administration considered placing the new Administration within the Department of the Interior as an interim measure pending the creation of a new Department of Natural Resources. Noting that two-thirds of the new Administration would be made up of ESSA personnel and funding, [[United States Secretary of Commerce]] [[Maurice Stans]] (1908–1998) proposed instead that the new Administration become part of the Department of Commerce, where ESSA already was in place. Nixon decided to side with Stans, as well as to incorporate some of the Stratton Commission's and Advisory Council's recommendations, and in early July 1970 submitted Department of Commerce Reorganization Plan No. 4. It proposed the creation in 90 days within the Department of Commerce of the new [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] (NOAA), consisting of ESSA; the Bureau of Commercial Fisheries and the marine sport fishing program of the Bureau of Sport Fisheries and Wildlife; the Office of Sea Grant Programs from the National Science Foundation; the mapping, charting, and research functions of the U.S. Army's U.S. Lake Survey; the U.S. Navy's National Oceanographic Data Center; the [[Marine Minerals Technology Center]] from the Department of the Interior's [[United States Bureau of Mines]]; the U.S. Navy's [[National Oceanographic Instrumentation Center]]; and the Department of Transportation's [[National Data Buoy Project]],&lt;ref name=noaahistory3/&gt; although it did not follow the Stratton Commission's recommendation to include the U.S. Coast Guard in NOAA.&lt;ref name=noaahistory3/&gt;

Accordingly, on 3 October 1970, ESSA was abolished as part of Reorganization Plan No. 4 of 1970,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lib.noaa.gov/noaainfo/heritage/ReorganizationPlan4.html Reorganization Plan No. 4 of 1970] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304051421/http://www.lib.noaa.gov/noaainfo/heritage/ReorganizationPlan4.html |date=2016-03-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NOAALegis1970"&gt;[http://www.history.noaa.gov/legacy/act6.html Reorganization Plan No. 4 of 1970, reprinted with amendments in 5 U.S.C. app. at 1557-61]&lt;/ref&gt; and it was replaced by NOAA. Under NOAA, the National Weather Service continued to operate as such, while the Coast and Geodetic Survey was disestablished and its functions were divided under various new NOAA offices. The Bureau of Commercial Fisheries of the [[United States Department of the Interior]]′s [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]] was transferred to NOAA, and its [[fisheries science]] and [[Oceanography|oceanographic]] [[research ship]]s joined the hydrographic survey ships of the former Coast and Geodetic Survey fleet to form the new [[NOAA ships and aircraft|NOAA fleet]].&lt;ref name="NOAALegis1970"/&gt;

In the 1970 reorganization that created NOAA, the ESSA Corps was resubordinated to NOAA, becoming the [[NOAA Commissioned Officer Corps|National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration Commissioned Officer Corps]], known informally as the "NOAA Corps."&lt;ref name="NOAA"&gt;[http://www.lib.noaa.gov/noaainfo/heritage/coastandgeodeticsurvey/index.html NOAA, ''Coast and Geodetic Survey Heritage'']&lt;/ref&gt; Like its predecessors, the Coast and Geodetic Survey Corps and ESSA Corps, the NOAA Corps became one of the seven [[uniformed services of the United States]], and carries out responsibilities similar to those of the ESSA Corps.

==Legacy==
The first U.S. Government organization to address [[environmental science]] and [[earth sciences]] holistically,&lt;ref name=white58/&gt; ESSA pioneered the revolutionary organizational concept of uniting scientific and engineering activities that had been scattered among its subordinate agencies so as to establish unified mission support to meet environmental science and technology objectives.&lt;ref name=noaahistorycreation/&gt; ESSA's successor, NOAA, continued and broadened the application of this organizational concept by adding marine [[life sciences]] to its portfolio of holistic study of the oceans and atmosphere alongside the [[earth sciences]] subordinated to ESSA. ESSA served as the prototype not only for NOAA but also for the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=guQYCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA357&amp;lpg=PA357&amp;dq=Environmental+Science+Services+Administration+legacy&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=69sYuMBBm4&amp;sig=5gz4Roia89uyieXiut-uMvqh200&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjh88P42r3SAhXKSSYKHUQ-DOg4FBDoAQgkMAI#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Environmental%20Science%20Services%20Administration%22&amp;f=false Wilson, Robert H., Norman J.

ESSA's work in designing weather satellites and managing their missions was a major step forward both technologically and in terms of weather monitoring and prediction. It prompted further development of weather satellites in the exploration of their use, playing a major role in the development of modern weather satellites.&lt;ref&gt;[https://eospso.gsfc.nasa.gov/missions/environmental-science-services-administration eospso.gsfc.nasa.gov Historical Missions: Environmental Science Services Administration (ESSA)]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Express transport''' and its actors, the "expressists", consists in the delivery of small packages and parcel, in a limited duration from a point A (place of load decided by the carrier and not by the customer) to a point B (place of delivery).

The main characteristics of this type of transport are the speed of delivery as well as the ease of transport. It is rarely a "door-to-door" transport, contrary to the custom-made transport (or ad hoc). Most of the time, this type of transport begins in the warehouse up to the point of reception of the customer. Besides, this type of transport does not take into account the last kilometer, which is under the responsibility of the customer and not of the deliverer.

== General Uses ==

Express transport is an activity coming from the messaging market. With the technological and 
industrial evolutions, customers requirements have developed the offer towards a faster delivery. So, the reduction of delivery deadlines has created this new type of market.

Express transport companies try to differ by their down-market positioning (it is the cheapest a customer can get with decent delivery deadlines) including a more and more wide side services range. These side services include for example information feedbacks, proofs of delivery, insurances, custom clearances, the specific packaging or the value-added services such as the IT maintenance.

The national express deliveries mean the domestic market, shipments achieved in unique country. In terms of guaranteed deadlines on the national express deliveries market, professionals distinguish two express categories of transport:

* Real express transport, which means sendings delivered the next day before 1 pm
* Economic express transport, which means the sendings delivered the next day before 6 pm. According to certain operators, this segment can include rush courier services

There are differences of delay for national express deliveries regarding the various operators. The delivery market is segmented according to these deadlines:

* Deliveries before 10 am (including parcel delivered at night, the next day before 9 am and before 10 am)
* Deliveries before 1 pm (including parcel delivered the next day before 12 am and before 1 pm) 
* Deliveries before 6 pm (including parcel delivered the next day before 6 pm)

The express transport size includes monoparcel and multiparce deliveries with the express transport deadlines. We segmented the market of express transport according to the following categories of parcel:

* Light parcel, up to 30&amp;nbsp;kg 
* Any weight parcel,  superior to 30&amp;nbsp;kg

The delivery of a parcel using express transport is divided into six phases, including the pick-up of the parcel at the customer’s place, grouping by road to the local recycling center, transport by plane or truck to the French main sorting center or European, sorting by destination and treatment of clearance services, the delivery of parcels by air or by truck center of local sorting and delivery by road to the recipient.

== Actors ==

* Integrators are global carriers that incorporate the whole transport. They manage all means of transport and the customs, freight and mail traffic.
* The operator is a generic term for a provider that offers express transportation product.
* It may also be used to designate a mail carrier.
* A expressist means a company that offers a service of express transport.
* The renting man is an independent artisan offering transport services. He works on his own and has its own fleet of vehicles.
* The breaking load is the transfer which is made of a property, from one mode to another.

=== Terms associated techniques ===

* The tracing means monitoring and identification of all computer shipments throughout the storage process and delivery of the goods.
* A groupage platform is a platform where the goods are consolidated for group transport.
* Bundling refers to the meeting of various goods at more recipients, carried by a single provider.
* The hub or network corresponds to the organization of star grouping platforms / unbundling used by providers.
* The tracking is monitoring in real time, information related to the physical flow of goods.

== Examples ==

Two examples of express transport companies are [[FedEx]] and [[United Parcel Service|UPS]].

[[File:Harvard architecture.svg|thumb|Harvard architecture]]

The '''Harvard architecture''' is a [[computer architecture]] with physically separate [[computer storage|storage]] and signal pathways for [[Instruction (computing)|instruction]]s and data. The term originated from the [[Harvard Mark I]] relay-based computer, which stored instructions on [[punched tape]] (24 bits wide) and data in [[electro-mechanical]] counters. These early machines had data storage entirely contained within the [[central processing unit]], and provided no access to the instruction storage as data. Programs needed to be loaded by an operator; the processor could not [[Booting|initialize]] itself.

Today, most processors implement such separate signal pathways for performance reasons, but actually implement a [[modified Harvard architecture]], so they can support tasks like loading a program from [[disk storage]] as data and then executing it.

==Memory details==
In a Harvard architecture, there is no need to make the two memories share characteristics. In particular, the [[Word (computer architecture)|word]] width, timing, implementation technology, and [[memory address]] structure can differ. In some systems, instructions for pre-programmed tasks can be stored in [[read-only memory]] while data memory generally requires [[random-access memory|read-write memory]]. In some systems, there is much more instruction memory than data memory so instruction addresses are wider than data addresses.

===Contrast with von Neumann architectures===
{{Main|Von Neumann architecture}}
In a system with a pure [[von Neumann architecture]], instructions and data are stored in the same memory, so instructions are fetched over the same data path used to fetch data.  This means that a [[Central processing unit|CPU]] cannot simultaneously read an instruction and read or write data from or to the memory. In a computer using the Harvard architecture, the CPU can both read an instruction and perform a data memory access at the same time,&lt;ref name="ddj1" &gt;"[http://www.drdobbs.com/386-vs-030-the-crowded-fast-lane/184407891?pgno=4 386 vs. 030: the Crowded Fast Lane]". ''Dr. Dobb's Journal'', January 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; even without a cache. A Harvard architecture computer can thus be faster for a given circuit complexity because [[instruction fetch]]es and data access do not contend for a single memory pathway.

Also, a Harvard architecture machine has distinct code and data address spaces: instruction address zero is not the same as data address zero.  Instruction address zero might identify a twenty-four bit value, while data address zero might indicate an eight-bit byte that is not part of that twenty-four bit value.

===Contrast with modified Harvard architecture===
{{Main|Modified Harvard architecture}}
A [[modified Harvard architecture]] machine is very much like a Harvard architecture machine, but it relaxes the strict separation between instruction and data while still letting the CPU concurrently access two (or more) memory buses. The most common modification includes separate instruction and data [[CPU cache|caches]] backed by a common address space.  While the CPU executes from cache, it acts as a pure Harvard machine.  When accessing backing memory, it acts like a von Neumann machine (where code can be moved around like data, which is a powerful technique). This modification is widespread in modern processors, such as the [[ARM architecture]], [[Power Architecture]] and [[x86]] processors.  It is sometimes loosely called a Harvard architecture, overlooking the  fact that it is actually "modified".

Another modification provides a pathway between the instruction memory (such as ROM or [[flash memory]]) and the CPU to allow words from the instruction memory to be treated as read-only data.  This technique is used in some microcontrollers, including the [[Atmel AVR]].  This allows constant data, such as [[text string]]s or [[function table]]s, to be accessed without first having to be copied into data memory, preserving scarce (and power-hungry) data memory for read/write variables.  Special [[machine language]] instructions are provided to read data from the instruction memory, or the instruction memory can be accessed using a peripheral interface{{note|The IAP lines of 8051-compatible microcontrollers from STC have dual ported Flash memory, with one of the two ports hooked to the instruction bus of the processor core, and the other port made available in the special function register region.}}.  (This is distinct from instructions which themselves embed constant data, although for individual constants the two mechanisms can substitute for each other.)

==Speed==
In recent years, the speed of the CPU has grown many times in comparison to the access speed of the main memory. Care needs to be taken to reduce the number of times main memory is accessed in order to maintain performance. If, for instance, every instruction run in the CPU requires an access to memory, the computer gains nothing for increased CPU speed—a problem referred to as being [[memory bound]].

It is possible to make extremely fast memory, but this is only practical for small amounts of memory for cost, power and signal routing reasons.  The solution is to provide a small amount of very fast memory known as a [[CPU cache]] which holds recently accessed data. As long as the data that the CPU needs are in the cache, the performance is much higher than it is when the CPU has to get the data from the main memory.

=== Internal vs. external design ===
Modern high performance CPU chip designs incorporate aspects of both Harvard and von Neumann architecture.  In particular, the "split cache" version of the [[modified Harvard architecture]] is very common.  CPU cache memory is divided into an instruction cache and a data cache. Harvard architecture is used as the CPU accesses the cache.  In the case of a cache miss, however, the data is retrieved from the main memory, which is not formally divided into separate instruction and data sections, although it may well have separate memory controllers used for concurrent access to RAM, ROM and (NOR) flash memory.

Thus, while a von Neumann architecture is visible in some contexts, such as when data and code come through the same memory controller, the hardware implementation gains the efficiencies of the Harvard architecture for cache accesses and at least some main memory accesses.

In addition, CPUs often have write buffers which let CPUs proceed after writes to non-cached regions. The von Neumann nature of memory is then visible when instructions are written as data by the CPU and software must ensure that the caches (data and instruction) and write buffer are synchronized before trying to execute those just-written instructions.

==Modern uses of the Harvard architecture==
The principal advantage of the pure Harvard architecture—simultaneous access to more than one memory system—has been reduced by modified Harvard processors using modern [[CPU cache]] systems.  Relatively pure Harvard architecture machines are used mostly in applications where trade-offs, like the cost and power savings from omitting caches, outweigh the programming penalties from featuring distinct code and data address spaces.

*[[Digital signal processors]] (DSPs) generally execute small, highly optimized audio or video processing algorithms. They avoid caches because their behavior must be extremely reproducible.  The difficulties of coping with multiple address spaces are of secondary concern to speed of execution. Consequently, some DSPs feature multiple data memories in distinct address spaces to facilitate [[SIMD]] and [[VLIW]] processing.  [[Texas Instruments TMS320]] C55x processors, for one example, feature multiple parallel data buses (two write, three read) and one instruction bus.
*[[Microcontrollers]] are characterized by having small amounts of program (flash memory) and data ([[Static random-access memory|SRAM]]) memory, and take advantage of the Harvard architecture to speed processing by concurrent instruction and data access.  The separate storage means the program and data memories may feature different bit widths, for example using 16-bit wide instructions and 8-bit wide data.  They also mean that [[instruction prefetch]] can be performed in parallel with other activities. Examples include the [[PIC microcontroller|PIC]] by [[Microchip Technology|Microchip Technology, Inc.]] and the [[Atmel AVR|AVR]] by [[Atmel|Atmel Corp]] (now part of Microchip Technology).

Even in these cases, it is common to employ special instructions in order to access program memory as though it were data for read-only tables, or for reprogramming; those processors are [[modified Harvard architecture]] processors.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15400">The term '''monorail''' or '''industrial monorail''' is used to describe any number of transport systems in which a chair or carrier is suspended from, or rides on, an overhead rail structure.  Unlike the well-known duo-rail system, there are many rail-guided transport options which have been described as monorails, so that tracing the history presents a [[demarcation problem]] regarding what should be included and what should be omitted.

Common usage appears to define a [[monorail]] as any rail guided vehicle which does not employ the coning action of conventional [[adhesion railway]]s to achieve directional stability. This would exclude rack railways and [[funicular railway]]s.

Bearing in mind the pattern of development of conventional [[railways]], different criteria and measures of effectiveness were relevant at different times, and alternative design solutions were proposed.  Hence, a monorail of the early 19th Century bears little resemblance to current
designs, and were optimised for different performance objectives, within different technological constraints.

== Early developments ==
[[File:Palmer-monorail.png|right|thumb|Palmer's monorail.]]
[[File:Lartigue Lokomotive.png|thumb|The Lartigue monorail]]
The earliest patent for a vehicle designed to run on a single rail can be traced to UK patent No 4618 dated 22 November 1821.  The inventor was [[Henry Robinson Palmer]], commonly known by his alias as "George Monorail", who described it as 'a single line of rail, supported at such height from the ground as to allow the centre of
gravity of the carriages to be below the upper surface of the rail'. The vehicles straddled the rail, rather like a pair of pannier baskets on a mule. Propulsion was by horse.&lt;ref name = Palmer&gt;{{cite book |last= Palmer|first= Henry|title= Description of a Railway on a New Principle|origyear= 1823|edition=|year= 1823|publisher= J. Taylor|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A line was built in 1824 in the [[Deptford Dockyard]] in London, and in 1825, another line was built in [[Cheshunt]], [[Hertfordshire]]. Dubbed the ''[[Cheshunt Railway]]'', this line made history as it was the world's first passenger-carrying monorail, and the first railway line to open in Hertfordshire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Finchley Society Annual General Meeting Minutes|author=Finchley Society|url=http://www.finchleysociety.org.uk/Newsletters/1990s/1997/6-97.pdf|date=1997-06-26|accessdate=2009-04-03|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204205022/http://www.finchleysociety.org.uk/Newsletters/1990s/1997/6-97.pdf|archivedate=2008-12-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=June 25 – Today in Science History|author=Today in Science History|url=http://www.todayinsci.com/6/6_25.htm|accessdate=2009-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1826 a company was formed to construct a line between [[Barmen]] and [[Elberfeld]] in Germany, but construction never started.

Throughout the 19th Century, the Palmer design was improved, with the addition of stabilising wheels and additional rails (rendering a misnomer of 'monorail'). In 1829, Maxwell Dick introduced 'safety rails' below the running rails to reduce the likelihood of derailment. He
also articulated the main advantage claimed for this class of vehicle: 'the pillars or supports to be of different heights as circumstances of the country may require'. In other words, the system was better suited for crossing rough terrain.

In 1868, [[William Thorold]] M.I.C.E. presented a paper proposing a monorail system that could be built at ground level in or alongside roads. The [[Patiala State Monorail Trainways]] and [[Kundala Valley Railway]] were built in India on the principle that he described.

In 1869, J Haddon built a monorail in [[Syria]] to replace a mule train in military use. This embodied lateral guide rails, but was basically a pannier design hauled by a locomotive having double vertical steam boilers.

General LeRoy Stone demonstrated in 1876 his [[Centennial Monorail]] for transporting passengers, but failed to exploit the concept also on the [[Bradford and Foster Brook Railway|Bradford and Foster Brook Monorail]], and this was closed after only one year due to a lethal boiler explosion in 1879. Around 1879,  Joseph Stringfellow devised a similar "one-rail" system for possible use as a "cheap railway" in Australia.&lt;ref name="trove.nla.gov.au"&gt;http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article1376851?searchTerm=cheap+railway#pstart72945&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the 19th Century, the main protagonists for the monorail where [[Charles Lartigue]] and F. B. Behr. Lartigue constructed Palmer monorails in [[Algeria]] to transport esparto grass, to replace mules and camels, although the motive power is recorded as 'animal'. He also demonstrated his ideas in Paris (1884), [[Westminster]] (1886), [[Tours]] (1889), [[St Petersburg]] (1894), [[Long Island]] (1894) and [[Brussels]] (1897). Behr proposed a high speed monorail between [[Liverpool]] and [[Manchester]], but construction never started through lack of financial support.

The most famous Lartigue monorail was the [[Listowel and Ballybunion Railway]], in Ireland, which stayed in service from 1888 until 1924.&lt;ref name=Ballybunion&gt;{{cite book |last= Newham|first= A.T.|title= The Listowel and Ballybunion Railway|origyear= 1989|edition= LP33|year= 1998|publisher= Oakwood Press|isbn= 0-85361-093-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part of this railway survives as a preserved railway and tourist attraction.&lt;ref name=Lartigue&gt;{{cite web|url=http://homepage.eircom.net/~lartiguemonorail/|title=Listowel and Ballybunion Railway}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ricDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA35&amp;dq=Popular+Science+1933+plane+%22Popular+Science%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=fbVcTaibJoep8Abi1Zn8Cg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10&amp;ved=0CE4Q6AEwCTge#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true "Unique Irish Trains run On One Rail"] ''Popular Science'', February 1935&lt;/ref&gt;

The last Lartigue design was built in 1924 between a magnesium mine at Crystal Hills, about 100 miles north of Los Angeles, and a railhead in Trona, California. This used petrol driven locomotives, and mounted the rail on a set of wooden A frames.

== Suspended and bicycle railways ==
[[File:CIRR Monorail External.jpg|thumb|[[Pelham Park and City Island Railroad]], believed to be c. 1910]]
[[File:Kearney high-speed railway.jpg|thumb|The [[Kearney High-Speed Railway]]]]
In 1886, the Enos Electric Company demonstrated a suspended monorail on the grounds of the Daft Electric Light Company in the Greenville section of [[Jersey City]], [[New Jersey]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=9F06E4D91F30E533A25751C1A9679D94679FD7CF | work=The New York Times | title=Testing An Electric Railway | date=1886-11-12 | accessdate=2010-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was closer in its appearance to more modern monorails, but the most famous suspended monorail of this era was Eugen Langen's '[[Schwebebahn Wuppertal|Schwebebahn]]', or floating railway, of [[Wuppertal]], which entered service in 1901, and is still in daily use.

The Wuppertal monorail follows the [[Wupper]] Valley where a conventional railway is quite impractical.  The suspended monorail, like the Palmer monorail appears a potentially superior solution over rough and mountainous terrain, but since the majority of the track is over more 
favourable territory, it only rarely offers an overall better solution.  Short sections in mountainous areas, such as a system built for the Ria Copper Co. by [[Siemens]] in the [[Pyrenees]], seem to be the niche for this type of monorail.  This particular example used a form of regenerative braking, such that the electricity generated by the full descending trucks was sufficient to drive the empty trucks back up the mountain.

In 1890 the [[Boynton Bicycle Railroad]] was built in Long Island.&lt;ref name="SciAm"&gt;[http://illianaroad.com/railroading/the-remarkable-boynton-unicycle-railroad/ Scientific American, 28 March 1891.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Designed by Jose Ramon Villalon, who would later become one of Cuba's greatest statesmen, this railroad ran on a single rail at ground level, but with an overhead stabilising rail engaged by a pair of horizontally opposed wheels. The railway operated for only two years, but the design was adopted elsewhere.

In 1908, [[Elfric Wells Chalmers Kearney]] (1881–1960)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

From 1910–1914 a monorail system designed by Howard H Tunis was used on the [[Pelham Park and City Island Railroad]] in [[the Bronx]], New York City. On the first trip of the monorail, the vehicle, with the inventor at the controls, slipped off the supporting lower rail.  Though some of the New York newspapers erroneously reported that the accident was a major catastrophe, that is not so, and only one passenger on the car claimed a minor injury.   The car was quickly repaired and the monorail operated safely on a regular basis from 1911 until 1917, when it was dismantled by the military at the outset of World War I, because the terminal near City Island was requisitioned.
A propeller-driven suspended monorail, claiming the speed of aircraft with the safety and reliability of railways was designed by George Bennie in 1926, and named the '[[Bennie Railplane]]'.  A demonstrator was built near [[Glasgow]] in 1929, but the system did not progress further in the UK.

Russia worked on a system similar to the Bennie Railplane in the 1930s and were even planning a 332-mile line through Turkestan with a top speed of 180&amp;nbsp;mph.  Their system was unique in that it had two side by side cars suspended on one rail, and it could actually dismount from the rail to cross rivers as an amphibian and then on the other side remount the rail.  And while elements of this system were tested in Moscow, the Russian government instead built a conventional rail system.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=YSgDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA33&amp;dq=Popular+Science+1933+plane+%22Popular+Science%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=iF1WTaWnOY66tgeC0YXHDA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAzge#v=onepage&amp;q=Popular%20Science%201933%20plane%20%22Popular%20Science%22&amp;f=true "Twin Amphibian Cars For Monorail"] ''Popular Science'', July 1934&lt;/ref&gt;

== The gyro monorail ==
[[File:Einschienerp.jpg|thumb|right|Brennan's Monorail]]
Perhaps the only true monorail was the [[Gyro Monorail]] developed independently by [[Louis Brennan]], [[August Scherl]] and [[Pyotr Shilovsky]].  This was a true single track train which used a gyroscope-based balancing system to remain upright.  All were demonstrated by full-scale prototypes, but development was effectively stopped by the First World War.  Brennan's design was given serious consideration for the [[North-West Frontier Province (1901-1955)|North-West Frontier]] of India, and a Schilovski monorail was proposed by the [[USSR]] government between [[Leningrad]] and [[Tsarskoye Selo]] in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In the early 1930s, New York city considered a monorail system, which would have been the first in the US.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=xSgDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA71&amp;dq=Popular+Science+1931+plane&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=5r8JTaa6Ismr8AaNmb2iAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwBzgU#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true "America's First Monorail Line Planned For New York", November 1930, Popular Science]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evolution of 'wheel on steel' monorail==
The vehicles referenced above (with the exception of the still in full service [[Wuppertal monorail]]) are now little more than historical curiosities. The advantage of the monorail of crossing rough mountainous terrain was relevant to the time of expansion of railway networks over virgin country, and in most cases the conventional railway proved the
more appropriate solution, except for a few niches. Monorail tracks were rarely longer than 60 miles, and usually considerably shorter. The motor road vehicle finally displaced the monorail from its few niche applications.

Wheel on steel characterised monorails of this early era, just as it does conventional railways, although some bicycle railways could react against the stabilizing rail to increase adhesion, improving acceleration, braking and hill climbing.

== The modern era: straddling beams ==
The development of automotive technology has given rise to a new class of [[monorail]] which owes little to the work of Palmer and Lartigue. These vehicles are suspended from or straddle concrete beams, and use pneumatic tyres to improve adhesion and reduce noise compared with wheel on steel. They have more in common with guided buses than conventional railways. The beam is less obtrusive than an overhead roadway or railway, and the modern designs may have a niche in dealing with right of way problems in congested city centres, at lower cost compared with tunneling.

'''''Humans Need Not Apply''''' is a 2014 short Internet video, directed, produced, written and edited by [[CGP Grey]]. The video focuses on the future of the integration of [[automation]] into economics, as well as the impact of this integration to the worldwide workforce. It was released online as a [[YouTube]] video.

==Premise==
[[File:Google's Lexus RX 450h Self-Driving Car.jpg|thumb|A Lexus RX 450h retrofitted as a self-driving car by Google|alt=Lexus RX 450h with attachment on top and Google logo on side]]
The video focuses on the topic of [[robot]]s' rapidly increasing usefulness through human society, discussing how [[automation]] will lead to a future where [[Wage labour|human labor]] is no longer needed.

Early on, an analogy is made describing how humans once displaced [[horse]]s from their jobs (by creating mechanical muscles such as [[car|automobiles]]), dismissing the argument that humans will always find new work, seeing as horses are not nearly as much used now. This analogy finishes by connecting the creation of mechanical minds, or "brain labor", will lead to robots ousting humans out of their occupations.&lt;ref name=Independent&gt;{{cite web |last = Pagano |first = Margareta |url = https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/comment/humans-need-not-apply-the-future-of-jobs-is-robotshaped-9673643.html |title = Humans need not apply: The future of jobs is robot-shaped |publisher = ''The Independent'' |date = August 17, 2014 |accessdate = August 23, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Grey also discusses how [[economics]] is the force behind a future based upon automation.&lt;ref name=Slate&gt;{{cite web |last = Griswold |first = Alison |url = http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2014/08/15/humans_need_not_apply_watch_a_dark_video_on_automation_and_human_work.html |title = Why the Future of Work Is Doomed, in One Video |publisher = ''Slate'' |work = Moneybox |date = August 15, 2014 |accessdate = August 23, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Grey concludes by stating that 45% of the workforce could be replaced by bots, a figure which is inclusive of [[profession]]al, [[White-collar worker|white-collar]] and low-skill occupations, and higher than the 25% unemployment figure of the [[Great Depression]].&lt;ref name=Mashable/&gt;&lt;ref name=BusinessInsider&gt;{{cite web |last = Love |first = Dylan |url = http://www.businessinsider.com/humans-need-not-apply-video-2014-8 |title = Not Even Doctors And Lawyers Are Safe From Machines Taking Their Jobs |publisher = ''Business Insider'' |date = August 13, 2014 |accessdate = August 23, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To take one specific example, the video states that there are 3&amp;nbsp;million driving jobs in the United States and 70&amp;nbsp;million worldwide.&lt;ref name=Independent/&gt; Grey further states that even creative occupations are not secure, mentioning the [[Music and artificial intelligence|bot-composed music]] in the background of his video.

Additionally, the viewer is reminded that the video is not discussing or portraying a future based upon [[science fiction]], using examples such as [[Baxter (robot)|Baxter]], [[Autonomous car|self-driving cars]] (referred to as autos in the video) and [[IBM|IBM's]] [[Watson (computer)|Watson]].&lt;ref name=Mashable&gt;{{cite web |last = Strange |first = Adario |url = http://mashable.com/2014/08/19/scary-smart-video-predicts-automation-will-make-human-work-obsolete-in-the-future/ |title = Scary Smart Video Predicts Automation Will Make Human Work Obsolete |publisher = ''Mashable'' |date = August 19, 2014 |accessdate = August 23, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HuffPost&gt;{{cite web |last = Ford |first = Martin |url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/martin-ford/humans-need-not-apply_b_5693808.html |title = The Robots Are Coming and 'Humans Need Not Apply' |publisher = ''Huffington Post'' |date = August 20, 2014 |accessdate = August 23, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production and funding==
The film was funded through [[Subbable]], a [[crowdfunding]] website. Grey used this website as a means to support his projects before moving to Subbable's successor, [[Patreon]].&lt;ref name=SubbableYear2&gt;{{cite web |last = Grey |first = CGP |url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=odmKYVm72LU&amp;list=UU2C_jShtL725hvbm1arSV9w |title = CGP Grey Crowdfunding, Year 2 |publisher = YouTube |work = CGP Grey |date = August 18, 2014 |accessdate = August 23, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''Humans Need Not Apply'' was covered by several publications, including ''[[Business Insider]]'', ''[[The Huffington Post]]'' and ''[[Forbes]]''.&lt;ref name=BusinessInsider/&gt;&lt;ref name=HuffPostUK&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2014/08/18/robots-steal-your-job_n_5687541.html |title = Why Robots Will Steal Your Job, In One 15 Minute Video |publisher = ''Huffington Post UK'' |date = August 18, 2014 |accessdate = August 23, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Forbes&gt;{{cite web |last = Kasanoff |first = Bruce |url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/brucekasanoff/2014/08/18/if-humans-need-not-apply-will-all-our-jobs-disappear/ |title = If 'Humans Need Not Apply,' Will All Our Jobs Disappear? |publisher = ''Forbes'' |date = August 18, 2014 |accessdate = August 23, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Coverage of the video complimented its presentation, calling the video "well-produced".&lt;ref name=HuffPost/&gt; These publications also praised its premise, calling it "thought-provoking", and "compelling", but also maintaining that the points and topics brought up in the video were "terrifying".&lt;ref name=Independent/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Roggeveen |first = Sam |url = http://www.lowyinterpreter.org/post/2014/08/18/Humans-need-not-apply-An-economic-horror-movie.aspx |title = Humans need not apply: An economic horror movie |publisher = ''The Interpreter'' |date = August 18, 2014 |accessdate = August 23, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bruce Kasanoff of ''Forbes'' commented that the video was "sobering," and "suggests, in a convincing fashion, that many human jobs will disappear over the coming years, because automation will do them faster, better, and cheaper."&lt;ref name=Forbes/&gt;
After a few days of release, the video reached one million views.&lt;ref name=Independent/&gt; {{As of|2018|4}}, ''Humans Need Not Apply'' has reached over 10&amp;nbsp;million views.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=CGP Grey|title=Humans Need Not Apply|date=2014-08-13|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Pq-S557XQU|accessdate=April 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hydrogen]] technologies are technologies that relate to the production and use of hydrogen. '''Hydrogen technologies''' are applicable for many uses.

Some hydrogen technologies are [[carbon neutral]] and could have a role in preventing [[climate change]] and a possible future [[hydrogen economy]]. Hydrogen is a chemical widely used in various applications including [[ammonia]] production, [[Oil refinery|oil refining]] and energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Badwal|first1=Sukhvinder P.S.|last2=Giddey|first2=Sarbjit|last3=Munnings|first3=Christopher|title=Hydrogen production via solid electrolytic routes|journal=Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Energy and Environment|volume=2|issue=5|pages=473–487|doi=10.1002/wene.50}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hydrogen is not a [[primary energy]] [[Energy development|source]], because it is not naturally occurring as a [[fuel]].  It is, however, widely regarded as an ideal [[energy storage]] medium, due to the ease with which electric power can convert water into its hydrogen and oxygen components through [[electrolysis]] and can be converted back to electrical power using a fuel cell. There are a wide number of different types of fuel and electrolysis cells.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Badwal|first1=SPS|title=Emerging electrochemical energy conversion and storage technologies|journal=Frontiers in Chemistry|date=2014|volume=2|doi=10.3389/fchem.2014.00079|url=http://journal.frontiersin.org/Journal/10.3389/fchem.2014.00079/abstract|pmid=25309898|pmc=4174133|page=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The potential environmental impact depends primarily on the methods used to generate the hydrogen fuel.

'''Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada''' ({{lang-fr|Innovation, Sciences et Développement économique Canada}}), or '''ISED''', formerly '''Industry Canada''', is the [[Ministry (government department)|department]] of the [[Government of Canada]] with a mandate of fostering a growing, competitive, and knowledge-based Canadian economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Treasury Board of Canada Secretariat|url=http://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/rpp/2012-2013/inst/dus/dus01-eng.asp#sec11|work=Report on Plans and Priorities|publisher=Government of Canada|accessdate=18 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ISED specifically supports Canadian innovation efforts, trade and investment, enterprise growth, and customized economic development in Canadian communities. 

ISED has three core responsibilities. These responsibilities are to oversee Canadian companies, investment and growth; people, skills and communities; and science, technology, research and commercialization.&lt;ref&gt; Treasury Board of Canada. (n.d.). Results. Retrieved from https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/ems-sgd/edb-bdd/index-eng.html#orgs/dept/130/infograph/results. &lt;/ref&gt; It addresses these responsibilities by doing work in four areas. These areas are research and development; economic development; market integrity, regulation, and competition; and internal services.&lt;ref&gt;Treasury Board Secretariat of Canada. (n.d.). What we do. Retrieved from https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/ems-sgd/edb-bdd/index-eng.html#orgs/dept/130/infograph/related&lt;/ref&gt; This work is done by distributing grants and contributions, providing programs and services, managing federal activities, and overseeing relevant regulation and legislation.&lt;ref&gt; Treasury Board Secretariat of Canada. (n.d.). How we help. Retrieved from https://www.tbs-sct.gc.ca/ems-sgd/edb-bdd/index-eng.html#orgs/dept/130/infograph/related &lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2018-19, ISED has emphasized the importance of women's entrepreneurship, innovation, and digital economy. ISED has also prioritized inclusivity, asserting that "our economy should work for all Canadians" &lt;ref&gt;Innovation, Science and Economic Development. (2017). 2018-19 Departmental Plan. Retrieved from https://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/017.nsf/eng/h_07608.html. p.1&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to fulfil this mandate among other responsibilities, ISED works in partnership with several organizations to address a broad and diverse range of economic variables across Canada. &lt;ref&gt;Innovation, Science and Economic Development. (2017). 2018-19 Departmental Plan. Retrieved from https://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/017.nsf/eng/h_07608.html.&lt;/ref&gt; 
These organizations focus on specific geographic regions or economic variables with the collective goal of strengthening the Canadian economy. 

There are six regional development agencies under ISED's portfolio which provide tailored support suited to the strengths and needs of different areas of Canada. These agencies include: the [[Atlantic Canada Opportunities Agency]], [[Economic_Development_Agency_of_Canada_for_the_Regions_of_Quebec|Canada Economic Development for Quebec Regions]], [[Canadian Northern Economic Development Agency]], [http://www.feddevontario.gc.ca/eic/site/723.nsf/%20eng/home Federal Economic Development Agency for Southern Ontario], [[Federal Economic Development Initiative for Northern Ontario]], and [[Western Economic Diversification Canada]]. ISED is also associated with a number of special operating agencies, shared-governance corporations, departmental corporations, crown corporations, departmental agencies and a joint enterprise. 

==History==

The Department of Trade and Commerce was created in statue on June 23rd, 1887 and proclaimed into force on December 3, 1892. In 1969 the Department of Trade and Commerce was replaced by the Department of Industry, Trade and Commerce. In 1990, Industry, Science and Technology replaced Industry, Trade and Commerce. This new department also absorbed the offices of the Minister of Regional Industrial Expansion and Minister of State for Science and Technology. This marked the inclusion of regional approaches and scientific emphasis in the development of Canadian industries. In 1993, the department expanded its portfolio further to include Consumer and Corporate Affairs.&lt;ref&gt;Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada. (2015).''Ministers.'' Retrieved from https://www.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/icgc.nsf/eng/00024.html. &lt;/ref&gt; In March 1995, the department was renamed Industry Canada. 
Upon the November 2015 installation of the [[29th Canadian Ministry]] led by Prime Minister [[Justin Trudeau]], the position of [[Minister of Industry]] was re-named [[Minister of Innovation, Science, and Economic Development]]. Subsequently Industry Canada was re-named Innovation, Science and Economic Development Canada.&lt;ref name="ctv-newposition"&gt;{{cite web|title=Trudeau government renames key departments|url=http://www.ctvnews.ca/politics/trudeau-government-renames-key-departments-1.2646008|website=CTV News|accessdate=16 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fp-ised"&gt;{{cite web|title=What happened to Industry Canada?

Tham|accessdate=2014-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; refers to the situation in a [[PID feedback controller]] where a large change in setpoint occurs (say a positive change) and the integral terms accumulates a significant error during the rise (windup), thus [[overshoot (signal)|overshooting]] and continuing to increase as this accumulated error is unwound (offset by errors in the other direction). The specific problem is the excess overshooting.

== Solutions ==
This problem can be addressed by
* Initialising the controller integral to a desired value, for instance to the value before the problem
* Increasing the setpoint in a suitable ramp
* Disabling the integral function until the to-be-controlled [[process variable]] (PV) has entered the controllable region
* Preventing the integral term from accumulating above or below pre-determined bounds
* Back-calculating the integral term to constrain the process output within feasible bounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cooper|first=Douglas|title=Integral (Reset) Windup, Jacketing Logic and the Velocity PI Form|url=http://www.controlguru.com/2008/021008.html|accessdate=2014-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Occurrence ==
Integral windup particularly occurs as a limitation of physical systems, compared with ideal systems, due to the ideal output being physically impossible (process [[Wiktionary:saturation|saturation]]: the output of the process being limited at the top or bottom of its scale, making the error constant). For example, the position of a valve cannot be any more open than fully open and also cannot be closed any more than fully closed. In this case, anti-windup can actually involve the integrator being turned off for periods of time until the response falls back into an acceptable range.

This usually occurs when the controller's output can no longer affect the controlled variable, or if the controller is part of a selection scheme and it is selected right.

Integral windup was more of a problem in [[analog electronics|analog]] controllers. Within modern [[Distributed Control System]]s and [[Programmable Logic Controller]]s, it is much easier to prevent integral windup by either limiting the controller output, or by using external reset feedback, which is a means of feeding back the selected output to the integral circuit of all controllers in the selection scheme so that a [[PID controller|closed loop]] is maintained.

'''Kadugodi''' ({{IPA-kn|Kāḍugōḍi}}), also known as '''Kadugudi'''  was founded by the great [[Cholas Dynasty]]. It is located in [[Whitefield, Bangalore|Whitefield]], [[Bangalore]] in the state of [[Karnataka]]. Kadugodi comes from "kadu" &amp; "Gudi" meaning "temple in a forest" in [[Kannada]]. It is believed that this whole area had thick vegetation consisting of soap-nut shrubs. The temple after which the place gets its name was also discovered by people venturing in to this kadu(forest) while gathering soap-nuts. This temple is of Anjaneya which is believed as udbhava murthi. Kadugudi is also referred to as "Aranayapuri" in temple related invites and publications.

Kadugodi has many temples and oldest among them are Anjaneya temple, kashi Vishwanatha temple, Ganesh temple, Eashwara temple and the grama devata temples of Maramma and Ganga parameshwari. All these temples are located in old kadugodi area starting from Bapuji circle up to Kashi vishwanatha temple.

Two major festivities of kadugudi is when Rathotsava(Charriot festival) are conducted for Eashwara and Rama deities. Lot of festivities are conducted before and after the actual rathotsava day.

Going by the street names of kadugudi one can deduce that this place must have been a well planned out settlement. There is a kumbhara beedi(potter street), there is Ganigara beedi(vegetable oil extractors), Angadi beedi(Market street), balajigara beedhi(mainly merchants dealing in bangles, flowers etc.).

In 1970s kadugodi saw its first extension towards west as Village Panchyat extension or simple referred to as new extension or VP extension. In 1980s saw another extension in eastern direction when a new extension was formed by free distribution of plots to economically deserving families. This was done by the Eashwara temple family and was named after Shree Shankar Dixit, this area now is popularly known as Shankara pura.

==Climate==
'''Kadugudi''' is known for its pleasant climate throughout the year. Its elevation is the highest among the major large cities of [[India]].

[[File:View of street in kadugodi.jpg|thumb|View of inside Kadugodi.]]

Kadugudi has a [[tropical savanna climate]] ([[Köppen climate classification]] ''Aw'') with distinct [[wet season|wet]] and [[dry season|dry]] seasons. Due to its high elevation, Kadugudi usually enjoys a more moderate climate throughout the year, although occasional heat waves can make summer somewhat uncomfortable The coolest month is December with an average low temperature of {{convert|19.4|°C}} and the hottest month is April with an average high temperature of {{convert|36|°C|0}}. The highest temperature ever recorded in Kadugudi is {{convert|36.8|°C}} (recorded in March 2012). However, the suburbs of Kadugudi recorded temperatures as high as {{convert|39|°C|0}}. The lowest ever recorded is {{convert|9.8|°C|0}} (recorded in January 2013).

Winter temperatures rarely drop below {{convert|12|°C}}, and summer temperatures seldom exceed {{convert|37|°C}}. Kadugodi receives rainfall from both the northeast and the southwest [[monsoon]]s and the wettest months are September, October and August, in that order. The summer heat is moderated by fairly frequent [[thunderstorm]]s. The heaviest rainfall recorded in a 13-hour period in recorded on 17 October 2014

'''Katharine Stinson''' was an American aeronautical engineer and the [[Federal Aviation Administration]]'s first female engineer.  Born in [[Fuquay-Varina, North Carolina]] 14 years after the Wright Brothers made their first flight on North Carolina's Outer Banks, Stinson loved airplanes.  A ride from famed aviator [[Edward Stinson|Eddie Stinson]] (no relation) solidified her goal of learning to fly.&lt;ref name="true stories of women engineers"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hatch|first1=Sybil E.|title=Changing our world : true stories of women engineers|date=2006|publisher=American Soc. of Civil Engineers|location=Reston, Va|isbn=9780784408353|pages=145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While working as a mechanic's assistant at the [[Raleigh Municipal Airport]] at age 15, Stinson met [[Amelia Earhart]].  When Stinson told Earhart about her flight training, Earhart encouraged her to study engineering instead telling her that she would never make enough money as a pilot.  Stinson took that advice, enrolling in physics classes in high school and applied to the engineering program at [[North Carolina State University|North Carolina State College]].&lt;ref name=papers&gt;{{cite web|title=Katharine Stinson Papers, 1937-2001      {{!}} NCSU Special Collections Research Center Collection Guides|url=http://www.lib.ncsu.edu/findingaids/mc00256/|publisher=North Carolina State Libraries}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stinson's 1936 application to the engineering school was declined by Dean Wallace Riddick who met with her explaining that the college would not accept women as freshman.  Stinson responded by accepting a scholarship to nearby [[Meredith College]] where she completed all 48 required credit hours in a single year.  She enrolled in the engineering program the following fall as one of the few female students at the college and only female in the engineering department.  She graduated in 1941 with a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering with an aeronautical option, the first woman to do so at the college and one of just five women in the country that year to earn a degree in engineering or architecture.&lt;ref name=papers/&gt;

Following graduation, she was the first female engineer hired by the [[Civil Aviation Administration]].  During her 32-year career she specialized in aircraft safety developing standards for supersonic transports which were used to create the [[concorde]] and pioneering distribution of aircraft structural issues.  She retired from the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] in 1974 as Technical Assistant to the Chief of Aircraft Engineering.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rice|first1=Tony|title=Amelia Earhart's advice spurred NC State's 1st female engineering grad|url=http://www.wral.com/amelia-earhart-s-advice-spurred-nc-state-s-1st-female-engineering-grad/15775707/|work=WRAL.com|date=13 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During her career she was active in the [[Ninety-Nines: International Organization of Women Pilots]] and helped found the [[Society of Women Engineers]] where she served as president from 1953 to 1955.  She also served on President [[Lyndon Johnson]]'s Women's Advisory Committee on Aviation from 1964 to 1970, served as an officer in the [[Institute of Aeronautical Sciences]]. Stinson also belonged to the [[Soroptimist Club]], serving president from 1970 to 1972.&lt;ref name=papers/&gt;

In 1997 North Carolina State University named her a distinguished alumnus and named Katharine Stinson Drive on campus in her honor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NCSU Timelines|url=http://historicalstate.lib.ncsu.edu/timelines/women|website=historicalstate.lib.ncsu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{italic title}}
'''''Let's Go''''' is a series of [[American English|American-English]] based [[English as a second or foreign language|EFL]] (English as a foreign language) [[textbook]]s developed by [[Oxford University Press]] and first released in 1990. While having its origins in [[English as a second or foreign language|ESL]] teaching in the US, and then as an early EFL resource in Japan,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://oupeltglobalblog.com/2011/06/09/20-years-of-learning-and-playing-with-lets-go/|title=20 years of learning and playing with Let’s Go - Oxford University Press|date=2011-06-09|work=Oxford University Press|access-date=2018-02-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; the series is currently in general use for [[English-language learner]]s in over 160 countries around the world.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The series is now in its 4th edition, which was released in 2017, although the 3rd series is still in print.

== Development ==
The series was written by two (at that time) US-based [[English as a second or foreign language|EFL/ESL]] teachers and two Asia-based teachers.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://teflology-podcast.com/2017/05/24/episode-60-young-learner-materials-with-the-lets-go-authors/|title=Episode 60: Young Learner Materials with the ‘Let’s Go’ Authors|date=2017-05-24|work=The TEFLology Podcast|access-date=2018-02-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ritsuko Nakata gained a BA from the [[University of California]] in Los Angeles, and has been involved in ELT for over 30 years, and is currently President of IIEEC, Teacher Training Center for English Teachers of Children, and President of AETC, The Association of English Teachers, based in Japan. Karen Frazier Tsai (cited as Karen Frazier) has 20 years experience of teaching ESL and has worked and travelled throughout Asia, Europe, and North America. Barbara Hoskins Sakamoto (cited as Barbara Hoskins) gained her MA in Teaching English as a Second Language from [[Northern Arizona University]], and had been based in Japan since 1985. [[Carolyn Graham]] is the creator of [[Jazz Chants]], which connect the rhythm of spoken American English to the beat of jazz.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Lets-Go-Student-Book-Workbook/dp/0194643174|title=Let's Go: 3a: Student Book and Workbook|date=2012-03-15|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780194643177|edition= New |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Nakata:&lt;blockquote&gt;In 1989, I was approached by the senior editor of Oxford University Press in New York asking me about what the Japanese market needed in terms of a new textbook. At the time, the only texts available were ESL texts that were written for students learning English in English speaking countries, so they were not appropriate for our Japanese students who were coming to class just once a week.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iieec.com/en/letsgo/index.html|title=IIEEC　Teacher Training Center|website=www.iieec.com|access-date=2018-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;According to Hoskins:&lt;blockquote&gt;''Let’s Go'' has been a remarkably collaborative piece of publishing. It was one of Oxford’s first publishing projects which worked with authors living in different countries. When we first started, I lived in California, Karen Frazier (Tsai) lived in Taipei, Ritsuko Nakata was in Tokyo, and Carolyn Graham was in New York. Back then, we felt quite high tech with our desk top computers and fax machines–there was no internet or email yet!&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.teachingvillage.org/about-lets-go/|title=Let's Go - Teaching Village|work=Teaching Village|access-date=2018-02-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Titles ==
The series is targeted towards an age range of 5–13 years of age (levels beginner to pre-intermediate).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://elt.oup.com/catalogue/items/global/young_learners/lets_go_fourth_edition/?cc=jp&amp;selLanguage=en|title=Let's Go {{!}} Oxford University Press|last=WEBSTER|first=ROBIN|website=elt.oup.com|language=en|access-date=2018-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1st series (Books 1-6) was published in 1990, the 2nd in 2000,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mikasabookcenter.jp/156.html|title=Oxford University Press ＞ Let' Go 2nd Edition シリーズ|website=www.mikasabookcenter.jp|access-date=2018-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; the 3rd in 2008,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.co.jp/Lets-Go-3-Student-Book/dp/0194394344|title=Let's Go 3 Student Book|last=Nakata|first=Ritsuko|date=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780194394345|location=Oxford; New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the 4th in 2017. The lower level ''Let's Go Starter'' (by Nakata, Hoskins, and Frazier) was first released in 1997, before being replaced by ''Let's'' ''Begin'' in later series.
* ''Let's Begin''
* ''Let's Go 1''
* ''Let's Go 2''
* ''Let's Go 3''
* ''Let's Go 4''
* ''Let's Go 5''
* ''Let's Go 6''
Ancillary publications include workbooks for each of the levels, ''Let's Go Phonics'' (by Jeffrrey Lehman), ''Let's Chant, Let's Sing'' (by Graham), and ''Let's Go Picture Dictionary'' (by Nakata, Frazier, and Hoskins).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eltbooks.com/item_list.php?cat=017&amp;lang=en|title=Let's Go {{!}} ELTBOOKS.com|website=ELTBOOKS.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Available resources include teacher books, classroom CDs, teacher [[Flashcard|vocabulary cards]] and student vocabulary cards.

== Methodology ==
The series claims to improve student learning and classroom pedagogy in the following ways:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eltbooks.com/item_spec.php?item=304000&amp;cat=017|title=Let's Go (Fourth Edition)|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=2018-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Conversations and question-and-answer practice get children talking from the very beginning.
* Interactive songs and chants by Carolyn Graham bring classrooms to life.
* Supported by 'Let's Chant, Let's Sing: Greatest Hits' CD with additional worksheets.
* Phonics and reading lessons help children to read fluently. Fun phonics chants and drum tracks improve pronunciation and intonation.
* Communication games give children many more opportunities to use English with confidence.
* Test Center CD-ROM includes placement tests, Cambridge YLE practice tests, and print-ready and editable unit, mid-term, and final tests.
* Bring language learning alive with Online Practice, an interactive homework system that you can assign and track.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="732">In [[missile guidance]], '''Line of sight''' is the straight line between the [[missile]] and the [[Targeting (warfare)|target]]. At the end of the engagement the distance will be zero. See [[Command guidance#Command to Line-Of-Sight (CLOS)]].

By [[Pursuit guidance]] the missile is steered so that the [[velocity]] vector of the missile always points at the target, i.e. has the direction of the Line of sight.

==Voice and data service operators==
These providers offer services to individuals for personal use. Providers offering services to businesses are listed in a later section.

Many of the Mobile Virtual Network Operators (MVNOs) are often partnered with one (and sometimes more) host carrier companies. Providers with multiple host networks only use one depending on the specific model phone and/or [[SIM card]] used, except [[Google Fi]] which combines all listed networks together. MVNOs will often push/favor a specific model phone because it's locked into the host carrier "preferred network" that gives that MVNO the best deal/rates. The acronym "'''BYOD'''" means "[[Bring Your Own Device]]".

A '''miller''' is a person who operates a [[Gristmill|mill]], a machine to grind a [[cereal crop]] to make [[flour]]. [[Mill (grinding)|Milling]] is among the oldest of human occupations. "Miller", "Milne", and other variants are common surnames,&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books|k8hrAAAAMAAJ|Surname Book and Racial History: A Compilation and Arrangement of ...|page=165}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|165}} as are their equivalents in other languages around the world ("[[Melnyk (surname)|Melnyk]]" in [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], "[[Meunier (disambiguation)|Meunier]]" in [[French language|French]], "[[Müller (surname)|Müller]]" or "[[German surname|Mueller]]" in [[German language|German]], "[[Mulder]]" and "[[Molenaar]]" in [[Dutch language|Dutch]], "[[Molnár]]" in [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], "[[Molinero]]" in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], "[[Molinaro]]" or "[[Molinari]]" in [[Italian language|Italian]] etc.). Milling existed in [[hunter-gatherer]] communities, and later millers were important to the [[history of agriculture|development of agriculture]].

The materials ground by millers are often [[foodstuff]]s and particularly [[cereal|grain]].  The physical grinding of the food allows for the easier digestion of its [[nutrient]]s and saves wear on the teeth. Non-food substances needed in a fine, powdered form, such as [[building materials]], may be processed by a miller.

== Quern-stone ==
[[Image:Bedandrind.jpg|A Bedstone &amp; the Rind.|Px150|left|thumb|A bedstone and rind. [[Dalgarven Mill]], Scotland.]]
The most basic tool for a miller was the [[quern-stone]]—simply a large, fixed stone as a base and another movable stone operated by hand, similar to a [[mortar and pestle]].  As technology and [[millstones]] (the [[bedstone]] and [[Millrind|rynd]]) improved, more elaborate machines such as [[watermill]]s and [[windmill]]s were developed to do the grinding work. These mills harnessed available energy sources including animal, water, wind, and electrical power.  Mills are some of [[mill (factory)|the oldest factories]] in human history, so factories making other items are sometimes known as mills, for example, [[cotton mill]]s and [[steel mill]]s.  These factory workers are also called millers.

The rynd in [[history of Scotland|pre-reformation Scotland]] was often carved on millers' gravestones as a symbol of their trade.

== Status ==
In a traditional [[rural]] society, a miller is often wealthier than ordinary peasants, which can lead to jealousy and to millers being targeted in [[bread riots]] at times of [[famine]]. Conversely, millers might be in a stronger position vis-a-vis [[feudal]] land owners than are ordinary peasants.

== Carnival ==
[[Image:Monselice z21.JPG|thumb|right|A man dressed as a [[Middle Ages|medieval]] miller at a festival in [[Monselice]], in [[Italy]].]]
The traditional carnival held annually in the city of [[Ivrea#Culture|Ivrea]], [[Italy]] commemorates a spirited "Mugnaia" (miller's daughter) who supposedly  refused to let a local duke exercise his [[right of the first night]], and proceeded to chop the duke's head off and spark a revolution. Whatever the historical validity  of the story, it is significant it was the daughter of a miller to whom folk tradition assigned this rebellious role.

==Miller's thumb==
As an important part of his job, the miller repeatedly takes into his hand samples of the ground meal coming out of the spout in order to feel the quality and character of the product. The miller rubs the grain between his thumb and forefinger. After years of doing this the miller's thumb changes shape and becomes broad and flattened. This is known as a "miller's thumb".

Sayings such as "worth a millerˈs thumb" and "an honest miller hath a golden thumb" refers to the profit the miller makes as a result of this skill.

The shape of a miller's thumb is said to have the appearance of the head of a fish. The [[European bullhead]] (''Cottus gobio''), a freshwater fish, is commonly called a miller's thumb for this reason.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=qrhHAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA297&amp;dq=%22Miller%27s+thumb%22+etymology&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj4naHviNvSAhUnDcAKHdjQCew4FBDoAQg6MAY#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Miller's%20thumb%22%20etymology&amp;f=false ''The Athenaeum'', Issues 375-426 (London, 1835) p. 297].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Mind control]]''' has proven a popular subject in fiction, featuring in books and films such as ''[[The Manchurian Candidate]]'' (1959; [[The Manchurian Candidate (1962 film)|film adaptation 1962]]) and ''[[The IPCRESS File]]'' (1962; [[The Ipcress File (film)|film 1965]]), both stories advancing the premise that controllers could hypnotize a person into murdering on command while retaining no memory of the killing. As a narrative device, mind control serves as a convenient means of introducing changes in the behavior of characters, and is used as a device for raising tension and audience uncertainty in the contexts of the [[Cold War]] and [[terrorism]].  Mind control has often been an important theme in [[science fiction]] and [[fantasy]] stories.  Terry O'Brian comments:  "Mind control is such a powerful image that if [[hypnotism]] did not exist,  then something similar would have to have been invented: the plot device is too useful for any writer to ignore.   The fear of mind control is equally as powerful an image."&lt;ref&gt;Terry O'Brian in ''The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy: Themes, Works, and Wonders, Volume 1'', Gary Westfahl editor,  Greenwood Publishing Group, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

==Science fiction==
* In the movie series ''[[Men in Black (film series)|Men in Black]]'', a device used for [[Memory erasure|memory erasing]] (known as the [[Neuralyzer]]) is used frequently by Agents Kay and Jay.
* In the television series ''[[Doctor Who]]'', there are multiple stories involving mind control.
**[[Master (Doctor Who)|The Master]] is able to control the minds of individuals with a weak will by looking into their eyes, a form of [[hypnosis]].  In ''[[The Sound of Drums]]'' he is able to do this on a massive scale through the Archangel satellite network, but this backfires when the Doctor manages to use the network to defeat him.
**In ''[[Rise of the Cybermen]]'' and ''[[The Age of Steel]]'', EarPods are devices which can place the user into a trance-state and download information directly into their brain, as well as other features such as communication. EarPods are widely used in a parallel universe, worn in both ears. Unbeknownst to the users, the EarPods could also mind control as the population's EarPods were activated and controlled them to walk to a conversion factory and be converted into [[Cybermen]].
**A similar method of control by the Cybermen reappears in ''[[Army of Ghosts]]''. Workers at the Torchwood Institute wore a communication earpiece. As some workers were captured by the Cybermen, their earpieces were manipulated to control them with the worker reemerging with an earpiece in each ear. It was later found that the earpieces were connected to the brain through artificial tissue.
* In the [[Anthony Burgess]] novel ''[[A Clockwork Orange (novel)|A Clockwork Orange]]'', later [[A Clockwork Orange (film)|adapted into a film]] by [[Stanley Kubrick]], the "Ludovico Technique" is a form of mind control that causes the subject, in this case the thug anti-hero Alex, to feel sickness and pain whenever he has a violent or anti-social impulse. This backfires because of Alex's association with the music of Ludwig van Beethoven to ultraviolence, an unintended side effect means that he has the same physical reaction to the music alone, which is exploited later by a man whose wife Alex had raped.
* 
* Mind control (telepathic hypnosis) is a prominent psionic gift in the ''[[Scanners]]'' series of films. It is used by the Scanners to escape imprisonment in the first film, and to sometimes control others in the subsequent films.
* 
* George Orwell's novel ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' features a description of mind control, both directly by torture, and indirectly, in the form of pervasive mind control by the use of [[Newspeak]], a [[constructed language]] designed to remove the possibility, [[Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis|Sapir-Whorf-wise]] of articulating or of even thinking [[subversive]] thoughts.
* 
* The [[Jedi mind trick]] is a prominent plot device in the ''[[Star Wars]]'' [[saga]].
* 
* In ''[[The Matrix]]'', a chemical was injected into Morpheus to make him reveal access codes.
* 
* In Michael Crichton's novel ''[[The Terminal Man]]'', the Terminal Man has doctors implant a simple computer into the brainstem of a man who suffers from impulsive violence. The plan is to stimulate certain nerves to ease the violent impulses. Instead, the violence becomes even more irresistible.
* 
* In the anime, movie and video game series ''[[Street Fighter 2]]'', the main villain, known as M. Bison uses his "Psycho Power" to brainwash and corrupt street fighters across the world into joining his criminal organization known as [[Shadowloo]], turning them into remorseless killing machines fully under his control.
* 
* In the ''[[X-Men]]'' [[comic book]] series, [[Professor Xavier]], can read and control people's minds. Mind control and other [[psychic]] abilities are relatively common mutations in the X-Men universe; other people with this ability include [[Emma Frost]] and, to a lesser degree, [[Jean Grey]].
* 
* ''[[The House of the Scorpion]]'' is a [[science fiction]] book in which people have computer chips implanted in their brain, allowing them to only do what they are 'programmed' to do. These people are referred to as 'Eejits'.
* 
* In the anime series, ''[[Code Geass]]'', the protagonist, [[Lelouch Lamperouge]], gets the ability, Geass, which gives him a form of mind control by allowing him to give someone an absolute order, by looking them in the eye.
* 
* In the film ''[[Control Factor]]'', an unsuspecting "everyman" slowly realizes he is an unwitting guinea pig being used in a mind control test. If successful, the test will then expand to behavioral control of an entire population.
* 
* In the ''[[Resident Evil]]'' films, based on the video game series of the same name, the fictional [[Umbrella Corporation]] captures and brainwashes the protagonist, [[Alice (Resident Evil)|Alice]] (portrayed by [[Milla Jovovich]]), as part of their "Program: Alice" experiment.
* 
* In the ''[[Bionicle]]'' storyline, a Kanohi mask called Komau allows the user the power to control minds of beings.
* 
* In [[Samuel Youd|John Christopher]]'s ''[[The Tripods|Tripods]]'' trilogy, the alien Masters control all of humanity via devices called Caps which are permanently affixed to the skull. The Caps received signals broadcast by equipment in the Masters' cities.
* 
* In ''[[Empire of the Ants]]'', giant ants used a white gas to control the minds of humans.
* 
* In ''[[Stargate SG-1]]'', the [[Goa'uld]] had brainwashing technology that is used several times over the show and proves both easy and difficult to defeat depending on what technique is used.
* 
* In ''[[Stargate Universe]]'', using presumably left-over [[Goa'uld]] technology, the [[Lucian Alliance]] are able to brainwash their enemies into becoming spies for them as they do with Colonel [[David Telford]].  This brainwashing is difficult to break as shown with Telford: the characters were forced to evacuate the air in the room he was in, let him die for a short period of time then revive him.  Those brainwashed are shown to remember their actions as Telford remembers everything he did.
* 
* In ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'', there are at least three episodes featuring Mind Control:
**In "[[The Mind's Eye (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|The Mind's Eye]]",  [[Geordi La Forge]] is brainwashed into becoming an assassin by the [[Romulans]] to reignite hostilities between [[Federation (Star Trek)|The Federation]] and the [[Klingon]] Empire.  The depiction of brainwashing in the episode relies upon feeding images and impulses directly into La Forge's cortex via his VISOR interface.
**In "[[The Game (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|The Game]]", the crew of the ''Enterprise'' is controlled using a device that has the user playing a simple 3D game and provides direct stimulation to the pleasure centers of the brain while affecting their higher reasoning functions.  The Ktarians use this to attempt to get the crew to entice other members of Starfleet to play the game, eventually controlling the entire Federation.
**In the two part "[[Chain of Command (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Chain of Command]]" episode [[Jean-Luc Picard|Captain Picard]] is captured and a [[Cardassian]] agent uses traditional methods of brain-washing (sensory deprivation, sensory bombardment, forced nakedness, stress positions, dehydration, starvation, physical pain, and cultural humiliation).
*

* In ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'' the episode "[[Equinox (Star Trek: Voyager)|Equinox]]", Seven's brain is operated on by the unethical doctor to reveal codes she refuses to give.
*
* In the [[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987 TV series)|1987 animated Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles TV series]] season 3 episode "[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (1987 TV series) (season 3)|Corporate Raiders from Dimension X]]", [[Shredder (Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles)|Shredder]] kidnapps businessmen all across [[New York City]] and takes them to the Octopus Inc. headquarters, where he brainwashes them by indoctrination to carry out crimes, and kidnap more businessmen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/shows/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-1987/corporate-raiders-from-dimension-x-70678/|title=Corporate Raiders from Dimension X|publisher=TV.com|date=22 November 1989|access-date=1 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*
* In the first season of the ''[[Netflix]]'' original series ''[[Marvel's Jessica Jones]]'', main antagonist Kilgrave—known in comics as [[Purple Man]]—has the ability to compel people to obey his orders. He uses this power to force protagonist Jessica into an abusive relationship. Within the series' context, Kilgrave's mind control is an allegory for manipulative and abusive behavior. Jessica's enhanced strength and her resistance to Kilgrave's abilities, on the other hand, embody free will and [[women's empowerment]].

* Several ''[[Batman (comics)|Batman]]'' villains have the power of hypnosis; examples include the [[Mad Hatter (comics)|Mad Hatter]], who relies on various technological devices to brainwash individuals, and [[Poison Ivy (comics)| Poison Ivy]], who uses [[pheromone]]s, plant-based creations, and occasionally supernatural means to take control of others, especially men.

==Video games==
*In the ''[[Danganronpa]]'' series, the main antagonist, Junko Enoshima, brainwashes multiple people into committing acts of despair, for example brainwashing the 77th Class of Hope's Peak Academy and converting them into Ultimate Despair.
*In the [[MMORPG]] ''[[Star Wars: The Old Republic]]'', players that choose a force user class can occasionally force persuade a NPC during conversations, which sometimes allow the player to manipulate the actions and decisions of NPCs. This ability may change the outcome and situation of the dialogue.
*In the MMORPG ''[[City of Heroes]]'', players of the Controller class can opt for the primary list of powers dubbed Mind Control, which includes the ability to affect emotions remotely, confuse, inhibit or affect physical actions, and cause psionic damage to opponents.
*In the MMORPG ''[[World of Warcraft]]'', players of the [[Classes in World of Warcraft#Priest|priest]] class gain the ability to mind-control other humanoid characters, gaining full control over their actions for a short period. (Due to interface limitations, priests cannot do anything else while controlling a target.)
*The character [[Yuri (Command &amp; Conquer)|Yuri]] in ''[[Command &amp; Conquer: Red Alert 2]]'' is an extremely advanced telepath with the capability of completely controlling the actions of others. There is one flaw, however: a mind-controlled person can be seen to be showing strain against Yuri's power, culminating in [[sweating]], [[stammering]] and [[memory loss]]. Later, in the game expansion ''[[Yuri's Revenge]]'', he leads an entire faction with several mind controlling units included. His "psychic dominators" also possess the ability to permanently mind control units.
*In ''[[Metal Gear Solid]]'', Psycho Mantis, a rogue special forces member with powerful telepathic abilities, subtly controls a small army, and on several occasions completely dominates a single person's movements and speech.
*In ''[[Sonic Pinball Party]]'', [[Doctor Eggman]], Sonic's nemesis, turns all the people into robots, kidnaps Sonic's assistant [[Miles "Tails" Prower]] and Sonic's love interest [[Amy Rose]], ties them up to a chair, puts them on a device and brainwashes them.

*In ''[[Dreamfall: The Longest Journey]]'', the mysterious Project Alchera is revealed to be a form of mind-control, marketed to the masses as a form of entertainment.
*In the series ''[[Destroy All Humans!]]'', the main character, Cryptosporidium, can use mind control to force humans to do his bidding.
*In ''[[BioShock]]'', the player's character, [[Jack (BioShock)|Jack]], is revealed to have been subconsciously mind-controlled and must obey any action stated after the command phrase, "Would you Kindly?".
*In ''[[Super Paper Mario]]'', the character Nastasia has the ability to brainwash people by looking them in the eyes, this is the way she brainwashes [[Luigi]] as well as [[Bowser (character)|Bowser]]'s Goomba and Koopa army.
*In ''[[Resident Evil 4]]'', the enemies are civilians mind-controlled through the use of parasites known as "Las Plagas"; in ''[[Resident Evil 5]]'', the main antagonist, [[List of Resident Evil characters#Albert Wesker|Albert Wesker]], uses a special drug to brainwash a recurring protagonist, [[List of Resident Evil characters#Jill Valentine|Jill Valentine]].
*In ''[[Call of Duty: Black Ops]]'', the protagonist, Alex Mason, is brainwashed while imprisoned in the [[Vorkuta Gulag]].
*In the Mass Effect series the primary antagonists, the Reapers, use a form of mind control called "indoctrination" to manipulate people into becoming willing servants and thralls.
*In the critically acclaimed [[DC Comics]] video game ''[[Batman: Arkham City]]'', highly trained mercenaries loyal to a rogue [[private military company|private military firm]], Tyger Security, have been systematically programmed (through a combination of [[psychoactive drugs]] and [[posthypnotic suggestion|posthypnotic]] manipulation) to blindly hate the protagonist and answer only to their employer, the ruthless [[Hugo Strange]]. Following Strange's death late in the game's storyline these effects seem to have been broken, as Tyger units promptly cease following current orders and withdraw quietly from the scene.
*In ''[[Final Fantasy IV]]'', the playable character Kain is mind controlled by Golbez to act as his lieutenant to seize crystals around the earth.  Later, it is revealed that Golbez himself was controlled by Zemus.

*In ''[[Lego Batman: The Videogame|Lego Batman]]'', some of the playable villain characters can use a power called mind control, which allows them to take control of an enemy to open doors or reach inaccessible areas.
*In the ''[[X-COM]]'' series, mind control is a possible ability certain aliens or soldiers are able to employ against each other in the game.
*In ''[[Super Mario Odyssey]]'', Mario can throw Cappy on enemies or other objects to temporally control them.

==Other fiction==
The TV series ''[[The Prisoner]]'' featured mind control as a recurring plot element.

In the Korean mini-series ''[[Winter Sonata]]'' the protagonist has his memory altered by a clinical psychiatrist at his mother's request which forms the crux of the plot as he struggles to overcome it.

In the movie ''[[Conspiracy Theory (film)|Conspiracy Theory]]'', Mel Gibson plays Jerry Fletcher, a cab driver and a conspiracy theorist who accidentally hits a truth involving a secret government-funded mind control program, as it turns out Jerry himself is one of the subjects of the program.

In [[Judy Malloy]]'s ''Revelations of Secret Surveillance'', a group of artists and writers struggle to understand and expose a covert system that utilizes psychodrama and brain scanning surveillance to interfere with the lives of artists, activists, and many other people.

The novel ''[[Trilby]]'' (1894) features the character [[Svengali]], who hypnotizes the novel's heroine to enhance her singing performance. The character gained popularity as the stereotype of an evil hypnotist, and became the basis for feature films throughout the 20th century.

In [[Aldous Huxley]]'s ''[[Brave New World]]'', a technique called hypnopaedia is used to condition children to be obedient citizens.

An adaptation of [[Kurt Vonnegut]]'s "Harrison Bergeron", was made into a film ''[[Harrison Bergeron (film)|Harrison Bergeron]]'', a 1995 production. Everyone but the elite had "handicapping" devices attached to their brains.

Mr. Big, one of the antagonists in the [[PBS Kids GO!]] series ''[[WordGirl]]'', frequently uses mind control to entice people to buy his products.

Queen Chrysalis, a powerful antagonist of [[Hub Network|the Hub]] series ''[[My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic]]'', has the gift of mind control via emotional manipulation and metamorphic abilities. In "[[A Canterlot Wedding]]", she uses this ability to disguise herself as Princess Cadence and bring the princess's fiancee Shining Armor under her spell, as well as manipulating Cadence's bridesmaids to become her servants. Starlight Glimmer, another antagonist, used a combination of a magic staff and more traditional forms of mind control (including solitary confinement, denial of care, and constantly broadcasting messages via loudspeaker) to create a [[cult]] of ponies obsessed with the idea of conformity.

In the ''[[The Monkees (TV series)|Monkees]]'' episode "The Frodis Caper", an insane wizard captures a sentient potted plant from outer space and attempts world domination by broadcasting the plant's mind-control eye over television.

In the American [[soap opera]] ''[[Days of Our Lives]]'', several characters including [[John Black (Days of Our Lives)|John Black]], [[Hope Brady]], and [[Steve Johnson (Days of Our Lives)|Steve Johnson]], were subjected to brainwashing and mind control by [[Stefano DiMera]] and other villains, in order to turn them into assassins and mob "soldiers".

==Entertainment==

[[Hypnotism]] has often been used by stage performers to induce volunteers do strange things, such as clucking like a chicken, for the entertainment of audiences. The British psychological illusionist [[Derren Brown]] performs more sophisticated mental tricks in his television programmes, ''Derren Brown: Mind Control''.

The late Russian psychic, [[Wolf Messing]], was said to be able to hand somebody a blank piece of paper and make them see money or whatever he wanted them to see.

'''Mobile ticketing''' is the process whereby customers can order, pay for, obtain and/or validate [[electronic ticket|ticket]]s using [[mobile phone]]s.  Mobile tickets reduce the production and distribution costs connected with traditional paper-based ticketing channels and increase customer [[convenience]] by providing new and simple ways to purchase tickets.

Mobile tickets should not be confused with E-Tickets (electronic tickets) which are used by airlines since 1994, they can be sent by e-mail, printed and shown at the check-in desk at the airport to obtain a boarding pass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IATA Press Release No.: 25, Date: 31 May 2008|URL=https://www.iata.org/pressroom/pr/Pages/2008-31-05-01.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many train and bus operators in Europe have created phone apps in which tickets can be bought and stored. These include but are not limited to  [[SJ AB|SJ]], [[DSB (railway company)|DSB]], [[Norwegian State Railways|NSB]], [[Deutsche Bahn|DB]] and selected local transit authorities.

== History ==

Philips and Sony developed near field communication (NFC) in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nokia, Philips And Sony Establish The Near Field Communication (NFC) Forum|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628203003/http://www.nfc-forum.org/news/pr/view?item_key=d8968a33b4812e2509e5b74247d1366dc8ef91d8}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is build on the same basis as common contactless smartcards. Philips published an early paper on NFC in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{
    cite web|title=Near Field Communication, Philips, 2004
    |url=http://www.sacg.com.tw/sacweb/marcom/epaper/images/NFC.pdf
}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, the NFC Forum was established.
NFC incorporated in a mobile phone allows all kind of novel contactless applications, mobile ticketing being an important one of them.
Mobile Tickets can be purchased via internet and will be downloaded in a few seconds to the mobile phone, be it in an sms with a 2-D barcode or to the connected NFC chip. In case of NFC at entrance the phone just has to be touched to the scanning device (in fact it makes contact within 10&amp;nbsp;cm). The GSM Association, GSMA, published a whitepaper on M-Ticketing in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GSMS M-Ticketing Whitepaper|URL=http://nfc-forum.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/12/GSMA-Mobile-Ticketing-White-Paper.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It describes extensively the use and advantages of M-Ticketing, principally the use of NFC technology. They state that NFC is the best technology but "it is expected however that M-Ticketing services using SMS and Bar Code implementations will be prevalent until the point that a critical mass of NFC enabled handsets is available."

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4226">'''Molecular Conductance''' (&lt;math&gt;G=I/V&lt;/math&gt;), or the [[Electrical conductance|conductance]] of a single [[molecule]], is a physical quantity in [[molecular electronics]]. Molecular conductance is dependent on the surrounding conditions (e.g. [[pH]], temperature, pressure), as well as the properties of measuring device. Many experimental techniques have been developed in an attempt to measure this quantity directly, but theorists and experimentalists still face many challenges.&lt;ref&gt;Chen F, Hihath J, Huang Z, Li X, Tao NJ. 2007. Measurement of single-molecule conductance. ''Annu. Rev. Phys. Chem.'' 58:535-64&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

Recently, a great deal of progress has been made in the development of reliable conductance-measuring techniques. These techniques can be divided into two categories: molecular film experiments, which measure groups of tens of molecules, and single-molecule-measuring experiments.
==Molecular film experiments== 
'''Molecular film experiments''' generally consist of the sandwiching of a thin layer of molecules between two electrodes which are used to measure the conductance through the layer. Two of the most successful implementations of this concept have been the bulk [[electrode]] approach and in the use of nanoelectrodes. In the bulk electrode approach, a molecular film is typically immobilized onto one electrode and an upper electrode is brought into contact with it allowing for a measure of current flow as a function of applied [[bias voltage]]. The nanoelectrode class of experiments, in creatively utilizing equipment such as [[atomic force microscope]] tips and small-radius wires, are able to perform the same sorts of current versus applied bias measurements but on a much smaller number of molecules as compared to bulk electrode. For instance, the tip of an atomic force microscope can be used as a top electrode and, given the nano-scale radius of curvature of the tip, the number of molecules measured is drastically cut. The difficulties encountered in these experiments have come mainly in dealing with such thin layers of molecules which often results in problems with short-circuiting the electrodes.

==Single-molecule-measurement ==
[[Image:Wiki figure.jpg|thumb|250px|right|A molecule covalently connected to two electrodes.]]
More recently, '''single-molecule-measurement''' experiments have been developed that are bringing experimenters a better look at molecular conductance. These fall under the categories of scanning probe, which involves fixed electrode, and mechanically formed junction techniques. One example of a mechanically formed junction experiment involves using a movable electrode to make contact with and then pull away from an electrode surface coated with a single layer of molecules. As the electrode is removed from the surface the molecules that had bonded between the two electrodes begin to detach until eventually one molecule is connected. The atomic-level geometry of the tip-electrode contact has an effect on the conductance and can change from one run of the experiment to the next so a histogram approach is required. Forming a junction in which the precise contact geometry is known has been one of the main difficulties with this approach.

== Applications ==
An important first step toward the goal of building electronic devices on the molecular level is the ability to measure and control the electric current through an individual molecule. Based on the anticipated continuation of [[Moore's Law]], which is expected to carry the miniaturization of transistors on integrated circuits into the atomic scale within the next 10 to 20 years, this goal of single-molecule-level circuit design is likely to become widespread throughout the semiconductor industry.&lt;br /&gt;

Other applications focus on the insight provided by these experiments in the area of charge transport, which is a recurrent phenomenon in many chemical and biological processes. This sort of insight gives researchers the ability to read the chemical information stored in a single molecule electronically, which can then be used in a wide variety of chemical and [[biosensor]] applications.

== History ==

Inspiration for Mycroft came when Ryan Sipes and Joshua Montgomery were visiting the [[Kansas City]] [[makerspace]], where they came across a simple and basic intelligent virtual assistant project. They were interested in the technology, but did not like its inflexibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.popsci.com/ultimate-diy-ai|title=Customize An Open-Source HAL For Your Home|last1=Harrington|first1=Rebecca|date=1 January 2016|website=[[Popular Science]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180627054807/https://www.popsci.com/ultimate-diy-ai|archive-date=27 June 2018|dead-url=No|accessdate=17 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.linux.com/news/mycroft-linuxs-own-ai|title=Mycroft: Linux’s Own AI|author=Bhartiya|first=Swapnil|date=17 January 2016|work=Linux.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Montgomery believes that the burgeoning industry of intelligent personal assistance poses privacy concerns for users and has promised that Mycroft will protect privacy through its open source machine learning platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Mycroft AI|title=Mycroft StartEngine Equity Offering|date=2018-05-24|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=5&amp;v=NfVD_-breck|access-date=2018-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mycroft has won several awards including the prestigious Techweek's KC Launch competition in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://techweek.com/mycroftai/|title=Alexa can you find me a better assistant? {{!}} Techweek|date=2017-09-11|work=Techweek|access-date=2018-07-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mycroft was part of the Sprint Accelerator 2016 class in Kansas City and joined [[500 Startups]] Batch 20 in February 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.techstars.com/content/blog/announcing-the-2016-class-of-the-sprint-accelerator-powered-by-techstars/|title=Announcing the 2016 Class of the Sprint Accelerator Powered by Techstars!|last=Fein|first=John|date=22 February 2016|work=[[Techstars]]|access-date=29 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170930084039/https://www.techstars.com/content/blog/announcing-the-2016-class-of-the-sprint-accelerator-powered-by-techstars/|archive-date=30 September 2017|dead-url=No}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/08/heres-the-20th-batch-of-500-startups-companies/|title=Here’s the 20th batch of 500 Startups companies|last=Lynley|first=Matthew|date=8 February 2017|work=[[TechCrunch]]|access-date=29 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170930035958/https://techcrunch.com/2017/02/08/heres-the-20th-batch-of-500-startups-companies/|archive-date=30 September 2017|dead-url=No}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company accepted a strategic investment from [[Jaguar Land Rover]] during this same time period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.startlandnews.com/2017/02/jaguar-land-rover-invests-artificial-intelligence-startup-mycroft/|title=Jaguar Land Rover invests in artificial intelligence startup Mycroft|last=Burch|first=Bobby|date=27 February 2017|work=Startland News|access-date=29 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180112050405/http://www.startlandnews.com/2017/02/jaguar-land-rover-invests-artificial-intelligence-startup-mycroft/|archive-date=12 January 2018|dead-url=No}}&lt;/ref&gt; To date, the company has raised more than $2.5 million from institutional investors and has opted to offer shares of the company to the public through [[StartEngine|Startengine]], an equity crowdfunding platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.startengine.com/mycroft-ai|title=Mycroft AI|website=StartEngine|access-date=2018-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is named after a fictional computer from 1966 science fiction novel ''[[The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress]]''.&lt;ref&gt;https://mycroft.ai/blog/why-name-it-mycroft/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mycroft voice stack ==

Mycroft provides [[open source software]] for most parts of the voice stack. 

=== Wake Word ===

Mycroft does Wake Word spotting, also called [[keyword spotting]], through its ''Precise'' Wake Word engine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://github.com/MycroftAI/mycroft-precise/|title=Precise Wake Word Engine|website=GitHub}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to Precise becoming the default Wake Word engine, Mycroft employed PocketSphinx. Instead of being based on [[phoneme]] recognition, Precise uses a trained [[recurrent neural network]] to distinguish between sounds which are, and which aren't, Wake Words. 

=== Speech to text === 

Mycroft is partnering with [[Mozilla]]'s Common Voice Project to leverage their DeepSpeech [[speech to text]] software. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.allaboutcircuits.com/news/developing-open-source-voice-assistant-interview-mycroft-AI-Steve-Penrod/|title=Developing an Open Source Voice Assistant: Interview with Mycroft AI’s Steve Penrod|website=All About Circuits|first=Katie|last=Smith|access-date=24 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Intent parsing ===

Mycroft uses an [[Natural language parser|intent parser]] called Adapt to convert natural language into [[machine-readable data]] structures. Adapt undertakes intent parsing by matching specific keywords in an order within an utterance. They also have a parser, ''Padatious''. Padatious, in contrast, uses example-based inference to determine intent. 

=== Text to speech ===

For [[speech synthesis]] Mycroft uses Mimic, which is based on the [[Festival Speech Synthesis System|Festival Lite]] speech synthesis system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.networkworld.com/article/3020009/software/raspberry-pi-based-home-ai-project-open-sources-key-components.html|title=Raspberry Pi-based home AI project open-sources key components|last1=Gold|first1=Jon|date=7 January 2016|website=Network World|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180519075851/https://www.networkworld.com/article/3020009/software/raspberry-pi-based-home-ai-project-open-sources-key-components.html|archive-date=19 May 2018|dead-url=No|accessdate=17 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Modular design and interoperability ===

Mycroft is designed to be modular, so users are able to change its components. For example, [[espeak]] can be used instead of Mimic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.softpedia.com/news/mycroft-releases-key-ai-component-as-open-source-498567.shtml|title=Mycroft Releases Key AI Component as Open Source|author=Stahie|first=Silviu|date=7 January 2016|work=[[Softpedia]] News|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612184448/https://news.softpedia.com/news/mycroft-releases-key-ai-component-as-open-source-498567.shtml|archive-date=12 June 2018|dead-url=No|accessdate=24 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/janakirammsv/2015/08/20/meet-mycroft-the-open-source-alternative-to-amazon-echo/#9fb756562a26|title=Meet Mycroft, The Open Source Alternative To Amazon Echo|last1=MSV|first1=Janakiram|date=20 August 2015|website=|publisher=[[Forbes]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180214073938/https://www.forbes.com/sites/janakirammsv/2015/08/20/meet-mycroft-the-open-source-alternative-to-amazon-echo/|archive-date=14 February 2018|dead-url=No|accessdate=17 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.softpedia.com/news/mycroft-is-an-ai-for-your-home-powered-by-raspberry-pi-2-and-ubuntu-snappy-489280.shtml|title=Mycroft Is an AI for Your Home Powered by Raspberry Pi 2 and Ubuntu Snappy|last1=Stahie|first1=Silviu|date=14 August 2015|website=[[Softpedia]] News|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170606000237/https://news.softpedia.com/news/mycroft-is-an-ai-for-your-home-powered-by-raspberry-pi-2-and-ubuntu-snappy-489280.shtml|archive-date=6 June 2017|dead-url=No|accessdate=17 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cnet.com/products/mycroft-smart-home-ai-platform/preview/|title=Meet Mycroft, an open-source smart-home AI platform|last=Crist|first=Ry|date=17 August 2015|website=[[CNET]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170621230847/https://www.cnet.com/products/mycroft-smart-home-ai-platform/preview/|archive-date=21 June 2017|dead-url=No|accessdate=17 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hardware ==

[[File:Mycroft_Mark_II_voice_assistant.png|thumb|right|400px|Protype of Mycroft Mark II voice assistant]]

The Mycroft project is also working on and selling smart speakers that run its software. All of its hardware is open-source, released under the [[CERN Open Hardware Licence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://github.com/MycroftAI/hardware-mycroft-mark-1|title=Github: Mycroft Mark I hardware|last=|first=|date=|website=[[GitHub]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its first hardware project was the '''Mark I''', targeted primarily at developers. Its production was partially funded through a [[Kickstarter]] campaign, which finished successfully. Units started shipping out in April 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mycroft.ai/blog/making-a-mycroft/|title=Making a Mycroft &amp; First Shipment|last=Adair|first=Kris|date=4 April 2016|website=Mycroft blog|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180627053956/https://mycroft.ai/blog/making-a-mycroft/|archive-date=27 June 2018|dead-url=No|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its most recent hardware project is the '''Mark II''', intended for general usage, not just for developers. Unlike the Mark I, the Mark II is equipped with a screen, being able to relay information both visually as well as acoustically. As with the Mark I, the Mark II's production will be partially funded through a Kickstarter campaign, which wrapped up in February 2018, hitting almost 8 times its original goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/aiforeveryone/mycroft-mark-ii-the-open-voice-assistant/updates|title=Mycroft Mark II: The Open Voice Assistant|last=Montgomery|first=Joshua|date=25 January 2018|website=[[Kickstarter]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180319004329/https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/aiforeveryone/mycroft-mark-ii-the-open-voice-assistant/updates|archive-date=19 March 2018|dead-url=No|accessdate=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mycroft announced that a third hardware project, '''Mark III''', will be offered through [[Kickstarter]], and that an entire product line of Mark I, II, and III will be released to stores by November, 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.startengine.com/mycroft-ai|title=Mycroft AI|website=StartEngine|access-date=2018-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Partnerships==

Mycroft has undertaken several commercial collaborations. In May 2018, the company partnered with WorkAround, an impact sourcing provider who broker work opportunities for refugees, to undertake bulk machine learning training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mycroft.ai/blog/refugees-tagging-wake-words-mycroft-workaround-partnership/|title=Using Precise to Help Refugees - Mycroft Partners with WorkAround|date=14 May 2018|dead-url=No|accessdate=24 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2018, Mycroft collaborated with [[disease surveillance]] and forecasting company, SickWeather, to identify the frequency of coughing on public transport, funded by the City of [[Kansas City, Missouri]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.startlandnews.com/2018/10/cough-detection/|title=Collaboration in the air: Cough detection sensors combine Sickweather, Mycroft tech|website=StartlandNews|access-date=24 October 2018|last=Bezner|first=Elyssa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nanopunk''' refers to an emerging subgenre of [[science fiction]] still very much in its infancy in comparison to its ancestor-genre [[cyberpunk]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= |first= |date=2014 |title=The Multiple Worlds of Fringe: Essays on the J.J.

The genre is especially similar to [[biopunk]],&lt;ref name="nsf" /&gt; but describes a world where [[Nanorobotics|nanites]] are widely in use and [[Nanotechnology|nanotechnologies]] the predominant technological forces in society.

Currently the genre is mainly concerned with the artistic, psychological&lt;ref name="goonan" /&gt; and especially [[societal impact of nanotechnology|societal]] impact of nanotechnology, rather than aspects of the technology which itself is still in its infancy. Unlike the cyberpunk which can be distinguished by a gritty and low-life yet technologically advanced character, nanopunk can have a darker [[dystopian]] character that might examine potential [[Global catastrophic risk#Nanotechnology|risks by nanotechnology]] as well a more optimistic outlook that might emphasize [[Applications of nanotechnology|potential uses of nanotechnology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Huereca |first=Rafael Miranda |last2= |first2= |date= |title=The evolution of cyberpunk into postcyberpunk - The role of cognitive cyberspaces, wetware networks and nanotechnology in science fiction |url=http://www.tdx.cat/bitstream/handle/10803/288302/rmh1de1.pdf |journal= |publisher= |volume= |issue= |pages= |doi= |access-date=19 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--(pros and cons of nanotech)--&gt;&lt;ref name="nsf"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bestsciencefictionbooks.com/nanopunk-science-fiction.php |title=Nanopunk Science Fiction  |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website= |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Comics ==
*[[Scooby Apocalypse]] (2016-), Reveals early on that artificially made Nanite virus created from [[Velma Dinkley|Velma's]] 'Elysium Project' experiment is reason why people infected into monsters.

== Literature ==
*[[Kathleen Ann Goonan]] (''Queen City Jazz'' – 1997) and [[Linda Nagata]] were some of the earliest writers to feature nanotech as the primary element in their work.&lt;ref name="goonan" /&gt;&lt;!-- This has led to some SF critics dubbing a new subgenre called nanopunk. --&gt;
*Another example of this genre is [[Neal Stephenson]]'s ''[[The Diamond Age]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Sohn |first=Stephen Hong |last2= |first2= |date=2008 |title=Alien/Asian: Imagining the Racialized Future |url=http://extscifi.weebly.com/uploads/8/9/4/7/8947540/article46.pdf |journal= |publisher=The Society for the Study of the Multi-Ethnic Literature of the United States (MELUS) |volume=33 |issue=4 |pages= |doi= |access-date=19 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some novels of [[Stanislaw Lem]], including ''Weapon System of the Twenty First Century or The Upside-down Evolution'', ''[[The Invincible]]'' and ''[[Peace on Earth (novel)|Peace on Earth]]'' as well as [[Greg Bear]]'s ''[[Blood Music (novel)|Blood Music]]''&lt;!--http://esst.eu/wp-content/uploads/Stefan+Vargolici+MA+Thesis+ESST+3+October+2011.pdf--&gt; could also be considered precursors of nanopunk.
*Another example is the [[Michael Crichton]] novel ''[[Micro (novel)|Micro]]'' (2011). More recently, Nathan McGrath's ''Nanopunk'' (2013) is set in an icebound near-future where almost half the world's population has been wiped out. Alister, a child when "The Big Freeze" began is now a teenager in a society slowly finding its feet. Unaware of his nano-infection he sets out to find his lost sister and is joined by Suzie, a militant [[Cyberactivism|cyber-activist]]. Their [[hacker (computer security)|hacking]] attracts the attention of Secret Services and a ruthless [[Private military company|private military corporation]] and their search becomes a deadly race for survival.
*Linda Nagata's ''Tech Heaven'' (1995) is a futuristic thriller about Katie, a woman whose husband is about to die of injuries sustained in a helicopter crash. Instead of dying, he gets his body [[Cryogenics|cryogenically]] preserved so that he can be reawakened when [[medical technology|med-tech]] is advanced enough to heal him. The problem is that it winds up taking far more than the estimated few years for this to happen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.wired.com/table_of_malcontents/2006/12/underrated_sf_c/ |title=Underrated SF Classic: Linda Nagata’s "Tech Heaven" (review) |date=December 22, 2006 |first=Annalee |last=Newitz |work=[[Wired News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Alastair Reynolds]]' ''[[Chasm City]]'' could also be considered nanopunk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Heikkilä |first=Ville |last2= |first2= |date=November 2013 |title=Restoration of identity from space in Alastair Reynolds’s ''Chasm City'' |url=https://tampub.uta.fi/bitstream/handle/10024/94688/GRADU-1386072830.pdf |journal= |publisher= |volume= |issue= |pages= |doi= |access-date=19 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="28687">In [[business]] and [[engineering]], '''new product development''' ('''NPD''') covers the complete process of bringing a new [[product (business)|product]] to market. A central aspect of NPD is [[product design]], along with various business considerations. New product development is described broadly as the transformation of a [[market opportunity]] into a product available for sale.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/277068142|title=A dictionary of business and management.|date=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780199234899|edition=5th|location=Oxford [England]|oclc=277068142}}&lt;/ref&gt; The product can be tangible (something physical which one can touch) or intangible (like a [[service (disambiguation)|service]], [[user experience|experience]], or [[belief (disambiguation)|belief]]), though sometimes services and other processes are distinguished from "products." NPD requires an understanding of customer needs and wants, the competitive environment, and the nature of the market.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
Cost, time and quality are the main variables that drive customer needs. Aiming at these three variables, [[company|companies]] develop continuous practices and strategies to better satisfy [[customer requirement]]s and to increase their own [[market share]] by a regular development of new products.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} There are many uncertainties and challenges which companies must face throughout the process. The use of [[best practice]]s and the elimination of barriers to communication are the main concerns for the [[management]] of the NPD .{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

== Process structure ==
The product development process typically consists of several activities that firms employ in the complex process of delivering new products to the market. A [[process management]] approach is used to provide a structure. Product development often overlaps much with the [[engineering design]] process, particularly if the new product being developed involves application of math and/or science. Every new product will pass through a series of stages/phases, including [[Ideation (idea generation)|ideation]] among other aspects of [[design]], as well as [[manufacturing]] and market introduction.  In highly complex engineered products (e.g. aircraft, automotive, machinery), the NPD process can be likewise complex regarding management of personnel, milestones and deliverables.  Such projects typically use an [[integrated product team]] approach.  The process for managing large-scale complex engineering products is much slower (often 10-plus years) than that deployed for many types of consumer goods.

The product development process is articulated and broken down in many different ways, many of which often include the following phases/stages:
#  '''Fuzzy front-end''' (FFE) is the set of activities employed before the more formal and well defined [[requirements engineering|requirements specification]] is completed.  [[Requirements]] speak to what the product should do or have, at varying degrees of specificity, in order to meet the perceived market or business need.
#  '''Product design''' is the development of both the [[High-level design|high-level]] and [[Detailed design document|detailed-level]] design of the product:  which turns the ''what'' of the requirements into a specific ''how'' this particular product will meet those requirements. This typically has the most overlap with the [[engineering design]] process, but can also include [[industrial design]] and even purely aesthetic aspects of design. On the marketing and planning side, this phase ends at pre-commercialization analysis{{clarify|date=April 2015}} stage.
#  '''Product implementation''' often refers to later stages of detailed engineering design (e.g. refining mechanical or electrical hardware, or software, or [[consumer good|goods]] or other product forms), as well as [[verification and validation|test process]] that may be used to validate that the prototype actually meets all design specifications that were established.
#  '''Fuzzy back-end''' or commercialization phase represent the action steps where the [[manufacturing|production]] and market launch occur.

The front-end marketing phases have been very well researched, with valuable models proposed. Peter Koen et al. provides a five-step front-end activity called front-end innovation: opportunity identification, opportunity analysis, idea genesis, idea selection, and idea and technology development. He also includes an engine in the middle of the five front-end stages and the possible outside barriers that can influence the process outcome. The engine represents the management driving the activities described. The front end of the innovation is the greatest area of weakness in the NPD process. This is mainly because the FFE is often chaotic, unpredictable and unstructured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Koen|first1=Peter A.|title=The fuzzy front-end for incremental, breakthrough and platform products and services|accessdate=February 5, 2017|issue=1|publisher=Consortium for corporate entrepreneurship|url=http://s3.amazonaws.com/academia.edu.documents/32151604/FuzzyFrontEnd_Old.pdf?AWSAccessKeyId=AKIAIWOWYYGZ2Y53UL3A&amp;Expires=1486329441&amp;Signature=8XPQsXKa5HC7W0UjVcloWV6Qp0Q%3D&amp;response-content-disposition=inline%3B%20filename%3D1_Fuzzy_Front_End_Effective_Methods_Tool.pdf}} {{dead link|date=July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Engineering design is the process whereby a technical solution is developed iteratively to solve a given problem&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=P. Robert|last2=Eppinger|first2=P. Steven|title=Identifying controlling features of engineering design iteration|journal=Management Science|date=1997|volume=43|issue=3|pages=276–293|doi=10.1287/mnsc.43.3.276}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="complex"&gt;Yassine, Ali; Braha, Dan (2003),[http://necsi.edu/affiliates/braha/CERA.pdf "Complex Concurrent Engineering and the Design Structure Matrix Approach."] Concurrent Engineering: Research and Applications, '''11''' (3):165–177&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Yassine, Ali; Joglekar, Nitin; Braha, Dan; Eppinger, Steven; Whitney, Daniel (2003),"Information hiding in product development: the design churn effect." Research in Engineering Design, '''14''' (3): 131–144.&lt;/ref&gt;
The design stage is very important because at this stage most of the product life cycle costs are engaged. Previous research shows that 70–80% of the final product quality and 70% of the product entire life-cycle cost are determined in the product design phase, therefore the design-manufacturing interface represent the greatest opportunity for cost reduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yan-mei|first1=Zhou|title=Cost-benefit of interface management improvement in design-manufacturing chain|journal=Chinese academy of science and technology management|date=2009|volume=14|issue=3|pages=380–384}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Design projects last from a few weeks to three years with an average of one year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hargadon|first1=Andrew|title=Technology brokering and innovation in a product development firm|journal=Administrative Science Quarterly|date=1997|volume=42|issue=4|pages=716–749|doi=10.2307/2393655}}&lt;/ref&gt; Design and Commercialization phases usually start a very early collaboration. When the concept design is finished it will be sent to manufacturing plant for prototyping, developing a Concurrent Engineering approach by implementing practices such as [[Quality function deployment|QFD]], [[Design for manufacturability|DFM]]/[[Design for assembly|DFA]] and more.
The output of the design (engineering) is a set of product and process specifications – mostly in the form of drawings, and the output of manufacturing is the product ready for sale.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Adler|first1=S. Paul|title=Interdepartmental interdependence and coordination: the case of the design/manufacturing interface|journal=Organisation Science|date=1995|volume=6|issue=2|pages=147–167|doi=10.1287/orsc.6.2.147}}&lt;/ref&gt; Basically, the design team will develop drawings with technical specifications representing the future product, and will send it to the manufacturing plant to be executed. Solving product/process fit problems is of high priority in information communication design because 90% of the development effort must be scrapped if any changes are made after the release to manufacturing.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

== NPD Process ==

#'''New Product Strategy''' – Innovators have clearly defined their goals and objectives for the new product.
#'''Idea Generation''' – Collective brainstorming through internal and external sources.
#'''Screening''' – Condense the number of brainstormed ideas.
#'''Concept Testing''' – Structure an idea into a detailed concept.
#'''Business Analysis''' – Understand the cost and profits of the new product and determining if they meet company objectives.
#'''Product Development''' – Developing the product.
#'''Market Testing''' – Marketing mix is tested through a trial run of the product.
#'''Commercialization''' – Introducing the product to the public.

==Models==
Conceptual models have been designed in order to facilitate a smooth process. The concept adopted by IDEO, a successful design and consulting firm, is one of the most researched processes in regard to new product development and is a five-step procedure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Moen|first1=Ron|title=A review of the IDEO process|website=http://www.rwjf.org/content/dam/web-assets/2001/10/a-review-of-the-ideo-process|accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; These steps are listed in chronological order:
# Understand and observe the market, the client, the technology, and the limitations of the problem;
# Synthesize the information collected at the first step;
# Visualise new customers using the product;
# Prototype, evaluate and improve the concept;
# Implementation of design changes which are associated with more technologically advanced procedures and therefore this step will require more time.
One of the first developed models that today companies still use in the NPD process is the Booz, Allen and Hamilton (BAH) Model, published in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Allen &amp; Hamilton|first1=Booz|title=New products management for the 1980s|accessdate=22 October 2014|publisher=Booz, Allen &amp; Hamilton – original from Indiana University}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is the best known model because it underlies the NPD systems that have been put forward later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bruiyan|first1=Nadia|title=A framework for successful new product development|journal=Journal of Industrial Engineering and Management|date=2011|volume=4|issue=4|pages=746–770}}&lt;/ref&gt; This model represents the foundation of all the other models that have been developed afterwards. Significant work has been conducted in order to propose better models, but in fact these models can be easily linked to BAH model. The seven steps of BAH model are: new [[product strategy]], idea generation, screening and evaluation, business analysis, development, testing, and commercialization. &lt;br /&gt;
A pioneer of NPD research in the consumers goods sector is Robert G. Cooper. Over the last two decades he conducted significant work in the area of NPD. The Stage-Gate model developed in the 1980s was proposed as a new tool for managing new products development processes.  This was mainly applied to the consumers goods industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cooper|first1=Robert|title=Stage-gare systems: A new tool for managing new products|journal=Business Horizons|date=1990|volume=33|issue=3|pages=44–55|doi=10.1016/0007-6813(90)90040-i}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2010 APQC benchmarking study reveals that 88% of U.S. businesses employ a stage-gate system to manage new products, from idea to launch. In return, the companies that adopt this system are reported to receive benefits such as improved teamwork, improved success rates, earlier detection of failure, a better launch, and even shorter cycle times – reduced by about 30%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kenneth|first1=Kahn|title=The PDMA handbook of new product development|date=2013|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc.|location=Hoboken, New Jersey|isbn=978-0-470-64820-9|page=34|edition=Third}}&lt;/ref&gt; These findings highlight the importance of the stage-gate model in the area of new product development. &lt;br /&gt;
Over the last few years, the [[Lean Startup]] movement has grown in popularity, challenging many of the assumptions inherent in the stage-gate model.

==Marketing considerations==
There have been a number of approaches proposed for analyzing and responding to the marketing challenges of new product development.  Two of these are ''the eight stages'' process of Peter Koen of the [[Stevens Institute of Technology]], and a process known as ''the fuzzy front end.''

=== Fuzzy Front End ===

''The Fuzzy Front End'' (FFE) is the messy "getting started" period of new product engineering development processes. It is also referred to as the "Front End of Innovation",&lt;ref name="Koen 2001 pp.46-55" /&gt; or "Idea Management".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vandenbosch et al.|first=|date=2006|title=Idea Management: A Systemic View|url=|journal=Journal of Management Studies|volume=43|pages=259-288|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://hhk3.kau.se/im/|title=Idea Management|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is in the front end where the organization formulates a concept of the product to be developed and decides whether or not to invest resources in the further development of an idea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sukhov|first=Alexandre|date=2018|title=The role of perceived comprehension in idea evaluation|url=https://doi.org/10.1111/caim.12262|journal=Creativity and Innovation Management|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the phase between first consideration of an opportunity and when it is judged ready to enter the structured development process (Kim and Wilemon, 2007;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kim | first1 = J. | last2 = Wilemon | first2 = D. | year = 2007 | title = Sources and assessment of complexity in NPD projects | url = | journal = R&amp;D Management | volume = 33 | issue = 1| pages = 16–30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Koen et al., 2001).&lt;ref name="Koen 2001 pp.46-55"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Koen|first=|display-authors=etal|date=|year=2001|title=Providing clarity and a common language to the 'fuzzy front end'|url=|journal=Research Technology Management|volume=44|issue=2|pages=46–55|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It includes all activities from the search for new opportunities through the formation of a germ of an idea to the development of a precise concept. The Fuzzy Front End phase ends when an organization approves and begins formal development of the concept.

Although the Fuzzy Front End may not be an expensive part of product development, it can consume 50% of development time (see Chapter 3 of the Smith and Reinertsen reference below),&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Preston G. and Reinertsen, Donald G. (1998) ''Developing Products in Half the Time'', 2nd Edition, John Wiley and Sons, New York, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; and it is where major commitments are typically made involving time, money, and the product's nature, thus setting the course for the entire project and final end product. Consequently, this phase should be considered as an essential part of development rather than something that happens "before development," and its cycle time should be included in the total development cycle time.

Koen et al. (2001), distinguish five different front-end elements (not necessarily in a particular order):&lt;ref name="Koen 2001 pp.46-55"/&gt;
# Opportunity Identification
# Opportunity Analysis
# Idea Genesis
# Idea Selection
# Idea and Technology Development
* The first element is the opportunity identification. In this element, large or incremental business and technological chances are identified in a more or less structured way. Using the guidelines established here, resources will eventually be allocated to new projects.... which then lead to a structured NPPD (New Product &amp; Process Development) strategy.
* The second element is the opportunity analysis. It is done to translate the identified opportunities into implications for the business and technology specific context of the company. Here extensive efforts may be made to align ideas to target customer groups and do market studies and/or technical trials and research.
* The third element is the idea genesis, which is described as evolutionary and iterative process progressing from birth to maturation of the opportunity into a tangible idea. The process of the idea genesis can be made internally or come from outside inputs, e.g. a supplier offering a new material/technology or from a customer with an unusual request.
* The fourth element is the idea selection. Its purpose is to choose whether to pursue an idea by analyzing its potential business value.
* The fifth element is the idea and technology development. During this part of the front-end, the business case is developed based on estimates of the total available market, customer needs, investment requirements, competition analysis and project uncertainty. Some organizations consider this to be the first stage of the NPPD process (i.e., Stage 0).

A universally acceptable definition for Fuzzy Front End or a dominant framework has not been developed so far.&lt;ref&gt;Husig and Kohn (2003), Factors influencing the Front End of the Innovation Process: A comprehensive Review of Selected empirical NPD and explorative FFE Studies, Brusell, Juni 2003, p.14.&lt;/ref&gt;
In a glossary of PDMA,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The PDMA Glossary for New Product Development|publisher=Product Development &amp; Management Association|year=2006|url=http://www.pdma.org/npd_glossary.cfm|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090321075449/http://www.pdma.org/npd_glossary.cfm|archivedate=2009-03-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is mentioned that the Fuzzy Front End generally consists of three tasks: strategic planning, idea generation, and pre-technical evaluation. These activities are often chaotic, unpredictable, and unstructured. In comparison, the subsequent new product development process is typically structured, predictable, and formal.
The term ''Fuzzy Front End '' was first popularized by Smith and Reinertsen (1991).&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Preston G., Reinertsen Donald G. (1991) Developing products in half the time, Van Nostrand Reinhold, New York&lt;/ref&gt;
R.G. Cooper (1988)&lt;ref&gt;Cooper, R.G. Predevelopment activities determine new product success, in: Industrial Marketing Management, Vol.17 (1988), No 2, pp. 237–248&lt;/ref&gt;  it describes the early stages of NPPD as a four-step process in which ideas are generated (I), subjected to a preliminary technical and market assessment (II) and merged to coherent product concepts (III) which are finally judged for their fit with existing product strategies and portfolios (IV). 

=== Other conceptualisations ===
Other authors have divided predevelopment product development activities differently. 

====The Phase Zero of the Stage-Gate Model of New Product Development====
The Stage-Gate model of NPD predevelopment activities are summarised in Phase zero and one,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cooper|first=R.G.|date=|title=What’s Next?: After Stage-Gate|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.5437/08956308X5606963|journal=Research-Technology Management|volume=57|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in respect to earlier definition of  predevelopment activities:&lt;ref&gt;Cooper R.G., Edgett, S.J. (2008), Maximizing productivity in product innovation, in: Research Technology Management, March 1, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

# Preliminary
# Technical assessment
# [[Supply chain|Source-of-supply]] assessment: suppliers and partners or alliances
# [[Market research]]: market size and segmentation analysis, VoC ([[voice of the customer]]) research
# Product idea testing
# [[Customer value proposition|Customer value]] assessment
# Product definition
# Business and financial analysis

These activities yield essential information to make a Go/No-Go to Development decision. These decisions represent the Gates in the Stage-Gate model.

==== Early Phase of the Innovation Process ====
A conceptual model of Front-End Process was proposed which includes early phases of the innovation process. This model is structured in three phases and three gates:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|last1=Husig|first1=S|last2=Kohn|first2=S|last3=Poskela|first3=J|year=2005|title=The Role of Process Formalisation in the early Phases of the Innovation Process|conference=12th Int. Prod. Development Conf|place=Copenhagen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Phase 1: Environmental screening or opportunity identification stage in which external changes will be analysed and translated into potential business opportunities.
* Phase 2: Preliminary definition of an idea or concept.
* Phase 3: Detailed product, project or service definition, and Business planning.

The gates are:

* Opportunity screening
* Idea evaluation
* Go/No-Go for development

The final gate leads to a dedicated new product development project. Many professionals and academics consider that the general features of Fuzzy Front End (fuzziness, ambiguity, and uncertainty) make it difficult to see the FFE as a structured process, but rather as a set of interdependent activities ( e.g. Kim and Wilemon, 2002).&lt;ref&gt;Kim, J., Wilemon, D. (2002): Accelerating the Front End Phase in New Product Development  [http://www.iamot.org]&lt;/ref&gt; However, Husig et al., 2005 [10] argue that front-end not need to be fuzzy, but can be handled in a structured manner.  In fact Carbone &lt;ref&gt;Thomas A. Carbone, Critical Success Factors in the Front-End of High Technology Industry New Product Development, Doctoral Dissertation, University of Alabama in Huntsville, November, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas A. Carbone, et al.,''Front-end success factors and the impact on high technology industry new product development.'' 2012 IEEE International Technology Management Conference, Dallas, Tx, USA.&lt;/ref&gt; showed that when using the front end success factors in an integrated process, product success is increased. Peter Koen&lt;ref name="koen2004"&gt;{{citation|last=Koen|first=Peter A.|title=The Fuzzy Front End for Incremental, Platform, and Breakthrough Products|year=2004|journal=PDMA Handbook of New Product Development, 2nd Ed.|pages=81–91}}&lt;/ref&gt; argues that in the FFE for incremental, platform and radical projects, three separate strategies and processes are typically involved.&lt;ref name="koen2004" /&gt; The traditional Stage Gate (TM) process was designed for incremental product development, namely for a single product. The FFE for developing a new platform must start out with a strategic vision of where the company wants to develop products and this will lead to a family of products. Projects for breakthrough products start out with a similar strategic vision, but are associated with technologies which require new discoveries.

==== Activity view on Fuzzy-Front End ====
Predevelopment is the initial stage in NPD and consists of numerous activities, such as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Khurana|first1=A|last2=Rosenthal|first2=S.R.|title=Towards Holistic 'Front Ends' in New Product Development|doi=10.1016/S0737-6782(97)00066-0|journal=Journal of Product Innovation Management|volume=15|year=1998|issue=1|pages=57–75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* product strategy formulation and communication
* opportunity identification and assessment
* idea generation
* product definition
* project planning
* executive reviews

Economical analysis, benchmarking of competitive products and modeling and prototyping are also important activities during the front-end activities.

The outcomes of FFE are the:{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

* mission statement
* customer needs
* details of the selected idea
* product definition and specifications
* economic analysis of the product
* the development schedule
* project staffing and the budget
* a business plan aligned with corporate strategy

Incremental, platform and breakthrough products include:&lt;ref name="koen2004"/&gt;
* ''Incremental products'' are considered to be cost reductions, improvements to existing product lines, additions to existing platforms and repositioning of existing products introduced in markets.
* ''Breakthrough products'' are new to the company or new to the world and offer a 5–10 times or greater improvement in performance combined with a 30–50% or greater reduction in costs.
* ''Platform products'' establish a basic architecture for a next generation product or process and are substantially larger in scope and resources than incremental projects.

==Strategies==
* [[Lean product development]]
* [[Design for six sigma]]
* [[Quality function deployment]]
* [[Phase–gate model]]
* [[User-centered design]]

==Management==

&lt;ref&gt;Gary Armstrong, P. K. (2013). Marketing an introduction (11th ed.). Harlow, England: Pearson.&lt;/ref&gt; Companies must take a holistic approach to managing this process and must continue to innovate and develop new products if they want to grow and prosper.
* CUSTOMER CENTERED New Product Development. Focuses on:
** Finding new ways to solve customer problems.
** Create more customer-satisfying experience
*: Companies often rely on technology, but the real success comes from understanding customer needs and values.
*: The most successful companies were the ones that:
** Differentiated from others
** Solved major customer problems
** Offered a compelling customer value proposition
** Engaged customer directly
* TEAM BASED New Product Development
** An approach:
** To deserving new products in which various company's departments work closely together overlapping the steps in the product development process in order to:
*** Save time
*** Increase effectiveness
** Company departments work closely together in cross functional teams overlapping the steps in the product development process (to save time and increase effectiveness).
** Those departments are: legal, marketing, finances, design and manufacturing, suppliers and customer companies.
** If there is a problem, all the company can work.
* SYSTEMATIC New Product Development
** Development process should be holistic (alternative) and systematic not to good ideas die.
** This process is installed on Innovation Management System that collect, review, evaluate new product ideas and manage
*** the company appoints to a senior person to be the Innovation Manager who encourage all the company
*** employees, suppliers, distributors and dealers to become involved in finding and developing new products.
** Then, there is a Cross-Functional Innovation Management Committee which:
*** Evaluate new products ideas
*** Help bringing good ideas
** To sum up, New-Product success requires:
** New ways to create valued customer experience, from generating and screening new product ideas to create and roll out want-satisfying products.
* New Product Development IN TURBULENT TIMES
** When we are in a tough economic situation usually management reduces spending on: new-product development. Usually it is done from a short-sighted point of view.
** Tough times might even call for:
*** Greater new-product development, offering solutions for changing customer needs and tastes.
*** Innovation helps
*** Making the company more competitive
*** Positioning it better for future.
* [[Virtual product development]]
** Uses collaboration technology to remove need for co-located teams
** Reduces G&amp;A overhead costs of consulting firms
** Advent of 24-hour development cycle

'''Novartis International AG''' is a Swiss [[multinational corporation|multinational]] [[pharmaceutical company]] based in [[Basel]], [[Switzerland]]. It is one of the largest pharmaceutical companies by both market capitalization and sales.

Novartis manufactures the drugs [[clozapine]] (Clozaril), [[diclofenac]] (Voltaren), [[carbamazepine]] (Tegretol), [[valsartan]] (Diovan),
[[imatinib mesylate]] (Gleevec/Glivec), [[ciclosporin]] (Neoral/Sandimmun), [[letrozole]] (Femara), [[methylphenidate]] (Ritalin), [[terbinafine]] (Lamisil), and others.

In 1996, [[Ciba-Geigy]] merged with Sandoz; the pharmaceutical and agrochemical divisions of both companies formed Novartis as an independent entity. Other Ciba-Geigy and Sandoz businesses were sold, or, like [[Ciba Specialty Chemicals]], spun off as independent companies. The Sandoz brand disappeared for three years, but was revived in 2003 when Novartis consolidated its [[generic drug]]s businesses into a single subsidiary and named it Sandoz. Novartis divested its agrochemical and [[genetically modified crops]] business in 2000 with the spinout of [[Syngenta]] in partnership with [[AstraZeneca]], which also divested its agrochemical business.

==History==
Novartis was created in 1996 from the merger of Ciba-Geigy and Sandoz Laboratories, both Swiss companies with long histories. Ciba-Geigy was formed in 1970 by the merger of J. R. Geigy Ltd (founded in Basel in 1758) and CIBA (founded in Basel in 1859). Combining the histories of the merger partners, the company's effective history spans 250 years.&lt;ref name="novhist"&gt;{{Citation |title=Company history |work=corporate website |at=novartis.com |publisher=Novartis |url=http://www.novartis.com/about-novartis/company-history/index.shtml |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101230203847/http://www.novartis.com/about-novartis/company-history/index.shtml |archivedate=30 December 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ciba-Geigy===
====Ciba====
In 1859, Alexander Clavel (1805–1873) took up the production of [[fuchsine]] in his factory for [[silk]]-dyeing works in Basel. In 1864, a new site for the production of synthetic dyes was constructed, and in 1873, Clavel sold his dye factory to the new company Bindschedler and Busch. In 1884, Bindschedler and Busch was transformed into a joint-stock company with the name "Gesellschaft für Chemische Industrie Basel" (Company for Chemical Industry Basel). The [[acronym]], CIBA, was adopted as the company's name in 1945.

====Geigy====
Johann Rudolf Geigy-Gemuseus (1733–1793) began trading in 1758 in "materials, chemicals, dyes and drugs of all kinds"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ciba.com/index/cmp-index/cmp-about/cmp-abo-history.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100103182548/http://ciba.com/index/cmp-index/cmp-about/cmp-abo-history.htm |archivedate=2010-01-03 |title=Archive of Ciba, now a part of BASF: History |publisher=Ciba.com |date= |accessdate=2013-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MinRec"&gt;Staff, The Mineralogical Record Biographical Archive.

Geigy (1830-1917)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022025913/http://www.minrec.org/labels.asp?colid=765 |date=22 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Basel]], [[Switzerland]]. Johann Rudolf Geigy-Merian (1830–1917) and Johann Muller-Pack acquired a site in Basel in 1857, where they built a [[dyewood]] mill and a [[dye]] extraction plant. Two years later, they began the production of synthetic [[fuchsine]]. In 1901, they formed the [[public limited company]] Geigy and the name of the company was changed to J. R. Geigy Ltd in 1914. In 1925, J. R. Geigy Ltd. began producing textile auxiliaries,&lt;ref&gt;"Textile auxiliaries" are in the class of [[specialty chemicals]] and "enable a processing operation in preparation, dyeing, printing, or finishing to be carried out more effectively or which is essential if a given effect is to be obtained. Certain Textile Auxiliaries are also required in order to produce special finishing effects such as wash &amp; wear, water repellence, flame retardancy, aroma finish, anti odour, colour deepening etc." (from [http://www.niir.org/books/book/isbn-HandbookonTextileAuxiliaries,DyesandDyeIntermediatesTechnology/zb,,16c,a,0,0,a/index.html Handbook on Textile Auxiliaries, Dyes and Dye Intermediates Technology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022065700/http://www.niir.org/books/book/isbn-HandbookonTextileAuxiliaries%2CDyesandDyeIntermediatesTechnology/zb%2C%2C16c%2Ca%2C0%2C0%2Ca/index.html |date=22 October 2013 }}, by the NPCS Board of Consultants &amp; Engineers. Asia Pacific Business Press Inc., 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; an activity which Ciba took up in 1928. In 1939, Geigy chemist [[Paul Hermann Müller]] discovered that [[DDT]] was effective against malaria-bearing insects. He received the 1948 [[Nobel Prize in Medicine]] for this work.

====Ciba‑Geigy Ltd====
CIBA and Geigy merged in 1971 to form Ciba‑Geigy Ltd. {{IPAc-en|ˌ|s|iː|b|ə|_|ˈ|g|aɪ|g|i|}}. In the United States, the Geigy staff relocated to join the CIBA staff at its American headquarters for research in [[Ardsley, New York|Ardsley]], New York. In 1980, Ciba-Geigy set up the company, Ciba Vision, to enter the contact lens market.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cibavision.com/about-us/overview.shtml Ciba Vision "About us" page] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130912023933/http://www.cibavision.com/about-us/overview.shtml |date=12 September 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992 Ciba-Geigy agreed to pay New Jersey $62&amp;nbsp;million for illegal waste dumping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=JOSEPH F.

===Sandoz===
{{Redirect|Sandoz}}
Before the 1996 merger with Ciba-Geigy to form Novartis, Sandoz Pharmaceuticals (Sandoz AG) was a [[pharmaceutical]] company headquartered in [[Basel]], [[Switzerland]] (as was Ciba-Geigy), and was best known for developing drugs such as [[Sandimmune]] for [[organ transplantation]], the [[antipsychotic]] [[Clozaril]], [[Mellaril]] Tablets and [[Serentil]] Tablets for treating [[psychiatric disorders]], and [[Cafergot]] Tablets and [[Torecan]] Suppositories for treating [[migraine headaches]].

The ''Chemiefirma Kern und Sandoz'' ("Kern and Sandoz Chemistry Firm") was founded in 1886 by [[Alfred Kern]] (1850–1893) and Edouard Sandoz (1853–1928). The first dyes manufactured by them were [[alizarin]]blue and [[auramine]]. After Kern's death, the partnership became the corporation ''Chemische Fabrik vormals Sandoz'' in 1895. The company began producing the fever-reducing drug [[antipyrin]] in the same year. In 1899, the company began producing the sugar substitute [[saccharin]]. Further pharmaceutical research began in 1917 under [[Arthur Stoll]] (1887–1971), who is the founder of Sandoz's pharmaceutical department in 1917.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Monday - Friday,8:30 - 17:00, GMT+1(Central European Time) |url=http://www.novartis.com/about-novartis/company-history/index.shtml |title=Company history |publisher=Novartis.com |date=2010-12-15 |accessdate=2012-01-16 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101230203847/http://www.novartis.com/about-novartis/company-history/index.shtml |archivedate=30 December 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1918, Arthur Stoll isolated [[ergotamine]] from [[ergot]]; the substance was eventually used to treat migraine and headaches and was introduced under the trade name Gynergen in 1921.

Between the World Wars, Gynergen (1921) and Calcium-Sandoz (1929) were brought to market. Sandoz also produced chemicals for textiles, paper, and [[leather]], beginning in 1929. In 1939, the company began producing agricultural chemicals.

The [[psychedelic drug|psychedelic]] effects of [[lysergic acid diethylamide]] (LSD) were discovered at the Sandoz laboratories in 1943 by [[Arthur Stoll]] and [[Albert Hofmann]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nysun.com/obituaries/albert-hofmann-102-invented-lsd/75591/ |title=Albert Hofmann, 102, Invented LSD - The New York Sun |publisher=Nysun.com |date= |accessdate=2013-10-23| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131020203430/http://www.nysun.com/obituaries/albert-hofmann-102-invented-lsd/75591/ | archivedate = 2013-10-20| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/patents/US2438259|title=Patent US2438259 - D-lysergic acid diethyl amide|work=google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sandoz began clinical trials and marketed the substance, from 1947 through the mid-1960s, under the name ''Delysid'' as a [[Psychiatry|psychiatric]] drug, thought useful for treating a wide variety of [[Mental disorder|mental ailments]], ranging from [[alcoholism]] to [[sexual deviancy]]. Sandoz suggested in its marketing literature that psychiatrists take LSD themselves,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flashback.se/archive/my_problem_child/chapter4.html#2 |title=Albert Hofmann: LSD - My Problem Child: Use of LSD in Psychiatry |publisher=Flashback.se |date= |accessdate=2012-01-16| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060707201805/http://www.flashback.se/archive/my_problem_child/chapter4.html | archivedate = 2006-07-07| deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; to gain a better subjective understanding of the [[Schizophrenia|schizophrenic]] experience, and many did exactly that and so did other scientific researchers. The Sandoz product received mass publicity as early as 1954, in a [[Time Magazine]] feature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,860898,00.html | work=Time | title=Medicine: Dream Stuff | date=28 June 1954 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130827000524/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C860898%2C00.html | archivedate=27 August 2013 | deadurl=no | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research on LSD peaked in the 1950s and early 1960s. Sandoz withdrew the drug from the market in the mid-1960s. The drug became a cultural novelty of the 1960s after psychologist [[Timothy Leary]] at [[Harvard University]] began to promote its use for recreational and spiritual experiences among the general public.

Sandoz opened its first foreign offices in 1964. In 1967, Sandoz merged with [[Wander AG]] (known for [[Ovomaltine]] and [[Isostar]]). Sandoz acquired the companies [[Delmark]], [[Wasabröd]] (a [[Sweden|Swedish]] manufacturer of [[crisp bread]]), and [[Gerber Products Company]] (a [[baby food]] company). On 1 November 1986, a fire broke out in a production plant storage room, which led to the [[Sandoz chemical spill]] and a large amount of [[pesticide]] being released into the upper [[Rhine]] river. This exposure killed many fish and other aquatic life. In 1995, Sandoz spun off its [[specialty chemicals]] business to form [[Clariant]]. In 1997, Clariant merged with the specialty chemicals business that was spun off from [[Hoechst AG]] in [[Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;Anna Bálint: ''Clariant clareant.

Critics of the agreement expressed concern over prospects that the agreement would diminish academic objectivity, or lead to the commercialization of [[genetically modified]] plants. The agreement expired in 2003.

====2000 to 2010====

==Research==
The company's global research operations, called "Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research (NIBR)" have their global headquarters in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], Massachusetts, [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Casey |last=Ross |title=Novartis doubles plan for Cambridge |url=http://www.boston.com/business/healthcare/articles/2010/10/27/novartis_doubles_plan_for_cambridge/ |work=The Boston Globe |date=2010-10-27 |accessdate=2010-10-31| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121103015727/http://www.boston.com/business/healthcare/articles/2010/10/27/novartis_doubles_plan_for_cambridge/ | archivedate = 2012-11-03| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nibr.com/ Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research Official SIte] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502162718/http://www.nibr.com/ |date=2 May 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Two research institutes reside within NIBR that focus on diseases in the developing world: Novartis Institute for Tropical Diseases, which works on tuberculosis, dengue, and malaria, and Novartis Vaccines Institute for Global Health, which works on salmonella typhi (typhoid fever) and shigella.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nibr.com/research/developing_world/index.shtml Innovation for the developing world] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209173427/http://www.nibr.com/research/developing_world/index.shtml |date=9 February 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Novartis is also involved in publicly funded collaborative research projects, with other industrial and academic partners. One example in the area of [[Pre-clinical development|non-clinical]] safety assessment is the InnoMed PredTox project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last1 = Mattes | first1 = William B.| chapter = Public Consortium Efforts in Toxicogenomics | doi = 10.1007/978-1-60327-048-9_11 | title = Essential Concepts in Toxicogenomics| editor1-last = Mendrick | editor1-first = Donna L.| editor2-last = Mattes | editor2-first = William B.| series = [[Methods in Molecular Biology]]| volume = 460 | pages = 221–238 | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-1-58829-638-2 | pmid = 18449490 | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="InnoMed PredTox official project website"&gt;{{Citation |title=InnoMed PredTox Member Organizations |type=web page|publisher=InnoMed |url=http://www.innomed-predtox.com/consortium/members/ |accessdate=2008-08-25|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080926214522/http://www.innomed-predtox.com/consortium/members/|archivedate=2008-09-26&lt;!--this is the earliest archived page--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company is expanding its activities in joint research projects within the framework of the [[Innovative Medicines Initiative]] of [[EFPIA]] and the [[European Commission]].&lt;ref name="IMI Call Topics 2008"&gt;{{Citation |url=http://www.imi.europa.eu/sites/default/files/uploads/documents/calls01_en.zip |format=PDF |year=2008 |work=IMI 1st Call 2008: Information Package (ZIP archive) |editor=Innovative Medicines Initiative |title=IMI-GB-018v2-24042008-CallTopics.pdf |publisher=European Commission |accessdate=2012-01-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924033922/http://www.imi.europa.eu/sites/default/files/uploads/documents/calls01_en.zip |archive-date=24 September 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Novartis is working with [[Science 37]] in order to allow video based [[telemedicine]] visits instead of physical traveling to clinics for patients. It is planning for ten clinical trials over three years using [[mobile technology]] to help free patients from burdensome hospital trips.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-novartis-science-37/novartis-u-s-partner-plan-remote-trials-to-boost-participation-idUSKCN1GJ0KK|title=Novartis, U.S. partner plan remote trials to boost participation|date=2018-03-07|work=Reuters|accessdate=2018-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basel headquarters campus redesign==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Novartis building - 83d40m - basel - frank-gehry p2z.JPG|thumb|[[Human resources]] building of the new Basel campus of Novartis—designed by [[Frank Gehry]]]] --&gt;

An ongoing Basel Campus Project has the aim to transform Novartis headquarters in Basel "from an industrial complex to a place of innovation, knowledge, and encounter".&lt;ref name="novartis1"&gt;{{cite web
|url        = http://www.novartis.com/about-novartis/locations/basel-campus-project.shtml
|title      = Basel Campus Project
|publisher  = Novartis
|accessdate=2007-10-11

In 1999, [[Peter Walker (landscape architect)|PWP Landscape Architecture]] won the competition for a landscape master plan that would transform a 51-acre site beside the Rhine River from a paved industrial landscape crisscrossed with train tracks into a modern—and largely pedestrian—research and administrative campus filled with outdoor art, trees, greens, and parks. The plan also dealt with an extensive network of existing underground infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pwpla.com/projects/norvatis-st-johann-campus-landscape-master-plan/&amp;details|title=Novartis Headquarters, Landscape Master Plan - PWP Landscape Architecture|author=Brooklyn Digital Foundry|work=pwpla.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The buildings were gradually demolished and replaced with works by architects and artists of international stature. [[Frank Gehry]], [[Rafael Moneo]], and from [[SANAA]], [[Kazuyo Sejima]] and [[Ryue Nishizawa]] were among the architects and [[Jenny Holzer]] and [[Richard Serra]] among the artists. Marked diversity of forms now dominates the campus. Novel features and technologies were introduced by Gehry to conform to the building standards of the Swiss government that prohibit [[air-conditioning]], while still selecting a contemporary style of massive use of glass exteriors. One adaptation by the architect includes the integration of a building vent, [[teepee]]-style, through the roof, which creates a chimney effect that draws cool air in at the lower levels and vents warmer air.

==Controversies and criticism==
===Challenge to India's patent laws===
{{Main|Novartis v. Union of India &amp; Others}}

Novartis fought a seven-year, controversial battle to patent [[Imatinib|Gleevec]] in India, and took the case all the way to the [[Indian Supreme Court]], where the patent application was finally rejected. The patent application at the center of the case was filed by Novartis in India in 1998, after India had agreed to enter the [[World Trade Organization]] and to abide by worldwide intellectual property standards under the [[TRIPS]] agreement. As part of this agreement, India made changes to its patent law; the biggest of which was that prior to these changes, patents on products were not allowed, while afterwards they were, albeit with restrictions. These changes came into effect in 2005, so Novartis' patent application waited in a "mailbox" with others until then, under procedures that India instituted to manage the transition. India also passed certain amendments to its patent law in 2005, just before the laws came into effect, which played a key role in the rejection of the patent application.&lt;ref name=NYTimesIndiaDecision/&gt;

The patent application&lt;ref&gt;Note: The Indian patent application No.1602/MAS/1998 does not appear to be publicly available. However according to [https://www.scribd.com/doc/133340456/IPAB-Order-Dated-26-Jun-2009-in-Novartis-v-Union-of-India the decision of the IPAB on 26 June 2009] (page 27) discussed below, "The Appellant’s application under the PCT was substantially on the same invention as had been made in India." {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022185309/http://www.scribd.com/doc/133340456/IPAB-Order-Dated-26-Jun-2009-in-Novartis-v-Union-of-India |date=22 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PCT"&gt;[http://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO1999003854 Published PCT application WO1999003854] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022201745/http://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO1999003854 |date=22 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; claimed the final form of Gleevec (the beta crystalline form of imatinib [[mesylate]]).&lt;ref&gt;Staff, European Medicines Agency, 2004.

The solid form of imatinib mesylate in Gleevec is beta crystalline.&lt;ref&gt;[http://judis.nic.in/supremecourt/imgs1.aspx?filename=40212 Indian Supreme Court Decision] paragraphs 5-6 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130706085312/http://judis.nic.in/supremecourt/imgs1.aspx?filename=40212 |date=6 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As provided under the TRIPS agreement, Novartis applied for Exclusive Marketing Rights (EMR) for Gleevec from the Indian Patent Office and the EMR was granted in November 2003.&lt;ref name="Decision8-9"&gt;[http://judis.nic.in/supremecourt/imgs1.aspx?filename=40212 Novartis v UoI, para 8-9] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130706085312/http://judis.nic.in/supremecourt/imgs1.aspx?filename=40212 |date=6 July 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Novartis made use of the EMR to obtain orders against some generic manufacturers who had already launched Gleevec in India.&lt;ref name=SpicyIP1/&gt; Novartis set the price of Gleevec at USD 2666 per patient per month; generic companies were selling their versions at USD 177 to 266 per patient per month.&lt;ref&gt;Staff, LawyersCollective. 6 September 2011 [http://www.lawyerscollective.org/news/archived-news-a-articles/126-novartis-case-background-and-update-supreme-court-of-india-to-recommence-hearing.html Novartis case: background and update – Supreme Court of India to recommence hearing] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021011059/http://www.lawyerscollective.org/news/archived-news-a-articles/126-novartis-case-background-and-update-supreme-court-of-india-to-recommence-hearing.html |date=21 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Novartis also initiated a program to assist patients who could not afford its version of the drug, concurrent with its product launch.&lt;ref name="WSJ"&gt;R.

When examination of Novartis' patent application began in 2005, it came under immediate attack from [[Opposition proceeding|oppositions]] initiated by generic companies that were already selling Gleevec in India and by advocacy groups. The application was rejected by the patent office and by an appeal board. The key basis for the rejection was the part of Indian patent law that was created by amendment in 2005, describing the patentability of new uses for known drugs and modifications of known drugs. That section, Paragraph 3d, specified that such inventions are patentable only if "they differ significantly in properties with regard to efficacy."&lt;ref name="SpicyIP1"&gt;Shamnad Basheer for Spicy IP 11 March 2006 [http://spicyip.com/2006/03/first-mailbox-opposition-gleevec.html First Mailbox Opposition (Gleevec) Decided in India] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021162820/http://spicyip.com/2006/03/first-mailbox-opposition-gleevec.html |date=21 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Appellate"&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/133340456/IPAB-Order-Dated-26-Jun-2009-in-Novartis-v-Union-of-India Intellectual Property Appellate Board decision dated 26 June 2009, p 149] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131022185309/http://www.scribd.com/doc/133340456/IPAB-Order-Dated-26-Jun-2009-in-Novartis-v-Union-of-India |date=22 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At one point, Novartis went to court to try to invalidate Paragraph 3d; it argued that the provision was unconstitutionally vague and that it violated TRIPS. Novartis lost that case and did not appeal.&lt;ref name="2007Decn"&gt;[http://judis.nic.in/judis_chennai/qrydispfree.aspx?filename=11121 W.P. No.24759 of 2006] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131020071414/http://judis.nic.in/judis_chennai/qrydispfree.aspx?filename=11121 |date=20 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Novartis did appeal the rejection by the patent office to India's Supreme Court, which took the case.

The Supreme Court case hinged on the interpretation of Paragraph 3d. The Supreme Court decided that the substance that Novartis sought to patent was indeed a modification of a known drug (the raw form of imatinib, which was publicly disclosed in the 1993 patent application and in scientific articles), that Novartis did not present evidence of a difference in therapeutic efficacy between the final form of Gleevec and the raw form of imatinib, and that therefore the patent application was properly rejected by the patent office and lower courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Supreme Court rejects bid by Novartis to patent Glivec|url=http://spicyipindia.blogspot.co.uk/2013/04/supreme-court-rejects-bid-by-novartis.html| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20131217091420/http://spicyipindia.blogspot.co.uk/2013/04/supreme-court-rejects-bid-by-novartis.html | archivedate = 2013-12-17| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Had Novartis won and had its patent issued, it could not have prevented generics companies in India from selling generic Gleevec, but it could have obliged them to pay a reasonable royalty under a grandfather clause included in India's patent law.&lt;ref&gt;Kevin Grogan for PharmaTimes. 27 February 2012 [http://www.pharmatimes.com/article/12-02-27/Novartis_explains_stance_over_India_patent_law_challenge.aspx Novartis explains stance over India patent law challenge] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141216001159/http://www.pharmatimes.com/article/12-02-27/Novartis_explains_stance_over_India_patent_law_challenge.aspx |date=16 December 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Erklärung von Bern]]. 8 May 2007 [http://www.evb.ch/en/p25012749.html Short questions and answers about the court case initiated by Novartis in India] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021190810/http://www.evb.ch/en/p25012749.html |date=21 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In reaction to the decision, Ranjit Shahani, vice-chairman and managing director of Novartis India Ltd was quoted as saying "This ruling is a setback for patients that will hinder medical progress for diseases without effective treatment options."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.telegraphindia.com/1130402/jsp/business/story_16736700.jsp#.UV3-TcV49_M Shift in Novartis Strategy, The Telegraph] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511194923/http://www.telegraphindia.com/1130402/jsp/business/story_16736700.jsp#.UV3-TcV49_M |date=11 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also said that companies like Novartis would invest less money in research in India as a result of the ruling.&lt;ref name=NYTimesIndiaDecision/&gt;  Novartis also emphasised that it continues to be committed to good access to its drugs; according to Novartis, by 2013, "95% of patients in India—roughly 16,000 people—receive Glivec free of charge... and it has provided more than $1.7&amp;nbsp;billion worth of Glivec to Indian patients in its support program since it was started...."&lt;ref name=WSJ /&gt;

===Marketing violations===
In September 2008, the US [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) sent a notice to Novartis Pharmaceuticals regarding its advertising of [[Focalin]] XR, an [[ADHD]] drug, in which the company overstated its efficacy while marketing to the public and medical professionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/ICECI/EnforcementActions/WarningLetters/2008/ucm1048118.htm |title=Focalin XR (dexmethylphenidate hydrochloride) extended-release capsules CII |date=2008-09-25 |work=Warning Letters |publisher=[[Food and Drug Administration|US Food and Drug Administration]] |accessdate=2009-08-05 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/68JlJjSGb?url=http://www.fda.gov/ICECI/EnforcementActions/WarningLetters/2008/ucm1048118.htm |archivedate=10 June 2012 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, federal prosecutors opened an investigation into Novartis' marketing of several drugs: [[Trileptal]], an antiseizure drug; three drugs for heart conditions - [[Diovan]] (the company’s top-selling product), [[Exforge]], and [[Tekturna]]; [[Sandostatin]], a drug to treat a growth hormone disorder; and [[Zelnorm]], a drug for irritable bowel syndrome.&lt;ref name=NYTtrileptal/&gt; In September, 2010, Novartis agreed to pay US$422.5&amp;nbsp;million in criminal and civil claims and to enter into a [[corporate integrity agreement]] with the US Office of the Inspector General.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.novartis.com/newsroom/media-releases/en/2010/1448151.shtml |title=Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, a US subsidiary of Novartis AG, reaches settlement agreement with US Attorney's Office |publisher=Novartis |date=2010-09-30 |accessdate=2012-01-16 |type=press release |at=Media Releases |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131017111251/http://www.novartis.com/newsroom/media-releases/en/2010/1448151.shtml |archivedate=17 October 2013 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''The New York Times'' "Federal prosecutors accused Novartis of paying illegal kickbacks to health care professionals through speaker programs, advisory boards, entertainment, travel and meals.

"So it’s not surprising that they would settle because they don’t have a legal leg to stand on."

===Fighting off-label prescribing===
Outside the US, Novartis markets the drug [[ranibizumab]] (trade name Lucentis), which is a [[monoclonal antibody]] fragment derived from the same parent mouse antibody as [[bevacizumab]] (Avastin).  Both Avastin and Lucentis were created by [[Genentech]] which is owned by Roche; Roche markets Avastin worldwide, and also markets Lucentis in the US.  Lucentis has been approved worldwide as a treatment for wet [[macular degeneration]] and other retinal disorders; Avastin is used to treat certain cancers.

===Valsartan data scandal===
In the summer of 2013, two Japanese universities retracted several publications of clinical trials that purported to show that [[Valsartan]] (branded as Diovan) had cardiovascular benefits, when it was found that statistical analysis had been manipulated, and that a Novartis employee had participated in the statistical analysis but had not disclosed his relationship with Novartis but only his affiliation with Osaka City University, where he was a lecturer.&lt;ref name="WSJaug"&gt;Kana Inagaki for ''The Wall Street Journal''. 11 August 2013 [https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424127887323838204579000403952581982 Novartis Hit by Scandal Over Japanese Drug Studies: Probes Uncover Altered Research Data; Swiss Giant Stands by Heart Medicine Diovan] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131013192537/http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424127887323838204579000403952581982 |date=13 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bribery of Greek officials===
In January 2018, Novartis began being investigated by Greek authorities over allegations of bribery towards public officials in the 2006-2015 period. Two former prime ministers, former ministers served in the ministries of health and economy, and bankers are included in the case,&lt;ref name="greece.greekreporter.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://greece.greekreporter.com/2018/02/06/greek-officials-hit-back-at-novartis-bribery-allegations/|title=Greek Officials Hit Back at Novartis Bribery Allegations {{!}} GreekReporter.com|website=greece.greekreporter.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the current manager of Novartis is banned from leaving the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fiercepharma.com/legal/greek-officials-ban-novartis-manager-from-leaving-country-amid-widening-bribery-probe-report|title=Greek officials ban Novartis manager from leaving the country amid widening bribery probe: report {{!}} FiercePharma|website=www.fiercepharma.com|language=en|access-date=2018-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The minister's deputy described the allegations as "the biggest scandal since the creation of the Greek state", which caused "annual state expenditure on medicine to explode".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2018/02/05/world/europe/ap-eu-greece-pharma-scandal.html|title=Greek Govt Alleges Official Ties to Drug Bribery Scandal|last=Press|first=The Associated|date=2018-02-05|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-02-07|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the ministers involved in the scandal have denied the allegations, calling the case "political targeting" and "bullying".&lt;ref name="greece.greekreporter.com"/&gt; Besides bribery that involves artificial increases in the price of several medicines, the case also involves money laundering, with suspicions of "illegal funds of more than four billion euros ($4.2 billion)" were involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/en/novartis-under-investigation-for-bribery-in-greece/a-37230558|title=Novartis under investigation for bribery in Greece {{!}} Europe{{!}} News and current affairs from around the continent {{!}} DW {{!}} 22.01.2017|last=(www.dw.com)|first=Deutsche Welle|website=DW.COM|language=en|access-date=2018-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Michael Cohen payments===
Novartis paid $1.2 million to Essential Consultants, an entity owned by [[Michael Cohen (lawyer)|Michael Cohen]], following the 2017 inauguration of Donald Trump. Cohen was paid monthly, with each payment just under $100,000.  Novartis claims it paid Cohen to help it understand and influence the new administration's approach to drug pricing and regulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/61e2cca8-5363-11e8-b3ee-41e0209208ec|title=Novartis admits $1.2m in payments to Trump lawyer|accessdate=2018-05-10|publisher=''Financial Times''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2018, the [[US Senate committee]] report "White House Access for Sale" revealed that Novartis Ag's relationship with Cohen was "longer and more detailed". Novartis initially stated that the relationship ceased a month after entering the USD 1.2 million contract with Cohen's consulting firm since the consultants were not able to provide the information the pharmaceutical company needed. Later, it became clear, however, that [[Joe Jimenez]] and Cohen communicated via email multiple times during 2017, which included ideas to lower drug prices to be discussed with the president. According to the report, several of the ideas appeared later in Trump's drug pricing plan, released in early 2018, in which pharmaceutical companies were protected from reduced revenues.&lt;ref&gt;Emma Court (16 July 2018.)

A '''nuclear pumped laser''' is a [[laser]] [[laser pumping|pumped]] with the energy of [[nuclear fission|fission]] fragments. The [[lasing medium]] is enclosed in a tube lined with [[uranium-235]] and subjected to high [[neutron flux]] in a [[nuclear reactor]] core. The fission fragments of the uranium create excited [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] with [[inverse population]] of energy levels, which then lases. Other methods, e.g. the He-Ar laser, can use the He(n,p)H reaction, the transmutation of [[helium-3]] in a neutron flux, as the energy source, or employing the energy of the [[alpha particle]]s.

This technology may achieve high excitation rates with small laser volumes.

Some example lasing media:

* [[carbon dioxide]]
* &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;[[helium]]-[[argon]]
* &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;[[helium]]-[[krypton]]
* &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;[[helium]]-[[xenon]]

==Development==

Research in nuclear pumped lasers started in the early 1970s when researchers were unable to produce a laser with a wavelength shorter than 110&amp;nbsp;nm with the end goal of creating an [[x-ray]] laser. When laser wavelengths become that short the laser requires a huge amount of energy which must also be delivered in an extremely short period of time.  In 1975 it was estimated, by [[George Chapline]] and [[Lowell Wood]] from the [[Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory]], that “pumping a 10-keV (0.12-nm) laser would require around a watt per atom” in a pulse that was “10&lt;sup&gt;−15&lt;/sup&gt; seconds x the square of the wavelength in angstroms.”  As this problem was unsolvable with the materials at hand and a laser oscillator was not working, research moved to creating pumps that used excited plasma.  Early attempts used high-powered lasers to excite the plasma to create an even more highly powered laser.  Results using this method were unsatisfying, and fell short of the goal.  Livermore scientists first suggested using a nuclear reaction as a power source in 1975.  By 1980 Livermore considered both nuclear bombs and nuclear reactors as viable energy sources for an x-ray laser.  
On November 14, 1980, the first successful test of the bomb-powered x-ray laser was conducted.  The use of a bomb was initially supported over that of the reactor driven laser because it delivered a more intense beam.  Livermore’s research was almost entirely devoted to [[missile defense]] using x-ray lasers.  The idea was to mount a system of nuclear bombs in space where these bombs would each power approximately 50 lasers.  Upon detonation these lasers would fire and theoretically destroy several dozen incoming nuclear missiles at once.  Opponents{{who|date=March 2014}} of this plan found many faults in such an approach and questioned aspects such as the power, range, accuracy, politics, and cost of such deployments.  In 1985 a test titled ‘Goldstone’ revealed the delivered power to be less than believed.  Efforts to focus the laser also failed.

Fusion lasers (reactor driven lasers) started testing after the bomb-driven lasers proved successful.  While prohibitively expensive (estimated at 30,000 dollars per test), research was easier in that tests could be performed several times a day and the equipment could be reused.  In 1984, a test achieved wavelengths of less than 21&amp;nbsp;nm the closest to an official x-ray laser yet.  (There are many definitions for an x-ray laser, some of which require a wavelength of less than 10&amp;nbsp;nm). The Livermore method was to remove the outer electrons in heavy atoms to create a “neon-like” substance.  When presented at an [[American Physical Society]] meeting, the success of the test was shared by an experiment from Princeton University which was better in size, cost, measured wavelength, and amplification than Livermore’s test.  Research has continued in the field of nuclear pumped lasers and it remains on the cutting edge of the field.&lt;ref&gt;Hecht, Jeff.  “The History of the X-ray Laser”.  Optics and Photonics News.  Optical Society of America, 2013.  http://www.osa-opn.org/home/articles/volume_19/issue_5/features/the_history_of_the_x-ray_laser/#.UX3l-spUK0h&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rearden, Steven L. .Congress and SDO.  May 21, 1997.  http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a338619.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
At least 3 uses for bomb pumped lasers have been proposed.

===Propulsion===
Laser propulsion is an alternative method of propulsion ideal for launching objects into orbit, as this method requires less fuel, meaning less mass must be launched.  A nuclear pumped laser is ideal for this operation.  A launch using laser propulsion requires high intensity, short pulses, good quality, and a high power output.  A nuclear pumped laser would theoretically be capable of meeting these requirements.&lt;ref&gt;Boody, Frederick P.  "200-MW 2.026-pm He/Ar/Xe Pump Laser for Space Propulsion". Ion Light Technologies.  http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=1312158&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manufacturing===
The characteristics of the nuclear pumped laser make it ideal for applications in deep-cut welding, cutting thick materials, the heat treating of metals, vapor deposition of ceramics, and the production of sub-micron sized particles.

===Weapon===
Titled [[Project Excalibur]], the program was a part of President Reagan’s [[Strategic Defense Initiative]].  Livermore Laboratories conceived of the initial idea and [[Edward Teller]] developed and presented the idea to the president.  Permission was granted to pursue the project though it has been reported Reagan was reluctant to incorporate nuclear devices in the nation’s plan against nuclear devices.  While initial tests were promising, the results never reached acceptable levels.  Later, lead scientists were accused of falsifying the reports.  Project Excalibur was cancelled several years later.&lt;ref&gt;Thomsen, Dietrich E. (1985, December 14). Strategic defense of X-ray initiative. The Free Library. (1985).

'''Nudge''', also known as '''buzz''', is a feature of [[instant messaging]] software used to get the attention of another user, for example, by shaking the conversation window or playing a sound. The feature was first introduced in [[MSN Messenger]] 7.0, in 2005.{{fact|date=December 2010}}

[[Extensible Messaging and Presence Protocol|XMPP]] extension protocol XEP-0224 calls this feature ''Attention''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0224.html XEP-0224: Attention]&lt;/ref&gt;

== MSN Messenger and Windows Live Messenger ==
It is possible to change memory values of Windows Live Messenger to allow nudges to be sent unlimited with no time delay. This can be done manually with a memory editor such as [[Cheat Engine]] or with patching programs. Virtually all instant messaging programs that support [[Microsoft Notification Protocol|MSNP]] (such as [[aMSN]] and [[Pidgin]]) allow this to be done without any extra hacks.

'''Ohm's law''' states that the [[electric current|current]] through a [[Electrical conductor|conductor]] between two points is directly [[Proportionality (mathematics)|proportional]] to the [[voltage]] across the two points. Introducing the constant of proportionality, the [[Electrical resistance|resistance]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

More specifically, Ohm's law states that the ''R'' in this relation is constant, independent of the current.&lt;ref&gt;

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ohm's law is an [[empirical law|empirical relation]] which accurately describes the conductivity of the vast majority of [[electrical conductor|electrically conductive materials]] over many orders of magnitude of current.  However some materials do not obey Ohm's law, these are called [[Non-ohmic resistance|non-ohmic]].

The law was named after the German physicist [[Georg Ohm]], who, in a treatise published in 1827, described measurements of applied voltage and current through simple electrical circuits containing various lengths of wire. Ohm explained his experimental results by a slightly more complex equation than the modern form above (see [[#History|History]]).

In physics, the term ''Ohm's law'' is also used to refer to various generalizations of the law; for example the [[Vector (mathematics and physics)|vector]] form of the law used in [[electromagnetics]] and material science:

where '''J''' is the [[current density]] at a given location in a resistive material, '''E''' is the electric field at that location, and ''σ'' ([[sigma]]) is a material-dependent parameter called the [[electrical conductivity|conductivity]].

==History==
[[File:Ohm3.gif|thumb|200px|Georg Ohm]]
In January 1781, before [[Georg Ohm]]'s work, [[Henry Cavendish]] experimented with [[Leyden jar]]s and glass tubes of varying diameter and length filled with salt solution.  He measured the current by noting how strong a shock he felt as he completed the circuit with his body.  Cavendish wrote that the "velocity" (current) varied directly as the "degree of electrification" (voltage). He did not communicate his results to other scientists at the time,&lt;ref name=eb&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Electricity|volume=9|page=182|first=John Ambrose |last=Fleming}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his results were unknown until [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]] published them in 1879.&lt;ref&gt;Sanford P. Bordeau (1982)  ''Volts to Hertz...the Rise of Electricity.''  Burgess Publishing Company, Minneapolis, MN.  pp.86–107, {{ISBN|0-8087-4908-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Francis Ronalds]] delineated “intensity” (voltage) and “quantity” (current) for the [[Voltaic pile#Dry pile|dry pile]] – a high voltage source – in 1814 using a [[Electrometer#Gold-leaf electrometer|gold-leaf electrometer]].  He found for a dry pile that the relationship between the two parameters was not proportional under certain meteorological conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sir Francis Ronalds: Father of the Electric Telegraph|last=Ronalds|first=B.

[[File:Ohmsches Gesetz in Georg Simon Ohms Laborbuch.jpg|thumb|Ohm's law in Georg Ohm's lab book.]]
Ohm did his work on resistance in the years 1825 and 1826, and published his results in 1827 as the book ''Die galvanische Kette, mathematisch bearbeitet'' ("The galvanic circuit investigated mathematically").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; He drew considerable inspiration from [[Joseph Fourier|Fourier]]'s work on heat conduction in the theoretical explanation of his work.  For experiments, he initially used [[voltaic pile]]s, but later used a [[thermocouple]] as this provided a more stable voltage source in terms of internal resistance and constant voltage.  He used a galvanometer to measure current, and knew that the voltage between the thermocouple terminals was proportional to the junction temperature.  He then added test wires of varying length, diameter, and material to complete the circuit.  He found that his data could be modeled through the equation
:&lt;math&gt;x = \frac{a}{b + l},&lt;/math&gt;
where ''x'' was the reading from the [[galvanometer]], ''l'' was the length of the test conductor, ''a'' depended on the thermocouple junction temperature, and ''b'' was a constant of the entire setup.  From this, Ohm determined his law of proportionality and published his results.

In modern notation we would write,

:&lt;math&gt; I = \frac {\mathcal E}{r+R},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathcal E&lt;/math&gt; is the open-circuit emf of the thermocouple, &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; is the internal resistance of the thermocouple and &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is the resistance of the test wire.  In terms of the length of the wire this becomes,

:&lt;math&gt; I = \frac {\mathcal E}{r+\mathcal R l},&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathcal R&lt;/math&gt; is the resistance of the test wire per unit length.  Thus, Ohm's coefficients are,

:&lt;math&gt; a = \frac {\mathcal E}{\mathcal R}, \quad b = \frac {\mathcal r}{\mathcal R} .&lt;/math&gt;

Ohm's law was probably the most important of the early quantitative descriptions of the physics of electricity.  We consider it almost obvious today. When Ohm first published his work, this was not the case; critics reacted to his treatment of the subject with hostility.  They called his work a "web of naked fancies"&lt;ref&gt;
Davies, B, "A web of naked fancies?", ''Physics Education'' 15 57–61, Institute of Physics, Issue 1, Jan 1980 [http://www.iop.org/EJ/S/UNREG/an0VsEw7ynSY0UzIRNaNVQ/abstract/0031-9120/15/1/314]
&lt;/ref&gt; and the German Minister of Education proclaimed that "a professor who preached such heresies was unworthy to teach science."&lt;ref&gt;Hart, IB, ''Makers of Science'', London, Oxford University Press, 1923. p. 243. [http://www.foresight.org/news/negativeComments.html#loc037]&lt;/ref&gt; The prevailing scientific philosophy in Germany at the time asserted that experiments need not be performed to develop an understanding of nature because nature is so well ordered, and that scientific truths may be deduced through reasoning alone.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Schnädelbach, ''Philosophy in Germany 1831–1933'', pages 78-79, Cambridge University Press, 1984 {{ISBN|0521296463}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, Ohm's brother Martin, a mathematician, was battling the German educational system. These factors hindered the acceptance of Ohm's work, and his work did not become widely accepted until the 1840s.  However, Ohm received recognition for his contributions to science well before he died.

In the 1850s, Ohm's law was known as such and was widely considered proved, and alternatives, such as "[[Barlow's law]]", were discredited, in terms of real applications to telegraph system design, as discussed by [[Samuel F. B. Morse]] in 1855.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Shaffner's Telegraph Companion: Devoted to the Science and Art of the Morse Telegraph | author = Taliaferro Preston | authorlink = Taliaferro Preston Shaffner | publisher = Pudney &amp; Russell | volume = Vol.2 | year = 1855 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=TDEOAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA43&amp;dq=ohm%27s-law+date:0-1860 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[electron]] was discovered in 1897 by [[J. J. Thomson]], and it was quickly realized that it is the particle ([[charge carrier]]) that carries electric currents in electric circuits.  In 1900 the first ([[classical physics|classical]]) model of electrical conduction, the [[Drude model]], was proposed by [[Paul Drude]], which finally gave a scientific explanation for Ohm's law.  In this model, a solid conductor consists of a stationary lattice of [[atom]]s ([[ion]]s), with [[conduction electron]]s moving randomly in it.  A voltage across a conductor causes an [[electric field]], which accelerates the electrons in the direction of the electric field, causing a drift of electrons which is the electric current.  However the electrons collide with and scatter off of the atoms, which randomizes their motion, thus converting the kinetic energy added to the electron by the field to [[heat]] ([[thermal energy]]).  Using statistical distributions, it can be shown that the average drift velocity of the electrons, and thus the current, is proportional to the electric field, and thus the voltage, over a wide range of voltages.

The development of [[quantum mechanics]] in the 1920s modified this picture somewhat, but in modern theories the average drift velocity of electrons can still be shown to be proportional to the electric field, thus deriving Ohm's law. In 1927 [[Arnold Sommerfeld]] applied the quantum [[Fermi-Dirac distribution]] of electron energies to the Drude model, resulting in the [[free electron model]]. A year later, [[Felix Bloch]] showed that electrons move in waves ([[Bloch wave]]s) through a solid crystal lattice, so scattering off the lattice atoms as postulated in the Drude model is not a major process; the electrons scatter off impurity atoms and defects in the material. The final successor, the modern quantum [[band theory]] of solids, showed that the electrons in a solid cannot take on any energy as assumed in the Drude model but are restricted to energy bands, with gaps between them of energies that electrons are forbidden to have.   The size of the band gap is a characteristic of a particular substance which has a great deal to do with its electrical resistivity, explaining why some substances are [[electrical conductor]]s, some [[semiconductor]]s, and some [[insulator (electricity)|insulator]]s.

While the old term for electrical conductance, the [[Siemens (unit)|mho]] (the inverse of the resistance unit ohm), is still used, a new name, the [[Siemens (unit)|siemens]], was adopted in 1971, honoring [[Ernst Werner von Siemens]].  The siemens is preferred in formal papers.

In the 1920s, it was discovered that the current through a practical resistor actually has statistical fluctuations, which depend on temperature, even when voltage and resistance are exactly constant; this fluctuation, now known as [[Johnson–Nyquist noise]], is due to the discrete nature of charge.  This thermal effect implies that measurements of current and voltage that are taken over sufficiently short periods of time will yield ratios of V/I that fluctuate from the value of R implied by the time average or [[ensemble average]] of the measured current; Ohm's law remains correct for the average current, in the case of ordinary resistive materials.

Ohm's work long preceded [[Maxwell's equations]] and any understanding of frequency-dependent effects in AC circuits. Modern developments in electromagnetic theory and circuit theory do not contradict Ohm's law when they are evaluated within the appropriate limits.

==Scope==
Ohm's law is an [[empirical law]], a generalization from many experiments that have shown that current is approximately proportional to electric field for most materials. It is less fundamental than [[Maxwell's equations]] and is not always obeyed. Any given material will [[electrical breakdown|break down]] under a strong-enough electric field, and some materials of interest in electrical engineering are "non-ohmic" under weak fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Purcell |first=Edward M. |authorlink=Edward Mills Purcell |year=1985 |title=Electricity and magnetism |edition=2nd |series=Berkeley Physics Course |volume=2 |isbn=0-07-004908-4 |publisher=McGraw-Hill |page=129}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Griffiths |first=David J. |authorlink=David Griffiths (physicist) |year=1999 |title=Introduction to electrodynamics |edition=3rd |publisher=Prentice Hall |isbn=0-13-805326-X |page=289}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ohm's law has been observed on a wide range of length scales. In the early 20th century, it was thought that Ohm's law would fail at the [[Atomic spacing|atomic scale]], but experiments have not borne out this expectation. As of 2012, researchers have demonstrated that Ohm's law works for [[silicon]] wires as small as four atoms wide and one atom high.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Weber | first1 = B. | last2 = Mahapatra | first2 = S. | last3 = Ryu | first3 = H. | last4 = Lee | first4 = S. | last5 = Fuhrer | first5 = A. | last6 = Reusch | first6 = T.

The dependence of the current density on the applied electric field is essentially [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] in nature;  (see Classical and quantum conductivity.)  A qualitative description leading to Ohm's law can be based upon [[classical mechanics]] using the [[Drude model]] developed by [[Paul Drude]] in 1900.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The Drude model treats [[electron]]s (or other charge carriers) like pinballs bouncing among the [[ion]]s that make up the structure of the material.  Electrons will be accelerated in the opposite direction to the electric field by the average electric field at their location. With each collision, though, the electron is deflected in a random direction with a velocity that is much larger than the velocity gained by the electric field.  The net result is that electrons take a zigzag path due to the collisions, but generally drift in a direction opposing the electric field.

The [[drift velocity]] then determines the electric [[current density]] and its relationship to '''''E''''' and is independent of the collisions.  Drude calculated the average drift velocity from '''''p'''''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;−''e'''E'''τ'' where '''''p''''' is the average [[momentum]], −''e'' is the charge of the electron and τ is the average time between the collisions.   Since both the momentum and the current density are proportional to the drift velocity, the current density becomes proportional to the applied electric field; this leads to Ohm's law.

==Hydraulic analogy==

A [[hydraulic analogy]] is sometimes used to describe Ohm's law.  Water pressure, measured by [[pascal (unit)|pascals]] (or [[pounds per square inch|PSI]]), is the analog of voltage because establishing a water pressure difference between two points along a (horizontal) pipe causes water to flow.  Water flow rate, as in [[liter]]s per second, is the analog of current, as in [[coulomb]]s per second. Finally, flow restrictors—such as apertures placed in pipes between points where the water pressure is measured—are the analog of resistors. We say that the rate of water flow through an aperture restrictor is proportional to the difference in water pressure across the restrictor. Similarly, the rate of flow of electrical charge, that is, the electric current, through an electrical resistor is proportional to the difference in voltage measured across the resistor.

Flow and pressure variables can be calculated in fluid flow network with the use of the hydraulic ohm analogy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=A. Akers |author2=M. Gassman |author3=R.

Esposito, "A Simplified Method for Analyzing Circuits by Analogy", ''Machine Design'', October 1969, pp. 173–177.&lt;/ref&gt;  The method can be applied to both steady and transient flow situations.  In the linear [[laminar flow]] region, [[Poiseuille's law]] describes the hydraulic resistance of a pipe, but in the [[turbulent flow]] region the pressure–flow relations become nonlinear.

The hydraulic analogy to Ohm's law has been used, for example, to approximate blood flow through the circulatory system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Guyton |first1=Arthur |last2=Hall |first2=John |editor1-first=Rebecca |editor1-last=Gruliow |title=Textbook of Medical Physiology |edition=11th |year=2006 |publisher=Elsevier Inc. |location=Philadelphia, Pennsylvania |isbn=0-7216-0240-1 |page=164  |chapter=Chapter 14: Overview of the Circulation; Medical Physics of Pressure, Flow, and Resistance}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The interchangeability of the equation may be represented by a triangle, where V ([[voltage]]) is placed on the top section, the I ([[electric current|current]]) is placed to the left section, and the R ([[electrical resistance|resistance]]) is placed to the right. The line that divides the left and right sections indicates multiplication, and the divider between the top and bottom sections indicates division (hence the division bar).

===Resistive circuits===

[[Resistor]]s are circuit elements that impede the passage of electric charge in agreement with Ohm's law, and are designed to have a specific resistance value ''R''.  In a schematic diagram the resistor is shown as a zig-zag symbol.  An element (resistor or conductor) that behaves according to Ohm's law over some operating range is referred to as an ''ohmic device'' (or an ''ohmic resistor'') because Ohm's law and a single value for the resistance suffice to describe the behavior of the device over that range.

Ohm's law holds for circuits containing only resistive elements (no capacitances or inductances) for all forms of driving voltage or current, regardless of whether the driving voltage or current is constant ([[direct current|DC]]) or time-varying such as [[alternating current|AC]].  At any instant of time Ohm's law is valid for such circuits.

Resistors which are in ''[[Series and parallel circuits#Series circuits|series]]'' or in ''[[Series and parallel circuits#Parallel circuits|parallel]]'' may be grouped together into a single "equivalent resistance" in order to apply Ohm's law in analyzing the circuit.

===Reactive circuits with time-varying signals===

When reactive elements such as capacitors, inductors, or transmission lines are involved in a circuit to which AC or time-varying voltage or current is applied, the relationship between voltage and current becomes the solution to a [[differential equation]], so Ohm's law (as defined above) does not directly apply since that form contains only resistances having value R, not complex impedances which may contain capacitance ("C") or inductance ("L").

Equations for [[time-invariant]] [[alternating current|AC]] circuits take the same form as Ohm's law. However, the variables are generalized to [[complex number]]s and the current and voltage waveforms are [[complex exponential]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Fundamentals of Electrical Engineering | author = Rajendra Prasad | publisher = Prentice-Hall of India | year = 2006 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=nsmcbzOJU3kC&amp;pg=PA140&amp;dq=ohm%27s-law+complex+exponentials | isbn = 978-81-203-2729-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this approach, a voltage or current waveform takes the form &lt;math&gt;Ae^{st}&lt;/math&gt;, where ''t'' is time, ''s'' is a complex parameter, and ''A'' is a complex scalar.  In any [[LTI system theory|linear time-invariant system]], all of the currents and voltages can be expressed with the same ''s'' parameter as the input to the system, allowing the time-varying complex exponential term to be canceled out and the system described algebraically in terms of the complex scalars in the current and voltage waveforms.

The complex generalization of resistance is [[electrical impedance|impedance]], usually denoted ''Z''; it can be shown that for an inductor,

:&lt;math&gt;Z = sL\,&lt;/math&gt;

and for a capacitor,

:&lt;math&gt;Z = \frac{1}{sC}.&lt;/math&gt;

We can now write,

:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{V} = \boldsymbol{I} \cdot \boldsymbol{Z}&lt;/math&gt;

where '''''V''''' and '''''I''''' are the complex scalars in the voltage and current respectively and '''''Z''''' is the complex impedance.

This form of Ohm's law, with ''Z'' taking the place of ''R'', generalizes the simpler form.  When ''Z'' is complex, only the real part is responsible for dissipating heat.

In the general AC circuit, ''Z'' varies strongly with the frequency parameter ''s'', and so also will the relationship between voltage and current.

For the common case of a steady [[Sine wave|sinusoid]], the ''s'' parameter is taken to be &lt;math&gt;j\omega&lt;/math&gt;, corresponding to a complex sinusoid &lt;math&gt;Ae^{\mbox{ } j \omega t}&lt;/math&gt;.  The real parts of such complex current and voltage waveforms describe the actual sinusoidal currents and voltages in a circuit, which can be in different phases due to the different complex scalars.

===Linear approximations===

{{See also|Small-signal modeling|Network analysis (electrical circuits)#Small signal equivalent circuit}}

Ohm's law is one of the basic equations used in the [[Network analysis (electrical circuits)|analysis of electrical circuits]].  It applies to both metal conductors and circuit components ([[resistor]]s) specifically made for this behaviour.  Both are ubiquitous in electrical engineering.  Materials and components that obey Ohm's law are described as "ohmic" &lt;ref&gt;Hughes, E, ''Electrical Technology'', pp10, Longmans, 1969.&lt;/ref&gt; which means they produce the same value for resistance (R = V/I) regardless of the value of V or I which is applied and whether the applied voltage or current is DC ([[direct current]]) of either positive or negative polarity or AC ([[alternating current]]).

In a true ohmic device, the same value of resistance will be calculated from R = V/I regardless of the value of the applied voltage V.  That is, the ratio of V/I is constant, and when current is plotted as a function of voltage the curve is ''linear'' (a straight line).  If voltage is forced to some value V, then that voltage V divided by measured current I will equal R.  Or if the current is forced to some value I, then the measured voltage V divided by that current I is also R.  Since the plot of I versus V is a straight line, then it is also true that for any set of two different voltages V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; applied across a given device of resistance R, producing currents I&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;/R and I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/R, that the ratio (V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;−V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)/(I&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;−I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is also a constant equal to R.  The operator "delta" (Δ) is used to represent a difference in a quantity, so we can write ΔV = V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;−V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ΔI = I&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;−I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.  Summarizing, for any truly ohmic device having resistance R, V/I = ΔV/ΔI = R for any applied voltage or current or for the difference between any set of applied voltages or currents.

There are, however, components of electrical circuits which do not obey Ohm's law; that is, their relationship between current and voltage (their [[I–V curve]]) is ''nonlinear'' (or non-ohmic).  An example is the [[Diode#Shockley diode equation|p-n junction diode]] (curve at right).  As seen in the figure, the current does not increase linearly with applied voltage for a diode.  One can determine a value of current (I) for a given value of applied voltage (V) from the curve, but not from Ohm's law, since the value of "resistance" is not constant as a function of applied voltage.  Further, the current only increases significantly if the applied voltage is positive, not negative.  The ratio ''V''/''I'' for some point along the nonlinear curve is sometimes called the ''static'', or ''chordal'', or [[direct current|DC]], resistance,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Engineering System Dynamics | author = Forbes T.

This means the "DC resistance" V/I at some point on the curve is not the same as what would be determined by applying an AC signal having peak amplitude ΔV volts or ΔI amps centered at that same point along the curve and measuring ΔV/ΔI. However, in some diode applications, the AC signal applied to the device is small and it is possible to analyze the circuit in terms of the ''dynamic'', ''small-signal'', or ''incremental'' resistance, defined as the one over the slope of the V–I curve at the average value (DC operating point) of the voltage (that is, one over the [[derivative]] of current with respect to voltage).  For sufficiently small signals, the dynamic resistance allows the Ohm's law small signal resistance to be calculated as approximately one over the slope of a line drawn tangentially to the V-I curve at the DC operating point.&lt;ref name=horowitz-hill&gt;{{cite book |last=Horowitz |first=Paul |authorlink=Paul Horowitz |author2=[[Winfield Hill]] | title=The Art of Electronics |edition=2nd |year=1989 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-37095-7 |page = 13 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=bkOMDgwFA28C&amp;pg=PA13&amp;dq=small-signal+%22dynamic+resistance%22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Temperature effects==

Ohm's law has sometimes been stated as, "for a conductor in a given state, the electromotive force is proportional to the current produced."  That is, that the resistance, the ratio of the applied [[electromotive force]] (or voltage) to the current, "does not vary with the current strength ."  The qualifier "in a given state" is usually interpreted as meaning "at a constant temperature," since the resistivity of materials is usually temperature dependent. Because the conduction of current is related to [[Joule heating]] of the conducting body, according to [[Joule's first law]], the temperature of a conducting body may change when it carries a current.  The dependence of resistance on temperature therefore makes resistance depend upon the current in a typical experimental setup, making the law in this form difficult to directly verify.  [[James Clerk Maxwell|Maxwell]] and others worked out several methods to test the law experimentally in 1876, controlling for heating effects.&lt;ref&gt;

==Relation to heat conductions==
{{See also|Conduction (heat)}}
Ohm's principle predicts the flow of electrical charge (i.e. current) in electrical conductors when subjected to the influence of voltage differences; [[Jean Baptiste Joseph Fourier|Jean-Baptiste-Joseph Fourier]]'s principle predicts the flow of [[heat]] in heat conductors when subjected to the influence of temperature differences.

The same equation describes both phenomena, the equation's variables taking on different meanings in the two cases. Specifically, solving a heat conduction (Fourier) problem with ''[[temperature]]'' (the driving "force") and ''[[flux|flux of heat]]'' (the rate of flow of the driven "quantity", i.e. heat energy) variables also solves an analogous [[electrical conduction]] (Ohm) problem having ''[[electric potential]]'' (the driving "force") and ''[[electric current]]'' (the rate of flow of the driven "quantity", i.e. charge) variables.

The basis of Fourier's work was his clear conception and definition of [[thermal conductivity]]. He assumed that, all else being the same, the flux of heat is strictly proportional to the gradient of temperature. Although undoubtedly true for small temperature gradients, strictly proportional behavior will be lost when real materials (e.g. ones having a thermal conductivity that is a function of temperature) are subjected to large temperature gradients.

A similar assumption is made in the statement of Ohm's law: other things being alike, the strength of the current at each point is proportional to the gradient of electric potential. The accuracy of the assumption that flow is proportional to the gradient is more readily tested, using modern measurement methods, for the electrical case than for the heat case.

==Other versions==

Ohm's law, in the form above, is an extremely useful equation in the field of electrical/electronic engineering because it describes how voltage, current and resistance are interrelated on a "macroscopic" level, that is, commonly, as circuit elements in an [[electrical circuit]]. Physicists who study the electrical properties of matter at the microscopic level use a closely related and more general [[Vector (mathematics and physics)|vector]] equation, sometimes also referred to as Ohm's law, having variables that are closely related to the V, I, and R [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]] variables of Ohm's law, but which are each functions of position within the conductor.  Physicists often use this continuum form of Ohm's Law:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
\mathbf{E} = \rho \mathbf{J}
&lt;/math&gt;

where "'''E'''" is the [[electric field]] vector with units of volts per meter (analogous to "V" of Ohm's law which has units of volts), "'''J'''" is the [[current density]] vector with units of amperes per unit area (analogous to "I" of Ohm's law which has units of amperes), and "ρ" (Greek "rho") is the [[resistivity]] with units of ohm·meters (analogous to "R" of Ohm's law which has units of ohms).  The above equation is sometimes written&lt;ref&gt;Seymour J, ''Physical Electronics'', Pitman, 1972, pp 53–54&lt;/ref&gt; as '''J''' = &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;'''E''' where "σ" (Greek "sigma") is the [[electrical conductivity|conductivity]] which is the reciprocal of ρ.

[[File:Ohms law vectors.svg|thumb|290px|Current flowing through a uniform cylindrical conductor (such as a round wire) with a uniform field applied.]]
The voltage between two points is defined as:&lt;ref&gt;Lerner L, ''Physics for scientists and engineers'', Jones &amp; Bartlett, 1997, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Nv5GAyAdijoC&amp;pg=PA685 pp. 685–686]&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;{\Delta V} = -\int {\mathbf E \cdot d \mathbf l} &lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;d \mathbf l&lt;/math&gt; the element of path along the integration of electric field vector '''E'''. If the applied '''E''' field is uniform and oriented along the length of the conductor as shown in the figure, then defining the voltage V in the usual convention of being opposite in direction to the field (see figure), and with the understanding that the voltage V is measured differentially across the length of the conductor allowing us to drop the Δ symbol, the above vector equation reduces to the scalar equation:

:&lt;math&gt;V = {E}{l}  \ \  \text{or} \ \ E = \frac{V}{l}. &lt;/math&gt;

Since the '''E''' field is uniform in the direction of wire length, for a conductor having uniformly consistent resistivity ρ, the current density '''J''' will also be uniform in any cross-sectional area and oriented in the direction of wire length, so we may write:&lt;ref name=lerner732&gt;Lerner L, ''Physics for scientists and engineers'', Jones &amp; Bartlett, 1997, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Nv5GAyAdijoC&amp;pg=PA732 pp. 732–733]&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; J = \frac{I}{a}.&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting the above 2 results (for ''E'' and ''J'' respectively) into the continuum form shown at the beginning of this section:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{V}{l} = \frac{I}{a}\rho \qquad \text{or} \qquad V = I \rho \frac{l}{a}.&lt;/math&gt;

The [[electrical resistance]] of a uniform conductor is given in terms of [[resistivity]] by:&lt;ref name=lerner732/&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;{R} = \rho \frac{l}{a} &lt;/math&gt;
where ''l'' is the length of the conductor in [[International System of Units|SI]] units of meters, ''a'' is the cross-sectional area (for a round wire ''a'' = ''πr''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; if ''r'' is radius) in units of meters squared, and ρ is the resistivity in units of ohm·meters.

After substitution of ''R'' from the above equation into the equation preceding it, the continuum form of Ohm's law for a uniform field (and uniform current density) oriented along the length of the conductor reduces to the more familiar form:
:&lt;math&gt;{V}={I}{R}. \ &lt;/math&gt;

A perfect crystal lattice, with low enough thermal motion and no deviations from periodic structure, would have no [[resistivity]],&lt;ref&gt;Seymour J, ''Physical Electronics'', pp 48–49, Pitman, 1972&lt;/ref&gt; but a real metal has [[crystallographic defect]]s, impurities, multiple [[isotope]]s, and thermal motion of the atoms. Electrons [[scattering|scatter]] from all of these, resulting in resistance to their flow.

The more complex generalized forms of Ohm's law are important to [[condensed matter physics]], which studies the properties of [[matter]] and, in particular, its [[electronic structure]]. In broad terms, they fall under the topic of [[constitutive equations]] and the theory of [[Green–Kubo relations|transport coefficients]].

===Magnetic effects===
If an external '''B'''-field is present and the conductor is not at rest but moving at velocity '''v''', then an extra term must be added to account for the current induced by the [[Lorentz force]] on the charge carriers.
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J} = \sigma (\mathbf{E} + \mathbf{v}\times\mathbf{B})&lt;/math&gt;

In the [[rest frame]] of the moving conductor this term drops out because '''v'''= 0. There is no contradiction because the electric field in the rest frame differs from the '''E'''-field in the lab frame: '''E′'''  = '''E''' + '''v'''×'''B'''.
Electric and magnetic fields are relative, see [[Lorentz transformation]].

If the current '''J''' is alternating because the applied voltage or '''E'''-field varies in time, then reactance must be added to resistance to account for self-inductance, see [[electrical impedance]]. The reactance may be strong if the frequency is high or the conductor is coiled.

===Conductive fluids===
In a conductive fluid, such as a [[plasma (physics)|plasma]], there is a similar effect. Consider a fluid moving with the velocity &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt; in a magnetic field &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{B}&lt;/math&gt;. The relative motion induces an electric field &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{E}&lt;/math&gt; which exerts [[electric force]] on the charged particles giving rise to an [[electric current]] &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{J}&lt;/math&gt;. The equation of motion for the electron gas, with a [[number density]] &lt;math&gt;n_e&lt;/math&gt;, is written as

:&lt;math&gt; m_en_e{d\mathbf{v}_e\over dt}=-n_e e \mathbf{E}+ n_e m_e \nu (v_i-v_e)-en_e\mathbf{v}_e\times \mathbf{B}, &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;m_e&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}_e&lt;/math&gt; are the charge, mass and velocity of the electrons, respectively. Also, &lt;math&gt;\nu&lt;/math&gt; is the frequency of collisions of the electrons with ions which have a velocity field &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}_i&lt;/math&gt;. Since, the electron has a very small mass compared with that of ions, we can ignore the left hand side of the above equation to write

:&lt;math&gt; \sigma(\mathbf{E}+\mathbf{v}\times \mathbf{B})=\mathbf{J}, &lt;/math&gt;

where we have used the definition of the [[current density]], and also put &lt;math&gt;\sigma={n_e e^2\over \nu m_e}&lt;/math&gt; which is the [[electrical conductivity]]. This equation can also be equivalently written as

: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{E}+\mathbf{v}\times \mathbf{B}=\rho\mathbf{J}, &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\rho=\sigma^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[electrical resistivity]]. It is also common to write &lt;math&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; instead of &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; which can be confusing since it is the same notation used for the magnetic diffusivity defined as &lt;math&gt;\eta=1/\mu_0\sigma&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30346">Dr Robert Brill is in the field of archaeological science, best known for his work on the chemical analysis of ancient [[glass]]. Born in the United States of America in 1929, Brill attended West Side High School in Newark, New Jersey, before going on to study for his B.S. degree at Upsala College, also New Jersey (Brill 1993a, Brill 2006, Getty Conservation Institute 2009). Having completed his Ph.D in Physical Chemistry at [[Rutgers University]] in 1954, Brill was to return to Upsala College to teach chemistry himself until 1960 when he joined the staff of the [[Corning Museum of Glass]] as their second research scientist (Corning Museum of Glass, 2009)

Throughout his lengthy career at Corning, where a four-year directorship punctuated his time as a research scientist, Brill was a forerunner in the scientific investigation of glass, glazes and colorants, developing and challenging the usefulness of emerging techniques. His pioneering work with the application of lead and oxygen [[isotope analysis]] in archaeology led him occasionally to add the investigation of metal objects to his portfolio so that, together, his published works number more than 160 (Brill and Wampler 1967). Perhaps the most famous of these is his ''Chemical Analyses of Early Glass'', a sum of his 39 years of work and now a seminal reference guide in the field (Brill 1999).

Brill is a strong proponent of interdisciplinary cooperation as well as the collaboration between scientists across the world, and has served since 1982 on the [[International Commission on Glass]]. Within this he founded TC17, the technical committee for the Archaeometry of Glass, which lists among its aims the ‘promotion of collaboration among glass specialists in widely separated countries’ and the stimulation and encouragement of glass scientists ‘in developing countries’  (Archaeometry of Glass 2005). His internationalism is aptly demonstrated by his study of glasses from around the world, with his attentions most recently being focused on those from the Silk Road. Here, as with other areas of Brill's remarkable career, it seems he was attracted by the lack of previous study and the need for further development in the field. Seeing a disparity between contemporary knowledge of glasses from the western world and those from East Asia, Brill was keen to add insight to a hitherto unexploited field and, as such, has gone on to contribute a great deal to Silk Road studies (Brill 1993b).

The broad span of Brill's career allows this paper to provide only an abridged synopsis of his métier and published works to date. Focusing on Brill's achievements during the decades after he joined the Corning Museum in February 1960, it aims to highlight areas in which Brill pioneered new techniques and improved existing ones, offering summaries of major publications and proposing sources the interested reader may turn to for more information (Brill 1999).

==The 1960s==
The 1960s saw Brill beginning to develop the analytical techniques that would define the early years of his career at Corning, and yet the scope of his interest within glass remained vast. Indeed, 1961 saw Brill pen a letter to Nature with a colleague, that was a ‘bombshell’, according to Newton, in the field of glass-dating (1971, 3). Here Brill suggested that the rather enigmatic weathering crust found to form on buried glass objects over time could be used to date the object in a method rather similar to [[dendrochronology]], using the separate layers of the shiny lamination (Brill 1961, Brill and Hood 1961, Newton 1971). Whilst in dendrochronology the tree-rings account simply for the tree's annual growth, in the weathering crust on glass Brill suggested the accumulation of a layer of laminate might respond to some kind of annual event of climatic change (Brill 1961). Unfortunately, despite the examples of the method's successful applications provided by Brill, such as the almost accurate count of 156 layers on a bottle-base from the York River submerged in 1781 and excavated in 1935, the technique largely failed to convince and did not see widespread adoption (Brill 1961, Newton 1971).

===Isotope analysis===
The most important of these techniques would prove to be Brill's pioneering application of lead isotope analysis, hitherto used only in [[geology]], to archaeological objects. Brill first presented this idea at the 1965 Seminar in Examination of Works of Art, held at the Museum of Fine Arts Boston, but the first widely published account of the method seems to be Brill and Wampler's 1967 article in the ''American Journal of Archaeology''. Here, Brill and Wampler outlined how the technique could be used to [[provenance]] the lead contents of archaeological objects to lead ore sources around the world, based on the isotopic signature of various leads, which relates them to ‘ores occurring in different geographical areas’ (1967, 63). These different areas have different signatures because they are of varying geological age, something reflected by the individual lead isotopes which form only after the radioactive decay of [[uranium]] and [[thorium]] (Brill et al. 1965, Brill and Wampler 1967). While the lead isotope ratios used for provenancing are different, they are not unique: areas geologically similar will yield similar lead isotope signatures (Brill 1970). Furthermore, if leads were salvaged and mixed in ancient times, the isotope ratio will be compromised (Brill 1970). Aside from these two limitations, there is little else that could affect the lead isotope reading an object would yield. As such, Brill's method was greeted enthusiastically and he went on to develop the technique, as well as oxygen isotope analysis, in his 1970 publication. Here he demonstrated how the technique could be used both to classify early glasses and to a certain extent characterize the ingredients from which they were made (1970, 143).

===Chemical-analytical round robin===
Returning to 1965, this year saw Brill launch another important innovation in glass analysis, the comparison of interlaboratory experiments in order to verify analytical results (Brill 1965). ‘Originally inspired by a plea from W E S Turner’, according to Freestone, Brill first mooted his idea at the ''VIIth International Congress on Glass'', in Brussels (Brill 1965a, I. Freestone, ''pers. comm.'' 2009). It wasn’t until the ''VIIIth International Congress on Glass'' in 1968, however, that Brill fully launched his concept of an ‘analytical [[round robin test|round robin]]’, having distributed a number of reference glasses to be tested in different laboratories using a range of current techniques including [[X-ray fluorescence]] and [[neutron activation analysis]] (1968, 49). When discussing his motive for the experiment, Brill aptly stated: 'The truth is that the chemical analysis of glasses is a difficult undertaking and still remains in some senses an art' (1968, 49). By conducting the round robin experiment, Brill hoped the results gathered from different laboratories would help ‘correlate [...] earlier results’ and ‘[[calibrate]] future analyses in reference to one another’, as well as suggest which out of the analytical procedures used was the most accurate and effective (1968, 49). The results of the round robin were presented at the 'IXth International Congress on Glass' in 1971, and showed that, as Brill suspected, there was poor agreement between certain identified elements, and therefore these might be ‘troublesome’ generally across analyses (1971, 97). These included calcium, aluminium, lead and barium, among others (Brill 1971). Aside from their correctional potential, the results, from 45 different laboratories in 15 countries, also provided an enormous data set from which, Brill suggested, the participants could ‘evaluate their own methods and procedures against the findings of other analysts’ (1971, 97). At the time, Brill could hardly have suspected that the data would go on to have such great import, but Croegaard's generation of preferred glass compositions, from statistical analysis of the data, were used successfully by many people until Brill's own reference guide was published in 1999 (I. Freestone, 'pers. comm.', 2009).

===The Middle East===
It should not be thought that Brill spent the entire decade ensconced in the Corning laboratory; he made various forays to the Middle East, including accompanying Wertime's 1968 survey of the ancient technologies of Iran, alongside other great minds such as the noted ceramicist, Frederick Matson (UCL Institute for Archaeo-Metallurgical Studies 2007). In the years 1963-1964, the Corning Museum of Glass and the University of Missouri, following a long history of excavation at the necropolis of Beth She'Arim, conducted an examination of a huge slab of glass, some 2000 years old, that had been languishing in an ancient cistern (Brill and Wosinski 1965). Brill cannot recall who first suggested this slab, measuring 3.4m by 1.94m, could be made of glass, but the only way to test it was to drill a core through its 45&amp;nbsp;cm thickness and analyse it (Brill 1967, Brill and Wosinski 1965). On analysis of the core, Brill found that the glass was devitrified and stained, and not very homogenous, with a presence of wollastonite crystals throughout (1965, 219.2). Investigation of the manufacture technology required to produce the slab, suggested that in order to produce such a slab of glass, it would have been necessary to heat over eleven tons of batch material, and sustain it at around 1050˚C for between five and ten days (Brill 1967)! His initial interpretation was that the glass must have been heated either from above or from the sides using a kind of tank furnace; a hypothesis that was proven accurate when excavation underneath the slab suggested it had been melted ''in situ'', in a tank whose floor was a bed of limestone blocks with a thin parting layer of clay (Brill and Wosinski 1965, Brill 1967). Brill's interpretation, that the slab and its surroundings suggest ‘some early form of [[reverberatory furnace]]’ was the first suggestion of the use of tank furnaces in early glassmaking (1967, 92). The evidence at Beth She’arim encouraged further innovative thought because whilst the slab represented glass production on a grand scale, no associated evidence for glass working was found. Brill had already suspected that historical glassmaking occurred in two phases, the heavy ‘engineering’ stage when the glass is formed from the batch ingredients and the ‘crafting’ stage when the glass is formed into artefacts (Brill, pers. comm., 2009). These stages could occur in combination at one location, or at two differing locales, and the time span of production after the initial glass melt is highly flexible. For Brill, the idea of this ‘dual nature of all glassmaking’ was ‘crystallized’ at Beth She’Arim, where only the raw glass production was represented, and would be reinforced later by the contrasting evidence, where working was favoured over production, found at Jalame, as discussed below (Brill, pers. comm., 2009).

==The 1970s==
Aside from the aforementioned published results of his analytical round robin and his lead and oxygen isotope studies in the early 1970s, the decade saw Brill publish comparatively little, perhaps due to his post as director at The Corning Museum of Glass. Those publications he did pen are largely concerned with the development of lead isotope analysis and are listed in the further reading section. Alas, before Brill could be named Director, however, the museum was to be blighted by an enormous flood, ‘possibly the greatest single catastrophe borne by an American museum’ according to Buechner, Brill's successor in 1976 (1977, 7).

===The Corning flood===
The flood was brought to Corning by [[Hurricane Agnes]], a tropical storm that filled the Chemung River system to bursting until, on the morning of June 23, 1972, the river breached its banks and decimated the town (Martin and Edwards 1977). The Corning Glass Centre was under around twenty feet of water on the lower level's west side, while the museum itself was filled to a water-level of five feet and four inches (Martin and Edwards 1977). 528 of the museum's objects were damaged, the library's rare books were ruined and paper index systems, data and catalogues were all lost (Martin and Edwards 1977). In the wake of this destruction, Brill was named Director, so that his time holding this position, from 1972-1975, would be spent overseeing the complete restoration of the museum. Buechner praises how Brill 'painstakingly' prepared the insurance claim that would support the museum throughout the renovation process and facilitate the replacement of many wonderful objects (1977, 7). Under Brill's auspices, the Corning Museum of Glass was reopened just thirty-nine days after the event, on the 1st August, but it would be another four years before the collection and library were restored to their former glory (Buechner 1977).

==The 1980s==
In 1982, Brill joined the International Commission on Glass, ‘the world’s leading organization of glass scientists and technologists’ according to the Corning Museum (2009). The International Commission functions through various technical committees, among which Brill saw an opening for TC17, the committee for the Archaeometry of Glass, which he founded shortly after joining. The main purpose of TC17, whose members met for the first time in Beijing in 1984, is ‘to bring together glass scientists, archaeologists and museum curators to present and discuss the results of research on early glass and glassmaking and on the conservation of historical glass objects’, as expressed in their mission statement (Archaeometry of Glass 2005). Brill was to chair this committee until 2004 and received the W E S Turner Award from the International Commission of Glass on his departure, in recognition of his contribution as founder (Corning Museum of Glass 2009).

===Jalame===
One of the on-running projects of the Corning Museum of Glass published the excavation report from their many field seasons at the ancient glass factory in Jalame, in Late Roman Palestine (Brill 1988, Schreurs and Brill 1984). Brill was called upon to conduct scientific investigations of the huge amount of material generated at the site, in order to exploit the full potential of the artefacts; after all, the site was being excavated specifically because of its role as a glass factory (Brill 1988). Of the vast quantity of glass fragments from Jalame, both vessel sherds and [[cullet]], most were aqua and green and all were soda-lime-silica glasses melted in highly [[Redox|reducing]] conditions (Schreurs and Brill 1984). Where the melting conditions had been increasingly reducing, a ferri-sulfide [[chromophore]] complex was shown to have formed, thus changing the bluey-aqua colour of the glass to an olive, or even an amber shade (Schreurs and Brill 1984). Despite these colour variations, Brill's further chemical analysis showed the vessel glasses to be highly homogeneous in composition, apart from a clear divide where around 40 glasses demonstrated the intentional addition of [[manganese]] (Brill 1988). Brill conducted an investigation of the furnace at Jalame, nicknamed the Red Room, in which there was a mysterious absence of glass finds of any kind (Brill 1988). Whilst work at Beth She’Arim had eventually found there to be five firing chambers responsible for heating the one tank, the fragmentary remains at Jalame made it very difficult to interpret the furnace set-up, apart from the fact that they believed there to have been only one firing chamber (Brill 1988).

===The Institute of Nautical Archaeology===
In the late eighties Brill was to contribute various studies to the Institute of Nautical Archaeology, following the excavation of a number of exciting shipwrecks including the ''Serçe Liman'', and the ''Ulu Burun'' (Barnes et al. 1986, Brill 1989). Here Brill's own technique of lead isotope analysis was to provide a means for provenancing items aboard ship, and thus determine the ship's origin and her ports-of-call. The excavators of the ''Serçe Liman'' wanted to know whether she was [[Byzantine]] or Islamic, a complicated question for lead isotope analysis as the lead ores of the Eastern Mediterranean share geographical characteristics and therefore overlap (Barnes et al. 1986). Using 900 lead net sinkers divided into six loose groupings, Brill found groups III, V and VI to be Byzantine, that is with ores found in modern-day Turkey (Barnes et al. 1986). Group I, however, was taken to be most indicative of the ship's origin; this group contained net sinkers, but also two ceramic glazes and three glass vessels, all sharing virtually identical lead ores with only one isotopic match, ‘an ore from Anguran, northwest of [[Tehran]]’ according to Barnes et al. (1986, 7).

===The origins of Silk Road research===
Brill's submissions to the ''XIVth International Congress on Glass'', which took place in [[New Delhi]] in 1986, can be seen to represent the origins of his work on the Great Silk Road, the impressive trade route carrying goods from the East through India to Europe. Here, chemical analysis of Early Indian glasses would help Brill not just to determine the ingredients and techniques of production, but ‘to make certain broad generalizations as to regions or periods of manufacture’, and therefore to follow an object's movement along the trade route (1987, 1). For the XIVth Congress, Brill conducted [[atomic absorption spectroscopy]] (AAS) and optical emission spectroscopy (OES) on samples of 38 glasses from India, and the success of his method was made clear when he was able to separate 21 samples away from those made in the Middle East and Europe (Brill 1987). Here the glasses were shown to have mixed alkali compositions, a feature that is ‘rare among glasses from more westerly sources’, and therefore Brill concluded that they had definitely been manufactured in India (1987, 4). Brill also collaborated with Mckinnon to conduct chemical analyses of some glass samples from [[Sumatra]], Indonesia, the results of which would be the ‘first data of their kind from this island’ (1987, 1). The results of the study, which also used samples from Java, another important location for the Silk Road, were hoped by McKinnon and Brill to ‘stimulate a greater awareness of glass in the economy [...] of ancient Sumatra and further new lines of research in the archaeology of the region’ (1987, 1).

==The 1990s==
The beginning of the 1990s saw Brill accorded the Archaeological Institute of America's Pomerance Award for scientific contributions to archaeology; however the decade mostly reflects Brill's continuing dedication to Asian glasses and the study of the Silk Road (Archaeological Institute of America 2009). In ''Scientific Research in Early Chinese Glass'', Brill reflected that in comparison to the knowledge of glassmaking in the West, ‘little is known about Chinese glass and about the role it played in the overall unfolding of glass history on a worldwide basis’ (1991, vii). One reason for this is that glass was never produced in the East in such great quantities as it was in the West but also that archaeological Chinese glasses are often prone to problems (Brill 1991). The difficulties of analysing Chinese glasses were reflected later in the publication where, following the chemical investigation of 71 samples, Brill found that identifying the ‘basic formulation’, or ‘any of the primary batch materials’ of the glasses was still almost impossible (Brill et al. 1991). Brill had greater success in differentiating between Chinese glass samples when using lead isotope analysis, a method that has proven effective in the first instance of identifying Chinese glass as the leads used here are different from those anywhere else in the world (Brill, Barnes et al. 1991). Brill found his Chinese samples to fall into two distinct groups, possessing on one hand the highest, and on the other the lowest, lead isotope ratios he had ''ever'' encountered (Brill, Barnes et al. 1991). As such, he was able to show that despite the striking similarity in the glasses’  chemical composition and appearance, the ores from which their leads were sourced must have been from very geologically-different mines (Brill, Barnes et al. 1991).

Brill conducted further investigations of ancient Asian glasses for the Nara Symposium on the Silk Road's maritime route in 1991, ‘to demonstrate [...] that chemical analyses can be useful for learning how glass was traded along the Desert, Steppe, and Maritime Routes of the Silk Road’ (1993a, 71), as well as providing a more technical discussion on glass and glassmaking in China for the Glass Art Society's Toledo Conference in 1993 (Brill 1993b). Further lead isotope analysis, this time on Chinese and central Asian pigments, was conducted with a larger team for the Getty's Conservation of Ancient Sites on the Silk Road, which saw Brill et al. launching studies that held incredible potential for understanding ‘chronological or stylistic differences among Buddhist cave paintings’, or ‘distinguish[ing] between original and repainted parts of individual works’ (1993, 371).

===''Chemical Analyses of Early Glasses''===
In 1999, Brill published the sum of 39 years worth of results from his chemical investigations at Corning in two volumes of reference material with a third forthcoming (Brill 1999). Brill was reluctant to publish the data without any accompanying interpretation, but he felt that the most important factor was to quickly release the material into a wider sphere, made ‘readily accessible to the scientific community’ (1999, 8). Of Corning's 10,000 research artefacts, the master catalogue contains 6,400 samples, an abbreviated catalogue, or AbbCat, of which is presented in the two volumes (1999, 11). Nineteen geographical, typological or chronological categories of glass samples are recorded, spanning Brill's various research projects and collaborations, from Egypt to the East (Brill 1999). It also records the results of oxygen isotope analyses, reminding us that Brill was ever one for the integration of different investigative methods.

==Brill's legacy==
Since 2000, Dr Brill's interest in Silk Road studies and ancient glass compositions has continued, but his publication rate has slowed somewhat. His years of prolific publication, however, and his willingness to analyse glass from almost every situation have provided the archaeometry of glass with a bounty of reference material, as reflected by the ''Chemical Analyses of Early Glasses''.  Despite his official retirement from the Corning Museum of Glass on May 31, 2008, he returned to the laboratory the next day and continues to work, showing no intention of enjoying a retirement proper any time soon (Brill, ''pers. comm.'', 2009).

'''SMS hubbing''' is a new{{When|date=April 2018}} structure for the international flow of [[SMS]] between operators, reshaping the way that international mobile inter-operability works by implementing hubs to intermediate the SMS traffic and to offer a larger SMS coverage. 

The [[GSM Association]] (GSMA) found in SMS Hubbing the solution to a problem that limits the continuing growth of international SMS, culminating to the development of the SMS Hubbing trials in 2006, part of the Open Connectivity project. This initiative created a new structure for international SMS interoperability, as well as developed standards and requirements that SMS hubs should follow.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gsma.com/newsroom/wp-content/uploads/2012/12/IR7520.pdf Open Connectivity SMS Hubbing Architecture]&lt;/ref&gt;

Regardless of the maturity of the operator or number of subscribers, each subscriber expects to be able to send an SMS to other subscribers, regardless of country and mobile network.

The lack of complete international SMS interoperability is caused by the way the GSM world is interconnected: each operator has a need to establish SMS interworking with all other mobile operators, meaning that international SMS can only transit from one operator to another if there is a bi-lateral roaming agreement in place.

While SMS interoperability is limited to bi-lateral interworking / roaming agreements between operators, it is unlikely that full international SMS reach will be achieved by setting up more and more agreements, which are time consuming and costly to put in place. In addition to that, the revenue benefits of an extra interworking connection might not justify the investment required to set it up in the first place.

SMS hubbing enables a broad international SMS coverage for mobile operators (“client operators”) through the connection to independent hubs, who have multiple agreements in place with other operators, therefore being able to route messages on behalf of the client operators.

SMS Hubbing works with the same concept of voice connectivity model: rather than relying on costly and multiple individual agreements, voice traffic flows via telehouses, which are basically hubs for voice. In the same way, many operators connect to hubs to transit MMS messages, in an attempt to fix the many interoperability problems with this messaging technology. SMS Hubbing is about simplifying the SMS interworking system, by replacing much of the unproductive, identical investments in international agreements made traditionally by mobile operators. As well as this, SMS Hubbing is about providing a higher level of service to SMS, by introducing end-to-end quality of service through [[Service level agreement|Service Level Agreements]] [[Service level agreement|(SLAs)]].

It is clear that SMS Hubbing does not replace bilateral agreements. Every operator has the need to establish roaming agreements in order to provide subscribers with the possibility to roam outside their home network. Outside this frame of main roaming agreements that generate the majority of international traffic for voice and messaging, it makes sense for mobile operators to allocate SMS traffic that belongs to non-connected destinations to an SMS hub.

==Benefits==
With the SMS Hubbing model, an operator looking to increase their international SMS coverage does not need to manage multiple bi-lateral agreements. Mobile operators can simplify this by connecting to a hub. The SMS Hubbing model reduces complexity for operators, as well the cost for SMS interworking agreements. Mobile subscribers also take advantage of an enlarged SMS reach, being able to send and receive message to all countries and networks.

'''Ubiquity and simplicity in increasing SMS coverage'''

SMS Hubbing allows operators to manage a single legal, technical and billing relationship rather than hundreds of additional roaming agreements for SMS messaging only.

Mobile operators have been gradually outsourcing non-core functions to invest on areas that need a closer management of the operator, as well as focusing on areas that have a direct interface to customers. The hub concept follows this trend, removing a costly and complex area of technical interface and replacing it with a more efficient and effective outsourced solution.

==Business model==
Under the GSMA’s SMS Hubbing structure, a hub will negotiate a transit fee with an originating operator on a per-SMS basis for the use of the hub. As is the usual practice, the originating operator will also pay a termination fee to the terminating operator, also on a per-SMS basis.

==Other types of hubbing==
Beyond SMS, hubbing can be applied in different areas, such as MMS. Because of many interoperability problems, many operators generally connect to an MMS hub, which route the messages more efficiently on behalf of the operator.

The '''''Australasia''''' was a wooden hulled steamship that sank on October 18, 1896 in [[Lake Michigan]] near the town of [[Sevastopol, Wisconsin|Sevastopol]], Door County, Wisconsin, United States, after burning off [[Cana Island]]. On July 3, 2013 the wreck of the ''Australasia'' was added to the [[National Register of Historic Places in Door County, Wisconsin|National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref name="nps.gov"&gt;{{cite web |title = Australasia Shipwreck (Wooden Bulk Carrier) |url = http://www.nps.gov/nr/feature/places/13000466.htm |work = Features |publisher = [[National Park Service]] |access-date = November 16, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Thomsen |first = Tamara |title = Australasia Shipwreck (Wooden Bulk Carrier) |url = http://www.nps.gov/history/nr/feature/places/pdfs/13000466.pdf |type = National Register of Historic Places registration form |publisher = National Park Service |access-date = November 16, 2013 |first2 = Keith |last2 = Meverden }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The ''Australasia'' (Official number 106302) was built in 1884 in [[West Bay City, Michigan]] by the shipyard owned by Captain James Davidson. She was built for the Davidson Steamship Company which was also owned by Captain Davidson. At a length of {{convert|285|ft|m}} the ''Australasia'' was one of the [[List of longest wooden ships|largest wooden ships ever built]]; her beam was {{convert|39|ft|m}} wide and her cargo hold was {{convert|21.2|ft|m}} deep. She was powered by a [[Compound steam engine|fore and aft compound engine]] which was fueled by two coal burning [[Scotch marine boiler]]s. [[File:Australasia ship.png|thumb|left|Stern view of the ''Australasia'' at an ore dock]] She had a [[gross register tonnage]] of 1829.32 tons and a [[net register tonnage]] of 1539.20 tons.&lt;ref name="Great Lakes Vessel History"&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.greatlakesvesselhistory.com/histories-by-name/a/australasia/ |title = Australasia |work = Great Lakes Vessel Histories of Sterling Berry |access-date = March 9, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 17, 1884 the ''Australasia'' was launched as hull number #9.&lt;ref name="Wrecksite"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://wrecksite.eu/wreck.aspx?159314 |title=SS Australasia (+1896) |work=Wrecksite |accessdate=13 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Great Lakes Vessel History"/&gt; At the time of her launch the ''Australasia'' was the largest wooden hulled ship in the world.&lt;ref name="Wisconsin Shipwrecks"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.wisconsinshipwrecks.org/Vessel/Details/47?region=Index |title = Service History |work = Wisconsin Shipwrecks |access-date = March 10, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of her enormous size the ''Australasia'' needed iron cross bracing, an iron [[keelson]], iron plates, and several iron arches to increase her strength.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.nps.gov/nr/feature/places/13000466.htm |title = National Register of Historic Places Program |publisher = National Park Service |access-date = March 10, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn-ua|James Davidson was a well-known builder of wooden ships. While most companies started to build ships with steel hulls, Davidson kept building wooden ships and pushed the boundaries of wooden boat technology. Because of this he eventually manufactured some of the largest wooden ships in the world like: the [[SS Appomattox|''Appomattox'']], the [[Frank O'Connor (bulk carrier)|''Frank O'Connor'']] and the [[Pretoria (ship)|''Pretoria'']]&lt;ref name="Davidson Shipbuilding"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://wisconsinshipwrecks.org/vessel/Details/218 |title=Davidson Shipbuilding |work=Wisconsin Shipwrecks |accessdate=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group=Note}}

She was used to haul [[bulk cargo]]es such as [[iron ore]], [[coal]], [[grain]] and sometimes [[salt]]. She could carry these cargoes so efficiently that she earned a fortune for her owners at a time when small, less versatile wooden vessels were quickly being replaced by larger, and stronger iron or steel vessels.&lt;ref name="Wisconsin Shipwrecks"/&gt; Just like all ships owned by Captain Davidson, the ''Australasia'' used to tow a wooden schooner barge.&lt;ref name="Wisconsin Shipwrecks"/&gt;

==Final voyage==
On October 17, 1896, the ''Australasia'' was bound from [[Lake Erie]] to [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]], carrying 2,200 tons of [[soft coal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://greatlakes.bgsu.edu/vessel/view/000453 |title = Australasia |publisher = Bowling Green State University |access-date = March 10, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At around 6:00 p.m. near [[Baileys Harbor (CDP), Wisconsin|Baileys Harbor]], the crew of the ''Australasia'' discovered "a fire beneath the [[Texas (steamboat)|texas]] on the main deck". They attempted to fight the blaze but failed. The crew abandoned the ''Australasia'' before she reached [[Jacksonport, Wisconsin]]. At 10:30 p.m., the ''Australasia'' was about four hours off Jacksonport when the [[tugboat]] ''John Leathem'' came upon the struggling steamer. The ''Leathem'' began towing the ''Australasia'' to shore, but the [[Hawser|hawser]] connecting them kept burning through. At 9:00 a.m. on October 18, 1896, the crew of the ''Leathem'' gave up trying to salvage her and instead dragged her onto the beach in {{convert|15|ft|m}} of water south of Cave Point.&lt;ref name="Final Voyage"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.wisconsinshipwrecks.org/Vessel/Details/47?region=Index |title = Final Voyage |work = Wisconsin Shipwrecks |access-date = March 10, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Her crew decided to scuttle her; they did this by ramming a hole in the ''Australasia''&amp;apos;s side with the ''Leathem''&amp;apos;s stem.&lt;ref name="Final Voyage"/&gt; She was left heading north by northwest. She burned until the night of October 18, 1896.&lt;ref name="Final Voyage"/&gt;

==The ''Australasia'' today==
[[File:Australasia (steamer).png|thumb|left|The ''Australasia'' in Fort William, Ontario]]
The ''Australasia'' was declared a total loss. Much of her cargo of soft coal and machinery was salvaged, however her hull was beyond repair and was abandoned.&lt;ref name="Today"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.wisconsinshipwrecks.org/Vessel/Details/47?region=Index |title = Today |work = Wisconsin Shipwrecks |access-date = March 10, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Today her lower hull lies mostly buried in sand 15 to 20 feet of water off [[Whitefish Dunes State Park]].&lt;ref name="nps.gov"/&gt; Because most of her hull remains buried in sand, there is the possibility that different hull sections may be uncovered which may reveal more significant information about her construction.&lt;ref name="nps.gov"/&gt; Not a trace of her cargo is visible on the site of her wreck, but traces of coal is visible on a beach nearby.&lt;ref name="Today"/&gt; The wreck of the ''Australasia'' is rarely visited by divers which means that very little site disturbance to the site has occurred.&lt;ref name="Today"/&gt; Close by are the wrecks of several other ships including the early steel freighter [[SS Lakeland|''Lakeland'']], the large wooden bulk carrier [[Frank O'Connor (bulk carrier)|''Frank O'Connor]], the wooden steamer [[SS Louisiana|''Louisiana'']] which was lost during the [[Great Lakes Storm of 1913]], the schooner [[Christina Nilsson (shipwreck)|''Christina Nilsson'']] and the steamboat [[Joys (shipwreck)|''Joys'']].

The '''Scottish Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament''' (Scottish CND) is the Scottish representative body of the [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]] (CND). The Scottish CND campaigns for the abolition of British nuclear weapons to contribute to the global elimination of all nuclear weapons.

==History==
The organisation was founded in 1958, at the same time that the CND was founded, and was one of the core aspects of a CND revival during the 1970s.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

===Scottish independence affiliation===
On 17 November 2012, as part of a long history of supporting the [[Scottish independence]] movement,&lt;ref name="Committee2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Great Britain: Parliament: House of Commons: Defence Committee|title=The future of the UK's strategic nuclear deterrent: the White Paper, ninth report of session 2006–07, Vol. 2: Oral and written evidence|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XKMfYAUzOWgC&amp;pg=PA167|date=7 March 2007|publisher=The Stationery Office|isbn=978-0-215-03280-5|pages=167–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scottish CND's Annual Conference passed a resolution, stating:
 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Conference urges all members to give priority to the campaign for a 'YES vote' in the 2014 Independence Referendum which will give the Scottish Government a mandate to negotiate a written constitution with a clause on No Nuclear Weapons in Scotland. Conference resolves that SCND affiliates to and promotes the “Yes” Campaign as the most immediate and effective way of getting rid of Trident.&lt;ref name="Yes"&gt;{{cite web|title=Scottish CND registers as campaigner for Yes vote|url=http://www.banthebomb.org/index.php/news/trident/1563-scottish-cnd-registers-as-campaigner-for-yes-vote|website=Scottish Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament|publisher=Scottish Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament|accessdate=13 June 2014|date=20 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During May 2014, the Electoral Commission registered the organisation as a campaigning participant for a "Yes" vote in the September 2014 independence referendum and Chair Arthur West said that the registration process was a display of transparency regarding the CND's involvement with the campaign, further explaining: "This decision was taken because our purpose as an organisation is to promote nuclear disarmament and we believe that independence offers the best opportunity for this."&lt;ref name="Yes" /&gt; 

==Organisation==
The Scottish CND's office is in the city of [[Glasgow]], and is the base for protest organising for cities such as Glasgow, [[Edinburgh]] and Faslane. As of June 2014, the Chair of the organisation is Arthur West, while the Co-ordinator is John Ainslie and the Assistant Co-ordinator is Flavia Tudoreanu.&lt;ref name="About"&gt;{{cite web|title=About SCND|url=http://www.banthebomb.org/index.php/about-scnd/about-cnd|website=Scottish Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament|publisher=Scottish Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament|accessdate=13 June 2014|date=June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organisation has released numerous written resources to support its cause, including an April 2014 leaflet and poster, entitled "No Nuclear Weapons Here". The front of the leaflet reads "Scotland no place for nuclear weapons" underneath the title, while the back of the leaflet explains the situation in the UK, stating "Nuclear disarmament begins at home". The Scottish CND also provides people with the option to order free anti-nuclear stickers that are written in English, Scots and [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]] languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nae Nuclear|url=http://www.banthebomb.org/index.php/publications/leaflets/1549-nae-nuclear|website=Scottish Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament|publisher=Scottish Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament|accessdate=13 June 2014|date=17 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=No nuclear weapons here|url=http://www.banthebomb.org/images/stories/pdfs/NoplaceA3.pdf|website=Scottish Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament|publisher=Scottish Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament|accessdate=13 June 2014|format=PDF|date=April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Back"&gt;{{cite web|title=Nuclear disarmament begins at home|url=http://www.banthebomb.org/images/stories/pdfs/Noplaceleafletback4.pdf|website=Scottish Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament|publisher=Scottish Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament|accessdate=13 June 2014|format=PDF|date=April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview of nuclear weapon issue==
The [[HMNB Clyde|Her Majesty's Naval Base Clyde]] lies on the eastern coast of Scotland, 40 km (25 mi) west of Glasgow in the Faslane area. A nuclear submarine fleet is based at the site,&lt;ref name="Rob" /&gt; facilitated by Prime Minister Clement Attlee's authorisation of a British nuclear weapons programme in 1947. A 1958 agreement between the UK and the United States (US) was followed by a 1962 US agreement, whereby it provided information about its submarine-launched missile system, "[[UGM-27 Polaris|Polaris]]". The UK's first Polaris submarine, [[HMS Resolution (S22)|HMS Resolution]], was launched in 1968 and the entire system was modified in the early 1970s to the British "[[Chevaline]]" system.&lt;ref name="Pole"&gt;{{cite web|title=Nuclear Deterrence|url=http://www.politics.co.uk/reference/nuclear-deterrence|website=''Politics.co.uk''|publisher=Politics.co.uk|accessdate=13 June 2014|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Then, in 1980, the Thatcher Government purchased the new "[[Trident (missile)|Trident]]" missile system from the US to replace Chevaline and this was finalised in 1996.&lt;ref name="Pole" /&gt; Submarines carrying Trident nuclear warheads are based at HMNB Clyde and the [[Scottish National Party]] affirmed that it would remove the submarines if independence was gained following the 2014 referendum. While experts suggested that the submarines could be relocated to a Devonport base in the English city of [[Plymouth]], the Scottish CND advocates for the complete abolishment of the Trident warheads.&lt;ref name="Rob"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Rob Edwards|title=MoD: Trident submarines cannot be moved from Scotland to Plymouth|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/jan/04/mod-nuclear-submarines-scotland-plymouth|accessdate=13 June 2014|work=The Guardian|agency=Guardian News and Media Limited|date=4 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2013, the Scottish CND released a report in which it stated that a much greater population would be put at risk if the weapons were transferred to Devonport. The report claimed that, in the event of an accident at Devonport, an estimated 800 people would be killed by leaking plutonium, while as many as 11,000 people could die from radiation poisoning If the weather was calm. Ainslie further explained to the media that an accident would mean "a large proportion of the city would be abandoned for hundreds of years." A Ministry of Defence spokesperson responded to the discussion and report in January 2013, by stating:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
We are therefore not making plans to move the nuclear deterrent from HM Naval Base Clyde, which supports 6,700 jobs, and where all of our submarines will be based from 2017 ... The government is committed to maintaining a continuous submarine-based nuclear deterrent and has begun the work of replacing our existing submarines.&lt;ref name="Rob" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In campaign material released in April 2014, the Scottish CND explained that "All British nuclear weapons are in Scotland" and "a total of 120 nuclear warheads on Trident submarines" are based at the HMNB Clyde in Faslane.&lt;ref name="Back" /&gt;

==Benefit events==
Following the release of the ''Love'' album in 1987, Scottish band [[Aztec Camera]] was invited to perform at a benefit concert for the Scottish CND in the late 1980s. Frame explained in a television interview prior to the concert that he was merely the entertainment and would not deliver any speeches.&lt;ref name="Party"&gt;{{cite web|title=Roddy Frame/Aztec Camera on the Garden Party (with Richard Jobson)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xjTwFHyGCQQ|website=bisonrav on YouTube|publisher=Google Inc|accessdate=9 June 2014|format=Video upload|date=7 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Solar Cookers International''' ('''SCI''') is a U.S.-based non-profit [[advocacy group]] in [[Sacramento, California]], founded by a group of people in 1987 and incorporated on January 6, 1988.&lt;ref name=corp&gt;"[http://kepler.sos.ca.gov/ Solar Cookers International] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150315010639/http://kepler.sos.ca.gov/ |date=2015-03-15 }}". ''Business Entity Search''. California Secretary of State.

==Recognition==
Solar Cookers International won an [[Ashden Award]] in 2002 for their work with solar cookers in [[Kenya]]. In August 2006, '''SCI''' was the winner of the World Renewable Energy Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reiaward.com|title=Renewable Energy Awards 2018|website=www.reiaward.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Solar Cookers International was founded in 1987 as Solar Box Cookers International. Two American women described as American's serious solar cooker promoters in the 1970s, Barbara Kerr and Sherry Cole partnered with other supporters to form this organization.&lt;ref name="CNN 2009-Apr-09"&gt;{{ cite web | title = Inventor turns cardboard boxes into eco-friendly oven | date = 2009-04-09 | url = http://edition.cnn.com/2009/TECH/04/09/solar.oven.global.warming/index.html | publisher = CNN International | accessdate = 2009-11-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

SCI produced and distributed manuals describing construction and use of solar box style cookers. They became advocates of how solar cooking could be incorporated into development and relief agency programs. SCI's role evolved into networking with other solar cooking organizations worldwide. They hosted forums for dialog including co-sponsoring three international solar cooking conferences with the [[University of the Pacific (United States)|University of the Pacific]], US, in 1992, the [[National University of Costa Rica]] in 1994 and the [[deemed university]], Coimbatore, India in 1997.&lt;ref name="SCI:History"&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=http://www.solarcookers.org/about/history.html| publisher=Solar Cookers International| accessdate=2009-11-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

SCI also administered a series of solar cooking field projects. Since 1995, SCI has managed or co-managed solar cooking projects in the [[Districts of Kenya|Nyakach]] district, [[Kenya]]; in the [[Kakuma|Kakuma refugee camp]], Kenya; in the Aisha refugee camp, [[Ethiopia]]; in various communities, [[Zimbabwe]]; and in [[Dadaab]] refugee camp, Kenya.

SCI supported the development of the CooKit, a mass-producible, foldable solar cooker in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Simple Panel Cooker that Feeds Tens of Thousands Daily|url=http://toolsofsurvival.com/blog/the-simple-panel-cooker-that-feeds-tens-of-thousands-daily/|accessdate=25 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Programs and projects ==

When removed from the water, if the wax has melted and moved to the bottom of the tube (as in the tube on the right), then the water has reached pasteurization temperature during heating]]

SCI was instrumental in the formation of the Solar Cookers International Network, which is an association of approximately 500 non-governmental organizations and government agencies, manufacturers, and individuals promoting solar cooking throughout the world. The Solar Cookers International Network wiki&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://solarcooking.org|title=Solar Cooking|website=solarcooking.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; includes over 1700 articles categorized by country, individual, NGO, manufacturer, and solar cooker designs. Also included is information regarding related technologies such as heat-retention cooking, water [[pasteurization]], solar [[food processing]], solar [[food drying]], solar [[autoclave|autoclaving]], and solar [[canning]]. The Network maintains a [[wiki]]-based website] that allows the network members to share information and experiences at http://solarcooking.org.

SCI has hosted regional and international solar cooking conferences, most recently the Solar Cookers International Conference held in Granada Spain in 2006. SCI publishes ''Solar Cooker Review'' three times a year.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

=== CooKit ===

SCI developed the ''CooKit'' as an adaptation of a cooker designed by Dr. Roger Bernard in France. The cooker consists of a foil-lined cardboard reflector with a dark pot inside a plastic bag. This simple mechanism converts hundreds of watts of sunlight into heat and can cook one or two pots of food at a time.

SCI has set up local production of this cooker in Nairobi, Kenya and in Sacramento, California. The CooKit is used in many solar cooking projects around the world.

Cardboard, aluminium foil, and plastic bags for well over 10,000 solar cookers have been donated to the Iridimi Refugee Camp and Touloum Refugee Camps in [[Chad]] by the combined efforts of the [[Jewish World Watch]], the Dutch foundation [[KoZon]], and SCI. The refugees construct the cookers themselves, using the donated supplies and locally purchased [[Arabic gum]],&lt;ref name="CNN.com"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2007/TECH/09/12/solar.darfur/index.html?iref=mpstoryview |title=Solar lifeline saves Darfur women | publisher = CNN.com |accessdate=2008-03-06 |format= |work= | date=September 17, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and use them for midday and evening meals. The goal of this project was to reduce the [[Darfur]]i women's need to leave the relative safety of the camp to gather firewood, which exposed them to a high risk of being beaten, raped, kidnapped, or murdered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.journaltimes.com/nucleus/index.php?itemid=12999|title=Sides, Phyllis.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4695">[[File:Steeringdamper.JPG|thumb|Transverse linear motorcycle steering damper (centre foreground)]]
A '''steering damper''', or '''steering stabiliser''' is a [[Shock absorber|damping]] device designed to inhibit an undesirable, uncontrolled movement or oscillation of a vehicle steering mechanism, a phenomenon known in motorcycling as [[Bicycle and motorcycle dynamics#Wobble or shimmy|wobble]].

==On motorcycles==
[[Sport bike]]s have a short wheelbase and an aggressive [[Bicycle_and_motorcycle_geometry#Steering_axis_angle|steering geometry]] to provide the ability to make very quick changes in direction.  This has the harmful side-effect of making the bike less stable, more prone to feedback from uneven road surfaces, and more difficult to control.&lt;ref name=HondaHESD&gt;[http://world.honda.com/motorcycle-technology/hesd/p1.html Honda Electronic Steering Damper] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071222191239/http://world.honda.com/motorcycle-technology/hesd/p1.html |date=2007-12-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  If the front wheel significantly deviates from the direction of travel when it touches down, it may cause an unwanted wobble. Steering dampers are  factory installed on some high-end sport motorcycles and fitted to most contemporary racing bikes to counter these behaviours.
Steering dampers are also mounted to [[Types_of_motorcycle#Off-road|off-road motorcycles]] such as motocross bikes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tmxnews.co.uk/content_database/two_of_the_best_from_honda/index.html Two of the best from Honda]&lt;/ref&gt; A damper helps keep the bike tracking straight over difficult terrain such as ruts, rocks, and sand, and also smooths out jolts through the handlebars at the end of jumps.  They also reduce arm fatigue by reducing the effort to control the handlebars.
[[File:Central steering damper.jpg|thumb|Rotary motorcycle steering damper (centre left)]]
On motorcycles, one end of the damper is mounted to the steering yoke or [[triple tree]], the other to the frame. Two main types are linear and rotary.  Linear dampers resemble a telescoping [[shock absorber]] and operate in a similar manner.  They can be aligned either longitudinally and to one side of the steering, or transversely across the bike.  Rotary dampers resemble small boxes and operate via a rotating pivot.  They are mounted coaxially with the steering axis and are typically located on top of the [[Head tube|steering head]]. An electronically variable damper uses a rotary damper with [[hydraulic fluid]] that flows freely at low speeds, allowing easy turning, while restricting flow at higher speeds when more damping is necessary, as determined by the [[engine control unit]].&lt;ref name=HondaHESD/&gt;

For [[Motorcycle|motorcycles]] with sidecars, especially for [[Motorcycle|motorcycles]] which have been retrofitted with a sidecar and where the front wheel geometry, or trail, has not been adjusted for use with a sidecar, a steering damper is beneficial. This prevents low speed wobble which may occur in the lower speed range of about 13 to 20 mph. In older motorcycles adjustable friction dampers had been routinely installed. Hydraulically operated steering dampers may be retrofitted. In some jurisdictions, the installation and operation of a steering damper must be inspected by an expert or examiner and must be entered in the vehicle papers.&lt;ref&gt;Bundesverband der Motorradfahrer e.V., Fourth Edition, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thewordunscrambler.com/word/DAMPER|title=Damper|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Thewordunscrambler|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==On bicycles==

Steering dampers have been available for [[Bicycle|bicycles]] as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

A '''System Basis Chip (SBC)''' is an [[integrated circuit]] that includes various functions of automotive [[electronic control unit]]s (ECU) on a single die.&lt;ref&gt;W Chen et al., "Experiences and challenges of CAN transceivers in upintegrated system basis chips", iCC, Dallas, TX, 2005, https://can-cia.org/fileadmin/resources/documents/proceedings/2005_chen.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robert Bosch (Hrsg): Autoelektrik Autoelektronik. 5. Auflage. Vieweg &amp; Sohn Verlag, Wiesbaden 2007, {{ISBN|978-3-528-23872-8}} (''in german'')&lt;/ref&gt;

It typically includes a mixture between digital standard functionality like communication bus interfaces and analog or power functionality, denoted as smart power. Therefore SBCs are based on special smart power technology platforms.

The embedded functions may include:
* [[Voltage regulator]]s
* Supervision functions
* Reset generators, 
* Watchdog functions
* Bus interfaces, like [[Local Interconnect Network|LIN]], [[Controller Area Network|CAN]] or others
* Wake-up logic
* Power switches

The complexity range for SBCs starts with rather simple hardwired devices to configurable state-machine controlled devices, e.g. through a [[serial peripheral interface]].

Various major automotive semiconductor manufacturers offer SBCs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8824">'''The Year in Industry''' ('''YinI''') is a UK scheme, which organises [[gap year]] placements for pre-university and undergraduate [[students]].  Each year The Year in Industry places around 750 students in [[engineering]], [[science]], [[information technology|IT]], and [[business]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.learninggrid.co.uk/initiatives/the_year_in_industry/ | accessdate=2007-07-02|title=The Year In Industry}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Year in Industry is run by the [[non-profit organisation|not for shareholder profit]] [[Engineering Development Trust]] and is accredited by the [[Learning Grid]].

Students submit a [[Curriculum vitae]] to The Year in Industry detailing what field they are interested in finding a placement. The Year in Industry then send individual students 'company CV's' in that field. Students can then elect to be put forward for that placement, and may be selected by the company for interview and ultimately the placement. Placements usually last around 12 months, during which in between two and four on-site visits are made by YinI to check up on the student.

==The Scheme==
'''The Year in Industry''' was set up in 1987 in the Bristol area and was originally called Pre-Formation of Undergraduate Engineers (PFUE).  It has placed over 8500 students to date, in 2007 over 250 UK companies were involved in the scheme. The scheme has received a lot of praise from both universities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.admin.cam.ac.uk/news/2006/09/25/studentawardwinnersbegindegreecoursesatcambridge/ |title=Student award winners begin degree courses at Cambridge |date=2006-09-25| work =[[University of Cambridge]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/graduate/story/0,,2104230,00.html |title= Voyage of discovery |date=2007-06-16 | work =[[Guardian Unlimited]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/education/6193025.stm |title=Work experience 'boosts earnings'|date=2006-12-20 | work =[[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Placements usually last around 12 months and start between July and September, depending on the company and students requirements. Applications are free as The Year in Industry no longer charge an administrative fee to students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thestudentroom.co.uk/wiki/Year_in_Industry | accessdate=2015-02-20|title=Year in Industry}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students apply for placements through regional offices with the following process:

*The Student submits an on-line or written application to their chosen Year in Industry regional office.
*The geographically nearest regional office contacts the student to arrange an assessment interview. During the interview the students options are discussed, such as field of placement, and geographical location.
*If the student is accepted onto the scheme The Year in Industry will send them 'company CV's'.
*Students select which placements they would like to be put forward for.
*Companies will then shortlist candidates for interviews, which are held throughout the year.
*If a student is successful in an interview, they are offered a job with the company.&lt;ref name=yini /&gt;

The Year in Industry is run by the non-profit organization Engineering Development Trust,
an independent education charity whose aim is to involve young people in engineering, science and technology. The scheme is also part of the [[Royal Academy of Engineering]]'s ''BEST'' programme, likewise this is aimed at encouraging young people to undertake careers in engineering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etrust.org.uk/about.php | accessdate=2007-07-02|title=About EDT}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[File:yinimap.gif|thumb|right|YinI Regional Structure]] --&gt;
The organisation is split up into twelve regional offices:

*South, incorporating the Year in Industry head office
*South West
*London
*East
*Wales
*East Midlands
*West Midlands
*North West
*Yorkshire
*North
*Scotland
*Northern Ireland

==Contribution to Business Award==
Each year the Year in Industry runs a Contribution to Business award. This is aimed at providing students with the opportunity to demonstrate how they have made a difference to their company through their work placement. The award is open to all placement students, who submit a written application detailing the contributions they have made to their regional YinI office. This is supported by a statement written about the student by their line manager.
Around eight people in each region are short-listed and are then required to give a short presentation to industry figures at the regional open day. The winner from each region then attends a national final to find an overall winner. In 2007 the winner of each regional final won a prize of £500. The overall winner will receive an award of £1000, plus three additional prizes are to be awarded of £500 each for innovation, communication skills and environment.  The event in 2007 was held on Thursday, 6 September at The Royal College of Physicians, Regent's Park, London.&lt;ref name=yini /&gt;

==Leadership course==
Students are expected to attend and ideally complete a [[Chartered Management Institute]] course or equivalent during the year; different regions undertake different courses due to differences in funding. Most regions undertake an 'Introduction to Management' certificate and a 'Certificate in Management', the latter being accredited to NVQ level 3 standard. Teaching comes in the form of residential and one-day-a-month workshops, usually taught by local colleges, totalling around 14 days of tuition.&lt;ref name=yini/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.managers.org.uk/listing_with_description_1.aspx?id=10:66&amp;id=10:60&amp;id=10:7|accessdate=2007-07-02|title=Certificate in Management: CMI |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927024341/http://www.managers.org.uk/listing_with_description_1.aspx?id=10:66&amp;id=10:60&amp;id=10:7 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other regions undertake a smaller [[Institute of Leadership &amp; Management]] Level 3 Certificate in Leadership. This involves around 60 hours of tuition spread over five one-day-a-month workshops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.i-l-m.com/qualifications/specialist/level6.ilm |accessdate=2007-07-02 |title=Level 3 Certificate in Leadership: ILM |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070813070352/http://www.i-l-m.com/qualifications/specialist/level6.ilm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The course is organised by the Year in Industry and is paid for by the companies employing YinI students. Enrollment on this course gives YinI students membership to the [[National Union of Students (United Kingdom)|NUS]].

==Other Elements==
At the end of the year students attend a regional open day. Here they exhibit their work and get the opportunity to talk to industry professionals about their experiences. The judging of the regional Contribution to Business Award also takes places at the open day.

In 2007/8 academic year the Year in Industry launched its 'YinI Combo' placements which allowed students to work for part of the year before travelling.&lt;ref name=yini&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.yini.org.uk |title=YinI Website |accessdate=2007-06-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A voluntary maths course is offered by [[Loughborough University]] Best Maths Team. This course has been specially designed for engineering based students working in industry and aims to improve, and maintain students' maths skills over the course of the placement. The course is completed by the student through a series of distance learning modules and on-line tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://bestmaths.lboro.ac.uk/ |title=Best Maths |accessdate=2007-06-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At this moment in time the Year in Industry placements do not legally entitle participants to student council tax exemptions. Undergraduate students are entitled to the exemption since they remain members of their respective universities for the duration of the gap year, however, pre-university students with deferred entry to university do not qualify as students by council tax law{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}. In the past some appeals with support from the Year in Industry have been successful.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2811">'''Wired communication''' refers to the [[data transmission|transmission of data]] over a [[wire]]-based [[Information communication technology|communication technology]].  Examples include [[Public switched telephone network|telephone networks]], [[cable television]] or [[cable internet|internet access]], and [[fiber-optic communication]]. Also [[waveguide (electromagnetism)]], used for high-power applications, is considered as wired line.  Local telephone networks often form the basis for wired communications that are used by both residential and business customers in the area.  Most of the networks today rely on the use of fiber-optic communication technology as a means of providing clear signaling for both inbound and outbound transmissions.  Fiber optics are capable of accommodating far more signals than the older copper wiring used in generations past, while still maintaining the integrity of the signal over longer distances.

Alternatively, communication technologies that don't rely on wires to transmit information (voice or data) are considered [[wireless]], and are generally considered to have higher latency and lower reliability.

The legal definition of most, if not all, [[wireless]] technologies today or "''apparatus, and services (among other things, the receipt, forwarding, and delivery of communications) incidental to such transmission''" are a  wire communication as defined in the [[Communications act of 1934]] in 47 U.S.C. §153 ¶([https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/47/153#59 59]). This makes everything online today and all [[wireless]] phones a use of wire communications&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=47 U.S.C. §153 ¶59|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/47/153#59|website=Legal Information Institute|accessdate=14 June 2014|ref=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; by law whether a physical connection to  wire is visible or is not. The [[Communications act of 1934]] created the [[Federal Communications Commission]] to replace the [[Federal Radio Commission]]. If there were no real wired communications today, there would be no online and there would be no mobile phones or anything [[wireless]] except [[satellite communications]].{{clarification|date=February 2018}}

In general, wired communications are considered to be the most stable of all types of communications services.  They are relatively impervious to adverse weather conditions when compared to wireless solutions.  With some forms of wired services, the strength and speed of the transmission is superior to other solutions, such as satellite or microwave transmissions.  These characteristics have allowed wired communications to remain  popular, even as wireless solutions have continued to advance.

Description: (1) Personal sampling pump, (2) The cassette and the filter for determining the concentration (in the breathing zone), (3) The cassette and the filter to determine the concentration (under a mask), (4) The sampling line (from the breathing zone), and (5) The sampling line (from the mask).]]
To protect [[Workforce|workers]] from air contaminants employers often used [[respirator]]s. Reliable protection of workers' life and health requires that the effectiveness of the respirator must be consistent with the degree of air pollution. There are respiratory protective equipment RPE (or devices - RPD) of different designs, and their protective properties differ markedly. If employer wish to select the appropriate respirator, he or she need to know in advance what [[Respirator Assigned Protection Factors|level of protection it will provide]].

Initially, the effectiveness of respirators were evaluated with their tests in the laboratories. But detection of cases of excessive exposure of harmful agents on those workers who properly used and maintained approved respirators (with [[HEPA|high efficiency filters]]), has prompted experts to change their opinions.&lt;ref name="Patty-1985" /&gt; In the late 1960s, researchers found that real effectiveness of respirators in the workplaces were significantly lower than during tests in [[Laboratory|laboratories]].

Therefore, since the 1970s, specialists started RPD tests in workplaces (in industrialized countries). The results of these studies showed that the real effectiveness of respirators were much lower, than in the laboratories (in general). Specialists have begun to use the results of workplace testing for developing regulations (governing the selection RPD&lt;ref name="NIOSH-0" /&gt; and organization of their usage) for limits of the safe allowable use of all RPD designs.&lt;ref name="Обзор-2014" /&gt;

== Background ==
[[File:Respirator Certification - As Vital as the Air We Breathe.webm|thumb|A video describing respirator certification]]
The invention of the first personal sampling pump&lt;ref name="Шервуд-1966" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Шервуд-1960" /&gt; (1958) made it possible to simultaneously measure the concentrations of air pollutions outside the respirator mask, and at the same time - pollution of inhaled air (under a facepiece). Comparison of these measurement results show the effectiveness of respiratory protective equipment. But until the 1970s experts mistakenly believed that the protective properties of the respirator under laboratory and in the production conditions are not significantly different. Measuring the effectiveness of respirators under production conditions were not performed; and limits of areas of safe use for different types of respirators were established on the basis of laboratory tests only.

But the results of the first workplace studies have shown that the effectiveness of respirators all designs - is very fickle, and strongly depend on the correctness of their use (continuous use in polluted atmosphere, etc...), and on the leakage of contaminated air under the mask through the gaps between it and the worker's face. It was found that respirators' efficiency in the workplaces were much lower, as compared to laboratory conditions. This has led to revise the boundaries of the application of RPE different designs, and prompted to develop requirements for the organization of their application, fixing them in the national legislation.&lt;ref name="Стандарт-1997" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Стандарт-США-OSHA" /&gt; The results of measurements forced to pay more attention to the [[Hierarchy of hazard control|technical methods of protection]] (sealing, [[Ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]], [[automation]], changing [[technology]], and others.).

If the facepiece of the respirator is tight-fitting one (elastomeric quarter or half masks, filtering facepieces, or full-face masks), efficiency decreases due to leakage of unfiltered air through the gaps between the mask and face. These gaps are formed due to the fact that employees must perform a variety of movements under production circumstances that testers in the lab do not, and the fact that even properly dressed masks may "slip" sometimes.

If respirator facepiece is loosely fitting one (hoods, helmets etc.) polluted air can also enter the breathing zone due to its injection (with moving stream of ambient air, unless it is motionless). But there are no significant drafts in the laboratory during RPD approval tests.

A small number of testers can not simulate all the variety of faces of millions of workers (their shapes and sizes), and about 20 minutes at a certification lab test&lt;ref name="Стандарт-США-NIOSH" /&gt; can not simulate all the variety of movements performed in the millions different workplaces. In addition, testers put on and wear masks more slow and accurate than the workers.

== Published research on the effectiveness of respirators, carried out in the workplaces ==

=== The initial stage ''(1970s - 1980s)'' ===
(1974)&lt;ref name="П1-1974" /&gt; The researchers studied the effectiveness of respirators used by [[miner]]s. Scientists simultaneously measured dust concentrations with the personal samplers and two dust collectors - without mask and in the facepiece. Also, they measured the proportion of time, then the respirators were used by miners. For this purpose, two [[thermistor]] (one in the facepiece, the other on the belt) were used; over-heating PTC with expired air was a sign of wearing a mask. Because convenience of the respirators affect the timeliness of its usage, scientists have studied the opinion of the miners on the use of respirators. A detailed report was published before the publication of the article.&lt;ref name="П1-1974-0" /&gt;

(1974)&lt;ref name="П2-1974" /&gt; The study found that respirators can be a good addition to the effective dedusting [[Ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]]. The authors recommended to carry out [[Physical examination|medical examination]] of workers - in [[employment]] and periodically.

(1975)&lt;ref name="П-1975" /&gt; Experts measured the concentration of [[dust]] under respiratory protective devices of workers-[[Abrasive blasting|sandblasters]], and outside - but not simultaneously. The measurement results showed that exposure to air pollution on employees exceeds the [[Permissible exposure limit|permissible value]], and that the supply of clean air into the hood reduces adverse effects. Also, measurements have shown that there may be excessive exposure to workers during breaks (when the respirator may be withdrawn); and discovered the fault of some respirators. Authors recommended: to organize the correct application of RPD, to reduce the concentration of dust in the air, and apply the abrasive material with a lower [[Quartz|silica]] content.

(1976)&lt;ref name="П-1976" /&gt; The concentrations of [[sulfur dioxide]] were measured under the negative pressure filtering respirator with elastomeric half mask, and in the breathing zone (simultaneously); and the results were used to calculate the respirator protection factors PF (such as the concentration ratio, ambient to in-facepiece). Experts analyzed the results of only those measurements, during which the masks were not removed. They found a positive relationship between a comfortableness of respirators, and their effectiveness, as the workers tightened the straps of harness at the convenient masks much stronger.

(1979)&lt;ref name="СО-1979" /&gt; Efficiency of [[Self-contained breathing apparatus|self contained breathing apparatus]] (SCBA) [[Mine Safety Appliances|MSA]] has been studied when they were used by [[firefighter]]s. This SCBA had had air supply into the mask with "on demand" mode (with negative pressure under the mask during [[inhalation]]). Evaluation of the effectiveness of the respirator was conducted by determining the content of [[carboxyhemoglobin]] in the [[blood]] immediately after the cessation of fire extinguishing. [[Carboxyhemoglobin]] formed due to inhalation of [[carbon monoxide]]. The [[biomonitoring]] results shown: (1) the intermittently usage of these respirators makes it totally ineffective; (2) even in continuous usage of such breathing apparatus does not provide effective protection. The results of this study (and other similar studies) led to restrict the use of respirators with fresh air supply "on demand"; and to prohibit their use in fighting fires. US and EU legislation obliges to use only self-contained breathing apparatus with "pressure-demand" mode of air supply (it provide positive pressure under the mask during inhalation) in extinguishing fires.

(1980)&lt;ref name="П1-1980" /&gt; Evaluating the effectiveness of RPE was performed with [[biomonitoring]]. Researchers measured a [[styrene]] concentration in the expired air and in the [[urine]]. Since the [[Absorption (skin)|absorption]] of styrene through skin was small, respirators were able to provide reliable protection of workers.

(1980)&lt;ref name="П2-1980" /&gt; This study clearly showed that using respirators result (exposure to harmful substances on workers) is highly dependent on the organization of their application, and on training of the workers: 
Employees use a respirator several times. The average protection factor of the respirator in one of the workers (who always used a respirator in a timely and accurately), proved to be 26 times greater than that of all other workers.
The authors have raised the question of the need to describe the effectiveness of the respirator using different terms. One term - for cases of timely application of the respirator, and the other - for use with interruptions (for description the real protection of employees).

(1983)&lt;ref name="П1-1983" /&gt; Employees used a respirator with forced air supply to the facepiece; expected protection factor = 1000 (and more). But measured protection factors were considerably lower: 4.5 - 62 times. This disparity has prompted experts to conduct additional research to discover the causes of differenses.&lt;ref name="П2-1983" /&gt;

(1983)&lt;ref name="П2-1983" /&gt; Employees used a respirator ([[Powered air-purifying respirator|PAPR]]): air flow 184 l/min, the degree of air purification with filters 99.97%. But they are often discovered climbing of its face shield, and the minimum protection factors reaches 1.1, 1.2 ... . Some of respirators do not provide a snug fit to the face of the faces. Measurement results showed that the rest in the room with a clean air greatly reduces the impact of air pollution on the workers, and that respirators alone can not reliably protect them. It was also found that the calculation of the protection factors may give different results for different chemicals (for the same measurement carried out).

(1984)&lt;ref name="П1-1984" /&gt; Measured respirators' protection factors were very unstable. Scientists have proposed to establish the boundaries of the safe use of respirators based on the results obtained not in the laboratories, but in the workplaces, under application without interruption. This principle, with some variations, is used in developed countries today. Experts proposed to establish the [[Respirator Assigned Protection Factors|expected protection factors]] so that the real effectiveness was greater than the expected effectiveness with a probability of 90% and in 95% of cases. The authors analyzed the results, and offered to reduce the permissible usage limits of the half-mask respirators with forced air supply ([[Powered air-purifying respirator|PAPR]]) from 500 to 50 PEL.

(1984)&lt;ref name="П2-1984" /&gt; Experts have studied the effectiveness of half mask respirators, used by employees with and without a beard under the exposure of coarse dust. The hair on the faces of the staff did not lead to a decrease in the effectiveness of respirators. This result can be explained by the fact that the dust was large, and it passes through the gap only partially. All Western manuals require workers shave face when using respirators with tight-fitting facepieces.
[[File:Коэффициенты защиты PAPR en.jpg|thumb|400px|Protection Factors of [[Powered air-purifying respirator|Powered Air-Purifying Respirator (PAPR)]] with loose-fitting facepiece (hood or helmet).&lt;ref name="П3-1984" /&gt;&lt;ref name="П3-1986" /&gt; Result: Assigned PF was lowered from 1000 to 25 PEL (USA); and for 40 OEL (UK)]]

(1984)&lt;ref name="П3-1984" /&gt; This study was the third study (&lt;ref name="П2-1983" /&gt;&lt;ref name="П1-1984" /&gt;), which showed low efficiency respirators ([[Powered air-purifying respirator|Powered air-purifying respirator with loose-fitting facepiece, hood or helmet]]), which consistently provides reliable protection in the laboratory (PF&gt;1000). The minimum protection factor of respirators, applied continuously, were as follows: for the 3M model - 28, and for the Racal model - 42.

A significant difference between the real and laboratory efficiency prompted the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH) released in 1982 two informational messages on respirators, warning consumers about the low effectiveness of RPD of the type that is expected to provide reliable protection.&lt;ref name="NIOSH-1987" /&gt; The experts were alarmed: they do not understand why (after the supplying more than 115 liters of clean air per minute under the facepiece) there are a lot of pollution in the inhaled air.

* The results of these investigations led to a decrease of the [[Respirator Assigned Protection Factors|expected (assigned) protection factor (APF)]] of such respirators 40-fold, from 1000 to 25 (US). The authors said that the study of one of the tested respirator models in the [[wind tunnel]] has been found reduction of the protection factor up to 17 at an air speed of 2&amp;nbsp;m/s airflow in certain directions.&lt;ref name="Cecala-1981" /&gt;

This study showed that laboratory tests can not be used as a reliable indicator of the effectiveness of respiratory protective equipment. Authors are encouraged to use the results of measurements of respirators' protection factors in the workplaces (with continuous use) to develop reasonable restrictions for different types of respiratory protective equipment.

* Research efficiency in the workplace led to develop a special terminology to adequately describe the effectiveness of respirators. 
Public discussion of the proposed terms were carried out in 1982-1986.&lt;ref name="ПП-1982" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ПП-1983-1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ПП-1983-2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ПП-1985" /&gt; As a result of this discussion, the experts gave definitions for the six respirator protection factors that can be measured in different conditions in the workplaces and in the laboratories.
These definitions began to be used officially,&lt;ref name="NIOSH-0" /&gt; as well as in the preparation of articles about the trials of respirators.&lt;ref name="ПП-1986" /&gt;

For example, the assigned protection factor (APF), is the minimum PF, which RPD (of this type) must ensure if: the respirator will be used by trained and taught workers, after [[Respirator fit test|individual selection masks to face an employee]]; if it is to be used without interruption in the polluted atmosphere - in most cases (but not in all cases).
The experts recommended to develop APF values based on measurements of the protection factors in the workplace, or in considering the values of APF of similar respirators' types.

* They found that if the protection factors are not stable, the average efficiency is strongly dependent on smaller values:&lt;ref name="ПП-1997" /&gt; If the same worker used respirator twice, and if the protection factor was 230,000 in the first case, and the protection factor was 19 in the second (example values from&lt;ref name="П-2003" /&gt;), the average protection factor was only 38. (Penetrations in the first and second cases are 5.26% and 0%, respectively; and the average penetration is equal to 2.63%). Medium PF is strongly dependent on the minimum values.

Other workers&lt;ref name="П-2003" /&gt; also meet very strong volatility of efficiency (for example, the protection factor of 51 000 and 13 for the same worker).

The initial stage of research yielded the following results: experts developed a common terminology to describe the protective properties of the respirators; a methodology for measuring protection factors in different conditions of respirators' usage in the workplaces and laboratories; and the realization that national legislation should set limits for the use of all types of respirators based on their performance, measured not in the laboratory, but in the workplaces. The first studies also clearly confirmed that the use of respirators is [[Hierarchy of hazard control|the most unreliable method of protecting workers]] from all known methods. Therefore, respirators should be used only when other methods can not be used; or when other methods can not reduce the exposure of air pollution on people to an acceptable safe level.

Since the effectiveness of respirators may vary depending on different circumstances related to the organization of their application, the RPE should be used as part of a respiratory protection program (a complex of measures aimed at eliminating the causes which may reduce the effectiveness of respiratory protection).

=== Further studies ===
(1984)&lt;ref name="П4-1984" /&gt; Workers used disposable half-mask respirators, that protected them from the [[Mercury (element)|mercury vapor]] in the enterprise, produces [[chlorine]]. Range of measured protection factors - from 9 to 63. Perhaps the real effectiveness of respirators differ from measured - but take into account the deposition of harmful substances in the respiratory tract was too difficult.

(1984)&lt;ref name="П5-1984" /&gt; The study describes the measurement of the effectiveness of half-mask respirators, which has been used to protect against [[lead]] aerosols.

(1985)&lt;ref name="П1-1985" /&gt; Report of the exhibition and conference.&lt;ref name="AIHCE" /&gt; The researchers presented their measurements of efficiency of respirators that have been used to protect against [[asbestos]] during [[Asbestos abatement|removal of insulation and fire-retardant ceiling]].

(1986)&lt;ref name="П1-1986" /&gt; The researchers studied the effectiveness of respirators and at the same time - the efficiency of the workers protection (by [[biomonitoring]]). They found a correlation between the respirator protection factors and lead concentrations in the blood. The authors noted that the violation of [[Hygiene|personal hygiene]] can lead to the entry into the body large amounts of lead (despite the use of effective respirators in the workplace).

(1986)&lt;ref name="П2-1986" /&gt; Respirators used for the protection of [[Solvent|organic solvent]] vapors. In order to assess their effectiveness, the researchers used passive diffusion monitors. Exposure of pollution on the workers was excessive due to the fact that the masks used in the polluted atmosphere intermittently.

(1986)&lt;ref name="П3-1986" /&gt; Researchers have studied helmets with forced air supply ([[Powered air-purifying respirator|PAPR]]). These respirators protect workers from lead aerosol during [[Lead–acid battery|battery]] production.

(1986)&lt;ref name="П4-1986" /&gt; Report of the exhibition and conference.&lt;ref name="AIHCE" /&gt; The researchers reported the results of measurements of the protective properties of the hood with forced air supply. The respirators were used to protect workers against [[asbestos]] during [[brake]] manufacturing.

(1987)&lt;ref name="П1-1987" /&gt; The researchers studied the effectiveness of the filtering facepieces. They made a mistake: they measured the in-facepiece concentration by weighing, but the dust contains [[cement]]. Dust humidification increased its mass, and drying the in-facepiece filters can not remove moisture. The error was detected; and the planning of new studies in the majority of cases employ the [[Analytical chemistry|chemical analysis]] of collected dust. The specialists began to point to what chemical element the measured protection factors were defined.

(1987)&lt;ref name="П2-1987" /&gt; The author has studied the effectiveness of the protection of workers who removed the old [[paint]]. Employees used a negative pressure filtering respirators with a full face mask; concentration of solvents under the mask was measured using a diffusion monitors. The author said that the high humidity of expired air were not interfere with the measurements.

(1987)&lt;ref name="П3-1987" /&gt; Report of the exhibition and conference.&lt;ref name="AIHCE" /&gt; The report describes the measurement of the effectiveness of respirators that workers used to protect against [[aerosol]]s of [[Aluminium|aluminum]], [[titanium]] and silica during the [[polishing]] and [[Grinding (abrasive cutting)|grinding]].

(1987)&lt;ref name="П4-1987" /&gt; Report of the exhibition and conference.&lt;ref name="AIHCE" /&gt; The report described the measurement of protection factors airline respirator. The workers used RPD to protect against silica at [[shipyard]].

(1989)&lt;ref name="П1-1989" /&gt; The workers used a helmet with forced air supply. This helmet was joined to a waterproof suit with the help of a [[Zipper|zip fastener]]. This made it possible to obtain high protection factors (~ 350), and protect workers securely. The results of researches of the show, in order to ensure reliable protection of people with the help of a respirator, the employer shall pay attention to the organization and use of RPD, and to the planning of the work.

(1989)&lt;ref name="П2-1989" /&gt; Report of the exhibition and conference.&lt;ref name="AIHCE" /&gt; The researchers studied the protective properties of negative pressure respirator with full face masks. These RPE used to protect employees from the lead in the enterprise, which was made this metal.

(1989)&lt;ref name="П3-1989" /&gt; Report of the exhibition and conference.&lt;ref name="AIHCE" /&gt; The researchers studied the protective properties of SARs, which were used for protection against iron and quartz aerosols during abrasive machining of [[Casting (metalworking)|castings]].

[[File:Workplace Protection Factors of full face masks.jpg|thumb|330px|Surprisingly low efficiency of certified negative pressure full face masks forced to tighten limits of areas of their admissible application:&lt;ref name="П1-1990" /&gt; Assigned PF decreaces from 900 to 40 in UK]]

(1990)&lt;ref name="П1-1990" /&gt; Researchers measured protection factors of three models certified negative pressure filtering respirators with full face masks. Surprisingly, the values obtained were much lower than expected; and they are significantly smaller than the values previously obtained in the laboratories. Minimum PF values were: 11; 16; 17; 20; 26 ... (expected PF &gt;900). For one of three models, there are no any measurements, when its protection factor exceeded 500 - et all.

* [[Respirator Assigned Protection Factors|Assigned Protection Factors]] for the respirators of this type have been reduced from 900 to 40 due to this study (in the UK). US restrictions are similar to English: Assigned PF = 50.&lt;ref name="Стандарт-США-OSHA" /&gt;

(1990)&lt;ref name="П2-1990" /&gt; Measurement results showed that the effectiveness of the protection of employees of various specialties (using the same half mask respirators) may be different; and that the effectiveness of one and the same worker may differ by tens of times.

(1990)&lt;ref name="П3-1990" /&gt; Report of the exhibition and conference.&lt;ref name="AIHCE" /&gt; The authors reported respirator protection factor measurements, that were applied for protection from aluminum dust in the production of this metal.

(1990)&lt;ref name="П4-1990" /&gt; Report of the exhibition and conference.&lt;ref name="AIHCE" /&gt; Experts have reported PF of filtering facepiece respirators, used to protect against lead and [[zinc]] in [[brass]] casting.

(1990)&lt;ref name="П5-1990" /&gt; Report of the exhibition and conference.&lt;ref name="AIHCE" /&gt; The researchers studied the protective properties of full face masks with forced air supply ([[Powered air-purifying respirator|PAPR]]). These RPE used to protect employees from the lead in the [[Non-ferrous extractive metallurgy|enterprise, which was made this metal]].

(1990)&lt;ref name="П6-1990" /&gt; Report of the exhibition and conference.&lt;ref name="AIHCE" /&gt; The researchers studied the protective properties of the helmet with forced air supply ([[Powered air-purifying respirator]]). These RPE used to protect employees from the [[steroid]]s in the [[pharmaceutical industry]].

(1991)&lt;ref name="П-1991" /&gt; Measurement of protective properties of half mask respirators showed that they are ineffective, and that their protective properties are significantly higher in the laboratory than in the workplace.

(1992)&lt;ref name="П1-1992" /&gt; The authors made a review of the researches of RPE efficiency in the workplaces. This article shows a significant difference between the real and lab efficiencies, that forced to carry out researches of respirators in the workplaces, and develop adequate terminology. The article also describes the problems when evaluating the protective properties of the high efficiency RPE types: very low pollution of air under the facepiece preventing the accurate analysis; and it is difficult to find a workplace with a sufficiently high concentration of air pollution.

(1992)&lt;ref name="П2-1992" /&gt; Report of the exhibition and conference.&lt;ref name="AIHCE" /&gt; Scientists studied respirators (filtering facepieces), used to protect against [[:wikt:fume|fume]] of [[iron]], [[manganese]], [[titanium]] and [[zinc]] during [[welding]] and [[Abrasion (mechanical)|abrasion]] on the [[shipyard]].

(1993)&lt;ref name="П1-1993" /&gt; The respirators used by workers continuously. The effectiveness of half-mask with forced air supply ([[Powered air-purifying respirator|PAPR]]) is higher than one of negative pressure half-mask.

(1993)&lt;ref name="П2-1993" /&gt; The researchers studied the effectiveness of respirators to protect workers from [[styrene]]. The authors used two methods. They measured the concentrations of styrene under the mask and the outside it (for calculating the protection factor); and they conducted [[biomonitoring]] (determined concentration of phenylglyoxylic acid and [[mandelic acid]] in the [[urine]]). These substances are formed during the decomposition of styrene in humans. The average value of a respirator protection factors (calculated with the measured concentrations) was equal to 4; and the average intake of harmful substance in the body of the worker (measured using biomonitoring) decreased by 3 times. The authors recommended determine the impact of styrene on the workers by biomonitooring.

(1993)&lt;ref name="П3-1993" /&gt; Evaluating the effectiveness of a respirator was done using [[biomonitoring]]. The authors measured the concentrations of [[lead]] and [[zinc protoporphyrin]] in [[blood]]. The lead absorption by the human body increases these concentrations. The respirators usage reduced the lead ingress into the body of the employees. The researchers recommended to show the measurement results to employees to encourage the timely use of respirators, and personal hygiene.

(1993)&lt;ref name="П4-1993" /&gt; The authors studied the filtering facepieces respirators. The researchers found a positive correlation between respirators' protection factors (when RPE used without interruption) and the concentration of pollutants in the ambient air.

(1993)&lt;ref name="П5-1993" /&gt; Report of the exhibition and conference.&lt;ref name="AIHCE" /&gt; The staff dismantled the [[Industrial oven|old oven]]. They used a hose respirators (Supplied Air Respirator, SAR) for protection against quartz aerosol.

(1993-1994)&lt;ref name="П-1993-4" /&gt; Experts have studied the protective properties of the different elastomeric respirators and filtering facepieces. The workers used these respirators in several companies producing paint, [[flame retardant]]s and batteries.

(1994)&lt;ref name="П1-1994" /&gt; Report of the exhibition and conference.&lt;ref name="AIHCE" /&gt; Experts measured protection coefficients of half mask respirators during cutting of old ships. The workers were exposed to the lead aerosol.

(1995)&lt;ref name="П1-1995" /&gt; The author carried out a [[Statistics|statistical analysis]] of the results of all studies of half mask respirator (when they are used without interruption). He concluded that in most cases (it is - all the cases together) protection factors were greater than 10. But the expert did not realize just how fickle the protection coefficients for individual employees, and that the continuous use is not always possible.

(1995)&lt;ref name="П2-1995" /&gt; Research has shown that different types of respirators (quarter masks, half masks and [[Powered air-purifying respirator|PAPR]] with loose-fitting hood) provide a similar (low) degree of protection when its were used intermittently. The researchers interviewed the workers to determine deficiencies of RPE different designs, and gave advice on the selection of respirators for different types of work.

(1996)&lt;ref name="П1-1996" /&gt; [[Ventilation (architecture)|Ventilation]] and use of respirators (without interruption) enables reliably protect workers.

(1996)&lt;ref name="П2-1996" /&gt; Studies have shown that the use of respirators (with technical means of collective protection) provides the desired reduction in the harmful effects on workers.

(1996)&lt;ref name="П3-1996" /&gt; The workers use the hoods with a continuous flow of a clean air under its. They purified the [[bridge]] from old paint. Exposure of lead on the employees exceeds the maximum permissible exposure.

(1996)&lt;ref name="П4-1996" /&gt; This article describes the reasons how [[American National Standards Institute|ANSI]] has limited the use of respirators of different designs ([[Respirator Assigned Protection Factors|Assigned PF]]). To develop values of APF ANSI used: (1) results of the measurements of RPD efficiency in the workplaces; (2) APF of respirators with similar design. Only in the absence of this information, the experts used the measurements of efficiency in the laboratory (than them imitate the real work). 
* Designed restrictions (US&lt;ref name="Стандарт-США-OSHA" /&gt;) are valid only when the respirators are used in the polluted atmosphere without interruptions, but this is not always possible.

(1998)&lt;ref name="П1-1998" /&gt; The workers use respirators with full face masks, air is supplied under a mask forcibly - from the block of filtration and purification. Components of respirators differ from the factory set (workers used the most appropriate mask, comfortable units clean and cheap filters - from different manufacturers). Of the 21 cases, the workers received adequate protection only in eight cases. The minimum protection factor (5) was significantly less than expected from the respirator of this design (1000). The authors recommended the use of working methods that create less dust concentration; train workers; and prohibit the use of RPE with non-approval configuration.

(1998)&lt;ref name="П2-1998" /&gt; The authors studied the respirator protection factors of the same type (half-mask), using different models. The effectiveness of different respirator models can differ significantly.

(1999)&lt;ref name="П1-1999" /&gt; Respirators used to protect workers against [[styrene]]. Scientists also examined the absorption of [[styrene]] through a skin during the study. [[Biomonitoring|Biological monitoring]] has shown that absorption through the skin is small; and respirators affect on the styrene exposure dose greater than the use of [[Personal protective equipment#Protective clothing and ensembles|protective clothing]].

(1999)&lt;ref name="П2-1999" /&gt; The researchers used an original method for measuring full facepiece performance. Determining the concentration of harmful substances under the mask can be very difficult, since the concentration can be very small. To solve this problem, the researchers attached to the mask hood under which supplied test gas ([[sulfur hexafluoride]]). Since workers do not travel long distances, the gas concentration was measured by stationary devices with long tubes. This method allows to accurately measure the gas leakage through the gaps between the mask and the face. They also used the standard EU methodology for determining leakage, which is used for respirator certification.

(2000)&lt;ref name="П1-2000" /&gt; The authors studied the effectiveness of respirators (they measured the styrene concentrations outside the mask, and under the mask); and the real effectiveness of the protection of workers (styrene concentration in the urine). It turned out that the effectiveness of the protection of workers (with impermanent usage of respirators) is significantly lower than the effectiveness of respirators themselves: the people's exposure decreased by only 5-60%, and exceeded the limit.

(2000)&lt;ref name="П2-2000" /&gt; The authors studied the filtering half-mask respirators. The workers used different models: part of respirators had forced supply of air from the cleaning unit, and a part was the usual negative pressure half masks. The results showed that if the workers use respirators intermittently, their efficiency are low, and significantly lower than expected: In the first type respirators 85-91% values of protection factors were lower than expected Assigned PF = 50; and the second type of RPE provide protection factor in 82-89% of cases lower than the expected APF = 10.

(2000)&lt;ref name="П3-2000" /&gt; Respirators field study has shown that the effectiveness of the protection of the shipyard workers from the styrene exposure may also depend on the concentration of pollutant in the dining room air. The use of respirators in the workplace without interruption reliably protect workers.

(2000)&lt;ref name="П4-2000" /&gt; Protection factors of filtering facepieces were measured. Workers used respirators intermittently. Because working conditions were improved (through the use of [[vacuum cleaner]]s instead of dry sweeping the floor, ets), the intermittently usage of the respirators allowed protect workers to the extent necessary.

(2001)&lt;ref name="П1-2001" /&gt; The application the [[Powered air-purifying respirator|Powered Air Purifying Respirator (PAPR)]] allows reliably protect workers during [[Grinding (abrasive cutting)|grinding]]. Measured PF were &gt;1000.

(2001)&lt;ref name="П2-2001" /&gt; Report of the exhibition and conference.&lt;ref name="AIHCE" /&gt; The authors described the measurement of respirators' performance ([[Powered air-purifying respirator|PAPR]] with hood) in the enterprise, is made of [[Nickel–cadmium battery|nickel-cadmium batteries]]. The air was polluted by [[cadmium]].

(2002)&lt;ref name="П1-2002" /&gt; Protection factors of half mask respirators that are not always used (because of high air temperature) have been very low. Half of the PF values were less than 2. The authors recommended to make general [[Ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]]; and use [[Powered air-purifying respirator|PAPR]] (air blowing face may make use of such respirators more acceptable at a high temperature).

(2002)&lt;ref name="П2-2002" /&gt; The authors analyzed the expected values of protection factors and take into account the appearance of a mask during inspiration (at different flow of inhaled air). They found that efficiency of a Supplied Air Respirators (SAR) with a constant air feed mode can be lower than expected, and recommended to reduce Assigned PF from 100 to 40.
* The proposed reduction was carried out in Great Britain.&lt;ref name="ПП-2002" /&gt;

(2002)&lt;ref name="П3-2002" /&gt; Measuring the effectiveness of respirators, [[Respirator fit test|individually chosen for the workers]], showed that they securely protect workers from [[welding]] fumes. The respirators were used without interruption.

(2003)&lt;ref name="П-2003" /&gt; Experts studying how mask fit to the faces of the workers affect on the protection factors of the respirators. Protection Factor - a [[random variable]], which depends on many factors and it is not [[Prediction|predictable]]; however respirator masks that conform to the workers' faces, provide better protection on average. Similar results were also obtained in the laboratories. These results became the basis of the legal requirements: the employer is obliged [[Respirator fit test|to pick up the mask to the face of each employee individually, and to check compliance (with the form and size) with the instruments]]. One of the measurements showed that ordinary low-cost half mask can provide very high protection factor (230,000) sometimes. However, this protection is unreliable: the next measurement in the same working (which used the same mask) showed that the protection factor of only 19. The average value of the protection ratio for these two measurements was ~ 38. Other workers also meet any strong volatility of efficiency (for example, the protection factor of 51 000 and 13 for the same worker).

(2004)&lt;ref name="П1-2004" /&gt; The textbook&lt;ref name="NIOSH-0" /&gt; states that the expected degree of protection is a such quantity, that the respirator will provide for a certain proportion of the workers, and with a certain [[probability]]. However, experts did not have enough results of PF measurements for the same worker repeatedly. Consequently, the [[Respirator Assigned Protection Factors|expected effectiveness]] started (in practice) equal to the lower 95% [[Confidence interval|confidence limit]] of the set values of measurement results. Later, in several studies, PF measurements were repeated to for the same worker, and specialists conducted statistical analysis. Nikas and Neyghauz&lt;ref name = "П1-2004" /&gt; tried to determine - then the expected PF will reliably protect not less than 95% of workers in more than 95% of cases of RPE usage. They took into account the volatility of PF of the individual worker and volatility of the average (mean) PF for the different workers. It turned out that then the expected PF ([[Respirator Assigned Protection Factors|Assigned PF]]) = 10 efficiency respirators will be insufficient, and they are advised to reduce the Assigned PF to 5 for negative pressure half mask.

(2004)&lt;ref name="П2-2004" /&gt; After individual selection masks, checking their [[Respirator fit test|fit to the faces]], and when they are used in a timely manner - the measured effectiveness of the workers protection has not been lower than expected.

[[File:Protection Factors of filtering facepiece, measured in real time during work.jpg|thumb|400px|Protection factors of filtering facepiece respirator, measured in real time. The concentration of dust under the filter half mask is changed dozens of times in a matter of minutes.&lt;ref name="П1-2005" /&gt;]]
(2005)&lt;ref name="П1-2005" /&gt; This article describes a unique portable device. The instrument determines the count concentration of [[aerosol]] particles outside the mask, and under the mask (during operation in real time). This instrument determines the concentration for 5 optical particle diameters ranges separately. The measurement results demonstrated that the effectiveness of the filtering facepiece (under a constant application) were very unstable; and that smaller particles leak under a mask better, than larger ones.

(2005)&lt;ref name="П2-2005" /&gt; Experts measured the protective properties of respirators that are used to protect against inhalation of [[Fungus#Spore dispersal|fungal spores]] and [[bacteria]]. The result showed that the efficiency depends on the type of [[microorganism]].

(2007)&lt;ref name="П1-2007" /&gt; Experts studied the protective properties of full face masks. The measurements showed that the workers were adequately protected. The duration of the measurements was 1–3 hours. In these circumstances, of the 52 measurements, in 2 cases, the workers had removed the mask (because they had something to say to each other) - and these results were not taken into account in the analysis. However, use of respirators intermittently drastically reduces their efficiency. This shows how important to correctly organize the use of respirators, and to provide workers with the [[Wireless intercom|intercom stations]] (if necessary).

(2007)&lt;ref name="П2-2007" /&gt; Respirators' protection factor was measured under the conditions of exposure of workers with [[xylene]] and [[ethylbenzene]] vapors. Also, the team members conducted biomonitoring of exposure. They measured the concentration methylhippuric acid in the urine. Scientists have found a correlation between the concentrations of xylene in air and the concentrations of methylhippuric acid in the urine; and calculated the proportion of [[solvent]] entering the body through the [[lung]]s and through the skin. It turned out that if the respirator protection factors was more than 17-25, more than half of xylene enters to the [[House painter and decorator|painters']] body through unprotected skin. The authors recommended the use of more hygienic methods of painting, since the use of skin protection continuously in hot [[Tropical climate|tropical conditions]] difficult to achieve.

(2007)&lt;ref name="П3-2007" /&gt; The authors of this study repeated [[mathematical model]]ing of the effectiveness of respirators, which had previously performed by Nikas and Neyghauz.&lt;ref name="П1-2004" /&gt; The authors have complicated mathematical model, and take into account the results of new researches. Since the protection factors in the new studies were large, the author got the high anticipated effectiveness of half masks respirators - no less than 10 times.

(2007)&lt;ref name="П4-2007" /&gt; Respirators has been used continuously. The filtering half masks provide the required protection for [[Steel mill|steel plant]] employees.

(2007)&lt;ref name="П5-2007" /&gt; The workers used a high-quality half mask respirators; and they were trained. Mask was selected to employees individually and [[Respirator fit test|their compliance with the face were checked]]. Employees perform sedentary work, the air was contaminated with coarse dust. So, the lowest protection factor (PF=24) was much greater than expected ([[Respirator Assigned Protection Factors|Assigned PF]] = 10). However, these conditions may not be available at other workplaces; and therefore the authors recommended do not change the Assigned PF for half mask respirator.

(2008)&lt;ref name="П-2008" /&gt; [[Powered air-purifying respirator|PAPR]] protect workers securely. In all cases, the concentration of harmful substances (under a mask) was less than the threshold sensitivity of the analysis method used. The authors noted that the tests of high efficiency respirators require workplaces with high polluted air, and these places are hard to find.

(2009)&lt;ref name="П1-2009" /&gt; Workers used high quality masks - on time and correctly. So, in most cases pollution of inhaled air (under a mask) is below the threshold sensitivity of the analysis method used.

(2010)&lt;ref name="П-2010" /&gt; Engineers used a special instrument for the study of respirators.&lt;ref name="П1-2005" /&gt; Results showed that the protection efficiency of particles with a large optical diameter higher than that for particles with smaller optical diameter.

(2012)&lt;ref name="П-2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="П-2014" /&gt; The authors review work described research on the effectiveness of helmets with forced filtered air flow to the organs of respiration (model ''Airstreem''), used in [[Steel mill|metallurgical enterprises]] in England.

(2015)&lt;ref name="П-2015" /&gt; Experts studied the [[Powered air-purifying respirator|PAPR]] performance. Respirators provide reliable protection of workers from the [[nanoparticle]]s.

† - ''Only the published studies. Many studies have been conducted, but they were not published. However, their results were known and used.''

* These studies gave information about the real effectiveness of respiratory protective equipment; of their unreliability, and studies have shown some circumstances affect and may affect the effectiveness of the protection. [[Biomonitoring]] revealed the final result of the use of respirators - real, actual reduction of harmful substances entering the body. The studies have become the basis for the development of national legislation in the developed countries, which governs the selection and organization of the use of respirators by the employer. Specifically, as the lowest values of protection factors of constant wear half mask reaching 1.6 (and reaches 1, when unstable worn), it shall not be used when the air pollution exceeds 10 PEL in the US. And as the lowest values of protection factors of constant wear full face mask reaching 11,&lt;ref name="П1-1990" /&gt; it shall not be used when the air pollution exceeds 40 OEL in the UK.
* The results of measurements RPE efficiency not only in the laboratory but also in real production conditions, allowed to develop evidence-based guidelines for the selection and organization of the use of respirators.&lt;ref name="Стандарт-1997" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Стандарт-США-OSHA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Стандарт-ФРГ" /&gt;

=== Studies of the effectiveness of respiratory protective equipment in coal mining ===
The authors have shown that the average decrease dustiness of inhaled air in [[Coal mining in the United Kingdom|coal mining in the UK]] due to the use of respirators is 41% (1.7 times).&lt;ref name="RP-1981" /&gt; Low efficiency respirators due to the fact that the miners used respirators intermittently or not used at all (in the conditions of effective [[Ventilation (architecture)|ventilation]] and low dust concentration). They can not determine when the dust concentration is more than acceptable, and when it is necessary to use a respirator.

The handbook&lt;ref name="Handbook2003" /&gt; discusses the results of measurements of respirators' performance. The dust concentration was reduced by 92% with the use of half mask respirators while working [[Longwall mining|longwall shearer]]; and decreased three times (in average). Helmet with forced filtering air supply ([[Powered air-purifying respirator|PAPR]]) reduces the concentration of dust in half. The expected decrease in dust concentration of the two types of respirators are 10 and 25 respectively. In subsequent publications of [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] (on the subject of reducing the dust content in underground mining) RPE are not mentioned at all.

The effectiveness of this filtering facepiece was overestimated by orders of magnitude - without justification; for the period 1956 to 2015 the industry produced over 6 billion of respirators.]]

=== The use of filtering facepieces model "Lepestok" during the Chernobyl accident ===
[[File:Médaille Tchernobyl goutte de sang.jpg|thumb|150px|The central detail of the [[Chernobyl liquidators|Liquidators']] medal, with traces of alpha (α) and beta (β) particles and gamma (γ) rays over a drop of blood.]]
Liquidation of consequences of the [[Chernobyl disaster|Chernobyl accident]] required the reliable protection of people from radioactive aerosols. Even a small amount of [[Radioactive contamination|radioactive substances]] can seriously harm human health if it enters into their bodies&lt;ref name="Городинский-1979" /&gt; (because of the small distance from the tissues). 
Aerosol particles deposited in the lungs, can remain there for many years, and it increases the risk of diseases. Eliminating the consequences of the accident were carried out the best experts, including members of the [[Kurchatov Institute]]. Only one of the manufacturers RPD sent to Chernobyl approximately 300,000 negative pressure filtering facepieces model "Lepestok" only in June 1986.&lt;ref name="Лепесток-2015" /&gt; These respirators are considered to be very effective (the declared protection factor of 200 for most common model "Lepestok-200").
 
But the application of this model on a large scale has revealed numerous cases of excessive exposure to air pollution on people. This has led experts to question the high efficiency of the respirator, and it is similar to the events in the US nuclear industry in the late 1960s.&lt;ref name="Patty-1985" /&gt; Doubts were strong; and they are forced to carry out an independent study of the effectiveness in a foreign laboratory.&lt;ref name=Hoover-2001 /&gt; Specialists conducted parallel attempts to identify the reasons for the low efficiency of the respirator in Chernobyl.&lt;ref name="Огородников-2006" /&gt;

The results of research in Chernobyl and in the United States were similar: the filter material is well caught a fine aerosol,&lt;ref name="Конференция-1990-2" /&gt; and created a small resistance to the passage of air through it; but a lot of unfiltered air passes through the gap between the mask and face. Research has shown that one can expect the minimum values of the protection factor 2÷8,&lt;ref name="Конференция-1990-1" /&gt; or even 1.5.&lt;ref name=Hoover-2001 /&gt;

Representatives of the institution in which the model of respirator was developed, given their very original interpretation of the results of independent (foreign) tests: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;... in 20% of cases the protection factor (fit factor) exceeded the declared value (200). ... Consequently, the respirator model provides the declared efficiency.&lt;/blockquote&gt;.
In addition, the respirator designers stated that experts from Kurchatov Institute conducted their measurements "illiterate".&lt;ref name="Огородников-2006" /&gt;

Many cases of excessive exposure to air pollution during operation at the Chernobyl plant did not lead to a change in assessments of the effectiveness of respirators - as happened in the United States before.

== Analysis of the results of measurements of the respirators' performance at workplaces ==
Field measurement results showed that the respirators are the most recent and the [[Hierarchy of hazard control|most unreliable means of protection]].
The effectiveness of respiratory protective equipment is unstable and unpredictable. Respirators cannot substitute other measures, that reduce the impact of air pollution on the staff (sealing equipment, ventilation and so on), but only supplement them. Respirators are not convenient, they create [[Comfort|discomfort]] and [[irritation]], and prevent [[communication#Verbal communication|communication]].&lt;ref name="П1-2007" /&gt; The reduction of the [[field of view]] leads to an increase in the risk of [[accident]]s.

RPE reinforce overheating at a high air temperature.&lt;ref name="П1-2002" /&gt; These and other deficiencies often prevent use of respirators in the polluted atmosphere without interruptions. But if the RPD is not used, it becomes useless.

Workers using respirators partially lose performance. Industrial hygienists know many cases where harmful substances enter the body not through the respiratory system, but in other ways (through skin&lt;ref name="П2-2007" /&gt;). Even the timely use of a respirator may not be sufficient for reliable protection of workers.&lt;ref name="П2-1993" /&gt;

If the respiratory system is the main way of receipt of harmful substances in the body, and if the use of other means of protection does not allow to reduce the impact to an acceptable value, employee must use respirators. They should be selected taking into account their effectiveness (it depends on the respirator type); masks should be chosen for employees personally; and workers should be learned, and trained - in accordance with legal requirements. This reduces the risk of occupational diseases as much as possible.

== Using the results of measurements in the workplaces ==
Comparison of the results of tests of various types of respirators in the laboratories and in the workplaces showed that laboratory tests do not allow to properly assess the real effectiveness of respirators (even if they are applied without interruption). Therefore, legislation in industrialized countries establishes limitations on the use of all types of respirators, taking into account such differences, and taking into account the results of field trials. This field measurements revealed low efficiency of several types of respirators, and forced more strictly limit their use: for negative pressure air-purifying respirators with full face mask and high efficiency filters - from 500 PEL to 50 PEL (USA&lt;ref name="П1-1984" /&gt;), from 900 OEL to 40 OEL (UK&lt;ref name="П1-2002" /&gt;);
for Powered Air-Purifying Respirators with loose-fitting facepiece (hood or helmet) — from 1000 PEL to 25 PEL (USA&lt;ref name="П3-1984" /&gt;), PAPR with half mask — from 500 PEL to 50 PEL (USA&lt;ref name="П1-1984" /&gt;), for supplied Air Respirators with full face mask and continuous air supply mode - from 100 OEL to 40 OEL (UK&lt;ref name="П2-2002" /&gt;); for SCBA and SAR with air supply on demand mode — from 100 PEL to 50 PEL (USA).

The results of numerous field tests and analysis, led to the restriction of application limits of filtering facepieces and negative pressure half mask respirators to 10 PEL in US.&lt;ref name="NIOSH-2004" /&gt;

The significant difference between the real and laboratory efficiency prompted the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health to require the manufacturers of high-performance RPE perform its testing at the adequate workplaces (as a requirement for respirator certification in the United States&lt;ref name = "П1-1992" /&gt;).

Due to the fact that respirators wearing cannot provide a reliable protection, [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] has developed a guide to reduce the dust concentration: in the underground coal mines;&lt;ref name = "Учебник 2010" /&gt; in the other mines;&lt;ref name = "Учебник 2012" /&gt; and other similar documents with specific recommendations.
