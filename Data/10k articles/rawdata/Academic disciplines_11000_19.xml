'''Absorbed dose'''  is a measure of the energy deposited in a medium by ionizing radiation. The unit of measure [[SI derived unit|derived from the SI system]] is the [[Gray (unit)|gray]] (Gy), which is defined as one Joule of energy absorbed per kilogram of matter.{{sfn | ICRP | 2007 | loc=glossary }} Absorbed dose is used in the calculation of dose uptake in living tissue in both [[radiation protection]] (reduction of harmful effects), and [[radiology]] (potential beneficial effects for example in cancer treatment). It is also used to directly compare the effect of radiation on inanimate matter.

The non-SI [[Centimetre–gram–second system of units|CGS]] unit [[rad (unit)|rad]] is sometimes also used, predominantly in the USA.
==Stochastic risk==
[[File:Dose_quantities_and_units.png|thumb|400px|External dose quantities used in radiation protection and dosimetry]]
The quantity absorbed dose is of importance in radiation protection for calculating radiation dose. However, absorbed dose is a physical quantity and used unmodified is not an adequate indicator of the likely health effects in humans. For [[stochastic]] radiation risk (defined as the ''probability'' of cancer induction and genetic effects) consideration must be given to the type of radiation and the sensitivity of the irradiated tissues which requires the use of modifying factors.

To represent stochastic risk the [[equivalent dose]] ''H'' &lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; and [[Effective dose (radiation)|effective dose]] ''E'' are used, and appropriate dose factors and coefficients are used to calculate these from the absorbed dose.{{sfn | ICRP | 2007 | loc= paragraphs 104 and 105 }} Equivalent and effective dose quantities are expressed in units of the [[sievert]] or [[rem (unit)|rem]] which implies that biological effects have been taken into account. The derivation of stochastic risk is in accordance with the recommendations of the [[ICRP|International Committee on Radiation Protection]] (ICRP) and [[International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements]] (ICRU). The coherent system of radiological protection quantities developed by them is shown in the accompanying diagram.

==Deterministic effects==
Conventionally, unmodified absorbed dose is not used for comparing stochastic risks but only for acute dose giving rise to tissue effects, such as in [[acute radiation syndrome]].

===Effects of acute radiation exposure===
{{Whole-body absorbed dose symptom}}

==Radiation therapy==
{{Main|radiation therapy}}
The measurement of absorbed dose in tissue is of fundamental importance in radiobiology  as it is the measure of the amount of energy the incident radiation is imparting to the target tissue.

===Dose Computation===
The absorbed dose is equal to the radiation exposure (ions or [[coulomb|C]]/kg) of the radiation beam multiplied by the ionization energy of the medium to be ionized.

For example, the ionization energy of dry air at 20&amp;nbsp;°C and 101.325&amp;nbsp;[[pascal (unit)|kPa]] of pressure is {{val|33.97|0.06|u=J/C}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Radiation Oncology Physics: A Handbook for Teachers and Students|year=2005|publisher=International Atomic Energy Agency|location=Vienna|isbn=92-0-107304-6|url=http://www-pub.iaea.org/mtcd/publications/pdf/pub1196_web.pdf|editor=Podgorsak, E. B.|accessdate=25 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|305}} (33.97&amp;nbsp;eV per ion pair) Therefore, an exposure of {{val|2.58|e=-4|u=C/kg}} (1 [[roentgen (unit)|roentgen]]) would deposit an absorbed dose of {{val|8.76|e=-3|u=J/kg}} (0.00876&amp;nbsp;Gy or 0.876&amp;nbsp;rad) in dry air at those conditions.

When the absorbed dose is not uniform, or when it is only applied to a portion of a body or object, an absorbed dose representative of the entire item can be calculated by taking a mass-weighted average of the absorbed doses at each point.

More precisely,{{sfn | ICRP | 2007 | p=1 }}

&lt;math&gt;\bar{D_T}=\frac{\int_{T}D(x,y,z)\rho(x,y,z)dV}{\int_{T}\rho(x,y,z)dV}&lt;/math&gt;

Where
:&lt;math&gt;\bar{D_T}&lt;/math&gt;  is the mass-averaged absorbed dose of the entire item T
:&lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;  is the item of interest
:&lt;math&gt;D(x,y,z)&lt;/math&gt;  is the absorbed dose as a function of location
:&lt;math&gt;\rho(x,y,z)&lt;/math&gt;  is the density as a function of location
:&lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;  is volume

===Medical considerations===
Non-uniform absorbed dose is common for soft radiations such as low energy x-rays or beta radiation. Self-shielding means that the absorbed dose will be higher in the tissues facing the source than deeper in the body.

The mass average can be important in evaluating the risks of radiotherapy treatments, since they are designed to target very specific volumes in the body, typically a tumour. For example, if 10% of a patient's bone marrow mass is irradiated with 10&amp;nbsp;Gy of radiation locally, then the absorbed dose in bone marrow overall would be 1&amp;nbsp;Gy. Bone marrow makes up 4% of the body mass, so the whole-body absorbed dose would be 0.04&amp;nbsp;Gy. The first figure (10&amp;nbsp;Gy) is indicative of the local effects on the tumour, while the second and third figure (1&amp;nbsp;Gy and 0.04&amp;nbsp;Gy) are better indicators of the overall health effects on the whole organism. Additional dosimetry calculations would have to be performed on these figures to arrive at a meaningful effective dose, which is needed to estimate the risk of cancer or other stochastic effects.

When ionizing radiation is used to treat cancer, the doctor will usually prescribe the [[radiotherapy]] treatment in units of gray. [[Medical imaging]] doses may be described in units of [[coulomb]] per [[kilogram]], but when [[radiopharmaceutical]]s are used, they will usually be administered in units of [[becquerel]].

==Other uses==
Absorbed dose is also used to manage the irradiation and measure the effects of ionising radiation on inanimate matter in a number of fields.
===Component survivability===
Absorbed dose is used to rate the survivability of devices such as electronic components in ionizing radiation environments.

===Radiation hardening===
The measurement of absorbed dose absorbed by inanimate matter is vital in the process of [[radiation hardening]] which improves the resistance of electronic devices to radiation effects.

===Food irradiation===

Absorbed dose is the physical dose quantity used to ensure [[irradiated food]] has received the correct dose to ensure effectiveness. Variable doses are used depending on the application and can be as high as 70&amp;nbsp;kGy.

==Radiation-related quantities==

[[File:Frederic, Lord Leighton - Perseus and Andromeda - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|''Perseus and Andromeda'' (Andromeda tied to the rock while [[Perseus]] on the winged horse Pegasus flies above), by [[Frederic Leighton]]]]

In [[Greek mythology]], '''Andromeda''' ({{IPAc-en|æ|n|ˈ|d|r|ɒ|m|ɪ|d|ə}}; [[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: Ἀνδρομέδα, ''Androméda'' or Ἀνδρομέδη, ''Andromédē'') is the daughter of the [[Aethiopia]]n king [[Cepheus, King of Aethiopia|Cepheus]] and his wife [[Cassiopeia (Queen of Ethiopia)|Cassiopeia]]. When Cassiopeia's [[hubris]] leads her to boast that Andromeda is more beautiful than the [[Nereids]], [[Poseidon]] sends the [[sea monster]] [[Cetus (mythology)|Cetus]] to ravage Andromeda as divine punishment.&lt;ref&gt;''Who's Who in Classical Mythology'', Michael Grant &amp; John Hazel, Oxford University Press, 1973, 1993, p. 31, {{ISBN|0-19-521030-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Andromeda is chained to a rock as a sacrifice to sate the monster, but is saved from death by [[Perseus]].

Her name is the [[Latin language|Latinized]] form of the Greek {{lang|grc|Ἀνδρομέδα}} (''Androméda'') or {{lang|grc|Ἀνδρομέδη}} (''Andromédē''): "ruler of men",&lt;ref&gt;The traditional [[etymology]] of the name is, "she who has bravery in her mind"&lt;/ref&gt; from {{lang|grc|[[wikt:ἀνήρ|ἀνήρ]], ἀνδρός}} (''anēr, andrós'') "man", and ''medon'', "ruler".

As a subject, Andromeda has been popular in art since classical times; it is one of several Greek myths of a [[Greek hero]]'s rescue of the intended victim of an archaic ''[[hieros gamos]]'' (sacred marriage), giving rise to the "[[princess and dragon]]" [[Motif (narrative)|motif]]. From the [[Renaissance]], interest revived in the original story, typically as derived from [[Ovid]]'s account.

==Mythology==
[[Image:Museo Nazionale Napoli Perseus And Andromeda.jpg|left|thumb|A small Roman fresco from [[Pompeii]]]]

In Greek mythology, Andromeda was the daughter of Cepheus and Cassiopeia, king and queen of the African kingdom of [[Aethiopia (Classical Greek term)|Aethiopia]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=975}}

Her mother Cassiopeia boasted that her daughter was more beautiful than the [[Nereids]], the [[nymph]]-daughters of the sea god [[Nereus]] and often seen accompanying [[Poseidon]]. To punish the queen for her arrogance, Poseidon, brother to [[Zeus]] and god of the sea, sent a sea monster named [[Cetus (mythology)|Cetus]] to ravage the coast of Aethiopia including the kingdom of the vain queen. The desperate king consulted the [[Oracle]] of Apollo, who announced that no respite would be found until the king sacrificed his daughter, Andromeda, to the monster. Stripped naked, she was chained to a rock on the coast.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=975}}

[[Perseus]] was returning from having slain the [[Gorgon]], [[Medusa]]. After he happened upon the chained Andromeda, he approached Cetus while invisible (for he was wearing [[Cap of invisibility#Origins|Hades's helm]]), and killed the sea monster. He set Andromeda free, and married her in spite of her having been previously promised to her uncle [[Phineus (son of Belus)|Phineus]]. At the wedding a quarrel took place between the rivals, and Phineus was turned to stone by the sight of the Gorgon's head.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=975}}&lt;ref&gt;[[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses (poem)|Metamorphoses]]'' v. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Andromeda followed her husband, first to his native island of [[Serifos]], where he rescued his mother [[Danaë]], and then to [[Tiryns]] in [[Argos]]. Together, they became the ancestors of the family of the ''Perseidae'' through the line of their son Perses. Perseus and Andromeda had seven sons: [[Perses (son of Andromeda and Perseus)|Perses]], [[Alcaeus (mythology)|Alcaeus]], [[Heleus]], [[Mestor]], [[Sthenelus (son of Andromeda and Perseus)|Sthenelus]], [[Electryon]], and [[Cynurus]] as well as two daughters, [[Autochthe]] and [[Gorgophone (Perseid)|Gorgophone]]. Their descendants ruled Mycenae from [[Electryon]] down to [[Eurystheus]], after whom [[Atreus]] attained the kingdom, and would also include the great hero [[Heracles]]. According to this mythology, Perseus is the ancestor of the [[Persian people|Persians]].

At the port city of [[Jaffa]] (today part of [[Tel Aviv]]) an outcrop of rocks near the harbour has been associated with the place of Andromeda's chaining and rescue by the traveler [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], the geographer [[Strabo]] and the historian of the Jews [[Josephus]].&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias iv.35.9; Strabo xvi.2.28; Josephus, ''Jewish War'' iii.9.3&lt;/ref&gt;

After Andromeda's death, as [[Euripides]] had promised [[Athena]] at the end of his ''[[Andromeda (play)|Andromeda]]'', produced in 412 BCE,&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Kerenyi]], ''The Heroes of the Greeks'' 1959:53; Euripides' drama is lost, save some fragments.&lt;/ref&gt; the goddess placed her among the [[constellation]]s in the northern sky, near Perseus and [[Cassiopeia (constellation)|Cassiopeia]]; the [[Andromeda (constellation)|constellation Andromeda]], so known since antiquity, is named after her.

== Black Andromeda ==
Andromeda was the daughter of the king and queen of Aethiopia (Αἰθιοπία) modern day [[Ethiopia]] ; Aethiopia roughly translates to "country of burnt faces", so we can conclude Andromeda was black. Prof. Elizabeth McGrath discusses this idea in her 1992 article ''The Black Andromeda'' &lt;ref&gt; Elizabeth McGrath, The Black Andromeda, Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes, Vol. 55 (1992), pp. 1-18&lt;/ref&gt; based on Ovid's writings:

1. In his first work, the [[Heroides]] or Epistulae Heroidum (Epistles of the Heroines), [[Ovid]] uses the Latin word “fusca” to describe Andromeda, and “fusca” means “black or brown,” 

2. Also in ''[[Heroides]]'' he has [[Sappho|Sapho]] explain to [[Phaon]]: “though I’m not pure white, Cepheus’s dark/Andromeda/charmed Perseus with her native colour./White doves often choose mates of different hue/and the parrot loves the black turtle dove.”

3. In ''[[Ars Amatoria]]'' (The Art of Love), [[Ovid]] makes the following references to the daughter of the king and queen of [[Ethiopia]]:

a. That Perseus found her among “the black Indians” 

b. That in terms of attraction, “Nor was Andromeda’s colour any problem/to her wing-footed aerial lover” 

c. That when it came to fashion, “White suits dark girls; you looked so attractive in/white/Andromeda”

[[Henry Louis Gates Jr]] wrote about the black Andromeda in a 2014 article &lt;ref name = The Black Andromeda &gt;[https://www.theroot.com/was-andromeda-black-1790874592 "Henry Louis Gates Jr on ''Was Andromeda Black?''"], The Root.&lt;/ref&gt; for [[The Root]] magazine. In his article Gates points out the inaccuracies seen in the film [[Clash of the Titans (franchise)|Clash of the Titans]]. The original, the remake and the sequel all have Andromeda cast as a white women, when [[Ovid]] describes her as black and both her parents were black. In his book ''Amazing Fact About the Negro'' &lt;ref&gt;Gates, L.H., ''100 Amazing Facts About the Negro'', New York, Pantheon, 2017, isbn=9780307908711&lt;/ref&gt; Gates has at No 68: ''What was the original colour of the mythical beauty Andromeda - and why does it matter?'' The book is his homage to [[Joel Rogers]] ''100 Amazing Facts About The Negro With Complete Proof''.

===Constellations===
[[Image:1869 Edward Poynter - Andromeda.jpg|thumb|200px|''Andromeda'' (1869) [[Edward Poynter]]]]
Andromeda is represented in the northern sky by the [[constellation]] [[Andromeda (constellation)|Andromeda]], which contains the [[Andromeda Galaxy]].

The advancement of science and technology allowed the emergence of astrophotography which allowed more concrete observation of the Andromeda constellation and led to the discovery that the galaxy lies within the Andromeda constellation.&lt;ref&gt;Schultz, David A. The Andromeda Galaxy and the Rise of Modern Astronomy. New York, NY: Springer, 2012. Astronomers' Universe. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

Four constellations are associated with the myth. Viewing the fainter stars visible to the naked eye, the constellations are rendered as:
* A huge man wearing a [[Crown (headgear)|crown]], upside down with respect to the [[ecliptic]] (the constellation [[Cepheus (constellation)|Cepheus]])
* A smaller figure, next to the man, sitting on a chair; as it is near the [[Polaris|pole star]], it may be seen by observers in the Northern Hemisphere through the whole year, although sometimes upside down (the constellation [[Cassiopeia (constellation)|Cassiopeia]])
* A maiden, chained up, facing or turning away from the ecliptic (the constellation [[Andromeda (constellation)|Andromeda]]), next to [[Pegasus (constellation)|Pegasus]]
* A [[whale]] just under the ecliptic (the constellation [[Cetus]])

Other constellations related to the story are:
* [[Perseus (constellation)|Perseus]]
* The constellation [[Pegasus (constellation)|Pegasus]], who was born from the stump of [[Medusa]]'s neck, after Perseus had decapitated her
* The constellation [[Pisces (constellation)|Pisces]], which may have been treated as two fish caught by [[Dictys]] the [[fisherman]] who was brother of [[Polydectes]], king of [[Seriphos]], the place where Perseus and his mother [[Danaë]] were stranded

===In art===
[[File:1596 dArpino Perseus and Andromeda anagoria.JPG|thumb|right|Cesari: ''Perseus saving Andromeda'', 1596, [[Gemäldegalerie, Berlin]]]]
[[Sophocles]] and [[Euripides]] (and in more modern times, [[Pierre Corneille|Corneille]]) made the story the subject of [[tragedies]], and its incidents were represented in numerous ancient works of art,{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=975}} including Greek vases. [[Jean-Baptiste Lully]]'s opera, ''[[Persée]]'', also dramatizes the myth.

Andromeda has been the subject of numerous ancient and modern works of art, which typically show the moment of rescue, with Andromeda usually still chained, and often naked or nearly so. Examples include: one of [[Titian]]'s ''poesies'' ([[Wallace Collection]]), and compositions by [[Joachim Wtewael]] ([[Musée du Louvre|Louvre]]), [[Paolo Veronese|Veronese]] (Rennes), [[Perseus and Andromeda (Rubens)|many versions by Rubens]], [[Ingres]], and [[Gustave Moreau]]. From the [[Renaissance]] onward the chained nude figure of Andromeda typically was the centre of interest.  [[Rembrandt]]'s ''[[Andromeda Chained to the Rocks]]'' is unusual in showing her alone, fearfully awaiting the monster.

If by dull rhymes our English must be chain’d,
 And, like Andromeda, the Sonnet sweet
 Fetter’d, in spite of pained loveliness;
 Let us find out, if we must be constrain’d,
 Sandals more interwoven and complete
 To fit the naked foot of poesy;
 Let us inspect the lyre, and weigh the stress
 Of every chord, and see what may be gain’d
 By ear industrious, and attention meet:
 Misers of sound and syllable, no less
 Than Midas of his coinage, let us be
 Jealous of dead leaves in the bay wreath crown;
 So, if we may not let the Muse be free,
 She will be bound with garlands of her own.

The Italian composer [[Salvatore Sciarrino]] composed an hour-long operatic drama called ''Perseo e Andromeda'' in 2000.

===In films===
* In 1973, an animated film called ''Perseus'' (20 minutes) was made in the [[Soviet Union]] as part of the Soviet animated film collection called ''Legends and Mуths of Ancient Greece''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.animator.ru/db/?p=show_film&amp;fid=2626|title=тПУУЙКУЛБС БОЙНБГЙС Ч ВХЛЧБИ Й ЖЙЗХТБИ - жЙМШНЩ - "ретуек"|work=animator.ru|accessdate=7 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kinopoisk.ru/film/315858/|title=КиноПоиск.ru - Все фильмы планеты|work=kinopoisk.ru|accessdate=7 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The 1981 film ''[[Clash of the Titans (1981 film)|Clash of the Titans]]'' retells the story of Perseus, Andromeda, and Cassiopeia, but makes a few changes (notably Cassiopeia boasts that her daughter is more beautiful than [[Thetis]] as opposed to the Nereids as a group). Thetis was indeed a Nereid and also the future mother of [[Achilles]]. Andromeda and Perseus meet and fall in love after he saves her soul from the enslavement of Thetis' son, Calibos, whereas in the myth, they simply meet as Perseus returns home from having slain [[Medusa]]. In the film, the monster is called a [[kraken]], although it is depicted as a lizard-like creature rather than a squid; and combining two elements of the myth, Perseus defeats the sea monster by showing it Medusa's face, turning the monster into stone. Andromeda is depicted as being strong-willed and independent, whereas in the stories she is only really mentioned as being the princess whom Perseus saves from the sea monster. Andromeda was portrayed by [[Judi Bowker]] in this film.
* Andromeda also features in the 2010 film ''[[Clash of the Titans (2010 film)|Clash of the Titans]]'', a remake of the 1981 version. Several changes were made in regard to the myth, most notably that Perseus did not marry Andromeda after he rescued her from the sea monster. Andromeda was portrayed by [[Alexa Davalos]]. The character was played by [[Rosamund Pike]] in the sequel ''[[Wrath of the Titans]]'', the second of a planned [[Clash of the Titans (franchise)|trilogy]]. In the end of the sequel, Perseus and Andromeda begin a relationship.
* In the Japanese anime ''[[Saint Seiya]]'' the character, [[Andromeda Shun|Shun]], represents the [[Andromeda constellation]] using chains as his main weapons, reminiscent of Andromeda being chained before she was saved by Perseus. In order to attain the Andromeda Cloth, he was chained between two large pillars of rock and he had to overcome the chains before the tide came in and killed him, also reminiscent of this myth.
* Andromeda appears in [[Disney]]'s ''[[Hercules: The Animated Series]]'' as a new student of "Prometheus Academy" which Hercules and other characters from Greek mythology attend.

===In novels===
* In [[Rick Riordan]]'s ''[[Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians]]'' series, there are a few references to Andromeda. The most obvious is that the series' lead villains have a [[cruise ship]] which serves as their headquarters and is called ''The Princess Andromeda''.
* Andromeda is the main character in [[Harry Turtledove]]'s short story "Miss Manners' Guide to Greek Missology", published in [[Esther Friesner]]'s ''Chicks in Chainmail'' series of humorous feminist fantasy collections, and reprinted in other anthologies afterwards. It is a satire filled with role reversals, puns, and deliberate anachronisms relating to pop culture.
* Andromeda is Anna's full name in [[Jodi Picoult]]'s ''[[My Sister's Keeper (novel)|My Sister's Keeper]]'', which was turned into a movie in 2010. In the novel there are several references to mythology, as Anna's dad Brian is an astronomer in his free time.

{{Anthropology}}
'''Applied anthropology''' refers to the application of the method and theory of [[anthropology]] to the analysis and solution of practical problems. In ''Applied Anthropology: Domains of Application'', Kedia and Van Willigen define the process as a "complex of related, research-based, instrumental methods which produce change or stability in specific cultural systems through the provision of data, initiation of direct action, and/or the formulation of policy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kedia, Satish|first=and Willigen J. Van|title=Applied Anthropology: Domains of Application|year=2005|publisher=Praeger|location=Westport, Conn|pages=16, 150}}&lt;/ref&gt; More simply, applied anthropology is the praxis-based side of anthropological research; it includes researcher involvement and [[activism]] within the participating [[community]].

==Spanning academic disciplines==
The [[American Anthropological Association]] (AAA) website describes anthropology as a focus on "the study of humans, past and present. To understand the full sweep and complexity of cultures across all of human history, anthropology draws and builds upon knowledge from the social and biological sciences as well as the humanities and physical sciences." Thus, the field is divided into four subareas: [[sociocultural anthropology]], [[Biological anthropology|biological (or physical) anthropology]], [[archaeology]], and [[linguistic anthropology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=American Anthropological Association|title=What is Anthropology?|url=http://www.aaanet.org/about/whatisanthropology.cfm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because a central tenet of the anthropological field is the application of shared knowledge and research about humans across the world, an anthropologist who specializes in any of these areas and enacts research into direct action and/or policy can be deemed an "applied anthropologist". Indeed, some practical problems may invoke all sub-disciplines. For example, a [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] community development program may involve archaeological research to determine legitimacy of water rights claims, ethnography to assess the current and historical cultural characteristics of the community, linguistics to restore language competence among inhabitants, medical anthropology to determine the causality of dietary deficiency diseases, etc.

==Professional engagement==
Applied anthropologists often work for nonacademic clients, such as [[government]]s, development agencies, [[non-governmental organization]]s (NGOs), [[Tribe|tribal]] and [[Ethnic group|ethnic]] associations, [[advocacy group]]s, social-service and educational agencies, and businesses. It is also not uncommon for an anthropologist to initiate activist work surrounding his or her own area of study; frequently, sociocultural anthropological studies begin as mere research inquiries that blossom into community advocacy projects, and even new specialized NGOs.

Applied anthropologist methodology includes, but is not limited to, [[ethnography]], [[participant observation]], [[snowball sampling|snowballing]], interviews, and [[focus group]]s. They also use [[textual analysis]], surveying, [[archival research]], and other empirical methods to inform policy or to market products.

==Problems and criticisms==
The process of conducting anthropological research and then applying knowledge in attempts to ameliorate the lives of research participants can be problematic, and is often laced with elements of [[Orientalism]] and/or [[colonialism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Said|first=Edward W.|title=Orientalism|year=1994|publisher=Vintage Books|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kedia and Van Willigen describe the moral dilemma embedded in this work: "The ethical requirements of applied anthropology are especially challenging since the practitioner must negotiate an intricate balance between the interests of the clients who commission the work, and those of the community being studied." The authors continue by stating that this negotiation leads to issues of privacy, ownership, and the implications and purposes of the study being produced (p.&amp;nbsp;16). 

Although guidelines for ethicalities of applied anthropology are put forth by major anthropological organizations—including the American Anthropological Association (AAA), the [[Society for Applied Anthropology]] (SFAA), and the National Association for the Practice of Anthropology (NAPA)—it is increasingly difficult to ensure that the high volume of worldwide anthropologists proceed with their research in ways that are both culturally relative and sensitive to community needs. Kedia and Van Willigen describe the myriad roles an applied anthropologist must play as effective resource for communities in need; a researcher must be an advocate, cultural "broker", evaluator, policy researcher, public participation specialist, and research analyst. 

The multinational phenomenon of [[female genital cutting]] (FGC) exemplifies the necessity for an anthropologist to account for relative cultural contexts: "The work of scholars who stress the fundamental importance of offering perspectives on cultural factors that promote the practice of female genital cutting has brought the debate surrounding cultural relativism into sharp focus. Greunbaum (1996) notes that analyses that ''do'' offer [[Emic and etic|emic]] interpretations and cultural contextualizations are often criticized as bordering on advocacy for the practice" [emphasis in original].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shell-Duncan, Bettina|first=and Ylva Hernlund|title=Female "circumcision" in Africa: Culture, Controversy, and Change|year=2000|publisher=Lynne Rienner|location=Boulder|pages=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these instances, it is imperative that an anthropologist not cloud his or her own preconceived notions about health and gender relations in an attempt to "remedy" a complex social issue.

==Debates about objectivity in anthropology==
The field of anthropology is also fraught with debate surrounding accurate and effective approaches to conducting research. More specifically, there is continued debate about the essentiality of [[objectivity (science)|objectivity]] in anthropological fieldwork. Some [[Hermeneutics|hermeneutic]] scholars contend that it is impossible to remove one's own preconceived cultural notions from one's work. In this line of thought, it is more productive to recognize that anthropologists are themselves culturally programmed observers, and must always be wary of biases that influence information they receive. In contrast, the [[Positivism|positivist]] approach to anthropology emphasizes the necessity for 
an objective, regimented, and scientific approach to anthropological research.

==Scholarly works and organizations==
The premiere journal of applied anthropology in the United States is called ''[[Human Organization]]'', published by the Society for Applied Anthropology. In the UK, the main journal for applied anthropology is called ''[[Anthropology in Action]]''.

Under the directorship of the [[Royal Anthropological Institute]], Jonathan Benthall (author of ''The Best of Anthropology Today'') created the annual [[Lucy Mair]] Medal of Applied Anthropology. This recognizes excellence in using anthropology "for the relief of poverty or distress, or for the active recognition of human dignity".

The Association of Social Anthropologists (ASA) has a network of Applied Anthropologists known as "Apply". Within the [[European Association of Social Anthropologists]] (EASA), there is the [http://www.applied-anthropology.com/ Applied Anthropology Network], which annually organises the international symposium Why the World Needs Anthropologists. Theme of the first symposium was New Fields for Applied Anthropology in Europe (Amsterdam, 2013), of the second Coming Out of the Ivory Tower (Padua, 2014), of the third Burning Issues of Our Hot Planet (Ljubljana, 2015), of the fourth Humanise IT (Tartu, 2016), of the fifth Powering the Planet (Durham, 2017), and of the sixth Designing the Future (Lisbon, 2018). Within the EASA [[Medical anthropology|Medical Anthropology]] Network, there is also an applied anthropology special interest group.

There are three primary groups based out of the US that are founded on the application of anthropology with acute attention to ethics and social implications: American Anthropological Association (AAA), Society for Applied Anthropology (SFAA), and the National Association for the Practice of Anthropology (NAPA).

'''Autotomy''' (from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''auto-'' "self-" and ''tome'' "severing", [[wikt:αὐτοτομία|αὐτοτομία]]) or '''self-amputation''' is the behaviour whereby an animal sheds or discards one or more of its own [[appendage]]s,&lt;ref&gt;(2000). The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language: Fourth Edition.&lt;/ref&gt; usually as a [[self preservation|self-defense]] mechanism to elude a [[predation|predator]]'s grasp or to distract the predator and thereby allow escape. Some animals have the ability to [[regeneration (biology)|regenerate]] the lost body part later.

Depending upon the species, the animal may be able to partially [[Regeneration (biology)|regenerate]] its tail, typically over a period of weeks or months. Though functional, the new tail section often is shorter and will contain [[cartilage]] rather than regenerated vertebrae of [[bone]], and in colour and texture the [[skin]] of the regenerated organ generally differs distinctly from its original appearance.

The technical term for this ability to drop the tail is ''caudal autotomy''. In most lizards that sacrifice the tail in this manner, breakage occurs only when the tail is grasped with sufficient force, but some animals, such as some species of geckos, can perform true autotomy, throwing off the tail when sufficiently stressed, such as when attacked by ants.&lt;ref name= "Wrose"&gt;Rose, Walter; The Reptiles and Amphibians of Southern Africa; Pub: Maskew Miller, 1950&lt;/ref&gt;

Caudal autotomy in lizards takes two forms. In the first form, called intervertebral autotomy, the tail breaks between the vertebrae. The second form of caudal autotomy is intravertebral autotomy, in which there are zones of weakness, fracture planes across each [[vertebra]] in the mid-part of the tail.  In this second type of autotomy the lizard contracts a muscle to fracture a vertebra, rather than break the tail between two vertebrae.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Fleming|first2=P.A.|year=2009|title=To cut a long tail short: a review of lizard caudal autotomy studies carried out over the last 20 years|url=http://ftp.eebweb.arizona.edu/courses/Ecol483_583/Bateman%20and%20Fleming%202009.pdf|journal=Journal of Zoology|volume=277|issue=|pages=1–14|doi=10.1111/j.1469-7998.2008.00484.x|last1=Bateman|first1=P.W.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sphincter]] muscles in the tail then contract around the [[caudal artery]] to minimize bleeding. Caudal autotomy is prevalent among lizards; it has been recorded in 13 of approximately 20 families.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clause|first=Amanda R.|last2=Capaldi|first2=Elizabeth A.|date=2006-12-01|title=Caudal autotomy and regeneration in lizards|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jez.a.346/abstract|journal=Journal of Experimental Zoology Part A: Comparative Experimental Biology|language=en|volume=305A|issue=12|pages=965–973|doi=10.1002/jez.a.346|issn=1552-499X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Caudal autotomy is present as an anti-predator tactic but is also present in species that have high rates of intraspecific competition and aggression. For example, the ''Agama agama'' lizard fights by using its tail as a whip against other conspecifics. It can autotomize its tail but this is met with a social cost - tail loss decreases social standing and mating ability. However, the regenerated tail in this species takes on a new club-like shape providing the male with a better fighting weapon, such that autotomy and regeneration work together to increase the lizards ability to survive and reproduce.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gans|first=Carl|last2=Harris|first2=Vernon A.|date=1964-09-10|title=The Anatomy of the Rainbow Lizard Agama agama L.|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1441541|journal=Copeia|volume=1964|issue=3|pages=597|doi=10.2307/1441541|issn=0045-8511}}&lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Arnold|first=E.N.|date=1984-02|title=Evolutionary aspects of tail shedding in lizards and their relatives|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00222938400770131|journal=Journal of Natural History|volume=18|issue=1|pages=127–169|doi=10.1080/00222938400770131|issn=0022-2933}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bateman|first=P.

==== Autotomy in the fossil record ====
Fossils of reptiles possessing the ability to autotomize that are not within the lizard family have been found that date back to the late Carboniferous and Early Permian Era. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=van der Vos|first=W.|last2=Witzmann|first2=F.|last3=Fröbisch|first3=N.

===Mammals===
At least two species of African [[spiny mouse|spiny mice]], ''[[Acomys kempi]]'' and ''[[Acomys percivali]]'', are capable of autotomic release of skin, e.g. upon being captured by a predator. They are the first mammals known to do so.&lt;ref name="seifert2012"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Seifert | first1 = A. W. | last2 = Kiama | first2 = S. G. | last3 = Seifert | first3 = M.

It is believed that the corresponding regeneration genes could also function in humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Zoe |last=Cormier |url= http://www.nature.com/news/african-spiny-mice-can-regrow-lost-skin-1.11488#/ref-link-1|title= African spiny mice can regrow lost skin |publisher= [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |date=2012-09-26 |accessdate= 2012-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Invertebrates==
Over 200 species of invertebrates are capable of using autotomy as an avoidance or protective behaviour.&lt;ref name="Bely and Nyberg, 2009"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bely | first1 = A.E. | last2 = Nyberg | first2 = K.G. | year = 2009 | title = Evolution of animal regeneration: re-emergence of a field | url = | journal = Trends in Ecology &amp; Evolution | volume = 25 | issue = | pages = 161–170 | doi=10.1016/j.tree.2009.08.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fleming et al., 2007"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fleming | first1 = P.A. | last2 = Muller | first2 = D. | last3 = Bateman | first3 = P.W. | year = 2007 | title = Leave it all behind: a taxonomic perspective of autotomy in invertebrates | url = | journal = Biological Reviews | volume = 82 | issue = 3| pages = 481–510 | doi = 10.1111/j.1469-185X.2007.00020.x | pmid = 17624964 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These animals can voluntarily shed appendages when necessary for survival. Autotomy can occur in response to chemical, thermal and electrical stimulation, but is perhaps most frequently a response to mechanical stimulation during capture by a predator. Autotomy serves either to improve the chances of escape or to reduce further damage occurring to the remainder of the animal such as the spread of a chemical toxin after being stung.

===Molluscs===
Autotomy occurs in some species of octopus for survival and for reproduction: the specialized reproductive arm (the [[hectocotylus]]) detaches from the male during mating and remains within the female's [[mantle (mollusc)|mantle]] cavity.

Species of (land) slugs in the genus ''[[Prophysaon]]'' can self-amputate a portion of their tail.&lt;ref name="Donnel et al., 2009"&gt;McDonnel, R.J., Paine, T.D. and Gormally, M.J., (2009). [http://anrcatalog.ucdavis.edu/Items/8336.aspx Slugs: A Guide to the Invasive and Native Fauna of California]. 21 pp., {{ISBN|978-1-60107-564-2}}, page 9.&lt;/ref&gt; There is known autotomy of the tail of sea snail ''[[Oxynoe panamensis]]'' under persistent mechanical irritation.&lt;ref name="Lewin 1970"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lewin | first1 = R.

Some [[sea slugs]] exhibit autotomy. Both ''[[Discodoris lilacina]]'' and ''[[Berthella martensi]]'' will often drop their entire mantle skirt when handled, leading to [[Discodoris lilacina]] also being called ''Discodoris fragilis''. The members of ''[[Phyllodesmium]]'' will drop a large number of their [[cerata]] each, on the tip having a large sticky gland that secretes a sticky substance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Autotomy |url=http://www.seaslugforum.net/factsheet.cfm?base=defauto |work=The Sea Slug Forum |author=Rudman, W.B. |date=October 14, 1998 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100615000625/http://seaslugforum.net/factsheet.cfm?base=defauto |archivedate=2010-06-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Crustaceans===
Autotomic [[Florida stone crab|stone crabs]] are used as a self-replenishing source of food by humans, particularly in Florida. Harvesting is accomplished by removing one or both claws from the live animal and returning it to the ocean where it can regrow the lost limb(s).&lt;ref name="NOAA.gov FishWatch"&gt;''[http://www.nmfs.noaa.gov/fishwatch/species/stone_crab.htm Gulf and Florida Stone Crabs]''&lt;/ref&gt;  However, under experimental conditions, but using commercially accepted techniques, 47% of stone crabs that had both claws removed died after declawing, and 28% of single claw amputees died; 76% of the casualties died within 24 hours of declawing.&lt;ref name="Davis et al., (1978)"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Gary E.

(See [[Declawing of crabs]])

Post-harvest leg autotomy can be problematic in some crab and lobster fisheries, and often occurs if these crustaceans are exposed to freshwater or hypersaline water in the form of dried salt on sorting trays.&lt;ref name="Davidson and Hosking 2004"&gt;Davidson, G.W. and Hosking, W.W. (2004) ''[http://frdc.com.au/research/Documents/Final_reports/2000-251-DLD.PDF Development of a Method for Alleviating Leg Loss During Post-harvest Handling of Rock Lobsters]''. 104 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; The autotomy reflex in crustaceans has been proposed as an example of natural behaviour that raises questions concerning assertions on whether crustaceans can "feel pain", which may be based on definitions of "pain" that are flawed for lack of any falsifiable test, either to establish or deny the meaningfulness of the concept in this context.&lt;ref name="Rose et al. 2012"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rose | first1 = JD | last2 = Arlinghaus | first2 = R | last3 = Cooke | first3 = SJ | last4 = Diggles | first4 = BK | last5 = Sawynok | first5 = W | last6 = Stevens | first6 = ED | last7 = Wynne | first7 = CDL | year = 2012 | title = Can fish really feel pain? | url = | journal = Fish and Fisheries | volume = 15| issue = | pages = 97–133| doi = 10.1111/faf.12010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spiders===
[[File:Fishing spider autotomy.jpg|thumb|A [[fishing spider]] with two limbs missing]]
Under natural conditions, orb-weaving spiders ([[Argiope (spider)|''Argiope'']] spp.) undergo autotomy if they are stung in a leg by wasps or bees. Under experimental conditions, when spiders are injected in the leg with bee or wasp venom, they shed this appendage. But, if they are injected with only saline, they rarely autotomize the leg, indicating it is not the physical injection or the ingress of fluid ''per se'' that causes autotomy. In addition, spiders injected with venom components which cause injected humans to report pain ([[serotonin]], [[histamine]], [[phospholipase A2]] and [[melittin]]) autotomize the leg, but if the injections contain venom components which do not cause pain to humans, autotomy does not occur.&lt;ref name="Eisner and Camazine, 1983"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Eisner | first1 = T. | last2 = Camazine | first2 = S. | year = 1983 | title = Spider leg autotomy induced by prey venom injection: an adaptive response to 'pain'? | url = | journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America | volume = 80 | issue = | pages = 3382–3385 | doi=10.1073/pnas.80.11.3382| pmc = 394047 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bees===
Sometimes when honey bees (genus ''[[Apis (genus)|Apis]]'') [[sting (biology)|sting]] a victim, the barbed stinger remains embedded. As the bee tears itself loose, the stinger takes with it the entire distal segment of the bee's abdomen, along with a nerve [[ganglion]], various muscles, a [[venom sac]], and the end of the bee's digestive tract.&lt;ref&gt;Snodgrass, R.E. (1956). ''The Anatomy of the Honey Bee.'' Ithaca, New York: Cornell University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beekeeping.com/articles/us/bee_stings.htm|title=Removing bee stings|author =Visscher, P.K.|author2 =Vetter, R.S.|author3 =Camazine, S.|last-author-amp=yes|accessdate=April 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This massive abdominal rupture kills the bee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earthsky.org/earth/why-do-bees-die-after-they-sting-you|title=Why do honeybees die after they sting you?|accessdate=April 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it is widely believed that a [[worker bee|worker]] honey bee can sting only once, this is a partial misconception: although the [[stinger]] is barbed so that it lodges in the victim's [[skin]], tearing loose from the bee's [[abdomen]] and leading to its death, this only happens if the skin of the victim is sufficiently thick, such as a mammal's.&lt;ref name="how bees work"&gt;[http://science.howstuffworks.com/zoology/insects-arachnids/bee2.htm How Bees Work] – ''howstuffworks.com.'' Retrieved 23 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The sting of a queen honey bee has no barbs, however, and does not autotomize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asktheexterminator.com/bees/Bee_Stings.shtml|title=Bee stings|author=Steinau, R.|year=2011|accessdate=April 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; All species of true honey bees have this form of stinger autotomy. No other stinging insect, including the [[yellowjacket]] wasp and the [[Mexican honey wasp]], have the sting apparatus modified this way, though they may have barbed stings.  Two wasp species that use sting autotomy as a defense mechanism are ''[[Polybia rejecta]] ''and ''[[Synoeca surinama]].''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Sting Autotomy, a defensive mechanism in certain social Hymenoptera|last = Hermann|first = Henry|date = 1971|journal = Insectes Sociaux|accessdate = |doi =10.1007/bf02223116 |pmid = |volume=18 |pages=111–120}}&lt;/ref&gt;''  ''

The endophallus and cornua portions of the [[Drone (bee)#Mating and the drone reproductive organ|genitalia of male honey bees]] ([[Drone (bee)|drones]]) also autotomize during copulation, and form a [[mating plug]], which must be removed by the genitalia of subsequent drones if they are also to mate with the same queen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Collins | first1 = A.M. | last2 = Caperna | first2 = T.J. | last3 = Williams | first3 = V. | last4 = Garrett | first4 = W.M. | last5 = Evans | first5 = J.D. | year = 2006 | title = Proteomic analyses of male contributions to honey bee sperm storage and mating | url = | journal = Insect Molecular Biology | volume = 15 | issue = 5| pages = 541–549 | doi=10.1111/j.1365-2583.2006.00674.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The drones die within minutes of mating.

===Echinoderms===

The '''Bay of Bengal''' is the northeastern part of the [[Indian Ocean]], bounded on the west and northwest by [[India]] on the north by [[Bangladesh]], and on the east by [[Myanmar]] and the [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands]] of ([[India]]). Its southern limit is a line between [[Sri Lanka]] and the northwesternmost point of [[Sumatra]] (Indonesia). It is the largest water region called a [[bay]] in the world. There are [[Countries dependent on the Bay of Bengal]] in [[South Asia]] and [[Southeast Asia]].

The Bay of Bengal occupies an area of {{convert|2,172,000|km2}}. A number of large rivers flow into the Bay of Bengal: the [[Ganges]]-[[Hooghly River|Hooghly]], the [[Padma River|Padma]], the [[Brahmaputra River|Brahmaputra]]-[[Jamuna River (Bangladesh)|Jamuna]], the [[Barak River|Barak]]-[[Surma River|Surma]]-[[Meghna River|Meghna]], the [[Irrawaddy River|Irrawaddy]], the [[Godavari]], the [[Mahanadi]], the [[Brahmani River|Brahmani]], the [[Baitarani]], the [[Krishna River|Krishna]] and the [[Kaveri]]. Among the important ports are [[Port of Chennai|Chennai]]-[[Ennore Port|Ennore]], [[Port of Chittagong|Chittagong]], [[Colombo]], [[Port of Kolkata|Kolkata]]-[[Haldia]], [[Port of Mongla|Mongla]], [[Paradip]], [[Port Blair]], [[Tuticorin]], [[Visakhapatnam]] and [[Yangon]],[[Dhamra Port|Dhamra]] . Among the smaller ports are [[Gopalpur port|Gopalpur]] Port, [[Kakinada Port|Kakinada]] and [[Port of Payra|Payra]].

== Extent ==
The [[International Hydrographic Organization]] defines the limits of the Bay of Bengal as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iho.int/iho_pubs/standard/S-23/S-23_Ed3_1953_EN.pdf |title=Limits of Oceans and Seas, 3rd edition |year=1953 |publisher=International Hydrographic Organization |accessdate=7 February 2010  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

::''On the east:'' A line running from [[Cape Negrais]] (16°03'N) in '''Burma''' through the larger islands of the [[Andaman Islands|Andaman]] group, in such a way that all the narrow waters between the islands lie eastward of the line and are excluded from the Bay of Bengal, as far as a point in [[Little Andaman]] Island in latitude 10°48'N, longitude 92°24'E and thence along the southwest limit of the [[Andaman Sea|Burma Sea]] [A line running from Oedjong Raja ({{coord|5|32|N|95|12|E|display=inline}}) in [[Sumatra]] to Poeloe Bras (Breuëh) and on through the Western Islands of the [[Nicobar Islands|Nicobar]] Group to Sandy Point in Little Andaman Island, in such a way that all the narrow waters appertain to the Burma Sea].

::''On the south:'' [[Ram Sethu]] (between India and Ceylon &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Sri Lanka]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;) and from the southern extreme of [[Dondra Head]] (south point of Ceylon) to the north point of [[Poeloe Bras]] ({{coord|5|44|N|95|04|E|display=inline}}).

== Etymology ==
The bay gets its name from the historical [[Bengal]] region (The Indian state of [[West Bengal]] and modern-day [[Bangladesh]]). In ancient scriptures, this water body may have been referred to as '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''Mahodadhi''' ([[Sanskrit]]: महोदधि, lit. ''great water receptacle'')&lt;ref name="Kuttan"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nERVRxj22W0C&amp;pg=PA243 | title=The Great Philosophers of India | publisher=AuthorHouse | author=Kuttan | year=2009 | isbn=978-1434377807}}{{self-published source|date=August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="indiatourism4u"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.indiatourism4u.in/tourism/960/Tamil-Nadu/Dhanushkodi/ | title=Dhanushkodi | publisher=indiatourism4u.in | accessdate=21 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|reason=Citation is a random company website; there must be more scholarly sources for this.|date=August 2016}} while it appears as ''Sinus Gangeticus'' or ''Gangeticus Sinus'', meaning "Gulf of the Ganges", in ancient maps.&lt;ref&gt;[[commons:File:1794 Anville Map of the Ancient World - Geographicus - AncientWorld-anville-1794.jpg|1794, Orbis Veteribus Notus by Jean Baptiste Bourguignon d'Anville]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The other Sanskrit names for Bay of Bengal are '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''Vangopasagara''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' (Sanskrit: वङ्गोपसागर, lit. ''Bengal's Bay''), also simply called as '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''Vangasagara''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' (Sanskrit: वङ्गसागर, lit. ''Bengal Sea'') and '&lt;nowiki/&gt;''Purvapayodhi''' (Sanskrit: पूर्वपयोधि, lit. ''Eastern Ocean''). Even today in Bengali and Odia it is known as "Bongoposagor".

== Rivers ==
Many major [[Rivers of India]] flow west to east before draining into the Bay of Bengal. The [[Ganges|Ganga]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; is the northernmost of these. Its main channel enters and flows through Bangladesh, where it is known as the [[Padma River]], before joining the [[Meghna River]]. However, the [[Brahmaputra River]] flows from east to west in [[Assam]] before turning south and entering Bangladesh where it is called the [[Jamuna River]]. This joins the Padma where upon the Padma joins the [[Meghna River]] that finally drains into Bay of Bengal. The [[Sundarbans]] mangrove of forest of Bangladesh is a forest at the delta of the Padma, Jamuna and Meghna rivers lies partly in West Bengal and mostly in Bangladesh. The Brahmaputra at {{convert|2948|km|mi|abbr=on}} is the 28th [[List of rivers by length|longest River]] in the world. It originates in [[Tibet]]. The [[Hooghly River]], another channel of the [[Ganga]] that flows through [[Calcutta]] drains into Bay of Bengal.

The Padma–Meghna-Jamuna rivers deposit nearly 1000 million tons of [[sediment]] every year. The sediment from these three rivers form the Bengal Delta and the [[submarine fan]], a vast structure that extends from Bangladesh to south of the Equator, is up to {{convert|16.5|km}} thick, and contains at least 1,130 trillion tonnes of sediment, which has accumulated over the last 17 million years at an average rate of 665 million tons per annum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url= http://www.iisc.ernet.in/currsci/apr252003/1041.pdf |format=PDF|title=  A sediment budget for the Padma-Meghna-Jamuna catchment|first=Robert|last=Wasson|year=2003|journal=Current Science|volume=84|issue=8|pages=1041–1047}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fan has buried organic carbon at a rate of nearly 1.1 trillion mol/yr (13.2 million t/yr) since the early [[Miocene]] period. The three rivers currently contribute nearly 8% of the [[total organic carbon]] (TOC) deposited in the world's oceans. Due to high TOC accumulation in the deep sea bed of the Bay of Bengal, the area is rich in oil and natural gas and [[gas hydrate]] reserves. Bangladesh can [[Land reclamation|reclaim land]] substantially and economically gain from the sea area by constructing sea [[Levee|dikes]], bunds, [[causeways]] and by trapping the sediment from its rivers.

Further southwest of Bangladesh, the [[Mahanadi River|Mahanadi]], [[Godavari River|Godavari]], [[Krishna River|Krishna]] and [[Kaveri River]]s also flow from west to east in [[South Asia]] and drain into the Bay of Bengal. Many small rivers also drain directly into the Bay of Bengal; the shortest of them is the [[Cooum River]] at {{convert|64|km|mi|abbr=on}}.

The [[Irrawaddy River|Irrawaddy (or Ayeyarwady) River]] in Myanmar flows into the [[Andaman Sea]] of the Bay of Bengal and once had thick [[Myanmar Coast mangroves|mangrove]] forests of its own.

== Seaports ==
[[File:VizagPort.jpg|thumb|250px|The city of [[Visakhapatnam]] in India is a major port of the Bay of Bengal]]

Indian ports on the bay include [[Paradip Port]] , [[Port of Kolkata|Kolkata Port]], [[Haldia Port]], [[Chennai]], [[Visakhapatnam]], [[Kakinada Port|Kakinada]], [[Pondicherry]], [[Dhamra]], [[Gopalpur-on-Sea|Gopalpur]] and Bangladeshi ports on the Bay are [[Port of Chittagong|Chittagong]], [[Port of Mongla|Mongla]], [[Payra Port]].

== Islands ==
The islands in the bay are numerous, including the [[Andaman Islands]], [[Nicobar Islands|Nicobar]] and [[Mergui]] groups of India. The Cheduba group of islands, in the north-east, off the Burmese coast, are remarkable for a chain of mud volcanoes, which are occasionally active.&lt;ref name=EB1911/&gt;

[[Great Andaman]] is the main archipelago or island group of the [[Andaman Islands]], whereas [[Ritchie's Archipelago]] consists of smaller islands. Only 37, or 6.5%, of the 572 islands and islets of the [[Andaman and Nicobar Islands]] are inhabited.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070930024520/http://www.and.nic.in/port-blair.htm The long stretch of sand glistening like silver dust] URL accessed 10 January 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Plate tectonics ===
The [[lithosphere]] of the earth is broken up into what are called [[Plate tectonics|tectonic plates]]. Underneath the Bay of Bengal, which is part of the great [[Indo-Australian Plate]] and is slowly moving north east. This plate meets the [[Burma Plate|Burma Microplate]] at the [[Sunda Trench]]. The [[Nicobar Islands]], and the [[Andaman Islands]] are part of the [[Burma Plate|Burma Microplate]]. The India Plate subducts beneath the Burma Plate at the [[Sunda Trench]] or Java Trench. Here, the pressure of the two plates on each other increase pressure and temperature resulting in the formation of volcanoes such as the [[List of volcanoes in Myanmar|volcanoes in Myanmar]], and a [[volcanic arc]] called the [[Sunda Arc]]. The [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami|Sumatra-Andaman earthquake and Asian tsunami]] was a result of the pressure at this zone causing a [[submarine earthquake]] which then resulted in a destructive tsunami.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.idiom.com/~garcia/tsunami.html Tsunami] URL access 21 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Physical oceanography – climate ===
From January to October, the current is northward flowing, and the clockwise circulation pattern is called the "East Indian Current". The Bay of Bengal [[Climate of India|monsoon]] moves in a northwest direction striking the [[Nicobar Islands]], and the [[Andaman Islands]] first end of May, then the north eastern coast of India by end of June.

The remainder of the year, the counterclockwise current is southwestward flowing, and the circulation pattern is called the East Indian Winter Jet. September and December see very active weather, season varsha (or monsoon), in the Bay of Bengal producing severe cyclones which affect eastern India. Several efforts have been initiated to cope with [[storm surge]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://stommel.tamu.edu/~baum/paleo/ocean/node3.html Glossary of Physical Oceanography Ba-Bm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071018134105/http://stommel.tamu.edu/~baum/paleo/ocean/node3.html |date=18 October 2007 }} URL accessed 21 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

== Economy ==
One of the first trading ventures along the Bay of Bengal was The Company of Merchants of London Trading into the East Indies more commonly referred to as the [[British East India Company]]. [[Gopalpur-on-Sea]] was one of their main trading centers. Other trading companies along the Bay of Bengal shorelines were the [[English East India Company]] and the [[French East India Company]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://nabataea.net/bengal.html Nabataea: Trade on the Bay of Bengal] URL accessed 21 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

== Environmental hazards ==

=== Pollution ===

The [[Asian brown cloud]], a layer of air pollution that covers much of South Asia and the Indian Ocean every year between January and March, and possibly also during earlier and later months, hangs over the Bay of Bengal. It is considered to be a combination of vehicle exhaust, smoke from 
cooking fires, and industrial discharges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/NaturalHazards/shownh.php3?img_id=13341 |title=EO Natural Hazards: Smog over the Bay of Bengal |website=NASA Earth Observatory |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071026204458/http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/NaturalHazards/shownh.php3?img_id=13341 |archive-date=26 October 2007 |access-date=21 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Transboundary issues affecting the marine ecosystem ==
{{refimprove section|date=December 2012}}
A transboundary issue is defined as an environmental problem in which either the cause of the problem and/or its impact is separated by a national boundary; or the problem contributes to a global environmental problem and finding regional solutions is considered to be a global environmental benefit. The eight Bay of Bengal countries have (2012) identified three major transboundary problems (or areas of concern) affecting the health of the Bay, that they can work on together.  With the support of the Bay Of Bengal Large Marine Ecosystem Project (BOBLME), the eight countries are now (2012) developing responses to these issues and their causes, for future implementation as the Strategic Action Programme.

=== Overexploitation of fisheries ===
[[File:Bay of Bengal 2.jpg|thumb|250px|Some small fishing boats are catching fish &amp; sell them in local coastal markets]][[Fisheries]] production in the Bay of Bengal is six million tonnes per year, more than seven percent of the world's catch. The major transboundary issues relating to shared fisheries are: a decline in the overall availability of fish resources; changes in species composition of catches; the high proportion of juvenile fish in the catch; and changes in [[marine biodiversity]], especially through loss of vulnerable and [[endangered species]]. The transboundary nature of these issues are:  that many [[fish stocks]] are shared between BOBLME countries through the transboundary migration of [[fish]], or [[Ichthyoplankton|larvae]]. [[Fishing]] overlaps national jurisdictions, both legally and illegally&amp;nbsp;– overcapacity and [[overfishing]] in one location forces a migration of fishers and vessels to other locations.  All countries (to a greater or lesser degree) are experiencing difficulties in implementing [[fisheries management]], especially the [[ecosystem approach to fisheries]].  Bay of Bengal countries contribute significantly to the global problem of loss of [[vulnerable species|vulnerable]] and [[endangered species]].
The main causes of the issues are: open access to fishing grounds; Government emphasis on increasing fish catches; inappropriate government subsidies provided to fishers; increasing fishing effort, especially from [[Fishing trawler|trawlers]] and [[purse seiners]]; high consumer demand for fish, including for seed and [[fishmeal]] for [[aquaculture]]; ineffective fisheries management; and illegal and destructive fishing.

=== Degradation of critical habitats ===
The Bay of Bengal is an area of high biodiversity, with many [[endangered species|endangered]] and [[vulnerable species]].
The major transboundary issues relating to habitats are:  the loss and degradation of [[mangrove|mangrove habitats]]; [[Environmental issues with coral reefs|degradation of coral reefs]]; and the loss of, and damage to, [[seagrasses]]. The transboundary nature of these major issues are:  that all three critical habitats occur in all BOBLME countries. [[Coastal development hazards|Coastal development]] for several varying uses of the land and sea are common in all BOBLME countries. Trade in products from all the habitats is transboundary in nature. [[Climate change]] impacts are shared by all BOBLME countries.
The main causes of the issues are: [[food security]] needs of the coastal poor; lack of [[Coastal management|coastal development plans]]; increasing trade in products from coastal habitats; coastal development and industrialization; ineffective [[marine protected area]]s and lack of enforcement; upstream development that affects water-flow; [[Nonpoint source pollution|intensive upstream agricultural practices]]; and increasing tourism.

=== Pollution and water quality ===
The major transboundary issues relating to [[marine pollution|pollution]] and [[water quality]] are:  sewage-borne pathogens and organic load; solid waste/marine litter; increasing nutrient inputs; oil pollution; persistent organic pollutants ([[Persistent organic pollutant|POPs]]) and persistent toxic substances (PTSs); sedimentation; and heavy metals.
The transboundary nature of these issues are: discharge of untreated/partially treated [[sewage]] being a common problem.  Sewage and organic discharges from the [[Ganges]]-[[Brahmaputra]]-[[Meghna]] River are likely to be transboundary. Plastics and derelict fishing gear can be transported long distances across national boundaries. High nutrient discharges from rivers could intensify largescale hypoxia.  Atmospheric transport of nutrients is inherently transboundary.  Differences between countries with regard to regulation and enforcement of shipping discharges may drive discharges across boundaries. [[Tarball (oil)|Tar balls]] are transported long distances. POPs/PTSs and [[Mercury (element)|mercury]], including organo-mercury, undergo long-range transport. [[Sedimentation]] and most heavy metal contamination tend to be localized and lack a strong transboundary dimension.
The main causes of the issues are:  increasing coastal population density and urbanization; higher consumption, resulting in more waste generated per person; insufficient funds allocated to waste management; migration of industry into BOBLME countries; and proliferation of small industries.

== History ==

[[File:Andaman ross is.jpg|thumb|Ross Island, in the [[Andaman islands|Andamans]], was one of the main naval bases of [[British India]] during [[World War II]]]]

[[Northern Circars]] occupied the western coast of the Bay of Bengal and is now considered to be India's Madras state. [[Chola dynasty]] (9th century to 12th century) when ruled by [[Rajaraja Chola I]] occupied the western coastline of the Bay of Bengal [[History of India#Chola empire|circa AD&amp;nbsp;1014]], The Bay of Bengal was also called the Chola Lake. The [[Kakatiya dynasty]] reached the western coastline of the Bay of Bengal between the Godavari and the Krishna rivers. [[Kushan Empire|Kushanas]] about the middle of the [[History of India#Early middle kingdoms - the golden age|1st century AD]] invaded northern India perhaps extending as far as the Bay of Bengal. [[Chandragupta Maurya]] extended the [[Military history of India#Maurya dynasty|Maurya Dynasty]] across northern India to the Bay of Bengal. [[Diamond Harbour|Hajipur]] was a stronghold for Portuguese Pirates. In the 16th century the Portuguese built trading posts in the north of the Bay of Bengal at Chittagong (Porto Grande) and [[Saptagram|Satgaon]] (Porto Pequeno).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.colonialvoyage.com/bengal.html The Portuguese in Bengal.

== Marine archaeology ==
[[Maritime archaeology]] or marine archaeology is the study of material remains of ancient peoples. A specialized branch, [[Archaeology of shipwrecks]] studies the salvaged artifacts of ancient ships. Stone anchors, amphorae shards, elephant tusks, hippopotamus teeth, ceramic pottery, a rare wood mast and lead ingots are examples which may survive the test of time for archaeologists to study and place the salvaged findings into a time line of history. coral reefs, tsunamis, cyclones, mangrove swamps, battles and a criss cross of sea routes in a high trading area combined with pirating have all contributed to shipwrecks in the Bay of Bengal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://drs.nio.org/drs/bitstream/2264/30/3/Man_Environ_29_28.pdf Marine Archaeology in India] URL accessed 22 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Whilst there is a trend towards the miniaturization of devices, in particular, networks consisting of several miniaturized body sensor units (BSUs) together with a single body central unit (BCU).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Biomed Tech|year=2002|volume=47|pages=365–8|title=Body Area Network BAN—a key infrastructure element for patient-centered medical applications|vauthors=Schmidt R, Norgall T, Mörsdorf J, Bernhard J, von der Grün T |pmid=12451866|issue=1|doi=10.1515/bmte.2002.47.s1a.365}}&lt;/ref&gt; Larger decimeter (tab and pad) sized [[smart devices]], accompanied devices, still play an important role in terms of acting as a data hub, data gateway and providing a user interface to view and manage BAN applications, in-situ. The development of WBAN technology started around 1995 around the idea of using  [[wireless personal area network]] (WPAN) technologies to implement communications on, near, and around the human body. About six years later, the term "BAN" came to refer to systems where communication is entirely within, on, and in the immediate proximity of a human body.&lt;ref name=Yuce&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Sensors and Actuators A: Physical|year=2010|volume=162|issue=1|title=Implementation of wireless body area networks for healthcare systems|author=M.

==Concept==
The rapid growth in physiological sensors, low-power integrated circuits, and wireless communication has enabled a new generation of [[wireless sensor networks]], now used for purposes such as monitoring traffic, crops, infrastructure, and health. The body area network field is an interdisciplinary area which could allow inexpensive and continuous health monitoring with real-time updates of medical records through the Internet. A number of intelligent physiological sensors can be integrated into a wearable wireless body area network, which can be used for computer-assisted rehabilitation or early detection of medical conditions. This area relies on the feasibility of implanting very small biosensors inside the human body that are comfortable and that don't impair normal activities. The implanted sensors in the human body will collect various physiological changes in order to monitor the patient's health status no matter their location. The information will be transmitted wirelessly to an external processing unit. This device will instantly transmit all information in real time to the doctors throughout the world. If an emergency is detected, the physicians will immediately inform the patient through the computer system by sending appropriate messages or alarms. Currently the level of information provided and energy resources capable of powering the sensors are limiting. While the technology is still in its primitive stage it is being widely researched and once adopted, is expected to be a breakthrough invention in [[healthcare]], leading to concepts like [[telemedicine]] and [[mHealth]] becoming real.

==Applications==
Initial applications of BANs are expected to appear primarily in the healthcare domain, especially for continuous monitoring and logging vital parameters of patients suffering from [[chronic disease]]s such as [[diabetes]], [[asthma]] and [[heart attacks]].

* A BAN network in place on a patient can alert the hospital, even before they have a heart attack, through measuring changes in their [[vital signs]].
* A BAN network on a diabetic patient could auto inject insulin through a pump, as soon as their insulin level declines.

Other applications of this technology include sports, military, or security. Extending the technology to new areas could also assist communication by seamless exchanges of information between individuals, or between individual and machines.

==Standards==
The latest international standard for BANs is the [[IEEE 802.15.6]] standard.&lt;ref&gt;[http://standards.ieee.org/findstds/standard/802.15.6-2012.html IEEE P802.15.6-2012 Standard for Wireless Body Area Networks]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Components==
A typical BAN or BSN requires vital sign monitoring [[sensors]], motion detectors (through [[accelerometers]]) to help identify the location of the monitored individual and some form of communication, to transmit vital sign and motion readings to medical practitioners or care givers. A typical body area network kit will consist of sensors, a [[microprocessor|Processor]], a [[transceiver]] and a [[battery (electricity)|battery]]. Physiological sensors, such as [[ECG]] and [[SpO2]] sensors, have been developed. Other sensors such as a blood pressure sensor, [[EEG]] sensor and a [[PDA]] for BSN interface are under development.&lt;ref&gt;http://vip.doc.ic.ac.uk/bsn/m621.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wireless communication in the U.S.===
The FCC has approved the allocation of 40&amp;nbsp;MHz of spectrum bandwidth for medical BAN low-power, wide-area radio links at the 2360–2400&amp;nbsp;MHz band. This will allow off-loading MBAN communication from the already saturated standard Wi-Fi spectrum to a standard band.&lt;ref name="urlBody Area Networks should free hospital bandwidth, untether patients - Computerworld"&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9227683/_Body_Area_Networks_should_free_hospital_bandwidth_untether_patients?source=CTWNLE_nlt_emgtech_2012-06-06

|website=
|accessdate=2012-06-06
|date=2012-06-04
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2360–2390&amp;nbsp;MHz frequency range is available on a secondary basis. The FCC will expand the existing Medical Device Radiocommunication (MedRadio) Service in Part 95 of its rules. MBAN devices using the band will operate under a ‘license-by-rule’ basis which eliminates the need to apply for individual transmitter licenses. Usage of the 2360–2390&amp;nbsp;MHz frequencies are restricted to indoor operation at health-care facilities and are subject to registration and site approval by coordinators to protect aeronautical telemetry primary usage. Operation in the 2390–2400&amp;nbsp;MHz band is not subject to registration or coordination and may be used in all areas including residential.&lt;ref name="urlFCC Dedicates Spectrum Enabling Medical Body Area Networks | FCC.gov"&gt;{{cite web

==Challenges==
Problems with the use of this technology could include:

* '''Data Quality''': Data generated and collected through BANs can play a key role in the patient care process. It is essential that the quality of this data is of a high standard to ensure that the decisions made are based on the best information possible
* '''Data Management''': As BANs generate large volumes of data, the need to manage and maintain these datasets is of utmost importance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crcpress.com/product/isbn/9781439821817;jsessionid=QYm6NTA3ICOGNBvOn3i9MA** Lai, D. , Begg, R.K. and Palaniswami, M. eds, Healthcare Sensor Networks: Challenges towards practical implementation], {{ISBN|978-1-4398-2181-7}}, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Sensor Validation''': Pervasive sensing devices are subject to inherent communication and hardware constraints including unreliable wired/wireless network links, interference and limited power reserves. This may result in erroneous datasets being transmitted back to the end user. It is of the utmost importance especially within a healthcare domain that all sensor readings are validated. This helps to reduce false alarm generation and to identify possible weaknesses within the hardware and software design.
* '''Data Consistency''': Data residing on multiple mobile devices and wireless patient notes need to be collected and analysed in a seamless fashion. Within body area networks, vital patient datasets may be fragmented over a number of nodes and across a number of networked PCs or Laptops. If a medical practitioner′s mobile device does not contain all known information then the quality of patient care may degrade.
* '''Security''': Considerable effort would be required to make WBAN transmission secure and accurate. It would have to be made sure that the patient ‘'secure‘’ data is only derived from each patient's dedicated WBAN system and is not mixed up with other patient's data. Further, the data generated from WBAN should have secure and limited access. Although security is a high priority in most networks, little study has been done in this area for WBANs. As WBANs are resource-constrained in terms of power, memory, communication rate and computational capability, security solutions proposed for other networks may not be applicable to WBANs. Confidentiality, authentication, integrity, and freshness of data together with availability and secure management are the security requirements in WBAN. The IEEE 802.15.6 standard, which is latest standard for WBAN, tried to provide security in WBAN. However, it has several security problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book&lt;!-- Deny Citation Bot--&gt; |arxiv = 1501.02601|last1 = Toorani|first1 = Mohsen|chapter= On Vulnerabilities of the Security Association in the IEEE 802.15.6 Standard|title= Financial Cryptography and Data Security |volume = 8976 |pages = 245–260|year = 2015|doi = 10.1007/978-3-662-48051-9_18|series = Lecture Notes in Computer Science|isbn = 978-3-662-48050-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Interoperability''': WBAN systems would have to ensure seamless [[data transfer]] across standards such as [[Bluetooth]], [[ZigBee]] etc. to promote information exchange, [[plug and play]] device interaction. Further, the systems would have to be [[scalable]], ensure efficient migration across networks and offer uninterrupted connectivity.
* '''System devices''': The sensors used in WBAN would have to be low on complexity, small in form factor, light in weight, power efficient, easy to use and reconfigurable. Further, the storage devices need to facilitate remote storage and viewing of patient data as well as access to external processing and analysis tools via the [[Internet]].
* '''Invasion of privacy''': People might consider the WBAN technology as a potential threat to freedom, if the applications go beyond "secure" medical usage. Social acceptance would be key to this technology finding a wider application.
* '''Interference''': The wireless link used for body sensors should reduce the interference and increase the coexistence of sensor node devices with other network devices available in the environment. This is especially important for large scale implementation of WBAN systems.&lt;ref name=Yuce/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garcia P., "A Methodology for the Deployment of Sensor Networks", IEEE Transactions On Knowledge And Data Engineering, vol. 11, no. 4, December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Cost''': Today's consumers expect low cost health monitoring solutions which provide high functionality. WBAN implementations will need to be cost optimized to be appealing alternatives to health conscious consumers.
*'''Constant monitoring''': Users may require different levels of monitoring, for example those at risk of cardiac ischemia may want their WBANs to function constantly, while others at risk of falls may only need WBANs to monitor them while they are walking or moving. The level of monitoring influences the amount of energy required and the life cycle of the BAN before the energy source is depleted.
*'''Constrained deployment''': The WBAN needs to be wearable, lightweight and non intrusive. It should not alter or encumber the user's daily activities. The technology should ultimately be transparent to the user i.e., it should perform its monitoring tasks without the user realising it.
*'''Consistent performance''': The performance of the WBAN should be consistent. Sensor measurements should be accurate and calibrated, even when the WBAN is switched off and switched on again.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ucc.ie/en/media/research/misl/2009publications/pervasive09.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The wireless links should be robust and work under various user environments.

'''Bristol Byzantine''' is a variety of [[Byzantine Revival architecture]] that was popular in the city of [[Bristol]] from about 1850 to 1880.

Many buildings in the style have been destroyed or demolished, but notable surviving examples include the [[Colston Hall]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Colston Hall  | work=Images of England | url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=379355 | accessdate=2007-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Granary, Bristol|Granary on Welsh Back]], the [[Carriage Works, Bristol |Carriage Works]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=No.104 The Carriage Works  | work=Images of England | url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=380632 | accessdate=2007-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; on [[Stokes Croft]] and several of the buildings around Victoria Street. Several of the warehouses around the harbour have survived including the [[Arnolfini]] which now houses an art gallery.&lt;ref name="Bush House"&gt;{{cite web | title=Bush House | work=Images of England | url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=380204 | accessdate=2006-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Clarks Wood Company warehouse]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Clarks Wood Company warehouse | work=Images of England | url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=380529 | accessdate=2007-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[St Vincent's Works]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=St Vincent's Works and attached front area railings | work=Images of England | url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=380525 | accessdate=2007-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Silverthorne Lane and the [[Wool Hall, Bristol|Wool Hall]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=No.12 The Wool Hall, including the Fleece and Firkin Public House| work=Images of England | url=http://www.imagesofengland.org.uk/details/default.aspx?id=380514 | accessdate=2007-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; in St Thomas Street are other survivors from the 19th century.

==Style==
Bristol Byzantine has influences from [[Byzantine architecture|Byzantine]] and [[Moorish architecture]] applied mainly to industrial buildings such as warehouses and factories.

The style is characterised by a robust and simple outline, materials with character and colour including red, yellow, black and white brick primarily from the [[Cattybrook Brickpit]].

Several buildings included archways and upper floors unified through either horizontal or vertical grouping of window openings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bristol Byzantine |work=Looking at Buildings |url=http://www.lookingatbuildings.org.uk/default.asp?Document=3.C.1.6 |accessdate=2007-05-19 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927234936/http://www.lookingatbuildings.org.uk/default.asp?Document=3.C.1.6 |archivedate=2007-09-27 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The first building with some of the characteristics generally thought of a Bristol Byzantine is Bush House, which is now known as the [[Arnolfini]] a 19th-century Grade II* [[listed building|listed]]&lt;ref name="Bush House" /&gt; [[tea]] warehouse situated on the side of the [[Floating Harbour]] in [[Bristol city centre]]. The architect was [[Richard Shackleton Pope]], who constructed first the south part of the warehouse (1831) then extended it to the north in 1835–36. It has a rock-faced plinth, three storeys of rectangular windows recessed within tall round arches, and a shallow attic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bush House |work=Looking at Buildings |url=http://www.lookingatbuildings.org.uk/cities/bristol/bush-house.html |accessdate=2010-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The style may have come about as a result of an acquaintance between [[William Venn Gough]] and Archibald Ponton, who designed [[Granary, Bristol|the Granary]] and [[John Addington Symonds]] the Bristol-born historian of the [[Italian renaissance]]. The term Bristol Byzantine is thought to have been invented by Sir [[John Summerson]].&lt;ref name="Brace"&gt;{{cite book |last=Brace |first=Keith |title=Portrait of Bristol |year=1996 |publisher=Robert Hale |location=London |isbn=0-7091-5435-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Circassian beauties''' is a phrase used to refer to an idealized image of the women of the [[Circassians|Circassian people]] of the [[Northern Caucasus|Northwestern Caucasus]]. A fairly extensive literary history suggests that Circassian women were thought to be unusually beautiful, spirited, and elegant, and as such were desirable as [[concubine]]s.

This reputation dates back to the Late Middle Ages, when the Circassian coast was frequented by traders from Genoa, and the founder of the Medici dynasty, [[Cosimo de' Medici]], had [[Carlo de' Medici|an illegitimate son]] from a Circassian slave. During the [[Ottoman Empire]] and Persian [[Safavid]] and [[Qajar Dynasty|Qajar]] dynasties, Circassian women living as slaves in the Sultan's [[Imperial Harem]] and Shah's harems started to build their reputation as extremely beautiful and genteel, which then became a common [[trope (literature)|trope]] in Western [[Orientalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Irvin Cemil Schick, ''Çerkes Güzeli: Bir Şarkiyatçı İmgenin Serüveni'' [The Fair Circassian: Adventures of an Orientalist Motif], trans. A. Anadol (Istanbul: Oğlak Yayınları, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of this reputation, in Europe and America Circassians were often characterised as [[ideal of feminine beauty|ideals of feminine beauty]] in poetry and art. Cosmetic products were advertised, from the 18th century on, using the word "Circassian" in the title, or claiming that the product was based on substances used by the women of Circassia.

In consequence, most wives of several [[Ottoman Sultan]]s were ethnic Circassians converted to [[Islam]], e.g. [[Valide Sultan]]s (Empress mothers), including [[Rahime Perestu Sultan|Perestü Valide Sultan]], [[Pertevniyal Sultan|Pertevniyal Valide Sultan]], [[Şevkefza Sultan|Şevkefza Valide Sultan]], [[Tirimüjgan Sultan|Tirimüjgan Valide Sultan]], [[Nükhetsezâ Hanımefendi (wife of Abdul Hamid I)|Nükhetseza Başhanımefendi]], other important [[Khatun|Hatun]]s (Ladies) and [[Sultans]] like [[Şemsiruhsar Hatun]] and [[Ibrahim of the Ottoman Empire|Saçbağlı Sultan]], [[Haseki sultan]]s (chief consorts) such as [[Mahidevran Sultan|Mahidevran Haseki Sultan]], [[Hümaşah Sultan|Hümaşah Haseki Sultan]], [[Hatice Muazzez Sultan|Hatice Muazzez Haseki Sultan]], and [[Ayşe Hatun (wife of Osman II)|Ayşe Haseki Sultan]] besides numerous [[Kadınefendi|Başkadınefendi]]s (most senior consorts), including [[Bedrifelek Kadınefendi|Bedrifelek I]], [[Biydâr Kadın Efendi|Bidar II]], [[Kamures Kadınefendi|Kamures I]], and [[Servetsezâ Kadınefendi|Servetseza I]] as well as [[Kadınefendi]]s (senior consorts) such as [[Bezmican Kadınefendi|Bezmara VI]], [[Düzd-i Dil Kadın Efendi|Düzdidil III]], [[Hayranidil Kadınefendi|Hayranıdil II]], [[Meyliservet Kadınefendi|Meyliservet IV]], [[Mihrengiz Kadınefendi|Mihrengiz II]], [[Neşerek Kadınefendi|Neşerek III]], [[Abdul Hamid II#Second marriage and issue|Nurefsun II]], [[Reftar-i Dil Hatgil|Reftaridil II]], [[Şayan Kadınefendi (wife of Murad V)|Şayan III]], amongst many others, or [[Hanımefendi|İkbals]] (honoured lady consorts), most notable of them being [[Cevherriz Hanımefendi|Cevherriz II]], [[Abdülmecid I#Marriages and children|Ceylanyar II]], [[Dilfirib Kadınefendi|Dilfirib I]], [[Abdülmecid I#Marriages and children|Nalanıdil III]], and [[Abdülmecid I#Marriages and children|Nergis IV]] in addition to [[Hanımefendi|Gözde]]s (favourite lady consorts), including [[Abdul Hamid II|Dürdane I]], [[Abdülmecid I#Marriages and children|Hüsnicenan III]], [[Abdülmecid I#Marriages and children|Safderun IV]], amongst others. The "golden age" of the Circassian beauty may be considered to be between the 1770s, when the Russian Empire seized the [[Crimean Khanate]] and cut off their slave trade in Eastern European women, which increased the demand for Circassian women in Near Eastern harems; and the 1860s, when the Russians [[Circassian genocide|destroyed Circassia itself]].

In the 1860s the showman [[P. T. Barnum]] exhibited women who he claimed were Circassian beauties. They wore a distinctive curly, [[big hair]] style, which had no precedent in earlier portrayals of Circassians, but which was soon copied by other female performers in the United States, who became known as "moss-haired girls". This hair style was a sort of a exhibit's trademark and was achieved by washing the hair of women in beer, drying it and then teasing it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Race, Showmen, Disabilities and the Freak Show|last=Bogdan|first=Robert|publisher=Routledge|year=2014|isbn=978-0-415-74393-8|location=NY|pages=200, 201}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not clear why Barnum chose this hairstyle. It may have been a reference to the Circassian fur hat, rather than the hair.

There were also several classical Turkish music pieces and poems that praise the beauty of the "Lepiska Saçlı Çerkes" (Straight, [[blonde#flaxen|flaxen]]-haired Circassian; "lepiska" refers to long blonde hair which is soft and straight, as if flatironed).

The legend of Circassian women in the western world was enhanced in 1734, when, in his ''[[Letters on the English]]'', [[Voltaire]] alludes to the beauty of Circassian women:

{{Quote|The Circassians are poor, and their daughters are beautiful, and indeed it is in them they chiefly trade. They furnish with those beauties the [[seraglio]] of the Turkish Sultan, of the Persian [[Sophy (Safavid Empire)|Sophy]], and of all of those who are wealthy enough to purchase and maintain such precious merchandise. These maidens are very honorably and virtuously instructed how to fondle and caress men; are taught dances of a very polite and effeminate kind; and how to heighten by the most voluptuous artifices the pleasures of their disdainful masters for whom they are designed.|Letter XI, On Inoculation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/1778voltaire-lettres.html |title=Voltaire's Letters on the English |publisher= |accessdate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Their beauty is mentioned in [[Henry Fielding]]'s ''[[The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling|Tom Jones]]'' (1749), in which Fielding remarked, "How contemptible would the brightest Circassian beauty, drest in all the jewels of the Indies, appear to my eyes!"&lt;ref&gt;Henry Fielding, ''Tom Jones'', book 5, ch. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar erotic claims about Circassian women appear in [[Lord Byron]]'s ''[[Don Juan (Byron)|Don Juan]]'' (1818–24), in which the tale of a slave auction is told:

{{poemquote|
Some went off dearly; fifteen hundred dollars
For one Circassian, a sweet girl, were given,
Warranted virgin. Beauty's brightest colours
Had decked her out in all the hues of heaven.
Her sale sent home some disappointed bawlers,
Who bade on till the hundreds reached the eleven,
But when the offer went beyond, they knew
'Twas for the Sultan, and at once withdrew.
|''Don Juan'', canto IV, verse 114 }}

The legend of Circassian women was also repeated by legal theorist [[Gustav Hugo]], who wrote that "Even beauty is more likely to be found in a Circassian slave girl than in a beggar girl", referring to the fact that even a slave has some security and safety, but a "free" beggar has none. Hugo's comment was later condemned by [[Karl Marx]] in ''The Philosophical Manifesto of the Historical School of Law'' (1842) on the grounds that it excused slavery.&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Marx|Marx, Karl]], [http://marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1842/08/09.htm The Philosophical Manifesto of the Historical School of Law]", first appearing in Supplement to the ''Rheiniche Zeitung'' No. 221, 9 August 1842. (Excerpts online)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mark Twain]] reported in ''[[The Innocents Abroad]]'' (1869) that "Circassian and Georgian girls are still sold in [[Constantinople]] by their parents, but not publicly."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Twain |first=Mark |author-link=Mark Twain |date=1869 |chapter=34 |title=''[[The Innocents Abroad]]'' |publisher=American Publishing Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American travel author and diplomat [[Bayard Taylor]] in 1862 claimed that, "So far as female beauty is concerned, the Circassian women have no superiors. They have preserved in their mountain home the purity of the Grecian models, and still display the perfect physical loveliness, whose type has descended to us in the [[Venus de' Medici]]."&lt;ref name="Bayard Taylor"&gt;{{cite book |last=Taylor |first=Bayard |author-link=Bayard Taylor |date=1862 |chapter=Circassian Beauty |title=Prose Writings of Bayard Taylor |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5HN_v61_E-cC&amp;dq=So%20far%20as%20female%20beauty%20is%20concerned%2C%20the%20Circassian%20women%20have%20no%20superiors.&amp;hl=en&amp;pg=PA155#v=onepage&amp;q=So%20far%20as%20female%20beauty%20is%20concerned,%20the%20Circassian%20women%20have%20no%20superiors.&amp;f=false |volume=7 |publisher=[[G.

An anthropological literary suggests that Circassians were best characterized by what was called "rosy pale" or "translucent white skin". While most [[Circassians#Circassian tribes|Circassian tribes]] were famous for abundance of fair or dark blond and red hair combined with greyish-blue or green eyes,&lt;ref name=Osmanoglu&gt;{{cite book |last=Osmanoğlu |first=Ayşe |date=1960 |title=Babam Abdülhamid |location=Istanbul |publisher=Güven Yayınevi |page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; many also had the pairing of very dark hair with very light complexions, a typical feature of [[Peoples of the Caucasus]].&lt;ref name=ColarussoBeauties&gt;Colarusso, John 1989.

Pp. 644-651. Page 644: "The Circassians were famed throughout the Middle East for the beauty of their women and the courage of their men. Physically most Circassians are European in appearance with perhaps a slight oriental cast to their features. Many Circassians are blond and blue-eyed, while others show a common feature of the Caucasus: very light skin coupled with black or extremely dark hair. A lithe and erect physique were favored, both for the men and the woman, and many villages even today have large numbers of healthy elderly people, many over a hundred years of age."&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the Circassian women in the Ottoman harem were described as having "green eyes and long, dark blond hair, pale skin of translucent white colour, thin waist, slender body structure, and very good-looking hands and feet."&lt;ref name=Osmanoglu/&gt; The fact that Circassian women were traditionally encouraged to wear corsets in order to keep their posture straight might have shaped their [[wasp waist]] as a result. In the late 18th century, it was claimed by Western European coutouriers that "the Circassian Corset is the only one which displays, without indelicacy, the shape of the bosom to the greatest possible advantage; gives a width to the chest which is equally conducive to health and elegance of appearance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Morison |first=Stanley |author-link=Stanley Morison |year=2009 |orig-year=1930 |chapter=The Fair Circassian |title=[[John Bell (publisher)|John Bell]], 1745–1831: A Memoir |format=Paperback |location=Cambridge |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |publication-date=November 2009 |page=70 |isbn=978-0-521-14314-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''A Year Among the Circassians'', John Augustus Longworth describes a Circassian girl of typical Circassian features as the following: "She had regular and pretty features, blue eyes, and fair complexion; her hair was of a light auburn colour, and hung in a profusion of braided tresses over her shoulders, from a bonnet of scarlet cloth, trimmed and crossed with broad silver lace, not unlike the Albanian skull-cap. She was tall, and well, though slightly, shaped; and held herself, like all Circassians, men or women, very erect."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Longworth, Esq. |first=John Augustus |date=1840 |title=A Year Among the Circassians |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NYGeRLRf7xsC&amp;dq=entitled%20to%20rank%20as%20a%20Circassian%20beauty.%20She%20had%20regular%20and%20pretty%20features%2C%20blue%20eyes%2C%20and%20fair%20complexion&amp;pg=PA60#v=onepage&amp;q=entitled%20to%20rank%20as%20a%20Circassian%20beauty.%20She%20had%20regular%20and%20pretty%20features,%20blue%20eyes,%20and%20fair%20complexion&amp;f=false |location=London |publisher=Henry Colburn |volume=1 |page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also understood from the memoirs of Princess Emily Ruete, a half-Circassian and half-Omani herself, that Circassian women, who were captured in Constantinople and brought to Africa for the harem of Zanzibari [[Said bin Sultan, Sultan of Muscat and Oman]], were envied by their rivals who considered Circassians to be of the "hateful race of blue-eyed cats."

{{Quote|At [[Sultan's Palace, Zanzibar|Bet il Sahel]] there was much more luxury and grand style than at Bet il Mtoni. The handsome and graceful Circassian women were much more numerous than at Bet il Mtoni, where my mother and her lady friend Medîne were the only members of this race. Here the majority of the women were Circassian, who without any doubt are much more distinguished in appearance....This natural superiority was the cause of a good deal of ill-will and envy. One Circassian woman, favoured with an aristocratic appearance, was avoided and even hated by the chocolate-coloured Abyssinian women through no fault of hers, but simply because she looked majestic. Under these circumstances it was bound to happen that occasionally a kind of ridiculous "racism" broke out among my brothers and sisters....We, the children of Circassian women, were usually called "cats" by those of our brothers and sisters who had Abyssinian blood in their veins, because some of us had the misfortune of possessing: blue eyes. Derisively they called us "Highness", a proof of how annoyed they were about us having been born with lighter skin. My father was of course never forgiven the fact that he had chosen his favourite children Sharîfe and Chole—both by Circassian mothers, Sharîfe even being blue-eyed—from the hateful race of "cats".&lt;ref name="Princess Emily Ruete"&gt;{{cite book |last=Ruete |first=Princess Emily |author-link=Emily Ruete |date=1993 |original-date= |title=An Arabian Princess Between Two Worlds: Memoirs, Letters Home, Sequels to the Memoirs |chapter=3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mU2w8K8IyoEC&amp;lpg=PA176&amp;dq=The%20handsome%20and%20graceful%20Circassian%20women%20were%20much%20more%20numerous&amp;hl=en&amp;pg=PA176#v=onepage&amp;q=The%20handsome%20and%20graceful%20Circassian%20women%20were%20much%20more%20numerous&amp;f=false |editor=E.

Regarding one of her half-sisters who was also from a Circassian mother, Princess Ruete of Zanzibar mentions that, "The daughter of a Circassian was a dazzling beauty with the complexion of a German blonde. Besides, she possessed a sharp intellect, which made her into a faithful advisor of my father's."&lt;ref name="Princess Emily Ruete"/&gt;

The characteristics of Circassian and Northwest Georgian women were further articulated in 1839 by the author Emma Reeve who, as stated by Joan DelPlato, differentiated "between 'the blond Circassians' who are 'indolent and graceful, their voices low and sweet' and what she calls the slightly darker-skinned Georgians who are 'more animated' and have more 'intelligence and vivacity than their delicate rivals'."&lt;ref name="DelPlato"&gt;{{cite book |last=DelPlato |first=Joan |date=2002 |chapter=Chapter 2.

Similar descriptions of the Circassian women appear in [[Florence Nightingale]]'s travel journal where Nightingale called Circassians "the most graceful and the most sensual-looking creatures I ever saw".&lt;ref name="DelPlato"/&gt;

According to the feminist [[Harriet Martineau]], Circassians were the only saving virtue of the Egyptian harem where these Circassian mothers produced the finest children and if they were to be excluded from the harem, the upper class in Egypt would be doomed.&lt;ref name="DelPlato"/&gt;

In parts of Europe and North America where blond hair was more common, the pairing of extremely white skin with very dark hair also present among some Circassians was exalted, even in Russia which was [[Russo-Circassian War|at war with the Circassians]]; Semyon Bronevskii exalted Circassian women for having light skin, dark brown hair, dark eyes and "the lineaments of the face of the Ancient Greek".&lt;ref&gt;King, Charles (2008). ''The Ghost of Freedom''. Page 135&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the girls disguised as "Circassians" exhibited by [[Phineas T. Barnum]] were in fact Catholic [[Irish people|Irish girls]] from [[Lower Manhattan]].&lt;ref name=King139&gt;King, Charles (2008). ''The Ghost of Freedom''. Page 139&lt;/ref&gt;

Circassian men were also exalted for their beauty, manliness and bravery in Western Europe, in a way Caucasus historian Charles King calls "homoerotic".&lt;ref name=KingHomoerotic&gt;King, Charles (2008). ''The Ghost of Freedom''. Page 134&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Scotland]], in 1862, Circassian chiefs arrived to advocate their cause against Russia and to persuade Britain to stop the [[Circassian genocide|actions of the Russian army at that time]],&lt;ref&gt;Rosser-Owen (2007)."The First 'Circassian Exodus' to the Ottoman Empire (1858-1867)". Page 46&lt;/ref&gt; and upon the arrival of two Circassian leaders, Hadji Hayder Hassan and Kustan Ogli Ismael, the ''Dundee Advertiser'' reported that "the Chiefs are two remarkable looking men. Their imposing bearing, their romantic dress... and their natural dignity of mien, stamp them as very superior... Raven haired, black-bearded, broad-browed, with wide springing eyebrows of sooty black... these bronzed and armed children of the mountains tend to put us out of love with our own specimens of men, and suggests thoughts not complementary to the types of manhood which, in this country, they are surrounded."&lt;ref name=KingHomoerotic/&gt;

===Pseudoscientific explanations for the extreme white skin===
During the 19th century, various Western intellectuals offered [[Pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] explanations for the light complexion present among Circassians. The [[doctor of medicine]] [[Hugh Williamson]], a signatory to the [[United States Constitution]], argued that the reason for the extreme whiteness of the Circassian and coastal [[Celtic people|Celto]]-[[Germanic peoples]] can be explained by the geographical [[Location (geography)|location]] of these folks' ancestral homelands which lie in high latitudes ranging from 45° to 55° N near a sea or ocean where [[Prevailing Westerlies|Westerlies]] prevail from the west towards the east.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Williamson |first=Hugh |author-link=Hugh Williamson |date=1811 |title=Observations of the Climate in different parts of America, compared with the Climate in corresponding Parts of the other Continent |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This rule applies to Great Britain and Ireland, to the Germans, Danes, Swedes, and Circassians; but going to the eastward in the same latitude, as we depart from the ocean or the Black Sea, having more dry land to the windward, by which the air is charged with sun-dry exhalations, the skin changes its colour; it ceases to be perfectly fair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |editor1-last=Tilloch |editor1-first=Alexander |editor1-link=Alexander Tilloch |editor2-last=Taylor |editor2-first=Richard |editor2-link=Richard Taylor (editor) |date=1816 |title=XLIV.

==Pseudoscientific racialist theories==
By the early nineteenth century, Circassians were associated with theories of racial hierarchy, which elevated the Caucasus region as the source of the purest examples of the "white race", which was named the [[Caucasian race]] after the area by [[Johann Friedrich Blumenbach]]. Blumenbach theorised that the Circassians were the closest to God's original model of humanity, and thus "the purest and most beautiful whites were the Circassians".&lt;ref&gt;Winthrop Jordan, ''White over Black'', Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1968, pp. 222–3&lt;/ref&gt; This fuelled the idea of female Circassian beauty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chnm.gmu.edu/lostmuseum/searchlm.php?function=find&amp;exhibit=star&amp;browse=star |title=The Circassian Beauty Archive |publisher= |accessdate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1873, the decade after the expulsion of Circassians from the Caucasus where only a minority of them live today, it was argued that "the Caucasian Race receives its name from the Caucasus, the abode of the Circassians who are said to be the handsomest and best-formed nation, not only of this race, but of the whole human family."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cornell |first=Sarah S. |date=1873 |title=Cornell's Physical Geography: Accompanied with Nineteen Pages of Maps, a Great Variety of Map-questions, and One Hundred and Thirty Diagrams and Pictorial Illustrations, and Embracing a Detailed Description of the Physical Features of the United States |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p6waAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=The%20Caucasian%20Race%20receives%20its%20name%20from%20the%20Caucasus&amp;pg=PA75#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20abode%20of%20the%20Circassians,%20who%20are%20said%20to%20be%20the%20handsomest%20and%20best-formed%20nation,%20not%20only%20of%20this%20race,%20but%20of%20the%20whole%20human%20family&amp;f=false |publisher=[[Harvard University Press]] and [[D. Appleton &amp; Company]] |page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another anthropologist [[William Guthrie (historian)|William Guthrie]] distinguished the Caucasian race and the "Circassians who are admired for their beauty" in particular by their oval form of their head, straight nose, thin lips, vertically-placed teeth, facial angle from 80 to 90 degrees that he calls the most developed one, and their regular features overall, which "causes them to be considered as the most handsome and agreeable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Guthrie |first=William |author-link=William Guthrie (historian) |date=1843 |title=A new geographical, historical, and commercial grammar |editor=Richard Alfred Davenport |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bayard Taylor]] observed the Circassian women during his trip to the Ottoman Empire and argued that, "the Circassian face is a pure oval; the forehead is low and fair, an excellent thing in woman, and the skin of an ivory whiteness, except the faint pink of the cheeks and the ripe, roseate stain of the lips."&lt;ref name="Bayard Taylor"/&gt;

Circassians are depicted in images of harems at this time through these ideologies of racial hierarchy. [[John Frederick Lewis]]'s ''The Harem'' portrays Circassians as the dominant mistresses of the harem, who look down on other women, as implied in the review of the painting in ''[[The Art Journal]]'', which described it as follows,

&lt;blockquote&gt;It represents the interior of a harem at Cairo, wherein is seated in luxurious ease a young Turk, attired in the excess of Moslem fashion. Near him, and reclining upon cushions, are two Circassian women, also dressed in the extremity of Oriental taste... On the right is seen a tall Nubian eunuch, who removes from the shoulders of an Egyptian slave the shawl by which she had been covered, in order to show her to the master of the harem; this figure with her high shoulders and the characteristics of her features, is a most successful national impersonation. The Circassian women look languidly to the Egyptian with an expression of supreme contempt, which is responded to by a sneer on the face of the Nubian eunuch.&lt;ref&gt;''Art Journal'', Review of the Old Water-colour Society Exhibition, 1850&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Orientalizing paintings of nudes were also sometimes exhibited as "Circassians".

The Circassians became major news during the [[Caucasian War]], in which [[Russia]] conquered the North Caucasus, displacing large numbers of Circassians southwards. In 1856 ''[[The New York Times]]'' published a report entitled "Horrible Traffic in Circassian Women — Infanticide in Turkey", asserting that a consequence of the Russian conquest of the Caucasus was an excess of beautiful Circassian women on the [[Constantinople]] slave market, and that this was causing prices of slaves in general to plummet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chnm.gmu.edu/lostmuseum/lm/311/ Horrible Traffic in Circassian Women—Infanticide in Turkey]; ''New York Daily Times'', 6 August 1856&lt;/ref&gt; The story drew on ideas of racial hierarchy, stating that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The temptation to possess a Circassian girl at such low prices is so great in the minds of the Turks that many who cannot afford to keep several slaves have been sending their blacks to market, in order to make room for a newly purchased white girl.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The article also claimed that children born to the "inferior" black concubines were being killed. This story drew widespread attention to the area, as did later conflicts.

At the same time writers and illustrators were also creating images depicting the authentic costumes and people of the Caucasus. [[Francis Davis Millet]] depicted Circassian women during his 1877 coverage of the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)|Russo-Turkish war]], specifying local costume and hairstyle.

==Advertising of beauty products==
[[File:Circassian hair dye.jpg|thumb|A poster from c. 1843 advertising Circassian Hair Dye]]

An advertisement from 1782 titled "Bloom of Circassia" makes clear that it was by then well established "that the Circassians are the most beautiful Women in the World", but goes on to reveal that they "derive not all their Charms from Nature". They used a concoction supposedly extracted from a vegetable native to Circassia. Knowledge of this "Liquid Bloom" had been brought back by a "well-regarded gentleman" who had traveled and lived in the region. It "instantly gives a Rosy Hue to the Cheeks", a "lively and animated Bloom of Rural Beauty" that would not disappear in perspiration or handkerchiefs.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom of Circassia, ''New-York Gazette'', 2 September 1782&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1802 "the Balm of Mecca" was also marketed as being used by Circassians: "This delicate as well as fragrant composition has been long celebrated as the summit of cosmetics by all the Circassian and Georgian women in the seraglio of the Grand Sultan". It claims that the product was endorsed by Lady [[Mary Wortley Montague]] who stated that it was very helpful "for removing those sebacious impurities so noxious to beauty". The article continues: "Any lady must be as great an Infidel as the Grand Sultan himself, who, after receiving such authority can doubt that her skin will become as superlatively smooth, soft, white and delicate, as that of the lovely Fatima, whatever may have been its feel or its appearance before. What fair one but must yield implicit faith, when she has the honour of the Countess De --- fairly pledged, that all sepacious [sic] impurities will be at once removed by this wonder-working nostrum. And above all, who but must long for an article, from the seraglio of the Grand Turk, which produces a near resemblance to the Georgian and Circassian beauties?"&lt;ref&gt;To the Ladies, ''New-York Herald'', 14 July 1802&lt;/ref&gt;

"Circassian Lotion" was sold in 1806 for the skin, at fifty cents the bottle. "A sovereign remedy for surfeits, scorching from the heat of the sun, freckles, blights from cold and chills of winter, scorbutic, pimples or eruptions of the face and skin, however violent or disfigured, animalcula generated under the cuticle or outer skin, prickley heat, shingles, ring worms, redness of the nose and chin, obstinate cutaneous diseases, and for every impurity or unnatural appearance with which the skin may be affected; to be used as a common wash for clearing and improving the complexion, and in a superior degree to preserve, soften, cleanse and beautify the skin".&lt;ref&gt;''Morning Chronicle' (NYC), 20 September 1806&lt;/ref&gt;

"Circassian Eye-Water" was marketed as "a sovereign remedy for all diseases of the eyes",&lt;ref&gt;Delaware Gazette and State Journal, 2 February 1815&lt;/ref&gt; and in the 1840s "Circassian hair dye" was marketed to create a rich dark lustrous effect.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas M Barrett (1998), Southern Living (in Captivity): The Caucasus in Russian Popular Culture, ''The Journal of Popular Culture'' 31 (4), 75–93.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nineteenth-century sideshow attraction==
[[Image:Circassian.jpg|thumb|As a sideshow attraction, Circassian beauties were women with [[big hair]], a reference to the teased hair they wore, held in place by beer. Circassian ancestry was not required as in this example.]]

The combination of the popular issues of [[slavery]], the [[Orient]], racial ideology, and sexual titillation gave the reports of Circassian women sufficient notoriety at the time that the [[circus]] leader [[P. T. Barnum]] decided to capitalize on this interest. He displayed a "Circassian Beauty" at his [[Barnum's American Museum|American Museum]] in 1865. Barnum's Circassian beauties were young women with tall, teased hairstyles, rather like the [[Afro]] style of the 1970s.&lt;ref name="lind"&gt;Linda Frost, ''Never one nation: freaks, savages, and whiteness in U.S. popular culture, 1850–1877'', [[University of Minnesota Press]], 2005, pp. 68–88&lt;/ref&gt; Actual Circassian hairstyles bore no resemblance to Barnum's fantasy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://etc.usf.edu/clipart/23800/23851/Circassian_23851.htm |title=Circassian |publisher= |accessdate=22 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barnum's first "Circassian" was marketed under the name "[http://chnm.gmu.edu/lostmuseum/lm/344/ Zalumma Agra]" and was exhibited at his American Museum in New York from 1864. Barnum had written to John Greenwood, his agent in Europe, asking him to purchase a beautiful Circassian girl to exhibit, or at least to hire a girl who could "pass for" one. However, it seems that "Zalumma Agra" was probably a local girl hired by the show, as were later "Circassians".&lt;ref&gt;[[Rosemarie Garland-Thomson]], ''Freakery: Cultural Spectacles of the Extraordinary Body'', [[New York University Press]], 1996, pp. 249–50&lt;/ref&gt; Barnum also produced a booklet about another of his Circassians, Zoe Meleke, who was portrayed as an ideally beautiful and refined woman who had escaped a life of sexual slavery.

The portrayal of a white woman as a rescued slave at the time of the [[American Civil War]] played on the racial connotations of slavery at the time. It has been argued that the distinctive hairstyle affiliates the side-show Circassian with African identity, and thus,

&lt;blockquote&gt;resonates oddly yet resoundingly with the rest of her identifying significations: her racial purity, her sexual enslavement, her position as colonial subject; her beauty. The Circassian blended elements of white Victorian True Womanhood with traits of the enslaved African American woman in one curiosity.&lt;ref name="lind"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The trend spread, with supposedly Circassian women featured in [[dime museum]]s and travelling [[medicine show]]s, sometimes known as "Moss-haired girls". They were typically identified by the distinctive hairstyle, which was held in place by the use of beer. They also often performed in pseudo-oriental costume. Many postcards of Circassians also circulated. Though Barnum's original women were portrayed as proud and genteel, later images of Circassians often emphasised erotic poses and revealing costumes.&lt;ref name="lind"/&gt; As the original fad faded, the "Circassians" started to add to their appeal by performing traditional circus tricks such as [[sword swallowing]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert Bogdan, ''Freak Show: Presenting Human Oddities for Amusement and Profit'', [[University of Chicago Press]], 1990, p. 240&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
*[[The Safety Fire]], British [[progressive metal]] band, released their song "[[Grind the Ocean|Circassian Beauties]]" in 2012.
*The American [[alternative rock]] band [[Monks of Doom]] released another song with the title "Circassian Beauty" in their 1991 album ''Meridian''.

The '''Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit''' is a branch of the [[United Kingdom|UK]] [[Medical Research Council (UK)|Medical Research Council]], based in [[Cambridge]], [[England]]. The CBSU is a world-leading centre for cognitive neuroscience, with a mission to improve human health by understanding and enhancing cognition and behaviour in health, disease and disorder. It is one of the largest and most long-lasting contributors to the development of psychological theory and practice. 

The CBSU has its own [[Magnetic Resonance Imaging]] (MRI, 3T) scanner on-site, as well as a 306-channel [[Magnetoencephalography]] (MEG) system and a 128-channel [[Electroencephalography]] (EEG) laboratory.

The CBSU is now an internationally leading centre for research in the cognitive sciences and neurosciences, with close links to clinical neuroscience research in the University of Cambridge Medical School. Over 140 scientists, students, and support staff work in research areas such as Memory, Attention, Emotion, Speech and Language, Development and Aging, Computational Modelling and Neuroscience Methods. With dedicated facilities available on site, the Unit has particular strengths in the application of neuroimaging techniques in the context of well-developed neuro-cognitive theory.

== History ==

The unit was established in 1944 as the '''MRC Applied Psychology Unit'''.&lt;ref name="HoMBRG"&gt;{{cite Q|Q29581668}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2001, the [[History of Modern Biomedicine Research Group]] held a [[witness seminar]] to gather information on the unit's history.&lt;ref name="HoMBRG" /&gt;

On 1 July 2017, the CBU was merged with the University of Cambridge. Coming under the Clinical School, the unit is still funded by the British government through Research Councils UK but is managed and maintained by Cambridge University.

In [[computer security]] a '''countermeasure''' is an action, [[peripheral|device]], [[Procedure (term)|procedure]], or technique that reduces a [[Threat (computer)|threat]], a [[Vulnerability (computing)|vulnerability]], or an [[attack (computing)|attack]] by eliminating or preventing it, by minimizing the [[harm]] it can cause, or by discovering and reporting it so that corrective action can be taken.

The definition is as [[IETF]] RFC 2828&lt;ref name=rfc2828&gt;RFC 2828 Internet Security Glossary&lt;/ref&gt; that is the same as CNSS Instruction No. 4009 dated 26 April 2010 by [[Committee on National Security Systems]] of United States of America.&lt;ref name=CNSSI4009&gt;[http://www.cnss.gov/Assets/pdf/cnssi_4009.pdf CNSS Instruction No. 4009] dated 26 April 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Glossary&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infosectoday.com/Articles/Glossary.pdf InfosecToday Glossary]&lt;/ref&gt; by [http://www.infosectoday.com InfosecToday], the meaning of countermeasure is:
:The deployment of a set of security services to protect against a security threat.

A synonym is [[Security controls|security control]].&lt;ref name=CNSSI4009/&gt;&lt;ref name=Vacca&gt;{{cite book

In telecommunications, communication countermeasures are defined as [[Security service (telecommunication)|security services]] as part of [[OSI model|OSI Reference model]] by ITU-T X.800 Recommendation.
X.800 and ISO ISO 7498-2 (Information processing systems – Open systems interconnection – Basic Reference Model – Part 2: Security architecture are technically aligned.

The following picture explain the relationships between these concepts and terms:
&lt;pre&gt;

A resource (both physical or logical) can have one or more vulnerabilities that can be exploited by a threat agent in a threat action. The result can potentially compromises the [[confidentiality]], [[integrity]] or [[availability]] properties of resources (potentially different that the vulnerable one) of the organization and others involved parties (customers, suppliers).&lt;br /&gt;
The so-called CIA triad is the basis of [[information security]].

The attack can be active when it attempts to alter system resources or affect their operation: so it compromises integrity or availability. A "passive attack" attempts to learn or make use of information from the system but does not affect system resources, compromising confidentiality.

A threat is a potential for violation of security, which exists when there is a circumstance, capability, action, or event that could breach security and cause harm. That is, a threat is a possible danger enabling the exploitation of a vulnerability. A threat can be either "intentional" (i.e., intelligent; e.g., an individual cracker or a criminal organization) or "accidental" (e.g., the possibility of a computer malfunctioning, or the possibility of an "act of God" such as an earthquake, a fire, or a tornado).&lt;ref name=rfc2828/&gt;

A set of policies concerned with information security management, the [[information security management system]]s (ISMS), has been developed to manage, according to [[risk management]] principles, the countermeasures in order to accomplish to a security strategy set up following rules and regulations applicable in a country.&lt;ref name=Vacca/&gt;

== Countermeasures Against Physical Attacks ==
If a potential malicious actor has physical access to a computer system, they have a greater chance of inflicting harm upon it.

=== Electronic Destruction Devices ===
Devices such as a [[USB Killer]] may be used to damage or render completely unusable anything with a connection to the [[motherboard]] of a computer, such as a USB port, video port, Ethernet port, or serial port.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2016/12/usb-killer-fries-devices/|title=USB Killer, yours for $50, lets you easily fry almost every device|work=Ars Technica|access-date=2018-08-26|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; Without proper protection, these devices may result in the destruction of ports, [[Expansion card|adapter cards]], storage devices, [[Random-access memory|RAM]], motherboards, CPUs, or anything physically connected to the device attacked, such as monitors, flash drives, or [[Network switch|wired switches]]. These types of devices can even be used to damage smartphones and cars, as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.techfonder.com/2017/10/this-50-usb-killer-can-destroy-your-every-device-in-seconds.html|title=This $50 USB Killer Can Destroy Almost Any Smartphone, Computer Or Car Within Seconds|work=TechFonder|access-date=2018-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This threat can be mitigated by not installing or restricting physical access to easily accessible ports in situations where they are not necessary. A port-closing lock which permanently disables access to a port short of the actual port being disassembled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mouser.com/blog/protect-usb-ports-from-nefarious-usb-killers|title=Bench Talk {{!}} Protect USB Ports From Nefarious “USB Killers"|website=www.mouser.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; When it is necessary for a port to be accessible, an [[Opto-isolator|optocoupler]] can allow for a port to send and receive data to a computer or device without a direct electrical connection, preventing the computer or device from receiving any dangerous voltage from an external device.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.electronics-tutorials.ws/blog/optocoupler.html|title=Optocoupler Tutorial|last=|first=|date=|website=ElectronicsTutorials|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hard Drives and Storage ===
In an unsecured scenario, a malicious actor may steal or destroy storage devices such as hard drives or SSDs, resulting in the destruction or theft of valuable data.

If the data of a storage device is no longer necessary, data theft is best prevented against by physically destroying or shredding the storage device.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.computerweekly.com/feature/Discarded-hard-drives-can-be-dangerous|title=Discarded hard drives can be dangerous|work=ComputerWeekly.com|access-date=2018-08-26|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the data of a storage device is in use and must be secured, one can use encryption to encrypt the contents of a storage device, or even [[Disk encryption#Full disk encryption|encrypt the whole storage device]] save for the master boot record. The device can then be unlocked with a password, [[biometric authentication]], a physical dongle, a network interchange, a [[one-time password]], or any combination thereof. If this device is a boot drive, however, it must be unencrypted in a pre-boot environment so the operating system can be accessed. [[Data striping|Striping]], or breaking data into chunks stored upon multiple drives which must be assemble in order to access the data, is a possible solution to physical drive theft, provided that the drives are stored in multiple, individually secured locations, and are enough in number that no one drive can be used to piece together meaningful information.

Not the be neglected is the process of adding physical barriers to the storage devices themselves. Locked cases or physically hidden drives, with a limited amount of personnel with knowledge and access to the keys or locations, may prove to be a good first line against physical theft.

'''Digital artifact''' in information science, is any undesired or unintended alteration in data introduced in a digital process by an involved technique and/or technology. In anthropology and archeology a digital artifact is an artifact that is of a digital nature or creation. For example, a gif is such an artifact.  

Digital artifact can be of any content types including text, audio, video, image, animation or a combination. 

== Information science ==
In information science, digital artifacts result from:
*Hardware malfunction: In computer graphics, [[visual artifact]]s may be generated whenever a hardware component such as the processor, memory chip, cabling malfunctions, etc., corrupts data. Examples of malfunctions include physical damage, overheating, insufficient voltage and [[GPU]] [[overclocking]]. Common types of hardware artifacts are [[Texture mapping|texture]] corruption and [[T-vertices]] in 3D graphics, and [[pixelization]] in MPEG compressed video.
*Software malfunction: Artifacts may be caused by algorithm flaws such as decoding/encoding audio or video, or a poor pseudo-random number generator that would introduce artifacts distinguishable from the desired noise into statistical models.
*[[Compression artifact|Compression]]: Controlled amounts of unwanted information may be generated as a result of the use of [[lossy compression]] techniques. One example is the artifacts seen in [[JPEG]] and [[MPEG]] compression algorithms that produce [[compression artifact|compression artifacts]].
*[[Aliasing]]: Digital imprecision generated in the process of converting analog information into digital space is due to the limited granularity of digital numbering space. In computer graphics, aliasing is seen as [[pixelation]].
*[[Rolling shutter]], the line scanning of an object that is moving too fast for the image sensor to capture a unitary image.
*[[Error diffusion]]: poorly-weighted kernel coefficients result in undesirable visual artifacts.

The '''Dolch word list''' is a list of frequently used [[English language|English]] words compiled by Edward William Dolch, a major proponent of the [[Whole-word method|"whole-word" method]] of beginning reading instruction. The list was first published in a journal article in 1936&lt;ref&gt;Dolch, E. W. "A Basic Sight Vocabulary." ''The Elementary School Journal'', vol. 36, no. 6, 1936, pp.456-460.&lt;/ref&gt; and then published in his book ''Problems in Reading'' in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;Dolch, Edward William. ''Problems in Reading''. Garrard Press, 1948, pp.99-106.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Dolch compiled the list based on children's books of his era, which is why nouns such as "kitty" and "Santa Claus" appear on the list instead of more high-frequency words. The list contains 220 "service words" that have to be easily recognized in order to achieve reading fluency in the English language. The compilation excludes [[noun]]s, which comprise a separate 95-word list. Between 50% and 75% of all words used in schoolbooks, library books, newspapers, and magazines are a part of the Dolch basic [[sight word]] vocabulary.

These lists of words are still assigned for memorization in American elementary schools. Although most of the 220 Dolch words are phonetic, children are sometimes told that they can't be "sounded out" using common sound-to-letter [[analytical phonics|implicit]] [[phonics]] patterns and have to be learned by sight; hence the alternative term, "sight word". The list is divided according to the grades in which it was intended that children would memorize these words.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13208">'''ERP Security''' is a wide range of measures aimed at protecting [[Enterprise resource planning]] (ERP) systems from illicit access ensuring accessibility and integrity of system data. ERP system is a computer software that serves to unify the information intended to manage the company including Production, [[Supply Chain Management]], [[Financial Management]], [[Human Resource Management]], [[Customer Relationship Management]], [[Enterprise Performance Management]], etc. Common ERP systems are [[SAP ERP|SAP]], [[Oracle E-Business Suite]], [[Microsoft Dynamics]].&lt;ref name="ERP"&gt; {{cite news |title=ERP (enterprise resource planning) |url=https://searcherp.techtarget.com/definition/ERP-enterprise-resource-planning |newspaper=SearchERP TechTarget|date=May 2017 |accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Review == 
ERP system integrates business processes enabling procurement, payment, transport, human resources management, product management, and financial planning.&lt;ref name="Oracle"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.oracle.com/applications/erp/what-is-erp.html|title=What Is ERP?|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As ERP system stores confidential information, [[ISACA]] recommends to regularly conduct a comprehensive assessment of ERP system security, checking ERP servers for software vulnerabilities, configuration errors, segregation of duties conflicts, compliance with relevant standards and recommendations, and recommendations of vendors.&lt;ref&gt;Security issues in ERP http://www.isaca.org/Knowledge-Center/Research/ResearchDeliverables/Pages/sap-erp.aspx &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Information Age"&gt; {{cite news |title=Why security should be a priority for an ERP ecosystem |url=http://www.information-age.com/security-priority-erp-ecosystem-123468295/ |newspaper=Information Age|date=31 August 2017 |accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes for vulnerabilities in ERP systems == 

=== Complexity ===
ERP systems process transactions and implement procedures to ensure that users have different access privileges. There are hundreds of authorization objects in SAP permitting users to perform actions in the system. In case of 200 users of the company, there are approximately 800,000 (100*2*20*200) ways to customize security settings of ERP systems.&lt;ref&gt;ERP Security and Segregation of Duties Audit: A Framework for Building an Automated Solution https://csbweb01.uncw.edu/people/ivancevichd/classes/MSA%20516/Extra%20Readings%20on%20Topics/Database/ERP%20Security.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; With the growth of complexity, the possibility of errors and segregation of duties conflicts increases.&lt;ref&gt;Security issues in ERP http://www.isaca.org/Knowledge-Center/Research/ResearchDeliverables/Pages/sap-erp.aspx &lt;/ref&gt;

=== Specificity === 
Vendors fix vulnerabilities on the regular basis since hackers monitor business applications to find and exploit security issues. SAP releases patches monthly on [[Patch Tuesday]], Oracle issues security fixes every quarter in [https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/topics/security/alerts-086861.html Oracle Critical Patch Update]. Business applications are becoming more exposed to the Internet or migrate to the cloud.&lt;ref name="Forbes"&gt; {{cite news |title=ERP Security Deserves Our Attention Now More Than Ever |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2017/07/07/erp-security-deserves-our-attention-now-more-than-ever/ |newspaper=Forbes |date=7 July 2017|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lack of competent specialists === 
ERP Cybersecurity survey&lt;ref&gt;ERP Cybersecurity survey 2017 https://erpscan.com/research/white-papers/erp-cybersecurity-survey-2017/&lt;/ref&gt; revealed that organizations running ERP systems "lack both awareness and actions taken towards ERP security".&lt;ref name="CSO"&gt; {{cite news |title=Survey reveals the damage of fraud attacks against SAP system is estimated at $10m |url=https://www.cso.com.au/article/621185/survey-reveals-damage-fraud-attacks-against-sap-system-estimated-10m/|newspaper=CSO from IDG |date=27 June 2017|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
ISACA states that "there is a shortage of staff members trained in ERP security"&lt;ref&gt;ERP Security and Segregation of Duties Audit: A Framework for Building an Automated Solution https://csbweb01.uncw.edu/people/ivancevichd/classes/MSA%20516/Extra%20Readings%20on%20Topics/Database/ERP%20Security.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and security services have the superficial understanding of risks and threats associated with ERP systems. Consequently, security vulnerabilities complicate undertakings such as detecting and subsequent fixing.&lt;ref name="Forbes"&gt; {{cite news |title=ERP Security Deserves Our Attention Now More Than Ever |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2017/07/07/erp-security-deserves-our-attention-now-more-than-ever/ |newspaper=Forbes |date=7 July 2017|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CloudComputing"&gt; {{cite news |title=Six classic ERP system security problems – and how to avoid them |url=https://www.cloudcomputing-news.net/news/2017/may/10/six-classic-erp-system-security-problems-and-how-avoid-them/ |newspaper=CloudTech|date=10 May 2017|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Lack of security auditing tools  === 
ERP security audit is done manually as various tools with ERP packages do not provide means for system security auditing. Manual auditing is a complex and time-consuming process that increases the possibility of making a mistake.&lt;ref&gt;Security issues in ERP http://www.isaca.org/Knowledge-Center/Research/ResearchDeliverables/Pages/sap-erp.aspx &lt;/ref&gt;

=== Large number of customized settings ===  
The system includes thousands of parameters and fine settings including segregation of duties for transactions and tables, and the security parameters are set for every single system. ERP system settings are customized according to customers' requirements.

== Security issues in ERP systems == 
Security issues occur in ERP systems at different levels.

=== Network layer  === 
'''Traffic interception and modification''' 
* absence of data encryption 
In 2011, Sensepost specialists analyzed DIAG protocol used in SAP ERP system for transferring data from the client to the SAP server. Two utilities were published that allowed to intercept, decrypt, and modify client-server requests containing critical information. This made attacks possible including [[Man-in-the-middle attack]]. The second utility operates like a Proxy and was created to identify new vulnerabilities. It allowed modifying requests coming to client and server.&lt;ref&gt;[http://erpscan.ru/press-center/press-release/erpscan-warns-about-new-vulnerabilities-of-diag-protocol-in-sap/ ERPScan warns about new vulnerabilities of DIAG protocol in SAP]&lt;/ref&gt;
* sending password in cleartext (SAP J2EE Telnet / Oracle listener old versions) 
In the SAP ERP system, it is possible to perform administering functions via [[Telnet]] protocol, which encrypts passwords.

''Vulnerabilities in encryption or authentication protocols''' 
* authentification by hash 
* XOR password encryption (SAP DIAG) 
* imposing the use of outdated authentication protocols
* incorrect authentication protocols 

'''Vulnerabilities in protocols (e.g. RFC in SAP ERP and Oracle Net in Oracle E-Business Suite).''' 
RFC protocol is used (Remote Function Call) to connect two systems by TCP/IP in SAP ERP. RFC call is a function that enables calling and running a functional module located in a system. The [[ABAP]] language that is used for writing business applications for SAP have functions to make RFC calls. Several critical vulnerabilities were found in SAP RFC Library versions 6.x and 7.x&lt;ref&gt;SAP RFC Library Multiple Vulnerabilities http://www.cnet.com/forums/post/7986898c-0a03-43d4-af70-b8427164c8e2&lt;/ref&gt;:  
* RFC function "RFC_SET_REG_SERVER_PROPERTY" allows determining an exclusive use of RFC server. Vulnerability exploits lead to a denial of access for the legitimate users. [[DoS-attack|denial of service]] becomes possible. 
* Error in RFC function "SYSTEM_CREATE_INSTANCE". Exploiting vulnerability allows executing arbitrary code. 
* Error in RFC function "RFC_START_GUI". Exploiting vulnerability also allows executing arbitrary code. 
* Error in RFC function "RFC_START_PROGRAM".  Exploiting vulnerability allows executing arbitrary code or gain information about RFC server configuration. 
* Error in RFC function "TRUSTED_SYSTEM_SECURITY". Exploiting vulnerability allows obtaining information about existing users and groups in RFC server.

=== Operating system level === 
OS software vulnerabilities 
* any remote vulnerability in OS is used to gain access to applications 

Weak OS passwords 
* remote password brute-forcing 
* empty passwords for remote management tools like RAdmin and [[VNC]] 

Insecure OS settings 
* NFS and SMB. SAP data becomes accessible to remote users via NFS an SMB 
* file access rights. Critical SAP and DBMS Oracle data files have insecure access rights such as 755 and 777 
* insecure hosts settings. In the trusted hosts, servers can be listed and an attacker easily accesses them

=== Application vulnerabilities === 
ERP systems transfer more functionality on the web applications level with a lot of vulnerabilities:  
* Web application vulnerabilities ([[XSS]], [[XSRF]], [[SQL Injection]], Response Splitting, Code Execution) 
* Buffer overflow and format string  in web-servers and application-servers (SAP IGS, SAP Netweaver, Oracle BEA Weblogic) 
* Insecure privileges for access (SAP Netweaver, SAP CRM, Oracle E-Business Suite)

== Role-based access control == 
In ERP systems, RBAC ([[Role-Based Access Control]]) model is applied for users to perform transactions and gain access to business objects.&lt;ref&gt;Security for Enterprise Resource Planning Systems http://www.utdallas.edu/~bxt043000/Publications/Journal-Papers/DAS/J46_Security_for_Enterprise_Resource_Planning_Systems.pdf &lt;/ref&gt;
In the model, the decision to grant access to a user is made based on the functions of users, or roles. Roles are a multitude of transactions the user or a group of users performs in the company. Transaction is a procedure of transforming system data, which helps perform this transaction. For any role, there is a number of corresponding users with one or multiple roles. Roles can be hierarchical. After the roles are implemented in the system, transactions corresponding to each role rarely change. The administrator needs to add or delete users from roles. The administrator provides a new user with a membership in one or more roles. When employees leave the organization, the administrator removes them from all the roles.&lt;ref&gt;Role-Based Access Controls http://csrc.nist.gov/rbac/ferraiolo-kuhn-92.pdf &lt;/ref&gt;

== Segregation of Duties == 
Segregation or [[Separation of duties]], also known as SoD, is the concept according to which a user cannot make a transaction without other users (e.g. a user cannot add a new supplier, write out a cheque or pay to a supplier)&lt;ref&gt;ISACA Glossary Terms http://www.isaca.org/Knowledge-Center/Lists/ISACA%20Glossary%20Terms/DispForm.aspx?ID=1700&lt;/ref&gt; and a risk of fraud is much lower.&lt;ref&gt;A risk-based approach
to segregation of duties http://www.ey.com/Publication/vwLUAssets/EY_Segregation_of_duties/$FILE/EY_Segregation_of_dutie/s.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; SoD can be implemented by RBAC mechanisms, and a notion of mutually exclusive roles is introduced. For instance, to pay a supplier, one user initiates payment procedure and another accepts it.&lt;ref&gt;R. A. Botha and J. H. P. Eloff [http://www.research.ibm.com/journal/sj/403/botha.html Separation of Duties for Access Control Enforcement in Workflow Environments]&lt;/ref&gt; In this case, initiating payment and accepting are mutually exclusive roles. Segregation of duties can be either static or dynamic. With static SoD (SSoD), a user cannot belong to two mutually exclusive roles. With dynamic SoD (DSoD), a user does but cannot perform them within one transaction. Both of them have their own advantages. SSoD is simple, while DSoD is flexible.&lt;ref&gt;Simple Search http://www.bth.se/fou/cuppsats.nsf/all/52d12689b4758c84c12572a600386f1d/$file/mcs-2006-16.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Segregation of Duties is explained in SoD matrix. X and Y matrixes describe system roles. If the two roles are mutually exclusive, there is a flag at the interception of the corresponding rows and columns.

== ERP Security scanners == 
ERP Security scanner is a software intended to search for vulnerabilities in ERP systems. Scanner analyzes configurations of ERP system, searches for misconfigurations, access control and encryption conflicts, insecure components, and checks for updates. The scanner checks system parameters for compliance with the manufacturer's recommendations and auditing procedures [[:en:ISACA|ISACA]]. ERP Security scanners produce reports with the vulnerabilities listed according to their criticality.
The examples of scanners: 
* [http://erpscan.com ERPScan] for [[SAP ERP|SAP]] ERP 
* [http://www.onapsis.com Onapsis] for [[SAP ERP|SAP]] ERP 
* [http://www.integrigy.com/products/appsentry AppSentry] for [[Oracle E-Business Suite]] 
* [http://www.ptsecurity.ru MaxPatrol] for [[SAP ERP|SAP]] ERP

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1529">The '''Fairfield experiment''' was an experiment in industrial relations carried out at the [[Fairfield Shipbuilding and Engineering Company]], [[Glasgow]] during the 1960s. The experiment was agreed by [[George Brown, Baron George-Brown|George Brown]], the [[First Secretary]] in [[Harold Wilson]]'s cabinet, in 1966.

{{Usul al-fiqh}}
A '''Faqeeh''' (plural ''Fuqahā'', {{lang-ar|[[wikt:فقيه|فقيه]], pl. فقهاء}}) is an ''Islamic jurist'', an expert in [[fiqh]], or [[Islam]]ic [[jurisprudence]] and [[Islamic Law]].

==Definition==
{{main article|fiqh}}

[[Islam]]ic [[jurisprudence]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/207723/fiqh Fiqh] Encyclopædia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt; or fiqh is the human understanding of the [[Sharia]] (believed by Muslims to represent divine law as revealed in the [[Quran]] and the ''[[Sunnah]]'' (the teachings and practices of the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]]))&lt;ref name=vogel&gt;{{cite book|last=Vogel|first=Frank E.|title=Islamic Law and the Legal System of Saudí: Studies of Saudi Arabia|date=2000|publisher=Brill|pages=4–5|url=https://books.google.com/?id=-PfDuvnHMGoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=vogel+islamic+law#v=onepage&amp;q=vogel%20islamic%20law&amp;f=false|isbn=9004110623}}&lt;/ref&gt; —sharia expanded and developed by interpretation (''[[ijtihad]]'') of the Quran and ''Sunnah'' by Islamic jurists (''[[Ulema]]'')&lt;ref name=vogel/&gt; and implemented by the rulings (''[[Fatwa]]'') of jurists on questions presented to them.

''Fiqh'' deals with the observance of rituals, morals and social legislation in Islam. In the modern era there are four prominent schools (''[[madh'hab]]'') of ''fiqh'' within [[Sunni]] practice and two (or three) within [[Shi'a]] practice.&lt;ref&gt;Glasse, Cyril, ''The New Encyclopedia of Islam'', Altamira, 2001, p.141&lt;/ref&gt;

The historian [[Ibn Khaldun]] describes ''fiqh'' as "knowledge of the rules of God which concern the actions of persons who own themselves bound to obey the law respecting what is required (''[[wajib]]''), sinful (''[[haraam]]''), recommended (''[[mustahab|mandūb]]''), disapproved (''[[makrūh]]'') or neutral (''[[mubah]]'')".&lt;ref&gt;Levy (1957). Page 150.&lt;/ref&gt; This definition is consistent amongst the jurists.

Another definition of ''Fiqh'' is "Knowledge of legislative rulings, pertaining to the actions of man, as derived from their detailed evidences."&lt;ref name=Kulseth-440&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kulseth|first1=P. M.|title=Redeemed: The Saga of Eyja's Family in Iceland and the Muslim World|date=2010|publisher=Xlibris Corporation|page=440|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PqkZp1ElMmcC&amp;pg=PA440&amp;dq=fiqh+Knowledge+of+legislative+rulings,+pertaining+to+the+actions+of+man,+as+derived+from+their+detailed+evidences&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAGoVChMIiP3lg9XqxwIVTwWSCh21vwQf#v=onepage&amp;q=fiqh%20Knowledge%20of%20legislative%20rulings%2C%20pertaining%20to%20the%20actions%20of%20man%2C%20as%20derived%20from%20their%20detailed%20evidences&amp;f=false|accessdate=9 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}}

*"Legislative rulings..." here excludes rulings that are purely theoretical in nature, such as those found in the science of ''Usul Al Fiqh'', as well as those theological in nature, generally discussed in the books of [[Aqidah]] or [[Kalam]].
*"derived from their detailed evidences" here connotes two things:
#that there is a method of derivation; and,
#that the source for such derivation are the various evidences considered valid Islamically.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

==Methods of derivation==
Methods of derivation are laid out in the books of ''Usul Al Fiqh'' (principles of fiqh), and those evidences which are deemed valid for deriving rulings from are many in number. Four of them are agreed upon by the vast Majority of Jurists, they are:
* The [[Qur'an]]
* The [[Hadith|Sunnah]]
* [[Ijma']] or Consensus
* [[Qiyas]] or Analogy

These four types of evidence are seen as acceptable by the vast majority of Jurists from both the schools of [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] Jurists (the [[Hanafi]], [[Maliki]], [[Shafi'i]], and [[Hanbali]] and sometimes the [[Zahiriyah]]), as well as [[Shi'a Islam|Shi'a]] Jurists.  However, [[Zahiriyah]] or Literalists do not see [[Qiyas]] as valid.

While Twelver Shia see edicts of the [[Twelvers|Twelve]] Imams as holding the same weight as the Quran and Sunnah, this is unacceptable by Sunni Jurists.

==Conditions for being a Faqeeh==
The Faqeeh is one who has fulfilled the conditions for [[Ijtihad]] either in their entirety or in piecemeal.  In the Sunni point of view it is generally held that there are either no (or very few) Jurists or Fuqaha that have reached the level of Mujtahid Mutlaq in our day and age. In the [[Twelver]] (Ithna Asheri) Shia view, each of their [[Marja']] have reached this level.

The Faqeeh who fulfills all conditions of Ijtihad is sometimes referred to as a ''Mujtahid Mutlaq'' or Unrestricted Jurist-Scholar, while he who has not reached that level generally will master of the methodology (''Usul'') used by one or more of the prominent ''madhhab'' and then able to apply this methodology to arrive at the traditional legal rulings of his/her respective madhhab. According to the Sunni Muslim website Living Islam, "There is no mujtahid mutlaq today nor even a claimant to that title."&lt;ref name=Haddad&gt;{{cite web|last1=Haddad|first1=GF|title=What is the definition of a mujtahid mutlaq, and are there any today.|url=http://www.livingislam.org/fiqhi/fiqha_e60.html|website=livingislam.org|accessdate=9 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Below the level of Mujtahid Mutlaq is the ''Mujtahid Muqayyad'' or a Restricted Jurist-Scholar.  A ''Mujtahid Muqayyad'' must pass rulings according to the confines of his particular [[madhhab]] (school of jurisprudence), or particular area of specialization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Sunni Path|publisher=Hakikat Kitapevi.|page=33|edition=15th|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0RsuasOoNH0C&amp;pg=PA33&amp;dq=%27%27%27Mujtahid+Muqayyad%27%27%27&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAGoVChMI2Jr359nqxwIV0X-SCh3DFwEP#v=onepage&amp;q=%27%27%27Mujtahid%20Muqayyad%27%27%27&amp;f=false|accessdate=9 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is according to the view that Ijtihad or the ability of legal deduction can be achieved in specified areas, and does not require a holistic grasp of the [[Shariah]] and its entailing Laws and legal theory.

[[File:Wiki-fingering.svg|thumb|Illustration showing fingering]]
'''Fingering''' is the use of fingers or hands to [[sexually stimulate]] the [[vulva]], [[vagina]] or the [[Human anus|anus]]. It may be done for [[sexual arousal]] or [[foreplay]], [[mutual masturbation]], or constitute the entire [[sexual encounter]]. To "finger oneself" is to [[masturbation|masturbate]] in this manner. It is analogous to a [[handjob]] (the manual stimulation of the [[human penis|penis]]), and may be used as [[Sexual penetration|penetrative]] or [[Non-penetrative sex|non-penetrative]] sexual activity.

Vaginal fingering is legally and medically called '''digital penetration''' or '''digital penetration of the vagina''', and may involve one or more fingers.

==Genital fingering==
===Outside the vagina===
[[File:Moki Mook showing off.jpg|thumb|Manual stimulation of the outer genitalia is the most common form of masturbation]]
[[File:Girl Love.jpg|thumb|upright|Fingering as a practice for mutual masturbation]]

Massage of the vulva, and in particular the [[clitoris]], is the most common way for a woman to achieve an [[orgasm]].&lt;ref name="Kammerer-Doak"&gt;{{cite journal | first = Dorothy | last = Kammerer-Doak | first2 = Rebecca G. | last2 = Rogers | title = Female Sexual Function and Dysfunction | journal = Obstetrics and Gynecology Clinics of North America | volume = 35 | issue = 2 | pages = 169–183 | date = June 2008 | pmid = 18486835 | doi = 10.1016/j.ogc.2008.03.006 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0889854508000235 | quote=Most women report the inability to achieve orgasm with vaginal intercourse and require direct clitoral stimulation ...

===Inside the vagina===
Fingering the vagina is often performed in an effort to stimulate the [[G-spot]]. The G-spot is reportedly located roughly {{convert|5|cm|abbr=on}} up on the anterior wall of the vagina, forwards toward the [[navel]]. It is described as being recognized by its ridges and slightly rougher texture compared to the more cushion-like vaginal cavity walls around it. Fingering this spot, and in effect possibly stimulating the [[Skene's gland]], is commonly cited as a method that may lead to [[female ejaculation]].&lt;ref name="Rabinerson &amp; Horowitz"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rabinerson D, Horowitz E |title=[G-spot and female ejaculation: fiction or reality?] |language=Hebrew |journal=Harefuah |volume=146 |issue=2 |pages=145–7, 163 |date=February 2007 |pmid=17352286 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parallels are sometimes drawn with the fingering or other manipulation of the male prostate through the [[Human anus|anus]].&lt;ref name="Zaviacic"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zaviacic M, Jakubovská V, Belosovic M, Breza J | title = Ultrastructure of the normal adult human female prostate gland (Skene's gland) | journal = Anat Embryol (Berl) | volume = 201 | issue = 1 | pages = 51–61 | year = 2000 | pmid = 10603093  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Wimpissinger | first1 = F. | last2 = Stifter | first2 = K. | last3 = Grin | first3 = W. | last4 = Stackl | first4 = W. | title = The Female Prostate Revisited: Perineal Ultrasound and Biochemical Studies of Female Ejaculate | doi = 10.1111/j.1743-6109.2007.00542.x | journal = [[The Journal of Sexual Medicine]]| volume = 4 | issue = 5 | pages = 1388–93| year = 2007 | pmid = 17634056 | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some women have cited the "come hither" approach as a significant catalyst to orgasm. This technique involves the [[middle finger]], sometimes additionally the [[Index finger|index]] or ring finger, making a [[List of gestures|hand gesture]] like "come here" with the palm facing upwards towards her pubic bone. Medical professionals suggest washing the hands before contact with the vagina, to ensure proper hygiene, especially when moving between different orifices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pussy Fingering|url=http://www.sex-project.com/fingering.shtml|publisher=Sex Project|accessdate=19 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Anal fingering==
{{See also|Anal masturbation}}
The practice may be pleasurable because of the large number of [[nerve endings]] in the [[Human anus|anal area]], and because of the added stimulation gained from stretching the [[sphincter ani externus muscle|anal sphincter muscles]] while inserting the finger. A good quality [[personal lubricant]] is advisable to both increase the pleasurable sensation and aid insertion. Some people prefer to simply stimulate the outer ring of the anus, while others will follow this by inserting one or more fingers. Fingering may be seen as an act in itself, or as an arousing prelude in preparation for further [[anal sex]]. Anal fingering can arouse the receiver, allowing them to relax their anus and prepare them for the insertion of a [[human penis|penis]] or any other sexual instrument. Anal fingering is also an effective way of stimulating the [[prostate]] in males, and thus may bring the receiver to orgasm.&lt;ref name="Prostate/Hot spot"&gt;{{cite web|title=The male hot spot — Massaging the prostate|publisher=[[Go Ask Alice!]]|date=27 September 2002|accessdate=2010-04-21|url=http://www.goaskalice.columbia.edu/answered-questions/male-hot-spot-%E2%80%94-massaging-prostate}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rosenthal"&gt;{{cite book|first=Martha|last=Rosenthal|title=Human Sexuality: From Cells to Society|publisher=[[Cengage Learning]]|year=2012|pages=133–135|accessdate=17 September 2012|isbn= 0618755713|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d58z5hgQ2gsC&amp;pg=PT153}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Answer"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Orgasm Answer Guide|isbn= 0-8018-9396-8|publisher=JHU Press|year=2009|pages=108–109|accessdate=6 November 2011|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Kkts3AX9QVAC&amp;pg=PA108|first1=Barry R. |last1=Komisaruk |author-link2=Beverly Whipple |first2=Beverly |last2=Whipple |first3=Sara |last3=Nasserzadeh |first4=Carlos |last4=Beyer-Flores}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anal fingering can also stimulate the [[perineal sponge]] in females.

==Safety and sexual assault==
The practice is generally considered [[safe sex]] as long as there are no open wounds on the fingers. The [[Nail (anatomy)|nails]] should be trimmed and filed; long, sharp or jagged nails can cause cuts, injury, or severe infection. If there are cuts, infections, or open wounds on the fingers, extreme protection and care is necessary. If [[finger cot]]s are used they may slip off and remain inside the receptive partner. The hands should be thoroughly washed with soap and warm water before practicing any other activity to avoid spreading bacteria or germs. In stimulating both the anus and vagina, separate [[Medical glove|latex gloves]] should be used for each to avoid cross-contamination.

Digital penetration against a person's will is considered [[sexual assault]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=[[USA Today]] |title=Woman accuses Kennedy Smith of sexual assault in civil lawsuit |date=26 August 2004 |quote=Kevin O'Reilly said the alleged assault consisted of "digital penetration" against his client's will. |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/2004-08-26-kennedy-smith_x.htm |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fire protection''' is the study and practice of mitigating the unwanted effects of potentially [[Conflagration|destructive fires]].&lt;ref&gt;NFPA Fire Protection Handbook, pg. 2-19&lt;/ref&gt; It involves the study of the behaviour, [[Compartmentalization (fire protection)|compartmentalisation]], suppression and investigation of [[fire]] and its related emergencies, as well as the research and development, production, testing and application of mitigating [[system]]s. In structures, be they land-based, offshore or even ships, the owners and operators are responsible to maintain their facilities in accordance with a design-basis that is rooted in laws, including the local [[building code]] and fire code, which are enforced by the [[Authority Having Jurisdiction]].

Buildings must be constructed in accordance with the version of the building code that is in effect when an application for a building permit is made. Building inspectors check on compliance of a building under [[construction]] with the building code. Once [[construction]] is complete, a building must be maintained in accordance with the current fire code, which is enforced by the fire prevention officers of a local fire department. In the event of fire emergencies, [[Firefighter]]s, fire investigators, and other fire prevention personnel are called to mitigate, investigate and learn from the [[Fire damage|damage of a fire]]. Lessons learned from fires are applied to the authoring of both building codes and fire codes.

==Classifying fires==
{{Main|Fire class}}
When deciding on what fire protection is appropriate for any given situation, it is important to assess the types of fire hazard that may be faced.

Some jurisdictions operate systems of classifying fires using code letters.  Whilst these may agree on some classifications, they also vary.  Below is a table showing the standard operated in Europe and Australia against the system used in the United States.

{| class="wikitable"
|-

! Type of Fire

! European

! North America

| Fires that involve flammable [[solid]]s such as [[wood]], [[cloth]], [[rubber]], [[paper]], and some types of [[plastic]]s.
| Class A
| Class A

| Class C
|-
| Fires involving cooking fats and oils. The high temperature of the oils when on fire far exceeds that of other flammable liquids, making normal extinguishing agents ineffective.

&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;small&gt;Technically there is no such thing as a "Class E" fire, as electricity itself does not burn. However it is considered a dangerous and very deadly complication to a fire, therefore using the incorrect extinguishing method can result in serious injury or death. Class E, however generally refers to fires involving electricity, therefore a bracketed E, "(E)" denoted on various types of extinguishers.&lt;ref&gt;New South Wales Rural Fire Service VF - (2005) Village Firefighter Manual, pg 16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

Fires are sometimes categorized as "one alarm", "two alarm", "three alarm" (or higher) fires. There is no standard definition for what this means quantifiably, though it always refers to the level response by the local authorities. In some cities, the numeric rating refers to the number of fire stations that have been summoned to the fire. In others, the number counts the number of "dispatches" for additional personnel and equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbc4.com/money/9208480/detail.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-11-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071123185444/http://www.nbc4.com/money/9208480/detail.html |archivedate=2007-11-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thevillager.com/villager_39/fouralarmfire.html|title=Four-alarm fire on Avenue B|author=|date=|website=www.thevillager.com|accessdate=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fire protection in land-based [[building]]s, [[offshore construction]] or onboard [[ship]]s is typically achieved via all of the following:
* [[Passive fire protection]] - the installation of [[firewall (construction)|firewalls]] and fire rated floor assemblies to form fire compartments intended to limit the spread of [[fire]], high temperatures, and [[smoke]].
* [[Active fire protection]] - manual and automatic detection and suppression of fires, such as [[fire sprinkler]] systems and ([[fire alarm]]) systems. 
* [[Education]] - the provision of information regarding passive and active fire protection systems to building owners, operators, occupants, and emergency personnel so that they have a working understanding of the intent of these systems and how they perform in the [[fire safety plan]].

==Balanced Approach==
Passive fire protection (PFP) in the form of compartmentalisation was developed prior to the invention of or widespread use of active fire protection (AFP), mainly in the form of automatic fire sprinkler systems. During this time, PFP was the dominant mode of protection provided in facility designs. With the widespread installation of fire sprinklers in the past 50 years, the reliance on PFP as the only approach was reduced.
Lobby groups are typically divided into two camps favouring active or [[passive fire protection]]. Each camp tries to garner more business for itself through its influence in establishing or changing local and national building and fire codes.  

The relatively recent inclusion of ''performance based'' or ''objective based'' codes, which have a greater emphasis on life safety than property protection, tend to support AFP initiatives, and can lead to the justification for a lesser degree of fire resistant rated construction. At times it works the other way around, as [[Firewall (construction)|firewalls]] that protrude through the [[roof]] structure are used to "sub-divide" [[building]]s such that the separated parts are of smaller area and contain smaller fire hazards, and do not necessarily require sprinklers.

The decision to favour AFP versus PFP in the design of a new building may be affected by the lifecycle costs.  Lifecycle costs can be shifted from capital to operational budgets and vice versa.

==Building Operation in conformance with Design==
'''Fire protection''' within a structure is a [[system]] that relies on all of its components. The building is designed in compliance with the local [[building code]] and [[fire code]] by the architect and other consultants. A building permit is issued after review by the [[Authority Having Jurisdiction|Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ)]].

Deviations from that original plan should be made known to the AHJ to make sure that the change is still in compliance with the law to prevent any unsafe conditions that may violate the law and put people at risk. For example, if the [[firestop]] systems in a structure were inoperable, a significant part of the fire safety plan might be compromised in the event of a fire because the walls and floors that contain the firestops are intended to have a [[fire-resistance rating]]. Likewise, if the [[Fire sprinkler|sprinkler system]] or fire alarm system is inoperable for lack of proper maintenance, the likelihood of damage or personal injury is increased.

[[File:Madame de Meuron.jpg|thumb|[[Elisabeth de Meuron|Madame de Meuron]] with ear trumpet]]
The first [[hearing aid]] was created in the 17th century. The movement toward modern hearing aids began with the creation of the [[telephone]], and the first electric hearing aid was created in 1898. By the late 20th century, the digital hearing aid was distributed to the public commercially. Some of the first hearing aids were external hearing aids. External hearing aids directed sounds in front of the ear and blocked all other noises. The apparatus would fit behind or in the ear.

The invention of the [[carbon microphone]], [[transmitters]], digital signal processing chip or [[Digital signal processor|DSP]], and the development of [[computer]] technology helped transform the hearing aid to its present form.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;Howard, Alexander. "Hearing Aids: Smaller and Smarter." New York Times, November 26, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ear trumpets==
{{Main|Ear trumpet}}
[[File:King goa's chair.jpg|thumb|right|Frederick Rein's ingenious acoustic chair, designed for King [[John VI of Portugal]] in the early 19th-century.]]
The use of ear trumpets for the partially deaf, dates back to the 17th century.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt; By the late 18th century, their use was becoming increasingly common. Collapsible conical ear trumpets were made by instrument makers on a one-off basis for specific clients. Well known models of the period included the Townsend Trumpet (made by the [[deaf education|deaf educator]] John Townshend), the Reynolds Trumpet (specially built for painter [[Joshua Reynolds]]) and the Daubeney Trumpet.

The first firm to begin commercial production of the ear trumpet was established by Frederick C. Rein in London in 1800. As well as producing ear trumpets, Rein also sold  hearing fans, and [[speaking tube]]s. These instruments helped amplify sounds, while still being portable. However, these devices were generally bulky and had to be physically supported from below. Later, smaller, hand-held [[ear trumpet]]s and cones were used as hearing aids.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Levitt, H. "Digital hearing aids: wheelbarrows to ear inserts." ASHA Leader 12, no. 17 (December 26, 2007): 28-30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;Mills, Mara. "Hearing Aids and the History of Electronics Miniaturization." IEEE Annals of the History of Computing 33.2 (2011): 24-44.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Rein hearing aid catalog.jpg|thumb|left|Frederick Rein Ltd.'s catalog, displaying evolving 19th century designs.]] 
Rein was commissioned to design a special acoustic chair for the ailing King of [[Portugal]], [[John VI of Portugal]] in 1819. The throne was designed with ornately carved arms that looked like the open mouths of lions. These holes acted as the receiving area for the acoustics, which were transmitted to the back of the throne via a speaking tube, and into the king's ear.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://beckerexhibits.wustl.edu/did/19thcent/part2.htm|title=Concealed Hearing Devices of the 19th Century}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Finally in the late 1800s, the acoustic horn, which was a tube that had two ends, a cone that captured sound, and was eventually made to fit in the ear.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;  

Toward the late 19th century, hidden hearing aids became increasingly popular. Rein pioneered many notable designs, including his 'acoustic headbands', where the hearing aid device was artfully concealed within the hair or headgear. Reins' ''Aurolese Phones'' were headbands, made in a variety of shapes, that incorporated sound collectors near the ear that would amplify the acoustics. Hearing aids were also hidden in couches, clothing, and accessories. This drive toward ever increasing invisibility was often more about hiding the individual's disability from the public than about helping the individual cope with his problem.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;

==Electronic hearing aids==
[[File:Vacuum tube hearing aid use 1933.jpg|thumb|A 1933 ad for early vacuum tube hearing aids.]]
[[File:Museum of Medicine Berlin Germany Telephone hearing aids.jpg|thumb|These German hearing aids date from around 1920 to 1950. They include an attachment similar to a telephone receiver. Museum of Medicine, Berlin, Germany.]]
The first electronic hearing aids were constructed after the invention of the [[telephone]] and [[microphone]] in the 1870s and 1880s. The technology within the telephone increased how acoustic signal could be altered. Telephones were able to control the [[loudness]], [[frequency]], and distortion of sounds. These abilities were used in the creation of the hearing aid.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;

The first electric hearing aid, called the Akouphone, was created by [[Miller Reese Hutchison]] in 1898. It used a carbon transmitter, so that the hearing aid could be portable. The [[carbon transmitter]] was used to amplify sound by taking a weak signal and using [[electric current]] to make it a strong signal.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; These electronic hearing aids could eventually be shrunk into purses and other accessories.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;  

One of the first manufacturers of the electronically amplified hearing aid was the [[Siemens]] company in 1913. Their hearing aids were bulky and not easily portable. They were about the size of a "tall cigar box" and had a speaker that would fit in the ear.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

The first [[vacuum-tube]] hearing aid was patented by a Naval [[engineer]] Earl Hanson in 1920. It was called the Vactuphone and used the telephone [[transmitter]] to turn speech into electrical signals. After the signal was converted, it would be amplified when it moved to the receiver. The hearing aid weighed seven pounds, which made it light enough to be carried.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; [[Marconi]] in England and [[Western Electric]] in the US began marketing vacuum tube hearing aids in 1923.

During the 1920s and 1930s, the vacuum tube hearing aid became more successful and began to decrease in size with better miniaturization techniques. The Acousticon's Model 56 was created in the mid-1920s and was one of the first portable hearing aid units, although it was quite heavy.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;  The first wearable hearing aid using vacuum tube technology went on sale in England in 1936, and a year later in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aKbApRUm4kkC|title=Audiologists' Desk Reference: Audiologic management, rehabilitation, and terminology|author=James Wilbur Hall|year=1998|publisher=Cengage Learning|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1930s, hearing aids were becoming popular to the public.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; [[Multitone Electronics|Multitone of London]] patented the first hearing aid to use [[automatic gain control]]. The same company introduced a wearable version in 1948.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;  

Military technological advances that occurred in [[World War II]] helped the development of hearing aids. One of the major advances that World War II enabled was the idea of miniaturization.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;  This could be seen by Zenith's pocket-sized Miniature 75.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

==Transistor hearing aids== 
[[File:Hearing aid 1980s close up.jpg|thumb|200x200px|This early 1980s photo shows a hearing aid with a transistor that is worn over the chest with shoulder straps. It would sometimes have a problem with static interference, even if the wearer laughed or smiled.]]
The development of [[transistors]] in 1948 by [[Bell Laboratories]] led to major improvements to the hearing aid.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;  The transistor was invented by [[John Bardeen]], [[Walter Brattain]], and [[William Shockley]].  Transistors were created to replace vacuum tubes; they were small, required less battery power and had less [[distortion]] and heat than their predecessor.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;  These vacuum tubes were typically hot and fragile, so the transistor was the ideal replacement.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;K., W. (1953, Apr 19). Transistors in need of improvement. New York Times (1923-Current File), pp. E9.&lt;/ref&gt;The 1952 [[Sonotone 1010]] used a transistor stage along with vacuum tubes, to extend battery life.   The size of these transistors led to developments in miniature, carbon microphones. These microphones could be mounted on various items, even eyeglasses.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;  In 1951, [[Raytheon]] manufactured the transistor and was one of the first companies to mass-produce transistors to throughout America. Raytheon realized that their hearing aid only lasted short-term and began to sell the vacuum-tube hearing aids again along with transistor hearing aids.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;

The act of putting transistors into hearing aids was so quick that they were not properly tested. It was later found that transistors could get damp. Because of this dampness, the hearing aid would only last for a few weeks and then die. In order to stop this from happening, a coating had to be put on the transistor to protect it from the dampness. This problem had to be fixed in order for transistors in hearing aids to be successful.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;   

Zenith was the first company to realize the problem with transistors was the body heat of individuals. After coming to this conclusion, the first “all-transistor” hearing aids were offered in 1952, called the Microtone Transimatic and the Maico Transist-ear. In 1954, the company, [[Texas Instruments]], produced a [[silicon]] transistor, which was much more effective than the previous version.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;  The end of the transistor was marked by the creation of the [[integrated circuit]] or IC by Jack Kilby at Texas Instruments in 1958 and the technique was perfected in hearing aids over the next 20 years.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;

Elmer V. Carlson, the author of thirty patents, was instrumental in inventing many of the components of the modern hearing aid.&lt;ref&gt; http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2003-01-25/news/0301250251_1_hearing-aids-mr-carlson-elmer&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.etymotic.com/media/publications/erl-0114-1992.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Digital hearing aid== 
Beginning in the early 1960s, Bell Telephone Laboratories created a process for creating both speech and audio signals on a large [[mainframe computer]]. Because of the size of digital computers, the process of simulating hearing aids was extremely slow. The progression of the audio speech signal took longer than the length of the duration of the signal itself. In order to get the power needed to process the sound, a large mainframe computer was needed. This made it nearly impossible to conceive the idea that hearing aids could be made into something that could be made to fit onto an ear. This research was important for learning about how to develop sounds for those with hearing disabilities.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;     

In addition, in the 1970s, the [[microprocessor]] was created. This microprocessor helped to open up the door to miniaturization of the hearing aid.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; Moreover, researcher [[Edgar Villchur]] developed multi-channel [[amplitude compression]]. Amplitude compression enabled [[audio signal]] to be separated into [[frequency band]]s. These bands were able to adjust sounds so that sounds that were more intensive were weakened and sounds that were weakened would become more intensified. The system of multi-channel amplitude compression would be later used as the fundamental structural design for the first hearing aids that used [[digital technology]].&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;
  
[[File:Traditional hearing aids.jpg|thumb|Some hearing aids from the early 21st century with traditional designs.]]
Another pioneer in hearing aid development was Daniel Graupe, who developed the six-channel hearing aid. The six-channel hearing aid in 1975 had digital control of the frequency in all channels. In 1979, electro-acoustic features of hearing aids were able to be changed by a simple button. The pressing of this button caused the amplification to be altered to appropriate levels for the environment in which the individual was present.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; This technique of controlling the hearing aid for the environment is used in some manner throughout all digital hearing aids.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

The creation of high-speed digital-array [[processors]] used in [[minicomputers]] opened up the door for advances in digital hearing aids.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;  These minicomputers were able to process audio signals at speeds that were equivalent to real-time. In 1982, at the [[City University of New York]], the first real-time all digital hearing aid was created. The equipment contained a digital array processor and minicomputer. This consisted of an FM [[radio transmitter]] and receiver. The radio made a connection between the individual through a transmitter on the body to the radio on top of the computer. The transmitter on the body was connected by a wire to the ear microphone and the receiver.  Even though this was a major breakthrough in the creation of hearing aids, there were still a few problems. One of these major problems was that while the hearing aid worked, it was extremely heavy and nearly impossible to move.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;
[[File:Oticon Bluetooth hearing aids.jpg|thumb|left|Oticon hearing aids to be used with [[Bluetooth]] wireless devices.]]

The first commercial digital hearing aid was created in 1987 by the Nicolet Corporation. The hearing aid contained a body-worn processor that had a hardwire connection with an ear mounted transducer. While the Nicolet Corporation’s hearing aid was not publicly successful and the company shortly folded, it was able to start a competition between companies to create more effective hearing aids. Two years later, in 1989, the behind-the-ear (BTE) digital hearing aid was launched.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

In addition to the Nicolet Corporation, Bell Laboratories expanded upon the hearing aid business by developing a hybrid digital-analog hearing aid. This hearing aid used digital circuits to handle a two-channel compression amplifier. Even though early research on this hearing aid was successful, [[AT&amp;T]], the parent company to Bell Laboratories, pulled out of the hearing aid market and sold its rights to Resound Corporation in 1987. When the hearing aid was put on in the market, it was instantaneously successful. This development helped bring major changes to the world of the hearing aid.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

After the success of the Resound Corporation, other hearing aid companies began putting out hybrid hearing aids that included analog amplifiers, filters, and limiters that were managed digitally. There were many benefits to these hearing aids; which included storing parameter settings, having a capability for paired-comparison testing, having settings for different acoustic environments, and having more advanced methods of signaling; this which included multi-channel compression.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

The next major milestone was creating an all-digital hearing aid. The Oticon Company developed the first digital hearing aid in 1995, but it was only distributed to audiological research centers for research on digital technology in the realm of acoustic amplification. The Senso was the first commercially successful, all-digital hearing aid, and was created by Widex in 1996.  After the success of the Senso, Oticon began marketing their own hearing aid, the DigiFocus.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

Current digital hearing aids are now programmable which enables digital hearing aids to regulate the sound on their own, without using a separate control. The hearing aid can now adjust itself depending on what environment it is in and often does not even need a physical volume control button.&lt;ref&gt;Berger, Kenneth. "Hearing Aid Museum ." Kent State University Excellence in Action. http://www.kent.edu/ehhs/spa/museum/history.cfm (accessed May 15, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently,  "Made for iPhone hearing aids" (MFi) were introduced by Resound, which enables users of MFi digital hearing aids to stream phone calls, music, and podcasts directly from iOS devices. &lt;ref&gt;Apple, Inc. "Made for iPhone Hearing Aids" https://www.apple.com/accessibility/ios/hearing-aids/ (accessed January 28, 2016). &lt;/ref&gt; 

Directly leveraging the audio processing power potential in smartphones, Jacoti BVBA from Belgium developed ListenApp, the first digital hearing aid application to win CE certification and FDA approval as a medical device. &lt;ref&gt;Jacoti, BVBA, "Jacoti ListenApp" https://www.jacoti.com/listenapp/ (accessed January 28, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hearing aid chips==
One of the first digital chips was created by Daniel Graupe.  The digital chip, referred to as the Zeta Noise Blocker, routinely adjusted the gain in the frequency channels to help control high levels of noise.  The chip was integrated in a number of hearing aids in the 1980s.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;  In addition to the Zeta Noise Blocker, there was a development of digital chips that were devoted to high-speed [[digital signal processing]] or DSP. DSP chips became available in 1982, and began to be implemented into hearing aids. By 1988, chips were produced in hearing aids. One of the major contributions of these chips was the ability to process both speech and other types of noises in real time. One major down fall of these chips was that they were massive and used up a lot of battery, which made them nearly impossible to be worn.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

The '''Humanities Indicators''' is a project of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] that equips researchers and policymakers, universities, foundations, museums, libraries, humanities councils and other public institutions with statistical tools for answering basic questions about primary and secondary humanities education, undergraduate and graduate education in the [[humanities]], the humanities workforce, levels and sources of program funding, public understanding and impact of the humanities, and other areas of concern in the humanities community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://chronicle.com/article/First-National-Picture-of/1437 ''Chronicle of Higher Education'', "First National Picture of Trends in the Humanities Is Unveiled"].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.humanitiesindicators.org/content/system/inTheNews.aspx Indicators in the News].&lt;/ref&gt; 

Data from the Humanities Indicators has been widely discussed in recent conversations about a "crisis in the humanities", in light of a national decline in the number of college majors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2017/06/05/analysis-finds-significant-drop-humanities-majors-gains-liberal-arts-degrees|title=Humanities Majors Drop|last=Jaschik|first=Scott|date=June 5, 2017|work=Inside Higher Ed|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.marketwatch.com/story/liberal-arts-majors-are-a-dying-breed-2017-06-05|title=Liberal arts majors are a dying breed|last=Berman|first=Jillian|date=July 30, 2017|work=MarketWatch|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; To address questions about the workforce outcomes of humanities graduates (which are often cited as playing a role in the falling number of majors as of 2015), the Indicators issued [https://www.amacad.org/multimedia/pdfs/publications/researchpapersmonographs/HI_Workforce-2018.pdf ''The State of the Humanities 2018: Graduates in the Workforce &amp; Beyond''], which examined not only their employment and earnings relative to other fields, but also graduates’ satisfaction with their work after graduation and their lives more generally. The data reveal that despite disparities in median earnings, humanities majors are quite similar to graduates from other fields with respect to their ''perceived'' well-being. The report was widely cited in the media as an important intervention in the discussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.seattletimes.com/education-lab/report-busts-myth-of-unemployable-humanities-grads/|title=Report busts myth of unemployable humanities grads|last=Long|first=Katherine|date=February 12, 2018|work=The Seattle Times|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2018/02/07/study-finds-humanities-majors-land-jobs-and-are-happy-them|title=Shocker: Humanities Grads Gainfully Employed and Happy|last=Jaschik|first=Scott|date=February 7, 2018|work=Inside Higher Ed|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.chronicle.com/article/Over-Time-Humanities-Grads/242461|title=Over Time, Humanities Grads Close the Pay Gap With Professional Peers|last=Carlson|first=Scott|date=February 7, 2018|work=Chronicle of Higher Education|accessdate=|archive-url=|archivedate=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ibn Zafar al Siqilli''', ({{lang-ar|ابن ظفر الصقلي}}), or ({{lang-ar|احجة الدين أبو عبد الله محمد بن أبي محمد بن محمد بن ظفر الصقلي}}), or '''Abū ‘Abd Allāh Muḥammad Ibn Abī Muḥammad Ibn Ẓafar al-Siqillī al-Makkī al-Mālikī''' (are among the several variants), was a [[philosopher]], [[polymath]] and Arab-Sicilian politician of the [[Normans|Norman]] period (1104 - 1170), and has come to be known in the West as "[[Niccolò Machiavelli]]'s Arab Precursor".

==Biography==
Ibn Ẓafar was said to be physically small and frail. His [[demonym]] 'al-Siqillī' indicates he was born in [[Sicily]], but the [[patronym]] 'al-Makkī' suggests his family origins were in [[Mecca]], where he is believed to have been raised and educated. Nicknamed 'The Wanderer', the precise chronology of his travels are uncertain.  He probably spent his youth in [[Fatimid Egypt]] and [[Mahdia]] in [[Tunisia]], but left there in 1148 when it fell to the Normans. After a period in Sicily, Ibn Ẓafar first went to Egypt, then to [[Aleppo]] in 1146, where he taught at the [[Madrasa]] Ibn Abī ‘Aṣrūn under the patronage of Ṣāfīal-Dīn. In 1154 he returned to Sicily under the patronage of Amīr Abū ‘Abd Allāh Ibn Abī al-Qāsim Ibn ‘Alī al-Qurashī, known as Ibn Hajar, a Sicilian Arab noble, who served as a general in the Norman army. Due to the civil unrest of the Muslim population some time later, Ibn Ẓafar left Sicily definitively and took refuge in [[Hamat]], in Syria, where he died in poverty in 1170, or 1172. The geographer [[Yaqut al-Hamawi|Yāqūt al-Rūmī]] referred to him as a ‘refined [[philologist]]’, and both [[Al-Dhahabi|Shams al-Dīn al-Dhahabī]] and [[Ibn Khallikan|Ibn Khallikān]] praised his scholarship and thought.&lt;ref name="MAB"&gt;[https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13530190020000493 R. Hrair Dekmejian  &amp;  Adel Fathy Thabit  ''Machiavelli’s Arab Precursor: Ibn Zafar al-Siqillī'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://ia801900.us.archive.org/5/items/WafayatAl-ayantheObituariesOfEminentMenByIbnKhallikan/Vol4Of4WafayatAl-ayantheObituariesOfEminentMenByIbnKhallikan.pdf Khallikan, ''Obituaries of Eminent Men              '', Vol.4]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary career==
Ibn Ẓafar was said to have authored 32 books&lt;ref&gt;Arié, Miniatures pp. 1–4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Solwan, or Waters of Comfort===
''Sulwān al-Muṭā fī Udwān al-Atbā'' ({{lang-ar|سلوان المطاع في عدوان الأتباع}}) (Consolation for the Ruler During the Hostility of his Subjects) is his magnum opus.&lt;ref name="MAB"/&gt; When [[Niccolò Machiavelli]], the famous Florentine, dedicated his treatise, '[[The Prince]]', to [[Lorenzo di Medici]] four centuries later, Ibn Ẓafar was almost unknown to the [[Western world]].  He remained in relative obscurity even after [[Michele Amari]]'s [[Italian language|Italian]] translation appeared in 1851.  Amari's introduction had included a biographical account of Ibn Ẓafar and his manuscript's history, and Richard Bentley published an English version in 1852.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/solwanorwatersof01ibnz Amari, Michele ''Solwan, or Waters of Comfort by Ibn Zafer'', Vol.1]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/solwanorwatersof02ibnz Amari, Michele ''Solwan, or Waters of Comfort by Ibn Zafer'', Vol.2]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MAB"/&gt;  At the beginning of the 20th century another Sicilian and political scientist philosopher, [[Gaetano Mosca]], wrote of the striking parallels between Ibn Ẓafar's treatise and Machiavelli's.  Ibn Ẓafar's name is rarely credited as the precursor to its famous successor.

The treatise is a form  of [[Wisdom literature]] with a long Arabian and Persian tradition, called '[[Mirrors for princes]]', which purported to be handbooks for princes and caliphs offering counsel on the proper use of power, good governance and the conduct of commerce and trade.   Ibn Ẓafar dedicated the first edition of 'Sulwan' to an unknown king facing revolt - possibly the ruler of [[Damascus]] expelled by [[Nur Eddin]] - and the second edition to his patron Abū al-Qāsim (Ibn Hajar).

The '''Kinetic Simulation Algorithm Ontology''' (KiSAO) supplies information about existing algorithms available for the simulation of [[systems biology]] models, their characterization and interrelationships. KiSAO is part of the [[BioModels.net]] project and of the [[COMBINE]] initiative.&lt;ref name="10.1038/msb.2011.77" /&gt;

==Structure==
KiSAO consists of three main branches:
* simulation algorithm,
* simulation algorithm characteristic,
* simulation algorithm parameter.
The elements of each algorithm branch are linked to characteristic and parameter branches using ''has characteristic'' and ''has parameter'' relationships accordingly.The algorithm branch itself is hierarchically structured using ''subClassOf'' relationships, which denote that the descendant algorithms were derived from, or specify, more general ancestors.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5851">'''Kremlinology''' is the study and analysis of the politics and policies of Russia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="Kremlinology" definition|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/kremlinology|website=merriam-webster.com|publisher=Merriam-Webster Online|accessdate=16 February 2015|quote=Definition of KREMLINOLOGY: the study of the policies and practices of the former Soviet government}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the term '''Sovietology''' means the study of politics and policies of the [[Soviet Union]] and former communist states more generally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="Sovietology" definition|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Sovietology|website=thefreedictionary.com|publisher=The Free Dictionary|accessdate=16 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; These two terms were synonymous until the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]]. In popular culture, the term is sometimes used to mean any attempt to understand a secretive organization or process, such as plans for upcoming products or events, by interpreting indirect clues.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

The term is named after the [[Moscow Kremlin|Kremlin]], the seat of today's Russian and then-Soviet government. Kremlinologist refers to academic, media, and commentary experts who specialize in the study of Kremlinology. The term is sometimes sweepingly used to describe Western scholars who researched issues of, or specialized in, Russian/Soviet law, although the correct term is simply [[List of Russian legal historians|''Russian law'' scholar]]. Sovietologists or Kremlinologists should also be distinguished from [[Transitology|transitologists]], scholars who study legal, economic and social transitions from [[communism]] to [[capitalism]].

==Techniques==
During the [[Cold War]], lack of reliable information about the country forced Western analysts to "read between the lines" and to use the tiniest tidbits, such as the removal of portraits, the rearranging of chairs, positions at the reviewing stand for parades in [[Red Square]], the choice of capital or small initial letters in phrases such as "First Secretary", the arrangement of articles on the pages of the party newspaper ''[[Pravda]]'' and other indirect signs to try to understand what was happening in internal Soviet politics.

To study the relations between Communist fraternal states, Kremlinologists compare the statements issued by the respective national [[Communist Party|Communist parties]], looking for omissions and discrepancies in the ordering of objectives. The description of state visits in the Communist press are also scrutinized, as well as the degree of [[hospitality]] lent to dignitaries. Kremlinology also emphasizes [[ritual]], in that it notices and ascribes meaning to the unusual absence of a policy statement on a certain anniversary or holiday.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Sino-Vietnamese Conflict|first=Eugene K.|last=Lawson|publisher=Praeger|year=1984|pages=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the German language, such attempts acquired the somewhat derisive name "Kreml-Astrologie" (Kremlin Astrology), hinting at the fact that its results were often vague and inconclusive, if not outright wrong.

==After the Cold War==
The term "Kremlinology" is still in use in application to the study of decision-making processes in the [[Politics of Russia|politics of the Russian Federation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ipec-eu.ru/programmnyie-materialyi Poland is in the Eurasian Union: the mythology of Russian-Polish relations. Eurasian Club East - West, October 2012] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121207030814/http://ipec-eu.ru/programmnyie-materialyi |date=2012-12-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In popular culture, the term is sometimes used to mean any attempt to understand a secretive organization or process, such as plans for upcoming products or events, by interpreting indirect clues.

While the Soviet Union no longer exists, other secretive states still do, such as [[North Korea]], for which Kremlinology-like approaches are still used by the Western media.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11826">In [[art history]], an '''[[Notname|anonymous master]]''' is an [[Old Master]] whose work is known, but whose name is lost.

==Renaissance==
Only in the Renaissance did individual artists in Western Europe acquire personalities known by their peers (some listed by [[Vasari]] in his ''[[Lives of the Artists]]''), such as those known by :
* Their true name or their father's name  :
** [[Filippino Lippi]] after his father [[Fra Filippo Lippi]]
* A chosen [[pseudonym]], possibly linked to his birthplace or his father's trade :
** [[Giuliano da Sangallo]] worked on the gate of saint Gall
** [[Antonio Pollaiuolo]], after his father, a chicken farmer (pollo in Italian)
** [[Jacopo del Sellaio]], after his father, a saddler (''sellier'')
** The [[Della Robbia]]s (after the Tuscan word ''robbia'', dyers' [[Rubia tinctorum|madder]], and his father, the dyer [[Luca della Robbia]])
** [[Masuccio Segondo]], student of [[Masuccio Primo]]
** etc.
* '''A surname attributed to him :'''
** [[Simone del Pollaiolo|Il Cronaca]], who never stopped talking about the ruins he had seen in Rome
** [[Daniele da Volterra]], nicknamed  ''Il Braghettone'' (the [[breeches]] maker) for having censored nudes in paintings by adding cloths or branches, at the request of [[pope Paul IV]]
** [[Luca della Robbia]], for the madder colour he used as a ceramicist
** [[Masaccio]], known as the idiot
** etc.
* '''A [[corporation]], whose generic name is given to works made by all its members :'''
** the [[Campionesi Masters]], sculptors and builders of religious buildings (Ugo da Campione, [[Bonino da Campione]], Giovanni da Campione, Zenone de Campione, Matteo da Campione)

==20th-century problems of attribution==
The idea of a named and recognised painter originated among art historians early in the 20th century, who were attributing works they recognised to known painters. They later went back on some of these attributions, renaming as anonymous the painters they had formerly named. One example is the case of [[Pier Francesco Fiorentino]], to whom [[Bernard Berenson]] attributed a number of works which were later re-attributed to [[Pseudo Pier Francesco Fiorentino]], a Florence copyist. Some painters have even been described as anonymous (even many times like [[Barthélemy Eyck]]) before later being recognised. They thus held several names historically (those who are noted on the page devoted to them), although doubts continue surrounding some, such as [[Giovanni Gaddi (painter)|Giovanni Gaddi]] (after 1333 – 1383) maybe the ''Master of the Misericordia dell’Accademia''.

==Artists whose names have since been established==
In recent years the names of a variety of artists who were formerly listed as "anonymous" have become known; accordingly scholarly writings and museum labels have been changed to reflect their new identities. Much the most famous of these is the Master of Flémalle (c 1378–1445), painter of the [[comté de Hainaut]], who was established as [[Robert Campin]]. Other examples include:
* [[Jehan Bellegambe]], sometimes called the "master of colours".
* Master of 1419 – recognised as [[Battista di Biagio Sanguigni]], having painted and dated in 1419 the central panel for a triptych executed for Santa Maria a Latera, broken up and dispersed
* Master of the Chiostro degli Aranci – recognised as being [[Giovanni Consalvo]], fresco painter at the monastery at [[Badia Fiorentina]]
* [[Barthélemy d'Eyck]] is the generally accepted as the painter known as the Master of the Aix Annunciation for paintings, and the Master of René of Anjou for illuminated manuscripts; he is also thought by many to be the Master of the Shadows
* The Dombild Master, as [[Stefan Lochner]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="188713">In [[biological nomenclature]], organisms often receive [[scientific name]]s that honor a person. A [[taxon]] (e.g. [[species]] or [[genus]]; plural: taxa) named in honor of another entity is an [[eponym|eponymous taxon]], and names specifically honoring a person or persons are known as [[patronym (taxonomy)|patronyms]]. Scientific names are generally formally published in peer-reviewed journal articles or larger [[monograph]]s along with descriptions of the named taxa and ways to distinguish them from other taxa. Following rules of [[Latin grammar]], species or subspecies names derived from a man's name often end in ''-i'' or ''-ii'' if named for an individual, and ''-orum'' if named for a group of men or mixed-sex group, such as a family. Similarly, those named for a woman often end in ''-ae'', or ''-arum'' for two or more women.

This list includes organisms named after famous individuals or ensembles (including bands and comedy troupes), but excludes companies, institutions, [[people|ethnic groups or nationalities]], and populated places. It does not include organisms named for fictional entities, for biologists or other natural scientists,{{efn|[[Charles Darwin]], for instance has over [[Commemoration of Charles Darwin#Species|120 eponymous organisms]]}} nor for associates or family members of researchers who are not otherwise notable. The scientific names are given as originally described (their [[basionym]]s): subsequent research may have placed species in different genera, or rendered them [[synonym (biology)|taxonomic synonyms]] of previously described taxa. Some of these names are [[unavailable name|unavailable]] in the zoological sense or [[Nomen illegitimum|illegitimate]] in the botanical sense due to [[senior homonym]]s already having the same name.

Medical education agencies are a specialty subset of advertising agencies that develop educational content for the [[Healthcare]], [[Life Science]] and [[Biotechnology]] industries. Medical education agencies are divided into two categories:

== CME ==
Medical education agencies that develop [[Continuing medical education]] (most commonly referred to as CME) programs in the United States, do so within the strict guidelines{{ref|http://www.accme.org/dir_docs/doc_upload/68b2902a-fb73-44d1-8725-80a1504e520c_uploaddocument.pdf}} set forth by the [[Accreditation Council for Continuing Medical Education]] (ACCME) and the [[Society for Academic Continuing Medical Education]] (SACME). Those who wish to offer CME courses, and thus employ the services of a medical education agency, must receive accreditation from the ACCME. Accreditation allows organizations, such as the [[American Nursing Certification Center]] (ANCC) to develop educational course content that physicians and other professional medical staff may use to satisfy annual CME requirements.{{ref|http://www.ama-assn.org/ama1/pub/upload/mm/455/licensurerereg-06.pdf}}

To avoid the risk of undue bias from commercial sponsorship, all accredited organizations must follow the commercial disclosure rules set out by the ACCME. Medical education agencies must familiarize themselves with these regulations in order to receive CME accreditation from one or more ACCME accredited organizations.

== Non-CME ==

Medical education agencies that develop Non-[[continuing medical education|CME]], also referred to as [[Promotional education]], programs specialize in developing content whose commercial sponsorship is clearly outlined, and course content focuses on specific products or therapies in which the sponsoring organization has a financial interest.

== Delivery Mechanisms ==

The majority of content developed by medical education agencies supports one of two types of delivery mechanism: Instructor Led Training (ILT) and Self Directed Training (SDT).

=== Instructor Led Training ===

Instructor led training, ILT, is the practice of face-to-face delivery of information and learning material between an instructor and learners. Instructor lead training can take the form of didactic training, laboratory demonstration and/or clinical application.

Hospitals, Universities, Pharmaceutical and Medical device manufacturers may employ medical education agencies to develop specific content, or to apply [[Instructional Design]] principles to existing content to make it more readily understood by an instructor led audience. This will include developing informational structures to follow [[learning theory (education)|learning theories]], targeting content toward a specific audience or set of audiences and

=== Self Directed Training ===
Self Directed Training, is the practice of gaining information from learning materials without an instructor present. Self-directed training takes many forms, including deployed eLearning content, textbooks, searchable databases of information and viewing of training presentations at one's own pace. Self-directed training often takes place through a web portal, a [[SCORM|SCORM compliant]] Learning Management System (LMS) or a webcast engine.

Hospitals, Universities, Pharmaceutical and Medical device manufacturers may employ medical education agencies to develop specific content, or to apply [[Instructional Design]] principles to existing content, to make a product, technology or concept more readily understood by a self-directed audience. Medical education agencies also help learners to better understand complex content through interactivity, animation and virtual simulations of training content.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3522">'''The National Electrical Safety Code (NESC)''' or '''ANSI Standard C2''' is a United States standard of the safe installation, operation, and maintenance of electric power and communication utility systems including power substations, power and communication overhead lines, and power and communication underground lines. It is published by the [[Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] (IEEE). "National Electrical Safety Code" and "NESC" are registered trademarks of the IEEE. The NESC should not be confused with the [[National Electrical Code]] (NEC) published by the [[National Fire Protection Association]] (NFPA). The NEC is used for residential, commercial, and industrial building wiring.

==General==

===Access to the NESC===
The NESC is written as a voluntary standard. It is typically adopted as law by individual states or other governmental authorities. To determine the legal status of the NESC, the state public service commission, public utility commission, or other governmental authority should be contacted. The majority of the states in the United States adopt the NESC in some form or fashion. The state of California is an exception. The state of California writes their own utility codes titled General Order 95 (GO95) for overhead lines and General Order 128 (GO128) for underground lines. The current edition of the NESC (2017) is available as a spiral bound book containing approximately 345 pages. The NESC codebook can be purchased online from the publisher, from [http://www.IEEE.org IEEE], or at various third party websites.

===Format of the NESC===
The NESC is written by various sub committees. The organizations represented, subcommittees, and committee members are listed in the front of the code book. The NESC contains the procedure and time schedule for revising the NESC, which are described in the back of the code book. The NESC has an interpretation committee that issues formal interpretations. The process for obtaining a formal interpretation is outlined in the front of the code book. The NESC is currently published on a 5-year cycle. Urgent safety matters that require a change in between code editions are handled through a Tentative Interim Amendment (TIA) process. Original work on the NESC began in 1913.

The NESC is structured into parts, sections, and rules. There are general sections at the beginning of the book covering the introduction, definitions, references, and grounding. Following the general section are four main parts including: substations rules (Part 1), overhead line rules (Part 2), underground line rules (Part 3), and work rules (Part 4).

==NESC Handbooks==
Two widely known handbooks are published on the NESC.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8707">The '''open-circuit time constant method''' is an approximate analysis technique used in electronic circuit design to determine the corner frequency of [[complex circuit]]s. It also is known as the '''zero-value time constant technique'''. The method provides a quick evaluation, and identifies the largest contributions to time constants as a guide to the circuit improvements.

The basis of the method is the approximation that the corner frequency of the amplifier is determined by the term in the denominator of its transfer function that is linear in frequency. This approximation can be extremely inaccurate in some cases where a zero in the numerator is near in frequency.&lt;ref name=Thompson&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

The method also uses a simplified method for finding the term linear in frequency based upon summing the RC-products for each capacitor in the circuit, where the resistor R for a selected capacitor is the resistance found by inserting a test source at its site and setting all other capacitors to zero. Hence the name ''zero-value time constant technique''.

==Example: Simple RC network==
[[File:Open-circuit time constant.PNG|thumbnail|500px|Figure 1: Simple RC circuit and auxiliary circuits to find time constants]]
Figure 1 shows a simple RC low-pass filter. Its [[transfer function]] is found using [[Kirchhoff's circuit laws|Kirchhoff's current law]] as follows. At the output,

::&lt;math&gt; \frac {V_1 - V_O } {R_2} = j\omega C_2 V_O \ , &lt;/math&gt;

where ''V''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the voltage at the top of capacitor ''C''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. At the center node:

::&lt;math&gt; \frac {V_S-V_1}{R_1} = j \omega C_1 V_1 + \frac {V_1-V_O} {R_2} \ . &lt;/math&gt;

Combining these relations the transfer function is found to be:

::&lt;math&gt; \frac {V_O} {V_S} = \frac {1} {1 + j \omega \left(C_2 (R_1+R_2) +C_1 R_1 \right) +(j \omega )^2 C_1 C_2 R_1 R_2 } &lt;/math&gt;

The linear term in ''j''ω in this transfer function can be derived by the following method, which is an application of the open-circuit time constant method to this example.
# Set the signal source to zero.
# Select capacitor ''C''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, replace it by a test voltage ''V''&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;, and replace ''C''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; by an open circuit. Then the resistance seen by the test voltage is found using the circuit in the middle panel of Figure 1 and is simply ''V''&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt; / ''I''&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt; =  ''R''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''R''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Form the product ''C''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ( ''R''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''R''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ).
# Select capacitor ''C''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, replace it by a test voltage ''V''&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;, and replace ''C''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; by an open circuit. Then the resistance seen by the test voltage is found using the circuit in the right panel of Figure 1 and is simply ''V''&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt; / ''I''&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt; = ''R''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. Form the product ''C''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ''R''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.
# Add these terms.

In effect, it is as though each capacitor charges and discharges through the resistance found in the circuit when the other capacitor is an open circuit.

The open circuit time constant procedure provides the linear term in ''j''ω regardless of how complex the RC network becomes. For a complex circuit, the procedure consists of following the above rules, going through all the  capacitors in the circuit. A more general derivation is found in Gray and Meyer.&lt;ref name=Gray-Meyer&gt;
{{cite book 
|author=Paul R. Gray, Hurst P J Lewis S H &amp; Meyer RG
|title=Analysis and design of analog integrated circuits
|page=§7.3.2 pp. 517–520
|year= 2001
|edition=Fourth
|publisher=Wiley 
|location=New York
|isbn=0-471-32168-0 
|url=http://worldcat.org/isbn/0-471-32168-0}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

So far the result is general, but an approximation is introduced to make use of this result: the assumption is made that this linear term in ''j''ω determines the corner frequency of the circuit.

That assumption can be examined more closely using the example of Figure 1: suppose the time constants of this circuit are τ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and τ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;; that is:

::&lt;math&gt; \left( 1 + j \omega { \tau}_1) (1 +j \omega {\tau}_2 \right) = 1 + j \omega \left(C_2 (R_1+R_2) +C_1 R_1 \right) +(j \omega )^2 C_1 C_2 R_1 R_2 &lt;/math&gt;

Comparing the coefficients of the linear and quadratic terms in ''j''ω, there results:

::&lt;math&gt; \tau_1 + \tau_2 = C_2 (R_1+R_2) +C_1 R_1  \ , &lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt; \tau_1 \tau_2 = C_1 C_2 R_1 R_2 \ . &lt;/math&gt;

One of the two time constants will be the longest; let it be τ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. Suppose for the moment that it is much larger than the other, τ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &gt;&gt; τ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. In this case, the approximations hold that:

::&lt;math&gt; \tau_1 + \tau_2 \approx \tau_1 \ , &lt;/math&gt;

and

::&lt;math&gt; \tau_2 = \frac {\tau_1 \tau_2 } { \tau_1} \approx \frac {\tau_1 \tau_2 } { \tau_1 + \tau_2 } \ . &lt;/math&gt;

In other words, substituting the RC-values:

::&lt;math&gt; \tau_1 \approx \hat { \tau_1} =\ \tau_1 + \tau_2  = C_2 (R_1+R_2) +C_1 R_1   \ , &lt;/math&gt;
and
::&lt;math&gt; \tau_2 \approx \hat { \tau_2} =\frac {\tau_1 \tau_2 } { \tau_1 + \tau_2 } = \frac {C_1 C_2 R_1 R_2} {C_2 (R_1+R_2) +C_1 R_1} \ , &lt;/math&gt;

where ( ^ ) denotes the approximate result. As an aside, notice that the circuit time constants both involve both capacitors; in other words, in general the circuit time constants are not decided by any single capacitor. Using these results, it is easy to explore how well the corner frequency (the 3&amp;nbsp;dB frequency) is given by

::&lt;math&gt; f_{3dB} = \frac {1} {2 \pi \hat{ \tau_1 }} \ , &lt;/math&gt;
[[File:Open Circuit Time Constant Estimates.PNG|thumbnail|400px|Figure 2: Comparison of OCTC estimates with actual pole positions]]
as the parameters vary. Also, the exact transfer function can be compared with the approximate one, that is,

::&lt;math&gt; \frac {1} {(1+j \omega \tau_1)(1 + j \omega \tau_2)}\ &lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt; \ &lt;/math&gt; &amp;emsp;  with  &amp;emsp; &lt;math&gt; \ &lt;/math&gt;   &lt;math&gt;\  \frac {1} {(1+j \omega \hat {\tau_1 })(1 + j \omega \hat { \tau_2} )} \ . &lt;/math&gt;

Of course agreement is good when the assumption τ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &gt;&gt; τ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is accurate.

Figure 2 illustrates the approximation. The x-axis is the ratio τ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; / τ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; on a logarithmic scale. An increase in this variable means the higher pole is further above the corner frequency. The y-axis is the ratio of the OCTC (open-circuit time constant) estimate to the true time constant. For the lowest pole use curve T_1; this curve refers to the corner frequency; and for the higher pole use curve T_2.  The worst agreement is for τ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = τ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. In this case τ&lt;sup&gt;^&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 2 τ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and the corner frequency is a factor of 2 too small. The higher pole is a factor of 2 too high (its time constant is half of the real value).

In all cases, the estimated corner frequency is closer than a factor of two from the real one, and always is ''conservative'' that is, lower than the real corner, so the actual circuit will behave better than predicted. However, the higher pole always is ''optimistic'', that is, predicts the high pole at a higher frequency than really is the case. To use these estimates for [[Step response#Control of overshoot|step response]] predictions, which depend upon the ratio of the two pole frequencies (see article on [[Pole splitting#Selection of CC|pole splitting]] for an example), Figure 2 suggests a fairly large ratio of τ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; / τ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is needed for accuracy because the errors in τ&lt;sup&gt;^&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and τ&lt;sup&gt;^&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reinforce each other in the ratio τ&lt;sup&gt;^&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; / τ&lt;sup&gt;^&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

The open-circuit time constant method focuses upon the corner frequency alone, but as seen above, estimates for higher poles also are possible.

Application of the open-circuit time constant method to a number of single transistor amplifier stages can be found in Pittet and Kandaswamy.&lt;ref name=Pittet&gt;

'''Philosophical theology''' is both a branch and form of [[theology]] in which [[philosophy|philosophical]] methods are used in developing or analyzing theological concepts. It therefore includes [[natural theology]] as well as philosophical treatments of [[orthodoxy|orthodox]] and [[heterodox]] theology. Philosophical theology is also closely related to the [[philosophy of religion]].

== Definitions ==
[[Mortimer J. Adler]] distinguishes philosophical theology from [[natural theology]]. While the former is, according to him, theology done by non-Christian philosophers, the latter is done by those who are already Christians and are actually trying to find rational proofs for their faith.&lt;ref&gt;Mortimer J. Adler, "A Philosopher's Religious Faith," in Kelly J. Clark (ed), ''Philosophers Who Believe'' (Illinois: InterVarsity Press, 1993), 205-207&lt;/ref&gt; Adler thinks that the term "natural theology" is a misnomer and is actually apologetics, and cites as an example Thomas Aquinas' ''Summa Contra Gentiles'', addressed to the Jews and Moors in Spain, which though written as if it were philosophical theology, was in fact, apologetics and not philosophical theology, as it was written by a Christian and not by a pagan. In Adler's view, few if any of the books on natural theology, are sound as works in philosophical theology, because they are not written by pagans.&lt;ref&gt;Mortimer J. Adler, "A Philosopher's Religious Faith," in Kelly J. Clark (ed), ''Philosophers Who Believe'', 207&lt;/ref&gt; An example of philosophical theology, according to Adler, is Aristotle's theology as found in his ''Metaphysics.''&lt;ref&gt;Mortimer J. Adler, "A Philosopher's Religious Faith," in Kelly J. Clark (ed), ''Philosophers Who Believe'', 205&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrary to Adler's view, Charles Taliaferro and Chad Meister think that doing philosophical theology may not be restricted by whether the doer is an insider to faith or not, for anyone doing philosophical theology only tries to consider whether a theological doctrine can make philosophical sense or not.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Taliaferro and Chad Meister, ''Contemporary Philosophical Theology'' (Routledge, 2016) {{ISBN|9781317294429}}&lt;/ref&gt; But, as Adler points it out, a pagan doing philosophical theology and coming to a theological conclusion has a different route than an insider using philosophy to examine or seek to understand his faith.

== Philosophy and theology ==
The relationship between theology and philosophy has been long-debated and discussed with the [[Christian tradition]]. [[Tertullian]], an influential early Christian theologian and apologist, believed that philosophy has little to do with theology, arguing that the use of philosophy often corrupted theology, leading to unorthodox beliefs that were not grounded in the early Christian tradition. He famously asked the question 'What has Athens to do with Jerusalem?'. ([[Athens]] symbolized the philosophical approach because of its role as a leading center of [[Hellenistic philosophy]], while [[Jerusalem]] represented Christianity because of its role as an important location and intellectual centre in the [[early church]].) Other leaders, however, saw a closer relationship between philosophy and theology. [[Justin Martyr]] looked at people like [[Heraclitus]] and [[Socrates]] as possessing the divine light of revelation and believed them to be true philosophers. Justin saw Christianity as the True Philosophy and argued for Christianity using philosophical methods and terminology. [[St. Augustine]], who became one of the most influential theologians in history and whose works laid the foundation for much of Western philosophy (as well as much of Western theology), espoused a more middle-of-the-road, moderate approach, arguing that philosophy and theology often complement each other while at the same time cautioning that philosophy should not always be used in theological discourse. Instead, he argued, one should make sure that a philosophical approach toward a particular issue was grounded in prior Christian commitments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/christiantheology-philosophy/|title= Philosophy and Christian Theology}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The disciplines of Philosophy and Theology have often been connected, with theologians and philosophers interacting and debating similar and sometimes overlapping issues. Philosophy played a key role in the formation of Western theology. [[Thomas Aquinas]], one of the most influential philosophers and theologians in history, for instance, borrowed much of his concepts from [[Aristotle]]. [[Scholasticism]] dominated both the philosophical and theological landscape in the [[Middle Ages]], with theologians such as Aquinas, [[Anselm of Canterbury]], [[Duns Scotus]], [[William of Ockham]], [[Peter Abelard]], [[Bonaventure]], and [[Albertus Magnus]] playing key role in both philosophy and theology.

In modern times, [[Anthony Thiselton]] has shown in his ''Fusion of Horizons'' the role that philosophy has played in the interpretation of scriptures, i.e., in the field of [[hermeneutics]]. Philosophy provides interpretive grids for apprehension of revelation. There are others, like [[Sadhu Sundar Singh]], for instance, who believed that it is the illumination of the [[Holy Spirit]] that gives the truest meaning of revelation. Yet, one can't fail to see that cultural grids play an important role in the development of theology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/christiantheology-philosophy/|title= Philosophy and Christian Theology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many contemporary philosophers continue to write and argue from a Christian perspective, with Christian concepts undergirding their philosophical work. In recent decades some of the most well-known philosophers who have written from a Christian perspective are [[Alvin Plantinga]], [[Alasdair MacIntyre]], [[William Lane Craig]], [[Jean-Luc Marion]], [[Paul Tillich]], [[Charles Taylor (philosopher)|Charles Taylor]], [[Richard Swinburne]], and [[James K. A. Smith]].

==Foundations of modern philosophical theology==
During the 18th, 19th centuries, and 20th centuries many theologians reacted against the [[modernism|modernist]], [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], and [[logical positivism|positivist]] attacks on [[Christian theology]]. Some [[Christian existentialism|existentialistic]] or [[neo-orthodoxy|neo-orthodox]] [[Protestantism|Protestant]] intellectuals like the [[Swiss Reformed Church|Swiss Reformed]] theologian [[Karl Barth]] turned away from philosophy (called [[fideism]]) and argued that faith should be based strictly upon divine revelation. A popular approach in some circles is the approach of [[Reformed epistemology|Reformed epistemologists]], such as [[Alvin Plantinga]] and [[Nicholas Wolterstorff]], who assert that belief in God might be [[foundationalism|foundational]] (or, properly [[basic belief|'basic']]) and warranted without the need for logical or evidential justification, like belief in [[problem of other minds|other minds]] or the [[philosophical skepticism|external world]], rather than inferentially derived from other beliefs; it can, however, be subject to [[defeater]]s, rationally requiring that one give up the belief. Many other philosophers and theologians, however, disagree with this perspective and provide alternative views. Many other theologians have turned to [[continental philosophy]], [[analytic philosophy]], and [[postmodern philosophy]] in attempts to analyze and reframe the Christian theology in contemporary contexts.

== Philosophical theology ==
While philosophical theology can denote an approach to theology which is philosophical in nature, it can also denote a specific area of theology in which philosophical methods and terminology are used to analyze theological concepts. One task of philosophical theologians is to attempt to reconcile certain aspects of Christian doctrine with developments in philosophy. One question concerns how to prove the existence and nature of God. The knowledge of God is dealt with in the [[epistemology]] of [[religion]]. There are many different perspectives with philosophical theology on such questions. In modern times [[process theology]], [[open theism]] and [[Panentheism#Panentheism in Christianity|Christian panentheism]] have tried to look at God as the Being who is not only the Source and Ground of all being but also influenced by the people and processes of the world which he created and to which he belongs—rejecting or at least amending the classical medieval doctrine of [[impassibility]].

== Christology ==
Within [[Christology]], a number of philosophical questions have been raised, such as how the divine can incarnate as a human, how the eternal can enter the temporal, and how the divine and the human can be united in one yet remain distinct. Such questions led to earlier [[heresies]] like [[Arianism]], [[Sabellianism]], [[Docetism]], etc. Often, one's [[Epistemology|epistemic theory]] can play an important role in how one answers such questions. There is, for instance, sometimes a clash between those who want to emphasize the [[rational]] foundation for theology and those who want to emphasize the [[empirical]] foundation for theology. There has also been a contrast made between Christology from above and Christology from below. The former emphasizes the divine side of [[Christ]]; the latter, the human side. The human side obviously tends to look at it more empirically. The Scriptures call the Incarnation as a mystery of godliness.&lt;ref&gt;1 Tim. 3: 16.&lt;/ref&gt; It baffles human imagination, leading many to call it a divine mystery. Yet, philosophical theologians argue that it is also important to find a philosophical ground for asserting both the divinity and humanity of Christ. Others theologians, however, like [[Rudolph Bultmann]], ventured to remove any myths from the Bible, a hermeneutical approach they called [[demythology]]. They have therefore looked at the [[New Testament]] Christology as greatly tampered with and in need of being demythologized. There has been a separation made between the Jesus of history and the Christ of faith (see also the [[Quest for the Historical Jesus]]).

'''Pragmatism''' is a philosophical tradition that began in the United States around 1870.&lt;ref name="Stanford 2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=|author2=|title=Pragmatism|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/pragmatism/|accessdate=13 September 2013|date=13 September 2013|publisher=|isbn=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its origins are often attributed to the philosophers [[William James]], [[John Dewey]], and [[Charles Sanders Peirce]]. Peirce later described it in his [[pragmatic maxim]]: "Consider the practical effects of the objects of your conception. Then, your conception of those effects is the whole of your conception of the object."&lt;ref name=Peirce1878&gt;Peirce, C. S. (1878), "[[s:How to Make Our Ideas Clear|How to Make Our Ideas Clear]]", ''Popular Science Monthly'', v. 12, 286–302. Reprinted often, including ''Collected Papers'' v. 5, paragraphs 388–410 and ''Essential Peirce'' v. 1, 124–41. See end of §II for the pragmatic maxim. See third and fourth paragraphs in §IV for the discoverability of truth and the real by sufficient investigation.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pragmatism considers thought as an instrument or tool for prediction, problem solving and action, and rejects the idea that the function of thought is to describe, represent, or mirror reality.&lt;ref name="Project Gutenberg (2015)"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/5117/5117-h/5117-h.htm|title=The Meaning of Truth|date=1909|publisher=|isbn=|pages=|author1=William James|author2=|accessdate=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pragmatists contend that most philosophical topics—such as the nature of knowledge, language, concepts, meaning, belief, and science—are all best viewed in terms of their practical uses and successes. The philosophy of pragmatism "emphasizes the practical application of ideas by acting on them to actually test them in human experiences".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Philosophical, Ideological, and Theoretical Perspectives On Education|last=Gutek|first=Gerald|publisher=Pearson|year=2014|isbn=978-0-13-285238-8|location=New Jersey|pages=76,100}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pragmatism focuses on a "changing universe rather than an unchanging one as the Idealists, Realists and Thomists had claimed".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Origins==
[[File:Charles Sanders Peirce theb3558.jpg|thumb|right|Charles Peirce: the American [[polymath]] who first identified pragmatism]]

Pragmatism as a philosophical movement began in the [[United States]] in the 1870s.  [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] (and his Pragmatic Maxim) is given credit for its development,&lt;ref name="HaackLane2006"&gt;{{cite book|
author1=Susan Haack|author2=Robert Edwin Lane|authorlink=Susan Haack|title=Pragmatism, old &amp; new: selected writings|date=11 April 2006|

along with later twentieth century contributors, [[William James]] and [[John Dewey]].&lt;ref name="BiestaBurbules"&gt;Biesta, G.J.J. &amp; Burbules, N. (2003). ''Pragmatism and educational research''. Lanham, MD: Rowman and Littlefield.&lt;/ref&gt;  Its direction was determined by [[The Metaphysical Club]] members Charles Sanders Peirce, William James, and [[Chauncey Wright]], as well as John Dewey and [[George Herbert Mead]].

The first use in print of the name ''pragmatism'' was in 1898 by James, who credited Peirce with [[Neologism|coining the term]] during the early 1870s.&lt;ref&gt;James, William (1898), "Philosophical Conceptions and Practical Results", delivered before the Philosophical Union of the University of California at Berkeley, August 26, 1898, and first printed in the ''University Chronicle'' 1, September 1898, pp. 287–310. ''Internet Archive'' [https://archive.org/stream/philosophicalcon00jameuoft#page/n4/mode/1up Eprint]. On [https://archive.org/stream/philosophicalcon00jameuoft#page/290/mode/1up p. 290]: {{quote|I refer to Mr. Charles S. Peirce, with whose very existence as a philosopher I dare say many of you are unacquainted. He is one of the most original of contemporary thinkers; and the principle of practicalism or pragmatism, as he called it, when I first heard him enunciate it at Cambridge in the early [1870s] is the clue or compass by following which I find myself more and more confirmed in believing we may keep our feet upon the proper trail.}}
James credited Peirce again in 1906 lectures published in 1907 as ''[[s:Pragmatism: A New Name for Some Old Ways of Thinking|Pragmatism: A New Name for Some Old Ways of Thinking]]'', see Lecture 2, fourth paragraph.&lt;/ref&gt; James regarded Peirce's "Illustrations of the Logic of Science" series (including "[[s:The Fixation of Belief|The Fixation of Belief]]" (1877), and especially "[[s:How to Make Our Ideas Clear|How to Make Our Ideas Clear]]" (1878)) as the foundation of pragmatism.&lt;ref&gt;See James (1897), ''Will to Believe'' (which James dedicated to Peirce), see p. 124 and footnote via ''Google Books'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=wRMXL4uYEegC&amp;pg=PA124 Eprint]: {{quote|Indeed, it may be said that if two apparently different definitions of the reality before us should have identical consequences, those two definitions would really be identical definitions, made delusively to appear different merely by the different verbiage in which they are expressed.¹&lt;br&gt;¹ See the admirably original "Illustrations of the Logic of Science," by C. S. Peirce, especially the second paper, "How to make our Thoughts clear," {{sic}} in the Popular Science Monthly for January, 1878.}} See also James's 1907 ''[[s:Pragmatism: A New Name for Some Old Ways of Thinking|Pragmatism: A New Name for Some Old Ways of Thinking]]'', Lecture 2, fourth paragraph.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In addition to James's lectures and publications on pragmatist ideas (''Will to Believe'' 1897, etc.) wherein he credited Peirce, James also arranged for two paid series of lectures by Peirce, including the 1903 Harvard lectures on pragmatism. See pp. 261–4, 290–2, &amp; 324 in Brent, Joseph (1998), ''Charles Sanders Peirce: A Life'', 2nd edition.&lt;/ref&gt; Peirce in turn wrote in 1906&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, C. S., "The Founding of Pragmatism", manuscript written 1906, published in ''The Hound &amp; Horn: A Harvard Miscellany'' v. II, n. 3, April–June 1929, pp. 282–5, see 283–4, reprinted 1934 as "Historical Affinities and Genesis" in ''[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#CP|Collected Papers]]'' v. 5, paragraphs 11–13, see 12.&lt;/ref&gt; that [[Nicholas St. John Green]] had been instrumental by emphasizing the importance of applying [[Alexander Bain]]'s definition of belief, which was "that upon which a man is prepared to act". Peirce wrote that "from this definition, pragmatism is scarce more than a corollary; so that I am disposed to think of him as the grandfather of pragmatism". John Shook has said, "Chauncey Wright also deserves considerable credit, for as both Peirce and James recall, it was Wright who demanded a [[phenomenalist]] and [[Fallibilism|fallibilist]] [[empiricism]] as an alternative to rationalistic speculation."&lt;ref&gt;Shook, John (undated), "The Metaphysical Club", the ''Pragmatism Cybrary''. [http://www.pragmatism.org/research/metaphysical_club.htm Eprint].&lt;/ref&gt;

Peirce developed the idea that inquiry depends on real doubt, not mere verbal or [[hyperbolic doubt]],&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, C. S. (1877), [[s:The Fixation of Belief|The Fixation of Belief]], ''Popular Science Monthly'', v. 12, pp. 1–15. Reprited often, including ''Collected Papers'' v. 5, paragraphs 358–87 and ''Essential Peirce'' v. 1, pp. 109–23).&lt;/ref&gt; and said, in order to understand a conception in a fruitful way, "Consider the practical effects of the objects of your conception. Then, your conception of those effects is the whole of your conception of the object",&lt;ref name="Peirce1878"/&gt; which he later called the [[pragmatic maxim]]. It equates any conception of an object to the general extent of the conceivable implications for informed practice of that object's effects.  This is the heart of his pragmatism as a method of experimentational mental reflection arriving at conceptions in terms of conceivable confirmatory and disconfirmatory circumstances—a method hospitable to the generation of explanatory hypotheses, and conducive to the employment and improvement of verification. Typical of Peirce is his concern with inference to explanatory hypotheses as outside the usual foundational alternative between deductivist rationalism and inductivist empiricism, although he was a [[Charles Sanders Peirce#Mathematics|mathematical logician]] and a [[Founders of statistics|founder of statistics]].

Peirce lectured and further wrote on pragmatism to make clear his own interpretation. While framing a conception's meaning in terms of conceivable tests, Peirce emphasized that, since a conception is general, its meaning, its intellectual purport, equates to its acceptance's implications for general practice, rather than to any definite set of real effects (or test results); a conception's clarified meaning points toward its conceivable verifications, but the outcomes are not meanings, but individual upshots. Peirce in 1905 coined the new name [[pragmaticism]] "for the precise purpose of expressing the original definition",&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, on p [https://books.google.com/books?id=j6oLAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA165 p. 165]–166 in "What Pragmatism Is", ''The Monist'', v. XV, n. 2, April 1905, pp. 161–81, reprinted in ''Collected Papers'' v. 5, paragraphs 411–37, see 414.&lt;/ref&gt; saying that "all went happily" with James's and Schiller's variant uses of the old name "pragmatism" and that he nonetheless coined the new name because of the old name's growing use in "literary journals, where it gets abused". Yet in a 1906 manuscript he cited as causes his differences with James and Schiller.&lt;ref&gt;Manuscript "A Sketch of Logical Critics", ''Essential Peirce'' v. 2, pp. 451–62, see pp. 457–8. Peirce wrote:
{{quote|I have always fathered my pragmati''ci''sm (as I have called it since James and Schiller made the word [''pragmatism''] imply "the will to believe," the mutability of truth, the soundness of Zeno's refutation of motion, and pluralism generally), upon Kant, Berkeley, and Leibniz....}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, in a 1908 publication,&lt;ref name=NA&gt;Peirce, C. S. (1908) "[[s:A Neglected Argument for the Reality of God|A Neglected Argument for the Reality of God]]", ''Hibbert Journal'' 7, reprinted in ''Collected Papers'' v. 6, paragraphs 452–85, ''Essential Peirce'' v. 2, 434–50, and elsewhere. After discussing James, Peirce stated (Section V, fourth paragraph) as the specific occasion of his coinage "pragmaticism", journalist, pragmatist, and literary author [[Giovanni Papini]]'s declaration of pragmatism's indefinability (see for example "What Is Pragmatism Like", a translation published in October 1907 in ''Popular Science Monthly'' v. 71, pp. 351–8, ''Google Books'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=DKkWAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA351 Eprint]). Peirce in his closing paragraph wrote that "willing not to exert the will (willing to believe)" should not be confused with "active willing (willing to control thought, to doubt, and to weigh reasons)", and discussed his dismay by that which he called the other pragmatists' "angry hatred of strict logic". He also rejected their [[Nominalism|nominalist]] tendencies. But he remained allied with them about the falsity of necessitarianism and about the reality of generals and habits understood in terms of potential concrete effects even if unactualized.&lt;/ref&gt; his differences with James as well as literary author [[Giovanni Papini]]. Peirce in any case regarded his views that truth is immutable and infinity is real, as being opposed by the other pragmatists, but he remained allied with them on other issues.&lt;ref name=NA /&gt;

Pragmatism enjoyed renewed attention after [[Willard Van Orman Quine]] and [[Wilfrid Sellars]] used a revised pragmatism to criticize [[logical positivism]] in the 1960s. Inspired by the work of Quine and Sellars, a brand of pragmatism known sometimes as [[neopragmatism]] gained influence through [[Richard Rorty]], the most influential of the late twentieth century pragmatists along with [[Hilary Putnam]] and [[Robert Brandom]]. Contemporary pragmatism may be broadly divided into a strict [[Analytic philosophy|analytic tradition]] and a "neo-classical" pragmatism (such as [[Susan Haack]]) that adheres to the work of Peirce, James, and Dewey.

Inspiration for various pragmatists{{citation needed|date=February 2016}} included:
*[[Francis Bacon]] who coined the saying ''{{lang|la|ipsa scientia potestas est}}'' ("knowledge itself is power")
*[[David Hume]] for his [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalistic]] account of knowledge and action
*[[Thomas Reid]], for his [[direct realism]]
*[[Immanuel Kant]], for his [[idealism]] and from whom Peirce derives the name "pragmatism"
*[[G. W. F. Hegel]] who introduced [[temporality]] into philosophy (Pinkard in Misak 2007)
*[[J. S. Mill]] for his [[nominalism]] and [[empiricism]]
*[[George Berkeley]] for his project to eliminate all unclear concepts from philosophy (Peirce 8:33)
*[[Henri Bergson]] who influenced William James to renounce intellectualism and logical methods

== Core tenets ==
{{POV section|date=February 2016|talk=Unbalanced and misleading}}
A few of the various but often interrelated positions characteristic of philosophers working from a pragmatist approach include:

*''[[Epistemology]]'' (''justification''): a [[Coherentism|coherentist]] theory of justification that rejects the claim that all knowledge and justified belief rest ultimately on a foundation of noninferential knowledge or justified belief. Coherentists hold that justification is solely a function of some relationship between beliefs, none of which are privileged beliefs in the way maintained by [[foundationalism|foundationalist]] theories of justification.
*''[[Epistemology]]''' (''truth''): a [[Deflationary theory of truth|deflationary]] or [[Pragmatic theory of truth|pragmatic]] theory of truth; the former is the epistemological claim that assertions that predicate truth of a statement do not attribute a property called truth to such a statement while the latter is the epistemological claim that assertions that predicate truth of a statement attribute the property of useful-to-believe to such a statement.
*''[[Metaphysics]]'': a [[Pluralism (philosophy)|pluralist]] view that there is more than one sound way to conceptualize the world and its content.
*''[[Philosophy of science]]'': an [[Instrumentalism|instrumentalist]] and [[scientific anti-realism|scientific anti-realist]] view that a scientific concept or theory should be evaluated by how effectively it explains and predicts phenomena, as opposed to how accurately it describes objective reality.
*''[[Philosophy of language]]'': an anti-[[representationalist]] view that rejects analyzing the [[Meaning (linguistics)|semantic meaning]] of propositions, mental states, and statements in terms of a correspondence or representational relationship and instead analyzes semantic meaning in terms of notions like dispositions to action, inferential relationships, and/or functional roles (e.g. [[Behaviorism#Behaviorism in philosophy|behaviorism]] and [[inferentialism]]). Not to be confused with [[pragmatics]], a sub-field of [[linguistics]] with no relation to philosophical pragmatism.
*Additionally, forms of [[empiricism]], [[fallibilism]], [[verificationism]], and a [[Naturalized epistemology|Quinean naturalist]] metaphilosophy are all commonly elements of pragmatist philosophies. Many pragmatists are [[Factual relativism|epistemological relativists]] and see this to be an important facet of their pragmatism, but this is controversial and other pragmatists argue such relativism to be seriously misguided (e.g. [[Hilary Putnam]], [[Susan Haack]]).

===Anti-reification of concepts and theories===
Dewey, in ''The Quest For Certainty'', criticized what he called "the philosophical fallacy":- philosophers often take categories (such as the mental and the physical) for granted because they don't realize that these are merely [[Nominalism|nominal]] concepts that were invented to help solve specific problems. This causes metaphysical and conceptual confusion. Various examples are the "[[ultimate Being]]" of [[Hegelian]] philosophers, the belief in a "[[realm of value]]", the idea that logic, because it is an abstraction from concrete thought, has nothing to do with the act of concrete thinking, and so on.{{Weasel inline|date=April 2014}}{{nonspecific|date=February 2016}} David L. Hildebrand sums up the problem: "Perceptual inattention to the specific functions comprising inquiry led realists and idealists alike to formulate accounts of knowledge that project the products of extensive abstraction back onto experience." (Hildebrand 2003){{nonspecific|date=February 2016}}

===Naturalism and anti-Cartesianism===
From the outset, pragmatists wanted to reform philosophy and bring it more in line with the scientific method as they understood it. They argued that idealist and realist philosophy had a tendency to present human knowledge as something beyond what science could grasp. They held that these philosophies then resorted either to a phenomenology inspired by Kant or to [[Correspondence theory of truth|correspondence theories of knowledge and truth]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}} Pragmatists criticized the former for its [[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]sm, and the latter because it takes [[Correspondence theory of truth|correspondence]] as an unanalyzable fact. Pragmatism instead tries to explain the relation between ''knower'' and ''known''.

In 1868,&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, C. S. (1868) "Questions Concerning Certain Faculties Claimed For Man", ''Journal of Speculative Philosophy'' v. 2, n. 2, pp. 103–114. Reprinted ''Collected Peirce'' v. 5, paragraphs 213–263, ''Writings'' v. 2, pp. 193–211, ''Essential Peirce'' v. 2, pp. 11–27, and elsewhere. ''Peirce.org'' [http://www.peirce.org/writings/p26.html Eprint]. ''Google Books'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=YHkqP2JHJ_IC&amp;pg=RA1-PA140 Eprint].&lt;/ref&gt; C.S. Peirce argued that there is no power of ''intuition'' in the sense of a cognition unconditioned by inference, and no power of introspection, intuitive or otherwise, and that awareness of an internal world is by hypothetical inference from external facts. Introspection and intuition were staple philosophical tools at least since Descartes. He argued that there is no absolutely first cognition in a cognitive process; such a process has its beginning but can always be analyzed into finer cognitive stages. That which we call introspection does not give privileged access to knowledge about the mind—the self is a concept that is derived from our interaction with the external world and not the other way around (De Waal 2005, pp.&amp;nbsp;7–10). At the same time he held persistently that pragmatism and epistemology in general could not be derived from principles of psychology understood as a special science:&lt;ref&gt;Kasser, Jeff (1998), "Peirce's Supposed Psychologism" in ''Transactions of the Charles S. Peirce Society'', v. 35, n. 3, summer 1999, pp. 501–527. ''Arisbe'' [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/aboutcsp/kasser/psychol.htm Eprint].&lt;/ref&gt; what we ''do'' think is too different from what we ''should'' think; in his "[[Charles Sanders Peirce bibliography#illus|Illustrations of the Logic of Science]]" series, Peirce formulated both pragmatism and principles of statistics as aspects of scientific method in general.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce held that (philosophical) logic is a [[normative]] field, that pragmatism is a method developed in it, and that philosophy, though not deductive or so general as mathematics, still concerns positive phenomena in general, including phenomena of matter and mind, without depending on special experiences or experiments such as those of [[optics]] and [[experimental psychology]], in both of which Peirce was active. See quotes under "[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/philosophy.html Philosophy]" at the ''Commens Dictionary of Peirce's Terms''. Peirce also harshly criticized the Cartesian approach of starting from hyperbolic doubts rather than from the combination of established beliefs and genuine doubts. See the opening of his 1868 "Some Consequences of Four Incapacities", ''Journal of Speculative Philosophy'' v. 2, n. 3, pp. 140–157. Reprinted ''Collected Papers'' v. 5, paragraphs 264–317, ''Writings'' v. 2, pp. 211–42, and ''Essential Peirce'' v. 1, pp. 28–55. [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/bycsp/conseq/cn-frame.htm Eprint].&lt;/ref&gt; This is an important point of disagreement with most other pragmatists, who advocate a more thorough naturalism and psychologism.

Richard Rorty expanded on these and other arguments in ''[[Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature]]'' in which he criticized attempts by many philosophers of science to carve out a space for epistemology that is entirely unrelated to—and sometimes thought of as superior to—the empirical sciences. W.V. Quine, instrumental in bringing [[naturalized epistemology]] back into favor with his essay ''Epistemology Naturalized'' (Quine 1969), also criticized "traditional" epistemology and its "Cartesian dream" of absolute certainty. The dream, he argued, was impossible in practice as well as misguided in theory, because it separates epistemology from scientific inquiry.

[[File:Hilary Putnam.jpg|thumb|right|Hilary Putnam asserts that the combination of antiskepticism and fallibilism is a central feature of pragmatism.]]

===Reconciliation of anti-skepticism and fallibilism===
[[Hilary Putnam]] has suggested that the reconciliation of anti-skepticism&lt;ref&gt;[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/skepticism-content-externalism/ ''Skeptcism and Content Externalism''] provides a definition of anti-skepsis&lt;/ref&gt; and [[fallibilism]] is the central goal of American pragmatism.{{citation needed|reason=Reference needed on Putnam's reconciliation of anti-skepticism and fallibilism, preferably a secondary source referring to primary sources|date=March 2016}} Although all human knowledge is partial, with no ability to take a "God's-eye-view," this does not necessitate a globalized skeptical attitude, a radical [[philosophical skepticism]] (as distinguished from that which is called [[scientific skepticism]]). Peirce insisted that (1) in reasoning, there is the presupposition, and at least the hope,&lt;ref&gt;Peirce (1902), The Carnegie Institute Application, Memoir 10, MS L75.361-2, ''Arisbe'' [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/bycsp/l75/ver1/l75v1-04.htm#m10 Eprint].&lt;/ref&gt; that truth and the real are discoverable and ''would'' be discovered, sooner or later but still inevitably, by investigation taken far enough,&lt;ref name=Peirce1878/&gt; and (2) contrary to Descartes' famous and influential methodology in the ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy]]'', doubt cannot be feigned or created by verbal ''fiat'' to motivate fruitful inquiry, and much less can philosophy begin in universal doubt.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, C. S. (1868), "Some Consequences of Four Incapacities", ''Journal of Speculative Philosophy'' v. 2, n. 3, p [https://books.google.com/books?id=YHkqP2JHJ_IC&amp;pg=RA1-PA140 p. 140]–57, see opening pages. Reprinted ''Collected Papers'' v. 5, paragraphs 264–317, ''Writings'' v. 2, pp. 211–42, ''Essential Peirce'' v. 1, pp. 28–55. Peirce.org [http://www.peirce.org/writings/p27.html Eprint].&lt;/ref&gt; Doubt, like belief, requires justification. Genuine doubt irritates and inhibits, in the sense that belief is that upon which one is prepared to act.&lt;ref name=Peirce1878/&gt; It arises from confrontation with some specific recalcitrant matter of fact (which Dewey called a "situation"), which unsettles our belief in some specific proposition. Inquiry is then the rationally self-controlled process of attempting to return to a settled state of belief about the matter. Note that anti-skepticism is a reaction to modern academic skepticism in the wake of Descartes. The pragmatist insistence that all knowledge is tentative is quite congenial to the older skeptical tradition.

===Pragmatist theory of truth and epistemology===
{{main article|Pragmatic theory of truth}}
Pragmatism was not the first to apply evolution to theories of knowledge: [[Schopenhauer]] advocated a ''biological idealism'' as what's useful to an organism to believe might differ wildly from what is true. Here knowledge and action are portrayed as two separate spheres with an absolute or transcendental truth above and beyond any sort of inquiry organisms used to cope with life. Pragmatism challenges this idealism by providing an "ecological" account of knowledge: inquiry is how organisms can get a grip on their environment. ''Real'' and ''true'' are functional labels in inquiry and cannot be understood outside of this context. It is not ''realist'' in a traditionally robust sense of realism (what [[Hilary Putnam]] would later call [[metaphysical realism]]), but it is [[Philosophical realism|realist]] in how it acknowledges an external world which must be dealt with.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

Many of James' best-turned phrases—''truth's cash value'' (James 1907, p.&amp;nbsp;200) and ''the true is only the expedient in our way of thinking'' (James 1907, p.&amp;nbsp;222)—were taken out of context and caricatured in contemporary literature as representing the view where any idea with practical utility is true. William James wrote:

{{quotation|It is high time to urge the use of a little imagination in philosophy. The unwillingness of some of our critics to read any but the silliest of possible meanings into our statements is as discreditable to their imaginations as anything I know in recent philosophic history. Schiller says the truth is that which "works." Thereupon he is treated as one who limits verification to the lowest material utilities. Dewey says truth is what gives "satisfaction"! He is treated as one who believes in calling everything true which, if it were true, would be pleasant. (James 1907, p. 90)}}

In reality, James asserts, the theory is a great deal more subtle. (See Dewey 1910 for a "FAQ.")

The role of belief in representing [[reality]] is widely debated in pragmatism. Is a belief valid when it represents reality? ''Copying is one (and only one) genuine mode of knowing,'' (James 1907, p.&amp;nbsp;91). Are beliefs dispositions which qualify as true or false depending on how helpful they prove in inquiry and in action? Is it only in the struggle of [[Intelligence|intelligent]] [[organism]]s with the surrounding environment that beliefs acquire meaning? Does a belief only become true when it succeeds in this struggle? In Pragmatism nothing practical or useful is held to be [[Logical truth|necessarily true]], nor is anything which helps to survive merely in the short term. For example, to believe my [[cheating]] spouse is faithful may help me feel better now, but it is certainly not useful from a more long-term perspective because it doesn't accord with the facts (and is therefore not true).

==In other fields of philosophy==
While pragmatism started out simply as a criterion of meaning, it quickly expanded to become a full-fledged epistemology with wide-ranging implications for the entire philosophical field. Pragmatists who work in these fields share a common inspiration, but their work is diverse and there are no received views.

===Philosophy of science&lt;!--'Conceptual pragmatism' redirects here--&gt;===
In the philosophy of science, [[instrumentalism]] is the view that concepts and theories are merely useful instruments and progress in science cannot be couched in terms of concepts and theories somehow mirroring reality. Instrumentalist philosophers often define scientific progress as nothing more than an improvement in explaining and predicting phenomena. Instrumentalism does not state that truth does not matter, but rather provides a specific answer to the question of what truth and falsity mean and how they function in science.

One of [[C. I. Lewis]]' main arguments in ''Mind and the World Order: Outline of a Theory of Knowledge'' (1929) was that science does not merely provide a copy of reality but must work with conceptual systems and that those are chosen for pragmatic reasons, that is, because they aid inquiry. Lewis' own development of multiple [[modal logic]]s is a case in point. Lewis is sometimes called a proponent of '''conceptual pragmatism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; because of this.&lt;ref&gt;Sandra B. Rosenthal, ''C. I. Lewis in Focus: The Pulse of Pragmatism'', Indiana University Press, 2007, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another development is the cooperation of [[logical positivism]] and pragmatism in the works of [[Charles W. Morris]] and [[Rudolf Carnap]]. The influence of pragmatism on these writers is mostly limited to the incorporation of the [[pragmatic maxim]] into their epistemology. Pragmatists with a broader conception of the movement do not often refer to them.

[[W. V. Quine]]'s paper "[[Two Dogmas of Empiricism]]", published 1951, is one of the most celebrated papers of twentieth-century philosophy in the analytic tradition. The paper is an attack on two central tenets of the logical positivists' philosophy. One is the distinction between analytic statements (tautologies and contradictions) whose truth (or falsehood) is a function of the meanings of the words in the statement ('all bachelors are unmarried'), and synthetic statements, whose truth (or falsehood) is a function of (contingent) states of affairs. The other is reductionism, the theory that each meaningful statement gets its meaning from some logical construction of terms which refers exclusively to immediate experience. Quine's argument brings to mind Peirce's insistence that axioms are not a priori truths but synthetic statements.

===Logic===
Later in his life Schiller became famous for his attacks on logic in his textbook, ''Formal Logic''. By then, Schiller's pragmatism had become the nearest of any of the classical pragmatists to an [[ordinary language philosophy]]. Schiller sought to undermine the very possibility of formal logic, by showing that words only had meaning when used in context. The least famous of Schiller's main works was the constructive sequel to his destructive book ''Formal Logic''. In this sequel, ''Logic for Use'', Schiller attempted to construct a new logic to replace the formal logic that he had criticized in ''Formal Logic''. What he offers is something philosophers would recognize today as a logic covering the context of discovery and the hypothetico-deductive method.

Whereas [[F. C. S. Schiller]] dismissed the possibility of formal logic, most pragmatists are critical rather of its pretension to ultimate validity and see logic as one logical tool among others—or perhaps, considering the multitude of formal logics, one ''set'' of tools among others. This is the view of C. I. Lewis. C. S. Peirce developed multiple methods for doing formal logic.

[[Stephen Toulmin]]'s ''The Uses of Argument'' inspired scholars in informal logic and rhetoric studies (although it is an epistemological work).

===Metaphysics===
James and Dewey were [[empiricism|empirical]] thinkers in the most straightforward fashion: experience is the ultimate test and experience is what needs to be explained. They were dissatisfied with ordinary empiricism because in the tradition dating from Hume, empiricists had a tendency to think of experience as nothing more than individual sensations. To the pragmatists, this went against the spirit of empiricism: we should try to explain all that is given in experience including connections and meaning, instead of explaining them away and positing sense data as the ultimate reality. [[Radical empiricism]], or Immediate Empiricism in Dewey's words, wants to give a place to meaning and value instead of explaining them away as subjective additions to a world of whizzing atoms.

[[File:Chicago Club 1896.jpg|thumb|right|The "Chicago Club" including Mead, Dewey, Angell, and Moore. Pragmatism is sometimes called ''American Pragmatism'' because so many of its proponents were and are Americans.]]
William James gives an interesting example of this philosophical shortcoming:
{{quotation|[A young graduate] began by saying that he had always taken for granted that when you entered a philosophic classroom you had to open relations with a universe entirely distinct from the one you left behind you in the street. The two were supposed, he said, to have so little to do with each other, that you could not possibly occupy your mind with them at the same time. The world of concrete personal experiences to which the street belongs is multitudinous beyond imagination, tangled, muddy, painful and perplexed. The world to which your philosophy-professor introduces you is simple, clean and noble. The contradictions of real life are absent from it. [...] In point of fact it is far less an account of this actual world than a clear addition built upon it [...] It is no explanation of our concrete universe (James 1907, pp. 8–9)}}

[[F. C. S. Schiller]]'s first book, ''Riddles of the Sphinx'', was published before he became aware of the growing pragmatist movement taking place in America. In it, Schiller argues for a middle ground between materialism and absolute metaphysics.  These opposites are comparable to what William James called tough-minded empiricism and tender-minded rationalism. Schiller contends on the one hand that mechanistic naturalism cannot make sense of the "higher" aspects of our world. These include freewill, consciousness, purpose, universals and some would add God. On the other hand, abstract metaphysics cannot make sense of the "lower" aspects of our world (e.g. the imperfect, change, physicality). While Schiller is vague about the exact sort of middle ground he is trying to establish, he suggests that metaphysics is a tool that can aid inquiry, but that it is valuable only insofar as it does help in explanation.

In the second half of the twentieth century, [[Stephen Toulmin]] argued that the need to distinguish between reality and appearance only arises within an explanatory scheme and therefore that there is no point in asking what "ultimate reality" consists of. More recently, a similar idea has been suggested by the [[postanalytic philosophy|postanalytic philosopher]] [[Daniel Dennett]], who argues that anyone who wants to understand the world has to acknowledge both the "syntactical" aspects of reality (i.e., whizzing atoms) and its emergent or "semantic" properties (i.e., meaning and value).{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

Radical Empiricism gives interesting answers to questions about the limits of science if there are any, the nature of meaning and value and the workability of [[reductionism]]. These questions feature prominently in current debates about the [[relationship between religion and science]], where it is often assumed—most pragmatists would disagree—that science degrades everything that is meaningful into "merely" [[materialism|physical phenomena]].

===Philosophy of mind===
Both [[John Dewey]] in ''Experience and Nature'' (1929) and half a century later [[Richard Rorty]] in his ''Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature'' (1979) argued that much of the debate about the relation of the mind to the body results from conceptual confusions. They argue instead that there is no need to posit the mind or mindstuff as an [[ontological]] category.

Pragmatists disagree over whether philosophers ought to adopt a quietist or a naturalist stance toward the mind-body problem. The former (Rorty among them) want to do away with the problem because they believe it's a pseudo-problem, whereas the latter believe that it is a meaningful empirical question.

===Ethics===
{{main article|Pragmatic ethics}}

Pragmatism sees no fundamental difference between practical and theoretical reason, nor any ontological difference between facts and values. Both facts and values have cognitive content: knowledge is what we should believe; values are hypotheses about what is good in action. Pragmatist ethics is broadly [[humanism|humanist]] because it sees no ultimate test of morality beyond what matters for us as humans. Good values are those for which we have good reasons, viz. the [[Good Reasons approach]]. The pragmatist formulation pre-dates those of other philosophers who have stressed important similarities between values and facts such as [[Jerome Schneewind]] and [[John Searle]].

[[File:william james small.png|thumb|right|William James tried to show the meaningfulness of (some kinds of) spirituality but, like other pragmatists, did not see religion as the basis of meaning or morality.]]
William James' contribution to ethics, as laid out in his essay ''The Will to Believe'' has often been misunderstood as a plea for relativism or irrationality. On its own terms it argues that ethics always involves a certain degree of trust or faith and that we cannot always wait for adequate proof when making moral decisions.
{{quotation|Moral questions immediately present themselves as questions whose solution cannot wait for sensible proof. A moral question is a question not of what sensibly exists, but of what is good, or would be good if it did exist. [...] A social organism of any sort whatever, large or small, is what it is because each member proceeds to his own duty with a trust that the other members will simultaneously do theirs. Wherever a desired result is achieved by the co-operation of many independent persons, its existence as a fact is a pure consequence of the precursive faith in one another of those immediately concerned. A government, an army, a commercial system, a ship, a college, an athletic team, all exist on this condition, without which not only is nothing achieved, but nothing is even attempted. ([http://falcon.jmu.edu/~omearawm/ph101willtobelieve.html The Will to Believe] James 1896)}}

Of the classical pragmatists, John Dewey wrote most extensively about morality and democracy. (Edel 1993) In his classic article ''Three Independent Factors in Morals'' (Dewey 1930), he tried to integrate three basic philosophical perspectives on morality: the right, the virtuous and the good. He held that while all three provide meaningful ways to think about moral questions, the possibility of conflict among the three elements cannot always be easily solved. (Anderson, SEP)

Dewey also criticized the dichotomy between means and ends which he saw as responsible for the degradation of our everyday working lives and education, both conceived as merely a means to an end. He stressed the need for meaningful labor and a conception of education that viewed it not as a preparation for life but as life itself. (Dewey 2004 [1910] ch. 7; Dewey 1997 [1938], p.&amp;nbsp;47)

Dewey was opposed to other ethical philosophies of his time, notably the [[emotivism]] of [[Alfred Ayer]]. Dewey envisioned the possibility of ethics as an experimental discipline, and thought values could best be characterized not as feelings or imperatives, but as hypotheses about what actions will lead to satisfactory results or what he termed ''consummatory experience''. A further implication of this view is that ethics is a fallible undertaking, since human beings are frequently unable to know what would satisfy them.

During the late 1900s and first decade of 2000, pragmatism was embraced by many in the field of [[bioethics]] led by the philosophers [[John Lachs]] and his student [[Glenn McGee]], whose 1997 book "'The Perfect Baby: A Pragmatic Approach to Genetic Engineering'" (see [[designer baby]]) garnered praise from within classical [[American philosophy]] and criticism from bioethics for its development of a theory of pragmatic bioethics and its rejection of the principalism theory then in vogue in [[medical ethics]]. An anthology published by The MIT Press, "'Pragmatic Bioethics'" included the responses of philosophers to that debate, including Micah Hester, Griffin Trotter and others many of whom developed their own theories based on the work of Dewey, Peirce, Royce and others. Lachs himself developed several applications of pragmatism to bioethics independent of but extending from the work of Dewey and James.

A recent pragmatist contribution to [[meta-ethics]] is Todd Lekan's "Making Morality" (Lekan 2003). Lekan argues that morality is a fallible but rational practice and that it has traditionally been misconceived as based on theory or principles. Instead, he argues, theory and rules arise as tools to make practice more intelligent.

===Aesthetics===
John Dewey's ''Art as Experience'', based on the William James lectures he delivered at [[Harvard University|Harvard]], was an attempt to show the integrity of art, culture and everyday experience (''IEP''). Art, for Dewey, is or should be a part of everyone's creative lives and not just the privilege of a select group of artists. He also emphasizes that the audience is more than a passive recipient. Dewey's treatment of art was a move away from the [[Transcendence (philosophy)|transcendental]] approach to [[aesthetics]] in the wake of [[Immanuel Kant]] who emphasized the unique character of art and the disinterested nature of aesthetic appreciation. A notable contemporary pragmatist aesthetician is [[Joseph Margolis]]. He defines a work of art as "a physically embodied, culturally emergent entity", a human "utterance" that isn't an ontological quirk but in line with other human activity and culture in general. He emphasizes that works of art are complex and difficult to fathom, and that no determinate interpretation can be given.

===Philosophy of religion===
Both Dewey and James investigated the role that religion can still play in contemporary society, the former in ''A Common Faith'' and the latter in ''The Varieties of Religious Experience''.

From a general point of view, for William James, something is true ''only insofar'' as it works. Thus, the statement, for example, that prayer is heard may work on a psychological level but (a) may not help to bring about the things you pray for (b) may be better explained by referring to its soothing effect than by claiming prayers are heard. As such, pragmatism is not antithetical to religion but it is not an apologetic for faith either. James' metaphysical position however, leaves open the possibility that the ontological claims of religions may be true. As he observed in the end of the Varieties, his position does not amount to a denial of the existence of transcendent realities. Quite the contrary, he argued for the legitimate epistemic right to believe in such realities, since such beliefs do make a difference in an individual's life and refer to claims that cannot be verified or falsified either on intellectual or common sensorial grounds.

[[Joseph Margolis]], in ''Historied Thought, Constructed World'' (California, 1995), makes a distinction between "existence" and "reality". He suggests using the term "exists" only for those things which adequately exhibit Peirce's ''Secondness'': things which offer brute physical resistance to our movements. In this way, such things which affect us, like numbers, may be said to be "real", although they do not "exist". Margolis suggests that God, in such a linguistic usage, might very well be "real", causing believers to act in such and such a way, but might not "exist".

==Neopragmatism&lt;!--'Radical pragmatism' and 'Methodological pragmatism' redirect here--&gt;==
{{main|Neopragmatism}}
[[Neopragmatism]] is a broad contemporary category used for various thinkers that incorporate important insights of, and yet significantly diverge from, the classical pragmatists. This divergence may occur either in their philosophical methodology (many of them are loyal to the analytic tradition) or in conceptual formation.&lt;ref&gt;[[Conceptual pragmatism|Conceptual pragmatist]] [[C. I. Lewis]] was very critical of Dewey; [[neopragmatist]] [[Richard Rorty]] dislikes Peirce&lt;/ref&gt; Important [[Analytic pragmatism|analytic pragmatists]] include early [[Richard Rorty]] (who was the first to develop neopragmatist philosophy in his ''[[Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature]]'' (1979),&lt;ref name=IEP&gt;[https://www.iep.utm.edu/pragmati/ Pragmatism – Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hilary Putnam]], [[W. V. O. Quine]], and [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]]. Brazilian social thinker [[Roberto Unger]] advocates for a '''radical pragmatism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;, one that "de-naturalizes" society and culture, and thus insists that we can "transform the character of our relation to social and cultural worlds we inhabit rather than just to change, little by little, the content of the arrangements and beliefs that comprise them".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Unger|first=Roberto|title=The Self Awakened: Pragmatism Unbound|year=2007|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-03496-9|pages=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Late Rorty and [[Jürgen Habermas]] are closer to [[Continental philosophy|Continental thought]].

Neopragmatist thinkers who are more loyal to classical pragmatism include [[Sidney Hook]] and [[Susan Haack]] (known for the theory of [[foundherentism]]). Many pragmatist ideas (especially those of Peirce) find a natural expression in the decision-theoretic reconstruction of epistemology pursued in the work of [[Isaac Levi]]. [[Nicholas Rescher]] advocates his version of '''methodological pragmatism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;, based on construing pragmatic efficacy not as a replacement for truths but as a means to its evidentiation.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Rescher, "Methodological Pragmatism", ''Journal of Philosophy'' '''76'''(6):338–342 (1979).&lt;/ref&gt; Rescher is also a proponent of [[pragmatic idealism]].

Not all pragmatists are easily characterized. With the advent of [[postanalytic philosophy]] and the diversification of Anglo-American philosophy, many philosophers were influenced by pragmatist thought without necessarily publicly committing themselves to that philosophical school. [[Daniel Dennett]], a student of Quine's, falls into this category, as does [[Stephen Toulmin]], who arrived at his philosophical position via [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgenstein]], whom he calls "a pragmatist of a sophisticated kind" (foreword for Dewey 1929 in the 1988 edition, p. xiii). Another example is [[Mark Johnson (professor)|Mark Johnson]] whose [[embodied philosophy]] (Lakoff and Johnson 1999) shares its psychologism, direct realism and anti-cartesianism with pragmatism. Conceptual pragmatism is a theory of knowledge originating with the work of the philosopher and logician [[Clarence Irving Lewis]]. The epistemology of conceptual pragmatism was first formulated in the 1929 book ''Mind and the World Order: Outline of a Theory of Knowledge''.

French pragmatism is attended with theorists such as [[Bruno Latour]], [[Michel Crozier]], [[Luc Boltanski]], and [[Laurent Thévenot]]. It is often seen as opposed to structural problems connected to the French [[critical theory]] of [[Pierre Bourdieu]].

==Legacy and contemporary relevance==
In the twentieth century, the movements of [[logical positivism]] and [[ordinary language philosophy]] have similarities with pragmatism. Like pragmatism, logical positivism provides a verification criterion of meaning that is supposed to rid us of nonsense metaphysics, however, logical positivism doesn't stress action as pragmatism does. The pragmatists rarely used their maxim of meaning to rule out all metaphysics as nonsense. Usually, pragmatism was put forth to correct metaphysical doctrines or to construct empirically verifiable ones rather than to provide a wholesale rejection.

[[Ordinary language philosophy]] is closer to pragmatism than other [[philosophy of language]] because of its [[nominalism|nominalist]] character and because it takes the broader functioning of language in an environment as its focus instead of investigating abstract relations between ''language'' and ''world''.

Pragmatism has ties to [[process philosophy]]. Much of their work developed in dialogue with process philosophers such as [[Henri Bergson]] and [[Alfred North Whitehead]], who aren't usually considered pragmatists because they differ so much on other points. (Douglas Browning et al. 1998; Rescher, SEP)

[[Behaviorism]] and [[Functional psychology|functionalism]] in psychology and sociology also have ties to pragmatism, which is not surprising considering that James and Dewey were both scholars of psychology and that [[George Herbert Mead|Mead]] became a sociologist.

[[Utilitarianism]] has some significant parallels to Pragmatism and [[John Stuart Mill]] espoused similar values.

Pragmatism emphasizes the connection between thought and action. Applied fields like [[public administration]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Patricia M. Shields]]. 2008.

Stillwater, OK: New Forums Press. Shields relies primarily on Dewey's logic of Inquiry.&lt;/ref&gt; have incorporated the tenets of pragmatism in their field. Often this connection is made using Dewey and Addams's expansive notion of democracy.

=== Effects on social sciences ===
[[Symbolic interactionism]], a major perspective within sociological social psychology, was derived from pragmatism in the early twentieth century, especially the work of [[George Herbert Mead]] and [[Charles Cooley]], as well as that of [[Charles Sanders Peirce|Peirce]] and [[William James]].&lt;ref&gt;Stryker, S. (1980). ''Symbolic Interactionism: A Social Structural Version.''. Benjamin/Cummings Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;

Increasing attention is being given to pragmatist epistemology in other branches of the social sciences, which have struggled with divisive debates over the status of social scientific knowledge.&lt;ref name="BiestaBurbules" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baert, P. (2004). "Pragmatism as a philosophy of the social sciences." ''European Journal of Social Theory'', 7(3), 355–369.&lt;/ref&gt;

Enthusiasts suggest that pragmatism offers an approach which is both pluralist and practical.&lt;ref&gt;Cornish, F. &amp; Gillespie, A. (2009). [https://gcal.academia.edu/FloraCornish/Papers/107681/A-pragmatist-approach-to-the-problem-of-knowledge-in-health-psychology A pragmatist approach to the problem of knowledge in health psychology] ''Journal of Health Psychology'', 14(6), 1–10.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Effects on public administration ===
{{One-nation conservatism}}
The classical pragmatism of [[John Dewey]], [[William James]], and [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] has influenced research in the field of [[Public Administration]]. Scholars claim classical pragmatism had a profound influence on the origin of the field of public administration.&lt;ref&gt;[[Patricia M. Shields]]. 2008. Rediscovering the Taproot: Is Classical Pragmatism the Route to Renew Public Administration? ''Public Administration Review'' 68(2), 205–221&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hildebrand, David L. 2008. Public Administration as Pragmatic, Democratic and Objective. ''Public Administration Review''. 68(2), 222–229&lt;/ref&gt; At the most basic level, public administrators are responsible for making programs "work" in a pluralistic, problems-oriented environment. Public administrators are also responsible for the day-to-day work with citizens. Dewey's [[participatory democracy]] can be applied in this environment. Dewey and James' notion of theory as a tool, helps administrators craft theories to resolve policy and administrative problems. Further, the birth of American [[public administration]] coincides closely with the period of greatest influence of the classical pragmatists.

Which pragmatism (classical pragmatism or neo-pragmatism) makes the most sense in [[public administration]] has been the source of debate. The debate began when [[Patricia M. Shields]] introduced Dewey's notion of the Community of Inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;Shields, Patricia 2003. The community of Inquiry: Classical Pragmatism and Public Administration." Administration &amp; Society 35(5): 510–538. [http://aas.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/35/5/510 abstract]&lt;/ref&gt; Hugh Miller objected to one element of the community of inquiry (problematic situation, scientific attitude, [[participatory democracy]]): scientific attitude.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Hugh. 2004.

Stillwater, OK: New Forums Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

The health sector's administrators' use of pragmatism has been criticized as incomplete in its pragmatism, however,&lt;ref&gt;Gillespie, A. &amp; Cornish, F. (2009). [https://lse.academia.edu/AlexGillespie/Papers/1347647/A_pragmatist_approach_to_the_problem_of_knowledge_in_health_psychology A pragmatist approach to the problem of knowledge in health psychology]. Journal of Health Psychology, 14, 800–809&lt;/ref&gt; according to the classical pragmatists, knowledge is always shaped by human interests. The administrator's focus on "outcomes" simply advances their own interest, and this focus on outcomes often undermines their citizen's interests, which often are more concerned with process. On the other hand, David Brendel argues that pragmatism's ability to bridge dualisms, focus on practical problems, include multiple perspectives, incorporate participation from interested parties (patient, family, health team), and provisional nature makes it well suited to address problems in this area.&lt;ref&gt;Brendel, David. 2006. ''Healing Psychiatry: Bridging the Science/Humanism Divide''. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Effects on feminism ===
Since the mid 1990s, feminist philosophers have re-discovered classical pragmatism as a source of feminist theories. Works by Seigfried,&lt;ref&gt;Seigfried, C.H. (2001). Feminist interpretations of John Dewey. University Park: Pennsylvania State University Press; Seigfried, C.H. (1996). Pragmatism and feminism: Reweaving the social fabric. Chicago: The University of Chicago Press; Seigfried, C. H. (1992). Where are all the pragmatists feminists? Hypatia, 6, 8–21.&lt;/ref&gt; Duran,&lt;ref&gt;Duran, J. (2001). A holistically Deweyan feminism. Metaphilosophy, 32, 279–292. Duran, J. (1993). The intersection of pragmatism and feminism. Hypatia, 8&lt;/ref&gt; Keith,&lt;ref&gt;Keith, H. (1999). Feminism and pragmatism: George Herbert Mead’s ethics of care. Transactions of the Charles S. Peirce Society, 35, 328–344.&lt;/ref&gt; and Whipps&lt;ref&gt;Whipps, J. D. (2004). Jane Addams social thought as a model for a pragmatist-feminist communitarianism. Hypatia, 19, 118–113.&lt;/ref&gt; explore the historic and philosophic links between feminism and pragmatism. The connection between pragmatism and feminism took so long to be rediscovered because pragmatism itself was eclipsed by logical positivism during the middle decades of the twentieth century. As a result, it was lost from femininist discourse. The very features of pragmatism that led to its decline are the characteristics that feminists now consider its greatest strength. These are "persistent and early criticisms of positivist interpretations of scientific methodology; disclosure of value dimension of factual claims"; viewing aesthetics as informing everyday experience; subordinating logical analysis to political, cultural, and social issues; linking the dominant discourses with domination; "realigning theory with praxis; and resisting the turn to epistemology and instead emphasizing concrete experience".&lt;ref&gt;Seigfried, C.H. (1996). ''Pragmatism and Feminism: Reweaving the Social Fabric''. Chicago: The University of Chicago Press. p. 21&lt;/ref&gt; These feminist philosophers point to [[Jane Addams]] as a founder of classical pragmatism. In addition, the ideas of Dewey, Mead, and James are consistent with many feminist tenets. Jane Addams, John Dewey, and George Herbert Mead developed their philosophies as all three became friends, influenced each other, and were engaged in the Hull-House experience and women’s rights causes.

=== Effects on urbanism ===
Pragmatism values and evaluates the effects of a design on [[Urbanism|urban transformation]], and the effects of a concept or design alters the overall understanding of the concept.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, Charles Sanders. 1958. "How to make our ideas clear", ed. Paul Weiss Charles Harthstorne. Vol. 7–8. Cambridge MA: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Rorty]] mentions that "a sea change" is occurring in recent philosophical thought – "a change so profound that we may not recognize that it is occurring". While the world that the movement is rooted in has had many changes, as a frame to perceive the world, pragmatism also has experienced different levels of modifications. Those changes are very relevant to the development of cities and basic themes, such as [[anti-foundationalism]], [[fallibilism]], [[Community of inquiry|community as inquirers]], questioning the sharp distinction between theory and practice, [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralism]], and [[democracy]], of pragmatism may be applied to the urbanism even more strongly.

[[Vincent di Norcia]] argues that a pragmatic approach is suitable regarding social issues because it requires a conduct that resolves problems as it continuously assesses the practical effects of a project. This secures the interest for the stakeholders and Norcia stresses the importance of social and cognitive pluralism. Social pluralism means that we should recognize all stake holder's interest that are affected by a certain decision, without putting weight on elite political or economic group's interests. As a complement Norcia also stresses cognitive pluralism, which indicates that one should include all kinds of knowledge that are relevant to a problem.&lt;ref&gt;Norcia, Vincent di. 2002. "Pluralism, pragmatism and social problems." ''Journal of Canadian Studies'' 37 (3): 239.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
In the 1908 essay "The Thirteen Pragmatisms", [[Arthur Oncken Lovejoy]] argues that there's significant ambiguity in the notion of the effects of the ''truth'' of a proposition and those of ''belief'' in a proposition in order to highlight that many pragmatists had failed to recognize that distinction.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://books.google.com/books?id=0ATV5bb3ZsQC&amp;pg=PA159&amp;lpg=PA159&amp;dq=Arthur+Lovejoy+%22Thirteen+Pragmatisms%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=y5fb_zAjG_&amp;sig=yTplB16a_MPxBvqvJPvEPanm8AA&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=9g5dSpCLBYvysgOW7ZCvCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4 The Thirteen Pragmatisms], The Journal of Philosophy, Psychology, and Scientific Methods, now ''[[The Journal of Philosophy]]'', Part I, 2 January 1908, pp. 5–12. Part II, 16 January 1908, pp. 29–39&lt;/ref&gt; He identified thirteen different philosophical positions that were each labeled pragmatism.

[[Neopragmatism]] as represented by Richard Rorty has been criticized as relativistic both by other neopragmatists such as [[Susan Haack]] (Haack 1997) and by many analytic philosophers (Dennett 1998). Rorty's early analytic work, however, differs notably from his later work which some, including Rorty, consider to be closer to [[literary criticism]] than to philosophy, and which attracts the brunt of criticism from his detractors.

== Unruh radiation and horizon mechanics ==
There is an [[event horizon]]  in the universe where [[light]] (and therefore any information) cannot and will never be able to reach an object, because the cosmic acceleration outpaces the [[speed of light]]: the [[Cosmological horizon#Particle horizon|cosmological comoving horizon]]. If the object accelerates in one direction, a similar event horizon is produced: the [[Rindler coordinates#The Rindler horizon|Rindler horizon]]. Anything beyond these horizons is outside the [[observable universe]], and therefore can't affect the object at the center of the [[Rindler coordinates|Rindler space]].

The Rindler event horizon is effectively the same as the event horizon of a [[black hole]], where [[Vacuum polarization|quantum virtual particle pairs]] are occasionally separated by [[gravity]], resulting in particle emissions known as the [[Hawking radiation]]. For a Rindler horizon produced by an accelerating object, a similar radiation is predicted by [[quantum field theory]]: the [[Unruh effect#Unruh radiation|Unruh radiation]]. Due to the difficulty to measure such tiny quantum background radiation seen only from the [[Frame of reference|reference frame]] of an accelerated object, Unruh radiation has never been proven to be observed for sure, although some evidence may exist.&lt;ref name="Smolyaninov 2008"&gt;{{Cite journal

 |title=Photoluminescence from a gold nanotip in an accelerated reference frame.

 |doi=10.1016/j.physleta.2008.10.061
 |arxiv=cond-mat/0510743
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Quantized inertia posits that Unruh radiation is the origin of inertia: as a particle accelerates, the Rindler information horizon expands in the direction of acceleration, and contracts behind it. Although being different in essence, this is a macroscopic analogy of the [[Casimir effect]]: a non-fitting partial wave would allow an observer to infer what lies beyond the event horizon, so it would not be a horizon anymore. This logical assumption disallows Unruh waves that don't fit behind an accelerating object. As a result, more Unruh radiation pressure (which acts through the volume of the mass, not only on its surface like the electromagnetic [[radiation pressure]]) hits the object coming from the front than from the rear and this imbalance pushes it back against its acceleration, resulting in the effect observed as inertia.&lt;ref name="EPL 2013"&gt;{{Cite journal
 |last1=McCulloch |first1=M. E.
 |date=March 2013
 |title=Inertia from an asymmetric Casimir effect
 |journal=EPL
 |volume=101
 |issue=5
 |pages=59001
 |doi= 10.1209/0295-5075/101/59001
 |arxiv=1302.2775
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is another event horizon much further away: the [[Cosmological horizon#Hubble horizon|Hubble horizon]]. So even in front of an accelerating object, some of the Unruh waves are disallowed, especially the very long Unruh waves that exist if the object has a very low acceleration. Therefore, quantized inertia predicts that such an object with very low acceleration would lose [[Mass#Inertial vs. gravitational mass|inertial mass]] in a new way.&lt;ref name="EPL 2010" /&gt;

This loss of inertia occurs more gradually than the [[Empirical_relationship|empirical]] relation proposed by [[Modified Newtonian dynamics|MOND]]. In quantized inertia, the inertial mass is modified according to the relation:&lt;ref name="MNRAS 2007" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MNRAS 2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EPL 2010" /&gt;&lt;ref name="A&amp;SS 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="A&amp;SS 2017a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="A&amp;SS 2017b" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; m_i \; = \; m_g \left( 1 - \frac{ \beta \, \pi^2 c^2 }{ |a| \, \Theta} \right) \; \approx \; m_g \left( 1 - \frac{ 2 c^2 }{ |a| \, \Theta} \right) &lt;/math&gt;

Using the constant &lt;math&gt;a'&lt;/math&gt;, quantized inertia predicts the empirical [[Tully–Fisher relation]], the rotational velocity of galaxies being:&lt;ref name="A&amp;SS 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="A&amp;SS 2017a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="A&amp;SS 2017b" /&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; v^4 \; = \; \frac{2 \, G \, M \ c^2}{\Theta} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is the [[gravitational constant]] and &lt;math&gt;M&lt;/math&gt; the [[Baryon|baryonic]] mass of the galaxy (the sum of its mass in stars and gas).

This relation is in good agreement with available observational data at various scales, without the need to introduce dark matter. Quantized inertia indeed reduces the inertial mass of outlying stars (whose acceleration &lt;math&gt;a = v^2/r&lt;/math&gt; becomes low enough) and allows them to be bound by the gravitational attraction from visible matter only.&lt;ref name="A&amp;SS 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="A&amp;SS 2017a" /&gt;&lt;ref name="A&amp;SS 2017b" /&gt;

== Comparison with related theories ==

Quantized inertia is an alternative to the Lambda-CDM model. Among the main differences, QI has no [[free parameter]] and explains the [[Accelerating expansion of the universe|cosmic acceleration]] without [[dark energy]],&lt;ref name="EPL 2010" /&gt; and [[galaxy rotation curve]]s as well as residual velocities in [[galaxy cluster]]s without resorting to [[dark matter]].&lt;ref name="A&amp;SS 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="A&amp;SS 2017a" /&gt; As of 2018, two kinds of observations have been shown to be incompatible with dark matter but can be explained by quantized inertia:

* '''Globular clusters''': in 2006, [[European Southern Observatory|ESO]] researchers confirmed [[Mordehai Milgrom]]'s main point, i.e. that the dynamics of stars becomes non-Newtonian when their gravitational acceleration drops below a critical threshold of about &lt;math display="inline"&gt;2 \times 10^{-10} \text{m}/\text{s}^2&lt;/math&gt;, however they also showed that such peculiar behavior does not only occur at the periphery of large galaxies but also in much smaller structures such as [[globular cluster]]s, a phenomenon impossible to explain by dark matter (which has a large and smooth distribution over the whole galaxy).&lt;ref name="Scarpa 2006"&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Wide binaries''': in 2012 and 2014, [[National Autonomous University of Mexico|UNAM]] researchers published results of the study of a particular type of wide [[Binary star|binaries]]. When such couple of stars is separated by more than 7000&amp;nbsp;[[Astronomical unit|AU]], so their gravitational acceleration drops below the threshold of &lt;math display="inline"&gt;2 \times 10^{-10} \text{m}/\text{s}^2&lt;/math&gt;, their behavior also becomes non-Newtonian, i.e. their observed orbital speed becomes so large that the [[Acceleration#Tangential and centripetal acceleration|centripetal acceleration]] should produce [[centrifugal force]]s overcoming their gravitational attraction, so they should separate, which is not the case. The behavior of such a small system remains unexplainable by dark matter.&lt;ref name="Hernandez 2012"&gt;{{cite journal

Quantized inertia is directly related to other theories of [[Alternatives to general relativity|modified gravity]]. [[Modified Newtonian dynamics]] (MOND) for example modifies [[Newton's laws of motion#Newton's second law|Newton's law]] with an adjustable parameter &lt;math display="inline"&gt;a_0&lt;/math&gt; whose value is tuned arbitrarily to fit observed intermediate sized systems such as average galaxies (MOND typically implies different values of the parameter &lt;math&gt;a_0&lt;/math&gt; in the range of &lt;math&gt;1.2 \times 10^{-10}&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;2 \times 10^{-10} \text{m}/\text{s}^2&lt;/math&gt;), an empirical relation that however fails with smaller or bigger systems like [[Dwarf galaxy|dwarf galaxies]] or [[galaxy cluster|galaxy cluster]]s. Unlike MOND, the inertial law of quantized inertia is not a tunable parameter, and better explains the anomalous behavior of globular and galaxy clusters, wide binaries and dwarf galaxies.&lt;ref name="A&amp;SS 2017b" /&gt;

The [[holographic principle]] in [[quantum gravity]] has also been shown to provide a link between quantized inertia and [[entropic gravity]].&lt;ref name="Gine 2012"&gt;{{Cite journal

A '''reducing atmosphere''' is an [[atmosphere|atmospheric]] condition in which [[oxidation]] is prevented by removal of [[oxygen]] and other oxidizing gases or vapours, and which may contain actively [[Reducing agent|reducing gases]] such as [[hydrogen]], [[carbon monoxide]], and gases such as [[hydrogen sulphide]] that would be oxidized by any present oxygen.

== Materials processing ==
In metal processing, a reducing atmosphere is used in [[annealing (metallurgy)|annealing]] ovens for relaxation of metal [[stress (mechanics)|stresses]] without corroding the metal. A non oxidizing gas, usually [[nitrogen]], is used, or for more extreme conditions, hydrogen gas.

A reducing atmosphere is also used to produce specific effects on [[ceramic]] wares being fired. A [[redox|reduction]] atmosphere is produced in a fuel fired kiln by reducing the draft and depriving the kiln of [[oxygen]]. This diminished level of oxygen causes incomplete combustion of the fuel and raises the level of carbon inside the kiln. At high temperatures the carbon will bond with and remove the oxygen in the metal oxides used as colorants in the glazes. This loss of oxygen results in a change in the color of the glazes because it allows the metals in the glaze to be seen in an unoxidized form. A reduction atmosphere can also affect the color of the clay body. If iron is present in the clay body, as it is in most [[stoneware]], then it will be affected by the reduction atmosphere as well.

In most commercial [[Incineration|incinerator]]s, exactly the same conditions are created to encourage the release of carbon bearing fumes. These fumes are then oxidized in reburn tunnels where oxygen is injected progressively. The exothermic oxidation reaction maintains the temperature of the reburn tunnels. This system allows lower temperatures to be employed in the incinerator section, where the solids are volumetrically reduced.

== Planetary atmospheres ==
The same principle applies to planets. Many scientists think the early Earth had a reducing atmosphere, along with Mars and Venus. This would have proven to be a good environment for ''[[Cyanobacteria]]'' to evolve the first [[Photosynthesis|photosynthetic metabolic pathways]] which gradually increased the oxygen portion of the atmosphere, changing it to what is known as an oxidizing atmosphere. With increased levels of oxygen, the evolution of the more efficient aerobic respiration might have been enabled, allowing animal life to evolve and thrive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg14820078.300-structure-of-the-earths-atmosphere.html?full=true|title=Structure of the Earth's atmosphere |accessdate= |author=Gribbin, J. |date=1995-12-09|work= |publisher=New Scientist, 2007 |pages=1 |language= |archiveurl= |archivedate= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though most scientists conceive of the early atmosphere as reducing, a 2011 article in ''Nature'' found that [[cerium]] oxidation in [[zircon]]—which comprises the oldest rocks on Earth at roughly 4.4 billion years of age—was comparable to that of present-day lava.  This observation implies that [[Hadean]] atmospheric oxygen levels were similar to those of today.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v480/n7375/full/nature10655.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The results do not, however, run contrary to existing theories on life’s journey from anaerobic to aerobic organisms. The results quantify the nature of gas molecules containing carbon, hydrogen, and sulphur in the earliest atmosphere, but they shed no light on the much later rise of free oxygen in the air.&lt;ref&gt;https://nai.nasa.gov/articles/2011/12/2/earths-early-atmosphere-an-update/&lt;/ref&gt;

Although a hard vacuum, [[interplanetary space]] is reducing, because [[solar wind]] consists mostly of [[hydrogen]] plasma. The Moon is directly exposed to solar wind, such that sodium is reduced and evaporated to produce the [[sodium tail of the Moon]] (see [[atmosphere of the Moon]]).

'''Rutgers WPF''' is a [[The Netherlands|Dutch]] expert centre on [[human sexual behavior|sexuality]], based in [[Utrecht (city)|Utrecht]].

Rutgers WPFp was established in 1999 as the result of a fusion between Rutgers Stichting (1969) and Nisso (1967). Rutgers WPF consists of two departments: Research and Development, and Implementation. They also have a Youth Sex Offender project and a Youth Incentives programme to promote sexual health. It is the [[International Planned Parenthood Federation]]'s affiliate in the Netherlands.

Ministries, municipalities, care institutions, educational institutes, pressure groups, but also companies make use of their expertise.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2032">The '''strain hardening exponent''' (also called '''strain hardening index'''), noted as ''n'', is a material's constant which is used in calculations for [[Stress–strain curve|stress–strain behavior]] in [[work hardening]]. It occurs in the formula known as Hollomons equation after [[John Herbert Hollomon Jr.]] who originally proposed it&lt;ref&gt; J. H. Hollomon, Tensile deformation, Trans. AIME, vol. 162, (1945), pp. 268-290. &lt;/ref&gt;:

σ = K ε &lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;,&lt;br /&gt;
where σ represents the applied [[Stress (physics)|stress]] on the material,&lt;br /&gt;
ε is the [[Strain (materials science)|strain]],&lt;br /&gt;
and K is the strength coefficient. 

The value of the strain hardening exponent lies between 0 and 1. A value of 0 means that a material is a perfectly [[Plasticity (physics)|plastic]] solid, while a value of 1 represents a 100% [[Elasticity (physics)|elastic]] solid. Most metals have a n value between 0.10 and 0.50.

The '''E and B Experiment''' ('''EBEX''') will measure the [[cosmic microwave background radiation]] of a part of the sky during two sub-orbital [[high-altitude balloon|(high-altitude) balloon]] flights. It is an experiment to make large, high-fidelity images of the CMB polarization anisotropies. By using a telescope which flies at over 42,000 metres high, it is possible to reduce the atmospheric absorption of microwaves to a minimum. This allows massive cost reduction compared to a satellite probe, though only a small part of the sky can be scanned and for shorter duration than a typical satellite mission such as [[WMAP]].

The first flight was an engineering flight over [[North America]] in 2009.&lt;ref name="spie2010"&gt;{{cite conference

==Instrumentation==
EBEX consists of a 1.5 m Dragone-type telescope that provides a resolution of 8 arcminutes in frequency bands centered on 150, 250, and 410&amp;nbsp;GHz.  Polarimetry is achieved with a continuously-rotating achromatic half-wave plate supported by a superconducting [[magnetic bearing]] and a fixed wire grid polarizer.  The wire grid is mounted at 45 degrees to the incoming light beam and transmits one polarization state while reflecting the other.  Each polarization state is subsequently detected by its own focal plane with a 6 degree instantaneous field-of-view on the sky.  Each of the focal planes contains up to 960 [[transition-edge sensor]]s read out with frequency-domain [[SQUID]] multiplexing.

==Temporary disappearance==
The EBEX telescope was reported missing in May, 2012, while in transit from the [[University of Minnesota]] to the NASA
[[Columbia Scientific Balloon Facility]] in [[Palestine, Texas]]. The driver of the truck said that the trailer had been stolen while parked at a motel in [[Dallas]]. Scientists and employees of the trucking company searched the area and found the missing trailer parked at a truck wash near [[Hutchins, Texas]]. The trailer had been opened, but no scientific equipment had been stolen and the telescope was undamaged.&lt;ref name="missing_universetoday"&gt;{{cite news

'''''The Last Heathen: Encounters with Ghosts and Ancestors in Melanesia''''' is a book by [[Charles Montgomery (writer)|Charles Montgomery]], published in Canada by [[Douglas and McIntyre]] in 2004. In 2006 it was published in the United States by [[HarperCollins]] as ''The Shark God''.

''The Last Heathen'' is the autobiographical account of the author in his journey to [[Melanesia]], following in the footsteps of his great-grandfather, [[Henry Montgomery (bishop)|Henry Montgomery]], [[Bishop of Tasmania]], and to study the effect of his great-grandfather's religion on the people. Montgomery traveled to Melanesia expecting to find a volatile mixture of the tribal, pagan religion and Christianity. He found a comfortable hybrid instead, the two religions living in harmony. The book details his journey as well as his discoveries, from an atheistic point of view.

The book won the [[Charles Taylor Prize]] for Literary Non-fiction in 2005. The book has also won the [[Hubert Evans Non-Fiction Prize]].

[[File:Mono_pensador.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Theory of mind in animals is the ability of nonhuman animals to attribute mental states to themselves and others]]
'''Theory of mind in animals''' is an extension to non-human animals of the philosophical and psychological concept of [[Theory of mind|theory of mind (ToM)]], sometimes known as '''mentalisation''' or '''mind-reading'''. It involves an inquiry into whether animals have the ability to attribute [[mental state]]s (such as [[intention]], [[desire (emotion)|desires]], [[role-playing|pretending]], [[knowledge]]) to themselves and others, including recognition that others have mental states that are different from their own.&lt;ref name="Heyes2015"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Heyes, C.|year=2015|title=Animal mindreading: what's the problem?|pmid=25102928| journal=Psychonomic Bulletin &amp; Review|volume=22|issue=2|pages=313–327|doi=10.3758/s13423-014-0704-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Premack1978"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Premack, D.G.  |author2=Woodruff, G. |lastauthoramp=yes |year=1978|title=Does the chimpanzee have a theory of mind?|journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences |volume=1 |issue=4| pages=515–526 |doi=10.1017/S0140525X00076512}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Calarge"/&gt; To investigate this issue experimentally, researchers place animals in situations where their resulting behavior can be interpreted as supporting ToM or not.

The existence of theory of mind in animals is controversial.  On the one hand, one hypothesis proposes that some animals have complex cognitive processes which allow them to attribute mental states to other individuals, sometimes called "mind-reading".  A second, more parsimonious, hypothesis proposes that animals lack these skills and that they depend instead on more simple learning processes such as [[associative learning]];&lt;ref name="Elgier2012"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Elgier, A.M.|author2=Jakovcevic, A.|author3=Mustaca, A.E.|author4= Bentosela, M.|year=2012|title=Pointing following in dogs: are simple or complex cognitive mechanisms involved?|journal=Animal Cognition|volume=15|issue=6|pages=1111–1119|lastauthoramp=yes|doi=10.1007/s10071-012-0534-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; or in other words, they are simply behaviour-reading.

Several studies have been designed specifically to test whether animals possess theory of mind by using interspecific or intraspecific communication.  Several taxa have been tested including primates, birds and canines.  Positive results have been found; however, these are often qualified as showing only low-grade ToM, or rejected as not convincing by other researchers.

==History and development==
[[File:In de hangmat.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|Much of the early work on ToM in animals focused on the understanding chimpanzees have of human knowledge]]
The term "theory of mind" was originally proposed by Premack and Woodruff in 1978.&lt;ref name="Premack1978" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Towner"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Towner, S.|title=Concept of mind in non-human primates|journal=Bioscience Horizons|year=2010|volume=3|issue=1|pages=96–104|doi=10.1093/biohorizons/hzq011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early studies focused almost entirely on studying if chimpanzees could understand the knowledge of humans.  This approach turned out not to be particularly fruitful and 20 years later, Heyes, reviewing all the extant data, observed that there had been "no substantial progress" in the subject area.&lt;ref name="Heyes1998" /&gt;

A 2000 paper&lt;ref name="Hare2000" /&gt; approached the issue differently by examining competitive foraging behaviour between primates of the same species ([[conspecific]]s).  This led to the rather limited conclusion that "chimpanzees know what conspecifics do and do not see".&lt;ref name="Whiten2013"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Whiten, A.|year=2013|title=Humans are not alone in computing how others see the world|journal=Animal Behaviour|volume=86|issue=2|pages=213–221|doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2013.04.021}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Next, brain activity in higher primates was studied and as a result, a 2003 study of the human brain suggested that the a functioning ToM system activated three major nodes, the medial prefrontal, superior temporal sulcus, and inferior frontal: the medial prefrontal node handles the mental state of the self, that the superior temporal sulcus detects the behaviour of other animals and analyzes the goals and outcomes of this behaviour, and the inferior frontal region maintains representations of actions and goals.&lt;ref name="Calarge"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Calarge, C.|author2=Andreasen, N.C.|author3=O'Leary, D.S.|year=2003|title=Visualizing how one brain understands another: a PET study of theory of mind|pmid=14594741|journal=American Journal of Psychiatry|volume=160|issue=11|pages=1954–1964|lastauthoramp=yes|doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.160.11.1954}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Penn and Povinelli wrote "there is still little consensus on whether or not nonhuman animals understand anything about unobservable mental states or even what it would mean for a non-verbal animal to understand the concept of a 'mental state'." They went on further to suggest that ToM was "''any'' cognitive system, whether theory-like or not, that predicts or explains the behaviour of another agent by postulating that unobservable inner states particular to the cognitive perspective of that agent causally modulate that agent's behaviour".&lt;ref name="Penn2007"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Penn, D.C.  |author2=Povinelli, D.J. |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2007|title=On the lack of evidence that non-human animals possess anything remotely resembling a 'theory of mind'|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society|volume=362|issue=1480 |pages=731–744|url=http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/royptb/362/1480/731.full.pdf|doi=10.1098/rstb.2006.2023|pmid=17264056|pmc=2346530}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, an article in ''[[Scientific American]]'' acknowledged that dogs are considerably better at using social direction cues (e.g. pointing by humans) than are chimpanzees.&lt;ref name="Jabr"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogs.scientificamerican.com/observations/clever-critters-bonobos-that-share-brainy-bugs-and-social-dogs/|publisher=Scientific American|title=Clever critters: Bonobos that share, brainy bugs and social dogs|author=Jabr, F.|date=June 8, 2010|accessdate=April 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the same year, Towner wrote, "the issue may have evolved beyond whether or not there is theory of mind in non-human primates to a more sophisticated appreciation that the concept of mind has many facets and some of these may exist in non-human primates while others may not."&lt;ref name="Towner" /&gt; Horowitz, working with dogs, agreed with this and suggested that her recent results and previous findings called for the introduction of an intermediate stage of ability, a rudimentary theory of mind, to describe animals' performance.&lt;ref name="Horowitz2011"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Horowitz, A.|year=2011|title=Theory of mind in dogs? Examining method and concept|journal=Learning &amp; Behavior|volume=39|issue=4|pages=314–317|doi=10.3758/s13420-011-0041-7|pmid=21789555|url=http://www.cogs.indiana.edu/spackled/2011readings/Horowitz.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Whiten reviewed the literature and concluded that regarding the question "Are chimpanzees truly mentalists, like we are?", he stated he could not offer an affirmative or negative answer.&lt;ref name="Whiten2013" /&gt;  A similarly equivocal view was stated in 2014 by Brauer, who suggested that many previous experiments on ToM could be explained by the animals possessing other abilities.  They went on further to make reference to several authors who suggest it is pointless to ask a "yes or no" question, rather, it makes more sense to ask which psychological states animals understand and to what extent.&lt;ref name="Brauer" /&gt;  At the same time, it was suggested that a "minimal theory of mind" may be "what enables those with limited cognitive resources or little conceptual sophistication, such as infants, chimpanzees, scrub-jays and human adults under load, to track others' perceptions, knowledge states and beliefs."&lt;ref name="Butterfill"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Butterfill, S.A.  |author2=Apperly, I.A. |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2013|title=How to construct a minimal theory of mind|journal=Mind &amp; Language|volume=28|issue=5|pages=606–637|url=http://www.ianapperly.eclipse.co.uk/Butterfill%20Apperly%20Min%20ToM.pdf|doi=10.1111/mila.12036}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, [[Cecilia Heyes]], Professor of Psychology at the University of Oxford, wrote about research on ToM, "Since that time [2000], many enthusiasts have become sceptics, empirical methods have become more limited, and it is no longer clear what research on animal mindreading is trying to find" and "However, after some 35 years of research on mindreading in animals, there is still nothing resembling a consensus about whether ''any'' animal can ascribe ''any'' mental state" (Heyes' emphasis).  Heyes further suggested that "In combination with the use of inanimate control stimuli, species that are unlikely to be capable of mindreading, and the 'goggles method' [see below], these approaches could restore both vigour and rigour to research on animal mindreading."&lt;ref name="Heyes2015" /&gt;

==Methods==
Specific categories of behaviour are sometimes used as evidence of animal ToM, including imitation, self-recognition, social relationships, deception, role-taking (empathy), perspective-taking, teaching and co-operation,&lt;ref name="Towner" /&gt; however, this approach has been criticised.&lt;ref name="Heyes1998"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Heyes, C.M.|year=1998|title=Theory of mind in nonhuman primates|journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences|volume=21|issue=1|pages=101–114|pmid=10097012|url=http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/117063/1/download.14pdf.pdf|doi=10.1017/s0140525x98000703}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some researchers focus on animals' understanding of intention, gaze, perspective, or knowledge, i.e. what another being has seen.  Several experimental methods have been developed which are widely used or suggested as appropriate tests for nonhuman animals possessing ToM. Some studies look at communication between individuals of the same species ([[Biological specificity|intraspecific]]) whereas others investigate behaviour between individuals of different species ([[Biological specificity|interspecific]]).

===Knower-Guesser===
The Knower-Guesser method has been used in many studies relating to animal ToM.  Animals are tested in a two-stage procedure. At the beginning of each trial in the first discrimination training stage, an animal is in a room with two humans. One human, designated the "Guesser," leaves the room, and the other, the "Knower," baits one of several containers. The containers are screened so that the animal can see who does the baiting, but not where the food has been placed. After baiting, the Guesser returns to the room, the screen is removed, and each human points directly at a container. The Knower points at the baited container, and the Guesser at one of the other three, chosen at random. The animal is allowed to search one container and to keep the food if it is found.&lt;ref name="Heyes1998" /&gt;

===Competitive feeding paradigm===
The competitive feeding paradigm approach is considered by some as evidence that animals have some understanding of the relationship between "seeing" and "knowing".&lt;ref name="Heyes2015" /&gt;

At the beginning of each trial in the paradigm, a subordinate animal (the individual thought to be doing the mind-reading) and a dominant animal are kept on opposite sides of a test arena which contains two visual barriers. In all trials, a researcher enters the enclosure and places food on the subordinate's side of one of the visual barriers (one baiting event), and in some trials the researcher re-enters the enclosure several seconds later and moves the food to the subordinate's side of the other visual barrier (second baiting event).  The door to the subordinate's cage is open during any baiting by the researcher. The conditions vary according to whether the dominant's door is open or closed during the baiting events, and therefore whether the subordinate individual can see the dominant. After baiting, both of the animals are released into the test arena, with the subordinate being released several seconds before the dominant. If the animals possess ToM, it is expected that subordinates are more likely to gain the food, and more likely to approach the food under several circumstances: (1) When the dominant's door is closed during trials with a single baiting event; (2) when the dominant's door is open during a first baiting event but closed during a second; (3) in single baiting event trials with the dominant's door open, subordinates are more likely to get the food when they compete at the end of the trial with a dominant individual who did not see the baiting.

===Goggles Method===
In one suggested protocol, chimpanzees are given first-hand experience of wearing two mirrored visors. One of the visors is transparent whereas the other is not. The visors themselves are of markedly different colours or shapes. During the subsequent test session, the chimpanzees are given the opportunity to use their species-typical begging behaviour to request food from one of the two humans, one wearing the transparent visor and the other wearing the opaque. If chimpanzees possess ToM, it would be expected they would beg more often from the human wearing the transparent visor.

===False Belief Test===
A method used to test ToM in human children has been adapted for testing non-human animals. The basis of the test is to track the gaze of the animal.  One human hides an object in view of a second human who then leaves the room.  The object is then removed.  The second human returns whereupon they will mistakenly look for the object where they last saw it.  If the animal stares first and longest at the location where the human last saw the object, this suggests they expect him to believe it is still hidden in that place.&lt;ref name="Smith2016"&gt;{{cite web|title=Apes understand that some things are all in your head|date=October 16, 2016|accessdate=January 3, 2017|url=https://today.duke.edu/2016/10/falsebeliefs|publisher=DukeToday|author=Smith, R.A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In nonhuman primates==

Many ToM studies have used nonhuman primates (NHPs).  One study that examined the understanding of intention in orangutans (''Pongo pygmaeus''), chimpanzees (''Pan troglodytes'') and children showed that all three species understood the difference between accidental and intentional acts.&lt;ref name="Call"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Call, J.  |author2=Tomasello, M.  |lastauthoramp=yes | year = 1998 | title = Distinguishing intentional from accidental actions in orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus), chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes), and human children (Homo sapiens) | url = | journal = Journal of Comparative Psychology | volume = 112 | issue = 2| pages = 192–206 | doi = 10.1037/0735-7036.112.2.192 | pmid = 9642787 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chimpanzees===
There is controversy over the interpretation of evidence purporting to show ToM in chimpanzees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S1364-6613(03)00053-6 |title=Chimpanzee minds: Suspiciously human? |year=2003 |author1=Povinelli, D.J.  |author2=Vonk, J. |lastauthoramp=yes |journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=157–160 |pmid=12691763}}&lt;/ref&gt;

William Field and [[Sue Savage-Rumbaugh]] have no doubt that bonobos have evolved ToM and cite their communications with a captive [[bonobo]] (''Pan paniscus''), [[Kanzi]], as evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Hamilton, J.|title=A voluble visit with two talking apes|url=https://www.npr.org/2006/07/08/5503685/a-voluble-visit-with-two-talking-apes|accessdate= March 21, 2012|newspaper=NPR|date=July 8, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, empirical studies show that chimpanzees are unable to follow a human's gaze,&lt;ref name="Call1998"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Call, J.|author2=Hare, B. |author3=Tomasello, M.|year=1998|title=Chimpanzee gaze following in an object choice task|journal=Animal Cognition|volume=1|issue=2|pages=89–99|lastauthoramp=yes|doi=10.1007/s100710050013|pmid=24399273}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are unable to use other human-eye information.&lt;ref name="Povinelli1996"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Povinelli, D.  |author2=Eddy, T. |lastauthoramp=yes |year=1996|title=What young chimpanzees know about seeing|journal=Monographs of the Society for Research in Child Development|volume=61|issue=3|pages=247|pmid=8795292|doi=10.2307/1166159}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Povinelli, D.J.|author2= Nelson, K.E. |author3=Boysen, S.T.|year=1990|title=Inferences about guessing and knowing by chimpanzees (''Pan troglodytes'') | url = | journal = Journal of Comparative Psychology | volume = 104 | issue = 3| pages = 203–210 | doi = 10.1037/0735-7036.104.3.203 | pmid = 2225758 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Attempts to use the "Goggles Method" (see above) on highly human-[[Enculturation|enculturated]] chimpanzees failed to demonstrate they possess ToM.&lt;ref name="Penn2007" /&gt;

In contrast, chimpanzees use the gaze of other chimpanzees to gain information about whether food is accessible.&lt;ref name="Hare2000"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hare, B.|author2= Call, J.|author3=Agnetta, B. |author4=Tomasello, M.|year=2000|title=Chimpanzees know what conspecifics do and do not see|journal=Animal Behaviour|volume=59|issue=4|pages=771–785|pmid=10792932|doi=10.1006/anbe.1999.1377|url=https://evolutionaryanthropology.duke.edu/sites/evolutionaryanthropology.duke.edu/files/site-images/Hare%20et%20al_%202000_%20Chimpanzees%20know%20what%20conspecifics%20do%20and%20do%20not%20see.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Subordinate chimpanzees are able to use the knowledge state of dominant chimpanzees to determine which container has hidden food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author1=Hare, B.|author2= Call, J.|author3=Tomasello, M.| year = 2001 | title = Do chimpanzees know what conspecifics know and do not know? | url = | journal = Animal Behaviour | volume = 61 | issue = 1| pages = 139–151 | doi = 10.1006/anbe.2000.1518 | pmid=11170704|lastauthoramp=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If chimpanzees can see two opaque boards on a table and are expecting to find food, they do not choose a board lying flat because if food was under there, it would not be lying flat.  Rather, they choose a slanted board, presumably inferring that food underneath is causing the slant. Chimpanzees appear able to know that other chimpanzees in the same situation make a similar inference. In a foraging game, when their competitor had chosen before them, chimpanzees avoided the slanted board on the assumption that the competitor had already chosen it.&lt;ref name="Schmelz2011"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Schmelz, M.|author2=Call, J.|author3=Tomasello, M.|title=Chimpanzees know that others make inferences|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, USA|volume=108|issue=7|pages=3077–3079|year=2011|lastauthoramp=yes|doi=10.1073/pnas.1000469108|pmc=3041140}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a similar study, chimps were provided with a preference box with two compartments, one containing a picture of food, the other containing a picture of nothing (the pictures had no causal relation to the contents). In a foraging competition game, chimpanzees avoided the chamber with the picture of food when their competitor had chosen one of the chambers before them.  The authors suggested this was presumably on the assumption that the competitor shared their own preference for it and had already chosen it.&lt;ref name="Schmelz2013"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Schmelz, M.|author2=Call, J. |author3=Tomasello, M.|title=Chimpanzees predict that a competitor's preference will match their own|journal=Biology Letters|volume=9|issue=1|pages=20120829|year=2013|doi=10.1098/rsbl.2012.0829|url=http://rsbl.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/9/1/20120829|pmid=23193044|lastauthoramp=yes|pmc=3565493}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One study tested another sensory mode of ToM.  In a food competition, a human sat inside a booth with one piece of food to their left and one to their right.  The food could be withdrawn from the competing chimpanzee's reach when necessary. In the first experiment, the chimpanzee could approach either side of the booth unseen by the human, but then had to reach through either a transparent or opaque tube to get the food. In a second experiment, both were transparent and the human was looking away, but one of the tubes made a loud rattle when it was opened. Chimpanzees reached through the opaque tube in the first experiment and the silent tube in the second.  The chimpanzees successfully concealed their food-stealing from their human competitor in both cases.&lt;ref name="Melis2006"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Melis, A.P.|author2=Call, J.|author3=Tomasello, M.|year=2006|title=Chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) conceal visual and auditory information from others|journal=Journal of Comparative Psychology|volume=120|issue=2|pages=154–62|pmid=16719594|url=http://www.eva.mpg.de/psycho/pdf/Publications_2006_PDF/Chimpanzees_Conceal_Visual_06.pdf|doi= 10.1037/0735-7036.120.2.154}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chimpanzees have passed the False Belief Test (see above) involving anticipating the gaze of humans when objects have been removed.&lt;ref name="Krupenye"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Krupenye, C., Kano, F., Hirata, S., Call, J. and Tomasello, M.|year=2016|title=Great apes anticipate that other individuals will act according to false beliefs|journal=Science|volume=354|issue=6308|pages=110–114|doi=10.1126/science.aaf8110|pmid=27846501}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other primates===
[[File:Rhesus Macaque (Macaca mulatta) in Kinnarsani WS, AP W IMG 5792.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Rhesus macaques selectively steal grapes from humans who are incapable of seeing the grape compared to humans who can see the grape.]]
In one approach testing monkeys, [[rhesus macaque]]s (''Macaca mulatta'') are able to "steal" a contested [[grape]] from one of two human competitors. In six experiments, the macaques selectively stole the grape from a human who was incapable of seeing the grape, rather than from the human who was visually aware. The authors suggest that rhesus macaques possess an essential component of ToM: the ability to deduce what others perceive on the basis of where they are looking.&lt;ref name="Flombaum"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Flombaum, J.I.  |author2=Santos, L.R. |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2005|title=Rhesus monkeys attribute perceptions to others|journal=Current Biology|volume=15|issue=5 |pages=447–452|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2004.12.076}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, free ranging rhesus macaques preferentially choose to steal food items from locations where they can be less easily observed by humans, or where they will make less noise.&lt;ref name="Whiten2013" /&gt;

A [[comparative psychology]] approach tested six species of captive NHPs (three species of great apes: orangutans, gorillas, chimpanzees, and three species of old-world monkeys: [[lion-tailed macaque]]s (''Macaca silenus''), rhesus macaques and [[collared mangabey]]s (''Cercocebus torquatus'')) in a "hide and seek" game in which the NHPs played against a human opponent. In each trial, the NHP has to infer where food has been hidden (either in their right or left hand) by the human opponent. In general, the NHPs failed the test (whereas humans did not), but surprisingly, performances between the NHP species did not reveal any inter-species differences.  The authors also reported that at least one individual of each of the species showed (weak) evidence of ToM.&lt;ref name="San‑Galli"&gt;{{cite journal|author=San‑Galli, A.|author2=Devaine, M.|author3=Trapanese, C.|author4=Masi, S.|author5=Bouret, S. |author6= Daunizeau, J.|year=2015|title=Playing hide and seek with primates: A comparative study of Theory of Mind|journal=Revue de Primatologie|volume=6|issue=6|pages=4–7|lastauthoramp=yes|doi= 10.4000/primatologie.2182}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a multi-species study, it was shown that chimpanzees, bonobos and orangutans passed the False Belief Test (see above).&lt;ref name="Krupenye" /&gt;

In 2009, a summary of the ToM research, particularly emphasising an extensive comparison of humans, chimpanzees and orang-utans,&lt;ref name="Herrmann2007"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Herrmann, E.|author2=Call, J.|author3=Hernández-Lloreda, M.V.|author4=Hare, B.|author5=Tomasello, M.|year=2007|title=Humans have evolved specialized skills of social cognition: The cultural intelligence hypothesis|journal=Science|volume=317|issue=5843|pages=1360–1366|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/317/5843/1360|lastauthoramp=yes|doi=10.1126/science.1146282|pmid=17823346}}&lt;/ref&gt; concluded that [[great ape]]s do not exhibit understanding of human referential intentions expressed in communicative gestures, such as pointing.&lt;ref name="Topal" /&gt;

==In birds==

===Parrots===
[[Grey parrot]]s (''Psittacus erithacus'') have demonstrated high levels of intelligence.  [[Irene Pepperberg]] did experiments with these and her most accomplished parrot, [[Alex (parrot)|Alex]], demonstrated behaviour which seemed to manipulate the trainer, possibly indicating theory of mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |page=114 |chapter=Theory of Mind |title=The Oxford Handbook of Language Evolution |author=Irene Pepperberg |editor1=Maggie Tallerman |editor2=Kathleen R.

===Ravens===
[[File:Corvus corax along road detail.JPG|right|thumb|250px|Ravens adjust their caching behaviour according to whether they have been watched and who was watching them.]]
[[Raven]]s are members of the [[corvidae]] family and are widely regarded as having complex cognitive abilities.&lt;ref name="Emery2004"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Emery, N.J.  |author2=Clayton, N.S. |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2004|title=The mentality of crows: convergent evolution of intelligence in corvids and apes|journal=Science|volume=306|issue=5703|pages=1903–1907|doi=10.1126/science.1098410|pmid=15591194|url=http://academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu/biology/jbasil/documents/CrowApeCognition.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Food-storing ravens [[Hoarding (animal behavior)|cache]] (hoard) their food and pilfer (steal) from other ravens' caches.  They protect their caches from being pilfered by conspecifics using aggression, dominance and re-caching.  Potential pilferers rarely approach caches until the storing birds have left the cache vicinity.  When storers are experimentally prevented from leaving the vicinity of the cache, pilferers first search at places other than the cache sites. When ravens (''Corvus corax'') witness a conspecific making caches, to pilfer those caches they (1) delay approaching the cache only when in the presence of the storer, and (2) quickly engage in searching away from the caches when together with dominant storers.  These behaviours raise the possibility that ravens are capable of withholding their intentions, and also providing false information to avoid provoking the storer's aggression to protect its cache.  Ravens adjust their pilfering behaviour according to when the storers are likely to defend the caches.  This supports the suggestion that they are deceptively manipulating the other's behaviour.&lt;ref name="Bugnyar2006"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Bugnyar, T.  |author2=Heinrich, B. |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2006|title=Pilfering ravens, Corvus corax, adjust their behaviour to social context and identity of competitors|journal=Animal Cognition|volume=9|issue=4|pages=369–376|doi=10.1007/s10071-006-0035-6|pmid=16909235}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other studies indicate that ravens recall whom was watching them during caching, but also know the effects of visual barriers on what competitors can and can not see, and how this affects their pilfering.&lt;ref name="Bugnyar2005"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Bugnyar, T.  |author2=Heinrich, B. |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2005|title=Ravens, Corvus corax, differentiate between knowledgeable and ignorant competitors|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences|volume=272|issue=1573|pages=1641–1646|pmc=1559847|pmid=16087417|doi=10.1098/rspb.2005.3144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ravens have been tested for their understanding of "seeing" as a mental state in other ravens.  It appears they take into account the visual access of other ravens, even when they cannot see the other raven.&lt;ref name="MacDonald"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.hngn.com/articles/175896/20160203/theory-mind-ravens-understand-others-minds-study.htm|title=Theory of mind: Ravens understand that others have minds, study says|author=MacDonald, T.|date=February 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one study, ravens were tested in two rooms separated by a wooden wall. The wall had two functional windows that could be closed with covers; each cover had a peephole drilled into it.  In the next familiarization step, the ravens are trained to use a peephole to observe and pilfer human-made caches in the adjacent room. Under test conditions, there was no other raven present in the adjacent room, however, a hidden loudspeaker played a series of sounds recorded from a competitor raven.  The storing raven generalized from their own experience when using the peephole to pilfer the human-made caches and predicted that the audible (raven) competitors could potentially see their caches through the peep-hole and took appropriate action, i.e. the storing ravens finished their caches more quickly and they returned to improve their caches less often.  The researchers pointed out that this represented "seeing" in a way that cannot be reduced to the tracking of gaze cues – a criticism leveled at many other studies of ToM.&lt;ref name="Bugnyar2016"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Bugnyar, T.|author2=Reber, S.A.|author3=Buckner, C.|year=2016|title=Ravens attribute visual access to unseen competitors|journal=Nature Communications|volume=7|doi=10.1038/ncomms10506|url=http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2016/160202/ncomms10506/full/ncomms10506.html|lastauthoramp=yes|pages=10506|pmid=26835849|pmc=4740864}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The researchers further suggested that their findings could be considered in terms of the "minimal" (as opposed to "full-blown") ToM recently suggested.&lt;ref name="Butterfill" /&gt;

Using the Knower-Guesser approach, ravens observing a human hiding food are capable of predicting the behaviour of bystander ravens that had been visible at both, none or just one of two baiting events.  The visual field of the competitors was manipulated independently of the view of the test-raven.  The findings indicate that ravens not only remember whom they have seen at caching but they also take into account that the other raven's view was blocked.&lt;ref name="Bugnyar2010"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bugnyar, T.|year=2010|title=Knower–guesser differentiation in ravens: others' viewpoints matter|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B: Biological Sciences|pages=rspb20101514|doi=10.1098/rspb.2010.1514|volume=278|issue=1705|pmc=3025684}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scrub jays===
[[File:Aphelocoma californica in Seattle cropped.jpg|thumb|250px|Western scrub jays may show evidence of possessing theory of mind]]
[[Scrub jay]]s are also corvids.  [[Western scrub jay]]s (''Aphelocoma californica'') both cache food and pilfer other scrub jays' caches.  They use a range of tactics to minimise the possibility that their own caches will be pilfered. One of these tactics is to remember which individual scrub jay watched them during particular caching events and adjust their re-caching behaviour accordingly.&lt;ref name="Dally"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Dally, J.M.|author2=Emery, N.J. |author3=Clayton, N.S.|year=2006|title=Food-caching western scrub-jays keep track of who was watching when|journal=Science|volume=312|issue=5780|pages=1662–1665|pmid=16709747|doi=10.1126/science.1126539|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/312/5780/1662}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One study with particularly interesting results found that only scrub jays which had themselves pilfered would re-cache when they had been observed making the initial cache.&lt;ref name="Emery2001"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Emery, N.

In a computer modeling study using "virtual birds", it was suggested that re-caching is not motivated by a deliberate effort to protect specific caches from pilfering, but by a general motivation to simply cache more. This motivation is brought on by stress, which is affected by the presence and dominance of onlookers, and by unsuccessful recovery attempts.&lt;ref name="Vaart"&gt;{{cite journal|author=van der Vaart E.|author2=Verbrugge R. |author3=Hemelrijk, C.K.|year=2012|title=Corvid re-caching without 'Theory of Mind': A model|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=7|issue=3|pages=e32904|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0032904|lastauthoramp=yes|pmid=22396799|pmc=3291480}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In dogs==
[[File:Duitse staande korthaar 10-10-2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Dogs can use the pointing behaviour of humans to determine the location of food.]]
Domestic [[dog]]s (''Canis familiaris'') show an impressive ability to use the behaviour of humans to find food and toys using behaviours such as pointing and gazing.  The performance of dogs in these studies is superior to that of NHPs,&lt;ref name="Maginnity"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Maginnity, M.E.  |author2=Grace, R.C. |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2014|title=Visual perspective taking by dogs (Canis familiaris) in a Guesser–Knower task: evidence for a canine theory of mind?|journal=Animal Cognition|volume=17|issue=6|pages=1375–1392 |doi=10.1007/s10071-014-0773-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, some have stated categorically that dogs do not possess a human-like ToM.&lt;ref name="Brauer"&gt;{{cite book|author=Bräuer, J.|year=2014|chapter=Chapter 10 – What dogs understand about humans|title=The Social Dog: Behaviour and Cognition|editor=Kaminski, J. |editor2=Marshall-Pescini, S.|pages=295–317|publisher=Academic Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Guesser-Knower approach has been used with ToM studies in dogs.  In one study, each of two toys was placed on the dog's side of two barriers, one opaque and one transparent. In experimental conditions, a human sat on the opposite side of the barriers, such that they could see only the toy behind the transparent barrier. The human then told the dog to 'Fetch' without indicating either toy in any way. In a control, the human sat on the opposite side but with their back turned so that they could see neither toy.  In a second control, the human sat on the same side as the dog such that they could see both toys. When the toys were differentiable, dogs approached the toy behind the transparent barrier in experimental as compared to "back-turned" and "same-side" condition. Dogs did not differentiate between the two control conditions. The authors suggested that, even in the absence of overt behavioural cues, dogs are sensitive to others' visual access, even if that differs from their own.&lt;ref name="Kaminski2009"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Kaminski, J.|author2=Bräuer, J.|author3=Call, J.|author4=Tomasello, M.|year=2009|title=Domestic dogs are sensitive to a human's perspective|journal=Behaviour|volume=146|issue=7|pages=979–998|lastauthoramp=yes|doi=10.1163/156853908X395530|url=http://www.eva.mpg.de/psycho/pdf/dog_cognition/Kaminski_et_al_2009a_dogs_sensitive_humans_perspective.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, dogs preferentially use the behaviour of the human Knower to indicate the location of food.  This is unrelated to the sex or age of the dog.  In another study, 14 of 15 dogs preferred the location indicated by the Knower on the first trial, whereas chimpanzees require approximately 100 trials to reliably exhibit the preference.&lt;ref name="Maginnity" /&gt;

Human infants (10 months old) continue to search for hidden objects at their initial hiding place, even after observing them being hidden at another location.  This perseverance of searching errors is at least partly contributed to by behavioural cues from the experimenter. Domestic dogs also commit more search errors in communicative trials than in non-communicative or non-social hiding trials. However, human-encultured [[Wolf|wolves]] (''Canis lupus'') do not show this context-dependent perseverance in searching. This common sensitivity to human communication behaviour may arise from [[convergent evolution]].&lt;ref name="Topal"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Topál, J.|author2=Gergely, G.|author3=Erdőhegyi, A.|author4=Csibra, G.|author5=Miklósi, A.|title=Differential sensitivity to human communication in dogs, wolves, and human infants|journal=Science|volume=325|issue=5945|year=2009|pages=1269–1272|lastauthoramp=yes|doi=10.1126/science.1176960}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dogs which have been forbidden to take food are more likely to steal the food if a human observer has their back turned or eyes closed than when the human is looking at them. Dogs are also more likely to beg for food from an observer whose eyes are visible compared to an observer whose eyes are covered by a blindfold.&lt;ref name="Maginnity" /&gt;

In a study of the way that dogs interact, play signals were sent almost exclusively to forward-facing partners.  In contrast, attention-getting behaviors were used most often when the other dog was facing away, and before signaling an interest to play. Furthermore, the type of attention-getting behaviour matched the inattentiveness of the playmate.  Stronger attention-getting behaviours were used when a playmate was looking away or distracted, less forceful ones when the partner was facing forward or laterally,&lt;ref name="Horowitz"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10071-008-0175-y |title=Attention to attention in domestic dog (Canis familiaris) dyadic play |year=2008 |author=Horowitz, A.|journal=Animal Cognition |volume=12 |pages=107–18 |pmid=18679727 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In pigs==
An experiment at the [[University of Bristol]] found that one out of ten pigs was possibly able to understand what other pigs can see. That pig observed another pig which had view of a maze in which food was being hidden, and trailed that pig through the maze to the food. The other pigs involved in the experiment did not.&lt;ref name="Mosaic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mosaicscience.com/extra/smartest-animal-youve-never-heard|title=The smartest animal you've never heard of|date=February 10, 2015|accessdate=April 18, 2016|author=Aldhous, P.|publisher=Wellcome Trust}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Held"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Held, S.|author2=Mendl, M.|author3=Devereux, C.|author4=Byrne, R.W.|title=Behaviour of domestic pigs in a visual perspective taking task|journal=Behaviour|volume=138|issue=11|year=2001|pages=1337–1354|doi=10.1163/156853901317367627}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In goats==
A 2006 study found that goats exhibited intricate social behaviours indicative of high-level cognitive processes, particularly in competitive situations. The study included an experiment in which a subordinate animal was allowed to choose between food that a dominant animal could also see and food that it could not; those who were subject to aggressive behaviour selected the food that the dominant animal could not see, suggesting that they are able to perceive a threat based on being within the dominant animal's view &amp;ndash; in other words, visual perspective taking.&lt;ref name="Kaminski2006"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Kaminski, J.|author2=Call, J.|author3=Tomasello, M.|year=2006|title=Goats' behaviour in a competitive food paradigm: Evidence for perspective taking?|journal=Behaviour|volume=143|issue=11|pages=1341–1356|doi=10.1163/156853906778987542|url=http://www.eva.mpg.de/documents/Brill/Kaminski_Goats_Behaviour_2006_1555089.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Torque density''' is a measure of the torque-carrying capability of a mechanical component. It is the ratio of torque capability to volume and is expressed in units of torque per volume.  Torque density is a system [[property]] since it depends on the design of each element of the component being examined and their interconnection.  

Torque density is useful during the [[concept]] evaluation stage of mechanical [[design]]s, especially in [[power train]] design problems. Typically, it will be one of many factors used to assign potential success measures to each concept. For example, in the upgrade of a drive train for a set of rolls in a [[rolling mill]], space is often dictated by the configuration of current components.  There may be several types of devices that can perform the function of an existing component that must be replaced. The relative torque densities of the devices may be an important determinant for which design is ultimately selected, although it will often compete with other factors such as cost, ease of maintenance, time to install, operating costs and potential failure modes.

==Units==
In [[SI|SI units]], torque density is expressed in [[joule]]s per [[cubic metre]] or equivalently [[newton (unit)|newton]]-[[metre]]s per [[cubic metre]] (though dimensionally equivalent to the [[pascal (unit)|pascal]], that is usually not used for this purpose). Small amounts can be expressed in newton-[[millimetre]]s per cubic millimetre. 

In [[U.S. customary units]], torque density is expressed in [[foot-pound force|foot-pounds force]] per cubic foot, or [[inch]]-pounds force per cubic inch or [[pound-force|ounce-force]] inches per cubic inch.

'''Toxic units (TU)''' are used in the field of toxicology to quantify the interactions of [[toxicant]]s in binary mixtures of chemicals. A toxic unit for a given compound is based on the concentration at which there is a 50% effect (ex. [[EC50]]) for a certain biological endpoint. One toxic unit is equal to the EC50 for a given endpoint for a specific biological effect over a given amount of time. Toxic units allow for the comparison of the individual toxicities of a binary mixture to the combined toxicity. This allows researchers to categorize mixtures as additive, synergistic or antagonistic.  Synergism and antagonism are defined by mixtures that are more or less toxic than predicted by the sum of their toxic units.

[[Contamination|Contaminants]] are frequently present as mixtures in the environment. Regulatory decisions are based on mixture toxicity models that assume additivity, which can result in under or overestimation of toxic effects. Refining our understanding of mixture interactions can lead to better informed environmental management and decision making. In addition, exploring mixture interactions can elucidate the mechanisms of action for specific toxicants which, in many cases, are poorly understood.

== Methods ==
Application of toxic units requires toxicity data for the individual components of the mixture as well as specialized mixture toxicity data. Evaluating the response of each individual chemical allows researchers to generate a new dosing metric, toxic units, which is standardized to the toxicity of each chemical. Since the toxicity of two compounds may vary widely, 1 toxic unit of two different compounds could correspond to two very different concentrations on a per mass basis. In addition to the toxicity of the individual components, use of toxic units requires a 2x2 factorial design concentration series where the response is measured to an increase of each contaminant with the other contaminant held constant. This elaborate concentration series allows researchers to describe how the mixture components interact with each other and predict effects at untested combinations components with nonlinear regression models.

=== Point estimates ===
[[File:Concentration-response curve.jpg|thumb|Example of concentration-response model used to calculate EC50. Toxciant concentration is on the X-axis and biological response is on the Y-axis.]]
[[Point estimation]] is a technique to predict population parameters based on available sample data and can be used to relate the mass based concentration to a toxicity based metric. Point estimates in toxicology are frequently response endpoints on a [[Dose–response relationship|dose response curve]]. These point estimates predict at what concentration one would expect to see a given biological endpoint like 50% mortality ([[LC50]]). Any toxicological endpoint (growth inhibition, reproduction, behavior etc.) can be used as the toxicity metric to convert from mass based concentration to toxic units.

Point estimates are generated by fitting a [[nonlinear regression]] model to toxicity data and using that model to predict the concentration of chemical required to elicit a known response of the biological endpoint.

=== Equation and calculations ===
One Toxic unit can be defined by the researcher as the concentration of a given chemical required to cause a given toxicological endpoint ([[LC50]], [[EC50]], [[IC50]]).

ex. 1TU=LC50 or 1TU=IC50 for inhibition of growth

Since the mass or molar based concentrations of different chemicals required to cause a given endpoint like an LC50 may vary widely, the concentration that corresponds to 1TU is specific to each individual chemical tested.

=== Isobolograms ===

Isobolograms are one way to present the results of binary mixture toxicity testing based in toxic units.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Warne MSJ. 2003. A Review of the Ecotoxicity of Mixtures, Approaches to and Recommendations for, their Management. Proceedings of the Fifth National Workshop on the Assessment of Site Contamination. EPHC. pp.256&lt;/ref&gt; The strength of this method is it's simplicity and ease of use. First a line of additivity is plotted that corresponds to all the combinations of the two chemicals that would result in one toxic unit. Next the experimental results from binary mixture tests are plotted on the isobologram. The results from the mixture test are point estimates from the mixture dose response curves that correspond to the single chemical tests. When these mixture point estimates are plotted on the isobologram, the region that they fall into (based on the concentrations of the two chemicals required to cause that given endpoint) demonstrates whether the mixture interactions are [[Interaction#Biochemistry|additive]], [[Synergy#Drug synergy|synergistic]] or [[Antagonism (chemistry)|antagonistic]].

===Response surfaces===
[[File:F(x,y)=−((cosx)^2 + (cosy)^2)^2.PNG|thumb|Three dimensional graph depicting the function F(x,y) where x and y could be the concentration of the individual components in toxic units and the height of the graph depicts the toxicological response.]]Response surfaces are a more advanced and complex way to visualize the same information presented in an isobologram. A response surface is a three dimensional graph with concentrations of individual components in toxic units on the x and y axis and the response variable on the z axis. This three dimensional representation of the organisms response to the two chemical stressors can be used to predict the toxicity of any combination of the components based on the nonlinear regression models that form the response surface.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Antagonistic, additive, and synergistic effects ===
The primary utility of toxic units is to classify mixture interactions as additive, synergistic or antagonistic. Additivity means that the toxicity of the mixture is equal to the sum of the toxicities of the individual components. Additivity is the default assumption of models used to predict toxicity of mixtures for regulatory and environmental management purposes. Synergistic effects occur when the experimental toxicity of the mixture is greater than the sum of the individual toxicities. Conversely, antagonistic effects occur when the experimental toxicity of a mixture is less than would be predicted by additivity. Understanding mixture interactions can prevent over or underestimation of toxicity by regulators who assume additivity for uncategorized mixtures.

== Applications ==

=== Equilibrium partitioning sediment benchmarks ===
The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|U.S. EPA]] uses toxic units as a benchmark, called the [[Equilibrium partitioning sediment benchmarks|equilibrium partitioning sediment benchmark (ESB)]], for predicting the toxicity of [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon]] (PAH)-contaminated sediments to benthic invertebrates.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. 2003. Procedures for the derivation of ESBs for the protection of benthic organisms: PAH mixtures. EPA/600/R-02/013. Office of Research and Development, Washington, DC.&lt;/ref&gt; Toxic units are calculated from sediment concentrations of 34 PAHs and their expected sediment, water, and lipid partitioning behavior. Based on the equilibrium partitioning approach (which accounts for the varying biological availability of chemicals in different sediments), the ESB for total PAH is the sum of the quotients of a minimum of each of the 34 individual PAHs in a specific sediment, divided by the final chronic value concentration for each specific PAH in sediment. According to the U.S. EPA, freshwater or saltwater sediments that contain less or equal to 1.0 toxic units of the mixture of the 34 PAHs or more PAHs are acceptable for the protection of benthic organisms. Sediments that are greater than 1.0 toxic units are not protective and potentially have adverse effects to benthic organisms.

U.S. EPA ESBs do not consider antagonistic, additive, or synergistic effects of other sediment contaminants and have been criticized as an overly conservative estimate for pyrogenic PAHs (such as those from manufactured gas plant processes).&lt;ref&gt;Hawthorne SB, DJ Miller, and JP Kreitinger. 2006. Measurement of total polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon concentrations in sediments and toxic units used for estimating risk to benthic invertebrates at manufactured gas plant sites. ''Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry'' 25(1):287-296&lt;/ref&gt; This is in part due to the analytical approaches for determining the toxic units for both pyrogenic and petrogenic PAHs.

=== Toxicity identification evaluation ===
The toxicity identification evaluation (TIE) is an approach to systematically characterize, identify, and confirm toxic substances in whole sediments and sediment interstitial waters.&lt;ref&gt;Burgess RM and KT Ho. Sediment Toxicity Identification Evaluation. Chapter S, Ferard and Blaise (ed.), Encyclopedia of Aquatic Ecotoxicology. Springer, New York, NY, 8/13/2013:online, (2013).&lt;/ref&gt; This approach is typically carried out by the U.S. EPA. The effluent effect concentration data and the measured toxicant concentration data are transformed to toxic units for the regression analysis to evaluate whether a linear relationship exists between two or more toxicants.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. 1993. Methods for Aquatic Toxicity Identification Evaluations: Phase III Toxicity Confirmation Procedures for Samples Exhibiting Acute and Chronic Toxicity. EPA/600/R-92/081. Office of Research and Development, Washington, DC.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Limitations ==
The limitations associated with using Toxic Units are largely dependent on the methodology in which they are being used. For example, the use of isobolograms is applicable to only binary mixtures. In general, Toxic Units are based on point estimates which are limited by projection. Point estimates, and therefore Toxic Units, are a simplification of a [[Dose–response relationship|dose-response model]]. Information about toxic effects at concentrations other than the point estimate are lost in translation.

=== Alternative ways to study mixtures ===

==== Top-down Approach ====
A common method for studying mixtures is to measure the total toxicity of the mixture and consider the internal toxicant interactions as irrelevant.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Any mixture effects are taken into account in the total toxicity. The results for this method are limited by being mixture specific and has limited value in determining specific mechanisms of toxicity.

==== GLM Approach ====
Using [[Generalized linear model|Generalized Linear Models (GLM)]] allows for complex, non-parametric model fitting to describe the toxicity complex mixtures. Generalized Linear Models are more likely to find significant differences from additivity than TU approaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/37981637|title=Fundamentals of ecotoxicology|last=C.|first=Newman, Michael|date=1998|publisher=Ann Arbor Press|isbn=1575040131|oclc=37981637}}&lt;/ref&gt; The GLM approach also allows for the alteration of models to reflect current knowledge of biological mechanisms&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Complex Mixtures: Methods for In Vivo Toxicity Testing|last=National Research Council (US) Committee on Methods for the In Vivo Toxicity Testing of Complex Mixtures|first=|publisher=National Academies Press (US)|year=1998|isbn=|location=Washington DC|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Triple Modular Redundancy.JPG|thumb|right|350px|Triple Modular Redundancy. Three identical logic circuits (logic gates) are used to compute the specified Boolean function. The set of data at the input of the first circuit are identical to the input of the second and third gates.]]

In [[computing]], '''triple modular redundancy''', sometimes called '''triple-mode redundancy''',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xilinx.com/publications/archives/xcell/Xcell50.pdf David Ratter. "FPGAs on Mars"]&lt;/ref&gt; (TMR) is a [[fault-tolerant]] form of [[N-modular redundancy]], in which three systems perform a process and that result is processed by a majority-voting system to produce a single output. If any one of the three systems fails, the other two systems can correct and mask the fault.

The TMR concept can be applied to many forms of [[Redundancy (engineering)|redundancy]], such as software redundancy in the form of [[N-version programming]], and is commonly found in [[fault-tolerant computer system]]s.

Some [[ECC memory]] uses triple modular redundancy hardware (rather than the more common [[Hamming code]]), because triple modular redundancy hardware is faster than Hamming error correction software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Some communication systems use N-modular redundancy as a simple form of [[forward error correction]]. For example, 5-modular redundancy communication systems (such as [[FlexRay]]) use the majority of 5 samples &amp;ndash; if any 2 of the 5 results are erroneous, the other 3 results can correct and mask the fault.

Modular redundancy is a basic concept, dating to antiquity, while the first use of TMR in a computer was the Czechoslovak computer [[SAPO (computer)|SAPO]], in the 1950s.

==Chronometers==
To use triple modular redundancy, a ship must have at least three [[Marine chronometer|chronometers]]; two chronometers provided [[dual modular redundancy]], allowing a backup if one should cease to work, but not allowing any [[error correction]] if the two displayed a different time, since in case of contradiction between the  two chronometers, it would be impossible to know which one was wrong (the [[error detection]] obtained would be the same of having only one chronometer and checking it periodically). Three chronometers provided triple modular redundancy, allowing [[error correction]] if one of the three was wrong, so the pilot would take the average of the two with closer reading (vote for average precision).

There is an old adage to this effect, stating: "Never go to sea with two chronometers; take one or three."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | isbn = 0-201-83595-9 | title = [[The Mythical Man-Month]] | last = Brooks | first = Frederick J. | authorlink = Fred Brooks | year = 1995 | origyear = 1975 | publisher = Addison-Wesley | page = 64  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mainly this means that if two [[Marine chronometer|chronometers]] contradict, how do you know which one is correct? At one time this observation or rule was an expensive one as the cost of three sufficiently accurate chronometers was more than the cost of many types of smaller merchant vessels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Some vessels carried more than three chronometers &amp;ndash; for example, the [[HMS Beagle]] carried [[List of chronometers on HMS Beagle|22 chronometers]].&lt;ref&gt;

In the modern era, ships at sea use GNSS navigation receivers (with [[GPS]], [[GLONASS]] &amp; WAAS etc. support) -- mostly running with WAAS or ENGOS support so as to provide accurate time (and location).

== Majority logic gate ==
In TMR, three identical logic circuits (logic gates) are used to compute the same set of specified Boolean function. If there are no circuit failures, the outputs of the three circuits are identical. But due to circuit failures, the outputs of the three circuits may be different.

A majority logic gate is used to decide which of the circuits’ outputs is the correct output. The majority gate output is 1 if two or more of the inputs of the majority gate are 1; output is 0 if two or more of the majority gate’s inputs are 0.

The majority logic gate is a simple AND–OR circuit: if the inputs to the majority gate are denoted by x, y and z, then the output of the majority gate is 
:&lt;math&gt; xy \lor yz \lor xz &lt;/math&gt;  
Thus, the majority gate is the [[Carry (arithmetic)#Computing|carry output]] of a [[full adder]], i.e., the majority gate is a [[voting machine]].&lt;ref name=DilipSarwate2012/&gt;

==TMR operation==
Assuming the Boolean function computed by the three identical logic gates has value 1, then: (a) if no circuit has failed, all three circuits produce an output of value 1, and the majority gate output has value 1. (b)	 if one circuit fails and produces an output of 0, while the other two are working correctly and produce an output of 1, the majority gate output is 1, i.e., it still has the correct value. And similarly for the case when the Boolean function computed by the three identical circuits has value 0.  Thus, the majority gate output is guaranteed to be correct as long as no more than one of the three identical logic circuits has failed.&lt;ref name=DilipSarwate2012&gt;Professor Dilip V. Sarwate, Lecture Notes for ECE 413 - Probability with Engineering Applications, [[UIUC College of Engineering#Departments|Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering (ECE)]], [[UIUC College of Engineering]], [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]]&lt;/ref&gt;

TMR systems should use [[data scrubbing]]—rewrite flip-flops periodically—in order to avoid accumulation of errors.&lt;ref&gt;

== Voter ==

The majority gate itself could fail.
Is there a way to mask that failure?
In other words, [[Quis custodiet ipsos custodes?|who guards the guardians?]]&lt;ref&gt;

In a few TMR systems, such as
the [[Saturn Launch Vehicle Digital Computer]] and
'''functional triple modular redundancy (FTMR)''' systems,
the voters are also triplicated.
Three voters are used &amp;ndash; one for each copy of the next stage of TMR logic. 
In such systems there is no [[single point of failure]].

&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in contrast to the relatively complicated Boolean functions computed in triplicate by the TMR system, the majority gate is a simple circuit, thus its probability of failure is significantly smaller than that of each of the three circuits computing the Boolean function.&lt;ref name=DilipSarwate2012/&gt;
In other systems there is only a single voter—If the voter fails in such a system, then the complete system will fail.
However, in a good TMR system the voter is much more [[Reliability engineering|reliable]] than the other TMR components.

== Triple modular redundancy in popular culture ==
* The three pre-cogs in [[The Minority Report|Minority Report]] lead to a conviction even when one disagrees.
* To rule out that a single win was "a fluke", some competitions use a [[two out of three falls match]]. This isn't true TMR, however, because the three falls are not independent of each other &amp;ndash; each competitor knows who has most falls at any point in the competition, which influences their future actions.
* In [[Arthur C. Clarke]]'s science fiction novel ''[[Rendezvous with Rama]]'', the Ramans make heavy use of triple redundancy.
