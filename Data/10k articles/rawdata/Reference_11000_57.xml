      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8196">"'''Addiction Rare in Patients Treated with Narcotics'''" was the title of a [[letter to the editor]] published by Jane Porter and [[Hershel Jick]] in the January 10, 1980, issue of ''[[The New England Journal of Medicine]]''. The letter analyzed data on patients who had been treated with [[opioid]]s in a hospital setting, and concluded that addiction was uncommon among such patients. It has since been frequently misrepresented to claim that opioids are not addictive when prescribed for use at home, which has been blamed for contributing to the [[opioid epidemic]] in the United States.
==Content==
The letter reported on an examination of medical files of patients who had been hospitalized at [[Boston University Medical Center]] and subsequently treated with small doses of [[opioid]]s. The authors concluded that of the 11,882 patients who received at least one narcotic drug, only four of them had developed a "reasonably well documented" addiction among patients who had no history of addiction. Its text read, in its entirety: {{blockquote|Recently, we examined our current files to determine the incidence of narcotic addiction in 39,946 hospitalized medical patients who were monitored consecutively. Although there were 11,882 patients who received at least one narcotic preparation, there were only four cases of reasonably well documented addiction in patients who had no history of addiction. The addiction was considered major in only one instance. The drugs implicated were meperidine in two patients, Percodan in one, and hydromorphone in one. We conclude that despite widespread use of narcotic drugs in hospitals, the development of addiction is rare in medical patients with no history of addiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Addiction Rare in Patients Treated with Narcotics|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|date=10 January 1980|volume=302|issue=2|pages=123–123|doi=10.1056/NEJM198001103020221|url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJM198001103020221|pmid=7350425}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Influence==
The article was subsequently cited extensively as evidence that addiction was very rare among patients who were prescribed narcotics (more specifically, opioids).&lt;ref name=business&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.businessinsider.com/porter-and-jick-letter-launched-the-opioid-epidemic-2016-5 | title=This one-paragraph letter may have launched the opioid epidemic | work=Business Insider | date=26 May 2016 | accessdate=24 June 2017 | author=Jacobs, Harrison}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cnn&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/06/01/health/opioid-epidemic-1980-letter-origins-study/index.html | title=One short letter's huge impact on the opioid epidemic | work=CNN | date=1 June 2017 | accessdate=24 June 2017 | author=Kounang, Nadia}}&lt;/ref&gt; It became so well known that it is sometimes referred to simply as '''Porter and Jick'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2017/06/02/how-the-opioid-crisis-traces-back-to-a-five-sentence-scholarly-letter-from-1980/ | title=How a short letter in a prestigious journal contributed to the opioid crisis | work=The Washington Post | date=2 June 2017 | accessdate=24 June 2017 | author=Hawkins, Derek}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Methodological limitations===
Methodological limitations from which the letter suffered included that the patients it reported on were all given opioids in small doses in a hospital, and were not given the opportunity to use them at home.&lt;ref name=business/&gt;&lt;ref name=cnn/&gt; Additionally, in 2003, Jick told ''[[The New York Times]]'' that the study did not follow patients after they left the hospital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/11/25/science/the-delicate-balance-of-pain-and-addiction.html | title=The Delicate Balance Of Pain and Addiction | work=The New York Times | date=25 November 2003 | accessdate=24 June 2017 | author=Meier, Barry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Misrepresentation===
In 2017, the letter attracted renewed interest because the ''New England Journal of Medicine'' published a bibliographic analysis of the letter showing that it had been cited 608 times since it was published. In comparison, the other letters to the editor in the same issue of the ''Journal'' as Porter and Jick's letter had been cited a median of 11 times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.latimes.com/science/sciencenow/la-sci-sn-opioid-addiction-letter-20170531-story.html | title=How a 5-sentence letter helped fuel the opioid addiction crisis | work=Los Angeles Times | date=31 May 2017 | accessdate=25 June 2017 | author=Kaplan, Karen}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of these 608 citations, the analysis also showed that 72.2% of them cited it in support of the claim that patients treated with opioids rarely developed addiction, and 80.8% did not mention that the letter only included data on prescriptions given to hospitalized patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Leung|first1=Pamela T.M.|last2=Macdonald|first2=Erin M.|last3=Stanbrook|first3=Matthew B.|last4=Dhalla|first4=Irfan A.|last5=Juurlink|first5=David N.|title=A 1980 Letter on the Risk of Opioid Addiction|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|date=June 2017|volume=376|issue=22|pages=2194–2195|doi=10.1056/NEJMc1700150}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also misrepresented in the popular media; a 1990 ''[[Scientific American]]'' article described it as an "extensive study," and a 2001 ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' story dubbed it a "landmark study" showing that concerns about opioid addiction were "basically unwarranted."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2017/06/nejm-letter-opioids/528840/ | title=The One-Paragraph Letter From 1980 That Fueled the Opioid Crisis | work=The Atlantic | date=2 June 2017 | accessdate=24 June 2017 | author=Zhang, Sarah}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, [[Purdue Pharma]], the manufacturer of [[OxyContin]], trained its sales representatives to say that the risk of addiction among patients using the drug was less than 1 percent, citing Porter and Jick's letter as one of their sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Van Zee|first1=Art|title=The Promotion and Marketing of OxyContin: Commercial Triumph, Public Health Tragedy|journal=American Journal of Public Health|date=February 2009|volume=99|issue=2|pages=221–227|doi=10.2105/AJPH.2007.131714|pmc=2622774}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Role in the opioid epidemic===
Because the letter has been frequently misrepresented to argue that opioids were rarely addictive, these misrepresentations have been blamed for contributing to the opioid epidemic.&lt;ref name=cnn/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/science/2017/06/how_bad_footnotes_helped_cause_the_opioid_crisis.html | title=Bad Footnotes Can Be Deadly | work=Slate | date=11 June 2017 | accessdate=24 June 2017 | author=Engber, Daniel}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the lead author of the 2017 bibliographic analysis, [[David Juurlink]], has stated that he thinks the letter's appearance in a prestigious journal helped convince doctors that opioids were safe, saying, "I think it's fair to say that this letter went quite a long way."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-40136881 | title=Opioid crisis: The letter that started it all | work=BBC News | date=3 June 2017 | accessdate=24 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jick, who wrote the letter, has since said that "The letter wasn't of value to health and medicine in and of itself. So if I could take it back—if I knew then what I know now, I would never have published it. It wasn't worth it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/06/16/533060031/doctor-who-wrote-1980-letter-on-painkillers-regrets-that-it-fed-the-opioid-crisi | title=Doctor Who Wrote 1980 Letter On Painkillers Regrets That It Fed The Opioid Crisis | work=NPR | date=16 June 2017 | accessdate=24 June 2017 | author=Haney, Taylor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''April''''' ({{lang-it|'''Aprile'''}}) is a 1998 [[Cinema of Italy|Italian]] semi-autobiographical film directed by [[Nanni Moretti]]. Moretti also played the central character, a filmmaker who has to deal with Italy's political situation, his own goals as an artist and becoming a father.

"He wants to make a musical comedy but he can't get started. So instead he talks about his life, his new baby, his desires and fears. Finally in the very last scene he begins."&lt;ref&gt;French director [[Claire Denis]] describing the film that 'gave me courage at a time when I was a little lost and sad,' - Daily Telegraph August 16, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Moretti's wife, son and mother appear as themselves.

==Plot==
Following the general election of 1994, won by the centre-right coalition led by [[Silvio Berlusconi]], Moretti is encouraged by a journalist friend to make a documentary about the current political situation in Italy. Two years pass, another election is held, and Moretti has still made no progress with his documentary. He begins shooting another project, alluded to in ''[[Dear Diary (1993 film)|Dear Diary]]'', a musical about a Trotskyist pastry chef set in the 1950s, but he becomes disillusioned and is distracted by his wife Silvia’s pregnancy, which preoccupies him more and more. His son Pietro is born, and the centre-left coalition [[Ulivo]] wins the election.  Moretti continues to try to shoot his documentary in [[Venice]] and [[Apulia]], but the film is never finished. On his forty-fourth birthday he realises that he must stop hesitating and he finally begins shooting his musical in earnest.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1668">The '''Bristol Record Society''' is a [[text publication society]] which publishes scholarly editions of historical records and texts relating to the history of the City of [[Bristol]]. Founded in 1929, it is one of the oldest such societies devoted to the publication of material relating to an individual town or city. Through its history, it has typically published at least one volume each year, on matters ranging from the civic charters of the medieval city,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-first=N.D. |editor-last=Harding |title=Bristol Charters, 1155-1373 |series=Bristol Record Society Publications |volume=1 |year=1930 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to the diary of Sarah Fox, an 18th-century [[Quakers|Quaker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor-first=M. |editor-last=Dresser |title=The Diary of Sarah Fox |series=Bristol Record Society Publications |volume=55 |year=2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The core aims of the Society have long been to promote historical research into the City of [[Bristol]] by making available, in print form, records that relate to the history of the city. 

Like many other record societies, the Bristol Record Society is now also seeking to make more of the city's records available in electronic form. To this effect it has announced, for instance, its intention to make many of its back issues available via bodies such as [[Google Books]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4083">The '''Brygos Cup of Würzburg''' ([[German language|de]]: ''Würzburger Brygosschale'') is an [[Attica|Attic]] [[red-figure pottery|red-figure]] [[kylix (drinking cup)|kylix]] from about 480 BC. It was made by the [[Brygos]] potter and painted by the man known as the [[Brygos Painter]]. It depicts some of the best-known images of [[Greek vase|ancient pottery]].

[[File:Würzburger Brygosschale 2.jpg|thumb|Exterior of the Brygos cup of Würzburg: [[komos|Komasts]] on the move, [[barbiton]] player at left, [[aulos]] player at middle right]]
Apart from a fracture on the base of the cup, the kylix remains intact. It is a kylix, a particularly successful example of ''Type B'' of the more than a hundred forms of Attic pottery cups. The contours of the vessel are perfectly worked from lip to foot. On the untreated clay inside of the left handle, the potter Brygos has left his signature in dainty letters: ΒΡΥΓΟΣ ΕΠΟΙΕΣΕΝ (Brygos made this). In the scholarship it is controversial as to whether it was personally produced by the Brygos painter and the Brygos potter. The painter was identified with the [[notname]] ''Brygos Painter'' by [[John Beazley]], who also argued that the potter of the Würzburg cup was one of very great ability. The cup is 14 centimetres high and has a diameter of 32.2 centimetres. It once belonged to the [[Feoli collection]], but today is in the [[Martin von Wagner Museum]] in [[Würzburg]], where it has the inventory number HA 248 (= L 479).
[[File:Würzburger Brygosschale 1.jpg|thumb|left|Interior with vomiting scene]]
The image in the bowl ([[Tondo (art)|Tondo]]) shows a young participant at a [[symposion]] who is throwing up as a result of overindulgence. A blonde woman helpfully and carefully holds his head. Because only prostitutes were generally present at such parties, she should also be a [[Hetaira]]. Both are depicted wearing garlands. The young man supports himself with his walking stick, which is the symbol of leisure. Probably he is a young aristocrat. The image is surrounded by a [[Meander (art)|meander]]. 
[[File:Würzburger Brygosschale 3.jpg|thumb|Exterior of the Brygos cup of Würzburg: [[komos|Komasts]] on the move]]
The exterior shows a procession of revelers (''[[komos]]''), the boisterous event which occurred at the end of a symposion. The komasts are largely naked, dressed in only a [[chlamys]] (cloak), and are crown with grape vines. The cloaks are depicted with the scattered dots which are typical of the Brygos painter. One of the revelers plays the [[aulos]] (a double flute), another plays the [[barbiton]] (a type of lyre). The participants in the procession head off with bouncy steps. A few details, such as their headbands and vine wreaths are painted in the same red as their skin. Above all, the tondo image and the barbiton player are images which were often reproduced in the literary tradition and other media.&lt;ref&gt;For example, this website on [http://www.musikarchaeologie.de/ music archaeology] and this one on [http://www.museum.uni-wuerzburg.de/Musikausstellung.html music and dance in ancient Greece] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120429060211/http://www.museum.uni-wuerzburg.de/Musikausstellung.html |date=April 29, 2012 }} take the barbiton player as a symbolic image, while [[John Boardman (art historian)|John Boardman]]'s handbook ''Rotfigurige Vasen in Athen. Die archaische Zeit'', von Zabern, Mainz 1981 shows this image on the dust jacket.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Chronique d'un été''''' ("Chronicle of a Summer") is a 1961 French [[documentary film]] shot during the summer of 1960 by [[sociologist]] [[Edgar Morin]] and [[anthropologist]] and [[filmmaker]] [[Jean Rouch]], with the technical and aesthetic collaboration of Québécois director-cameraman [[Michel Brault]].

The film begins with a discussion between Rouch and Morin on whether or not it is possible to act sincerely in front of a camera. A cast of real-life individuals are then introduced and are led by the filmmakers to discuss topics on the themes of French society and happiness in the working class. At the end of the movie, the filmmakers show their subjects the compiled footage and have the subjects discuss the level of reality that they thought the movie obtained.

This feature was filmed in [[Paris]] and [[Saint-Tropez]], [[France]]. [[Synchronized sound]] was used by Rouch using a [[16 mm]] camera connected through [[pilottone]] with a prototype of [[Nagra|Nagra III]], a transistorized tape recorder with electronic speed control, developed by [[Stefan Kudelski]].

It is also widely regarded as an experimental and structurally innovative film and an example of ''[[cinéma vérité]]'' and [[direct cinema]]. The term "cinema verite" was suggested by the film's publicist and coined by Rouch, highlighting a connection between film and its context, a fact Brault confirmed in an interview after a screening of ''Chronique d'un été'' at the TIFF Bell Lightbox in Toronto in 2011.

In a 2014 ''[[Sight and Sound]]'' poll, film critics voted ''Chronicle of a Summer'' the sixth best documentary film of all time.&lt;ref name="BBC-doc"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-28602506 |title=Silent film tops documentary poll |accessdate=1 August 2014 |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Cihai''''' is a large-scale [[Chinese dictionary|dictionary]] and [[Chinese encyclopedia|encyclopedia]] of [[Standard Mandarin|Standard Mandarin Chinese]]. The [[Zhonghua Book Company]] published the first ''Cihai'' edition in 1938, and the [[Shanghai Lexicographical Publishing House]] revised editions in 1979, 1989, 1999, and 2009.&lt;ref name="cihai"/&gt; A standard bibliography of Chinese [[reference works]] (Teng and Biggerstaff 1971:134) calls the ''Cihai'' an "outstanding dictionary".

==Contents==
The ''Cihai'' is a semi-encyclopedic dictionary and enters Chinese words from many fields of knowledge, such as history, science, mathematics, philosophy, medicine, and law.

Chinese lexicography dichotomizes [[Chinese dictionary#Terminology|two kinds of dictionaries]]: traditional ''zidian'' ({{linktext|字典}}, lit. "character/logograph dictionary") for written [[Chinese character]]s and modern ''cidian'' ({{linktext|辭典}} "word/phrase dictionary") for spoken expressions. For example, the ''[[Hanyu Da Zidian]]'' for characters and ''[[Hanyu Da Cidian]]'' for words. The ''Cihai'', as the title indicates, is a ''cidian''.

The American sinologist [[George A. Kennedy (sinologist)|George A. Kennedy]], who wrote a student's guide to using the ''Cihai'' as the basis for sinological studies, said the dictionary's principal values are its (1953:85) "explanations for phrases and compound expressions" and (1953:131) "citations illustrating the use of words and expressions."

==History==
[[File:Cihai 1937.JPG|thumb|1937 first edition ''Cihai'']]
The ''Cihai'' originated when [[Lufei Kui]], founder of the Zhonghua Book Company, decided to publish a comprehensive Chinese dictionary to compete with rival [[Commercial Press]]'s 1915 ''[[Ciyuan]]'' (辭源 "source of words") (Wilkinson 2000:89).  Under the editorship of [[Shu Xincheng]] (舒新城, 1893-1960), Shen Yi (沈颐）and others,{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}} over 100 lexicographers worked for two decades to compile the ''Cihai'', which was published in 1936. This 2-volume first edition has over 80,000 entries arranged under single characters in [[Collation#Radical-and-stroke sorting|radical-stroke order]], with the words and compounds under each character listed by the number of characters and strokes. The definitions are written in ''[[wenyan]]'' "literary Chinese" (Hartmann 2003:166). The [[Taiwan]] branch of Zhonghua published a ''Cihai'' reprint in 1956 with minor revisions additions and corrections (Yang 1985:279).

Plans for a second edition began after a 1958 conference about revising the ''Cihai'' and ''Ciyuan''. The ''Cihai'' Editorial Committee organized over 5000 scholars and specialists to undertake the new compilation, concentrating on revising the first edition entries and adding modern terminology, especially scientific and technical terminology. [[Reinhard Hartmann]] (2003:166) describes the editorial work of revising ''Cihai'' as taking "a tortuous course, 22 years from start to finish". After the original editor-in-chief Shu Xincheng died in 1960, he was succeeded by [[Chen Wangdao]], who died in 1977, and was succeeded by [[Xia Zhengnong]] (夏征农, 1904-2008). From 1961 to 1962, sixteen ''shiyong'' (試用 "trial") individual subject-matter fascicles were distributed for comments by specialists, and in 1965 a ''weidinggao'' (未定稿 "draft manuscript") ''Cihai'' was completed, but the [[anti-intellectualism]] of the [[Cultural Revolution]] (1966-1976) halted editorial work (Huang et al. 1993:220). [[Shanghai Dictionary Publishing House]] (上海辭書出版社) published the three-volume revised edition ''Cihai'' in 1979 and a condensed single-volume version in 1980.

The revised 1979 edition has the same title and layout as the original 1936 edition, but serves a much different purpose (Wilkinson 2000:89). The first edition covers China's past and uses literary Chinese for definitions, while the second edition also covers modern China and international matters and uses ''[[Written vernacular Chinese|baihua]]'' "colloquial speech". It contains 106,578 entries, totaling more than 13.4 million characters. The single character headwords are arranged under 250 [[Radical (Chinese characters)|radicals]], with subsequent words listed according to [[Stroke (CJKV character)|stroke]] numbers. The third volume appends useful charts (e.g., a chronology of Chinese history), tables (weights and measures), lists ([[Ethnic minorities in China]]), and a ''pinyin'' index to single characters.

The 1989 three-volume edition ''Cihai'' was also compiled with Xia Zhengnong as editor-in-chief. It focused upon the addition of 20th-century terms, more proper names, and technical vocabulary. This third edition ''Cihai'' contains 16,534 head characters, with more than 120,000 entries, totaling over 15.8 million characters. (Huang et al. 1993:223-224)

[[File:100 1298.jpg|thumb|250px|1999 compact fourth edition ''Cihai'']]
The 1999 ''Cihai'' contains 17,674 head characters, 122,835 entries, totaling more than 19.8 million characters. This fourth edition dictionary added many color tables and illustrations. Arrangement is by radicals and there are stroke-count, four-corner, ''pinyin'', and foreign-language indexes (Wilkinson 2000:89). It was also published in a compact version.

''Cihai'' was consulted in the writing of ''[[The First Series of Standardized Forms of Words with Non-standardized Variant Forms]]''.&lt;ref name="yixingci"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ling.whu.edu.cn/law/002/2016-04-20/1300.html |title=第一批异形词整理表（试行）|language=Simplified Chinese|author=国家语言文字工作委员会|quote=|date=20 April 2016|accessdate=21 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3}}

The 2009 fifth edition ''Cihai'' contains more than 127,200 entries, arranged by ''pinyin'', with over 22 million characters total. [[Chen Zhili]] replaced Xia Zhengnong as chief editor, and lexicographers deleted about 7,000 entries for outdated terms and added almost 10,000 for neologisms. Volumes 1-4 contain text, with many color illustrations,  and Volume 5 contains indexes.

The ''[[Dacihai]]'' (大辞海 "Great sea of words") is a 38-volume encyclopedia project that began in 2004, and published the first volumes in 2008.

'''''Climbing Free: My Life in the Vertical World''''' is an [[autobiography]] written by American [[rock climber]] [[Lynn Hill]]. Co-written with [[mountaineer]] and writer [[Greg Child]], it was published in 2002 by [[W.W. Norton &amp; Company]].

Hill describes the writing process with Child as collaborative: "He would take my writings and organize them, and he encouraged me to elaborate on certain elements. He emphasized that telling the story is what's important, so he really helped me think about what I wanted to say, and figure out who my audience was."&lt;ref name=Potterfield&gt;{{cite web|last=Potterfield|first=Peter|title=Lynn Hill: One of the great rock climbers of the era takes on writing and motherhood|url=http://www.greatoutdoors.com/published/lynn-hill|publisher=greatoutdoors.com|accessdate=12 December 2012|date=9 December 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hill explained in an interview that writing about past events was easier because she had had time to reflect on them. She wanted to "convey the history and culture of free climbing", specifically how it became as specialized as it is today. She felt that she had a unique perspective to offer, both as someone who climbed at a particular moment in climbing history and as a woman: "And I wonder if a male writer would have presented that information differently. I think the book is important from that stand point, because I am a woman, and there are not many female viewpoints on climbing, or the history of climbing, out there."&lt;ref name=Potterfield/&gt; Writing about climbing in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s was dominated by men. As accomplished American climber and writer [[Rachel de Silva]] explains, the six major American climbing magazines published fewer than 12 articles a year by or about women during the 1980s despite women comprising 40% of climbers. It was not until 1990 that the first women-centric climbing books appeared.&lt;ref name=silva&gt;{{Citation

==Reception==
One review of the book described it as "more diary than memoir" and praises Hill's storytelling when recounting her adventurous climbs but contends that it ultimately fails due to a lack of editing. Too much personal detail about family and boyfriends is included.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Anastasi|first=Michael|title=Book Review: Climbing Free|newspaper=The Daily News of Los Angeles|date=18 July 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' and ''[[Library Journal]]'', on the other hand, found it entertaining and wrote glowingly of Hill's ability to narrate a good story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ruffle|first=Kathy|title=Climbing Free (Book)|journal=Library Journal|date=15 July 2002|volume=127|issue=12|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zaleski|first=Jeff|title=Climbing Free (Book)|journal=Publishers Weekly|date=29 April 2002|volume=249|issue=17|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Conservatory and Botanical Garden of the city of Geneva''' ('''{{lang|fr|Conservatoire et Jardin botaniques de la Ville de Genève}}''') is a museum and an institution of the [[Geneva|City of Geneva]].

==Establishment and location==
It was founded in 1817 in a former area of ''Bastions Park'' in 1817 by [[Augustin Pyramus de Candolle]]. The Botanical Gardens were transferred to the Console site (192 rue de Lausanne) in 1904, constructed by the Genevan architect Henri Juvet in 1902–1904 specifically to house the [[Jules Paul Benjamin Delessert|Delessert]] herbarium held at Bastions. The collection grew in 1911–1912 with the gift of the Emile Burant herbarium, then again in 1923–1924 with the posthumous donation of the de Candolle herbarium. In its present location, it occupies an area of {{convert|28|ha|acres}} adjacent to [[Lake Geneva]] and the park of the [[United Nations Office at Geneva]] and ranks as one of the five most important in the world. The gardens themselves were designed by {{ill|Jules Allemand|fr}}. The Botanical Garden's greenhouses initially remained at the Bastions site for financial reasons. Then, in 1910–1911, the architect Henri Juvet built a Winter Garden along the former Chemin de Varembe, which was moved to its present location close to the railway lines following the construction of the [[Palace of Nations|Palais des Nations]] and the various associated urban redevelopments that took place. The elegant glass and iron structure is in line with constructions of this type in fashion in the second half of the 19th century. It originally comprised two adjacent but separate sections: the Winter Garden and a greenhouse, creating an asymmetrical effect. A symmetrical wing was added to the first in 1935. The greenhouses at Bastions were removed to make way for the [[Reformation Wall|Wall of the Reformers]].

==Collections==
The botanical garden includes a living collection of 14,000 species of 249 different families from around the world, and a historical [[herbarium]] of nearly 6 million botanical specimens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ville-ge.ch/cjb/herbier_historique_intro_en.php |title=CJB Herbarium |accessdate=16 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The library of over 220,000 volumes

The living collection is divided into several sections: an arboretum, rock gardens and banks of protected plants, medicinal and useful plants, greenhouses, horticultural plants (including a "garden of scent and touch"). The garden also incorporates a [[zoo]] dedicated to conservation and the ''Botanicum'' (a family space) near the lake.

==National classification==
The entire garden, including greenhouses, libraries and collections, and two mansions "Le Chene" and "La Console", is registered as a cultural asset of national importance.&lt;ref name=kgs&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bevoelkerungsschutz.admin.ch/internet/bs/fr/home/themen/kgs/kgs_inventar/a-objekte.parsys.000102.DownloadFile.tmp/ge.pdf |title=L'inventaire édité par la confédération suisse, canton de Genève |trans-title=Swiss inventory of the Canton of Geneva |language=fr |format=pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150217154957/http://www.bevoelkerungsschutz.admin.ch/internet/bs/fr/home/themen/kgs/kgs_inventar/a-objekte.parsys.000102.DownloadFile.tmp/ge.pdf |archivedate=2015-02-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Activities==
The institution has a special interest in the medicinal plants of [[Paraguay]], with about 5000 known plants thanks to the legacy of the [[Guaraní people]], preserved by the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] [[Jesuit reduction|missions]] and the collections of [[Emil Hassler]]. The Paraguayan Ethnobotany Project was established in the mid 1990s in collaboration with the [[Botanical Garden and Zoo of Asunción|Botanical Garden and Zoo]] of [[Asunción]]. This collaborative framework has facilitated the creation of a large herbarium of Paraguayan medicinal plants and the creation of the ''{{lang|es|Centro de Conservación y Educación Ambiental}}'' (Center for Conservation and Environmental Education: CCEAM), located within the Botanical Garden of Asunción.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Organic status==
From 1 January 2015, under leadership of head gardener Nicolas Freyre and Director [[Pierre-André Loizeau]], the Conservatory and Botanical Gardens became 100% [[Organic certification|organic]], the first public garden in Switzerland to formally meet the standards of [[Bio Suisse]]. Although previously almost entirely organic, a bachelor student from the [[Haute École du paysage, d'ingénierie et d'architecture de Genève]] validated the requirements. In 2017 the garden will be able to display the Bio Suisse 'Bud' certification label on completion of the required qualification period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rts.ch/play/tv/couleurs-locales/video/ge-les-autorites-souhaitent-se-mettre-au-100--bio-en-ce-qui-concerne-tous-ses-espaces-verts?id=6632288 |title=GE: les autorités souhaitent se mettre au 100 % bio en ce qui concerne tous ses espaces verts |trans-title=Geneva: The authorities want to make all public spaces 100% organic  |publisher=[[Radio télévision suisse]] |language=fr |date=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tdg.ch/geneve/actu-genevoise/jardin-botanique-100-biologique/story/31958994 |title=Le Jardin botanique est 100% biologique |trans-title=The Botanic Garden is 100% organic |newspaper=Tribune de Genève | language=fr |date=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''DODX Guard Car No. G-56''' is a historic railroad car at the [[Arkansas Railroad Museum]] in [[Pine Bluff, Arkansas]].  It was built about 1942 by the [[American Car and Foundry Company]], and is a rare surviving example of a [[World War II]] troop transport, and as a railroad guard car used by the [[United States Department of Defense]] in the management of hazardous and valuable cargos that it transported by rail.  The car is silver, with a horizontal black stripe on the side.&lt;ref name=NRHP&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arkansaspreservation.com/National-Register-Listings/PDF/JE0689.nr.pdf|title=NRHP nomination for DODX Guard Car No. G-56|publisher=Arkansas Preservation|accessdate=2015-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Deadpool 2''''' is a 2018 American &lt;!-- Please do not add "comedy" or any other genres here. We use the most general category for the lead.--&gt;[[superhero film]]&lt;!-- Please do not add "comedy" or any other genres here. We use the most general category for the lead. --&gt; based on the [[Marvel Comics]] character [[Deadpool]], distributed by [[20th Century Fox]]. It is the eleventh installment in the [[X-Men (film series)|''X-Men'' film series]], and a direct sequel to the 2016 film ''[[Deadpool (film)|Deadpool]]''. The film is directed by [[David Leitch (director)|David Leitch]] from a script by [[Rhett Reese]], [[Paul Wernick]], and [[Ryan Reynolds]], with Reynolds starring in the title role alongside [[Josh Brolin]], [[Morena Baccarin]], [[Julian Dennison]], [[Zazie Beetz]], [[T.J. Miller]], [[Brianna Hildebrand]], and [[Jack Kesy]]. In the film, Deadpool forms the team [[X-Force]] to protect a young mutant from the time-traveling soldier [[Cable (comics)|Cable]].

Plans for a sequel to ''Deadpool'' began before that film's release, and were confirmed in February 2016. Though the original creative team of Reynolds, Reese, Wernick, and director [[Tim Miller (director)|Tim Miller]] were quickly set to return for the second film, Miller left the project in October 2016 due to creative differences with Reynolds and was soon replaced by Leitch. An extensive casting search took place to fill the role of Cable, with Brolin ultimately cast. Filming took place in [[British Columbia]], Canada, from June to October 2017. During filming, stunt woman [[Joi Harris|Joi "SJ" Harris]] died in a motorcycle accident; the film is dedicated to her memory. The film's score is the first to receive a parental advisory warning for explicit content, and the soundtrack also includes the original song "[[Ashes (Celine Dion song)|Ashes]]" by [[Céline Dion]].

''Deadpool 2'' was released in the United States on May 18, 2018. It has grossed over $734&amp;nbsp;million worldwide, becoming the [[2018 in film#Highest-grossing films|seventh highest-grossing film of 2018]], as well as the third highest-grossing [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|R-rated]] film and the third highest-grossing ''X-Men'' film. It received positive reviews from critics, who praised its humor, acting (particularly Reynolds, Brolin, and Beetz's performances), story, and action sequences, with some calling it better than the first film, although a feeling of cynicism drew some criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Deadpool 2: What the critics thought|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-44124176|website=BBC News|accessdate=May 15, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/heat-vision/deadpool-2-review-roundup-1111775|title='Deadpool 2': What Critics Are Saying|publisher=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|author=Katie Kilkenny|date=May 14, 2018|accessdate=May 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; An extended edition was released in August 2018, and a re-cut, [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|PG-13]] version of the film titled ''Once Upon a Deadpool'' will be released theatrically in December 2018. A sequel, ''Deadpool 3'', is in development.

==Plot==
&lt;!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for feature films should be between 400 and 700 words. --&gt;
After successfully working as the mercenary [[Deadpool]] for two years, Wade Wilson fails to kill one of his targets on his anniversary with [[Copycat (Marvel Comics)|Vanessa]], his girlfriend. That night, after the pair decide to start a family together, the target tracks Wilson down and kills Vanessa. Wilson kills the man in revenge. He blames himself for her death and attempts to commit suicide six weeks later by blowing himself up. Wilson has a vision of Vanessa in the afterlife, but the pieces of his body remain alive and are put back together by [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]]. Wilson is left with only a [[Skee-Ball]] token, an anniversary gift, as a final memento of Vanessa.

Recovering at the [[X-Mansion]], Wilson reluctantly agrees to join the [[X-Men]] as a form of healing. He, Colossus, and [[Negasonic Teenage Warhead]] respond to a standoff between authorities and the unstable young mutant [[Rusty Collins|Russell Collins / Firefist]] at an orphanage, labeled a "Mutant Reeducation Center". Wilson realizes that Collins has been abused by the orphanage staff, and kills one of the staff members. Colossus stops him from killing anyone else, and both Wilson and Collins are arrested. Restrained with collars that suppress their powers, they are taken to the Ice Box, an isolated prison for mutant criminals. Meanwhile, [[Cable (comics)|Cable]]—a cybernetic soldier from the future whose family is murdered by an older Collins—travels back in time to kill Collins before he ever becomes a killer.

Cable breaks into the Ice Box and attacks Collins. Wilson, whose collar breaks in the ensuing melee, attempts to defend Collins. After Cable takes Vanessa's token, Wilson forces himself and Cable out of the prison, but not before Collins overhears Wilson deny that he cares for the young mutant. Near death again, Wilson has another vision of Vanessa in which she convinces him to help Collins. Wilson organizes a team called [[X-Force]] to break Collins out of a prison-transfer convoy and defend him from Cable. The team launches its assault on the convoy by parachute, but all of the members die during the landing except for Wilson and the lucky [[Domino (comics)|Domino]]. While they fight Cable, Collins frees fellow inmate [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]], who agrees to help Collins kill the abusive orphanage headmaster. Juggernaut destroys the convoy, allowing himself and Collins to escape.

Cable offers to work with Wilson and Domino to stop Collins' first murder, and agrees to give Wilson a chance to talk Collins down. At the orphanage, they are overpowered by Juggernaut while Collins attacks the headmaster, until Colossus—who had at first refused to help Wilson due to Wilson's murderous ways—arrives to distract Juggernaut. When Wilson fails to talk down Collins, Cable shoots at the young mutant. Wilson leaps in front of the bullet while wearing the Ice Box collar and dies, reuniting with Vanessa in the afterlife. Seeing this sacrifice, Collins does not kill the headmaster; this changes the future so that Cable's family now survives. Cable uses the last charge on his time-traveling device, which he needed for returning to his family, to go back several minutes and strap Vanessa's token in front of Wilson's heart. Now when Wilson takes the bullet for Collins, it is stopped by the token and both survive while Collins still has his change of heart. Afterwards, the headmaster is run over by Wilson's taxi-driver friend Dopinder.

In a [[Post-credits scene|mid-credits sequence]], Negasonic Teenage Warhead and her girlfriend [[Yukio (comics)|Yukio]] repair Cable's time-traveling device for Wilson. He uses it to save the lives of Vanessa and X-Force member Peter, and kills both ''[[X-Men Origins: Wolverine]]''{{'}}s version of Deadpool and actor [[Ryan Reynolds]] while he is considering starring in the film ''[[Green Lantern (film)|Green Lantern]]''.&lt;!-- WP:FILMPLOT, please do not add details not included in Theatrical release version. --&gt;

* [[Ryan Reynolds]] as [[Deadpool|Wade Wilson / Deadpool]]: {{Cast list break|A wisecracking mercenary with accelerated healing but severe scarring over his body after undergoing an experimental regenerative mutation.&lt;ref name="GreenLight" /&gt; He forms the X-Force, a team of mutants,&lt;ref name="OfficialTrailerBreakdown" /&gt; after finding himself at his "lowest point" at the beginning of the film.&lt;ref name="Fridging" /&gt; The film makes several references to Deadpool's [[pansexuality]] after the first film was criticized for ignoring it.&lt;ref name="LGBTQ" /&gt; As a co-writer on the film, Reynolds ad-libbed much of his dialogue throughout the production process.&lt;ref name="BatesTHRMay2018" /&gt; For the film's mid-credits sequence, [[archive footage]] of Reynolds portraying Deadpool in ''[[X-Men Origins: Wolverine]]'' is used, and Reynolds also portrays himself before he acted in the film ''Green Lantern''.&lt;ref name="MidCredits" /&gt;}}
* [[Josh Brolin]] as [[Cable (comics)|Cable]]: {{Cast list break|A [[Time travel in fiction|time-traveling]] cybernetic soldier, "in many ways the opposite of Deadpool".&lt;ref name="Brolin" /&gt; Director [[David Leitch (director)|David Leitch]] called the dynamic between Cable and Deadpool "sort of classic buddy-cop fare", and compared them to the characters portrayed by [[Nick Nolte]] and [[Eddie Murphy]], respectively, in ''[[48 Hrs.]]'' (1982).&lt;ref name="LeitchFandangoApr2018" /&gt; Leitch added that the character as written in the script was mostly just an "action character", and he relied on Brolin to add nuance to the role and explore the character's internal pain to avoid it becoming a caricature.&lt;ref name="LeitchTHRMay2018" /&gt; Brolin signed a four-film deal to play the character,&lt;ref name="Brolin" /&gt; and described his appearance here as just the introduction for the character, with "three more movies to reveal more".&lt;ref name="BrolinOct2017" /&gt;}}
* [[Morena Baccarin]] as [[Copycat (Marvel Comics)|Vanessa]]: {{Cast list break|Wilson's fiancée.&lt;ref name="Baccarin" /&gt; The character is killed at the beginning of the film in an example of "[[women in refrigerators|fridging]]"—the killing of a female character to forward the development of a male character. This happens to Cable's wife and daughter as motivation for his story arc as well. Leitch and the writers said they were unaware of the term "fridging", and that they were not being "consciously sexist". Earlier versions of the film simply had Vanessa breaking up with Wilson, but the writers wanted to use the opportunity to "engender great suffering for him by having his line of work be the thing that costs Vanessa her life". They were also more comfortable with the deaths due to the increased number of strong female characters in the film, and because the deaths are reversed by the end of the film with time travel; screenwriter [[Rhett Reese]] stated, "Maybe that's a sexist thing. I don't know. And maybe some women will have an issue with that. I don't know. I don't think that that'll be a large concern, but it didn't even really occur to us."&lt;ref name="Fridging" /&gt; Baccarin said she trusted the storyline was necessary for the film, and emphasized the fact that Vanessa is saved at the end of the film.&lt;ref name="BaccarinPremiereTHR" /&gt;}}
* [[Julian Dennison]] as [[Rusty Collins|Russell Collins / Firefist]]: {{Cast list break|A young mutant with pyrokinesis who is being hunted by Cable.&lt;ref name="Dennison" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Firefist" /&gt; Reynolds insisted on casting Dennison after seeing him in ''[[Hunt for the Wilderpeople]]'' (2016),&lt;ref name="Firefist" /&gt; with the character "tailor-made" for him, and no other actors considered for the role.&lt;ref name="LeitchFandangoApr2018" /&gt; The character is considered a villain for much of the film,&lt;ref name="Juggernaut" /&gt; which Leitch thought was an "interesting take on the whole angle of the villain".&lt;ref name="LeitchFandangoApr2018" /&gt; Dennison felt the role was particularly special because, being "chubby", he would watch superhero films and "never see anyone like me. I am excited to be that for other kids who look like me."&lt;ref name="DennisonRepresentation" /&gt; [[Sala Baker]] portrays an older Firefist, in Cable's future.&lt;ref name="Baker" /&gt;}}
* [[Zazie Beetz]] as [[Domino (comics)|Domino]]: {{Cast list break|A mercenary with the mutant ability to manipulate [[luck]],&lt;ref name="Beetz" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DominoCasting" /&gt; who joins Deadpool's X-Force team.&lt;ref name="Tan" /&gt; Leitch described the film's version of the character as Beetz' own "real fun interesting take",&lt;ref name="LeitchFandangoApr2018" /&gt; with the actress interpreting the character as an only child who forms a "sibling sort of relationship" with Deadpool, with "that back-and-forth banter where she is not dealing with his".&lt;ref name="TheStarWomen" /&gt; Beetz began "working out everyday" when she got the role, which required her to shoot guns and use "full body" physicality,&lt;ref name="BeetzMay2017" /&gt; and chose not to shave her armpits to match the changing perception of the practice among the general public and to prove that it is "not something that is gross or shameful".&lt;ref name="BeetzArmpits" /&gt;}}
* [[T.J. Miller]] as [[Weasel (Marvel Comics)|Weasel]]: Wilson's best friend and the owner of a bar frequented by mercenaries.&lt;ref name="TJMiller" /&gt;
* [[Brianna Hildebrand]] as [[Negasonic Teenage Warhead]]: {{Cast list break|A teenage [[X-Men|X-Man]] with the mutant power to detonate atomic bursts from her body,&lt;ref name="KapicicHildebrand" /&gt; she is now a "new level of X-Men" after being a trainee in the first film.&lt;ref name="LiefeldKapicicTeaser" /&gt; Hildebrand felt that "it's cool that she's grown and matured and she still has so much of this essence of a punk kid" from the first film, and added that the character would have a "cooler" costume in the sequel.&lt;ref name="HildebrandMar2017" /&gt; The filmmakers intended to have Hildebrand shave her head to indicate that her abilities burned off her hair, but she was unable to do so due to a television series commitment.&lt;ref name="HildebrandFandomMay2018" /&gt; The film also reveals that Negasonic is in a same-sex relationship, which is the first openly [[LGBTQ]] relationship depicted in a Marvel film.&lt;ref name="LGBTQ" /&gt; When Reynolds asked Hildebrand how she felt about the potential storyline during development, the actress—a member of the LGBTQ community herself—responded positively with the stipulation that the film not make "a big deal" about the relationship.&lt;ref name="HildebrandTooFabMay2018" /&gt; In a statement, [[GLAAD]] President and CEO [[Sarah Kate Ellis]] praised the relationship as "a milestone in a genre that too often renders LGBTQ people invisible, and should send a message to other studios to follow this example of inclusive and smart storytelling".&lt;ref name="GLAADStatement" /&gt;}}
* [[Jack Kesy]] as [[Black Tom Cassidy]]: {{Cast list break|A mutant inmate of the Ice Box with Deadpool and Firefist.&lt;ref name="Kesy" /&gt; His role was reduced from being the main antagonist, who would have acted as a "devil on Firefist's shoulder", when the writers felt there were too many antagonists and they would rather spend the money needed to portray his abilities on a character such as [[Juggernaut (comics)|Juggernaut]].&lt;ref name="ReducedBlackTom" /&gt;}}

In addition to portraying Deadpool and himself, Reynolds provided the voice for the Juggernaut. Juggernaut is credited as being voiced by "himself", and was previously portrayed by [[Vinnie Jones]] in the 2006 film ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]''. According to Reese, the creative team on ''Deadpool 2'' felt that appearance did not do justice to the character. Wanting an additional villain for the film to support Firefist for the final fight with X-Force, the writers chose Juggernaut because he is "a force of nature [who] was probably the coolest character never to be used ... in the right way".&lt;ref name="Juggernaut" /&gt; The character's face was modeled on Leitch's, with Reynolds providing [[Facial motion capture|facial capture]] and his voice.&lt;ref name="ColossusJuggernautFight" /&gt; The latter was digitally modulated to make it deeper. Reese added that the character "didn't have many lines, he's a man of few words, but he's a man of great anger and forcefulness".&lt;ref name="Juggernaut" /&gt;

[[Stefan Kapičić]] voices [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]], an X-Man with the mutant ability to transform his entire body into organic steel.&lt;ref name="KapicicHildebrand" /&gt; Kapičić described Colossus as one of the most important characters in the film, requiring a more intense process for Kapičić during recording for the character.

Reprising their roles as the X-Men for a brief appearance are [[James McAvoy]] as [[Professor X]], [[Nicholas Hoult]] as [[Beast (comics)|Beast]], [[Evan Peters]] as [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]], [[Tye Sheridan]] as [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]], [[Alexandra Shipp]] as [[Storm (Marvel Comics)|Storm]], and [[Kodi Smit-McPhee]] as [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]].&lt;ref name="X-MenCameos" /&gt;&lt;ref name="X-MenCameosList" /&gt; Archive footage of [[Hugh Jackman]] as [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] from ''X-Men Origins: Wolverine'' is used in the mid-credits sequence, with Jackman's permission.

This was inspired by a real manifesto written by Reese, which the writers wanted to be discussed in the film by a certain "calibre" of actor: the characters are portrayed by [[Alan Tudyk]] and a disguised [[Matt Damon]], with the latter credited as "Dickie Greenleaf" (a reference to the 1999 film ''[[The Talented Mr. Ripley (film)|The Talented Mr. Ripley]]'' in which Damon stars).&lt;ref name="RTCameos" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Damon" /&gt; Leitch and writers Reese and [[Paul Wernick]] respectively cameo as Ice Box inmate "Ground Chuck Mutant", a news helicopter pilot, and a news cameraman.&lt;ref name="RTCameos" /&gt; [[Stan Lee]] was unable to cameo in the sequel, as he did in the first film and the short ''[[No Good Deed (2017 film)|No Good Deed]]'', but his likeness was used for a [[Bust (sculpture)|bust]] in the X-Mansion and for graffiti on a wall.&lt;ref name="WritersTHRMay2018" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LeitchColliderMay2018" /&gt;

==Production==
===Development===
Producer [[Simon Kinberg]] revealed in September 2015 that discussions had begun regarding ideas for a sequel to ''[[Deadpool (film)|Deadpool]]'', which was set to be released in February 2016. One idea was for the film to introduce the character [[Cable (comics)|Cable]], who had previously been looked at to appear in the first ''Deadpool'', and ''[[X-Men: Days of Future Past]]'' (2014) before that.&lt;ref name="KinbergColliderSep2015" /&gt; Cable's inclusion in the potential sequel was confirmed by the character Deadpool while breaking the [[fourth wall]] in the [[post-credit scene]] of the first film. [[Domino (comics)|Domino]], a character with connections to Cable in the comics, was also believed to be featured in the sequel.&lt;ref name="DominoRumor" /&gt; By the first film's release, [[20th Century Fox]] had green-lit a sequel, with writers [[Rhett Reese]] and [[Paul Wernick]] returning to write the screenplay. Though director [[Tim Miller (director)|Tim Miller]] and producer/star [[Ryan Reynolds]] were not confirmed for the sequel at the time, Fox was "intent on keeping the creative team together".&lt;ref name="GreenLight" /&gt; Miller and Reynolds' involvement was confirmed at the 2016 CinemaCon that April,&lt;ref name="CinemaCon2016" /&gt; though Miller had still not formally signed on to direct the sequel. He began work developing the script with the writers, while Reynolds had signed a new contract granting him "casting approval and other creative controls".&lt;ref name="MillerExit2" /&gt;

{{quote box|width=33%|align=right|quote=It has to tonally and stylistically be as fresh and original [as the first film]. That's a big challenge especially because they had 10 years to gestate on the first movie and we don't have that kind of time on the second movie. That's the biggest mandate [for the sequel] ... we have to resist the temptation to make it bigger.|source=—Producer Simon Kinberg on approaching ''Deadpool 2''&lt;ref name="EWDec2016" /&gt;}}
In June 2016, Kinberg expected filming to begin at the beginning of 2017.&lt;ref name="KinbergColliderJun2016" /&gt; By August, [[Kyle Chandler]] was believed to be in the running to portray Cable.&lt;ref name="Chandler" /&gt; Testing of actresses for Domino had also begun by October, with the shortlist of actresses under consideration including [[Lizzy Caplan]], [[Mary Elizabeth Winstead]], [[Sienna Miller]], [[Sofia Boutella]], [[Stephanie Sigman]], [[Sylvia Hoeks]], [[Mackenzie Davis]], [[Ruby Rose]], [[Eve Hewson]], and [[Kelly Rohrbach]].&lt;ref name="DominoCasting" /&gt; The producers were particularly interested in casting a black or Latina actress in the role.&lt;ref name="Beetz" /&gt;

At the end of October, Miller left the film over "mutual creative differences" with Reynolds,&lt;ref name="MillerExit" /&gt; reportedly based on several factors, including Reynolds' expanded creative control over the sequel; Miller's wish for a more stylized follow-up than the first film, versus Reynolds' focus "on the raunchy comedy style that earned the first movie its R rating"; and Miller's intention to cast Chandler as Cable, which Reynolds opposed. Fox ultimately backed "its marketable star" over Miller, who had made his [[directorial debut]] with the first film.&lt;ref name="MillerExit2" /&gt; Miller denied this report,&lt;ref name="MillerResponse" /&gt; while Reynolds said he could only add that "I'm sad to see him off the film. Tim's brilliant and nobody worked harder on ''Deadpool'' than he did."&lt;ref name="ReynoldsResponseMiller" /&gt; A week after Miller's departure, Fox was looking at [[David Leitch (director)|David Leitch]], [[Drew Goddard]], Magnus Martens, and [[Rupert Sanders]] as potential replacements for the director.&lt;ref name="DeadlineOct2016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LeitchConfirmed" /&gt; Leitch was the "strong frontrunner" for the role,&lt;ref name="MashableLeitch" /&gt; and signed on a month later.&lt;ref name="LeitchConfirmed" /&gt; Reynolds, a fan of Leitch's ''[[John Wick (film)|John Wick]]'', said the director "really understands those ''Deadpool'' sensibilities and where we need to take the franchise", and "can make a movie on an ultra tight minimal budget look like it was shot for 10–15 times what it cost".&lt;ref name="EWDec2016" /&gt;

=== Writing ===
The first completed draft from Wernick and Reese was expected around June 2016;&lt;ref name="KinbergColliderJun2016" /&gt; multiple had been completed by January 2017.&lt;ref name="ReeseWernickJan2017" /&gt; The pair felt a responsibility to explore the team [[X-Force]], which includes Deadpool, Cable, and Domino in the comics, but to also keep the film focused on Deadpool.&lt;ref name="ReeseWernickJan2017XForce" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ReeseWernickJan2017" /&gt; By the next month, the studio was still not happy with the script, with Reynolds and the writers "bunkered down ... trying to cross the finish line and create something everyone is excited to make". Goddard joined them as a consultant.&lt;ref name="Goddard" /&gt; Reese, Wernick, and Reynolds were credited for the script, the three having split the film's scenes between them before passing them around to be re-written by the others. Reese felt they were able to maintain "one voice" because of their long history with the character during development on the first film.&lt;ref name="WritersTHRMay2018" /&gt;

''Deadpool 2'' is set "more or less" when the first film ends, and focuses on "an existential crisis and a deeply personal cause" for Deadpool. Leitch felt that retaining these personal stakes was more compelling for audiences than trying to build the film around global stakes.&lt;ref name="NYTMay2018" /&gt; The writers felt that the sequel was tonally similar to the first film, but wanted to explore a different theme by focusing on a group of individuals (X-Force) and their need for family,&lt;ref name="UproxxWritersMay2018" /&gt; with Reynolds explaining that "the first movie is a love story masquerading as a comic-book movie, and this one is kind of a family film masquerading as a comic-book film again." Deadpool spends around half of the film unmasked, which the writers wanted for exploring the more emotional scenes, though Reynolds was reluctant to do this because he found the make-up required to portray an unmasked Deadpool "time consuming and really uncomfortable".&lt;ref name="WritersTHRMay2018" /&gt; An early idea was to have the film begin five years after the first and explore Deadpool being a father, but the writers quickly decided that this was "never, ever going to work" and reworked the idea to explore the character wanting to have a child but being unable to.&lt;ref name="ReynoldsEWDad" /&gt;

Earlier versions of the script included prominent roles for the characters [[Black Tom Cassidy]] and Sluggo, but they ultimately had a supporting role and a brief appearance, respectively. The villain [[Mister X (Marvel Comics)|Mr. X]] was also included in early drafts, but was cut due to the number of villains already in the film. The mutant inmates of the Ice Box were going to be explored more by having Cable breaking into the prison cause their power dampening collars to malfunction. This was removed from the script due to not being feasible within the film's budget.&lt;ref name="CutMutants" /&gt; Leitch fought to include more aspects of Cable's backstory in the film after the writers chose to mostly ignore it due to it being convoluted;&lt;ref name="Leitch/FilmMay20182" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ReeseWernickJan2017Cable" /&gt; a painting of [[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)|Cyclops]] which would have acknowledged that character as Cable's father was ultimately cut, but the Techno-Organic Virus that Cable is inflicted with and his daughter [[Hope Summers (comics)|Hope]] are depicted.&lt;ref name="Leitch/FilmMay20182" /&gt; The film features contradictory connections to the various films of the franchise, which Leitch acknowledged as confusing but said that the issue had not really been discussed during development since the ''Deadpool'' films are considered their own "entity" in a way, and the character of Deadpool allows them to be "flexible with the timeline, per se".&lt;ref name="LeitchTimeline" /&gt;

Reese and Wernick preferred to use jokes in the film that only certain members of the audience would understand, though Reynolds would not allow some to be used if he thought not enough people would enjoy them (including a reference to golfer [[Davis Love III]]).&lt;ref name="UproxxWritersMay2018" /&gt; Following the announcement of the [[proposed acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney]] in December 2017, the film includes several Disney related jokes including a [[running gag]] about the Disney film ''[[Frozen (2013 film)|Frozen]]'' (2013). However, Fox did make the producers remove a joke from the film that directly acknowledged the deal, which Reynolds said "was a wise decision".&lt;ref name="DisneyJokes" /&gt; Other cut jokes included many "bizarre" characters interviewing to join the X-Force, such as an idea to have [[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]] reprise his role as the [[Human Torch]] from the ''[[Fantastic Four (2005 film)|Fantastic Four]]'' films.&lt;ref name="UproxxWritersMay2018" /&gt;

===Pre-production===
Reese and Wernick confirmed in January 2017 that [[Stefan Kapičić]]'s [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]], [[Brianna Hildebrand]]'s [[Negasonic Teenage Warhead]], and [[Karan Soni]]'s Dopinder would be returning from the first film to "make at least an appearance".&lt;ref name="KapicicHildebrand" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Soni" /&gt; By the beginning of March 2017, [[Michael Shannon]] had been in the running to portray Cable, but no longer could due to a scheduling conflict.&lt;ref name="ShannonCollider" /&gt; [[David Harbour]] had screen-tested for the role,&lt;ref name="Harbour" /&gt; and [[Pierce Brosnan]] was believed to be in negotiations for a part in the film, potentially Cable.&lt;ref name="Brosnan" /&gt; Reynolds announced shortly after that [[Zazie Beetz]] had been cast as Domino.&lt;ref name="Beetz" /&gt; Shannon was in the running to portray Cable again later in the month, and was considered the frontrunner ahead of a shortlist that also included Harbour.&lt;ref name="ShannonFrontrunner" /&gt; [[Brad Pitt]] was also considered for the role, but had "moved on".&lt;ref name="Pitt" /&gt; Leitch soon addressed the potential casting of these actors, saying Shannon "would make an incredible Cable ... If that happens, I would be through the roof";&lt;ref name="LeitchShannon" /&gt; and on Pitt, "We had a great meeting with Brad, he was incredibly interested in the property. Things didn't work out schedule-wise [but] I think he would've made an amazing Cable."&lt;ref name="LeitchPitt" /&gt; At the end of March, [[Morena Baccarin]] confirmed her return from the first film as [[Copycat (Marvel Comics)|Vanessa]], and expressed interest in exploring the character's Copycat persona from the comics in the sequel.&lt;ref name="Baccarin" /&gt; [[Josh Brolin]] emerged as a "surprise contender" to play Cable in April, ahead of Shannon and Harbour, and was officially cast in the role. Brolin also portrays the [[Marvel Comics]] character [[Thanos]], in the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]].&lt;ref name="Brolin" /&gt;

Also in April, [[Leslie Uggams]] confirmed that she would be reprising her role of [[Blind Al]] from the first film,&lt;ref name="Uggams" /&gt; while Fox gave the sequel a June 1, 2018 release date.&lt;ref name="ReleaseDate" /&gt; Noting the release date, Leitch wanted to ensure that the film "was worthy of a summer tentpole movie, and we knew we were going to be wedged in between some big films", specifically wanting to expand the action and make the general feeling of the film "bigger" than the first one. However, he wanted the film to have the same DNA as the original "in terms of the tone, and the fun ... I love that challenge" of combining that with the increased scope. The film uses Deadpool's fourth wall-breaking to reference this release period, with Leitch calling these comments "definitely fresh and timely when they come up".&lt;ref name="LeitchFandangoApr2018" /&gt; In May 2017, Fox was reportedly looking to use a post-credits scene at the end of ''Deadpool 2'' to introduce several other members of X-Force who would go on to star alongside Reynolds, Brolin, and Beetz in an ''X-Force'' film. Casting for the characters—[[Sunspot (comics)|Sunspot]], [[Feral (comics)|Feral]], and [[Shatterstar]]—would take place over the coming months, though Reese denied the accuracy of this report.&lt;ref name="XForce3" /&gt; Later, [[T.J. Miller]] confirmed that he would return from the first film as [[Weasel (Marvel Comics)|Weasel]], and described the sequel as "even more weaselicious" than the first. He noted that Reynolds and the writers had "really put the time in on the script" to meet their own expectations for the sequel as well as those of fans.&lt;ref name="TJMiller" /&gt; [[Jack Kesy]] also joined the cast, as [[Black Tom Cassidy]].&lt;ref name="Kesy" /&gt; In June, [[Shioli Kutsuna]] was cast in a key role for the film,&lt;ref name="Kutsuna" /&gt; Negasonic Teenage Warhead's girlfriend [[Yukio (comics)|Yukio]]. The writers felt free to use the character in whatever way the film needed due to her having only a minor role in the comics.&lt;ref name="Yukio" /&gt;

===Filming===
[[File:Rivervieweastlawn.jpg|thumb|upright|Riverview Hospital in Coquitlam served as the location of the final battle.]] 
Initial filming had begun by June 17, 2017, at [[Hatley Park National Historic Site#Hatley Castle and Gardens|Hatley Castle]] in [[Victoria, British Columbia]], Canada, which is used to portray the [[X-Mansion]] in the ''X-Men'' films.&lt;ref name="HatleyFilming" /&gt; [[Principal photography]] began in [[Vancouver]], on June 26, under the [[working title]] ''Love Machine''.&lt;ref name="ProductionDates" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WorkingTitle" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sela" /&gt; The East Lawn building of [[Riverview Hospital (Coquitlam)|Riverview Hospital]] in [[Coquitlam]] served as the location for the final battle sequence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Cleugh, Janis |url=https://www.tricitynews.com/news/we-are-fully-booked-bc-housing-says-of-riverview-filming-action-1.23328358 |title=We are fully booked, BC Housing says of Riverview filming action |work=Tricitynews.com |date=June 7, 2018 |accessdate=November 26, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jonathan Sela]] served as cinematographer for the film.&lt;ref name="Sela" /&gt; At the end of June, Reynolds revealed that [[Julian Dennison]] had been cast in the film.&lt;ref name="Dennison" /&gt; The next month, T.J. Miller said that he found the sequel to be funnier than the first film, and that "it's not going to be the same movie in a different location [like ''[[The Hangover Part II]]'']. It's got different stakes, different things happen, some pretty tragic, dark shit happens in the first part of the film, in the beginning, and the rest of the film is kind of dealing with that."&lt;ref name="MillerJul2017" /&gt; By then, Kapičić had been working with Leitch on set, and expected to continue contributing to Colossus through to April 2018.&lt;ref name="KapicicJul2017" /&gt; Production on the ''X-Men'' film ''[[Dark Phoenix (film)|Dark Phoenix]]'' was taking place in [[Montreal]] concurrently with the filming of ''Deadpool 2'', with Kinberg directing that film. He directed a brief moment where the X-Men are seen through an open door in the X-Mansion, which was added to ''Deadpool 2'' with the aid of green screen to allow those characters to appear in this film.&lt;ref name="X-MenCameos" /&gt;

Leitch worked closely with Sela, the pair having previously collaborated on Leitch's earlier films, to acknowledge the aesthetic of the first film while expanding the look of the sequel to match the new situations and characters introduced. The pair created specific shot lists and plans for blocking out scenes before they arrived on set, and were very particular about the colors they used; they planned the color palette of the entire film, and also produced color wheels detailing specific palettes for each set piece. These color wheels were sometimes adjusted several days into the filming of a sequence after [[digital intermediate]] work revealed a different look than Leitch and Sela had been anticipating. Elements that were carried over from the first film included the "moodiness" and saturation of scenes set in Deadpool's apartment, and the contrast with blacks in action sequences, while Cable's future had a new aesthetic unlike anything in the first film. Another example of these color wheels was the sequence in which Firefist is introduced, with Leitch taking advantage of the scene being set during day to overemphasize the lighting and create a general sepia/orange tone that represented the fire abilities the character displays. This aesthetic met the storytelling needs of the scene as well as the practicalities of the filmmaking process.&lt;ref name="Leitch/FilmMay2018" /&gt; Because the film was shot digitally, Sela worked with Vantage Film to develop custom lenses that created the "texture and flavor" he wanted for it where he otherwise would have manipulated the exposure and development of film stock to achieve the same effect.&lt;ref name="SelaVarietyApr2018" /&gt;

[[File:Shaw Tower 2015.jpg|thumb|upright|An accident during filming on location at Shaw Tower in Vancouver caused the death of stunt woman [[Joi Harris|Joi "SJ" Harris]]]]
On August 14, stunt woman [[Joi Harris|Joi "SJ" Harris]] died in a motorcycle accident after losing control and crashing into [[Shaw Tower (Vancouver)|Shaw Tower]]. Harris, the first African-American female professional road racer, was working on the film as a stunt performer for the first time and had only joined the production a week before. Harris was not wearing a helmet because the character she was portraying, Domino, does not wear one in the scene, and there had not been time since she joined the film to create one for her to fit underneath the Domino wig. She had two full days of rehearsing the stunt as well as five more attempts on the day of the accident.&lt;ref name="StuntWomanDeath" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ProductionRestart" /&gt; Veteran stunt double Melissa Stubbs had been available and willing to do the stunt, but the inexperienced Harris was preferred due to her skin color being a match for Beetz. This decision was criticized by multiple stunt professionals, with many noting that Harris' experiences racing motorcycles did not necessarily qualify her as an able stunt performer.&lt;ref name="HarrisTHR" /&gt; Production was shut down immediately after the incident, but resumed two days later. With this news also came reports that the film's crew were "enduring very long hours" and were "exhausted by the schedule", with the studio confirming that some days had increased from the scheduled 12–13 hours filming to over 15 hours.&lt;ref name="StuntWomanDeath" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ProductionRestart" /&gt; The film's credits includes a dedication to the stuntwoman that reads "In memory of Sequana Harris".&lt;ref name="HarrisDedication" /&gt;

Earlier in August, Reynolds revealed that [[Rob Delaney]] was at the film's set,&lt;ref name="Delaney" /&gt; and [[Eddie Marsan]] revealed later in the month that he was also on set for a role in the film.&lt;ref name="Marsan" /&gt; Filming in Vancouver was expected to last until October 6,&lt;ref name="ProductionDates" /&gt; with production on ''Deadpool 2'' being officially completed on October 14.&lt;ref name="FilmingEnds" /&gt; Discussing the film's action, having previously worked as a stunt coordinator, Leitch said that all stunts are "variations on a theme" with the same basic elements, but Deadpool allows you to "subvert those basics, and there's an expectation for a classic gag, but oops, maybe you get something else". He also felt that introducing Domino gave the film unique opportunities for action sequences taking advantage of her luck-based abilities, as well as focusing on Deadpool's healing abilities and trying to use those interestingly.&lt;ref name="LeitchFandangoApr2018" /&gt; Darrin Prescott served as second-unit director on the film,&lt;ref name="Prescott" /&gt; and Jonathan Eusebio was the stunt-coordinator for the film,&lt;ref name="Eusebio" /&gt; both having worked on ''John Wick'' previously.&lt;ref name="Prescott" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Eusebio" /&gt; Domino's abilities were envisioned as a [[Rube Goldberg machine]] "on steroids", while Deadpool allowing his arm to be broken during a fight was an example of his abilities being used.&lt;ref name="Leitch/FilmMay2018" /&gt; Unlike the first film, for which Fox was unwilling to pay for the writers to be on set,&lt;ref name="ReynoldsPayWritersD1" /&gt; the studio did pay for Reese and Wernick to be on set for the sequel. Leitch was happy for this to happen, Reynolds wanted them to be there, and it allowed the pair to continue contributing to the script and suggest new jokes and ideas throughout the filming process.&lt;ref name="WritersEsquireMay2018" /&gt;
[[Scroggins Aviation]] Mockup &amp; Effects was hired to supply a CH-47 Chinook (s/n 90-00204) in the film.  Scroggins made modification to the CH-47 and worked with SFX to rig it to a motion base (Gimbal), It would be the first time a real Chinook was placed on a motion base in a motion picture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine | work = Cinefex | date = August 2018 | issue = #160 | title = Knocking'em Dead | author = Graham Edwards | url = http://www.cinefex.com/backissues/issue160.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-production===
Fox revealed in November that the film was technically untitled at that point, and not officially known as ''Deadpool 2'' as had been assumed; the studio was temporarily referring to the film as ''The Untitled Deadpool Sequel''.&lt;ref name="Untitled" /&gt; [[T.J. Miller sexual misconduct allegations|Sexual misconduct allegations against T.J. Miller]] surfaced a month later, and by January 2018 some commentators had called for Miller to be replaced in the film in a similar manner to how [[Kevin Spacey]] was replaced by [[Christopher Plummer]] through reshoots in ''[[All the Money in the World]]'' (2017). Producer [[Lauren Shuler Donner]] addressed whether this would be possible, saying "We're in the final editing. I don't think so."&lt;ref name="RTJan2018" /&gt; Miller was later [[T.J. Miller#Amtrak bomb threat incident|arrested for calling in a false bomb threat]]; Reynolds would not comment on either issue, but stated that Miller would not be appearing in the ''[[X-Force (film)|X-Force]]'' film.&lt;ref name="NYTMay2018" /&gt; Also in January, the film's release was moved up to May 18, 2018.&lt;ref name="Jan2018ReleaseChange" /&gt;

In February 2018, [[Terry Crews]] was revealed to have a role in the film,&lt;ref name="CableTrailer" /&gt; the character Shatterstar was confirmed to be appearing,&lt;ref name="KapicicCableTrailer" /&gt; and the production returned to Vancouver for six days of reshoots under a new working title, ''Daisy''.&lt;ref name="Reshoots" /&gt;&lt;ref name="THRReshoots" /&gt; Some reports emerged by mid-March claiming that these reshoots were due to poor audience responses during test screenings of the film, and consisted of sweeping changes.&lt;ref name="ReshootReports" /&gt; However, the film was soon confirmed to be testing better than the original did, up to 98 out of 100 over three different tests (compared to a maximum score of 91 during tests of the first film). Because of this, the reshoots were adding more of the elements that audiences responded positively to, including additional material featuring Cable and Domino.&lt;ref name="ReshootReports" /&gt;&lt;ref name="THRReshoots" /&gt; [[Sam Hargrave]] joined the film as a stunt coordinator for the reshoots, trying to "breathe some new life in a couple of sequences". He highlighted a car chase which combines vehicles, actors, and green screen.&lt;ref name="Hargrave" /&gt; By the end of the month, Pitt filmed a secret cameo appearance as the ''X-Force'' team member [[Vanisher]] during two hours of filming in Los Angeles,&lt;ref name="THRReshoots" /&gt;&lt;ref name="RTCameos" /&gt; having been asked to shoot the part by Reynolds and agreeing to be paid "scale", which Reese described as the equivalent of a [[Starbucks]] coffee. This was the final photography work done for the film.&lt;ref name="PittScale" /&gt; The film's first full trailer officially titled the film ''Deadpool 2'',&lt;ref name="OfficialTrailer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="OfficialTrailerBreakdown" /&gt; and revealed that Crews was portraying [[Bedlam (comics)|Bedlam]]; confirmed that Delaney would appear, portraying Peter; and that [[Bill Skarsgård]] also had a role.&lt;ref name="OfficialTrailerBreakdown" /&gt; The film's final trailer, released a month later, confirmed that [[Lewis Tan]] would portray Shatterstar, joining Domino, Bedlam, and Peter as members of ''X-Force''.&lt;ref name="Tan" /&gt; The group also includes Skarsgård's character, revealed to be [[Zeitgeist (comics)|Zeitgeist]].&lt;ref name="Skarsgard" /&gt;

One scene that was cut from the film following test screenings was a [[post-credits scene]] featuring Deadpool travelling back in time to kill a baby [[Adolf Hitler]]. It was decided that the scene made audiences too "squeamish", which was not the feeling that the creative team wanted people to be leaving the film with.&lt;ref name="UproxxWritersMay2018" /&gt; The film originally did not have any post- or mid- credits scenes, with the Hitler scene and the film's other time-traveling mid-credits scenes shot during additional photography. The latter came about when someone suggested the time travel device be used to fix real-world mistakes like Reynolds' role in ''Green Lantern'' which the writers felt was "the funniest idea ever, and what a great idea to end the movie".&lt;ref name="ReducedBlackTom" /&gt; Additional footage of the X-Force team was shot for the film's marketing to hide the fact that the majority of the X-Force are immediately killed as a joke in the film.&lt;ref name="X-ForceExtraFootage" /&gt; Due to Deadpool's mask, the creative team was able to change the character's dialogue up to the film being officially completed; Reynolds took this opportunity to keep adding new jokes to the film as long as possible.&lt;ref name="BatesTHRMay2018" /&gt;

Visual effects for the characters of Colossus and Juggernaut were provided by [[Framestore]]. The model for Colossus was altered from the first film to make him more "chiseled and angular", and his movements were based on motion capture done by [[Andre Tricoteux]] on set. Tricoteux wore several metallic pieces, including a helmet and chest piece, as reference. Kapičić provided the character's facial performance. The character's "iconic metal ridges" were live textured by animators for the first film, but Framestore changed this to use a combination of shape movement and distortion so they could be more precise with the geometry of the lines. Juggernaut was represented on set by a {{convert|6|ft|8|in|m}} stand-in, who wore a helmet extension to match the character's {{convert|9|ft|6|in|m}} height. A full scale replica of the character's metal helmet was built for interacting with stunts on set, but the final version was completely digital along with the rest of the character. Framestore animators found it challenging to move the helmet in a way that the character could still move his head underneath it, and studied the movement of [[bodybuilders]] for the character. Juggernaut's face was modeled on Leitch's, and Reynolds provided facial capture for the character, but this was modified during the animation process. For the final fight between the two characters, two stuntmen who matched the height difference between the two were filmed on a motion capture stage for reference; this footage was edited into a [[previsualization]].&lt;ref name="ColossusJuggernautFight" /&gt;

==Music==
{{main|Deadpool 2 (soundtrack)}}
[[Junkie XL]] chose not to return for ''Deadpool 2'' after composing the score for the first film, given that Miller was "the driving force behind" him working on that film in the first place.&lt;ref name="JunkieXL"/&gt; In October 2017, it was confirmed that [[Tyler Bates]] would be writing the score for ''Deadpool 2'' after doing the same for Leitch's previous films.&lt;ref name="Bates"/&gt; Bates approached the music with a slight [[Rock music|rock]] sensibility,&lt;ref name="BatesTHRMay2018" /&gt; and used a distorted guitar run through a [[wah-wah pedal]], microsynths to add "unique colors", and a choir.&lt;ref name="BatesTHRMay2018" /&gt; The choir originally sings lyrics such as "you can't stop this motherfucker" and "holy shit balls!", which ultimately earned the score a parental advisory warning. It is the first score album to receive such a warning. Bates felt this was not "merit-less debauchery, it was just fun. It's very rare that we can work on something at such a high professional level that embraces the irreverence of Deadpool."&lt;ref name="ScoreParentalAdvisory" /&gt;

Leitch wanted to create an original song for the film that served as an emotional through-line for all of the film's characters; the song "[[Ashes (Celine Dion song)|Ashes]]" was ultimately produced, as recorded by [[Céline Dion]]. Leitch directed a music video to go with the release of the song, and Reynolds both wanted to produce a music video to accompany the song; Leitch was initially conflicted about this, as he wanted audiences to discover the song,&lt;ref name="EWAshesBreakdown" /&gt; which was filmed in [[The Colosseum at Caesars Palace]].&lt;ref name="AshesFilmingLocation" /&gt; It features dancer [[Yanis Marshall]] performing as Deadpool in high heels while Dion sings the song.&lt;ref name="Marshall" /&gt; The song was released as a single with the music video on May 3, 2018,&lt;ref name="AshesRelease" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EWAshesBreakdown" /&gt; before [[Sony Classical Records]] released a score album on May 11,&lt;ref name="ScoreParentalAdvisory" /&gt; and [[Columbia Records]] released an album featuring the songs from the film—including "Ashes"—on May 18.&lt;ref name="SoundtrackRelease" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SoundtrackReleaseDate" /&gt;

==Marketing==
For the Fox presentation at CineEurope 2017 in June, Reynolds made a video message featuring himself in costume as Deadpool from the film's set.&lt;ref name="CineEurope2017" /&gt; The first teaser poster, which pays homage to [[Norman Rockwell]]'s 1943 painting ''[[Freedom from Want (painting)|Freedom from Want]]'', was released that November. Justin Carter of [[Comic Book Resources]] found it "oddly appropriate for ''Deadpool 2'' to co-opt [this] iconic work for a modern pop culture audience" as it is "true to Deadpool's incredibly referential nature".&lt;ref name="CBRTeaserPoster" /&gt; Eric Diaz of [[Nerdist Industries|Nerdist]] said, "It strikes exactly the irreverent tone you'd expect for the ''Deadpool'' sequel."&lt;ref name="NerdistTeaserPoster" /&gt; The first footage from the film debuted the following week, at the end of a video where Reynolds (in-character as Deadpool) parodies [[Bob Ross]] and his television show ''[[The Joy of Painting]]''.&lt;ref name="VergeTeaser" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LiefeldKapicicTeaser" /&gt; The video was described by ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]''{{'}}s Ryan Parker as "completely out of left field" and setting the tone perfectly for the film, though his colleague Graeme McMillan was less positive due to not knowing of Ross (''Deadpool'' co-creator [[Fabian Nicieza]] thought the fact that many in the audience wouldn't know of Ross made the video "exactly the kind of quirky pop culture choice that works perfectly for ''Deadpool''"). Parker added, "This trailer only showed a few seconds from the film, but fans will be talking about it all day" because of the presentation, unlike "any other trailer which would have shown so little of the product".&lt;ref name="THRTeaser" /&gt;

Rather than pay for an expensive advertisement spot during [[Super Bowl LII]], the film's official [[Twitter]] account was used to "live tweet" the event with in-character commentary from Deadpool.&lt;ref name="SuperBowl" /&gt; A new trailer for the film was released later that week, focusing on introducing Cable. Parker felt that "Reynolds and company have completely changed the trailer game. The formula of just showing some of the actual movie, but with a tiny story thrown in is such an incredible marketing idea." McMillan and their colleague Aaron Couch praised the trailer playing on the visual effects for Cable's arm not being finished, noting it as a joke about the visual effects to remove [[Henry Cavill]]'s mustache from ''[[Justice League (film)|Justice League]]''. The group collectively praised the overall marketing for the franchise, with McMillan suggesting that the campaign for the sequel may surpass that of the first ''Deadpool''.&lt;ref name="CableTrailer" /&gt; A full trailer for the film, explaining its general plot, was released at the end of March. ''[[Forbes]]'' contributor Scott Mendelson called it "pretty funny and mostly entertaining", but was disappointed in it being a "conventional" trailer compared to the more out-there videos previously released for the film. He explained that he thought the first film "had a winning lead character and fine character-centric jokes, but a pretty generic origin story plot that eventually became the thing it was critiquing", and was concerned that the sequel would turn out to be "a more standard 'superhero sequel' sell". Mendelson also noted the inclusion of T.J. Miller in the trailer following the reveal of sexual misconduct allegations against the actor in late 2017, calling it "inevitable no matter how tarnished his reputation might be these days".&lt;ref name="OfficialTrailerForbes" /&gt; The ''Hollywood Reporter'' group also noted the more traditional style of the trailer, but remained generally positive about the film and highlighted the supporting cast for the film as appearing in the trailer, including Brolin, Beetz, Kutsuna, and Crews.&lt;ref name="OfficialTrailerTHR" /&gt;

Also in March, a Twitter account was established for the character Peter and began to be regularly updated with tweets about his interests, including photos of the character [[beekeeping]] and preparing for his role in the ''X-Force'' team (as seen in the film).&lt;ref name="PeterTwitter" /&gt;&lt;ref name="io9PeterTwitter" /&gt; A month later, Fox released the final trailer for the film, with Mendelson lamenting that it was as "conventional" as the previous trailer but finding it understandable that Fox not be seen to be hiding the film, and ultimately felt that the trailer indicated the film would be "a pretty solid comic book sequel".&lt;ref name="FinalTrailerForbes" /&gt; The group at ''The Hollywood Reporter'' praised the final trailer as well, highlighting its references to ''[[X-Men Origins: Wolverine]]'' and the [[DC Extended Universe|DC universe]] as well as its introduction of Peter.&lt;ref name="FinalTrailerTHR" /&gt; At the end of April, Leitch stated that alternate versions of jokes that had been cut from the film were included in the trailers, since "only one can live in the movie, so we might have snuck a couple in sort of additional materials that people can discover."&lt;ref name="LeitchFandangoApr2018" /&gt; As part of a promotion for the film with beverage company Mike's Harder, the Sister Margaret's School for Wayward Girls fictional bar from the film was emulated in pop-ups at the Alligator Lounge in New York from April 26 through 28, and the Slipper Clutch in Los Angeles from May 10 through 12. The pop-ups respectively served pizza and [[chimichanga]]s, traditionally Deadpool's favorite food, as well as ''Deadpool''-inspired Harder drinks. The campaign also included the chance to win a trip to the film's premiere through Harder, and the Los Angeles pop-up benefitted the nonprofit DTLA Film Festival.&lt;ref name="HarderPromotion" /&gt;

==Release==
===Theatrical===
====Initial====
''Deadpool 2'' premiered at [[Empire, Leicester Square|Leicester Square]] in [[London]] on May 10, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-5716721/Ryan-Reynolds-cast-Deadpool-2-ooze-movie-star-glamour-London-premiere-Marvel-film.html|title=Ryan Reynolds and the cast of Deadpool 2 ooze movie star glamour for London premiere of Marvel film|work=[[DailyMail]]|date=May 11, 2018|accessdate=May 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was released in the United States on May 18, 2018, having been previously scheduled for release on June 1 of that year.&lt;ref name="ReleaseDate" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Untitled" /&gt;

====Extended edition====
Leitch's initial cut of the film was around two hours and twelve minutes, with "nips and tucks" done to it to get the run time down to the final two hours. By May 2018, Leitch was working on an official extended edition of the film with Fox wanting to "spin that out as a special thing". He said it would be closer to his initial runtime and would include a cut montage of Deadpool trying to commit suicide in various ways, an extended sequence in the X-Mansion, and alternate versions of jokes that were not chosen for the film's theatrical version.&lt;ref name="ExtendedCut" /&gt; The extended cut was screened at [[San Diego Comic-Con]] 2018 at an event titled ''Deadpool 2: Uncut Screening''.&lt;ref name="Uncut" /&gt; Ahead of the screening, a panel was held at the convention moderated by Soni and featuring other cast members. Some of the scenes cut from the theatrical version of the film were debuted at the panel.&lt;ref name="SDCC2018Panel" /&gt;

====''Once Upon a Deadpool''====
At the end of September 2018, Fox announced that it would release an untitled ''Deadpool'' film in theaters on December 21. The studio suggested that press and fans "guess away" as to what this new film would be, but it was believed to be a re-cut version of ''Deadpool 2'' that would carry a PG-13 rating rather than being R-rated like the initial theatrical release.&lt;ref name="PG13Cut" /&gt; Reynolds hinted that the version of the film would feature Deadpool telling the story of the film to [[Fred Savage]], parodying ''[[The Princess Bride (film)|The Princess Bride]]'' (1987) in which a young Savage was told a bedtime story by [[Peter Falk]] who avoided "the scary parts that were a bit too adult for the youngster".&lt;ref name="PrincessBrideParody" /&gt; Reese and Wernick revealed in October that the idea for the new version of the film was raised by Reynolds during a general discussion about the character following the film's initial release, and that Reynolds also suggested the framing device for the story. Reese and Wernick wrote new scenes for the new version, and Leitch returned to direct them during a single day in August.&lt;ref name="WritersPG13Oct2018" /&gt;&lt;ref name="OnceUponADeadpool" /&gt; Wernick said the version would not just be for children who were unable to watch the R-rated release, as "it's subversive enough and fun and creative and something that only ''Deadpool'' could do. So I think it's going to be a real joy for not only a whole new audience, but also an audience that has seen and loved the ''Deadpool'' movies." They added that the film's story would not change "appreciably" between versions.&lt;ref name="WritersPG13Oct2018" /&gt; The majority of the version is the same as the theatrical release, but edited to "meet PG-13 thresholds of violence and language".&lt;ref name="OnceUponADeadpool" /&gt;

Fox officially announced ''Once Upon a Deadpool'' in November, and changed the release schedule to run from December 12 to 24. The studio considered the release to be a chance of a "Christmas bonus", and it also had the potential to be released in China unlike the R-rated version. After spending the entire development process of both ''Deadpool'' and ''Deadpool 2'' insisting to Fox that the films must be R-rated, Reynolds only agreed to support a PG-13 version of the film if a portion of the release's profit went to charity; Fox agreed to donate $1 for every ticket purchased for the film to the Fuck Cancer charity campaign, which would be temporarily renamed "Fudge Cancer" for the fundraising tie-in.&lt;ref name="OnceUponADeadpool" /&gt; At the end of November, writer and artist Michael Vincent Bramley noted that he had pitched the exact framing device that was being used for this version of the film to Reynolds on Twitter in December 2017.&lt;ref name="OUaDBramley" /&gt; Within a day, Bramley had been contacted by Reynolds to discuss the issue and said, "It seems like this may all just have been a big, insane coincidence and I'm happy to leave it at that."&lt;ref name="OUaDBramley2" /&gt;

The film was released on [[Digital copy|Digital HD]] on August 7, 2018, and physically on August 21. The latter release covered the [[Ultra HD Blu-ray|4K Ultra HD]], [[Blu-ray]], and [[DVD]] formats, including both the theatrical version and ''Super Duper $@%!#&amp; Cut'' unrated extended edition. The physical release includes an audio commentary for the theatrical version in 4K Ultra HD and Blu-ray formats, from Reynolds, Leitch, Reese, and Wernick. The Blu-ray format also includes a gag reel, deleted and extended scenes, alternate takes, featurettes on Easter eggs, the cast and characters, Leitch's directing, and the action and stunts, and more.&lt;ref name="HomeMedia" /&gt;

==Reception==
===Box office===
{{As of|2018|9|27|df=US}}, ''Deadpool 2'' has grossed $318.5&amp;nbsp;million in the United States and Canada, and $415.8&amp;nbsp;million in other territories, for a worldwide total of $734.2&amp;nbsp;million, against a production budget of $110&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="BOM" /&gt;  

On April 20, 2018, both [[Fandango (company)|Fandango]] and [[Regal Entertainment Group|Regal Cinemas]] announced that ''Deadpool 2'' was the best pre-selling R-rated film in their respective histories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2018/04/deadpool-2-advance-movie-ticket-sales-1202372824/|title='Deadpool 2' Advance Ticket Sales Records: Fandango's Best R-Rated Preseller Ever In First 24 Hours|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|publisher=[[Penske Business Media]]|date=April 20, 2018|first=Anthony|last=D'Alessandro|accessdate=April 20, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film opened in 4,332 theaters, setting the record for widest R-rated release ever (beating the 4,103 count by ''[[It (2017 film)|It]]'' in September 2017).

===Critical response===
On review aggregation website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an approval rating of 83% based on 345 reviews, with an average rating of 7/10. The website's critical consensus reads, "Though it threatens to buckle under the weight of its meta gags, ''Deadpool 2'' is a gory, gleeful lampoon of the superhero genre buoyed by Ryan Reynolds' undeniable charm."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/deadpool_2|title=Deadpool 2 (2018) |publisher=[[Fandango Media]]|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=November 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], which assigns a normalized rating to reviews, the film has a weighted average score of 66 out of 100, based on reviews from 51 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/deadpool-2|title=Deadpool 2 Reviews |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|work=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=May 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of "A" on an A+ to F scale, the same score as the first film. Audiences were 59% male and 41% female.&lt;ref name="opening" /&gt;

[[Richard Roeper]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave the film 3.5 out of 4 stars, jokingly calling it the best sequel since ''[[The Godfather Part II]]'' and saying: "''Deadpool 2'' is wicked, dark fun from start to finish, with some twisted and very funny special effects, cool production elements [and] terrific ensemble work."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Roeper |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Roeper |date=May 14, 2018 |title='Deadpool 2' a dark, gruesome delight, from start to very funny finish|url=https://chicago.suntimes.com/entertainment/deadpool-2-a-dark-gruesome-delight-from-start-to-very-funny-finish/|website=[[Chicago Sun Times]] |accessdate=May 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[PopMatters]]'' writer J.R.

It's actually a fair bit better—funnier, more inventive than the 2016 smash...and more consistent in its chosen tone and style: ultraviolent screwball comedy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Phillips |first1=Michael |authorlink=Michael Phillips (critic) |title=Ryan Reynolds takes a comic high dive into 'Deadpool 2'|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/sc-mov-deadpool-2-rev-0514-story.html |accessdate=May 14, 2018 |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |date=May 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A.O. Scott of ''[[The New York Times]]'' was critical of the cynical tone of the film, writing "something ever so slightly dishonest about this character, something false about the boundaries drawn around his sadism and his rage. Deadpool 2 dabbles in ugliness and transgression, but takes no real creative risks."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/14/movies/deadpool-2-review-ryan-reynolds.html |archive-date=May 15, 2018 |deadurl=no |archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20180515065505/https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/14/movies/deadpool-2-review-ryan-reynolds.html |title=Review: 'Deadpool 2' Has More Slicing, Dicing and Swearing from Ryan Reynolds |work=The New York Times |first=A.

==Sequel==
By November 2016, with development underway on ''Deadpool 2'', Fox was also planning ''Deadpool 3'', which was said to include the team [[X-Force]].&lt;ref name="UniversePlans" /&gt; With the confirmation that Leitch would direct ''Deadpool 2'', it was revealed that Fox was looking for a separate filmmaker to direct ''Deadpool 3''.&lt;ref name="LeitchConfirmed" /&gt; In March 2017, Reese clarified that though ''Deadpool 2'' sets-up the X-Force team, a future film focused on the team would be separate from ''Deadpool 3'', "so I think we'll be able to take two paths. [''X-Force''] is where we're launching something bigger, but then [''Deadpool 3'' is] where we're contracting and staying personal and small."&lt;ref name="ReeseMar2017" /&gt;

After the [[proposed acquisition of 21st Century Fox by Disney]] was announced in December 2017, Disney CEO [[Bob Iger]] said that Deadpool would be integrated with the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU) under Disney,&lt;ref name="DisneyFoxMCU" /&gt; and that the company would be willing to make future R-rated Deadpool films "as long as we let the audiences know what's coming".&lt;ref name="DisneyMarvelR" /&gt; In May 2018, Reynolds stated that a third Deadpool film may not be made given the franchise's shift of focus to X-Force,&lt;ref name="NoD3?" /&gt; though Reese and Wernick felt a third film would "absolutely" be happening after Reynolds took a break from the character and ''X-Force'' was released, which they compared to the ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'' franchise having ''[[Iron Man 3]]'' (2013) release after the crossover film ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]'' (2012).&lt;ref name="MidCredits" /&gt; Also, Leitch expressed interest in returning to the franchise, saying, "I would be grateful to work on something [starring Reynolds' Deadpool] again. It just depends on time and place, so we'll see what happens."&lt;ref name="LeitchDoGMay2018" /&gt;

The ''Once Upon a Deadpool'' version of the film was being watched carefully by Disney and Marvel Studios to see whether it might inform how they could approach the character and integrate him into the PG-13 MCU.&lt;ref name="OnceUponADeadpool" /&gt;

'''dig''' (''domain information groper'') is a [[Unix-like]] [[network administration]] [[command-line]] tool for querying [[Domain Name System]] (DNS) [[name server|servers]].

dig is useful for network troubleshooting and for educational purposes. dig can operate in interactive command line mode or in batch mode by reading requests from an operating system file. When a specific name server is not specified in the command invocation, it will use the operating system's default resolver, usually configured via the [[resolv.conf]] file. Without any arguments it queries the [[DNS root zone]].

dig supports [[Internationalized domain name|Internationalized Domain Name]] (IDN) queries.

dig is part of the [[BIND]] domain name server software suite. dig was initially planned to supersede older tools such as [[nslookup]] and the [[host (Unix)|host]] program; however, it has instead become a complementary tool.

==Example usage==
In this example, dig is used to query for ''any'' type of record information in the domain &lt;tt&gt;example.com&lt;/tt&gt;:

&lt;source lang="console"&gt;
$ dig example.com any
; &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; DiG 9.6.1 &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; example.com any
;; global options: +cmd
;; Got answer:
;; -&gt;&gt;HEADER&lt;&lt;- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 4016
;; flags: qr rd ra; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 4, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 0

;; QUESTION SECTION:
;example.com.                   IN      ANY

;; ANSWER SECTION:
example.com.            172719  IN      NS      a.iana-servers.net.
example.com.            172719  IN      NS      b.iana-servers.net.
example.com.            172719  IN      A       208.77.188.166
example.com.            172719  IN      SOA     dns1.icann.org. hostmaster.icann.org. 2007051703 7200 3600 1209600 86400

;; Query time: 1 msec
;; SERVER: ::1#53(::1)
;; WHEN: Wed Aug 12 11:40:43 2009
;; MSG SIZE  rcvd: 154
&lt;/source&gt;
The number 172719 in the above example represents the [[time to live]] value.

Queries may be directed to designated DNS servers for specific records; in this example, [[MX record]]s:
&lt;source lang="console"&gt;
$ dig wikimedia.org MX @ns0.wikimedia.org
; &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; DiG 9.6.1 &lt;&lt;&gt;&gt; wikimedia.org MX @ns0.wikimedia.org
;; global options: +cmd
;; Got answer:
;; -&gt;&gt;HEADER&lt;&lt;- opcode: QUERY, status: NOERROR, id: 61144
;; flags: qr aa rd; QUERY: 1, ANSWER: 2, AUTHORITY: 0, ADDITIONAL: 2
;; WARNING: recursion requested but not available

;; QUESTION SECTION:
;wikimedia.org.                 IN      MX

;; ANSWER SECTION:
wikimedia.org.          3600    IN      MX      10 mchenry.wikimedia.org.
wikimedia.org.          3600    IN      MX      50 lists.wikimedia.org.

;; ADDITIONAL SECTION:
mchenry.wikimedia.org.  3600    IN      A       208.80.152.186
lists.wikimedia.org.    3600    IN      A       91.198.174.5

;; Query time: 73 msec
;; SERVER: 208.80.152.130#53(208.80.152.130)
;; WHEN: Wed Aug 12 11:51:03 2009
;; MSG SIZE  rcvd: 109
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4600">The '''''Editio Leonina''''' or '''Leonine Edition''' is the edition of [[List of works by Thomas Aquinas|the works]] of [[Saint Thomas Aquinas]] originally sponsored by [[Pope Leo XIII]] in 1879.

The '''Leonine Commission''' (''Commissio leonina'') is the group of scholars working on the ongoing project of critically editing the works of Aquinas.  The first superintendent of the commission was [[Tommaso Maria Zigliara]], professor and rector of the ''Collegium Divi Thomae de Urbe'' (the future [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas]]). Its current seat is in Paris, ''rue de la Glacière '' and it is currently (as of 2015) chaired by friar Adriano Oliva. The editions are published with  ''editions du Cerf'', the historical Dominican publishing house in France founded in 1929 at the request of [[Pope Pius XI]].

Aquinas' main work, the ''[[Summa Theologiae]]'', was edited in nine volumes (tt.IV–XII) during 1888–1906.
As of 2014, the ''Editio Leonina'' comprises 39 volumes, representing about half of the entire scope of the project.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2903">The '''Ethnic Power Relations (EPR)''' [[dataset]] identifies all politically relevant ethnic groups, their size, and their access to state power in every country of the world with a population of at least 250,000 from 1946 to 2017. It includes annual data on over 800 groups and codes the degree to which their representatives hold executive-level state power, from total control of the government, [[Powersharing | power-sharing]] to overt political discrimination. Also, it provides information on [[regional autonomy]] arrangements.

The EPR data is maintained by researchers at the Chair of International Conflict Research at [[ETH Zurich]]. The current version of the EPR data is available in research-ready country-year and group-year format from the GROWup Research Front-End data portal.&lt;ref name=growup&gt;{{cite web |url=https://growup.ethz.ch/|title=GROWup - Geographical Research On War, Unified Platform|website=growup.ethz.ch|access-date=16 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In contrast to similar datasets, such as [[Minorities at Risk|Minorities At Risk (MAR)]], the EPR list includes minority and majority groups. The EPR data is one of the most widely used datasets on ethnic groups in [[Social Sciences]]. Google Scholar lists 1035 references to the EPR.&lt;ref&gt;Cederman, Lars-Erik, Wimmer, Andreas, &amp; Min, Brian. 2010. “[https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/world-politics/article/why-do-ethnic-groups-rebel-new-data-and-analysis/4F69AEFBD88FAADE63207FF7D1F69449 Why do ethnic groups rebel? New data and analysis].” World Politics 62(1): 87-119.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vogt, Manuel, Bormann, Nils-Christian, Rüegger, Seraina, Cederman, Lars-Erik, Hunziker, Philipp, &amp; Girardin, Luc. 2015. “[https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0022002715591215 Integrating data on ethnicity, geography, and conflict: The ethnic power relations data set family].” Journal of Conflict Resolution 59(7): 1327-1342.&lt;/ref&gt;

==EPR Dataset Family==
[[File:EPRdatasetfamily.jpg|thumb]]
In addition to ethnic power relations, the EPR dataset family includes information on ethnic groups’ settlement patterns, links to rebel organizations, transborder ethnic kin relations, ethnic [[refugee]] groups, and intraethnic cleavages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://icr.ethz.ch/data/epr|title=Ethnic Power Relations (EPR) Dataset Family |access-date=15 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Expert survey==
The EPR data is composed on the basis of an online expert survey. Nearly one hundred country and regional experts were asked to identify the ethnic categories most salient for national politics in each country.

==Background==
Fleeming and Beevers were in a de facto relationship for over 20 years. In 1989, the couple purchased a house in Queenstown, with Beevers financing his half by cashing in his superannuation policy, with Fleeming borrowing the money for her half, which needed a guarantee from Beevers to secure the loan.

During the conveyancing process, both parties promised to leave their share in the house to the other partner in their will.

Beevers never got around to drafting a new will, and a few months after buying the house, he died. Without a new will, his share of the house would have been disposed under his last will, which left everything to his three children from his previous marriage, with nothing left to Fleeming.

Fleeming sued the estate for Beevers' half share in the house, as well as for a piano that he had promised to leave her.

==Held==
The court awarded Fleming the share in the house, but not the piano.

The '''Gate of Divine Might''' or '''Gate of Divine Prowess''' ({{Zh|c=神武門|p=Shénwǔmén}}) is the northern gate of the [[Forbidden City]] in [[Beijing]], [[China]].&lt;ref name="TPM"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Zhu |first1=Qingzheng |title=神武门 |trans-title=Gate of Divine Might|url=http://www.dpm.org.cn/explore/building/236456.html |website=The Palace Museum |accessdate=5 June 2018 |language=[[Simplified Chinese characters|Simplified Chinese]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The gate was built in 1420, during the 18th year of [[Yongle Emperor]]'s reign.&lt;ref name="TPM"/&gt; The Gate was originally named "'''[[Black Tortoise (Chinese constellation)|Black Tortoise]] Gate'''" ({{zh|t=玄武門|p=Xuánwǔmén|labels=no}}), but when [[Qing Dynasty]]'s [[Kangxi Emperor]], whose birth name was Xuanye (玄燁), ascended to the throne, the use of the [[Chinese characters|Chinese character]] ''Xuan'' (玄) became a form of [[naming taboo]].&lt;ref name="TPM"/&gt;

The gate is the back gate of the palace,&lt;ref name="TPM"/&gt; and was used by palace workers.&lt;ref name="TPM"/&gt; Women being sent into the palace for selection as concubines also entered the palace through this gate.&lt;ref name="TPM"/&gt;

It is important to note that the [[Xuanwu Gate Incident]], while sharing a similar name with this gate's original name, did not take place at this gate. The palace coup happened during the [[Tang Dynasty]], when the capital was in [[Chang'an]].

The '''Golden Guides''', originally '''Golden Nature Guides''', were a series of 160-page, pocket-sized books created by [[Western Publishing]] and published under their "Golden Press" line (primarily a children's book imprint) from 1949.  Edited by [[Herbert S. Zim]] and Vera Webster, the books were written by experts in their field and illustrated in a simple straightforward style.

Intended for primary and secondary school level readers, the first books were [[field guide]]s illustrated by [[James Gordon Irving]], with such titles as ''Birds'' (1949), ''Insects'' (1951), and ''Mammals'' (1955). The series later expanded beyond identification guides to cover a wider range of subjects, such as ''Geology'' (1972), ''Scuba Diving'' (1968)'','' and ''Indian Arts'' (1970).

In 1966, Zim launched a related series, the [[Golden Field Guide]]s, aimed at high school or college-age readers.

An updated series was relaunched in 2001 as "Golden Guides by [[St. Martin's Press]]", illustrated largely with photographs but retaining some of the original 1950s illustrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://uppercasemagazine.com/issue15|title = The Golden Nature of James Gordon Irving|last = Fandrich|first = Leslie|date = Fall 2012|journal = Uppercase|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |issue = 15|pages = 46–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Great Russell Street Bloomsbury.JPG|thumb|right|Great Russell Street viewed from its junction with Bloomsbury Street]]
'''Great Russell Street''' is a street in [[Bloomsbury, London|Bloomsbury]], London, best known for being the location of the [[British Museum]]. It runs between [[Tottenham Court Road]] (part of the [[A400 road (Great Britain)|A400 route]]) in the west, and [[Southampton Row]] (part of the A4200 route) in the east. It is one-way only (eastbound) between its western origin at Tottenham Court Road and Bloomsbury Street.

The headquarters of the [[Trades Union Congress]] is located at Nos. 23-28 ([[Congress House]]). The street is also the home of the Contemporary Ceramics Centre, the gallery for the Craft Potters Association of Great Britain, as well as the [[High Commission of Barbados, London|High Commission of Barbados]] to the United Kingdom.

The '''international scale of river difficulty''' is an American system used to rate the difficulty of navigating a stretch of river, or a single (sometimes [[whitewater]]) [[rapid]].&lt;ref name="AWCODE05"&gt; {{cite web
 | url = http://www.americanwhitewater.org/content/Wiki/safety:start?#vi._international_scale_of_river_difficulty
 | title = Safety Code of American Whitewater
 | author1 = Charlie Walbridge
 | author2 = Mark Singleton
 | publisher = American Whitewater
 | year = 2005
 | accessdate = 2015-01-07
 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The scale was created by the [[American Whitewater|American Whitewater Association]] to evaluate rivers throughout the world, hence ''international'' in the title.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
It should not be confused with the internationally used whitewater scale, which is published and adapted by a committee of the [[International Canoe Federation]] ICF.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web

 | publisher = Deutscher Kanuverband
 | year = 1979
 | accessdate = 2016-04-19
}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The grade reflects the technical difficulty and skill level required associated with the section of river.  The scale is of use to various [[water sports]] and activities, such as [[rafting]], [[riverboarding]], [[whitewater canoeing]], [[stand up paddle surfing]], and [[whitewater kayaking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = North Fork Press| isbn = 9780961365042| last = Cassady| first = Jim|author2=Fryar Calhoun |author3=Bill Cross | title = Western whitewater: from the Rockies to the Pacific, a river guide for raft, kayak, and canoe| location = Berkeley, CA| year = 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
There are six categories, each referred to as "Grade" or "Class" followed by a number. The scale is not linear, nor is it fixed. For instance, there can be difficult grade twos, easy grade threes, and so on. The grade of a river may (and usually does) change with the level of flow. Often a river or [[rapid]] will be given a numerical grade, and then a plus (+) or minus (-) to indicate if it is in the higher or lower end of the difficulty level. While a river section may be given an overall grading, it may contain sections above that grade, often noted as features, or conversely, it may contain sections of lower graded water as well. Details of portages may be given if these pose specific challenges. A summary of river classifications as presented by the American Whitewater Association:&lt;ref name="AWCODE05" /&gt;

{| class="wikitable" width=80%
|-
! style="background:green;"|Class I:&lt;br /&gt;Easy
| Fast moving water with [[riffles]] and small waves. Few obstructions, all obvious and easily missed with little training. Risk to swimmers is slight; self-rescue is easy.
| [[File:Black Fork Mohican River.jpg|100px]]
|-
! style="background:yellow;"| Class II:&lt;br /&gt;Novice
| Straightforward rapids with wide, clear channels which are evident without scouting. Occasional maneuvering may be required, but rocks and medium-sized waves are easily avoided by trained paddlers. Swimmers are seldom injured and group assistance, while helpful, is seldom needed. Rapids that are at the upper end of this difficulty range are designated Class II+.
| [[File:Madawaska River Whitney.JPG|100px]]
|-
! style="background:gold;"| Class III:&lt;br /&gt;Intermediate
| Rapids with moderate, irregular waves which may be difficult to avoid and which can swamp an open canoe. Complex maneuvers in fast current and good boat control in tight passages or around ledges are often required; large waves or strainers may be present but are easily avoided. Strong eddies and powerful current effects can be found, particularly on large-volume rivers. Scouting is advisable for inexperienced parties. Injuries while swimming are rare; self-rescue is usually easy but group assistance may be required to avoid long swims. Rapids that are at the lower or upper end of this difficulty range are designated Class III- or Class III+ respectively.
| [[File:WataugaTheBigHole.jpg|100px]]
|-
! style="background:orange;"| Class IV:&lt;br /&gt;Advanced
| Intense, powerful but predictable rapids requiring precise boat handling in turbulent water. Depending on the character of the river, it may feature large, unavoidable waves and holes or constricted passages demanding fast maneuvers under pressure. A fast, reliable eddy turn may be needed to initiate maneuvers, scout rapids, or rest. Rapids may require "must make" moves above dangerous hazards. Scouting may be necessary the first time down. Risk of injury to swimmers is moderate to high, and water conditions may make self-rescue difficult. Group assistance for rescue is often essential but requires practiced skills. For kayakers, a strong [[kayak roll|roll]] is highly recommended. Rapids that are at the lower or upper end of this difficulty range are designated Class IV- or Class IV+ respectively.
| [[File:Rafting PescadosRiverClassIV VeracruzMexico.jpg|100px]]
|-
! style="background:red;"| Class V:&lt;br /&gt;Expert
| Extremely long, obstructed, or very violent rapids which expose a paddler to added risk. Drops may contain large, unavoidable waves and holes or steep, congested chutes with complex, demanding routes. Rapids may continue for long distances between pools, demanding a high level of fitness. What eddies exist may be small, turbulent, or difficult to reach. At the high end of the scale, several of these factors may be combined. Scouting is recommended but may be difficult. Swims are dangerous, and rescue is often difficult even for experts. Proper equipment, extensive experience, and practiced rescue skills are essential.

Because of the large range of difficulty that exists beyond Class IV, Class V is an open-ended, multiple-level scale designated by class 5.0, 5.1, 5.2, etc. Each of these levels is an order of magnitude more difficult than the last. That is, going from Class 5.0 to Class 5.1 is a similar order of magnitude as increasing from Class IV to Class 5.0.
| [[File:Green wall.JPG|100px]]
|-
! style="background:magenta;"| Class VI:&lt;br /&gt;Extreme and Exploratory Rapids
| Runs of this classification are rarely attempted and often exemplify the extremes of difficulty, unpredictability and danger. The consequences of errors are severe and rescue may be impossible. For teams of experts only, at favorable water levels, after close personal inspection and taking all precautions. After a Class VI rapid has been run many times, its rating may be changed to an appropriate Class 5.x rating.
| [[File:Niagara Rapids Class VI.jpg|100px]]
|}

==Caution in application==
Classifications can vary enormously, depending on the skill level and experience of the paddlers who rated the river.  For example, at the 1999 International Conference on Outdoor Recreation and Education, an author of a paddling guide pointed out that there is too much variation in what is covered by the Class I designation, and proposed making further distinctions within the Class I flat water designations and Class I+ moving water designations, with the goal of providing better information for [[canoe]]ists, instructors leading trips, and families with young children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Proposed Expanded Class I System of Rating Rivers | author= Ron Watters| url=http://www.isu.edu/outdoor/classone.htm | work=Proceedings of the 1999 International Conference on Outdoor Recreation and Education | publisher= [[Idaho State University]] | accessdate= 2010-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The grade of a river or rapid is likely to change along with the level of the water. High water usually makes rapids more difficult and dangerous, although some rapids may be easier at high flows because features are covered or washed out. At spate/[[flood stage]], even rapids which are usually easy can contain lethal and unpredictable hazards. Conversely, some rapids may be easier with lower water levels when dangerous [[Whitewater#Holes|hydraulics]] become easier to manage. Some rivers with high volumes of fast moving water may require little maneuvering, but will pose serious risk of injury or death in the event of a [[capsize]].

NOTE:

This article is about comparisons between stories, artistic depictions, and religious elements of Jesus's life and those of mythical or legendary figures from the ancient Mediterranean, including figures from Jewish mythology, made by reputable, mainstream, contemporary scholars of the ancient world, including historians of early Christianity. It is NOT about fringe theories advanced by popular writers and people on the internet, or arguments that Jesus was not a real person; those are dealt with in the article Christ myth theory. Thank you.

The [[Gospel of John]] bears indirect influences from [[Platonism]], via earlier Jewish deuterocanonical texts, and may also have been influenced in less obvious ways by the cult of [[Dionysus]], the Greek god of wine, though this possibility is still disputed.{{sfn|Salier|2004|pages=66–69}} Later [[Jesus in Christianity|Christian traditions about Jesus]] were probably influenced by [[Religion in ancient Rome|Greco-Roman religion]] and [[Classical mythology|mythology]]. Much of [[Depiction of Jesus|Jesus's traditional iconography]] is apparently derived from Mediterranean deities such as [[Hermes]], Asclepius, [[Serapis]], and [[Zeus]] and his [[Christmas|traditional birthdate on 25 December]], which was not declared as such until the fifth century, was at one point named a holiday in honor of the Roman sun god [[Sol Invictus]]. At around the same time Christianity was expanding in the second and third centuries, the [[Mithraism|Mithraic Cult]] was also flourishing. Though the relationship between the two religions is still under dispute, [[Christian apologetics|Christian apologists]] at the time noted similarities between them, which some scholars have taken as evidence of borrowing, but which are more likely a result of shared cultural environment. More general comparisons have also been made between the stories about Jesus's birth and resurrection and stories of other divine or heroic figures from across the Mediterranean world, including supposed "[[Dying-and-rising deity|dying-and-rising gods]]" such as [[Dumuzid|Tammuz]], [[Adonis]], [[Attis]], and [[Osiris]], while the concept of "dying-and-rising gods" has received criticism.

Nonetheless, most secular scholars generally agree that the gospels contain large amounts of material that is not historically accurate and is better categorized as legend.{{sfn|Ehrman|2012|pages=184–185}} In a discussion of genuinely legendary episodes from the gospels, theologian [[Bart Ehrman]] mentions the [[Nativity of Jesus|birth narratives in the Gospels of Matthew and Luke]] and the release of [[Barabbas]].{{sfn|Ehrman|2012|page=184}} He points out, however, that, just because these stories are not true does not mean that Jesus himself did not exist.{{sfn|Ehrman|2012|pages=184–185}} According to theologians Paul R. Eddy and [[Gregory A. Boyd]], there is no evidence that the portrayal of Jesus in the [[Synoptic Gospels]] (the three earliest gospels of [[Gospel of Mark|Mark]], [[Gospel of Matthew|Matthew]], and [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]]) was directly influenced by pagan mythology in any significant way.{{sfn|Eddy|Boyd|2007|pages=53–54}}&lt;ref name=Collins&gt;[[Gerald O'Collins]], "The Hidden Story of Jesus" ''New Blackfriars'' Volume 89, Issue 1024, pages 710–714, November 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest followers of Jesus were devout Palestinian Jews who abhorred paganism{{sfn|Eddy|Boyd|2007|pages=98–99}} and would have therefore been extremely unlikely to model stories about their founder on pagan myths.{{sfn|Eddy|Boyd|2007|pages=53–54}}

Despite this, several scholars have noticed that some of the [[Miracles of Jesus#Cures|healing miracles of Jesus]] recorded in the Synoptic Gospels bear similarities to Greek stories of miracles associated with [[Asclepius]], the god of healing and medicine.{{sfn|Edelstein|Edelstein|1998|pages=133–134}}{{sfn|Hill|2004|pages=67–68}}{{sfn|Cotter|2010|page=73}} Brennan R. Hill states that Jesus's miracles are, for the most part, clearly told in the context of the Jewish belief in the healing power of Yahweh,{{sfn|Hill|2004|pages=67–68}} but notes that the authors of the Synoptic Gospels may have subtly borrowed from Greek literary models.{{sfn|Hill|2004|page=68}} He states that Jesus's healing miracles chiefly differ from those of Asclepius by the fact that Jesus's are attributed to a human being on earth;{{sfn|Hill|2004|page=68}} whereas Asclepius's miracles are performed by a distant god.{{sfn|Hill|2004|page=68}} According to classical historians [[Emma J. Edelstein]] and [[Ludwig Edelstein]], the most obvious difference between Jesus and Asclepius is that Jesus extended his healing to "sinners and publicans";{{sfn|Edelstein|Edelstein|1998|page=134}} whereas Asclepius, as a god, refused to heal those who were ritually impure and confined his healing solely to those who thought pure thoughts.{{sfn|Edelstein|Edelstein|1998|page=134}} Scholars disagree whether the parable of the [[rich man and Lazarus]] recorded in {{bibleverse||Luke|16:19-31|9}} originates with Jesus or if it is a later Christian invention,{{sfn|van Eck|2016|pages=262–265}} but the story bears strong resemblances to various [[Folklore genre|folktales]] told throughout the Near East.{{sfn|van Eck|2016|page=265}}

[[File:Gerard van Honthorst - Adoration of the Shepherds (1622).jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.3|''Adoration of the Shepherds'' (1622) by the Dutch painter [[Gerard van Honthorst]]. Modern secular historians regard the birth narrative in the {{bibleref|Luke|1:26–2:52|9}} as a legend invented by early Christians based on Old Testament predecessors.{{sfn|Sanders|1993|pp=85–88}}{{sfn|Farris|2015|page=106}}{{sfn|Litwak|2005|page=75}}]]

It is, however, widely agreed that the portrayal of Jesus in the gospels is deeply influenced by Jewish tradition.{{sfn|Ehrman|2012|pages=198–199}}{{sfn|Sanders|1993|pages=88–91, 112–113}} According to [[E. P. Sanders]], a leading scholar on the historical Jesus, the Synoptic Gospels contain many episodes in which Jesus's described actions clearly emulate those of the [[Prophets in Judaism|prophets in the Hebrew Bible]].{{sfn|Sanders|1993|pages=88–91, 112–113}} Sanders states that, in some of these cases, it is impossible to know for certain whether these parallels originate from the historical Jesus himself having deliberately imitated the Hebrew prophets, or from later Christians inventing mythological stories in order to portray Jesus as one of them,{{sfn|Sanders|1993|pages=88–91, 112–113}} but, in many other instances, the parallels are clearly the work of the gospel-writers.{{sfn|Sanders|1993|pages=88–91}} The author of the [[Gospel of Matthew]] in particular intentionally seeks to portray Jesus as a "new [[Moses]]".{{sfn|Ehrman|2012|pages=198–199}}{{sfn|Sanders|1993|pages=90–91}} Matthew's account of [[Massacre of the Innocents|Herod's attempt to kill the infant Jesus]], Jesus's family's [[flight into Egypt]], and their subsequent return to Judaea is a mythical narrative based on the account of [[the Exodus]] in the [[Torah]].{{sfn|Ehrman|2012|page=198}}{{sfn|Sanders|1993|pages=87–88}}{{sfn|Casey|2010|page=146}} In the Gospel of Matthew, Jesus delivers his [[Sermon on the Mount|first public sermon on a mountain]] in imitation of the giving of the [[Law of Moses]] atop [[Mount Sinai]].{{sfn|Ehrman|2012|page=199}}{{sfn|Sanders|1993|page=146}} According to New Testament scholars [[Gerd Theissen]] and [[Annette Merz]], the teachings preserved in the sermon are statements that Jesus himself really said on different occasions that were originally recorded without context,{{sfn|Theissen|Merz|1998|pages=17–62}} but the author of the Gospel of Matthew compiled them into an organized lecture and invented context for them in order to fit his portrayal of Jesus as a "new Moses".{{sfn|Theissen|Merz|1998|pages=17–62}}{{sfn|Ehrman|2012|page=199}}

According to Sanders, the [[Nativity of Jesus|birth narratives]] in Matthew and Luke are the clearest examples of legends in the Synoptic Gospels.{{sfn|Sanders|1993|pp=85–88}} Both accounts have Jesus born in [[Bethlehem]], in accordance with Jewish salvation history, and both have him growing up in Nazareth,{{sfn|Sanders|1993|pp=85–88}} but they present two completely different and irreconcilable explanations for how that happened.{{sfn|Sanders|1993|pp=85–88}}{{sfn|Casey|2010|pages=146–147}} The accounts of the [[Annunciation]] of Jesus's conception found in {{bibleref|Matthew|1:18–22|9}} and {{bibleref|Luke|1:26–38|9}} are both modeled on the stories of the annunciations of [[Ishmael]], [[Isaac]], and [[Samson]] in the [[Old Testament]].{{sfn|Farris|2015|page=106}}{{sfn|Litwak|2005|page=75}}{{sfn|Casey|2010|pages=149–151}} Matthew quotes from the [[Septuagint]] translation of {{bibleverse||Isaiah|7:14|9}} to support his account of the virgin birth of Jesus.{{sfn|Seidler|2006|page=39}} The Hebrew text of this verse states "Behold, the young woman [''ha‘almāh''] is with child and about to bear a son and she will call him Immanuel."{{sfn|Seidler|2006|page=39}} The Septuagint, however, translates the Hebrew word ''‘almāh'', which literally means "young woman",{{sfn|Seidler|2006|page=39}} as the Greek word παρθένος (''parthenos''), which means "virgin".{{sfn|Seidler|2006|page=39}} Most secular historians therefore generally see the two separate accounts of the virgin birth from the Gospels of Matthew and Luke as independent legendary inventions designed to fulfill the mistranslated passage from Isaiah.{{sfn|Bruner|2004|page=37}}{{sfn|Machen|1987|page=252}}{{sfn|Marchadour|Neuhaus|Martini|2009|pages=67–68}} Sanders clarifies that the birth narratives are "an extreme case" resulting from the authors of the gospels lack of knowledge about Jesus's birth and childhood;{{sfn|Sanders|1993|page=88}} no other part of the gospels relies so heavily on Old Testament parallels.{{sfn|Sanders|1993|page=88}} Sanders also notes that, despite the clearly intentional parallels, the "striking differences" between Jesus and the prophets of the Old Testament are also highly significant{{sfn|Sanders|1993|page=89}} and the gospels' accounts of Jesus's life on the whole do not closely resemble the lives of any of the figures in the Hebrew Bible.{{sfn|Sanders|1993|page=88}}

MacDonald]] has argued that the Gospel of Mark is, in fact, a Jewish retelling of the ''[[Odyssey]]'', with its ending derived from the ''[[Iliad]]'', that uses Jesus as its central character in the place of [[Odysseus]].{{sfn|MacDonald|pages=1–4}} According to MacDonald, the gospels are primarily intended to show Jesus as superior to Greek heroes{{sfn|MacDonald|pages=1–4}} and, although Jesus himself was a real historical figure, the gospels should be read as works of [[historical fiction]] centered on a real protagonist, not as accurate accounts of Jesus's life.{{sfn|MacDonald|pages=1–4}} MacDonald's thesis that the gospels are modeled on the Homeric Epics has been met with intense skepticism in scholarly circles due to its almost complete reliance on extremely vague and subjective parallels.{{sfn|Sandnes|2005|pages=714–732}}{{sfn|Watts|2013|pages=11–18}}{{sfn|Perkins|2007|pages=23–24}}{{sfn|Meyer|2013|pages=149–150}} Other scholars state that his argument is also undermined by the fact that the Gospel of Mark never directly quotes from either of the Homeric Epics{{sfn|Sandnes|2005|pages=714–732}}{{sfn|Watts|2013|pages=12–13}}{{sfn|Perkins|2007|page=24}} and uses completely dissimilar language.{{sfn|Sandnes|2005|pages=714–732}}{{sfn|Watts|2013|pages=12–13}}{{sfn|Perkins|2007|page=24}} Pheme Perkins also notes that many of the incidents in the Gospel of Mark that MacDonald claims are derived from the ''Odyssey'' have much closer parallels in the Old Testament.{{sfn|Perkins|2007|page=24}} MacDonald's argument, in a misunderstood form, has nonetheless become popular in non-scholarly circles, mostly on the internet, where it is used to support the Christ Myth theory.{{sfn|MacDonald|2009|pages=23–24}} MacDonald himself rejects this interpretation as too drastic.{{sfn|MacDonald|2009|pages=23–24}}

===Gospel of John===
[[File:Dionysos kantharos BM B589.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Late sixth-century BC [[black-figure]] painting showing [[Dionysus]] extending a ''[[kantharos]]'', a kind of drinking cup. Some scholars have argued that the portrayal of Jesus in the [[Gospel of John]] may have been influenced by Dionysian symbolism.{{sfn|Salier|2004|pages=66–69}}{{sfn|Stibbe|1993|pages=241–242}}{{sfn|Shorroch|2011|pages=57–64}}{{sfn|Orchard|1998|pages=129–132}}{{sfn|Kierspel|2006|pages=202–203}}{{sfn|Stibbe|1994|pages=131–134}}]]

The [[Gospel of John]], the latest of the four canonical gospels, was influenced by ideas from [[Platonism]].{{sfn|Smalley|2012|pages=47–48}}{{sfn|Porter|2015|pages=102–104}} The "[[Logos]]" described in John's prologue is originally a concept from Greek philosophy,{{sfn|Porter|2015|pages=102–104}} devised by the [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|Pre-Socratic philosopher]] [[Heraclitus]] and adapted to Judaism by the Jewish [[Middle Platonism|Middle Platonist]] [[Philo|Philo of Alexandria]].{{sfn|Porter|2015|pages=102–104}} However, the author of the Gospel of John probably did not borrow the Logos theology from Platonic texts directly;{{sfn|Smalley|2012|pages=47–48}}{{sfn|Porter|2015|pages=102–104}} instead, these sources probably influenced earlier Jewish deuterocanonical texts, which John inherited and expanded his own Logos theology from.{{sfn|Smalley|2012|pages=47–48}}{{sfn|Porter|2015|pages=102–104}} In Platonic terminology, Logos was a universal force that represented the rationality and intelligibility of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Hornblower, Simon, Antony Spawforth, and Esther Eidinow, eds. The Oxford classical dictionary. Oxford University Press, 1996, 882&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, as adapted into Judaism, Logos becomes a mediating divine figure between God and man and mostly owed influence from [[Wisdom literature]], and by the time it was transmitted into Judaism, seems to have retained the concept of the universality of the Platonic logos. Davies and Finkelstein write "This primeval and universal Wisdom had, at God's command, found itself a home on Mount Zion in Jerusalem. This mediatorial figure, which in its universality can be compared with the Platonic 'world-soul' or the Stoic 'logos', is here exclusively connected with Israel, God's chosen people, and with his sanctuary."&lt;ref&gt;Sturdy, John, Louis Finkelstein, and William David Davies, eds. The Cambridge History of Judaism: The Hellenistic Age. Cambridge University Press, 2007, 223-224&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars have long suspected that the Gospel of John may have also been influenced by symbolism associated with the cult of [[Dionysus]], the Greek god of wine.{{sfn|Salier|2004|pages=66–69}}{{sfn|Stibbe|1993|pages=241–242}}{{sfn|Shorroch|2011|pages=57–64}}{{sfn|Orchard|1998|pages=129–132}}{{sfn|Kierspel|2006|pages=202–203}}{{sfn|Stibbe|1994|pages=131–134}} The issue of whether the Gospel of John was truly influenced by the cult of Dionysus is hotly disputed,{{sfn|Salier|2004|pages=66–69}} with reputable scholars passionately defending both sides of the argument.{{sfn|Salier|2004|pages=66–69}} Dionysus was one of the best-known Greek deities;{{sfn|Salier|2004|page=67}} he was worshipped throughout most of the [[Greco-Roman world]]{{sfn|Salier|2004|page=67}} and his cult is attested in Palestine, Asia Minor, and Italy.{{sfn|Salier|2004|page=67}} At the same time, other scholars have argued that it is highly implausible that the devout Christian author of the Gospel of John would have deliberately incorporated Dionysian imagery into his account{{sfn|Salier|2004|page=67}} and instead argue that the symbolism of wine in the Gospel of John is much more likely to be based on the many references to wine found throughout the Old Testament.{{sfn|Salier|2004|page=67}} In response to this objection, proponents of Dionysian influence have argued that it is possible that the author of the Gospel of John may have used Dionysian imagery in effort to show Jesus as "superior" to Dionysus.{{sfn|Salier|2004|page=67}}{{sfn|Kierspel|2006|page=202}}{{sfn|Stibbe|1994|page=132}}

The first instance of possible Dionysian influence is Jesus's miracle of turning water into wine at the [[Marriage at Cana]] in {{bibleverse||John|2:1-11|9}}.{{sfn|Salier|2004|pages=66–69}}{{sfn|Kierspel|2006|page=202}} The story bears some resemblance to a number of stories that were told about Dionysus.{{sfn|Salier|2004|page=66}} Dionysus's close associations with wine are attested as early as the writings of [[Plato]]{{sfn|Salier|2004|page=66}} and the second-century AD Greek geographer [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] describes a ritual in which Dionysus was said to fill empty barrels that had been left locked inside a temple overnight with wine.&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias, ''Description of Greece'' 2.26&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Salier|2004|pages=67–68}} In the Greek novel ''[[Leucippe and Clitophon]]'' by [[Achilles Tatius]], written in the first or second century AD, a herdsman takes Dionysus into his home and offers him a meal,{{sfn|Salier|2004|page=68}} but can only offer him the same thing to drink as his oxen.{{sfn|Salier|2004|page=68}} Miraculously, Dionysus turns the drink into wine.{{sfn|Salier|2004|page=68}} The account of turning water into wine does not occur in any of the Synoptic Gospels and is only found in the Gospel of John,{{sfn|Shorroch|2011|page=57}} indicating that the author of the fourth gospel may have invented it.{{sfn|Shorroch|2011|page=57}}{{sfn|Kierspel|2006|page=202}}{{sfn|Stibbe|1994|page=132}} A second occurrence of possible Dionysian influence is the allegory found in {{bibleverse||John|15:1-17|9}}, in which Jesus declares himself to be the "[[True Vine]]",{{sfn|Shorroch|2011|page=57}} a title reminiscent of Dionysus, who was said to have discovered the first grape vine.{{sfn|Shorroch|2011|page=57}}

[[File:Pompeii - Casa dei Vettii - Pentheus.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.3|First-century AD Roman wall painting from the [[House of the Vettii]] in [[Pompeii]] showing Dionysus's enemy [[Pentheus]] being torn to pieces by the ''[[maenad]]s'', Dionysus's female followers, the climactic scene of [[Euripides]]'s ''[[The Bacchae|Bacchae]]'']]

Mark S. W. Stibbe has argued that the Gospel of John also contains parallels with ''[[The Bacchae]]'', a tragedy written by the Athenian playwright [[Euripides]] that was first performed in 405 BC and involves Dionysus as a central character.{{sfn|Stibbe|1993|page=241}}{{sfn|Stibbe|1994|pages=134–136}} In both works, the central figure is portrayed as an incarnate deity who arrives in a country where he should be known and worshipped,{{sfn|Stibbe|1993|page=241}}{{sfn|Stibbe|1994|pages=134–135}} but, because he is disguised as a mortal, the deity is not recognized and is instead persecuted by the ruling party.{{sfn|Stibbe|1993|page=241}}{{sfn|Stibbe|1994|pages=134–135}} In the Gospel of John, Jesus is portrayed as elusive, intentionally making ambiguous statements to evade capture, much like Dionysus in Euripides's ''Bacchae''.{{sfn|Stibbe|1993|page=241}}{{sfn|Stibbe|1994|page=135}} In both works, the deity is supported by a group of female followers.{{sfn|Stibbe|1993|page=241}}{{sfn|Stibbe|1994|page=135}} Both works end with the violent death of one of the central figures;{{sfn|Stibbe|1994|page=135}} in John's gospel it is Jesus himself, but in ''The Bacchae'' it is Dionysus's cousin and adversary [[Pentheus]], the king of Thebes.{{sfn|Stibbe|1994|page=135}}{{refn|group=nb|In the ''Bacchae'', Pentheus is not crucified, but torn apart by the ''[[maenad]]s'', Dionysus's female followers. In a later [[Euhemerism|euhemerized]] retelling of the myth of Pentheus from the third century BC, however, the Greek historian [[Diodorus Siculus]] states that Dionysus crossed the [[Hellespont]] and "defeated the [[Thrace|Thracian]] forces in battle. Lycurgus, whom he took prisoner, he blinded, tortured in every conceivable way and finally crucified."{{sfn|Hengel|1977|page=13}}&lt;ref name="DiodorusSiculus"&gt;[[Diodorus Siculus]] ''Universal History'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0540%3Abook%3D3%3Achapter%3D65%3Asection%3D5 3.65.5]&lt;/ref&gt; This represents a unique instance in which Dionysus is shown as a god who crucifies his enemies.{{sfn|Hengel|1977|pages=11–13}}}}

Stibbe emphasizes that two accounts are also radically different,{{sfn|Stibbe|1994|page=136}} but states that they share similar themes.{{sfn|Stibbe|1994|page=136}} One of the most obvious differences is that, in ''The Bacchae'', Dionysus has come to advocate a philosophy of wine and [[hedonism]];{{sfn|Stibbe|1994|page=136}} whereas Jesus in the Gospel of John has come to offer his followers salvation from sin.{{sfn|Stibbe|1994|page=136}} Euripides portrays Dionysus as aggressive and violent;{{sfn|Stibbe|1994|page=136}} whereas the Gospel of John shows Jesus as peaceful and full of mercy.{{sfn|Stibbe|1994|page=136}} Furthermore, ''The Bacchae'' is set within an explicitly polytheistic world,{{sfn|Stibbe|1994|page=136}} but the Gospel of John admits the existence of only two gods: Jesus himself and his [[God the Father|Father in Heaven]].{{sfn|Stibbe|1994|page=136}}

===Infancy Gospel of Thomas===
The [[Infancy Gospel of Thomas]] is a short apocryphal gospel, probably written in the second century AD, describing Jesus's childhood.{{sfn|Aasgaard|2010|page=1}} It is unique as the only purported account of Jesus's childhood to survive from early Christian times.{{sfn|Aasgaard|2010|page=1}} It describes a variety of miracles attributed to the young Jesus.{{sfn|Aasgaard|2010|pages=1–2}} It remained continuously in popular use throughout the Middle Ages up until the time of the [[Reformation]].{{sfn|Aasgaard|2010|page=2}} Reidar Aasgaard has argued that the Infancy Gospel may have been partially intended for children{{sfn|Aasgaard|2010|pages=196–198}} and discusses how the stories in the gospel fit the genre of Greco-Roman fairy tales.{{sfn|Aasgaard|2010|pages=196–202}} J. R. C. Cousland argues that the Infancy Gospel may have been originally written for a primarily pagan audience,{{sfn|Cousland|2017|pages=}} noting that the Greeks and Romans told stories about their gods' miraculous doings as children{{sfn|Cousland|2017|pages=122–123}} and that miracle stories were often instrumental in converting pagans to Christianity.{{sfn|Cousland|2017|pages=123–124}}

==Syncretisms in late antiquity==
===Mithraism===
[[File:Mithra sacrifiant le Taureau-005.JPG|thumb|right|upright=1.3|Ancient Roman ''[[tauroctony]]'' dating to the third century AD, depicting Mithras slaying the bull, the most important story of the [[Mithraism|Mithraic Cult]]{{sfn|Ulansey|1989|pages=9–11}}{{sfn|Ehrman|2012|page=213}}{{sfn|Patella|2006|page=12}}]]

Around the same time that Christianity was expanding, the [[Mithraism|cult of the god Mithras]] was also spreading throughout the Roman Empire.{{sfn|Patella|2006|pages=1–2, 9}} Very little is known for certain about the Mithraic cult because it was a "[[Greco-Roman mysteries|Mystery Cult]]", meaning its members were forbidden from disclosing what the cult believed to outsiders.{{sfn|Patella|2006|pages=3–4}}{{sfn|Ehrman|2012|page=213}} No Mithraic sacred texts have survived, if any such writings ever existed.{{sfn|Ehrman|2012|page=213}}{{sfn|Patella|2006|page=2}} Consequently, it is disputed how much influence Christianity and Mithraism may have had on each other.{{sfn|Patella|2006|page=2}} Michael Patella states that the similarities between Christianity and Mithraism are more likely a result of their shared cultural environment rather than direct borrowing from one to the other.{{sfn|Patella|2006|pages=2–4}} Christianity and Mithraism were both of Oriental origin{{sfn|Patella|2006|page=9}} and their practices and respective savior figures were both shaped by the social conditions in the Roman Empire during the time period.{{sfn|Patella|2006|page=2}}

Most of what is known about the legendary life of Mithras comes from archaeological excavation of [[Mithraeum|Mithraea]], underground Mithraic sanctuaries of worship, which were found all across the Roman world.{{sfn|Patella|2006|page=8}}{{sfn|Ulansey|1989|page=6}} Like Jesus, Mithras was seen as a divine savior,{{sfn|Patella|2006|pages=1–9}}{{sfn|Ulansey|1989|page=125}} but, unlike Jesus, Mithras was not believed to have brought his salvation by suffering and dying.{{sfn|Patella|2006|page=8}} Mithras was believed to have been born fully-grown from a rock,{{sfn|Ulansey|1989|pages=35–36}}{{sfn|Clauss|2001|pages=62–66}} a belief which is confirmed by a vast number of surviving sculptures showing him rising from the rock nude except for a [[Phrygian cap]], clutching a sword in his right hand and a torch in his left.{{sfn|Ulansey|1989|pages=35–36}}{{sfn|Clauss|2001|pages=62–66}} In many depictions, the rock is also encircled by a snake.{{sfn|Clauss|2001|page=67}} In Mithraic cults primarily from the Rhine-Danube region, there are also representations of a myth in which Mithras shoots an arrow at a rock face, causing water to gush forth.{{sfn|Clauss|2001|pages=71–72}} This myth is one of the closest parallels between Mithras and Jesus.{{sfn|Clauss|2001|page=72}} Both Christians and Mithraists used water as a symbol for their respective saviors.{{sfn|Clauss|2001|page=72}} In the New Testament, Jesus is referred to as the "[[Water of Life (Christianity)|water of life]]"{{sfn|Clauss|2001|page=72}} and a votive altar to Mithras from [[Ptuj|Poetovio]] proclaims him as the ''fons perennis'' ("the ever-flowing stream").{{sfn|Clauss|2001|page=72}}

In the center of every Mithraeum was a ''[[tauroctony]]'',{{sfn|Ulansey|1989|page=6}}{{sfn|Patella|2006|page=12}}{{sfn|Ehrman|2012|page=213}} a painting or sculpture showing Mithras as a young man, usually wearing a cape and Phrygian cap, plunging a knife into the neck or shoulder of a bull as he turns its head towards him, simultaneously turning his own head away.{{sfn|Patella|2006|page=12}}{{sfn|Ulansey|1989|page=11}}{{sfn|Ehrman|2012|page=213}} A dog laps up the blood pouring from the bull's wound, from which emerges an ear of corn,{{sfn|Ehrman|2012|page=213}} as a scorpion stings the bull's [[scrotum]].{{sfn|Ehrman|2012|page=213}} [[Cautes and Cautopates|Human torchbearers]] stand on either side of the scene, one holding his torch upright and other upside-down.{{sfn|Ehrman|2012|page=213}} A serpent is also present.{{sfn|Ulansey|1989|page=11}}{{sfn|Ehrman|2012|page=213}} The exact interpretation of this scene is unclear,{{sfn|Ehrman|2012|page=213}} but the image certainly depicts a narrative central to Mithraism{{sfn|Ulansey|1989|pages=9–11}}{{sfn|Patella|2006|page=12}}{{sfn|Ehrman|2012|page=213}} and the figures in it appear to correspond to the signs of the [[zodiac]].{{sfn|Ulansey|1989|pages=16–20}}{{sfn|Ehrman|2012|page=213}}{{sfn|Patella|2006|page=12}} The closest parallel between Jesus and Mithras is the use of a ritual meal.{{sfn|Clauss|2001|pages=72, 169}} After slaying the bull, Mithras was believed to have shared the bull's meat with the sun-god [[Sol Invictus]], a meal which is shown in Mithraic iconography and which was ritually reenacted by Mithraists as part of their liturgy.{{sfn|Clauss|2001|pages=112–116}} Manfred Clauss, a scholar of the Mithraic cult, speculates that the similarities between Christianity and Mithraism may have made it easier for members of the Mithraic cult to convert to Christianity without having to give up their ritual meal, sun-imagery, candles, incense, or bells,{{sfn|Clauss|2001|pages=171–172}} a trend which might explain why, as late as the sixth century, the Christian Church was still trying to stamp out the ''stulti homines'' who still paid obeisance to the sun every morning on the steps of the church itself.{{sfn|Clauss|2001|page=172}}

A few Christian apologists from the second and third centuries, who had never been members of the Mithraic cult and had never spoken to its members, claimed that the practices of the Mithraic cult were copied off Christianity.{{sfn|Ehrman|2012|page=213}} The second-century Christian apologist [[Justin Martyr]] writes in his ''[[First Apology of Justin Martyr|First Apology]]'', after describing the Christian [[Eucharist]], that "...the wicked devils have imitated [this] in the mysteries of Mithras, commanding the same thing to be done. For, that bread and a cup of water are placed with certain incantations in the mystic rites of one who is being initiated, you either know or can learn."&lt;ref&gt;''First Apology of Justin Martyr'', [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/anf01.viii.ii.lxvi.html Chapter 66]&lt;/ref&gt; The later apologist [[Tertullian]] writes in his ''De praescriptione haereticorum'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;The devil (is the inspirer of the heretics) whose work it is to pervert the truth, who with idolatrous mysteries endeavours to imitate the realities of the divine sacraments. Some he himself sprinkles as though in token of faith and loyalty; he promises forgiveness of sins through baptism; and if my memory does not fail me marks his own soldiers with the sign of Mithra on their foreheads, commemorates an offering of bread, introduces a mock resurrection, and with the sword opens the way to the crown. Moreover has he not forbidden a second marriage to the supreme priest? He maintains also his virgins and his celibates.&lt;ref&gt;Tertullian, ''De praescriptione haereticorum'' [http://www.tertullian.org/fathers2/ANF-03/anf03-24.htm#P3664_1234278 4-.3-4]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Ehrman, these writers were ideologically motivated to portray Christianity and Mithraism as similar because they wanted to persuade pagan officials that Christianity was not so different from other religious traditions, so that these officials would realize that there was no reason to single Christians out for persecution.{{sfn|Ehrman|2012|pages=213–214}} These apologists therefore intentionally exaggerated similarities between Christianity and Mithraism to support their arguments.{{sfn|Ehrman|2012|pages=213–214}} Scholars are generally wary of trusting anything these sources have to say about the Mithraic cult's alleged practices.{{sfn|Ehrman|2012|page=214}}

Early Christians also identified Jesus with the Greek hero [[Orpheus]],{{sfn|Friedman|2000|pages=38–61}} who was said to have tamed wild beasts with the music of his lyre.{{sfn|Friedman|2000|pages=55–57}} The [[church fathers|Church Father]] [[Clement of Alexandria]] writes that Orpheus and Jesus are similar in that they have both been subject to admiration on account of their "songs",{{sfn|Friedman|2000|page=56}} but insists that Orpheus misused his gift of eloquence by persuading people to worship idols and "tie themselves to temporal things";{{sfn|Friedman|2000|page=56}} whereas Jesus, the singer of the "New Song" brings peace to men and frees them from the bonds of the flesh.{{sfn|Friedman|2000|page=56}} The later Christian historian [[Eusebius]], drawing on Clement, also compares Orpheus to Jesus for having both brought peace to men.{{sfn|Friedman|2000|pages=56–57}} One unusual possible instance of identification between Jesus and Orpheus is a [[hematite]] gem inscribed with the image of a crucified man identified as ΟΡΦΕΩΣ ΒΑΚΧΙΚΟΣ (''Orpheos Bacchikos'').{{sfn|Carotta|Eickenberg|2009|page=4}}{{sfn|Hengel|1977|pages=13 and 22}} The gem has long been suspected to be a forgery created in the late seventeenth or early eighteenth century,{{sfn|Carotta|Eickenberg|2009|pages=1–3}}{{sfn|Hengel|1977|pages=13 and 22}} but, if authentic, it may date to the late second or early third century AD.{{sfn|Carotta|Eickenberg|2009|page=4}}{{sfn|Hengel|1977|pages=13 and 22}} If authentic, the gem would represent a remarkable instance of pagans adopting Christian iconography, rather than ''vice versa'' as is generally more common.{{sfn|Carotta|Eickenberg|2009|page=4}} The gem was formerly housed at the [[Altes Museum]] in [[Berlin]], but was lost or destroyed during [[World War II]].{{sfn|Carotta|Eickenberg|2009|page=1}}{{sfn|Hengel|1977|pages=13 and 22}}

Early Christians found it hard to criticize Asclepius because, while their usual tactics were to denounce the absurdity of believing in gods who were merely personifications of nature and to accuse pagan gods of being immoral,{{sfn|Edelstein|Edelstein|1998|page=135}} neither of these could be applied to Asclepius, who was never portrayed as a personification of nature and whose stories were inscrutably moral.{{sfn|Edelstein|Edelstein|1998|page=135}} The early Christian apologist [[Justin Martyr]] argued that believing in Jesus's divinity should not be hard for pagans, since it was no different from believing in the divinity of Asclepius.{{sfn|Edelstein|Edelstein|1998|page=135}} Eventually, Christians adapted much of the iconography of Asclepius to suit the miracles of Jesus.{{sfn|Jefferson|2014|pages=6–7}}{{sfn|Ferngren|2009|page=41}} Images of Jesus as a healer replaced images of Asclepius and [[Hippocrates]] as the ideal physician.{{sfn|Ferngren|2009|page=41}} Jesus, who was originally shown as clean-shaven, may have first been shown as bearded as a result of this syncretism with Asclepius,{{sfn|Ogden|2013|page=420}}{{sfn|Taylor|2018|page=82}} as well as other bearded deities such as [[Zeus]] and [[Serapis]].{{sfn|Taylor|2018|page=82}} A second-century AD head of Asclepius was discovered underneath a fourth-century AD Christian church in [[Jerash|Gerasa, Jordan]].{{sfn|Ogden|2013|page=420}}

In some depictions from late antiquity, Jesus was shown with the [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]] of the sun god [[Sol Invictus]].{{sfn|Taylor|2018|page=122}} Images of "[[Christ in Majesty]]" seated upon a throne were inspired by classical depictions of Zeus and other chief deities.{{sfn|Taylor|2018|page=82}} By the fourth century AD, the recognizable image of Jesus as long-haired, bearded, and clad in long, baggy-sleeved clothing had fully emerged.{{sfn|Taylor|2018|page=82}} This widespread adaptation of pagan iconography to suit Jesus did not sit well with many Christians.{{sfn|Taylor|2018|page=118}} A fragment of a lost work by Theodor Lector preserves a miracle story dated to around 465 AD in which the bishop [[Gennadius of Constantinople]] was said to have healed an artist who had lost all strength in his hand after painting an image of Christ showing him with long, curly hair, parted in the same manner as traditional representations of Zeus.{{sfn|Taylor|2018|page=118}}

Christians also may have adapted the iconography of the Egyptian goddess [[Isis]] nursing her son [[Horus]] and applied it to the [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]] nursing her son Jesus.{{sfn|Reid|2002|page=24}}{{sfn|Johnson|Johnson|2007|page=79}} Some Christians also may have conflated stories about the Egyptian god [[Osiris]] with the resurrection of Jesus.{{sfn|Reid|2002|page=24}}{{sfn|Johnson|Johnson|2007|page=79}} The title of ''kosmokrateros'' ("Ruler of the Cosmos"), which was eventually applied to Jesus, had previously been borne by Serapis.{{sfn|Taylor|2018|page=121}} The [[Church Fathers|Church Father]] [[Jerome]] records in a letter dated to the year 395 AD that "Bethlehem... belonging now to us... was overshadowed by a grove of [[Dumuzid|Tammuz]], that is to say, [[Adonis]], and in the cave where once the infant Christ cried, the lover of [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] was lamented."{{sfn|Taylor|1993|page=96}} This same cave later became the site of the [[Church of the Nativity]].{{sfn|Taylor|1993|page=96}} The church historian [[Eusebius]], however, does not mention pagans having ever worshipped in the cave,{{sfn|Taylor|1993|page=96}} nor do any other early Christian writers.{{sfn|Taylor|1993|page=96}} Peter Welten has argued that the cave was never dedicated to Tammuz{{sfn|Taylor|1993|page=96}} and that Jerome misinterpreted Christian mourning over the [[Massacre of the Innocents]] as a pagan ritual over Tammuz's death.{{sfn|Taylor|1993|page=96}} Joan E. Taylor has countered this argument by arguing that Jerome, as an educated man, could not have been so naïve as to mistake Christian mourning over the Massacre of the Innocents as a pagan ritual for Tammuz.{{sfn|Taylor|1993|pages=96–97}} During the sixth century AD, some Christians in the Middle East borrowed elements from poems of Tammuz's wife [[Inanna|Ishtar]] mourning over her husband's death into their own retellings of the [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Virgin Mary]] mourning over the death of her son Jesus.{{sfn|Warner|2016|pages=210–212}}{{sfn|Baring|Cashford|1991}} The Syrian writers [[Jacob of Serugh]] and [[Romanos the Melodist]] both wrote laments in which the Virgin Mary describes her compassion for her son at the foot of the cross in deeply personal terms closely resembling Ishtar's laments over the death of Tammuz.{{sfn|Warner|2016|page=212}}

===Birthdate===
{{main|Christmas}}
The Bible never states when Jesus was born,{{sfn|Aldrete|Aldrete|2012|page=82}}{{sfn|John|2001|page=112}}{{sfn|Struthers|2012|pages=17–21}} but, by late antiquity, Christians had begun celebrating his birth on 25 December.{{sfn|John|2001|page=112}} In 274 AD, the Roman emperor [[Aurelian]] had declared 25 December the birthdate of [[Sol Invictus]], a sun god of Syrian origin whose cult had been vigorously promoted by the earlier emperor [[Elagabalus]].{{sfn|Aldrete|Aldrete|2012|pages=82–83}}{{sfn|Struthers|2012|pages=17–21}} Christians may have thought that they could attract more converts to Christianity by allowing them to continue to celebrate on the same day.{{sfn|Struthers|2012|pages=17–21}} 25 December also falls around the same time as the Roman festival of [[Saturnalia]], which was much older and more widely celebrated.{{sfn|Aldrete|Aldrete|2012|pages=83–84}}{{sfn|John|2001|page=112}} Many of the customs originally associated with Saturnalia eventually became associated with Christmas.{{sfn|Aldrete|Aldrete|2012|pages=83–84}}{{sfn|John|2001|page=112}} Early Christians may have also been influenced by the idea that Jesus had died on the anniversary of his conception;{{sfn|Struthers|2012|pages=17–21}} because Jesus died during Passover and, in the third century AD, Passover was celebrated on 25 March,{{sfn|Struthers|2012|pages=17–21}} they may have assumed that Jesus's birthday must have come nine months later, on 25 December.{{sfn|Struthers|2012|pages=17–21}}

==General comparisons==
Aspects of Jesus's life as recorded in the gospels bear some similarities to various other figures, both historical and mythological.{{sfn|Ehrman|2010|pages=207–218}}{{sfn|Casey|2014|pages=203–204}} Proponents of the Christ Myth theory frequently exaggerate these similarities as part of their efforts to claim that Jesus never existed as a historical figure.{{sfn|Ehrman|2010|pages=207–218}}{{sfn|Casey|2014|pages=203–204}} [[Maurice Casey]], the late Emeritus Professor of New Testament Languages and Literature at the [[University of Nottingham]], writes that these parallels do not in any way indicate that Jesus was invented based on pagan "divine men",{{sfn|Casey|2014|page=203}} but rather that he was simply not as perfectly unique as many [[Evangelicalism|evangelical Christians]] frequently claim he was.{{sfn|Casey|2014|page=203}}

{{main|Miraculous birth}}
Classical mythology is filled with stories of miraculous births of various kinds,{{sfn|Warner|2016|pages=36–37}}{{sfn|Litwa|2014|pages=62–64}}{{sfn|Ehrman|2012|pages=214–215}}{{sfn|Casey|2010|pages=147–151}} but, in most cases of divine offspring from classical mythology, the father is a god who engages in literal sexual intercourse with the mother, a mortal woman,{{sfn|Litwa|2014|pages=38, 64–66}}{{sfn|Ehrman|2012|page=214}} causing her to give birth to a son who is literally half god and half man.{{sfn|Litwa|2014|pages=64–66}}{{sfn|Ehrman|2012|page=214}} A possible pagan precursor to the Christian story of the virgin birth of Jesus is an Athenian legend recounted by the mythographer [[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Pseudo-Apollodorus]].{{sfn|Deacy|2008|page=82}}{{snf|Kerényi|1951|page=281}} According to this account, [[Hephaestus]], the god of blacksmiths, once attempted to rape Athena, the virgin goddess of wisdom, but she pushed him away, causing him to [[ejaculate]] on her thigh.{{snf|Kerényi|1951|page=123}}{{sfn|Deacy|2008|page=82}}{{snf|Burkert|1985|page=143}} Athena wiped the [[semen]] off using a tuft of [[wool]],{{snf|Kerényi|1951|page=123}}{{sfn|Deacy|2008|page=82}}{{snf|Burkert|1985|page=143}} which she tossed into the dust,{{snf|Kerényi|1951|page=123}}{{sfn|Deacy|2008|page=82}}{{snf|Burkert|1985|page=143}} impregnating [[Gaia (mythology)|Gaia]] and causing her to give birth to [[Erichthonius of Athens|Erichthonius]],{{snf|Kerényi|1951|page=123}}{{sfn|Deacy|2008|page=82}}{{snf|Burkert|1985|page=143}} whom Athena adopted as her own child.{{snf|Kerényi|1951|page=123}}{{sfn|Deacy|2008|pages=82–83}} Thus, Athena was able to produce a "son" without her losing her virginity.{{sfn|Deacy|2008|pages=82–83}} The Roman mythographer [[Hyginus]]{{snf|Kerényi|1951|page=281}} records a similar story in which Hephaestus demanded Zeus to let him marry Athena since he was the one who had smashed open Zeus's skull, allowing Athena to be born.{{snf|Kerényi|1951|page=123}} Zeus agreed to this and Hephaestus and Athena were married,{{snf|Kerényi|1951|page=123}} but, when Hephaestus was about to consummate the union, Athena vanished from the bridal bed, causing him to ejaculate on the floor, thus impregnating Gaia with Erichthonius.{{snf|Kerényi|1951|page=123}}

Another comparable story from Greek mythology describes the conception of the hero [[Perseus]].{{sfn|Warner|2016|page=37}}{{sfn|Litwa|2014|page=42}}{{sfn|Dundes|1980|page=225}} According to the myth, Zeus came to Perseus's mother [[Danaë]] in the form of a shower of gold and impregnated her.{{sfn|Warner|2016|page=37}}{{sfn|Machen|1987|page=335}}{{sfn|Dundes|1980|page=225}} Although no surviving Greek text ever describes this as a "virgin birth",{{sfn|Machen|1987|page=335}} the early Christian apologist [[Justin Martyr]] has his Jewish speaker Trypho refer to it as such in his ''[[Dialogue with Trypho]]''.{{sfn|Machen|1987|page=335}}{{sfn|Dundes|1980|page=225}}{{sfn|Warner|2016|pages=36–37}} Scholars have also compared the story of the virgin birth to the complex narratives revolving around the birth of Dionysus.{{sfn|Litwa|2014|page=38}}{{sfn|Warner|2016|pages=35–36}} In most versions of the conception of Dionysus, Zeus was said to have come to the mortal woman [[Semele]] disguised as a mortal and had sex with her.{{sfn|Kerényi|1951|page=257}} Zeus's wife [[Hera]] disguised herself as Semele's nurse and persuaded her to ask Zeus to show her his true, divine form.{{sfn|Kerényi|1951|page=257}} Zeus eventually agreed, but, upon revealing his divine form, Semele was instantly incinerated by his lightning.{{sfn|Kerényi|1951|page=257}} Zeus rescued the unborn infant Dionysus and sewed him inside his own thigh, giving birth to him himself when it was time.{{sfn|Kerényi|1951|pages=257–258}} In an alternative version of the story told by the Roman mythographer [[Gaius Julius Hyginus|Hyginus]], Dionysus was actually the son of Zeus and [[Persephone]],{{sfn|Kerényi|1951|pages=252–257}} who was torn apart by the [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]].{{sfn|Kerényi|1951|pages=252–257}} Zeus rescued Dionysus's heart, ground it up, and mixed it into a potion, which he gave to Semele to drink, causing her to become pregnant with the infant who had been killed.{{sfn|Kerényi|1951|pages=256–257}}

According to M. David Litwa, the authors of the Gospels of Matthew and Luke consciously attempt to avoid portraying Jesus's conception as anything resembling pagan accounts of divine parentage;{{sfn|Litwa|2014|page=64}} the author of the Gospel of Luke tells a similar story about the conception of John the Baptist in effort to emphasize the Jewish character of Jesus's birth.{{sfn|Litwa|2014|page=64}} Nonetheless, Litwe argues that the accounts are unconsciously influenced by pagan stories of divine men, despite their authors' efforts to avert this.{{sfn|Litwa|2014|pages=40–43, 64–66}} Other stories of virgin births similar to Jesus's are referenced by later Christian writers.{{sfn|Warner|2016|pages=37–38}} The third-century AD Christian theologian [[Origen]] retells a legend that [[Plato]]'s mother [[Perictione]] had virginally conceived him after the god Apollo had appeared to her husband [[Ariston of Athens|Ariston]] and told him not to consummate his marriage with his wife,{{sfn|Warner|2016|page=37}}{{sfn|Litwa|2014|page=66}}{{sfn|Cooper|2001|page=81}} a scene closely paralleling the account of the Annunciation to Joseph from the Gospel of Matthew.{{sfn|Warner|2016|page=37}} Origen interpreted this story and others like it as prefiguring the reality made manifest by Jesus's virginal conception.{{sfn|Warner|2016|page=37}}{{sfn|Litwa|2014|pages=65–66}} In the fourth century, the bishop [[Epiphanius of Salamis]] protested that, in Alexandria, at the temple of Kore-Persephone, the pagans enacted a "hideous mockery" of the Christian Epiphany in which they claimed that "Today at this hour Kore, that is the virgin, has given birth to [[Aion (deity)|Aion]]."{{sfn|Warner|2016|page=37}}

===Archetypal folkloric hero===
{{main|Rank-Raglan mythotype|Hero}}
Folklorist [[Alan Dundes]] has argued that Jesus fits all but five of the twenty-two narrative patterns in the [[Rank-Raglan mythotype]],{{sfn|Dundes|1980|pages=230–236}}{{sfn|Eddy|Boyd|2007|page=31}} and therefore more closely matches the archetype than many of the heroes traditionally cited to support it, such as [[Jason]], [[Bellerophon]], [[Pelops]], [[Asclepius]], [[Joseph (Genesis)|Joseph]], [[Elijah]], and [[Sigurd|Siegfried]].{{sfn|Dundes|1980|page=235}}{{sfn|Eddy|Boyd|2007|page=31}} Dundes sees Jesus as a historical "miracle-worker" or "religious teacher", stories of whose life were told and retold through oral tradition so many times that they became [[legend]].{{sfn|Dundes|1980|pages=224–225, 325}}{{sfn|Eddy|Boyd|2007|page=314}} Dundes states that analyzing Jesus in the context of folklore helps explain some of the anomalies of the gospels, such as the fact that none of them give any information about Jesus’s childhood and adolescence,{{sfn|Dundes|1980|page=236}} which Dundes explains by the fact that this is "precisely the case for almost all heroes of tradition".{{sfn|Dundes|1980|page=236}} Other scholars have strongly criticized Dundes's application of the Rank-Raglan mythotype to Jesus,{{sfn|Wills|2005|page=228}}{{sfn|Blomart|2004|page=96}} pointing out that Dundes draws the narrative patterns from different texts written centuries apart, without taking care to differentiate between them.{{sfn|Wills|2005|page=228}}{{sfn|Blomart|2004|page=96}} Dundes's application has also been criticized due to the Rank-Raglan mythotype's artificial nature and its lack of specificity to Hellenistic culture.{{sfn|Blomart|2004|page=96}} Nonetheless, Lawrence M. Wills states that the "hero paradigm ''in some form'' does apply to the earliest lives of Jesus", albeit not to the extreme extent that Dundes has argued.{{sfn|Wills|2005|page=228}}

===Dying-and-rising god archetype===
[[File:JamesGeorgeFrazer.jpg|thumb|Photograph of [[James George Frazer|Sir James George Frazer]], the [[Anthropology|anthropologist]] who is most directly responsible for promoting the concept of a "dying and rising god" archetype{{sfn|Ehrman|2012|pages=222–223}}{{sfn|Barstad|1984|page=149}}{{sfn|Eddy|Boyd|2007|pages=142–143}}]]
{{main|Dying-and-rising deity}}
The late nineteenth-century Scottish [[Anthropology|anthropologist]] [[James George Frazer|Sir James George Frazer]] wrote extensively about the existence of a "dying-and rising god" archetype in his monumental study of comparative religion ''[[The Golden Bough]]'' (the first edition of which was published in 1890){{sfn|Ehrman|2012|pages=222–223}}{{sfn|Mettinger|2004|page=375}} as well as in later works.{{sfn|Barstad|1984|pages=149–150}} Frazer's main intention was to prove that all religions were fundamentally the same{{sfn|Ehrman|2012|page=222}} and that all the essential features of Christianity could be found in earlier religions.{{sfn|Barstad|1984|page=150}} Although Frazer himself did not explicitly claim that Jesus was a "dying-and-rising god" of the supposedly typical Near Eastern variety, he strongly implied it.{{sfn|Ehrman|2012|page=223}} Frazer's claims became widely influential in late-nineteenth- and early-twentieth-century scholarship of religion,{{sfn|Barstad|1984|page=149}}{{sfn|Eddy|Boyd|2007|pages=142–143}}{{sfn|Ehrman|2012|pages=222–223}} but are now mostly rejected modern scholars.{{sfn|Ehrman|2012|page=223}}{{sfn|Eddy|Boyd|2007|pages=142–143}}{{sfn|Mettinger|2004|pages=374–375}}

The main examples of "dying-and-rising gods" discussed by Frazer were the Mesopotamian god [[Dumuzid]]/Tammuz, his Greek equivalent [[Adonis]], the Phrygian god [[Attis]], and the Egyptian god [[Osiris]].{{sfn|Ehrman|2012|pages=222–223}}{{sfn|Mettinger|2004|page=375}}{{sfn|Barstad|1984|pages=149–150}} Dumuzid/Tammuz was a god of [[Sumer]]ian origin associated with vegetation and fertility who eventually came to be worshipped across the Near East.{{sfn|Ackerman|2006|page=116}} Dumuzid was associated with springtime agricultural fertility{{sfn|Ackerman|2006|page=116}}{{sfn|Jacobsen|2008|pages=83–84}} and, when the crops withered during the hot summer months, women would mourn over his death.{{sfn|Ackerman|2006|page=116}}{{sfn|Jacobsen|2008|pages=74–87}}{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=73}} Tammuz's categorization as a "dying-and-rising god" was based on the abbreviated Akkadian redaction of ''Inanna's Descent into the Underworld'', which was missing the ending.{{sfn|Eddy|Boyd|2007|pages=144}}{{sfn|Mettinger|2004|page=379}} Since numerous lamentations over the death of Dumuzid had already been translated, scholars filled in the missing ending by assuming that the reason for Ishtar's descent was because she was going to resurrect Dumuzid and that the text could therefore be assumed to end with Tammuz's resurrection.{{sfn|Eddy|Boyd|2007|pages=144}}

Then, in the middle of the twentieth century, the complete, unabridged, original Sumerian text of ''Inanna's Descent'' was finally translated,{{sfn|Eddy|Boyd|2007|pages=144}}{{sfn|Mettinger|2004|page=379}} revealing that, instead of ending with Dumuzid's resurrection as had long been assumed, the text actually ended with Dumuzid's ''death''.{{sfn|Eddy|Boyd|2007|pages=144}}{{sfn|Mettinger|2004|page=379}} The discovery of the ''Return of Dumuzid'' in 1963 briefly revived hopes that Dumuzid might once again be able to be categorized as a "dying-and-rising god",{{sfn|Eddy|Boyd|2007|pages=144}} but the text ultimately proved disappointing in this regard because it does not describe a triumph over death (as would be necessary for a true Frazerian "resurrection myth"){{sfn|Eddy|Boyd|2007|pages=144}}{{sfn|Smith|1987|pages=521–527}} and instead does precisely the opposite and affirms the "inalterable power of the realm of the dead" by the fact that Dumuzid can only leave the Underworld when his sister takes his place.{{sfn|Eddy|Boyd|2007|pages=144}}{{sfn|Smith|1987|pages=521–527}}

J.-P.

In the late twentieth century, scholars began to severely criticize the designation of "dying-and-rising god" altogether.{{sfn|Barstad|1984|pages=149–150}}{{sfn|Smith|1987|pages=521–527}}{{sfn|Mettinger|2004|page=374}} In 1987, [[Jonathan Z. Smith]] concluded in [[Mircea Eliade]]'s ''Encyclopedia of Religion'' that "The category of dying and rising gods, once a major topic of scholarly investigation, must now be understood to have been largely a misnomer based on imaginative reconstructions and exceedingly late or highly ambiguous texts."{{sfn|Smith|1987|pages=521–527}}{{sfn|Eddy|Boyd|2007|page=143}} He further argued that the deities previously referred to as "dying-and-rising" would be better termed separately as "dying gods" and "disappearing gods",{{sfn|Smith|1987|pages=521–527}}{{sfn|Mettinger|2004|page=374}} asserting that before Christianity, the two categories were distinct and gods who "died" did not return, and those who returned never truly "died".{{sfn|Smith|1987|pages=521–527}}{{sfn|Mettinger|2004|page=374}} By the end of the twentieth century, most scholars had come to agree that the notion of a "dying-and-rising god" was an invention{{sfn|Ehrman|2012|page=223}}{{sfn|Eddy|Boyd|2007|pages=142–143}}{{sfn|Mettinger|2004|pages=374–375}} and that the term was not a useful scholarly designation.{{sfn|Ehrman|2012|page=223}}{{sfn|Eddy|Boyd|2007|pages=142–143}}{{sfn|Mettinger|2004|pages=374–375}}

'''Joel Elias Spingarn''' (May 17, 1875 &amp;ndash; July 26, 1939) was an American [[educator]], [[literary critic]], and [[African-American Civil Rights Movement (1896–1954)|civil rights]] [[activist]].

==Biography==
Spingarn was born in [[New York City]] to an upper middle-class [[Jewish]] family. His younger brother was [[Arthur B. Spingarn]]. He graduated from [[Columbia College of Columbia University|Columbia College]] in 1895. He grew committed to the importance of the study of comparative literature as a discipline distinct from the study of English or any other language-based literary studies.

Politics was one of his lifetime passions. In 1908, as a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] he ran unsuccessfully for a seat in the [[U.S. House of Representatives]]. In 1912 and 1916, he was a delegate to the national convention of the [[Progressive Party (United States, 1912)|Progressive Party]]. At the first of those conventions, he failed in his attempts to add a statement condemning [[racial discrimination]] to the party platform.

He served as [[professor]] of [[comparative literature]] at [[Columbia University]] from 1899 to 1911. His academic publishing established him as one of America's foremost comparativists. It included two editions of ''A History of Literary Criticism in the Renaissance'' in 1899 and 1908 as well as edited works like ''Critical Essays of the Seventeenth-Century'' in 3 volumes. He summarized his philosophy in ''The New Criticism: A Lecture Delivered at Columbia University, March 9, 1910''.&lt;ref&gt;(NY: Columbia University Press, 1911)&lt;/ref&gt; There he argued against the constraints of such traditional categories as genre, theme, and historical setting in favor of viewing each work of art afresh and on its own terms.&lt;ref&gt;Marvin A. Carlson, ''Theories of the Theatre: A Historical and Critical Survey from the Greeks to the Present'' (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 1984, 311-2&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1904, his role in academic politics marked him as an independent spirit—too independent for the university's autocratic president [[Nicholas Murray Butler]]. His differences with the administration ranged from personality conflicts to educational philosophy. Things came to a head in 1910, when he offered a resolution at a university faculty meeting in support of [[Harry Thurston Peck]], a Columbia professor who had been summarily dismissed by Butler because of a public scandal involving a breach-of-promise suit. That precipitated Spingarn's dismissal just five weeks later.&lt;ref&gt;Michael, Rosenthal, ''Nicholas Miraculous: The Amazing Career of the Redoubtable Dr. Nicholas Murray Butler'' (NY: Farrar, Straus and Giroux, 2006), 209ff.&lt;/ref&gt; He became part of a distinguished series of prominent academics who resigned or were dismissed during Butler's tenure as president, including [[George Edward Woodberry]], [[Charles A. Beard|Charles Beard]], and [[James Harvey Robinson]].

Without an academic appointment but of independent means, Spingarn continued to publish in his field much as he had before, writing, editing, and contributing to collections of essays. He was commissioned in the [[U.S. Army]] and served as a [[major]] during [[World War I]].&lt;ref&gt;NNDB: [http://www.nndb.com/people/466/000114124/ Joel Elias Spingarn]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1919 he was a co-founder of the publishing firm of [[Harcourt Trade Publishers|Harcourt, Brace and Company]].

He also took up the other cause of his life, racial justice. An influential [[American liberalism|liberal]] Republican, he helped realize the concept of a unified black movement by joining the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP) shortly after its founding and was one of the first Jewish leaders of that organization, serving as chairman of its board from 1913 to 1919, its treasurer from 1919 to 1930, its second president from 1930 until his death in 1939. In 1914 he established the [[Spingarn Medal]], awarded annually by the NAACP for outstanding achievement by an [[African American]]. During World War I, according to an NAACP publication, he was instrumental in seeing that "a training camp for Negro officers at [[Des Moines]] was established and about 1,000 Negro officers commissioned."&lt;ref&gt;''The Crisis'': [https://books.google.com/books?id=NlsEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA269&amp;lpg=PA269#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false "President Spingarn Dies,"] Sept., 1939&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal and death==
Always interested in [[gardening]], in the years following 1920 he amassed the world's largest collection of [[clematis]]—250 species—and published the results of his research on the early history of [[landscape gardening]] and [[horticulture]] in [[Dutchess County, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;New York Botanical Garden: [http://library.nybg.org/finding_guide/archv/spingarn_ppb.html Joel Elias Spingarn Papers]&lt;/ref&gt; He served as a member of the Board of Managers for the [[New York Botanical Garden]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://library.nybg.org/finding_guide/archv/spingarn_ppb.html|title= Joel Elias Spingarn Papers (PP)|publisher =  The New York Botanical Garden.|accessdate= May 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He lived with his wife, Amy Einstein Spingarn, in [[Manhattan]] and at their country estate which later became the Troutbeck Inn and Conference Center&lt;ref&gt;Troutbeck: [http://www.troutbeck.com/history.htm History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080201095729/http://www.troutbeck.com/history.htm |date=2008-02-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Amenia, New York]]. They had two sons, including [[Stephen J. Spingarn]], and two daughters.

He died after a long illness on July 26, 1939. His will included a bequest to fund the [[Spingarn Medal]] in perpetuity.

==Recognition==

During most of the 20th century [[photography]] depended mainly upon the photochemical technology of silver halide emulsions on [[Photographic plate|glass plates]] or [[roll film]].&lt;ref name="langfordstory"&gt;Langford, Michael. ''Story of Photography''. Focal Press, 1998, pp.&amp;nbsp;224. {{ISBN|978-0-240-51483-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Early in the 21st century this technology was displaced by the electronic technology of [[digital camera]]s. The development of digital [[image sensor]]s, [[microprocessor]]s, [[memory card]]s, miniaturised devices and [[Graphics software|image editing]] software enabled these cameras to offer their users a much wider range of operating options than was possible with the older silver halide technology.&lt;ref name="busch"&gt;Busch, David D.

** George Finley is a military artist who was the commander of the [[74th U.S. Army Field Artillery Detachment]], supporting [[Missile Wing 1]] of the German Air Force. In 1988, the Blackjack Pershing Chapter of the United States Field Artillery Association commissioned a painting to commemorate the decommissioning of the Pershing system. 501 signed prints of ''The Final Countdown'' were created. The print is now available for sale again through his website.

**Tsereteli created a sculpture using sections of scrapped US Pershing and Soviet SS-20 nuclear missiles. The sculpture, entitled Good Defeats Evil is a 39 foot high, 40 ton monumental bronze statue of St George fighting the dragon of nuclear war. It was donated to the UN by the Soviet Union in 1990 and placed on the grounds of the UN headquarters in New York City. A series of works based on the sculpture that also incorporated scrap from the missiles were released in a limited series of 160 each.

==Memorabilia==
===World Memorial Fund for Disaster Relief===
[[Leonard Cheshire]] created the World Memorial Fund for Disaster Relief in 1990. The charity obtained Pershing and SS-20 scrap material and created memorabilia for fund raising.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="34643">'''Pro Set''' was a Dallas-based company founded by Ludwell Denny in 1988. Denny had gained a card license that year after making and selling other NFL memorabilia in previous years. His licensing agreement with NFL Properties allowed Denny to gain access to its extensive photo library&lt;ref name="lat920503"&gt;{{cite news|author=ARNIE STAPLETON | agency= ASSOCIATED PRESS |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-05-03/sports/sp-1730_1_football-cards |title=Now He's Holding a Lot of the Cards |work= Los Angeles Times |date=1992-05-03 |accessdate=2012-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and become the first card maker officially associated with a professional sports league. Across the bottom of most of his company's cards was its designation as "The Official NFL Card," a distinction it held through 1991.

The first year that Pro Set released a product was 1989. The year marked the beginning of the modern era for pro football cards. [[Pinnacle Brands|Score]] (who had entered the market the year before with baseball) also released a football product. For several years, Pro Set flooded the market with its product. The company managed to produce football sets through 1993 and in 1994, but Pro Set folded, due to Chapter 7 bankruptcy, citing more than $800,000 in unpaid royalties to the [[NFLPA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://beta.beckett.com/group/223641/Manufacturer/Collection/Pro-Set/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100413144715/http://beta.beckett.com/group/223641/Manufacturer/Collection/Pro%2DSet/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2010-04-13 |title=Sports Cards Price Guide Subscriptions, Values, Trading, Organize &amp;#124; Beckett.com |publisher=Beta.beckett.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pro Set made rookie cards of actual rookies (notably draft picks) and offered more color and action shots than Topps did. Pro Set claimed to have its own printing presses for its product, which could make and issue cards very quickly. For its first football card set in 1989, Pro Set released its cards in three series. The 1989 rookies were found primarily in the second series. Key rookies in the set included [[Troy Aikman]], [[Barry Sanders]], [[Derrick Thomas]], [[Jeff Lageman]] and [[Deion Sanders]]. The 100 card Series II set was sold in packs, but the packs averaged 11 Series I cards and 4 Series II cards per pack. These cards not only featured first round picks but featured later round picks. These cards were labelled as Pro Set Prospects.&lt;ref name="awesome"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.awesome80s.com/Awesome80s/Sports/Memorabilia/Cards/Football/1989/Pro_Set.asp |title=1989 Pro Set Football Cards |publisher=Awesome80s.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At its peak, Pro Set had a {{convert|44000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} headquarters{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}, where 225 employees designed various cards. In 1992, Pro Set forecasted sales of $165 million. A free magazine was published by Pro Set called the Pro Set Gazette. It was mailed to 1.2 million collectors twice a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://1990proset.blogspot.com/p/1990-pro-set-gazettes.html |title=1990 Pro Set: Building a Master Set: 1990 Pro Set Gazettes |publisher=1990proset.blogspot.com |date=2012-06-29 |accessdate=2012-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beckett Publications noted that in 1991, sports cards grossed about $1.9 billion in sales in North America, so Pro Set had a dramatic impact, albeit briefly.

==Insert Cards==

===Football===
There were a number of inserts in 1989 Pro Set football, including a 30 card subset of broadcasters. There were also Super Bowl insert cards for each game that had been played. There was also a card for NFL Commissioner Pete Rozelle. Pro Set introduced an insert card for [[Santa Claus]] that was labelled as a coach card. The first year it was released was in 1989 and it was a dealer premium. It was inserted in packs in 1990 and 1991. The Santa Claus cards included Pro Set founder Ludwell Denny somewhere in the card.&lt;ref name="awesome"/&gt; On the back of each Santa card is a parody of the poem "The Night Before Christmas" that has sportscard subject matter.&lt;ref name="sca90"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sportscardarticles.com/football_cards/1990_pro_set_football.htm |title=1990 Pro Set Football Cards |publisher=Sportscardarticles.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pro Set included other [[insert cards]] in its 1990 offering, such as [[Payne Stewart]], a comic book character called Super Pro, which was a superhero in a football uniform, a tribute to the late Joe Robbie, and the Lombardi Trophy Hologram card.&lt;ref name="sca90"/&gt;

==Error cards==

===Football===
The 1990 Pro Set football card release has several errors and variations. Due to a contractual dispute, and his unwillingness to join the NFPLA, the Pro Bowl card of Eric Dickerson (No. 338) was withdrawn early creating a short print.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://1990proset.blogspot.com/p/1990-pro-set-printing-variations.html |title=1990 Pro Set: Building a Master Set: 1990 Pro Set Printing Variations |publisher=1990proset.blogspot.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Card #338 would be reissued with Ludwell Denny on the front and it was a promotional card not available in packs.&lt;ref name="sca90"/&gt; Card #75 in the set was meant to be Browns Center Cody Risien, but the card was withdrawn early due to his retirement during training camp, also resulting in a short print.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130124161443/http://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=799&amp;dat=19900728&amp;id=IoxPAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=xVEDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4083,2576598]&lt;/ref&gt; The most sought after variation from 1990 Pro Set is card #204 Fred Marion of the New England Patriots. This card is rather controversial because the card features San Francisco 49ers player John Taylor in the background and the belt from Taylor's pants came undone. The positioning of the belt gives the appearance that his private area is exposed, but it is just a shadow and the belt.

Various cards in the 1990 offering have three variations. They are as follows:
*Card 15: Walter Stanley, the number on the back of the card is 87.
*Card 134: Andre Rison, traded stripe on front, message Are You Missing Something is on the back
*Card 161: Art Shell, the birthdate of 11/26/46 is on the back, small HOF print in banner on front&lt;ref name="sca90"/&gt;
*There were multiple Team Draft Day varieties of Jeff George. He was featured in his Illinois Fightin’ Illini uniform. One version had the Patriots logo on the front of the card. Another version was randomly inserted in packs of Series 1 football, and featured the card, but with the Indianapolis Colts logo.

==Of note==
*After the launch of football, Pro Set issued a 100-card PGA Tour set in 1990. The set included members of the Senior Tour and was issued as a complete set. This was the first time that Pro Set issued complete sets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/28765855.html?dids=28765855:28765855&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=Oct+26%2C+1990&amp;author=John+Leptich&amp;pub=Chicago+Tribune+(pre-1997+Fulltext)&amp;desc=Pro+Set+takes+to+the+fairways&amp;pqatl=google |title=Pro Set takes to the fairways |publisher=Pqasb.pqarchiver.com |date=1990-10-26 |accessdate=2012-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Pro Set offered cards in various languages. In 1991, Pro Set featured football cards in Spanish, hockey cards in French and soccer cards in the King's English.
*Ludwell Denny was trying to syndicate a television show called "Profiles," an entertainment newsmagazine for memorabilia collectors. The show had a trial run in Dallas-Fort Worth and other parts of Texas.&lt;ref name="lat920503"/&gt;
*As part of their 1991 Series I set, Pro Set issued a card of the 1990 Heisman Trophy winner, Brigham Young Quarterback Ty Detmer. However, Detmer had won the Trophy during his junior year and returned to BYU for his senior year in 1991. This created a mild controversy as it was one of the first times an active NCAA player was featured in a card set of professional athletes.
*In 1991, Pro Set issued a card of Notre Dame star Raghib "Rocket" Ismail, despite the fact that he signed with the Canadian Football League's Toronto Argonauts. 1991  Pro Set's NFL Series I featured Ismail on card number 36, honoring him as the Walter Camp Player of the Year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/61274650.html?dids=61274650:61274650&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=Apr+28%2C+1991&amp;author=RUTH+SADLER&amp;pub=Los+Angeles+Times+(pre-1997+Fulltext)&amp;desc=Ismail's+Defection+Cost+Some+Companies+an+Ace+Collecting%3A+Trading-card+manufacturers+split+over+whether+photo+of+Notre+Dame+great+should+be+offered+with+regular+NFL+series+after+his+decision+to+sign+with+a+Canadian+team.&amp;pqatl=google |title=Los Angeles Times: Archives - Ismail's Defection Cost Some Companies an Ace Collecting: Trading-card manufacturers split over whether photo of Notre Dame great should be offered with regular NFL series after his decision to sign with a Canadian team |publisher=Pqasb.pqarchiver.com |date=1991-04-28 |accessdate=2012-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 1992, Pro Set created a 100 card set based on the [[Guinness Book of World Records]]. Each card was 3½x2½ inches. The cards were available in Canada, the United States, Australia, South Africa and Great Britain.The first card featured Cosmoclock 21 at Yokohama, Japan. Card 100 showed Mike Powell at the 1991 World Athletics Championships in Tokyo. Cards 1-43 were classified as "Facts and Feats", while cards 44-84 are "Natural &amp; Human World", and cards 85-100 are "Sports &amp; Games".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://guinness.book-of-records.info/misc.html |title=Guinness Record Book Collecting |publisher=Guinness.book-of-records.info |date=1979-07-30 |accessdate=2012-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*After disappearing in the 1960s, the Parkhurst hockey card brand was resuscitated in 1991 by Dr. Brian H. Price and licensed to Pro Set. After the hockey card explosion of 1990–91, Parkhurst cards were back in the marketplace. Pro Set promoted Parkhurst as a premium brand of cards. Series I and Series II were available in both English and French and featured the [[rookie card]]s of players such as [[Dominik Hašek|Dominik Hasek]] and [[John LeClair]]. The 1991–92 Update Set was the final release of the year and was the most valuable of all three sets. One of the key rookie cards of that set was of Bill Guerin.

When Pro Set, Inc. entered Chapter Eleven bankruptcy protection prior to the 1992–93 NHL season, Price traveled weekly from Toronto to Dallas and became the unofficial hockey brand manager. The second year of Parkhurst (1992–93) was the last with Pro Set as the company went bankrupt and Price took his Parkhurst tradename and license to the [[Upper Deck]] Company, an agreement which began with the 1993–94 season.

*In August 1992, Pro Set replaced its founder Ludwell Denny at the insistence of its lenders. Denny was replaced with a San Francisco based turnaround expert. Robert J. McLaughlin became Pro Set's chief executive officer, with the task of resolving the obligations to its lenders, licensors and trade creditors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=DM&amp;p_theme=dm&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0ED3D259086DAA87&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM |title=Archives &amp;#124; The Dallas Morning News, dallasnews.com |publisher=Nl.newsbank.com |date=1992-08-07 |accessdate=2012-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In December 1994, the National Football League asked Federal authorities to investigate investments made by two former N.F.L. Properties presidents due to their affiliation with Pro Set. The NFL’s special properties committee appointed by Commissioner Paul Tagliabue and the properties executive committee requested the investigation into Pro Set. The United States Attorney for the Southern District of New York was assigned to handle the investigation.
The allegations were based on investments made by former NFL Properties presidents, John Flood, (who was dismissed in March 1994), and his predecessor, John Bello, who quit in September 1993. Neither Flood nor Bello told the league they had set up companies to invest in Pro-Set Press, a printer partly owned by the Pro Set trading card company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Published: December 17, 1994 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/12/17/sports/pro-football-nfl-asks-for-investigation.html?n=Top/Reference/Times%20Topics/Subjects/F/Football |title=PRO FOOTBALL; N.F.L.

'''''S v Mtewtwa'''''&lt;ref&gt;1977 (3) SA 628 (E).&lt;/ref&gt; is an important case in South African criminal law, dealing with the defence of compulsion. The accused, in custody, was threatened by a warder with solitary confinement unless he committed a criminal act. The court considered what State must prove in such circumstances in order to obtain a conviction.

The court held that, where an accused's defence is one of compulsion, the onus lies on the State to show that a reasonable man would have resisted the compulsion. There is no onus on the accused to satisfy the court that he acted under compulsion.

Specifically, where a person is in custody and is threatened by a warder with solitary confinement, then, held the court, at the very least the State must show that the accused could reasonably have complained to the prison authorities of the warder's wrongful conduct and that such complaint would have averted the threatened confinement.

'''Simplifydigital''' was founded in 2007 by two ex-Sky senior sales and marketing executives, Charlie Ponsonby and Lawrence Bleach.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.growingbusiness.co.uk/simplifydigital-launches-with-2-4m.html Simplifydigital launches with £2.4m] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720173912/http://www.growingbusiness.co.uk/simplifydigital-launches-with-2-4m.html |date=20 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It owns and operates the UK’s largest and fastest growing “triple play” (TV, broadband, home phone) comparison sales platform.  The platform is used by Simplifydigital’s own branded business and by a number of blue chip retail clients who want to offer broadband switching to their customers.  These include: [[Barclays]], [[Dixons Carphone]], [[Sainsbury's|S]]ainsbury, and [[Comparethemarket.com]].

The platform enables brands to offer a unique customer proposition designed to make TV, broadband and home phone switching easier. Consumers can switch online, via a mobile device or speak to an expert for free receiving Ofcom accredited, impartial advice to find the best deal and a free Switching Support service to ensure a switch with minimum of fuss.

Simplifydigital is rapidly expanding into the wider home services market in the UK enabled by a technology led culture of rapid innovation.  It launched energy switching in late 2015 via a revolutionary new energy switching app called Voltz which is available on Android and iOS.  The app enables users who may not have time to go online to switch energy providers, to easily move between energy providers with a couple of taps on their mobile.  Simplifydigital will launch mobile phone comparison in 2016.

Simplifydigital started Simplify Digital Web Services (SDWS) in 2010, to offer sales and retention SaaS to global TV, broadband, home phone and mobile telco companies faced with increasing pressures to attract and retain customers.  SDWS works with [[TalkTalk Group|TalkTalk]], [[EE Limited|EE]], [[Webhelp]] and others to provide software “plug-ins” to legacy CRM systems, to help contact centre agents sell and retain customers. 
   
Simplifydigital has received wide recognition for its rapid growth and has been named in the [[Sunday Times Tech Track 100]] and [[Deloitte Fast 50]] in 2013, 2014 and 2015; the GP Bullhound Media Momentum Awards in 2013; the [[Red Herring Top 100]] Europe and Global Top 100 in 2014; and named in the list of 1000 Companies to Inspire Britain in 2015.

In 2016, Simplifydigital was acquired by [[Dixons Carphone]].

'''''The Modern Cook''''' was the first cookery book by the [[Anglo-Italian]] cook [[Charles Elmé Francatelli]] (1805–1876). It was first published in 1846. It was popular for half a century in the [[Victorian era]], running through 29 London editions by 1896. It was also published in America.

The book offered elaborate dishes, described with [[French language|French]] terminology such as bisque, entrées, entremets, [[vol-au-vent]], timbale and soufflé. It included bills of fare for meals for up to 300 people, and for a series of eight- or nine-course dinners served to [[Queen Victoria]]; one exceptional royal dinner in 1841 had sixteen entrées and sixteen entremets, including [[truffles]] in [[Champagne]].

''The Modern Cook'' was the first to mention filling [[ice cream cone|wafer cones]] with [[ice cream]]. The book, written for upper middle-class housewives, is illustrated with 60 engravings, often showing how to present carefully-decorated centrepiece dishes such as "Salmon à la Chambord" for large dinner parties.

The book influenced households in Britain and America to aspire to more complex, French-style dinners in imitation of the Queen, and resulted in a change in eating habits, including the modern two-course approach for both lunch and dinner.

==Context==

[[Charles Elmé Francatelli]], from an Italian family, was born in London in 1805, and learnt cookery in France. Coming to England, he worked for various aristocrats before becoming chief chef of [[Crockford's (club)|Crockford's club]] and then chief cook to [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] in 1840.&lt;ref&gt;Account books of the Lord Steward of the Royal Household for 1840-42, National Archive, Kew, refs. LS 2/66, LS 2/67 and LS 2/68&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to work at Crockford's again, at the Coventry House and [[Reform Club]]s, St James's Hotel, and for the [[Prince of Wales|Prince and Princess of Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;Colin Smythe, "Charles Elmé Francatelli, Crockford's and the Royal Connection" in ''[[Petits Propos Culinaires]]'' 101 (2014), pp. 42–67, and "Charles Elmé Francatelli, Additions &amp; Supplementations" in ''Petits Propos Culinaires'' 102 (2015), pp. 100–118&lt;/ref&gt; This made him a celebrity cook of his time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Charles Elme Francatelli|url=http://www.thecooksguide.com/articles/francatelli.html|publisher=The Cook's Guide|accessdate=18 January 2016|date=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Approach===
[[File:Francatelli Salmis of Partridges with Aspic Jelly.jpg|thumb|300px|"Salmis of Partridges with Aspic Jelly"]]

Apart from the preface and Francatelli's advice on serving wine, the body of the book consists almost entirely of recipes without any kind of introduction. There is no guidance on choice of kitchenware or advice on the layout of the kitchen.&lt;ref name=Francatelli/&gt;

The recipes are presented entirely as instructions, generally without illustration.{{efn|Of the 1462 recipes in the 28th edition, only 60 are illustrated.}} Quantities, where stated, are incorporated in the text; ingredients are never listed explicitly. Quantities are sometimes named, as in the "Cream Bechamel Sauce", which begins "Put six ounces of fresh butter into a middle-sized stewpan; add four ounces of sifted flour, some nutmeg, a few peppercorns, and a little salt;". In other cases only the relative proportions are indicated, as for the "Salmis of Partridges with Aspic Jelly", where the only hint of quantity in the recipe is "must be mixed with one-third of its quantity of aspic jelly". This recipe also indicates the style of cross-referencing, with the starting instruction "Prepare the salmis as directed in No. 1078".&lt;ref name=Francatelli/&gt;

''The Modern Cook'' is the first published record in England of filling wafer cornets, which Francatelli called ''gauffres'',  with [[ice cream]]. He used them to garnish his iced puddings.&lt;ref name=Day&gt;{{cite web|last1=Day|first1=Ivan|title=Wafer Making|url=http://www.historicfood.com/Wafer.htm|publisher=Historic Food|accessdate=18 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Illustrations===
[[File:Francatelli Salmon a la Chambord.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|"Salmon à la Chambord"]]

The 28th edition is illustrated with 60, mostly small, engravings. There is a full-page frontispiece of the author, drawn by [[Auguste Hervieu]] and engraved by [[Samuel Freeman (engraver)|Samuel Freeman]] (1773–1857).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Auguste Hervieu (active 1819-1858)|url=http://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/person/mp07099/auguste-hervieu|publisher=National Portrait Gallery|accessdate=17 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Freeman is known for working mainly in [[stipple]], and the portrait here is no exception.&lt;ref&gt;{{DNB|prescript=|wstitle=Freeman, Samuel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All the other engravings are of completed dishes, showing the serving-plate with the food arranged on it and often elaborately garnished. The artists and engravers of the food illustrations are not identified.&lt;ref name=Francatelli/&gt;

===Bills of fare===
[[File:Francatelli Bill of Fare Dinner for 6 Persons.jpg|thumb|left|A Bill of Fare for a dinner for 6 persons]]

Francatelli provides "A Series of Bills of Fare for Every Month Throughout the Year", including dinners variously for 6, 8, 10, 12, 14 16, 18, 20, 24, 28 and 36 persons (though not all of these in every month). The bills of fare for dinners for 6 persons thus represent the simplest menus in the book. All the dinners are divided into a first and a second "Course", but each course was divided in turn into three or four servings, in most cases with a choice of two or more dishes. Thus there might be one or two soups, two fishes, two "removes" of meat, and two savoury "entrées" in the first "Course", with a second "Course" of one kind of game, followed by a choice of three "entremets" which included both savouries, generally vegetables, and desserts.&lt;ref name=Francatelli/&gt;

There is a single bill of fare for a "Ball Supper for 300 Persons", and one for a "Public Dinner" for the same number.&lt;ref name=Francatelli/&gt;

[[File:Francatelli Bill of Fare Her Majesty's Dinner.jpg|thumb|A Bill of Fare for a dinner for Her Majesty [[Queen Victoria]]]]

There are 13 bills of fare for "Her Majesty's Dinner", each with an exact date in 1841 and the words "(''Under the control of C. Francatelli.'')". Each of the royal dinners has either eight or nine courses (including a buffet or sideboard), except for that of 30 June which is divided into two "Services" and has 11 courses.&lt;ref name=Francatelli/&gt;

The royal dinners are described almost entirely in French, with the exception of the heading, the phrase "Side Board", and a few specifically British dishes such as "Roast Mutton" and "Haunch of Venison". There are usually two soups, two fishes, two removes, six entrées, two roasts, two more removes, six entremets, and between two and seven dishes on the sideboard. The exceptional royal dinner of 30 June 1841 had sixteen entrées and sixteen entremets. Some of these entremets used the most costly ingredients including [[truffles]] in [[Champagne]].&lt;ref name=Francatelli/&gt;

===Contemporary===
[[File:Francatelli Aspic of Fowl a la Reine.jpg|thumb|upright|"[[Aspic]] of Fowl a la Reine"]]

''Kettner's Book of the Table'' of 1877, describing Francatelli as "a type of all the great French cooks", asserted that he "gives a most elaborate recipe for [[aspic]] jelly; and he is so satisfied with it that, having to prepare a cold supper for 300 people, he works it up in every one of his 56 dishes which are neither sweet nor hot. The book further argues that "this is the result of science—this the height of art. It produces, with such elaborate forms and majestic ceremonies, an aspic jelly without aspic, that, exhausted in the effort, it can proceed no further, and seems to think that here at last, in this supreme sauce, we have a sure resting-place—the true blessedness—the ''ewigkeit''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dallas |first1=Eneas Sweetland |title=Kettner's Book of the Table |date=1877 |publisher=Dulau and Co |location=London |url=http://www.forgottenbooks.com/download_pdf/Kettners_Book_of_the_Table_1000154226.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

George H. Ellwanger wrote in his ''Pleasures of the Table'' in 1902 that Francatelli's ''Modern Cook'' was "still a superior treatise, and although little adapted to the average household, it will well repay careful study on the part of the expert amateur. 'The palate is as capable and nearly as worthy of education as the eye and the ear,' says Francatelli — a statement which his volume abundantly bears out." He added that "one sees, accordingly, an ornate observance of decoration in his grand army of side-dishes. These are excellent throughout, but generally very elaborate, while his sauces and recipes for pastry are especially good. The same may be said of his [[quenelle]]s and [[Timbale (food)|timbale]]s. A competent hand will find his work a valuable guide from which to obtain ideas; it is not a practical book for the majority."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ellwanger |first1=George H. |title=The pleasures of the table; an account of gastronomy from ancient days to present times. With a history of its literature, schools, and most distinguished artists; together with some special recipes, and views concerning the aesthetics of dinners and dinner-giving |date=1902 |publisher=Doubleday |location=New York |page=208 |url=https://archive.org/details/cu31924001923386}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''New Zealand Herald'' of 1912 commented that Francatelli was "an earnest and gifted worker in the cause of [[gastronomy]]" and that ''The Modern Cook'' faithfully reflected Victorian dining habits. "Everything was good and solid of its kind, even if tending towards complication rather than simplicity." The review opined that the great joints of meat "decorated with their silver hatelet skewers bearing cock's combs and trufflets, were attended by the most appetizing ragouts and garnishes." Despite the gloss, there was "nothing meretricious or deceptive in the savoury promises held out by Victorian comestibles." The reviewer notes, however, that even while Francatelli was describing this elaborate fare, the "excessive meat-eating" was being replaced by a diet richer in vegetables, and meals were becoming simpler, so that "now, in the 20th century, much that Francatelli wrote about ... is no longer needed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title="The Modern Cook"|journal=New Zealand Herald|date=20 January 1912|volume=XLIX|issue=14894|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern===

[[M. F. K. Fisher]], writing in ''[[The New York Times]]'', stated that millions of American women in the 19th century organised "every aspect of their lives .. as much as possible in imitation of the Queen", and that ''The Modern Cook'' sold almost as well in America as it did in England. Admitting that few American kitchens could "follow all its directions for the light Gallic dainties Francatelli introduced to counteract the basic heaviness of royal dining habits", she argued that all the same his two-course approach eventually shaped the way Americans now eat both lunch and dinner. She observed that at [[Windsor Castle]], Francatelli and other royal chefs were assisted by 24 assistant chefs and two "Yeomen of the Kitchen", not to mention a multitude of "servers and lackeys". This did not deter American housewives "as far west as Iowa and then beyond" from doing their best to follow his instructions.&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fisher|first1=M. F. K.|title=Food: The Arts (Fine and Culinary) of 19th Century America|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/01/18/home/fisher-19th.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=18 January 2016|date=15 September 1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Historic Food'' website notes that Francatelli provides two recipes for [[mincemeat]], one with roast beef, the other containing lemons but no meat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bake Metes and Mince Pies|url=http://www.historicfood.com/Pie%20recipe2.htm|publisher=Historic Food|accessdate=18 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

C. Anne Wilson, introducing ''Women and Victorian Values, 1837-1910. Advice Books, Manuals and Journals for Women'', states that Francatelli was writing for the "upper middle-class housewife" in ''The Modern Cook'', explaining to her how to serve the "socially important" dinner in English, French and "à la Russe" styles. In contrast, his 1861 ''Cook's Guide'' is for "more ordinary" households, advocating "traditional two-course dinners".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wilson|first1=C.

Nick Baines writes on ''LoveFood'' that Francatelli included "a whole collection of lavish pies" in the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Baines|first1=Nick|title=What makes the perfect pie?|url=http://www.lovefood.com/journal/features/15353/the-perfect-pie|publisher=LoveFood|accessdate=18 January 2016|date=22 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Panikos Panayi]], in his book ''Spicing Up Britain'', writes that Francatelli's book for the middle classes definitely recognised differences between British and foreign foods, even in its full title which ran "&lt;!--both quote and italictitle--&gt;''...Comprising, in Addition to English Cookery, the Most Advanced and Recherché Systems of French, Italian and German Cookery''". Panayi notes that Francatelli's preface to the first edition was scathing about ignorant "English writers on gastronomy", comparing them unfavourably to the "great Professors" of cuisine in France. Panayi observes further that while most of Francatelli's chapters are not grouped by national origin, he does distinguish English, Foreign, and Italian soups. He notes that it would have taken years to eat all the dishes listed, and that it is impossible to tell how often middle-class families may have eaten "fillets of haddocks, à la royale". He considers it likely that only the wealthiest could have aspired to eat the sort of food described by Francatelli, but concedes that his bills of fare for dinners for six persons (by month) do indicate that the middle classes could afford the best meat and vegetables, and indeed that they had domestic staff able to prepare dinners of that complexity described in Francatelli's French terminology. Panayi concludes that Francatelli represents "perhaps the most extreme example" of the nineteenth century British habit of giving dishes French descriptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Panayi, Panikos |year=2010 |origyear=2008 |title=Spicing Up Britain |publisher=Reaktion Books |isbn=978-1-86189-658-2 |pages=22–23, 25, 81, 102–103, 116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The White Goddess: a Historical Grammar of Poetic Myth''''' is a book-length essay on the nature of poetic myth-making by author and poet [[Robert Graves]]. First published in 1948, the book is based on earlier articles published in ''[[Wales (magazine)|Wales]]'' magazine, corrected, revised and enlarged editions appeared in 1948, 1952 and 1961. ''The White Goddess'' represents an approach to the study of [[mythology]] from a decidedly creative and idiosyncratic perspective. Graves proposes the existence of a European [[deity]], the "White Goddess of Birth, Love and Death", much similar to the ''[[Mother Goddess]]'', inspired and represented by the phases of the [[moon]], who lies behind the faces of the diverse goddesses of various European and [[pagan]] mythologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.overdrive.com/media/1266442/the-white-goddess|title=The White Goddess|website=OverDrive|access-date=2018-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Graves argues that "true" or "pure" poetry is inextricably linked with the ancient cult-ritual of his proposed White Goddess and of her son.

Many of the book's themes are also explored in a fictional form, through his depiction of a future society dominated by Great Goddess religion in the 1949 novel ''[[Seven Days in New Crete]]''.

== History ==
Graves first wrote the book under the title of ''The Roebuck in the Thicket'' in a three-week period during January 1944, only a month after finishing ''The Golden Fleece''. He then left the book to focus on ''King Jesus,'' a historical novel about the life of Jesus. Returning to ''The Roebuck in the Thicket'', he renamed it ''The Three-Fold Muse'', before finishing it and retitling it as ''The White Goddess''. In January 1946 he sent it to the publishers, and in May 1948 it was published in the UK, and in June 1948 in the US, as ''The White Goddess: a Historical Grammar of Poetic Myth''.&lt;ref name="Hutton"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Modern Pagan Witchcraft|publisher=Oxford University Press |location= |author=Hutton, Ronald|pages=188–189 |year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Poetry and myth ==
Graves described ''The White Goddess'' as "a historical grammar of the language of poetic [[mythology|myth]]". The book draws from the mythology and poetry of Wales and Ireland especially, as well as that of most of Western Europe and the ancient Middle East. Relying on arguments from [[etymology]] and the use of forensic techniques to uncover what he calls 'iconotropic' redaction of original myths, Graves argues for the worship of a single goddess under many names, an idea that came to be known as "[[Matriarchal religion]]" in [[feminist theology]] of the 1970s.

''[[The Golden Bough]]'' (1922, but first edition published 1890), an early anthropological study by Sir [[James George Frazer]], is the starting point for much of Graves's argument, and Graves thought in part that his book made explicit what Frazer only hinted at. Graves wrote: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Sir James Frazer was able to keep his beautiful rooms at [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] until his death by carefully and methodically sailing all around his dangerous subject, as if charting the coastline of a forbidden island without actually committing himself to a declaration that it existed. What he was saying-not-saying was that [[Christian legend]], [[Christian dogma|dogma]] and [[Christian sacraments|ritual]] are the refinement of a great body of primitive and even [[barbarian|barbarous]] beliefs, and that almost the only original element in Christianity is the personality of Jesus.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Graves's ''The White Goddess'' deals with [[goddess|goddess worship]] as the prototypical religion, analysing it largely from literary evidence, in myth and poetry.

Graves admitted he was not a medieval historian, but a poet, and thus based his work on the premise that the
&lt;blockquote&gt;language of poetic myth anciently current in the Mediterranean and Northern Europe was a magical language bound up with popular religious ceremonies in honour of the Moon-goddess, or Muse, some of them dating from the Old Stone Age, and that this remains the language of true poetry...&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Graves concluded, in the second and expanded edition, that the male-dominant monotheistic god of [[Judaism]] and its successors were the cause of the White Goddess's downfall, and thus the source of much of the modern world's woe. He describes Woman as occupying a higher echelon than mere poet, that of the Muse Herself. He adds "This is not to say that a woman should refrain from writing poems; only, that she should write as a woman, not as an honorary man."  He seems particularly bothered by the spectre of women's writing reflecting male-dominated poetic conventions.&lt;ref&gt;Graves, The White Goddess, p. 446-447&lt;/ref&gt;

Graves derived some of his ideas from poetic inspiration and a process of "[[Analepsis|analeptic thought]]", which is a term he used for throwing one's mind back in time and receiving impressions.

Visual iconography was also important to Graves's conception. Graves created a methodology for reading images he called "iconotropy". To practice this methodology one is required to reduce "speech into its original images and rhythms" and then to combine these "on several simultaneous levels of thought". By applying this methodology Graves decoded a woodcut of ''[[Judgement of Paris|The Judgement of Paris]]'' as depicting a singular Triple Goddess&lt;ref&gt;Von Hendy, Andrew. ''The Modern Construction of Myth''. p.196.&lt;/ref&gt; rather than the traditional [[Hera]], [[Athena]] and [[Aphrodite]] of the narrative the image illustrates.

==Celtic Tree Calendar==
Graves also argues that the names of the [[Ogham]] letters in the alphabet used in parts of [[Goidelic|Gaelic]] Ireland and Britain contained a calendar that contained the key to an ancient [[liturgy]] involving the [[human sacrifice]] of a [[sacred king]], and, further, that these letter names concealed lines of [[Ancient Greek]] [[hexameter]] describing the goddess.

Graves' "Tree Calendar" has no relation to any historical [[Celtic calendar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| first =Peter Berresford | last =Ellis |   title=The Fabrication of 'Celtic' Astrology|journal=The Astrological Journal|volume=39|issue=issn.4|year=1997| url=http://cura.free.fr/xv/13ellis2.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
His interpretations rather rely on the book ''Ogygia'' by the 17th-century bard [[Roderick O'Flaherty]].

== Druantia ==
In ''The White Goddess'', Graves proposed a hypothetical [[Gauls|Gallic]] tree goddess, [[Druantia]], who has become somewhat popular with contemporary [[Paganism (contemporary)|Neopagans]]. Druantia is an archetype of the eternal mother as seen in the [[evergreen]] boughs. Her name is believed to be derived from the [[Celtic nations|Celtic]] word for [[oak]] trees, *{{lang|cel|drus}} or *{{lang|cel|deru}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Wisdom of Trees |author=Jane Gifford |year=2006 |publisher=Springer |isbn=1-397-81402-0 |page=146 }}&lt;/ref&gt; She is known as "Queen of the [[Druids]]". She is a goddess of fertility for both plants &amp; humans, ruling over sexual activities &amp; passion. She also rules protection of trees, knowledge, creativity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Celtic Magic |author=Deanna J. Conway |year=2006 |publisher=Llewellyn Publications |isbn=0-87542-136-9 |page=109 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
''The White Goddess'' has been seen as a poetic work where Graves gives his notion of man's subjection to women in love an "anthropological grandeur" and further mythologises all women in general (and several of Graves's lovers in specific) into a three-faced moon goddess model.&lt;ref&gt;Hunter, Jefferson (1983). "The Servant of Three Mistresses" (review of: Seymour-Smith, Martin, ''Robert Graves: His Life and Work''), in ''The Hudson Review'', Vol. 36, No. 4 (Winter, 1983–1984), pp. 733–736.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Graves's value as a poet aside, flaws in his scholarship such as poor [[philology]], use of inadequate texts and outdated archaeology have been criticised.&lt;ref name="wood"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wood|first=Juliette|title=The Concept of the Goddess|editor=Sandra Billington, Miranda Green|publisher=Routledge|year=1999|page=12|chapter=Chapter 1, The Concept of the Goddess|isbn=9780415197892|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IoW9yhkrFJoC&amp;lpg=PP10&amp;pg=PA10#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false|accessdate=23 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hutton|first=Ronald|title=The Pagan Religions of the Ancient British Isles: Their Nature and Legacy|publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]|year=1993|page=320|isbn=9780631189466|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wNpVJQAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars, particularly archaeologists, historians and folklorists have rejected the work&lt;ref name="paganism_reader"&gt;''The Paganism Reader''. p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt; – which [[T. S. Eliot]] called "A prodigious, monstrous, stupefying, indescribable book"&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in J. Kroll, ''Chapters in a Mythology'' (2007) p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; – and Graves himself was disappointed that his work was "loudly ignored" by many Celtic scholars.&lt;ref name="White"&gt;White, Donna R. ''A Century of Welsh Myth in Children's Literature''. p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, ''The White Goddess'' was accepted as history by many non-scholarly readers. According to [[Ronald Hutton]], the book "remains a major source of confusion about the ancient Celts and influences many un-scholarly views of Celtic paganism".&lt;ref name="Hutton-Pagan"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hutton|first=Ronald|title=The Pagan Religions of the Ancient British Isles: Their Nature and Legacy|publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]|year=1993|page=145|isbn=9780631189466|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wNpVJQAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hilda Ellis Davidson]] criticised Graves as having "misled many innocent readers with his eloquent but deceptive statements about a nebulous goddess in early Celtic literature", and stated that he was "no authority" on the subject matter he presented.&lt;ref name=DAVIDSONROLESOF&gt;Davidson, Hilda Ellis (1998). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=9IAyyYi0OC4C&amp;lpg=PA11&amp;pg=PA11#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Roles of the Northern Goddess]'', page 11. [[Routledge]]. {{ISBN|0-415-13611-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Graves made the association between Goddesses and the moon appear "natural", it was not so to the Celts or some other ancient peoples.&lt;ref name="Hutton-Pagan" /&gt; In response to critics, Graves accused literary scholars of being psychologically incapable of interpreting myth&lt;ref&gt;Inter alia – The White Goddess, Farrar Straus Giroux, p. 224. {{ISBN|0-374-50493-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; or too concerned with maintaining their perquisites to go against the majority view. (See Frazer quote.)

Some Neopagans have been bemused and upset by the scholarly criticism that ''The White Goddess'' has received in recent years,&lt;ref&gt;The Pomegranate 7.1, Equinox press, (Review of) "Jacob Rabinowitz, ''The Rotting Goddess: The Origin of the Witch in Classical Antiquity’s Demonization of Fertility Religion''."&lt;/ref&gt; while others have appreciated its poetic insight but never accepted it as a work of historical veracity.&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, James R. ''Magical Religion and Modern Witchcraft''. p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, a few scholars find some value in Graves' ideas; Michael W. Pharand, though quoting earlier criticisms, rebutted, "Graves's theories and conclusions, outlandish as they seemed to his contemporaries (or may appear to us), were the result of careful observation."&lt;ref&gt;Pharand, Michael W. "Greek Myths, White Goddess: Robert Graves Cleans up a 'Dreadful Mess'", in Ian Ferla and Grevel Lindop (ed), ''Graves and the Goddess: Essays on Robert Graves's The White Goddess''. Associated University Presses, 2003. p.188.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Graves' biographer [[Richard Perceval Graves]], [[Laura Riding]] played a crucial role in the development of Graves' thoughts when writing ''The White Goddess'', despite the fact the two were estranged at that point. On reviewing the book, Riding was furious, saying "Where once I reigned, now a whorish abomination has sprung to life, a Frankenstein pieced together from the shards of my life and thoughts."&lt;ref&gt;Lindop, Grevel, editor (1997) ''Robert Graves: The White Goddess: A Historical Grammar of Poetic Myth'', [[Carcanet Press]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary influences==
*The book was a major influence on the thinking of the poets [[Ted Hughes]] and [[Sylvia Plath]],&lt;ref&gt;J. Rose, ''The Haunting of Sylvia Plath'' (1991) p. 150&lt;/ref&gt; with the latter identifying to some extent with the goddess figure herself.&lt;ref&gt;J. Kroll, ''Chapters in a Mythology'' (2007) p. 42-6 and p. 81&lt;/ref&gt;  Arguably, however, what [[Jacqueline Rose]] called "the cliché behind the myth – woman as inspiration, woman as drudge" – ultimately had a negative impact upon her life and work.&lt;ref&gt;J. Rose, ''The Haunting of Sylvia Plath'' (1991) p. 153-4 and p. 163&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Trumpington Street''' is a major historic street in central [[Cambridge]], [[England]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cambridge.gov.uk/public/pdfs/Trumpington%20Street.pdf Trumpington Street], [[Cambridge City Council]]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927072827/http://www.cambridge.gov.uk/public/pdfs/Trumpington%20Street.pdf |date=27 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  At the north end it continues as [[King's Parade]] where [[King's College, Cambridge|King's College]] is located. To the south it continues as [[Trumpington Road]] (the [[A1134 road|A1134]]), an arterial route out of Cambridge, at the junction with [[Lensfield Road]].

== Notable buildings ==

The [[University of Cambridge]] colleges [[St Catharine's College, Cambridge|St Catharine's College]], [[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge|Corpus Christi College]], [[Pembroke College, Cambridge|Pembroke College]], and [[Peterhouse, Cambridge|Peterhouse]] are all on Trumpington Street. Pembroke College also fronts onto the adjoining [[Pembroke Street, Cambridge|Pembroke Street]]. Further south is [[Fitzwilliam Museum]], the main museum of the University. At the southern end is the main site of the [[Cambridge University Engineering Department]].

The [[Church of St Mary the Less, Cambridge]], is next to Peterhouse (just to the north) on the corner of Trumpington Street and Little St Mary's Lane. The first church here was called St Peter-without-Trumpington Gate.
The [[Emmanuel United Reformed Church, Cambridge|Emmanuel United Reformed Church]], built to a design of [[James Cubitt]] in 1875, is also located on Trumpington Street. The original church was in [[Downing Place]].

At the northern end on the corner of Corpus Christi College facing King's Parade is the [[Corpus Clock]], a new tourist attraction installed in 2008.

== History ==
[[File: CCCNC.jpg |right|thumb|upright=1|Corpus Christi College New Court seen from Trumpington Street.]]

In 1361, at Spittle End, the [[leper]] hospital of St Anthony and St Eligius was founded.&lt;ref name="800years"&gt;[http://www.strideguides.com/CU/Place.aspx?p=19&amp;ix=112&amp;pid=6&amp;prcid=27&amp;ppid=0 Trumpington Street] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716031819/http://www.strideguides.com/CU/Place.aspx?p=19&amp;ix=112&amp;pid=6&amp;prcid=27&amp;ppid=0 |date=16 July 2011 }}, ''800 Years of Death and Disease in Cambridge'', Stride Design Ltd, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Addenbrooke's Hospital]] was founded in 1766 on Trumpington Street, but it has since relocated to larger premises further out of the city. The [[Judge Business School]] is now on the original site of the hospital, the [[Old Addenbrooke's Site]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cam.ac.uk/map/v4/drawmap.cgi?mp=oadd;tl=Old%20Addenbrooke%27s%20Site Official Map: Old Addenbrooke's Site], [[University of Cambridge]], 800 Years 1209–2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the 19th century, Trumpington Street was at the edge of development to the south of Cambridge.&lt;ref name="800years" /&gt;

== Hobson's Conduit ==

The [[Hobson's Conduit#Trumpington Street branch|Trumpington Street branch]] of [[Hobson's Conduit]] still functions as [[sluice]]s along each side of the street. At this point, it is known as the Pem (east side) and Pot (west side).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://janus.lib.cam.ac.uk/db/node.xsp?id=Glossary%2FPot|title=Janus Glossary of terms: Pot}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Cambridge City Council]]'s Drainage Engineer controls flow through the sluices and generally lets water flow in the open conduits in the street between the months of April and September. Feeds run into Peterhouse and Pembroke College.

The U.S.P.Q. covers [[intellectual property]] cases including [[patent]]s, [[copyright]]s, [[trademark]]s, and [[trade secret]]s, from 1913 to the present. The publisher stopped the sequence of volume numbers and restarted with a second series, cited as U.S.P.Q. 2d (BNA), in 1987.

The U.S.P.Q. reports case law from the [[United States Supreme Court]] and most federal appeals courts, including the [[Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit]], [[United States Court of Federal Claims]], and [[United States Court of Customs and Patent Appeals]]. It also includes cases from [[United States district court|United States District Courts]], and certain decisions from administrative tribunals, such as the [[Trademark Trial and Appeal Board]], the [[Board of Patent Appeals and Interferences]], the [[United States International Trade Commission]] and the [[Commissioner of Patents and Trademarks]], and opinions from state courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants = |vol = 1 |reporter = USPQ2d |opinion = |pinpoint = i |court = |date = 1987 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reporter is published with a digest in cumulative and annual volumes. The digests have [[headnote]]s from the opinions and are organized according to a classification scheme. The digests are published with cases of tables organized alphabetically and by tribunal, and with a topical index.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants = |vol = 1-20|reporter = Cumulative Digest USPQ 2d |opinion = |pinpoint = 1 |court = |date = 1994 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cases reported in the U.S.P.Q. are available through many commercial services, including [[LexisNexis]] and [[Westlaw]].  However, the U.S.P.Q. editorial enhancements such as the headnotes and classification system are proprietary to and available only through Bloomberg Law and Bloomberg BNA (Bureau of National Affairs).{{cn|date=November 2016}}

'''Western Region Megapolis''' also called '''Western Region Megapolis Planning Project (WRMPP)''' is an [[urban planning]], [[zoning]], and development project aimed at creating a planned [[Megalopolis (city type)|Megapolis]] in [[Sri Lanka]]'s [[Western Province, Sri Lanka|Western Province]] by 2030.  The master plan was created by [[Surbana International Consultants Pte Ltd|Surbana]] in cooperation with local experts. The plan hopes to create a Megacity that can match other economic hubs such as [[Dubai]], [[Singapore]], [[Seoul]] and [[Tokyo]] and solve the issues of [[traffic congestion]], garbage, [[slum]]s, and [[Pollution|environmental pollution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://bizenglish.adaderana.lk/what-is-the-western-region-megapolis-plan-to-make-colombo-a-singapore/|title=What is the Singapore-styled Western Region Megapolis plan for Colombo? {{!}} Adaderana Biz English {{!}} Sri Lanka Business News|website=bizenglish.adaderana.lk|access-date=2016-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sundaytimes.lk/151108/business-times/western-region-megapolis-plan-to-be-unveiled-in-jan-2016-170725.html|title=Western Region Megapolis Plan to be unveiled in Jan 2016  {{!}} The Sunday Times Sri Lanka|website=www.sundaytimes.lk|access-date=2016-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/asia/south-asia/singapore-to-revise-master-plan-for-sri-lankas-megapolis|title=Singapore to revise master plan for Sri Lanka's Megapolis|last=hermes|website=The Straits Times|access-date=2016-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.presidentsoffice.gov.lk/news/megapolis-development-plan-presented-to-president/|title=Megapolis Development Plan presented to President - Presidential Secretariat of Sri Lanka|website=www.presidentsoffice.gov.lk|access-date=2016-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main goals of the project are for economic growth and prosperity, good governance, creation of an efficient and well-planned region, social equity and harmony as well as environmental sustainability.&lt;ref name="masterplan" /&gt; The project includes Social Infrastructure development such as housing, [[Health care|healthcare]], [[education]] ,spiritual development, Safety and security, [[Transport]]ation and traffic Management, [[Airport]]s and [[port]] development, [[Water supply|Water]] and Energy related infrastructure development as well as the development of [[Small and medium-sized enterprises|SMEs]], [[Industry|Industries]] and [[tourism]].&lt;ref name="Summary plan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Detailed Plan"&gt;{{cite web|title=Detailed Master Plan|url=http://megapolis.gov.lk/pdf/Megapolis%20Master%20Plan_April2016/WRMPP_MasterPlan_Eng_Apr16.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The conceptual plan was initially mooted in 1991 by the then young Sri Lankan Industries, Science and Technology Minister [[Ranil Wickremesinghe]], when he made a presentation in the presence of the visiting Japanese Prime Minister Toshiki Kaifu, with the objective of getting Japanese assistance to implement the Megaproject.  However development of the concept came to a halt with the change of the government in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dailymirror.lk/89227/the-flagship-project-megapolis-concept-and-scope-in-sri-lankan-context|title=The flagship project Megapolis: Concept and scope in Sri Lankan context|website=www.dailymirror.lk|access-date=2016-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004 Singaporean [[Housing and Development Board|HDB]]'s design subsidiary CESMA created the Western Region Megapolis plan when Wickremasinghe returned to power and the proposal was submitted to the Board of Investment(BOI) however the fall of the government again stopped the project. His successor [[Mahinda Rajapaksa]] abandoned the plan but implemented piecemeal recommendations of the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.colombopage.com/archive_15B/Oct18_1445192321CH.php|title=Sri Lanka : Sri Lanka seeks Singapore\'s assistance to plan developing Western Province megapolis|last=Lanka|first=Gamini Gunaratna, Sri Lanka News Paper by LankaPage.com (LLC)- Latest Hot News from Sri|website=www.colombopage.com|access-date=2016-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After returning to power in 2015, Wickremasinghe requested Surbana Jurong, the successor of CESMA to revise the plan to suit the newer needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dailynation.lk/singapore-sri-lanka-revive-western-region-megapolis-plan/|title=Singapore to help Sri Lanka revive Western Region Megapolis plan|date=2015-02-25|website=Daily Nation|access-date=2016-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.straitstimes.com/asia/south-asia/singapore-to-revise-master-plan-for-sri-lankas-megapolis|title=Singapore to revise master plan for Sri Lanka's Megapolis|last=hermes|website=The Straits Times|access-date=2016-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Megapolis plan was unveiled in a ceremony with Prime Minister Wickremesighe, President [[Maithripala Sirisena]] and Megapolis and Western province development minister [[Champika Ranawaka]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lankabusinessonline.com/sri-lanka-unveils-megapolis-plan/|title=Sri Lanka unveils Megapolis plan|website=Lanka Business Online|language=en-US|access-date=2016-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 2016 [[Siemens]] signed an MoU with the [[Ministry of Megapolis and Western Development|Ministry of Megapolis]] to provide solutions for smart cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lankabusinessonline.com/sri-lanka-signs-mou-with-siemens-to-develop-megapolis-smart-cities/|title=Sri Lanka signs MOU with Siemens to develop Megapolis smart cities – Lanka Business Online|website=www.lankabusinessonline.com|access-date=2016-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;
