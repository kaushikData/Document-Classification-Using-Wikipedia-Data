{{Other uses|Akashic records (disambiguation)}}
{{ref-improve|date=April 2018}}
In [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophy]] and [[anthroposophy]], the '''Akashic records''' are a [[compendium]] of all human events, thoughts, words, emotions, and intent ever to have occurred in the past, present, or future. They are believed by [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophists]] to be encoded in a non-physical [[Plane (esotericism)|plane of existence]] known as the [[etheric plane]]. There are [[Anecdotal evidence|anecdotal]] accounts but there is no scientific evidence for the existence of the Akashic records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Ellwood |first= Robert S. |year=1996 |chapter= Theosophy |title= The Encyclopedia of the Paranormal |editor-last= Stein |editor-first= Gordon |editor-link= Gordon Stein |publisher= Prometheus Books |pages= 759–66 |isbn= 978-1-57392-021-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Regal |first= Brian |author-link= Brian Regal |year= 2009 |title= Pseudoscience: A Critical Encyclopedia |publisher= Greenwood |page= 29 |isbn= 978-0-313-35507-3 |quote= Other than anecdotal eyewitness accounts, there is no evidence of the ability to astral project, the existence of other planes, or of the Akashic Record.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Drury&gt;{{cite book | url=https://www.questia.com/read/121381643 | title=Heaven: The Rise of Modern Western Magic | publisher=Oxford University Press |last= Drury |first= Nevill | year=2011 | location=New York | pages=308 | isbn=978-0-19-975100-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Akasha]]'' (''{{IAST|ākāśa}}'' {{lang|sa|आकाश}}) is the [[Sanskrit]] word for '[[Aether (classical element)|aether]]' or 'atmosphere'.

==Theosophical Society==
The Sanskrit term ''akasha'' was introduced to the language of theosophy through [[H. P. Blavatsky]] (1831–1891), who characterized it as a sort of life force; she also referred to "indestructible tablets of the astral light" recording both the past and future of human thought and action, but she did not use the term "akashic".&lt;ref name="brandt_hammer"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Katharina|last1=Brandt|first2=Olav|last2=Hammer|chapter=Rudolf Steiner and Theosophy|title=Handbook of the Theosophical Current|editor1-first=Olav|editor1-last=Hammer|editor2-first=Mikael|editor2-last=Rothstein|location= Leiden, NL; Boston|publisher=Brill|year= 2013|pages= [https://books.google.com/books?id=snZRetoB9yIC&amp;pg=PA122 122–3] |isbn= 9789004235960 |ref={{Harvid|Hammer &amp; Rothstein|2013}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The notion of an akashic ''record'' was further disseminated by [[Alfred Percy Sinnett]] in his book [[Esoteric Buddhism (book)|''Esoteric Buddhism'']] (1883) when he cites [[Henry Steel Olcott]]'s ''A Buddhist Catechism'' (1881).&lt;ref name="esoteric.buddhism"&gt;{{cite book|first=Alfred Percy|last=Sinnett|title=Esoteric Buddhism|page=127|url=https://books.google.com/?id=A_4LAAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;pg=PA127&amp;dq=akasa|year=1884|edition=5th|publisher=Houghton Mifflin}}&lt;/ref&gt; Olcott  wrote that "Buddha taught two things are eternal, viz, 'Akasa' and 'Nirvana': everything has come out of Akasa in obedience to a law of motion inherent in it, and, passes away. No thing ever comes out of nothing." Olcott further explains that "Early Buddhism, then, clearly held to a permanency of records in the Akasa and the potential capacity of man to read the same, when he was evoluted to the stage of true individual enlightenment."&lt;ref&gt;Olcott, Henry Steel. ''A Buddhist Catechism''. London: Allen Scott and Company, 1881. [https://books.google.com/books?id=pgBOAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=A%20Buddhist%20catechism%20olcott&amp;pg=PA51#v=onepage&amp;q=akasa&amp;f=false 51–2], [https://books.google.com/books?id=pgBOAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=A%20Buddhist%20catechism%20olcott&amp;pg=PA79#v=onepage&amp;q=akasa&amp;f=false 79].&lt;/ref&gt;

By [[C. W. Leadbeater]]'s [[C. W. Leadbeater#Clairvoyance|''Clairvoyance'']] (1899) the association of the term with the idea was complete, and he identified the akashic records by name as something a [[clairvoyant]] could read.&lt;ref name="brandt_hammer" /&gt; 
In his 1913 ''[[Man: whence, how and whither, a record of clairvoyant investigation|''Man: How, Whence, and Whither?'']]'',  Leadbeater claims to record the history of [[Atlantis]] and other civilizations as well as the future society of [[Earth]] in the 28th century.&lt;ref name="brandt_hammer" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= Besant |first1= Annie |last2= Leadbeater |first2= C.W. |title= Man: How, Whence, and Whither? |location= Adyar, India |year= 1913 |publisher= Theosophical Publishing House}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alice A. Bailey]] wrote in her book ''Light of the Soul'' on ''The Yoga Sutras of Patanjali – Book 3 – Union achieved and its Results'' (1927): {{quote|The akashic record is like an immense photographic film, registering all the desires and earth experiences of our planet. Those who perceive it will see pictured thereon: The life experiences of every human being since time began, the reactions to experience of the entire animal kingdom, the aggregation of the thought-forms of a [[karma|karmic nature]] (based on desire) of every human unit throughout time. Herein lies the great deception of the records. Only a trained occultist can distinguish between actual experience and those astral pictures created by imagination and keen desire.}}

==Rudolf Steiner==
The [[Austrian people|Austrian]] theosophist and later founder of [[Anthroposophy]], [[Rudolf Steiner]], used the Akashic records concept mainly in a series of articles in his journal ''[[Lucifer-Gnosis]]'' from 1904 to 1908, where he wrote about [[Atlantis]] and [[Lemuria (continent)|Lemuria]], topics related to their purported history and civilisation, etc.&lt;ref&gt;''Aus der Akasha-Chronik''. Partial edition of the work in English:
{{cite book |first= Rudolf |last= Steiner |title= The Submerged Continents of Atlantis and Lemuria, Their History and Civilization. Being Chapters From The Âkâshic Records |location= [[London]] |publisher= Theosophical Publishing Society |year= 1911}} First complete English edition: {{cite book |first= Rudolf |last= Steiner |title= Cosmic Memory |location= [[Englewood, New Jersey]] |publisher= Rudolf Steiner Publications |year= 1959}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides this, he used the term in the title of lectures on a ''Fifth [[Gospel]]'' held in 1913 and 1914, shortly after the foundation of the [[Anthroposophical Society]] and Steiner's exclusion from the [[Theosophical Society Adyar]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book |first= Rudolf |last= Steiner |title= The Fifth Gospel. Investigation of the Akasha Chronicle. Five lectures given in Christiania, 1913 |location= London |publisher= Rudolf Steiner Publishing |year= 1950}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aquarian Gospel==
[[Levi H. Dowling]]'s ''[[The Aquarian Gospel of Jesus the Christ|Aquarian Gospel of Jesus the Christ]]'' (1908) offers a version of the youth of [[Jesus Christ]] ostensibly based upon "akashic record" material.

== Popular culture ==
References to the ''Akashic Records'' can be found in few fantasy fictions like "[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/32953267-evolv EvOLv]" by Ryan Sequeira and "[https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/36982571-keepers-of-the-kalachakra Keepers of the Kalachakra]" by [[Ashwin Sanghi]].

'''Antonio Caso Andrade''' (December 19, 1883&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; March 6, 1946) was a [[Mexican people|Mexican]] [[philosopher]] and rector of the former ''Universidad Nacional de México'', nowadays known as the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]] from December 1921 to August 1923. Along with [[José Vasconcelos]], he founded the [[Ateneo de la Juventud]], a [[humanism|humanist]] group against philosophical positivism. The Athenian generation opposed [[Auguste Comte]] and [[Herbert Spencer]]’s philosophical views, giving credence to and expanding on the ideas of  Henri Bergson, Schopenhauer, Nietzsche, and [[José Enrique Rodó]]. Caso opposed [[rationalism]]. His group the ''ateneistas'' believed in a moral, willing, and spiritual individual being.&lt;ref&gt;[http://info4.juridicas.unam.mx/unijus/cmp/leguniv/rectores/r9. Biography on Caso from UNAM]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical Work==
In the summer of 1909, Caso presented his critiques of [[positivism]] in a series of conferences later expanded in the third edition by the Athenians of Youth. He was inspired by the [[Christian]] philosophical tradition, in particular by [[Blaise Pascal]] and Tolstoy. Caso distinguishes three aspects of human existence: economic, aesthetic, and moral.  Caso refuted [[Gabino Barreda]]’s thesis and the first [[Justo Sierra]] that the future of Mexico was built primarily on basis of a scientific doctrine. In the work "[[Catholicism]], [[Jacobinism]] and Positivism" included in the book Discursos a la nacion mexicana (Discourses to the Mexican nation) Caso deepens his criticism of two of the hegemonic ideologies in the late nineteenth century: [[Jacobin (politics)|Jacobinism]] (or extreme liberalism) and positivism. The supporters of the first accuse them of ignoring reality, while those in the second get the blame for the alleged inevitability of reality. Antonio Caso is a pioneer in the Mexican philosophy that was developed later by [[Samuel Ramos]], [[Leopoldo Zea Aguilar]], and [[Octavio Paz]] among others. In his book ''El problema de México y la ideología nacional'', (The problem of Mexico and the nation ideology) published in 1924, Caso argues Mexico’s biggest problem is the lack of unity (racial, cultural and social). Towards the end of his life, Caso was influenced by the philosophies of Husserl, Scheler, and Heidegger, especially Husserl, whose ideas were reflected in the book ''La filosofía de Husserl, El acto ideatorio, La persona humana y el estado totalitario y El peligro del hombre.'' (Husserl's philosophy, ideatory The act, The human person and the totalitarian state, and the danger of man).

[[File:Mujaku Asanga Kofukuji.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Japanese art|Japanese]] wood statue of Asaṅga from 1208 CE]]
[[File:Asanga.JPG|thumb|upright|[[Tibetan Buddhism|Tibetan]] depiction of Asaṅga and [[Maitreya]]]]

'''Asaṅga''' ({{bo|t=ཐོགས་མེད།|w=thogs med}}, {{CJKV|t=無著|p=Wúzhuó}}; [[Romaji]]: ''Mujaku'') ([[Floruit|fl.]] 4th century C.E.) was a major exponent of the [[Yogacara]] tradition in [[India]], also called ''Vijñānavāda''. Traditionally, he and his half-brother [[Vasubandhu]] are regarded as the founders of this school. The two half-brothers were also major exponents of [[Abhidharma]] teachings.

==Early life==
Asaṅga was born as the son of a [[Kṣatriya]] father in [[Purushapura|Puruṣapura]] (present day [[Peshawar]] in [[Pakistan]]), which at that time was part of the ancient kingdom of [[Gandhara|Gandhāra]]. Current scholarship places him in the fourth century CE. He was perhaps originally a member of the [[Mahīśāsaka]] school or the [[Mūlasarvāstivāda]] school but later converted to [[Mahāyāna]].&lt;ref&gt;'Doctrinal Affiliation of the Buddhist Master Asanga' - [[Alex Wayman]] in ''Untying the Knots in Buddhism'', {{ISBN|81-208-1321-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to some scholars, Asaṅga's frameworks for abhidharma writings retained many underlying Mahīśāsaka traits.&lt;ref&gt;Anacker, Stefan (1984). ''Seven Works Of Vasubandhu: The Buddhist Psychological Doctor.'' p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; [[André Bareau]] writes:&lt;ref&gt;Rama Karana Sarma (1993). ''Researches in Indian and Buddhist Philosophy: Essays in Honour of Alex Wayman.'' p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|[It is] sufficiently obvious that Asaṅga had been a Mahīśāsaka when he was a young monk, and that he incorporated a large part of the doctrinal opinions proper to this school within his own work after he became a great master of the Mahāyāna, when he made up what can be considered as a new and Mahāyānist ''Abhidharma-piṭaka''.}}

In the record of his journeys through the kingdoms of [[India]], [[Xuanzang]] wrote that Asaṅga was initially a Mahīśāsaka monk, but soon turned toward the Mahāyāna teachings.&lt;ref name="Rongxi 1996, p. 153"&gt;Rongxi, Li (1996). ''The Great Tang Dynasty Record of the Western Regions.'', Numata Center, Berkeley, p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt; Asaṅga had a half-brother, Vasubandhu, who was a monk from the [[Sarvastivada|Sarvāstivāda]] school. Vasubandhu is said to have taken up Mahāyāna Buddhism after meeting with Asaṅga and one of Asaṅga's disciples.&lt;ref&gt;Rongxi, Li (1996). ''The Great Tang Dynasty Record of the Western Regions.'', Numata Center, Berkeley, pp. 154-155.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meditation and teachings==
{{MahayanaBuddhism}}

Asaṅga spent many years in serious meditation, during which time tradition says that he often visited [[Tushita|Tuṣita]] Heaven to receive teachings from [[Maitreya]] [[Bodhisattva]]. Heavens such as Tuṣita Heaven is said to be accessible through [[meditation]], and accounts of this are given in the writings of the Indian Buddhist monk [[Paramartha|Paramārtha]], who lived during the 6th century CE.&lt;ref&gt;Wayman, Alex (1997). ''Untying the Knots in Buddhism: Selected Essays.'' p. 213&lt;/ref&gt; Xuanzang tells a similar account of these events:&lt;ref name="Rongxi 1996, p. 153"/&gt;

{{quote|In the great mango grove five or six ''[[li (unit)|li]]'' to the southwest of the city ([[Ayodhya]]), there is an old monastery where Asaṅga Bodhisattva received instructions and guided the common people. At night he went up to the place of Maitreya Bodhisattva in Tuṣita Heaven to learn the ''{{IAST|[[Yogacarabhumi-sastra|Yogācārabhūmi-śāstra]]}}'', the ''{{IAST|[[Mahayana-sutra-alamkara-karika|Mahāyāna-sūtra-alaṃkāra-śāstra]]}}'', the ''{{IAST|[[Madhyanta-vibhaga-karika|Madhyānta-vibhāga-śāstra]]}}'', etc.; in the daytime, he lectured on the marvelous principles to a great audience.}}

Asaṅga went on to write many of the key [[Yogācāra]] treatises such as the ''[[Yogācārabhūmi-śāstra]]'', the ''[[Mahāyānasaṃgraha]]''&lt;ref&gt;Keenan, John P. (2003). [https://web.archive.org/web/20140821120318/http://www.bdk.or.jp/pdf/bdk/digitaldl/dBET_T1593_GreatVehicleSummary_2003.pdf "The summary of the Great Vehicle by Bodhisattva Asaṅga"], transl. from the Chinese of Paramārtha (Taishō vol. 31, number 1593). Berkeley, Calif: Numata Center for Buddhist Translation and Research. {{ISBN|1-886439-21-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''Abhidharma-samuccaya'' as well as other works, although there are discrepancies between the Chinese and Tibetan traditions concerning which works are attributed to him and which to Maitreya.&lt;ref&gt;[[Giuseppe Tucci]] (1930). ''On Some Aspects of the Doctrines of Maitreya (natha) and the Asanga'', Calcutta.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Walpola Rahula]], the thought of the ''[[Abhidharma-samuccaya]]'' is invariably closer to that of the Pali ''{{IAST|[[Nikayas|Nikāyas]]}}'' than is that of the Theravadin [[Abhidhamma]].&lt;ref&gt;Dan Lusthaus (2002). ''Buddhist Phenomenology.'' Routledge, p. 44, note 5. Lusthaus draws attention to Rahula's ''Zen and the Taming of the Bull.''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Questions of authorship==
The Tibetan tradition attributes authorship of the ''[[Ratnagotravibhaga]]'' to him, while the Chinese traditions attributes it to a certain [[Sthiramati]] or Sāramati. Peter Harvey finds the Tibetan attribution less plausible.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Harvey (1993). "An Introduction to Buddhism." Cambridge University Press, page 114.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Title ==
''Ayn-al-Qużat'' in [[Arabic Language|Arabic]] means "the pearl of the judges": ''Ayn'' means the eye, implying something very valuable, and ''Qozat'' is the plural of ''[[Qadi]]'', which means judge.

==Life==
He was born in [[Meyaneh]] and his ancestors were of Hamedan [[judge]]s. He was a disciple of [[Ahmad Ghazali]] and devoted of [[Hallaj]]. He became a famous scholar at early ages, and by the time he was thirty he was chosen judge. Along with Abu Hamed [[Al-Ghazali]], he is one of the founders of doctrinal [[Sufism]]. According to some accounts, he was briefly a pupil of [[Omar Khayyam]]. Upon his return from pilgrimage, Khayyam likely stayed in Hamadan for some time. It is possible that during his stay he became tutor to the young Ain al-Quzat.&lt;ref name="The Wine of Wisdom"&gt;Mehdi Aminrazavi, ''The Wine of Wisdom: The Life, Poetry and Philosophy of Omar Khayyam'', [[Oneworld Publications]] (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|351}} However, Aminrazavi (2007) believes that from the figures who may have studied with Khayyam Ain al-Quzat is the least likely and that arguing their association is wishful thinking by those who like to view Khayyam as a Sufi.&lt;ref name="The Wine of Wisdom"/&gt;{{rp|23}} Unlike most of the Sufis who have lived as respected and revered members of their communities, he fell afoul of the [[Seljuq Empire|Seljuk]] rulers and was accused of heresy and executed, either by crucifixion or burning.&lt;ref&gt;J. C. E. Bowen. (1973). The Rubāՙiyyāt of Omar Khayyam: A Critical Assessment of Robert Graves' and Omar Ali Shah's Translation. Iran, 11, 63-73.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|70}}

Ayn al-Quzat along with [[Mansur al-Hallaj]] and [[Shahab al-Din Suhrawardi]] are known as the three martyrs of Sufism.

==Work==
The most significant works of Ayn al-Qożāt are ''Tamhīdāt (Preludes)'' and ''Zubdat al-ḥaqāʾiq fī kašf al-ḵalāʾeq (The Essence of Truth)''. Both books are masterpieces of [[Sufi]] literature and have mystical and philosophical significance.&lt;ref&gt;Hossein Nasr (2008), The Garden of Truth, New York, HarperOne&lt;/ref&gt;
Ayn al-Qożāt Hamadānī quoted a few verses apparently in his own [[Iranian languages|Iranian]] dialect (where it is called fahlavī; bayt-e pahlavī in a manuscript variant).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/v9f2/v9f232.html Fahlaviyat in Encyclopedia Iranica by Dr. Ahmad Taffazoli] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080317015531/http://www.iranica.com/newsite/articles/v9f2/v9f232.html |date=March 17, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Poetry==
A famous quatrain is said to be his:
{{Verse translation|italicsoff=y|rtl1=y|
{{lang|fa|rtl=yes|ما مرگ وشهادت از خدا خواسته ايم
وآن هم به سه چيزکم بهاخواسته ايم
گردوست چنين کندکه ماخواسته ايم
مـا آتـش و نفـت و بـوريا خــواسـته ايم}}
|
I want death and martyrdom from God
I want it in three low-priced things
If the friend (i.e. God) grant my wishes
I want fire and oil and straw}}

This quatrain refers to his execution by Caliph's order.

'''Biblical criticism''' is an umbrella term for those methods of studying the Bible that embrace two distinctive perspectives: the concern to avoid [[dogma]] and [[bias]] by applying a [[non-sectarian]], reason-based judgment, and the reconstruction of history according to contemporary understanding. Biblical criticism uses the grammar, structure, development, and relationship of language to identify such characteristics as the Bible's literary structure, its [[genre]], its context, meaning, authorship, and origins.

Biblical criticism includes a wide range of approaches and questions within four major contemporary methodologies: [[textual criticism|textual]], [[source criticism|source]], [[form criticism|form]], and [[literary criticism|literary]] criticism. Textual criticism examines the text and its manuscripts to identify what the original text would have said. Source criticism searches the texts for evidence of original sources. Form criticism identifies short units of text and seeks to identify their original setting. Each of these is primarily historical and pre-compositional in its concerns. Literary criticism, on the other hand, focuses on the literary structure, authorial purpose, and reader's response to the text through methods such as [[rhetorical criticism]], [[canonical criticism]], and [[narrative criticism]].

Biblical criticism began as an aspect of the rise of [[modernity|modern]] culture in the West. Some scholars claim that its roots reach back to the [[Reformation]], but most agree it grew out of the [[German Enlightenment]]. German [[pietism]] played a role in its development, as did British [[deism]], with its greatest influences being [[rationalism]] and [[Protestant]] scholarship. The Enlightenment age and its skepticism of biblical and ecclesiastical authority ignited questions concerning the historical basis for the man [[Jesus]] separately from traditional theological views concerning him.  This "[[quest for the historical Jesus|quest]]" for the [[historical Jesus|Jesus of history]] began in biblical criticism's earliest stages, reappeared in the nineteenth century, and again in the twentieth, remaining a major occupation of biblical criticism, on and off, for over 200 years. 
 
In the late twentieth and early twenty-first century, biblical criticism was influenced by a wide range of additional [[academic disciplines]] and [[theory|theoretical perspectives]], changing it from a primarily historical approach to a [[multidisciplinary]] field. In a field long dominated by white male [[Protestants]], non-white scholars, women, and those from the Jewish and Catholic traditions became prominent voices. [[Globalization]] brought a broader spectrum of worldviews into the field, and other academic disciplines as diverse as [[Near Eastern studies]], [[psychology]], [[anthropology]] and [[sociology]] formed new methods of biblical criticism such as socio-scientific criticism and psychological biblical criticism. Meanwhile, [[post-modernism]] and post-critical interpretation began questioning biblical criticism's role and function.

Richard Simon"|Title page of [[Richard Simon (priest)|Richard Simon]]'s ''Critical History'' (1685), an early work of biblical criticism]]
[[Mosaic authorship|According to tradition]], [[Moses]] was the author of the first five books of the Bible, including the [[book of Genesis]]. Philosophers and theologians such as [[Thomas Hobbes]] (1588–1679), [[Benedict Spinoza]] (1632–1677), and [[Richard Simon (priest)|Richard Simon]] (1638–1712) questioned Mosaic authorship. Spinoza said  Moses could not have written the preface to Deuteronomy, since he never crossed the Jordan; he points out that Deuteronomy 31:9 references Moses in the third person; and he lists multiple other inconsistencies and anomalies that led him to conclude "it was plain" these Pentateuchal books were not written by Moses himself.&lt;ref name="Benedictus de Spinoza"&gt;{{cite book |last1=de Spinoza |first1=Benedictus|translator=R.

According to Old Testament scholar [[Edward Joseph Young|Edward Young]], Astruc believed Moses used hereditary accounts of the Hebrew people to assemble the book of Genesis.&lt;ref name="Edward Joseph Young"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Young |first1=Edward Joseph |title=An Introduction to the Old Testament |date=1989|orig-year=1964 |publisher=Eerdmans Pub. Co. |location=Grand Rapids, Michigan |isbn=978-0-8028-0339-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|119,122}}&lt;ref name="Jean Astruc" /&gt;{{rp|212–214}} So, Astruc borrowed methods of [[textual criticism]], used to investigate Greek and Roman texts, and applied them to the Bible in search of those original accounts. Astruc believed he identified them as separate sources that were edited together into the book of Genesis, thus explaining Genesis' problems while still allowing for Mosaic authorship.&lt;ref name="Jean Astruc"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nahkola|first=Aulikki|editor1-last=Jarick |editor1-first=John|chapter=The ''Memoires'' of Moses and the Genesis of Method in Biblical Criticism: Astruc's Contribution|title=Sacred Conjectures: The Context and Legacy of Robert Lowth and Jean Astruc |date=2007 |publisher=T&amp;T Clark |location=New York |isbn=978-0-567-02932-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|213}}  Astruc's method was adopted and developed at the twenty or so Protestant universities in Germany. There was a willingness among the doctoral candidates to re-express Christian doctrine in terms of the [[scientific method]] and the historical understanding common during the [[Age of Enlightenment#German states|German Enlightenment]] (circa 1750–1850).&lt;ref name="Peter Hans Reill"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Reill |first1=Peter Hanns |title=The German Enlightenment and the Rise of Historicism |date=1975 |publisher=University of California Press |location=Berkeley |isbn=978-0-520-02594-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2,3,5}}&lt;ref name="David R.

German [[pietism]] played a role in the rise of biblical criticism by supporting the desire to break the hold of religious authority.&lt;ref name="Peter Hans Reill"/&gt;{{rp|6}}&lt;ref name="SoulenGEL"&gt;{{cite book|last1= Soulen |first1= Richard N.|last2= Soulen |first2= R.

Law1"/&gt;{{rp|42,252}}  For example, the Swiss theologian [[Jean Alphonse Turretin]] (1671–1737) attacked conventional [[exegesis]] (interpretation) and argued for critical analysis led solely by reason. Turretin believed the Bible could be considered authoritative even if it was not considered [[Biblical inerrancy|inerrant]]. This has become a common modern Judeo-Christian view.&lt;ref name="David R. Law1"/&gt;{{rp|39–42}} [[Johann Salomo Semler]] (1725–1791) argued for an end to all doctrinal assumptions, giving historical criticism its non-sectarian nature. As a result, Semler is often called the father of [[Historical criticism|historical-critical]] research.&lt;ref name="David R. Law1" /&gt;{{rp|43}}  Semler distinguished between "inward" and "outward" religion, the idea that, for some people, their religion is their highest inner purpose, while for others, religion is a more exterior practice: a tool to accomplish other purposes more important to the individual such as political or economic goals. This is a [[Cognitive science of religion|concept recognized by modern psychology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Behere |first1=Prakash B. |last2=Das |first2=Anweshak |last3=Yadav |first3=Richa |last4=Behere |first4=Aniruddh P. |title=Religion and mental health |pmc=3705681  |publisher=US National Library of Medicine, National Institutes of Health }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Communications scholar [[James A. Herrick]] says even though most scholars agree that biblical criticism evolved out of the German Enlightenment, there are also histories of biblical scholarship that have found "strong direct links" with British [[deism]]. Herrick references the theologian [[Henning Graf Reventlow]] as saying deism included the [[humanism|humanist world view]], which has also been significant in biblical criticism.&lt;ref name="James A. Herrick"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Herrick |first1=James A. |title=The Radical Rhetoric of the English Deists: The Discourse of Skepticism, 1680–1750 |date=1997 |publisher=University of South Carolina Press |location=Columbia, South Carolina |isbn=978-1-57003-166-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|39–40}}  Some scholars, such as [[Gerhard Ebeling]] (1912–2001), [[Rudolf Bultmann]] (1884–1976), and [[Ernst Käsemann]] (1906–1998) trace biblical criticism's origins to the [[Reformation]].&lt;ref name="Rogerson"/&gt;{{rp|298}} &lt;ref name="David Law2"&gt;{{cite book |last=Law|first=David |chapter=German Christian Thought |editor1-last=Hastings |editor1-first=Adrian |editor2-last=Mason |editor2-first=Alistair |editor3-last=Pyper |editor3-first=Hugh |title=The Oxford Companion to Christian Thought |date=2000 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-19-860024-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|261}} Three early scholars of the Reformation era who helped lay the foundations of modern biblical criticism were [[Joachim Camerarius]] (1500–1574), [[Hugo Grotius]] (1583–1645), and [[Matthew Tindal]] (1653–1733). Camerarius advocated for using context to interpret Bible texts. Grotius paved the way for comparative religion studies by analyzing New Testament texts in light of Classical, Jewish and early Christian writings. Tindal, as part of English deism, asserted that Jesus taught [[natural religion]], an undogmatic faith that was later changed by the Church. This view drove a wedge between scripture and the Church's claims of religious truth.&lt;ref name="David R. Law1"/&gt;{{rp|41}}&lt;ref name="John Barton"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Barton |first1=John |title=The Nature of Biblical Criticism |date=2007 |publisher=Westminster John Knox Press |location=Louisville, Kentucky |isbn=978-0-664-22587-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|117–136,138}}

[[File:Hermann Samuel Reimarus.jpg|thumb|right|upright=0.8 |alt=Oil painting of Reimarus |[[Hermann Samuel Reimarus]] (1694–1768) studied the [[historical Jesus]].]]
The first scholar to separate the [[historical Jesus]] from the theological Jesus was philosopher, writer, classicist, Hebraist and Enlightenment free thinker [[Hermann Samuel Reimarus]] (1694–1768).&lt;ref name="Ulrich Groetsch"/&gt; Copies of Reimarus' writings were discovered by [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing|G. E. Lessing]] (1729–1781) in the library at Wolfenbüttel where he was librarian. Reimarus had left permission for his work to be published after his death, and Lessing did so between 1774 and 1778, publishing them as ''Die Fragmente eines unbekannten Autors'' (''The Fragments of an Unknown Author''). Over time, they came to be known as the ''[[Wolfenbüttel Fragments]]'' after the library where Lessing worked. Reimarus distinguished between what Jesus taught and how he is portrayed in the New Testament. According to Reimarus, Jesus was a political [[Messiah]] who failed at creating political change and was executed. His disciples then stole the body and invented the story of the resurrection for personal gain.&lt;ref name="Ulrich Groetsch"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Groetsch |first1=Ulrich |title=Hermann Samuel Reimarus (1694–1768): Classicist, Hebraist, Enlightenment Radical in Disguise |date=2015 |publisher=Brill |location=Leiden |isbn=978-90-04-27299-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="David R. Law1"/&gt;{{rp|45–48}} Reimarus' controversial work prompted a response from Semler in 1779, ''[[Beantwortung der Fragmente eines Ungenannten]]'' (''Answering the Fragments of an Unknown'').&lt;ref name="H. Rollman"&gt;{{cite book |last=Rollman|first=H.|chapter=Johann Salomo Semler|editor1-last=McKim (ed.) |editor1-first=Donald K. |title=Historical Handbook of Major Biblical Interpreters |date=1998 |publisher=InterVarsity Press |location=Downers Grove |isbn=978-0-83081-452-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|358–359, 266}}  Semler refuted Reimarus' arguments, but it was of little consequence. Reimarus' writings had already made a lasting change in the practice of biblical criticism by making it clear such criticism could exist independently of theology and faith. Reimarus had shown biblical criticism could serve its own ends, be governed solely by rational criteria, and reject deference to religious tradition.&lt;ref name="David R. Law1"/&gt;{{rp|48}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Brown |first=Colin |chapter=Reimarus, Hermann Samuel |editor1-last=McKim |editor1-first=Donald K. |title=Historical Handbook of Major Biblical Interpreters |date=1998 |publisher=InterVarsity Press |location=Downer's Grove, Illinois|isbn=978-0-8308-1452-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|356}}

Lessing contributed to the field of biblical criticism by seeing Reimarus' writings published, but he also made contributions of his own work, arguing that the proper study of biblical texts requires knowing the context in which they were written. This has since become an accepted concept.&lt;ref name="SoulenGEL"/&gt;{{rp|102}} During this period, the biblical scholar [[Johann David Michaelis]] (1717–1791) wrote the first historical-critical introduction to the New Testament, in which the historical study of each book of the Bible is discussed.&lt;ref name="David R. Law1"/&gt;{{rp|45}}&lt;ref name="Gerald Shephard"&gt;{{cite book |last=Sheppard |first=Gerald |chapter=Johann David Michaelis|editor1-last=McKim |editor1-first=Donald K. |title=Historical Handbook of Major Biblical Interpreters |date=1998 |publisher=InterVarsity Press |location=Downer's Grove, Illinois |isbn=978-0-8308-1452-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|343–348,390}} Instead of interpreting the Bible historically, [[Johann Gottfried Eichhorn]] (1752–1827), [[Johann Philipp Gabler]] (1753–1826), and [[Georg Lorenz Bauer]] (1755–1806) took a different approach. They used the concept of myth as a tool for interpreting the Bible. This concept was later picked up by [[Rudolf Bultmann]] and it became particularly influential in the early twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Baird |first1=William |title=History of New Testament Research: From Deism to Tübingen|volume=1|date=1992|publisher=Fortress Press |location=Minneapolis, Minnesota|isbn=978-0-8006-2626-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|117,149–150,188–191}}

===The nineteenth century===
Theologians Richard and Kendall Soulen say biblical criticism reached full flower in the nineteenth century, becoming the "major transforming fact of biblical studies in the modern period" and noted that the people working at that time "saw themselves as continuing the aims of the Protestant Reformation."&lt;ref name="SoulenHC"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Soulen |first1= Richard N. |last2= Soulen |first2= R. Kendall |title= Handbook of Biblical Criticism |date= 2001|publisher= Westminster John Knox Press |location= Lexington, Kentucky|isbn= 978-0-664-22314-4 |edition=  Third}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|79}} Landmarks in understanding the Bible and its background were achieved during this century, with many modern concepts having their roots here.  For example, in 1835 and again in 1845, theologian [[Ferdinand Christian Baur]] (1792–1860) postulated a sharp contrast between the [[apostles]] [[Saint Peter|Peter]] and [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]]. Since then, this concept has had widespread debate within topics such as Pauline and New Testament studies, early church studies, Jewish Law, the theology of grace, and the doctrine of justification.&lt;ref name="Martin Hengel"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hengel |first1=Martin|translator=Thomas Trapp|orig-year=2006|title=Saint Peter: The Underestimated Apostle |date=2010 |publisher=Eerdmans |location=Grand Rapids, Michigan |isbn=978-0-8028-2718-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|67–77, 79, 99}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hafemann |first=S. J. |chapter=Baur, F. C. |editor1-last=McKim |editor1-first=Donald K. |title=Historical Handbook of Major Biblical Interpreters |date=1998 |publisher=InterVarsity Press |location=Downer's Grove, Illinois|isbn=978-0-8308-1452-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|285–289 }}

Foundations of anti-Jewish bias were also established in the field at this time under the guise of scholarly objectivity.&lt;ref name=Sweeney1997/&gt; The first Enlightenment Protestant to call for the "de-Judaizing" of Christianity was Johann Semler. The "emancipation of reason" from the ''Word of God'' was a primary goal of Semler and the Enlightenment exegetes, yet the picture of the Jews and Judaism found in biblical criticism of this period is colored by classic anti-Jewish stereotypes "despite the tradition's lip-service to emancipation."&lt;ref name="Anders Gerdmar"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gerdmar |first1=Anders |title=Roots of Theological Anti-Semitism: German Biblical Interpretation and the Jews, from Herder and Semler to Kittel and Bultmann |date=2009 |publisher=Brill |location=Leiden, Netherlands |isbn=978-90-04-16851-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|25, 27}} He took a stand against discrimination in society while at the same time writing theology that was strongly negative toward the Jews and Judaism.

The late nineteenth century saw the second "[[quest for the historical Jesus]]" which primarily involved writing versions of the "life of Jesus."  Important scholars of this quest included [[David Strauss]] (1808–1874), whose cultural significance is in his contribution to weakening the established authorities, and whose theological significance is in his confrontation of the doctrine of Christ's divinity with the modern critical study of history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Morgan |first=R. |chapter=Strauss, David Friedrich |editor1-last=McKim |editor1-first=Donald K. |title=Historical Handbook of Major Biblical Interpreters |date=1998 |publisher=InterVarsity Press |location=Downer's Grove, Illinois|isbn=978-0-8308-1452-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|365}} [[Adolf Von Harnack]] (1851–1930) contributed to the quest for the historical Jesus, writing ''The Essence of Christianity'' in 1900, where he described Jesus as a reformer.&lt;ref name="Holmberg"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Holmberg |first1=Bengt |editor1-last=Holmén |editor1-first=Tom |editor2-last=Porter |editor2-first=Stanley |title=Handbook for the Study of the Historical Jesus (4 Vols) |date=2011 |publisher=Brill |location=Boston, Massachusettes |isbn=978-9-00416-372-0 |chapter=Futures for the Jesus Quest}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|888}}  [[William Wrede]] (1859–1906) was a forerunner of redaction criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rollmann |first=H. |chapter=Wrede, William |editor1-last=McKim |editor1-first=Donald K. |title=Dictionary of Major Biblical Interpreters |date=2007 |publisher=InterVarsity Press |location=Downer's Grove, Illinois|isbn=978-0-8308-2927-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1058}} [[Ernst Renan]] (1823–1892) promoted the critical method and was opposed to orthodoxy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Wardman |first=Harold W. |title=Ernest Renan|encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia Britannica |edition= Online|accessdate=11 July 2018|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Ernest-Renan}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Johannes Weiss]] (1863–1914), [[Wilhelm Bousset|W.

[[Redaction criticism]] was also a common form of biblical criticism used in the early to mid-twentieth century.

After 1970, biblical criticism began to change radically and pervasively.&lt;ref name="SoulenGEL"/&gt;{{rp|21}} [[New criticism]] (literary criticism) developed.

By 1990, biblical criticism was no longer primarily a historical discipline but was instead a group of disciplines with often conflicting interests.&lt;ref name="SoulenGEL"/&gt;{{rp|18–22}} New perspectives from different ethnicities, feminist theology, Catholicism and Judaism revealed an "untapped world" previously overlooked by the majority of white male Protestants who had dominated biblical criticism from its beginnings.&lt;ref name="John Barton" /&gt;{{rp|150}}&lt;ref name ="Elizabeth Schüssler Fiorenza"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fiorenza |first1=Elisabeth Schüssler. |editor1-last=Fiorenza |editor1-first=Elisabeth Schüssler. |title=Feminist Biblical Studies in the Twentieth Century: Scholarship and Movement |date=2014 |publisher=Society of Biblical Literature|location=Atlanta, Georgia |isbn=978-1-58983-583-2|chapter=Between Movement and Academy: Feminist Biblical Studies in the Twentieth Century}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1, 15}} Globalization brought different world views, while other academic fields such as Near Eastern studies, sociology, and anthropology became active in biblical criticism as well. These new points of view created awareness that the Bible can be rationally interpreted from many different perspectives.&lt;ref name="SoulenGEL"/&gt;{{rp|22,53}} In turn, this awareness changed biblical criticism's central concept from the criteria of neutral judgment to that of beginning from a recognition of the various biases the reader brings to the study of the texts.&lt;ref name="SoulenGEL"/&gt;{{rp|22}}&lt;ref name="Holmén and Porter"&gt;{{cite book|last=Allison Jr.|first=Dale C. |chapter=How to Marginalize the Traditional Criteria of Authenticity |editor1-last=Holmén |editor1-first=Tom |editor2-last=Porter |editor2-first=Stanley E. |title=Handbook for the Study of the Historical Jesus (4 Vols) |date=2011 |publisher=Brill |location=Boston |isbn=978-90-04-16372-0 |volume= 1|quote=confirmation biases}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|19–20}}

== Major methods of criticism ==
Theologian David R. Law writes that textual, source, form, and redaction criticism are employed together by biblical scholars. The Old Testament (the Hebrew Bible) and the New Testament are distinct bodies of literature that raise their own problems of interpretation. Therefore, separating these methods, and addressing the Bible as a whole, is an artificial approach that is necessary only for the purpose of description.&lt;ref name="David R. Law1"/&gt;{{rp|vii-ix}}

=== Textual criticism ===
{{Main|Textual criticism}}{{See also|Textual criticism of the New Testament}}
[[File:P52 verso.jpg|thumb|upright=.8|alt=photo of a fragment of papyrus with writing on it| [[Rylands Library Papyrus P52|The Rylands fragment: P52 verso]]. Oldest existing fragment of New Testament Papyrus; contains phrases from the [[Book of John]].]]
Textual criticism examines the text itself and all associated manuscripts to determine the original text.&lt;ref name="McKenzie &amp; Kaltner"&gt;{{cite book |last1=McKenzie |first1=Steven L. |last2=Kaltner |first2=John |title=The Old Testament: Its Background, Growth, &amp; Content |date=2007 |publisher=Wipf &amp; Stock Publishers |location=Eugene, Oregon |isbn=978-1-62564-264-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|47}} It is one of the largest areas of Biblical criticism in terms of the sheer amount of information it addresses. The roughly 900 manuscripts found at Qumran include the oldest extant manuscripts of the Hebrew Bible. They represent every book except Esther, though most are fragmentary. The [[New Testament]] has been preserved in more [[Biblical manuscripts|manuscripts]] than any other ancient work, having over 5,800 complete or fragmented [[Greek language|Greek]] manuscripts, 10,000 [[Latin]] manuscripts and 9,300 manuscripts in various other ancient languages including [[Syriac language|Syriac]], [[Slavic languages|Slavic]], [[Gothic language|Gothic]], [[Ge'ez language|Ethiopic]], [[Coptic language|Coptic]] and [[Armenian language|Armenian]]. The dates of these manuscripts range from c.110—125 (the {{Papyrus link|52}} papyrus) to the introduction of printing in Germany in the 15th century.  There are also a million New Testament quotations in the collected writings of the [[Church Fathers]] of the first four centuries. As a comparison, the next best-sourced ancient text is Homer's ''[[Iliad]]'', which is  found in more than 1,900 manuscripts, though many are of a fragmentary nature. The two chief works of the first-century Roman historian [[Tacitus]], ''[[Annals (Tacitus)|Annales]]'' and ''[[Histories (Tacitus)|Historiae]]'', each survive in only a single medieval manuscript.&lt;ref name="Graeme D. Bird"/&gt;  There are a total of 476 extant non-Christian manuscripts dated to the second century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.earlham.edu/~seidti/iam/codex.html|author=Timothy W. Seid| title=Codex|website=Interpreting Ancient Manuscripts Web|accessdate=18 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These texts were all written by hand, by copying from another handwritten text, so they are not alike in the manner of a printed work. The differences between them are called variants.&lt;ref name="McKenzie &amp; Kaltner"/&gt;{{rp|47}}

A variant is simply any variation between two texts, and while the exact number is somewhat disputed, scholars agree the more texts, the more variants. This means there are more variants concerning New Testament texts than Old Testament texts.&lt;ref name="Stewart"/&gt;{{rp|2}} Variants are not evenly distributed throughout the texts.  Textual scholar [[Kurt Aland]] explains that charting the variants shows the New Testament is 62.9% variant-free.&lt;ref name="Kurt Aland"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Aland |first1=Kurt|last2=Aland |first2=Barbara|title=The Text of the New Testament: An Introduction to the Critical Editions and to the Theory and Practice of Modern Textual Criticism |date=1987 |publisher=Eerdmans |location=Grand Rapids |isbn=978-0-8028-3620-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|29}}  Many variants originate in simple misspellings or mis-copying. For example, a scribe would drop one or more letters, skip a word or line, write one letter for another, transpose letters, and so on.  Some variants represent a scribal attempt to simplify or harmonize, by changing a word or a phrase.&lt;ref name="Graeme D. Bird" /&gt;  Ehrman explains: scribe ''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;A&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' will introduce mistakes which are not in the manuscript of scribe ''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;B&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''. Copies of text ''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;A&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' with the mistake will subsequently contain that same mistake. The multiple generations of texts that follow, containing the error, are referred to as a "family" of texts. Over time the texts descended from ''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;A&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' that share the error, and those from ''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;B&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' that do not share it, will diverge further, but later texts will still be  identifiable as descended from one or the other because of the presence or absence of that original mistake. Textual criticism studies the differences between these families to piece together what the original looked like.&lt;ref name="Graeme D. Bird"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Metzger and Ehrman" /&gt;{{rp|206–212}} Sorting out the wealth of source material is complex, so textual families were sorted into categories tied to geographical areas. The divisions of the New Testament textual families were ''[[Alexandrian text-type|Alexandrian]]'' (also called the "Neutral text"), ''[[Western text-type|Western]]'' (Latin translations), and ''[[Byzantine text-type|Eastern]]'' (used by [[Antioch]] and [[Constantinople]]).&lt;ref name="Paul D.

Thus, the geographical labels should be used with caution; some scholars prefer to refer to the text types as "textual clusters" instead.&lt;ref name="Tommy Wasserman"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wasserman |first1=Tommy|last2=Gurry |first2=Peter J.|title=A New Approach to Textual Criticism: An Introduction to the Coherence-Based Genealogical Method |date=2017 |publisher=SBL Press |location=Atlanta |isbn=978-3-438-05174-5 |chapter=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3–9}}}}

Forerunners of modern textual criticism can be found in both early [[Rabbinic Judaism]] and the early church.&lt;ref name="David R. Law1"/&gt;{{rp|82}} Rabbis addressed variants in the Hebrew texts as early as AD 100. Tradition played a central role in their task of producing a standard version of the Hebrew Bible. The Hebrew text they produced stabilized by the end of the second century, and has come to be known as the [[Masoretic text]], the source of the Christian Old Testament.&lt;ref name="David R. Law1"/&gt;{{rp|82–84}} However, the discovery of the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] in 1947 has created problems. While 60% of the Dead Sea manuscripts are closely related to Masoretic tradition, others bear a closer resemblance to the [[Septuagint]] (the ancient Greek version of the Hebrew texts) and the [[Samaritan Pentateuch]]. For textual criticism, this has raised the question of whether or not there is such a thing that can be considered "original text."&lt;ref name="David R. Law1"/&gt;{{rp|82}}

[[File:Johann Jakob Griesbach c1800.jpg|thumb|upright=.8|left|alt=Photo of painting of Griesbach|[[Johann Jakob Griesbach]] (1745–1812), an influential German textual critic]]
The two main processes of textual criticism are [[recension]] and emendation. Recension is the selection of the most trustworthy evidence on which to base a text. Emendation is the attempt to eliminate the errors which are found even in the best manuscripts.&lt;ref name="Metzger and Ehrman"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Metzger |first1=B. M.|last2=Ehrman |first2=Bart|title=The Text of the New Testament |date=2005 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-19-516667-5 |edition= Fourth}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|205,209}}  Despite its use of objective rules, there is a subjective element involved in textual criticism.  The textual critic chooses a reading based on personal judgment, experience and common-sense. Biblical scholar [[David J. A. Clines|David Clines]] gives the example of [[Book of Amos|Amos]] 6.12. It reads: "Does one plough with oxen? The obvious answer is 'yes', but the context of the passage seems to demand a 'no'; the usual reading therefore is to amend this to, 'Does one plough ''the sea'' with oxen?' The amendment has a basis in the text, which is believed to be corrupted, but is nevertheless a matter of personal judgment."&lt;ref name="David J. A. Clines"&gt;{{cite book|last=Clines|first=David J.

Yet any of these can be contested, as well as any conclusions based on them, and they often are. For example, in the late 1700s, textual critic [[Johann Jacob Griesbach]] developed fifteen critical principles for determining which texts are likely the oldest and closest to the original.&lt;ref name="Paul D. Wegner"/&gt;{{rp|213}}  One of Griesbach's rules is ''[[lectio brevior]] praeferenda'': "the shorter reading is preferred". This was based on the idea scribes were more likely to add to a text than omit from it, making shorter texts more likely to be older.  Latin scholar Albert C. Clark challenged this in 1914.&lt;ref name="Metzger and Ehrman"/&gt;{{rp|212–215}} Based on his study of [[Cicero]], Clark argued omission was a more common scribal error than addition, saying "A text is like a traveler who goes from one inn to another losing an article of luggage at each stop."&lt;ref name="Metzger and Ehrman"/&gt;{{rp|213}} Clark's claims were criticized by those who supported Griesbach's principles. Clark responded, but disagreement continued. Nearly eighty years later, the theologian and priest James Royse took up the case. After close study of multiple New Testament papyri, he concluded Clark was right.&lt;ref name="Metzger and Ehrman" /&gt;{{rp|214}}  Some scholars have recently called to abandon older approaches to textual criticism in favor of new computer-assisted methods for determining manuscript relationships in a more reliable way.&lt;ref name="Tommy Wasserman"/&gt;{{rp|5}}

=== Source criticism ===
{{Main|Source criticism}} {{See also|Pentateuchal criticism}}
[[Source criticism (biblical studies)|Source criticism]] is the search for the original sources that form the basis of biblical text. It can be traced back to the 17th-century French priest [[Richard Simon (priest)|Richard Simon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Muller, R. A. |chapter=Biblical Interpretation in the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries: The Post-reformation Era |editor1-last=McKim |editor1-first=Donald K. |title=Dictionary of Major Biblical Interpreters |date=2007 |publisher=IVP Academic |location=Downers Grove, Ill. |isbn=978-0-8308-2927-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|35}} In Old Testament studies, source criticism is generally focused on identifying sources within a single text.  For example, the modern view of the origins of the book of Genesis was first laid in 1753 by the French physician [[Jean Astruc]]. He presumed [[Moses]] used ancient documents to write it, so his goal was identifying and reconstructing those documents by separating the book of Genesis back into those original sources. He discovered Genesis alternates use of two different names for God while the rest of the Pentateuch after [[Exodus (book of the Bible)|Exodus]] 3 omits that alternation.&lt;ref name="Jean Astruc"/&gt;{{rp|166–168}} He found repetitions of certain events, such as parts of the [[flood myth|flood story]] that are repeated three times. He also found apparent anachronisms: statements seemingly from a later time than Genesis was set. Astruc hypothesized that this separate material was fused into a single unit that became the book of Genesis thereby creating its duplications and parallelisms.&lt;ref name="Rudolf Smend"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Smend |first1=Rudolf|title=From Astruc to Zimmerli: Old Testament Scholarship in Three Centuries |date=2007 |publisher=Mohr Siebeck |location=Germany |isbn=978-3-16-149338-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|7}}&lt;ref name="Emanuel Tov"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Tov |first1=Emanuel|title=Textual Criticism of the Hebrew Bible |date=2001 |publisher=Fortress Press|location=Minneapolis, Minnesota |isbn=978-0-80069-664-1 |edition=  Second Revised}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|336}}  Further examples of the products of source criticism include its two most influential and well-known theories concerning the origins of the [[Torah|Pentateuch]] (the [[Documentary hypothesis]]) and the four gospels ([[two-source hypothesis]]).&lt;ref name ="Campbell"/&gt;{{rp|5}}&lt;ref name="Donald Guthrie"/&gt;{{rp|147}}

==== Wellhausen's documentary hypothesis ====
{{Main|Documentary hypothesis|Supplementary hypothesis}}

[[File:Wellhause 222.jpg|thumb|upright=.8|alt=photo of head and shoulders painting of Wellhausen, looking directly at camera|[[Julius Wellhausen]], one of the originators of the [[documentary hypothesis]]]]
Theologian [[Antony F. Campbell]] says source criticism's most influential work is [[Julius Wellhausen]]'s ''[[Prolegomena zur Geschichte Israels]]'' (''Prologue to the History of Israel'', 1878) which sought to establish the sources of the first five books of the Old Testament.&lt;ref name ="Campbell"/&gt;{{rp|1–18}} Wellhausen correlated the history and development of those five books, known as the Pentateuch, with the development of the Jewish faith.&lt;ref name="Nicholson"/&gt;{{rp|3}}&lt;ref name="Joel S. Baden"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Baden |first1=Joel S. |title=The Composition of the Pentateuch: Renewing the Documentary Hypothesis |date=2012 |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven |isbn=978-0-300-15263-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|247}} The Documentary hypothesis, also known as the ''JEDP'' theory, or the Wellhausen theory, says the Pentateuch was combined out of four separate and coherent sources known as ''J'' (which stands for ''[[Jahwist|Yahwist]]'', which is spelled with a ''J'' in German), ''E'' (for ''[[Elohist]]''), ''D'' (for ''[[Deuteronomist]]''), and ''P'' (for the ''[[Priestly source]]'').&lt;ref name="Campbell"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Campbell |first1=Anthony F. |last2=O'Brien |first2=Mark A.|title=Sources of the Pentateuch: Texts, Introductions, Annotations |date=1993 |publisher=Fortress Press |location=Minneapolis, Minnesota |isbn=978-0-80062-701-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2}} Old Testament scholar [[Karl Heinrich Graf|Karl Graf]] (1815–1869) suggested the ''P'' in 1866 as the last stratum of the Wellhausen theory.&lt;ref name="Handbook" /&gt;{{rp|382}}&lt;ref name="John Kaltner"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kaltner |first1=John |last2=McKenzie |first2=Steven Linn |title=The Old Testament: Its Background, Growth, and Content |date=2007 |publisher=Wipf &amp; Stock |location=Eugene, Oregon |isbn=978-1-62564-264-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|58}} Therefore, the Documentary hypothesis is sometimes also referred to as the ''Graf&amp;ndash;Wellhausen hypothesis''.&lt;ref name="Soulengraf-well"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Soulen| first1=Richard N.|last2=Soulen|first2=R. Kendall|title=Handbook of Biblical criticism|publisher=Westminster John Knox Press|location=Louisville, Kentucky| isbn=978-0-664-22314-4|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|69}} Later scholars inferred more sources, with increasing information about their extent and inter-relationship.&lt;ref name="Pauline A. Viviano"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Viviano |first1=Pauline A. |editor1-last=Haynes |editor1-first=Stephen R. |editor2-last=McKenzie |editor2-first=Steven L. |title=To Each Its Own Meaning: An Introduction to Biblical Criticisms and Their Application |date=1999 |publisher=Westminster John Knox Press |location=Louisville Kentucky |isbn=978-0-664-25784-2 |chapter=Source Criticism}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|38}}

The fragmentary theory was a later understanding of Wellhausen produced by form criticism. This theory argues that fragments of various documents, and not continuous documents, are the sources for the Pentateuch. This accounts for diversity but not structural and chronological consistency. The [[Supplementary hypothesis]] can be seen as an evolution of the Documentary hypothesis that solidified in the 1970s. Proponents of this view assert three sources for the Pentateuch, with the Deuteronomist as the oldest source, and the Torah assembled from a central core document, the Elohist, then supplemented by fragments taken from other sources.&lt;ref name="John Van Seters"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Van Seters |first1=John |title=The Pentateuch: A Social-Science Commentary |date=2015 |publisher=Bloomsbury T &amp; T Clark |location=New York |isbn=978-0-56765-879-1 |edition= Second}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|23,55}}

Advocates of the Documentary hypothesis contend it accounts well for the differences and duplication found in each of the Pentateuchal books. Furthermore, they argue, it provides an explanation for the peculiar character of the material labeled P, which reflects the perspective and concerns of Israel's priests. However, the original theory has also been heavily criticized. Old Testament scholar [[Ernest Nicholson]] says that by the end of the 1970s and into the 1990s, "one major study after another, like a series of hammer blows, ... rejected the main claims of the Documentary theory, and the criteria on ... which those claims are grounded."&lt;ref name="Nicholson"/&gt;{{rp|95}} It has been criticized for its dating of the sources, for assuming that the original sources were coherent, and for assuming E and P were originally complete documents. Studies of the literary structure of the Pentateuch have shown J and P used the same structure, and that motifs and themes cross the boundaries of the various sources, which undermines arguments for separate origins.&lt;ref name="Campbell" /&gt;{{rp|4}}&lt;ref name="John Kaltner" /&gt;{{rp|50,58,59}} Problems and criticisms of the Documentary hypothesis have been brought on by such literary analysis, but also by anthropological developments, and by various archaeological findings, such as those indicating Hebrew is older than previously believed.&lt;ref name="Joshua A. Berman"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Berman |first1=Joshua A.|title=Inconsistency in the Torah: Ancient Literary Convention and the Limits of Source Criticism |date=2017 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-19065-880-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|273–275}}&lt;ref name="Nicholson"/&gt;{{rp|95,222}} Presently, few biblical scholars still hold to Wellhausen's Documentary hypothesis in its classical form. However, while current debate has modified Wellhausen's conclusions, Nicholson says "for all that it needs revision and development in detail, [the work of Wellhausen] remains the securest basis for understanding the Pentateuch."&lt;ref name="Nicholson"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Nicholson |first1=Ernest|title=The Pentateuch in the Twentieth Century: The Legacy of Julius Wellhausen |date=2002 |publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York |isbn=978-0-19-925783-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|95–132;228}}  Critical scholar Pauline Viviano agrees, stating that the general contours of Wellhausen's view remain with the [[Newer Documentary Hypothesis]] providing the best answers to the complex question of how the Pentateuch was formed.&lt;ref name="Pauline A.

In New Testament studies, source criticism has taken a slightly different approach from Old Testament studies by focusing on identifying the common sources of multiple texts. This has revealed the Gospels are both products of sources and sources themselves.&lt;ref name="David Wenham"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wenham|first=David|chapter= Source Criticism|year=1979|editor1-last=Marshall|editor1-first=I. Howard|title=New Testament Interpretation: Essays on Principles and Methods|edition= Revised|publisher=The Paternoster Press|location=Carlisle|isbn=978-0-85364-424-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|53}} As sources, [[Book of Matthew|Matthew]], [[Book of Mark|Mark]] and [[Book of Luke|Luke]] are partially dependent on each other and partially independent of each other. This is called the [[synoptic problem]], and explaining it is the single greatest dilemma of New Testament source criticism.&lt;ref name="Donald Guthrie"/&gt;{{rp|136–209}}  Multiple theories exist to address the dilemma. However, two theories have become predominant: the [[two-source hypothesis]] and the [[four document hypothesis|four-source hypothesis]].&lt;ref name="Donald Guthrie"/&gt;{{rp|136–208,1029–1045}}

Mark is the shortest of the four gospels with only 661 verses, but six hundred of those verses are in Matthew and 350 of them are in Luke. Some of these verses are copied verbatim. Most scholars agree that this indicates Mark was a source for Matthew and Luke. There is also some verbatim agreement between Matthew and Luke of verses not found in Mark. In 1838, the religious philosopher [[Christian Hermann Weisse]] developed a theory about this. He postulated a hypothetical collection of Jesus' sayings from an additional source called Q, taken from ''Quelle'', which is German for "source".&lt;ref name="William Graham Scroggie"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Scroggie |first1=William Graham |title=A Guide to the Gospels |date=1995 |publisher=Kregel Publications |location=Grand Rapids, Michigan |isbn=978-0-8254-3744-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|342}} If this document existed, it has now been lost, but some of its material can be deduced indirectly. Comparing what is common to Matthew and Luke, yet absent in Mark, the critical scholar [[Heinrich Julius Holtzmann]] demonstrated (in 1863) the probable existence of Q well enough for it to be accepted as a likely second source, along with Mark, for Matthew and Luke.  This allowed the two-source hypothesis to emerge as the best supported of the various synoptic solutions.&lt;ref name="I. Howard Marshall"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Marshall |editor1-first=I. Howard |title=New Testament Interpretation: Essays on Principles and Methods |date=1977 |publisher=Wipf &amp; Stock |location=Eugene, Oregon |isbn=978-1-59752-696-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|148}} There is also material unique to each gospel. This indicates additional separate sources for Matthew and for Luke. Biblical scholar [[Burnett Hillman Streeter|B. H. Streeter]] used this insight to refine and expand the two-source theory into a four-source theory in 1925.&lt;ref name="David J. Neville"/&gt;{{rp|127}}

While most scholars agree that the two-source theory offers the best explanation for the Synoptic problem, it has not gone without dispute. The Synoptic Seminar disbanded in 1982, reporting that its members "could not agree on a single thing", leading some to claim the problem is unsolvable.&lt;ref name="Elwell and Yarbrough"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Elwell |first1=Walter A. |author1-link=Walter A.

=== Form criticism ===
{{Main|Form criticism|Sitz im Leben}}

Form criticism began in the early twentieth century when theologian [[Karl Ludwig Schmidt]] observed that Mark's Gospel is composed of short units. Schmidt asserted these small units were remnants and evidence of the oral tradition that preceded the writing of the gospels.&lt;ref name="Richard Bauckham"/&gt;{{rp|242}}&lt;ref name="Robert D. Miller"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Miller II |first1=Robert D. |title=Oral Tradition in Ancient Israel |date=2011 |publisher=Cascade Books |location=Eugene, Oregon |isbn=978-1-61097-271-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1}} Bible scholar [[Richard Bauckham]] says this "most significant insight," which established the foundation of form criticism, has never been refuted.&lt;ref name="Richard Bauckham"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bauckham |first1=Richard|title=Jesus and the Eyewitnesses |date=2006 |publisher=Eerdmans |location=Grand Rapids, Michigan |isbn=978-0-8028-6390-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|243}}  [[Hermann Gunkel]] (1862–1932) and [[Martin Dibelius]] (1883-1947) built from this insight and pioneered form criticism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Mihelic |first=Joseph |title=The Influence of Form Criticism on the Study of the Old Testament |journal=Journal of the American Academy of Religion |year=1951 |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=120–129 |doi=10.1093/jaarel/XIX.3.120 |url=https://academic.oup.com/jaar/article-abstract/XIX/3/120/747016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Form criticism breaks the Bible down into those short units, called ''[[pericope]]s'', which are then classified by genre: prose or verse, letters, laws, court archives, war hymns, poems of lament, and so on. Form criticism then theorizes concerning the individual pericope's ''[[Sitz im Leben]]'' ("setting in life" or "place in life"). Based on their understanding of [[folklore]], form critics believed the early Christian communities formed the sayings and teachings of Jesus according to their needs (their "situation in life"), and that each form could be identified by the situation in which it had been created.&lt;ref name="Eddy &amp; Boyd"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Eddy |first1=Paul Rhodes |last2=Boyd |first2=Gregory A. |title=The Jesus Legend |date=2007 |publisher=Baker Academic |location=Grand Rapids, Michigan |isbn=978-0-8010-3114-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|271}}&lt;ref name="Maureen W.

Form criticism, represented by Rudof Bultmann, its most influential proponent, was the dominant method in the field of biblical criticism for nearly 80 years. However, Old Testament scholar [[Rolf Knierim]] says contemporary scholars have produced an "explosion of studies" on structure, genre, text-type, setting and language that challenge several of its aspects and assumptions.&lt;ref name="Rolf Knierim"/&gt;{{rp|42,70}}&lt;ref name="Richard A.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The general critique of form criticism came from various sources, putting several areas in particular under scrutiny. The analogy between the development of the gospel pericopae and folklore needed reconsideration because of developments in folklore studies; it was less easy to assume the steady growth of an oral tradition in stages... the length of time needed for the "laws" of oral transmission to operate was greater than taken by the gospels; even the existence of such laws was questioned.&lt;ref name="Richard A.

In the early to mid twentieth century, Bultmann and other form critics said they had found oral "laws of development" within the New Testament.&lt;ref name=Meier124&gt;{{cite book|last=Meier|first=John P.|chapter=Criteria: How Do We Decide What Comes From Jesus?|title=The Historical Jesus in Recent Research|editor1=James D.

On all counts the tradition developed in opposite directions. It became both longer and shorter, both more or less detailed, and both more and less Semitic.

Miller"/&gt;{{rp|10}} Writing tends to develop in a linear manner, beginning with a crude first draft which is then edited bit by bit to become more polished.  Oral tradition is more complex and multidirectional in its development.&lt;ref name="Eddy &amp; Boyd" /&gt;{{rp|291–298}}  Religion scholar Burke O. Long sums up the contemporary view by observing that, since oral tradition does not follow the same developmental pattern as written texts, laws of oral development cannot be arrived at by studying written texts.&lt;ref name="Eddy &amp; Boyd" /&gt;{{rp|295}}&lt;ref name="Burke O.

Additional challenges of form criticism have also been raised. For example, biblical studies scholar Werner H. Kelber says form criticism throughout the mid-twentieth century was so focused toward finding each pericope's original form, that it distracted from any serious consideration of memory as a dynamic force in the construction of the gospels or the early church community tradition.&lt;ref name="Werner H. Kelber"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kelber |first1=Werner H.|title=Imprints, Voiceprints, and Footprints of Memory: Collected Essays of Werner H.

Form criticism assumed the early Church was heavily influenced by that culture.&lt;ref name="Laurence W. Wood" /&gt;{{rp|46}} However, in the 1970s, E. P. Sanders, as well as Gerd Theissen, sparked new rounds of studies that included anthropological and sociological perspectives, reestablishing Judaism as the predominant influence on Jesus, Paul and the New Testament. New Testament scholar [[N. T. Wright]] says, "The earliest traditions of Jesus reflected in the Gospels are written from the perspective of [[Second Temple Judaism]] [and] must be interpreted from the standpoint of [[Jewish eschatology]] and [[apocalypticism]]."&lt;ref name="Laurence W. Wood"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wood |first1=Laurence W. |title=Theology as History and Hermeneutics: A Post-Critical Conversation with Contemporary Theology |date=2005 |publisher=Emeth Press |location=Lexington, Kentucky |isbn=978-0-97554-355-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|36–38,47}}&lt;ref name="Mark Allan Powell"&gt;{{cite book |last=Powell|first=Mark Allan|editor1-last=(ed.)

Bultmann has been personally criticized for being overly focused on [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger's]] philosophy in his philosophical foundation, and for working with ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' notions concerning "folklore, the distinction between Palestinian and Hellenistic communities, the length of the oral period, and more, that were not derived from study but were instead constructed according to a preconceived pattern".&lt;ref name="Stanley E. Porter"&gt;{{cite book|last=Porter| first=Stanley E.|title=The Criteria for Authenticity in Historical-Jesus Research: Previous Discussion and New Proposals|publisher=T&amp;T Clark International|location=New York|isbn=978-0-56704-360-3|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|19}}&lt;ref name="Richard Bauckham"/&gt;{{rp|247–249}}  For some, the many challenges to form criticism mean its future is in doubt.{{refn|group=note|Anthony Campbell says, "... form criticism has a future if its past is allowed a decent burial; form criticism has been relegated now from its high status in the past: it  no longer attracts scholars"; Erhard Blum observes problems, and he wonders if one can speak of a current form-critical method at all; Thomas Römer raises the question of the validity of ''Sitz im Leben''; "Such is the question asked by Won Lee: one wonders whether Gunkel's form criticism is still viable today."&lt;ref name="Sweeney &amp; Zvi"/&gt;}} Bible scholar Anthony J. Campbell says:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Form criticism had a meteoric rise in the early part of the twentieth century and fell from favor toward its end. For some, the future of form criticism is not an issue: it has none.  But if form criticism embodies an essential insight, it will continue. ...Two elements embody this insight and give it its value: concern for the nature of the text and for its shape and structure... If the encrustations can be scraped away, the "good stuff" may still be there.&lt;ref name="Sweeney &amp; Zvi"/&gt;{{rp|15–16}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Redaction criticism====
[[File:Relationship between synoptic gospels-en.svg|thumb|upright=1.2|alt=diagram of how much of gospels is shared and different|A diagram of the complexity of the Synoptic problem]]
''Redaction'' is the process of editing multiple sources, often with a similar theme, into a single document. Redaction critics focus on discovering how the literary units were originally edited—"redacted"—into their current forms. [[Redaction criticism]] developed after World War II in Germany and in the 1950s in England and North America, and can be seen as a correlative to form criticism.&lt;ref name="David R. Law1"/&gt;{{rp|181}}&lt;ref name="Daniel J. Harrington"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Harrington |first1=Daniel J. |title=Interpreting the New Testament: A Practical Guide |date=1990|orig-year=1979 |publisher=The Liturgical Press |location=Collegeville, Minnesota |isbn=0-8146-5124-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|96–97}} It is dependent on both source and form criticism, because it is necessary to identify the traditions before determining how the redactor has made use of them.&lt;ref name="David R. Law1"/&gt;{{rp|181}} However, redaction criticism rejects source and form criticism's description of the Bible texts as mere collections of fragments. Where form criticism fractures the biblical elements into smaller and smaller individual pieces, redaction criticism attempts to interpret the whole literary unit.&lt;ref name="Redaction criticism"&gt;{{cite web |title=Redaction Criticism |url=http://www.oxfordbiblicalstudies.com/article/opr/t94/e1597 |work=Oxford Dictionary of the Bible|editor=W. R. F. Browning|publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2004|accessdate=25 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, redaction criticism "provides a corrective to the methodological imbalance of form criticism".&lt;ref name="Soulenfourth"&gt;Quote in {{cite book |last1=Soulen |first1=Richard N. |last2=Soulen |first2=R. Kendall |title=Handbook of Biblical Criticism |date=2001 |publisher=Westminster John Knox Press |location=Louisville, Kentucky |isbn=978-0-664-23534-5|edition=  Third}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|159}}&lt;ref&gt;See also {{cite book |last1=Harrington |first1=Daniel J. |title=Interpreting the New Testament: A Practical Guide |date=1990|orig-year=1979 |publisher=The Liturgical Press |location=Collegeville, Minnesota |isbn=0-8146-5124-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|96–108}} Form criticism saw the synoptic writers as mere collectors and focused on the ''Sitz im Leben'' as the creator of the texts. Redaction criticism deals more positively with the Gospel writers restoring an understanding of them as theologians of the early church.&lt;ref name="Redaction criticism"/&gt; Bible scholars Richard and Kendall Soulen explain that when redaction criticism is applied to the synoptic gospels, "it is the evangelist's use, disuse or alteration of the traditions open to him that is in view, rather than the form and original setting of the traditions themselves."&lt;ref name="SoulenThird"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Soulen |first1= Richard N. |last2= Soulen |first2= R. Kendall|title= Handbook of Biblical Criticism |date= 2001|publisher= Westminster John Knox Press |location= Lexington, Kentucky|isbn= 978-0-664-22314-4 |edition=  Third}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|159}}

Since redaction criticism was developed from form criticism, it shares many of its weaknesses. For example, it assumes an extreme skepticism toward the historicity of Jesus and the gospels just as form criticism does. Redaction criticism seeks the historical community of the final redactors of the gospels, though there is often no textual clue, and its method in finding the final editor's theology is flawed.&lt;ref name="Porter and Adams"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lee |first1=Jae Hyun |editor1-last=Porter |editor1-first=Stanley E. |editor2-last=Adams|editor2-first=Sean A.| title=Pillars in the History of Biblical Interpretation: Prevailing Methods Before 1980|volume=1 |date=2016 |publisher=Wipf and Stock |location=Eugene, Oregon |isbn=978-1-4982-8761-6|chapter=Günther Bornkamm and Redaction Criticism}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|335,336}} In the New Testament, redaction discerns the evangelist's theology by focusing and relying upon the differences between the gospels, yet it is unclear whether every difference has theological meaning, how much meaning, or whether a difference is a stylistic or even an accidental change. Further, it is not at all clear whether the difference was made by the evangelist, who could have used the already–changed–story when writing a gospel.&lt;ref name="Porter and Adams"/&gt;{{rp|336}}  The evangelist's theology more likely depends on what the gospels have in common as well as their differences.&lt;ref name="Porter and Adams"/&gt;{{rp|336}}

One of the weaknesses of redaction criticism in its New Testament application is that it assumes Markan priority. Redaction criticism can only function when sources are already known, and since redaction criticism of the Synoptics has been based on the Markan priority of two-source theory, if the priority of Matthew is ever established, redaction criticism would have to begin all over again.&lt;ref name="SoulenThird"/&gt;{{rp|159}} Followers of other theories concerning the Synoptic problem, such as those who support the [[Two-gospel hypothesis|Greisbach hypothesis]] which says Matthew was written first, Luke second, and Mark third, do not accept redaction criticism.&lt;ref name="Porter and Adams"/&gt;{{rp|335}}

=== Literary criticism ===
{{Main|Literary criticism}}

[[File:Northrop Frye sitting on a bench at the University of Toronto.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|alt=Statue of [[Northrop Frye]] sitting on a bench at the University of Toronto|Statue of [[Northrop Frye]], an important figure in biblical criticism, on a bench in Toronto.]]
Literary criticism shifted scholarly attention from historical and pre-compositional matters to the text itself, becoming the dominant form of biblical criticism in a relatively short period of about thirty years. New Testament scholar [[Paul R. House]] says the discipline of linguistics, new views of historiography, and the decline of older methods of criticism opened the door for literary criticism.&lt;ref name="House"/&gt;{{rp|3}} In 1957 literary critic [[Northrop Frye]] wrote an analysis of the Bible from the perspective of his literary background that used literary criticism to understand the Bible forms. It became influential in moving biblical criticism from a historical to a literary focus.&lt;ref name="House"&gt;{{cite book |first1= |editor1-last=House |editor1-first=Paul R. |title=Beyond Form Criticism: Essays in Old Testament Literary Criticism |date=1992 |publisher=Eisenbrauns |location=Winona Lake, Indiana |isbn=978-0-931464-65-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|3–4}}

By 1974, the two methodologies being used in literary criticism were [[Rhetorical criticism|rhetorical analysis]] and [[structuralism]]. Rhetorical analysis divides a passage into units, observes how a single unit shifts or breaks, taking special note of poetic devices, meter, parallelism, word play and so on. It then charts the writer's thought progression from one unit to the next, and finally, assembles the data in an attempt to explain the author's intentions behind the piece.&lt;ref name="House" /&gt;{{rp|8}} Structuralism looks at the language to discern "layers of meaning" with the goal of uncovering a work's "deep structures": the premises as well as the purposes of the author.&lt;ref name="House"/&gt;{{rp|9–12}} In 1981 literature scholar [[Robert Alter]] also contributed to the development of biblical literary criticism by publishing an influential analysis of biblical themes from a literary perspective. The 1980s saw the rise of [[Formalism (literature)|formalism]], which focuses on plot, structure, character and themes. [[Reader-response criticism]], which focuses on the reader rather than the author, was put forward by the Old Testament scholar [[David M. Gunn]] in 1987.&lt;ref name="House"/&gt;{{rp|5}}

New Testament scholar [[Donald Guthrie (theologian)|Donald Guthrie]] highlights a flaw in the literary critical approach to the Gospels. The genre of the Gospels has not been fully determined. No conclusive evidence has yet been produced to settle the question of genre, and without genre, no adequate parallels can be found, and without parallels "it must be considered to what extent the principles of literary criticism are applicable."&lt;ref name="Donald Guthrie"/&gt;{{rp|19}} The validity of using the same critical methods for novels and for the Gospels, without the assurance the Gospels are actually novels, must be questioned.&lt;ref name="Donald Guthrie"/&gt;{{rp|20}}

====Types of literary criticism====
{{Main|Canonical criticism|Rhetorical criticism|Narrative criticism}}
Canonical criticism has both theological and literary roots. Its origins are found in the Church's views of scripture as sacred as well as in the literary critics who began to influence biblical scholarship in the 1940s and 1950s. Canonical criticism responded to two things: 1) the sense that biblical criticism had obscured the meaning and authority of the canon of scripture; and 2) the fundamentalism in the Christian Church that had arisen in America in the 1920s and 1930s. Canonical criticism does not reject historical criticism and sociological analysis, but considers them secondary in importance.&lt;ref name="Edgar W. Conrad"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Conrad |first1=Edgar W. |title=Reading the Latter Prophets: Toward a New Canonical Criticism |date=2003 |publisher=T &amp; T Clark |location=New York |isbn=0-5670-8452-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|46,47}}  Canonical critics believe the texts should be treated with respect as the canon of a believing community.&lt;ref name="canonical criticism"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Barton |first1=John |title=Reading the Old Testament: Method in Biblical Study |date=1996 |publisher=Westminster John Knox Press |location=Louisville, Kentucky|edition= Second |isbn=978-0-664-25724-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|77–79,90,100,102}} Canonical critics use the tools of biblical criticism to study the books of the Bible, but approach the books as whole units.&lt;ref&gt;Oswalt, John N. (1987). "[https://www.etsjets.org/files/JETS-PDFs/30/30-3/30-3-pp317-325_JETS.pdf Canonical Criticism: A Review From A Conservative Viewpoint]", ''[[Journal of the Evangelical Theological Society]]'' 30.3&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|318,320}} They take the books as finished works and treat each book as a unity, instead of taking them apart and focusing on isolated pieces. This begins from the position that scripture contains within it what is needed to understand it, rather than being understandable only as the product of a historically determined process.&lt;ref name="Wall"&gt;{{cite book |author=James A. Sanders|chapter=Foreward|editor1-last=Wall |editor1-first=Robert W. |editor2-last=Lemcio |editor2-first=Eugene |title=The New Testament as Canon: A Reader in Canonical Criticism |date=1992 |publisher=T&amp;T Clark|location=Sheffield, England |isbn=978-1-85075-374-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|7–11}}  Canonical criticism helped literary criticism move biblical studies in a new direction by focusing on the text rather than the author. It uses the text itself, the needs of the communities addressed by those texts, and the interpretation likely to have been formed originally to meet those needs. The canonical critic then relates this to the overall canon. Canonical criticism is associated with [[Brevard S. Childs]] (1923–2007), though he declined to use the term.&lt;ref&gt;Norman K. Gottwald (October 1985), "[http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/004057368504200305 Social Matrix and Canonical Shape]", ''Theology Today''. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100531012200/http://theologytoday.ptsem.edu/oct1985/v42-3-article3.htm |date=2010-05-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="John H.

[[James Muilenburg]] (1896&amp;ndash;1974) is often referred to as "the prophet of rhetorical criticism".&lt;ref name="H. G. M. WILLIAMSON"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Williamson |first1=H. G. M. |title=Review of ''Hearing and Speaking the Word: Selections from the Works of James Muilenberg |url=https://doi.org/10.1093/jss/XXXV.1.145 |website=Journal of Semitic Studies,|volume=35|issue=1|publisher=Oxford University Press |accessdate=3 October 2018 |archivedate=1 March 1990 |pages=145–146}}&lt;/ref&gt; A product of the 1960s, rhetorical criticism seeks to understand text type, as does form criticism, but moves beyond form criticism by looking into the inner theological meaning the author was trying to communicate. The rhetorical scholar [[Sonja K. Foss]] says there are ten methods of practicing rhetorical criticism, but each focuses on three dimensions of rhetoric: the authors, what they use to communicate, and what they are trying to communicate.&lt;ref name="Sonja K. Foss"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Foss |first1=Sonja K. |title=Rhetorical Criticism: Exploration and Practice |date=2009 |publisher=Waveland Press |location=Long Grove, Illinois |isbn=978-1-57766-586-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|6}} Rhetorical criticism is the systematic effort to understand the message being communicated in a focused and conscious manner. Biblical rhetorical criticism asks how hearing the texts impacted the audience. It attempts to discover and evaluate the rhetorical devices, language, and methods of communication used within the texts to accomplish the goals of those texts.&lt;ref name="D. F.

Within narrative criticism, critics approach scripture as story. Narrative criticism began being used to study the New Testament in the 1970s,&lt;ref name="Mark Allan Powell2"/&gt;{{rp|6}} and a decade later, study also included the Old Testament. However, the first time a published approach was labeled ''narrative criticism'' was in 1980, in the article "Narrative Criticism and the Gospel of Mark," written by Bible scholar David Rhoads.&lt;ref name="Sidney Greidanus"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Greidanus |first1=Sidney |title=The Modern Preacher and the Ancient Text: Interpreting and Preaching Biblical Literature|year=1988 |publisher=Eerdmans |location=Grand Rapids, Michigan |isbn=978-0-8028-0360-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|278}} Narrative criticism has its foundations in form criticism, but it is not a historical discipline. It is purely literary. Historical critics began to recognize the Bible was not being studied in the manner other ancient writings were studied, and they began asking if these texts should be understood on their own terms before being used as evidence of something else like history.&lt;ref name="Mark Allan Powell2"/&gt;{{rp|3}} It is now accepted as "axiomatic in literary circles that the meaning of literature transcends the historical intentions of the author."&lt;ref name="Mark Allan Powell2"/&gt;{{rp|5}} Narrative criticism embraces the textual unity of canonical criticism, while admitting the existence of the sources and redactions of historical criticism. Narrative critics choose to focus on the artistic weaving of the biblical texts into a sustained narrative picture.&lt;ref name="Mark Allan Powell2"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Powell |first1=Mark Allan |title=What is Narrative Criticism? |date=1990 |publisher=Augsburg Fortress |location=Minneapolis, Minnesota |isbn=978-0-80060-473-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2–5}} The literary scholar Steven Weitzman (1892–1957) has argued that "narrative economy" (omitting comments about the thoughts or emotional state of a character) and "narrative unity" are what make the text a "work of art".&lt;ref name="Christopher T. Paris"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Paris |first1=Christopher T. |title=Narrative Obtrusion in the Hebrew Bible |date=2014 |publisher=Fortress Press |location=Minneapolis, Minnesota |isbn=978-1-4514-8211-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|9}} Narrative critics encourage the "implied reader" to see biblical characters as literary figures, observe textual unity, the importance of the narrator, "implied" [[authorial intent]], and to be aware that a narrative can be interpreted in multiple ways.&lt;ref name="Weitzman, Steven"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Weitzman |first1=Steven |title=Before and After ''The Art of Biblical Narrative''|journal=Prooftexts|volume=27|issue=2|year=2007|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2979/pft.2007.27.2.191?seq=1#page_scan_tab_contents|publisher=JSTOR |pages=191–210}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This perspective is key, Auerbach says: "Since so much in [Bible stories] is dark and incomplete, and since the reader knows that God is a hidden god, [the reader's] effort to interpret it constantly finds something new to feed on... there is no end for interpretation."&lt;ref name="Petri Merenlahti"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Merenlahti |first1=Petri |title=A Smaller God: On the Divinely Human Nature of Biblical Literature |date=2015 |publisher=Cascade Books |location=Eugene, Oregon |isbn=978-1-62564-410-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|49}}

The Quest for the historical Jesus, also known as life of Jesus research, is an area of biblical criticism that seeks to reconstruct the life and teachings of [[Jesus]] of Nazareth by [[Historical criticism|critical historical methods]].&lt;ref name="J.

The quest was a product of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] skepticism of the late eighteenth century and produced a stark division between history and theology.&lt;ref name="J. A.

They saw the purpose of a historically true life of Jesus as a critical force that functioned theologically against the high Christology established by Roman Catholicism centuries before.&lt;ref name=GerdD5/&gt;{{rp|1}}

After Albert Schweitzer's ''Von Reimarus zu Wrede'' was published as ''The Quest of the Historical Jesus'' in 1910, its title provided the label for the field of study for the next eighty years.&lt;ref name="J.

E. P. Sanders explains that, because of the desire to know everything about Jesus, including his thoughts and motivations, and because there are such varied conclusions about him, it seems to many scholars that it is impossible to be certain about anything. Yet according to Sanders, "we know a lot" about Jesus. Sanders' view characterizes most contemporary studies.&lt;ref name="Sanders Historical"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sanders |first1=E.

At first, biblical historical criticism and its deductions and implications were so unpopular outside liberal Protestant scholarship it created a schism in Protestantism.&lt;ref name="David Harrington Watt"/&gt;&lt;ref name="religion.oxfordre.com"&gt;Bendroth, M.

[[William Robertson Smith]] (1846–1894) is an example of a nineteenth century [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] who believed historical criticism was a legitimate outgrowth of the [[Protestant Reformation]]'s focus on the biblical text. He saw it as a "necessary tool to enable intelligent churchgoers" to understand the Bible, and was a pioneer in establishing the final form of the [[supplementary hypothesis]] of the documentary hypothesis. A similar view was later advocated by the [[Primitive Methodist]] biblical scholar [[Arthur Peake|A. S. Peake]] (1865–1929).&lt;ref name="Rogerson" /&gt;{{rp|298}} Other evangelical Protestant scholars such as [[Edwin M. Yamauchi]], [[Paul R. House]], and [[Daniel B. Wallace]] have continued the tradition of conservatives contributing to critical scholarship.

Monseigneur [[Joseph G.

Hebrew Bible scholar [[Marvin A. Sweeney]] argues that some Christian theological assumptions within biblical criticism have reached anti-semitic conclusions. This has discouraged Jews from engaging in biblical criticism.&lt;ref name=Sweeney1997&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sweeney|first1=Marvin A.|title=Why Jews Are Interested in Biblical Theology: A Retrospective on the Work of Jon D.

Levenson]] described how some Jewish scholars, such as [[Rabbinic Judaism|rabbinicist]] [[Solomon Schechter]] {{nowrap|(b. 1903)}}, saw biblical criticism of the Pentateuch as a threat to Jewish identity. The growing anti-semitism in Germany of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the perception that higher criticism was an entirely Christian pursuit, and the sense many Bible critics were not impartial academics but were proponents of [[supersessionism]], prompted Schechter to describe "''Higher Criticism'' as ''Higher Anti-semitism''".&lt;ref name="Jon D. Levinson"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Levenson |first1=Jon D.|title=The Hebrew Bible, the Old Testament, and Historical Criticism: Jews and Christians in Biblical Studies |date=1993 |publisher=Westminster John Knox Press |location=Louisville, Kentucky |isbn=978-0-664-25407-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|42,42,82,83}} Professor of Hebrew Bible Baruch J. Schwartz states that these perceptions delayed Jewish scholars from entering the field of biblical criticism.&lt;ref name="Benjamin D. Sommer"/&gt;{{rp|210}} These problems began to be corrected in the modern era. The [[Holocaust]] led to Christian theologians rethinking ways to relate to Judaism, and the entry of Jewish scholars into academic departments from which they had formerly been excluded aided that process.&lt;ref name=Sweeney1997/&gt;{{rp|142–146}}

The first historical-critical Jewish scholar of Pentateuchal studies was [[Marcus Kalisch|M. M. Kalisch]] in the nineteenth century.&lt;ref name="Benjamin D.

Hoffman wrote an extensive, two-volume, [[philologically]] based critique of the [[Documentary hypothesis|Wellhausen theory]], which supported [[Jewish orthodoxy]]. Bible professor Benjamin D. Sommer says it is "among the most precise and detailed commentaries on the legal texts &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Leviticus]] and [[Deuteronomy]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; ever written."&lt;ref name="Benjamin D. Sommer" /&gt;{{rp|215}} [[Yehezkel Kaufmann]] was the first Jewish scholar to appreciate fully the import of higher criticism. [[Mordechai Breuer]], who branches out beyond most Jewish [[exegesis]] and explores the implications of historical criticism for multiple subjects, is an example of a contemporary Jewish biblical critical scholar.&lt;ref name="Benjamin D.

Socio-scientific criticism is part of the wider trend in biblical criticism reflecting interdisciplinary methods and diversity.&lt;ref name="David G.

Using the perspectives, theories, models, and research of the social sciences to determine what social norms may have influenced the growth of biblical tradition, it is similar to historical biblical criticism in its goals and methods. It has less in common with literary critical approaches. It analyzes the social and cultural dimensions of the text and its environmental context.&lt;ref name="John Hall Elliott"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Elliott |first1=John Hall |title=What is Social-Scientific Criticism?|editor1-last=Via|editor1-first=Dan Otto |date=1993 |publisher=Fortress Press |location=Minneapolis, Minnesota|isbn=978-0-80062-678-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|70}}

In the 1940s and 1950s the term ''postmodern'' came into use to signify a rejection of modern conventions.&lt;ref name="Handbook"/&gt;{{rp|403–404.410}} Many of these early postmodernist views came from France following World War II. Postmodernism has been associated with [[Karl Marx]], [[Sigmund Freud]], radical politics, and arguments against metaphysics and ideology.

Feminist criticism is an aspect of the [[feminist theology]] movement which began in the 1960s and 1970s in the context of Second Wave feminism in the United States.&lt;ref name="Fulkerson &amp; Briggs"&gt;{{cite book|last=Briggs|first=Sheila |editor1-last=Fulkerson |editor1-first=Mary McClintock |editor2-last=Briggs |editor2-first=Sheila |chapter=What is Feminist Theology?|title=The Oxford Handbook of Feminist Theology |date=2012 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=New York |isbn=978-0-19-927388-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1,}} Feminist theology has been ground-breaking in biblical criticism, disrupting the long-standing exclusivity of Christian theology as Western.&lt;ref name="Fulkerson &amp; Briggs"/&gt;{{rp|2}} In the 1980s, Phyllis Trible and [[Elisabeth Schüssler Fiorenza]] reframed biblical criticism itself by challenging the supposed disinterest and objectivity it claimed for itself and exposing how ideological-theological stances had played a critical role in interpretation.&lt;ref name="Elisabeth Schüssler Fiorenza"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fiorenza|first=Elisabeth Schüssler|chapter=Between Movement and Academy: Feminist Biblical Studies in the Twentieth Century|editor1-last=Fiorenza|editor1-first=Elisabeth Schüssler|title=Feminist Biblical Studies in the 20th Century: Scholarship and Movement|date=2014|publisher=Society of Biblical Literature|location=Atlanta, Georgia|isbn=978-1-58983-922-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|56}}  Feminist biblical interpreters are characterized by the claim that classical models of understanding are patriarchal and therefore that makes it impossible for those models to identify the true contribution of women.&lt;ref name="J'annine Jobling"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jobling |first1=J'annine |title=Feminist Biblical Interpretation in Theological Context: Restless Readings |date=2018 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |isbn=978-1-13873-389-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|9}}  Feminist criticism embraces a [[reader-response]] approach to the text that includes an attitude of "dissent" or "resistance."&lt;ref name="Eryl W.

[[Post-critical biblical interpretation]] shares the postmodernist suspicion of non-neutrality of traditional approaches, but is not hostile toward theology.&lt;ref name="Soulenpost-mod" /&gt;{{rp|22}} It begins with the understanding that historical biblical criticism's focus on historicity produced a distinction between the meaning of what the text says and what it is about (what it references).  This produced doubts about the text's veracity. The theologian [[Hans Frei]] writes that what he refers to as the "realistic narratives" of literature, including the Bible, don't allow for such separation.&lt;ref name="Gary Comstock"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Comstock |first1=Gary |title=Truth or Meaning: Ricoeur versus Frei on Biblical Narrative |journal=The Journal of Religion |date=1986 |volume=66 |issue=2 |pages=117–140 |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/1202583?read-now=1&amp;loggedin=true&amp;seq=4#metadata_info_tab_contents|accessdate=8 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|119}} Subject matter is identical to verbal meaning and is found in plot and nowhere else.&lt;ref name="Gary Comstock"/&gt;{{rp|120}} "As Frei puts it, scripture 'simultaneously depicts and renders the reality (if any) of what it talks about'; its subject matter is 'constituted by, or identical with, its narrative'."&lt;ref name="Gary Comstock"/&gt;{{rp|120}}

[[Psychological biblical criticism]] applies psychology to biblical texts; it was not until the 1990s that it began to have an influence among the new critical approaches.&lt;ref name="Wayne Rollins"/&gt;{{rp|67}} Bible scholar Wayne Rollins says the goal of a psychological critical approach is to find expressions of the human psyche in the biblical texts.&lt;ref name="Wayne Rollins"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rollins|first=Wayne|title= Soul and Psyche: The Bible in Psychological Perspective| publisher= Fortress Press|location=Minneapolis, Minnesota| year=1999|isbn=978-0-8006-2716-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|67–74}} It can be used in both a historical and a literary manner to examine the psychological dimensions of scripture through the use of the behavioral sciences.&lt;ref name="D.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10179">The '''Black Radical Congress''' or '''BRC''' is an organization founded in 1998 in [[Chicago]]. It is a grassroots network of individuals and organizations of [[African descent]] focused on advocating for broad [[Progressivism|progressive]] [[social justice]], [[racial equality]] and [[economic justice]] goals within the United States.

==History==

At the organizing congress in [[Chicago]] in June 1998, 2,000 people participated in creating the organization.&lt;ref name="Black Radical Congress"&gt;"[http://socialjustice.ccnmtl.columbia.edu/index.php/Black_Radical_Congress Black Radical Congress]", [[Columbia University]] social justice wiki, accessed 2 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt; However, their first mission predates the organizing congress, having been publicly endorsed and published by a number of high-profile black scholars and activists on 16 March 1998.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.hartford-hwp.com/archives/45a/524.html Black Radical Congress Mission]", accessed 2 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 April 1999, the BRC ratified a "freedom agenda" listing 15 objectives dealing with racial and economic justice in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.blackradicalcongress.org/agenda.html Freedom Agenda] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061206111347/http://www.blackradicalcongress.org/agenda.html |date=December 6, 2006 }}", accessed 2 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The National Council of the BRC adopted a [[mission statement]] on 26 September 1999 in [[East St. Louis]], [[Illinois]]. The opening paragraph states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The purpose of the Black Radical Congress (BRC) is to promote dialogue among African American activists and scholars on the left; to discuss critical issues on the national and international scene that pertain to the Black community; to explore new strategies and directions for progressive political, social and cultural movements; and to renew the Black radical movement through increased unified action.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.blackradicalcongress.org/mission.html Mission Statement of the Black Radical Congress (BRC)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070202101427/http://www.blackradicalcongress.org/mission.html |date=February 2, 2007 }}", accessed 2 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The complete mission statement [https://web.archive.org/web/20070202101427/http://www.blackradicalcongress.org/mission.html] discusses approaches to radical democratic methods involving conferences, forums and publications. "Principles of unity" were also adopted, stating that the BRC was established as a "center without walls" focusing on "transformative politics that focuses on the conditions of Black working and poor people."&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.blackradicalcongress.org/unity.html Principles of Unity] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061206111241/http://www.blackradicalcongress.org/unity.html |date=December 6, 2006 }}", accessed 2 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

A national organizing conference was convened in [[Detroit]] in 2000, and other conferences have taken place in subsequent years. &lt;ref&gt; Rogers, Jamala. “From Conference to Organization: The Challenges of Building the Black Radical Congress.” The Black Scholar, vol. 35, no. 1, 2005, pp. 27. www.jstor.org/stable/41069115. &lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==

The BRC has both individual and organizational memberships. It is headed by a National Congress.{{citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Each year, the BRC chooses a different "theme" to focus its work on; past themes have included [[anti-militarism]] and the [[prison-industrial complex]].&lt;ref name="Black Radical Congress" /&gt;

The BRC has at least two caucuses, subgroups within the organization, the labor and [[working-class]] caucus and the Pat Parker [[Queer]] Caucus.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.blackradicalcongress.org/email.html Email Lists] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061206111146/http://www.blackradicalcongress.org/email.html |date=December 6, 2006 }}", accessed 2 January 2007; "[http://www.blackradicalcongress.org/queer_statement.html A Statement by the Pat Parker Queer Caucus of the Black Radical Congress] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061206111450/http://www.blackradicalcongress.org/queer_statement.html |date=December 6, 2006 }}", dated 19 June 2005, accessed 2 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The BRC has local chapters in Washington, D.C.; the [[San Francisco Bay Area]]; [[Sacramento, California]]; [[Minneapolis]]; [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]]; New York City; [[Raleigh, North Carolina]]; [[Philadelphia]] and [[Pittsburgh]].&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.blackradicalcongress.org/organizing/committees/loc.html Local Organizing Committees] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061207023938/http://www.blackradicalcongress.org/organizing/committees/loc.html |date=December 7, 2006 }}", accessed 2 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principles==
=== Race and racial justice===

The BRC states: "Black is not necessarily a color or hue, but encompasses all peoples of African descent."&lt;ref name="blackradicalcongress.org"&gt;"[http://www.blackradicalcongress.org/index.html Forging a Black Liberation Agenda for the 21st Century] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061206111334/http://www.blackradicalcongress.org/index.html |date=December 6, 2006 }}", accessed 2 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Their work is focused on racial justice as well as broader social and economic justice as it intersects with the politics of race and racial oppression.

===Radical politics===

"Radical means getting to the root causes of society's injustices and working for root-level, fundamental change. Radicalism is an honored tradition in Black political history."&lt;ref name="blackradicalcongress.org" /&gt;

The BRC has many ties to the [[Communist Party, USA]], although the Congress does not explicitly identify itself as [[communist]], [[socialist]] or [[Marxist]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15235">'''Cancer support groups''' are meetings that offer a safe space for people affected by [[cancer]] to share their experiences and emotions with others in similar situations. Much of the sociological construction of these groups is similar to other kinds of other types of [[support group]]s.

Although the experience of people diagnosed with cancer varies greatly from one person to another, they all need a good support system in order to cope throughout the different stages of the process. Different support systems have thus been developed including community support groups, online cancer support groups, networks, forums, and [[charitable organizations]]. Community support groups are usually led by [[psychologists]], [[social workers]], and [[medical professionals]] and can take place in [[Church (building)|churches]], [[hospitals]], or [[community centers]].&lt;ref name="B"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cancer.about.com/od/howtocope/a/supportgroups.htm|title=Cancer Support Groups |date=|accessdate=2010-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Online support groups and forums are a good option for those patients who find it difficult to leave their [[home]] during [[Therapy|treatment]]. People participating in such forums have the possibility to maintain their [[anonymity]]. Support systems range from those that address patients suffering from specific types of cancer to those that support patients suffering from any kind of cancer.

== Providing emotional support ==
Apart from having to cope with the physical and medical challenges, people with cancer face many worries, feelings, and concerns unique to their situation. Cancer patients may find that they need help coping with the emotional as well as the practical aspects of their disease. In fact, attention to the emotional burden of having cancer is often a part of a patient's treatment plan. The support of the health care team (doctors, nurses, social workers), support groups, and patient-to-patient networks can help people feel less isolated and distressed, and improve the quality of their lives&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cancer.org/treatment/understanding-your-diagnosis/talking-about-cancer/how-to-be-a-friend-to-someone-with-cancer.html|title=How to Be a Friend to Someone With Cancer|website=www.cancer.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

More importantly cancer support groups can provide access to the most current information regarding available treatments. Anyone suffering from an uncommon form of cancer should consider joining a specialized online community to gain access to information often not available anywhere else. Cancer support groups provide a setting in which cancer patients can talk about living with cancer with others who may be having similar experiences. 

Also, patients may have different concerns stemming from their particular situation in life which may warrant a special support group that caters specifically to their needs.  For example, there are support groups dedicated to helping women of certain ages through their cancer experience.  Patients may want to speak to a member of their health care team about finding a support group that best suits their needs. Many also find useful basic information in [[National Cancer Institute|NCI]] fact sheets and booklets, including "Taking Time and Facing Forward".

Apart from various improvements in confidence, wellbeing, stress, and interpersonal comfort, cancer support groups are being studied for their direct effects on improving the health of people who attend them.  Some small-scale tests have compared members of a [[breast cancer]] support group at [[Stanford]] against a control group and found significant benefits associated with group membership. These studies are currently being repeated on a larger scale.  Some theories about these benefits ascribe health improvements to reduced stress from talking about emotional issues, the [[placebo effect]], learning about treatment options through interaction with others with common issues. A large-scale research project of cancer online communities is ongoing and may provide some answers about the use of cancer online mailing lists by their subscribers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jmir.org/2005/3/e32/ How New Subscribers Use Cancer-Related Online Mailing Lists | Rimer | Journal of Medical Internet Research&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Support groups==

There are many cancer support groups available. The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.asco.org/|title=American Society of Clinical Oncology|work=ASCO|access-date=2018-11-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; offers cancer patients and their families doctor-approved information on the website [https://www.cancer.net cancer.net] where people can search for both general cancer and cancer-specific support groups.

The [[American Cancer Society]] has developed the Cancer Survivors Network aimed to help [[cancer survivor]]s, families and friends find and communicate with others who share their interests and experiences.&lt;ref name="C"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://csn.cancer.org/about |title=About the American Cancer Society Cancer Survivors Network |date=|accessdate=2010-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cancer Support Community is an international [[non-profit]] that offers personalized services and education to support people affected by cancer.&lt;ref name="D"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thewellnesscommunity.org/fm/About/Mission.aspx |title=Mission |date= |accessdate=2010-07-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100715071154/http://www.thewellnesscommunity.org/fm/About/Mission.aspx |archivedate=2010-07-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This initiative started operations after [[The Wellness Community]] and [[Gilda's Club]] joined together to provide psychological and social support through their network of 50 local affiliates, more than 100 satellite locations and online services.

[[Macmillan Cancer Support]] is a cancer care and support charity in the UK devoted to help improve the lives of people affected by any kind of cancer. It was founded in 1911 by Douglas Macmillan and it is now the largest of its kind in the UK. They support people living with cancer, their families and carers as well. The ways in which they help are very broad and address information needs as well as practical, emotional and financial support. On the one hand, they provide information leaflets, specialist medical care and support. Moreover, this organization fights [[discrimination]] and campaign for changes in [[policy]], [[legislation]] and practice.&lt;ref name="E"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macmillan.org.uk/Aboutus/WhatWeDo/Our_ambition.aspx |title=We are Macmillan. Cancer Support |date=|accessdate=2010-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Macmillan also funds [[nurses]] and other specialists in health and social care professionals. They have funded over 4,000 health and social care professionals across the [[UK]]. These professionals helped 432,000 people in 2008 that included not only cancer patients and their families, but also carers and friends. Macmillan works together with NHS, local authorities, Citizens Advice and other cancer charities.

The [[Susan G. Komen for the Cure]] is a non-profit organization created in 1982 to raise money for research and awareness of [[breast cancer]].&lt;ref name="F"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.survivedcancer.net/ |title=Survived Cancer |date=|accessdate=2010-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the world's largest network of breast cancer survivors and [[activists]] as well as the largest source of nonprofit funds dedicated to the fight against breast cancer in the world.&lt;ref name="G"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ww5.komen.org/AboutUs/AboutUs.html |title=About Us |date=|accessdate=2010-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[http://www.cancare.org CanCare] is a non-profit cancer support network with a mission to improve the quality of life for cancer survivors and their families. This support comes from trained volunteers who themselves have experienced and survived a cancer diagnosis or have been a caregiver to someone who has.

Nepal Cancer Support Group (NCSG) is a non government organization registered to Nepal Government was established in 2010 with an intention to promote awareness regarding cancer prevention, screening, treatment, counselling, experience sharing and advocacy by accumulating cancer survivors,their family members, health professionals, social workers, interested individuals and volunteers to form a group. This group is led by Medical Oncologist Sudeep Shrestha of Nepal.

[[Livestrong Foundation|LIVESTRONG]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=LIVESTRONG|url=http://livestrong.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a global cancer support and research organization. It originated from the Lance Armstrong Foundation (LAF), which was founded by Lance Armstrong in 1997, after he was diagnosed with advanced testicular cancer in 1996. Their motto is “Unity is strength, knowledge is power, and attitude is everything.” They are about helping people live their life with cancer and helping them fight to overcome it. They provide support and resources to all people affected by cancer. They help fund cancer research, as well as do their own research projects. 

Additionally, they have a platform to influence public policy to help everyone affected by cancer on the local, national, and global level. Globally, they are helping all countries develop and adopt a national cancer plan, and encouraging governments to support efforts to reduce cancer stigma. Nationally, they are trying to make it easier for cancer patients to have access to quality cancer care. Locally, they are trying to increase investments in cancer research and support programs.

Stand Up to Cancer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stand Up to Cancer|url=http://standup2cancer.org/}}&lt;/ref&gt; (shortened to S↑2C or SU2C) is a charity program designed to raise funds for cancer research. It was established by media, entertainment, and philanthropic leaders who were diagnosed with cancer. Their premise is to spread awareness that everyone is affected by cancer. They use the statistic “One out of two men, and one out of three women, will be diagnosed with cancer” to emphasize that cancer affects everyone, whether they are diagnosed or know someone who has been diagnosed. 

They kick started their campaign with a telethon in September 2008 that raised over $100 million. Since then, they have had many different fundraising methods, including their Mobile Giving campaign, which has raised tens of thousands of dollars, and their online project, The Constellation, where people can “launch a star” for a dollar in honor of friends, family, and loved ones in their lives who are dealing with cancer.

Bear Necessities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bear Necessities|url=http://www.bearnecessities.org/HomePage.aspx|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111115145249/http://www.bearnecessities.org/HomePage.aspx|archivedate=2011-11-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a cancer foundation created to help eliminate pediatric cancer and to provide hope and support to those affected by it. It was created by eight-year-old Barrett “Bear” Krupa and his mother. Bear was battling a [[Wilms' tumor|Wilms Tumor]] for five and half years, and during that time, he was dedicated to helping other people fight pediatric cancer, more than he was concerned with himself. This foundation was created in memory of him in order to help others beat pediatric cancer.

Jo's Cervical Cancer Trust &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Jo's Cervical Cancer Trust|url=http://www.jostrust.org.uk/}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the UK's only charity dedicated to those affected by cervical cancer and cervical abnormalities. It offers a range of online and face to face support and information including: information materials, a Helpline 0808 802 8000, online forum, local support groups and an Ask the Expert service.

[[Imerman Angels]] was created on the belief that no one should have to fight cancer alone and provides 1-on-1 cancer support by pairing those diagnosed with cancer with 'Mentor Angels' (survivors) who have survived the same kind of cancer. The service is free and helps anyone touched by any type of cancer, at any time, anywhere in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dailyherald.com/article/20130218/news/702189822/|title= New website connects donors with nonprofits through video storytelling |author=Daily Herald |date=18 February 2013 |publisher=Daily Herald|accessdate=21 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, online support communities can assist in self-management of the disease.&lt;ref name="PROM_Gill2012"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=P.S. |last1=Gill |first2=B. |last2=Whisnant|title=A qualitative assessment of an online support community for ovarian cancer patients |journal=Patient Related Outcome Measures  |volume=3 |year=2012 |pages=51–58 |url=http://www.dovepress.com/getfile.php?fileID=14137 |doi=10.2147/PROM.S36034}}&lt;/ref&gt; Effective self-management of a disease can help alleviate costs associated with health care.

==Rare Cancers==
Support for rare cancers is particularly problematic, as patients may be a long way from specialist treatment centers, and also from other patients with whom they might gain support and advice. The advent of the internet has allowed support groups for these rare cancers to emerge on a global basis, providing one to one and group oriented advice and support to patients and their families who may live on different continents, yet are able to share symptoms, experiences and advice, for example on diet or pain relief. 

Organizations such as [[European Organisation for Rare Diseases]] assist in coordinating and providing support for such organizations&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.eurordis.org/content/undiagnosed-rare-diseases|title=Undiagnosed rare diseases|website=www.eurordis.org|language=en|access-date=2018-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Examples of such support groups include [[pseudomyxomasurvivor]] who provide support for patients suffering from [[pseudomyxoma peritonei]] and have active communities particularly in the USA and Canada, Australia and New Zealand and the United Kingdom and Ireland, as well as continental Europe&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pseudomyxomasurvivor.org/pseudomyxoma-peritonei-information/|title=Information about pseudomyxoma peritonei (PMP)|work=Pseudomyxoma Survivor|access-date=2018-11-03|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The '''Charter for innovation, creativity and access to knowledge''' contains suggested legal requirements, guidelines for education and access to knowledge, and structural requirements for a knowledge-based society. The guidelines were discussed by more than a hundred representatives during the first [[Free Culture Forum]], which took place in Barcelona from October 30 to November 1, 2009.

The Charter was used as an international reference during consultation with the Department of Digital Culture (Government of Brazil). It was used to negotiate sustainable laws with the Spanish Government, and the proposals were presented to the [[European Council]] during the Spanish Presidency of the [[European Union]] in 2010. Among the Charter's endorsers there are [[Jimmy Wales]], [[Boaventura de Sousa Santos]],  [[Consumers International]], [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]], [[David Bollier]], [[Students for Free Culture]], [[European Digital Rights]], [[Participatory Culture Foundation]], [[La Quadrature du Net]], [[Transnational Institute]], Department of Digital Culture(Government of [[Brazil]]), Pirat Partie, [[Creative Commons]] España, [[La-EX]], and Networked Politics.

'''Chinese astrology''' is based on the traditional [[Chinese astronomy|astronomy]] and [[Chinese calendar|calendar]]s. The development of Chinese astrology is tied to that of [[Chinese astronomy|astronomy]], which came to flourish during the [[Han Dynasty]] (2nd century BC to 2nd century AD).

Chinese astrology has a close relation with [[Chinese philosophy]] (theory of the three harmony: heaven, earth, and water), and uses the principles of [[yin and yang]] and concepts that are not found in Western astrology, such as the [[Wu Xing]] teachings, the 10 [[Celestial stems]], the 12 [[Earthly Branches]], the [[Chinese calendar|lunisolar calendar]] (moon calendar and sun calendar), and the time calculation after year, month, day, and [[shichen]] (時辰)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://secretserendipity.com/monthly-horoscopes/astrology/ancient-chinese-astrology/ |title=Ancient Chinese Astrology – What Sign Are You?; secretserendipity.com |publisher=Secret Serendipity |accessdate=2017-11-13|date=2017-04-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

--&gt;
Chinese astrology was elaborated during the [[Zhou dynasty]] (1046–256 BC) and flourished during the [[Han Dynasty]] (2nd century BC to 2nd century AD). During the Han period, the familiar elements of traditional Chinese culture—the Yin-Yang philosophy, the theory of the 5 elements, the concepts of Heaven and Earth, and Confucian morality—were brought together to formalize the philosophical principles of Chinese medicine and divination, astrology and alchemy.&lt;ref&gt;Xiaochun Sun, Jacob Kistemaker, ''The Chinese sky during the Han:
constellating stars and society'', pp.3-4. BRILL, 1997. {{ISBN|978-90-04-10737-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 5 [[classical planet]]s are associated with the [[Wu Xing]]:
* [[Venus]]—Metal ([[White Tiger (Chinese astronomy)|White Tiger]])
* [[Jupiter]]—Wood ([[Azure Dragon]])
* [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]—Water ([[Black Tortoise]])
* [[Mars]]—Fire ([[Vermilion Bird]]) (may be associated with the phoenix which was also an imperial symbol along with the [[Dragon (zodiac)|Dragon]])
* [[Saturn]]—Earth ([[Yellow Dragon]])

According to Chinese astrology, a person's destiny can be determined by the position of the major planets at the person's birth along with the positions of the Sun, Moon, comets, the person's time of birth, and [[Chinese zodiac|zodiac Sign]]. The system of the twelve-year cycle of animal signs was built from observations of the orbit of [[Jupiter]] (the Year Star; {{zh|s=岁星|t=歳星|p=Suìxīng}}). Following the orbit of Jupiter around the sun, Chinese astronomers divided the celestial circle into 12 sections, and rounded it to 12 years (from 11.86). Jupiter is associated with the constellation ''Sheti'' ({{zh|s=摄提|t=攝提}}- [[Boötes]]) and is sometimes called Sheti.

A system of computing one's fate and destiny based on one's birthday, birth season, and birth hours, known as [[Zi wei dou shu|Zi Wei Dou Shu]] ({{zh|s=紫微斗数|t=紫微斗數|p=zǐwēidǒushù}}), or Purple Star Astrology, is still used regularly in modern-day Chinese astrology to divine one's fortune. The 28 [[Chinese constellation]]s, ''Xiu'' ({{zh|c=宿|p=xìu}}), are quite different from Western constellations. For example, the Big Bear ([[Ursa Major]]) is known as ''Dou'' ({{zh|c=斗|p=dǒu}}); the belt of [[Orion (constellation)|Orion]] is known as ''Shen'' ({{zh|s=参|t=參|p=shēn}}), or the "Happiness, Fortune, Longevity" trio of demigods. The seven northern constellations are referred to as ''Xuan Wu'' ({{zh|c=玄武|p=xuánwǔ}}). Xuan Wu is also known as the spirit of the northern sky or the spirit of Water in [[Taoism]] belief.

In addition to astrological readings of the heavenly bodies, the stars in the sky form the basis of many [[fairy tale]]s. For example, the [[Summer Triangle]] is the trio of the cowherd ([[Altair]]), the weaving maiden fairy ([[Vega]]), and the "tai bai" fairy ([[Deneb]]). The two forbidden lovers were separated by the silvery river (the [[Milky Way]]). Each year on the seventh day of the seventh month in the [[Chinese calendar]], the birds form a bridge across the Milky Way. The cowherd carries their two sons (the two stars on each side of [[Altair]]) across the bridge to reunite with their fairy mother. The tai bai fairy acts as the chaperone of these two immortal lovers.

Chinese astrology has a close relation with [[Chinese philosophy]] which the core values and concepts are originated from Taoism or "Tao".&lt;ref name=Kistemaker&gt;{{cite book | first=Sun, Xiaochun | title=The Chinese sky during the Han: constellating stars and society | year=1997 | publisher=Brill | location=Leiden | isbn=978-90-04-10737-3 | author=Kistemaker, Jacob}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|22,85,176}}

The 60-year cycle consists of two separate cycles interacting with each other. The first is the cycle of ten [[heavenly stems]], namely the [[Five elements (Chinese philosophy)|Five Elements]] (in order [[Wood (classical element)|Wood]], [[Fire (classical element)|Fire]], [[Earth (classical element)|Earth]], [[Metal (classical element)|Metal]], and [[Water (classical element)|Water]]) in their [[Yin and yang|Yin and Yang]] forms.

The second is the cycle of the twelve zodiac animal signs (生肖 ''shēngxiào'') or [[Earthly Branches]]. They are in order as follows: the [[Rat (zodiac)|Rat]], [[Ox (zodiac)|Ox]], [[Tiger (zodiac)|Tiger]], [[Rabbit (zodiac)|Rabbit]], [[Dragon (zodiac)|Dragon]], [[Snake (zodiac)|Snake]], [[Horse (zodiac)|Horse]], [[Goat (zodiac)|Goat]], [[Monkey (zodiac)|Monkey]], [[Rooster (zodiac)|Rooster]], [[Dog (zodiac)|Dog]], and [[Pig (zodiac)|Pig]]. In [[Vietnam]] the [[Rabbit (zodiac)|Rabbit]] is replaced by the cat.

This combination creates the 60-year cycle due to the fewest number of years (least common multiple) it would take to get from ''Yang Wood [[Rat (zodiac)|Rat]]'' to its next iteration, which always starts with ''Yang Wood [[Rat (zodiac)|Rat]]'' and ends with ''Yin Water [[Pig (zodiac)|Pig]]''. Since the zodiac animal cycle of 12 is divisible by two, every zodiac sign can occur only as either [[Yin and yang|Yin]] or [[Yin and yang|Yang]]: the [[Dragon (zodiac)|Dragon]] is always yang, the [[Snake (zodiac)|Snake]] is always yin, etc. The current cycle began in 1984 (as shown in "Table of the sixty-year calendar" below).

When trying to traverse the lunisolar calendar, an easy rule to follow is that years that end in an even number are yang, those that end with an odd number are yin. The cycle proceeds as follows:
*If the year ends in 0 it is Yang Metal.
*If the year ends in 1 it is Yin Metal.
*If the year ends in 2 it is Yang Water.
*If the year ends in 3 it is Yin Water.
*If the year ends in 4 it is Yang Wood.
*If the year ends in 5 it is Yin Wood.
*If the year ends in 6 it is Yang Fire.
*If the year ends in 7 it is Yin Fire.
*If the year ends in 8 it is Yang Earth.
*If the year ends in 9 it is Yin Earth.

However, since the (traditional) [[Chinese zodiac]] follows the ([[lunisolar]]) [[Chinese calendar]], the switch-over date is the [[Chinese New Year]], not January 1 as in the [[Gregorian calendar]]. Therefore, a person who was born in January or early February may have the sign of the previous year. For example, if a person was born in January 1970, his or her element would still be Yin Earth, not Yang Metal. Similarly, although 1990 was called the year of the [[Horse (zodiac)|Horse]], anyone born from January 1 to January 26, 1990, was in fact born in the Year of the [[Snake (zodiac)|Snake]] (the sign of the previous year), because the 1990 Year of the [[Horse (zodiac)|Horse]] did not begin until January 27, 1990. For this reason, many online sign calculators (and Chinese restaurant place mats) may give a person the wrong sign if he/she was born in January or early February.

The start of a new zodiac is also celebrated on [[Chinese New Year]] along with many other customs.

==Wu Xing==
{{main|Wu Xing}}
Although it is usually translated as 'element' the Chinese word ''xing'' literally means something like 'changing states of being', 'permutations' or 'metamorphoses of being'.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfram Eberhard, ''A Dictionary of Chinese Symbols'', p. 93, p. 105, p. 309, Routledge and Keegan Paul, London, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, Sinologists cannot agree on one single translation. The Chinese conception of 'element' is therefore quite different from the Western one. The Western elements were seen as the basic building blocks of matter. The Chinese 'elements', by contrast, were seen as ever changing and translation of ''xing'' is simply 'the five changes'.

'''Cornell realism''' is a view in [[meta-ethics]], associated with the work of [[Richard Boyd]], Nicholas Sturgeon, and [[David O. Brink|David Brink]] (who took his Ph.D. at [[Cornell University]]). There is no recognized and official statement of Cornell realism, but several theses are associated with the view.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Silverstein|first=Harry S.|date=1994|title=Review of Moral Realism and the Foundations of Ethics|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/2215930|journal=Noûs|volume=28|issue=1|pages=122–127|doi=10.2307/2215930}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Moral realism ==
{{main|Moral realism}}
Moral realism is the view that there are [[Philosophical realism|mind-independent]], and therefore [[Moral universalism|objective]], moral facts that moral judgments are in the business of describing. This combines a [[cognitivism (ethics)|cognitivist]] view about moral judgments (that they are belief-like mental states in the business of describing the way the world is), a view about the ''existence'' of moral facts (that they do in fact exist), and a view about the ''nature'' of moral facts (that they are objective: independent of our cognizing them or our stance towards them). This contrasts with [[expressivism|expressivist]] theories of moral judgment (''e.g.'', [[C. L. Stevenson|Stevenson]], [[R. M. Hare|Hare]], [[Simon Blackburn|Blackburn]], [[Allan Gibbard|Gibbard]]), error-theoretic/[[fictionalism|fictionalist]] denials of the existence of moral facts (''e.g.'', [[J. L. Mackie|Mackie]], [[Richard Joyce (philosopher)|Richard Joyce]], and [[Mark Kalderon|Kalderon]]), and constructivist or [[moral relativism|relativist]] theories of the nature of moral facts (''e.g.'', [[Roderick Firth|Firth]], [[John Rawls|Rawls]], [[Christine Korsgaard|Korsgaard]], [[Gilbert Harman|Harman]]).

== Motivational externalism ==
Cornell realism accepts [[motivational externalism]], which is the view that moral judgments need not have any motivational force at all. A common way of explaining the thesis invokes the claim that [[amoralists]] are possible – that there could be someone who makes moral judgments without feeling the slightest corresponding motivation. This gives Cornell realists a simple response to [[David Hume#Moral anti-realism and motivation|Humean]] arguments against cognitivism: if moral judgments do not have motivational force in the first place, there is no reason to think they are [[non-cognitivism|non-cognitive states]]. Some, like Brink, add to this motivational externalism an externalism about [[norm (social)|normative reasons]], which denies that there is any necessary connection or relation between what one has reason to do and what one is motivated to do (or would be motivated to do, if one were fully rational and knew all of the facts).

== Naturalistic non-reductionism about metaphysics ==
{{see also|Naturalism (philosophy)|Reductionism}}
Cornell realism accepts the view that moral facts are natural facts. They fall within the province of the natural and social sciences. But while they are not supernatural (as in [[divine command theory]]) and they are not non-natural (as in [[G.E. Moore|Moore]]'s ''[[Principia Ethica]]'' or Mackie's picture of a realist world), they cannot be reduced to non-moral natural facts. That is, while moral facts are natural facts and supervene on non-moral natural facts, they cannot be identified with non-moral natural facts (see, e.g., Miller's An Introduction to Contemporary Metaethics).

== Non-reductionism about semantics ==
There is no reductive connection between ''moral'' terms and concepts and ''natural'' terms and concepts. This gives Cornell realists a simple response to the charge that you cannot have naturalism without [[naturalistic fallacy]]: namely, that metaphysical reduction doesn't imply semantic reduction. This usually goes with a Kripke-Putnam semantic story: moral terms and concepts pick out certain natural properties in virtue of those properties standing in an [[Causal theory of names|appropriate causal (social-historical) relation]] to our tokenings of the terms and concepts.

'''David Tracy''' (b. January 6 1939) is an American theologian and [[Roman Catholic|Catholic]] [[Priesthood in the Catholic Church|priest]]. He is Andrew Thomas Greeley and Grace McNichols Greeley Distinguished Service Professor Emeritus of Catholic Studies at the [[University of Chicago Divinity School]].

== Early life and education ==
Tracy was born in 1939 to John Charles Tracy and Eileen Marie Tracy (née Rossell) in Yonkers, NY.  He had two brothers, John Jr. and Arthur.  His father was a union organizer who loved to read [[Henry Adams]] to his children.

Feeling an intense call to the priesthood as an adolescent, Tracy started attending the Cathedral School in 1952.  The Cathedral School served as a high school and minor seminary for the Archdiocese of New York.  In 1960, he left New York for Rome to study at the [[Pontifical Gregorian University|Gregorianum]].  His vocation to study theology was profoundly encouraged by the Second Vatican Council taking place at that time.  He was ordained in Rome on December 18, 1963, and served in the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Bridgeport|diocese]] of [[Bridgeport, CT|Bridgeport]], [[Connecticut]] in 1963.  Tracy received his [[Licentiate of Sacred Theology]] from the Pontifical Gregorian University in 1964, after which he spent one year working at a parish in Stamford, CT.  Tracy has said that he had always wanted to work in a parish, but during his one year of doing so, he felt a strong call to the academic life.  He returned to Rome and received his doctorate from the Gregorian University in 1969.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.giffordlectures.org/lecturers/david-tracy&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==
Tracy's first academic teaching appointment was a lectureship at the [[Catholic University of America]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], where he began in 1967.  In 1968, Tracy joined with [[Bernard McGinn (theologian)|Bernard McGinn]] and twenty other professors at CUA in rejecting [[Pope]] [[Paul VI]]'s encyclical [[Humanae Vitae]].  He and the others were tried by CUA's faculty senate and summarily fired.  They sued the university, were represented by [[ACLU]] lawyers, and ultimately won their case.&lt;ref&gt;Tracy, David.  "Tribute to Bernard McGinn."  Criterion 42 (Autumn, 2003): 41-42.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the midst of this trial, [[Jerald Brauer]], then Dean of the [[University of Chicago Divinity School]], convinced Tracy (as well as McGinn) to come to the University of Chicago.  In 1985, Tracy was named a Distinguished Service Professor there, and in 1987, a Distinguished Service Professor of Roman Catholic Studies.  Tracy also held the Andrew Thomas Greeley and Grace McNichols Greeley Professorship in Roman Catholic Studies, which was established in 1984 by sociologist and novelist [[Andrew Greeley]].  He also served on Chicago's [[Committee on the Analysis of Ideas and Methods]] and the [[Committee on Social Thought]].   Tracy remained at the Divinity School until his retirement in late 2006.

Tracy served as President of the [[Catholic Theological Society of America]] from 1976-1977.  In 1980, that organization awarded him the [[John Courtney Murray Award]], the highest award of the society.  In 1982, he was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

In 1999-2000, Tracy gave the [[Gifford Lectures]] at the [[University of Edinburgh]].  The title of his lectures was ''This Side of God''.  The Gifford Lectures are widely considered to be the highest honor for those working in theology and religious studies.

In 2018, Tracy contributed an essay to the catalog of the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] exhibition ''Heavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination''. Tracy was described by [[Andrew_Bolton_(curator)|Andrew Bolton]], the curator of the exhibition, as "the [[J. D. Salinger]] of the theological world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2018/05/03/fashion/heavenly-bodies-met-gala-vatican.html| title = How the Met Got the Vatican’s Vestments|author = Horowitz, Jason|date = May 3, 2018|accessdate = May 11, 2018| publisher = The New YorkTimes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Do it for Denmark''' is a [[Denmark|Danish]] media and advertising campaign designed to increase the [[birth rate]] of the nation. The campaign, launched by the Danish travel agency [[Spies Rejser]], is envisioned as a way to stop the [[population decline]] present in Denmark. Following the implementation of the campaign in 2014, the Danish birth rate increased.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2014/03/27/do-it-for-denmark-campaign-wants-danes-to-have-more-sex-a-lot-more-sex/|title=‘Do it for Denmark!’ campaign wants Danes to have more sex.

[[File:Konst1014.jpg|thumb|Family Constellations]]
'''Family Constellations''', also known as '''Systemic Constellations''' and '''Systemic Family Constellations''', is an [[alternative medicine|alternative]] therapeutic method which draws on elements of family systems therapy, [[existential phenomenology]] and [[Zulu people|Zulu]] attitudes to family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1177/1066480706287279|title="Family Constellations": An Innovative Systemic Phenomenological Group Process from Germany|year=2006|last1=Cohen|first1=D. B.|journal=The Family Journal|volume=14|issue=3|pages=226}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a single session, a Family Constellation attempts to reveal a supposedly unrecognized systemic dynamic that spans multiple generations in a given family and to resolve the deleterious effects of that dynamic by encouraging the subject to encounter representatives of the past and accept the factual reality of the past.

Family Constellations diverges significantly from conventional forms of [[Cognitive psychology|cognitive]], [[Behaviour therapy|behaviour]] and [[psychodynamic psychotherapy]]. The method has been described by physicists as [[quantum mysticism|quantum quackery]], and its founder [[Bert Hellinger]] incorporates the [[pseudoscientific]] idea of [[morphic resonance]] into his explanation of it. Positive outcomes from the therapy have been attributed to conventional explanations such as [[suggestion]] and [[empathy]].&lt;ref name=carroll&gt;{{cite web |author=Carroll, Robert T. |title=Bert Hellinger and family constellations |url=http://www.skepdic.com/hellinger.html |publisher=skepdic.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=First Person Jewish |first1=Alisa |last1=Lebow |publisher=U of Minnesota Press |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-8166-4354-7 |page=81 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SET9W5JTOUMC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Psychology Gone Wrong: The Dark Sides of Science and Therapy |edition=illustrated |first1=Tomasz |last1=Witkowski |publisher=Universal-Publishers |year=2015 |isbn=978-1-62734-528-6 |page=261 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ruaRCgAAQBAJ}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=ruaRCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA261 Extract of page 261]&lt;/ref&gt;

Practitioners claim that present-day problems and difficulties may be influenced by traumas suffered in previous generations of the family, even if those affected now are unaware of the original event in the past. Hellinger referred to the relation between present and past problems that are not caused by direct personal experience as ''Systemic entanglements,'' said to occur when unresolved trauma has afflicted a family through an event such as murder, suicide, death of a mother in childbirth, early death of a parent or sibling, war, natural disaster, emigration, or abuse.&lt;ref&gt;Hellinger, B., Weber, G., &amp; Beaumont, H. (1998). ''Love's hidden symmetry: What makes love work in relationships''. Phoenix, AZ: Zeig, Tucker and Theisen.&lt;/ref&gt; The psychiatrist [[Iván Böszörményi-Nagy]] referred to this phenomenon as ''Invisible Loyalties''.&lt;ref&gt;Boszormenyi-Nagy, I., &amp; Spark, G. M. (1973). ''Invisible loyalties: Reciprocity in intergenerational family therapy''. Hagerstown, MD: Harper &amp; Row.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conceptual basis==
The philosophical orientation of Family Constellations were derived through an integration of [[existential phenomenology]] family systems therapy and elements of indigenous spiritual mysticism.

The phenomenological lineage can be traced through philosophers [[Franz Brentano]], [[Edmund Husserl]] and [[Martin Heidegger]]. This perspective stands in contrast to the [[positivist]] [[reductionist]] orientation of the scientific psychology. Rather than understanding mind, emotion and consciousness in terms of its constituent parts, existential phenomenology opens perception to the full panorama of human experience and seeks to grasp a sense of meaning.&lt;ref name=Cohen&gt;Cohen, D. B. (2006). "Family Constellations": An innovative systemic phenomenological group process from Germany. ''The Family Journal: Counseling and Therapy for Couples and Families'', 14, 226-233.&lt;/ref&gt;

Family Constellations take their form from family systems psychology. Leading figures in this movement whose influence can be recognized include [[Jacob Moreno]], the founder of [[psychodrama]]; [[Iván Böszörményi-Nagy]], the pioneer of transgenerational systemic thinking; [[Milton Erickson]], a pioneer of brief therapy and hypnotherapy; [[Eric Berne]] who conceived the concept of ''life scripts''; and [[Virginia Satir]], who developed family sculpture, the precursor of Systemic Constellations.&lt;ref name=Cohen /&gt; In the past decade, further advancements in the use of the process have been innovated by practitioners throughout the world.

The process draws from indigenous spiritual mysticism to contribute towards releasing tensions, lightening emotional burdens, and resolving real-world problems. Hellinger lived as a [[Roman Catholic]] priest in [[South Africa]] for 16 years in the 1950s and 1960s. During these years, he became fluent in the [[Zulu people|Zulu]] language, participated in Zulu rituals, and gained an appreciation for the Zulu worldview.&lt;ref name=Cohen /&gt;

Of particular importance is the difference between traditional [[Zulu people|Zulu]] attitudes toward parents and ancestors and those typically held by Europeans. [[Heidegger]] postulated that to be human is to find oneself thrown into a world with no clear logical, ontological, or moral structure.&lt;ref&gt;Heidegger, M. (1962). ''Being and time'' (J. Macquarrie &amp; E. Robinson, translators). New York: Harper &amp; Row (original work published 1927).&lt;/ref&gt; In Zulu culture, Hellinger found a certitude and equanimity that were the hallmarks of Heidegger's elusive authentic Self. The traditional Zulu people lived and acted in a religious world in which the ancestors were the central focal point. The ancestors were regarded as positive, constructive, and creative presences.&lt;ref&gt;Lawson, E. T. (1985). ''Religions of Africa''. New York: Harper and Row.&lt;/ref&gt; The connection with ancestors is a central feature of the Constellation process.

The term "Family Constellations" was first used by [[Alfred Adler]] in a somewhat different context to refer to the phenomenon that each individual belongs to and is bonded in relationship to other members of his or her family system.

==The method==
{{refimprove section|date=July 2013}}
[[Image:Family constellation.jpg|thumb|right|320px|Family Constellations]]
This description is the prototype group Family Constellation as developed by Bert Hellinger in the 1990s.&lt;ref name=Cohen /&gt; Many practitioners have blended Constellation work with psychological aspects of healing. Others have kept the classic form as taught by Bert Hellinger, such as the Constellation Approach.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.constellationapproach.com/the-approach.html "The Constellation Approach"]&lt;/ref&gt; The Constellation Approach merges concepts of Family Constellations, energy medicine, and consciousness studies to complement the understanding of classic Constellation methodology.

* A group (workshop) is led by a facilitator. In turn, members of the group can explore an urgent personal issue. Generally, several members will be given an opportunity to set up a Constellation in each session.
* After a brief interview, the facilitator suggests who will be represented in the Constellation. These are usually a representative for the seeker, one or more family members, and sometimes abstract concepts such as "depression" or a country.
* The person presenting the issue (seeker or client) asks people from the group to stand in the Constellation as representatives. He or she arranges the representatives according to what feels right in the moment. The seeker then sits down and observes.
* Several minutes elapse with the representatives standing still and silent in their places. Initially, unlike [[psychodrama]], the representatives do not act, pose, dialogue or role play.
* Emphasis is placed on perceptive intuition in placing the representatives and in subsequent steps of the procedure. The aim is supposedly to tune into what the psychiatrist Albrecht Mahr describes as the ''Knowing Field''&lt;ref&gt;Mahr, A. (1999). "Das wissende feld: Familienaufstellung als geistig energetisches heilen" ["The knowing field: Family constellations as mental and energetic healing"]. In ''Geistiges heilen für eine neue zeit'' [''Intellectual cures for a new time'']. Heidelberg, Germany: Kösel Verlag.&lt;/ref&gt; and former biologist [[Rupert Sheldrake]] has suggested is [[morphic resonance]].&lt;ref&gt;Sheldrake, R. (1988). The presence of the past: Morphic resonance and the habits of nature. Rochester, VT: Park Street.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Knowing Field'' is claimed to guide participants to perceive and articulate feelings and sensation that mirror those of the real family members they represent; however, ''representative perception'' ([[morphic resonance]]) is not a concept with any scientific basis. The representatives have little or no factual knowledge about those they represent. Nevertheless, the representatives usually experience feelings or physical sensations that are thought to inform the process.
* The facilitator may ask each representative to briefly report how they feel being placed in relation to the others. The facilitator, seeker, and group members may believe they perceive an underlying dynamic in the spatial arrangement and feelings held by the representatives that influence the presenting personal issue. Often, configuring multiple generations in a family is thought to reveal that severe traumas continue to unconsciously affect the living long after the original victims or perpetrators have died.
* A healing resolution for the issue generally is supposedly achieved after re-positioning the representatives and adding key members of the system who have been forgotten or written out of the family history. When every representative feels right in his or her place and the other representatives agree, the facilitator may suggest one or two sentences to be spoken aloud. If the representatives do not feel at peace with their new position or sentences, they can move again or try a different sentence. This is claimed, in an abstract way, to represent a possible resolution of the issues faced by the seeker. Sometimes the process concludes without a full resolution being achieved.
*When the facilitator feels that the healing resolution has taken hold among the representatives, the seeker is invited to "replace his/her representative in the Constellation". This supposedly allows the seeker to perceive how it feels to be part of a reconfigured system. When everyone feels comfortable in their place, the Constellation concludes.

'''Franz Clemens Honoratus Hermann Brentano''' ({{IPAc-en|b|r|ɛ|n|ˈ|t|ɑː|n|oʊ}}; {{IPA-de|bʁɛnˈtaːno|lang}}; 16 January 1838 – 17 March 1917) was an influential German [[philosophy|philosopher]], [[psychology|psychologist]], and [[priest]] whose work strongly influenced not only students [[Edmund Husserl]], [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Tomáš Masaryk]], [[Rudolf Steiner]], [[Alexius Meinong]], [[Carl Stumpf]], [[Anton Marty]], [[Kazimierz Twardowski]], and [[Christian von Ehrenfels]], but many others whose work would follow and make use of his original ideas and concepts.

==Life==
Brentano was born at {{Interlanguage link multi|Marienberg am Rhein|de}}, near [[Boppard]]. He was the son of [[Christian Brentano]], the brother of [[Lujo Brentano]], and the nephew of [[Clemens Brentano]] and [[Bettina von Arnim]]. He studied [[philosophy]] at the universities of [[University of Munich|Munich]], [[University of Würzburg|Würzburg]], [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Berlin]] (with [[Friedrich Adolf Trendelenburg|Adolf Trendelenburg]]) and [[University of Münster|Münster]]. He had a special interest in [[Aristotle]] and [[scholastic philosophy]]. He wrote his dissertation in 1862 at [[University of Tübingen|Tübingen]] under the title ''Von der mannigfachen Bedeutung des Seienden nach Aristoteles'' (''On the Several Senses of Being in Aristotle''). His thesis advisor was [[Franz Jakob Clemens]].&lt;ref&gt;{{MathGenealogy|id=15176}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, he began to study [[theology]] and entered the seminary in Munich and then Würzburg. He was ordained a Catholic priest on 6 August 1864.

In 1865/66 he wrote and defended his [[habilitation thesis]], ''Die Psychologie des Aristoteles, insbesondere seine Lehre vom Nous Poietikos'' (''The Psychology of Aristotle, in Particular His Doctrine of the Active Intellect''), and began to lecture at the [[University of Würzburg]]. His students in this period included, among others, [[Carl Stumpf]] and [[Anton Marty]]. Between 1870 and 1873 Brentano was heavily involved in the debate on [[papal infallibility]]. A strong opponent of such [[dogma]], he eventually gave up his priesthood and his tenure in 1873 and in 1879 left the church altogether. He remained, however, deeply religious&lt;ref&gt;Boltzmann, Ludwig. 1995. ''Ludwig Boltzmann: His Later Life and Philosophy, 1900-1906: Book Two: The Philosopher''. Springer Science &amp; Business Media, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; and dealt with the topic of the existence of God in lectures given at the Universities of Würzburg and Vienna.&lt;ref&gt;Brentano, F. C. 1987. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=SB0fgBKZ9KcC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false On the Existence of God: Lectures Given at the Universities of Würzburg and Vienna (1868-1891)]''. Springer Science &amp; Business Media,&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1874 Brentano published his major work, ''[[Psychology from an Empirical Standpoint]]''. From 1874 to 1895 he taught at the [[University of Vienna]]; among his students were [[Edmund Husserl]], [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Tomáš Masaryk]], [[Rudolf Steiner]], [[Alexius Meinong]], [[Carl Stumpf]], [[Anton Marty]], [[Kazimierz Twardowski]], and [[Christian von Ehrenfels]] and many others (see [[School of Brentano]] for more details). While he began his career as a full ordinary professor, he was forced to give up both his Austrian citizenship and his professorship in 1880 in order to marry, but he was permitted to stay at the university only as a ''[[Privatdozent]]''.  After his retirement in 1895 (soon after the death of his wife), he moved to [[Florence]] in Italy, transferring to [[Zürich]] at the outbreak of the [[World War I|First World War]], where he died in 1917.

==Work==

===Intentionality&lt;!--'Genetic psychology (Brentano)' and 'Descriptive psychology (Brentano)' redirect here--&gt;===
{{Main|Intentionality}}
Brentano is best known for his reintroduction of the concept of [[intentionality]]—a concept derived from [[scholastic philosophy]]—to contemporary [[philosophy]] in his lectures and in his work ''Psychologie vom empirischen Standpunkt'' (''Psychology from an Empirical Standpoint''). While often simplistically summarised as "aboutness" or the relationship between mental acts and the external world, Brentano defined it as the main characteristic of ''mental phenomena'', by which they could be distinguished from ''physical phenomena''. Every mental phenomenon, every psychological act has content, is directed at an object (the ''[[intentional object]]''). Every belief, desire etc. has an object that they are about: the believed, the desired. Brentano used the expression "intentional inexistence" to indicate the status of the objects of thought in the mind. The property of being intentional, of having an intentional object, was the key feature to distinguish psychological phenomena and physical phenomena, because, as Brentano defined it, physical phenomena lacked the ability to generate ''original intentionality'', and could only facilitate an intentional relationship in a second-hand manner, which he labeled ''derived intentionality''.
 
{{cquote|Every mental phenomenon is characterized by what the Scholastics of the Middle Ages called the intentional (or mental) inexistence of an object, and what we might call, though not wholly unambiguously, reference to a content, direction towards an object (which is not to be understood here as meaning a thing), or immanent objectivity. Every mental phenomenon includes something as object within itself, although they do not all do so in the same way. In presentation something is presented, in judgement something is affirmed or denied, in love loved, in hate hated, in desire desired and so on. This intentional in-existence is characteristic exclusively of mental phenomena. No physical phenomenon exhibits anything like it. We could, therefore, define mental phenomena by saying that they are those phenomena which contain an object intentionally within themselves. &lt;small&gt;— Franz Brentano, ''Psychology from an Empirical Standpoint'', edited by Linda L. McAlister (London: Routledge, 1995 [1874]), pp. 88–89.&lt;/small&gt;}}

Brentano introduced a distinction between '''genetic psychology'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; (''genetische Psychologie'') and '''descriptive psychology'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; (''beschreibende'' or ''deskriptive Psychologie''):&lt;ref&gt;The first published occurrence of the term is in Brentano's ''Vom Ursprung sittlicher Erkenntnis (The Origin of our Knowledge of Right and Wrong)'' published in 1889 (see Franz Brentano, ''Descriptive Psychology'', Routledge, 2012, "Introduction").&lt;/ref&gt; in his terminology, genetic psychology is the study of psychological phenomena from a third-person point of view, which involves the use of empirical experiments (satisfying, thus, the scientific standards we nowadays expect of an empirical science).&lt;ref name=SEP/&gt; (This concept is roughly equivalent to what is now called [[empirical psychology]],&lt;ref name=Jacquette&gt;Dale Jacquette (ed.), ''The Cambridge Companion to Brentano'', Cambridge University Press, 2004, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; [[cognitive science]],&lt;ref name=Jacquette/&gt; or "[[heterophenomenology]]", an explicitly third-person, scientific approach to the study of consciousness.) The aim of descriptive psychology, on the other hand, is to describe consciousness from a first-person point of view.&lt;ref name=SEP/&gt; The latter approach was further developed by Husserl and the [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] tradition.&lt;ref&gt;[[Anna-Teresa Tymieniecka]], ''Phenomenology World-Wide: Foundations — Expanding Dynamics — Life-Engagements A Guide for Research and Study'', Springer, 2014, p. 18: "[Husserl] entrusts this analysis to a pure or phenomenological psychology whose links with Brentano's descriptive psychology are still clearly visible."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theory of perception===
He is also well known for claiming that ''Wahrnehmung ist Falschnehmung'' ('perception is misception') that is to say perception is erroneous. In fact he maintained that external, sensory perception could not tell us anything about the ''de facto'' existence of the perceived world, which could simply be illusion. However, we can be absolutely sure of our internal perception. When I hear a tone, I cannot be completely sure that there is a tone in the real world, but I am absolutely certain that I do hear. This awareness, of the fact that I hear, is called internal perception. External perception, sensory perception, can only yield hypotheses about the perceived world, but not truth. Hence he and many of his pupils (in particular [[Carl Stumpf]] and [[Edmund Husserl]]) thought that the natural sciences could only yield hypotheses and never universal, absolute truths as in pure [[logic]] or [[mathematics]].

However, in a reprinting of his ''Psychologie vom Empirischen Standpunkte'' (''Psychology from an Empirical Standpoint''), he recanted this previous view.  He attempted to do so without reworking the previous arguments within that work but it has been said that he was wholly unsuccessful.  The new view states that when we hear a sound, we hear something from the external world; there are no physical phenomena of internal perception.&lt;ref&gt;See Postfix in the 1923 edition (in German) or the 1973, English version ({{ISBN|0710074255}}, edited by Oskar Kraus; translated [from German] by Antos C. Rancurello, D. B. Terrell and [[Linda López McAlister]]; English edition edited by Linda López McAlister).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theory of judgment===
{{Refimprove section|date=March 2010}}
Brentano has a theory of judgment which is different from what is currently the predominant ([[Gottlob Frege|Fregean]]) view. At the centre of Brentano’s theory of judgment lies the idea that a judgment depends on having a [[Presentation (philosophy)|presentation]], but this presentation does not have to be predicated. Even stronger: Brentano thought that [[Predicate (grammar)|predication]] is not even necessary for judgment, because there are judgments without a predicational content. Another fundamental aspect of his theory is that judgments are always [[Existential clause|existential]]. This so-called existential claim implies that when someone is judging that S is P he/she is judging that some S that is P exists. (Note that Brentano denied the idea that all judgments are of the form: S is P [and all other kinds of judgment which combine presentations]. Brentano argued that there are also judgments arising from a single presentation, e.g. “the planet Mars exists” has only one presentation.) In Brentano’s own symbols, a judgment is always of the form: ‘+A’ (A exists) or ‘–A’ (A does not exist).

Combined with the third fundamental claim of Brentano, the idea that all judgments are either positive (judging that A exists) or negative (judging that A does not exist), we have a complete picture of Brentano’s theory of judgment. So, imagine that you doubt whether midgets exist. At that point you have a presentation of midgets in your mind. When you judge that midgets do not exist, then you are judging that the presentation you have does not present something that exists. You do not have to utter that in words or otherwise predicate that judgment. The whole judgment takes place in the denial (or approval) of the existence of the presentation you have.

The problem of Brentano’s theory of judgment is not the idea that all judgments are existential judgments (though it is sometimes a very complex enterprise to transform an ordinary judgment into an existential one), the real problem is that Brentano made no distinction between [[Object (philosophy)|object]] and presentation. A presentation exists as an object in your mind. So you cannot really judge that A does not exist, because if you do so you also judge that the presentation is not there (which is impossible, according to Brentano’s idea that all judgments have the object which is judged as presentation). [[Kazimierz Twardowski]] acknowledged this problem and solved it by denying that the object is equal to the presentation. This is actually only a change within Brentano’s theory of perception, but has a welcome consequence for the theory of judgment, viz. that you can have a presentation (which exists) but at the same time judge that the object does not exist.

==Legacy==
The young [[Martin Heidegger]] was very much inspired by Brentano's early work ''On the Several Senses of Being in Aristotle''.
Brentano's focus on conscious (or phenomenal) intentionality was inherited by Carl Stumpf's [[Berlin School of experimental psychology|Berlin School]] of experimental psychology, Anton Marty's [[Prague School]] of linguistics, Alexius Meinong's [[Graz School]] of experimental psychology, Kasimir Twardowski's [[Lwów–Warsaw school|Lwów School]] of philosophy, and Husserlian phenomenology.&lt;ref&gt;Uriah Kriegel, [http://philpapers.org/archive/KRIPIP.pdf "Phenomenal intentionality past and present: introductory], ''Phenomenology and the Cognitive Sciences'' '''12'''(3):437–444 (2013).&lt;/ref&gt; Brentano's work also influenced [[George Stout]],&lt;ref name=Albertazzi&gt;Liliana Albertazzi, ''Immanent Realism: An Introduction to Brentano'', Springer, 2006, p. 321.&lt;/ref&gt; the teacher of [[George Edward Moore|G. E. Moore]] and [[Bertrand Russell]] at [[Cambridge University]].&lt;ref&gt;Maria van der Schaar, ''G. F. Stout and the Psychological Origins of Analytic Philosophy'', Springer, 2013, p. viii.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gnosticism in modern times''' includes a variety of contemporary religious movements, stemming from [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]] ideas and systems from ancient [[Roman Empire|Roman]] society. Gnosticism is an ancient name for a variety of religious ideas and systems, originating in Jewish-Christian milieux in the first and second century CE.

The [[Mandaeans|Mandaens]] are an ancient Gnostic sect still active in [[Iran]] and [[Iraq]] with small communities in other parts of the world.

The late 19th century saw the publication of popular sympathetic studies making use of recently rediscovered source materials. In this period there was also the revival of a Gnostic religious movement in France. The emergence of the [[Nag Hammadi library]] in 1945 greatly increased the amount of source material available. Its translation into English and other modern languages in 1977 resulted in a wide dissemination, and as a result had observable influence on several modern figures, and upon modern Western culture in general. This article attempts to summarize those modern figures and movements that have been influenced by Gnosticism, both prior and subsequent to the Nag Hammadi discovery.

A number of ecclesiastical bodies that identify as Gnostic have set up or re-founded since World War II as well, including the [[Ecclesia Gnostica]], [[Johannite Church]], [[Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica]], the Thomasine Church, (not to be confused with the [[St. Thomas Christians]] of India) the Alexandrian Gnostic Church, and the North American College of Gnostic Bishops.&lt;ref name="Taussig2013"&gt;{{cite book|last=Taussig|first=Hal|title=A New New Testament: A Reinvented Bible for the Twenty-first Century Combining Traditional and Newly Discovered Texts|year=2013|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|isbn=9780547792101|page=532}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Late 19th century==
Source materials were discovered in the 18th century. In 1769 the [[Bruce Codex]] was brought to England from Upper Egypt by the Scottish traveller [[James Bruce]], and subsequently bequeathed to the care of the Bodleian Library, Oxford. Sometime prior to 1785 The [[Pistis Sophia|Askew Codex]] (a.k.a. ''Pistis Sophia'') was bought by the British Museum from the heirs of Dr. Askew. ''Pistis Sophia'' text and Latin translation of the Askew Codex by M. G. Schwartze were published in 1851. Although discovered in 1896 the Coptic Berlin Codex (a.k.a. the Akhmim Codex), was not 'rediscovered' until the 20th century.

===Charles William King===
[[Charles William King]] was a British writer and collector of ancient [[gemstone]]s with magical inscriptions. His collection was sold because of his failing eyesight, and was presented in 1881 to the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York]]. King was recognized as one of the greatest authorities on gems.&lt;ref&gt;1911 Encyclopædia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Gnostics and their Remains'' (1864, 1887 2nd ed.) King sets out to show that rather than being a Western heresy, the origins of Gnosticism are to be found in the East, specifically in [[Buddhism]]. This theory was embraced by Blavatsky, who argued that it was ''plausible'', but rejected by GRS Mead. According to Mead, King's work "lacks the thoroughness of the specialist."&lt;ref&gt;[[#refGoodGRS|Goodrick-Clarke (2005) p. 8-9]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Madame Blavatsky===
[[Helena Petrovna Blavatsky]], co-founder of [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|the Theosophical Society]], wrote extensively on Gnostic ideas. A compilation of her writings on Gnosticism is over 270 pages long.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refHoellGnos|Hoeller (2002) p. 167]]&lt;/ref&gt; The first edition of King's ''The Gnostics and Their Remains'' was repeatedly cited as a source and quoted in ''[[Isis Unveiled]]''.

===G. R. S. Mead===
[[G. R. S. Mead]] became a member of Blavatsky's Theosophical Society in 1884. He left the teaching profession in 1889 to become Blavatsky's private secretary, which he was until her death in 1891. Mead's interest in Gnosticism was likely awakened by Blavatsky who discussed it at length in ''Isis Unveiled''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refGoodGRS|Goodrick-Clarke (2005) p. 8]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1890–1891 Mead published a serial article on Pistis Sophia in [[Lucifer (magazine)|''Lucifer'' magazine]], the first English translation of that work. In an article in 1891, Mead argues for the recovery of the literature and thought of the West at a time when Theosophy was largely directed to the East. Saying that this recovery of Western antique traditions is a work of interpretation and "the rendering of tardy justice to pagans and heretics, the reviled and rejected pioneers of progress..."&lt;ref&gt;[[#refGoodGRS|Goodrick-Clarke (2005) pp. 56–57]]&lt;/ref&gt; This was the direction his own work was to take.

The first edition of his translation of ''Pistis Sophia'' appeared in 1896. From 1896–1898 Mead published another serial article in the same periodical, "Among the Gnostics of the First Two Centuries," that laid the foundation for his monumental compendium ''Fragments of a Faith Forgotten'' in 1900. Mead serially published translations from the ''Corpus Hermeticum'' from 1900–1905. The next year he published ''Thrice-Greatest Hermes'' a massive comprehensive three volume treatise. His series ''Echoes of the Gnosis'' was published in 12 booklets in 1908. By the time he left the Theosophical Society in 1909, he had published many influential translations, commentaries, and studies of ancient Gnostic texts. "Mead made Gnosticism accessible to the intelligent public outside of academia".&lt;ref&gt;[[#refHoellGnos|Hoeller (2002) p. 170]]&lt;/ref&gt; Mead's work has had and continues to have widespread influence.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refGoodGRS|Goodrick-Clarke (2005) pp. 31–32]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Gnostic Church revival in France===
After a series of visions and archival finds of [[Cathar]]-related documents, a librarian named Jules-Benoît Stanislas Doinel du Val-Michel (a.k.a. [[Jules Doinel]]) establishes the ''[[Eglise Gnostique]]'' (French: ''Gnostic Church''). Founded on extant Cathar documents with the Gospel of John and strong influence of Simonian and Valentinian cosmology, the church was officially established in the autumn of 1890 in Paris, France. Doinel declared it "the era of Gnosis restored." Liturgical services were based on Cathar rituals. Clergy was both male and female, having male bishops and female "sophias."&lt;ref name="Pearson, J. 2007 p. 47"&gt;[[#refPearsWiccal|Pearson, J. (2007) p. 47]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hoeller 2002 p. 176-8"&gt;[[#refHoellGnos|Hoeller (2002) p. 176-8]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Doinel resigned and converted to Roman Catholicism in 1895, one of many duped by [[Léo Taxil]]'s [[Taxil hoax|anti-masonic hoax]]. Taxil unveiled the hoax in 1897. Doinel was readmitted to the Gnostic church as a bishop in 1900.

==Early to mid-20th century==

===Carl Jung===
[[Carl Gustav Jung]] evinced a special interest in Gnosticism from at least 1912, when he wrote enthusiastically about the topic in a letter to Freud. After what he called his own 'encounter with the unconscious,' Jung sought for external evidence of this kind of experience. He found such evidence in Gnosticism, and also in [[alchemy]], which he saw as a continuation of Gnostic thought, and of which more source material was available.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refSegalJun|Segal (1995) p. 26]]&lt;/ref&gt; In his study of the Gnostics, Jung made extensive use of the work of GRS Mead. Jung visited Mead in London to thank him for the ''Pistis Sophia'', the two corresponded, and Mead visited Jung in Zürich.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refGoodGRS|Goodrick-Clarke (2005) p. 1, 30-1]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Jung saw the Gnostics not as syncretic schools of mixed theological doctrines, but as genuine visionaries, and saw their imagery not as myths but as records of inner experience.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refGoodGRS|Goodrick-Clarke (2005) p. 30]]&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote that "The explanation of Gnostic ideas 'in terms of themselves,' i.e., in terms of their historical foundations, is futile, for in that way they are reduced only to their less developed forestages but not understood in their actual significance."&lt;ref&gt;[[#refJungCW|Jung (1977) p. 652]]&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, he worked to understand and explain Gnosticism from a psychological standpoint. While providing something of an ancient mirror of his work, Jung saw "his psychology not as a contemporary ''version'' of Gnosticism, but as a contemporary ''counterpart'' to it."&lt;ref&gt;[[#refSegalJun|Segal (1995) p. 30]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Jung reported a series of experiences in the winter of 1916-17 that inspired him to write ''[[Septem Sermones ad Mortuos]]'' (Latin: Seven Sermons to the Dead).&lt;ref name="Goodrick-Clarke 2005 p. 31"&gt;[[#refGoodGRS|Goodrick-Clarke (2005) p. 31]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#refHoellJung|Hoeller (1989) p. 7]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The Jung Codex ====

Through the efforts of [[Gilles Quispel]], the ''[[Jung Codex]]'' was the first codex brought to light from the Nag Hammadi Library. It was purchased by the [[C. G. Jung Institute in Zürich|Jung Institute]] and ceremonially presented to Jung in 1953 because of his great interest in the ancient Gnostics.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refJungCW|Jung (1977) p. 671]]&lt;/ref&gt; First publication of translations of Nag Hammadi texts in 1955 with ''the Jung Codex'' by H. Puech, Gilles Quispel, and W. Van Unnik.

===French Gnostic Church split, reintegration, and continuation===
[[Jean Bricaud]] had been involved with the Eliate Church of Carmel of {{ill|Eugène Vintras|fr}}, the remnants of [[Bernard-Raymond Fabré-Palaprat|Fabré-Palaprat's]] [[Johannite Church|''Église Johannite des Chrétiens Primitifs'']] (Johannite Church of Primitive Christians), and the [[Martinism|Martinist Order]] before being consecrated a bishop of the ''[[Église Gnostique]]'' in 1901. In 1907 Bricaud established a church body that combined all of these, becoming patriarch under the name Tau Jean II. The impetus for this was to use the [[Latin liturgical rites|Western Rite]]. Briefly called the ''Église Catholique Gnostique'' (Gnostic Catholic Church), it was renamed the ''Église Gnostique Universelle'' (Universal Gnostic Church, EGU) in 1908. The close ties between the church and Martinism were formalized in 1911. Bricaud received consecration in the [[Joseph René Vilatte|Villate]] line of [[apostolic succession]] in 1919.&lt;ref name="Pearson, J. 2007 p. 47"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hoeller 2002 p. 176-8"/&gt;

The original church body founded by Doinel continued under the name ''Église Gnostique de France'' (Gnostic Church of France) until it was disbanded in favor of the EGU in 1926. The EGU continued until 1960 when it was disbanded by Robert Amberlain (Tau Jean III) in favor of the ''Église Gnostique Apostolique'' that he had founded in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refPearsWiccal|Pearson, J. (2007) p. 131]]&lt;/ref&gt; It is active in France (including [[Martinique]]), [[Ivory Coast]], and the [[Midwestern United States]].

===Modern sex magic associated with Gnosticism===
The use of the term 'gnostic' by [[sexual magic]] groups is a modern phenomenon. Hugh Urban concludes that, "despite the very common use of sexual symbolism throughout Gnostic texts, there is little evidence (apart from the accusations of the early church) that the Gnostics engaged in any actual performance of sexual rituals, and certainly not anything resembling modern sexual magic."&lt;ref&gt;[[#refUrbanMagia|Urban (2006) p. 36 note 68]]&lt;/ref&gt; Modern sexual magic began with [[Paschal Beverly Randolph]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#refUrbanMagia|Urban (2006) p. 36]]&lt;/ref&gt; The connection to Gnosticism came by way of the French Gnostic Church with its close ties to the strong esoteric current in France, being part of the same highly interconnected milieu of esoteric societies and orders from which the most influential of sexual magic orders arose, the [[Ordo Templi Orientis]] (Order of Oriental Templars, OTO).

Theodor Reuss founded the OTO as an umbrella occult organization with sexual magic at its core.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refGreerEncy|Greer (2003) p. 221-2]]&lt;/ref&gt; After Reuss came into contact with French Gnostic Church leaders at a Masonic and Spiritualist conference in 1908, he founded ''Die Gnostische Katholische Kirche'' (the Gnostic Catholic Church), under the auspices of the OTO.&lt;ref name="Pearson, J. 2007 p. 47"/&gt; Reuss subsequently dedicated the OTO to the promulgation of Crowley's philosophy of [[Thelema]]. It is for this church body, called in Latin the [[Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica]] (EGC), that [[Aleister Crowley]] wrote the ''Ecclesiæ Gnosticæ Catholicæ Canon Missæ'' ("Canon of the Mass of the Gnostic Catholic Church"),&lt;ref&gt;[[#refCrowleyEquinox|''The Equinox'' III:1 (1929) p. 247]]&lt;/ref&gt; the central ritual of the OTO that is now commonly called [[the Gnostic Mass]].

===The Gnostic Society===
{{main|Gnostic Society}}
The Gnostic Society, was founded for the study of gnosticism in 1928 and incorporated in 1939 by Theosophists [[James Morgan Pryse]] and his brother John Pryse in Los Angeles.&lt;ref name="Pearson, B. 2007 p. 240"&gt;[[#refPearsAnc|Pearson, B. (2007) p. 240]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith 1995 p. 206"&gt;[[#refSmithRevival|Smith (1995) p. 206]]&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1963 it has been under the direction of [[Stephan Hoeller]] and operates in association with the [[Ecclesia Gnostica]]. Initially begun as an archive for a [[usenet]] [[newsgroup]] in 1993, [http://www.gnosis.org the Gnosis Archive] became the first web site to offer historic and source materials on Gnosticism.

==Mid-20th century==

[[The Gospel of Thomas]], held to be the most complete of the Nag Hammadi texts, is the subject of the book ''The Mustard Seed'' by Indian mystic [[Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh]], also known as Osho.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Osho|first= |date= 1974|title= The Mustard Seed – Commentaries on the Fifth Gospel of Saint Thomas |url= https://www.osho.com/iosho/library/read-book/online-library-the-mustard-seed-f17c62b563ee?p=247a23d05558f25ee8080d0ca6639fdc|location= Switzerland|publisher= OSHO International Foundation|page= |isbn= |author-link= Rajneesh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Ecclesia Gnostica''===
Established in 1953 by Richard Duc de Palatine in England under the name 'the Pre-nicene Gnostic Catholic Church', the Ecclesia Gnostica (Latin: "Church of Gnosis" or "Gnostic Church") is said to represent 'the English Gnostic tradition', although it has ties to, and has been influenced by, the French Gnostic church tradition. It is affiliated with the Gnostic Society, an organization dedicated to the study of Gnosticism. The presiding bishop is the Rt. Rev. [[Stephan A. Hoeller]], who has written extensively on Gnosticism.&lt;ref name="Goodrick-Clarke 2005 p. 31"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pearson, B. 2007 p. 240"/&gt;

Centered in Los Angeles, the Ecclesia Gnostica has parishes and educational programs of the Gnostic Society spanning the Western US and also in the Kingdom of Norway.&lt;ref name="Pearson, B. 2007 p. 240"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith 1995 p. 206"/&gt; The lectionary and liturgical calendar of the Ecclesia Gnostica have been widely adopted by subsequent Gnostic churches, as have the liturgical services in use by the church, though in somewhat modified forms.

==== ''Ecclesia Gnostica Mysteriorum'' ====
The [http://gnosticsanctuary.org Ecclesia Gnostica Mysteriorum] (EGM), commonly known as "the Church of Gnosis" or "the Gnostic Sanctuary," was initially established in Palo Alto by bishop [[Rosamonde Miller]] as a parish of the Ecclesia Gnostica, but soon became an independent body with emphasis on the experience of gnosis and the balance of the divine masculine and feminine principles. The Gnostic Sanctuary is now located in Redwood City, California.&lt;ref name="Pearson, B. 2007 p. 240"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith 1995 p. 206"/&gt; The EGM also claims a distinct lineage of Mary Magdalene from a surviving tradition in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  | last = Keizer  | first = Lewis  | title = The Wandering Bishops: Apostles of a New Spirituality | publisher = St. Thomas Press | year = 2000  | pages = 48 | url = http://www.hometemple.org/WanBishWeb%20Complete.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Samael Aun Weor in South America===
[[Samael Aun Weor]] left the FRA after the death of Arnold Krumm Heller. He reports an experience of being called to his new mission by the venerable White Lodge (associated with Theosophy). Samael Aun Weor taught a "New Gnosis," consisting of sexual union between man and woman, without the ejaculation of the sexual liquid. He called this the ''Arcanum AZF''. For him it is "the synthesis of all religions, schools and sects."

Moving through Latin America, he finally settled in Mexico where he founded the Movimiento Gnostico Cristiano Universal (MGCU) (Universal Gnostic Christian Movement), then subsequently founded the Iglesia Gnostica Cristiana Universal (Universal Gnostic Christian Church) and the Associacion Gnostica de Estudios Antropologicos Culturales y Cientificos (AGEAC) (Gnostic Association of Scientific, Cultural and Anthropological Studies) to spread his teachings.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refDawsonNew|Dawson (2007) p. 54-60]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The MGCU became defunct by the time of Samael Aun Weor's death in December 1977. However, his disciples subsequently formed new organizations to spread his teachings, under the umbrella term 'the International Gnostic Movement'. These organizations are currently very active via the Internet and have centers established in Latin America, the US, Australia, Canada and Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refDawsonNew|Dawson (2007) p. 60-65]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hans Jonas===
The philosopher [[Hans Jonas]] wrote extensively on Gnosticism, interpreting it from an [[existentialism|existentialist]] viewpoint. For some time, his study ''[[The Gnostic Religion]]: The message of the alien God and the beginnings of Christianity'' published in 1958, was widely held to be a pivotal work, and it is as a result of his efforts that the [[Gnosticism#Major gnostic schools and their texts|Syrian-Egyptian/Persian]] division of Gnosticism came to be widely used within the field. The second edition, published in 1963, included the essay "Gnosticism, Existentialism, and Nihilism."

===Eric Voegelin's anti-modernist 'gnostic thesis'===
In the 1950s, [[Eric Voegelin]] entered into an academic debate concerning the classification of [[modernity]] following Karl Löwith's 1949 ''Meaning in History: the Theological Implications of the Philosophy of History''; and Jacob Taubes's 1947 ''Abendländishe Eschatologie''. In this context, Voegelin put forward his "gnosticism thesis": criticizing modernity by identifying an "immanentist eschatology" as the "gnostic nature" of modernity. Differing with Löwith, he did not criticize eschatology as such, but rather the immanentization which he described as a "pneumopathological" deformation. Voegelin's gnosticism thesis became popular in neo-conservative and cold war political thought.&lt;ref&gt;[[#refWeissVoeg|Weiss (2000)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gnosticism in popular culture==
Gnosticism has seen something of a resurgence in popular culture in the late 20th and early 21st centuries. This may be related, certainly, to the sudden availability of Gnostic texts to the reading public, following the emergence of the Nag Hammadi library.

* [[Philip K. Dick]] explored gnosticism in many of his later works, particularly the [[VALIS trilogy]].
* The Manga series ''[[Eden: It's an Endless World]]'' is largely based on Gnostic Mythology.{{Citation needed|reason=Beside using names from Gnostic mysticism, I do not see it anywhere close to being largely based on it|date=July 2013}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5146">'''Gregorio Bermann''' (1894&amp;ndash;1972) was an Argentine [[psychiatrist]], [[philosopher]], activist, author, and [[Humanism|humanist]]. Born in Buenos Aires to Polish Jewish immigrants, he was the youngest of ten siblings, eight of which had been Born in Poland.  He was a leader in the student movement [[Argentine University Federation]] in Cordoba during the first half of the 20th century. 

==Personal and family life==
He was married three times, first to Leonilda Barrancos, with whom he fathered two children, Sylvia and Claudio, then to soprano [[Isa Kremer]] though they were together many years they were not legally wed.  He diagnosed her Cancer prior to her death in the Fifties. He was last married to Dolores, who survived his own death in Cordoba. She mourned amongst other world leaders he had befriended, such as Salvador Allende from the neighboring Chile. He also had personal ties, through his travels that were far and wide, to President Roosevelt's wife, Eleanor, and Argentine 
revolutionary Che Guevara, about whom he was doing research in preparation for his next book, just prior to his death, following "Mental Health in China" which had been translated into several languages. He was also survived by two children, both Psychiatrists in the family tradition.  

Bermann's son, Claudio, managed his father's Clinic (see next section) until he was jailed during the "Dirty Wars" era of Military Dictatorship in Argentina. His incarceration was due to the publication of his article, which claimed that the police force was corrupt and accused them of stealing. Eventually, Claudio was able to leave the country following a request from Kissinger. It is believed that the famous political figure noticed a lot of attention was being placed on this man's whereabouts that could endanger covert activities in that area.

The Clinic was then managed by Sylvia once she returned from teaching in the University in Mexico, where she fled to shortly after her daughter, Irene Torrents, was detained, tortured, and tossed into the ocean, still alive, by the Military (Her body has never been found...). Torrents daughter was whisked out of the country with Sylvia and her surviving child, Norah to the D.F., Mexico. After the Military left office Sylvia returned to the management of the Clinic, until the Government Contract with the P.A.M.I. (The Argentine National Service to Retired Personnel) was lost due to her refusal to pay a bribe to the official in charge of handing-out contracts. Due to lack of funds, the building eventually was lost to the crediting Banks that had been generating loans.&lt;ref name=celentano&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ensayistas.org/critica/generales/C-H/argentina/bermann.htm|title=El humanismo de Gregorio Bermann|author=Adrián Celentano}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional life==
Bermann had a highly influential role in the university reform of 1918 in Argentina, which spread throughout the country and influenced the way Higher Education was taught in many other Latin countries. It even influencing the Student movements on the U.S. and France during the sixties, note the student riots in France in 1968. He continued to play an active role in university reform up into the 1930s.  He founded the "Bermann Clinic" for Mental Health in "Las Rosas" Cordoba, after getting his degree in Psychiatry.  He also studied German in order to interview Sigmund Freud in his own tongue, which he did, an entry in Freud's schedule cites the meeting with Dr. Bermann.  Gregorio also brought Freudian Psychoanalysis to Argentina, and the rest of Latin America, and was the founder of the Latin American Psychiatric Association over which he presided for a number of years.  His other passion was politics, and during the Spanish Civil War he leased a plane and took 16 colleagues with him to fight Hitler's new brand of Fascism in the form of General Franco.  He was a Medic during the War, and it was during such times that he befriended Humanists and writers such as Miguel de Unamuno, Federico Garcia Lorca, etc. He published twenty  books total, 10 on psychiatry, psychology and psychoanalysis, and also published 10 books and journal articles relating to philosophy and politics.

In politics, he was a socialist; he joined the Socialist Party of Cordoba in the 1920s and he was part of the intellectual network of the Communist Party from the 1930s onwards, participating in the anti-fascist movement and in the opposition to various right-wing governments through the years, including that of [[Juan Perón]]. However, in the 1960s he moved away from the Soviet-aligned party and towards the Cuban and to some extent Chinese versions of communism.&lt;ref name=celentano/&gt;

'''Hans Kelsen''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ɛ|l|s|ən}}; {{IPA-de|ˈhans ˈkɛlsən|lang}}; October 11, 1881 – April 19, 1973) was an Austrian [[jurist]], [[legal philosopher]] and [[political philosopher]]. He is author of the 1920 [[Austrian Constitution]], which to a very large degree is still valid today. Due to the rise of totalitarianism in Austria (and a 1929 constitutional change),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://derstandard.at/2000069877935/Kelsen-der-Kampf-um-die-Sever-Ehen-und-die-Folgen|title=Kelsen, der Kampf um die "Sever-Ehen"|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kelsen left for Germany in 1930 but was forced to leave this university post after Hitler's seizure of power in 1933 because of his Jewish ancestry. That year he left for Geneva and later moved to the United States in 1940. In 1934, [[Roscoe Pound]] lauded Kelsen as "undoubtedly the leading jurist of the time." While in Vienna, Kelsen met [[Sigmund Freud]] and his circle, and wrote on the subject of social psychology and sociology.

By the 1940s, Kelsen's reputation was already well established in the United States for his defense of democracy and for his [[Pure Theory of Law]]. Kelsen's academic stature exceeded legal theory alone and extended to [[political philosophy]] and social theory as well. His influence encompassed the fields of philosophy, legal science, sociology, the theory of democracy, and [[international relations]].

Late in his career while at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], although officially retired in 1952, Kelsen rewrote his short book of 1934, ''Reine Rechtslehre'' (''Pure Theory of Law''), into a much enlarged "second edition" published in 1960 (it appeared in an English translation in 1967). Kelsen throughout his active career was also a significant contributor to the theory of judicial review, the hierarchical and dynamic theory of positive law, and the science of law. In political philosophy he was a defender of the state-law identity theory and an advocate of explicit contrast of the themes of centralization and decentralization in the theory of government. Kelsen was also an advocate of the position of separation of the concepts of state and society in their relation to the study of the science of law.

The reception and criticism of Kelsen's work and contributions has been extensive with both ardent supporters and detractors. Kelsen's contributions to legal theory of the Nuremberg trials was supported and contested by various authors including Dinstein at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem. Kelsen's [[Neo-Kantianism|neo-Kantian]] defense of continental [[legal positivism]] was supported by [[H. L. A. Hart]] in its contrasting form of Anglo-American legal positivism, which was debated in its Anglo-American form by scholars such as [[Ronald Dworkin]] and [[Jeremy Waldron]].

==Biography==
Kelsen was born in [[Prague]] into a middle-class, German-speaking, [[Jewish]] family. His father, Adolf Kelsen, was from [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]], and his mother, Auguste Löwy, was from [[Bohemia]]. Hans was their first child;  there would be two younger brothers and a sister.  The family moved to [[Vienna]] in 1884, when Hans was three years old.  After graduating from the [[Akademisches Gymnasium]], Kelsen studied [[law]] at the [[University of Vienna]], taking his doctorate in law ([[Dr. juris]]) on 18 May 1906 and his [[habilitation]] on 9 March 1911. Twice in his life, Kelsen converted to separate religious denominations. At the time of his dissertation on Dante and Catholicism, Kelsen was baptised as a Roman Catholic on 10 June 1905. On 25 May 1912 he married Margarete Bondi (1890–1973), the two having converted a few days earlier to Lutheranism of the [[Augsburg Confession]]; they would have two daughters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Rudolf Aladár |last=Métall |title=Hans Kelsen: Leben und Werke |location=Vienna |publisher=Deuticke |year=1969 |pages=1–17}}; but preferring Kelsen's autobiographical fragments (1927 and 1947), as well as the editorial additions, in Hans Kelsen, ''Werke'' Bd 1 (2007).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kelsen and his years in Austria up to 1930===
Kelsey's doctoral thesis on Dante's theory of the state in 1905 became his first book on political theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Hans |last=Kelsen |title=Die Staatslehre des Dante Alighieri |location=Vienna |publisher=Deuticke |year=1905}}.  Neither this thesis nor his habilitation thesis appears to have had a formal supervisor—{{cite journal|journal=Hans Kelsen Werke|title=Autobiographie|volume=1|pages=29–91}}{{rp|36–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this book Kelsen made explicit his preference for the reading of [[Dante Alighieri]]'s ''[[Divine Comedy]]'' as largely based in political allegory. The study makes a rigorous examination of the "two swords doctrine" of [[Pope Gelasius I]], along with Dante's distinct sentiments in the Roman Catholic debates between the [[Guelphs and Ghibellines]], and Kelsen's conversion to Catholicism was contemporaneous to the book's completion in 1905.  In 1908 Kelsen won a research scholarship which allowed him to attend the [[University of Heidelberg]] for three consecutive semesters, where he studied with the distinguished jurist [[Georg Jellinek]] before returning to Vienna.

The closing chapter of Kelsen's study of political allegory in Dante also was important for emphasizing the particular historical path which led directly to the development of modern law in the twentieth century. After emphasizing Dante's importance to this development of legal theory, Kelsen then indicated the historical importance of [[Niccolò Machiavelli]] and [[Jean Bodin]] to these historical transitions in legal theory leading to modern twentieth century law.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Kelsen, ''Dante'', concluding chapter.&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of Machiavelli, Kelsen saw an important counter-example of an exaggerated executive part of government operating without effective legal restraints on responsible conduct. For Kelsen, this would be instrumental in the orientation of his own legal thinking in the direction of strong rule of law government, with a heightened emphasis on the central importance of a fully elaborated power of judicial review.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Kelsen's time at Heidelberg was of lasting importance to him in that he began to solidify his position of the identity of law and state from the initial steps he observed as being taken by Jellinek. Kelsen's historical reality was to be surrounded by the dualistic theories of law and state prevailing in his time. The major question for Jellinek and Kelsen, as stated by Baume&lt;ref name="Baume_47"&gt;{{harvp|Baume|2011|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; is, "How can the independence of the state in a dualist perspective be reconciled with its status (as) representative of the legal order? For dualistic theorists there remains an alternative to monistic doctrines: the theory of the self-limitation of the state. Georg Jellinek is an eminent representative of this theory, which allows one to avoid reducing the state to a legal entity, and also to explain the positive relationship between law and state. The self-limitation of the sphere of the state presupposes that the state, as a sovereign power, by the limits that it imposes on itself, becomes a rule-of-law state."&lt;ref name="Baume_47"/&gt; For Kelsen, this was appropriate for as far as it went yet it still remained a dualistic doctrine and therefore Kelsen rejected it stating: "The problem of the so-called auto-obligation of the State is one of those pseudo-problems that result from the erroneous dualism of State and law. This dualism is, in turn, due to a fallacy of which we meet numerous examples in the history of all fields of human thought. Our desire for the intuitive representation of abstractions leads us to personify the unity of a system, and then to hypostasize the personification. What originally was only a way of representing the unity of a system of objects becomes a new object, existing in its own right."&lt;ref&gt;Kelsen, Hans. ''General Theory of Law and State'', p. 198.&lt;/ref&gt; Kelsen was joined in this critique by the distinguished French jurist [[Léon Duguit]], who wrote in 1911: "Self-limitation theory (vis Jellinek) contains some real sleight of hand. Voluntary subordination is not subordination. The state is not really limited by the law if the state alone can introduce and write this law, and if it can at any time make any changes that it wants to make in it. This kind of foundation of public law is clearly extremely fragile."&lt;ref&gt;Duguit, Leon (1911). ''Traité de droit constitutionnel'', vol. 1, ''La règle du droit: le problème de l'État'', Paris: de Boccard,  p. 645.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, Kelsen solidified his position endorsing the doctrine of the identity of law and state.&lt;ref&gt;Kelsen, p. 198.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1911, he achieved his [[habilitation]] (license to give university lectures) in [[public law]] and [[legal philosophy]], with a thesis that became his first major work on legal theory, ''Hauptprobleme der Staatsrechtslehre entwickelt aus der Lehre vom Rechtssatze'' ("Main Problems in Theory of Public Law, Developed from Theory of the Legal Statement").&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Hans |last=Kelsen |title=Hauptprobleme der Staatsrechtslehre entwickelt aus der Lehre vom Rechtssatze |location=Tübingen |publisher=Mohr |date=1911 |edition=1923 2nd}};  reprinted, Aalen, Scientia, 1984, {{ISBN|3-511-00055-6}} (an index was issued separately by the Hans Kelsen-Institut in 1988). Also published as Kelsen, ''Werke'', vol. II.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1919, he became full [[professor]] of public and [[administrative law]] at the University of Vienna, where he established and edited the ''Zeitschrift für öffentliches Recht'' (Journal of Public Law). At the behest of Chancellor [[Karl Renner]], Kelsen worked on drafting a new [[Constitution of Austria|Austrian Constitution]], enacted in 1920. The document still forms the basis of Austrian constitutional law. Kelsen was appointed to the Constitutional Court, for his lifetime. Kelsen's emphasis during these years upon a Continental form of legal positivism began to further flourish from the standpoint of his law-state monism, somewhat based upon the previous examples of Continental legal positivism found in such scholars of law-state dualism such as Paul Laband (1838–1918) and Carl Friedrich von Gerber (1823–1891).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Baume|2011|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the early 1920s he published six major works in the areas of government, [[public law]], and [[international law]]: in 1920, ''Das Problem der Souveränität und die Theorie des Völkerrechts'' (The Problem of Sovereignty and Theory of International Law)&lt;ref&gt;
{{Citation |first=Hans |last=Kelsen |title= Das Problem der Souveränität und die Theorie des Völkerrechts |location=Tübingen |publisher=Mohr |year=1920}}.  It is subtitled ''Beitrag zu einer reinen Rechtslehre'' (Essay toward a Pure Theory of Law).&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Vom Wesen und Wert der Demokratie'' (On the Essence and Value of Democracy);&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Hans |last=Kelsen |title=Vom Wesen und Wert der Demokratie |location=Tübingen |publisher=Mohr |year=1920}}.  Second, revised and enlarged edition 1929;  reprinted, Aalen, Scientia, 1981, {{ISBN|3-511-00058-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1922, ''Der soziologische und der juristische Staatsbegriff'' (The Sociological and Juristic Concepts of the State);&lt;ref&gt;
{{Citation |first=Hans |last=Kelsen |title= Der soziologische und der juristische Staatsbegriff |location=Tübingen |publisher=Mohr |year=1920}};  reprinted, Aalen, Scientia, 1981, {{ISBN|3-511-00057-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; in 1923, ''Österreichisches Staatsrecht'' (Austrian Public Law);&lt;ref&gt;
{{Citation |first=Hans |last=Kelsen |title= Österreichisches Staatsrecht |location=Tübingen |publisher=Mohr |year=1923}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, in 1925, ''Allgemeine Staatslehre'' (General Theory of the State),&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Hans |last=Kelsen |title= Allgemeine Staatslehre |location=Berlin |publisher=Springer |year=1925}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;These works remain untranslated, except that key parts of ''Das Problem der Souveränität und die Theorie des Völkerrechts'' appear in Petra Gümplová, ''Sovereignty and Constitutional Democracy'' (Nomos Publishers, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; together with ''Das Problem des Parlamentarismus'' (The Problem of Parliamentarianism). In the late 1920s, these were followed by ''Die philosophischen Grundlagen der Naturrechtslehre und des Rechtspositivismus'' (The Philosophical Foundations of the Doctrine of Natural Law and Legal Positivism).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Hans |last=Kelsen |title= Die philosophischen Grundlagen der Naturrechtslehre und des Rechtspositivismus |location=Charlottenburg |publisher=Pan-Verlag Rolf Heise |year=1928}};  translated as "Natural Law Doctrine and Legal Positivism" in {{Citation |first=Hans |last=Kelsen |title= General Theory of Law and State |location=Cambridge, Mass. |publisher=Harvard U.P. |year=1945 |pages=389–446}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Portrait de Dante.jpg|thumb|upright|Kelsen's 1905 dissertation was about political allegory in Dante Alighieri (oil by Botticelli).]]
During the 1920s, Kelsen continued to promote his celebrated theory of the identity of law and state which made his efforts a counterpoint to the position of [[Carl Schmitt]] who advocated for the priority of the political concerns of the state. Kelsen was supported in his position by Adolf Merkl and Alfred Verdross, while opposition to his view was voiced by Erich Kaufman, Hermann Heller, and Rudolf Smend.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Baume|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; An important part of Kelsen's main practical legacy is as the inventor of the modern European model of [[constitutional review]]. This was first introduced in both Austria and Czechoslovakia in 1920,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.usoud.cz/clanek/Czechoslovak_Court_1920&lt;/ref&gt; and then latter in the [[Federal Republic of Germany]], [[Italy]], [[Spain]], [[Portugal]], and later many countries of Central and Eastern Europe.

As described above, the Kelsenian court model set up a separate constitutional court which was to have sole responsibility over constitutional disputes within the judicial system. Kelsen was the primary author of its statutes in the state constitution of Austria as he documents in his 1923 book cited above. This is different from the system usual in [[common-law]] countries, including the USA, in which courts of general jurisdiction from the trial level up to the court of last resort frequently have powers of constitutional review. Following increasing political controversy about some positions of the Constitutional Court of Austria, Kelsen faced increasing pressure from the administration which appointed him to specifically address issues and cases concerning the providence of divorce provisions in state family law. Kelsen was inclined to a liberal interpretation of the divorce provision while the administration which had originally appointed him was responding to public pressure for the predominantly Catholic country to take a more conservative position on the issue of the curtailment of divorce. In this increasingly conservative climate, Kelsen, who was considered sympathetic to the [[Social Democratic Party of Austria|Social Democrats]], although not a party member, was removed from the court in 1930.

===Kelsen and his European years between 1930 and 1940===
In her recent book on Kelsen, Sandrine Baume&lt;ref name="Baume, p 37"&gt;{{harvp|Baume|2011|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; has summarized the confrontation between Kelsen and Schmitt at the very start of the 1930s. This debate was to reignite Kelsen's strong defense of the principle of judicial review against the principle of an authoritarian version of the executive branch of government which Schmitt had envisioned for national socialism in Germany. Kelsen wrote his scathing reply to Schmitt in his 1931 essay, "Who Should Be the Guardian of the Constitution?", in which he defended in plain terms the importance of judicial review over and against the excessive form of executive authoritarian government which Schmitt was promulgating in the early 1930s. As Baume states, "Kelsen defended the legitimacy of the constitutional court by combating the reasons that Schmitt cites for assigning the role of the guardian of the Constitution to the President of the Reich. The dispute between these two lawyers was about which body of the state should be assigned the role of guardian of the German Constitution. Kelsen thought that this mission ought to be conferred on the judiciary, especially the Constitutional Court."&lt;ref name="Baume, p 37"/&gt; Although Kelsen was successful in drafting sections for the Constitution in Austria for a strong court of judicial review,&lt;ref&gt;Le Divellec, 'Les premices de la justice...,' p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt; his sympathizers in Germany were less successful. Both [[Heinrich Triepel]] in 1924 and [[Gerhard Anschütz]] in 1926 were unsuccessful in their explicit drive to instill a strong version of judicial review in Germany's Weimar Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;J.-C. Beguin, ''Le contrôle de la constitutionnalité des lois en République fédérale d'Allemagne'', Paris: Economica, 1982, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kelsen accepted a professorship at the [[University of Cologne]] in 1930. When the National Socialists came to power in [[Germany]] in 1933, he was removed from his post.  He relocated to [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]] where he taught international law at the [[Graduate Institute of International Studies]] from 1934 to 1940. During this time period, [[Hans Morgenthau]] departed from Germany to complete his habilitation dissertation in Geneva, which resulted in his book ''The Reality of Norms and In Particular the Norms of International Law: Foundations of a Theory of Norms''.&lt;ref&gt;Morgenthau, Hans, ''La réalité des normes en particulier des normes du droit international: fondements d'une théorie des normes'', (Paris: Alcan, 1934), still untranslated into English.&lt;/ref&gt; By remarkable good fortune for Morgenthau, Kelsen had just arrived in Geneva as a professor and he became an adviser for Morgenthau's dissertation. Kelsen was among the strongest critics of [[Carl Schmitt]] because Schmitt was advocating for the priority of the political concerns of the state over the adherence by the state to the [[rule of law]]. Kelsen and Morgenthau were united against this National Socialist school of political interpretation which down-played the rule of law, and they became lifelong colleagues even after both had emigrated from Europe to take their respective academic positions in the United States. During these years, Kelsen and Morgenthau had both become ''persona non grata'' in Germany during the full rise to power of National Socialism.

That Kelsen was the principal defender of Morgenthau's ''Habilitationschrift'' is recently documented in the translation of Morgenthau's book titled ''The Concept of the Political''.&lt;ref&gt;Morgenthau, Hans (2011). ''The Concept of the Political'', pp 16-17.&lt;/ref&gt; In the introductory essay to the volume, Behr and Rosch indicate that the Geneva faculty under the examiners Walther Burckhardt and [[Paul Guggenheim]] were initially quite negative concerning Morgenthau's ''Habilitationschrift''. When Morgenthau had found a Paris publisher for the volume, he asked Kelsen to re-evaluate it. In the words of Behr and Rosch, "Kelsen was the right choice to assess Morgenthau's thesis because not only was he a senior scholar in ''Staatslehre'', but Morgenthau's thesis was also largely a critical examination of Kelsen's legal positivism. Thus, it was Kelsen to whom Morgenthau 'owed his ''Habilitation'' in Geneva,' as Kelsen's biographer Rudolf Aladár Métall&lt;ref&gt;Métall, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frei (2001), pp. 48-49.&lt;/ref&gt; confirms, ''and'' also eventually his subsequent academic career, because Kelsen produced the positive evaluation that convinced the board of examiners to award Morgenthau his ''Habilitation''."&lt;ref&gt;Morgenthau, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1934, at the age of 52, he published the first edition of ''Reine Rechtslehre'' (''[[Pure Theory of Law]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Translated by B.L. Paulson and S.L. Paulson as ''Introduction to the Problems of Legal Theory'' (Oxford, Clarendon P., 1992);  the German subtitle is used as the English title, to distinguish this book from the second edition of ''Reine Rechtslehre'', translated by Max Knight as ''Pure Theory of Law'' (Berkeley, U. California P., 1967).&lt;/ref&gt;  While in Geneva he became more deeply interested in [[international law]]. This interest in international law in Kelsen was in reaction largely to the [[Kellogg–Briand Pact]] in 1929 and his negative reaction to the vast idealism he saw represented in its pages, along with the lack of the recognition of sanctions for the illicit actions of belligerent states. Kelsen had come to endorse strongly the sanction-delict theory of law which he saw as substantially under-represented in the Kellogg–Briand Pact. In 1936–1938 he was briefly professor at the [[Karl-Ferdinands-Universität|German University in Prague]] before returning to Geneva where he remained until 1940. His interest in international law would become especially focused in Kelsen's writings on international war crimes which he would redouble his efforts on behalf of after his departure to the United States.

===Hans Kelsen and his American years after 1940===
In 1940, at the age of 58, he and his family fled Europe on the last voyage of the [[SS Washington]], embarking on 1 June in [[Lisbon]]. He moved to the [[United States]], giving the prestigious ''Oliver Wendell Holmes Lectures'' at [[Harvard Law School]] in 1942. He was supported by Roscoe Pound for a faculty position at Harvard but opposed by Lon Fuller on the Harvard faculty before becoming a full professor at the department of [[political science]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 1945. Kelsen was defending a position of the distinction of the philosophical definition of justice as it is separable from the application of positive law. As Fuller stated his opposition, "I share the opinion of Jerome Hall, evidenced in this excellent ''Readings'', that jurisprudence should start with justice. I place this preference not on exhortatory grounds, but on a belief that until one has wrestled with the problem of justice one cannot truly understand the other issues of jurisprudence. Kelsen, for example, excludes justice from his studies (of practical law) because it is an 'irrational ideal' and therefore 'not subject to cognition.' The whole structure of his theory derives from that exclusion. The meaning of his theory can therefore be understood only when we have subjected to critical scrutiny its keystone of negation."&lt;ref&gt;Fuller, Lon. "The place and uses of jurisprudence in the law school curriculum,' ''Journal of Legal Education'', 1948-1949, 1, p. 496.&lt;/ref&gt; Lon Fuller felt that the natural law position he was advocating against Kelsen was incompatible with Kelsen's dedication to the responsible use of positive law and the science of law. During the ensuing years, Kelsen increasingly dealt with issues of [[international law]] and international institutions such as the [[United Nations]]. In 1953-54, he was [[Charles H. Stockton Professor of International Law|visiting Professor of International Law]] at the [[United States Naval War College]].

Another part of Kelsen's practical legacy, as he has recorded,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Hans |last=Kelsen |title=Peace through Law |location=Chapel Hill |publisher=U. North Carolina P. |year=1944 |pages=88–110}}.&lt;/ref&gt; was the influence that his writings from the 1930s and early 1940s had upon the extensive and unprecedented prosecution of political leaders and military leaders at the end of WWII at Nuremberg and Tokyo, producing convictions in more than one thousand war crimes cases. For Kelsen, the trials were the culmination of approximately fifteen years of research he had devoted to this topic, which started still in his European years, and which he followed with his celebrated essay, "Will the Judgment In the Nuremberg Trial Constitute a Precedent In International Law?," published in ''The International Law Quarterly'' in 1947. It was preceded in 1943 by Kelsen's essay, 'Collective and Individual Responsibility in International Law with Particular Regard to Punishment of War Criminals', 31 ''California Law Review'', p 530, and in 1944 by his essay, "The Rule Against Ex Post Facto and the Prosecution of the Axis War Criminals," which appeared in ''The Judge Advocate Journal'', Issue 8.

In Kelsen's companion 1948 essay for ''J.Y.B.I.L.'' to his 1943 "[...]War Criminals" essay cited in the above paragraph titled, "Collective and Individual Responsibility for Acts of State in International Law,"&lt;ref&gt;Kelsen, Hans (1948). ''J.Y.B.I.L.'', "Collective and Individual Responsibility for Acts of State in International Law."&lt;/ref&gt; Kelsen presented his thoughts on the distinction between the doctrine of ''[[respondeat superior]]'' and the acts of State doctrine when used as a defense during the prosecution of war crimes. On page 228 of the essay Kelsen states that, "Acts of State are acts of individuals performed by them in their capacity as organs of the State, especially by that organ which is called the Government ''of'' the State. These acts are performed by individuals who belong to the Government as the [[head of State]], or members of the cabinet, or are ''acts performed at its command or with the authorization of the Government''." Yoram Dinstein of Hebrew University in Jerusalem has taken exception to Kelsen's formulation in his book ''The Defense of 'Obedience to Superior Orders' in International Law'', reprinted in 2012 by Oxford University Press, dealing with Kelsen's specific attribution of acts of State.&lt;ref&gt;Dinstein, Yoram (2012). ''The Defense of 'Obedience to Superior Orders' in International Law'', reprinted in 2012. Originally published in Hebrew in 1965 by Manges Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after the initiation of the drafting of the UN Charter on 25 April 1945 in San Francisco, Kelsen began the writing of his extended 700-page treatise on the United Nations as a newly appointed professor at the University of California at Berkeley (''The Law of the United Nations'', New York 1950). In 1952, he also published his book-length study about international law entitled ''Principles of International Law'' in English, and reprinted in 1966. In 1955, Kelsen turned to a 100-page essay, "Foundations of Democracy," for the leading philosophy journal ''Ethics'';  written during the height of Cold War tensions, it expressed a passionate commitment to the Western model of democracy over soviet and national-socialist forms of government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Kelsen | first = Hans | title = Foundations of Democracy | journal = Ethics | volume = 66(1/2) | pages = 1–101 | year = 1955 |jstor=2378551  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This 1955 essay by Kelsen on democracy was also important for summarizing his critical stance towards the 1954 book on politics by his former student in Europe [[Eric Voegelin]]. Following this, in Kelsen's book entitled ''A New Science of Politics'' (Ontos Verlag, reprinted in 2005, 140pp, originally published 1956), Kelsen enumerated a point by point criticism of the excessive idealism and ideology which he saw as prevailing in Voegelin's book on politics. This exchange and debate has been documented in the appendix to the book, written by the author on  Voegelin, Barry Cooper, entitled ''Voegelin and the Foundations of Modern Political Science'' from 1999. Kelsen's other book defending his realist position regarding the issue of the separation of state and religion as opposed to that of Voegelin's position on this issue was published posthumously under the title ''Secular Religion.'' Kelsen's objective in part was to safeguard the importance of the responsible separation of state and religion for those sympathetic to religion and concerned with this separation. Kelsen's 1956 book was followed in 1957 by a collection of essays on justice, law and politics, most of them previously published in English.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first=Hans |last=Kelsen |title=What is Justice?  Justice, Law, and Politics in the Mirror of Science |location=Berkeley |publisher=U. California P. |year=1957}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It had originally been published in the German language in 1953.

==''Pure Theory of Law''==
{{main|Pure Theory of Law}}
Kelsen is considered one of the preeminent jurists of the 20th century and has been highly influential among scholars of [[jurisprudence]] and [[public law]], especially in Europe and Latin America although less so in common-law countries. His book titled ''Pure Theory of Law'' ({{lang-de|Reine Rechtslehre}}) was published in two editions, one in Europe in 1934, and a second expanded edition after he had joined the faculty at the University of California at Berkeley in 1960.

Kelsen's ''Pure Theory of Law'' is widely acknowledged as his magnum opus. It aims to describe law as a hierarchy of norms which are also binding norms while at the same time refusing, itself, to evaluate those norms. That is, 'legal science' is to be separated from 'legal politics'.  Central to the ''Pure Theory of Law'' is the notion of a 'basic norm (''[[Grundnorm]]'')'{{mdash}}a hypothetical norm, presupposed by the theory, from which in a hierarchy all 'lower' norms in a [[legal system]], beginning with [[constitutional law]], are understood to derive their authority or 'bindingness'. In this way, Kelsen contends, the bindingness of legal norms, their specifically 'legal' character, can be understood without tracing it ultimately to some suprahuman source such as God, personified Nature or a personified State or Nation.&lt;ref name="serving"&gt;{{cite book | title = Serving the Word: Literalism in America from the Pulpit to the Bench | author = Crapanzano, Vincent | publisher = The New Press | year = 2000 | place = New York | pages = 271–275 | ISBN = 1-56584-673-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Pure Theory of Law'' is generally considered among the most original contributions made by Hans Kelsen to legal theory. His book with that title was first published in 1934, and in a greatly expanded second edition (effectively a ''magnum opus'' doubled in length of presentation) in 1960. The second edition appeared in English translation in 1967, as ''Pure Theory of Law'';&lt;ref&gt;The title page gives the title correctly as ''Pure Theory of Law'', but the paperback cover has ''The&lt;!--[sic]--&gt; Pure Theory of Law''.&lt;/ref&gt; the first edition appeared in English translation in 1992, as ''Introduction to the Problems of Legal Theory''. The theory proposed in this book has probably been the most influential theory of law produced during the 20th century&lt;!-- Citation Needed --&gt;. It is, at the least, one of the high points of modernist legal theory.&lt;ref&gt;Both editions will be included in forthcoming volumes in the [http://www.mohr.de/en/law/text-editions/buch/hans-kelsen-werke.html/ Hans Kelsen Werke] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029185519/http://www.mohr.de/en/law/text-editions/buch/hans-kelsen-werke.html/ |date=2013-10-29 }}. A fuller and more accurate translation of the second edition is also planned. The current translation, in omitting many footnotes, obscures the extent to which the ''Pure Theory of Law'' is both philosophically grounded and responsive to earlier theories of law.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the original terminology which was introduced in the first edition was already present in many of Kelsen's writings from the 1920s, and was also subject to discussion in the critical press of that decade. Although the second edition is so much longer, the two editions have a great deal of similar content.

==Kelsen's widespread contributions to legal theory==
Kelsen's theory both drew from and has been developed by scholars in his homelands, notably the Vienna School in [[Austria]] and the Brno School led by František Weyr in [[Czechoslovakia]]. It is stated that in the English-speaking world, and notably the "Oxford school" of jurisprudence", Kelsen's influence can be seen in [[H. L. A. Hart]], [[Julie Dickson]], [[John Gardner (lawyer)|John Gardner]], [[Leslie Green (philosopher)|Leslie Green]], [[Jim Harris (writer)|Jim Harris]], [[Tony Honoré]], [[Joseph Raz]] and [[Richard Tur]], and "in the backhanded compliment of strenuous criticism, also in the work of [[John Finnis]]".&lt;ref name="Revisited"&gt;{{cite book|title=Kelsen Revisited: New Essays on the Pure Theory of Law|editor=Luis Duarte d'Almeida, John Gardner and Leslie Green|publisher=Hart Publishing|date=2013|pages=1|chapter=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the principal writers in English on Kelsen are [[Robert S. Summers]], [[Neil MacCormick]] and Stanley L. Paulson. Among Kelsen's principal critics today is Joseph Raz of Columbia University who has excoriated the reading of Nuremberg and the war crimes trials which Kelsen had interpreted in a consistent manner throughout the 1930s and 1940s at the end of his essay for ''Am. J. Juris.,'' p 94, (1974) titled "Kelsen's Theory of the Basic Norm."
[[Image:John Marshall by Henry Inman, 1832.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Hans Kelsen established the principles of judicial review in the Constitutions of Austria and Czechoslovakia following the example of John Marshall in the American Constitutional experience.]]

Some mystery surrounds the belated publication, in 2012, of ''Secular Religion''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Secular Religion:  a Polemic against the Misinterpretation of Modern Social Philosophy, Science, and Politics as "New Religions" | author = Kelsen, Hans | publisher = Springer | year = 2012 | place = Vienna and New York | ISBN = 978-3-7091-0765-2}}  Edited by members of the Hans Kelsen Institute&lt;/ref&gt; The text was begun in the 1950s, as an attack on work by his former pupil [[Eric Voegelin]].  In the early 1960s an expanded version was set up in proof but was withdrawn at Kelsen's insistence (and considerable personal expense in reimbursing the publisher), for reasons that have never become clear.  However, the Hans Kelsen Institute eventually decided that it should be published.  It is a vigorous defense of modern science against all, including Voegelin, who would overturn the accomplishments of the Enlightenment by demanding that science be guided by religion.  Kelsen seeks to expose contradictions in their claim that modern science, after all, rests upon the same sorts of assumption as religion{{mdash}}that it constitutes forms of "new religion" and so should not complain when old religion is brought back in.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Stewart | first = Iain | title = Kelsen, the Enlightenment and Modern Premodernists | journal = Australian Journal of Legal Philosophy | volume = 37 | pages = 251–278 | year = 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Four major areas of Kelsen's contributions to legal theory over his lifetime included the following areas of (i) judicial review, (ii) hierarchical law, (iii) the de-ideologicalization of positive law to strongly disassociate all reference to natural law, and (iv) the clear delineation of the science of law and legal science in twentieth century modern law.

===Judicial review===
Judicial review for Kelsen in the twentieth century was part of a tradition inherited from the common law tradition based upon the American constitutional experience as introduced by John Marshall.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfe, Christopher. ''The Rise of Modern Judicial Review: From Judicial Interpretation to Judge-Made Law'', Rowman and Littlefield.&lt;/ref&gt; By the time the principle had reached Europe and specifically Kelsen, the issue of the codification of Marshall's common law version of judicial review into its form of constitutionally legislated law became an explicit theme for Kelsen. In drafting the constitutions for both Austria and Czechoslovakia, Kelsen chose to carefully delineate and limit the domain of judicial review to a narrower focus than was originally accommodated by John Marshall. Kelsen did receive a lifetime appointment to the court of judicial review in Austria and would remain on this court for almost an entire decade during the 1920s.

===Hierarchical law===
Hierarchical law as a model for understanding the structural description of the process of understanding and applying the law was central for Kelsen and he adopted the model directly from his colleague Adolf Merkl at the University of Vienna. The main purposes of the hierarchical description of the law would be three-fold for Kelsen. First, it was essential to understanding his celebrated static theory of law as elaborated in Chapter four of his book on the ''Pure Theory of Law'' (see subsection above).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kelsen|1960|loc=Chapter 4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its second edition, this chapter on the static theory of the law was almost one hundred pages in length and represented a comprehensive study of law capable of standing as an independent subject for research for legal scholars in this area of specialization. Second, it was a measure of relative centralization or decentralization. Third, a fully centralized system of law would also correspond to a unique Grundnorm or Basic norm which would not be inferior to any other norm in the hierarchy due to its placement at the utmost foundation of the hierarchy (see Grundnorm section below).

===The de-ideologicalization of positive law===
Kelsen, during the time period of his education and legal training in fin-de-siecle Europe, had inherited a highly ambiguous definition of natural law which could be presented as having metaphysical, theological, philosophical, political, religious, or ideological components depending on any one of numerous sources who might desire to utilize the term. For Kelsen, this ambiguity in the definition of natural made it unusable in any practical sense for a modern approach to understanding the science of law. Kelsen explicitly defined positive law to deal with the many ambiguities he associated with the use of natural law in his time, along with the negative influence which it had upon the reception of what was meant even by positive law in contexts apparently removed from the domain of influence normally associated with natural law.

===Science of law===
The redefinition of the science of law and legal science to meet the requirements of modern law in the twentieth century was of significant concern to Kelsen. Kelsen would write book-length studies detailing the many distinctions to be made between the natural sciences and their associated methodology of causal reasoning in contrast to methodology of [[normative]] reasoning which he saw as more directly suited to the legal sciences.&lt;ref&gt;Kelsen, Hans. ''Society and Nature''. The Lawbook Exchange, Ltd.; Reprint edition (November 2, 2009), 399 pages, {{ISBN|1584779861}}&lt;/ref&gt; The science of law and legal science were key methodological distinctions which were of high importance to Kelsen in the development of the pure theory of law and the general project of removing ambiguous ideological elements from having undue influence on the development of modern twentieth century law. In his last years, Kelsen turned to a comprehensive presentation of his ideas on norms.  The unfinished manuscript was published posthumously as ''Allgemeine Theorie der Normen'' (General Theory of Norms).&lt;ref&gt;Kelsen, Hans. ''General Theory of Norms'', Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political philosophy==
During the last 29 years of his life at the University of California, Kelsen's appointment at the University and his affiliation was primarily with the Department of Politics and not with the School of Law. This is strongly reflected in his many writings in the field of political philosophy both before and after joining the Faculty at Berkeley. In fact, Kelsen's very first book (see Section above) was written about the [[political philosophy]] of Dante Alighieri and it was only with his second book that Kelsen started to write book length studies about the philosophy of law and its practical applications. Baume speaks of Kelsen's political philosophy concerning judicial review as coming closest to Ronald Dworkin and John Hart Ely among the scholars active after the end of Kelsen's life.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Baume|2011|pp=2–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to gain a useful understanding of the breadth of Kelsen's interests in political philosophy, it is informative to examine Charles Covell's book titled ''The Redefinition of Conservatism'' from the 1980s in which Covell engages Kelsen in the philosophical context of Ludwig Wittgenstein, Roger Scruton, Michael Oakeshott, John Casey and Maurice Cowling.&lt;ref&gt;Covell, Charles (1985). ''The Redefinition of Conservatism: Politics and Doctrine.'' N.Y.: St. Martin's Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Kelsen's own political preferences were generally aimed towards more liberal forms of expression, Covell's perspective of modern liberal conservatism in his book provides an effective foil for bringing to light Kelsen's own points of emphasis within his own orientations in political philosophy. As Covell summarizes them, Kelsen's interests in political philosophy ranged across the fields of "practical perspectives underlying morality, religion, culture, and social custom."&lt;ref&gt;Covell, Charles (1985). ''The Redefinition of Conservatism: Politics and Doctrine.'' N.Y.: St. Martin's Press, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;

As summarized by Sandrine Baume in her recent book&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Baume|2011|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; on Kelsen, "In 1927 [Kelsen] recognized his debt to Kantianism on this methodological point that determined much of his pure theory of law: 'Purity of method, indispensable to legal science, did not seem to me to be guaranteed by any philosopher as sharply as by Kant with his contrast between Is and Ought. Thus for me, Kantian philosophy was from the very outset the light that guided me.'"&lt;ref&gt;Kelsen, Hans (1927). ''Selbstdarstellung'' in Jestaedt (ed.), ''Hans Kelsen im Selbstzeugnis'', pp. 21-29, especially p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Kelsen's high praise of Kant in the absence of any specific neo-Kantians is matched among more recent scholars by John Rawls of Harvard University.&lt;ref&gt;Rawls, John (2000). ''Lectures on the History of Moral Philosophy''. Cambridge, Massachusetts, Harvard University Press, 2000. This collection of lectures was edited by Barbara Herman. It has an introduction on modern moral philosophy from 1600–1800 and then lectures on Hume, Leibniz, Kant, and Hegel.&lt;/ref&gt; Both Kelsen and Rawls also have made strong endorsements of Kant's books on ''[[Perpetual Peace: A Philosophical Sketch|Perpetual Peace]]'' (1795) and ''Idea for a Universal History'' (1784). In his book titled ''What is Justice?'', Kelsen indicated his position concerning social justice stating, "[S]uppose that it is possible to prove that the economic situation of a people can be improved so essentially by so-called planned economy that social security is guaranteed to everybody in an equal measure; but that such an organization is possible only if all individual freedom is abolished. The answer to the question whether planned economy is preferable to free economy depends on our decision between the values of individual freedom and social security. Hence, to the question of whether individual freedom is a higher value than social security or vice versa, only a subjective answer is possible,"&lt;ref&gt;Kelsen, Hans. ''What is Justice?'', pp 5-6.&lt;/ref&gt; Five principle areas of concern for Kelsen in the area of political philosophy can be identified among his many interests for their centrality and the effect which they exerted over virtually his entire lifetime. These are; (i) Sovereignty, (ii) Law-state identity theory, (iii) State-society dualism, (iv) Centralization-decentralization, and (v) Dynamic theory of law.

===Sovereignty===
The definition and redefinition of sovereignty for Kelsen in the context of twentieth century modern law became a central theme for the political philosophy of Hans Kelsen from 1920 to the end of his life.&lt;ref&gt;Kelsen, Hans (1920). ''Das problem der souveränität und die theorie des völkerrechts'' (Jan 1, 1920).&lt;/ref&gt; The sovereignty of the state defines the domain of jurisdiction for the laws which govern the state and its associated society. The principles of explicitly defined sovereignty would become of increasing importance to Kelsen as the domain of his concerns extended more comprehensively into international law and its manifold implications following the conclusion of WWI. The very regulation of international law in the presence of asserted sovereign borders would present either a major barrier for Kelsen in the application of principles in international law, or represent areas where the mitigation of sovereignty could greatly facilitate the progress and effectiveness of international law in geopolitics.

===Law–state identity theory===
The understanding of Kelsen's highly functional reading of the identity of law and state continues to represent one of the most challenging barriers to students and researchers of law approaching Kelsen's writings for the first time. After Kelsen completed his doctoral dissertation on the political philosophy of Dante, he turned to the study of Jellinek's dualist theory of law and state in Heidelberg in the years leading to 1910.&lt;ref&gt;Hans Kelsen Werke 2Bd Hardcover – December 1, 2008, Matthias Jestaedt (Editor). Volume 2 of the Kelsen ''Werke'' published his book on Administrative Law following immediately his encounter with Jellinek and his debate with Jellinek's dualism.&lt;/ref&gt; Kelsen found that although he had a high respect for Jellinek as a leading scholar of his day, that Jellinek endorsement of a dualist theory of law and state was an impediment to the further development of a legal science which would be supportive of the development of responsible law throughout the twentieth century in addressing the requirements of the new century for the regulation of its society and of its culture. Kelsen's highly functional reading of the state was the most compatible manner he could locate for allowing for the development of positive law in a manner compatible with the demands of twentieth century geopolitics.

===State–society distinctions and delineations===
After accepting the need for endorsing an explicit reading of the identity of law and state, Kelsen remained equally sensitive to recognizing the need for society to nonetheless express tolerance and even encourage the discussion and debate of philosophy, sociology, theology, metaphysics, sociology, politics, and religion. Culture and society were to be regulated by the state according to legislative and constitutional norms. Kelsen recognized the province of society in an extensive sense which would allow for the discussion of religion, natural law, metaphysics, the arts, etc., for the development of culture in its many and varied attributes. Very significantly, Kelsen would come to the strong inclination in his writings that the discussion of justice, as one example, was appropriate to the domain of society and culture, though its dissemination within the law was highly narrow and dubious.&lt;ref&gt;Kelsen, Hans. ''What is Justice?''&lt;/ref&gt; A twentieth century version of modern law, for Kelsen, would need to very carefully and appropriately delineate the responsible discussion of philosophical justice if the science of law was to be allowed to progress in an effective manner responding to the geopolitical and domestic needs of the new century.

===Centralization and decentralization===
A common theme which was unavoidable for Kelsen within the many applications he encountered of his political philosophy was that of centralization and decentralization. For Kelsen, centralization was a philosophically key position to the understanding of the pure theory of law. The pure theory of law is in many ways dependent upon the logical regress of its hierarchy of superior and inferior norms reaching a centralized point of origination in the hierarchy which he termed the [[Basic norm]], or, [[Grundnorm]]. In Kelsen's general assessments, centralization was to often be associated with more modern and highly developed forms of enhancements and improvements to sociological and cultural norms, while the presence of decentralization was a measure of more primitive and less sophisticated observations concerning sociological and cultural norms.

===Dynamic theory of law===
The dynamic theory of law is singled out in this subsection discussing the political philosophy of Hans Kelsen for the very same reasons which Kelsen applied in separating its explication from the discussion of the static theory of law within the pages of ''Pure Theory of Law''. The dynamic theory of law is the explicit and very acutely defined mechanism of state by which the process of legislation allows for new law to be created, and already established laws to be revised, as a result of political debate in the sociological and cultural domains of activity. Kelsen devotes one of his longest chapters in the revised version of ''Pure Theory of Law'' to discussing the central importance he associated with the dynamic theory of law. Its length of nearly one hundred pages is suggestive of its  central significance to the book as a whole and may almost be studied as an independent book in its own right complementing the other themes which Kelsen covers in this book.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kelsen|1960|loc=Chapter 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception and criticism==
This section delineates the reception and criticism of Kelsen's writings and research throughout his lifetime. It also explicates the reaction of his scholarly reception after his death in 1973 concerning his intellectual legacy. Throughout his lifetime, Kelsen maintained a highly authoritative position representing his wide range of contributions to the theory and practice of law. Few scholars in the study of law were able to match his ability to engage and often polarize legal opinion during his own lifetime and extending well into his legacy reception after his death. One significant example of this involves his introduction and development of the term ''Grundnorm'' which can be briefly summarized to illustrate the diverse responses which his opinion was able to often stimulate in the legal community of his time. The short version of its reception is illustrative of many similar debates with which Kelsen was involved at many points in his career and may be summarized as follows.
[[Image:Joseph Raz - 20090224.jpg|thumb|upright|Kelsen's defense of the Nuremberg war crime trials received explicit criticism by Joseph Raz in recent years.]]

===The ''Grundnorm''===
Regarding Kelsen's original use of the term [[Grundnorm]], its closest antecedent appears in writings of his colleague Adolf Merkl at the University of Vienna. Merkl was developing a structural research approach for the understanding of law as a matter of the hierarchical relationship of norms, largely on the basis of their being either superior, the one to the other, or inferior with respect to each other. Kelsen adapted and assimilated much of Merkl's approach into his own presentation of the ''Pure Theory of Law'' in both its original version (1934) and its revised version (1960). For Kelsen, the importance of the [[Grundnorm]] was in large measure two-fold since it importantly indicated the logical regress of superior relationships between norms as they led to the norm which ultimately would have no other norm to which it was inferior. Its second feature was that it represented the importance which Kelsen associated with the concept of a fully centralized legal order in contrast to the existence of decentralized forms of government and representing legal orders.

Another form of the reception of the term originated from the fairly extended attempt to read Kelsen as a Neo-Kantian following his early engagement with [[Hermann Cohen]]'s work in 1911,&lt;ref&gt;Mónica García-Salmones Rovira, ''The Project of Positivism in International Law'', Oxford University Press, 2013, p. 258 n. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; the year his ''[[Habilitation]]'' dissertation on [[public law]] was published. Cohen was a leading Neo-Kantian of the time and Kelsen was, in his own way, receptive to many of the ideas which Cohen had expressed in his published book review of Kelsen's writing. Kelsen had insisted that he had never used this material in the actual writing of his own book, though Cohen's ideas were attractive to him in their own right. This has resulted in one of the longest-running debates within the general Kelsen community as to whether Kelsen became a Neo-Kantian himself after the encounter with Cohen's work, or if he managed to keep his own non-Neo-Kantian position intact which he claimed was the prevailing circumstance when he first wrote his book in 1911.

The Neo-Kantians, when pressing the issue, would lead Kelsen into discussions concerning whether the existence of such a [[Grundnorm]] (Basic Norm) was strictly symbolic or whether it had a concrete foundation. This has led to the further division within this debate concerning the currency of the term [[Grundnorm]] as to whether it should be read, on the one hand, as part and parcel of [[Hans Vaihinger]]'s "as-if" hypothetical construction. On the other hand, to those seeking a practical reading, the [[Grundnorm]] corresponded to something directly and concretely comparable to a sovereign nation's federal constitution, under which would be organized all of its regional and local laws, and no law would be recognized as being superior to it.&lt;ref&gt;Kelsen, Hans.  ''Das Problem der Souveränität und die Theorie des Völkerrechts.  Beitrag zu einer reinen Rechtslehre'' (The Problem of Sovereignty and Theory of International Law:  Contribution to a Pure Theory of Law). Tübingen, Mohr, 1920.&lt;/ref&gt;

In different contexts, Kelsen would indicate his preferences in different ways, with some Neo-Kantians asserting that late in life Kelsen would largely abide by the symbolic reading of the term when used in the Neo-Kantian context,&lt;ref&gt;''Die Rolle des Neukantianismus in der Reinen Rechtslehre: eine Debatte zwischen Sander und Kelsen'' by Hans Kelsen, Fritz Sander (1988).&lt;/ref&gt; and as he has documented. The Neo-Kantian reading of Kelsen can further be subdivided into three subgroups, with each representing their own preferred reading of the meaning of the [[Grundnorm]], which were identifiable as (a) the Marburg Neo-Kantians, (b) the Baden Neo-Kantians, and (c) his own Kelsenian reading of the Neo-Kantian school (during his "analytico-linguistic" phase circa 1911–1915)&lt;ref&gt;Stanley L. Paulson, "Four Phases in Hans Kelsen's Legal Theory? Reflections on a Periodization", ''Oxford Journal of Legal Studies'', '''18'''(1) (Spring, 1998), pp. 153–166, esp. 154.&lt;/ref&gt; with which his writings on this subject are often associated.

===Reception during Kelsen's European years===
This section covers Kelsen's years in Austria,&lt;ref&gt;''Die Wiener rechtstheoretische Schule.'' Schriften von Hans Kelsen, Adolf Merkl, Alfred Verdross.&lt;/ref&gt; Germany, Czechoslovakia and Switzerland. While still in Austria, Kelsen entered the debate on the versions of Public Law prevailing in his time by engaging the predominating opinions of [[Jellinek]] and Gerber in his 1911 Habilitation dissertation (see description above). Kelsen, after attending Jellinek's lectures in Heidelberg oriented his interpretation according to the need to extend Jellinek's research past the points which Jellinek had set as its limits. For Kelsen, the effective operation of a legal order required that it be separated from political influences in terms which exceeded substantially the terms which Jellinek had adopted as its preferred form. In response to his 1911 dissertation, Kelsen was challenged by the Neo-Kantians, originally led by [[Hermann Cohen]], who maintained that there were substantial Neo-Kantian insights which were open to Kelsen, which Kelsen himself did not appear to develop to the full extent of their potential interpretation as summarized in the section above. Sara Lagi in her recent book on Kelsen and his 1920s writings on democracy has articulated the revised and guarded reception of Jellinek by Kelsen.&lt;ref&gt;Lagi, Sara (2007). ''The Political Thought of Hans Kelsen (1911-1920)''. Original in Italian, with Spanish translation separately published.&lt;/ref&gt; Kelsen was the principal author of the passages for the incorporation of judicial review in the Constitutions of Austria and Czechoslovakia during the 1910s largely on the model of John Marshall and the American Constitutional experience.
[[File:Georg Jellinek.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Georg Jellinek agreed with Kelsen on minority rights but never read Kelsen's theory of the identity of law and state.]]
In addition to this debate, Kelsen had initiated a separate discussion with Carl Schmitt on questions relating to the definition of sovereignty and its interpretation in international law. Kelsen became deeply committed to the principle of the adherence of the state to the rule of law above political controversy, while Schmitt adhered to the divergent view of the state deferring to political fiat. The debate would have the effect of polarizing opinion not only throughout the 1920s and 1930s leading up to WWII, but has also extended into the decades after Kelsen's death in 1973.

A third example of the controversies with which Kelsen was involved during his European years surrounded the severe disenchantment which many felt concerning the political and legal outcomes of WWI and the Treaty of Versailles. Kelsen believed that the blamelessness associated with Germany's political leaders and military leaders indicated a gross historical inadequacy of international law which could no longer be ignored. Kelsen devoted much of his writings from the 1930s and leading into the 1940s towards reversing this historical inadequacy which was deeply debated until ultimately Kelsen succeeded in contributing to the international precedent of establishing war crime trials for political leaders and military leaders at the end of WWII at Nuremberg and Tokyo.

===Critical reception during his American years===
This section covers Kelsen's years during his American years. Kelsen's participation and his part in the establishment of war crimes tribunals following WWII has been discussed in the previous section. The end of WWII and the start of the [[United Nations]] became a significant concern for Kelsen after 1940. For Kelsen, in principle, the United Nations represented in potential a significant phase change from the previous [[League of Nations]] and its numerous inadequacies which he had documented in his previous writings. Kelsen would write his 700-page treatise on the United Nations,&lt;ref&gt;Kelsen, Hans. ''The Law of the United Nations.'' First published under the auspices of The London Institute of World Affairs in 1950.&lt;/ref&gt; along with a subsequent two hundred page supplement,&lt;ref&gt;Kelsen, Hans. Supplement, ''Recent Trends in the Law of the United Nations'' [1951].&lt;/ref&gt; which became a standard text book on studying the United Nations for over a decade in the 1950s and 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;Kelsen, Hans. ''A critical, detailed, highly technical legal analysis of the United Nations charter and organization.'' Original conjoint publication: New York: Frederick A. Praeger, [1964].&lt;/ref&gt;

Kelsen also became a significant contributor to the Cold War debate in publishing books on Bolshevism and Communism, which he reasoned were less successful forms of government when compared to Democracy. This, for Kelsen, was especially the case when dealing with the question of the compatibility of different forms of government in relation to the ''Pure Theory of Law'' (1934, first edition).

The completion of Kelsen's second edition of his magnum opus on ''Pure Theory of Law'' published in 1960 had at least as large an effect upon the international legal community as did the first edition published in 1934. Kelsen was a tireless defender of the application legal science in defending his position and was constantly confronting detractors who were unconvinced that the domain of legal science was sufficient to its own subject matter. This debate has continued well into the twenty-first century as well.

Two critics of Kelsen in the United States were the legal realist Karl Llewellyn&lt;ref&gt;Llewellyn, Karl (1962). ''Jurisprudence''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press, p. 356, n. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; and the jurist Harold Laski.&lt;ref&gt;Laski, Harold (1938). ''A Grammar of Politics''. London: Allen and Unwin, p. vi.&lt;/ref&gt; Llewellyn, as a firm anti-positivist against Kelsen stated, "I see Kelsen's work as utterly sterile, save in by-products that derive from his taking his shrewd eyes, for a moment, off what he thinks of as 'pure law.'"&lt;ref&gt;Llewellyn, p. 356&lt;/ref&gt; In his democracy essay of 1955, Kelsen took up the defense of representative democracy made by [[Joseph Schumpeter]] in Schumpeter's book on democracy and capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;Schumpeter, Joseph (1942). ''[[Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Although Schumpeter took a position unexpectedly favorable to socialism, Kelsen felt that a rehabilitation of the reading of Schumpeter's book more amicable to democracy could be defended and he quoted Schumpter's strong conviction that, to "realize the relative validity of one's convictions and yet stand for them unflinchingly," as consistent with his own defense of democracy.&lt;ref&gt;Kelsen, Hans (1955). ''Foundations of Democracy''.&lt;/ref&gt; Kelsen himself made mixed statements concerning the extensiveness of the greater or lesser strict association of democracy and capitalism.&lt;ref&gt;Kelsen, Hans (1937). "The function of the pure theory of law." In A. Reppy (ed.) ''Law: A Century of Progress 1835-1935, 3 vols., NY: New York University Press and London: OUP, 1937, p.94.&lt;/ref&gt;


===Critical reception of Kelsen's legacy after 1973===
Many of the controversies and critical debates during his lifetime continued after Kelsen's death in 1973. Kelsen's ability to polarize opinion among established legal scholars continued to influence the reception of his writings well after his death. The formation of the European Union would recall many of his debates with Schmitt on the issue of the degree of centralization which would in principle be possible, and what the implications concerning state sovereignty would be once the unification was put into place. Kelsen's contrast with Hart as representing two distinguishable forms of legal positivism has continued to be influential in distinguishing between Anglo-American forms of legal positivism from Continental forms of legal positivism. The implications of these contrasting forms continues to be part of the continuing debates within legal studies and the application of legal research at both the domestic and the international level of investigation.&lt;ref&gt;Essays in Honor of Hans Kelsen, Celebrating the 90th Anniversary of His Birth by Albert A.; Et al. Ehrenzweig (1971).&lt;/ref&gt;

In her recent book on Hans Kelsen, Sandrine Baume&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Baume|2011|pp=53–54}}&lt;/ref&gt; identified Ronald Dworkin as a leading defender of the "compatibility of judicial review with the very principles of democracy." Baume identified John Hart Ely alongside Dworkin as the foremost defenders of this principle in recent years, while the opposition to this principle of "compatibility" was identified as Bruce Ackerman and Jeremy Waldron.&lt;ref&gt;Waldron, Jeremy (2006). "The Core of the case against judicial review," ''The Yale Law Review'', 2006, Vol. 115, pp 1346-1406.&lt;/ref&gt; Dworkin has been a long-time advocate of the principle of the moral reading of the Constitution whose lines of support he sees as strongly associated with enhanced versions of judicial review in the federal government. In Sandrine Baume's words, the opposing view to compatibility is that of "Jeremy Waldron and Bruce Ackerman,&lt;ref&gt;Ackerman, Bruce (1991). ''We the People'', Cambridge (MA) and London: Harvard University Press, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt; who look on judicial review as inconsistent with respecting democratic principles."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Baume|2011|p=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hans Kelsen Institute and Hans Kelsen Research Center==
For the occasion of Hans Kelsen's 90th birthday, the Austrian federal government decided on 14 September 1971 to establish a foundation bearing the name "Hans Kelsen-Institut". The Institut became operational in 1972. Its task is to document the ''Pure Theory of Law'' and its dissemination in Austria and abroad, and to inform about and encourage the continuation and development of the pure theory. To this end it produces, through the publishing house Manz, a book series that currently runs to more than 30 volumes. The Institut administers the rights to Kelsen's works and has edited several works from his unpublished papers, including ''General Theory of Norms'' (1979, translated 1991)&lt;ref&gt;Kelsen, Hans (1979). ''General Theory of Norms''.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Secular Religion'' (2012, written in English).&lt;ref&gt;Kelsen, Hans (2012). ''Secular Religion''.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Institut's database is free online with login registration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.univie.ac.at/staatsrecht-kelsen/datenbank.php Hans Kelsen-Institut Datenbank {{Ger}}].  Retrieved 18 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;  The founding directors of the Institut, Kurt Ringhofer and Robert Walter, held their posts until their deaths respectively in 1993 and 2010. The current directors are Clemens Jabloner (since 1993)&lt;ref&gt;Jabloner, Clemens, "Hans Kelsen and his Circle:  the Viennese Years" (1998) 9 ''European Journal of International Law'' 368.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jabloner, Clemens (2009). ''Logischer Empirismus und Reine Rechtslehre: Beziehungen zwischen dem Wiener Kreis und der Hans Kelsen-Schule'', (Veröffentlichungen des Instituts Wiener Kreis) (German Edition) Paperback by Clemens Jabloner (Editor), Friedrich Stadler (Editor).&lt;/ref&gt; and Thomas Olechowski (since 2011).&lt;ref&gt;Olechowski, Thomas; Robert Walter; Werner Ogris (2009).

In 2006, the Hans-Kelsen-Forschungsstelle (Hans Kelsen Research Center) was founded under the direction of Matthias Jestaedt at the [[University of Erlangen-Nuremberg|Friedrich-Alexander University of Erlangen-Nuremberg]]. After Jestaedt's appointment at the [[University of Freiburg|Albert-Ludwigs-University of Freiburg]] in 2011, the center was transferred there. The Hans-Kelsen-Forschungsstelle publishes, in cooperation with the Hans Kelsen-Institut and through the publishing house Mohr Siebeck, a historical-critical edition of Kelsen's works which is planned to reach more than 30 volumes; as of July 2013, the first five volumes have been published.

'''Heinrich Racker''' (1910, [[Congress Poland|Poland]] – 28 January 1961, [[Buenos Aires]]) was a [[Polish Argentine]] [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalyst]] of Austrian-Jewish origin.&lt;ref&gt;R. Horacio Etchegoyen, 'Heinrich Racker (1910-1961)', ''International Dictionary of Psychoanalysis''. [http://www.answers.com/topic/racker-heinrich Reprinted online] at [[answers.com]].&lt;/ref&gt; Escaping [[Nazism]], he fled to [[Buenos Aires]] in 1939. Already a doctor in [[musicology]] and [[philosophy]], he became a psychoanalyst, first under the direction of [[Jeanne Lampi-de-Groot]], and later working with [[Ángel Garma]] and [[Marie Langer]] in Argentina. His most important work is a study of the psychoanalytic technique known as [[transference]] and [[countertransference]], which was published for the first time in 1968.

His brother, [[Efraim Racker]], was a famous biochemist.

{{Japanese name|Imakita}}
{{nihongo|'''Imakita Kōsen'''|今北 洪川||3 August 1816 - 16 January 1892}} was a Japanese [[Rinzai]] Zen [[rōshi]] and [[Neo-Confucianism|Neo-Confucianist]].

Kosen did his Zen training under [[Daisetsu Shoen]] (1797–1855) at [[Sōkoku-ji]] and received [[Dharma transmission|inka]] from [[Gisan Zenkai]] at Sōgen-ji in Okayama. Kosen was instrumental in bringing Zen to lay practitioners and to the west. Kosen's [[Dharma heir]] [[Soyen Shaku]]&lt;ref name="Victoria, 37;237"&gt;Victoria, 37;237&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dumoulin, 407"&gt;Dumoulin, 407&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sawada, 214"&gt;Sawada, 214&lt;/ref&gt; participated in the [[World Parliament of Religions]] in Chicago, which introduced Soyen Shaku's student [[D.T. Suzuki]] to [[Paul Carus]] and western [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]]. Kosen's dharma descendant Tetsuo Sōkatsu established [[Ningen Zen Kyodan]], an independent lay-Rinzai school.&lt;ref name=ningen-home&gt;[http://www.ningen-zen.com/ningen-zen/home.shtml Ningen Zen Home] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130316112314/http://www.ningen-zen.com/ningen-zen/home.shtml |date=2013-03-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As one-time head abbot of [[Engakuji]] in [[Kamakura, Japan]], he was known as a government loyalist and is remembered for his support of [[Emperor Meiji]]—in the 1870s serving as Doctrinal Instructor for the Ministry of Doctrine.&lt;ref name="Victoria, 37;237"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dumoulin, 407"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sawada, 214"/&gt;

An '''inconsistent triad''' consists of three [[proposition]]s of which at most two can be true. For example:

# Alice loves me.
# If Alice loves me, then she would have sent flowers.
# Alice has not sent flowers.

If one finds oneself believing all three propositions of an inconsistent triad, then (in order to be rational) one must give up or modify at least one of those beliefs. Maybe Alice doesn't love me, or maybe she wouldn't send flowers to me if she did, or maybe she actually has sent flowers.

Any inconsistent triad {{math|{A, B, C}}} gives rise to a [[trilemma]] {{math|{{A, B}, {B, C}, {C, A}}}}.

== The problem of evil ==
{{Main article|Problem of evil}}

The problem of evil is often given in the form of an inconsistent triad. For example, [[J. L. Mackie]] gave the following three propositions:

# God is omnipotent
# God is omnibenevolent
# Evil exists

Mackie argued that these propositions were inconsistent, and thus, that at least one of these propositions must be false. Either:
* God is omnipotent and omnibenevolent, and evil does not exist.
* God is omnipotent, but not omnibenevolent; thus, evil exists by God's will.
* God is omnibenevolent, but not omnipotent; thus, evil exists, but it is not within God's power to stop it (at least not instantaneously).

[[Problem of evil#Answers and theodicies|Many responses]] have been made to the problem of evil, including the proposition that evil exists as a consequence of a greater good, such as free will; that evil is an illusion; and that evil is necessary for spiritual growth.

'''João Cruz Costa''' (São Paulo, SP, 1904 - São Paulo, SP, 1978), was a Brazilian philosopher,  "first student"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=de Oliveira|first=Francini Venâncio|date=|title=A trajetória de João Cruz Costa e a formação da filosofia uspiana: algumas considerações sobre o campo intelectual brasileiro nas décadas de 1940 e 1950|url=http://www.revistas.usp.br/plural/article/viewFile/74595/78199|journal=PLURAL, Revista do Programa de Pós-Graduação em Sociologia da USP|volume=16|pages=65–74|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the Philosophy Faculty at Universidade de São Paulo, later becoming full professor at the same institution.

His intellectual work addressed different knowledge areas, especially about the development of philosophy in Brazil, "aiming to establish connections between thinking and the country's social, political and economic reality throughout its history. Essay writer, critic, sociologist, biographer, besides being philosopher, which showed the diversity of his knowledge. He would spread it by teaching and via articles written in simple language and published at the most important newspapers of his time: [[O Estado de S. Paulo]], [[Folha de S.Paulo]] (formerly called ''Folha da Manhã)'', Jornal de São Paulo, Minerva de Buenos Aires and Jornadas do México. Member of the Paulista Writers Association, also of the Biology Society (at Instituto Histórico e Geográfico de São Paulo) and of the Ideas History Society of Mexico". Cruz Costa was forced to early retire by the [[Brazilian military government|military dictatorship]] in 1965, later dying in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=A.|first=Costa, Hebe C.

== Life ==
Born in 1904, São Paulo, Brazil; son of a Portuguese father and mother that descended from Italians, João da Cruz Costa wanted to become a doctor. His interest on medicine probably came from the fact that his father, José da Cruz Costa, died young on 1922, 49 years old, by the crisis derived from syphilis, which had first shown its setbacks since 1920. José was republican and had run away from Portugal after having beaten up a monarchist adversary, having thought to have killed him. José da Cruz Costa was a successful retailer, born in the village of Palheira at the outskirts of Coimbra, Portugal, and founded the furniture store called "''O Grande Oriente''" (The Great Orient) in [[São Paulo|São Paulo, Brazil]].

After his father's death, João Cruz Costa studied medicine for two years at ''Faculdade de Medicina da USP'' (USP Medicine Faculty), intending to become a psychiatrist. Without finishing the course, Cruz Costa decided to travel to France in 1923 to study psychology and later there decided to focus his studies in philosophy.&lt;blockquote&gt;[...] I began studying medicine, thus revealing a practical interest for the human being, if not for him, for his health. I had done some vague studies of philosophy with my longtime friend, prof. Henrique Geenen, to meet the demands of the preparatory meetings. To enter the Faculty of Medicine we were obliged to take a psychology and logic exam, which my friend and professor of the Faculty of Medicine, Professor Guilherme Bastos Milward, called illogical psychology. I then went to France in 1923 and entered the preparatory course of the Medical School of Paris. One day, in a group of Brazilians, I met Prof. Georges Dumas, who was a good friend of Brazil, who asked me what specialization I would do in medicine. My answer was: psychiatry. Old Dumas, who was a doctor and agrégé of Philosophy, then advised me to study philosophy and invited me to attend his amusing classes on Sundays at the Asyle de St'Anne. I enrolled as a listener in the courses at Sorbonne, attending classes of profs. Brunschvicg, Lalande, as well as those of [[Pierre Janet]] in the [[Collège de France]] (Costa, 1974. pp. 87-8).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=de Oliveira|first=Francini Venâncio|date=|title=A trajetória de João Cruz Costa e a formação da filosofia uspiana: algumas considerações sobre o campo intelectual brasileiro nas décadas de 1940 e 1950|url=http://www.revistas.usp.br/plural/article/viewFile/74595/78199|journal=PLURAL, Revista do Programa de Pós-Graduação em Sociologia da USP, v. 16, n. 2, pp. 65-74, 2009.|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;According to his own words in an interview for Trans / Form / Action Magazine in 1975,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cruz Costa|first=João|date=|title=João Cruz Costa|url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_abstract&amp;pid=S0101-31732011000300005&amp;lng=en&amp;nrm=iso&amp;tlng=pt|journal=Trans/Form/Ação|volume=34|pages=107–115|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cruz Costa considered that he was influenced by what he read:&lt;blockquote&gt;"In 1920 I was still not thinking autonomously, I was under the influence of what I was reading. I think most of my generation was suffering from the same. I read all of Eça de Queiroz, all of Anatole France, a lot of Balzac, Camilo, Fialho, Machado de Assis. It was my trip to Europe that opened my eyes to other realities ... 1930, be what it may, was a turning point for Brazilian culture and I was, among many others of my generation, at this crossroad. Some of them went to the right, others to the left, but all this was confusing for one and another ... The critical spirit that Philosophy study provides or improves, was not then the most accurate among those young people. Thus the confusion, falacies, misunderstandings, desillusions. I don't believe that Philosophy as an academic discipline teaches much. However, as the Dominican Maydieu wrote, although the "philosopher acquisition may seem poor, it nevertheless allows to coordinate many wealths." I thought it was worth worth paying attention to the richness of our reality. Hence my work since then.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;However, I consider my position to be an aging, outdated position. Today there is a more universal view of human problems. Fortunately, [[Mário de Andrade|Mario de Andrade]] said, in a letter to [[Manuel Bandeira]], that we would become more Brazilians as we become more universal. If speculative philosophy and practice lead us to this, they will succeed on what we had expected from them."&lt;/blockquote&gt;Returning to Brazil, João Cruz Costa (later known only by his surname, Cruz Costa) became the first student&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=de Oliveira|first=Francini Venâncio|date=|title=A trajetória de João Cruz Costa e a formação da filosofia uspiana: algumas considerações sobre o campo intelectual brasileiro nas décadas de 1940 e 1950|url=http://www.revistas.usp.br/plural/article/viewFile/74595/78199|journal=PLURAL, Revista do Programa de Pós-Graduação em Sociologia da USP, v. 16, n. 2, pp. 65-74, 2009.|volume=16|pages=65–74|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the then recently created Faculty of Philosophy of the [[University of São Paulo]] (USP), achieving the doctor's degree in 1942 and being the main responsible for the creation of the Department of Philosophy at USP.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1951, he finally achieved the highest academic rank, becoming a professor at the same university.

In 1958, he faced the outrages of the then Governor of São Paulo, [[Jânio Quadros]]: in January of that same year, Professor Cruz Costa received a reprimand for having granted an interview to Diários Associados (Brazilian newspaper), in which he had stated that the governor words were frivolous when he made reference to the then Director of FFLC Eurípedes Simões de Paula.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.br/books?id=WlJi_duak-EC&amp;pg=PA101&amp;lpg=PA101&amp;dq=%2522cruz+costa%2522+leviano&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=7yV7VdUEoV&amp;sig=CkF1SZcjTY7t3EDm4CS4Qu75_ZE&amp;hl=pt-BR&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjYwuTE4_DNAhXEIJAKHRCNC9QQ6AEIHjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%2522cruz%2520costa%2522%2520leviano&amp;f=false|title=Sociologia e política acadêmica nos anos 1960: a experiência do CESIT|last=Romão|first=Wagner de Melo|date=2006|publisher=Editora Humanitas|isbn=9788598292908|language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt; This episode had strong repercussion at the press, being front cover of [[Folha de S.Paulo|Folha da Manhã]] on January 3, 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://acervo.folha.uol.com.br/fdm/1958/01/03/1/#|title=Folha da Manhã - Edição de 03/01/1958|last=|first=|date=2016-07-13|website=acervo.folha.uol.com.br|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cruz Costa was forced to defend himself and brought the case to the STF (Brazilian Supreme Court), which granted his request on September 3, 1958,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://acervo.folha.com.br/index.do|title=Folha da Manhã - Edição de 18/01/1959|last=|first=|date=2017|website=|archive-url=acervo.folha.uol.com.br|archive-date=2017|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; canceling his punishment . In January 1959, Jânio Quadros accepted the decision and the Professor Cruz Costa ironically commented in Folha da Manhã: "It was always the habit of the governor to be brief, as it can be asserted by his famous notes. This time, however, he had to extend long excuses to the decision of the notable Supreme Court, which unanimously compelled him to cancel the act that had led me to appeal to that high Court of Justice."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://acervo.folha.com.br/index.do|title=Folha da Manhã - Edição de 22/01/1959|last=de São Paulo|first=Folha|date=2017|website=|archive-url=acervo.folha.uol.com.br|archive-date=2017|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 20, 1964, Professor Cruz Costa was obliged to testify at DOPS (Department of Order and Social Politics in Portuguese, an official governamental office to control and investigate social movements)  about a manifesto supporting the registration of the Brazilian Communist Party, created in September 1961, and allegedly signed by several intellectuals, among them Cruz Costa, [[Caio Prado Júnior|Caio Prado Jr.]], [[Florestan Fernandes]], student leaders, lawyers, trade unionists, among others. Naturally, he declared that "some of the signatories have a political or philosophical position different from communists, which is, by the way, what the declarant believes in. In any case, he believes that it would be more beneficial the Communist Party to be legally accepted than being on the underground, as happens in Italy, France, England and other truly democratic countries."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.arquivoestado.sp.gov.br/uploads/acervo/textual/deops/prontuarios/BR_SPAPESP_DEOPSOS001969.PDF|title=DEOPS - Depoimento de João Cruz Costa|last=Arquivo do Estado de São Paulo|first=|date=2017|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1965, Cruz Costa left his teaching activities, arbitrarily removed by the supporters of the [[Brazilian military government|1964 military coup]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://pt.scribd.com/doc/315517531/2-PLidiane-S-Rodrigues-Apresentacao-do-documento-Sobre-as-Origens-da-dialetica-do-trabalho-de-Joao-Quartim-de-Moraes-resentacion-portugues|title=2.PLidiane S.

The military regime established police-military investigations (IPM, acronym in Portuguese) accusing USP students, teachers and employees, which had begun at the second semester of that year, without sparing Professor Cruz Costa:&lt;blockquote&gt;At the Faculty of Philosophy, IPM was installed in a climate of great hostility by students and teachers. [[Mário Schenberg]], Cruz Costa and Florestan Fernandes were questioned. [[Fernando Henrique Cardoso]], also accused, had already accepted the invitation to teach abroad and left the country. During the investigation, Professor Florestan was arrested because of a letter of protest that he handed to the colonel responsible and which was only a defense of the dignity of being a teacher. The wave of protests provoked by this prison seemed to have contributed to stop the IPM questionings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.adusp.org.br/files/cadernos/livronegro.pdf|title=O livro negro da USP - O controle ideológico na Universidade|last=|first=|date=1978|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;On September 3, 1965, the Permanent Council of Justice of the 2nd Military Region decided by Cruz Costa pre-trial detention, as shown in his DOPS file, filed in the Public Archive of the State of São Paulo.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.arquivoestado.sp.gov.br/uploads/acervo/textual/deops/fichas/BR_SPAPESP_DEOPSSPOSFTEXSNC004925.pdf|title=Ficha DEOPS - João da Cruz Costa|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this file, he is falsely accused as "communist greatly related to Russia".

His most important contribution was Contribution to the History of Ideas in Brazil,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MZBXAAAAMAAJ|title=Contribuição à história das idéias no Brasil|last=Costa|first=Cruz|date=1967|publisher=Civilização Brasileira|language=pt}}&lt;/ref&gt; published in 1956 and later edited and translated into several languages. In his book, Cruz Costa defended a critic and more Brazilian-oriented thinking, not necessarily rejecting foreign authors (European and American) or uncritically accepting them. His aim was for creating something new, original and Brazilian.

'''Juliana González Valenzuela''' ([[Mexico]], September 19, 1936) is a  [[Mexico|Mexican]] [[philosopher]].

==Academic biography==
Juliana Gonzalez is a Mexican [[philosopher]] who has worked primarily in the areas of Greek Philosophy, [[Ontology]], [[Ethics]] and [[Bioethics]]. She was born in Mexico City in 1936. She studied in the Faculty of Philosophy and Literature of the National Autonomous University ([[UNAM]]) where she received an ample humanistic education in philosophy, psychology, theater and history. The time she attended university was marked by an intellectual boom due mainly to the presence of the Spanish exiles that arrived in Mexico from 1939 until the end of the Spanish Civil War. They were determinant in her studies, especially the Catalan philosopher Eduardo Nicol. She became his pupil as well as a member of his Seminar on Metaphysics for over 20 years and at the same time she worked in the field of Ethics on her own philosophical inquiries.

She began her career as a professor in the Faculty of Philosophy and Literature of UNAM in 1968. She taught Greek Philosophy, [[Metaphysics]] and [[Ethics]]. She has also been a Professor in the Postgraduate Research Seminars on Metaphysics, Ethics and [[Bioethics]]. As part of her formative work she has directed 45 theses (23 in BA, 22 postgraduate). Some of her students are now researchers or professors in different Universities and education centers.
She was named Professor Emeritus of the National University in 2000 and also received the distinction of Researcher Emeritus of the National System of Researchers of Mexico. She was awarded the National Award of Arts and Sciences in Philosophy in 2004,&lt;ref&gt;[http://Premio%20Nacional%20de%20Ciencias%20y%20Artes%202004]{{dead link|date=March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ordenjuridico.gob.mx/Federal/PE/APF/APC/SEP/Acuerdos/15122004.pdf |format=PDF |title=ACUERDO POR EL QUE SE OTORGA EL PREMIO NACIONAL DE CIENCIAS Y ARTES 2004. |website=Ordenjuridico.gob.mx |accessdate=2016-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; the National University Award in Research in Humanities)&lt;ref&gt;[http://Premio%20Universidad%20Nacional%202007%20-%20Investigación%20en%20Humanidades] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100923150541/http://www.cmc.dk/ |date=2010-09-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dgapa.unam.mx/reconocimientos/pun/pun_gan_07/pun08_gonzalez_07.pdf ]{{dead link|date=March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Doctorate Honoris Causa of UNAM.&lt;ref&gt;[http://Doctorado%20Honoris%20Causa]{{dead link|date=March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/notas/417016.html |title=NaciĂłn - OtorgarĂĄ UNAM doctorado Honoris Causa a Savater |publisher=El Universal |date=2015-10-08 |accessdate=2016-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parallel to her academic work, Juliana Gonzalez has held several offices at UNAM. She was the director of the Faculty of Philosophy and Literature from 1990 to 1998 and a member of the Governing Board from 1998 to 2006. She is currently the director of the Research Seminar of Ethics and Bioethics of the same University.&lt;ref&gt;[http://Seminario%20de%20Investigación%20de%20Ética%20y%20Bioética] {{dead link|date=March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical ideas and written works==
Juliana González has published 21 books, 7 as an author and 14 as an editor. She has also written 74 chapters in books and 60 articles in magazines.

As the pupil of Eduardo Nicol, Juliana Gonzalez has dedicated numerous writings to the study of the metaphysical and humanistic works of this author. She wrote a book titled The Dialectic Metaphysics of Eduardo Nicol (1981) and edited three more: Tribute to Eduardo Nicol (1990), Eduardo Nicol. Philosophy as Symbolic Reason (1998) and Eduardo Nicol (1998) as well as writing 16 book chapters and several articles on this subject. In the work of Juliana Gonzalez, Nicol’s philosophy has been a constant reference.

Her philosophical works has been centered mainly in the search for a new foundation of Ethics that can give an answer to the new knowledge and needs of our time. This research has led Juliana Gonzalez into some of the philosophical and scientific lines of thinking that have placed our conceptions of reality, life and human nature in crisis. Gonzalez has adopted the view that any historical advancement requires a return to the origins of Philosophy. From her perspective, we need a permanent dialogue with the Greek philosophers, unavoidable sources to use in order to renovate humanism and Ethics. This is especially true of [[Heraclitus]], [[Socrates]] and [[Plato]], authors Juliana Gonzalez has worked with in several of her books, mainly Ethics and Freedom (1989) and The Ethos, Destiny of Man (1996)&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=El ethos, destino del hombre|author1=Valenzuela, J.G.|author2=González, J.|date=1996|publisher=Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México|isbn=9789681646684|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X4sQAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=2015-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and The Power of Eros: Foundations and Values in Ethics and Bioethics&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite book|title=El poder de eros: fundamentos y valores de ética y bioética|author1=Gonzalez, J.|author2=V, J.G.|date=2000|publisher=Paidós|isbn=9789688534632|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7vybPAAACAAJ|accessdate=2015-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (2000).

From her earliest work, Juliana Gonzalez has delved in the study of the ontological issues of the being of man, freedom, time and human communication that were raised by the existentialist philosophers, especially [[Heidegger]] and [[Sartre]], as well as the literature of the time. These studies form the basis of her Master’s dissertation on Philosophy and several essays included in some of her books, markedly Ethics and Freedom. And even though she maintains a critical perspective faced with these authors, she is certain that this is the starting point for any and all future Ethics and Ontology.

Juliana Gonzalez has worked on finding the philosophical foundation of the ethical condition of man and freedom in human nature itself, from an immanent conception of man and critiquing the dualist conceptions that –from her philosophical view- are unsustainable. Also, she believes that free will is necessary for Ethics and it is in this line that she worked on a study from the Greek Philosophers to thinkers like Spinoza and writers such as [[Dostoyevsky]] and [[Kafka]], whom she considers crucial to Ethics. This work became the book Ethics and Freedom. Her research on the foundations of ethics and values were collected in the book The Ethos, Destiny of Man and The Power of Eros.

The Ethos, Destiny of Man is a book that explores and proposes a humanistic foundation of Ethics while acknowledging an Ontology of man capable of explaining the ethical condition as well the axiological one. One of the virtues of this book is that it gets over the clash between the realms of being and value.

In the Power of Eros, the author proposes an integral view of the moral facts. In this book, Juliana Gonzalez works on the subject of Eros as a vital origin of Ethics and as a way to understand human nature with categories that explain the ambiguity, the temporal condition and the constitutive ethical framework of human beings. In the second part of the book she deals with issues of bioethics, the present and future of the human condition. The main points she holds here are that Bioethics is a philosophical and lay issue, its ontological foundation, centered on human nature, the universal character of humanistic criteria, the relativity of moral decisions as well as the need for a multidisciplinary comprehension of bioethical issues.

In another cultural context, far from the platonic one, Juliana Gonzalez finds the mythical symbol of [[Eros]] in the work of [[Freud]]. And it is here, in the study of the Cultural Revolution that Freudian psychoanalysis brought to our attention, that the author finds another relevant subject to understand the crisis of ethical thinking. In her book Freud and the Crisis of Ethics (1986), she proposes a philosophical understanding of Freud’s work, highlighting on the one hand the aspects that contribute to questioning the meaning of culture and morality and on the other, the meaningful moment when Freud identifies Eros with the life impulses that are opposed to the death impulses of [[Thanatos]]. The erotic impulses are then, for the author, interpreted as the foundation for the ethical condition of man.

For Juliana Gonzalez, it is impossible to ignore [[Nietzsche]] in the analysis of ethical issues, since his work has been determinant to both the crisis of Ethics and the new horizons that it opens for us, as she discusses in her book The Hero in the Soul: Three Essays on Nietszche (1994).

Other issues Juliana Gonzalez has worked on are the problems of medical ethics in particular and bioethics in general. She has worked on these problems from a philosophical perspective that converges with the advances in life sciences. This view includes matters of praxis, theory and knowledge, all derived from the advancement of genomics and neurosciences especially. She has shown that some of these advancements can create a crisis for our conception of humankind that is focused on freedom and morality. In this sense, what is most important for philosophy is not the principles and norms of bioethics that guide the scientific and technological work, but the impact the new knowledge has on our traditional conceptions of life and the human reality as well as other life forms, and our individual and social life.

From her work on the ethical issues stemming from genetics, Juliana Gonzalez wrote Human Genome and Human Dignity)&lt;ref name="google3"&gt;{{cite book|title=Genoma humano y dignidad humana|author=Valenzuela, J.G.|date=2005|publisher=Anthropos|isbn=9788476587218|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e4KyhjDw-goC|accessdate=2015-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; (2005). This book expresses her philosophical awe of the facts revealed by molecular genetics (in particular the unity of life through DNA) and she presents a critical analysis of the ontological issues of dignity and human freedom in face of determinism and genetic manipulation, both of individuals and communities.

Juliana Gonzalez founded the Research Seminar on Ethics and Bioethics in 1998, which was transformed into the Seminar on Ethics and Bioethics in 02 and finally into the current Research Seminar on Ethics and Bioethics in 2009. This Seminar works on multidisciplinary research and has produced several books with the participation of biologists, geneticists, historians, neuroscientists, psychologists, philosophers, medical doctors, lawyers, ecologists, economists, etc.… The Seminar has published the following books: Bioethical Dilemmas, Bioethical Perspectives, Philosophy and Life Sciences and is working on another one, to be published soon: Rethinking Life and Value.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11004">'''Michael Uebel''' (born 1964), a pioneer in the application of psychological insights to the historical intersections of social, personal, and imaginative phenomena, is a psychotherapist and researcher in [[Austin, Texas]].  He has taught literature and critical theory at the [[University of Virginia]],&lt;ref&gt;"Contributors," ''Becoming Male in the Middle Ages'', eds. J. J. Cohen &amp; B. Wheeler (New York: Garland Publishing, 1997), p. 387.&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Georgetown University]], where he taught in the Communication, Culture, and Technology Program and the English Department,&lt;ref&gt;"Contributors," ''New Literary History'', special issue on Medieval Studies, 28.2 (1997), p. 422.&lt;/ref&gt; and at the [[University of Kentucky]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bgsu.edu/offices/mc/news/2008/news47096.html&lt;/ref&gt; where he held a faculty position in the Department of English, and was affiliated with the Committee on Social Theory and Women’s Studies. As of 2012, Uebel has been appointed Lecturer in the School of Social Work at the University of Texas at Austin.  He is the author and/or editor of three major studies and the author of over 40 journal essays and encyclopedia articles.  Uebel lectures nationally and internationally on issues concerning social history, mental health, and the challenges of [[humanism]].  In 2009, he co-founded the Interdependence Project-Austin, a branch of the New York city-based nonprofit organization (IDP) dedicated to fostering the intersection of the arts, activism, and contemplative traditions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theidproject.org/regions/austin-tx Interdependence Project-Austin]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Joshunda Sanders, "Buddhist Tradition Thrives in Austin," ''Austin American-Statesman'', 28 March 2010. Online at http://www.statesman.com/news/news/opinion/buddhist-tradition-thrives-in-austin/nRrbQ/. Retrieved February 17, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;  Uebel serves as Director of Contemplative Studies.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theidproject.org/node/85&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education ==
From the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]], Uebel received his B.A., with Distinction, in the fields of comparative literature and English literature. He completed both his M.A. and PhD in literature at the University of Virginia, continuing his post-doctoral studies by earning the Master of Science in Social Work Degree from the University of Texas at Austin.  He also studied psychotherapy at both the Houston-Galveston Psychoanalytic Institute and is currently an instructor and student at the Austin Center for Relational Psychoanalysis and Psychotherapy.&lt;ref&gt;"Contributors," ''Cultural Studies of the Modern Middle Ages'', eds. E. A. Joy, K. K. Bell, &amp; M. K. Ramsey (New York: Palgrave Macmillan, 2007), p. 302.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research and practice focus ==
Uebel’s research is best described as humanistic. Examining issues such as the formation of [[Utopia|utopian thought]], the ideology of [[Gender Studies|gender relations]], and the potentials of human existence, Uebel has urged a reconnaissance of disciplines as seemingly disparate as psychoanalysis, [[gerontology]], philosophy, and social science. Uebel is forging an approach to literary, philosophical, and social phenomena that eludes the [[narcissistic]] allegorization of history that mires much contemporary cultural studies work.  Increasingly, Uebel's writing focuses on the currents of cultural analysis in the humanities.&lt;ref&gt;https://utexas.academia.edu/MichaelUebel&lt;/ref&gt;

As a psychotherapist, Uebel’s practice and research focus on issues related to the social contexts of psychopathology and treatment modalities that address the person, the social body, and the relational world, including [[Mindfulness (psychology)|mindfulness]] modalities, [[Gestalt Therapy|gestalt therapy]], and [[Acceptance and commitment therapy|Acceptance and Commitment Therapy (ACT)]].&lt;ref&gt;https://therapists.psychologytoday.com/rms/name/Michael_Uebel_PhD,LCSW_Austin_Texas_46379&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influences ==
Significant influences on Uebel include the humanistic psychologists [[Rollo May]], [[Abraham Maslow]], [[Fritz Perls]], [[Thomas Szasz]], and [[Robert Jay Lifton]], the politically engaged psychoanalysts [[Wilhelm Reich]], [[Erich Fromm]], and [[Herbert Marcuse]], and the less easily pigeon-holed thinkers [[Walter Benjamin]], [[Félix Guattari]], and [[Paul Goodman (writer)|Paul Goodman]].

== Major works ==
Uebel’s major works to date include a study of the legend of [[Prester John]]&lt;ref&gt;Uebel has been called "one of the foremost scholars and the translator of the 'Letter of Prester John.'" See Michael Calabrese, Review of ''The Postcolonial Middle Ages'', in ''The Medieval Review'', 2001, 01.10.16.&lt;/ref&gt; and utopian thought formation in the early Middle Ages ([http://catalog.loc.gov/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?DB=local&amp;CNT=10&amp;CMD=10+records+per+page&amp;CMD=lccn+%20%202005047193 ''Ecstatic Transformation:  On the Uses of Alterity in the Middle Ages''], 2005), a volume of essays on the cultural intersections of race and masculinity (with Harry Stecopoulos, [http://catalog.loc.gov/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?DB=local&amp;CNT=10&amp;CMD=10+records+per+page&amp;CMD=lccn+%20%20%2096049942%20 ''Race and the Subject of Masculinities''], 1997), and a volume of essays on the significance of labor in the High Middle Ages (with Kellie Robertson, [http://www.worldcatlibraries.org/wcpa/top3mset/53289613 ''The Middle Ages at Work''], 2004).  He has also edited a volume of essays on medieval culture for ''[[New Literary History]]'' (1996).

'''Michel Eyquem de Montaigne, Lord of Montaigne''' ({{IPAc-en|m|ɒ|n|ˈ|t|eɪ|n}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/montaigne "Montaigne"]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-fr|miʃɛl ekɛm də mɔ̃tɛɲ|lang}}; 28 February 1533&amp;nbsp;– 13 September 1592&lt;ref name=cne/&gt;) was one of the most significant philosophers of the [[French Renaissance]], known for popularizing the [[Essays (Montaigne)|essay]] as a [[literary genre]]. His work is noted for its merging of casual anecdotes&lt;ref&gt;His anecdotes are 'casual' only in appearance; Montaigne writes: 'Neither my anecdotes nor my quotations are always employed simply as examples, for authority, or for ornament...They often carry, off the subject under discussion, the seed of a richer and more daring matter, and they resonate obliquely with a more delicate tone,' Michel de Montaigne, ''Essais'', Pléiade, Paris (ed. A. Thibaudet) 1937, Bk. 1, ch.40, p. 252 (tr. Charles Rosen)&lt;/ref&gt; and autobiography with serious intellectual insight; his massive volume ''[[Essays (Montaigne)|Essais]]'' contains some of the most influential essays ever written.

Montaigne had a direct influence on Western writers, including [[Francis Bacon]], [[René Descartes]],&lt;ref&gt;Buckley, Michael J., At the Origins of Modern Atheism, Yale UP, 1990, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Blaise Pascal]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], [[Albert Hirschman]], [[William Hazlitt]],&lt;ref name="Kinnaird p. 274"&gt;Kinnaird, John, ''William Hazlitt: Critic of Power'', Columbia University Press, 1978, p. 274.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche]], [[Stefan Zweig]], [[Eric Hoffer]],&lt;ref&gt;from ''Truth Imagined'', memoir by Eric Hoffer.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Isaac Asimov]], and possibly on the later works of [[William Shakespeare]].

In his own lifetime, Montaigne was admired more as a [[Politician|statesman]] than as an author. The tendency in his essays to digress into anecdotes and personal ruminations was seen as detrimental to proper style rather than as an innovation, and his declaration that, "I am myself the matter of my book", was viewed by his contemporaries as self-indulgent. In time, however, Montaigne would come to be recognized as embodying, perhaps better than any other author of his time, the spirit of freely entertaining doubt which began to emerge at that time. He is most famously known for his [[Skepticism|skeptical]] remark, "''Que sçay-je''?" ("What do I know?", in [[Middle French]]; now rendered as ''Que sais-je?'' in modern French).

Montaigne was born in the [[Aquitaine]] region of France, on the family estate [[Château de Montaigne]], in a town now called [[Saint-Michel-de-Montaigne]], close to [[Bordeaux]]. The family was very wealthy; his great-grandfather, Ramon Felipe Eyquem, had made a fortune as a herring merchant and had bought the estate in 1477, thus becoming the Lord of Montaigne. His father, Pierre Eyquem, Seigneur of Montaigne, was a [[Catholic Church in France|French Catholic]] soldier in Italy for a time and had also been the mayor of Bordeaux.&lt;ref name=cne/&gt;

Although there were several families bearing the [[patronym]] "Eyquem" in Guyenne, his father's family is thought to have had some degree of [[Marrano]] ([[Spanish and Portuguese Jewish]]) origins,&lt;ref&gt;Sophie Jama, ''L’Histoire Juive de Montaigne'' [''The Jewish History of Montaigne''], Paris, Flammarion, 2001, p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; while his mother, Antoinette López de Villanueva, was a convert to Protestantism.&lt;ref&gt;"His mother was a Jewish Protestant, his father a Catholic who achieved wide culture as well as a considerable fortune."

[[Image:ArmoiriesMichelDeMontaigne.svg|right|200px|thumb|The coat of arms of Michel Eyquem, Lord of Montaigne]]
His mother lived a great part of Montaigne's life near him, and even survived him, but is mentioned only twice in his essays. Montaigne's relationship with his father, however, is frequently reflected upon and discussed in his essays.

Montaigne's education began in early childhood and followed a [[pedagogy|pedagogical plan]] that his father had developed, refined by the advice of the latter's [[humanism|humanist]] friends. Soon after his birth, Montaigne was brought to a small cottage, where he lived the first three years of life in the sole company of a peasant family, in order to, according to the elder Montaigne, "draw the boy close to the people, and to the life conditions of the people, who need our help".&lt;ref&gt;Montaigne. ''Essays'', III, 13&lt;/ref&gt; After these first spartan years, Montaigne was brought back to the château. The objective was for [[Latin language|Latin]] to become his first language.

The intellectual education of Montaigne was assigned to a German tutor (a doctor named Horstanus, who could not speak French). His father hired only servants who could speak Latin, and they were also given strict orders always to speak to the boy in Latin. The same rule applied to his mother, father, and servants, who were obliged to use only Latin words he himself employed, and thus acquired a knowledge of the very language his tutor taught him. Montaigne's Latin education was accompanied by constant intellectual and spiritual stimulation. He was familiarized with Greek by a pedagogical method that employed games, conversation, and exercises of solitary meditation, rather than the more traditional books.

The atmosphere of the boy's upbringing, although designed by highly refined rules taken under advisement by his father, created in the boy's life the spirit of "liberty and delight" to "make me relish... duty by an unforced will, and of my own voluntary motion...without any severity or constraint"; yet he would have everything to take advantage of his freedom. And so a musician woke him every morning, playing one instrument or another,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first= Robert Maynard|editor1-last=Hutchins |editor2-first=W. Carew|editor2-last=Hazlitt |others= Trans. Charles Cotton|title=The Essays of Michel Eyquem de Montaigne |accessdate= |series=Great Books of the Western World |volume=twenty-five |year= 1952|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |page=v |quote=He had his son awakened each morning by 'the sound of a musical instrument'}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an ''[[épinettier]]'' (with a [[zither]]) was the constant companion to Montaigne and his tutor, playing a tune to alleviate boredom and tiredness.

Around the year 1539, Montaigne was sent to study at a prestigious [[boarding school]] in Bordeaux, the [[College of Guienne|Collège de Guyenne]], then under the direction of the greatest Latin scholar of the era, [[George Buchanan]], where he mastered the whole curriculum by his thirteenth year. He then began his study of law at the [[University of Toulouse II – Le Mirail|University of Toulouse]] in 1546 and entered a career in the local legal system. He was a counselor of the Court des Aides of [[Périgueux]] and, in 1557, he was appointed counselor of the [[Parlement]] in Bordeaux (a high court). From 1561 to 1563 he was [[courtier]] at the court of [[Charles IX of France|Charles IX]]; he was present with the king at the [[siege of Rouen (1562)]]. He was awarded the highest honour of the French nobility, the [[Collar (Order of Knighthood)|collar]] of the Order of St. Michael, something to which he aspired from his youth. While serving at the Bordeaux Parlement, he became very close friends with the humanist poet [[Étienne de la Boétie]], whose death in 1563 deeply affected Montaigne. It has been suggested by Donald M. Frame, in his introduction to ''The Complete Essays of Montaigne'' that because of Montaigne's "imperious need to communicate" after losing Étienne, he began the ''[[Essais]]'' as his "means of communication" and that "the reader takes the place of the dead friend".&lt;ref&gt;Frame, Donald (translator). ''The Complete Essays of Montaigne.'' 1958. p. v.&lt;/ref&gt;

Montaigne married Françoise de la Cassaigne in 1565, probably in an arranged marriage. She was the well-got daughter and niece of merchants of Toulouse and Bordeaux. They had six daughters, but only the second-born, Léonor, survived infancy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/09/07/me-myself-and-i The New Yorker]&lt;/ref&gt; Little is known about their marriage, a few words only escaping from Montaigne himself on the subject – he wrote of his daughter Léonor, "All my children die at nurse; but Léonore, our only daughter, who has escaped this misfortune, has reached the age of six and more without having been punished, the indulgence of her mother aiding, except in words, and those very gentle ones."&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/montaigneessayi04johngoog/montaigneessayi04johngoog_djvu.txt Archive.org]&lt;/ref&gt; His daughter married François de la Tour and later Charles de Gamaches and had a daughter by each.&lt;ref&gt;[https://montaigne.univ-tours.fr/category/documents/leonor/ Montaigne.univ-tours.fr]&lt;/ref&gt;
{{French literature sidebar}}
Following the petition of his father, Montaigne started to work on the first translation of the Catalan monk [[Raymond Sebond]]'s ''[[Theologia naturalis]]'', which he published a year after his father's death in 1568 (In 1595, Sebond's Prologue was put on the [[Index Librorum Prohibitorum]] for its declaration that the Bible is not the only source of revealed truth). After this, he inherited the family's estate, the Château de Montaigne, to which he moved back in 1570, thus becoming the Lord of Montaigne. Another literary accomplishment was Montaigne's posthumous edition of his friend Boétie's works.

In 1571, he retired from public life to the [[Montaigne's tower|Tower of the Château]], his so-called "citadel", in the [[Dordogne]], where he almost totally isolated himself from every social and family affair. Locked up in his library, which contained a collection of some 1,500 works, he began work on his ''Essais'' ("Essays"), first published in 1580. On the day of his 38th birthday, as he entered this almost ten-year period of self-imposed reclusion, he had the following inscription crown the bookshelves of his working chamber:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the year of Christ 1571, at the age of thirty-eight, on the last day of February, his birthday, Michael de Montaigne, long weary of the servitude of the court and of public employments, while still entire, retired to the bosom of the learned virgins, where in calm and freedom from all cares he will spend what little remains of his life, now more than half run out. If the fates permit, he will complete this abode, this sweet ancestral retreat; and he has consecrated it to his freedom, tranquility, and leisure.&lt;ref&gt;As cited by Richard L. Regosin, ‘Montaigne and His Readers', in Denis Hollier (ed.) ''A New History of French Literature'', Harvard University Press, Cambridge, Massachusetts, London 1995, pp. 248–52, p. 249. The Latin original runs: 'An. Christi 1571 aet. 38, pridie cal. mart., die suo natali, Mich. Montanus, servitii aulici et munerum publicorum jamdudum pertaesus, dum se integer in doctarum virginum recessit sinus, ubi quietus et omnium securus (quan)tillum in tandem superabit decursi multa jam plus parte spatii: si modo fata sinunt exigat istas sedes et dulces latebras, avitasque, libertati suae, tranquillitatique, et otio consecravit.' as cited in Helmut Pfeiffer, 'Das Ich als Haushalt:Montaignes ökonomische Politik’, in Rudolf Behrens, Roland Galle (eds.) ''Historische Anthropologie und Literatur:Romanistische Beträge zu einem neuen Paradigma der Literaturwissenschaft'', Königshausen und Neumann, Würzburg, 1995 pp. 69–90 p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During this time of the [[French Wars of Religion|Wars of Religion]] in France, Montaigne, a Roman Catholic, acted as a moderating force,{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} respected both by the Catholic [[Henry III of France|King Henry III]] and the Protestant [[Henry of Navarre]]. Montaigne believed that a knowledge of devastating effects of vice is calculated to excite an aversion to vicious habits.

In 1578, Montaigne, whose health had always been excellent, started suffering from painful [[kidney stone disease|kidney stone]]s, a sickness he had inherited from his father's family. Throughout this illness, he would have nothing to do with doctors or drugs.&lt;ref name=cne/&gt; From 1580 to 1581, Montaigne traveled in France, Germany, Austria, Switzerland, and Italy, partly in search of a cure, establishing himself at [[Bagni di Lucca]] where he took the waters. His journey was also a pilgrimage to the [[Holy House of Loreto]], to which he presented a silver relief depicting himself and his wife and daughter kneeling before the Madonna, considering himself fortunate that it should be hung on a wall within the shrine.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Chaney]], ''The Evolution of the Grand Tour: Anglo-Italian Cultural Relations since the Renaissance'', 2nd ed. (London, 2000), p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; He kept a fascinating journal recording regional differences and customs&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Montaigne et la coutume|last = Cazeaux|first = Guillaume|publisher = Mimésis|year = 2015|isbn = 9788869760044|location = Milan|pages = |trans-title = Montaigne and the custom|url = http://editionsmimesis.fr/catalogue/livres/philosophie-et-societe/montaigne-et-la-coutume|archive-url = https://archive.is/20151030014053/http://editionsmimesis.fr/catalogue/livres/philosophie-et-societe/montaigne-et-la-coutume|dead-url = yes|archive-date = 2015-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a variety of personal episodes, including the dimensions of the stones he succeeded in ejecting from his bladder. This was published much later, in 1774, after its discovery in a trunk which is displayed in his tower.&lt;ref&gt;''Montaigne's Travel Journal'', translated with an introduction by Donald M. Frame and foreword by Guy Davenport, San Francisco, 1983&lt;/ref&gt;

During Montaigne's visit to the Vatican, as he described in his travel journal, the ''Essais'' were examined by [[Sisto Fabri]] who served as [[Theologian of the Pontifical Household|Master of the Sacred Palace]] under [[Pope Gregory XIII]]. After Fabri examined Montaigne's ''Essais'' the text was returned to its author on 20 March 1581. Montaigne had apologized for references to the pagan notion of "fortuna" as well as for writing favorably of [[Julian the Apostate]] and of heretical poets, and was released to follow his own conscience in making emendations to the text.&lt;ref&gt;''Treccani.it, L'encicolpedia Italiana, [http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/sisto-fabri_(Dizionario-Biografico)/ Dizionario Biografico'']. Accessed 10 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Michel de Montaigne Italienreise.png|thumb|300px|Journey to Italy by Michel de Montaigne 1580–1581]]
While in the city of [[Lucca]] in 1581, he learned that, like his father before him, he had been elected mayor of Bordeaux; he returned and served as mayor. He was re-elected in 1583 and served until 1585, again moderating between Catholics and Protestants. The [[Black Death|plague]] broke out in Bordeaux toward the end of his second term in office, in 1585. In 1586, the plague and the Wars of Religion prompted him to leave his château for two years.&lt;ref name=cne/&gt;

Montaigne continued to extend, revise, and oversee the publication of ''Essais''. In 1588 he wrote its third book and also met the writer [[Marie de Gournay]], who admired his work and later edited and published it. Montaigne called her his adopted daughter.&lt;ref name=cne&gt;{{Cite Collier's|wstitle=Montaigne, Michel, Seigneur}}&lt;/ref&gt; King [[Henry III of France|Henry III]] was assassinated in 1589, and Montaigne then helped to keep Bordeaux loyal to [[Henry of Navarre]], who would go on to become King Henry IV.

Montaigne died of [[Peritonsillar abscess|quinsy]] at the age of 59, in 1592 at the Château de Montaigne. The disease in his case "brought about paralysis of the tongue",&lt;ref&gt;Montaigne, Michel de, ''Essays of Michel de Montaigne'', tr. [[Charles Cotton]], ed. [[William Carew Hazlitt]], 1877, "The Life of Montaigne" in v. 1. n.p., Kindle edition.&lt;/ref&gt; and he had once said "the most fruitful and natural play of the mind is conversation. I find it sweeter than any other action in life; and if I were forced to choose, I think I would rather lose my sight than my hearing and voice."&lt;ref&gt;"The Autobiography of Michel De Montaign", translated, introduced, and edited by Marvin Lowenthal, David R. Godine Publishing, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; Remaining in possession of all his other faculties, he requested mass, and died during the celebration of that mass.&lt;ref&gt;"Biographical Note", Encyclopædia Britannica "Great Books of the Western World", Vol. 25, p. vi "Montaigne"&lt;/ref&gt;

He was buried nearby. Later his remains were moved to the church of [[Saint]] [[Antoine]] at Bordeaux. The church no longer exists: it became the [[Convent des Feuillants]], which has also disappeared.&lt;ref&gt;Bakewell, Sarah. ''How to Live – or – A Life of Montaigne in One Question and Twenty Attempts at an Answer'' (2010), pp. 325–26, 365 n. 325.&lt;/ref&gt; The Bordeaux Tourist Office says that Montaigne is buried at the Musée Aquitaine, Faculté des Lettres, Université Bordeaux 3 Michel de Montaigne, [[Pessac]]. His heart is preserved in the parish church of [[Saint-Michel-de-Montaigne]].

The humanities branch of the [[University of Bordeaux]] is named after him: {{nowrap|''Université Michel de Montaigne Bordeaux 3''}}.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.u-bordeaux-montaigne.fr/en/university/discover-bordeaux-montaigne.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Essais''==
{{Main article|Essays (Montaigne)}}
His humanism finds expression in his ''Essais'', a collection of a large number of short subjective treatments of various topics published in 1580, inspired by his studies in the classics, especially by the works of [[Plutarch]] and [[Lucretius]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Titi Lucretii Cari De rerum natura libri sex (Montaigne.1.4.4)|url=http://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/PR-MONTAIGNE-00001-00004-00004/1|publisher=Cambridge Digital Library|accessdate=9 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Montaigne's stated goal is to describe humans, and especially himself, with utter frankness.
Montaigne's writings are studied as literature and philosophy around the world.

[[File:Michel de Montaigne.jpg|thumb|Michel de Montaigne]]
Inspired by his consideration of the lives and ideals of the leading figures of his age, he finds the great variety and volatility of human nature to be its most basic features. He describes his own poor memory, his ability to solve problems and mediate conflicts without truly getting emotionally involved, his disdain for the human pursuit of lasting fame, and his attempts to detach himself from worldly things to prepare for his timely death. He writes about his disgust with the religious conflicts of his time. He believed that humans are not able to attain true certainty. The longest of his essays, ''Apology for Raymond Sebond'', marking his adoption of [[Pyrrhonism]] contains his famous motto, "What do I know?"

Montaigne considered marriage necessary for the raising of children, but disliked strong feelings of passionate love because he saw them as detrimental to freedom. In education, he favored concrete examples and experience over the teaching of abstract knowledge that has to be accepted uncritically. His essay "On the Education of Children" is dedicated to [[Diana of Foix]].

The ''Essais'' exercised important influence on both French and English literature, in thought and style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bloom|first=Harold|title=The Western Canon}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Francis Bacon]]'s [[Essays (Francis Bacon)|''Essays'']], published over a decade later, in 1596, are usually assumed to be directly influenced by Montaigne's collection, and Montaigne is cited by Bacon alongside other classical sources in later essays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bakewell|first=Sarah|title=How to live : a life of Montaigne in one question and twenty attempts at an answer|year=2010|publisher=Vintage|location=London|isbn=9780099485155|page=280|url=https://books.google.com/?id=27yZQxm0OX8C&amp;pg=PA280}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Montaigne's influence on psychology==
Though not a scientist, Montaigne made observations on topics in [[psychology]].&lt;ref name="King"&gt;King, Brett; Viney, Wayne; Woody, William.''A History of Psychology: Ideas and Context'', 4th ed., Pearson Education, Inc. 2009, p. 112.&lt;/ref&gt; In his essays, he developed and explained his observations of these topics. His thoughts and ideas covered topics such as thought, motivation, fear, happiness, [[child education]], experience, and human action. Montaigne’s ideas have influenced psychology and are a part of psychology’s rich history.

===Child education===
Child education was among the psychological topics that he wrote about.&lt;ref name="King"/&gt; His essays ''On the Education of Children'', ''On Pedantry'', and ''On Experience'' explain the views he had on child education.&lt;ref name="Hall1997"&gt;Hall, Michael L.

Montaigne’s views on the education of children were opposed to the common educational practices of his day.&lt;ref name="Hall1997"/&gt;{{rp|63}}{{rp|67}}He found fault with both what was taught and how it was taught.&lt;ref name="Hall1997"/&gt;{{rp|62}} Much of the education during Montaigne’s time was focused on the reading of the classics and learning through books.&lt;ref name="Hall1997"/&gt;{{rp|67}}Montaigne disagreed with learning strictly through books. He believed it was necessary to educate children in a variety of ways. He also disagreed with the way information was being presented to students. It was being presented in a way that encouraged students to take the information that was taught to them as absolute truth. Students were denied the chance to question the information. Therefore, students could not truly learn. Montaigne believed that, to learn truly, a student had to take the information and make it their own.

At the foundation Montaigne believed that the selection of a good tutor was important for the student to become well educated.&lt;ref name="Hall1997"/&gt;{{rp|66}} Education by a tutor was to be done at the pace of the student.&lt;ref name="Hall1997"/&gt;{{rp|67}}He believed that a tutor should be in dialogue with the student, letting the student speak first. The tutor should also allow for discussions and debates to be had. Through this dialogue, it was meant to create an environment in which students would teach themselves. They would be able to realize their mistakes and make corrections to them as necessary.

Individualized learning was also integral to his theory of child education. He argued that the student combines information he already knows with what is learned and forms a unique perspective on the newly learned information.&lt;ref name="Worley"&gt;Worley, Virginia. ''Painting With Impasto: Metaphors, Mirrors, and Reflective Regression in Montagne's 'Of the Education of Children.' '' ''Educational Theory'', June 2012, Vol. 62 Issue 3, p. 343–70.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|356}} Montaigne also thought that tutors should encourage a student’s natural curiosity and allow them to question things.&lt;ref name="Hall1997"/&gt;{{rp|68}}He postulated that successful students were those who were encouraged to question new information and study it for themselves, rather than simply accepting what they had heard from the authorities on any given topic. Montaigne believed that a child’s curiosity could serve as an important teaching tool when the child is allowed to explore the things that they are curious about.

Experience was also a key element to learning for Montaigne. Tutors needed to teach students through experience rather than through the mere memorization of knowledge often practised in book learning.&lt;ref name="Hall1997"/&gt;{{rp|62}}{{rp|67}}He argued that students would become passive adults; blindly obeying and lacking the ability to think on their own.&lt;ref name="Worley"/&gt;{{rp|354}} Nothing of importance would be retained and no abilities would be learned.&lt;ref name="Hall1997"/&gt;{{rp|62}} He believed that learning through experience was superior to learning through the use of books.&lt;ref name="Ediger"/&gt; For this reason he encouraged tutors to educate their students through practice, travel, and human interaction. In doing so, he argued that students would become active learners, who could claim knowledge for themselves.

Montaigne’s views on child education continue to have an influence in the present. Variations of Montaigne’s ideas on education are incorporated into modern learning in some ways. He argued against the popular way of teaching in his day, encouraging individualized learning. He believed in the importance of experience over book learning and memorization. Ultimately, Montaigne postulated that the point of education was to teach a student how to have a successful life by practising an active and socially interactive lifestyle.&lt;ref name="Worley"/&gt;{{rp|355}}

Thinkers exploring similar ideas to Montaigne include [[Erasmus]], [[Thomas More]], and [[Guillaume Budé]], who all worked about fifty years before Montaigne.&lt;ref name="friedrich"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E0lPH4P9kIMC&amp;pg=PA391|title=Montaigne|first1=Hugo|last1=Friedrich|last2=Desan|first2=Philippe|year=1991|isbn=9780520072534|page=|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of Montaigne's Latin quotations are from Erasmus' ''[[Adagia]]'', and most critically, all of his quotations from [[Socrates]]. [[Plutarch]] remains perhaps Montaigne's strongest influence, in terms of substance and style.{{sfn|Friedrich|1991|p=71}}  Montaigne's quotations from Plutarch in the ''Essays'' number well over 500.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Classical Heritage in France|chapter=Plutarch's ''Lives''|first=Alain|last=Billault|year=2002|isbn=9789004119161|editor=Gerald N.

Ever since [[Edward Capell]] first made the suggestion in 1780, scholars have suggested Montaigne to be an influence on Shakespeare.&lt;ref name="olivier"/&gt; The latter would have had access to [[John Florio]]'s translation of Montaigne's ''Essais'', published in English in 1603, and a scene in ''[[The Tempest]]'' "follows the wording of Florio [translating ''[[Of Cannibals]]''] so closely that his indebtedness is unmistakable".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=How Great Was Shakespeare's Debt to Montaigne? |first=Alice |last=Harmon |journal=[[Publications of the Modern Language Association of America|PMLA]] |volume=57 |issue=4 |year=1942 |pages=988–1008 |jstor=458873}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, most parallels between the two can be explained as [[:en:wikt:commonplace|commonplaces]]:&lt;ref name="olivier"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Olivier |first=T. |title=Shakespeare and Montaigne: A Tendency of Thought |journal=Theoria |volume=54 |year=1980 |pages=43–59}}&lt;/ref&gt; as with [[Miguel de Cervantes|Cervantes]], [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s similarities with writers in other nations could be due simply to their simultaneous study of Latin moral and philosophical writers such as [[Seneca the Younger]], [[Horace]], [[Ovid]] and [[Virgil]].

Much of [[Blaise Pascal]]'s skepticism in his ''[[Pensées]]'' has been traditionally attributed to his reading Montaigne.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Eliot|first=Thomas Stearns|title=Introduction to Pascal's Essays|year=1958|publisher=E. P. Dutton and Co.|location=New York|page=viii|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/18269/18269-8.txt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The English essayist [[William Hazlitt]] expressed boundless admiration for Montaigne, exclaiming that "he was the first who had the courage to say as an author what he felt as a man. ... He was neither a pedant nor a bigot.  ... In treating of men and manners, he spoke of them as he found them, not according to preconceived notions and abstract dogmas".&lt;ref&gt;Quoted from Hazlitt's "On the Periodical Essayists" in Park, Roy, ''Hazlitt and the Spirit of the Age'', Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1971, pp. 172–73.&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning most overtly with the essays in the "[[Familiar essay|familiar]]" style in his own ''[[Table-Talk (Hazlitt)|Table-Talk]]'', Hazlitt tried to follow Montaigne's example.&lt;ref name="Kinnaird p. 274"/&gt;

[[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] chose "Montaigne; or, the Skeptic" as a subject of one of his series of lectures entitled ''Representative Men'', alongside other subjects such as Shakespeare and Plato. In "The Skeptic" Emerson writes of his experience reading Montaigne, "It seemed to me as if I had myself written the book, in some former life, so sincerely it spoke to my thought and experience." [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] judged of Montaigne: "That such a man wrote has truly augmented the joy of living on this Earth".&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche, ''Untimely Meditations'', Chapter 3, "Schopenhauer as Educator", Cambridge University Press, 1988, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; [[Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve|Sainte-Beuve]] advises us that "to restore lucidity and proportion to our judgments, let us read every evening a page of Montaigne."&lt;ref&gt;Sainte-Beuve, "Montaigne", "Literary and Philosophical Essays", Ed. Charles W. Eliot, New York: P. F. Collier &amp; Son, 1938.&lt;/ref&gt;

The American philosopher [[Eric Hoffer]] employed Montaigne both stylistically and in thought. In Hoffer's memoir, ''Truth Imagined'', he said of Montaigne, "He was writing about me. He knew my innermost thoughts." The British novelist [[John Cowper Powys]] expressed his admiration for Montaigne's philosophy in his books ''Suspended Judgements'' (1916)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Suspended Judgments|last=Powys|first=John Cowper|publisher=G.A. Shaw|year=1916|isbn=|location=New York|pages=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Pleasures of Literature'' (1938). [[Judith N. Shklar]] introduces her book ''Ordinary Vices'' (1984), "It is only if we step outside the divinely ruled moral universe that we can really put our minds to the common ills we inflict upon one another each day. That is what Montaigne did and that is why he is the hero of this book. In spirit he is on every one of its pages..."

20th-century literary critic [[Erich Auerbach]] called Montaigne the first modern man. "Among all his contemporaries", writes Auerbach (''Mimesis'', Chapter 12), "he had the clearest conception of the problem of man's self-orientation; that is, the task of making oneself at home in existence without fixed points of support".&lt;ref&gt;Auerbach, Erich, ''Mimesis: Representations of Reality in Western Literature', Princeton UP, 1974, p. 311&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4255">The '''Monad''' in early [[Christian]] [[gnostic]] writings is an adaptation of concepts of the [[Monad (philosophy)|Monad in Greek philosophy]] to Christian gnostic belief systems.

==Overview==
The term ''monad'' comes from the Greek feminine noun ''monas'' ([[nominative]] singular, μονάς), "one unit," where the ending ''-s'' in the nominative form resolves to the ending ''-d'' in [[declension]].&lt;ref&gt;Francis E. Peters Greek Philosophical Terms: A Historical Lexicon 1970 p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some [[gnostic]] systems the Supreme Being is known as the '''Monad''', '''[[Neoplatonism#The One|the One]]''', '''[[The Absolute|the Absolute]]''', '''Aiōn Teleos''' (the  Perfect [[Aeon (Gnosticism)|Aeon]], {{lang|grc|αἰών τέλεος}}), '''Bythos''' (Depth or Profundity, {{lang|grc|Βυθός}}), '''Proarchē''' (Before the Beginning, προαρχή), '''Hē Archē''' (The Beginning, {{lang|grc|ἡ ἀρχή}}), the '''Ineffable Parent''', and/or the '''primal Father'''. 

Prominent Christian gnostics like [[Valentinus (Gnostic)|Valentinus]] taught that the Monad is the high source of the [[Pleroma]], the region of light constituting "the fullness of the Godhead." Through a process of [[Emanationism|emanation]], various divine entities and realms emerge from the One. Arranged hierarchically, they become progressively degraded due to their remoteness from the Father. The various emanations of the One, totaling thirty in number (or 365, according to [[Basilides]]), are called [[Aeon (Gnosticism)|Aeon]]s. Among them exist [[Jesus|Christ]] (who resides close to the Father) and the lowest emanation, [[Sophia (Gnosticism)|Sophia (wisdom)]], whose fall results in the creation of the material world.&lt;ref&gt;Louis P. Pojman, "Valentinus," in ''The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy'', 3rd ed., ed. Robert Audi.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Theodoret]]'s book on heresies (''Haereticarum Fabularum Compendium'' i.18), the Arab Christian [[Monoimus]] (c. 150-210) used the term Monad to mean the highest [[god]] that created lesser [[deity|gods]], or elements (similar to Aeons). In some versions of Christian gnosticism, especially those deriving from Valentinius, a lesser deity known as the [[Demiurge]] had a role in the creation of the material world separate from the Monad. In these forms of gnosticism, the God of the [[Old Testament]], [[God in Judaism|Yahweh]], is often considered to have been the Demiurge, not the Monad,&lt;ref&gt;Louis P. Pojman, "gnosticism," in ''The Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy'', 3rd ed., ed. Robert Audi.&lt;/ref&gt; or sometimes different passages are interpreted as referring to each.

==Historical background==
According to [[Hippolytus (writer)|Hippolytus]], this view was inspired by the [[Pythagoreanism|Pythagoreans]], for whom the first existing thing was [[Monad (Greek philosophy)|the Monad]], which begat the [[Dyad (Greek philosophy)|dyad]], which begat the [[number]]s, which begat the [[Point (geometry)|point]], begetting [[line (geometry)|line]]s, and so on.&lt;ref&gt;[[Diogenes Laertius]], ''[[Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Pythagorean and [[Platonism|Platonic]] philosophers like [[Plotinus]] and [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]] condemned the "[[gnosis]]" that would later characterize Gnostic systems for their treatment of the Monad or One (see [[Neoplatonism and Gnosticism]]).

For a long time, legend persisted that a young man by the name of [[Epiphanes (gnostic)|Epiphanes]], who died at the age of 17, was the leader of Monadic Gnosticism. However, scholars think the legend may have come from misunderstanding of the Greek word ''epiphanēs'' which may have been mistaken as a personal name if in text, when in fact the Greek means ''distinguished'', as in a ''distinguished teacher.''&lt;ref&gt;Mead, G.R.S. 1900. [http://www.gnosis.org/library/grs-mead/fragments_faith_forgotten/fff34.htm ''"Epiphanes'', Fragments of a Faith Forgotten'', pp. 232-235], available online by The Gnostic Society Library.&lt;/ref&gt;

The focus is on [[ethics|ethical considerations]] in neuroscience research and the many ethical issues that arise from the transfer of neuroscience to [[health care]].

== Research themes  ==
The Neuroethics research unit pursues research within the fields of public and [[intercultural]], clinical, research, reflexive, or theoretical neuroethics to address a large spectrum of challenges in [[neurological]] and [[psychiatric]] care such as providing quality patient information, diminishing [[Social stigma|stigma]], and promoting respectful healthcare services. The Unit’s research themes cover subjects as diverse as [[MRI]], [[End-of-life care|end-of-life decision making]], [[cognitive enhancement]], [[policy|ethical policy]], etc.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ircm.qc.ca/LARECHERCHE/axes/neuro/neuroethique/pages/projets.asp&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2014/05/140522133404.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

== Funding ==
Research projects of the Neuroethics Research Unit are funded by the [http://www.frsq.gouv.qc.ca/fr/index.shtml/ Fonds de recherche du Québec – Santé], the [[Canadian Institutes of Health Research]], the [[Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada]] and the [[Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2014-05/idrc-wib052214.php&lt;/ref&gt;

== Outreach ==
In June 2007, at the annual meeting of the [http://www.bioethics.ca/ Canadian Bioethics Society (CBS)] held in [[Toronto]], over 70 attendees met to discuss the need to learn more about Canadian and international advances in neuroethics including research, funding, and events. A new interest group was launched, [http://www.ircm.qc.ca/LARECHERCHE/AXES/NEURO/NEUROETHIQUE/PAGES/GROUPE.ASPX?PFLG=1033&amp;lan=1033/ The Canadian Neuroethics Interest Group (CNIG)].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bioethics.ca/about/affiliates/neuro.html |title=Canadian Bioethics Society - Neuroethics/Mental Health |publisher=Bioethics.ca |date= |accessdate=2014-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the group’s strongest recommendations was to create a newsletter, featuring forthcoming events and literature updates. BRAINSTORM&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ircm.qc.ca/LARECHERCHE/AXES/NEURO/NEUROETHIQUE/PAGES/GROUPE.ASPX?PFLG=1036&amp;lan=1036 |title=Groupe canadien d’intérêt en neuroéthique – Neuroéthique |publisher=Ircm.qc.ca |date= |accessdate=2014-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; was born. Published by the Neuroethics Research Unit team at the Institut de recherches cliniques de Montréal (IRCM), the newsletter provides state-of-the art updates on events, funding, education, literature, resources, and news in neuroethics.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ircm.qc.ca/LARECHERCHE/axes/neuro/neuroethique/Documents/The%20Brainstorm%2001%2004%2014%20Vol%207%2006.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The Unit also created the Montreal Neuroethics Network. Its main goal is to organize neuroethics talks, [[seminars]], [[workshops]] and [[Academic conference|symposia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mcgill.ca/channels/category/tags/montreal-neuroethics-network |title=Montreal Neuroethics Network &amp;#124; Channels - McGill University |publisher=Mcgill.ca |date= |accessdate=2014-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://philomtl.wordpress.com/tag/neuroethics |title=neuroethics &amp;#124; PHILO.MTL |publisher=Philomtl.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bioethiqueonline.ca/en/archives/3499 |title=Printemps 2013 : Séminaires de Neuroéthique, IRCM - BioéthiqueOnline |publisher=Bioethiqueonline.ca |date=2013-03-21 |accessdate=2014-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=&amp;nbsp; |url=http://permalink.gmane.org/gmane.science.philosophy.region.europe/6552 |title=SPECIAL SEMINAR: The neuroscience and epistemology of emphatic cruelty |publisher=Permalink.gmane.org |date=2013-11-06 |accessdate=2014-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Montreal]] to develop neuroethics in Montreal in both [[Academia]] and in the community.

'''Neuroheuristics''' (or '''Neuristics''') studies the dynamic relations between the complex knowledge acquired by [[neuroscience]] by means of an approach not reducible in an expertise since it is continuously renewed at every stage of progress towards scientific discovery.

==Etymology==
The word comes from the Greek νεύρον ([[neuron]], which refers to the nerve cell&lt;ref name="Neuron"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/410669/neuron|title=Neuron |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica }}&lt;/ref&gt;) and εύρισκω ("euriskein" [[heuristic]], which refers to a [[problem-solving]] procedure that is often characterized by its informal, intuitive and speculative features&lt;ref name="Heuristics"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/593468/thought/275926/Structures-of-problems|title=Structure of problems in thought |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica }}&lt;/ref&gt;).

==Paradigm==
Neuroheuristics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Neuro Heuristic paradigm |publisher=Neuroheuristic Research Group  | url=http://neuroheuristic.org/nhrg/docs/def/NHparadigm.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; defines a [[scientific paradigm]] aimed to develop strategies that can be enabled to understand brain and mind following subsequent problems emerging from [[transdisciplinary studies]] including [[philosophy]], [[psychology]], [[neuroscience]], [[pharmacology]], [[physics]], [[artificial intelligence]], [[engineering]], [[computer science]], [[economics]] and [[mathematics]].

The neuroheuristic paradigm was presented for the first time at the conference ''Entrer dans le XXIe siècle : de l'apoptose à la métamorphose'', held in 1994 at the Centro Stefano Franscini [[Monte Verità]], under the auspice of the XV Videart Festival Locarno.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.davel.vd.ch/qfpdavel/0/D3963.pdf|title=Vers un nouveau paradigme en neurosciences|publisher=Archives cantonales vaudoises, document reference PP 525/806.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=June 2015}}

The research framework introduced by the neuroheuristic paradigm appears as an essential step for the investigation of the information processing effected by the brain because it is the outcome of [[nature and nurture]], at the crossing of [[top-down and bottom-up design]].

The neurobiologists apply a "bottom-up" research strategy in their studies. This strategy seems to prove necessary and sufficient to understand a brain in its entirety after the impressive achievements in studying the entire nervous system of a simple model organism, such as ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=A database featuring behavioral and structural anatomy of ''Caenorhabditis elegans''|url=http://www.wormatlas.org/hermaphrodite/nervous/Neuroframeset.html}} {{cite web |title=Specification of the nervous system of ''C. elegans''| url=http://www.wormbook.org/chapters/www_specnervsys/specnervsys.html}} {{cite journal |last1=White |first1=J.G. |last2=Southgate |first2=E. |last3=Thomson |first3=J.N. |last4=Brenner |first4=S.|title= The Structure of the Nervous System of the Nematode ''Caenorhabditis elegans'' |journal= Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B |volume=314 |issue=1165 |pages=1–340 |year=1986 |doi=10.1098/rstb.1986.0056 |pmid=22462104}} {{cite news|last=Jabr|first=Ferris|title=The Connectome Debate: Is Mapping the Mind of a Worm Worth It?|url=http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=c-elegans-connectome|newspaper=Scientific American}}&lt;/ref&gt; However it is not wholly viable to actual experimentation considering the impossibility of simultaneously examining all cellular elements of the brain and all variables that affect those elements.

The "top-down" strategy with the assistance of [[black box theory]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Botterill|first1=George|last2=Carruthers|first2=Peter|title=The Philosophy of Psychology|year=1999|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521559157|url=http://www.cambridge.org/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=9780511037986}} {{cite journal|last=Von Hilgers| first=Philipp| title=The History of the Black Box: The Clash of a Thing and its Concept| journal=Cultural Politics| year=2011| volume=7| issue=1| pages=41–58| url=http://culturalpolitics.dukejournals.org/content/7/1/41.abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;  appears easier to bring to fulfillment but insufficient and irrelevant in understanding the mechanisms coordinating the local networks of cellular elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Burke|first=Robert E.|title=Sir Charles Sherrington's the integrative action of the nervous system: a centenary appreciation|journal=Brain|year=2007|volume=130|issue=4|pages=887–894|doi=10.1093/brain/awm022|pmid=17438014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The ''neuroheuristic'' (or ''neuristic'') paradigm offers as a needed and possible distinct approach to the study of brain and mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Taylor|first1=John G.|last2=Villa|first2=Alessandro E.P.|title=The "Conscious I": A Neuroheuristic Approach to the Mind| year=2001| volume=3| series=Frontiers of Life| pages=349–368| isbn=9780120773404 | url=http://neuroheuristic.org/nhrg/msps/_01cftv.zip }} {{cite journal| last=Villa| first=Alessandro E.P.| title=Neuroheuristics, a new paradigm in neuroscience|journal=Rev Med Suisse Romande| year=2000| volume=120| issue=9| pages=743–748| pmid=11094540 |url=http://neuroheuristic.org/nhrg/msps/_00v1.zip }} {{cite journal|last=Villa|first=Alessandro E.P.|title=Neural Coding in the Neuroheuristic Perspective| year=2008| volume=1| series=Biosemiotics| pages=357–377| doi=10.1007/978-1-4020-6340-4_16}} {{cite journal|last1=Villa|first1=Alessandro E.P.|last2=Missonnier|first2=Pascal|last3=Lintas|first3=Alessandra|title=Neuroheuristics of Decision Making: From Neuronal Activity to EEG |year=2012| volume=28| series=Intelligent Systems Reference Library |pages=159–194| doi=10.1007/978-3-642-24647-0_7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In this framework, a "result" cannot be simply positive or negative because the process itself cannot be reduced to proficiency as such. Dynamics is an essential feature of the neuroheuristic paradigm, but it cannot be merely considered as the neurobiological facet of [[holism]] as opposed to [[reductionism]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3688">In the [[applied sciences]], '''normative science''' is a type of information that is developed, presented, or interpreted based on an assumed, usually unstated, preference for a particular policy or class of policies.&lt;ref&gt;Lackey, Robert T. (2004).  [http://fw.oregonstate.edu/system/files/u2937/2004c%20-%20Normative%20Science%20-%20Reprint%20-%20Lackey.pdf Normative Science], Fisheries, American Fisheries Society.  29(7): 38-39.&lt;/ref&gt;  Regular or traditional [[science]] does not presuppose a [[policy]] preference, but normative science, by definition, does.&lt;ref&gt;Ooms, Gorik.

BMC International Health and Human Rights. 14: 36.&lt;/ref&gt;  Common examples of such policy preferences are arguments that pristine [[ecosystems]] are preferable to human altered ones, that native species are preferable to nonnative species, and that higher [[biodiversity]] is preferable to lower biodiversity.&lt;ref&gt;Lackey, Robert T. (2007). [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1523-1739.2006.00639.x/abstract;jsessionid=1E4F2F827867D075DD43D28821A08A13.d03t03?systemMessage=Wiley+Online+Library+will+be+disrupted+3+Dec+from+10-12+GMT+for+monthly+maintenance Science, scientists, and policy advocacy].

In more general philosophical terms, normative science is a form of [[inquiry]], typically involving a community of inquiry and its accumulated body of provisional knowledge, that seeks to discover good ways of achieving recognized aims, ends, goals, objectives, or purposes.&lt;ref&gt;Sabine, George H. (1912). [https://archive.org/details/jstor-2177252 Descriptive and normative sciences]. The Philosophical Review. 21(4): 433-450.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brueckner, Martin and Pierre Horwitz. (2005).

Peirce Society. 48(3): 310-334.&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, when presented as scientific information, words such as [[ecosystem health]], [[biological integrity]], and [[environmental degradation]] are typically examples of normative science because they each presuppose a policy preference and are therefore a type of [[policy advocacy]].&lt;ref&gt;Landis, Wayne G.

On the Catholic version of the distinction, the natural provision of life necessities, such as food, air, and water, is an example of ordinary care, although it does not exhaust ordinary care, since easily performed [[medical procedure]]s (that do not impose an undue burden on patient and community) will also be ordinary care.

In [[philosophy]], '''panpsychism''' is the view that consciousness, mind, or soul ([[wikt:psyche#English|psyche]]) is a universal and primordial feature of all things. Panpsychists see themselves as minds in a world of mind.

Panpsychism is one of the oldest philosophical theories, and has been ascribed to philosophers like [[Thales]], [[Parmenides]], [[Plato]], [[Averroes]], [[Spinoza]], [[Leibniz]], and [[William James]]. Panpsychism can also be seen in ancient philosophies such as [[Stoicism]], [[Taoism]], [[Vedanta]] and [[Mahayana Buddhism]]. During the 19th century, panpsychism was the default theory in [[philosophy of mind]], but it saw a decline during the middle years of the 20th century with the rise of [[logical positivism]].&lt;ref name= Seager /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/is-consciousness-universal/ | title = Is Consciousness Universal | first = Christof | last = Koch | publisher = Scientific American | date = 2014-01-01 | accessdate = 2009-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The recent interest in the [[hard problem of consciousness]] has revived interest in panpsychism.&lt;ref name= Seager /&gt;

==Etymology==
The term "panpsychism" has its origins with the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] term ''pan'' ([[wikt:πᾶν|πᾶν]] : "all, everything, whole") and ''psyche'' ([[wikt:ψυχή|ψυχή]]: "soul, mind") as the unifying center of the mental life of us humans and other living creatures."&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, D.S. ''Panpsychism: Past and Recent Selected Readings''. [[State University of New York Press]], 2004, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Psyche comes from the Greek word ψύχω (''psukhō'', "I blow") and can mean life, soul, mind, spirit, heart and 'life-breath'. The use of ''psyche'' is controversial due to it being synonymous with ''soul'', a term usually taken to have some sort of supernatural quality; more common terms now found in the literature include [[mind]], [[mental properties]], mental aspect, and [[experience]].

==Terminology== 
Panpsychists like [[David Chalmers]] subscribe to a distinction between microphenomenal experiences, the experiences of [[microphysics|microphysical]] entities and macrophenomenal, the experiences other entities like humans.&lt;ref&gt;"The Combination Problem for Pansychism" by David Chalmers&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Ancient philosophy===
[[Image:Meotoiwa.jpg|thumb|right|Two ''[[Iwakura (Shinto)#Iwakura|iwakura]]'' — a rock where a [[kami]] or spirit is said to reside in the religion of [[Shinto]].]]
Early forms of panpsychism can be found in pre-modern [[animistic]] beliefs in religions such as [[Shinto]], [[Taoism]], [[Paganism]] and [[shamanism]]. Panpsychist views are also a staple theme in [[pre-Socratic]] [[Greek philosophy]].&lt;ref name= Seager&gt;Seager, William and Allen-Hermanson, Sean. "[http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2012/entries/panpsychism/ Panpsychism]". The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2012 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Aristotle]], [[Thales]] (c. 624 – 545 BCE) the first Greek philosopher, posited a theory which held "that everything is full of gods."&lt;ref&gt;''[[De Anima]]'' 411a7–8.&lt;/ref&gt;  Thales believed that this was demonstrated by magnets. This has been interpreted as a panpsychist doctrine.&lt;ref name= Seager /&gt; Other Greek thinkers that have been associated with Panpsychism include [[Anaxagoras]] (who saw the underlying principle or [[arche]] as [[nous]] or mind), [[Anaximenes of Miletus|Anaximenes]] (who saw the [[arche]] as [[pneuma]] or spirit) and [[Heraclitus]] (who said "The thinking faculty is common to all").&lt;ref name= Skrbina&gt;Skrbina, David. Panpsychism, Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Plato]] argues for Panpsychism in his ''[[Sophist (dialogue)|Sophist]]'', in which he writes that all things participate in the [[Platonic form|form]] of Being and that it must have a psychic aspect of mind and soul (psyche).&lt;ref name= Skrbina /&gt; In the [[Philebus]] and [[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]], [[Plato]] argues for the idea of a world soul or [[anima mundi]]. According to [[Plato]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt; This world is indeed a living being endowed with a soul and intelligence ... a single visible living entity containing all other living entities, which by their nature are all related.&lt;ref&gt;[[Plato]], [[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]], 29/30; 4th century [[BCE]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Stoicism]] developed a cosmology which held that the natural world was infused with a divine fiery essence called [[Pneuma (Stoic)|Pneuma]], which was directed by a universal intelligence called [[Logos]]. The relationship of the individual Logos of beings with the universal Logos was a central concern of the Roman Stoic [[Marcus Aurelius]]. The [[Stoic physics|Metaphysics of Stoicism]] was based on  [[Hellenistic philosophy|Hellenistic philosophies]] such as [[Neoplatonism]] and [[Gnosticism]] also made use of the Platonic idea of the [[Anima mundi]].

===Renaissance===
[[File:Fotothek df tg 0006450 Theosophie ^ Philosophie ^ Judentum ^ Kabbala ^ Kunst ^ Technik.jpg|thumb|200px|Illustration of the Cosmic order by Robert Fludd, the [[Anima Mundi|World Soul]] is depicted as a woman.]]
After the closing of [[Plato's Academy]] by the Emperor Justinian in 529 CE, [[Neoplatonism]] declined. Though there were mediaeval Christian thinkers who ventured what might be called panpsychist ideas (such as [[John Scotus Eriugena]]), it was not a dominant strain in [[Christianity|Christian]] thought.  In the [[Italian Renaissance]], however, Panpsychism enjoyed something of an intellectual revival, in the thought of figures such as [[Gerolamo Cardano]], [[Bernardino Telesio]], [[Franciscus Patricius|Francesco Patrizi]], [[Giordano Bruno]], and [[Tommaso Campanella]]. Cardano argued for the view that soul or anima was a fundamental part of the world and Patrizi introduced the actual term "panpsychism" into the philosophical vocabulary. According to Giordano Bruno: "There is nothing that does not possess a soul and that has no vital principle."&lt;ref name= Skrbina /&gt; Platonist ideas like the [[anima mundi]] also resurfaced in the work of [[Western esotericism|esoteric]] thinkers like [[Paracelsus]], [[Robert Fludd]] and [[Cornelius Agrippa]].

===Modern philosophy===
In the 17th century, two [[rationalists]] can be said to be panpsychists, [[Baruch Spinoza]] and [[Gottfried Leibniz]].&lt;ref name= Seager /&gt; In Spinoza's monism, the one single infinite and eternal substance is "God, or Nature" (Deus sive Natura) which has the aspects of mind (thought) and matter (extension). Leibniz' view is that there are an infinite number of absolutely simple mental substances called [[monad (philosophy)|monad]]s which make up the fundamental structure of the universe. The Idealist philosophy of [[George Berkeley]] is also a form of pure panpsychism and technically all idealists can be said to be panpsychists by default.&lt;ref name= Seager /&gt;

In the 19th century, Panpsychism was at its zenith. Philosophers like [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], [[Charles Sanders Peirce|C.S Peirce]], [[Josiah Royce]], [[William James]], [[Eduard von Hartmann]], [[F.C.S. Schiller]],  [[Ernst Haeckel]] and [[William Kingdon Clifford]] as well as psychologists like [[Gustav Fechner]], [[Wilhelm Wundt]] and [[Rudolf Hermann Lotze]] all promoted Panpsychist ideas.&lt;ref name= Seager /&gt;

Arthur Schopenhauer argued for a two-sided view of reality which was both [[Will (philosophy)|Will]] and Representation (Vorstellung). According to Schopenhauer: "All ostensible mind can be attributed to matter, but all matter can likewise be attributed to mind".{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

[[Josiah Royce]], the leading American absolute idealist held that reality was a "world self", a conscious being that comprised everything, though he didn't necessarily attribute mental properties to the smallest constituents of mentalistic "systems". The American Pragmatist philosopher [[Charles Sanders Peirce]] espoused a sort of Psycho-physical [[Monism]] in which the universe was suffused with mind which he associated with spontaneity and freedom. Following Pierce, [[William James]] also espoused a form of panpsychism.&lt;ref&gt;Ford, Marcus P. (1981). ''William James: Panpsychist and Metaphysical Realist''. Transactions of the Charles S. Peirce Society, Vol. 17, No. 2. pp. 158-170.&lt;/ref&gt; In his lecture notes, James wrote: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Our only intelligible notion of an object ''in itself'' is that it should be an object ''for itself'', and this lands us in panpsychism and a belief that our physical perceptions are effects on us of 'psychical' realities&lt;ref name= Skrbina /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[File:Dualism-vs-Monism.png|thumb|right|A diagram with neutral monism compared to Cartesian dualism, physicalism and idealism.]]

In 1893, [[Paul Carus]] proposed his own philosophy similar to panpsychism known as 'panbiotism', which he defined as "everything is fraught with life; it contains life; it has the ability to live."&lt;ref&gt;[[David Skrbina|Skrbina, David]]. (2005). ''Panpsychism in the West''. MIT Press. p. 149. {{ISBN|0-262-19522-4}} 
*Carus, Paul. (1893). [https://www.jstor.org/stable/27897062 ''Panpsychism and Panbiotism'']. ''[[The Monist]]''. Vol. 3, No. 2. pp. 234-257.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 20th century, the most significant proponent of the Panpsychist view is arguably [[Alfred North Whitehead]] (1861-1947).&lt;ref name= Seager /&gt; Whitehead's [[ontology]] saw the basic nature of the world as made up of events and the process of their creation and extinction. These elementary events (which he called occasions) are in part mental.&lt;ref name= Seager /&gt; According to Whitehead: "we should conceive mental operations as among the factors which make up the constitution of nature."&lt;ref name= Skrbina /&gt; [[Bertrand Russell]]'s [[neutral monist]] views also tended towards panpsychism.&lt;ref name= Skrbina /&gt;

The psychologist [[Carl Jung]], who is known for his idea of the [[collective unconscious]], wrote that "psyche and matter are contained in one and the same world, and moreover are in continuous contact with one another", and that it was probable that "psyche and matter are two different aspects of one and the same thing".&lt;ref&gt;Orig. source unknown, cited in [[Danah Zohar]] &amp; Ian Marshall, SQ: Connecting with our Spiritual Intelligence, Bloomsbury, 2000, p.&amp;nbsp;81.&lt;/ref&gt; The psychologists [[James Ward (psychologist)|James Ward]] and [[Charles Augustus Strong]] also endorsed variants of panpsychism.&lt;ref&gt;Calvert, Ernest Reid.

[[Sewall Wright]] endorsed a version of panpsychism. He believed that the birth of consciousness was not due to a mysterious property of increasing complexity, but rather an inherent property, therefore implying these properties were in the most elementary particles.&lt;ref&gt;Steffes, David M. (2007). ''Panpsychic Organicism: Sewall Wright's Philosophy for Understanding Complex Genetic Systems''. ''[[Journal of the History of Biology]]''. Vol. 40, No. 2. pp. 327-361.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary===
The panpsychist doctrine has recently been making a comeback in the American [[philosophy of mind]]. Prominent defenders include [[Christian de Quincey]],  [[Leopold Stubenberg]], [[David Ray Griffin]], and [[David Skrbina]].&lt;ref name= Seager /&gt; In 1990, the physicist [[David Bohm]] published a paper named "A New theory of the relationship of mind and matter" promoting a panpsychist theory of consciousness based on Bohm's [[Interpretations of quantum mechanics|interpretation of quantum mechanics]]. Bohm has a number of followers among philosophers of mind both in United States (e.g. [[Quentin Smith]]) and internationally (e.g. [[Paavo Pylkkänen]]). In the United Kingdom the case for panpsychism has been made in recent decades by [[Galen Strawson]],&lt;ref&gt;Strawson, G. (2006) ''Realistic Monism: Why Physicalism Entails Panpsychism''. ''[[Journal of Consciousness Studies]]''. Volume 13, No 10–11, Exeter, Imprint Academic pp. 3–31.&lt;/ref&gt; Gregg Rosenberg and [[Timothy Sprigge]].

In the philosophy of mind, panpsychism is one possible solution to the so-called [[hard problem of consciousness]].&lt;ref&gt;Chalmers, David J. (1995) Facing Up to the Problem of Consciousness, in the Journal of Consciousness Studies 2(3):200-19. Online at http://consc.net/papers/facing.html.&lt;/ref&gt; The doctrine has also been applied in the field of environmental philosophy through the work of Australian philosopher [[Freya Mathews]].&lt;ref&gt;Lucas, Rebecca Garcia. (2005). ''For Love of Matter: A Contemporary Panpsychism by Freya Mathews''. ''[[Environmental Values]]''. Vol. 14, No. 4, pp. 523-524.&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Chalmers]] has provided a sympathetic account of it in ''[[The Conscious Mind]]'' (1996). In addition, neuroscientist [[Christof Koch]] has proposed a "scientifically refined version" of panpsychism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Keim|first1=Brandon|title=A Neuroscientist's Radical Theory of How Networks Become Conscious|journal=Wired|date=November 14, 2013|url=https://www.wired.com/2013/11/christof-koch-panpsychism-consciousness/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arguments for==

===Non-emergentism===
The problems found with [[emergentism]] are often cited by panpsychists as grounds to reject [[physicalism]]. This argument can be traced back to the Ancient Greek philosopher [[Parmenides]], who argued that ''[[ex nihilo nihil fit]]'' — nothing comes from nothing and thus the mental cannot arise from the non-mental.{{dubious|date=November 2018}}

In his 1979 article ''Panpsychism'', [[Thomas Nagel]] tied panpsychism to the failure of emergentism to deal with metaphysical relation: "There are no truly emergent properties of complex systems. All properties of complex systems that are not relations between it and something else derive from the properties of its constituents and their effects on each other when so combined."&lt;ref name= Seager /&gt; Thus he denies that mental properties can arise out of complex relationships between physical matter. Opposing Nagel, emergentist philosophers [[Roberto Mangabeira Unger]] in ''The Religion of The Future'' and [[Alexander Bard]] &amp; [[Jan Söderqvist]] in ''Syntheism - Creating God in The Internet Age'' have argued that the reality of time enables complex systems to have truly emergent (as in irreversible and irreproducible) properties, thereby replacing any need for panpsychism with a chronocentric, strong emergentism.

===Evolutionary===
The most popular empirically based argument for panpsychism stems from [[Darwinism]] and is a form of the non-emergence argument. This argument begins with the assumption that [[evolution]] is a process that creates complex systems out of pre-existing properties but yet cannot make "entirely novel" properties.&lt;ref name= Seager /&gt; [[William Kingdon Clifford]] argued that: 
{{quote|[...] we cannot suppose that so enormous a jump from one creature to another should have occurred at any point in the process of evolution as the introduction of a fact entirely different and absolutely separate from the physical fact. It is impossible for anybody to point out the particular place in the line of descent where that event can be supposed to have taken place. The only thing that we can come to, if we accept the doctrine of evolution at all, is that even in the very lowest organism, even in the Amoeba which swims about in our own blood, there is something or other, inconceivably simple to us, which is of the same nature with our own consciousness [...]&lt;ref&gt;Clifford, W. (1874/1886). "Body and Mind", in Fortnightly Review, December. Reprinted in Lectures and Essays, Leslie Stephen and Frederick Pollock (eds.), London: Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Thomas Nagel===
In his book titled ''Mortal Questions'', [[Thomas Nagel]] defines panpsychism as, "the view that the basic physical constituents of the universe have mental properties,"&lt;ref&gt;Nagel, Thomas. ''Mortal Questions''. [[Cambridge University Press]], 1979, p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt; effectively claiming the panpsychist thesis to be a type of [[property dualism]]. Nagel argues that panpsychism follows from four premises:

::(1) "Material composition", or commitment to [[materialism]].
::(2) "Non-reductionism", or the view that mental properties cannot be reduced to physical properties.
::(3) "Realism" about mental properties.
::(4) "Non-emergence", or the view that "there are no truly emergent properties of complex systems".

Nagel notes that new physical properties are discovered through explanatory inference from known physical properties; following a similar process, mental properties would seem to derive from properties of matter not included under the label of "physical properties", and so they must be additional properties of matter. Also, he argues that, "the demand for an account of how mental states necessarily appear in physical organisms cannot be satisfied by the discovery of uniform correlations between mental states and physical brain states."&lt;ref&gt;Nagel, Thomas. ''Mortal Questions''. [[Cambridge University Press]], 1979, p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Nagel argues mental states are real by appealing to the inexplicability of subjective experience, or [[qualia]], by physical means.

===Quantum physics===
Philosophers such as [[Alfred North Whitehead]] have drawn on the [[Quantum indeterminacy|indeterminacy]] observed by [[Quantum mechanics|quantum physics]] to defend panpsychism. A similar line of argument has been repeated subsequently by a number of thinkers including the physicist [[David Bohm]], anesthesiologist [[Stuart Hameroff]] and philosophers such as [[Quentin Smith]], [[Paavo Pylkkänen]], and [[Shan Gao]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://philpapers.org/rec/GAOAQT|title=A quantum theory of consciousness|last=Gao|first=Shan|website=philpapers.org|date=|publisher=Minds and Machines 18 (1):39-52 (2008)|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The advocates of panpsychist quantum consciousness theories see quantum indeterminacy and informational but non-causal relations between quantum elements as the key to explaining consciousness.&lt;ref name= Seager /&gt; Recent work on this approach has been also undertaken by [[William Lycan]] (1996) and [[Michael Lockwood (philosopher)|Michael Lockwood]] (1991).

===Intrinsic nature===
These arguments are based on the idea that everything must have an intrinsic nature. They argue that while the objects studied by physics are described in a dispositional way, these dispositions must be based on some non-dispositional intrinsic attributes, which Whitehead called the "mysterious reality in the background, intrinsically unknowable".&lt;ref name= Seager /&gt; While we have no way of knowing what these intrinsic attributes are like, we can know the intrinsic nature of conscious experience which possesses irreducible and intrinsic characteristics. [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] argued that while the world appears to us as representation, there must be 'an object that grounds' representation, which he called the 'inner essence' (''das innere Wesen'') and 'natural force' (''Naturkraft''), which lies outside of what our understanding perceives as natural law.&lt;ref&gt;Schopenhauer, A. Der Welt als Wille und Vorstellung. Bk II, § 17.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Philosophers such as [[Galen Strawson]], [[Roger Penrose]] (1989), [[John Searle]] (1991), [[Thomas Nagel]] (1979, 1986, 1999) and [[Noam Chomsky]] (1999) have said that a revolutionary change in physics may be needed to solve the problem of consciousness.&lt;ref name= Seager /&gt; Galen Strawson has also called for a revised "realistic physicalism" arguing that "the experiential considered specifically as such — the portion of reality we have to do with when we consider experiences specifically and solely in respect of the experiential character they have for those who have them as they have them — that 'just is' physical".&lt;ref name= Seager /&gt;

==Arguments against==
One criticism of panpsychism is the simple lack of evidence that the physical entities have any mental attributes. [[John Searle]] states that panpsychism is an "absurd view" and that thermostats lack "enough structure even to be a remote candidate for consciousness" (Searle, 1997, p.&amp;nbsp;48).

[[Physicalism|Physicalists]] also could{{original research inline|date=July 2014}} argue against panpsychism by denying proposition (2) of Nagel's argument. If mental properties are reduced to physical properties of a physical system, then it does not follow that all matter has mental properties: it is in virtue of the structural or functional organization of the physical system that the system can be said to have a mind, not simply that it is made of matter. This is the common [[Functionalism (philosophy of mind)|Functionalist]] position. This view allows for certain man-made systems that are properly organized, such as some computers, to be said to have minds. This may cause problems when (4) is taken into account. Also, [[qualia]] seem to undermine the reduction of mental properties to brain properties.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

Some have argued that the only properties shared by all [[qualia]] are that they are not precisely ''describable'', and thus are of [[indeterminacy (philosophy)|indeterminate]] meaning within any philosophy which relies upon precise definition according to these critics (that is, it tends to presuppose a definition for mentality without describing it in any real detail). The need to define better the terms used within the thesis of panpsychism is recognized by panpsychist David Skrbina,&lt;ref&gt;Skrbina, David. ''Panpsychism in the West. MIT Press, 2005, p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt; and he resorts to asserting some sort of hierarchy of mental terms to be used. This is motivation to argue for panexperientialism rather than panpsychism, since only the most fundamental meaning of mind is what is present in all matter, namely, subjective experience.

The panpsychist answers both these challenges in the same way: we already know what [[qualia]] are through direct, introspective apprehension; and we likewise know what conscious mentality is by virtue of being conscious. For someone like [[Alfred North Whitehead]], third-person description takes second place to the intimate connection between every entity and every other which is, he says, the very fabric of reality. To take a mere ''description'' as having primary reality is to commit the "[[fallacy of misplaced concreteness]]".{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

One response is to separate the [[phenomenal consciousness|phenomenal]], non-cognitive aspects of consciousness—particularly [[qualia]], the essence of the [[hard problem of consciousness]]—from cognition. Thus panpsychism is transformed into panexperientialism.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} However, this strategy  of division generates problems of its own: what is going on causally in the head of someone who is thinking—cognitively of course—about their qualia?{{original research inline|date=July 2014}}

==In relation to other metaphysical positions==

Panpsychism can be understood as related to a number of other metaphysical positions.

===Idealism===
Panpsychism agrees with [[idealism]] that in a sense everything is mental, but whereas idealism treats most things as ''[[mental content]]'' or ideas, panpsychism treats them as ''mind-like'', in some sense, and as having their own reality. Also, in contrast to many forms of idealism, it holds that for all minds, there is a single, external, spatio-temporal world.

In contrast to "idealism", as this term is often used, panpsychism is not a doctrine of the unreality of the spatio-temporal world perceived through the senses, or its reduction to mere "ideas" in the human or divine mind. The constituents of this world are, for panpsychists, just as real as human minds or as any mind.  Indeed, they are minds, though, in large part, of an extremely low, subhuman order. Thus panpsychism is panpsychical realism; realistic both in the sense of admitting the reality of nature, and in the sense of avoiding an exaggerated view of the qualities of its ordinary constituents. "Souls" may be very humble sorts of entities––for example, the soul of a frog––and panpsychists usually suppose that multitudes of units of nature are on a much lower level of psychic life even than that.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anthonyflood.com/hartshornepanpsychism.htm Hartshorne, C. "Pantheism"]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dualism===

Panpsychists and dualists agree that mental properties cannot be reduced to physical properties. The difference is that dualists consider mental and physical properties
to be ''qualitatively'' different, to belong to different categories with virtually nothing in common (for instance, Descartes' characterisation of matter and mind as "extension" and "thought"), whereas panpsychists view
physical properties as lesser ''quantities'' of mental properties. For instance, a panpsychist would interpret the ability of a stone to move under an impact to be a highly diminished form of sensitivity, with no element of volition. This distinction also separates [[dual aspect theory]] from panpsychism: although dual aspect theorists can agree with panpsychists that everything has some mental properties, they also hold that everything has some physical properties, whereas panpsychists hold that physical properties ''are'' (lessened) mental properties.

===Neutral monism===
There are also varieties of [[monism]] that don't presuppose (like materialism and idealism do) that mind and matter are fundamentally separable. An example is [[neutral monism]] first introduced by [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]] and later propounded by [[William James]]. Neutral monism is often coupled with dual aspect  theory which maintains that mental and physical are two perspectives on a reality that is neither mental nor physical. Panpsychism, on the other hand, holds that the physical is the (attenuated) mental.

===Physicalism and materialism===
[[Reductive physicalism]], a form of [[monism]], is normally assumed to be incompatible with panpsychism. [[Materialism]], if held to be distinct from physicalism, is compatible with panpsychism insofar as mental properties are attributed to physical matter, which is the only basic substance.

===Holism===
Panpsychism is related to the more [[holism|holistic]] view that the whole [[Universe]] is an organism that possesses a mind ([[cosmic consciousness]]). It is claimed to be distinct from [[animism]] or [[hylozoism]], which hold that all things have a soul or are alive, respectively. [[Gustav Theodor Fechner]] claimed in "Nanna" and "Zend-Avesta" that the Earth is a living organism whose parts are the people, the animals and the plants.

Panpsychism, as a view that the universe has "[[universal consciousness]]", is shared by some forms of religious thought such as [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophy]], [[pantheism]], [[Cosmotheism (disambiguation)|cosmotheism]], [[non-dualism]], [[new age|new age thought]] and [[panentheism]]. The [[hundredth monkey effect]] exemplifies the threshold for this applied [[cosmic consciousness]]. The [[Tiantai]] Buddhist view is that "when one attains it, all attain it".&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, D.S. ''Panpsychism: Past and Recent Selected Readings''. [[State University of New York Press]], 2004, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hylopathism===
[[Hylopathism]] argues for a similarly universal attribution of sentience to matter. Few writers would advocate a hylopathic materialism, although the idea is not new; it has been formulated as "whatever underlies consciousness in a material sense, i.e., whatever it is about the brain that gives rise to consciousness, must necessarily be present to some degree in any other material thing". A compound state of mind does not consist of compounded psychic atoms. The 
concept of awareness "being in itself" allows for the idea of self-aware matter. Attempts have been made to conceptualize this primitive level of existence prior to associative learning and memory. In the way that the collection of self-aware matter constitutes a cognitive being, the collection of cognitive beings as a conglomerate entity, reﬂects panpsychism. Consciousness was not "nascent" but emergent due to a lack of abandon during the evolution of material awareness.&lt;ref name=Clarke&gt;Clarke, D.S. ''Panpsychism: Past and Recent Selected Readings''. [[State University of New York Press]], 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar ideas have been attributed to Australian philosopher [[David Chalmers]], who assumes that consciousness is a fundamental feature of the Universe, what he refers to as the First Datum in the study of the mind. In the practice of non-reductionism this feature may not be attributable to any base monad but instead radically emergent on the level of physical complexity at which it demonstrates itself. Complex elegance is the further development of awareness that is self-aware. This we can call "post-intelligence" where "intelligence" is simple processing. The element of superiority might be that the post-intelligence is proto-experiential. These phenomenal properties are called "the internal aspects of information".&lt;ref name=Clarke/&gt;{{rp|162–170}}

===Emergentism===
{{Main|Emergentism}}
In [[philosophy]], emergentism is the belief in [[emergence]], particularly as it involves [[consciousness]] and the [[philosophy of mind]], and as it contrasts (or not) with [[reductionism]]. A property of a [[system]] is said to be emergent if it is a new outcome of some other properties of the system and their interaction, while it is itself  different from them.&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, Timothy and Wong, Hong Yu, "Emergent Properties", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Summer 2015 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), URL = &lt;http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2015/entries/properties-emergent/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Emergent properties are not identical with, reducible to, or deducible from the other properties. The different ways in which this independence requirement can be satisfied lead to variant types of emergence.

== Panexperientialism==
Panexperientialism and "panprotoexperientialism" are related concepts. Panexperientialism is associated with the philosophies of [[Charles Hartshorne]] and [[Alfred North Whitehead]], although the term itself was invented by [[David Ray Griffin]] in order to distinguish the [[process philosophy|process philosophical]] view from other varieties of panpsychism.

Whitehead's metaphysics incorporated a scientific worldview similar to [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s [[theory of relativity]] into the development of his philosophical system.  His [[process philosophy]] argues that the fundamental elements of the universe are "occasions of experience," which can together create something as complex as a human being. This experience is not consciousness; there is no mind-body duality under this system, since mind is seen as a particularly developed kind of experience. Whitehead was not a subjective idealist, and while his occasions of experience (or "actual occasions") resemble [[Leibniz]]'s [[Monadology|monads]], they are described as constitutively interrelated. He embraced [[panentheism]], with God encompassing all occasions of experience and yet still transcending them. Whitehead believed that these occasions of experience are the smallest element in the universe—even smaller than [[subatomic particle]]s.

Panprotoexperientialism is a theory found in the works of [[Gregg Rosenberg]]. For his part, process philosopher [[Michel Weber]] argues for a pancreativism.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., his [https://www.academia.edu/279953/Whiteheads_Pancreativism._The_Basics Whitehead's Pancreativism. The Basics] (Foreword by Nicholas Rescher, Frankfurt / Paris, Ontos Verlag, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

The ecological phenomenology carefully developed in the writings of the American cultural ecologist and philosopher, [[David Abram]], is often (and quite appropriately) described as a form of panexperientialism,&lt;ref&gt;Abram, David. ''The Spell of the Sensuous: Perception and Language in a More-than-Human World'', Pantheon, 1996; Vintage 1997: {{ISBN|978-0-679-77639-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Abram, David. ''Becoming Animal: An Earthly Cosmology'', Pantheon, 2010; Vintage 2011: {{ISBN|978-0-375-71369-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; as is the "poetic biology" developed by Abram's close associate, the German biologist [[Andreas Weber (writer)|Andreas Weber]].&lt;ref&gt;see [[Andreas Weber (writer)|Weber, Andreas]] ''The Biology of Wonder" (with a Forward by David Abram), New Society Publishers, 2016: {{ISBN|978-0-86571-799-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cosmopsychism ==
Cosmopsychism is the theory that the cosmos is a proper whole, a unified object that is ontologically prior to its parts. Proponents of cosmopsychism&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Nagasawa|first=Yujin|title=Panpsychism and Priority Cosmopsychism|date=2016-12-29|url=http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199359943.001.0001/acprof-9780199359943-chapter-5|work=Panpsychism|pages=113–129|publisher=Oxford University Press|language=en-US|doi=10.1093/acprof:oso/9780199359943.003.0005|isbn=9780199359943|access-date=2018-11-13|last2=Wager|first2=Khai}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Goff|first=Philip|date=2017-08-24|title=Consciousness and Fundamental Reality|url=http://www.oxfordscholarship.com/view/10.1093/oso/9780190677015.001.0001/oso-9780190677015|journal=Oxford Scholarship Online|language=en-US|doi=10.1093/oso/9780190677015.001.0001}}&lt;/ref&gt; claim that the cosmos as a whole is the fundamental level of reality and that it instantiates consciousness, which is how the view differs from panpsychism, where the claim is usually that the smallest level of reality is fundamental and instantiates consciousness. Accordingly, human consciousness, for example, is merely derivative from the cosmic consciousness.

==In eastern philosophy==
[[File:RyoanJi-Dry garden.jpg|thumb|right|250px|In the art of the [[Japanese rock garden]], the artist must be aware of the rocks' "ishigokoro" ('heart', or 'mind')&lt;ref name=Parks /&gt;]]
According to Graham Parkes: "Most of traditional Chinese, Japanese and Korean philosophy would qualify as panpsychist in nature. For the philosophical schools best known in the west — [[Neo-confucianism]] and [[Japanese Buddhism]] — the world is a dynamic force field of energies known as [[qi]] or bussho ([[Buddha nature]]) and classifiable in western terms as ''psychophysical''." &lt;ref name=Parks&gt;Parks, Graham. The awareness of rocks. Skrbina David, Ed. 'Mind that Abides.' Chapter 17, pg 326.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Advaita Vedanta]], the non-dualistic school of [[Hinduism]], Brahman is the underlying consciousness that is the foundation of all reality.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

===East Asian Buddhism===
&lt;!--Dogen Kigen (1200-53). A *Zen master regarded by the Japanese Soto school as its
spiritual founder, Dogen was a gifted nature poet as well as a profound thinker, whose
ideas about the 'Buddha-nature' of all things would exemplify in the West a religious
*panpsychism.[OCP]--&gt;
According to D. S. Clarke, panpsychist and panexperientialist aspects can be found in the [[Huayan school|Huayan]] and [[Tiantai]] (Jpn. [[Tendai]]) Buddhist doctrines of [[Buddha nature]], which was often attributed to inanimate objects such as lotus flowers and mountains.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, D.S. Panpsychism: past and recent selected readings, pg 39.&lt;/ref&gt; Tiantai patriarch [[Zhanran]] argued that "even non-sentient beings have [[Buddha nature]]."&lt;ref name=Parks /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Who, then, is "animate" and who "inanimate"? Within the assembly of the Lotus, all are present without division. In the case of grass, trees and the soil...whether they merely lift their feet or energetically traverse the long path, they will all reach Nirvana.&lt;ref name=Parks /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Tiantai school was transmitted to Japan by [[Saicho]], who spoke of the "buddha-nature of trees and rocks".&lt;ref name=Parks /&gt;

According to the 9th-century Shingon Buddhist thinker [[Kukai]], the [[Dharmakaya]] is nothing other than the physical universe and natural objects like rocks and stones are included as part of the supreme embodiment of the Buddha.&lt;ref name=Parks /&gt; The [[Soto Zen]] master [[Dogen]] also argued for the universality of [[Buddha nature]]. According to Dogen, "fences, walls, tiles, and pebbles" are also "mind" (心,''shin''). Dogen also argued that "insentient beings expound the teachings" and that the words of the eternal Buddha "are engraved on trees and on rocks . . . in fields and in villages". This is the message of his "Mountains and Waters Sutra" (Sansui kyô).&lt;ref name=Parks /&gt;

===Dzogchen===
According to a common misunderstanding, in the Buddhist [[Dzogchen]] tradition {{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}, particularly Dzogchen [[Semde]] or "mind series" the principal text of which is the [[Kulayarāja Tantra]], there is nothing which is non-sentient, i.e. everything is sentient. Moreover, two of the English scholars that opened the discourse of the [[Bardo]] literature of the [[Nyingma]] Dzogchen tradition, [[Evans-Wentz]] &amp; [[Jung]] (1954, 2000: p.&amp;nbsp;10) specifically with their partial translation and commentary of the ''[[Bardo Thodol]]'' into the English language write of the "One Mind" (Tibetan: sems nyid gcig; Sanskrit: *ekacittatva; *ekacittata; where * denotes a possible Sanskrit back-formation) thus:

{{quote|The One Mind, as Reality, is the Heart which pulsates for ever, sending forth purified the blood-streams of existence, and taking them back again; the Great Breath, the Inscrutable [[Brahman]], the Eternally Unveiled Mystery of the Mysteries of Antiquity, the Goal of all Pilgrimages, the End of all Existence.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Yeeling Evans-Wentz, Carl Gustav Jung (1954, 2000). ''The Tibetan book of the great liberation, or, The method of realizing nirvāṇa through knowing the mind''. Oxford University Press US, 2000. {{ISBN|0-19-513315-3}}, {{ISBN|978-0-19-513315-8}}. Source: [https://books.google.com/books?id=rKFGit9aFssC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_v2_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q=one%20mind&amp;f=false] (accessed: Sunday March 7, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

It should be borne in mind, that Evans-Wentz never studied the Tibetan language and that the lama who did the main translation work for him was of the Gelukpa Sect and is not known to have actually studied or practiced Dzogchen.

According to the translation with commentary, "Self-Liberation Through Seeing with Naked Awareness", by John Myrdhin Reynolds, the phrase, "It is the single nature of mind which encompasses all of Samsara and Nirvana," occurs only once in the text and it refers not to "some sort of [[Neo-Platonic]] hypostasis, a universal ''Nous,'' of which all individual minds are but fragments or appendages", but to the teaching that, "whether one finds oneself in the state of Samsara or in the state of Nirvana, it is the nature of the mind which reflects with awareness all experiences, no matter what may be their nature." This can be found in Appendix I, on pages 80–81. Reynolds elucidates further with the analogy of a mirror. To say that a single mirror can reflect ugliness or beauty, does not constitute an allegation that all ugliness and beauty is one single mirror.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6736">'''Participatory theory''', vision or framework is a [[conceptual framework]] which attempts to bridge the [[subject (philosophy)|subject]]–[[object (philosophy)|object]] distinction. According to [[Jorge Ferrer]], "the kernel of this participatory vision is a turn from [[wikt:intrasubjective|intra-subjective]] experiences to participatory events in our understanding of [[transpersonal]] and spiritual phenomena."&lt;ref&gt;Ferrer, J.N. Revisioning Transpersonal Theory, 2&lt;/ref&gt;

== Participatory epistemology==
A participatory epistemology is a [[epistemology|theory of knowledge]] which holds that [[Meaning (philosophy of language)|meaning]] is [[enaction|enacted]] through the participation of the human mind with the world. Originally proposed by [[Goethe]], it has been discussed extensively by [[cultural historian]] [[Richard Tarnas]].&lt;ref&gt;David Fideler, "Science's Missing Half: Epistemological Pluralism and the Search for an Inclusive Cosmology " in ''Alexandria 5: Cosmology, Philosophy, Myth, and Culture'', 64 [https://books.google.com/books?id=u6YAuI-buqkC&amp;pg=PA64&amp;dq=%22participatory+epistemology%22+tarnas&amp;ei=R_oTS7W5Ioy4Nvme7OoK#v=onepage&amp;q=%22participatory%20epistemology%22%20tarnas&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a participatory epistemology, meaning is neither solely [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] nor solely [[Subject (philosophy)|subjective]]. That is to say that meaning is not, per [[Modernism|modern]] or [[Positivism|positivist]] views, found solely outside of the human mind, in the objective world, waiting to be discovered. Nor, per [[postmodern]] or [[Constructivist epistemology|constructivist]] views, is meaning simply constructed or projected onto an inherently meaningless world by the subjective human mind.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Tarnas, "Epilogue", ''The Passion of the Western Mind: Understanding the Ideas that Have Shaped Our World View''[http://www.gaiamind.org/Tarnas.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Rather, Tarnas argues that meaning is ''enacted'' through the [[Dialectical#Hegelian dialectic|dialectical]] participation of the human mind with the larger meaning of the cosmos. Thus meaning exists ''in potentia'' in the [[cosmos]], but must be articulated by human [[consciousness]] before it exists in actuality.&lt;blockquote&gt;In this view, the essential reality of nature is not separate, self-contained, and complete in itself, so that the human mind can examine it "objectively" and register it from without. Rather, nature's unfolding truth emerges only with the active participation of the human mind. Nature's reality is not merely [[phenomenal]], nor is it independent and objective; rather, it is something that comes into being through the very act of human [[cognition]]. Nature becomes intelligible to itself through the human mind.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Tarnas, "Epilogue", ''The Passion of the Western Mind: Understanding the Ideas that Have Shaped Our World View''[http://www.gaiamind.org/Tarnas.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Tarnas, participatory epistemology is rooted in the thought of [[Goethe]], [[Schiller]], [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph Schelling|Schelling]], [[Hegel]], [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]], [[Ralph Waldo Emerson|Emerson]], and [[Rudolf Steiner]].&lt;ref&gt;Richard Tarnas, ''The Passion of the Western Mind'', 433&lt;/ref&gt;

== The "participatory turn" in transpersonal theory==
In the field of [[transpersonal psychology]], the "participatory turn" endorsed by Jorge Ferrer suggests that transpersonal phenomena are participatory and co-creative events. Ferrer defines these events as "emergences of transpersonal being that can occur not only in the locus of an individual, but also in a relationship, a community, a collective identity or a place." This participatory knowing is multidimensional, and includes all the powers of the human being (body/heart/soul), as understood from a transpersonal framework. Ferrer's vision includes a spiritual reality that is plural and multiple, and a spiritual power that may produce a wide range of revelations and insights, which in turn may be overlapping, or even incompatible.

'''Criticism'''

[[Ken Wilber]] argues that participatory epistemology is limited in its appropriate scope to observing the interior of a subjective plural domain.&lt;ref&gt;Wilber, K. Excerpt D: The Look of a Feeling: The Importance of Post/Structuralism Part I. Overview and Summary to Date&lt;/ref&gt; Ferrer argues that Wilber's criticisms of participatory theory have  [[conflation|conflated]] [[Metaphysical pluralism|pluralism]] with vulgar [[relativism]].&lt;ref&gt;Ferrer, J.N. ''Revisioning transpersonal theory: a participatory vision of human spirituality'', 2002 [[SUNY]] p225 [https://books.google.com/books?id=tSL2mAl4dU8C&amp;pg=PA155&amp;dq=ferrer+wilber+%22participatory+epistemology%22&amp;ei=t_8TS46oHpjQNPHJ2ZQL#v=onepage&amp;q=wilber%20relativism&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Application in psychoanalysis==
Psychoanalyst Robin S. Brown has promoted a participatory perspective in the context of relational psychoanalysis as a means to fostering [[clinical pluralism]].&lt;ref&gt;Brown, R.S. (2016). Spirituality and the Challenge of Clinical Pluralism: Participatory Thinking in Psychotherapeutic Context. ''[[Spirituality in Clinical Practice]]'', 3.3, 187-195.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brown, R.S. (2017). Bridging Worlds: Participatory Thinking in Jungian Context. ''The Journal of Analytical Psychology'', 62.2, 284-304.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brown, R.S. (2017). ''[https://www.routledge.com/Psychoanalysis-Beyond-the-End-of-Metaphysics-Thinking-Towards-the-Post-Relational/Brown/p/book/9781138935181 Psychoanalysis Beyond the End of Metaphysics: Thinking Towards the Post-Relational]''. London &amp; New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; Brown adopts a participatory reading of [[Jungian archetypes]] as a basis from which to theorize [[alterity]] in the clinical situation.

'''Paul Griffiths''' is Professor of Philosophy at the University of Sydney and works primarily in the [[Philosophy of Science]] and more particularly [[Philosophy of Biology]]. Born in England in 1962, he received a B.A. from the University of Cambridge in 1984 and a Ph.D. in philosophy from the Australian National University in 1989 under the supervision of [[Kim Sterelny]]. He taught previously at the University of Pittsburgh, the University of Queensland and the University of Otago. He spends part of each year at the University of Exeter in the Egenis: the Centre for the Study of the Life Sciences. Griffiths is a Fellow of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] and of the [[Australian Academy of the Humanities]].&lt;ref&gt;http://griffithslab.org/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://sydney.edu.au/arts/philosophy/staff/profiles/paul.griffiths.php&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=F-BUztYAAAAJ&amp;hl=fr&amp;oi=sra&lt;/ref&gt;

Griffiths, together with [[Russell Gray]] developed a theoretical perspective on biological development, heredity, and evolution known as [[developmental systems theory]] (DST).&lt;ref name=Griffiths1994&gt;{{cite journal | last = Griffiths | first = Paul | last2 = Gray | first2 = Russell | author2-link = | title = Developmental systems and evolutionary explanation | journal = The Journal of Philosophy | volume = 91 | issue = 6 | pages = 277–304 | date = 1994 | url = http://paulgriffiths.representinggenes.org/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/publications/C1_6.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''perceptual paradox''' illustrates the failure of a theoretical prediction.  [[Theory|Theories]] of [[perception]] are supposed to help a researcher predict what will be perceived when [[sense]]s are stimulated.

A theory usually comprises a [[mathematical model]] (formula),
rules for collecting physical measurements for input into the model,
and rules for collecting physical measurements to which model outputs should map.  When arbitrarily choosing valid input data, the model should reliably generate output data that is indistinguishable from that which is measured in the system being modeled.

Although each theory may be useful for some limited predictions,
theories of vision, hearing, touch, smell, and taste are not typically
reliable for comprehensive modeling of perception based on sensory inputs.  A paradox illustrates where a theoretical prediction fails.
Sometimes, even in the absence of a predictive theory,
the characteristics of perception seem nonsensical.

This page lists some paradoxes and seemingly impossible properties of perception.  When an animal is not named in connection with the discussion, human perception should be assumed since
the majority of perceptual research data applies to humans.

== Terminology ==

;&lt;math&gt;SUN_{white}&lt;/math&gt; light: Normal white sunlight is black-body radiation containing a broad and largely featureless spectrum covering the entire range of human vision.
;&lt;math&gt;RGB_{white}&lt;/math&gt; light: Televisions and computer screens ''fool'' the eye by generating photons of three narrow wavelength bands where the proportion of photons from industry standard (but improperly named) [[RGB color model|R ''(red)'', G ''(green)'', and B ''(blue)'']] sources is known to be perceived as white.

== Definition ==

A [[Perception|perceptual]] [[paradox]], in its purest form is a statement
illustrating the failure of a formula to predict
what we perceive from what our [[sense]]s [[Transducer|transduce]].

{| border="1"
|Example: standard [[information theory]] limits [[spatial frequency]] based [[Hyperacuity (scientific term)|hyperacuity]] to a factor of approximately 4 over the spatial frequency of [[photoreceptor cell]]s.  Yet, reliable scientific journals have published reports of hyperacuity in excess of a factor of 10.
|}

A seemingly nonsensical characteristic is a statement of factual observation
that is sufficiently intractable that no theory has been proposed to account for it.

{| border="1"
|Example: the [[optical path]] in an eye, from the [[cornea]] to the photoreceptors, goes through a non-spherical cornea and lens that refract and non-circular apertures that diffract such that, in a normal eye, the image on the retina for a point-source is an irregular color-fringed, color-eccentric coaxial bullseye-like pattern with many pathological properties, with the central bright feature covering many photoreceptors.&lt;ref name=Roorda&gt;Roorda, A. “A Review of Optics” chapter 2 in Wavefront Customized Visual Correction: The Quest for SuperVision  II. (Macrae, S.M., Krueger, R.R., Applegate, R.A., ed). Slack Inc. Thorofare, NJ (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;  Yet, the point-source is perceived clearly, and can be discriminated from other such points as little distance away as 1/10 the visual angle of a photoreceptor.  According to Roorda, in a "perfect" eye, a foveal cone subtends 30 arcseconds, and the diameter of the central "Airy" disk varies between 10 cones (1mm pupil used for reading) to about 1.5 cones (8mm pupil used during fight/flight response).
|}

== Mathematical modeling ==

One branch of research into [[perception]] attempts to explain
what we perceive by applying formulae to [[Sense|sensory]] inputs
and expecting outputs similar to that which we perceive.
For example: what we measure with our eyes should be predicted
by applying formulae to what we measure with instruments that imitate our eye.

Past researchers have made formulae that predict
some, but not all, perceptual phenomena from their sensory origins.
Modern researchers continue to make formulae to overcome
the shortcomings of earlier formulae.

Some formulae are carefully constructed to mimic
actual structures and functions of sensory mechanisms.
Other formulae are constructed by great leaps of faith
about similarity in mathematical curves.

No perceptual formulae have been raised to the status of "natural law"
in the way that the laws of gravitation and electrical attraction have.
So, perceptual formulae continue to be an active area of development
as scientists strive towards the great insight required of a law.

== History ==

Some [[Nobel laureate]]s have paved the way with clear statements of good practice:

In the preface to his Histology
&lt;ref name=Cajal&gt;Histology of the Nervous System: Spanish edition&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Santiago Ramón y Cajal]]
wrote that "Practitioners will only be able to claim that a valid explanation of a [[Histology|histological observation]] has been provided if three questions can be answered satisfactorily: what is the functional role of the arrangement in the animal; what mechanisms underlie this function; and what sequence of chemical and mechanical events during [[evolution]] and development gave rise to these mechanisms?"

[[Allvar Gullstrand]] described the problems that arise
when approaching the optics of the eye as if they were as predictable as camera optics.

[[Charles Scott Sherrington]], considered the brain to be
the "crowning achievement of the reflex system",
(which can be interpreted as opening all aspects of perception to simple formulae
expressed over complex distributions).

'''Contrast Invariance'''&lt;br /&gt;
Boundaries between brighter and darker areas
appear to remain of constant relative contrast
when the ratio of logarithms of the two intensities
remains constant:

 &lt;math&gt;Contrast \propto \frac{log I_a}{log I_b}&lt;/math&gt;

But the use of logarithms is forbidden
for values that can become zero such as &lt;math&gt;I_a\,&lt;/math&gt;,
and division is forbidden
by values that can become zero such as &lt;math&gt;log I_b\,&lt;/math&gt;.

No published neuroanatomical model predicts the perception
of contrast invariance.

'''10 Decade Transduction'''

'''Local Contrast'''

'''Color Constancy'''&lt;br /&gt;
When observing objects in a scene, colors appears constant.
An apple looks red regardless of where it is viewed.
In bright direct sunshine, under a blue sky with the sun obscured,
during a colorful sunset, under a canopy of green leaves,
and even under most man-made light sources,
the color of the apple remains unchanging.

Color perception appears to be independent of light wavelength.
[[Edwin Land]] demonstrated this by illuminating a room with
two wavelengths of light of approximately 500&amp;nbsp;nm and 520&amp;nbsp;nm
(both improperly called "green").
The room was perceived in full color,
with all colors appearing unattenuated,
like red, orange, yellow, blue, and purple,
despite the absence of photons other than two close to 510&amp;nbsp;nm.
Note that &lt;math&gt;RGB_{white}&lt;/math&gt; light misuses the terminology RGB
since color is a perception and
there are no such things as ''Red'', ''Green'', or ''Blue'' photons.

[[Jerome Lettvin]] wrote an article in the Scientific American
&lt;ref name="Lettvin"&gt;1986 The colors of things, Scientific American, Vol.255.3, pp. 84-91; (with Brou, Philippe, Sciascia, and Linden)&lt;/ref&gt;
illustrating the importance of boundaries and vertices
in the perception of color.

Yet, no published formula predicts the perceived color of objects
in a single image of arbitrary scene illumination.

'''Transverse Chromatic Deaberration'''&lt;br /&gt;
Light that goes through a simple lens such as found in an eye
undergoes refraction, splitting colors.
An &lt;math&gt;RGB_{white}&lt;/math&gt; point-source that is off-center to the eye
projects to a pattern where with color separation along a line radial to
the central axis of the eye.
The color separation can be many photoreceptors wide.

Yet, an &lt;math&gt;RGB_{white}&lt;/math&gt; pixel on a television or computer screen appears white
even when seen sidelong.

No published neuroanatomical model predicts the perception of
the eccentric white pixel.

'''Longitudinal Chromatic Deaberration'''&lt;br /&gt;
As in Transverse Chromatic Deaberration,
color splitting projects also projects the R, G, and B components
of the &lt;math&gt;RGB_{white}&lt;/math&gt; pixel to different focal lengths,
resulting in a bulls-eye-like color distribution of light
even at the center of vision.

No published neuroanatomical model predicts the perception of
the centered white pixel.

'''Spherical Deaberration'''&lt;br /&gt;
Eyes have corneas and lenses that are imperfectly spherical.
This inhomogeneous shape results in a non-circular distribution of photons on the retina.

No published neuroanatomical model predicts the perception of
the non-circularly distributed white pixel.

'''Hyperacuity'''&lt;br /&gt;
People report discrimination much finer than can be predicted
by interpolating sense data between photosensors.
High performing hyperacute vision in some people
has been measured to less than a tenth the radius of a single photoreceptor.
Among measures of hyperacuity are the vernier discrimination of two adjacent lines
and the discrimination of two stars in a night sky.

No published neuroanatomical model predicts the discrimination of
the two white pixels closer together than a single photoreceptor.

'''Pupil Size Inversion'''&lt;br /&gt;
When pupils are narrowed to around 1mm for reading fine print,
the size of the central "Airy" disk increases to a diameter of 10 photoreceptors.
The so-called "blur" is increased for reading.
When pupils are widened for fight/flight response,
the size of the central "Airy" disk decreases to a diameter of about 1.5 photoreceptors.
The so-called "blur" is decreased in anticipation of large movements.

No published neuroanatomical model predicts that discrimination
improves when pupils are narrowed.

'''Pupil Shape Inversion'''&lt;br /&gt;
Eyes have pupils (apertures) that cause diffraction.
A point-source of light is distributed on the retina.
The distribution for a perfectly circular aperture
is known by the name "Airy rings".

Human pupils are rarely perfectly circular.
Cat pupils range from almost circular to a vertical slit.
Goat pupils tend to be horizontal rectangular with rounded corners.
Gecko pupils range from circular, to a slit, to a series of pinholes.
Cuttlefish pupils have complex shapes.

No published neuroanatomical model predicts the perception of
the various pupil shape distributed white pixel.

'''''Praying for Power: Buddhism and the Formation of Gentry Society in Late-Ming China''''' is a history book which explores the relationship between [[Buddhism]] and [[Neo-Confucianism]] during the 17th and 18th centuries in China (the late [[Ming Dynasty]]); [[tourism]] to Chinese Buddhist sites, and the [[patronage]] of Buddhist [[Monastery|monasteries]] in China by Buddhist and Neo-Confucian [[gentry]] during this period.&lt;ref name="ProductDescription"&gt;From the book's own product description. See [https://www.amazon.com/Praying-Power-Formation-Late-Ming-Harvard-Yenching/dp/0674697758 Amazon Books page]&lt;/ref&gt; This [[philanthropy]] allowed these patrons to "publicize [their] [[elite]] [[Social status|status]] outside the state realm" and promoted the growth of a society of gentry.&lt;ref name="ProductDescription"/&gt;

==Synopsis==
''Praying for Power'' is divided into three main sections:

In Part 1, ''"The Culture of Buddhism"'', Brook reviews the development of religious [[philosophy]] and [[politics]] and the new familiarity with, and openness toward, Buddhism, in what was a Confusianism-dominated society.&lt;ref name="AmericanHistoricalReviewStruve"/&gt;

In Part 2, ''"Monastic Patronage'"'', the author investigates the contributions of the new elite class of gentry, made in the form of "land donations; money and materials for building and renovation; exercise of social and political influence to forward and protect [[Monasticism|monastic]] interests; and 'literary patronage,' the composition of admiring poems and essays or the compilation and printing of an institutional history to elevate the prestige of a given monastery."&lt;ref name="AmericanHistoricalReviewStruve"/&gt;

In Part 3, ''"Patronage in Context"'', the author examines in detail patronage by the gentry in three distinct [[Counties of the People's Republic of China#History|counties]]: one poor, "where Buddhist institutions were not well developed"; a second rich, where they flourished; and a third "in peculiar circumstances that allow Brook to highlight the [[Ambiguity|ambiguous]] position of the county [[magistrate]] ''vis-à-vis''&lt;ref name="vis"&gt;''vis-à-vis'': "with regard to" or "in relation to".&lt;/ref&gt; monastic patronage."&lt;ref name="AmericanHistoricalReviewStruve"/&gt;

Writing in the international journal of Sinology ''[[T'oung Pao]]'', Barend J. ter Haar describes ''Praying for Power'' as a "splendid book".&lt;ref name="ToungPaoHaar"&gt;{{cite journal

In ''The [[American Historical Review]]'', Lynn Struve writes that the author "makes a substantial contribution to our understanding of a lamentably neglected subject area: the place of Buddhism in [[Late Imperial China|late-Imperial Chinese]] [[culture]] and [[society]]."&lt;ref name="AmericanHistoricalReviewStruve"&gt;{{cite journal

Mill's sympathetic attitude in this work and in other essays toward contemporary socialism, particularly [[Fourierism]], earned him esteem from the working class as one of their intellectual champions.

==Preface and Preliminary Remarks==
Mill's ''Principles'' were written in a style of prose far flung from the introductory texts of today. Devoid of the mathematical graphs and formulae that were only developed after his death, principally by [[Alfred Marshall]], Mill wrote with the rich tone of grandeur that is found in all his books. His book continued to be used well into the twentieth century as the foundational textbook, for instance in [[Oxford University]] until 1919.

==Book I Production==
;I [http://www.efm.bris.ac.uk/het/mill/book1/bk1ch01 Of the Requisites of Production]
Mill explores the nature of production, beginning with labour and its relationship to nature. He starts by stating, that the "requisites of production are two: labour, and appropriate natural objects." A discussion follows of man's connection to the natural world, and how man must labour to utilise almost anything found in the natural world. He uses a rich array of imagery, from the sewing of cloth, to the turning of wheels and the creation of steam. Man has found a way to harness nature, so that "the muscular action necessary for this is not constantly renewed, but performed once for all, and there is on the whole a great economy of labour." He then turns on the view of who "takes the credit" for industry. "Some writers," he says,

&lt;blockquote&gt;"have raised the question, whether nature gives more assistance to labour in one kind of industry or in another; and have said that in some occupations labour does most, in others nature most. In this, however, there seems much confusion of ideas. The part which nature has in any work of man, is indefinite and incommensurable. It is impossible to decide that in any one thing nature does more than in any other. One cannot even say that labour does less. Less labour may be required; but if that which is required is absolutely indispensable, the result is just as much the product of labour, as of nature. When two conditions are equally necessary for producing the effect at all, it is unmeaning to say that so much of it is produced by one and so much by the other; it is like attempting to decide which half of a pair of scissors has most to do in the act of cutting; or which of the factors, five and six, contributes most to the production of thirty."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He refers to former French Economists and Adam Smith, who thought land rents were higher because there was more nature being provided. In fact, says Mill, the simple answer is that land is scarce, which is what enables greater rent exaction. He mentions that many things are limited in abundance, for instance, Arctic whale fishing, which could not keep supplied the demand. This alludes to an introductory principle of value, that "as soon as there is not so much of the thing to be had, as would be appropriated and used if it could be obtained for asking; the ownership or use of the natural agent acquires an exchangeable value."

;II [http://www.efm.bris.ac.uk/het/mill/book1/bk1ch02 Of Labour as an Agent of Production]

;III [http://www.efm.bris.ac.uk/het/mill/book1/bk1ch03 Of Unproductive Labour]

;IV [http://www.efm.bris.ac.uk/het/mill/book1/bk1ch04 Of Capital]
Capital, says Mill, is "the accumulated stock of the produce of labour". Though its nature is misunderstood. He gives an example of the consumption of food, as opposed to assets allocated for production.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The distinction, then, between Capital and Not-capital, does not lie in the kind of commodities, but in the mind of the capitalist – in his will to employ them for one purpose rather than another; and all property, however ill adapted in itself for the use of labourers, is a part of capital, so soon as it, or the value to be received from it, is set apart for productive reinvestment."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Capital, like labour, can be unemployed, and Mill gives an example of inefficient taxation of productive capital. Then he observes the surplus to living standards created by industrialism.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Finally, that large portion of the productive capital of a country which is employed in paying the wages and salaries of labourers, evidently is not, all of it, strictly and indispensably necessary for production. As much of it as exceeds the actual necessaries of life and health (an excess which in the case of skilled labourers is usually considerable) is not expended in supporting labour, but in remunerating it, and the labourers could wait for this part of their remuneration until the production is completed; it needs not necessarily pre-exist as capital: and if they unfortunately had to forego it altogether, the same amount of production might take place. In order that the whole remuneration of the labourers should be advanced to them in daily or weekly payments, there must exist in advance, and be appropriated to productive use, a greater stock, or capital, than would suffice to carry on the existing extent of production: greater, by whatever amount of remuneration the labourers receive, beyond what the self-interest of a prudent slave-master would assign to his slaves. In truth, it is only after an abundant capital had already been accumulated, that the practice of paying in advance any remuneration of labour beyond a bare subsistence, could possibly have arisen: since whatever is so paid, is not really applied to production, but to the [[Unproductive labor|unproductive]] consumption of productive labourers, indicating a fund for production sufficiently ample to admit of habitually diverting a part of it to a mere convenience."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Book III Exchange==
In his third book, Mill addressed one of the issues left unresolved by [[David Ricardo]]'s theory of [[comparative advantage]], namely to whom the gains of trade were distributed. Mill's answer was that international trade benefited most the country whose demand for goods is most [[elasticity (economics)|elastic]]. It is also in this third book, primarily in Chapter I, that Mill considers communism and socialism as alternatives to capitalism.

==Book IV Influence of the Progress of Society on Production and Distribution==
In his fourth book Mill set out a number of possible future outcomes, rather than predicting one in particular. The first followed the Malthusian line that population grew quicker than supplies, leading to falling wages and rising profits. The second, per Smith, said if capital accumulated faster than population grew then [[real wage]]s would rise. Third, echoing [[David Ricardo]], should capital accumulate and population increase at the same rate, yet technology stay stable, there would be no change in real wages because supply and demand for labour would be the same. However growing populations would require more land use, increasing food production costs and therefore decreasing profits. The fourth alternative was that technology advanced faster than population and capital stock increased. The result would be a prospering economy. Mill felt the third scenario most likely, and he assumed technology advanced would have to end at some point.&lt;ref&gt;Pressman (2006) 45&lt;/ref&gt; But on the prospect of ever intensifying economic activity, Mill was more ambivalent.

&lt;blockquote&gt;"I confess I am not charmed with the ideal of life held out by those who think that the normal state of human beings is that of struggling to get on; that the trampling, crushing, elbowing, and treading on each other's heels, which form the existing type of social life, are the most desirable lot of human kind, or anything but the disagreeable symptoms of one of the phases of industrial progress.&lt;ref&gt;Mill (1871) Book 4, Chapter 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Project SHAD''', an acronym for '''Shipboard Hazard and Defense''', was part of a larger effort called [[Project 112]], which was conducted during the 1960s. '''Project SHAD''' encompassed tests designed to identify U.S. warships' vulnerabilities to attacks with [[chemical|chemical agents]] or [[Biological agent|biological warfare agents]] and to develop procedures to respond to such attacks while maintaining a war-fighting capability.

==History==
{{main|Deseret Test Center|Project 112}}
Project SHAD was part of a larger effort by the Department of Defense called [[Project 112]].  Project 112 was a [[chemical weapons|chemical]] and [[biological weapons]] research, development, and testing project conducted by the [[United States Department of Defense]] and [[CIA]] handled by the [[Deseret Test Center]] and [[United States Army Chemical Materials Agency]] from 1962 to 1973.&lt;ref name=GAO1994&gt;{{cite report |title=Human Experimentation, An Overview on Cold War Era Programs |publisher=General Accounting Office |date=September 28, 1994 |url=http://archive.gao.gov/t2pbat2/152601.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; The project started under [[John F. Kennedy]]'s administration, and was authorized by his [[Secretary of Defense]] [[Robert McNamara]], as part of a total review of the US military. The name of the project refers to its number in the 150 review process.&lt;ref name="Regis2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ed Regis|title=The Biology of Doom: America's Secret Germ Warfare Project|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8HWQ1uzybFwC&amp;pg=PA41|date=1 October 2000|publisher=Henry Holt and Company|isbn=978-0-8050-5765-2|pages=41–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission==
The Shipboard Hazard and Defense Project (SHAD) was a series of tests conducted by the U.S. Department of Defense during the 1960s to determine how well service members aboard military ships could detect and respond to chemical and biological attacks. Dee Dodson Morris of the Army Chemical Corps who coordinated the ongoing investigation, says, "The SHAD tests were intended to show how vulnerable Navy ships were to chemical or biological warfare agents. The objective was to learn how chemical or biological warfare agents would disperse throughout a ship, and to use that information to develop procedures to protect crewmembers and decontaminate ships."&lt;ref name=SHADtests&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mcm.dhhq.health.mil/cb_exposures/project112_shad/shadTests.aspx |title=DoD Releases Information on 1960 tests  |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|date=January 4, 2002 |website=Medical Countermeasures |publisher=Department of Defense |accessdate=April 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  DoD investigators note that over a hundred tests were planned but the lack of test results may indicate that many tests were never actually executed.&lt;ref name=SHADtests/&gt;  134 tests were planned initially, but reportedly, only 46 tests were actually completed.

==Declassification==
Public Law 107–314 required the identification and release of not only Project 112 information to the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|United States Veterans Administration]] but also that of any other projects or tests where a veteran might have been exposed to a [[Weapon of mass destruction|chemical or biological warfare]] agent and directed The Secretary of Defense to work with veterans and veterans service organizations to identify the other projects or tests conducted by the Department of Defense that may have exposed members of the Armed Forces to chemical or biological agents.&lt;ref name="BobStump"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-107publ314/html/PLAW-107publ314.htm |title=107th Congress Public Law 314, BOB STUMP NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2003 |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=December 2, 2002 |website=U.S. Government Printing Office |publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office |accessdate=October 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000 the Department of Defense began the process of declassifying records about the project and according to the U.S. Department of Veteran Affairs, approximately 6,000 U.S. Service members were believed involved in conducting the tests.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publichealth.va.gov/exposures/shad/basics.asp About Project 112 and Project SHAD] US Dept. of Veteran's Affairs&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2002, the Department of Defense began publishing [http://mcm.dhhq.health.mil/cb_exposures/project112_shad/shadfactSheets.aspx a list of fact sheets for each of the tests].

==Identification==
Although many of the roughly 5,500 veterans who took part were aware of the tests, some were involved without their knowledge. 
Certain issues surrounding the test program were not resolved by the passage of the law and the Department of Defense was accused of continuing to withhold documents on Cold War chemical and biological weapons tests that used unsuspecting veterans as "human samplers" after reporting to Congress it had released all medically relevant information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=July 1, 2003 |title=Secrecy Over Cold War WMD Tests |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/secrecy-over-cold-war-wmd-tests/ |location= |publisher= |accessdate=December 19, 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
A [[Government Accounting Office]] May 2004 report, ''Chemical and Biological Defense: DOD Needs to Continue to Collect and Provide Information on Tests and Potentially Exposed Personnel'' indicates that almost all participants who were identified from Project 112 — 94 percent — were from ship-based tests of Project SHAD that comprised only about one-third of the total number of tests conducted.&lt;ref name=GAOII&gt;{{Cite report |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=May 2004 |title=''Chemical and Biological Defense: DOD Needs to Continue to Collect and Provide Information on Tests and Potentially Exposed Personnel'' |url=http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d04410.pdf |publisher=General Accounting Office |page=24 |docket= |accessdate=December 2, 2013 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medical Studies==
Jack Alderson, a retired Navy officer who commanded the Army tugboats told [[CBS News]] that he believes the Pentagon used him and other service members to test weapons and those tests including agents, vaccines, and decontamination products have led to serious medical problems including cancer.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, David, "Retired Navy Officer Seeks Justice", [[CBS News]], June 12, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;
Secrecy agreements can now be ignored by veterans in order to pursue healthcare concerns within the Department of Veterans Affairs.  The V.A. has offered screening programs for veterans who believe they were involved in DoD sponsored tests during their service.  The Institute of Medicine of the National Academies has commissioned studies of Project SHAD participants. The first, ''Long-Term Health Effects of Participation in Project SHAD (Shipboard Hazard and Defense)'' was released in 2007 and found "no clear evidence that specific long-term health effects are associated with participation in Project SHAD."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iom.edu/reports/2007/long-term-health-effects-of-participation-in-project-shad-shipboard-hazard-and-defense.aspx ''Long-Term Health Effects of Participation in Project SHAD (Shipboard Hazard and Defense)'']&lt;/ref&gt;  The second, ''Shipboard Hazard and Defense II (SHAD II)'' by IOM's Medical Follow-up Agency (MFUA) began in 2012 and as of April 2014 is ongoing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iom.edu/activities/veterans/shadii.aspx Institute of Medicine of the National Academies ''Shipboard Hazard and Defense II (SHAD II)'']&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1683">'''Relationship forming''' focuses on the decision-making process leading to a [[Interpersonal relationship|relationship]]. It therefore differs from [[relationship therapy]] which focuses on improving an existing relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Gottman, John (1999). The Seven Principles For Making Marriage Work. UK: Hachette.&lt;/ref&gt;  Put differently, relationship forming is about "making the right choice", while relationship therapy is about "making the choice work". Discontent at failure to achieve such a relationship is on occasion referred to as TFL (true forced loneliness); although some TFLers may have [[life satisfaction]] despite not forming a relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://dustinkmacdonald.com/involuntary-celibacy-causes-treatments/|title=Involuntary Celibacy: Causes and Treatments|last=|first=|date=2016-05-14|work=Dustin K MacDonald|access-date=2018-09-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary of differences==
* Therapy is typically studied and written on by therapists, while relationship forming is studied and written on by intermediaries.
* Therapy has a reactive approach and tries to solve an existing problem, relationship forming has a proactive approach and tries to prevent future problems.
* Therapy focuses on couples that are often in their 30s to 50s, while relationship forming focused on singles who are often younger.

==Early life==
He was the son of [[Anna Lindsay (Scotland)|Anna]] and [[Thomas Martin Lindsay]]. Lindsay was educated from 1887 at the [[Glasgow Academy]], then at the [[University of Glasgow]], where he gained a [[Master of Arts (Scotland)|Master of Arts]] degree in 1899, and lastly at [[University College, Oxford]], where he took a [[Double First]] in 1902.&lt;ref name ="ODNB"&gt;[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/34537?docPos=1 Lindsay, Alexander Dunlop, 1st Baron Lindsay of Birker] in [[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]] (subscription site), accessed 3 July 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
In 1903 he won the Shaw fellowship in moral philosophy at [[Edinburgh University]], as had his father, the first recipient of this award. He was assistant lecturer in philosophy at the [[Victoria University of Manchester]] from 1904–1906, when he was elected a fellow and tutor in philosophy at [[Balliol College, Oxford]].&lt;ref name ="ODNB"/&gt;

During the [[First World War]] he served in France, was mentioned twice in dispatches, and was a [[Lieutenant-colonel]].&lt;ref name ="ODNB"/&gt;

He was [[Professor of Moral Philosophy, Glasgow|Professor of Moral Philosophy]] at the [[University of Glasgow]] (1922–24). He was president of the [[Aristotelian Society]] from 1924 to 1925. In 1924 he became master of Balliol College and became [[Vice-Chancellor]] of the [[University of Oxford]] from 1935–38. He worked with [[Lord Nuffield]] who donated £1m to fund a new physical chemistry laboratory and a postgraduate college for social studies, [[Nuffield College, Oxford]]&lt;ref name ="ODNB"/&gt; in 1937.

At Oxford, Lindsay was a leading figure in the adult education movement. On his retirement from Balliol, in 1949, Lindsay was appointed the first Principal of the University College of North Staffordshire which opened in 1949 and is now [[Keele University]].&lt;ref name ="ODNB"/&gt;

In 1938, Lindsay stood for [[UK Parliament|Parliament]] in the [[Oxford by-election, 1938|Oxford by-election]] as an 'Independent Progressive' on the single issue of opposition to the [[Munich Agreement]], with support from the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] and [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] parties as well as from many [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] including the future [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Ministers]] [[Winston Churchill]], [[Harold Macmillan]] and [[Edward Heath]], but lost to the official Conservative candidate, [[Quintin Hogg, Baron Hailsham of St Marylebone|Quintin Hogg]].

In 1949 Lindsay became the Founding Principal of the University College of North Staffordshire, which opened at Keele Hall in 1950. This unique institution - the first UK University of the 20th Century - tested many of Lindsay's educational principles and reflected the postwar idealism of its day. Known by many as the "Keele Experiment", many of the features of the New Universities of the 1960s were tested at Keele. The University College became the University of Keele in 1962.

==Personal life==
Lindsay married Erica Violet Storr (1877 - 28 May 1962), daughter of Francis Storr, in 1907 and they had two sons and one daughter.&lt;ref name ="ODNB"/&gt;

He was elevated to the peerage on 13 November 1945 as '''Baron Lindsay of Birker''', of Low Ground in the County of Cumberland. He was succeeded in the barony by his eldest son [[Michael Lindsay, 2nd Baron Lindsay of Birker|Michael Francis Morris Lindsay]].

[[File:Scientific law versus Scientific theories.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Scientific theories explain why something happens, whereas Scientific Laws record what happens.]]
The '''laws of science''', also called '''[[scientific law]]s''' or '''scientific principles''', are statements that describe or [[prediction|predict]] a range of [[natural phenomena]].&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|law of nature}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each scientific law is a statement based on [[reproducibility|repeated]] [[experiment]]al [[observation]]s that describes some aspect of the [[Universe]]. The term ''law'' has diverse usage in many cases (approximate, accurate, broad, or narrow [[scientific theory|theories]]) across all fields of [[natural science]] ([[physics]], [[chemistry]], [[biology]], [[geology]], [[astronomy]], etc.). Scientific laws summarize and explain a large collection of facts determined by [[experiment]], and are tested based on their ability to predict the results of future experiments. They are developed either from facts or through [[mathematics]], and are strongly supported by [[Empirical evidence|empirical]] [[evidence]]. It is generally understood that they reflect causal relationships fundamental to reality, and are discovered rather than invented.&lt;ref name="McComas2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=William F. McComas|title=The Language of Science Education: An Expanded Glossary of Key Terms and Concepts in Science Teaching and Learning|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aXzGBAAAQBAJ|date=30 December 2013|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=978-94-6209-497-0|page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Laws reflect scientific knowledge that experiments have repeatedly verified (and never [[Falsifiability|falsified]]). Their accuracy does not change when new theories are worked out, but rather the scope of application, since the equation (if any) representing the law does not change. As with other scientific knowledge, they do not have absolute certainty (as mathematical [[theorems]] or [[Identity (mathematics)|identities]] do), and it is always possible for a law to be overturned by future observations. A law can usually be formulated as one or several statements or [[equation]]s, so that it can be used to predict the outcome of an experiment, given the circumstances of the processes taking place.

Laws differ from [[hypotheses]] and [[postulates]], which are proposed during the [[Scientific method|scientific process]] before and during validation by experiment and observation. [[Hypotheses]] and [[postulates]] are not laws since they have not been verified to the same degree and may not be sufficiently general, although they may lead to the formulation of laws. A law is a more solidified and formal statement, distilled from repeated experiment. Laws are narrower in scope than [[Scientific theory|scientific theories]], which may contain one or several laws.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ncse.com/evolution/education/definitions-fact-theory-law-scientific-work Definitions from the NCSE]&lt;/ref&gt; Science distinguishes a law or theory from facts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://dels.nas.edu/resources/static-assets/materials-based-on-reports/reports-in-brief/role_of_theory_final.pdf | title=The Role of Theory in Advancing 21st Century Biology: Catalyzing Transformative Research |publisher = The National Academy of Sciences |year =2007 |journal=Report in Brief |}}&lt;/ref&gt; Calling a law a [[scientific fact|fact]] is [[ambiguous]], an [[overstatement]], or an [[equivocation]].&lt;ref name=gouldfact&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.stephenjaygould.org/library/gould_fact-and-theory.html | first = Stephen Jay | last = Gould | authorlink = Stephen Jay Gould | title  = Evolution as Fact and Theory | journal = Discover | volume = 2 | issue = 5 | date = 1981-05-01 | pages = 34–37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the nature of a scientific law is a question in [[philosophy]] and although scientific laws describe nature mathematically, scientific laws are practical conclusions reached by the [[scientific method]]; they are intended to be neither laden with [[ontology|ontological]] commitments nor statements of logical [[wikt:absolute#Noun|absolutes]].

According to the [[unity of science]] thesis, ''all'' scientific laws follow fundamentally from physics. Laws which occur in other sciences ultimately follow from [[physical law]]s. Often, from mathematically fundamental viewpoints, [[universal constant]]s emerge from a scientific law.

==Overview==
A scientific law always applies under the same conditions, and implies that there is a causal relationship involving its elements. [[Scientific fact|Factual]] and well-confirmed statements like "Mercury is liquid at standard temperature and pressure" are considered too specific to qualify as scientific laws. A central problem in the [[philosophy of science]], going back to [[David Hume]], is that of distinguishing causal relationships (such as those implied by laws) from principles that arise due to [[constant conjunction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Laws differ from [[scientific theory|scientific theories]] in that they do not posit a mechanism or explanation of phenomena: they are merely distillations of the results of repeated observation. As such, a law is limited in applicability to circumstances resembling those already observed, and may be found false when extrapolated. [[Ohm's law]] only applies to linear networks, [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]] only applies in weak gravitational fields, the early laws of [[aerodynamics]] such as [[Bernoulli's principle]] do not apply in case of [[compressible flow]] such as occurs in [[transonic]] and [[supersonic]] flight, [[Hooke's law]] only applies to [[strain (physics)|strain]] below the [[elastic limit]], etc. These laws remain useful, but only under the conditions where they apply.

Many laws take [[mathematics|mathematical]] forms, and thus can be stated as an equation; for example, the [[law of conservation of energy]] can be written as &lt;math&gt;\Delta E = 0&lt;/math&gt;, where E is the total amount of energy in the universe. Similarly, the [[first law of thermodynamics]] can be written as &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{d}U=\delta Q-\delta W\,&lt;/math&gt;.

The term "scientific law" is traditionally associated with the [[natural sciences]], though the [[social sciences]] also contain laws.&lt;ref name=Ehrenberg&gt;[[Andrew S. C. Ehrenberg]] (1993), "[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v365/n6445/pdf/365385a0.pdf Even the Social Sciences Have Laws]", [[Nature (journal)|Nature]], 365:6445 (30), page 385.{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a scientific law in social sciences is [[Zipf's law]].

Like theories and hypotheses, laws make predictions (specifically, they predict that new observations will conform to the law), and can be [[Falsifiability|falsified]] if they are found in contradiction with new data.

== Conservation laws ==

===Conservation and symmetry===
{{main article|Symmetry (physics)}}

Most significant laws in science are [[conservation laws]]. These fundamental laws follow from homogeneity of space, time and [[phase (waves)|phase]], in other words ''symmetry''.

*'''[[Noether's theorem]]:''' Any quantity which has a continuous differentiable symmetry in the action has an associated conservation law.
* [[Conservation of mass]] was the first law of this type to be understood, since most macroscopic physical processes involving masses, for example collisions of massive particles or fluid flow, provide the apparent belief that mass is conserved. Mass conservation was observed to be true for all chemical reactions. In general this is only approximative, because with the advent of relativity and experiments in nuclear and particle physics: mass can be transformed into energy and vice versa, so mass is not always conserved, but part of the more general conservation of mass-energy.
*'''[[Conservation of energy]]''', '''[[Conservation of momentum|momentum]]''' and '''[[Conservation of angular momentum|angular momentum]]''' for isolated systems can be found to be [[Time translation symmetry|symmetries in time]], translation, and rotation.
*'''[[Conservation of charge]]''' was also realized since charge has never been observed to be created or destroyed, and only found to move from place to place.

===Continuity and transfer===

Conservation laws can be expressed using the general [[continuity equation]] (for a conserved quantity) can be written in differential form as:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t}=-\nabla \cdot \mathbf{J} &lt;/math&gt;

where ρ is some quantity per unit volume, '''J''' is the [[flux]] of that quantity (change in quantity per unit time per unit area). Intuitively, the [[divergence]] (denoted ∇•) of a [[vector field]] is a measure of flux diverging radially outwards from a point, so the negative is the amount piling up at a point, hence the rate of change of density in a region of space must be the amount of flux leaving or collecting in some region (see main article for details). In the table below, the fluxes, flows for various physical quantities in transport, and their associated continuity equations, are collected for comparison.

==Laws of classical mechanics==

===Principle of least action===

{{Main|Principle of least action}}

All of classical mechanics, including [[Newton's laws]], [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrange's equations]], [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamilton's equations]], etc., can be derived from this very simple principle:

:&lt;math&gt; \delta \mathcal{S} = \delta\int_{t_1}^{t_2} L(\mathbf{q}, \mathbf{\dot{q}}, t) dt = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{S} &lt;/math&gt; is the [[action (physics)|action]]; the integral of the [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]]

:&lt;math&gt; L(\mathbf{q}, \mathbf{\dot{q}}, t) = T(\mathbf{\dot{q}}, t)-V(\mathbf{q}, \mathbf{\dot{q}}, t)&lt;/math&gt;

of the physical system between two times ''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The kinetic energy of the system is ''T'' (a function of the rate of change of the [[Configuration space (physics)|configuration]] of the system), and [[potential energy]] is ''V'' (a function of the configuration and its rate of change). The configuration of a system which has ''N'' [[Degrees of freedom (mechanics)|degrees of freedom]] is defined by [[generalized coordinates]] '''q''' = (''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ... ''q&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;'').

There are [[Canonical coordinates|generalized momenta]] conjugate to these coordinates, '''p''' = (''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''p&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;''), where:

:&lt;math&gt;p_i = \frac{\partial L}{\partial \dot{q}_i}&lt;/math&gt;

The action and Lagrangian both contain the dynamics of the system for all times. The term "path" simply refers to a curve traced out by the system in terms of the [[generalized coordinates]] in the [[Configuration space (physics)|configuration space]], i.e. the curve '''q'''(''t''), parameterized by time (see also [[parametric equation]] for this concept).

The action is a ''[[functional (mathematics)|functional]]'' rather than a ''[[function (mathematics)|function]]'', since it depends on the Lagrangian, and the Lagrangian depends on the path '''q'''(''t''), so the action depends on the ''entire'' "shape" of the path for all times (in the time interval from ''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; to ''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Between two instants of time, there are infinitely many paths, but one for which the action is stationary (to the first order) is the true path. The stationary value for the ''entire continuum'' of Lagrangian values corresponding to some path, ''not just one value'' of the Lagrangian, is required (in other words it is ''not'' as simple as "differentiating a function and setting it to zero, then solving the equations to find the points of [[maxima and minima]] etc", rather this idea is applied to the entire "shape" of the function, see [[calculus of variations]] for more details on this procedure).&lt;ref&gt;Feynman Lectures on Physics: Volume 2, R.P. Feynman, R.B. Leighton, M. Sands, Addison-Wesley, 1964, {{isbn|0-201-02117-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notice ''L'' is ''not'' the total energy ''E'' of the system due to the difference, rather than the sum:

:&lt;math&gt;E=T+V&lt;/math&gt;

Kibble, European Physics Series, McGraw-Hill (UK), 1973, {{isbn|0-07-084018-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; general approaches to classical mechanics are summarized below in the order of establishment. They are equivalent formulations, Newton's is very commonly used due to simplicity, but Hamilton's and Lagrange's equations are more general, and their range can extend into other branches of physics with suitable modifications.

'''[[Newton's laws of motion]]'''

They are low-limit solutions to [[theory of relativity|relativity]]. Alternative formulations of Newtonian mechanics are [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]] and [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]] mechanics.

The laws can be summarized by two equations (since the 1st is a special case of the 2nd, zero resultant acceleration):

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F} = \frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{p}}{\mathrm{d}t}, \quad \mathbf{F}_{ij}=-\mathbf{F}_{ji} &lt;/math&gt;

where '''p''' = momentum of body, '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; = force ''on'' body ''i'' ''by'' body ''j'', '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;''ji''&lt;/sub&gt; = force ''on'' body ''j'' ''by'' body ''i''.

For a [[dynamical system]] the two equations (effectively) combine into one:

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\mathrm{d}\mathbf{p}_\mathrm{i}}{\mathrm{d}t} = \mathbf{F}_{E} + \sum_{\mathrm{i} \neq \mathrm{j}} \mathbf{F}_\mathrm{ij} \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

in which '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt; = resultant external force (due to any agent not part of system). Body ''i'' does not exert a force on itself.

==Laws of gravitation and relativity==

===Modern laws===

;[[Special relativity]]

Postulates of special relativity are not "laws" in themselves, but assumptions of their nature in terms of ''relative motion''.

Often two are stated as "the laws of physics are the same in all [[inertial frames]]" and "the [[speed of light]] is constant". However the second is redundant, since the speed of light is predicted by [[Maxwell's equations]]. Essentially there is only one.

The said posulate leads to the [[Lorentz transformations]] – the transformation law between two [[frame of reference]]s moving relative to each other. For any [[4-vector]]

:&lt;math&gt;A' =\Lambda A &lt;/math&gt;

this replaces the [[Galilean transformation]] law from classical mechanics. The Lorentz transformations reduce to the Galilean transformations for low velocities much less than the speed of light ''c''.

The magnitudes of 4-vectors are invariants - ''not'' "conserved", but the same for all inertial frames (i.e. every observer in an inertial frame will agree on the same value), in particular if ''A'' is the [[four-momentum]], the magnitude can derive the famous invariant equation for mass-energy and momentum conservation (see [[invariant mass]]):

:&lt;math&gt; E^2 = (pc)^2 + (mc^2)^2 &lt;/math&gt;

in which the (more famous) [[mass-energy equivalence]] ''E'' = ''mc''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is a special case.

;[[General relativity]]

General relativity is governed by the [[Einstein field equation]]s, which describe the curvature of space-time due to mass-energy equivalent to the gravitational field. Solving the equation for the geometry of space warped due to the mass distribution gives the [[metric tensor]]. Using the geodesic equation, the motion of masses falling along the geodesics can be calculated.

;[[Gravitomagnetism]]

In a relatively flat spacetime due to weak gravitational fields, gravitational analogues of Maxwell's equations can be found; the '''GEM equations''', to describe an analogous ''[[Gravitomagnetism|gravitomagnetic field]]''. They are well established by the theory, and experimental tests form ongoing research.&lt;ref name="Gravitation and Inertia"&gt;Gravitation and Inertia, I. Ciufolini and J.A.

These equations can be modified to include [[magnetic monopole]]s, and are consistent with our observations of monopoles either existing or not existing; if they do not exist, the generalized equations reduce to the ones above, if they do, the equations become fully symmetric in electric and magnetic charges and currents. Indeed, there is a duality transformation where electric and magnetic charges can be "rotated into one another", and still satisfy Maxwell's equations.

These laws were found before the formulation of Maxwell's equations. They are not fundamental, since they can be derived from Maxwell's Equations.

== Laws of quantum mechanics==

Quantum mechanics has its roots in [[postulates of quantum mechanics|postulates]]. This leads to results which are not usually called "laws", but hold the same status, in that all of quantum mechanics follows from them.

One postulate that a particle (or a system of many particles) is described by a [[wavefunction]], and this satisfies a quantum wave equation: namely the [[Schrödinger equation]] (which can be written as a non-relativistic wave equation, or a [[relativistic wave equation]]). Solving this wave equation predicts the time-evolution of the system's behaviour, analogous to solving Newton's laws in classical mechanics.

Other postulates change the idea of physical observables; using [[operators (physics)|quantum operators]]; some measurements can't be made at the same instant of time ([[Uncertainty principle]]s), particles are fundamentally indistinguishable. Another postulate; the [[wavefunction collapse]] postulate, counters the usual idea of a measurement in science.

== Laws of chemistry ==
{{Main|Chemical law}}

'''Chemical laws''' are those [[natural law|laws of nature]] relevant to [[chemistry]]. Historically, observations led to many empirical laws, though now it is known that chemistry has its foundations in [[quantum mechanics]].

;[[Quantitative analysis (chemistry)|Quantitative analysis]]

The most fundamental concept in chemistry is the [[law of conservation of mass]], which states that there is no detectable change in the quantity of matter during an ordinary [[chemical reaction]]. Modern physics shows that it is actually [[energy]] that is conserved, and that [[Mass–energy equivalence|energy and mass are related]]; a concept which becomes important in [[nuclear chemistry]]. [[Conservation of energy]] leads to the important concepts of [[Chemical equilibrium|equilibrium]], [[thermodynamics]], and [[chemical kinetics|kinetics]].

Additional laws of chemistry elaborate on the law of conservation of mass.  [[Joseph Proust]]'s [[law of definite composition]] says that pure chemicals are composed of elements in a definite formulation; we now know that the structural arrangement of these elements is also important.

[[John Dalton|Dalton]]'s [[law of multiple proportions]] says that these chemicals will present themselves in proportions that are small whole numbers (i.e. 1:2 for [[Oxygen]]:[[Hydrogen]] ratio in water); although in many systems (notably [[Biomolecule|biomacromolecules]] and [[minerals]]) the ratios tend to require large numbers, and are frequently represented as a fraction.

More modern laws of chemistry define the relationship between energy and its transformations.

;[[Reaction kinetics]] and [[Chemical equilibrium|equilibria]]

* In equilibrium, molecules exist in mixture defined by the transformations possible on the timescale of the equilibrium, and are in a ratio defined by the intrinsic energy of the molecules—the lower the intrinsic energy, the more abundant the molecule. [[Le Chatelier's principle]] states that the system opposes changes in conditions from equilibrium states, i.e. there is an opposition to change the state of an equilibrium reaction.
* Transforming one structure to another requires the input of energy to cross an energy barrier; this can come from the intrinsic energy of the molecules themselves, or from an external source which will generally accelerate transformations.  The higher the energy barrier, the slower the transformation occurs.
* There is a hypothetical intermediate, or ''transition structure'', that corresponds to the structure at the top of the energy barrier.  The [[Hammond's postulate|Hammond–Leffler postulate]] states that this structure looks most similar to the product or starting material which has intrinsic energy closest to that of the energy barrier.  Stabilizing this hypothetical intermediate through chemical interaction is one way to achieve [[catalysis]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2581">'''Situation semantics''', pioneered  by [[Jon Barwise]] and [[John Perry (philosopher)|John Perry]] in the early 1980s,&lt;ref&gt;[[Jon Barwise]] and [[John Perry (philosopher)|John Perry]], ''Situations and Attitudes'', 1983. MIT Press, {{ISBN|0-262-02189-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; attempts to provide a solid  theoretical foundation for reasoning about common-sense and real world situations, typically in the context of theoretical linguistics, philosophy, or applied [[natural language processing]],

==Barwise and Perry==

Situations, unlike worlds, are not complete in the sense that every proposition or its negation holds in a world. According to ''Situations and Attitudes'', meaning is a relation between a discourse  situation, a connective situation and a described situation. The original theory of ''Situations and Attitudes'' soon ran into foundational difficulties. A reformulation based on [[Peter Aczel]]'s [[non-well-founded set theory]]&lt;ref&gt;Barwise, Jon. 1989. ''The Situation in Logic.'' CSLI Lecture Notes 17. Center for the Study of Language (CSLI)&lt;/ref&gt; was proposed by Barwise before this approach to the subject petered out in the early 1990s.

==HPSG==

Situation semantics is the first semantic theory that was used in [[head-driven phrase structure grammar]] (HPSG).&lt;ref&gt;[[Carl Pollard|Pollard, Carl]] and [[Ivan Sag|Ivan A. Sag]], 1987. ''Information-Based Syntax and Semantics. Vol.&amp;nbsp;1: Fundamentals''. CSLI Lecture Notes&amp;nbsp;13. CSLI, Stanford, CA.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Angelika Kratzer==

Barwise and Perry's system was a top-down approach which foundered on practical issues which were early identified by [[Angelika Kratzer]] and others. She subsequently developed a considerable body of theory bottom-up by addressing a variety of issues in the areas of context dependency in discourse and the syntax-semantics interface.&lt;ref&gt;[http://people.umass.edu/kratzer/ Umass Faculty Member Site with links to corpus]&lt;/ref&gt; Because of its practical nature and ongoing development this body of work "with possible situations as parts of possible
worlds, now has much more influence than Barwise and Perry’s ideas".&lt;ref&gt;[[Barbara Partee]], Reflections of Formal Semanticist as of Feb. 2005, p. 20. February 14, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Somatics''' is a field within [[bodywork (alternative medicine)|bodywork]] and [[movement studies]] which emphasizes [[proprioception|internal physical perception]] and experience. The term is used in movement therapy to signify approaches based on the '''soma''', or "the body as perceived from within,"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://somatics.org/library/htl-wis1.html|title = What is Somatics?|last = Hanna|first = Thomas|date = 1986|journal = Somatics: Magazine-Journal of the Bodily Arts and Sciences|accessdate =17 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Alexander technique]], the [[Feldenkrais Method]], and [[Rolfing]].&lt;ref name="Bresler"&gt;{{cite book | last=Bresler | first=L. | title=International Handbook of Research in Arts Education | publisher=Springer Netherlands | series=Springer International Handbooks of Education | year=2007 | isbn=978-1-4020-2998-1 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nUOJalJZU60C&amp;pg=PA1120 | accessdate=22 June 2016 | page=1120}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[dance]], the term refers to techniques based on the dancer's internal sensation, in contrast with "[[performance|performative]] techniques," such as [[ballet]] or [[modern dance]], which emphasize the external observation of movement by an audience.&lt;ref name="Williamson"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Brodie"/&gt; Somatic techniques may be used in [[bodywork (alternative medicine)|bodywork]], [[psychotherapy]], [[dance]], or [[spiritual practice]]s.

==History==
[[File:Mary Wigman.gif|thumb|left|[[Mary Wigman]], who studied with [[Rudolf von Laban]], was among the choreographers whose body-centric innovations influenced the early development of somatics.&lt;ref name="Eddy"/&gt;]]
The earliest forerunners of modern somatics were traditional [[Asia]]n movement practices, such as [[yoga]].&lt;ref name="Cram" /&gt; Somatic movement in [[Western culture]] can be traced to the turn of the twentieth century.&lt;ref name="Eddy"/&gt; At that time, the increased popularity of [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]] and [[existentialism]] in philosophy led philosophers such as [[John Dewey]] and [[Rudolf Steiner]] to advocate [[experiential learning]]. Meanwhile, choreographers such as [[Isadora Duncan]], [[Rudolf von Laban]], and [[Margaret H'Doubler]] challenged traditional European conceptions of dance, introducing newly expressive and open-ended movement paradigms. Together, these movements set the stage for the first generation of "somatic pioneers".&lt;ref name="Eddy"/&gt;

Early somatic techniques were developed in Germany in the late nineteenth century by [[Elsa Gindler]]&lt;ref&gt;Carola Speads (1978). "Ways to Better Breathing." Healing Arts Press, Rochester. VT. https://books.google.com/books?id=6raSuDun7wcC&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Geuter"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Geuter|first1=Ulfried|last2=Heller|first2=Michael C.|last3=Weaver|first3=Judyth O.|title=Elsa Gindler and her influence on Wilhelm Reich and Body Psychotherapy|journal=Body, Movement &amp; Dance in Psychotherapy – An International Journal for Theory, Research and Practice|volume=5|issue=1|pages=59–73|date=2010|doi=10.1080/17432971003620113}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Heinrich Jacoby Gimmler.&lt;ref name="Eddy"/&gt; Building on their work, the "somatic pioneers" [[Frederick Matthias Alexander]], [[Moshe Feldenkrais]], [[Mabel Elsworth Todd]],&lt;!-- &lt;ref name="Franklin"/&gt; --&gt;&lt;ref name="Fraleigh"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fraleigh|first=S.|title=Moving Consciously: Somatic Transformations through Dance, Yoga, and Touch|publisher=University of Illinois Press|year=2015|isbn=978-0-252-09749-2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z0AoCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA26|accessdate=2016-06-14|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gerda Alexander]],&lt;!-- &lt;ref name="Knaster"/&gt; --&gt; [[Ida Rolf]],&lt;!-- &lt;ref name="Knaster"/&gt; --&gt;&lt;ref name="Claire"&gt;{{cite book|last=Claire|first=Thomas|year=1995|title=Bodywork: What Type of Massage to Get and How to Make the Most of It|publisher=[[William Morrow and Co.]]|pages=40–56|isbn=9781591202325}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Milton Trager]],&lt;!-- &lt;ref name="Fraleigh"/&gt; --&gt;&lt;ref name="Knaster"/&gt; [[Irmgard Bartenieff]],&lt;!-- &lt;ref name="Fraleigh"/&gt; --&gt; and [[Charlotte Selver]]&lt;!-- &lt;ref name="Fraleigh"/&gt; --&gt;&lt;!-- &lt;ref name="Geuter"/&gt; --&gt; were active, primarily in Europe, throughout the early twentieth century.&lt;ref name="Eddy"/&gt; Primarily motivated by injuries of their own, they introduced a variety of techniques intended to help recover from and prevent injury, and to enhance physical awareness.&lt;ref name="Fortin"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Fortin | first=Sylvie | title=Living in Movement: Development of Somatic Practices in Different Cultures | journal=Journal of Dance Education | volume=2 | issue=4 | year=2002 | pages=128–136 | doi=10.1080/15290824.2002.10387221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the twentieth century, the first generation's practices were codified and passed on by their students, some of whom, including [[Anna Halprin]], [[Elaine Summers]], [[Bonnie Bainbridge-Cohen]],&lt;ref name="Eddy"/&gt;, and Lulu Sweigard, went on to establish their own influential schools or styles.&lt;ref name="Franklin"&gt;{{cite book|author=Franklin, Eric.|title='Dynamic Alignment Through Imagery'|year=1996|publisher=Champaign, IL: Human Kinetics|isbn=0-87322-475-2|page=4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CBwV_g8DhEMC}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1970s, American philosopher and movement therapist Thomas Hanna introduced the term "somatics" to describe these related practices collectively.&lt;ref name="Eddy"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Eddy|first=Martha|date=2009|title=A brief history of somatic practices and dance: historical development of the field of somatic education and its relationship to dance|url=http://wellnesscke.net/downloadables/AbriefhistoryofSomaticanddance.pdf |journal=Journal of Dance and Somatic Practices |publisher=Intellect Books|volume=1|issue=1|doi=10.1386/jdsp.1.1.5/1|accessdate=6 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Allison"&gt;{{cite book | last=Allison | first=N. | title=The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Body-mind Disciplines | publisher=Rosen Publishing Group | series=Gale virtual reference library | year=1999 | isbn=978-0-8239-2546-9 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5199jcnbqwEC | accessdate=16 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Towards the end of the century, a trend of "cross-fertilization" emerged, with practitioners combining different "lineages" to form idiosyncratic styles.&lt;ref name="Fortin"/&gt; In recent decades, the field of somatics has grown to include dance forms like [[contact improvisation]] and [[Skinner Releasing Technique]], and has been used in [[occupational therapy]], [[clinical psychology]], and [[education]].&lt;ref name="Allison"/&gt;

==Movement disciplines==

===Traditional practices===
[[File:Stickney Brook Yoga 272.jpg|thumb|size=250px|alt=person in crow pose next to a stream|Yoga combines physical and mental exercises]]
Many traditional [[Asia]]n movement disciplines influenced the Western somatic practices that emerged in the twentieth century.&lt;ref name="Allison" /&gt; The oldest and most widely practiced somatic discipline is [[yoga]], but many others exist.&lt;ref name="Cram"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Eleanor Criswell |editor1-last=Cram|editor1-first=James|chapter=Somatics and Surface Electromyography|title=Cram's Introduction to Surface Electromyography|date=2011|publisher=Jones &amp; Bartlett Learning|isbn=9780763732745|page=193|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RgfX5jXrmzMC&amp;lpg=PA193&amp;dq=somatics&amp;pg=PA193#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=1 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yoga is a group of [[physical exercise|physical]], mental, and [[spirituality|spiritual]] practices which originated in modern-day India before 500 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Samuel |first=Geoffrey |title=The Origins of Yoga and Tantra |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2008 |isbn=978-0-521-69534-3 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JAvrTGrbpf4C}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ultimate goals of yoga are spiritual,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jacobsen|first1=Knut A.|last2=Larson|first2=Gerald James|title=Theory And Practice of Yoga: Essays in Honour of Gerald James Larson|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TDGFFNYvrokC|year=2005|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-14757-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and yoga practice generally involves physically assuming and moving through codified [[asanas]] or body positions. [[Yoga physiology]] describes a system of interconnected bodies, having different but interrelated physical and spiritual properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last= Frawley |first =David |title=Yoga and the Sacred Fire: Self-Realization and Planetary Transformation|page=288|publisher=Lotus Press |date=2004 |isbn=81-208-2746-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of energy flow through corporal [[nadi|channels]] reappears in other somatic forms, including contact improvisation and Qigong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Dills |first=Ann |last2=Albright |first2=Ann Cooper |title=Moving History/Dancing Cultures: A Dance History Reader |publisher=[[Wesleyan University Press]] |date=2001 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pFcVAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA406&amp;dq=energy+flow+contact+improv&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=QktcVMPREamCsQSsvYFw&amp;ved=0CCQQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=energy%20flow%20contact%20improv&amp;f=false |accessdate=7 November 2014 |page=406}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Oh |last2=Butow |last3=Mullan |last4=Clarke |last5=Beale |last6=Pavlakis |last7=Kothe |last8=Lam |last9=Rosenthal |title=Impact of Medical Qigong on quality of life, fatigue, mood and inflammation in cancer patients: a randomized controlled trial |journal=Annals of Oncology |volume=21 |issue=3 |pages=608–614 |publisher=[[Oxford Journals]] |date=31 August 2009 |accessdate=7 November 2014 |url=http://annonc.oxfordjournals.org/content/21/3/608.full |doi=10.1093/annonc/mdp479 |pmid=19880433 |pmc=2826100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Qigong]] and [[tai chi]] are traditional Chinese movement practices that can serve to support somatic practice. They typically involve moving meditation, coordinating slow flowing movement, deep rhythmic breathing, and calm meditative state of mind. They claim to balance and cultivate [[qi]], translated as "life energy".&lt;ref name= "Knaster"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cohen |first=K.

[[Aikido]] is a Japanese martial art that includes internal awareness and an emotional state of non-aggression; some styles emphasize this with separate [[Aikido#Ki|"ki development"]] training.&lt;ref name= "Knaster"/&gt;&lt;ref name = MM/&gt;

=== Exercise practices===
The [[Pilates method]] was originally developed as a somatic form of [[physical fitness]] conditioning in the early 1920s.&lt;ref name="Caldwell" /&gt; However, most contemporary forms of Pilates focus on correct physical technique more than [[proprioception|proprioceptive]] awareness.&lt;ref name="Rouhiainen"/&gt; The method's founder, [[Joseph Pilates]], emphasized the somatic principles of mind-body connection, tracking of proprioceptive observations, and attention to breath.&lt;ref name="Caldwell"&gt;{{cite journal| vauthors=Caldwell K, Adams M, Quin R, Harrison M, Greeson J| title=Pilates, Mindfulness and Somatic Education. | journal=J Dance Somat Pract | year= 2013 | volume= 5 | issue= 2 | pages= 141–153 | pmid=25328542 | doi= 10.1386/jdsp.5.2.141_1| pmc=4198945 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rouhiainen"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Rouhiainen |first=Leena |date=2010 |title=The Evolvement of the Pilates Method and its Relation to the Somatic Field |url=http://www.nordicjournalofdance.com/TheEvolvement.pdf |journal=Nordic Journal of Dance |volume=2 |pages=57–69 |accessdate=17 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dance===
[[File:CIJam.jpg|thumb|size=180px|right|alt=Dancers move freely at a Contact Improvisation "jam"|[[Contact improvisation]] is a somatic style of [[postmodern dance]] ]]

All forms of [[dance]] demand the dancer's close attention to proprioceptive information about the position and motion of each part of the body,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Smitt | first=Myrim Sillevis | last2=Bird | first2=H. A. | title=Measuring and enhancing proprioception in musicians and dancers | journal=Clin Rheumatol | publisher=Springer| volume=32 | issue=4 | year=2013 | pages=469–473 | doi=10.1007/s10067-013-2193-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Bläsing | first=Bettina | last2=Calvo-Merino | first2=Beatriz | last3=Cross | first3=Emily S. | last4=Jola | first4=Corinne | last5=Honisch | first5=Juliane | last6=Stevens | first6=Catherine J. | title=Neurocognitive control in dance perception and performance | journal=Acta Psychologica | publisher=Elsevier | volume=139 | issue=2 | year=2012 | pages=300–308 | doi=10.1016/j.actpsy.2011.12.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but "somatic movement" in dance refers more specifically to techniques whose primary focus is the dancer's personal, physical experience, rather than the audience's visual one.&lt;ref name="Brodie"&gt;{{cite book | last=Brodie | first=J.A. | last2=Lobel | first2=E.E. | title=Dance and Somatics: Mind-Body Principles of Teaching and Performance | publisher=McFarland &amp; Company | year=2012 | isbn=978-0-7864-8958-9 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pCROxt0OUSUC&amp;pg=PA6 | accessdate=16 June 2016 | page=6 |quote=The focus is on the individual experience: how we feel as opposed to how others perceive or how we think we are being perceived.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Williamson"&gt;{{cite book | last=Williamson | first=A. | last2=Batson | first2=G. | last3=Whatley | first3=S. | last4=Weber | first4=R. | title=Dance, Somatics and Spiritualities: Contemporary Sacred Narratives | publisher=Intellect | year=2015 | isbn=978-1-78320-178-5 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V87BCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA252 | accessdate=16 June 2016 | page=252|quote=Somatic Movement is: (a) movement structured around perceptual phenomena, and (b) movement interpreted through perceptual phenomena.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Somatics has been incorporated into dance communities around the world, with variations from country to country due to the history of the field's local introduction as well as broader cultural differences.&lt;ref name="Fortin" /&gt;

====Genres====
Several dance techniques are considered somatic forms. [[Contact improvisation]] is a somatic genre developed by [[Steve Paxton]] and others in the 1970s, which consists of two or more dancers responding organically to the physical sensations generated by their mutual contact. Contact improvisation can be performed for an audience, but is not designed to have any particular visual impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Novac |first=Cynthia Jean |date=1990 |title=Sharing the Dance: Contact Improvisation and American Culture |url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=YNULSI5C580C&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR11&amp;dq=contact+improvisation&amp;ots=shX6xRL9K5&amp;sig=JdBJSKgSP-1B-4L7UtkvjTuqyNo#v=onepage&amp;q=contact%20improvisation&amp;f=false  |publisher=[[University of Wisconsin Press]] |isbn=0-299-12440-1 |accessdate=14 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ruth Zaporah's [[Action Theatre (Ruth Zaporah)|Action Theater]], developed in the 1970s and 1980s, is an improvisational performance technique based on "'embodied presence', a state of awareness in which performers maintain conscious contact with their somatic experience," according to dance scholar Susanna Morrow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Morrow |first=S. |title=Psyche meets Soma: accessing creativity through Ruth Zaporah’s Action Theater. |journal=Theatre, Dance and Performance Training |issue=2 |volume=1 |pages=99–113| doi=10.1080/19443927.2010.543987 |date=2011 |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/19443927.2010.543987?journalCode=rtdp20#.VI5QlYeJnFJ| accessdate=14 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[dance education|dance educators]] use somatic principles and training, especially [[Laban Movement Analysis]], [[Ideokinesis]], Alexander, and Feldenkrais, in performative [[dance technique|technique]] classes.&lt;ref name="Technique"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Eddy 2002"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Eddy | first=Martha Hart | title=Dance and Somatic Inquiry in Studios and Community Dance Programs | journal=Journal of Dance Education | publisher=Informa UK | volume=2 | issue=4 | year=2002 | pages=119–127  | doi=10.1080/15290824.2002.10387220 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These practices are used to train dancers' proprioceptive skills and to adjust alignment, and are claimed to reduce the risk of injury.&lt;ref name="Technique"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Brodie |first=Julie |last2= Lobel |first2=Elin |date=2004 |title=Integrating Fundamental Principles Underlying Somatic Practices into the Dance Technique Class |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/15290824.2004.10387263#.VFupJL6JlFI |journal=Journal of Dance Education |publisher=[[Taylor &amp; Francis]] |volume=4 |issue=3 |pages=80–87 |doi=10.1080/15290824.2004.10387263 |accessdate=6 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Wozny |first=Nancy |date=May 2012 |title=The Somatics Infusion |url=http://www.dancemagazine.com/issues/May-2012/The-Somatics-Infusion |journal=Dance Magazine |publisher=DanceMedia, LLC |accessdate=14 December 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141105145855/http://dancemagazine.com/issues/may-2012/The-Somatics-Infusion |archivedate=5 November 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fortin |first=Sylvie |last2=Long |first2=Warwick |last3=Lord |first3=Madeleine |date=2002 |title=Three Voices: Researching how somatic education informs contemporary dance technique classes |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/1464789022000034712#.VFupI76JlFI |journal= Research in Dance Education |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=155–179 |doi=10.1080/1464789022000034712 |accessdate=6 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Somatic teaching practices are those which build students' awareness of their external environments and internal sensations while dancing. These practices may include making corrections with touch, in addition to verbal instructions; focusing on energy and process, instead of the physical shapes they produce; and deliberately relaxing habitually-overused muscles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nettl-Fiol|first1=Rebecca|last2=Vanier|first2=Luc|title=Dance and the Alexander Technique: Exploring the Missing Link|date=2011|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=9780252077937|page=12|edition=illustrated|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EcqCFdMPIYwC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=Dance%20and%20the%20Alexander%20Technique%3A%20Exploring%20the%20Missing%20Link&amp;pg=PA12#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=28 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Warwick Long claims that using somatics in dance training, by strengthening dancers' knowledge of the ''soma'', makes their technique more "intrinsic, internal and personalised." He claims the direct self-knowledge somatics offers is valuable for today's professional dancers, who are increasingly asked to work outside the structures of canonically codified techniques such as [[ballet]] or [[Graham technique]].&lt;ref name="Warwick"&gt;{{Cite thesis |last=Long |first=Warwick |title=Sensing Difference: Student and Teacher Perceptions on the Integration of the Feldenkrais Method of Somatic Education and Contemporary Dance Technique |type=M.P.Ed. |url=http://iffresearchjournal.org/system/files/Long_2002.pdf |year=2002 |publisher=International Feldenkrais® Federation |accessdate=6 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternative medicine==
Several forms of [[alternative medicine]] consider sensory experience of the body important.

The [[Alexander technique]], an early example of such a practice, was developed by [[Frederick Matthias Alexander]], an [[actor]], in the 1890s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Rootberg | first = Ruth | title = Voice and Gender and other contemporary issues in professional voice and speech training | journal =  Voice and Speech Review | pages = 164–170 |date=September 2007 | issue = 1 | doi =  | volume = 35 | editor= Mandy Rees}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is an educational somatic technique intended to undo students' habits of using unnecessary tension in movement.&lt;ref name= "Knaster"&gt;{{cite book |last= Knaster |first= Mirka |year= 1996 |title= Discovering the Body's Wisdom: A Comprehensive Guide to More Than Fifty Mind-Body Practices |publisher= [[Bantam Books|Bantam]] |pages= 188–245, 326–51 |isbn= 9780307575500}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://alexandertechnique.com/resources/rosenberg.pdf |title=The Alexander Technique and Somatic Education |last=Rosenberg |first=Bobby |accessdate=14 December 2014|quote = "[Alexander's] frequent references to "kinesthesia," "sensory awareness," and "feeling" place him squarely in the center of the field of somatics.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Feldenkrais Method]] is a somatic movement pedagogy developed by [[Moshé Feldenkrais]], inspired in part by the Alexander Technique. It claims to improve well-being by bringing attention to movement patterns which proponents claim are inefficient or unnecessarily tense and replacing them with other patterns.&lt;ref name= "Knaster"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Levine |first= Andrew |year= 1998 |title= The Bodywork and Massage Sourcebook |publisher= [[Lowell House]] |pages= 249–60 |isbn= 9780737300987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Structural Integration]], including [[Rolfing]] and Hellerwork, uses bodywork, [[mindfulness]], and movement retraining as tools for somatic education. Practitioners claim to make both the body and mind more adaptable and resilient, by improving "alignment" and movement.&lt;ref name= "Levine"&gt;{{cite book |last= Levine |first= Andrew |year= 1998 |title= The Bodywork and Massage Sourcebook |publisher= [[Lowell House]] |pages= 209–234 |isbn= 9780737300987}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Behnke|first1=Elizabeth A.|title=Matching|journal=Somatics|date=1998|issue=Spring/Summer 1998|pages=24–32}}, found in {{cite book|editor1-last=Johnson|editor1-first=Don|title=Bone, Breath &amp; Gesture: Practices of Embodiment|date=1995|publisher=North Atlantic Books|isbn=9781556432019|pages=317–338|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iVtdDKqG1uoC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=somatics%20bodywork%20317&amp;pg=PA317#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=28 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Trager Approach|Trager]] uses gentle bodywork and relaxed exercises called Mentastics to explore sensation and effortlessness in movement. Practitioners enter a meditative state and attempt to physically communicate a sense of lightness, curiosity, and playfulness via the practitioner's contact. Mentastics is an exploration of body weight in gravity. 
&lt;ref name= "Stillerman"&gt;{{cite book |last= Stillerman |first= Elaine |year= 2016 |edition= second |title= Modalities for Massage and Bodywork |publisher= [[Mosby (publisher)|Mosby]] |pages= 366–83, 402–14 |isbn= 9780323239318}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some alternative medicine practitioners who work with mental health have a somatic focus. For example, in [[somatic experiencing]], clients learn to monitor internal sensations.&lt;ref name="Levine 97"&gt;Levine, Peter A. with Frederick, Ann: ''Waking the Tiger. Healing Trauma.'' North Atlantic Books, Berkeley, CA, 1997 {{ISBN|1-55643-233-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spiritual practices==
Spiritual discourse within the field of somatics tends to reject [[monotheism|monotheistic]] systems which locate spiritual authority in an external hierarchy, instead sacralizing the direct perception of an internal "life force".&lt;ref name="Williamson2010"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Williamson | first=Amanda | title=Reflections and theoretical approaches to the study of spiritualities within the field of somatic movement dance education | journal=Journal of Dance and Somatic Practices | volume=2 | issue=1 | year=2010 | pages=35–61 | doi=10.1386/jdsp.2.1.35_1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although not strongly aligned with any particular spiritual tradition, somatics literature generally views [[Christianity]] and other monotheistic religions unfavorably and favors an eclectic mix of non-Western approaches to the sacred, including those of [[Buddhism]], [[Taoism]], [[Hinduism]], and various kinds of [[Shamanism]].&lt;ref name="Williamson2010"/&gt;

Some [[spiritual practice]]s, such as [[Sufi whirling]] and [[Buddhism|Buddhist walking meditation]], are particularly associated with somatics.&lt;ref name = MM&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Payne|first1=Peter|last2=Crane-Godreau|first2=Mardi|title=Meditative movement for depression and anxiety|journal=Frontiers in Psychiatry|date=24 July 2013|volume=4|pages=1–14|doi=10.3389/fpsyt.2013.00071|url=http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyt.2013.00071/full|accessdate=8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Holland | first=D. | title=Integrating Mindfulness Meditation and Somatic Awareness into a Public Educational Setting | journal=Journal of Humanistic Psychology | volume=44 | issue=4 | year=2004 | pages=468–484 |doi=10.1177/0022167804266100}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spirituality is a component of the work of [[Bonnie Bainbridge Cohen]], a leader in contemporary somatics who incorporates elements of [[Zen Buddhism]] with [[modern dance]] and [[Laban Movement Analysis]].&lt;ref name="EddyGlobal"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Eddy | first=Martha | title=Somatic Practices and Dance: Global Influences | journal=Dance Research Journal | volume=34 | issue=2 | year=2002 | page=46 | doi=10.2307/1478459}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Sophistical Refutations''''' ({{lang-el|Σοφιστικοὶ Ἔλεγχοι}}; {{lang-la|De Sophisticis Elenchis}}) is a text in [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Organon]]'' in which he identified thirteen [[Fallacy|fallacies]].&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Sometimes listed as twelve.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Aristotle, this is the first work to treat the subject of [[deductive reasoning]]. (''Soph. Ref.'', 34, 183b34 ff.). The fallacies Aristotle identifies are the following:

;Fallacies in the language (''in dictione'')
# [[Equivocation]]
# [[Amphibology]]
# [[Fallacy of composition|Composition]]
# [[Fallacy of division|Division]]

'''Surendranath Dasgupta''' ({{lang-bn|সুরেন্দ্রনাথ দাশগুপ্ত}}) (October 1887 – 18 December 1952) was a [[scholar]] of [[Sanskrit]] and [[philosophy]].

==Family and education==
Dasgupta was born in [[Kushtia District|Kushtia]], [[Bengal]] (now in [[Bangladesh]]) in a Vaidya family. His ancestral home was in the village Goila in [[Barisal District]]. He studied in [[Surendranath College|Ripon College]] [[Calcutta]] and graduated with honours in [[Sanskrit]]. Later, he received his master's degree from [[Sanskrit College]], Calcutta in 1908. He got a second master's degree in Western Philosophy in 1910 from the [[University of Calcutta]].

Prof. Dasgupta married Himani Devi, a beautiful lady and the younger sister of India's pioneer film director and founder of Bombay Talkies [[Himanshu Rai]] and had six children with her. Dasgupta had three daughters [[Maitreyi Devi]] (Sen) (1914-1989), Chitrita Devi (Gupta) and Sumitra Majumdar. Maitreyi Devi and Chitrita Devi (Gupta) were also famous writers. His sons Subhayu Dasgupta, Sugata Dasgupta and Prof. Subhachari Dasgupta also left behind valuable works in nation building.

His last surviving and youngest child Sumitra Majumdar died in Goa in September 2008.

Dasgupta had taken the Griffith Prize in 1916 and his doctorate in Indian Philosophy in 1920. Maharaja Sir Manindra Chandra Nandi now urged him to go to Europe to study European philosophy at its sources, and generously bore all the expenses of his research tour (1920–22).

Dasgupta went to England and distinguished himself at Cambridge as a research student in philosophy under Dr. [[J. M. E. McTaggart]]. During this time the Cambridge University Press published the first volume of the ''History of Indian Philosophy'' (1921). He was also appointed lecturer at Cambridge, and nominated to represent Cambridge University at the International Congress of Philosophy in Paris.

His participation in the debates of the [[Aristotelian Society]], London, the leading philosophical society of England, and of the Moral Science Club, Cambridge, earned for him the reputation of being an almost invincible controversialist. Great teachers of philosophy like Ward and McTaggart, under whom he studied, looked upon him not as their pupil but as their colleague. He received his Cambridge doctorate for an elaborate thesis on contemporary European philosophy.

The impressions that he had made by his speeches and in the debates at the [[Paris Congress]] secured for him an invitation to the International Congress at Naples in 1924, where he was sent as a representative of the Bengal Education Department and of the University of Calcutta ; later on, he was sent on deputation by the Government of Bengal to the International Congress at Harvard in 1926.

In that connection he delivered the Harris Foundation lectures at Chicago, besides a series of lectures at about a dozen other Universities of the United States and at Vienna, where he was presented with an illuminated address and a bronze bust of himself. He was invited in 1925 to the second centenary of the Academy of Science, Leningrad, but he could not attend for lack of Government sanction.

In 1935, 1936 and 1939 he was invited as visiting professor to Rome, Milan, Breslau, Konigsberg, Berlin, Bonn, Cologne, Zurich, Paris, Warsaw and England.

==Career==
{{POV check|talk=Skewed discussion of family life|date=April 2015|section}}
His career in teaching began with a short stint as a Lecturer in [[Rajshahi College]]. Later, he became a Professor of Sanskrit and Bengali in [[Chittagong College]]. After some time, he went back to graduate school and received a PhD from the University of Calcutta, and later went to England to work on his second PhD at the University of Cambridge.

Following his return in 1924, Dasgupta joined the [[Presidency College, Kolkata|Presidency College]] as Professor of Philosophy. Later, he became the Principal of Sanskrit College, and later joined the University of Calcutta as a Professor.

In 1932, he served as President of the [[Indian Philosophical Congress]]. His own philosophy was known as ''Theory of Dependent Emergence''.

The list of his famous students includes scholars like [[Mircea Eliade]] and [[Debiprasad Chattopadhyaya]].

About 1941 or 1942 Dasgupta moved away from his wife Himani Madhuri Dasgupta and their six children, and he stayed with Suramā Mitra (1907 - 12 June 1998), his secretary and student, whom he married in 1945. Suramā Mitra held a PhD in philosophy, taught at Lucknow University, and authored a few books on philosophy. Dasgupta's relationship with Suramā Mitra caused enormous pain to his near ones and was strongly disputed by Dasgupta's family. Whilst Suramā Mitra claimed to be Dasgupta's wife, such claims were unjustifiable and illegal as Surendranath and Himani were never legally divorced and bigamy was a crime in British and Independent India.

The University of Warsaw made him an honorary Fellow of the Academy of Sciences. He was elected Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature. The Societe des Amis du Monde of Paris offered him a special reception, and M. Renou, Professor of Sanskrit in the University of Paris, wrote to him afterwards: " While you were amongst us, we felt as if a Sankara or a Patanjali was born again and moved amongst us." Kind and simple and gentle as he was, Dasgupta was always undaunted in challenging scholars and philosophers.

In the second International Congress of Philosophy in Naples, the thesis of Dasgupta's paper was that the philosophy of [[Benedetto Croce]] (1866-1952) had been largely anticipated by Dharmakirtti and Dharmottara &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dasgupta |first=Dasgupta |year=1941 |title=Philosophical Essays |url=https://archive.org/details/Philosophical.Essays.by.Surendranath.Dasgupta |publisher=University of Calcutta |page=222}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and that where Croce differed, he (Croce) was himself in error. On account of internal differences Croce had no mind to join the Congress, but the fact that Dasgupta was going to challenge his philosophy and prove it to be second-hand in open congress, induced him to do so.

In the same way he challenged [[Louis de La Vallée-Poussin]], the great Buddhist scholar, before a little assembly presided over by J. M. E. McTaggart. In the meetings of the Aristotelian Society Dasgupta was a terror to his opponents, his method of approach being always to point out their
errors. He inflicted this treatment on many other scholars, particularly [[Fyodor Shcherbatskoy]] (Stcherbatsky) (1866-1942) and [[Sylvain Lévi]] (1863-1935).

==A History of Indian Philosophy==
When [[Lawrence Dundas, 2nd Marquess of Zetland|Lord Ronaldshay]], the Governor of Bengal, came to visit Chittagong College, he had a long talk with Professor Dasgupta in his classroom, and was so much impressed by it that he expressed the desire that the first volume of the History of Indian Philosophy might be dedicated to him.

Originally Dasgupta's plan was to write out the history of Indian systems of thought in one volume. Therefore, he tried to condense the materials available within the compass of one book. But as he went on collecting materials from all parts of India, a huge mass of published and unpublished texts came to light, and the plan of the work enlarged more and more as he tried to utilise them.

This was the first and only attempt to write out in a systematic manner a history of Indian thought directly from the original sources in Sanskrit, Pali and Prakrit. In a work of the fourteenth century A.D., the Sarva-darsana-samgraha of Madhavacarya, we find a minor attempt to give a survey of the different philosophical schools of India.

But the account given there is very brief, and the work does not give an exhaustive survey of all the different systems of philosophy. In the present series the author traced, in a historical and critical manner, the development of Indian thought in its different branches from various sources, a considerable portion of which lies in unpublished manuscripts. He spared no pains and underwent a tremendous amount of drudgery in order to unearth the sacred, buried treasures of Indian thought.

He revised his original plan of writing only one volume and thought of completing the task in five consecutive volumes constituting a series. He shouldered this gigantic task
all alone, with the sincerest devotion and unparalleled enthusiasm and zeal.

In 1942 he retired from Sanskrit College and was appointed King George V Professor of Mental and Moral Science in the University of Calcutta. He worked there for three years and delivered the Stephanos Nirmalendu lectures on the history of religions. He had been suffering from heart trouble since 1940, but was still carrying on his various activities and research work.

In 1945 he retired from the Calcutta University and was offered the Professorship of Sanskrit at Edinburgh which had fallen vacant after the death of Professor Keith. The doctors also advised a trip to England. On his arrival in England he fell ill again.

In November 1945 he delivered his last public lecture on Hinduism in Trinity College, Cambridge. Since then he was confined to bed with acute heart trouble. He stayed in England for five years (1945–50). Even then he published the fourth volume of his History of Indian
Philosophy at the Cambridge University Press, the History of Sanskrit Literature at Calcutta University, Rabindranath the Poet and Philosopher with his Calcutta publishers, and a book on aesthetics in Bengali. In 1950 he returned to Lucknow.

In 1951, through friendly help given by Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, he started writing the fifth and final volume of the Historyof Indian Philosophy. He had also planned to write out his own system of philosophy in two volumes. His friends and students requested him  several times to complete the writing of his own first. Yet he looked upon his work on Indian philosophy as the sacred mission of his life, and thought himself to be committed to that purpose.

With strong determination and unwavering devotion he brought his life's mission very near its completion.

Until the end of his life he was working for this, and completed one full section just a few hours before his passing away, on 18 December 1952. Even on this last day of his life, he worked in the morning and afternoon on the last chapter of the section of Southern Saivism.

He died peacefully at eight in the evening while discussing problems
of modern psychology.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7671">'''Sébastien Basson''', [[Latinized name|Latinized]] as '''Sebastianus Basso''', was a French physician and natural philosopher of the beginning of the seventeenth century. He was an early theorist of a matter theory based on both [[atoms]] and [[Chemical compound|compounds]]. His [[natural philosophy]] draws on several currents of thought, including Italian Renaissance naturalism, alchemy and Calvinist theology.&lt;ref name="Luthy"/&gt; Basson was an [[atomism|atomist]], who, independently from [[Isaac Beeckman]], formed the concept of "molecule".&lt;ref name=Kubbinga/&gt;

==Biography==

Basson was born in the area of [[Metz]] in [[Lorraine (region)|Lorraine]] around 1573 and studied at the [[Jesuit]] academy of [[Pont-à-Mousson]], where he took philosophy courses under Pierre Sinson.&lt;ref name=aboutSinson/&gt; Where he obtained his doctorate in medicine is unknown and we have no sign of medical activity during his life. At some stage, but before 1610, he converted to [[Calvinism]] and got married in [[Lausanne]], Switzerland. From 1611 to 1625, he taught rhetoric at the small Calvinist academy of Die-en-Dauphiné.&lt;ref name=Die/&gt; In 1620, he had to appear before the board of theologians at Geneva in order to defend his anti-Aristotelian treatise, whose printing the [[censorship|censors]] had stopped. After tensions with the academic senate at Die had been rising for some years, he left the town in anger in 1625. Where he went and when he died is unknown.&lt;ref name="Luthy"/&gt;

==Philosophy==

Basson's ''Philosophiae naturalis adversus Aristotelem libri XII'' (''Twelve books&lt;ref name=book/&gt; of natural philosophy against Aristoteles'') of 1621, was strongly against the conception of natural philosophy as based on [[Aristotle]]; it attacked in particular the concept of continuous magnitude.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Garber, Michael Ayers (editors), ''The Cambridge History of Seventeenth-century Philosophy'' (2003) p.&amp;nbsp;556.&lt;/ref&gt; Ivor Leclerc considers this work the fullest expression of the “new conception of nature” that had arisen in Europe by the 1620s, at the hands of [[Francis Bacon]], [[Galileo Galilei]], [[David van Goorle]], and [[Daniel Sennert]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Leclerc|Leclerc]].&lt;/ref&gt;

For Basson, atoms may combine as ''mixta'', but they are not in a void, but rather in an [[Aether theories|ether]]. They are moved by it; in this suggestion Basson contradicts the [[teleology]] of the Jesuit view of [[Causality (physics)|causation]]. The theory of his time on the [[classical elements]] tended towards a version with [[Principle (chemistry)|five principles]], but Basson rejected [[earth (classical element)|earth]] and [[water (classical element)|water]] in his book, leaving his elemental theory as three [[Paracelsian]] principles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.xenodochy.org/gs/antivsnon.html ''Anti-Aristotelianism'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert P. Multhauf|R. P. Multhauf]], ''The Origins of Chemistry'' (1966), p.&amp;nbsp;277 and p.&amp;nbsp;299.&lt;/ref&gt; He opposed, though, the theory of "compounds", as admitted by Sennert, in the sense of mixtures having properties that were not properties of their atomistic constituents.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephen Gaukroger]], ''The emergence of a scientific culture: science and the shaping of modernity, 1210-1685'' (2006), p.&amp;nbsp;258.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some contemporaries—both adversaries&lt;ref name=listMersenne/&gt; and sympathizers&lt;ref name=listDescartes/&gt;—have set up lists of the proponents of new ideas during the early seventeenth century. All those "novateurs" keenly felt the deficiencies of [[Aristotelianism]] and the oppressiveness of tradition. Most of them were young (Galileo is a notable exception) and had a youthful and aggressive voice. There is the place of Basson.

'''Theodore Parker''' (August 24, 1810 – May 10, 1860) was an American [[Transcendentalism|Transcendentalist]] and [[Reform movement|reforming]] [[Religious minister|minister]] of the [[American Unitarian Association|Unitarian]] church. A reformer and [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]], his words and popular quotations would later inspire speeches by [[Abraham Lincoln]] and [[Martin Luther King, Jr.]]

== Early life, 1810–1829 ==

Theodore Parker was born in [[Lexington, Massachusetts]],&lt;ref name=Hankins143&gt;{{harvp|Hankins|2004|p=143}}&lt;/ref&gt; the youngest child in a large farming family. His paternal grandfather was [[John Parker (captain)|John Parker]], the leader of the Lexington militia at the [[Battle of Lexington]]. Among his colonial Yankee ancestors were [[Thomas Hastings (colonist)|Thomas Hastings]], who came from the East Anglia region of England to the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] in 1634, and [[Thomas Parker (deacon)|Deacon Thomas Parker]], who came from England in 1635 and was one of the founders of [[Reading, Massachusetts|Reading]].&lt;ref&gt;Buckminster, Lydia N.H., ''The Hastings Memorial, A Genealogical Account of the Descendants of Thomas Hastings of Watertown, Mass. from 1634 to 1864''. Boston: Samuel G. Drake Publisher (an undated NEHGS photoduplicate of the 1866 edition), 30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Parker, Theodore, ''John Parker of Lexington and his Descendants, Showing his Earlier Ancestry in America from Dea. Thomas Parker of Reading, Mass. from 1635 to 1893,'' pp. 15-16, 21-30, 34-36, 468-470, Press of Charles Hamilton, Worcester, MA, 1893.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Parker, Augustus G., ''Parker in America, 1630-1910,'' pp. 5, 27, 49, 53-54, 154, Niagara Frontier Publishing Co., Buffalo, NY, 1911.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of Theodore's family had died&lt;ref name="UUHS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www25.uua.org/uuhs/duub/articles/theodoreparker.html |title=Theodore Parker |author=Dean Grodzins |work=Unitarian Universalist Historical Society |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120530203236/http://www25.uua.org/uuhs/duub/articles/theodoreparker.html |archivedate=2012-05-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; by the time he was 27, probably due to [[tuberculosis]]. Out of eleven siblings, only five remained: three brothers, including Theodore, and two sisters. His mother, to whom he was emotionally close, died when he was eleven. He responded to these tragedies by refusing to lapse into what he called "the valley of tears," focusing instead on other events and demands, and by affirming "the immortality of the soul," later a benchmark of his theology.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Grodzins|2002|pp=27–28}} Theodore's sisters Rebecca, Ruth, and Hannah all died before he was five;  by the time he was eleven, his grandmother and loved mother had also died. His brother John and two remaining sisters, Emily, Mary, and Lydia, died while he was a young man.&lt;/ref&gt;

Descriptions of Parker as a teenager recall him as "raw" and rough, emotional and poetic, sincere, "arch," "roguish," volatile, witty, and quick. He excelled at academics and gained an early education through country schools and personal study. He studied long and late when farm chores allowed, tutoring himself in math, Latin, and other subjects. At seventeen he began teaching in local schools. He continued tutoring himself and private students in advanced and specialized subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Grodzins|2002|pp=20–21}}&lt;/ref&gt; He learned Hebrew from Joshua Seixas ([http://findingaids.cjh.org/?pID=109167 son] of [[Gershom Mendes Seixas]] and Hannah Manuel), whom he may have baptized in a covert conversion to Christianity.&lt;ref&gt;Shalom Goldman, ''God's Sacred Tongue: Hebrew &amp; the American Imagination'' (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2004), 187. Also see Shalom Goldman, "James/Joshua Seixas (1802-1874): Jewish Apostasy and Christian Hebraism in Early Nineteenth-Century America," ''Jewish History'' 7:1 (1993), 65-88.&lt;/ref&gt; He also studied for a time under [[Convers Francis]], who later preached at Parker's ordination.&lt;ref&gt;Gura, Philip F. ''American Transcendentalism: A History''. New York: Hill and Wang, 2007: 117. {{ISBN|0-8090-3477-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== College and divinity school, 1830–1836 ==

In 1830, at age 19, Parker walked the ten miles from Lexington to Cambridge to apply to [[Harvard College]]. He was accepted but could not pay the tuition, so he lived and studied at home, continued to work on his father's farm, and joined his classmates only for exams. Under that program, he was able to complete three years of study in one.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Grodzins|2002|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then took various posts as a teacher, conducting an academy from 1831 to 1834 at [[Watertown, Massachusetts]], where his late mother's family lived. At Watertown, he met his future wife, Lydia Dodge Cabot. He announced their engagement to his father in October, 1833. Theodore and Lydia were married four years later on April 20, 1837.&lt;ref&gt;For Parker's time in Watertown and engagement, see Grodzins, ''American Heretic'', 36; an earlier and more poetic account is in Henry Steele Commager, ''Theodore Parker: Yankee Crusader'' (Boston: Unitarian Universalist Association, 1947), 23. For marriage, see {{harvp|Grodzins|2002|p=87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While at Watertown, Parker produced his first significant manuscript, ''The History of the Jews'', which outlined his skepticism of biblical miracles and an otherwise liberal approach to Bible.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Grodzins|2002|pp=31, 391}}. For an account written by a contemporary describing Parker's time and writings at Watertown, including ''A History of the Jews'', see [[Octavius Brooks Frothingham]], ''Theodore Parker: A Biography'' (New York: G.P. Putnam, 1880), 39.&lt;/ref&gt; These were to be themes throughout his career.

[[File:Houghton MS Am 1506 (14) - Cranch.jpg|thumb|Caricature by [[Christopher Pearse Cranch]] depicting Parker's interest in German thinking]]
Parker considered a career in law, but his strong [[faith]] led him to theology. He entered the [[Harvard Divinity School]] in 1834.&lt;ref&gt;Hankins, Barry. The Second Great Awakening and the Transcendentalists. Westport, Connecticut: Greenwood Press, 2004: 143. {{ISBN|0-313-31848-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; He specialized in the study of German theology and was drawn to the ideas of [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge|Coleridge]], [[Thomas Carlyle|Carlyle]] and [[Ralph Waldo Emerson|Emerson]]. He wrote and spoke (with varying degrees of fluency) [[Latin (language)|Latin]], [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], and German.&lt;ref&gt;For his lack of speaking fluency in French and German, despite translating thousands of pages in writing, see {{harvp|Grodzins|2002|p=381}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His journal and letters show that he was acquainted with many other languages, including [[Chaldee]], [[Syriac language|Syriac]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Coptic language|Coptic]] and [[Ge'ez language|Ethiopic]]. He completed the divinity school program quickly, in 1836, in order to marry and begin preaching without delay.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Grodzins|2002|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Commager, ''Theodore Parker'', 23-24.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early home life and career, 1836–1842 ==

Parker called the late 1830s a "period of…disappointment." Citing "home; children; &amp; a good professional sphere," he wrote in his journal that "All fail me, &amp; all equally."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Grodzins|2002|p=118}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increasing controversies in his career culminated in a break with orthodoxy in the early 1840s. The fallout from these events affected him deeply, and it took him a few years to land on his feet and move forward.

===Marriage===
Parker and Lydia Cabot married in 1837, but the union was rocky at first due to environmental stresses and incompatibilities, and both were saddened to have no children.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Grodzins|2002|pp=91–102}} sketches out the initial difficulties of their marriage. Also see the journal entry reprinted as the figure "Marital strife" in {{harvp|Grodzins|2002|p=294}}, and taken from the Theodore Parker Papers, bMS 101, Andover-Harvard Theological Library of Harvard Divinity School, Cambridge, Massachusetts.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1840 he sought emotional release in the company of a neighboring woman, Anna Blake Shaw, who had a similar theology and temperament to his own, but the friendship was by all accounts not sexual. This attachment naturally increased problems at home, where he may have found it difficult to meet the emotional needs of his wife.&lt;ref&gt;For his relationship with Shaw, see {{harvp|Grodzins|2002|p=177}}; for the relationship with his wife, see {{harvp|Grodzins|2002|pp=100–102}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===First Pastorate===

Parker had spent 1836 visiting pulpits in the Boston area (G 80), but for family reasons accepted a [https://web.archive.org/web/20140313090117/http://www.tparkerchurch.org/about/our-history/ pastorate at West Roxbury in 1837]. At first, he found the location less than stimulating and work constraining.&lt;ref&gt;For pulpit touring, see {{harvp|Grodzins|2002|p=80}}; for his initial response to West Roxbury, see {{harvp|Grodzins|2002|p=89}}.&lt;/ref&gt; He adapted to pastoral life, however, and preached in many pulpits around Boston as a visitor. He gained a wide reputation as an earnest, effective speaker. In 1840 Harvard awarded him an honorary master's degree on the basis of his extensive learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Grodzins|2002|p=175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parker delivered one especially popular sermon twenty-five times between 1838 and 1841. In it, he argued against the popular notion that religion could be reduced to morality. "The principle of morality is obedience to the Law of con[science]," he wrote, while religion required more: that we "feel naturally, allegiance to a superior Being: dependence on him &amp; accountability to him." (The theme of dependence echoes [[Schleiermacher]], an indication of the German influence on his theology.) Morality involves right acting, while religion requires love of God and regular prayer, which Parker considered essential to human life. "No feeling is more deeply planted in human nature than the tendency to adore a superior being," he preached, "to reverence him, to bow before him, to feel his presence, to pray to him for aid in times of need" and "to bless him when the heart is full of joy."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Grodzins|2002|p=145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transcendentalism===

In 1837, Parker had begun attending meetings of the group later known as the [[Transcendental Club]]. [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]]'s Divinity School Address that year had been deeply arresting to him,&lt;ref&gt;Gary J. Dorrien, The Making of American Liberal Theology: Imagining Progressive Religion, 1805-1900, 77. Dorrien writes that Emerson's Harvard address "had a formative and catalyzing effect" on Parker.&lt;/ref&gt; and he welcomed the opportunity to associate with [[Ralph Waldo Emerson|Emerson]], [[Amos Bronson Alcott]], [[Orestes Brownson]], and several others.&lt;ref&gt;Buell, Lawrence. ''Emerson''. Cambridge, Massachusetts: The Belknap Press of Harvard University Press, 2003: 32–33. {{ISBN|0-674-01139-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Transcendentalists]] such as [[Henry David Thoreau]] and Parker wrote of the world as divine, and of themselves as part of this divinity. Unlike Emerson and other Transcendentalists, however, Parker believed the movement was rooted in deeply religious ideas and did not believe it should retreat from religion. All shared a conviction that slavery should be abolished and social reforms should take root.&lt;ref&gt;Hankins, The Second Great Awakening and the Transcendentalists, 28; 105; 143. On 105, Hankins notes that Parker was a Transcendentalist antislavery advocate and considered "perhaps the most important theologian the movement produced."&lt;/ref&gt;

Parker gradually introduced Transcendentalist ideas into his sermons. He tempered his radicalism with diplomacy and discretion, however. "I preach abundant heresies," he wrote to a friend, "and they all go down—for the listeners do not know how heretical they are."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Grodzins|2002|p=148}}&lt;/ref&gt; For years he had wrestled with the factuality of the Hebrew Scriptures, and by 1837 he was wishing "some wise man would now write a book…and show up the absurdity of…the Old Testament miracles, prophecies, dreams, miraculous births, etc.'" He was hardly alone. "'What shall we do with the Old Testament?' asked James Walker in 1838. 'That question is of such frequent recurrence among laymen as well as clergymen, that any well-considered attempt to answer it, or supply the means of answering it, is almost sure of hearty welcome."&lt;ref&gt;Shalom Goldman, God's Sacred Tongue, 187.&lt;/ref&gt; Questions regarding biblical realism and meaning, and the answers clergy increasingly found through the German-based [[higher criticism]], formed the basis of [[liberal Christianity]] as it emerged and developed throughout the nineteenth century.

In 1838 Parker published his first major article, a critical review of an orthodox work written by his former professor John Gorham Palfrey. In it Parker broke for the first time with supernatural realism, as he also increasingly did in his sermons.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Grodzins|2002|p=156}}&lt;/ref&gt; To him, Christianity was natural rather than miraculous. More and more, he praised social reform movements such as those for temperance, peace, and the abolition of slavery. In 1840 he described such movements as divinely inspired, though he added that they did not fully address the spiritual and intellectual ills of society.&lt;ref&gt;Grodzins, American Heretic, 205.&lt;/ref&gt; Controversy mounted regarding these and other Transcendentalist elements in his work. So did criticism, which often saddened and distressed him.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Grodzins|2002|p=184}} records one such experience of criticism, after which he "went weeping through the streets."&lt;/ref&gt;

===Break with Orthodoxy===

In 1841, Parker laid bare his radical theological position in a [http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1013&amp;context=etas sermon titled] ''[https://archive.org/details/transientandper00unkngoog A Discourse on the Transient and Permanent in Christianity]'', in which he espoused his belief that the traditions of historic Christianity did not reflect the truth. In so doing, he made an open break with orthodox theology. He instead argued for a type of Christian belief and worship in which the essence of Jesus's teachings remained permanent but the words, traditions, and other forms of their conveyance did not. He stressed the immediacy of God and saw the Church as a communion, looking upon Christ as the supreme expression of God. Ultimately, he rejected all miracles and revelation and saw the Bible as full of contradictions and mistakes. He retained his faith in God but suggested that people experience God intuitively and personally, and that they should center their religious beliefs on individual experience.&lt;ref name=Hankins143/&gt;

Parker's West Roxbury church remained loyal. Sermons and media attacked him, however, when he denied Biblical miracles and the literal authority of the Bible and Jesus. Many questioned his Christianity. Nearly all the pulpits in the Boston area were closed to him,&lt;ref name="Britannica nineteen eleven"&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Parker, Theodore |volume=20 |page=830}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he lost friends. Parker reacted with grief and defiance.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Grodzins|2002|pp=307, 361}}&lt;/ref&gt; He remained unwilling to concede that his views placed him beyond the outer bounds of Unitarian liberalism. After this unwilling break with the Unitarian establishment, he spent two years (1841-1843) adjusting to the reality of his newly controversial and independent career and increasing his social activism on religious grounds. He began to see himself as a prophetic religious reformer.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Grodzins|2002|p=344}} shows his first open support for [[Temperance movement|Temperance]] activism; {{harvp|Grodzins|2002|p=340}} notes that "For Parker, the ideal religious reformer was the solitary, heroic prophet. He was starting to see himself in this role."&lt;/ref&gt;

Parker accepted an invitation from supporters to preach in [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] in January 1845. He preached his first sermon there in February.  His supporters organized the 28th Congregational Society of Boston in December and installed Parker as minister in January 1846.&lt;ref name="UUHS"/&gt; His congregation, which included [[Louisa May Alcott]], [[William Lloyd Garrison]], [[Julia Ward Howe]], and [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]], grew to 7000.&lt;ref name="Columbia"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.bartleby.com/65/pa/Parker-T.html |title= Parker, Theodore |work= [[Columbia Encyclopedia]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mature home life and career, 1843–1859 ==

Parker's family life, temperament, and work steadied during the 1840s. The second half of his career revolved around antislavery, democracy, and religious social activism.

===Travel to Europe===

In 1843 and 1844, Theodore and Lydia traveled in Europe. While there his theology, career, and personal life matured and steadied. He was no longer as sensitive to criticism and bore difficulties more easily.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Grodzins|2002|p=370}}. In {{harvp|Grodzins|2002|pp=401–402}} Grodzins write that in Europe, "Parker's temperament grew steadier. The extraordinary sensitivity to rebuff, the intense 'agony of spirit,' seemed to disappear. Before his trip to Europe, he burst easily and often into tears; afterward, he almost never did so. He later would confront controversies far more severe, opponents far more dangerous, than any he had faced in 1841, 1842, and 1843; but none would so deeply affect him."&lt;/ref&gt; Away from extended family problems in West Roxbury, his marriage seems to have improved and become more steadily affectionate. Despite complex issues that occasionally resurfaced, he and Lydia were happier. "My wife is kind as an angel," he would write in his journal during denominational trials in 1845. His travels also seemed to stimulate a growing interest in political and social issues.&lt;ref&gt;For "kind as an angel," see {{harvp|Grodzins|2002|p=414}}. For renewed affection between the Parkers during and after their European trip, despite ongoing marital issues, see {{harvp|Grodzins|2002|pp=387–401}}. For more interest in political and social issues, see {{harvp|Grodzins|2002|p=403}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Independent Boston pastorate===

Returning to the United States, Parker found Unitarianism on the cusp of a division over his right to fellowship as a minister. His controversial 1841 sermon had created a stir that ballooned into an allout storm in 1844. The debate over the nature and degree of Parker's "infidelity" caused Unitarians to adopt a liberal creed, which they had formerly declined to do based on an inclusive principle. Their position proved too orthodox to include Parker.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Grodzins|2002|pp=412, 431}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January, 1845, a sizeable group of supporters gathered at Marlboro Chapel in Boston and resolved to provide Parker "a chance to be heard in Boston." Calling themselves "Friends of Theodore Parker," they hired a hall and invited him to preach there on Sunday mornings.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Grodzins|2002|p=457}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite misgivings, Parker accepted and preached his first sermon at the Melodean Theater in February. Although the arrangement was temporary at first,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Grodzins|2002|p=460}}&lt;/ref&gt; he resigned his West Roxbury pastorate in early 1846 (to the dismay of his faithful parishioners there). He elected to call his new congregation the 28th Congregational Society of Boston.&lt;ref&gt;On his resignation in West Roxbury and choosing a name for his new congregation, see {{harvp|Grodzins|2002|p=476}}. Also see Grodzins. "Theodore Parker". Unitarian Universalist Historical Society.&lt;/ref&gt;

Parker's congregation grew to 2,000—then three percent of Boston's population—and included influential figures such as [[Louisa May Alcott]], [[William Lloyd Garrison]], [[Julia Ward Howe]] (a personal friend), and [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]].&lt;ref name="Columbia"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;On the size of Parker's Melodean congregation, see {{harvp|Grodzins|2002|pp=477, 491}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Stanton called his sermons "soul-satisfying" when beginning her career, and she credited him with introducing her to the idea of a Heavenly Mother in the Trinity.&lt;ref&gt;Kathi Kern, ''Mrs. Stanton's Bible'' (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University Press, 2001). For "soul-satisfying," see 45. For "Heavenly Mother," see 165.&lt;/ref&gt; Parker was increasingly known for preaching what he and his followers identified as a type of prophetic Christian social activism.

===Reform movements and social theology===

After 1846, Parker shifted from a focus on Transcendentalism and challenging the bounds of Unitarian theology to a focus on the gathering national divisions over [[slavery]] and the challenges of [[democracy]]. In Boston, he led the movement to combat the stricter [[Fugitive Slave Act]], a controversial part of the [[Compromise of 1850]]. This act required law enforcement and citizens of all states—free states as well as slave states—to assist in recovering fugitive slaves. Parker called the law "a hateful statute of kidnappers" and helped organize open resistance to it. He and his followers formed the [[Boston Vigilance Committee]], which refused to assist with the recovery of fugitive slaves and helped hide them.&lt;ref&gt;Buescher, John. [http://teachinghistory.org/history-content/ask-a-historian/24525 Keep Your Top Eye Open]. [http://www.teachinghistory.org Teachinghistory.org] Accessed 2 June 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, they smuggled away [[Ellen and William Craft]] when Georgian slave catchers came to Boston to arrest them. Due to such efforts, from 1850 to the onset of the [[American Civil War]] in 1861, only twice were slaves captured in Boston and transported back to the South. On both occasions, Bostonians combatted the actions with mass protests.&lt;ref&gt;Potter, David Morris., and Don E. Fehrenbacher. ''The Impending Crisis, 1848–1861'', New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1976&lt;/ref&gt;

As Parker's early biographer John White Chadwick wrote, Parker was involved with almost all of the reform movements of the time: "peace, [[temperance movement|temperance]], education, the condition of women, penal legislation, [[prison reform|prison discipline]], the moral and mental destitution of the rich, the physical destitution of the poor" though none became "a dominant factor in his experience" with the exception of his antislavery views.&lt;ref&gt;Gura, Philip F.

Parker worked with many fugitive slaves, some of whom were among his congregation. As in the case of William and Ellen Craft,&lt;ref name="Stephen"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.secondunitarianomaha.org/sermons.cgi?id=58 |title=Theodore Parker, Slavery, and the Troubled Conscience of the Unitarians |author=Charles Stephen |work= |date=25 August 2002 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929002814/http://www.secondunitarianomaha.org/sermons.cgi?id=58 |archivedate=29 September 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; he hid them in his home. Although he was indicted for his actions, he was never convicted.&lt;ref name="Britannica nineteen eleven"/&gt;

As a member of the [[Secret Six]], he supported the abolitionist [[John Brown (abolitionist)|John Brown]], whom many considered a [[terrorism|terrorist]].  After Brown's arrest, Parker wrote a public letter, "[https://archive.org/details/johnbrownsexpedi01park John Brown's Expedition Reviewed]," arguing for the right of slaves to kill their masters and defending Brown's actions.

==Death==

[[Image:Cimitero degli inglesi, tomba Theodore Parker.JPG|thumb|left|Parker's tomb in Florence]]
Following a lifetime of overwork, Parker's ill health forced his retirement in 1859.&lt;ref name="Columbia"/&gt;  He developed [[tuberculosis]], then without effective treatment, and departed for [[Florence]], Italy, where he died on May 10, 1860. He sought refuge in Florence because of his friendship with [[Elizabeth Barrett Browning|Elizabeth Barrett]] and [[Robert Browning]], [[Isa Blagden]] and [[Frances Power Cobbe]], but died scarcely a month following his arrival. It was less than a year before the outbreak of the [[American Civil War]].

Parker was a patient of William Wesselhoeft, who practiced [[homeopathy]]. Wesselhoeft gave the oration at Parker's funeral&lt;ref&gt;[http://homeoint.org/seror/biograph/wesselhoeft.htm William Wesselhoeft (1794-1858) - Pioneers of homeopathy by T. L.

''Life and Times of Frederick Douglass'', 1893. NY: Library of America, reprint, 1994:1015&lt;/ref&gt;

Parker's headstone by [[Joel Tanner Hart]] was later replaced by one by [[William Wetmore Story]].  Other Unitarians buried in the [[English Cemetery, Florence|English Cemetery]] include [[Thomas Southwood Smith]] and [[Richard Hildreth]]. The British writer [[Fanny Trollope]], also buried here, wrote the first anti-slavery novel and Hildreth wrote the second.  Both books were used by [[Harriet Beecher Stowe]] for her antislavery novel ''[[Uncle Tom's Cabin]]'' (1852).

==Legacy and honors==
{{Slavery}}
*[[Unitarian Universalists]] honor Theodore Parker as "a canonical figure—the model of a prophetic minister in the American Unitarian tradition."&lt;ref name="UUHS"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For more on UUism claiming Parker as a founding figure, see Daniel McKanan, "Unitarianism, Universalism, and Unitarian Universalism," ''Religion Compass'' 7/1 (2013), 15–24.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The church in West Roxbury where Parker held his first pastorate (1837–1846) was renamed [http://www.tparkerchurch.org/ Theodore Parker Unitarian Universalist Church] in 1962. It retains this name today.
*[[Frances Power Cobbe|Frances P. Cobbe]] collected and published Parker's writings in 14 volumes.
*In an 1850 speech, Parker used the phrase, "A democracy—of all the people, by all the people, for all the people;"&lt;ref name="Bartleby"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bartleby.com/100/459.html |title=The American Idea:" speech at N.E.

*Parker predicted the inevitable success of the abolitionist cause this way: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;I do not pretend to understand the moral universe; the arc is a long one, my eye reaches but little ways; I cannot calculate the curve and complete the figure by the experience of sight; I can divine it by conscience. And from what I see I am sure it bends towards justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web |last=Manker-Seale |first=Susan |title=The Moral Arc of the Universe: Bending Toward Justice |url=http://www.uucnwt.org/sermons/TheMoralArcOfTheUniverse%201-15-06.html |date=2006-01-15 |accessdate=2008-02-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070811220256/http://www.uucnwt.org/sermons/TheMoralArcOfTheUniverse%201-15-06.html |archivedate=2007-08-11 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

*In 1963, [[Betty Friedan]]'s influential best seller, ''[[The Feminine Mystique]]'', believed to have sparked the 1960s and 70s women's movement, bore the following [[Epigraph (literature)|epigraph]] from Theodore Parker:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The domestic function of the woman does not exhaust her powers... To make one half of the human race consume its energies in the functions of housekeeper, wife and mother is a monstrous waste of the most precious material God ever made(1853).&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Eight months after the publication of Friedan's book, [[Kurt Vonnegut]] uses the same quote in his short story "Lovers Anonymous," first published in the October issue of ''Redbook'' magazine and reprinted in Vonnegut's 1999 collection ''Bagombo Snuff Box.''
*The new beige rug chosen for President [[Barack Obama]]'s remodeled [[Oval Office]]  in August 2010, was bordered by five quotations, two of which (by Lincoln and King) are inspired by the writings of Parker, as noted above.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news |last=Stiehm |first=Jamie |title=Oval Office rug gets history wrong |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/09/03/AR2010090305100.html |date=2010-09-04 |accessdate=2010-09-04 |work=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1896">'''William of Auxerre'''&lt;ref&gt;Guillaume d'Auxerre, Guillelmus Autissiodorensis, Wilhelm von Auxerre.&lt;/ref&gt; (died 1231) was a [[France|French]] [[scholasticism|scholastic]] [[theologian]] and official in the [[Roman Catholic Church]].

The teacher by whom William was most influenced was [[Praepositinus]], or Prevostin, of Cremona, Chancellor of the University of Paris from 1206 to 1209. The names of teacher and pupil are mentioned in the same sentence by [[Thomas Aquinas]].&lt;ref&gt;''Haec est opinio Praepositini et Autissiodorensis'' (in I Sent., XV, q. 11).&lt;/ref&gt; 

He was an Archdeacon of [[Beauvais]] before becoming a professor of theology at the university in [[Paris]].  In 1231, he was made a member of the commission appointed by [[Gregory IX]] to examine [[Aristotle]]'s writings on the natural sciences and to offer amendments where religiously necessary.  Consequently, William was one of the first theologians to be influenced by Aristotle.  His ''Summa Aurea'' shows a debt still to [[Peter Lombard]], and it advances the [[ontological argument]], but it also shows novelty and an intellectual awareness and insistence on the physical that had not been seen earlier.  ''Summa Aurea'' influenced [[John of Treviso]].
