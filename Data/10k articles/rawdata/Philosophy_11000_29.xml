{{JapaneseBuddhism}}
The [[Sanskrit]] term '''adhiṣṭhāna''' ({{lang-sa|अधिष्ठान}}; {{bo|t=བྱིན་རླབས|s=jinlap}}; {{lang-ja|加持}} ''kaji''; {{lang-th|[[wikt:อธิษฐาน|อธิษฐาน]]}} ''àtíttǎan'') is the name for initiations or blessings in [[Vajrayana|Vajrayana Buddhism]].  The term has various meanings, including [[Jagati (temple)|the raised base on which a temple stands]]. 

==Nomenclature, orthography and etymology==
''Adhiṣṭhāna''(''m'') is a term with multiple meanings: seat; basis; substratum; ground; support; and abode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atmajyoti.org/sw_glossary.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-01-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100209085845/http://www.atmajyoti.org/sw_glossary.asp |archivedate=2010-02-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Monier-Williams Sanskrit-English Dictionary Online holds the following semantic field for ''adhiṣṭhāna'':
# [noun] standing by, being at hand, approach  
# standing or resting upon
# a basis, base
# the standing-place of the warrior upon the car
# a position, site, residence, abode, seat
# a settlement, town, standing over
# government, authority, power
# a precedent, rule
# a benediction (Buddhism)&lt;ref&gt;Monier Williams Sanskrit-English Dictionary Online (April, 2009). 'adhiShThAna'. Source: [http://www.sanskrit-lexicon.uni-koeln.de/monier/indexcaller.php] (accessed: Sunday January 3, 2009) NB: change input to Itrans and place "adhiShThAna" (अधिष्ठान) as cited.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Francesca Fremantle]] gives an etymology of Sanskrit ''adhiṣṭhāna'' and Tibetan ''jinlap'': "The Sanskrit word literally means "standing over" and conveys ideas of taking possession, dwelling within, presence, protection, and sovereignty. The Tibetan literally means "an engulfing wave or flood of splendor and power." &lt;ref&gt;Fremantle, Francesca (2001). ''Luminous Emptiness: Understanding the Tibetan Book of the Dead.'' Boston: Shambala Publications. {{ISBN|1-57062-450-X}}, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;

Dan Martin opines that the Chinese term for adhiṣṭhāna influenced the Tibetan:{{quote|''Byin-rlabs'' is commonly glossed as 'gift wave', but it more properly goes back to a literal translation of a Chinese word which was almost certainly made during the earliest introduction of Buddhism into Tibet in the seventh or eighth centuries. It is not a literal translation of the Sanskrit Buddhists term adhisthana. Its actual, or rather its philologically correct, meaning is 'received by (way of) giving'.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Dan (1994). 'Pearls from Bones: Relics, Chortens, Tertons and the Signs of Saintly Death in Tibet'. ''Numen'', Vol. 41, No. 3. (Sep., 1994), p.274.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Tantra==

===Vajrayana===
[[Tsultrim Allione]] points out that in [[Tibetan Buddhism]] adhistana blessings are an important part of the [[pointing-out instruction]] received from the [[guru]] and [[lineage (Buddhism)|lineage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Allione|first=Tsultrim|title=Women of Wisdom|publisher=Arkana|location=London|year=1986|pages=xxxiv|isbn=1-85063-044-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Receiving these blessings is dependent on the student having proper motivation, aspiration and intentionality ([[bodhicitta]]) and sufficient "devotion" (Sanskrit: [[bhakti]]).  These blessings may be received from the student's [[guru]] during [[initiation]], from the [[yidam]] during [[Vajrayana#Deity yoga|deity yoga]], or simply from being in the presence of holy objects such as a [[stupa]].

In a study of the theory and practice of [[Shingon Buddhism]], an extant non-Himalayan school of Vajrayana, Kiyota (1978: p.&amp;nbsp;70) identifies three kinds of adhiṣṭhāna: 
#[[mudra]], the finger sign 
#[[dhāraṇī]], secret verses
#[[yoga]], through [[tantra techniques (Vajrayana)|meditation practices]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kiyota|first=Minoru|title=Shingon Buddhism: Theory and practice|publisher=Buddhist Books international|year=1978|page=70|isbn=0-914910-09-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term adhiṣṭhāna is also used to describe the transformative power of the [[Buddhahood|Buddha]]. According to [[D. T. Suzuki]]:
{{quote|The Buddha is creative life itself, he creates himself in innumerable forms with all the means native to him. This is called his adhisthana, as it were, emanating from his personality.

The idea of Adhisthana is one of the Mahayana landmarks in the history of Indian Buddhism and it is at the same time the beginning of the 'other-power' (tariki in Japanese) school as distinguished from the 'self-power' (jiriki).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Suzuki|first1=D. T.|authorlink1=D. T. Suzuki|title=The Shin Sect of Buddhism|url=http://www.nembutsu.info/suzuki1.htm|website=www.nembutsu.info|publisher=Journal of Shin Buddhism}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Stream of blessings==
In the Indo-Himalayan lineages of Vajrayana, where traditions of [[Tantra]] were introduced in the first wave of translations of Sanskrit texts into [[Old Tibetan]] from the 8th century onwards, the term chosen by the community of [[lotsawa]] "translators", which importantly is one of the most concerted translation efforts in documented history, chose to render adhiṣṭhāna as {{bo|t=བྱིན་རླབས|s=jinlap}}. This metaphorical usage of "stream, wave, thread, continuum" is reinforced in philosophy with the [[mindstream]] doctrine and its relationship to tantric [[sādhanā]], where it is used in visualizations and invocations, particularly in relation to the [[Three Vajras]] of [[Padmasambhava]] and depicted in Indo-Tibetan Buddhist and [[Bon]] iconography such as representations of the [[Adi-Buddha]] and [[Tapihritsa]]. Martin Mills, in a modern political and power-relations dissection of ''jinlap'' in relation to hierarchical structures of the [[Gelug]], a [[Sarma (Tibetan Buddhism)|Sarma]] (second-wave) school, holds that:
{{quote|The acceptance of offerings by worldly deities and spirits was felt very strongly to oblige the recipient to act in favour of the donor, and particularly to act as their protector (strungma), a term widely used by householders to describe the various numina that inhabited their houses. This protection was seen as being a blessing (chinlabs) which descended upon the offerer from above in the manner of a stream. This metaphor of the stream and its pure source is an important one, and is a central idiom by which hierarchical relations, either in hospitality gatherings, offering practices, or religious teachings, were conceived and spoken about, emphasising once again the salience of height as designating relations with social superiors and preceptors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Mills|first=Martin A.|title=Identity, Ritual and State in Tibetan Buddhism: The Foundations of Authority in Gelukpa Monasticism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UeAzk1WA3JcC&amp;pg=PA160|year=2003|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-7007-1470-4}}, page 160&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Honzon Kaji==
In Shingon Buddhism, mantras, mudras and visualization practices aim at achieving ''[[honzon]] kaji'' or union with the deity. According to Shingon priest Eijun Eidson:{{quote|Honzon simply refers to the main deity in any given ritual. Kaji refers to the enhancement of a sentient being’s power through the Buddha’s power (Nyorai-kaji-riki), and it translates the Sanskrit word adhisthana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebuddhadharma.com/issues/2004/spring/dharma_dictionary.htm|title=Kaji|last=Eidson|first=Eijun|publisher=Buddhadharma:The Practitioner's Quarterly|accessdate=2008-09-03| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080720034550/http://www.thebuddhadharma.com/issues/2004/spring/dharma_dictionary.htm| archivedate= 20 July 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9451">'''Agriculturalism''', also known as the '''School of Agrarianism''', the '''School of Agronomists''', the '''School of Tillers''', and in Chinese as the ''Nongjia'' (農家/农家), was an early [[Agrarianism|agrarian]] [[Chinese philosophy]] that advocated peasant [[utopian]] [[communalism]] and [[egalitarianism]], and was arguably the world's first [[Communist]] and [[Socialist]] movement that believed in a [[Classless society]].&lt;ref name="wp"&gt;{{cite book|last= Deutsch |first=Eliot |author2= Ronald Bontekoei|year=1999 | page= 183|title=A companion to world philosophies|publisher=Wiley Blackwell}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Agriculturalists believed that Chinese society should be modeled around that of the early sage king [[Shennong]], a folk hero who was portrayed in Chinese literature as "working in the fields, along with everyone else, and consulting with everyone else when any decision had to be reached."&lt;ref name="wp" /&gt; They encouraged farming and agriculture and taught farming and cultivation techniques, as they believed that agricultural development was the key to a stable and prosperous society.

Agriculturalism was suppressed during the [[Qin Dynasty]] and most original texts are now lost.
However, concepts originally associated with Agriculturalism have influenced [[Confucianism]], [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]], and [[Chinese philosophy]] as a whole.&lt;ref name="js"/&gt; Agriculturalism has significantly influenced Chinese thought, and has been viewed as an essence of the Chinese identity.&lt;ref name="dg"&gt;{{cite book|last= Gladney |first=Dru|year=2004 | page= 300|title=Dislocating China|publisher=University of Chicago Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{see also|Hundred Schools of Thought}}
[[Image:Shennong3.jpg|thumb|To the Agriculturalists, the governance and focus on agriculture by the legendary ruler [[Shennong]] served as a model of the ideal government.]]
Agriculturalism dates back to the [[Spring and Autumn period]] and [[Warring States period]], during a period known as the "[[Hundred Schools of Thought]]" which flourished from 770 to 221 BC. Throughout this period, competing states, seeking to war with one another and unite China as a single country, patronized philosophers, scholars, and teachers. The competition by scholars for the attention of rulers led to the development of different schools of thought, and the emphasis on recording teachings into books encouraged their spread.&lt;ref name="pe"&gt;{{cite book|last= Ebrey |first=Patricia|year=2010 | page= 42|title=The Cambridge Illustrated History of China|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result was an era characterized by significant intellectual and cultural developments.&lt;ref name="pe"/&gt; The major philosophies of China, [[Confucianism]], [[Mohism]], [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]], and [[Taoism]], all originated from this period.

Chinese tradition attributes the origin of Agriculturalism to the Chinese minister [[Hou Ji]], a figure known for his innovations in agriculture.&lt;ref name="js"&gt;{{cite book|last= Sellmann |first=James Daryl|year=2010 | page= 76|title=Timing and rulership in Master Lü's Spring and Autumn annals|publisher=SUNY Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Agriculturalists also emphasized the role of [[Shennong]], the divine farmer, a semi-mythical ruler of early China credited by the Chinese as the inventor of agriculture. Shennong was seen as a proto-Agriculturalist, whose governance and focus on agriculture served as a model of the ideal Agriculturalist government.&lt;ref name="js"/&gt;

[[Xu Xing (philosopher)|Xu Xing]], a philosopher who defended Agriculturalism, settled with a group of followers in the state of [[Teng (state)|Teng]] in about 315 BC. A disciple of his visited the Confucian philosopher [[Mencius]], and a short report of their conversation discussing Xu Xing's philosophy survives.&lt;ref name=graham&gt;{{cite journal |title=The "Nung-chia" 農 家 'School of the Tillers' and the Origins of Peasant Utopianism in China|author=A. C. Graham|journal=Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies|volume=42|number=1|year=1979|pages=66–100|jstor=614828|doi=10.1017/s0041977x00108468}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rise of the [[Qin Dynasty]] in 221 BC saw the [[Burning of books and burying of scholars|purge of the Hundred Schools of Thought]], including Agriculturalism. The Legalist Qin dynasty was intolerant of other schools of thought, seeking to burn any text that did not adhere to the Legalist philosophy.&lt;ref name="sc"&gt;{{cite book|last= Ong |first= Siew Chey|year=2005 | page= 16|title=China condensed: 5000 years of history &amp; culture |publisher=Marshall Cavendish}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, few Agriculturalist texts exist, and most of what is known of Agriculturalism comes from critical assessments by other philosophical schools.&lt;ref name="js"/&gt;

The bibliography of the [[Book of Han]] (2nd century AD) presents Agriculturalism as one of 10 philosophical schools and lists 9 books belonging to that school.&lt;ref name=graham/&gt;

==Philosophy==
Agriculturalism is primarily a social, economic, and political philosophy. The philosophy is founded on the notion that human society originates with the development of [[agriculture]], and societies are based upon "people's natural prospensity to farm."&lt;ref name="js"/&gt; The Agriculturalists described the ancient political system, seen as ideal, as one where "the means by which the early sage kings led their people was to put agriculture before all other affairs.. the reason why Hou Ji undertook agriculture was because he considered it to be the root of instructing the masses."&lt;ref name="js"/&gt;

===Political===
To the Agriculturalists, the ideal society, modeled after that of [[Shennong]]'s, is [[communalism|communal]], [[agrarianism|agrarian]], and [[egalitarianism|egalitarian]].&lt;ref name="wp"/&gt; The Agriculturalist believed that the ideal government is led by a benevolent king, one who works alongside the people in tilling the fields. The Agriculturalist king is not paid by the government through its treasuries; his livelihood is derived from the profits he earns working in the fields and cooking his own meals, not his leadership.&lt;ref name="dw"/&gt; Said [[Xu Xing (philosopher)|Xu Xing]], a prominent Agriculturalist:
{{quote|The ruler of Teng is an upright and worthy ruler. However, he has yet to hear the Way. A wise ruler tills the land together with his people to make his living. He governs while cooking his own meals. Now, that Teng has granaries and treasuries means that [the ruler] inflicts hardship on the people to fatten himself. How can he be a worthy ruler?|Xu Xing&lt;ref name="dw"/&gt;}}

===Economic===
Unlike the Confucians, the Agriculturalists did not believe in the [[division of labour]], arguing instead that the economic policies of a country need to be based upon an egalitarian [[self sufficiency]].&lt;ref name="dw"/&gt; The Agriculturalists supported the [[price fixing|fixing of prices]], in which all similar goods, regardless of differences in quality and demand, are set at exactly the same, unchanging price. They suggested that people should be paid the same amount for the same services, a policy criticized by the Confucians as encouraging products of low quality, which "destroys the earnest standards of craftmanship."&lt;ref name="dw"/&gt;

==Reception==
Agriculturalism was criticized extensively by rival philosophical schools, including the [[Mohist]] [[Mo Zi]], the Confucian [[Mencius]], and [[Yang Zhu]].&lt;ref name="js"/&gt; [[Mencius]] criticized its chief proponent [[Xu Xing (philosopher)|Xu Xing]] for advocating that rulers should work in the fields with their subjects, arguing that the Agriculturalist egalitarianism ignored the [[division of labour]] central to society. He points out that other early Chinese rulers did not work in fields, yet were equally as successful and revered as Shennong.&lt;ref name="dw"/&gt; Mencius dismisses Xu Xing as a "Southern barbarian with a twittering tongue."&lt;ref name="dw"&gt;{{cite book|last= Denecke|first=Wiebke|year=2011 | page= 38|title=The Dynamics of Masters Literature: Early Chinese Thought from Confucius to Han Feizi|publisher=Harvard University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Influence===
{{see also|Agrarianism}}
The Legalist [[Qin Dynasty]] [[Burning of books and burying of scholars|purged rival philosophical schools]], including Agriculturalism, burning many Agriculturalist texts. However, Agriculturalism in its heyday heavily influenced the agrarian policies of [[Confucianism]], Legalism, and other philosophical schools,&lt;ref name="js"/&gt; so many concepts originally associated with the Agriculturalists continued to exist in Chinese philosophy. The transmission and translation of Chinese philosophical texts in Europe during the 18th century had a heavy influence on the development of [[Agrarianism]] in [[Europe]]. The French agrarianist philosophy, a predecessor to modern Agrarianism, of [[François Quesnay]] and the [[Physiocrats]], are said to have been modeled after the agrarian policies of Chinese philosophy.&lt;ref name="lam"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Maverick|first1= Lewis A.|year=1938|title= Chinese Influences Upon the Physiocrats|journal=Economic History|volume=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2527">'''Alethiology''' (or '''alethology''', "the study of [[aletheia]]") literally means the ''study of [[truth]]'', but can more accurately be translated as ''the study of the nature of truth''.|&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/alethiology |title=Alethiology |encyclopedia=Oxford Dictionaries (online) |accessdate=10 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
It could be argued that ''alethiology'' synonymous with ''[[epistemology]]'', the study of knowledge, and that dividing the two is mere [[semantics]], but sometimes a distinction is made between the two. Epistemology is the study of knowledge and its acquisition. Alethiology is specifically concerned with the ''nature'' of truth, which is only one of the areas studied by epistemologists.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

The term ''alethiology'' is rare. The ten-volume ''[[Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' mentions it only once, in the article "Lambert, Johann Heinrich (1728–77)":
{{quote|Part Two of the ''Neues Organon'' is the 'Alethiology or Doctrine of Truth'. Lambert’s key concern here is with the nature and function of the simple concepts that serve as the building blocks for the logical construction of true propositions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Lambert, Johann Heinrich (1728–77)|encyclopedia=Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy |edition=1.0 |location=London |publisher=Routledge |year=1998 |isbn=978-0415073103}} {{full|date=September 2018|reason=year, volume, page}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition]] describes the discipline as "…an uncommon expression for the doctrine of truth, used by [[Sir William Hamilton, 9th Baronet|Sir William Hamilton]] in his philosophic writings when treating of the rules for the discrimination of truth and error."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Alethiology |volume=1 |page=543}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term appears in ''The Banalization of Nihilism'' (pp. 17–18) in contrast to several other types of nihilism, especially epistemological nihilism. The views of several philosophers are then distinguished by reference to 'alethiological nihilism', 'epistemological nihilism' and the like.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Karr |first=Karen L. |title=The Banalization of Nihilism |publisher=State University of New York Press |year=1992 |isbn=0-7914-0833-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anna Willess Williams''' (1857 – April 17, 1926) was a teacher and philosophical writer best known as the model for [[George T. Morgan|George T. Morgan's]] silver dollar design, popularly known as the [[Morgan dollar]].

== Morgan dollar ==

[[File:1899 obverse.jpg|thumb|left|150px|1899 Morgan dollar]]

In 1876, George T. Morgan began creating a series of new coin designs at the behest of Director of the Mint, [[Henry Linderman|Dr. Henry R. Linderman]].&lt;ref name="vam"&gt;Van Allen &amp; Mallis, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; Morgan opted to use the profile of an American girl to depict [[Liberty (goddess)|Liberty]] instead of simply creating an imaginary figure for the [[obverse and reverse|obverse]] of his new design.&lt;ref name="vam"/&gt; After he rejected several possible candidates, Morgan's friend, artist [[Thomas Eakins]], recommended Anna Williams of [[Philadelphia]].&lt;ref name="vam"/&gt; Eakins knew Williams through her father, Henry Williams, and she had posed for several of Eakins's paintings.&lt;ref name="vam"/&gt; 

Williams reluctantly sat for five modelling sessions with Morgan in November 1876 after being convinced to do so by friends.&lt;ref name="vam"/&gt; Morgan was impressed with her profile, stating that it was the most perfect he had seen in England or America.&lt;ref name="vam"/&gt; The [[Dollar coin (United States)|silver dollar]] bearing her likeness was first struck on March 11, 1878.&lt;ref name="vam"/&gt; A condition of her sitting for Morgan was that her identity be kept secret, but the subject of the portrait was revealed to be Williams shortly after the dollar was released.&lt;ref name="vam"/&gt; Williams was troubled by her newly acquired fame, receiving thousands of letters and visits at both her home and workplace.&lt;ref name="vam"/&gt; Williams preferred not to talk about her modelling work with Morgan, dismissing it as an "incident of my youth."&lt;ref name="time"/&gt;

[[File:Carl Hilty 1833 1909.jpg|thumb|Carl Hilty.]]  
'''Carl Hilty''' (28 February 1833 – 12 October 1909) was a [[Swiss people|Swiss]] [[philosopher]], writer and lawyer. He famously said "Peace is only a hair's breadth away from war." Although a Christian he was no pacifist but expected the coming world war and was also a high officer in Swiss Army. He was married to German wife Johanna Gaertner. Hilty was a spokesman for women's rights to vote and to be elected, many decades before the subject became mainstream.  Hilty argued that Switzerland, as a nation-state comprising several nationalities and languages, had a unique mission of demonstrating that a nation-state could transcend tribal tendencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Baycroft|first1=Timothy|last2=Hewitson|first2=Mark|title=What is a nation? : Europe 1789-1914|date=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0199295751|page=105|edition=1. publ.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carl Hilty was born in [[Werdenberg, Switzerland|Ort Werdenberg]], [[Switzerland]], and studied at the Universities of [[University of Göttingen|Göttingen]] and
[[University of Heidelberg|Heidelberg]]. To improve languages and see the world, he also spent some time in [[London]] and [[Paris]]. After that he began his work as a lawyer in Chur where he lived for almost 20 years. In 1874, he became a professor of constitutional law (Staats- und Volkerrecht) at the [[University of Bern]]. From 1886, he edited ''Politisches Jahrbuch der schweizerischen Eidgenossenschaft'' (The Journal of Swiss Jurisprudence). In 1890, he became a member of the [[National Council of Switzerland|Nationalrat]], the Swiss parliament.

Hilty's philosophical concern was practical in nature.  He wrote about happiness, the meaning of life and work, developing good habits, time management, and winning the battles of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carlin|first1=Nathan|last2=Capps|first2=Donald|title=100 years of happiness insights and findings from the experts|date=2012|publisher=Praeger|location=Santa Barbara, Calif.|isbn=1440803633}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became famous from his writings about happiness, three volumes - first printed in 1891, 95 and 99 - combined ancient [[Stoicism|stoic]] thought with Christian belief, following the words Jesus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Williams|first1=Charles|title=Adenauer the father of the new Germany|date=2001|publisher=J. Wiley|location=New York|isbn=0471437670|page=33}}&lt;/ref&gt; These books were translated and read all over the world, even by presidents of the USA or the first Kanzler of Germany Adenauer who survived the spiritual desert of Nazi time by reading Carl Hilty.

Hilty supported the Salvation Army which opened their services in Zurich. At first he made jokes about their noisy appearance but only a few years later he recognized them as one of the few groups who were able to live Christianity and put the words of Jesus in practice. Hilty was in his time one of the few intellectuals who still believed in the Gospel while most dedicated themselves to the so-called "monastic" philosophy following the new sciences after Darwin.

Hilty believed in a new reformation beyond the dogmas of churches and politics, after the time of materialism.

Hilty's work influenced the thinking of [[William James]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Capps|first1=Donald|title=The Religious Life: The Insights of William James|date=2015|publisher=Wipf and Stock Publishers|isbn=1498219950|pages=193–194|url=https://books.google.com/?id=MGOPCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT188&amp;dq=karl+hilty#v=onepage&amp;q=karl%20hilty&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He died in [[Clarens, Switzerland|Clarens]].

'''Carlos Andrés Segovia y Corral''' (born 22 May 1970 in [[London]], [[United Kingdom]]) is a philosopher and a scholar of religious studies.

He is lecturer in religious studies at [[Saint Louis University]] in [[Madrid]], [[Spain]]. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.slu.edu/madrid/academics/faculty/carlos-segovia.php Saint Louis University, Madrid Campus]&lt;/ref&gt;

While over the past ten years he has mostly worked on late-antique religion, his current research focuses instead on the study of religion at the crossroads of contemporary philosophy, cosmopolitics, and postcoloniality. On the one hand, he works on the definitions, forms, contexts, causes, and implications of religious violence against the background of Integrated World Capitalism, and, on the other hand, on non-Western animistic ontologies and the revision of conceptual production in the social sciences and the humanities and its potential delinking from the hegemonic power/knowledge regimes of global neoliberalism. He is also series co- editor of Apocalypticism: Cross-disciplinary Explorations at Peter Lang. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.peterlang.com/view/serial/ACE Peter Lang International Academic Publishers ACE Series]&lt;/ref&gt;

He is the author of numerous scholarly books and articles, including the monographs: ''The Quranic Noah and the Making of the Islamic Prophet: A Study of Intertextuality and Religious Identity Formation in Late Antiquity'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.degruyter.com/view/product/448419 Walter de Gruyter JCIT Series]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Quranic Jesus: A New Interpretation'',&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.degruyter.com/view/product/503095 Walter de Gruyter JCIT Series]&lt;/ref&gt;

He is the youngest child of the celebrated classical guitarist [[Andrés Segovia]], the first Marquis of Salobreña.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geneall.net/H/per_page.php?id=1010944 Genealogy of the Marquesses of Salobreña]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''category mistake''', or '''category error''', or '''categorical mistake''', or '''mistake of category''', is a [[semantic]] or [[ontology|ontological]] error in which things belonging to a particular category are presented as if they belong to a different category,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Blackburn |first=Simon |authorlink=Simon Blackburn |date=1994 |title=[[The Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy]] |publisher=Oxford University Press |page=58}}&lt;/ref&gt; or, alternatively, a property is ascribed to a thing that could not possibly have that property.  An example is the [[metaphor]] "time crawled", which if taken literally is not just false but a category mistake. To show that a category mistake has been committed one must typically show that once the phenomenon in question is properly understood, it becomes clear that the claim being made about it could not possibly be true.

==Gilbert Ryle==
The term "category-mistake" was introduced by [[Gilbert Ryle]] in his book ''[[The Concept of Mind]]'' (1949) to remove what he argued to be a confusion over the nature of mind born from [[Descartes|Cartesian]] [[metaphysics]]. Ryle alleged that it was a mistake to treat the mind as an object made of an immaterial substance because predications of substance are not meaningful for a collection of dispositions and capacities.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

The phrase is introduced in the first chapter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Ryle |first=Gilbert |authorlink=Gilbert Ryle |date=1949 |title=The Concept of Mind |page=16 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ryl-ezY6Mn8C&amp;printsec=find&amp;pg=PA16=onepage=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first example is of a visitor to [[University of Oxford|Oxford]]. The visitor, upon viewing the [[Colleges of the University of Oxford|colleges]] and [[Bodleian Library|library]], reportedly inquired "But where is the University?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=MacFadden |first=T. G. |date=Summer 2001 |title=Understanding the Internet: Model, Metaphor, and Analogy |journal=[[Library Trends]] |publisher=[[Johns Hopkins University Press]] |location=Baltimore |volume=50 |number=1 |page=96 |url=http://www.ideals.illinois.edu/bitstream/handle/2142/8386/librarytrendsv50i1h_opt.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=December 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The visitor's mistake is presuming that a University is part of the category "units of physical infrastructure" rather than that of an "institution". Ryle's second example is of a child witnessing the march-past of a division of soldiers.  After having had battalions, batteries, squadrons, etc. pointed out, the child asks when is the division going to appear. "The march-past was not a parade of battalions, batteries, squadrons ''and'' a division; it was a parade of the battalions, batteries and squadrons ''of'' a division." (Ryle's italics) His third example is of a foreigner being shown a cricket match.  After being pointed out batsmen, bowlers and fielders, the foreigner asks: "who is left to contribute the famous element of team-spirit?"{{cn|date=August 2018}}

He goes on to argue that the [[Cartesian dualism]] of mind and body rests on a category mistake. In the philosophy of the mind, Ryle's category mistake argument can be used to support [[eliminative materialism]]. By using the argument, one can attack the existence of a separate, distinct mind. The argument concludes that minds are not conscious, but a collective predicate for a set of observable behaviour and unobservable dispositions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Welshon |first=Rex |title=Philosophy, Neuroscience and Consciousness |date=2011 |publisher=Acumen |location=Durham |isbn=978-1-84465-159-7 |page=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2015">The '''Cheng–Zhu school''' ({{zh|p=Chéng Zhū lĭxué|t=程朱理學}}), is one of the major philosophical schools of [[Neo-Confucianism]], based on the ideas of the Neo-Confucian philosophers [[Cheng Yi (philosopher)|Cheng Yi]], [[Cheng Hao]], and [[Zhu Xi]]. It is also referred to as the Rationalistic School.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A0qs9W6Km6UC&amp;pg=PA545#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title= A Source Book in Chinese Philosophy |pages=545&amp;ndash;546 |isbn=9781400820030 |publisher=Princeton University Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zhu Xi's formulation of the Neo-Confucian world view is as follows. He believed that the Dao (Chinese: 道; pinyin: dào; literally "way") of Tian (Chinese: 天; pinyin: tiān; literally "heaven") is expressed in principle or li (Chinese: 理; pinyin: lǐ), but that it is sheathed in matter or qi (Chinese: 氣; pinyin: qì). In this, his system is based on Buddhist systems of the time that divided things into principle (again, li), and shi (Chinese: 事; pinyin: shì). In the Neo-Confucian formulation, li in itself is pure and almost-perfect, but with the addition of qi, base emotions and conflicts arise. Human nature is originally good, the Neo-Confucians argued (following Mencius), but not pure unless action is taken to purify it. The imperative is then to purify one's li. However, in contrast to Buddhists and Daoists, neo-Confucians did not believe in an external world unconnected with the world of matter. In addition, Neo-Confucians in general rejected the idea of reincarnation and the associated idea of karma.

Different Neo-Confucians had differing ideas for how to do so. Zhu Xi believed in gewu (Chinese: 格物; pinyin: géwù), the Investigation of Things, essentially an academic form of observational science, based on the idea that li lies within the world.

'''Daniel Adam z Veleslavína''', literally translated ''Daniel Adam of Veleslavín'', (31 August 1546 &amp;ndash; 18 October 1599), was a [[Czech people|Czech]] [[Lexicography|lexicographer]], publisher, translator, and writer. (''Veleslavína'' is the [[genitive]] declension of [[Veleslavín]], a district of today's Greater Prague)

Adam Veleslavín  studied at the [[Charles University in Prague|University of Prague]], and from 1569 to 1575 he was professor there. When he married the daughter of the publisher [[Jiří Melantrich z Aventina]] (1511–1580), he was forced to leave the university (professors were required to keep [[celibacy]]). He started working at the print press and later took it over.

He and his collaborators translated and published many historical, religious, and scientific books. Adam himself wrote only one book, the ''Kalendář historický'' (''Historical Calendar,'' 1578 and 1590, an overview of [[European history]]).

Adam was a secret member of the [[Unity of the Brethren]]. His work of most impact was publishing a Czech translation of the [[Bible]] – the ''[[Bible of Kralice|Bible kralická]]'' (six volumes, between 1579 and 1594). The language used in the translation was considered the best literary language in the [[Czech lands]] and in the area of today's [[Slovakia]] (the so-called ''bibličtina'', Bible language).

'''Edmond Pourchot''' (1651, [[Poilly]] – 1734, [[Paris]])  was a university professor noted for his controversial advocacy of [[Cartesianism]] (and the [[Cartesian physics|Cartesian]] theory of [[classical mechanics|mechanics]]) in place of [[Aristotelianism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scholasticon.fr/Database/Scholastiques_fr.php?ID=1040 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716060633/http://www.scholasticon.fr/Database/Scholastiques_fr.php?ID=1040 |archivedate=2011-07-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'''Watt, R.''' ''Bibliotheca Britannica; Or a General Index to British and Foreign Literature.'' [[Edinburgh]], 1824.&lt;/ref&gt; The change within the [[University of Paris]] from Aristotelianism to Cartesianism during the 1690s was important in the history of the development of [[natural philosophy]] in [[France]] and continental [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;'''Brockliss, Laurence.'''

''Models of the History of Philosophy.'' Springer, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pourchot was named Professor of Philosophy in 1677, and he was a long-standing vice-chancellor/rector of the University of Paris, where he taught for 26 years. He authored a popular multi-volume [[Latin]] text entitled ''Institutiones philosophicae ad faciliorem veterum, ac recentiorum philosophorum lectionem comparatae'' (Paris, 1695; Paris, 1700; [[Lyon]], 1711; [[Venice]], 1715; Lyon, 1716–1717; Venice, 1730 [standard edition]; Paris &amp; Lyon &amp; [[Padua]], 1733; Padua, 1751; Venice, 1755).&lt;ref&gt;Dates and places of publication from Heritage of the Printed Book database, COPAC, and BnF catalogues.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[:it:Edmond Pourchot]]&lt;/ref&gt; This text was well regarded among eminent French intellectuals, and gained followers for Cartesianism in many other countries including [[Turkey]] and [[Poland]].&lt;ref&gt;''Chalmer's Biography'', 1812, vol 25, p239.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'''Shaw, S.J.''' ''History of the Ottoman Empire and Modern Turkey.'' Cambridge University Press, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; He was also a scholar of the [[Hebrew language]].

'''Ethical extensionism''' is an [[argument]] in [[environmental ethics]] that [[moral standing]] ought to be extended to things (animals, plants, species, the earth) that traditionally are not thought of as having moral standing.

For example, while many cultures differ as to what, exactly, is "[[murder]]", all cultures take it as wrong to commit murder. An example of ethical extensionism would be to extend to dogs or cats the status of being something that can be murdered, so that it would be wrong under some circumstances to kill a dog or cat.

On the one hand, ethical extensionism is a broadening of the class of things to which humans may owe an ethical duty.

But Des Jardins makes the point that most ethical extensionism has been merely broadening the ethical sphere incrementally, a process not agreeable to some environmental ethicists who would prefer more of a total replacement of traditional [[ethics]] with an entirely new approach. So, while ethical extensionism can, in principle, broaden the sphere of ethical standing to any arbitrary limits, the extensionist approach is seen by more recent ethical theorists as being inadequate.

The '''University of Montenegro Faculty of Philosophy''' ([[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]]: '''Filozofski fakultet Univerziteta Crne Gore''' ''Филозофски факултет Универзитета Црне Горе'') is one of the educational institutions of the [[University of Montenegro]]. The building is located in [[Nikšić]], close to the city center.

== History ==

The Faculty's history can be traced back to 1947, when the '''Pedagogical College''' ([[Montenegrin language|Montenegrin]]: '''Viša pedagoška škola''' ''Виша педагошка школа'') was founded in [[Cetinje]]. The College was moved to [[Nikšić]] in 1963, and renamed the '''Pedagogical Academy''' ('''Pedagoška akademija''' ''Педагошка академија''). Between 1977 and 1988, the school was called the '''Teaching Faculty''' ('''Nastavnički fakultet''' ''Наставнички факултет'').

Since 1988, the Faculty is known by its current name.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ff.ac.me/istorijat.htm&lt;/ref&gt; It officially became part of the [[University of Montenegro]] on April 29, 1974, when the ''Agreement on Association into the University of Titograd'' (today's University of Montenegro) was signed with the representatives of the Faculty of Law, the Faculty of Engineering, the [[University of Montenegro Faculty of Economics|Faculty of Economics]], the Maritime Studies College from [[Kotor]] and three independent scientific institutes from [[Titograd]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ucg.ac.me/cg/o_univerzitetu.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Disagreements of this kind may arise in areas of evaluative discourse, such as [[aesthetics]], justification of [[belief]]s or [[moral value]]s, etc. A representative example is John says Mary prettier that Anne, while Bob claims vice versa.

{{short description|System of morality in Buddhism}}
{{LayBuddhistPractices}}
The '''five precepts''' ({{lang-pi|italic=yes|pañcasīla}}; {{lang-sa|italic=yes|pañcaśīla}}) or '''five rules of training''' ({{lang-pi|pañcasikkhapada|italic=yes}}; {{lang-sa|pañcaśikṣapada|italic=yes}}{{sfn |Getz |2004 |page=673}}{{sfn |Terwiel |2012 |pp=178{{en dash}}9}}){{refn |group=note |Also spelled as ''pañcasīlani'' and ''pañcasikkhāpadani'', respectively.{{sfn |Terwiel |2012 |p=178}}}} is the most important system of morality for [[Upāsaka and Upāsikā|Buddhist lay people]]. They constitute the basic code of [[Buddhist ethics|ethics]] undertaken by lay followers of Buddhism. The precepts are commitments to abstain from killing [[sentient being (Buddhism)|living beings]], stealing, sexual misconduct, lying and intoxication. Within the Buddhist doctrine, they are meant to develop mind and character to make progress on the path to [[enlightenment (Buddhism)|enlightenment]]. They are sometimes referred to as the '''''[[śrāvakayāna]] precepts''''' in the [[Mahāyāna]] tradition, contrasting them with the [[bodhisattva Precepts|''bodhisattva'' precepts]]. The five precepts form the basis of several parts of Buddhist doctrine, both lay and monastic. With regard to their fundamental role in Buddhist ethics, they have been compared with the [[ten commandments]] in Christianity{{sfn |Keown |2013b |page=638}}{{sfn |Wai |2002 |p=4}} or the [[li (Confucianism)|ethical codes]] of [[Confucianism]]. The precepts have been connected with [[utilitarianist]], [[deontological]] and [[virtue ethics|virtue]] approaches to ethics. They have been compared with human rights because of their universal nature, and some scholars argue they can complement the concept of human rights.

The five precepts were common to the religious milieu of 6th-century BCE India, but the Buddha's focus on [[Appamada|awareness]] through the fifth precept was unique. As shown in [[Early Buddhist Texts]], the precepts grew to be more important, and finally became a condition for membership of the Buddhist religion. When Buddhism spread to different places and people, the role of the precepts began to vary. In countries where Buddhism had to compete with other religions, such as China, the ritual of undertaking the five precepts developed into an initiation ceremony to become a Buddhist lay person. On the other hand, in countries with little competition from other religions, such as Thailand, the ceremony has had little relation to the rite of becoming Buddhist, as many people are presumed Buddhist from birth.

Undertaking and upholding the five precepts is based on the principle of [[ahimsa|non-harming]] ([[Pāli]] and {{lang-sa|ahiṃsa|italic=yes}}). The [[Pali Canon]] recommends one to compare oneself with others, and on the basis of that, not to hurt others. Compassion and a belief in [[karma (Buddhism)|karmic retribution]] form the foundation of the precepts. Undertaking the five precepts is part of regular lay devotional practice, both at home and at the local temple. However, the extent to which people keep them differs per region and time. People keep them with an intention to develop themselves, but also out of fear of a [[Buddhist cosmology|bad rebirth]].

The first precept consists of a prohibition of killing, both humans and all animals. Scholars have interpreted Buddhist texts about the precepts as an opposition to and prohibition of capital punishment,{{sfn |Alarid |Wang |2001 |pages=236{{en dash}}7}} suicide, abortion{{sfn |Keown |2016a |p=213}}{{sfn |Perrett |2000 |page=110}} and euthanasia.{{sfn |Keown |2016b |page=170}} In practice, however, many Buddhist countries still use the death penalty. With regard to abortion, Buddhist countries take the middle ground, by condemning though not prohibiting it. The Buddhist attitude to violence is generally interpreted as opposing all warfare, but some scholars have raised exceptions. The second precept prohibits theft. The third precept refers to adultery in all its forms, and has been defined by modern teachers with terms such as ''sexual responsibility'' and ''long-term commitment''. The fourth precept involves falsehood spoken or committed to by action, as well as malicious speech, harsh speech and gossip. The fifth precept prohibits intoxication through alcohol, drugs or other means.{{sfn |Gwynne |2017 |loc=The Buddhist Pancasila}}{{sfn |Wijayaratna |1990 |pages=166{{en dash}}7}} Early Buddhist Texts nearly always condemn alcohol, and so do Chinese Buddhist post-canonical texts. Buddhist attitudes toward smoking differ per time and region, but are generally permissive. In modern times, traditional Buddhist countries have seen revival movements to promote the five precepts. As for the West, the precepts play a major role in Buddhist organizations. They have also been integrated in [[mindfulness]] training programs, though many mindfulness specialists do not support this because of the precepts' religious import. Lastly, many conflict prevention programs make use of the precepts.

== Role in Buddhist doctrine ==
Buddhist scriptures explain the five precepts as the minimal standard of Buddhist morality.{{sfn |Gowans |2013 |page=440}} It is the most important system of morality in Buddhism, together with the [[Patimokkha|monastic rules]].&lt;ref name="Goodman"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Goodman |first1=Charles |title=Ethics in Indian and Tibetan Buddhism |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-indian-buddhism/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100708233552/http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-indian-buddhism/ |archive-date=8 July 2010 |dead-url=no |website=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, [[Stanford University]] |date=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Śīla]]'' (Sanskrit; {{lang-pi|sīla|italic=yes}}) is used to refer to Buddhist precepts,{{sfn|Edelglass|2013|p=479}} including the five.{{sfn |Getz |2004 |page=673}} But the word also refers to the virtue and morality which lies at the foundation of the spiritual path to [[enlightenment (Buddhism)|enlightenment]], which is the first of the [[Three Trainings|three forms of training]] on the path. Thus, the precepts are rules or guidelines to develop mind and character to make progress on the path to [[enlightenment (Buddhism)|enlightenment]].{{sfn |Getz |2004 |page=673}} The five precepts are part of the right speech, action and livelihood aspects of the [[eight-fold path]], the core teaching of Buddhism.{{sfn |Getz |2004 |page=673}}{{sfn|Powers |2013 |loc=āryāṣtāṅga-mārga }}{{refn |group=note |The fifth precept has also been connected with [[right mindfulness]].{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |p=77}}}} Moreover, the practice of the five precepts and other parts of ''śīla'' are described as forms of [[merit-making]], means to create good [[karma (Buddhism)|karma]].{{sfn |Osto |2015}}{{sfn |McFarlane |1997}} The five precepts have been described as [[value (ethics)|social values]] that bring harmony to society,{{sfn |Wijayaratna |1990 |pages=166{{en dash}}7}}{{sfn |De Silva |2016 |page=79 }} and breaches of the precepts described as antithetical to a harmonious society.{{sfn |Keown |2012 |page=31}} On a smilar note, in Buddhist texts, the ideal, righteous society is one in which people keep five precepts.{{sfn |Tambiah |1992 |page=121}}
[[File:Dharmachakra, withprint (en).svg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|The [[eight-fold path]], of which the five precepts are part.|alt=Wheel with eight spokes, with the different aspects of the Buddhist eight-fold written on them]]
Comparing different parts of Buddhist doctrine, the five precepts form the basis of the eight precepts, which are lay precepts stricter than the five precepts, similar to monastic precepts.{{sfn |Getz |2004 |page=673}}{{sfn |Cozort |2015}} Secondly, the five precepts form the first half of the [[bodhisattva Precepts|ten or eleven precepts]] for a [[bodhisattva|person aiming to become a Buddha]] (''[[bodhisattva]]''), as mentioned in the ''[[Brahmajala Sutra (Mahayana)|Brahmajala Sūtra]]'' of the Mahāyāna tradition.{{sfn |Getz |2004 |page=673}}{{sfn|Cozort |Shields |2018 |loc=Dōgen, The Bodhisattva Path according to the ''Ugra'' }}{{sfn |Funayama |2004 |page=98}} Contrasting these precepts with the five precepts, the latter were commonly referred to by Mahāyānists as the ''[[śrāvakayāna]]'' precepts, or the precepts of those aiming to become [[arhat|enlightened disciples]] of a Buddha, but not [[Buddha (title)|Buddhas]] themselves. The ten{{en dash}}eleven ''bodhisattva'' precepts presuppose the five precepts, and are partly based on them.{{sfn |Funayama|2004 |page=105}} The five precepts are also partly found in the teaching called the ten good courses of action, referred to in [[Theravāda]] ({{lang-pi|dasa-kusala-kammapatha|italic=yes}}) and [[Tibetan Buddhism]] ({{lang-sa |daśa-kuśala-karmapatha |italic=yes }}; {{bo|w=dge ba bcu|italic=yes}}).&lt;ref name="Goodman" /&gt;{{sfn |Keown |2005 |loc=Precepts}} Finally, the first four of the five precepts are very similar to the [[parajika|most fundamental rules of monastic discipline]], and may have influenced their development.{{sfn |Kohn |1994 |page=173}}

In conclusion, the five precept lie at the foundation of all Buddhist practice, and in that respect, can be compared with the [[ten commandments]] in Christianity{{sfn |Keown |2013b |page=638}}{{sfn |Wai |2002 |p=4}} or the [[li (Confucianism)|ethical codes]] of [[Confucianism]].{{sfn |Funayama |2004 |page=98}}

== History ==
[[File:Tang Dynasty circa 700 CE.png|thumb |In [[Tang Dynasty|8th-century China]], people held strict attitudes about abstinence of alcohol. |alt=Map marking part of China]]
The five precepts were part of [[early Buddhism]] and are common to nearly all schools of Buddhism.{{sfn|Keown |2003 |page=210 }} In early Buddhism, the five precepts were regarded as an ethic of restraint, to restrain unwholesome tendencies and thereby purify one's being to attain enlightenment.{{sfn |Terwiel |2012 |page=178}}{{sfn|Cozort |Shields |2018 |loc=Precepts in Early and Theravāda Buddhism}} The five precepts were based on the ''pañcaśīla'', prohibitions for pre-Buddhist [[Brahmanic]] priests, which were adopted in many Indic religions around 6th century BCE.{{sfn |Gombrich |2006 |page=78 }}{{sfn |Kohn |1994 |pages=171, 173}} The first four Buddhist precepts were nearly identical to these ''pañcaśīla'', but the fifth precept, the prohibition on intoxication, was new in Buddhism:{{sfn |Kohn |1994 |page=173}}{{refn |group=note |The 6th century CE [[Chandogya Upanishad|Chāndogya Upaniśad]] contains four principles identical to the Buddhist precepts, but lying is not mentioned.{{sfn |Tachibana |1992 |p=58}} In contemporary [[Jainism]], the fifth principle became "appropriation of any sort".{{sfn |Kohn |1994 |page=173}}}} the Buddha's emphasis on [[appamada|awareness]] ({{lang-pi|appamāda|italic=yes |links=no}}) was unique.{{sfn |Gombrich |2006 |page=78 }}

In some schools of ancient Indic Buddhism, Buddhist devotees could choose to adhere to only a number of precepts, instead of the complete five. The schools that would survive in later periods, however, that is Theravāda and Mahāyāna Buddhism, were both ambiguous about this practice. Some early Mahāyāna texts allow it, but some do not; [[Pāli Canon|Theravāda texts]] do not discuss this practice at all.{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |p=83}}

The prohibition on killing has motivated [[early Buddhism|early Buddhists]] to form a stance against animal sacrifice, a common ritual practice in ancient India.&lt;ref name="World Religions" /&gt;{{sfn|Mcdermott|1989|page=273}} According to the Pāli Canon, however, early Buddhists did not adopt a vegetarian lifestyle.{{sfn |Cozort |2015}}{{sfn|Mcdermott|1989|page=273}}

In [[Early Buddhist Texts]], the role of the five precepts gradually develops. First of all, the precepts are combined with a declaration of faith in the triple gem (the Buddha, [[dhamma|his teaching]] and [[sangha|the monastic community]]).&lt;!--173--&gt; Next, the precepts develop to become the foundation of lay practice.&lt;!--173-4--&gt;{{sfn |Kohn |1994 |pp=173{{en dash}}4}} The precepts are seen a preliminary condition for the higher development of the mind.{{sfn |Terwiel |2012 |p=178}} At a third stage in the texts, the precepts are actually mentioned together with the triple gem, as though they are part of it. Lastly, the precepts, together with the triple gem, become a required condition for the practice of Buddhism, as lay people have to undergo a formal initiation to become a member of the Buddhist religion.{{sfn |Kohn |1994 |p=173}} When Buddhism spread to different places and people, the role of the precepts began to vary. In countries in which Buddhism was adopted as the main religion without much competition from other religious disciplines, such as Thailand, the relation between the initiation of a lay person and the five precepts has been virtually non-existent, and the taking of the precepts has become a sort of ritual cleansing ceremony. In such countries, people are presumed Buddhist from birth without much of an initiation. The precepts are often committed to by new followers as part of their installment, yet this is not very pronounced. However, in some countries like China, where Buddhism was not the only religion, the precepts became an ordination ceremony to initiate lay people into the Buddhist religion.{{sfn |Terwiel |2012 |pp=178{{en dash}}9, 205}}

In China, the five precepts were introduced in the first centuries CE,&lt;!--171, 176--&gt; both in their ''śrāvakayāna'' and ''bodhisattva'' formats.&lt;!--175--&gt;{{sfn |Kohn |1994 |pages=171, 175{{en dash}}6}} During this time, it was particularly Buddhist teachers who promoted abstinence from alcohol (the fifth precept), since [[Daoism]] and other thought systems emphasized moderation rather than full abstinence. Chinese Buddhists interpreted the fifth precept strictly,&lt;!--p=223--&gt; even more so than in Indic Buddhism.&lt;!--p=226--&gt; For example, the monk [[Daoshi (Buddhist monk)|Daoshi]] ({{circa}} 600–83) dedicated large sections of [[Fayuan Zhulin|his encyclopedic writings]] to abstinence from alcohol.&lt;!--p=224--&gt; However, in some parts of China, such as [[Dunhuang]], considerable evidence has been found of alcohol consumption among both lay people and monastics.&lt;!--p=230--&gt; Later, from the 8th century onward, strict attitudes of abstinence led to a development of a distinct [[Chinese tea culture|tea culture]] among Chinese monastics and lay intellectuals, in which tea gatherings replaced gatherings with alcoholic beverages, and were advocated as such.&lt;!--214, 231--&gt;{{sfn |Benn |2005 |pages=214, 223{{en dash}}4, 226, 230{{en dash}}1}}{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |p=79}} These strict attitudes were formed partly because of the religious writings, but may also have been affected by the bloody [[An Lushan Rebellion]] of 775, which had a sobering effect on [[Tang dynasty|8th-century Chinese society]].{{sfn |Benn |2005 |page=231}} When the five precepts were integrated in Chinese society, they were associated and connected with karma,&lt;!--178--&gt; [[Wu Xing|Chinese cosmology]]&lt;!--176-7--&gt; and [[Chinese medicine|medicine]],&lt;!--184--&gt; a Daoist worldview,&lt;!--178--&gt; and [[Confucianism#Social morality and ethics|Confucian virtue ethics]].&lt;!--185--&gt;{{sfn |Kohn |1994 |pages=176{{en dash}}8, 184{{en dash}}5}}

== Ceremonies ==
=== In Pāli tradition ===
[[File:Buddhist monks giving a teaching or blessing to lay people.jpg|thumb|In Thailand, a leading lay person will normally request the monk to administer the precepts.|alt=Asian person holding hands in prayer, facing two monks in brown robes.]]
In the Theravāda tradition, the precepts are recited in a standardized fashion, using [[Pāli language]]. In Thailand, a leading lay person will normally request the monk to administer the precepts by reciting the following three times:

{{blockquote |"Venerables, we request the five precepts and the [[three refuges]] [i.e. the triple gem] for the sake of observing them, one by one, separately". ({{lang|pi |Mayaṃ bhante visuṃ visuṃ rakkhaṇatthāya tisaraṇena saha pañca sīlāniyācāma.}}){{sfn |Terwiel |2012 |pp=179{{en dash}}80}}}}

After this, the monk administering the precepts will recite a reverential line of text to introduce the ceremony, after which he guides the lay people in declaring that they take their refuge in the three refuges or triple gem.{{sfn |Terwiel |2012 |p=181}}

He then continues with reciting the five precepts:{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |p=67}}{{sfn|Ledgerwood|2008|page=152}}
# "I undertake the training-precept to abstain from onslaught on breathing beings." ({{lang-pi |Pāṇātipātā veramaṇī sikkhāpadaṃ samādiyāmi.|italic=yes}})
# "I undertake the training-precept to abstain from taking what is not given." ({{lang-pi |Adinnādānā veramaṇī sikkhāpadaṃ samādiyāmi.|italic=yes}})
# "I undertake the training-precept to abstain from misconduct concerning sense-pleasures." ({{lang-pi |Kāmesumicchācāra veramaṇī sikkhāpadaṃ samādiyāmi.|italic=yes}})
# "I undertake the training-precept to abstain from false speech." ({{lang-pi |Musāvādā veramaṇī sikkhāpadaṃ samādiyāmi.|italic=yes}})
# "I undertake the training-precept to abstain from alcoholic drink or drugs that are an opportunity for heedlessness." ({{lang-pi |Surāmerayamajjapamādaṭṭhānā veramaṇī sikkhāpadaṃ samādiyāmi.|italic=yes }})

In the fifth precept ''[[Sura (alcoholic beverage)|sura]]'', ''meraya'' and ''majja'' are kinds of alcoholic beverages. In some modern translations, ''Surāmerayamajjapamādaṭṭhānā'', is rendered more broadly, variously, as, ''intoxicants'' or ''liquor and drugs'', etc.&lt;!--not sourced, but not contentious--&gt;

After the lay people have repeated the five precepts after the monk, the monk will close the ceremony reciting:

{{blockquote |"These five precepts lead with good behavior to bliss, with good behavior to wealth and success, they lead with good behavior to happiness, therefore purify behavior." ({{lang|pi |Imāni pañca sikkhāpadāni. Sīlena sugatiṃ yanti, sīlena bhogasampadā, sīlena nibbutiṃ yanti, tasmā sīlaṃ visodhaye.}}){{sfn |Terwiel |2012 |p=182}}}}

The format of the ceremony for taking the precepts occurs several times in the [[Chinese Buddhist Canon]], in slightly different forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbeta.org/result/normal/T18/0916_001.htm |title=CBETA T18 No. 916|publisher=Cbeta.org |date= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120731133041/http://www.cbeta.org/result/normal/T18/0916_001.htm |archivedate=31 July 2012}}{{cite web |url=http://www.cbeta.org/result/normal/T24/1488_003.htm |title=CBETA T24 No. 1488|publisher=Cbeta.org |date=30 August 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120731134855/http://www.cbeta.org/result/normal/T24/1488_003.htm |archivedate=31 July 2012}}{{cite book|last1=Shih|first1=Heng-ching|title=The Sutra on Upāsaka Precepts|date=1994|publisher=Numata Center for Buddhist Translation and Research |isbn=978-0-9625618-5-6|url=http://www.bdkamerica.org/system/files/pdf/dBET_Alpha_T1488_SutraonUpasakaPrecepts_1994.pdf?file=1&amp;type=node&amp;id=454}}{{cite web |url=http://www.cbeta.org/result/normal/X60/1129_003.htm |title=CBETA 電子佛典集成 卍續藏 (X) 第 60 冊 No.1129 |publisher=Cbeta.org |date=30 August 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120731131701/http://www.cbeta.org/result/normal/X60/1129_003.htm |archivedate=31 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One formula of the precepts can be found in the ''Treatise on Taking Refuge and the Precepts'' ({{zh|s=归戒要集|t=歸戒要集|p=Guījiè Yāojí}}):

# As all Buddhas refrained from killing until the end of their lives, so I too will refrain from killing until the end of my life.
# As all Buddhas refrained from stealing until the end of their lives, so I too will refrain from stealing until the end of my life.
# As all Buddhas refrained from sexual misconduct until the end of their lives, so I too will refrain from sexual misconduct until the end of my life.
# As all Buddhas refrained from false speech until the end of their lives, so I too will refrain from false speech until the end of my life.
# As all Buddhas refrained from alcohol until the end of their lives, so I too will refrain from alcohol until the end of my life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=X60n1129_002 歸戒要集 第2卷 |url=http://tripitaka.cbeta.org/X60n1129_002?format=line&amp;linehead=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180824071744/http://tripitaka.cbeta.org/X60n1129_002?format=line&amp;linehead=yes |archive-date=24 August 2018 |dead-url=no |website=CBETA 電子佛典集成 |publisher=Cbeta.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, in the [[Mulasarvastivada|Mūla-Sarvāstivāda]] texts used in Tibetan Buddhism, the precepts are formulated such that one takes the precepts upon oneself for one's entire lifespan, following the examples of the enlightened disciples of the Buddha (''[[arahant]]'').{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |page=67 }}

The five precepts can be found in many places in the Early Buddhist Texts.{{sfn |Tedesco |2004 |p=91 }} The precepts are regarded as means to building good character, or as an expression of such character. The Pāli Canon describes them as means to avoid harm to oneself and others.{{sfn|MacKenzie|2017|page=2}} It further describes them as gifts toward oneself and others.{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |page=66 }} Moreover, the texts say that people who uphold them will be confident in any gathering of people,&lt;ref name="Goodman" /&gt;{{sfn |Tachibana |1992 |p=63}} will have wealth and a good reputation, and will die a peaceful death, reborn in heaven{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |page=67 }}{{sfn |Tachibana |1992 |p=63}} or as a [[Human beings in Buddhism|human being]]. On the other hand, living a life in violation of the precepts is believed to lead to rebirth in an [[Naraka (Buddhism)|unhappy destination]].&lt;ref name="Goodman" /&gt; They are understood as principles that define a person as human in body and mind.{{sfn |Wai |2002 |page=2}}

The precepts are normative rules, but are formulated and understood as "undertakings"{{sfn |Gombrich |2006 |page=66 }} rather than commandments enforced by a moral authority,{{sfn|Keown |2003 |page=268 }}{{sfn |Meadow |2006 |p=88 }} according to the voluntary and [[gradualism#Buddhism and other Oriental philosophies|gradualist]] standards of Buddhist ethics.{{sfn |Buswell |2004}} They are forms of restraint formulated in negative terms, but are also accompanied by virtues and positive behaviors,{{sfn |Gwynne |2017 |loc=The Buddhist Pancasila}}{{sfn |Wijayaratna |1990 |pages=166{{en dash}}7}}{{sfn |Cozort |2015}} which are cultivated through the practice of the precepts.{{sfn|Edelglass|2013|p=479}}{{refn |This dual meaning in negative formulations is typical for an Indic language like [[Sanskrit]].{{sfn |Keown |1998 |pages=399{{en dash}}400}}|group=note}} The most important of these virtues is [[ahimsa|non-harming]] ([[Pāli]] and {{lang-sa|ahiṃsa|italic=yes}}),&lt;ref name="World Religions"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Ahiṃsā |date=1997 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |encyclopedia=The Concise Oxford Dictionary of World Religions |via=Encyclopedia.com |url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/philosophy-and-religion/eastern-religions/hinduism/ahimsa |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180824071832/https://www.encyclopedia.com/philosophy-and-religion/eastern-religions/hinduism/ahimsa |archive-date=24 August 2018 |dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Keown|2013a |page=616}} which underlies all of the five precepts.{{sfn |Cozort |2015}}{{refn |group=note |However, anthropologist [[Melford Spiro]] argued that the fundamental virtue behind the precepts was [[mettā|loving-kindness]], not "the Hindu notion of non-violence".{{sfn |Spiro |1982 |p=45}}}} Precisely, the texts say that one should keep the precepts, adhering to the principle of comparing oneself with others:{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |pages=33, 71 }}
{{blockquote|"For a state that is not pleasant or delightful to me must be so to him also; and a state that is not pleasing or delightful to me, how could I inflict that upon another?"{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |page=33 }}}}

In other words, all living beings are alike in that they want to be happy and not suffer. Comparing oneself with others, one should therefore not hurt others as one would not want to be hurt.{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |p=120}} Ethicist Pinit Ratanakul argues that the compassion which motivates upholding the precepts comes from an understanding that all living beings are equal and of a nature that they are '[[anatman|not-self]]' ({{lang-pi|anattā|italic=yes}}).{{sfn |Ratanakul |2007 |page=241 }} Another aspect that is fundamental to this is the belief in karmic retribution.{{sfn |Horigan |1996 |page=276}}
[[File:Amber.pendants.800pix.050203.jpg|thumb|upright=.8 |A layperson who upholds the precepts is described in the texts as a "jewel among laymen". |alt=Two pendants of amber]]
In the upholding or violation of the precepts, [[cetana|intention]] is crucial.{{sfn|Mcdermott|1989|page=275}}{{sfn |Keown |1998 |page=386}} In the Pāli scriptures, an example is mentioned of a person stealing an animal only to [[life release|set it free]], which was not seen as an [[parajika|offense of theft]].{{sfn|Mcdermott|1989|page=275}} In the Pāli [[atthakatha|commentaries]], a precept is understood to be violated when the person violating it finds the object of the transgression (e.g. things to be stolen), is aware of the violation, has the intention to violate it, does actually act on that intention, and does so successfully.{{sfn |Leaman |2000 |page=139 }}

Upholding the precepts is sometimes distinguished in three levels: to uphold them without having formally undertaken them; to uphold them formally, willing to sacrifice one's own life for it; and finally, to spontaneously uphold them.{{sfn |Leaman |2000 |page=141 }} The latter refers to the ''arahant'', who is understood to be morally incapable of violating the first four precepts.{{sfn|Keown |2003 |page=1}} A layperson who upholds the precepts is described in the texts as a "jewel among laymen".{{sfn |De Silva |2016 |page=63 }} On the other hand, the most serious violations of the precepts are the [[Anantarika-karma|five actions of immediate retribution]], which are believed to lead the perpetrator to an unavoidable rebirth in [[hell (Buddhism)|hell]]. These consist of injuring a Buddha, killing an ''arahant'', killing one's father or mother, and causing the monastic community to have a schism.{{sfn |Cozort |2015}}

== Practice in general ==
Lay followers often undertake these training rules in the same ceremony as they [[taking refuge|take the refuges]].{{sfn |Getz |2004 |page=673}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Festivals and Calendrical Rituals |date=2004 |publisher=[[The Gale Group]] |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Buddhism |url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/religion/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/festivals-and-calendrical-rituals |archive-url=http://www.webcitation.org/71uE0BBbB |archive-date=24 August 2018 |dead-url=no |via=Encyclopedia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Monks administer the precepts to the laypeople, which creates an additional psychological effect.{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |p=80}} Buddhist lay people may recite the precepts regularly at home, and before an important ceremony at the temple to prepare the mind for the ceremony.{{sfn |Terwiel |2012 |pp=178{{en dash}}9}}{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |p=80}}
[[File:Thich Nhat Hanh 12.jpg|thumb |left |upright=.5 |[[Thich Nhat Hanh]] has written about the five precepts in a wider scope, with regard to social and institutional relations.|alt=Asian monk smiling]]
The five precepts are at the core of Buddhist morality.{{sfn|Ledgerwood|2008|page=152}} In field studies in some countries like Sri Lanka, villagers describe them as the core of the religion.{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |p=80}} Anthropologist {{ill |Barend Terwiel|de|Barend Jan Terwiel}} found in his fieldwork that most Thai villagers knew the precepts by heart, and many, especially the elderly, could explain the implications of the precepts following traditional interpretations.{{sfn |Terwiel |2012 |p=183}}

Nevertheless, Buddhists do not all follow them with the same strictness.{{sfn|Ledgerwood|2008|page=152}} Devotees who have just started keeping the precepts will typically have to exercise considerable restraint. When they become used to the precepts, they start to embody them more naturally.{{sfn|MacKenzie|2017|page=10}} Researchers doing field studies in traditional Buddhist societies have found that the five precepts are generally considered demanding and challenging.{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |p=80}}{{sfn |Gombrich |1995 |p=286 }} For example, in a 1997 survey in Thailand, only 13.8% of the respondents indicated they adhered to the five precepts in their daily lives, with the fourth and fifth precept least likely to be adhered to.{{sfn |Ariyabuddhiphongs |2009 |page=193}} Yet, people do consider the precepts worth striving for, and do uphold them out of fear of bad karma and being reborn in [[hell (Buddhism)|hell]], or because they believe in that the Buddha issued these rules, and that they therefore should be maintained.{{sfn |Terwiel |2012 |p=188}}{{sfn |Spiro |1982 |p=449}} Anthropologist [[Melford Spiro]] found that Burmese Buddhists mostly upheld the precepts to avoid bad karma, as opposed to expecting to gain good karma.{{sfn |Spiro |1982 |pp=99, 102}} Religion scholar Winston King observed from his field studies that the moral principles of Burmese Buddhists were based on personal self-developmental motives rather than other-regarding motives. Religion scholar Richard Jones concludes that the moral motives of Buddhists in adhering to the precepts are based on the idea that renouncing self-service, ironically, serves oneself.{{sfn |Jones |1979 |p=374}}

In East Asian Buddhism, the precepts are intrinsically connected with the initiation as a Buddhist lay person.&lt;!--81--&gt; Early Chinese translations such as the ''Upāsaka-śila Sūtra'' hold that the precepts should only be ritually transmitted by a monastic.&lt;!--80--&gt; The texts describe that in the ritual the power of the Buddhas and ''bodhisattvas'' is transmitted, and helps the initiate to keep the precepts.&lt;!--81--&gt; This "lay ordination" ritual usually occurs after a stay in a temple, and often after a [[upasampada|monastic ordination]] has taken place. The ordained lay person is then given a [[Dharma name|religious name]]. The restrictions that apply are similar to a monastic ordination, such as permission from parents.{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |pp=80{{en dash}}1}}

In the Theravāda tradition, the precepts are usually taken "each separately" ({{lang-pi|visuṃ visuṃ|italic=yes|link=no}}), to indicate that if one precept should be broken, the other precepts are still intact. In very solemn occasions, or for very pious devotees, the precepts may be taken as a group rather than each separately.{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |p=82}}{{sfn |Terwiel |2012 |p=180}} This does not mean, however, that only some of the precepts can be undertaken; they are always committed to as a complete set.{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |pp=82{{en dash}}3}} In East Asian Buddhism, however, the vow of taking the precepts is considered a solemn matter, and it is not uncommon for lay people to undertake only the precepts that they are confident they can keep.{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |p=83}} The act of taking a vow to keep the precepts is what makes it karmically effective: Spiro found that someone who did not violate the precepts, but did not have any intention to keep them either, was not believed to accrue any religious merit. On the other hand, when people took a vow to keep the precepts, and then broke them afterwards, the negative karma was considered larger as in the case no vow was taken to keep the precepts.{{sfn |Spiro |1982 |p=217}}

Several modern teachers such as [[Thich Nhat Hanh]] and [[Sulak Sivaraksa]] have written about the five precepts in a wider scope, with regard to social and institutional relations. In these perspectives, mass production of weapons or spreading untruth through media and education also violate the precepts.{{sfn |Queen |2013 |page=532}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Engaged Buddhism |date=2005 |publisher=[[Thomson Gale]] |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Religion |url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/environment/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/engaged-buddhism |archive-url=http://www.webcitation.org/71uE9MCNL |archive-date=24 August 2018 |dead-url=no |via=Encyclopedia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; On a similar note, human rights organizations in Southeast Asia have attempted to advocate respect for human rights by referring to the five precepts as guiding principles.{{sfn|Ledgerwood|2008|page=154}}

== First precept ==
=== Textual analysis ===
[[File:Haft.jpg|thumb|The first of the five precepts includes abstention from killing small animals such as insects.|alt=Mayfly on human finger]]
The first precept prohibits the taking of life of a [[sentient being (Buddhism)|sentient being]].

Killing a large animal is worse than killing a small animal&lt;!--272--&gt;&lt;!--Harvey--&gt; (also because it costs more effort); killing a spiritually accomplished master is regarded as more severe than the killing of another "more average" human being;&lt;!--p=272--&gt; and killing a human being is more severe than the killing an animal.&lt;!--Harvey--&gt; But all killing is condemned.&lt;!--p=272--&gt;{{sfn |Leaman |2000 |page=139 }}{{sfn|Mcdermott|1989|pages=271–2}}{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |page=156}} Virtues that accompany this precept are respect for dignity of life,{{sfn|Keown|2013a |page=616}} [[metta|kindness]] and [[karuṇā|compassion]],{{sfn |Cozort |2015}} the latter expressed as "trembling for the welfare of others".{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |p=68}} A positive behavior that goes together with this precept is protecting living beings.{{sfn |Wijayaratna |1990 |pages=166{{en dash}}7}} Positive virtues like sympathy and respect for other living beings in this regard are based on a belief in the [[samsara|cycle of rebirth]]{{em dash}}that all living beings must be born and reborn.{{sfn |Wai|2002|p=293}} The concept of the fundamental [[Buddha nature]] of all human beings also underlies the first precept.{{sfn |Horigan |1996 |page=275}}

The description of the first precept can be interpreted as a prohibition of capital punishment.{{sfn |Alarid |Wang |2001 |pages=236{{en dash}}7}} Suicide is also seen as part of the prohibition.{{sfn |Wai |2002 |p=11}} Moreover, abortion goes against the precept, since in an act of abortion, the criteria for violation are all met.&lt;ref name="BBC" /&gt;{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |pp=313{{en dash}}4}} In Buddhism, human life is understood to start at conception.{{sfn |Keown |2016a |p=206}} A prohibition of abortion is mentioned explicitly in the monastic precepts,&lt;!--164--&gt; and several Buddhist tales warn of the harmful [[karma (Buddhism)|karmic]] consequences of abortion.&lt;!--157-63--&gt;{{sfn |Mcdermott |2016 |pp=157{{en dash}}64}}{{sfn |Perrett |2000 |page=101}} Bioethicist [[Damien Keown]] argues that Early Buddhist Texts do not allow for exceptions with regard to abortion, as they consist of a "consistent' (i.e. exceptionless) pro-life position".{{sfn |Keown |2016a |p=209}}{{sfn |Perrett |2000 |page=110}} Keown further proposes that that a middle way approach to the five precepts is logically hard to defend.{{sfn |Keown |2016a |p=205}} Asian studies scholar Giulo Agostini argues, however, that Buddhist commentators in India from the 4th century onward thought abortion did not break the precepts under certain circumstances.{{sfn |Agostini |2004 |pages=77{{en dash}}8}}

Ordering another person to kill is also included in this precept,{{sfn |Keown |2016b |page=170}}{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |p=69}} therefore requesting or administering euthanasia can be considered a violation of the precept,{{sfn |Keown |2016b |page=170}} as well as advising another person to commit abortion.{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |p=314}} With regard to [[euthanasia]] and [[assisted suicide]], Keown quotes the Pāli ''[[Digha Nikaya|Dīgha Nikāya]]'' that says a person upholding the first precept "does not kill a living being, does not cause a living being to be killed, does not approve of the killing of a living being".{{sfn |Keown |1998 |p=400}} Keown argues that in Buddhist ethics, regardless of motives, death can never be the aim of one's actions.{{sfn |Keown |1998 |p=402}}

Interpretations of how Buddhist texts regard warfare are varied, but in general Buddhist doctrine is considered to oppose all warfare. In many ''Jātaka'' tales, such as that of [[Adhiṭṭhāna#Temiya the Wise|Prince Temiya]], as well as some historical documents, the virtue of non-violence is taken as an opposition to all war, both offensive and defensive.&lt;!--51-2--&gt; At the same time, though, the Buddha is often shown not to explicitly oppose war in his conversations with political figures. Buddhologist [[André Bareau]] points out that the Buddha was reserved in his involvement of the details of administrative policy, and concentrated on the moral and spiritual development of his disciples instead.&lt;!--50--&gt; He may have believed such involvement to be futile, or detrimental to Buddhism.&lt;!--51--&gt; Nevertheless, at least one disciple of the Buddha is mentioned in the texts who refrained from retaliating his enemies because of the Buddha, that is King [[Pasenadi]] ({{lang-sa|Prasenajit|link=no}}). The texts are ambiguous in explaining his motives though.&lt;!--51--&gt;{{sfn |Schmithausen |1999 |pages=50{{en dash}}2}} In some later Mahāyāna texts, such as in the writings of [[Asaṅga]], examples are mentioned of people who kill those who persecute Buddhists.{{sfn |Schmithausen |1999 |pages=57{{en dash}}59}}{{sfn |Jones |1979 |p=380}} In these examples, killing is justified by the authors because protecting Buddhism was seen as more important than keeping the precepts.&lt;!--380--&gt; Another example that is often cited is that of King [[Dutthagamani|Duṭṭhagāmaṇī]], who is mentioned in the post-canonical Pāli [[Mahavamsa|Mahāvaṃsa]] chronicle. In the chronicle, the king is saddened with the loss of life after a war, but comforted by a Buddhist monk, who states that nearly everyone who was killed did not uphold the precepts anyway.&lt;!--385--&gt;{{sfn |Jones |1979 |pp=380, 385 n.2}}{{sfn |Schmithausen |1999 |pages=56{{en dash}}7}} Buddhist studies scholar [[Lambert Schmithausen]] argues that in many of these cases Buddhist teachings like that of [[emptiness (Buddhism)|emptiness]] were misused to further an agenda of war or other violence.{{sfn |Schmithausen |1999 |pages=60{{en dash}}2}}

[[File:Vegmark.PNG|thumb|In Buddhism, there are different opinions about whether vegetarianism should be practiced.{{sfn |Cozort |2015}} |alt=Signals used to indicate vegetarian or non-vegetarian food]]
Field studies in Cambodia and Burma have shown that many Buddhists considered the first precept the most important, or the most blamable.{{sfn|Ledgerwood|2008|page=152}}{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |p=69}} In some traditional communities, such as in [[Kandal Province]] in pre-war Cambodia, as well as Burma in the 1980s, it was uncommon for Buddhists to slaughter animals, to the extent that meat had to be bought from not-Buddhists.{{sfn|Ledgerwood|2008|page=152}}{{sfn |Spiro |1982 |p=45}} In his field studies in Thailand in the 1960s, Terwiel found that villagers did tend to kill insects, but were reluctant and self-conflicted with regard to killing larger animals.{{sfn |Terwiel |2012 |p=186}} In Spiro's field studies, however, Burmese villagers were highly reluctant even to kill insects.{{sfn |Spiro |1982 |p=45}}

Early Buddhists did not adopt a [[vegetarianism in Buddhism|vegetarian lifestyle]].&lt;!--cited above--&gt; Indeed, in several Pāli [[sutra|texts]] vegetarianism is described as irrelevant in the spiritual purification of the mind. There are prohibitions on certain types of meat, however, especially those which are condemned by society.&lt;!--p=274--&gt; The idea of abstaining from killing animal life has also led to a prohibition on professions that involve trade in flesh or living beings, but not to a full prohibition of all agriculture that involves cattle.&lt;!--p=276--&gt;{{sfn|Mcdermott|1989|pages=273–4, 276}} In modern times, referring to the [[law of supply and demand]] or other principles, some Theravādin Buddhists have attempted to promote vegetarianism as part of the five precepts. For example, the Thai [[Santi Asoke]] movement practices vegetarianism.{{sfn |Meadow |2006 |p=88 }}{{sfn |Swearer |2010 |page=177}}

Furthermore, among some schools of Buddhism, there has been some debate with regard to a principle in the monastic discipline. This principle states that a Buddhist monk cannot accept meat if it comes from animals especially slaughtered for him. Some teachers have interpreted this to mean that when the recipient has no knowledge on whether the animal has been killed for him, he cannot accept the food either. Similarly, there has been debate as to whether laypeople should be vegetarian when adhering to the five precepts.{{sfn |Cozort |2015}} Though vegetarianism among Theravādins is generally uncommon, it has been practiced much in East Asian countries,{{sfn |Cozort |2015}} as some Mahāyāna texts, such as the ''[[Mahaparinirvana Sutra|Mahāparanirvana Sūtra]]'' and the ''[[Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra]]'', condemn the eating of meat.{{sfn |Gwynne |2017 |loc=The Buddhist Pancasila}}{{sfn |Kieschnick |2005 |page=196}} Nevertheless, even among Mahāyāna Buddhists{{em dash}}and East Asian Buddhists{{em dash}}there is disagreement on whether vegetarianism should be practiced. In the ''Laṅkāvatāra Sūtra'', biological, social and hygienic reasons are given for a vegetarian diet; however, historically, a major factor in the development of a vegetarian lifestyle among Mahāyāna communities may have been that Mahāyāna monastics cultivated their own crops for food, rather than living from [[alms#Buddhism|alms]].{{sfn |Gwynne |2017 |loc=Ahiṃsa and Samādhi}} Already from the 4th century CE, Chinese writer [[Xi Chao]] understood the five precepts to include vegetarianism.{{sfn |Kieschnick |2005 |page=196}}

[[File:Dalai Lama 1430 Luca Galuzzi 2007crop.jpg|thumb |upright=.6 |The [[Dalai Lama]] has rejected forms of protest that are self-harming.{{sfn |Buswell |2004}}|alt=The Dalai Lama]]
Apart from trade in flesh or living beings, there are also other professions considered undesirable. Vietnamese teacher Thich Nhat Hanh gives a list of examples, such as working in the arms industry, the military, police, producing or selling poison or drugs such as alcohol and tobacco.{{sfn |Johansen |Gopalakrishna |2016 |page=341 }}

In general, the first precept has been interpreted by Buddhists as a call for non-violence and pacifism. But there have been some exceptions of people who did not interpret the first precept as an opposition to war. For example, in the twentieth century, some Japanese Zen teachers wrote in support of violence in war, and some of them argued this should be seen as a means to uphold the first precept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title={{nowrap|Religions - }}Buddhism: War |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/buddhism/buddhistethics/war.shtml |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180824071857/http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/buddhism/buddhistethics/war.shtml |archive-date=24 August 2018 |dead-url=no |website=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is some debate and controversy surrounding the problem whether a person can commit suicide, such as [[self-immolation]], to reduce other people's suffering in the long run, such as in protest to improve a political situation in a country. Teachers like the [[Dalai Lama]] and [[Lu Sheng-Yen|Shengyan]] have rejected forms of protest like self-immolation, as well as other acts of self-harming or fasting as forms of protest.{{sfn |Buswell |2004}}

Although capital punishment goes against the first precept, as of 2001, many countries in Asia still maintained the death penalty, including Sri Lanka, Thailand, China and Taiwan.&lt;!--239-41--&gt; In some Buddhist countries, such as Sri Lanka and Thailand, capital punishment was applied during some periods, while during other periods no capital punishment was used at all.&lt;!--239--&gt; In other countries with Buddhism, like China and Taiwan, Buddhism, or any religion for that matter, has had no influence in policy decisions of the government.&lt;!--240-1--&gt; Countries with Buddhism that have abolished capital punishment include Cambodia and Hong Kong.&lt;!--244 n.1--&gt;{{sfn |Alarid |Wang |2001 |pages=239{{en dash}}41, 244 n.1}}

In general, Buddhist traditions oppose abortion.{{sfn |Agostini |2004 |pages=77{{en dash}}8}} In many countries with Buddhist traditions such as Thailand, Taiwan, Korea and Japan, however, abortion is a widespread practice, whether legal or not.&lt;!--101--&gt; Many people in these countries consider abortion immoral, but also think it should be less prohibited. Ethicist Roy W. Perrett, following Ratanakul, argues that this field research data does not so much indicate hypocrisy, but rather points at a "middle way" in applying Buddhist doctrine to solve a [[moral dilemma]]. Buddhists tend to take "both sides" on the pro-life{{en dash}}pro-choice debate, being against the taking of life of a fetus in principle, but also believing in compassion toward mothers. Similar attitudes may explain the Japanese ''[[mizuko kuyō]]'' ceremony, a Buddhist memorial service for aborted children,&lt;!--102--&gt; which has led to a debate in Japanese society concerning abortion, and finally brought the Japanese to a consensus that abortion should not be taken lightly, though it should be legalized.&lt;!--103, 109--&gt; This position, held by Japanese Buddhists, takes the middle ground between the Japanese [[Shinto#Post-war|neo-Shinto]] "pro-life" position, and the [[Sex-positive feminism|liberationist]], "pro-choice" arguments.{{sfn |Perrett |2000 |pages=101{{en dash}}3, 109}} Keown points out, however, that this compromise does not mean a Buddhist [[middle way]] between two extremes, but rather incorporates two opposite perspectives.{{sfn |Keown |2016a |p=205}} In Thailand, women who wish to have abortion usually do so in the early stages of pregnancy, because they believe the karmic consequences are less then. Having had abortion, Thai women usually make merits to compensate for the negative karma.{{sfn |Ratanakul |1998 |p=57}}

The second precept prohibits theft, and involves the intention to steal what one perceives as not belonging to oneself ("what is not given") and acting successfully upon that intention. The severity of the act of theft is judged by the worth of the owner and the worth of that which is stolen. Underhand dealings, fraud, cheating and forgery are also included in this precept.{{sfn |Leaman |2000 |page=139 }}{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |p=70}} Accompanying virtues are [[dana (Buddhism)|generosity]], [[nekkhamma|renunciation]],{{sfn |Gwynne |2017 |loc=The Buddhist Pancasila}}{{sfn |Cozort |2015}} and [[right livelihood]],{{sfn |Wai |2002 |p=3}} and a positive behavior is the protection of other people's property.{{sfn |Wijayaratna |1990 |pages=166{{en dash}}7}}

Borrowing without permission is sometimes included,{{sfn |Meadow |2006 |p=88 }}{{sfn |Terwiel |2012 |p=183}} as well as gambling.{{sfn |Terwiel |2012 |p=183}}{{sfn |Ratanakul |2007 |page=253 }} Psychologist Vanchai Ariyabuddhiphongs did studies in the 2000s and 2010s in Thailand and discovered that people who did not adhere to the five precepts more often tended to believe that money was the most important goal in life, and would more often pay bribes than people who did adhere to the precepts.{{sfn |Ariyabuddhiphongs |Hongladarom |2011 |pages=338{{en dash}}9}}{{sfn |Ariyabuddhiphongs |2007 |page=43}} On the other hand, people who observed the five precepts regarded themselves as wealthier and happier than people who did not observe the precepts.{{sfn |Jaiwong |Ariyabuddhiphongs |2010 |page=337}}

Professions that are seen to violate the second precept include working in the gambling industry or marketing products that are not actually required for the customer.{{sfn |Johansen |Gopalakrishna |2016 |page=342 }}

== Third precept ==
=== Textual analysis ===
The third precept condemns adultery with women that are "claimed" or "acquired", or, in other words, it condemns "going with the wife of another". The precept also includes women who are engaged with another man, young women that are still "protected by any relative", and women who are prostitutes. Moreover, rape and incest are also breaches of this precept.{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |pp=71{{en dash}}2}} In later texts, details such as intercourse at an inappropriate time or inappropriate place are also counted as breaches of the third precept.{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |p=73}} Masturbation goes against the spirit of the precept, though in the early texts it is not prohibited for laypeople.{{sfn |Leaman |2000 |page=140 }}{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |p=72}}

The third precept is explained as leading to greed in oneself and harm to others. The transgression is regarded as more severe if the other person is a good person.{{sfn |Leaman |2000 |page=140 }}{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |p=72}} Virtues that go hand-in-hand with the third precept are contentment, especially with one's partner,{{sfn |Cozort |2015}}{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |p=68}} and recognition and respect for faithfulness in a marriage.{{sfn |Wijayaratna |1990 |pages=166{{en dash}}7}}

=== In practice ===
&lt;!--Disabling this picture: there is no room for it yet.[[File:Plaquettes de pilule.jpg|thumb |upright=.7 |The third precept is usually not connected with a stance against contraception.{{sfn |Buswell |2004}}|alt=Contraception pills]]--&gt;
The third precept is interpreted as avoiding to harm another by using sensuality in the wrong way. This means not engaging with inappropriate partners, but also respecting one's personal commitment to a relationship.{{sfn |Meadow |2006 |p=88 }} In some traditions, the precept also condemns adultery with a woman when her husband agrees with the act, since the nature of the act itself is condemned.&lt;!--only Harvey--&gt; Furthermore, flirting with a married woman may also be regarded as a violation.&lt;!--both--&gt;{{sfn |Terwiel |2012 |p=183}}{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |pp=71{{en dash}}2}} Though prostitution is discouraged in the third precept, it is usually not actively prohibited by Buddhist teachers.{{sfn |Derks |1998}} With regard to applications of the principles of the third precept, the precept, or any Buddhist principle for that matter, is usually not connected with a stance against contraception.&lt;ref name="Bioethics"&gt;{{cite book |title=Eugenics and Religious Law: IV.

In the interpretation of modern teachers, the precept includes any person in a sexual relationship with another person, as they define the precept by terms such as ''sexual responsibility'' and ''long-term commitment''.{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |pp=71{{en dash}}2}} Some modern teachers include masturbation as a violation of the precept,{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |p=74}} others include certain professions, such as those that involve sexual exploitation, prostitution or pornography, and professions that promote unhealthy sexual behavior, such as in the entertainment industry.{{sfn |Johansen |Gopalakrishna |2016 |page=342 }}

== Fourth precept ==
=== Textual analysis ===
[[File:Woman working behind computer.jpg|thumb|alt=Woman working behind computer.|thumb |Work that involves online scams can also be included as a violation of the fourth precept.]]

The fourth precept involves falsehood spoken or committed to by action.{{sfn |Leaman |2000 |page=140 }} Avoiding other forms of wrong speech are also considered part of this precept, consisting of malicious speech, harsh speech and gossip.{{sfn |Segall |2003 |page=169}}{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |pp=74, 76}} A breach of the precept is considered more serious if the falsehood is motivated by an ulterior motive{{sfn |Leaman |2000 |page=140 }} (rather than, for example, "a small white lie").{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |p=75}} The accompanying virtue is [[Sacca#Truth as an ethical practice|being honest]] and dependable,{{sfn |Cozort |2015}}{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |p=68}} and involves honesty in work, truthfulness to others, loyalty to superiors and gratitude to benefactors.{{sfn |Wai |2002 |p=3}} In Buddhist texts, this precept is considered most important next to the first precept, because a lying person is regarded to have no shame, and therefore capable of many wrongs.{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |p=74}} Untruthfulness is not only to be avoided because it harms others, but also because it goes against the Buddhist ideal of finding the [[truth in Buddhism|truth]].{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |p=75}}{{sfn |Wai |2002|p=295}}

=== In practice ===
The fourth precept includes avoidance of lying and harmful speech.{{sfn|Powers |2013 |loc=pañca-śīla }} Some modern teachers such as Thich Nhat Hanh interpret this to include avoiding spreading false news and uncertain information.{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |p=74}} Work that involves data manipulation, false advertising or online scams can also be regarded as violations.{{sfn |Johansen |Gopalakrishna |2016 |page=342 }} Terwiel reports that among Thai Buddhists, the fourth precept is also seen to be broken when people insinuate, exaggerate or speak abusively or deceitfully.{{sfn |Terwiel |2012 |p=183}}

== Fifth precept ==
=== Textual analysis ===
[[File:Red Wine Glass.jpg|thumb|The fifth precept prohibits intoxication through alcohol, drugs or other means.{{sfn |Gwynne |2017 |loc=The Buddhist Pancasila}}|alt=Glass of red wine |upright=.3]]
The fifth precept prohibits intoxication through alcohol, drugs or other means, and its virtues are [[mindfulness (Buddhism)|mindfulness]] and responsibility,{{sfn |Gwynne |2017 |loc=The Buddhist Pancasila}}{{sfn |Wijayaratna |1990 |pages=166{{en dash}}7}} applied to [[Temperance (virtue)|food]], work, behavior, and with regard to the [[reality in Buddhism|nature of life]].{{sfn |Wai |2002 |p=3}} Awareness, meditation and [[Appamada|heedfulness]] can also be included here.{{sfn |Gwynne |2017 |loc=Ahiṃsa and Samādhi}} Medieval Pāli commentator [[Buddhaghosa]] writes that whereas violating the first four precepts may be more or less blamable depending on the person or animal affected, the fifth precept is always "greatly blamable", as it hinders one from understanding the Buddha's teaching and may lead one to "madness".{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |p=77}} In ancient China, Daoshi described alcohol as the "doorway to laxity and idleness" and as a cause of suffering. Nevertheless, he did describe certain cases when drinking was considered less of a problem, such as in the case of a queen distracting the king by alcohol to prevent him from murder.&lt;!--page=224--&gt; However, Daoshi was generally strict in his interpretations: for example, he allowed medicinal use of alcohol only in extreme cases.&lt;!--p=227--&gt;{{sfn |Benn |2005 |pages=224, 227}} Early Chinese translations of the [[Tripitaka]] describe negative consequences for people breaking the fifth precept, for themselves and their families. The Chinese translation of the ''Upāsikaśila Sūtra'', as well as the Pāli version of the [[Sigalovada Sutta|Sigālovāda Sutta]], speak of ill consequences such as loss of wealth, ill health, a bad reputation and "stupidity", concluding in a rebirth in hell.{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |p=77}}{{sfn |Benn |2005 |page=225}} The ''[[Dīrghāgama]]'' adds to that that alcohol leads to quarreling, negative states of mind and damage to one's intelligence.&lt;!--p=225--&gt; The Mahāyāna ''[[Brahmajala Sutra|Brahmajāla Sūtra]]''{{refn |Not to be confused with the early Buddhist [[Brahmajala Sutta]]. |group=note}} describes the dangers of alcohol in very strong terms, including the selling of alcohol.&lt;!--p=226--&gt;{{sfn |Benn |2005 |pages=225{{en dash}}6}} Similar arguments against alcohol can be found in [[Nāgārjuna]]'s writings.{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |p=78}} The strict interpretation of prohibition of alcohol consumption can be supported by the ''Upāli Sūtra''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s statement that a disciple of the Buddha should not drink any alcohol, "even a drop on the point of a blade of grass".&lt;!--p=78--&gt; However, in the writing of some [[Abhidharma]] commentators, consumption was condemned or condoned, depending on the intention with which alcohol was consumed.&lt;!--78-9--&gt;{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |pp=78{{en dash}}9}}

=== In practice ===
As for the fifth precept, this is regarded as important, because drinking alcohol is condemned for the sluggishness and lack of self-control it leads to,{{sfn|Mcdermott|1989|page=275}}{{sfn |Tachibana |1992 |p=62}} which might lead to breaking the other precepts.{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |p=77}} In Spiro's field studies, violating the fifth precept was seen as the worst of all the five precepts by half of the monks interviewed, citing the harmful consequences.{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |p=77}} Nevertheless, in practice it is often disregarded by lay people.{{sfn |Neumaier |2006 |page=78}} In Thailand, drinking alcohol is fairly common, even drunkenness.{{sfn |Terwiel |2012 |p=185}} Among Tibetans, drinking beer is common, though this is only slightly alcoholic.{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |p=78}} Medicinal use of alcohol is generally not frowned upon,{{sfn |Gombrich |1995 |p=298 }} and in some countries like Thailand and Laos, smoking is usually not regarded as a violation of the precept. Thai and Laotian monks have been known to smoke, though monks who have received more training are less likely to smoke.{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |p=79}}{{sfn |Vanphanom |Phengsavanh |Hansana |Menorath |2009 |page=100}} On a similar note, as of 2000, no Buddhist country prohibited the sale or consumption of alcohol, though in Sri Lanka Buddhist revivalists attempted unsuccessfully to get a full prohibition passed in 1956.{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |p=79}} Moreover, pre-Communist Tibet used to prohibit smoking in some areas of the capital. Monks were prohibited from smoking, and the import of tobacco was banned.{{sfn |Harvey |2000 |p=79}}

Thich Nhat Hanh also includes the aspect of mindful consumption in this precept, which consists of unhealthy food, unhealthy entertainment and unhealthy conversations, among others.{{sfn |Johansen |Gopalakrishna |2016 |page=342 }}{{sfn |Kaza |2000 |page=24}}

== Present trends ==
[[File:Desiré Oliveros - P1130527.jpg|thumb|upright |Some scholars have proposed that the five precepts be introduced as a component in mindfulness training programs. |alt=Woman giving a workshop in a classroom]]
In modern times, adherence to the precepts among Buddhists is less strict than it traditionally was. This is especially true for the third precept. For example, in Cambodia in the 1990s and 2000s, standards with regard to sexual restraint were greatly relaxed.{{sfn|Ledgerwood|2008|page=153}} Some Buddhist movements and communities have tried to go against the modern trend of less strict adherence to the precepts. In Cambodia, a [[Faith in Buddhism#Millenarianism|millenarian movement]] led by [[Chan Yipon]] promoted the revival of the five precepts.{{sfn|Ledgerwood|2008|page=153}} And in the 2010s, the [[Supreme Sangha Council]] in Thailand ran a nationwide program called "[[Wat Paknam Bhasicharoen#Teachings|The Villages Practicing the Five Precepts]]", aiming to encourage keeping the precepts, with an extensive classification and reward system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=15 October 2013 |work=[[Khao Sod]] |publisher=Matichon Publishing |page=31 |language=th |script-title=สมเด็จวัดปากน้ำชงหมูบ้านรักษาศีล 5 ให้อปท.ชวนประชาชนยึดปฎิบัติ |trans-title=Wat Paknam's Somdet proposes the Five Precept Village for local administrators to persuade the public to practice}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|script-title=39 ล้านคนร่วมหมู่บ้านศีล 5 สมเด็จพระมหารัชมังคลาจารย์ ย้ำทำต่อเนื่อง|trans-title=39 million people have joined ''Villages Practicing Five Precepts'', Somdet Phra Maharatchamangalacharn affirms it should be continued|url=https://www.thairath.co.th/content/969738|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171121085832/https://www.thairath.co.th/content/969738|archive-date=21 November 2017|deadurl=no|work=[[Thai Rath]]|publisher=Wacharapol|date=11 March 2017|language=th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many Western Buddhist organizations, the five precepts play a major role in developing ethical guidelines.{{sfn |Bluck |2006 |page=193}} Furthermore, Buddhist teachers such as [[Philip Kapleau]], Thich Nhat Hanh and [[Robert Baker Aitken|Robert Aitken]] have promoted mindful consumption in the West, based on the five precepts.{{sfn |Kaza |2000 |page=24}} In another development in the West, some scholars working in the field of [[mindfulness]] training have proposed that the five precepts be introduced as a component in such trainings. Specifically, to prevent organizations from using mindfulness training to further an economical agenda with harmful results to its employees, the economy or the environment, the precepts could be used as a standardized ethical framework.&lt;!--p=957--&gt; As of 2015, several training programs made explicit use of the five precepts as secular, ethical guidelines.&lt;!--pp=958-9--&gt; However, many mindfulness training specialists consider it problematic to teach the five precepts as part of training programs in secular contexts because of their religious origins and import.&lt;!--pp=965-6--&gt;{{sfn |Baer |2015 |pages=957{{en dash}}9, 965{{en dash}}6}}

[[peace and conflict studies|Peace studies]] scholar Theresa Der-lan Yeh notes that the five precepts address physical, economical, familial and verbal aspects of interaction, and remarks that many conflict prevention programs in schools and communities have integrated the five precepts in their curriculum. On a similar note, peace studies founder [[Johan Galtung]] describes the five precepts as the "basic contribution of Buddhism in the creation of peace".{{sfn |Yeh |2006 |p=100}}

Studying lay and monastic ethical practice in traditional Buddhist societies, Spiro argued ethical guidelines such as the five precepts are adhered to as a means to a higher end, that is, a better rebirth or enlightenment. He therefore concluded that Buddhist ethical principles like the five precepts are similar to Western [[utilitarianism]].{{sfn |Buswell |2004}} Keown, however, has argued that the five precepts are regarded as rules that cannot be violated, and therefore may indicate a [[deontological]] perspective in Buddhist ethics.{{sfn|Keown|2013a |page=618}}{{sfn |Keown |2013b |page=643}} On the other hand, he has suggested that Aristoteles' [[virtue ethics]] could apply as well, since the precepts are considered good in themselves, and mutually dependent on other aspects of the Buddhist path of practice.{{sfn |Buswell |2004}}{{sfn|Edelglass|2013|p=481}}

=== Comparison with human rights ===
Keown has further argued that the five precepts are very similar to human rights, with regard to subject matter and with regard to their universal nature.{{sfn |Keown |2012 |pages=31{{en dash}}4}} Other scholars, as well as Buddhist writers and human rights advocates, have drawn similar comparisons.{{sfn |Ledgerwood |Un |2010 |pages=540{{en dash}}1}}{{sfn |Seeger |2010 |p=78}} For example, the following comparisons are drawn:
# Keown compares the first precept with the [[right to life]].{{sfn |Keown |2012 |p=33}} The Buddhism-informed Cambodian Institute for Human Rights (CIHR) draws the same comparison.{{sfn |Ledgerwood |Un |2010 |p=540}}
# The second precept is compared by Keown and the CIHR with the right of property.{{sfn |Keown |2012 |p=33}}{{sfn |Ledgerwood |Un |2010 |p=540}}
# The third precept is compared by Keown to the "right to fidelity in marriage";{{sfn |Keown |2012 |p=33}} the CIHR construes this broadly as "right of individuals and the rights of society".{{sfn |Ledgerwood |Un |2010 |p=541}}
# The fourth precept is compared by Keown with the "right not to be lied to";{{sfn |Keown |2012 |p=33}} the CIHR writes "the right of human dignity".{{sfn |Ledgerwood |Un |2010 |p=541}}
# Finally, the fifth precept is compared by the CIHR with the right of individual security and a safe society.{{sfn |Ledgerwood |Un |2010 |p=541}}

Keown summarizes the relationship between Buddhist precepts and human rights as "look[ing] both ways along the juridical relationship, both what one is due to do, and to what is due to one".{{sfn |Ledgerwood |Un |2010 |p=541}}{{sfn |Keown |2012 |p=21}} On a similar note, Cambodian human rights advocates have argued that for human rights to be fully implemented in society, the strengthening of individual morality must also be addressed.{{sfn |Ledgerwood |Un |2010 |p=541}} Buddhist monk and scholar [[P.A. Payutto|Phra Payutto]] sees the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights|Human Rights Declaration]] as an unfolding and detailing of the principles that are found in the five precepts, in which a sense of ownership is given to the individual, to make legitimate claims on one's rights.&lt;!--78--&gt; He believes that human rights should be seen as a part of human development,&lt;!--85, 88--&gt; in which one develops from [[śīla|moral discipline]] ({{lang-pi|sīla|italic=yes |link=no}}), to [[samadhi|concentration]] ({{lang-pi|samādhi|italic=yes |link=no}}) and finally [[paññā|wisdom]] ({{lang-pi|paññā|italic=yes |link=no}}).&lt;!--85--&gt; He does not believe, however, that human rights are [[natural rights]], but rather human conventions.&lt;!--79--&gt; Buddhism scholar Somparn Promta disagrees with him. He argues that human beings do have natural rights from a Buddhist perspective, and refers to the ''attūpanāyika-dhamma'', a teaching in which the Buddha prescribes a kind of [[golden rule]] of comparing oneself with others.&lt;!--79-80--&gt; (''See [[#Principles|§Principles]], above.'') From this discourse, Promta concludes that the Buddha has laid down the five precepts in order to protect individual rights such as right of life and property:&lt;!--80--&gt; human rights are implicit within the five precepts. Academic Buntham Phunsap argues, however, that though human rights are useful in culturally pluralistic societies, they are in fact not required when society is based on the five precepts. Phunsap therefore does not see human rights as part of Buddhist doctrine.&lt;!--86--&gt;{{sfn |Seeger |2010 |pp=78{{en dash}}80, 85{{en dash}}6, 88}}

'''Habitat fragmentation''' describes the emergence of discontinuities (fragmentation) in an organism's preferred [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]] ([[Habitat (ecology)|habitat]]), causing [[population fragmentation]] and  [[ecosystem decay]]. Causes of habitat fragmentation include [[geological]] processes that slowly alter the layout of the physical environment&lt;ref name="SahneyBentonFerry2010LinksDiversityVertebrates"&gt;

(suspected of being [[allopatric speciation|one of the major causes]] of [[speciation]]&lt;ref name="SahneyBentonFerry2010LinksDiversityVertebrates"/&gt;),and human activity such as [[Conservation development |land conversion]], which can alter the environment much faster and causes the [[extinction]] of many species.

[[Image:Amazonie deforestation.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Deforestation]] and increased [[Deforestation of the Amazon Rainforest |road-building in the Amazon Rainforest]] are a significant concern because of increased human encroachment upon wild areas, increased resource-extraction and further threats to [[biodiversity]].]]

==Definition==
The term habitat fragmentation includes five discrete phenomena:
* Reduction in the total area of the habitat
* Decrease of the interior: [[edge effect|edge]] ratio
* Isolation of one habitat fragment from other areas of habitat
* Breaking up of one patch of habitat into several smaller patches
* Decrease in the average size of each patch of habitat

"fragmentation ... not only causes loss of the amount of habitat, but by creating small, isolated patches it also changes the properties of the remaining habitat" (van den Berg et al. 2001){{Failed verification|date=April 2018}}. Habitat fragmentation is the landscape level of the phenomenon, and patch level process. Thus meaning, it covers; the patch areas, edge effects, and patch shape complexity.&lt;ref&gt;van den Berg LJL, Bullock JM, Clarke RT, Langsten RHW, Rose RJ. 2001. Territory selection by the Dartford warbler (Sylvia undata) in Dorset, England: the role of vegetation type, habitat fragmentation and population size. Biol. Conserv. 101:217-28
&lt;/ref&gt;

In scientific literature, there is some debate whether the term "habitat fragmentation" applies in cases of habitat loss, or whether the term primarily applies to the phenomenon of habitat being cut into smaller pieces without significant reduction in habitat area. Scientists who use the stricter definition of "habitat fragmentation" per se&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; would refer to loss of habitat area as "habitat loss" and explicitly mention both terms if describing a situation where the habitat becomes less connected and there is less overall habitat.

== Causes ==

===Natural causes===
Evidence of [[habitat destruction]] through natural processes such as [[volcanism]], fire, and [[climate change]] is found in the fossil record.&lt;ref name="SahneyBentonFerry2010LinksDiversityVertebrates"/&gt;{{Failed verification|date=February 2018}} For example, [[Carboniferous rainforest collapse|habitat fragmentation of tropical rainforests in Euramerica]] 300 million years ago led to a great loss of amphibian diversity, but simultaneously the drier climate spurred on a burst of diversity among reptiles.&lt;ref name="SahneyBentonFerry2010LinksDiversityVertebrates"/&gt;

===Human causes===
Habitat fragmentation is frequently caused by humans when [[native plant]]s is cleared for human activities such as [[agriculture]], [[Subdivision (land)|rural development]], [[urbanization]] and the creation of [[hydroelectric]] reservoirs. Habitats which were once continuous become divided into separate fragments. After intensive clearing, the separate fragments tend to be very small islands isolated from each other by cropland, pasture, pavement, or even barren land. The latter is often the result of [[slash and burn]] farming in [[tropical forest]]s. In the wheat belt of central western [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]], 90% of the native vegetation has been cleared and over 99% of the [[tall grass prairie]] of [[North America]] has been cleared, resulting in extreme habitat fragmentation.

=== Endogenous vs. exogenous  ===
There are two types of processes that can lead to habitat fragmentation. There are exogenous processes and endogenous processes. Endogenous are process that develop as a part of a species biology so they typically include changes in biology, behavior and interactions within or between species. Endogenous threats can result in changes to breeding patterns or migration patterns and are often triggered by exogenous processes. Exogenous processes are independent of species biology and can include habitat degradation, habitat subdivision or habitat isolation. These processes can have a substantial impact on endogenous processes by fundamentally altering species behavior. Habitat subdivision or isolation can lead to changes in dispersal or movement of species including changes to seasonal migration. These changes can lead to decrease in a density of species, increased competition or even increased predation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fischer|first1=Joern|last2=Lindenmayer|first2=David B.|date=February 7, 2007|title=Landscape Modification and Habitat Fragmentation: A synthesis|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1466-8238.2007.00287.x|journal=Global Ecology and Biogeography|volume=16|issue=3|pages=265–280|doi=10.1111/j.1466-8238.2007.00287.x|accessdate=March 22, 2018|ref=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implications ==

=== Habitat Loss and Biodiversity ===
One of the major ways that habitat fragmentation affects [[biodiversity]] is by reducing the amount of suitable habitat available for organisms. Habitat fragmentation often involves both [[habitat destruction]] and the subdivision of previously continuous habitat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fahrig|first1=Lenore|title=Effects of Habitat Fragmentation on Biodiversity|journal=Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics|date=November 2003|volume=34|issue=1|pages=487–515|doi=10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.34.011802.132419}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plants and other [[Sessility (zoology)|sessile]] organisms are disproportionately affected by some types of habitat fragmentation because they cannot respond quickly to the altered spatial configuration of the habitat.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lienert|first1=Judit|title=Habitat fragmentation effects on fitness of plant populations – a review|journal=Journal for Nature Conservation|date=July 2004|volume=12|issue=1|pages=53–72|doi=10.1016/j.jnc.2003.07.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Habitat loss, which can occur through the process of habitat fragmentation, is considered to be the greatest threat to species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wilcove | first1 = David S. | display-authors = 1 | last2 = et al | year = 1998 | title = Quantifying Threats to Imperiled Species in the United States | jstor = 1313420 | journal = BioScience | volume = 48 | issue = 8| pages = 607–615 | doi=10.2307/1313420}}&lt;/ref&gt; But, the effect of the configuration of habitat patches within the landscape, independent of the effect of the amount of habitat within the landscape (referred to as fragmentation per se&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fahrig | first1 = L | year = 2003 | title = Effects of habitat fragmentation on biodiversity | url = | journal = Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics | volume = 34 | issue = | pages = 487–515 | doi=10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.34.011802.132419}}&lt;/ref&gt;), has been suggested to be small.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fahrig | first1 = L | year = 2013 | title = Rethinking patch size and isolation effects: the habitat amount hypothesis | url = | journal = J. Biogeogr. | volume = 40 | issue = | pages = 1649–1663 | doi = 10.1111/jbi.12130 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A review of empirical studies found that, of the 381 reported significant effect of habitat fragmentation per se on species occurrences, abundances or diversity in the scientific literature, 76% were positive whereas 24% were negative.&lt;ref name="Fahrig2017"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fahrig | first1 = L | year = 2017 | title = Ecological Responses to Habitat Fragmentation Per Se | url = | journal = Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics | volume = 48 | issue = | pages = 1–23 | doi = 10.1146/annurev-ecolsys-110316-022612 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these results, the scientific literature tends to emphasize negative effects more than positive effects.&lt;ref&gt;Fahrig, L. (2018) Forty years of biais in habitat fragmentation research, In: Effective Conservation Science: Data Not Dogma (Edited by Kareiva, Marvier and Silliman), Oxford University Press, United Kingdom&lt;/ref&gt; Positive effects of habitat fragmentation per se imply that several small patches of habitat can have higher conservation value than a single large patch of equivalent size.&lt;ref name="Fahrig2017" /&gt; Land sharing strategies could therefore have more positive impacts on species than land sparing strategies.&lt;ref name="Fahrig2017" /&gt;[[File:Indiana Dunes Habitat Fragmentation.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Habitat fragmented by numerous roads near the [[Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore]].]]
Area is the primary determinant of the number of species in a fragment&lt;ref name = Rosenzweig&gt;{{cite book | last = Rosenzweig | first = Michael L. | authorlink = Michael Rosenzweig | title = Species diversity in space and time | year = 1995 | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]] | location = Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the relative contributions of demographic and genetic processes to the risk of global population extinction depend on habitat configuration, stochastic environmental variation and species features.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Robert | first1 = A | year = 2011 | title = Find the weakest link. A comparison between demographic, genetic and demo-genetic metapopulation extinction times | url = | journal = BMC Evolutionary Biology | volume = 11 | issue = | page = 260 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2148-11-260 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Minor fluctuations in climate, resources, or other factors that would be unremarkable and quickly corrected in large populations can be catastrophic in small, isolated populations. Thus fragmentation of habitat is an important cause of species extinction.&lt;ref name = Rosenzweig/&gt; Population dynamics of subdivided populations tend to vary [[wikt:asynchronous|asynchronous]]ly. In an unfragmented landscape a declining population can be "rescued" by immigration from a nearby expanding population. In fragmented landscapes, the distance between fragments may prevent this from happening. Additionally, unoccupied fragments of habitat that are separated from a source of [[Colonisation (biology)|immigrants]] by some barrier are less likely to be repopulated than adjoining fragments. Even small species such as the [[Columbia spotted frog]] are reliant on the rescue effect. Studies showed 25% of juveniles travel a distance over 200m compared to 4% of adults. Of these, 95% remain in their new locale, demonstrating that this journey is necessary for survival.&lt;ref name = Funk&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Funk W.C. |author2=Greene A.E. |author3=Corn P.S. |author4=Allendorf F.W. | year = 2005 | title = High dispersal in a frog species suggests that it is vulnerable to habitat fragmentation | url = | journal = [[Biology Letters|Biol. Lett.]] | volume = 1 | issue = 1| pages = 13–6 | doi=10.1098/rsbl.2004.0270}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, habitat fragmentation leads to [[edge effect]]s. Microclimatic changes in light, temperature and wind can alter the ecology around the fragment, and in the interior and exterior portions of the fragment. [[wildfire|Fires]] become more likely in the area as humidity drops and temperature and wind levels rise. Exotic and pest species may establish themselves easily in such disturbed environments, and the proximity of domestic animals often upsets the natural ecology. Also, habitat along the edge of a fragment has a different climate and favours different species from the interior habitat. Small fragments are therefore unfavourable for species which require interior habitat. The percentage preservation of contiguous habitats is closely related to both genetic and species biodiversity preservation.  Generally a 10% remnant contiguous habitat will result in a 50% [[biodiversity loss]].&lt;ref&gt;Quammen, David (1997), "The Song of the Dodo: Island Biogeography in an Age of Extinction" (Scribner)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Informed Conservation===
Habitat fragmentation is often a cause of species becoming [[threatened]] or [[endangered]]. The existence of viable habitat is critical to the survival of any species, and in many cases the fragmentation of any remaining habitat can lead to difficult decisions for conservation biologists. Given a limited amount of resources available for conservation is it preferable to protect the existing isolated patches of habitat or to buy back land to get the largest possible continuous piece of land. In rare cases a [[conservation reliant species]] may gain some measure of disease protection by being distributed in isolated habitats.  This ongoing debate is often referred to as [[SLOSS debate|SLOSS]] (Single Large or Several Small).

One solution to the problem of habitat fragmentation is to link the fragments by preserving or planting [[Habitat corridor|corridors]] of native vegetation. In some cases, a bridge or underpass may be enough to join two fragments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wildlife Crossings: Animals survive with bridges and tunnels|url=http://www.wilderutopia.com/environment/wildlife/wildlife-crossings-animals-survive-bridges-tunnels/|publisher=Wilder Eutopia|accessdate=19 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has the potential to mitigate the problem of isolation but not the loss of interior habitat.

Another mitigation measure is the enlargement of small remnants in order to increase the amount of interior habitat. This may be impractical since developed land is often more expensive and could require significant time and effort to restore.

The best solution is generally dependent on the particular species or ecosystem that is being considered. More mobile species, like most birds, do not need connected habitat while some smaller animals, like rodents, may be more exposed to predation in open land. These questions generally fall under the headings of [[metapopulation]]s [[island biogeography]].

=== Genetic Risks ===
As the remaining habitat patches are smaller, they tend to support smaller populations of fewer species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Simberloff|first1=Daniel|date=1 January 1998|title=Small and Declining Populations|journal=Conservation Science and Action|language=en|publisher=Blackwell Publishing Ltd.|pages=116–134|doi=10.1002/9781444313499.ch6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Small populations are at an increased risk of a variety of genetic consequences that influence their long-term survival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Introduction to conservation genetics|last1=Frankham|first1=Richard|last2=Ballou|first2=Jonathan D.|last3=Briscoe|first3=David A.|date=2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521702713|edition=2nd|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt; Remnant populations often contain only a subset of the [[genetic diversity]] found in the previously continuous habitat.  Processes that act upon underlying genetic diversity such as [[adaptation]] have a smaller pool of fitness-maintaining alleles to survive in the face of environmental change.

==== Gene Flow and Inbreeding ====
[[Gene flow]] occurs when individuals of the same species exchange genetic information through reproduction. Populations can maintain genetic diversity through [[Animal migration|migration]]. When a habitat becomes fragmented and reduced in area, gene flow and migration is typically reduced. Fewer individuals will migrate into the remaining fragments, and small disconnected populations that may have once been part of a single large population will become reproductively isolated. Scientific evidence that gene flow is reduced due to fragmentation depends on the study species. While trees that have long-range pollination and dispersal mechanisms may not experience reduced gene flow following fragmentation,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=KRAMER|first=ANDREA T.|last2=ISON|first2=JENNIFER L.|last3=ASHLEY|first3=MARY V.|last4=HOWE|first4=HENRY F.|date=2008-06-09|title=The Paradox of Forest Fragmentation Genetics|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1523-1739.2008.00944.x|journal=Conservation Biology|language=en|volume=22|issue=4|pages=878–885|doi=10.1111/j.1523-1739.2008.00944.x|issn=0888-8892}}&lt;/ref&gt; most species are at risk of reduced gene flow following habitat fragmentation.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Reduced gene flow, and reproductive isolation can result in [[inbreeding]] between related individuals. Inbreeding does not always result in negative fitness consequences, but when inbreeding is associated with fitness reduction it is called [[inbreeding depression]]. Inbreeding becomes of increasing concern as the level of [[homozygosity]] increases, facilitating the expression of deleterious alleles that reduce the fitness. Habitat fragmentation can lead to inbreeding depression for many species due to reduced gene flow.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pavlova|first=Alexandra|last2=Beheregaray|first2=Luciano B.|last3=Coleman|first3=Rhys|last4=Gilligan|first4=Dean|last5=Harrisson|first5=Katherine A.|last6=Ingram|first6=Brett A.|last7=Kearns|first7=Joanne|last8=Lamb|first8=Annika M.|last9=Lintermans|first9=Mark|date=2017-05-11|title=Severe consequences of habitat fragmentation on genetic diversity of an endangered Australian freshwater fish: A call for assisted gene flow |journal=Evolutionary Applications|language=en|volume=10|issue=6|pages=531–550|doi=10.1111/eva.12484|issn=1752-4571|pmc=5469170|pmid=28616062}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wang|first=W|last2=Qiao|first2=Y|last3=Li|first3=S|last4=Pan|first4=W|last5=Yao|first5=M|date=2017-02-15|title=Low genetic diversity and strong population structure shaped by anthropogenic habitat fragmentation in a critically endangered primate, Trachypithecus leucocephalus|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/hdy20172|journal=Heredity |volume=118|issue=6|pages=542–553|doi=10.1038/hdy.2017.2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Inbreeding depression is associated with conservation risks, like local extinction.

==== Genetic Drift ====
Small populations are more susceptible to [[genetic drift]]. Genetic drift is random changes to the genetic make up of populations and always leads to reductions in genetic diversity. The smaller the population is, the more likely genetic drift will be a driving force of evolution rather than natural selection. Because genetic drift is a random process, it does not allow species to become more adapted to their environment. Habitat fragmentation is associated with increases to genetic drift in small populations which can have negative consequences for the genetic diversity of the populations.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==== Adaptation ====
In order for populations to evolve in response to natural selection, they must be large enough that natural selection is a stronger evolutionary force than genetic drift. Recent studies on the impacts of habitat fragmentation on adaptation in some plant species have suggested that organisms in fragmented landscapes may be able to adapt to fragmentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Matesanz|first=Silvia|last2=Teso|first2=Rubio|last3=Luisa|first3=María|last4=García-Fernández|first4=Alfredo|last5=Escudero|first5=Adrián|date=2017|title=Habitat Fragmentation Differentially Affects Genetic Variation, Phenotypic Plasticity and Survival in Populations of a Gypsum Endemic|url=https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2017.00843/full|journal=Frontiers in Plant Science|language=English|volume=8|doi=10.3389/fpls.2017.00843|issn=1664-462X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dubois|first=Jonathan|last2=Cheptou|first2=Pierre-Olivier|date=2017-01-19|title=Effects of fragmentation on plant adaptation to urban environments|url=http://rstb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/372/1712/20160038|journal=Phil.

=== Effect on Animal Behaviours===
Although the way habitat fragmentation affects the genetics and extinction rates of species has been heavily studied, fragmentation has also been shown to affect species' behaviours and cultures as well. This is important because social interactions have the ability to determine and have an effect on a species' fitness and survival. Habitat fragmentation alters the resources available and the structure of habitats, as a result alters the behaviours of species and the dynamics between differing species. Behaviours affected can be within a species such as reproduction, mating, foraging, species dispersal, communication and movement patterns or can be behaviours between species such as predator prey relationships. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Banks |first1=Sam C |last2=Piggott |first2=Maxine P |last3=Stow |first3=Adam J |last4=Taylor |first4=Andrea C |title=Sex and sociality in a disconnected world: a review of the impacts of habitat fragmentation on animal social interactions |journal=NRC Canada |date=2007 |volume=85 |page=1065-1079 |doi=10.1139/Z07-094}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==== Predation Behaviours ====
Habitat fragmentation due to anthropogenic activities has been shown to greatly affect the predator-prey dynamics of many species by altering the amount of species and the members of those species. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Banks |first1=Sam C |last2=Piggott |first2=Maxine P |last3=Stow |first3=Adam J |last4=Taylor |first4=Andrea C |title=Sex and sociality in a disconnected world: a review of the impacts of habitat fragmentation on animal social interactions |journal=NRC Canada |date=2007 |volume=85 |page=1065-1079 |doi=10.1139/Z07-094}}&lt;/ref&gt; This affects the natural predator-prey relationships between animals in a given community &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Banks |first1=Sam C |last2=Piggott |first2=Maxine P |last3=Stow |first3=Adam J |last4=Taylor |first4=Andrea C |title=Sex and sociality in a disconnected world: a review of the impacts of habitat fragmentation on animal social interactions |journal=NRC Canada |date=2007 |volume=85 |page=1065-1079 |doi=10.1139/Z07-094}}&lt;/ref&gt; and forces them to alter their behaviours and interactions, therefore resetting the so called "behavioral space race" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shneider |first1=Michael F |title=Habitat loss, fragmentation and predator impact: spatial implications for prey conservation |journal=Journal of Applied Ecology |date=2001 |volume=38 |page=720-735}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The way in which fragmentation changes and re-shapes these interactions can occur in many different forms. Most prey species have patches of land that are refuge from their predators, allowing them the safety to reproduce and raise their young. Human introduced structures such as roads and pipelines alter these areas by facilitating predator activity in these refuges, increasing predator-prey overlap &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shneider |first1=Michael F |title=Habitat loss, fragmentation and predator impact: spatial implications for prey conservation |journal=Journal of Applied Ecology |date=2001 |volume=38 |page=720-735}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The opposite could also occur in the favour of prey, increasing prey refuge and subsequently decreasing predation rates. Fragmentation may also increase predator abundance or predator efficiency and therefore increase predation rates in this manner &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shneider |first1=Michael F |title=Habitat loss, fragmentation and predator impact: spatial implications for prey conservation |journal=Journal of Applied Ecology |date=2001 |volume=38 |page=720-735}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Several other factors can also increase or decrease the extent to which the shifting predator-prey dynamics affect certain species, including how diverse a predators diet is and how flexible habitat requirements are for predators and prey &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Banks |first1=Sam C |last2=Piggott |first2=Maxine P |last3=Stow |first3=Adam J |last4=Taylor |first4=Andrea C |title=Sex and sociality in a disconnected world: a review of the impacts of habitat fragmentation on animal social interactions |journal=NRC Canada |date=2007 |volume=85 |page=1065-1079 |doi=10.1139/Z07-094}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Depending on which species are affected and these other factors, fragmentation and its resulting effects on predator-prey dynamics may contribute to a species extinction &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Banks |first1=Sam C |last2=Piggott |first2=Maxine P |last3=Stow |first3=Adam J |last4=Taylor |first4=Andrea C |title=Sex and sociality in a disconnected world: a review of the impacts of habitat fragmentation on animal social interactions |journal=NRC Canada |date=2007 |volume=85 |page=1065-1079 |doi=10.1139/Z07-094}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In response to these new environmental pressures, new adaptive behaviours may be developed. Prey species may adapt to increased risk of predation with strategies such as altering mating tactics or changing behaviours and activities related to food and foraging &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Banks |first1=Sam C |last2=Piggott |first2=Maxine P |last3=Stow |first3=Adam J |last4=Taylor |first4=Andrea C |title=Sex and sociality in a disconnected world: a review of the impacts of habitat fragmentation on animal social interactions |journal=NRC Canada |date=2007 |volume=85 |page=1065-1079 |doi=10.1139/Z07-094}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In the boreal woodland caribous of British Columbia the effects of fragmentation are clearly demonstrated.

These features have allowed their natural predators, the wolf and the black bear to more efficiently travel over landscapes and between patches of land&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=DeMars |first1=Craig A |last2=Boutin |first2=Stan |title=Nowhere to hide: Effects of linear features on predator -prey dynamics in a large mammal system |journal=Journal of Animal Ecology |date=September 4, 2017 |volume=87 |page=274-284 |doi=10.1111/1365-2656.12760}}&lt;/ref&gt;.Since their predators can more easily access the caribous' refuge, the females of the species attempt to avoid the area, affecting their reproductive behaviours and offspring produced&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=DeMars |first1=Craig A |last2=Boutin |first2=Stan |title=Nowhere to hide: Effects of linear features on predator -prey dynamics in a large mammal system |journal=Journal of Animal Ecology |date=September 4, 2017 |volume=87 |page=274-284 |doi=10.1111/1365-2656.12760}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
==== Communication Behaviours ====
Fragmentation affecting the communication behaviours of birds has been well studied in Dupont's Lark. The Larks primarily reside in regions of Spain and are a small passerine bird which use songs as a means of cultural transmission between members of the species &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=DeMars |first1=Craig A |last2=Boutin |first2=Stan |title=Nowhere to hide: Effects of linear features on predator -prey dynamics in a large mammal system |journal=Journal of Animal Ecology |date=September 4, 2017 |volume=87 |page=274-284 |doi=10.1111/1365-2656.12760}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The Larks have two distinct vocalizations, the song and the territorial call. The territorial call is used by males to defend and signal territory from other male Larks and is shared between neighbouring territories when males respond to a rivals song &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Laiolo |first1=Paola |last2=Tella |first2=José L |title=Habitat fragmentation affects culture transmission: patterns of song matching in Dupont's lark |journal=Journal of Applied Ecology |date=2005 |volume=42 |page=1183-1193 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2664.2005.01093.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Occasionally it is used as a threat signal to signify an impending attack on territory &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Laiolo |first1=Paola |last2=Tella |first2=José L |title=Erosion of animal cultures in fragmented landscapes |journal=The Ecological Society of America |date=2007 |volume=5 |issue=2 |page=68-72}}&lt;/ref&gt;. A large song repertoire can enhance a males ability to survive and reproduce as he has a greater ability to defend his territory from other males, and a larger number of males in the species means a larger variety of songs being transmitted &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Laiolo |first1=Paola |last2=Tella |first2=José L |title=Habitat fragmentation affects culture transmission: patterns of song matching in Dupont's lark |journal=Journal of Applied Ecology |date=2005 |volume=42 |page=1183-1193 |doi=10.1111/j.1365-2664.2005.01093.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Fragmentation of the Dupont's Lark territory from agriculture, forestry and urbanization appears to have a large effect on their communication structures &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Laiolo |first1=Paola |last2=Tella |first2=José L |title=Erosion of animal cultures in fragmented landscapes |journal=The Ecological Society of America |date=2007 |volume=5 |issue=2 |page=68-72}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Males only perceive territories of a certain distance to be rivals and so isolation of territory from others due to fragmentation leads to a decrease in territorial calls as the males no longer have any reason to use it or have any songs to match &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Laiolo |first1=Paola |last2=Tella |first2=José L |title=Erosion of animal cultures in fragmented landscapes |journal=The Ecological Society of America |date=2007 |volume=5 |issue=2 |page=68-72}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
== Forest fragmentation ==
{{Commons category|Forest fragmentation}}
Forest fragmentation is a form of habitat fragmentation where forests are reduced (either naturally or man-made) to relatively small, isolated patches of forest known as forest fragments or forest remnants.&lt;ref name= "SahneyBentonFerry2010LinksDiversityVertebrates"/&gt; The intervening matrix that separates the remaining woodland patches can be natural open areas, [[farmland]], or developed areas. Following the principles of [[island biogeography]], remnant woodlands act like islands of forest in a sea of pastures, fields, subdivisions, shopping malls, etc. These fragments will then begin to undergo the process of [[ecosystem decay]].

Forest fragmentation also includes less subtle forms of discontinuities such as utility right-of-ways (ROWs). Utility ROWs are of ecological interest because they have become pervasive in many forest communities, spanning areas as large as 5 million acres in the United States.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Russell|first=K. N.|last2=Ikerd|first2=H.|last3=Droege|first3=S.|date=2005-07-01|title=The potential conservation value of unmowed powerline strips for native bees|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006320705000467|journal=Biological Conservation|volume=124|issue=1|pages=133–148|doi=10.1016/j.biocon.2005.01.022}}&lt;/ref&gt; Utility ROWs include electricity transmission ROWs, gas pipeline and telecommunication ROWs. Electricity transmission ROWs are created to prevent vegetation interference with transmission lines. Some studies have shown that electricity transmission ROWs harbor more plant species than adjoining forest areas,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wagner|first=David L.|last2=Metzler|first2=Kenneth J.|last3=Leicht-Young|first3=Stacey A.|last4=Motzkin|first4=Glenn|date=2014-09-01|title=Vegetation composition along a New England transmission line corridor and its implications for other trophic levels|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378112714002655|journal=Forest Ecology and Management|volume=327|pages=231–239|doi=10.1016/j.foreco.2014.04.026}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to alterations in the microclimate in and around the corridor. Discontinuities in forest areas associated with utility right-of-ways can serve as biodiversity havens for native bees &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and grassland species,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lampinen|first=Jussi|last2=Ruokolainen|first2=Kalle|last3=Huhta|first3=Ari-Pekka|date=2015-11-13|title=Urban Power Line Corridors as Novel Habitats for Grassland and Alien Plant Species in South-Western Finland|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0142236|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=10|issue=11|pages=e0142236|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0142236|issn=1932-6203|pmc=4643934|pmid=26565700}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the right-of-ways are preserved in an early successional stage.

=== Implications ===
Forest fragmentation is one of the greatest threats to [[biodiversity]] in forests, especially in the tropics.&lt;ref name = Bierregaard&gt;{{cite book | last = Bierregaard | first = Richard | editor=Claude Gascon |editor2=Thomas E. Lovejoy |editor3=Rita Mesquita | year = 2001 | title = Lessons from Amazonia: The Ecology and Conservation of a Fragmented Forest | isbn = 0-300-08483-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The problem of [[habitat destruction]] that caused the fragmentation in the first place is compounded by:
* the inability of individual forest fragments to support viable populations, especially of large vertebrates
* the local [[extinction]] of species that do not have at least one fragment capable of supporting a viable population
* [[edge effect]]s that alter the conditions of the outer areas of the fragment, greatly reducing the amount of true forest interior habitat.&lt;ref name = Harris&gt;{{cite book | last = Harris | first = Larry D. | year = 1984 | title =  The Fragmented Forest: Island Biogeography Theory and the Preservation of Biotic Diversity | publisher = The University of Chicago Press |isbn = 0-226-31763-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effect of fragmentation on the [[flora]] and [[fauna]] of a forest patch depends on a) the size of the patch, and b) its degree of isolation.  Isolation depends on the distance to the nearest similar patch, and the contrast with the surrounding areas.  For example, if a cleared area is [[reforestation|reforested]] or allowed to [[natural regeneration|regenerate]], the increasing [[structural diversity]] of the [[vegetation]] will lessen the isolation of the forest fragments.  However, when formerly forested lands are converted permanently to pastures, agricultural fields, or human-inhabited developed areas, the remaining forest fragments, and the biota within them, are often highly isolated.

Forest patches that are smaller or more isolated will lose species faster than those that are larger or less isolated.  A large number of small forest "islands" typically cannot support the same biodiversity that a single contiguous forest would hold, even if their combined area is much greater than the single forest. However, forest islands in rural landscapes greatly increase their biodiversity.&lt;ref&gt;Banaszak J. (ed.) 2000. Ecology of Forest Islands. Bydgoszcz University Press, Bydgoszcz, Poland, 313 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Approaches to understanding habitat fragmentation ==
Two approaches that are typically used to understand habitat fragmentation and its ecological impacts.

=== Species-oriented approach ===
The species-oriented approach focuses specifically on individual species and how they each respond to their environment and habitat changes with in it.
This approach can be limited because it does only focus on individual species and does not allow for a broad view of the impacts of habitat fragmentation across species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fischer|first1=Joern|last2=Lindenmayer|first2=David B.|title=Landscape Modification and Habitat Fragmentation: A synthesis|journal=Global Ecology and Biogeography|date=February 7, 2007|volume=16|issue=3|pages=265–280|doi=10.1111/j.1466-8238.2007.00287.x|url=https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1466-8238.2007.00287.x|accessdate=March 22, 2018|ref=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Pattern-oriented approach ====

The pattern-oriented approach is based on land cover and its patterning in correlation with species occurrences. One model of study for landscape patterning is the patch-matrix-corridor model developed by [[Richard Forman]] The pattern-oriented approach focuses on land cover defined by human means and activities. This model has stemmed from [[island biogeography]] and tries to infer causal relationships between the defined landscapes and the occurrence of species or groups of species within them. The approach has limitations in its collective assumptions across species or landscapes which may not account for variations amongst them.&lt;ref&gt;Fischer, Joern &amp; B. Lindenmayer, David. (2007). Landscape modification and habitat fragmentation: a synthesis. Global Ecology and Biogeography. 16. 265-280. 10.1111/j.1466-8238.2007.00287.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Variegation Model ====

The other model is the variegation model. Variegated landscapes retain much of their natural vegetation but are intermixed with gradients of modified habitat &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Landscape Ecology and Landscape Change|url=http://www.veac.vic.gov.au/reports/Chapter%202%20-%20Landscape%20Ecology%20and%20Landscape%20Change.pdf|accessdate=March 22, 2018|ref=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This model of habitat fragmentation typically applies to landscapes that are modified by agriculture. In contrast to the fragmentation model that is denoted by isolated patches of habitat surrounded by unsuitable landscape environments, the variegation model applies to landscapes modified by agriculture where small patches of habitat remain near the remnant original habitat. In between these patches are a matrix of grassland that are often modified versions of the original habitat. These areas do not present as much of a barrier to native species.&lt;ref&gt;McIntyre, S., and G. W. Barrett. “Habitat Variegation, An Alternative to Fragmentation.” Conservation Biology, vol. 6, no. 1, 1992, pp. 146–147. JSTOR, JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/2385863.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hans-Martin Sass''' (born December 1935), is a [[bioethicist]].
He is a [[Professor Emeritus]] of [[Philosophy]] at [[Ruhr University]], [[Bochum, Germany]], and a Senior Research Scholar Emeritus at the [[Kennedy Institute of Ethics]] at [[Georgetown University]], [[Washington DC]].&lt;ref&gt;http://kennedyinstitute.georgetown.edu/scholars/sass.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
He holds academic positions at [[People's University of China]] and [[Peking Union Medical College]] in [[Beijing, China]], and at the [[Bochum Center for Medical Ethics]], which he helped found in 1985, in Bochum, Germany. He is editor of the ''[[Ethik in der Praxis]] / Practical Ethics'' series at Lit Verlag (Münster, Germany) and the [[Medizinethische Materialien]], Bochum.  He is the author of over 250 articles and books. He was a member of the [[International Bioethics Committee of UNESCO]] and is a member of many international and national advisory bodies and to philosophical and bioethical journals.

An expert in European continental philosophy, he has published widely on [[Hegel]], [[Marx]], 19th- and 20th-century German philosophy, and liberal [[political theory]].  During his research, teaching, and consulting in cultural [[risk assessment]], research [[ethics]], clinical ethics, and public-health ethics, Dr. Sass developed cross-cultural perspectives in the major fields of bioethics (based on concepts of personal and professional responsibility), regulated markets, mutual trust, and partnership ethics.

Dr. Sass is a ''Rechtsritter'' ("Knight of Justice") of the ''Johanniterorden'', the [[Order of Saint John (Bailiwick of Brandenburg)]].

==Focus and interest==
His main focus in bioethics is on the transition from paternalistic models of patient care towards partnership models between providers and customers of health care.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eubios.info/EJ115/EJ115B.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  He has developed a widely used and translated ‘[[Interactive Post-Hippocratic Action Guide]]’ and other models for communication-in-trust and cooperation-in-trust interactions of individual, institutional and corporate persons in risk assessment, research and business ethics. His proposed virtues and principles for cross-cultural health care ethics include for the patient the balance between quality of life and length of life, individual self-determination and compliance with expert advice, for the expert the balance between professional responsibility and respect for clients’/patients’ autonomy, do-no-harm and do-good; trust, truthfulness and a prudent mix of solidarity and subsidiarity are important for all parties involved in the care for health, quality and happiness of life. He proposes that most ethical issues should be decided by risk-competent and health-literate citizens rather than bureaucracies and legislation, but that governments and institutions have the responsibility to introduce and to support health information and health competence as an essential part of educating risk-competent citizens for the 21st century. 
 
&lt;blockquote&gt;As to health care reform and health education he defines in criticizing the [[WHO]] approach: Health is not just a status; rather the balanced result of health-literate and risk-competent care of one's own physical, emotional, and social well-being and well-feeling, achieved in competent understanding, modification and enhancement of individual genetic, social and environmental properties, with the support of health care professionals and through equal access health care services, including information, predictive and preventive medicine. He also is concerned that modern principles of bioethics do not put enough emphasis on professionalism and compassion in expert services and on developing and supporting better communication-in-trust and cooperation-in-trust models of provider-customer interactions. His most recent work include studies in cross-cultural bioethics and fundamentally common issues in different cultures of bioethics. &lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Education==

His philosophical and medical training was extensive and he studied under [[Abu al-Hassan al-Amiri]],&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Hindū Abū l-Faraj (s. n.) (1971) In: Lewis B, Menage VL, Pellat Ch, Schacht J (eds) Encyclopaedia of Islam, new edition, vol III.

Aida Tibi (Reading: Garnet Publishing Limited, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt; He traveled to [[Arraiján]] in 965, where he continued his services for the [[Buwayhids]].&lt;ref&gt;Ed... "Ibn Hindū."

He wrote in Arabic. He was most famous for his works of poetry than as a physician. He was also held in high esteem by his students who would travel to study with him.&lt;ref&gt;M. Nasser and A. Tibi, “Ibn Hindu and the Science of Medicine,” ''Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine'' 100 (January 2007), 55–56.&lt;/ref&gt; He was employed at [['Adud al-Dawla]]'s ''dīwān.''&lt;ref&gt;M. Nasser and A. Tibi, “Ibn Hindu and the Science of Medicine,” ''Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine'' 100 (January 2007), 55–56.&lt;/ref&gt; His approach to religion has been described as open-minded.&lt;ref&gt;Aida Tibi, “Translator’s Introduction,” in [https://books.google.com/books?id=7LqkpC5oI9sC&amp;pg=PR15&amp;dq=the+key+to+medicine+a+guide+for+students&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=x-CDUYXLKKXC0gG9nIDAAw&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA ''The Key to Medicine and a Guide for Students''], trans.

==Publications==
Ibn Hindū. Miftah al-tibb wa-minhaj al-tullab. [The key to the science of medicine and the students' guide]. Mohaghegh M, Daneshpajuh MT, eds. Tehran: Institute of Islamic Studies, McGill University Tehran Branch, in collaboration with Tehran University, 1989.

Later translated by Aidi Tibi as ''The Key to Medicine and a Guide for Students.'' The book, espousing the virtues of medicine, has three primary arguments. The first is to demonstrate the noble qualities of being a physician, and to locate the role of physicians within a hierarchy of prestigious professions. The second is to reinforce a hierarchy between those who see reason and accept medicine and the erroneous logic of disbeliever. And finally, ibn Hindū seeks to show the superiority of Dogmatists over Methodists and Empiricists.

The above work makes mention to the existence of ''A Treatise Encouraging the Study of Philosophy'', but only a few excerpts of it survive today.&lt;ref&gt;Aida Tibi, “Translator’s Introduction,” in [https://books.google.com/books?id=7LqkpC5oI9sC&amp;pg=PR15&amp;dq=the+key+to+medicine+a+guide+for+students&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=x-CDUYXLKKXC0gG9nIDAAw&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA ''The Key to Medicine and a Guide for Students''], trans. Aida Tibi (Reading: Garnet Publishing Limited, 2010), xiii-xix.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Society for Stem Cell Research''' (ISSCR) is an independent [[501(c)(3)]] [[nonprofit organization]] based in [[Skokie, Illinois]], [[United States of America|United States]].&lt;ref name=990-2014/&gt; The organization's mission is to promote and foster the exchange and dissemination of information and ideas relating to [[stem cell]]s, to encourage the general field of research involving stem cells, and to promote professional and public education in all areas of stem cell research and [[Stem-cell therapy|application]].&lt;ref name=990-2014/&gt;

==History==
The International Society for Stem Cell Research was officially incorporated on March 30, 2001,&lt;ref name= corp/&gt; to foster the exchange of information on [[stem cell]] research.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.isscr.org/home/about-us About Us]". ''International Society for Stem Cell Research''.&lt;/ref&gt; Leonard Zon, professor of [[pediatrics]] at [[Harvard Medical School]], served as the organization's first [[president (corporation)|president]].&lt;ref&gt;Parello, Nancy. "[http://infoweb.newsbank.com/iw-search/we/InfoWeb?p_product=AWNB&amp;p_theme=aggregated5&amp;p_action=doc&amp;p_docid=0EE08C1315FFCF0F&amp;p_docnum=1&amp;p_queryname=2 Frozen Embryos' Heated Debate: Couples, Doctors Face Ethical Issues]". ''The Record'' (New Jersey). August 20, 2001. p. A1.&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2003, the International Society for Stem Cell Research held its first convention.&lt;ref name= slow&gt;"[http://infoweb.newsbank.com/iw-search/we/InfoWeb?p_product=AWNB&amp;p_theme=aggregated5&amp;p_action=doc&amp;p_docid=1577CFD1A18EAAF0&amp;p_docnum=5&amp;p_queryname=2 Analysis: Slow Progress Of Stem Cell Research]". ''[[Morning Edition]]''. [[National Public Radio]]. June 12, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; More than 600 scientists attended, many of whom expressed frustration over [[George W.

''Chicago Tribune'' via The Houston Chronicle. February 12, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the Society's official journal, ''[[Stem Cell Reports]]'', was established; it is published monthly by [[Cell Press]] on the Society's behalf.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mummery|first=Christine|last2=Fischer|first2=Yvonne|last3=Gathier|first3=Atie|date=2013-06-04|title=Welcome to Stem Cell Reports|journal=Stem Cell Reports|volume=1|issue=1|pages=1–2|doi=10.1016/j.stemcr.2013.05.003|issn=2213-6711|pmc=3757740|pmid=24052935}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Bergson-Nobel-photo.jpg|thumbnail|right|150px|Henri Bergson in 1927.]]

'''Intuition''' is the philosophical method of [[France|French]] [[Philosophy|philosopher]] [[Henri Bergson]].

In ''An Introduction to Metaphysics'', Bergson introduces two ways in which an object can be known: absolutely and relatively. Pertaining to each mode of knowledge is a method through which it can be gained. The latter’s method is what Bergson calls analysis, while the method of intuition belongs to the former.&lt;ref name="The_Creative_Mind"&gt;Henri Bergson, ''The Creative Mind: An Introduction to Metaphysics'', pages 159 to 162.&lt;/ref&gt;

Intuition is an experience of sorts, which allows us to in a sense enter into the things in themselves. Thus he calls his philosophy the true [[empiricism]].&lt;ref name="Creative_Mind"&gt;Henri Bergson, ''The Creative Mind: An Introduction to Metaphysics'', page 175 to 176.&lt;/ref&gt; In the following article, analysis and the relative will be explained as a preliminary to understanding intuition, and then intuition and the absolute will be expounded upon.

== Analysis and the Relative ==

Analysis is always an analysis ad infinitum and one can never reach the absolute. It consists in dividing the object based on the chosen viewpoint and translating the divided fragments into symbols, wherein a spectre of the original can be reconstructed. These symbols always distort the part of the object they represent, as they’re generalized to include it and every other part they represent. Thus they ignore the object’s uniqueness.&lt;ref&gt;Henri Bergson, ''The Creative Mind: An Introduction to Metaphysics'', pages 165 to 168.&lt;/ref&gt;

This is natural, however, as language is the product of commonsense, which is never disinterested. Thus, for example, mobility is translated into a trajectory line and treated as a row of divisible, immobile points. Symbols are generally always spatial and immobile. This allows science to be predictive and our actions to assert themselves on fixed points.&lt;ref name="multiplicity"&gt;Henri Bergson, ''The Creative Mind: An Introduction to Metaphysics'', pages 12 to 17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Within philosophy, however, problems arise when the symbols are treated as the objects they represent and when, through composition, the original is expected to be found within the [[simulacrum]]. An example of this is the [[substance theory]] of [[Rationalism|rationalists]] and the [[bundle theory]] of [[Empiricism|empiricists]]. Empiricists, searching for the substance within the gaps of the composition, fill them in within even more symbols. Unwilling to continue filling in the gaps ad infinitum, they renounce that there is a substance and maintain the properties, or symbols, which are not to be confused with parts, are all that there are. The rationalists, on the other hand, are unwilling to relinquish substance. Thus they transform it into an unknowable container in which properties reside. Trying to obtain the unity of the object, they allow their substance to contain more and more properties, until eventually it can contain everything, including God and nature. Bergson likened this to a piece of gold for which one can never make up the change.&lt;ref name="The_Creative_Mind"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Henri Bergson, ''The Creative Mind: An Introduction to Metaphysics'', pages 169 to 176.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Intuition and the Absolute ==

Henri Bergson defined [[metaphysics]] as the science that dispenses with symbols to grasp the absolute.&lt;ref name="The_Creative_Mind"/&gt; Hence metaphysics involves an inversion of the habitual modes of thought and is in need of its own method, which he identified as intuition.

Henri Bergson defined intuition as a simple, indivisible experience of sympathy through which one is moved into the inner being of an object to grasp what is [[Uniqueness|unique]] and [[ineffability|ineffable]] within it. The absolute that is grasped is always perfect in the sense that it is perfectly what it is, and infinite in the sense that it can be grasped as a whole through a simple, indivisible act of intuition, yet lends itself to boundless enumeration when analysed.&lt;ref name="The_Creative_Mind"/&gt;&lt;ref group="notes" name="intuition"&gt;For a Whiteheadian use of Bergsonian intuition, see [[Michel Weber]]'s ''[https://www.academia.edu/279953/Whiteheads_Pancreativism._The_Basics Whitehead’s Pancreativism. The Basics]''. Foreword by [[Nicholas Rescher]], Frankfurt / Paris, Ontos Verlag, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two images Henri Bergson gave in his essay ''An Introduction to Metaphysics'' may aid us in comprehending the ideas of intuition, analyses, the absolute and the relative. The first image is a city reconstructed with juxtaposed photographs taken from every viewpoint and angle. The reconstruction can never give us the dimensional value of walking through the actual city. This can only ever be grasped through a simple intuition. The same goes for the experience of reading a single line of [[Homer]]. If you wish to explain this experience to someone who cannot speak ancient Greek, you may translate the line and lay commentary upon commentary, but this commentary shall never grasp the dimensional value of experiencing the poem in its original language.&lt;ref name="The_Creative_Mind"/&gt;

It can be seen then that intuition is a method that aims at getting back to and knowing the things themselves, in all their uniqueness and ineffable originality.  The one thing it is certain one can grasp from within through sympathy is the self. Intuition therefore begins with placing oneself within the [[Duration (Bergson)|Duration]].&lt;ref&gt;Henri Bergson, ''The Creative Mind: An Introduction to Metaphysics'', pages 162 to 163.&lt;/ref&gt;

From within the Duration, one may augment it to contain other Durations one can enter into. Like an infinite spectrum of shades gradually running into one another, one finds themselves within orange, stuck between its darkest and lightest shades. One may move up to yellow or down to red, just as one may move up to spirit or down to matter.&lt;ref&gt;Henri Bergson, ''The Creative Mind: An Introduction to Metaphysics'', pages 187 to 188.&lt;/ref&gt;

The method then consists in placing oneself within the Duration, which always contains a sense of all the other Durations within the absolute Duration. From here, one should expand their Duration into a continuous heterogeneity. Once this is done, one differentiates two extremities within the Duration to create a dualism, just as one differentiates between red and yellow within the colour spectrum, before showing they are in fact one.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/bergson/ The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy] ''This series of acts is why Bergson calls intuition a method. The first act is a kind of leap, and the idea of a leap is opposed to the idea of a re-constitution after analysis. One should make the effort to reverse the habitual mode of intelligence and set oneself up immediately in the duration. But then, second, one should make the effort to dilate one's duration into a continuous heterogeneity. Third, one should make the effort to differentiate (as with the color orange) the extremes of this heterogeneity. [...] Then one shows how the duality is actually a monism, how the two extremes are “sewn” together, through memory, in the continuous heterogeneity of duration.''&lt;/ref&gt;

It may now be understood that Henri Bergson was dissatisfied with [[Kantianism]], which limited the bounds of reason to such an extent that it deemed knowledge of the absolute an impossibility. His method of intuition can in fact be seen as a response to [[Immanuel Kant]], who believed that we can only know the world as it appears to us, not as it is in itself. He maintained that the attempt to know the absolute always resulted in [[antinomies]], a kind of philosophical paradox caused by the limits of reason.&lt;ref&gt; Immanuel Kant, ''Critique of Pure Reason'' and ''Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/bergson/ The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy] ''As we already noted, Bergson's thought must be seen as an attempt to overcome Kant. In Bergson's eyes, Kant's philosophy is scandalous, since it eliminates the possibility of absolute knowledge and mires metaphysics in antinomies. Bergson's own method of intuition is supposed to restore the possibility of absolute knowledge – here one should see a kinship between Bergsonian intuition and what Kant calls intellectual intuition – and metaphysics.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Bergson responds by saying that the antinomies are the result of analysis, not intuition.&lt;ref&gt;Henri Bergson, ''Matter and Memory'', pages 183 to 185.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="notes" name="intuition"/&gt; An example of this is Duration itself, which Bergson maintains isn’t a multiplicity or a unity.&lt;ref name="multiplicity"&gt;Henri Bergson, ''The Creative Mind: An Introduction to Metaphysics'', pages 12 to 17.&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the viewpoint from which one begins, he will either reconstruct the absolute Duration as a unity or a multiplicity. Hence the [[antinomy]] of [[Pluralism (philosophy)|substance pluralism]] and [[Monism|substance monism]], which can only be resolved through showing they are two representations of the same thing via a simple act of intuition. Thus real philosophy consists in placing oneself above the fray of oppositional schools of thought.&lt;ref name="Creative_Mind"/&gt;&lt;ref group="notes" name="intuition"/&gt;

'''J. Peter Burgess''' (born 1 June 1961 in [[Munich]], Germany) is a philosopher and political scientist. He is Professor and Chair of Geopolitics of Risk at the [http://www.ens.fr/?lang=en Ecole Normale Supérieure, Paris], Adjunct Professor at the [http://cast.ku.dk Center for Advanced Security Theory (CAST), University of Copenhagen] and Associate Researcher at the [http://www.vub.ac.be/LSTS/index.shtml Centre for Law, Science, Technology and Society Studies (LSTS)] at the Vrije Universiteit Brussel. He is Series Editor of the Routledge [https://www.routledge.com/PRIO-New-Security-Studies/book-series/PRIONEWSEC New Security Studies] collection. His research and writing concern the meeting place between science, culture and politics in particular in Europe, focusing most recently on the theory and ethics of security and insecurity. He has published 11 books and over 75 articles in the fields of [[philosophy]], [[political science]], [[gender studies]], [[cultural history]], [[security studies]] and [[cultural theory]]. He has contributed to research and educational policy in Norway, France, Poland and the European Commission. In addition, he has developed and directed a number of comprehensive collaborative research projects with Norwegian and European partners.

==Early life and studies==
Burgess grew up in the U.S. Midwest and studied Mechanical Engineering and Applied Physics at the [[University of Colorado]], Boulder, graduating with a B.S. in 1983. He then turned his attention to European literature and literary theory, completing a B.A. in English Literature at the [[University of Iowa]] in 1984, an A.M. at the [[University of Chicago]] in Comparative Literature in 1986 and an M.Phil. at [[Columbia University]] in French and Comparative Literature in 1989. In 1985 he began a series of intermittent studies in semiotics at the [[University of Paris VI]] (1988–1989) and philosophy at the [[Free University of Berlin|Free University]] of Berlin (1989–1990). He completed a D.E.A. in philosophy at the [[École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales]], Paris and a Doctorate in philosophy from [http://www.univ-tours.fr/ Université François Rabelais de Tours] in 2010 with a thesis on the politics of [[Hegel]]’s dialectic.

==Career and research==
Burgess worked as teacher of philosophy at the [[Lycée Français]] d’Oslo and Adjunct Lecturer in Philosophy at the [[University of Oslo]] in 1992-1994 before becoming a Lecturer and Researcher at [[Volda University College]] where he remained in several capacities until 1998. His research in this period focused on theories of cultural and national identity and led to a variety of publications on Norwegian nation-building, culture and language politics. 
In 1998-2000 he was Jean Monnet Fellow at the [[European University Institute]], Florence. Here research expanded to questions of the European identity and the language politics of Vico. During this period he also began a collaborative project on security identity at the [[Peace Research Institute Oslo]] (PRIO). In 2001, Burgess was named Editor of ''[[Security Dialogue]]'' at PRIO and undertook a long-term reform of the journal, lifting it to its current status as among the most prominent journals in [[security studies]] in the world. In 2004, Burgess was named Leader of PRIO’s Security Programme, which he led until 2011. His research in this period focused on theoretical and ethical issues connected to risk, uncertainty, security and insecurity, with a particular attention to European politics. He has argued in a number of works for the cultural, societal and philosophical foundations of security. During this period Burgess rose to spearhead PRIO’s European research portfolio. He has been actively involved in funding and execution of over 35 Norwegian and European research projects.

Burgess has held adjunct positions at the [[Centre for Development and the Environment]] at the [[University of Oslo]] (2003–2004), as Visiting Professor at the Fondation national de sciences politiques ([[Sciences Po]]) (2004–2005), Adjunct Professor at [[Collegium Civitas]], Warsaw (2007–2010), Adjunct Professor at Norwegian University of Science and Technology ([[Norwegian University of Science and Technology|NTNU]]) (2008–2010), and Senior Researcher at the [http://www.ies.be/ Institute for European Studies], [[Vrije Universiteit Brussel]] (2009–2011).

==Contributions to Research, Educational and Social Policy==
Since 2007, Burgess has actively participated in the formation of the European security research policy and the shaping of European research programmes, participating in policy formation working groups and projects in and around the European institutions. He was an active participant in ESRIF, the [http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=MEMO/07/346 European Security Research and Innovation Forum], contributing directly to the main elements of its final report, published in 2009. He has been a central member of the [[European Commission]]’s Working Group on the Societal Impact of Security Research and authored a number of contributions to security research policy in the [[Seventh Framework Programme]] and [[Horizon 2020]]. He is currently Chairman of the [https://secure.edps.europa.eu/EDPSWEB/edps/EDPS/Ethics Ethics Advisory Group] of the European Data Protection Supervisor.

==Personal life==
J. Peter Burgess is married to Karen Lieve Ria Hostens, Cooperation Delegate for the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]], and father to three children. He lives in [[Paris]].

Kepler is a key figure in the 17th-century [[scientific revolution]]. He is best known for his [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion|laws of planetary motion]], based on his works ''[[Astronomia nova]]'', ''[[Harmonices Mundi]]'', and ''[[Epitome of Copernican Astronomy]]''. These works also provided one of the foundations for [[Isaac Newton]]'s theory of [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|universal gravitation]].

Kepler was a mathematics teacher at a [[seminary]] school in [[Graz]], where he became an associate of [[Hans Ulrich von Eggenberg|Prince Hans Ulrich von Eggenberg]]. Later he became an assistant to the astronomer [[Tycho Brahe]] in [[Prague]], and eventually the imperial mathematician to [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor Rudolf II]] and his two successors [[Matthias, Holy Roman Emperor|Matthias]] and [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand II]]. He also taught mathematics in [[Linz]], and was an adviser to [[Albrecht von Wallenstein|General Wallenstein]]. Additionally, he did fundamental work in the field of [[optics]], invented an improved version of the [[refracting telescope]] (the [[Keplerian telescope]]), and was mentioned in the [[Telescope|telescopic]] discoveries of his contemporary [[Galileo Galilei]]. He was a corresponding member of the [[Accademia dei Lincei]] in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/ItalianAcademies/PersonFullDisplay.aspx?RecordId=022-000006427&amp;searchAssoc=Assoc{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} accessed 9/7/2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Kepler lived in an era when there was no clear distinction between [[astronomy]] and [[astrology]], but there was a strong division between astronomy (a branch of [[quadrivium|mathematics]] within the [[liberal arts]]) and [[physics]] (a branch of [[natural philosophy]]). Kepler also incorporated religious arguments and reasoning into his work, motivated by the religious conviction and belief that God had created the world according to an intelligible plan that is accessible through the natural light of [[reason]].&lt;ref&gt;Barker and Goldstein. "Theological Foundations of Kepler's Astronomy", pp.&amp;nbsp; 112–13.&lt;/ref&gt; Kepler described his new astronomy as "celestial physics",&lt;ref&gt;Kepler. ''New Astronomy'', title page, tr. Donohue, pp.&amp;nbsp; 26–7&lt;/ref&gt; as "an excursion into [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]''",&lt;ref&gt;Kepler. ''New Astronomy'', p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; and as "a supplement to Aristotle's ''[[On the Heavens]]''",&lt;ref&gt;''Epitome of Copernican Astronomy'' in ''Great Books of the Western World'', Vol 15, p. 845&lt;/ref&gt; transforming the ancient tradition of physical cosmology by treating astronomy as part of a universal mathematical physics.&lt;ref&gt;Stephenson. ''Kepler's Physical Astronomy,'' pp.&amp;nbsp; 1–2; Dear, ''Revolutionizing the Sciences'', pp.&amp;nbsp; 74–78&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kepler-Geburtshaus.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Kepler's birthplace, in Weil der Stadt]]
[[File:Von einem Schrecklichen vnd Wunderbarlichen Cometen so sich den Dienstag nach Martini dieses lauffenden M. D. Lxxvij. Jahrs am Himmel erzeiget hat (grayscale).png|thumb|left|250px|The [[Great Comet of 1577]], which Kepler witnessed as a child, attracted the attention of astronomers across Europe]]

Kepler was born on December 27, the feast day of St [[John the Evangelist]], 1571, in the [[Free Imperial City]] of [[Weil der Stadt]] (now part of the [[Stuttgart Region]] in the German state of [[Baden-Württemberg]], 30&amp;nbsp;km west of Stuttgart's center). His grandfather, Sebald Kepler, had been Lord Mayor of the city. By the time Johannes was born, he had two brothers and one sister and the Kepler family fortune was in decline. His father, Heinrich Kepler, earned a precarious living as a [[mercenary]], and he left the family when Johannes was five years old. He was believed to have died in the [[Eighty Years' War]] in the Netherlands. His mother, [[Katharina Kepler|Katharina Guldenmann]], an innkeeper's daughter, was a [[healer (alternative medicine)|healer]] and [[herbalist]]. Born prematurely, Johannes claimed to have been weak and sickly as a child. Nevertheless, he often impressed travelers at his grandfather's inn with his phenomenal mathematical faculty.&lt;ref&gt;Caspar. ''Kepler'', pp.&amp;nbsp; 29–36; Connor. ''Kepler's Witch'', pp.&amp;nbsp; 23–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was introduced to astronomy at an early age, and developed a love for it that would span his entire life. At age six, he observed the [[Great Comet of 1577]], writing that he "was taken by [his] mother to a high place to look at it."&lt;ref name = Koestler234/&gt; In 1580, at age nine, he observed another astronomical event, a [[lunar eclipse]], recording that he remembered being "called outdoors" to see it and that the [[moon]] "appeared quite red".&lt;ref name=Koestler234&gt;Koestler. ''The Sleepwalkers'', p. 234 (translated from Kepler's family horoscope).&lt;/ref&gt; However, childhood [[smallpox]] left him with weak vision and crippled hands, limiting his ability in the observational aspects of astronomy.&lt;ref&gt;Caspar. ''Kepler'', pp.&amp;nbsp; 36–38; Connor. ''Kepler's Witch'', pp.&amp;nbsp; 25–27.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1589, after moving through grammar school, [[Latin school]], and [[Evangelical Seminaries of Maulbronn and Blaubeuren|seminary at Maulbronn]], Kepler attended [[Tübinger Stift]] at the [[University of Tübingen]]. There, he studied philosophy under Vitus Müller&lt;ref&gt;Connor, James A. ''Kepler's Witch'' (2004), p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[theology]] under [[Jacob Heerbrand]] (a student of [[Philipp Melanchthon]] at Wittenberg), who also taught [[Michael Maestlin]] while he was a student, until he became Chancellor at Tübingen in 1590.&lt;ref name="Kepler's Astronomy Author 2001 p. 96"&gt;Barker, Peter; Goldstein, Bernard R. "Theological Foundations of Kepler's Astronomy",  Osiris, 2nd Series, Vol. 16, Science'' in Theistic Contexts: Cognitive Dimensions'' (2001), p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; He proved himself to be a superb mathematician and earned a reputation as a skilful astrologer, casting [[horoscope]]s for fellow students.

=== ''Mysterium Cosmographicum'' ===
[[Image:Kepler-solar-system-1.png|thumb|right|Kepler's [[Platonic solid]] model of the [[solar system]], from ''Mysterium Cosmographicum'' (1596)]]

Kepler's first major astronomical work, ''[[Mysterium Cosmographicum]]'' (''The Cosmographic Mystery'') [1596], was the first published defense of the Copernican system. Kepler claimed to have had an [[epiphany (feeling)|epiphany]] on July 19, 1595, while teaching in [[Graz]], demonstrating the periodic [[Conjunction (astronomy and astrology)|conjunction]] of [[Saturn]] and [[Jupiter]] in the [[zodiac]]: he realized that [[regular polygon]]s bound one inscribed and one circumscribed circle at definite ratios, which, he reasoned, might be the geometrical basis of the universe. After failing to find a unique arrangement of polygons that fit known astronomical observations (even with extra planets added to the system), Kepler began experimenting with 3-dimensional [[polyhedron|polyhedra]]. He found that each of the five [[Platonic solid]]s could be inscribed and circumscribed by spherical [[orb (astronomy)|orbs]]; nesting these solids, each encased in a sphere, within one another would produce six layers, corresponding to the six known planets—[[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]], [[Venus]], [[Earth]], [[Mars]], Jupiter, and Saturn. By ordering the solids selectively—[[octahedron]], [[icosahedron]], [[dodecahedron]], [[tetrahedron]], [[cube]]—Kepler found that the spheres could be placed at intervals corresponding to the relative sizes of each planet's path, assuming the planets circle the Sun. Kepler also found a formula relating the size of each planet's orb to the length of its [[orbital period]]: from inner to outer planets, the ratio of increase in orbital period is twice the difference in orb radius. However, Kepler later rejected this formula, because it was not precise enough.&lt;ref&gt;Caspar. ''Kepler'', pp.&amp;nbsp;60–65; see also: Barker and Goldstein, "Theological Foundations of Kepler's Astronomy."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Kepler-solar-system-2.png|thumb|left|Close-up of an inner section of Kepler's model]]

As he indicated in the title, Kepler thought he had revealed God's geometrical plan for the universe. Much of Kepler's enthusiasm for the Copernican system stemmed from his [[theological]] convictions about the connection between the physical and the [[Spirituality|spiritual]]; the universe itself was an image of God, with the Sun corresponding to the Father, the stellar sphere to the [[Jesus|Son]], and the intervening space between to the [[Holy Spirit]]. His first manuscript of ''Mysterium'' contained an extensive chapter reconciling heliocentrism with biblical passages that seemed to support geocentrism.&lt;ref&gt;Barker and Goldstein. "Theological Foundations of Kepler's Astronomy," pp.&amp;nbsp;99–103, 112–113.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the support of his mentor Michael Maestlin, Kepler received permission from the Tübingen university senate to publish his manuscript, pending removal of the Bible [[exegesis]] and the addition of a simpler, more understandable description of the Copernican system as well as Kepler's new ideas.  ''Mysterium'' was published late in 1596, and Kepler received his copies and began sending them to prominent astronomers and patrons early in 1597; it was not widely read, but it established Kepler's reputation as a highly skilled astronomer. The effusive dedication, to powerful patrons as well as to the men who controlled his position in Graz, also provided a crucial doorway into the [[Patronage|patronage system]].&lt;ref&gt;Caspar. ''Kepler'', pp.&amp;nbsp;65–71.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the details would be modified in light of his later work, Kepler never relinquished the Platonist polyhedral-spherist cosmology of ''[[Mysterium Cosmographicum]]''. His subsequent main astronomical works were in some sense only further developments of it, concerned with finding more precise inner and outer dimensions for the spheres by calculating the eccentricities of the planetary orbits within it. In 1621, Kepler published an expanded second edition of ''Mysterium'', half as long again as the first, detailing in footnotes the corrections and improvements he had achieved in the 25 years since its first publication.&lt;ref&gt;Field. ''Kepler's Geometrical Cosmology'', Chapter IV, p 73ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of the impact of ''Mysterium'', it can be seen as an important first step in modernizing the theory proposed by [[Nicolaus Copernicus]] in his "[[De revolutionibus orbium coelestium|De Revolutionibus orbium coelestium]]". Whilst Copernicus sought to advance a heliocentric system in this book, he resorted to Ptolemaic devices (viz., epicycles and eccentric circles) in order to explain the change in planets' orbital speed, and also continued to use as a point of reference the center of the earth's orbit rather than that of the sun "as an aid to calculation and in order not to confuse the reader by diverging too much from Ptolemy." Modern astronomy owes much to "Mysterium Cosmographicum", despite flaws in its main thesis,  "since it represents the first step in cleansing the Copernican system of the remnants of the Ptolemaic theory still clinging to it." &lt;ref&gt;Dreyer, J.L.E. ''A History of Astronomy from [[Thales]] to Kepler'', Dover Publications, 1953, pp.&amp;nbsp;331, 377–379.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Marriage to Barbara Müller ===
[[Image:Barbara Müller and Johannes Kepler.jpg|thumb|Portraits of Kepler and his wife in oval medallions]]

In December 1595, Kepler was introduced to Barbara Müller, a 23-year-old widow (twice over) with a young daughter, Regina Lorenz, and he began courting her. Müller, an heiress to the estates of her late husbands, was also the daughter of a successful mill owner. Her father Jobst initially opposed a marriage. Even though Kepler had inherited his grandfather's nobility, Kepler's poverty made him an unacceptable match. Jobst relented after Kepler completed work on ''Mysterium'', but the engagement nearly fell apart while Kepler was away tending to the details of publication. However, Protestant officials—who had helped set up the match—pressured the Müllers to honor their agreement. Barbara and Johannes were married on April 27, 1597.&lt;ref&gt;Caspar, ''Kepler''. pp.&amp;nbsp;71–75.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first years of their marriage, the Keplers had two children (Heinrich and Susanna), both of whom died in infancy. In 1602, they had a daughter (Susanna); in 1604, a son (Friedrich); and in 1607, another son (Ludwig).&lt;ref&gt;Connor. ''Kepler's Witch'', pp.&amp;nbsp;89–100, 114–116; Caspar.

=== Other research ===
Following the publication of ''Mysterium'' and with the blessing of the Graz school inspectors, Kepler began an ambitious program to extend and elaborate his work. He planned four additional books: one on the stationary aspects of the universe (the Sun and the fixed stars); one on the planets and their motions; one on the physical nature of planets and the formation of geographical features (focused especially on Earth); and one on the effects of the heavens on the Earth, to include atmospheric optics, meteorology, and astrology.&lt;ref&gt;Caspar. ''Kepler'', pp.&amp;nbsp;85–86.&lt;/ref&gt;

He also sought the opinions of many of the astronomers to whom he had sent ''Mysterium'', among them [[Reimarus Ursus]] (Nicolaus Reimers Bär)—the imperial mathematician to [[Rudolf II, Holy Roman Emperor|Rudolph II]] and a bitter rival of [[Tycho Brahe]]. Ursus did not reply directly, but republished Kepler's flattering letter to pursue his priority dispute over (what is now called) the [[Tychonic system]] with Tycho. Despite this black mark, Tycho also began corresponding with Kepler, starting with a harsh but legitimate critique of Kepler's system; among a host of objections, Tycho took issue with the use of inaccurate numerical data taken from Copernicus. Through their letters, Tycho and Kepler discussed a broad range of astronomical problems, dwelling on lunar phenomena and Copernican theory (particularly its theological viability). But without the significantly more accurate data of Tycho's observatory, Kepler had no way to address many of these issues.&lt;ref&gt;Caspar, ''Kepler'', pp.&amp;nbsp;86–89&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead, he turned his attention to [[chronology]] and "harmony," the [[numerology|numerological]] relationships among music, [[mathematics]] and the physical world, and their [[astrology|astrological]] consequences. By assuming the Earth to possess a soul (a property he would later invoke to explain how the sun causes the motion of planets), he established a speculative system connecting [[astrological aspects]] and astronomical distances to [[meteorology|weather]] and other earthly phenomena. By 1599, however, he again felt his work limited by the inaccuracy of available data—just as growing religious tension was also threatening his continued employment in Graz. In December of that year, Tycho invited Kepler to visit him in [[Prague]]; on January 1, 1600 (before he even received the invitation), Kepler set off in the hopes that Tycho's patronage could solve his philosophical problems as well as his social and financial ones.&lt;ref&gt;Caspar, ''Kepler'', pp.&amp;nbsp;89–100&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prague (1600–1612) ==

=== Work for Tycho Brahe ===
[[Image:Tycho Brahe.JPG|thumb|[[Tycho Brahe]]]]

On February 4, 1600, Kepler met [[Tycho Brahe]] and his assistants [[Franz Tengnagel]] and [[Longomontanus]] at [[Benátky nad Jizerou]] (35&amp;nbsp;km from Prague), the site where Tycho's new observatory was being constructed. Over the next two months, he stayed as a guest, analyzing some of Tycho's observations of Mars; Tycho guarded his data closely, but was impressed by Kepler's theoretical ideas and soon allowed him more access. Kepler planned to test his theory&lt;ref&gt;[http://knol.google.com/k/the-sky-before-the-telescope# Using Tycho's data, see 'Two views of a system' ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721014442/http://knol.google.com/k/the-sky-before-the-telescope |date=July 21, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; from ''Mysterium Cosmographicum'' based on the Mars data, but he estimated that the work would take up to two years (since he was not allowed to simply copy the data for his own use). With the help of [[Johannes Jessenius]], Kepler attempted to negotiate a more formal employment arrangement with Tycho, but negotiations broke down in an angry argument and Kepler left for Prague on April 6. Kepler and Tycho soon reconciled and eventually reached an agreement on salary and living arrangements, and in June, Kepler returned home to Graz to collect his family.&lt;ref&gt;Caspar, ''Kepler'', pp.&amp;nbsp;100–08.&lt;/ref&gt;

Political and religious difficulties in Graz dashed his hopes of returning immediately to Brahe; in hopes of continuing his astronomical studies, Kepler sought an appointment as a mathematician to [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|Archduke Ferdinand]]. To that end, Kepler composed an essay—dedicated to Ferdinand—in which he proposed a force-based theory of lunar motion: "In Terra inest virtus, quae Lunam ciet" ("There is a force in the earth which causes the moon to move").&lt;ref&gt;Caspar, ''Kepler'', p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;  Though the essay did not earn him a place in Ferdinand's court, it did detail a new method for measuring lunar eclipses, which he applied during the July 10 eclipse in Graz. These observations formed the basis of his explorations of the laws of optics that would culminate in ''Astronomiae Pars Optica''.&lt;ref&gt;Caspar, ''Kepler'', pp.&amp;nbsp;108–11.&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 2, 1600, after refusing to convert to Catholicism, Kepler and his family were banished from Graz. Several months later, Kepler returned, now with the rest of his household, to Prague. Through most of 1601, he was supported directly by Tycho, who assigned him to analyzing planetary observations and writing a tract against Tycho's (by then deceased) rival, Ursus. In September, Tycho secured him a commission as a collaborator on the new project he had proposed to the emperor: the ''[[Rudolphine Tables]]'' that should replace the ''[[Prutenic Tables]]'' of [[Erasmus Reinhold]]. Two days after Tycho's unexpected death on October 24, 1601, Kepler was appointed his successor as the imperial mathematician with the responsibility to complete his unfinished work. The next 11 years as imperial mathematician would be the most productive of his life.&lt;ref&gt;Caspar, ''Kepler'', pp.&amp;nbsp;111–22.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Advisor to Emperor Rudolph II ===
Kepler's primary obligation as imperial mathematician was to provide astrological advice to the emperor. Though Kepler took a dim view of the attempts of contemporary astrologers to precisely predict the future or divine specific events, he had been casting well-received detailed horoscopes for friends, family, and patrons since his time as a student in Tübingen. In addition to horoscopes for allies and foreign leaders, the emperor sought Kepler's advice in times of political trouble. Rudolph was actively interested in the work of many of his court scholars (including numerous [[Alchemy|alchemists]]) and kept up with Kepler's work in physical astronomy as well.&lt;ref&gt;Caspar, ''Kepler'', pp.&amp;nbsp;149–53&lt;/ref&gt;

Officially, the only acceptable religious doctrines in Prague were Catholic and [[Utraquist]], but Kepler's position in the imperial court allowed him to practice his Lutheran faith unhindered. The emperor nominally provided an ample income for his family, but the difficulties of the over-extended imperial treasury meant that actually getting hold of enough money to meet financial obligations was a continual struggle. Partly because of financial troubles, his life at home with Barbara was unpleasant, marred with bickering and bouts of sickness. Court life, however, brought Kepler into contact with other prominent scholars ([[Johannes Matthäus Wackher von Wackhenfels]], [[Jost Bürgi]], [[David Fabricius]], Martin Bachazek, and Johannes Brengger, among others) and astronomical work proceeded rapidly.&lt;ref&gt;Caspar, ''Kepler'', pp.&amp;nbsp;146–148, 159–177&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Astronomiae Pars Optica'' ===
[[Image:Kepler Optica.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A plate from ''[[Astronomiae Pars Optica]]'', illustrating the structure of eyes of various species.]]
[[File:Kepler - Ad Vitellionem paralipomena quibus astronomiae pars optica traditur, 1604 - 158093 F.jpg|thumb|''Astronomiae pars optica'']]

As Kepler slowly continued analyzing Tycho's Mars observations—now available to him in their entirety—and began the slow process of tabulating the ''[[Rudolphine Tables]]'', Kepler also picked up the investigation of the laws of optics from his lunar essay of 1600. Both lunar and [[solar eclipse]]s presented unexplained phenomena, such as unexpected shadow sizes, the red color of a total lunar eclipse, and the reportedly unusual light surrounding a total solar eclipse. Related issues of [[atmospheric refraction]] applied to ''all'' astronomical observations. Through most of 1603, Kepler paused his other work to focus on optical theory; the resulting manuscript, presented to the emperor on January 1, 1604, was published as ''Astronomiae Pars Optica'' (The Optical Part of Astronomy). In it, Kepler described the [[inverse-square law]] governing the intensity of light, reflection by flat and curved mirrors, and principles of [[pinhole camera]]s, as well as the astronomical implications of optics such as [[parallax]] and the apparent sizes of heavenly bodies. He also extended his study of optics to the human eye, and is generally considered by neuroscientists to be the first to recognize that images are projected inverted and reversed by the [[Lens (anatomy)|eye's lens]] onto the [[retina]]. The solution to this dilemma was not of particular importance to Kepler as he did not see it as pertaining to optics, although he did suggest that the image was later corrected "in the hollows of the brain" due to the "activity of the Soul."&lt;ref&gt;Finger, "Origins of Neuroscience," p. 74. [[Oxford University Press]], 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, ''Astronomiae Pars Optica'' is generally recognized as the foundation of modern optics (though the [[law of refraction]] is conspicuously absent).&lt;ref&gt;Caspar, ''Kepler'', pp. 142–146&lt;/ref&gt; With respect to the beginnings of [[projective geometry]], Kepler introduced the idea of continuous change of a mathematical entity in this work. He argued that if a [[Focus (geometry)|focus]] of a [[conic section]] were allowed to move along the line joining the foci, the geometric form would morph or degenerate, one into another. In this way, an [[ellipse]] becomes a [[parabola]] when a focus moves toward infinity, and when two foci of an ellipse merge into one another, a circle is formed. As the foci of a hyperbola merge into one another, the hyperbola becomes a pair of straight lines. He also assumed that if a straight line is extended to infinity it will meet itself at a single [[point at infinity]], thus having the properties of a large circle.&lt;ref&gt;[[Morris Kline]], [[Mathematical Thought from Ancient to Modern Times]], p. 299. [[Oxford University Press]], 1972.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Supernova of 1604 ===
{{see also|Kepler's Supernova}} [[Image:Keplers supernova.jpg|thumb|Remnant of Kepler's Supernova [[SN 1604]]]]

In October 1604, a bright new evening star ([[SN 1604]]) appeared, but Kepler did not believe the rumors until he saw it himself. Kepler began systematically observing the nova. Astrologically, the end of 1603 marked the beginning of a [[fiery trigon]], the start of the about 800-year cycle of [[great conjunction]]s; astrologers associated the two previous such periods with the rise of [[Charlemagne]] (c. 800 years earlier) and the birth of Christ (c. 1600 years earlier), and thus expected events of great portent, especially regarding the emperor. It was in this context, as the imperial mathematician and astrologer to the emperor, that Kepler described the new star two years later in his ''[[De Stella Nova]]''. In it, Kepler addressed the star's astronomical properties while taking a skeptical approach to the many astrological interpretations then circulating. He noted its fading luminosity, speculated about its origin, and used the lack of observed parallax to argue that it was in the sphere of fixed stars, further undermining the doctrine of the immutability of the heavens (the idea accepted since Aristotle that the [[celestial spheres]] were perfect and unchanging). The birth of a new star implied the variability of the heavens. In an appendix, Kepler also discussed the recent chronology work of the Polish historian [[Laurentius Suslyga]]; he calculated that, if Suslyga was correct that accepted timelines were four years behind, then the [[Star of Bethlehem]]—analogous to the present new star—would have coincided with the first great conjunction of the earlier 800-year cycle.&lt;ref&gt;Caspar, ''Kepler'', pp.&amp;nbsp;153–157&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:Kepler Drawing of SN 1604.png|thumb|upright|left|The location of the ''stella nova'', in the foot of [[Ophiuchus]], is marked with an ''N'' (8 grid squares down, 4 over from the left).]]

=== ''Astronomia nova'' ===
The extended line of research that culminated in ''[[Astronomia nova]]'' (''A New Astronomy'')—including the first two [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion|laws of planetary motion]]—began with the analysis, under Tycho's direction, of Mars' orbit. Kepler calculated and recalculated various approximations of Mars' orbit using an [[equant]] (the mathematical tool that Copernicus had eliminated with his system), eventually creating a model that generally agreed with Tycho's observations to within two [[arcminute]]s (the average measurement error). But he was not satisfied with the complex and still slightly inaccurate result; at certain points the model differed from the data by up to eight arcminutes. The wide array of traditional mathematical astronomy methods having failed him, Kepler set about trying to fit an [[ovoid]] orbit to the data.&lt;ref&gt;Caspar, ''Kepler'', pp.&amp;nbsp;123–128&lt;/ref&gt;

In Kepler's religious view of the cosmos, the Sun (a symbol of [[God the Father]]) was the source of motive force in the solar system. As a physical basis, Kepler drew by analogy on [[William Gilbert (astronomer)|William Gilbert's]] theory of the magnetic soul of the Earth from ''[[De Magnete]]'' (1600) and on his own work on optics. Kepler supposed that the motive power (or motive ''species'')&lt;ref&gt;On motive species, see Lindberg, "The Genesis of Kepler's Theory of Light," pp.&amp;nbsp;38–40.&lt;/ref&gt; radiated by the Sun weakens with distance, causing faster or slower motion as planets move closer or farther from it.&lt;ref&gt;"Kepler's decision to base his causal explanation of planetary motion on a distance-velocity law, rather than on uniform circular motions of compounded spheres, marks a major shift from ancient to modern conceptions of science&amp;nbsp;... [Kepler] had begun with physical principles and had then derived a trajectory from it, rather than simply constructing new models.  In other words, even before discovering the area law, Kepler had abandoned uniform circular motion as a physical principle."  Peter Barker and Bernard R. Goldstein, "Distance and Velocity in Kepler's Astronomy", ''Annals of Science,'' 51 (1994): 59–73, at p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Koyré, ''The Astronomical Revolution'', pp.&amp;nbsp;199–202.&lt;/ref&gt;  Perhaps this assumption entailed a mathematical relationship that would restore astronomical order. Based on measurements of the [[aphelion]] and [[perihelion]] of the Earth and Mars, he created a formula in which a planet's rate of motion is inversely proportional to its distance from the Sun. Verifying this relationship throughout the orbital cycle, however, required very extensive calculation; to simplify this task, by late 1602 Kepler reformulated the proportion in terms of geometry: ''planets sweep out equal areas in equal times''—Kepler's second law of planetary motion.&lt;ref&gt;Caspar, ''Kepler'', pp.&amp;nbsp;129–132&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Kepler Mars retrograde.jpg|thumb|Diagram of the [[geocentric]] trajectory of Mars through several periods of [[apparent retrograde motion]] (''Astronomia nova,'' Chapter 1, 1609)]]

He then set about calculating the entire orbit of Mars, using the geometrical rate law and assuming an egg-shaped [[ovoid]] orbit. After approximately 40 failed attempts, in early 1605 he at last hit upon the idea of an ellipse, which he had previously assumed to be too simple a solution for earlier astronomers to have overlooked.&lt;ref&gt;Caspar, ''Kepler'', p.&amp;nbsp;133&lt;/ref&gt; Finding that an elliptical orbit fit the Mars data, he immediately concluded that ''all planets move in ellipses, with the sun at one focus''—Kepler's first law of planetary motion. Because he employed no calculating assistants, however, he did not extend the mathematical analysis beyond Mars. By the end of the year, he completed the manuscript for ''Astronomia nova'', though it would not be published until 1609 due to legal disputes over the use of Tycho's observations, the property of his heirs.&lt;ref&gt;Caspar, ''Kepler'', pp.&amp;nbsp;131–140; Koyré, ''The Astronomical Revolution'', pp.&amp;nbsp;277–279&lt;/ref&gt;

=== {{anchor|Dioptrice}}''Dioptrice'', ''Somnium'' manuscript, and other work ===
In the years following the completion of ''Astronomia Nova'', most of Kepler's research was focused on preparations for the ''Rudolphine Tables'' and a comprehensive set of [[ephemerides]] (specific predictions of planet and star positions) based on the table (though neither would be completed for many years). He also attempted (unsuccessfully) to begin a collaboration with Italian astronomer [[Giovanni Antonio Magini]]. Some of his other work dealt with chronology, especially the [[Chronology of Jesus|dating of events in the life of Jesus]], and with astrology, especially criticism of dramatic predictions of catastrophe such as those of [[Helisaeus Roeslin]].&lt;ref&gt;Caspar, ''Kepler'', pp.&amp;nbsp;178–81&lt;/ref&gt;

Kepler and Roeslin engaged in a series of published attacks and counter-attacks, while physician Philip Feselius published a work dismissing astrology altogether (and Roeslin's work in particular). In response to what Kepler saw as the excesses of astrology on the one hand and overzealous rejection of it on the other, Kepler prepared ''Tertius Interveniens'' [Third-party Interventions]. Nominally this work—presented to the common patron of Roeslin and Feselius—was a neutral mediation between the feuding scholars, but it also set out Kepler's general views on the value of astrology, including some hypothesized mechanisms of interaction between planets and individual souls. While Kepler considered most traditional rules and methods of astrology to be the "evil-smelling dung" in which "an industrious hen" scrapes, there was an "occasional grain-seed, indeed, even a pearl or a gold nugget" to be found by the conscientious scientific astrologer.&lt;ref&gt;Caspar, ''Kepler'', pp.&amp;nbsp;181–85. The full title is ''Tertius Interveniens, das ist Warnung an etliche Theologos, Medicos vnd Philosophos, sonderlich D. Philippum Feselium, dass sie bey billicher Verwerffung der Sternguckerischen Aberglauben nict das Kindt mit dem Badt aussschütten vnd hiermit jhrer Profession vnwissendt zuwider handlen'', translated by C. Doris Hellman as "''Tertius Interveniens'', that is warning to some theologians, medics and philosophers, especially D. Philip Feselius, that they in cheap condemnation of the star-gazer's superstition do not throw out the child with the bath and hereby unknowingly act contrary to their profession."&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, [[Oliver Joseph Lodge|Sir Oliver Lodge]] observed that Kepler was somewhat disdainful of astrology, as Kepler was "continually attacking and throwing sarcasm at astrology, but it was the only thing for which people would pay him, and on it after a fashion he lived."&lt;ref&gt;[[Oliver Joseph Lodge|Lodge, O.J.]], ''Johann Kepler'' in "The World of Mathematics", Vol. 1 (1956) Ed. [[James R. Newman|Newman, J.R.]], [[Simon &amp; Schuster|Simon and Schuster]], pp. 231.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first months of 1610, [[Galileo Galilei]]—using his powerful new [[telescope]]—discovered four satellites orbiting Jupiter. Upon publishing his account as ''[[Sidereus Nuncius]]'' [Starry Messenger], Galileo sought the opinion of Kepler, in part to bolster the credibility of his observations. Kepler responded enthusiastically with a short published reply, ''Dissertatio cum Nuncio Sidereo'' [Conversation with the Starry Messenger]. He endorsed Galileo's observations and offered a range of speculations about the meaning and implications of Galileo's discoveries and telescopic methods, for astronomy and optics as well as cosmology and astrology. Later that year, Kepler published his own telescopic observations of the moons in ''Narratio de Jovis Satellitibus'', providing further support of Galileo. To Kepler's disappointment, however, Galileo never published his reactions (if any) to ''Astronomia Nova''.&lt;ref&gt;Caspar, ''Kepler'', pp.&amp;nbsp;192–197&lt;/ref&gt;

After hearing of Galileo's telescopic discoveries, Kepler also started a theoretical and experimental investigation of telescopic optics using a telescope borrowed from Duke Ernest of Cologne.&lt;ref&gt;Koestler, ''The Sleepwalkers'' p. 384&lt;/ref&gt;  The resulting manuscript was completed in September 1610 and published as ''Dioptrice'' in 1611. In it, Kepler set out the theoretical basis of [[double-convex converging lens]]es and [[double-concave diverging lens]]es—and how they are combined to produce a [[Galilean telescope]]—as well as the concepts of [[real image|real]] vs. [[virtual image|virtual]] images, upright vs. inverted images, and the effects of focal length on magnification and reduction. He also described an improved telescope—now known as the ''astronomical'' or ''[[Keplerian telescope]]''—in which two convex lenses can produce higher magnification than Galileo's combination of convex and concave lenses.&lt;ref&gt;Caspar, ''Kepler'', pp.&amp;nbsp;198–202&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Kepler conjecture 2.jpg|thumb|One of the diagrams from ''Strena Seu de Nive Sexangula'', illustrating the [[Kepler conjecture]]]]

Around 1611, Kepler circulated a manuscript of what would eventually be published (posthumously) as ''[[Somnium (novel)|Somnium]]'' [The Dream]. Part of the purpose of ''Somnium'' was to describe what practicing astronomy would be like from the perspective of another planet, to show the feasibility of a non-geocentric system. The manuscript, which disappeared after changing hands several times, described a fantastic trip to the moon; it was part allegory, part autobiography, and part treatise on interplanetary travel (and is sometimes described as the first work of science fiction). Years later, a distorted version of the story may have instigated the witchcraft trial against his mother, as the mother of the narrator consults a demon to learn the means of space travel. Following her eventual acquittal, Kepler composed 223 footnotes to the story—several times longer than the actual text—which explained the allegorical aspects as well as the considerable scientific content (particularly regarding lunar geography) hidden within the text.&lt;ref&gt;Lear, ''Kepler's Dream'', pp.&amp;nbsp;1–78&lt;/ref&gt;

===Work in mathematics and physics===
As a New Year's gift that year (1611), he also composed for his friend and some-time patron, Baron Wackher von Wackhenfels, a short pamphlet entitled ''Strena Seu de Nive Sexangula'' (''A New Year's Gift of Hexagonal Snow''). In this treatise, he published the first description of the hexagonal symmetry of snowflakes and, extending the discussion into a hypothetical [[atomism|atomistic]] physical basis for the symmetry, posed what later became known as the [[Kepler conjecture]], a statement about the most efficient arrangement for packing spheres.&lt;ref&gt;Schneer, "Kepler's New Year's Gift of a Snowflake," pp.&amp;nbsp;531–45&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Kepler |first1=Johannes |editor1-last=Hardie |editor1-first=Colin |title=De nive sexangula |trans-title=The Six-sided Snowflake |url= |date=1966 |origyear=1611 |publisher=Clarendon Press |location=Oxford |isbn= |oclc=974730 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Personal and political troubles ===
In 1611, the growing political-religious tension in Prague came to a head. Emperor Rudolph—whose health was failing—was forced to abdicate as [[List of rulers of Bohemia|King of Bohemia]]  by his brother [[Matthias, Holy Roman Emperor|Matthias]]. Both sides sought Kepler's astrological advice, an opportunity he used to deliver conciliatory political advice (with little reference to the stars, except in general statements to discourage drastic action). However, it was clear that Kepler's future prospects in the court of Matthias were dim.&lt;ref&gt;Caspar, ''Kepler'', pp.&amp;nbsp;202–204&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in that year, Barbara Kepler contracted [[Hungarian spotted fever]], then began having [[seizure]]s. As Barbara was recovering, Kepler's three children all fell sick with smallpox; Friedrich, 6, died. Following his son's death, Kepler sent letters to potential patrons in Württemberg and [[Padua]]. At the [[Eberhard Karls University of Tübingen|University of Tübingen]] in Württemberg, concerns over Kepler's perceived [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] heresies in violation of the [[Augsburg Confession]] and the [[Formula of Concord]] prevented his return. The [[University of Padua]]—on the recommendation of the departing Galileo—sought Kepler to fill the mathematics professorship, but Kepler, preferring to keep his family in German territory, instead travelled to Austria to arrange a position as teacher and district mathematician in [[Linz]]. However, Barbara relapsed into illness and died shortly after Kepler's return.&lt;ref&gt;Connor, ''Kepler's Witch'', pp.&amp;nbsp;222–226; Caspar, ''Kepler'', pp.&amp;nbsp;204–07&lt;/ref&gt;

Kepler postponed the move to Linz and remained in Prague until Rudolph's death in early 1612, though between political upheaval, religious tension, and family tragedy (along with the legal dispute over his wife's estate), Kepler could do no research. Instead, he pieced together a chronology manuscript, ''Eclogae Chronicae'', from correspondence and earlier work. Upon succession as Holy Roman Emperor, Matthias re-affirmed Kepler's position (and salary) as imperial mathematician but allowed him to move to Linz.&lt;ref&gt;Caspar, ''Kepler'', pp.&amp;nbsp;208–11&lt;/ref&gt;

== Linz and elsewhere (1612–1630) ==
[[Image:Kepler Statue Linz.jpg|thumb|A statue of Kepler in [[Linz]]]]

In Linz, Kepler's primary responsibilities (beyond completing the ''Rudolphine Tables'') were teaching at the district school and providing astrological and astronomical services. In his first years there, he enjoyed financial security and religious freedom relative to his life in Prague—though he was excluded from [[Eucharist]] by his Lutheran church over his theological scruples. It was also during his time in Linz that Kepler had to deal with the accusation and ultimate verdict of witchcraft against his mother [[Katharina Kepler|Katharina]] in the Protestant town of [[Leonberg]]. That blow, happening only a few years after Kepler’s [[excommunication]], is not seen as a coincidence but as a symptom of the full-fledged assault waged by the Lutherans against Kepler.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GhamrvcsVyIC&amp;pg=PT125&amp;lpg=PT125&amp;dq=mazer+waged+an+assault+against+kepler&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=rRbOXeTHUA&amp;sig=9IUhfpehovxpXf0nJlFf15Z2TxU&amp;hl=de&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi6r8ftoLPTAhULKlAKHbmPCPIQ6AEIIjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=mazer%20waged%20an%20assault%20against%20kepler&amp;f=false|title=Shifting the Earth: The Mathematica Quest to Understand the Motion of the Universe|last=Mazer|first=Arthur|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|year=2010|isbn=978-1-118-02427--0|location=Hoboken, NJ|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His first publication in Linz was ''De vero Anno'' (1613), an expanded treatise on the year of Christ's birth; he also participated in deliberations on whether to introduce [[Pope Gregory XIII|Pope Gregory]]'s [[Gregorian calendar|reformed calendar]] to Protestant German lands; that year he also wrote the influential mathematical treatise ''Nova stereometria doliorum vinariorum'', on measuring the volume of containers such as wine barrels, published in 1615.&lt;ref&gt;Caspar, ''Kepler'', pp.&amp;nbsp;209–20, 227–240&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Second marriage ===
On October 30, 1613, Kepler married the 24-year-old Susanna Reuttinger. Following the death of his first wife Barbara, Kepler had considered 11 different matches over two years (a decision process formalized later as the [[Secretary problem|marriage problem]]).&lt;ref name="ferguson"&gt;{{Citation |last=Ferguson |first=Thomas S. |title=Who solved the secretary problem ? |journal=Statistical Science |volume=4 |issue=3 |date=1989 |pages=282–289 |quote=When the celebrated German astronomer, Johannes Kepler (1571–1630), lost his first wife to cholera in 1611, he set about finding a new wife using the same methodical thoroughness and careful consideration of the data that he used in finding the orbit of Mars to be an ellipse&amp;nbsp;... The process consumed much of his attention and energy for nearly 2 years&amp;nbsp;... |jstor=2245639 |doi=10.1214/ss/1177012493 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; He eventually returned to Reuttinger (the fifth match) who, he wrote, "won me over with love, humble loyalty, economy of household, diligence, and the love she gave the stepchildren."&lt;ref&gt;Quotation from Connor, ''Kepler's Witch'', p 252, translated from an October 23, 1613 letter from Kepler to an anonymous nobleman&lt;/ref&gt;  The first three children of this marriage (Margareta Regina, Katharina, and Sebald) died in childhood. Three more survived into adulthood: Cordula (born 1621); Fridmar (born 1623); and Hildebert (born 1625). According to Kepler's biographers, this was a much happier marriage than his first.&lt;ref&gt;Caspar, ''Kepler'', pp.&amp;nbsp;220–223; Connor, ''Kepler's Witch'', pp.&amp;nbsp;251–54.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Epitome of Copernican Astronomy'', calendars, and the witch trial of his mother ===
{{details|Epitome astronomiae Copernicanae}}
[[File:Kepler-Bruno.jpg|thumb|left|Kepler's Figure 'M' from the ''Epitome'', showing the world as belonging to just one of any number of similar stars.]]

Since completing the ''Astronomia nova'', Kepler had intended to compose an astronomy textbook.&lt;ref&gt;Caspar, ''Kepler'', pp.&amp;nbsp;239–240, 293–300&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1615, he completed the first of three volumes of ''Epitome astronomiae Copernicanae'' (''Epitome of Copernican Astronomy''); the first volume (books I–III) was printed in 1617, the second (book IV) in 1620, and the third (books V–VII) in 1621. Despite the title, which referred simply to heliocentrism, Kepler's textbook culminated in his own ellipse-based system. The ''Epitome'' became Kepler's most influential work. It contained all three laws of planetary motion and attempted to explain heavenly motions through physical causes.&lt;ref name="Gingerich pp 302"&gt;Gingerich, "Kepler, Johannes" from ''Dictionary of Scientific Biography'', pp.&amp;nbsp;302–04&lt;/ref&gt;  Though it explicitly extended the first two laws of planetary motion (applied to Mars in ''Astronomia nova'') to all the planets as well as the Moon and the [[Galilean moons|Medicean satellites of Jupiter]],&lt;ref&gt;By 1621 or earlier, Kepler recognized that Jupiter's moons obey his third law.

Kepler contended that rotating massive bodies communicate their rotation to their satellites, so that the satellites are swept around the central body; thus the rotation of the Sun drives the revolutions of the planets and the rotation of the Earth drives the revolution of the Moon.  In Kepler's era, no one had any evidence of Jupiter's rotation.  However, Kepler argued that the force by which a central body causes its satellites to revolve around it, weakens with distance; consequently, satellites that are farther from the central body revolve slower.  Kepler noted that Jupiter's moons obeyed this pattern and he inferred that a similar force was responsible.  He also noted that the orbital periods and semi-major axes of Jupiter's satellites were roughly related by a 3/2 power law, as are the orbits of the six (then known) planets.  However, this relation was approximate:  the periods of Jupiter's moons were known within a few percent of their modern values, but the moons' semi-major axes were determined less accurately.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Kepler discussed Jupiter's moons in his ''Epitome Astronomiae Copernicanae'' [Summary of Copernican Astronomy] (Linz ("Lentiis ad Danubium"), (Austria):  Johann Planck, 1622), book 4, part 2, [https://books.google.com/books?id=wa2SE_6ZL7YC&amp;pg=PA554#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false page 554].  (For a more modern and legible edition, see:   Christian Frisch, ed., ''Joannis Kepleri Astronomi Opera Omnia'', vol. 6 (Frankfurt-am-Main, (Germany):  Heyder &amp; Zimmer, 1866), [https://books.google.com/books?id=xjMAAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA361#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false page 361].)

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Original :  ''4)  Confirmatur vero fides hujus rei comparatione quatuor Jovialium et Jovis cum sex planetis et Sole.  Etsi enim de corpore Jovis, an et ipsum circa suum axem convertatur, non ea documenta habemus, quae nobis suppetunt in corporibus Terrae et praecipue Solis, quippe a sensu ipso: at illud sensus testatur, plane ut est cum sex planetis circa Solem, sic etiam se rem habere cum quatuor Jovialibus, ut circa corpus Jovis quilibet, quo longius ab illo potest excurrere, hoc tardius redeat, et id quidem proportione non eadem, sed majore, hoc est sescupla proportionis intervallorum cujusque a Jove:  quae plane ipsissima est, qua utebantur supra sex planetae.  Intervalla enim quatuor Jovialium a Jove prodit Marius in suo Mundo Joviali ista:  3, 5, 8, 13 (vel 14 Galilaeo)&amp;nbsp;... Periodica vero tempora prodit idem Marius ista:  dies 1. h. 18 1/2, dies 3 h. 13 1/3, dies 7 h. 3, dies 16 h. 18:  ubique proportio est major quam dupla, major igitur quam intervallorum 3, 5, 8, 13 vel 14, minor tamen quam quadratorum, qui duplicant proportiones intervallorum, sc. 9, 25, 64, 169 vel 196, sicut etiam sescupla sunt majora simplis, minora vero duplis.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;''Translation'' :  (4) However, the credibility of this [argument] is proved by the comparison of the four [moons] of Jupiter and Jupiter with the six planets and the Sun.  Because, regarding the body of Jupiter, whether it turns around its axis, we don't have proofs for what suffices for us [regarding the rotation of ] the body of the Earth and especially of the Sun, certainly [as reason proves to us]:  but reason attests that, just as it is clearly [true] among the six planets around the Sun, so also it is among the four [moons] of Jupiter, because around the body of Jupiter any [satellite] that can go farther from it orbits slower, and even that [orbit's period] is not in the same proportion, but greater [than the distance from Jupiter]; that is, 3/2 (''sescupla'' ) of the proportion of each of the distances from Jupiter, which is clearly the very [proportion] as [is used for] the six planets above.  In his [book] ''The World of Jupiter'' [''Mundus Jovialis'', 1614], [[Simon Marius|[Simon] Mayr]] [1573–1624] presents these distances, from Jupiter, of the four [moons] of Jupiter:  3, 5, 8, 13 (or 14 [according to] Galileo)&amp;nbsp;... Mayr presents their time periods:  1 day 18 1/2 hours, 3 days 13 1/3 hours, 7 days 3 hours, 16 days 18 hours:  for all [of these data] the proportion is greater than double, thus greater than [the proportion] of the distances 3, 5, 8, 13 or 14, although less than [the proportion] of the squares, which double the proportions of the distances, namely 9, 25, 64, 169 or 196, just as [a power of] 3/2 is also greater than 1 but less than 2.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; it did not explain how elliptical orbits could be derived from observational data.&lt;ref&gt;Wolf, ''A History of Science, Technology and Philosophy'', pp.&amp;nbsp;140–41; Pannekoek, ''A History of Astronomy'', p 252&lt;/ref&gt;

As a spin-off from the ''Rudolphine Tables'' and the related ''Ephemerides'', Kepler published astrological calendars, which were very popular and helped offset the costs of producing his other work—especially when support from the Imperial treasury was withheld. In his calendars—six between 1617 and 1624—Kepler forecast planetary positions and weather as well as political events; the latter were often cannily accurate, thanks to his keen grasp of contemporary political and theological tensions. By 1624, however, the escalation of those tensions and the ambiguity of the prophecies meant political trouble for Kepler himself; his final calendar was publicly burned in Graz.&lt;ref&gt;Caspar, ''Kepler'', pp.&amp;nbsp;239, 300–01, 307–08&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Kepler-1619-pl-3.jpg|thumb|Geometrical harmonies in the perfect solids from ''[[Harmonices Mundi]]'' (1619)]]

In 1615, Ursula Reingold, a woman in a financial dispute with Kepler's brother Christoph, claimed Kepler's mother Katharina had made her sick with an evil brew. The dispute escalated, and in 1617 Katharina was accused of [[European witchcraft|witchcraft]]; witchcraft trials were relatively common in central Europe at this time. Beginning in August 1620, she was imprisoned for fourteen months. She was released in October 1621, thanks in part to the extensive legal defense drawn up by Kepler. The accusers had no stronger evidence than rumors. Katharina was subjected to ''territio verbalis'', a graphic description of the torture awaiting her as a witch, in a final attempt to make her confess. Throughout the trial, Kepler postponed his other work to focus on his "harmonic theory". The result, published in 1619, was ''[[Harmonices Mundi]]'' ("Harmony of the World").&lt;ref&gt;Caspar, ''Kepler'', pp.&amp;nbsp;240–264; Connor, ''Kepler's Witch'', chapters I, XI-XIII; Lear, ''Kepler's Dream'', pp.&amp;nbsp;21–39&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Harmonices Mundi'' ===
{{main|Harmonices Mundi}}

Kepler was convinced "that the geometrical things have provided the Creator with the model for decorating the whole world".&lt;ref&gt;Quotation from Caspar, ''Kepler'', pp.&amp;nbsp;265–266, translated from ''Harmonices Mundi''&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''Harmony'', he attempted to explain the proportions of the natural world—particularly the astronomical and astrological aspects—in terms of music.&lt;ref&gt;The opening of the movie ''[[Mars et Avril]]'' by [[Martin Villeneuve]] is based on German astronomer Johannes Kepler's cosmological model from the 17th century, ''[[Harmonices Mundi]]'', in which the harmony of the universe is determined by the motion of celestial bodies. [[Benoît Charest]] also composed the score according to this theory.&lt;/ref&gt; The central set of "harmonies" was the ''[[musica universalis]]'' or "music of the spheres", which had been studied by [[Pythagoras]], [[Ptolemy]] and many others before Kepler; in fact, soon after publishing ''Harmonices Mundi'', Kepler was embroiled in a priority dispute with [[Robert Fludd]], who had recently published his own harmonic theory.&lt;ref&gt;Caspar, ''Kepler'', pp.&amp;nbsp;264–66, 290–93&lt;/ref&gt;

Kepler began by exploring regular polygons and [[regular solid]]s, including the figures that would come to be known as [[Kepler-Poinsot polyhedra|Kepler's solids]]. From there, he extended his harmonic analysis to music, meteorology, and astrology; harmony resulted from the tones made by the souls of heavenly bodies—and in the case of astrology, the interaction between those tones and human souls. In the final portion of the work (Book V), Kepler dealt with planetary motions, especially relationships between [[orbital speed|orbital velocity]] and orbital distance from the Sun. Similar relationships had been used by other astronomers, but Kepler—with Tycho's data and his own astronomical theories—treated them much more precisely and attached new physical significance to them.&lt;ref&gt;Caspar, ''Kepler'', pp.&amp;nbsp;266–90&lt;/ref&gt;

Among many other harmonies, Kepler articulated what came to be known as the third law of planetary motion. He then tried many combinations until he discovered that (approximately) "''The square of the periodic times are to each other as the cubes of the mean distances''." Although he gives the date of this epiphany (March 8, 1618), he does not give any details about how he arrived at this conclusion.&lt;ref name="Miller2009"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Miller |first=Arthur I. |authorlink=Arthur I. Miller |title=Deciphering the cosmic number: the strange friendship of Wolfgang Pauli and Carl Jung |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KR2EtBnmcRYC&amp;pg=PA80 |accessdate=March 7, 2011 |date=March 24, 2009 |publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company |isbn=978-0-393-06532-9 |page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the wider significance for planetary dynamics of this purely kinematical law was not realized until the 1660s. When conjoined with [[Christiaan Huygens]]' newly discovered law of centrifugal force, it enabled [[Isaac Newton]], [[Edmund Halley]], and perhaps [[Christopher Wren]] and [[Robert Hooke]] to demonstrate independently that the presumed gravitational attraction between the Sun and its planets decreased with the square of the distance between them.&lt;ref&gt;Westfall, ''Never at Rest'', pp.&amp;nbsp;143, 152, 402–03; Toulmin and Goodfield, ''The Fabric of the Heavens'', p 248; De Gandt, 'Force and Geometry in Newton's Principia', chapter 2; Wolf, ''History of Science, Technology and Philosophy'', p. 150; Westfall, ''The Construction of Modern Science'', chapters 7 and 8&lt;/ref&gt;  This refuted the traditional assumption of scholastic physics that the power of gravitational attraction remained constant with distance whenever it applied between two bodies, such as was assumed by Kepler and also by Galileo in his mistaken universal law that gravitational fall is uniformly accelerated, and also by Galileo's student Borrelli in his 1666 celestial mechanics.&lt;ref&gt;Koyré, ''The Astronomical Revolution'', p. 502&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Rudolphine Tables'' and his last years ===
[[Image:Kepler Autograph 1 (cropped) - name Copernicus in Kepler's handwriting.jpg|thumb|Name "Copernicus" in a manuscript report by Kepler concerning the Rudolphine Tables (1616).]]
[[File:8107-2Keplertp.png|thumb|Title page of the ''Tabulae Rudolphinae'', Ulm, 1627]]
[[Image:Kepler-Wallenstein-Horoskop.jpg|right|thumb|Kepler's horoscope for [[Albrecht von Wallenstein|General Wallenstein]]]]

In 1623, Kepler at last completed the ''[[Rudolphine Tables]]'', which at the time was considered his major work. However, due to the publishing requirements of the emperor and negotiations with Tycho Brahe's heir, it would not be printed until 1627. In the meantime, religious tension — the root of the ongoing [[Thirty Years' War]] — once again put Kepler and his family in jeopardy. In 1625, agents of the [[Counter-Reformation|Catholic Counter-Reformation]] placed most of Kepler's library under seal, and in 1626 the city of Linz was besieged. Kepler moved to [[Ulm]], where he arranged for the printing of the ''Tables'' at his own expense.&lt;ref&gt;Caspar, ''Kepler'', pp.&amp;nbsp;308–328&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1628, following the military successes of the Emperor Ferdinand's armies under [[Albrecht von Wallenstein|General Wallenstein]], Kepler became an official advisor to Wallenstein. Though not the general's court astrologer per se, Kepler provided astronomical calculations for Wallenstein's astrologers and occasionally wrote horoscopes himself. In his final years, Kepler spent much of his time traveling, from the imperial court in Prague to Linz and [[Ulm]] to a temporary home in [[Żagań|Sagan]], and finally to [[Regensburg]]. Soon after arriving in Regensburg, Kepler fell ill. He died on November 15, 1630, and was buried there; his burial site was lost after the Swedish army destroyed the churchyard.&lt;ref&gt;Caspar, ''Kepler'', pp.&amp;nbsp;332–351, 355–61&lt;/ref&gt; Only Kepler's self-authored poetic epitaph survived the times:

:''Mensus eram coelos, nunc terrae metior umbras''
:''Mens coelestis erat, corporis umbra iacet.''

:I measured the skies, now the shadows I measure
:Skybound was the mind, earthbound the body rests.&lt;ref&gt;Koestler, ''The Sleepwalkers, p. 427.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Christianity ==

Kepler's belief that God created the cosmos in an orderly fashion caused him to attempt to determine and comprehend the laws that govern the natural world, most profoundly in astronomy.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.britannica.com/biography/Johannes-Kepler&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.britannica.com/science/astronomy/The-techniques-of-astronomy#ref1211452&lt;/ref&gt; The phrase "I am merely thinking God's thoughts after Him" has been attributed to him, although this is probably a capsulized version of a writing from his hand:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Those laws [of nature] are within the grasp of the human mind; God wanted us to recognize them by creating us after his own image so that we could share in his own thoughts.&lt;ref&gt;Letter (9/10 Apr 1599) to the Bavarian chancellor Herwart von Hohenburg. Collected in Carola Baumgardt and Jamie Callan, Johannes Kepler Life and Letters (1953), 50&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Reception of his astronomy ==
[[Kepler's laws of planetary motion]] were not immediately accepted. Several major figures such as [[Galileo]] and [[René Descartes]] completely ignored Kepler's ''Astronomia nova.''  Many astronomers, including Kepler's teacher, Michael Maestlin, objected to Kepler's introduction of physics into his astronomy. Some adopted compromise positions. [[Ismaël Bullialdus]] accepted elliptical orbits but replaced Kepler's area law with uniform motion in respect to the empty focus of the ellipse, while [[Seth Ward (bishop)|Seth Ward]] used an elliptical orbit with motions defined by an equant.&lt;ref&gt;For a detailed study of the reception of Kepler's astronomy see Wilbur Applebaum, [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1996HisSc..34..451A "Keplerian Astronomy after Kepler: Researches and Problems,"] ''History of Science'', 34(1996): 451–504.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Koyré, ''The Astronomical Revolution'', pp.&amp;nbsp;362–364&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;North, ''History of Astronomy and Cosmology'', pp.&amp;nbsp; 355–60&lt;/ref&gt;

Several astronomers tested Kepler's theory, and its various modifications, against astronomical observations. Two transits of Venus and Mercury across the face of the sun provided sensitive tests of the theory, under circumstances when these planets could not normally be observed. In the case of the transit of Mercury in 1631, Kepler had been extremely uncertain of the parameters for Mercury, and advised observers to look for the transit the day before and after the predicted date.  [[Pierre Gassendi]] observed the transit on the date predicted, a confirmation of Kepler's prediction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Albert van |last=Helden |title=The Importance of the Transit of Mercury of 1631 |journal=Journal for the History of Astronomy |volume=7 |year=1976 |pages=1–10|bibcode = 1976JHA.....7....1V |doi=10.1177/002182867600700101 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first observation of a transit of Mercury. However, his attempt to observe the [[transit of Venus]] just one month later was unsuccessful due to inaccuracies in the Rudolphine Tables. Gassendi did not realize that it was not visible from most of Europe, including Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=HM Nautical Almanac Office |url=http://www.nao.rl.ac.uk/nao/transit/V_1631/ |title=1631 Transit of Venus |date=June 10, 2004 |accessdate=August 28, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061001062918/http://www.nao.rl.ac.uk/nao/transit/V_1631/ |archivedate=October 1, 2006 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Jeremiah Horrocks]], who observed the [[Transit of Venus, 1639|1639 Venus transit]], had used his own observations to adjust the parameters of the Keplerian model, predicted the transit, and then built apparatus to observe the transit. He remained a firm advocate of the Keplerian model.&lt;ref&gt;Allan Chapman, [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1990QJRAS..31..333C "Jeremiah Horrocks, the transit of Venus, and the 'New Astronomy' in early 17th-century England,"] ''Quarterly Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society,'' 31 (1990): 333–357.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;North, ''History of Astronomy and Cosmology'', pp.&amp;nbsp; 348–349&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilbur Applebaum and Robert Hatch, [http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1983JHA....14..166A "Boulliau, Mercator, and Horrock's ''Venus in sole visa'': Three Unpublished Letters,"] ''[[Journal for the History of Astronomy]]'', 14(1983): 166–179&lt;/ref&gt;

''Epitome of Copernican Astronomy'' was read by astronomers throughout Europe, and following Kepler's death, it was the main vehicle for spreading Kepler's ideas. In the period 1630 - 1650, this book was the most widely used astronomy textbook, winning many converts to ellipse-based astronomy.&lt;ref name="Gingerich pp 302"/&gt;  However, few adopted his ideas on the physical basis for celestial motions. In the late 17th century, a number of physical astronomy theories drawing from Kepler's work—notably those of [[Giovanni Alfonso Borelli]] and Robert Hooke—began to incorporate attractive forces (though not the quasi-spiritual motive species postulated by Kepler) and the Cartesian concept of [[Principle of inertia (physics)|inertia]].&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Nolan (ed.), ''The Cambridge Descartes Lexicon'', Cambridge University Press, 2016, "Inertia."&lt;/ref&gt; This culminated in Isaac Newton's ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia Mathematica]]'' (1687), in which Newton derived Kepler's laws of planetary motion from a force-based theory of [[Newton's law of universal gravitation|universal gravitation]].&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, ''The Copernican Revolution'', pp.&amp;nbsp;238, 246–252&lt;/ref&gt;

===History of science===
Beyond his role in the historical development of astronomy and natural philosophy, Kepler has loomed large in the [[philosophy of science|philosophy]] and [[historiography of science]]. Kepler and his laws of motion were central to early histories of astronomy such as [[Jean-Étienne Montucla]]'s 1758 ''Histoire des mathématiques'' and [[Jean-Baptiste Delambre]]'s 1821 ''Histoire de l'astronomie moderne''. These and other histories written from an [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] perspective treated Kepler's metaphysical and religious arguments with skepticism and disapproval, but later [[Romanticism in science|Romantic]]-era natural philosophers viewed these elements as central to his success.  
[[William Whewell]], in his influential ''History of the Inductive Sciences'' of 1837, found Kepler to be the archetype of the inductive scientific genius; in his ''Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences'' of 1840, Whewell held Kepler up as the embodiment of the most advanced forms of [[scientific method]]. Similarly, [[Ernst Friedrich Apelt]]—the first to extensively study Kepler's manuscripts, after their purchase by [[Catherine the Great]]—identified Kepler as a key to the "[[Scientific revolution|Revolution of the sciences]]". 
Apelt, who saw Kepler's mathematics, aesthetic sensibility, physical ideas, and theology as part of a unified system of thought, produced the first extended analysis of Kepler's life and work.&lt;ref&gt;Jardine, "Koyré's Kepler/Kepler's Koyré," pp.&amp;nbsp;363–367&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alexandre Koyré]]'s work on Kepler was, after Apelt, the first major milestone in historical interpretations of Kepler's cosmology and its influence. In the 1930s and 1940s, Koyré, and a number of others in the first generation of professional historians of science, described the "[[Scientific Revolution]]" as the central event in the history of science, and Kepler as a (perhaps the) central figure in the revolution. Koyré placed Kepler's theorization, rather than his empirical work, at the center of the intellectual transformation from ancient to modern world-views. Since the 1960s, the volume of historical Kepler scholarship has expanded greatly, including studies of his astrology and meteorology, his geometrical methods, the role of his religious views in his work, his literary and rhetorical methods, his interaction with the broader cultural and philosophical currents of his time, and even his role as an historian of science.&lt;ref&gt;Jardine, "Koyré's Kepler/Kepler's Koyré," pp.&amp;nbsp;367–372; Shapin, ''The Scientific Revolution'', pp.&amp;nbsp;1–2&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosophers of science—such as [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], [[Norwood Russell Hanson]], [[Stephen Toulmin]], and [[Karl Popper]]—have repeatedly turned to Kepler: examples of [[Commensurability (philosophy of science)|incommensurability]], [[analogical reasoning]], falsification, and many other philosophical concepts have been found in Kepler's work. Physicist [[Wolfgang Pauli]] even used Kepler's priority dispute with Robert Fludd to explore the implications of [[analytical psychology]] on scientific investigation.&lt;ref&gt;Pauli, "The Influence of Archetypical Ideas"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Editions and translations===
Modern translations of a number of Kepler's books appeared in the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries, the systematic publication of his collected works began in 1937 (and is nearing completion in the early 21st century).

An edition in eight volumes, '' Kepleri Opera omnia,'' was prepared by  Christian Frisch (1807–1881), during  1858 to 1871, on the occasion of Kepler's 300th birthday.
Frisch's edition only included Kepler's Latin, with a Latin commentary.

A new edition was planned beginning in 1914 by [[Walther von Dyck]] (1856–1934). Dyck compiled copies of Kepler's unedited manuscripts, using international diplomatic contacts to convince the Soviet authorities to lend him the manuscripts kept in Leningrad for photographic reproduction. These manuscripts contained several works by Kepler that had not been available to Frisch. Dyck's photographs remain the basis for the modern editions of Kepler's unpublished manuscripts.

Max Caspar (1880–1956) published his German translation of Kepler's ''Mysterium Cosmographicum'' in 1923.  
Both Dyck and Caspar were influenced in their interest in Kepler by mathematician [[Alexander von Brill]] (1842–1935). 
Caspar became Dyck's collaborator, succeeding him as project leader in 1934, establishing the ''Kepler-Kommission'' in the following year. Assisted by Martha List (1908–1992) and Franz Hammer (1898–1979), Caspar continued editorial work during World War II. 
Max Caspar also published a biography of Kepler in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;Gingerich, introduction to Caspar's ''Kepler'', pp.&amp;nbsp;3–4&lt;/ref&gt;  The commission was later chaired by Volker Bialas (during 1976–2003) and Ulrich Grigull (during 1984–1999) and [[Roland Bulirsch]] (1998–2014).&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Popular science and historical fiction===
Kepler has acquired a popular image as an icon of scientific modernity and a man before his time; science popularizer [[Carl Sagan]] described him as "the first [[astrophysics|astrophysicist]] and the last scientific astrologer".&lt;ref&gt;Quote from Carl Sagan, ''[[Cosmos: A Personal Voyage]]'', episode III: "The Harmony of the Worlds". Kepler was hardly the first to combine physics and astronomy; however, according to the traditional (though disputed) interpretation of the [[Scientific Revolution]], he would be the first astrophysicist in the era of modern science.&lt;/ref&gt;

The debate over Kepler's place in the Scientific Revolution has  produced a wide variety of philosophical and popular treatments. One of the most influential is [[Arthur Koestler]]'s 1959 ''[[The Sleepwalkers (Koestler book)|The Sleepwalkers]]'', in which Kepler is unambiguously the hero (morally and theologically as well as intellectually) of the revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Toulmin, Review of ''The Sleepwalkers'' in ''The Journal of Philosophy'', Vol. 59, no. 18 (1962), pp.&amp;nbsp;500–503&lt;/ref&gt;

A well-received, if fanciful, historical novel by [[John Banville]], ''Kepler'' (1981), explored many of the themes developed in Koestler's non-fiction narrative and in the philosophy of science.&lt;ref&gt;William Donahue, "A Novelist's Kepler," Journal for the History of Astronomy, Vol. 13 (1982), pp.&amp;nbsp;135–136; "Dancing the grave dance: Science, art and religion in John Banville's ''Kepler''," ''English Studies'', Vol. 86, no. 5 (October 2005), pp.&amp;nbsp;424–438&lt;/ref&gt;  
Somewhat more fanciful is a recent work of nonfiction, ''Heavenly Intrigue'' (2004), suggesting that Kepler murdered Tycho Brahe to gain access to his data.&lt;ref&gt;[[Marcelo Gleiser]], "Kepler in the Dock", review of Gilder and Gilder's ''Heavenly Intrigue'', ''Journal for the History of Astronomy'', Vol. 35, pt. 4 (2004), pp.&amp;nbsp;487–489&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Veneration and eponymy===
In Austria, Kepler left behind such a historical legacy that he was one of the motifs of a silver collector's coin: the [[Euro gold and silver commemorative coins (Austria)#2002 coinage|10-euro Johannes Kepler silver coin]], minted on September 10, 2002. The reverse side of the coin has a portrait of Kepler, who spent some time teaching in Graz and the surrounding areas. Kepler was acquainted with [[Hans Ulrich von Eggenberg|Prince Hans Ulrich von Eggenberg]] personally, and he probably influenced the construction of [[Eggenberg Castle]] (the motif of the obverse of the coin). In front of him on the coin is the model of nested spheres and polyhedra from ''Mysterium Cosmographicum''.&lt;ref name="Eggenberg Palace coin"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://austrian-mint.at/silbermuenzen?l=en&amp;muenzeSubTypeId=108&amp;muenzeId=336 | title=Eggenberg Palace coin | publisher=Austrian Mint | accessdate=September 9, 2009 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110531210659/http://www.austrian-mint.at/silbermuenzen?l=en | archivedate=May 31, 2011 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The German composer [[Paul Hindemith]] wrote an opera about Kepler entitled ''[[Die Harmonie der Welt]]'', and a symphony of the same name was derived from music for the opera.
[[Philip Glass]] wrote an opera called ''[[Kepler (opera)|Kepler]]'' based on Kepler's life (2009).

Kepler is honored together with Nicolaus Copernicus with a [[feast day]] on the [[Calendar of saints (Episcopal Church in the United States of America)|liturgical calendar of the Episcopal Church (USA)]] on May 23.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://satucket.com/lectionary/Calendar.htm|title=Calendar of the Church Year according to the Episcopal Church|publisher=Charles Wohlers|accessdate=October 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Joseph Rémi Léopold Delbœuf''' (September 30, 1831 in [[Liege, Belgium]] – August 14, 1896 in [[Bonn, Germany]]) was a Belgian [[philosopher]], [[mathematician]], [[experimental psychologist]], [[hypnotist]] and [[psychophysicist]].&lt;ref name="zusne_Bio"/&gt; He was a highly respected as a psychologist in his lifetime, the author of an extensive and diverse works, and is known for his work on hypnosis as well as for his important contribution to the debate around the psychophysical.

==Biography==
In 1860 he became an instructor in the normal school of Liege, and in 1863-66 was professor of philosophy in [[Ghent]]. Beginning in 1866, he was professor at [[University of Liège]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite NIE|wstitle=Delbœuf, Joseph Remi Léopold}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
Delboeuf began his psychophysical experimentation on [[brightness]] in 1865 with [[Gustav Fechner]]. The most important idea that Delboeuf introduced to psychophysics was that of the sense distance (''contraste sensible'').&lt;ref name="zusne_Bio"/&gt;

Delboeuf is probably best known for his description the [[Delboeuf illusion]] in 1893. Many experiments have been performed on this illusion since that time.

'''Mark Franklyn Hawthorne''' (born 1962) is an [[United States|American]] animal advocate and writer.  He is the author of three books: ''[[Striking at the Roots|Striking at the Roots: A Practical Guide to Animal Activism]]'' (2007), ''Bleating Hearts: The Hidden World of Animal Suffering'' (2013), and ''A Vegan Ethic: Embracing A Life Of Compassion Toward All'' (2016).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Molidor |first= Jennifer |title= Bleating Hearts: the Hidden World of Animal Suffering |type= book review |url= http://aldf.org/blog/bleating-hearts-the-hidden-world-of-animal-suffering/ |date= 2013-12-11 |publisher= [[Animal Legal Defense Fund]] |accessdate= 2014-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''A Vegan Ethic,'' he urges vegans to be inclusive in their compassion, explaining that is the only course for activists to take if they want to free nonhuman animals from exploitation—that victory for the animal liberation movement will only come through working for liberation for all marginalized groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Smith |first= Gary |title= A Mark Hawthorne Ethic |type= interview |url= http://thethinkingvegan.com/interviews/mark-hawthorne-ethic/ |date= 2017-07-07 |publisher= The Thinking Vegan |accessdate= 2017-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hawthorne is [[veganism|vegan]] and has published around 100 articles or entries in books and magazines on vegetarianism and animal rights. He has been writing for magazines since about 1987.&lt;ref name=scream&gt;{{cite interview|last=Hawthorne |first=Mark |subjectlink=Mark Hawthorne (author) |interviewer=Shari Black Velvet |title=Mark Hawthorne |url=http://www.saveascream.com/markhawthorne.htm |website=Save A Scream |date=August 2009 |accessdate=2014-07-23 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120712080039/http://www.saveascream.com/markhawthorne.htm |archivedate=2012-07-12 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[James E. McWilliams]] says:  "Bleating Hearts is the most comprehensive single compendium of animal exploitation that exists. ...

{{Global surveillance}}

'''Mass surveillance''' is the intricate [[surveillance]] of an entire or a substantial fraction of a population in order to monitor that group of citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Mass Surveillance |url=https://www.privacyinternational.org/node/52 |publisher=Privacy International |accessdate=20 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The surveillance is often carried out by [[Convenience store|local]] and federal governments or [[intelligence agency|governmental organisations]], such as organizations like the [[National Security Agency|NSA]] and the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], but it may also be carried out by corporations (either on behalf of governments or at their own initiative). Depending on each nation's laws and judicial systems, the legality of and the permission required to engage in mass surveillance varies. It is the single most indicative distinguishing trait of [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian regimes]]. It is also often distinguished from [[targeted surveillance]].

Mass surveillance has often been cited as necessary to fight [[terrorism]], prevent [[crime]] and [[social unrest]], protect [[national security]], and control the population. Conversely, mass surveillance has equally often been criticized for violating [[privacy]] rights, limiting [[Civil and political rights|civil and political rights and freedoms]], and being illegal under some legal or constitutional systems. Another criticism is that increasing mass surveillance could lead to the development of a [[#Surveillance state|surveillance state]] or an [[#Electronic police state|electronic police state]] where civil liberties are infringed or political dissent is undermined by [[COINTELPRO]]-like programs. Such a state could be referred to as a [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian state]].

In 2013, the practice of mass surveillance by world&lt;ref&gt;

==By country==
[[Privacy International]]'s 2007 survey, covering 47 countries, indicated that there had been an increase in surveillance and a decline in the performance of privacy safeguards, compared to the previous year. Balancing these factors, eight countries were rated as being 'endemic surveillance societies'. Of these eight, [[China]], [[Malaysia]] and [[Russia]] scored lowest, followed jointly by [[Singapore]] and the [[United Kingdom]], then jointly by [[Taiwan]], [[Thailand]] and the [[United States]]. The best ranking was given to [[Greece]], which was judged to have 'adequate safeguards against abuse'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.privacyinternational.org/reports/surveillance-monitor-2007-international-country-rankings |title=Surveillance Monitor 2007 - International country rankings |publisher=[[Privacy International]] |date=28 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many countries throughout the world have already been adding thousands of surveillance cameras to their urban, suburban and even rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/?p=9662 |title=Police Surveillance: Go Snoop, Yourself |author=Tom Steinert-Threlkeld |publisher=ZDNet |date=13 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="yougov1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.yougov.co.uk/extranets/ygarchives/content/pdf/TEL060101024_3.pdf |title=YouGov / Daily Telegraph Survey Results |year=2006 |publisher=YouGov |accessdate=15 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in September 2007 the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) stated that we are "in danger of tipping into a genuine surveillance society completely alien to American values" with "the potential for a dark future where our every move, our every transaction, our every communication is recorded, compiled, and stored away, ready to be examined and used against us by the authorities whenever they want."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.aclu.org/technology-and-liberty/why-surveillance-society-clock |publisher=American Civil Liberties Union |title= Why a Surveillance Society Clock? |date=4 September 2007 |accessdate=15 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 March 2013, [[Reporters Without Borders]] published a ''Special report on Internet Surveillance''. The report included a list of "State Enemies of the Internet", countries whose governments are involved in active, intrusive surveillance of news providers, resulting in grave violations of freedom of information and human rights. Five countries were placed on the initial list: [[Bahrain]], [[China]], [[Iran]], [[Syria]], and [[Vietnam]].&lt;ref name=RSFSRS-March2013&gt;[http://surveillance.rsf.org/en/ ''The Enemies of the Internet Special Edition : Surveillance''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130831072750/http://surveillance.rsf.org/en/ |date=31 August 2013 }}, Reporters Without Borders, 12 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
{{Main article|Mass surveillance in Australia}}

===Bahrain===
[[Bahrain]] is one of the five countries on Reporters Without Borders' March 2013 list of "State Enemies of the Internet", countries whose governments are involved in active, intrusive surveillance of news providers, resulting in grave violations of freedom of information and human rights. The level of Internet filtering and surveillance in Bahrain is one of the highest in the world. The royal family is represented in all areas of Internet management and has sophisticated tools at its disposal for spying on its subjects. The online activities of dissidents and news providers are closely monitored and the surveillance is increasing.&lt;ref name=RSFSRS-March2013/&gt;

===Canada===
{{Main article|Mass surveillance in Canada}}

===China===
{{Main article|Mass surveillance in China}}
[[China]] is one of the five countries on Reporters Without Borders' March 2013 list of "State Enemies of the Internet", countries whose governments are involved in active, intrusive surveillance of news providers, resulting in grave violations of freedom of information and human rights. All Internet access in China is owned or controlled by the state or the [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]]. Many foreign journalists in China have said that they take for granted that their telephones are tapped and their email is monitored.&lt;ref name=RSFSRS-March2013/&gt;

The tools put in place to filter and monitor the Internet are collectively known as the [[Great Firewall of China]]. Besides the usual routing regulations that allow access to an IP address or a particular domain name to be blocked, the Great Firewall makes large-scale use of [[Deep Packet Inspection]] (DPI) technology to monitor and block access based on keyword detection. The Great Firewall has the ability to dynamically block encrypted connections. One of the country's main ISPs, [[China Unicom]], automatically cuts a connection as soon as it is used to transmit encrypted content.&lt;ref name=RSFSRS-March2013/&gt;

The monitoring system developed by China is not confined to the Great Firewall, monitoring is also built into social networks, chat services and VoIP. Private companies are directly responsible to the Chinese authorities for surveillance of their networks to ensure banned messages are not circulated. The QQ application, owned by the firm Tencent, allows the authorities to monitor in detail exchanges between Internet users by seeking certain keywords and expressions. The author of each message can be identified by his or her user number. The QQ application is effectively a giant Trojan horse. And since March 2012, new legislation requires all new users of micro-blogging sites to register using their own name and telephone number.&lt;ref name=RSFSRS-March2013/&gt;

[[Skype]], one of the world's most popular Internet telephone platforms, is closely monitored. Skype services in China are available through a local partner, the TOM media group. The Chinese-language version of Skype, known as [[TOM-Skype]], is slightly different from the downloadable versions in other countries. A report by [[OpenNet Initiative|OpenNet Initiative Asia]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oni-asia.net/ ONI Asia], web site, OpenNet Initiative, retrieved 15 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; says everyday conversations are captured on servers. Interception and storage of a conversation may be triggered by a sender's or recipient's name or by keywords that occur in the conversation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nartv.org/mirror/breachingtrust.pdf "Breaching Trust: An analysis of surveillance and security practices on China's TOM-Skype platform"], Nart Villeneuve, Information Warfare Monitor and ONI Asia, 1 October 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 30 January, the ''[[New York Times]]'' reported that it had been the target of attacks by the Chinese government. The first breach took place on 13 September 2012 when the newspaper was preparing to publish an article about the fortune amassed by the family of outgoing Prime Minister [[Wen Jiabao]]. The newspaper said the purpose of attacks was to identify the sources that supplied the newspaper with information about corruption among the prime minister's entourage. The ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' and ''[[CNN]]'' also said they had been the targets of cyber attacks from China. In February, [[Twitter]] disclosed that the accounts of some 250,000 subscribers had been the victims of attacks from China similar to those carried out on the ''New York Times''. Mandiant, the company engaged by the NYT to secure its network, identified the source of the attacks as a group of hackers it called Advanced Persistent Threat 1, a unit of the People's Liberation Army operating from a 12-story building in the suburbs of Shanghai that had hundreds, possibly thousands, of staff and the direct support of the Chinese government.&lt;ref name=RSFSRS-March2013/&gt;

===East Germany===
{{Main article|Mass surveillance in East Germany}}
Before the Digital Revolution, one of the world's biggest mass surveillance operations was carried out by the [[Stasi]], the [[secret police]] of the former [[East Germany]]. By the time the state collapsed in 1989, the Stasi had built up an estimated civilian network of 300,000 informants (approximately one in fifty of the population), who monitored even minute hints of political dissent among other citizens. Many [[West Germany|West Germans]] visiting friends and family in East Germany were also subject to Stasi spying, as well as many high-ranking West German politicians and persons in the public eye.

Most East German citizens were well aware that their government was spying on them, which led to a culture of mistrust: touchy political issues were only discussed in the comfort of their own four walls and only with the closest of friends and family members, while widely maintaining a façade of unquestioning followership in public.

===European Union===
The right to [[privacy]] is a highly developed area of law in Europe. The [[Data Protection Directive]] regulates the processing of personal data within the [[European Union]]. For comparison, the US has no data protection law that is comparable to this; instead, the US regulates data protection on a sectoral basis.&lt;ref&gt;See Julia M. Fromholz, The European Union Data Privacy Directive, 15 Berkeley Tech. L.J. 471, 472 (2000); Dean William Harvey &amp; Amy White, The Impact of Computer Security Regulation on American Companies, 8 Tex. Wesleyan L. Rev. 505 (2002); Kamaal Zaidi, Harmonizing U.S.-EU Online Privacy Law: Toward a U.S. Comprehensive Regime For the Protection of Personal Data, 12 Mich.St. J. Int’l L. 169 (2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

Since early 2012, the European Union has been working on a [[General Data Protection Regulation]] to replace the [[Data Protection Directive]] and harmonise data protection and privacy law. On 20 October 2013, a committee at the [[European Parliament]] backed the measure, which, if it is enacted, could require American companies to seek clearance from European officials before complying with United States warrants seeking private data. The vote is part of efforts in Europe to shield citizens from online surveillance in the wake of [[2013 mass surveillance disclosures|revelations about a far-reaching spying program]] by the [[U.S. National Security Agency]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/22/business/international/eu-panel-backs-plan-to-shield-online-data.html "Rules Shielding Online Data From N.S.A. and Other Prying Eyes Advance in Europe"], James Kanter and Mike Scott, ''New York Times'', 21 October 2013. Retrieved 22 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; European Union justice and rights commissioner Viviane Reding said "The question has arisen whether the large-scale collection and processing of personal information under US surveillance programmes is necessary and proportionate to meet the interests of national security." The EU is also asking the US for changes to US legislation to match the legal redress offered in Europe; American citizens in Europe can go to the courts if they feel their rights are infringed but Europeans without right of residence in America cannot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Traynor|first=Ian|title=NSA surveillance: Europe threatens to freeze US data-sharing arrangements|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/26/nsa-surveillance-europe-threatens-freeze-us-data-sharing|accessdate=1 December 2013|newspaper=The Guardian|date=26 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the EU / US arrangement to implement [[International Safe Harbor Privacy Principles]] were struck down by the European Court of Justice, a new framework for transatlantic data flows, called the "EU-US Privacy Shield", was adopted in July 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=EU Commission and United States agree on new framework for transatlantic data flows: EU-US Privacy Shield|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-16-216_en.htm|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=24 February 2016|date=2 February 2016|postscript=none}}; {{cite press release|title=Restoring trust in transatlantic data flows through strong safeguards: European Commission presents EU-U.S. Privacy Shield|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-16-433_en.htm|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=7 March 2016|date=29 February 2016|postscript=none}}; {{cite press release|title=European Commission launches EU-U.S. Privacy Shield: stronger protection for transatlantic data flows|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-16-2461_en.htm|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=16 July 2016|date=12 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=U.S. and Europe in ‘Safe Harbor’ Data Deal, but Legal Fight May Await|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/03/technology/us-europe-safe-harbor-data-deal.html?_r=0|accessdate=24 February 2016|work=New York Times|date=2 February 2016|postscript=none}}; {{cite news|title=Privacy Shield deal lets US tech firms transfer European customers' data again|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/jul/08/privacy-shield-data-transfer-us-european-union|accessdate=8 July 2016|work=The Guardian|date=8 July 2016|postscript=none}}; {{cite news|title=Privacy Shield forced US to be ‘transparent’ about intelligence agencies|url=http://www.euractiv.com/section/digital/news/privacy-shield-forced-us-to-be-transparent-about-intelligence-agencies/|work=EurActiv|accessdate=16 July 2016|date=12 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2014, the [[European Court of Justice]] declared invalid the EU [[Data Retention Directive]]. The Court said it violates two basic rights - respect for private life and protection of personal data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Top EU court rejects EU-wide data retention law|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-26935096|accessdate=7 September 2014|publisher=BBC|date=8 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[European Union legislative procedure|legislative body]] of the [[European Union]] passed the [[Directive 2006/24/EC|Data Retention Directive]] on 15 December 2005. It requires that telecommunication operators retain metadata for telephone, Internet, and other telecommunication services for periods of not less than six months and not more than two years from the date of the communication as determined by each EU member state and, upon request, to make the data available to various governmental bodies. Access to this information is not limited to investigation of serious crimes, nor is a warrant required for access.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2006:105:0054:0063:EN:PDF "Directive 2006/24/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 March 2006 on the retention of data generated or processed in connection with the provision of publicly available electronic communications services or of public communications networks and amending Directive 2002/58/EC"], L 105/54, ''Official Journal of the European Union'', 13 April 2006.

===India===
{{Main article |Mass surveillance in India}}
The Indian parliament passed the [[Information Technology Act]] of 2008 with no debate, giving the government fiat power to tap all communications without a court order or a warrant. Section 69 of the act states "Section 69 empowers the Central Government/State Government/ its authorized agency to intercept, monitor or decrypt any information generated, transmitted, received or stored in any computer resource if it is necessary or expedient so to do in the interest of the sovereignty or integrity of India, defence of India, security of the State, friendly relations with foreign States or public order or for preventing incitement to the commission of any cognizable offence or for investigation of any offence."

India is setting up a national intelligence grid called [[NATGRID]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://pib.nic.in/release/release.asp?relid=54679 "Centralised System to Monitor Communications"], reply by Shri [[Gurudas Kamat]], [[Minister of State for Communications and Information Technology]] in [[Rajya Sabha]], [[Press Information Bureau]], 26 November 2009.

===Iran===
[[Iran]] is one of the five countries on Reporters Without Borders' March 2013 list of "State Enemies of the Internet", countries whose governments are involved in naturally active efforts to news providers . The government runs or controls almost all of the country's institutions for regulating, managing or legislating on telecommunications. The Supreme Council for Cyberspace, which was headed by [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad|President Ahmadinejad]], was established in March 2012 and now determines digital policy. The construction of a parallel "Iranian Internet", with a high connection speed but fully monitored and censored, is almost complete.&lt;ref name=RSFSRS-March2013/&gt;

The tools used by the Iranian authorities to monitor and control the Internet include data interception tools capable of [[Deep Packet Inspection]]. Interception products from leading Chinese companies such as [[ZTE]] and [[Huawei]] are in use. The products provided by Huawei to [[Mobin Net]], the leading national provider of mobile broadband, can be used to analyze email content, track browsing history and block access to sites. The products that ZTA sold to the [[Telecommunication Company of Iran]] (TCI) offer similar services plus the possibility of monitoring the mobile network. European companies are the source of other spying and data analysis tools. Products designed by [[Ericsson]] and [[Nokia Solutions and Networks|Nokia Siemens Networks]] (later Trovicor) are in use. These companies sold [[Short Message Service|SMS]] interception and user location products to Mobile Communication Company of Iran and [[Irancell]], Iran's two biggest mobile phone companies, in 2009 and they were used to identify Iranian citizens during the [[2009–10 Iranian election protests|post-election uprising]] in 2009. The use of Israeli surveillance devices has also been detected in Iran. The network traffic management and surveillance device NetEnforcer was provided by Israel to Denmark and then resold to Iran. Similarly, US equipment has found its way to Iran via the Chinese company ZTE.&lt;ref name=RSFSRS-March2013/&gt;

===Malaysia===

In July 2018, the Malaysian police announced the creation of the Malaysian Internet Crime Against Children Investigation Unit (Micac) that is equipped with real-time mass internet surveillance software developed in the United States and is tasked with the monitoring of all Malaysian internet users, with a focus on pornography and child pornography. The system creates a "data library" of users which includes details such as IP addresses, websites, locations, duration and frequency of use and files uploaded and downloaded.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.malaymail.com/s/1650214/watching-porn-cops-now-have-their-eyes-on-you&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nst.com.my/news/exclusive/2018/07/388926/exclusive-police-will-know-if-you-watch-porn&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theonlinecitizen.com/2018/07/20/respect-privacy-and-no-to-monitoring-of-internet-usage-or-activity-in-malaysia-say-asean-ngos/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mexico===
After struggling with drug trafficking and criminal groups for decades Mexico has been strengthening their military mass surveillance. Approximately half of the population in Mexico does not support democracy as a form of government, and believe an authoritarian system is better if social matters are solved through it.&lt;ref&gt;Arteaga, Nelson. 2017. Mexico: Internal security, surveillance, and authoritarianism. Surveillance &amp; Society 15(3/4): 491-495.&lt;/ref&gt; The relevance of these political beliefs may make it easier for mass surveillance to take spread within the country. "This does not necessarily mean the end of democratic institutions as a whole—such as free elections or the permanence of critical mass media—but it means strengthening the mechanisms for exercising power that exclude dialogue, transparency and social agreement."&lt;ref&gt;Arteaga, Nelson. 2017. Mexico: Internal security, surveillance, and authoritarianism. Surveillance &amp; Society 15(3/4): 491-495.(Artega, 494)&lt;/ref&gt; Developing intelligence agencies has been on Mexico's radar for a while for means of security. 

===Netherlands===
According to a 2004 report, the government of the Netherlands carries out more clandestine wire-taps and intercepts than any country, per capita, in the world.&lt;ref name="Italy and the Netherlands top wiretaps chart. EDRi-gram 15 July 2004 from EDRI.org"&gt;[https://edri.org/edrigramnumber2-14wiretap/ "Italy and the Netherlands top wiretap chart"], Digital Civil Rights in Europe, EDRI-gram Number 2.14, 15 July 2004. Retrieved 17 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The Dutch military intelligence service MIVD operates a satellite ground station to intercept foreign satellite links and also a facility to eavesdrop on foreign high-frequency radio traffic.

===North Korea===
{{Main article|Mass surveillance in North Korea}}
Having attained the nickname ‘surveillance state’, North Korea's government has complete control over all forms of telecommunications and Internet.  It is routine to be sent to a prison camp for communicating with the outside world. The government enforces restrictions around the types of appliances North Koreans may own in their home, in case radio or TV sets pick up signals from nearby South Korea, China and Russia.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amnesty.org.uk/north-korea-surveillance-state-prison-camp-internet-phone-technology&lt;/ref&gt; There is no attempt to mask the way this government actively spies on their citizens. In North Korea, an increasing number of citizens do have smartphones. However, these devices are heavily controlled and are being used to censor and observe everything North Koreans do on their phones. Reuters reported in 2015 that Koryolink, North Korea's official mobile phone network, has around 3 million subscribers in a country of 24 million. Obviously, in order to have digital data to draw from, the citizens must have access to phones and other things online.

===Russia===
{{Main article|Mass surveillance in Russia}}
The [[SORM]] (and SORM-2) laws enable complete monitoring of any [[communication]], [[Telecommunication|electronic]] or traditional, by eight state agencies, without warrant. These laws seem to be in conflict with Article 23 of the [[Constitution of Russia]] which states:&lt;ref name="1993const"&gt;[http://www.constitution.ru/en/10003000-03.htm "Chapter 2. Rights and Freedoms of Man And Citizen"], ''Constitution of Russia''. Retrieved 17 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

# Everyone shall have the right to privacy of correspondence, of telephone conversations, postal, telegraph and other messages. Limitations of this right shall be allowed only by court decision.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;In 2015, the [[European Court of Human Rights|European Court for Human Rights]] ruled that the legislation violated [[Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights]] (''[[Zakharov v. Russia]]'').

[[Yarovaya Law]] required storage and unconditional access to private communication data for law enforcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/06/23/draconian-law-rammed-through-russian-parliament|title=Draconian Law Rammed Through Russian Parliament|date=2016-06-23|access-date=2016-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Singapore===
[[Singapore]] is known as a city of sensors. Singapore's surveillance structure spreads widely from [[Closed-circuit television]] in public areas even around the neighbourhood, internet monitoring/ traffic monitoring and to the use of surveillance [[metadata]] for government initiatives. In [[Singapore]], SIM card registration is mandatory even for prepaid card. Singapore's government have the rights to access communication data. Singapore's largest telecompany, [[Singtel]], has close relations to the government and Singapore's laws are broadly phrased to allow the government to obtain sensitive data such as text-messages, email, call logs and web surfing history from its people without the need for court permission.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.techinasia.com/singapore-advanced-surveillance-state-citizens-mind&lt;/ref&gt;

The installation of mass surveillance cameras in [[Singapore]] is an effort to act as a deterrence not only for terror attacks&lt;ref name="more-surveillance"&gt;http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/more-surveillance-cameras-as-deterrent&lt;/ref&gt; but also for public security such as loan sharks, illegal parking and more.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/network-of-cctv-cameras-proving-effective&lt;/ref&gt; As part of Singapore's [[Smart Nation]] initiative to build a network of sensors to collect and connect data from city life (including the citizen's movement), the Singapore government rolled out 1000 sensors ranging from computer chips to surveillance cameras,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.citylab.com/life/2017/04/singapore-city-of-sensors/523392/&lt;/ref&gt; to track almost everything in Singapore from air quality to public safety in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/1000-sensors-to-be-rolled-out-in-singapore-as-part-of-smart-nation-plan&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, in a bid to increase security, the [[Singapore Police Force]] installed 62,000 police cameras in 10,000 [[Housing and Development Board]] (HDB) blocks covering the lifts and multi-storey car parks.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/installation-of-62000-police-cameras-in-10000-hdb-blocks-multi-storey-carparks-complete&lt;/ref&gt; With rising security concerns, the number of CCTV cameras in public areas such as monitoring of the public transport system and commercial/ government buildings in [[Singapore]] is set to increase.&lt;ref name="more-surveillance"/&gt;

In 2018, the [[Singapore]] government would be rolling out new and more advanced surveillance systems. Starting with Singapore's maritime borders, new panoramic electro-optic sensors will be put in place on the north and south coasts, monitoring a 360-degree view of the area.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/bevy-of-cameras-high-tech-sensors-to-secure-shoreline&lt;/ref&gt; A tethered [[unmanned aerial vehicle]] (UAV) will also be operational, which can be used during search and rescue operations including hostage situations and public order incidents.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/new-drones-command-vehicles-to-help-police-fight-crime-better-9819786&lt;/ref&gt;

===Syria===
[[Syria]] is one of the five countries on Reporters Without Borders' March 2013 list of "State Enemies of the Internet", countries whose governments are involved in active, intrusive surveillance of news providers, resulting in grave violations of freedom of information and human rights. Syria has stepped up its web censorship and cyber-monitoring as the [[Syrian civil war|country's civil war]] has intensified. At least 13 [[Blue Coat Systems|Blue Coat proxy servers]] are in use, [[Skype]] calls are intercepted, and [[Social engineering (security)|social engineering techniques]], [[phishing]], and [[malware]] attacks are all in use.&lt;ref name=RSFSRS-March2013/&gt;

===Turkey===
The failed coup attempt June 15, 2016 led to an authoritarian shift that uses mass surveillance to suppress opposite views. Digital surveillance is part of everyday life due to the box the government puts the Turkish citizens in. It is increasingly difficult to release any academic knowledge beyond what the Turkish government wants to be released. They have a digital and physical strong hold over any knowledge that goes against their regime. Today, the surveillance of academicians goes along with the state's oppression in Turkey. It is hard to say what will happen in the next few years in Turkey as they become increasingly more authoritarian. The centralization of state power along with digitalization expands the scope of the state surveillance. The digitalization and the centralization of state power are closely related to the regime of power that becomes prominent in this conjuncture.&lt;ref name="State vs. Academy 550-556"&gt;2017. State vs. Academy in Turkey: Academy Under Surveillance. Surveillance &amp; Society 15(3/4): 550-556.&lt;/ref&gt;  National security and terrorism are Turkey's main explanations to the world on this topic, although there is clearly more happening there. According to the report of Human Rights Joint Platform published on February 23, 2017, during the nine months period of the state of emergency, the number of dismissed academicians reached 4,811, increasing to 7,619 with the addition of academicians who were working in the universities closed after the failed coup attempt.&lt;ref name="State vs. Academy 550-556"/&gt; The extended surveillance in Turkey helped them to control the population at a massive scale.

===United Kingdom===
{{Main article |Mass surveillance in the United Kingdom}}

State surveillance in the [[United Kingdom]] has formed part of the public consciousness since the 19th century. The postal espionage crisis of 1844 sparked the first panic over the privacy of citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.historyandpolicy.org/policy-papers/papers/surveillance-privacy-and-history|title=Surveillance, privacy and history|last=Vincent|first=David|date=1 October 2013|website=History &amp; Policy|publisher=History &amp; Policy|access-date=27 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in the 20th century, electronic surveillance capabilities grew out of wartime [[signal intelligence]] and pioneering [[code breaking]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=How the British and Americans started listening in|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-35491822|accessdate=24 February 2016|work=BBC|date=8 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1946, the [[Government Communications Headquarters]] (GCHQ) was formed. The United Kingdom and the United States signed the bilateral [[UKUSA Agreement]] in 1948. It was later broadened to include Canada, Australia and New Zealand, as well as cooperation with several "third-party" nations. This became the cornerstone of Western intelligence gathering and the "[[Special Relationship]]" between the UK and the USA.&lt;ref name="timecoldwar"&gt;{{cite web|last=Adam White|title=How a Secret Spy Pact Helped Win the Cold War|url=http://content.time.com/time/nation/article/0,8599,2000262,00.html|publisher=''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''|date=29 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the growth of the Internet and development of the [[World Wide Web]], a series of [[2013 Global surveillance disclosure|media reports in 2013]] revealed more recent programs and techniques involving GCHQ, such as [[Tempora]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=US and Britain team up on mass surveillance|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/jun/22/nsa-leaks-britain-us-surveillance|accessdate=13 May 2015|newspaper=The Guardian|date=22 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of these capabilities is controlled by laws made in the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|UK Parliament]]. In particular, access to the content of private messages (that is, interception of a communication) must be authorized by a warrant signed by a [[Secretary of State (United Kingdom)|Secretary of State]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Andrew Marr Show Interview: Theresa May, MP Home Secretary|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/pdfs/2311201402.pdf|accessdate=6 December 2014|publisher=BBC|date=23 November 2014|quote=Well I guess what he’s talking about is the fact that for certain aspects and certain of the more intrusive measures that our security service and police have available to them – i.e. Intercept, intercepting people’s telephones and some other intrusive measures – the decision is taken by the Secretary of State, predominantly me. A significant part of my job is looking at these warrants and signing these warrants. I think it’s ... Some people argue that should be to judges....I think it’s very important that actually those decisions are being taken by somebody who is democratically accountable to the public. I think that’s an important part of our system.

Many advanced nation-states have implemented laws that partially protect citizens from unwarranted intrusion, such as the [[Human Rights Act 1998]] and [[Data Protection Act 1998]] in the United Kingdom, and laws that require a formal warrant before private data may be gathered by a government.

The UK is a member of the [[European Union]], participates in its programs, and is subject to [[Mass surveillance#European Union|EU policies and directives on surveillance]].

The vast majority of video surveillance cameras in the UK are not operated by government bodies, but by private individuals or companies, especially to monitor the interiors of shops and businesses.

{{NSA surveillance}}

Historically, mass surveillance was used as part of wartime censorship to control communications that could damage the war effort and aid the enemy. For example, during the world wars, every international telegram from or to the United States sent through companies such as [[Western Union]] was reviewed by the US military. After the wars were over, surveillance continued in programs such as the [[Black Chamber]] following World War I and [[Project SHAMROCK|project Shamrock]] following World War II.&lt;ref&gt;[[James Bamford]] (2008), ''[[The Shadow Factory]]'', Doubleday, {{ISBN|0-385-52132-4}}, Chapter 'Shamrock', especially pg. 163.&lt;/ref&gt; [[COINTELPRO]] projects conducted by the U.S. Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) between 1956 and 1971 targeted various "subversive" organizations, including peaceful anti-war and racial equality activists such as [[Albert Einstein]] and [[Martin Luther King Jr]].

Billions of dollars per year are spent, by agencies such as the [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) and the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI), to develop, purchase, implement, and operate systems such as [[Carnivore (FBI)|Carnivore]], [[Echelon (signals intelligence)|ECHELON]], and [[NarusInsight]] to intercept and analyze the immense amount of data that traverses the Internet and telephone system every day.&lt;ref name="zdnet-fbi"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.zdnet.com/news/fbi-turns-to-broad-new-wiretap-method/151059  |title=FBI turns to broad new wiretap method |last=McCullagh |first=Declan |date=30 January 2007 |work=ZDNet News|accessdate=2009-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the [[September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks]], a vast domestic intelligence apparatus has been built to collect information using the NSA, FBI, local police, state homeland security offices and military criminal investigators. The intelligence apparatus collects, analyzes and stores information about millions of (if not all) American citizens, many of whom have not been accused of any wrongdoing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://projects.washingtonpost.com/top-secret-america/articles/monitoring-america/ |work=Top Secret America, A Washington Post Investigation |title=Monitoring America |author=Data Priest and William M.

They have also performed extensive analysis of [[social network analysis|social networks]] such as [[Myspace]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120720043006/http://news.com.com/2061-10789_3-6082047.html "Is the NSA reading your MySpace profile?"], Dawn Kawamoto, ''CNET News'', 9 June 2006.

Modern surveillance in the United States was thought of more of a wartime effort before Snowden disclosed in depth information about the National Security Agency in June 2013.&lt;ref name="van der Vlist 137-157"&gt;van der Vlist, Fernando N. 2017. Counter-Mapping Surveillance: A Critical Cartography of Mass Surveillance Technology After Snowden. Surveillance &amp; Society 15(1): 137-157.&lt;/ref&gt; The constant development and improvements of the Internet and technology has made it easier for mass surveillance to take hold. Such revelations allow critical commentators to raise questions and scrutinize the implementation, use, and abuse of networking technologies, devices, and software systems that partake in a “global surveillant assemblage” (Bogard 2006; Collier and Ong 2004; Haggerty and Ericson 2000; Murakami Wood 2013).&lt;ref name="van der Vlist 137-157"/&gt;  The NSA collected millions of Verizon user's telephone records in between 2013-2014. The NSA also collected data through Google and Facebook with a program called 'Prism'. Journalists through Snowden published nearly 7,000 top-secret documents since then, yet the information disclosed seems to be less than 1% of the entire information. Having access to every individual's private records seems to directly contradict the fourth amendment. 

===Vietnam===
[[Vietnam]] is one of the five countries on Reporters Without Borders' March 2013 list of "State Enemies of the Internet", countries whose governments are involved in active, intrusive surveillance of news providers, resulting in grave violations of freedom of information and human rights. Most of the country's 16 service providers are directly or indirectly controlled by the [[Vietnamese Communist Party]]. The industry leader, [[Vietnam Posts and Telecommunications Group]], which controls 74 per cent of the market, is state-owned. So is [[Viettel Mobile|Viettel]], an enterprise of the [[Ministry of Defence (Vietnam)|Vietnamese armed forces]].

Service providers are the major instruments of control and surveillance. Bloggers monitored by the government frequently undergo [[man-in-the-middle attack]]s. These are designed to intercept data meant to be sent to secure (https) sites, allowing passwords and other communication to be intercepted.&lt;ref name=RSFSRS-March2013/&gt; According to a July 2012 [[Freedom House]] report, 91 percent of survey respondents connected to the Internet on their mobile devices and the government monitors conversations and tracks the calls of "activists" or "reactionaries."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.freedomhouse.org/sites/default/files/Safety%20on%20the%20Line%20vFINAL.pdf "Country Report: Socialist Republic of Vietnam"], ''Safety on the Line'', Cormac Callanan and Hein Dries-Ziekenheiner, Freedom House, July 2012.

==Commercial mass surveillance==
{{Further information|Mass surveillance industry}}
As a result of the [[digital revolution]], many aspects of life are now captured and stored in digital form. Concern has been expressed that governments may use this information to conduct mass surveillance on their populations. Commercial mass surveillance often makes use of [[copyright]] laws and "[[Clickwrap|user agreements]]" to obtain (typically uninformed) 'consent' to surveillance from consumers who use their software or other related materials. This allows gathering of information which would be technically illegal if performed by government agencies. This data is then often shared with government agencies - thereby - in practice - defeating the purpose of such privacy protections.

One of the most common forms of mass surveillance is carried out by commercial organizations. Many people are willing to join supermarket and grocery [[loyalty card]] programs, trading their personal information and surveillance of their shopping habits in exchange for a discount on their groceries, although base prices might be increased to encourage participation in the program.

Through programs like [[Google]]'s [[AdSense]], [[OpenSocial]] and their increasing pool of so-called "web gadgets", "social gadgets" and other Google-hosted services many web sites on the Internet are effectively feeding user information about sites visited by the users, and now also their social connections, to Google. [[Facebook]] also keep this information, although its acquisition is limited to page views within Facebook. This data is valuable for authorities, advertisers and others interested in profiling users, trends and web site marketing performance. Google, Facebook and others are increasingly becoming more guarded about this data as their reach increases and the data becomes more all inclusive, making it more valuable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://techcrunch.com/2008/05/15/he-said-she-said-in-google-v-facebook/ |title=He Said, She Said In Google v. Facebook |accessdate=14 August 2009 |last=Arrington |first=Michael |date=15 May 2008 |publisher=TechCrunch |doi= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

New features like [[geolocation]] give an even increased admission of monitoring capabilities to large service providers like Google, where they also are enabled to track one's physical movements while users are using mobile devices, especially those which are syncing without any user interaction. Google's [[Gmail]] service is increasingly employing features to work as a stand-alone application which also might activate while a web browser is not even active for synchronizing; a feature mentioned on the [[Google I/O]] 2009 developer conference while showing the upcoming [[HTML5]] features which Google and others are actively defining and promoting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |title="Google's HTML 5 Work: What's Next?" (62 minute video) |date=28 May 2009 |first=Matthew |last=Papakipos |work=Google I/O 2009 |publisher=YouTube |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AusOPz8Ww80 |accessdate=19 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 at the [[World Economic Forum]] in [[Davos]], Google CEO Eric Schmidt, said: "The arrival of a truly mobile Web, offering a new generation of location-based advertising, is set to unleash a 'huge revolution'".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSL2563364020080125 |title=Google CEO bullish on mobile Web advertising |accessdate=28 February 2010 |date=25 January 2008 |agency=Reuters |doi= |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
At the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona on 16 February 2010, Google presented their vision of a new business model for mobile operators and trying to convince mobile operators to embrace [[location-based service]]s and advertising. With Google as the advertising provider, it would mean that every mobile operator using their location-based advertising service would be revealing the location of their mobile customers to Google.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |title=Keynote speech (video) |work=2010 Mobile World Congress Barcelona |date=16 February 2010 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YuqiE2lukDM |accessdate=28 February 2010 |first=Eric |last=Schmidt |publisher=YouTube |location=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Cquote|Google will also know more about the customer - because it benefits the customer to tell Google more about them. The more we know about the customer, the better the quality of searches, the better the quality of the apps. The operator one is "required", if you will, and the Google one will be optional. And today I would say, a minority choose to do that, but I think over time a majority will... because of the stored values in the servers and so forth and so on....|4=2010 Mobile World Congress keynote speech|5=Google CEO Eric Schmidt&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |title=Keynote speech (video) |work=2010 Mobile World Congress Barcelona |date=16 February 2010  |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BuzSOo50XSg |accessdate=28 February 2010 |first=Eric |last=Schmidt |publisher=YouTube }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Organizations like the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] are constantly informing users on the importance of privacy, and considerations about technologies like geolocation.

The five companies on the initial list were: [[Amesys]] (France), [[Blue Coat Systems]] (U.S.), Gamma (UK and Germany), Hacking Team (Italy), and Trovicor (Germany), but the list was not exhaustive and is likely to be expanded in the future.&lt;ref name=RSFSRS-March2013/&gt;

==Surveillance state==
A surveillance state is a country where the government engages in pervasive surveillance of large numbers of its citizens and visitors. Such widespread surveillance is usually justified as being necessary for [[national security]], such as to prevent crime or acts of terrorism, but may also be used to stifle criticism of and opposition to the government.

Examples of early surveillance states include the former [[Soviet Union]] and the former [[East Germany]], which had a large network of informers and an advanced technology base in computing and spy-camera technology.&lt;ref&gt;[[Manuel Castells]], (August 2009), [http://www.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1405196866.html ''The Rise of the Network Society''], 2nd edition, Wiley Blackwell, {{ISBN|978-1-4051-9686-4}}. Retrieved 23 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; But these states did not have today's technologies for mass surveillance, such as the use of [[database]]s and [[pattern recognition]] software to cross-correlate information obtained by [[wire tapping]], including [[speech recognition]] and telecommunications [[traffic analysis]], monitoring of financial transactions, [[automatic number plate recognition]], the tracking of the position of mobile telephones, and [[facial recognition system]]s and the like which recognize people by their appearance, [[Gait (human)|gait]], [[DNA profiling]], etc.

===Smart cities===
{{Main article|Smart city}}

The development of smart cities has seen the increased adoption of surveillance technologies by governments, although the primary purpose of surveillance in such cities is to [[Smart city#Characteristics|use information and communication technologies]] to improve the urban environment. The implementation of such technology by [[Smart city#Flagship cases|a number of cities]] has resulted in increased efficiencies in urban infrastructure as well as improved community participation. Sensors and systems monitor a smart city's infrastructure, operations and activities and aim to help it run more efficiently. For example, the city could use less electricity; its traffic run more smoothly with fewer delays; its citizens use the city with more safety; hazards can be dealt with faster; citizen infractions of rules can be prevented, and the city's infrastructure; power distribution and roads with traffic lights for example, dynamically adjusted to respond to differing circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/09/07/smart_cities_are_surveillance_cities/&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of smart city technology has also led to an increase in potential unwarranted [[Surveillance issues in smart cities#Privacy and autonomy|intrusions into privacy and restrictions upon autonomy]]. The widespread incorporation of information and communication technologies within the daily life of urban residents results in increases in the [[Surveillance issues in smart cities#Panopticism|surveillance capacity of states]] - to the extent that individuals may be unaware of what information is being accessed, when the access occurs and for what purpose. It is possible that such conditions could give rise to the [[Surveillance issues in smart cities#Police state|development of an electronic police state]]. Shanghai, Amsterdam, San Jose, Dubai, Barcelona, Madrid, Stockholm, and New York are all cities that use various techniques from smart city technology. 

===Electronic police state===

An electronic [[police state]] is a [[State (polity)|state]] in which the government aggressively uses electronic technologies to record, collect, store, organize, analyze, search, and distribute information about its citizens.&lt;ref&gt;The first use of the term "electronic police state" was likely in a posting by Jim Davis {{cite journal |date=11 August 1994 |url=http://cu-digest.org/CUDS6/cud6.72 |title=Police Checkpoints on the Information Highway |journal=Computer underground Digest |volume=6 |issue=72 |issn=1066-632X |quote=The so-called 'electronic frontier' is quickly turning into an electronic police state.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EPS-2008NationalRankings&gt;The term "electronic police state" became more widely known with the publication of [https://secure.cryptohippie.com/pubs/EPS-2008.pdf ''The Electronic Police State: 2008 National Rankings''], by Jonathan Logan, Cryptohippie USA.&lt;/ref&gt; Electronic police states also engage in mass government surveillance of [[landline]] and [[cellular phone|cellular]] telephone traffic, mail, email, web surfing, Internet searches, radio, and other forms of electronic communication as well as widespread use of video surveillance. The information is usually collected in secret.

The crucial elements are not politically based, so long as the government can afford the technology and the populace will permit it to be used, an electronic police state can form. The continual use of electronic mass surveillance can result in constant low-level fear within the population, which can lead to [[self-censorship]] and exerts a powerful coercive force upon the populace.&lt;ref name="Applications of Social Control Theory: Criminality and Governmentality"&gt;Kingsley Ufuoma OMOYIBO, Ogaga Ayemo OBARO (2012), [http://www.pdoaj.com/pdf-files/ijass,%20pp.1026-1032.pdf "Applications of Social Control Theory: Criminality and Governmentality"], ''International Journal of Asian Social Science'', Vol. 2, No. 7, pp.1026-1032.&lt;/ref&gt;

Seventeen factors for judging the development of an electronic police state were suggested in ''The Electronic Police State: 2008 National Rankings'':&lt;ref name=EPS-2008NationalRankings/&gt;
* '''Daily documents''': Requirement for the use and tracking of state-issued [[identity document]]s and registration.
* '''Border and travel control''': Inspections at borders, searching computers and cell phones, demanding decryption of data, and tracking travel within as well as to and from a country.
* '''Financial tracking''': A state's ability to record and search [[financial transaction]]s: checks, credit cards, wires, etc.
* '''Gag orders''': Restrictions on and criminal penalties for the disclosure of the existence of state surveillance programs.
* '''Anti-crypto laws''': Outlawing or restricting [[cryptography]] and/or privacy enhancing technologies.
* '''Lack of constitutional protections''': A lack of constitutional privacy protections or the routine overriding of such protections.
* '''Data storage''': The ability of the state to store the data gathered.
* '''Data search''': The ability to organize and search the data gathered.
* '''Data retention requirements''': Laws that require Internet and other service providers to save detailed records of their customers’ Internet usage for a minimum period of time.
** '''Telephone data retention requirements''': Laws that require telephone companies to record and save records of their customers’ telephone usage.
** '''Cell phone data retention requirements''': Laws that require cellular telephone companies to record and save records of their customers’ usage and location.
* '''Medical records''': Government access to the records of medical service providers.
* '''Enforcement''': The state's ability to use force to seize anyone they want, whenever they want.
* '''Lack of ''habeas corpus''''': Lack of a [[Habeas corpus|right for a person under arrest to be brought before a judge or into court]] in a timely fashion or the overriding of such rights.
* '''Lack of a police-intel barrier''': The lack of a barrier between police organizations and intelligence organizations, or the overriding of such barriers.
* '''Covert hacking''': State operatives collecting, removing, or adding digital evidence to/from private computers without permission or the knowledge of the computers' owners.
* '''Loose or no warrants''': Arrests or searches made without warrants or without careful examination and review of police statements and justifications by a truly independent judge or other third-party.

The list includes factors that apply to other forms of [[Police State|police states]], such as the use of identity documents and police enforcement, but go considerably beyond them and emphasize the use of technology to gather and process the information collected.

==In popular culture==
{{Main article|Mass surveillance in popular culture}}
The concept of being monitored by our government collects a large audience of curious citizens. Mass surveillance has been prominently featured in a wide array of books, films, and other media. Advances in technology over the last century have led to possible social control through the Internet and the conditions of late capitalism. Many directors and writers have been enthralled with the potential stories that could come from mass surveillance. Perhaps the most iconic example of fictional mass surveillance is [[George Orwell]]'s 1949 novel ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'', which depicts a [[dystopia]]n surveillance state. 

Here are a few other works that focus on mass surveillance:
* ''[[We (novel)|We]]'' , a 1920 novel by Russian author [[Yevgeny Zamyatin]] , that predates ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'' and was read by its author [[George Orwell]].
* ''[[Little Brother (Doctorow novel)|Little Brother]]'' is a novel by [[Cory Doctorow]], and is set in San Francisco after a major terrorist attack. The DHS uses technologies such as RFIDs and surveillance cameras to create a totalitarian system of control.
* ''[[The Lives of Others]]'', is a 2006 German drama film, which movingly conveys the impact that relentless surveillance has on the emotional well-being and the outcome of individuals subjected to it.
* ''[[The Hunger Games]]'' by [[Suzanne Collins]] is a trilogy in which ‘the capital’ has totalitarian surveillance &amp; control over all aspects of the other ‘districts’.
* ''[[Digital Fortress]]'', novel by [[Dan Brown]], involving an NSA code breaking machine called 'TRANSLTR'. The machine read and decrypted email messages, with which the NSA used to foil terrorist attacks and mass murders.

In the law of [[real property]], the '''merger doctrine''' stands for the proposition that the [[contract]] for the conveyance of property merges into the [[deed]] of conveyance; therefore, any guarantees made in the contract that are not reflected in the deed are extinguished when the deed is conveyed to the buyer of the property.

The merger doctrine traditionally applies only to covenants of title; covenants relating to the physical condition of the property (say, a promise that the furnace is in good working order) will not merge, and will not extinguish. The parties may by contract abrogate the doctrine and provide that some or all terms of the contract survive the closing and delivery of the deed.{{citation needed|date = January 2015}}

Merger also refers to the doctrine whereby "a [[fee simple]] estate, once fragmented into present and future interests, can thereafter be reconstituted. 'Merger is the absorption of a lesser estate by a greater estate, and takes place when two distinct estates of greater and lesser rank meet in the same person or class of persons at the same time without any intermediate estate.'
"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chase|first1=Edward, &amp; Julia Forrester|title=Property Law|date=2010|publisher=LexisNexis|isbn=978-08205-7094-5|pages=262–63|edition=2d}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, a merger doctrine extinguishes an easement by necessity to a landlocked piece of property once that property is sold to one of the adjoining owners, thus extinguishing the necessity. The lack of any property interest removes the necessity and the easement.

{{nihongo|'''Motoori Norinaga'''|本居 宣長||extra=21 June 1730&amp;nbsp;– 5 November 1801}} was a [[Japanese people|Japanese]] scholar of ''[[Kokugaku]]'' active during the [[Edo period]]. He is probably the best known and most prominent of all scholars in this tradition.{{Citation needed|reason=According to whom?|date=October 2018}}

==Life==
[[File:Motoori Norinaga.jpg|thumb|260px|left|Motoori Norinaga(1790)]]
Norinaga was born in what is now [[Matsusaka, Mie|Matsusaka]] in [[Ise Province]] (now part of [[Mie Prefecture]]) as the second son of an Otsu merchant house (the film director [[Yasujirō Ozu]] was a descendant of the same line). After his elder brother’s death, Norinaga succeeded to the Ozu line. At one stage he was adopted out to a paper-making family but the bookish boy was not suited to business.

It was at his mother's suggestion that, at the age of 22, Norinaga went to [[Kyoto]] to study medicine. In Kyoto, he also studied Chinese and Japanese [[philology]] under the [[Neo-Confucianism|neo-Confucianist]] Hori Keizan. It was at this time that Norinaga became interested in the Japanese classics and decided to enter the field of [[Kokugaku]] under the influence of [[Ogyū Sorai]] and [[Keichū]]. (With changes in the language, the ancient classics were already poorly understood by Japanese in the Edo period and texts needed philological analysis in order to be properly understood.) Life in Kyoto also instilled in the young Norinaga a love of traditional Japanese court culture.

Returning to Matsusaka, Norinaga opened a medical practice for infants while devoting his spare time to lectures on ''[[The Tale of Genji]]'' and studies of the ''[[Nihon Shoki]]'' (''Chronicles of Japan''). At the age of 27, he bought several books by [[Kamo no Mabuchi]] and embarked on his Kokugaku researches. As a doctor, he adopted the name of one of his samurai ancestors, Motoori.

In 1763, Norinaga met Mabuchi in person when the latter visited Matsusaka, a meeting that has come down in history as ‘the night in Matsusaka’. Norinaga took the occasion to ask Mabuchi to supervise his annotations of the ''[[Kojiki]]'' ("Records of Ancient Matters"). Mabuchi suggested that Norinaga should first tackle the annotations to the ''[[Man'yōshū]]'' in order to accustom himself to the ancient [[kana]] usage known as the [[man'yōgana]]. This was the only meeting between the two men, but they continued to correspond and, with Mabuchi’s encouragement, Norinaga later went on to full-fledged research into the ''Kojiki''.

Norinaga’s disciples included Ishizuka Tatsumaro, Nagase Masaki, Natsume Mikamaro, Takahashi Mikiakira and Motoori Haruniwa (Norinaga’s son).

Although overshadowed by his activities as a ''Kokugaku'' scholar, Norinaga spent 40 years as a practicing doctor in Matsusaka and was seeing patients until 10 days before his death in 1801.

==Works==
Norinaga’s most important works include the ''[[Kojiki-den]]'' (''Commentaries on the Kojiki''), made over a period of around 35 years, and his annotations on the ''Tale of Genji''. Using the methods of ''Kokugaku'' and [[Kaozheng]], Norinaga claimed that the ''Kojiki'' was the oldest surviving Japanese text. He used the supposed antiquity of the ''Kojiki'' to develop an idea of indigenous Japanese religion, laws, and religion which were later used in the development of an idea of [[State Shinto]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Josephson|first=Jason Ānanda |title="The Invention of Religion in Japan"|date=2012|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago|page=110|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Invention_of_Religion_in_Japan.html?id=gxzuzIszO60C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Norinaga took the view that the heritage of ancient Japan was one of natural spontaneity in feelings and spirit, and that imported Confucianism ran counter to such natural feelings. He criticized Ogyū Sorai for his over-valuing of Chinese civilization and thought, although it has been pointed out that his philological methodology was heavily influenced by Sorai's.  His ideas were influenced by the Chinese intellectual [[Wang Yangming]] (Ō Yōmei in Japanese), who had argued for ''innate knowing'', that mankind had a naturally intuitive (as opposed to rational) ability to distinguish good and evil.

Hitherto scholars of ancient literature had shown a preference for the grandness and masculinity of ''Man'yōshū'' poetry and an aversion to works like the ''Tale of Genji'', which were regarded as unmanly and feminine. Norinaga resurrected the position of the ''Tale of Genji'', which he regarded as an expression of ''[[mono no aware]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=Zk4EucRlvSwC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR9&amp;dq=motoori+norinaga&amp;ots=BotnpT4T35&amp;sig=iDQH2R7dZb6wwIRmZjuK4Xc_yh8#v=onepage&amp;q=motoori%20norinaga&amp;f=false|title=The Poetics of Motoori Norinaga: A Hermeneutical Journey|last=Motoori|first=Norinaga|date=2007-01-01|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=9780824830786|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;'','' a particular Japanese sensibility of "sorrow at evanescence" that Norinaga claimed forms the essence of Japanese literature.

In undertaking his textual analysis of ancient Japanese, Norinaga also made vital contributions to establishing a native Japanese grammatical tradition, in particular the analysis of [[clitic]]s, [[Japanese particles|particles]] and auxiliary verbs.

==Motoori Norinaga Commemorative Museum==
[[File:Suzunoya Gaikan.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Motoori Norinaga's home, preserved as a museum]]
Within the grounds of [[Matsusaka Castle]] in the city of Matsusaka, the house {{nihongo|Motoori Norinaga kyu-taku|本居宣長旧宅|}} where Motoori Norinaga lived from age 12 to age 72 is preserved as a memorial museum {{nihongo|Motoori Norinaga Commemoraive Museum|本居宣長記念館|Motoori Norinaga kinenkan}}. The building, which was originally built as a retirement home for Norinaga’s grandfather in 1693, was moved to its present location in 1909. It was proclaimed a [[Monuments of Japan|Special National Monument]] by the Japanese government in 1953. An effort has been made to preserve the interior as closely as possible to the time when it was used by Norinaga, and his writing studio on the second floor contains some examples of original manuscripts. The museum houses many artifacts that are protected as [[Important Cultural Properties of Japan]], of which only a small portion is on display at any time.

'''Nibbāna-The Mind Stilled''' is the translation of a series of 33 sermons titled '''Nivane Niveema''' ([[Sinhalese language|Sinhala]]: නිවනේ නිවීම), delivered in Sinhala by Venerable Bhikkhu [[Katukurunde Nanananda Thera|Katukurunde Ñāṇananda]] during the late 80's &amp; early 90's. The main focus of the sermons was on the psychological import of the term [[nibbana|''nibbāna'']] and the deeper philosophical implications underlying this much-vexed term. The first volume of the 7-volume series was published in 2003.&lt;ref name=NMS1&gt;{{cite book

== History ==
It was inspired by an invitation that came from his revered teacher, the late venerable [[Matara Sri Nanarama Mahathera|Matara Sri Ñāṇārāma Mahathera]], the chief incumbent of the [[Nissarana Vanaya|Nissarana Vanaya Hermitage in Meetirigala]] and an illustrious exponent of [[Insight Meditation]] in Sri Lanka. The sermons were delivered once every fortnight before the group of resident monks from '''August 1988 to January 1991'''. Thirty three sermons have been published in seven volumes.&lt;ref name="NMS1"/&gt;

Venerable Ñāṇananda had already written four books during the early phase of his monk’s life at [[Island Hermitage]], Dodanduwa. They were Concept and Reality in Early Buddhist Thought,&lt;ref name=CnR&gt;{{cite book

He came under the tutelage of the late venerable Matara Sri Ñāṇārama Mahathera, when he shifted to Nissarana Vanaya Hermitage in 1972. The meeting of these two eminent disciples of the Buddha in a teacher-pupil relationship for nearly two decades, led to an outstanding seminal contribution to the understanding of Dhamma in its correct perspective.&lt;ref name=NMSintro&gt;{{cite book

== What’s inside? ==
[[Nirvana|Nibbāna]] - the Bliss Supreme([[Dhammapada]] 203) is the goal of the spiritual endeavour in Buddhism. It has been variously understood and interpreted by scholars both ancient and modern.&lt;ref name=NMSext&gt;{{cite book
|last=Nanananda
|title=Nibbana - The Mind Stilled (Vol.1)
|year=2003
|pages=13}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Bhikkhu Ñāṇananda has followed a line of interpretation which highlights the psychological import of the term ''nibbāna'' drawing out at the same time the deeper philosophical implications underlying this much-vexed term. The original meaning and significance of the term ''nibbāna'' has been examined in the light of the evidence from the discourses of the [[Pali canon]]. The thoroughgoing analysis has entailed a reappraisal of some of the most controversial discourses on ''nibbāna''.

In his analysis he has ventured to re-interpret the discourses dealing with the law of Dependent arising (''[[Pratītyasamutpāda|paṭiccasmuppāda]]'') and the [[Middle Way|Middle Path]]. He has taken the opportunity to expatiate on the topics he has dealt in brief in his 'Concept and Reality' and 'Magic of the Mind'. His novel interpretation of the Law of Dependent arising in terms of a Vortex finds fuller expression here.&lt;ref name=vatta&gt;{{cite book
|last=Nanananda|year=2003

|last=Nanananda|year=2007
|title=Nibbana - The Mind Stilled (Vol.5)
|pages=445ff}}&lt;/ref&gt;  So also the via media he has suggested in pointing to the '''‘Relative validity and Pragmatic value of concepts’'''.&lt;ref name=Rv&gt;{{cite book
|last=Nanananda

This middle path approach reasserts the ethical foundation of Early Buddhism and reaffirms the prospect of inward peace ‘here-and-now’. The penetrative analysis of the role of language and logic has in it much that is revealing and refreshing to the semantic philosopher.

The sermons are currently being studied in the context of early Buddhist thought in a free-of-charge three-year [https://www.buddhismuskunde.uni-hamburg.de/en/projekte/elearning.html e-learning program] (2017-2018) offered by Bhikkhu Anālayo of the Numata Center for Buddhist Studies at the University of Hamburg in cooperation with the [https://analayo2018.buddhistinquiry.org/ Barre Center for Buddhist Studies] (Mass.).

== Free Distribution of Dhamma ==
The venerable author of this series has also effected a significant change in the methods adopted to reach the seekers of Dhamma. Drawing inspiration from the dictum '''"The Gift of Dhamma excels all other gifts"'''(Dhammapada 354) he has specified that all publications should be distributed free as ‘gifts of Dhamma’. The Free Distribution of Dhamma (''dhammadāna''-ideal)  has been upheld by the Buddha in the following exhortation to the monks:

:{| style="border:darkgray solid 2px;background-color:#E5E5E5;padding: 0px 2px 2px 2px;"
|&lt;blockquote&gt;
:“Monks, there are these two kinds of gifts: the gift of material things and the gift of Dhamma. Of these two gifts, monks, this is supreme (namely): the gift of Dhamma.”

:“Monks, there are these two kinds of distribution: the distribution of material things and the distribution of Dhamma. Of these two kinds of distribution, monks, this is supreme (namely): the distribution of Dhamma.”

&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;(Itivuttaka 3.5.9)

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
|}

A group of lay enthusiasts initiated a [[Buddhism|Dhamma]] Publications Trust (Sinhala: ''Dharma Grantha Mudrana Bhaaraya'' - D.G.M.B.) to bring out the sermons in book form providing an opportunity to the Buddhist public to contribute towards the publication.&lt;ref name="NMSintro"/&gt; A few years later an affiliated Trust (Sinhala: ''Dharma Shravana Maadhya Bhaaraya'' - D.S.M.B.) was set up to make the sermons available in audio form-again as a free gift to the Buddhist public.&lt;ref name=dsmb&gt;{{cite web

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

This benevolent movement has a spiritual dimension in reaffirming the age-old Buddhist values attached to ''dhammadāna'', fast eroding before the hungry waves of commercialization. It has proved its worth by creating a healthy cultural atmosphere in which the readers and listeners shared the 'Dhamma-gift' with others, thus moulding the links of salutary friendship (''[[Kalyāṇa-mittatā|kalyāna-mittatā]]'') indispensable for the continuity of Buddhism.

As the Venerable author emphasizes, Dhamma deserves no ‘price-tag’ precisely because it is ‘price-less’.  Is everything that comes '''free''' to us, necessarily worthless? What about the air and the sunshine?

Many a parched traveller on the desert path has had a refreshing drink of the nectar of Dhamma free of charge ever since. Many an enthusiastic benevolent heart seized the opportunity to participate in a genuine act of ''dhammadāna''.&lt;ref name="NMSintro"/&gt;

It is in point of merit that the "gift of Dhamma excels all other gifts". Dhamma is the nectar that quenches the insatiate samsaric (pali:''[[Saṃsāra (Buddhism)|saṃsāra]]'': Cycle of rebirth) thirst of beings. The gift of Dhamma is therefore of far greater merit than an ordinary gift of food or drink.(AN 9,5)
For those who are magnanimous- Dhammadāna is forever an unfailing source of altruistic joy.&lt;ref name="NMSintro"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6585">The '''Prussian scheme''' is the name of a reported 1786 attempt by [[Nathaniel Gorham]], acting in possible concert with other persons influential in the government of the [[United States]], to establish a monarchy in the U.S. under the rule of [[Prince Henry of Prussia (1726–1802)|Henry of Prussia]], a prince of the [[House of Hohenzollern]], possibly to resolve the ongoing political crises occurring during the last days of the [[Articles of Confederation]]. The attempt may have died due to a lack of interest on Henry's part, popular opposition to a rumored proposal involving a different potential monarch, the convening of the [[Philadelphia Convention]], or some combination thereof.

__TOC__

==Background==

===Post-revolutionary monarchist tendencies===
[[File:HeinrichvonPreussenTischbein1769.jpg|thumb|Prince Henry of Prussia was reportedly offered the hypothetical throne of the United States.]]
The protracted disturbances created by the shortcomings of the Articles of Confederation as the United States' constitution, which culminated in [[Shays' Rebellion]], reportedly gave rise to a "class of men in the community who gave very serious apprehensions to the advocates for a Republican form of government".&lt;ref name="phd"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dunbar|first1=Louise|title=A study of "monarchical" tendencies in the United States, from 1776 to 1801|date=1923|publisher=University of Illinois|url=https://archive.org/details/studyofmonarchic00dunb}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to, and following, the May 1787 convening of the Philadelphia Convention, widely circulated rumors reported that the conclave was meeting for the purpose of offering to enthrone [[Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany]] as king of the United States.&lt;ref name="vile"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vile|first1=John|title=The Constitutional Convention of 1787: A Comprehensive Encyclopedia of America's Founding|date=2005|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=1851096698|page=490}}&lt;/ref&gt; So acute were the rumors that the convention issued a public denial that any proposal for a reestablishment of monarchy was being considered, the denial later being repeated in a letter sent by [[Alexander Martin]] to the governor of [[North Carolina]].&lt;ref name="vile"/&gt;

===American attitudes toward Prussia===
American public opinion at the time generally regarded [[Prussia]] warmly.&lt;ref name="prussia"/&gt; Prince Henry's older brother, [[Frederick the Great]], harbored an "immense hatred" toward Britain for having abandoned Prussia near the end of the Seven Years' War.&lt;ref name="prussia"/&gt; During the American Revolution, he had closed Prussian territory to passage by the army of the [[Principality of Anhalt-Zerbst]], a British ally. This required military forces from the landlocked nation to make a circuitous journey to reach a seaport for deployment to North America, during which nearly half of Anhalt-Zerbst troops deserted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lowell|first1=Edward|title=The Hessians and the Other German Auxiliaries of Great Britain in the Revolutionary War|date=1884|publisher=Harper &amp; Bros.|page=52|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2VkSAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar restrictions were placed on troops from other British allies attempting to transit to North America, including the [[Principality of Bayreuth]], the [[Principality of Ansbach|Margraviate of Ansbach]], and the [[Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel]].&lt;ref name="prussia"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Haworth|first1=Paul|title=Frederick the Great and the American Revolution|journal=The American Historical Review|date=April 1904|volume=9|issue=3|pages=460–478|jstor=1833470|doi=10.1086/ahr/9.3.460}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposal==
[[File:Major_General_Friedrich_Wilhelm_Augustus_Baron_von_Steuben_by_Ralph_Earl.jpeg|thumb|left|In the early 20th century a letter was discovered from Henry of Prussia to the Prussian-American general Baron Von Steuben (pictured) seemingly confirming the veracity of the "Prussian scheme" story.]]

===Early allegations===
According to [[Rufus King]], at about the same time the rumors pertaining to Prince Frederick were circulating, [[Nathaniel Gorham]] secretly corresponded to Prince Henry of Prussia offering to create him as monarch of the United States.&lt;ref name="krauel"/&gt; The popular version of the story has Henry declining on account of the fact he did not believe the American public would be likely to submit to a king.&lt;ref name="krauel"/&gt; Later referred to as "the Prussian scheme", Rufus King's report of Gorham's offer was long considered apocryphal, though [[James Monroe]] later confided to [[Andrew Jackson]] that he was aware some members of what would become the [[Federalist Party]] had, nearly two decades before, "entertained principles unfriendly to our system of government".&lt;ref name="phd"/&gt;

===Possible confirmation===
In the early 20th century an unsent letter was discovered in the Prussian archives from Henry, addressed to [[Baron Von Steuben]] who was, at the time the letter was written, living in retirement in [[New York City]].&lt;ref name="krauel"/&gt; The letter, believed dated several months before the [[Philadelphia convention]], refers to an offer the prince had received substantially similar to that detailed in the original story.&lt;ref name="krauel"/&gt; In it, Henry reports he is not interested in an American crown but recommends, instead, that an unnamed French candidate be considered for the position.&lt;ref name="krauel"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Krauel|first1=Richard|title=Prince Henry of Prussia and the Regency of the United States, 1786|journal=The American Historical Review|date=October 1911|volume=17|issue=1|jstor=1832837|pages=44–51|doi=10.1086/ahr/17.1.44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==
Some have attributed the [[natural-born-citizen clause]] in the [[U.S. constitution]] as an attempt by the Philadelphia Convention to end the persistence of rumors of European royalty being invited to assume a hypothetical United States throne.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nelson|first1=Michael|title=Guide to the Presidency and the Executive Branch|date=2012|publisher=CQ Press|isbn=1452234280|page=38|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4iNzAwAAQBAJ&amp;dq}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical backdrop ==
{{see also|History of birth control}}

As birth-control methods advanced during the late 19th and early 20th centuries, many [[Christian right|conservative Christian]] movements issued official statements against their use, citing their incompatibility with biblical beliefs and ideals.

In addition, there are those who contend that Quiverfull's "internal growth" model is a manifestation of a broader trend reflected in such groups as [[ultra-Orthodox Jews]], Orthodox [[Calvinism|Calvinists]] of the [[Netherlands]] and [[Laestadianism|Laestadian Lutherans of Finland]].&lt;ref&gt;
Kaufmann, Eric. 2011. [https://www.amazon.com/Shall-Religious-Inherit-Earth-Twenty-First/dp/1846681448/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1324053524&amp;sr=1-1 Shall the Religious Inherit the Earth: Demography and Politics in the Twenty-First Century]. London: Profile Books.
&lt;/ref&gt;  The former may also be a case of a manifestation of a movement of opinion within some ethnic, linguistic, religious, regional, or other identifiable groups who have felt concern about their continued existence for historical or other reasons.  Such philosophies and groups are diverse amongst themselves—being found in all segments and sectors of the political spectrum—and usually represent, to varying extents, the diversity within their group. The manifestations of such movements and opinion are everything from comparatively high rates of in-group marriage being applauded and gently suggested to more explicit calls for [[endogamy]] such as is the case with the Druze&lt;ref&gt;[[Druze]]&lt;/ref&gt; to concerns expressed by Northern Ireland Protestants about a higher birth rate amongst Catholics to [[Decree 770]] by Nicolae Ceaușescu's government in Romania concerning contraception and other population topics as part of the local variant of North Korean [[Juche]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Decree 770]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nicolae_Ceaușescu&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Anglican allowance of birth control ===
In 1930 the [[Lambeth Conference]] issued a statement permitting birth control: "Where there is a clearly felt moral obligation to limit or avoid parenthood, complete abstinence is the primary and obvious method", but if there was morally sound reasoning for avoiding abstinence, "the Conference agrees that other methods may be used, provided that this is done in the light of Christian principles". [http://anglicanhistory.org/misc/contraception/ Primary materials] on the contemporary debate indicate a wide variety of opinion on the matter.  In the decades that followed, birth control became gradually accepted among Protestants, even among the most conservative evangelicals.&lt;ref name="flann"&gt;{{cite journal | author= Campbell, Flann| title= Birth Control and the Christian Churches| journal= Population Studies| date= Nov 1960| volume= 14| issue= 2| pages= 131–147| doi= 10.2307/2172010| jstor= 2172010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="allen"&gt;{{cite journal | author= Allen, James E.| title= Family Planning Attitudes of Seminary Students| journal= Review of Religious Research| year= 1976| volume= 9| issue= 1| pages= 52–55| doi= 10.2307/3509598| jstor= 3509598}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="affiliation"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Goldschneider,  Calvin |author2=William D.

=== Early Quiverfull authors ===
[[File:Mary pride thewayhome.jpg|thumb|upright|Mary Pride's first book, ''The Way Home: Beyond Feminism Back to Reality'' (1985), is credited{{by whom?|date=June 2018}} as helping to spearhead the Quiverfull movement.]]
[[File:Fullquiverofarrows.jpg|thumb|upright| The Christian Quiverfull movement derives its name from [[Psalms|Psalm]] 127:3–5, where many children are metaphorically referred to as the arrows in a full quiver.]]
{{Main|Mary Pride}}
{{See also|Feminism|Anti-feminism|Birth control}}

Mr Quiverfull, a junior but notably fecund clergyman, appears as a minor fictional character in [[Anthony Trollope]]'s [[Chronicles of Barsetshire | Barsetshire chronicles]] (published between 1855 and 1867).

In the 20th century, Quiverfull as a modern [[Christian movements|Christian movement]] began to emerge.&lt;ref name="explaindiffs"&gt;{{cite journal | author= Marcum, John P.| title= Explaining Fertility Differences among U.S. Protestants| journal= Social Forces| year= 1981 | volume = 60| issue= 2| pages = 532–43| doi = 10.2307/2578449| jstor= 2578449}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{qn|date=June 2018}} While a newsletter by [[Nancy Campbell]] espoused Quiverfull ideas early,{{when?|date=June 2018}} and Campbell is in measure responsible for formulating them,{{cn|date=June 2018}} the movement sparked most fully after the 1985 [[publication]] of [[Mary Pride |Mary Pride’s]] book ''The Way Home: Beyond Feminism, Back to Reality.''

In her book, Pride chronicled her metaphorical journey away from what she labeled [[feminist]] and [[Antinatalism | anti-natal]] ideas of [[happiness]] (within which she had lived as an [[activist]] before her [[Christian conversion|conversion]] to [[Christian right| conservative]] [[Evangelicalism |evangelical Christianity]] in 1977) toward her discovery of happiness surrounding what she portrayed as the biblically-mandated role of wives and mothers as bearers of children and workers in the home under the [[Traditional authority|authority]] of a [[husband]]. Pride wrote that such a lifestyle was generally biblically required{{by whom?|date=June 2018}} of all married Christian women but that feminism had duped most Christian women without their awareness, especially in their acceptance of birth control.&lt;ref name= "consvprots" /&gt;&lt;ref name = "pride"&gt;
{{cite book

 | last= Pride| first= Mary| year= 1985
 | publisher= Good News Publishers
 | location= Wheaton, IL| isbn= 0-89107-345-0
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

As the basis for her arguments, Pride selected numerous [[Bible verses]] to lay out what she saw as the [[Women in Christianity | biblical role of women]].  These included verses she interpreted as perpetuating her ideas of compulsory childbearing and the non-use of [[birth control]], opposed (she argued) by what she called "the feminist agenda" by which she had formerly lived.  Pride's explanations then became a spearheading basis of Quiverfull.

The name of the Quiverfull movement comes from the [[Old Testament]] Bible verses in {{Bibleverse|Psalm|127:3–5|KJV}} that Pride cited in ''The Way Home''.&lt;ref name="pride"/&gt;

&lt;poem style="margin-left: 1em;"&gt;Lo, children are an heritage of the {{LORD}}:
and the fruit of the womb is his reward.
As arrows are in the hand of a mighty man;
so are children of the youth.
Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them:
they shall not be ashamed,
but they shall speak with the enemies in the gate. [[King James Version|KJV]]&lt;/poem&gt;

Pride stated in her book: "The church’s sin which has caused us to become unsavory salt incapable of uplifting the society around us is selfishness, lack of love, refusing to consider children an unmitigated blessing. In a word, [[family planning]]."&lt;ref name="pride"/&gt;

===Consolidation and growth of the movement===
After the publication of Pride’s ''The Way Home'', various church women and others took up her book and ideas and spread them through informal [[social network]]s. Around this time, numerous church [[pastor]]s issued [[sermon]]s in accord with Pride's ideas and various small publications and a few Quiverfull-oriented books emerged.

As the [[Internet]] expanded several years later, the informal networks gradually took on more organized forms as Quiverfull adherents developed numerous Quiverfull-oriented organizations, books, [[electronic mailing lists]], [[websites]], and digests, most notably ''The Quiverfull Digest''. The largely decentralized "Quiverfull" movement resulted.&lt;ref name="joyce"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nightline2"&gt;{{cite book | title=The More the Holier?| date=January 3, 2006| publisher=ABC News Nightline}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From their onset, Quiverfull ideas have sometimes had a polarizing effect between Christians who hold to the position and those who are skeptical of or disagree with them.&lt;ref name="consvprots"/&gt;&lt;ref name="protsandfp"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Goodman, Patricia| title=Protestants and Family Planning| journal=Journal of Religion and Health| year=1997| volume=36| issue= 4| url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/gg08414n38g4x820/fulltext.pdf| pages=353–366| doi=10.1023/A:1027437310363|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Motivations ==

=== Obedience to God ===
Quiverfull authors and adherents express their core motivation as a desire to obey God's commandments as stated in the Bible. Among these commandments, "[[Cultural mandate|be fruitful and multiply]]",{{bibleref2c|Gen|1:22;8:17;9:1}} "behold, children are a gift of the Lord"),{{bibleref2c|Psalm|127:3}} and passages showing God acting to open and close the womb{{bibleref2c|Gen|20:18;29:31;30:22}}{{bibleref2c|1Sam|1:5-6}}{{bibleref2c|Isaiah|66:9}} are interpreted as giving basis for their view. Quiverfull adherents typically maintain that their philosophy is first about an open, accepting and obedient attitude toward the possibility of bearing children. Within the view, this attitude may result in many, few or even no children, because God Himself maintains sole provenance over conception and birth. The duty of the Quiverfull adherent is only to maintain an "open willingness" to joyfully receive and not thwart however many children God chooses to bestow. Contraception in all its forms is seen as inconsistent with this attitude and is thus entirely avoided, as is [[abortion]].

=== Missionary effort ===
Quiverfull's principal authors and its adherents also describe their motivation as a [[missionaries|missionary effort]] to raise up many children as Christians to advance the cause of the Christian religion.&lt;ref name="hess"/&gt; Its distinguishing viewpoint is to eagerly receive children as blessings from God,&lt;ref name="hess"/&gt;&lt;ref name="campN"/&gt; eschewing all forms of [[contraception]], including [[natural family planning]] and [[Human sterilization (surgical procedure)|sterilization]].&lt;ref name="joyce"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pride"/&gt;

=== Population and demography ===
According to journalist Kathryn Joyce, writing in the magazine ''[[The Nation]]'': "[T]he Quiverfull mission is rooted in faith, the unseen, its mandate to be fruitful and multiply," even if it "has tangible results as well."&lt;ref name="joyce"/&gt; Although Joyce claims that "Population is a preoccupation for many Quiverfull believers... [and] [t]he motivations aren't always [[Racism|racist]], but the subtext of 'race suicide' is often there."&lt;ref name="joyce"/&gt; Still, she asserts, "This is what Quiverfull is about: faith, pure and simple."&lt;ref name="joyce"/&gt; Others remark that Quiverfull resembles other world-denying fundamentalist movements that grow through internal reproduction and membership retention such as ultra-Orthodox Jews, [[Amish]], and [[Laestadianism|Laestadian Lutherans]] in Finland. Many are thriving as seculars and moderates have transitioned to below-replacement fertility.&lt;ref&gt;Kaufmann, Eric. 2011. [https://www.amazon.com/Shall-Religious-Inherit-Earth-Twenty-First/dp/1846681448/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1324053524&amp;sr=1-1 Shall the Religious Inherit the Earth: Demography and Politics in the Twenty-First Century]. London: Profile Books. Also see [http://www.sneps.net www.sneps.net]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Toft, Monica Duffy. 2011.

J. A. Goldstone, E. Kaufmann and M. Toft. Boulder, CO: Paradigm Press]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Beliefs ==
[[File:Fullquiver.jpg|thumb|120px|left|The cover of the 1990 ''A Full Quiver: Family Planning and the Lordship of Christ'' by Rick and Jan Hess.]]

The principal Quiverfull belief is that Christians should maintain a strongly welcoming attitude toward the possibility of bearing children. With minor exceptions, adherents reject birth control use as completely incompatible with this belief.

===Majority doctrine===
Most Quiverfull adherents regard children as unqualified blessings, gifts that should be received happily from God. Quiverfull authors Rick and Jan Hess argued for this belief in their 1990 book: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Behold, children are a gift of the Lord." (Psa. 127:3) Do we really believe that? If children are a gift from God, let’s for the sake of argument ask ourselves what other gift or blessing from God we would reject. Money? Would we reject great wealth if God gave it? Not likely! How about good health? Many would say that a man’s health is his most treasured possession. But children? Even children given by God? "That’s different!" some will plead! All right, is it different? God states right here in no-nonsense language that children are gifts. Do we believe His Word to be true?"&lt;ref name="hess"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Quiverfull authors such as Pride, Provan, and Hess extend this idea to mean that if one child is a blessing, then each additional child is likewise a blessing and not something to be viewed as economically burdensome or unaffordable. When a couple seeks to control family size via birth control they are thus "rejecting God's blessings" he might otherwise give and possibly breaking his commandment to "be fruitful and multiply".&lt;ref name="hess"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pride"/&gt;&lt;ref name="provan"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Bible and Birth Control| last=Provan| first=Charles D.| year=1989| publisher=Zimmer Printing| location=Monongahela, PA| isbn=99917-998-3-4}}. Quote and its chapter available at http://www.jesus-passion.com/contraception.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bythedozen"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Robben, Donetta| title=Blessings by the Dozen| journal=American Life League Magazine| year=2006| volume=Sept.-Oct.| url=http://www.clmagazine.org/backissues/2006septoct_10-13blessingsbythedozen.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Charles D. Provan - The Bible and Birth Control.jpg|120px|thumb|[[Charles D. Provan]]'s 1989 ''The Bible and Birth Control'' is credited as strengthening the theological justification for the Quiverfull movement.]]
Accordingly, Quiverfull theology opposes the general acceptance among Protestant Christians of deliberately limiting family size or spacing children through birth control. For example, Mary Pride argued, "God commanded that sex be at least potentially fruitful (that is, not deliberately unfruitful).... All forms of sex that shy away from marital fruitfulness are perverted."&lt;ref name="pride"/&gt; Adherents believe that God himself controls via [[Divine Providence|Providence]] how many and how often children are conceived and born, pointing to Bible verses that describe God acting to "open and close the womb" (see [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2020:18;&amp;version=49; Genesis 20:18], [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2029:31;&amp;version=49; 29:31], [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis%2030:22;&amp;version=49; 30:22]; [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Samuel%201:5-6;&amp;version=49; 1 Samuel 1:5-6]; [http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Isaiah%2066:9;&amp;version=49; Isaiah 66:9]).&lt;ref name="hess"/&gt;&lt;ref name="scott"&gt;{{cite book | title=Birthing God's Mighty Warriors| last=Scott| first=Rachel| year=2004| publisher=Xulon Press| location=Longwood, FL| isbn = 1-59467-465-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hess and Hess state that couples "just need to trust God to provide them with the perfect number of children for their situation."&lt;ref name="hess"/&gt;

Some Quiverfull adherents base their rejection of birth control upon the belief that the [[Book of Genesis|Genesis creation]] and post-[[Noah|Noahic flood]] Bible passages to "be fruitful and multiply" (see [http://bible.cc/genesis/1-22.htm Genesis 1:22]; [http://bible.cc/genesis/9-7.htm 9:7]) are un-rescinded biblical commandments. For example, [[Charles D. Provan]] argues:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Be fruitful and multiply" ... is a command of God, and indeed was the first command to a married couple. And since birth control obviously involves disobedience to this divine command, birth control is seen as an attempt to prevent being fruitful and multiplying. As such, birth control is wrong, because it involves willful disobedience to the Word of God. Since nowhere is this command done away with in the entire Bible; it still remains valid for us today.&lt;ref name="provan"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Quiverfull advocates such as Hess and Hess, and [[Rachel Giove Scott]], believe that the [[Devil in Christianity|Devil]] deceives Christian couples into using birth control so that children God otherwise willed to create are prevented from being born.&lt;ref name="hess"/&gt;&lt;ref name="scott"/&gt; In addition, a Quiverfull adherent was quoted in the 1991 ''[[Calgary Herald]]'' as making this statement: "Children are made in God's image, and the enemy hates that image, so the more of them he can prevent from being born, the more he likes it."&lt;ref name="QF-Canda"/&gt;

====Infertility====
Adherents view [[barrenness]], referred to as an "empty quiver", as something to be accepted from God as His choice, which then becomes a matter of prayer in the hope that God may decide to miraculously intervene.  Quiverfull also sees [[infertility| infertility treatments]] as a usurpation of God's [[Divine Providence|providence]] and accordingly reject them.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.raisingarrows.net/2008/05/enjoying-your-quiverfull/&lt;/ref&gt; Adoption is viewed as a positive option on which couples can also rely on God's providence to send children. Biblical references to God's love for the orphan and the belief that people are saved through adoption into God's family are often noted.

Some circles do accept medical interventions, since improving opportunities for pregnancy is not seen to guarantee it any more than with any healthy couple.  Also, some reproductive health problems may be seen as symptomatic of other health problems which need to be addressed generally.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}

===Minority doctrine===
Not all Quiverfull families and authors would agree with each statement made by the movement's principal authors.

Samuel Owens considers that some aspects of a fallen universe may possibly sometimes justify an option to use a [[Beginning of pregnancy controversy|non&amp;ndash;potentially abortive birth control method]]. Example situations include serious illnesses, inevitable Caesarian sections, and other problematic situations, such as disabling mental instability and serious marital disharmony. Owens additionally argues that birth control may be permissible for married couples called to a "higher moral purpose" than having children, such as caring long-term for many [[orphan]]s or serving as career [[missionary|missionaries]] in a dangerous location.&lt;ref name="Owen"&gt;{{cite book | title=Letting God Plan Your Family| last=Owen, Jr.| first=Samuel A.| year=1990| publisher=Crossway Books| location=Wheaton, IL| isbn = 0-89107-585-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite some variances, all Quiverfull families and authors agree that God's normative ideal for happy, healthy and prosperous married couples is to take no voluntary actions to prevent having children.&lt;ref name="hess"/&gt;&lt;ref name="campN"/&gt;

== Practices ==

===Non-use of contraception===
:''Also see: [[Fertility]] and [[Infertility]], and [[Christian views on contraception#Protestant Christianity|Protestant views on contraception]]''
Quiverfull adherents maintain that God "opens and closes the womb" of a woman on a case-by-case basis, and that any attempts to regulate fertility are usurpation of divine power. Thus, the defining practice of a Quiverfull married couple is not to use any form of birth control and to maintain continual "openness to children", which is the possibility of [[Conception (biology)|conception]], during routine [[sexual intercourse]]. This practice is irrespective of the timing of the month during the menstrual cycle, and is considered by Quiverfull adherents to be the principal, if not the primary aspect of their Christian calling in submission to the Lordship of [[Christ]].&lt;ref name="joyce2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rhrealitycheck.org/blog/2006/11/30/quiverfull-more-children-for-gods-army|title=Quiverfull: More Children For God's Army|accessdate=2007-01-09|publisher=RH Reality Check|author=Kathryn Joyce}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Proponents of the Quiverfull movement also regard the pill and other similar contraceptives as unacceptable abortifacients.&lt;ref name="abortifacient_ref_1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quiverfull.com/birth_control/pill_abortifacient.html|title=QuiverFull Pill Fact Sheet|accessdate = 2013-05-17|publisher=Pharmacists For Life International|author=Patrick McCrystal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Quiverfull adherents advocate for [[child spacing]] through [[breastfeeding]], so that the return of fertility after childbirth could be delayed by [[lactational amenorrhea method|lactational amenorrhea]], however this is far from certain.

===Family organization, homeschooling, homesteading===
:''Also see: [[Dominionism]], and [[Patriarchy]]''

Quiverfull authors and adherents advocate for and seek to model [[Nativism (politics)|a return to]] [[Biblical Patriarchy]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} Mary Pride recently distanced herself from the patriarchy movement in an article for Practical Homeschooling. In her article, she clearly stated her disapproval of the movement, and sets the record straight that she should not be considered a founder of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.home-school.com/Articles/phs89-marypride.html |title=Homeschool World: Practical Homeschooling Articles: Patriarchy, Meet Matriarchy |publisher=Home-school.com |accessdate=2011-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Quiverfull authors typically organize family governance with the mother as a [[homemaker]] under the [[authority]] of her [[husband]] with the children under the authority of both. Parents seek to largely shelter their children from aspects of culture they as parents deem adversarial to their religious beliefs. Additionally, Quiverfull families strongly incline toward [[homeschooling]] and toward [[homesteading]] in a [[rural]] area. However, exceptions exist in substantial enough proportions that these latter two items are general and are often idealized correlations to Quiverfull practices and not integral parts of them.&lt;ref name="patri"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Biggar, R.J. |author2=M. Melbye |lastauthoramp=yes | title=Debating the Merits of Patriarchy: Discursive Disputes over Spousal Authority among Evangelicial Family Commentators| journal=Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion| year=1997| volume=36| pages=393–410|doi=10.2307/1387857 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sterilization reversals===
Quiverfull adherents Brad and Dawn Irons run ''Blessed Arrows Sterilization Reversal Ministry''. The couple advocates for Quiverfull ideas while providing funding, physician referrals, and support to Protestants wishing to undergo [[Human sterilization (surgical procedure)|sterilization]] reversal surgery.&lt;ref name="reverse"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blessedarrows.org/|title=Blessed Arrows: A Sterilization Reversal Ministry|accessdate = 2006-10-14|publisher=Brad and Dawn Irons|author=Brad and Dawn Irons}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Protestants such as [[Bill Gothard]] also advocate for reversals, saying that sterilized couples have "cut off children" and should devote themselves instead to "raising up godly seed".

==Criticisms==
[[James B. Jordan]] maintains that, while children are indeed blessings, they are only one among a wide range of blessings God offers, and prayerfully choosing foci among them is part of prudent Christian [[Stewardship (theology)|stewardship]].&lt;ref name="JBJ"&gt;{{cite journal | author=James B. Jordan| title=The Bible and Family Planning: An Answer to Charles Provan's "The Bible and Birth Control"| journal=Contra Mundum| year=1993| url=http://www.contra-mundum.org/cm/cm09.pdf | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081031084211/http://www.contra-mundum.org/cm/cm09.pdf |archivedate=2008-10-31| issn = 1070-9495| pages=2–14 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Piper (theologian)|John Piper]]'s ''Desiring God Ministries'' made some comments that relate to Quiverfull by saying that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"just because something is a gift from the Lord does not mean that it is wrong to be a steward of when or whether you will come into possession of it. It is wrong to reason that since ''A'' is good and a gift from the Lord, then we must pursue as much of ''A'' as possible. God has made this a world in which tradeoffs have to be made and we cannot do everything to the fullest extent. For kingdom purposes, it might be wise not to get married. And for kingdom purposes, it might be wise to regulate the size of one's family and to regulate when the new additions to the family will likely arrive. As Wayne Grudem has said, 'it is okay to place less emphasis on some good activities in order to focus on other good activities.'"&lt;ref name="piper"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.desiringgod.org/ResourceLibrary/QuestionsAndAnswers/ByTopic/45/1440_Does_the_Bible_permit_birth_control/|title=Does the Bible permit birth control?|accessdate=2006-10-27|publisher=Desiring God|year=2006|author=Desiring God Staff|work=Questions and Answers|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061026010215/http://www.desiringgod.org/ResourceLibrary/QuestionsAndAnswers/ByTopic/45/1440_Does_the_Bible_permit_birth_control/|archivedate=2006-10-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Quiverfull in U.S. national press==
While Quiverfull had previously garnered some attention in the Christian press,&lt;ref name="cbn"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ct"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2006/august/15.26.html|title=The Case for Kids|accessdate=2006-12-21|publisher=Christianity Today|date=1 August 2006|author=Leslie Leyland Fields}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Canadian press in March 2001,&lt;ref name="QF-Canda"/&gt; and in various scholarly pieces, it began to receive focused attention in the U.S. national press in 2004.

=== ''New York Times'' ===
In an article on December 7, 2004, ''[[New York Times]]'' journalist [[David Brooks (journalist)|David Brooks]] described a rising movement he called simply "[[natalism]]" and sought to show how in the future it could shift the U.S. political landscape from a philosophy of [[liberalism]] to [[conservatism]]. Brooks concluded, "Natalists are associated with [[Red states and blue states|red America]], but they're not launching a [[jihad]]".&lt;ref name="joyce"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes"/&gt;

=== ''Good Morning America'' ===
On July 25, 2005, ''[[Good Morning America]]'' aired a segment, "Is eight really enough?" about the Quiverfull movement. Deborah Roberts interviews Rachel Scott, author of "Birthing God's Mighty Warriors." Rachel Scott discusses the trend toward larger families, managing finances with more mouths to feed and she states, "when good people stop having kids, society fails."

=== ''Nightline'' ===
On January 3, 2006, ''[[Nightline (US news program)|Nightline]]'' aired a special segment, "The More the Holier?" on the Quiverfull movement.&lt;ref name="nightline"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Nightline/story?id=2767898&amp;page=1|title=When Having Kids is a Religious Experience - A Full Quiver: A Growing Movement for Growing Families for God|accessdate=2007-01-04|publisher=ABC News|date=January 3, 2007|author1=Ted Gerstein  |author2=John Berman |lastauthoramp=yes |work= Nightline |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091016071450/http://abcnews.go.com/Nightline/story?id=2767898|archivedate=2009-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The coverage was re-aired on ABC's ''[[World News Now]]'' about four hours later.  On September 15, 2007, ''[[Nightline (US news program)|Nightline]]'' revisited the issue as part of their "Faith Matters" series, again featuring the Carpenter family.

=== ''The Nation'' ===
Journalist [[Kathryn Joyce]] connected Brooks' "natalism" with Quiverfull and disagreed with him in her November 9, 2006, 5-page article on Quiverfull in ''[[The Nation]]''. Joyce emphasized that the movement uses what she described as "[[military-industrial]] terminology" to articulate the belief that "only a determination among Christian women to take up their submissive, motherly roles with a "military air" and within a milieu of becoming "maternal missionaries" will lead to what Joyce described as Quiverfull's "Christian army" achieving cultural "victory."&lt;ref name="joyce"/&gt;

=== ''Newsweek'' ===
On November 13, 2006, ''[[Newsweek]]'' provided a 2-page piece on Quiverfull, characterizing the movement as conservatives who are "reacting to revolutionary changes in women's social roles and seeking to re-impose a more traditional order." The piece ended by quoting a Quiverfull family describing themselves as "exponentially happier" after the wife relinquished control of her womb to God.&lt;ref name="newsweek"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15701301/site/newsweek/|title=Making Babies the Quiverfull Way|accessdate=2006-12-21|publisher=Newsweek Magazine|date=13 November 2006|author=Eileen Finan |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070103185954/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15701301/site/newsweek/ &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On March 17, 2009, ''Newsweek'' published a second piece on Quiverfull through their website.&lt;ref name="newsweek2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsweek.com/2009/03/16/extreme-motherhood.html|title=Extreme Motherhood:Inside the Duggar Family's Conservative Ideology|accessdate=16 February 2011|publisher=Newsweek Magazine|date=17 March 2009|author=Kathryn Joyce}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fox News Channel ===
On January 16, 2007, [[Fox News Channel]]'s ''Live Desk with Martha MacCallum'' aired a segment, "When birthing children is a religious experience." [[Martha MacCallum]] talks with Rachel Scott, author, "Birthing God's Mighty Warriors." Rachel Scott answers common questions asked to large families and disputes myths that "Quiverfull" women are made to stay home and tend to babies. Rachel Scott describes the [[Proverbs 31 woman]] as a business owner, educated and very capable. Rachel Scott also shares about "the dream with a warrior angel" that started her "Quiverfull" experience and led to writing her book, "Birthing God's Mighty Warriors."

=== Quiverfull responses ===
In the proximate aftermath of the U.S. national print articles, responses from Quiverfull adherents in ''The Quiverfull Digest'' ranged from "feeling betrayed" to assertions that the articles were "fair."&lt;ref name="QFDigest"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quiverfull.com/digest.php|title=The Quiverfull Digest|publisher=The Quiverfull Digest|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, a few disagreeing Quiverfull adherents undertook [[apologetic]] responses on the Internet discussion forums provided by the latter national publishers in immediate on-site connection with their articles.&lt;ref name="joyce"/&gt;&lt;ref name="newsweek"/&gt;

==Notable adherents==
* [[Doug Phillips]], a [[Calvinist]] [[Christian]] and the son of [[U.S. Constitution Party]] leader [[Howard Phillips (politician)|Howard Phillips]] and former president of [[Vision Forum Ministries]] that advocates for [[Biblical patriarchy]], [[creationism]], [[homeschooling]], and Quiverfull. Doug and his wife Beall have eight children.&lt;ref name="campN"/&gt;&lt;ref name="vf"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.visionforumministries.org/home/about/about_the_president.aspx |title=About the President|accessdate=2007-01-23|publisher=Vision Forum Ministries|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Charles D. Provan]], whose book ''The Bible and Birth Control'' is routinely cited by Quiverfull adherents as providing important theological justification for their movement. He was quoted in a November 27, 2006, article about Quiverfull in ''[[The Nation]]'' magazine. He was an author of books and articles on other [[Christian]] topics. Before Provan's 2007 death, he and his wife had 10 children.&lt;ref name="joyce"/&gt;
* [[R. C. Sproul, Jr.]], a [[Calvinist]] [[Christian]] [[theologian]] and the son of [[R. C. Sproul|Robert Charles Sproul]]. He was a noted Reformed theologian and founder of [[Ligonier Ministries]]. Before his wife's death, Sproul Jr. and his wife Denise had eight children.&lt;ref name="sproulbook"&gt;{{cite book | title=Bound for Glory: God's Promise for Your Family| last=Sproul| first=R.

* [[Turpin case|David and Louise Turpin]], parents who allegedly imprisoned their thirteen children for years or even decades in Perris, California, USA. On January 14, 2018, one of the children escaped and contacted police who, on entering the home, found some of the children in a dark, foul-smelling room. The siblings ranged in age from 2 to 29, with seven of the thirteen children being over the age of 18 at the time of the parents' arrest.&lt;ref name="intouchweekly.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intouchweekly.com/posts/turpin-family-duggars-quiverfull-151742|title=Quiverfull: More Children For God's Army|accessdate=January 19, 2018|publisher= [[In Touch Weekly]] |author=Carly Sitzer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1874">'''Radomir Lukić ''' ({{lang-sr|Радомир Лукић}}) (August 31, 1914 – May 31, 1999) was a prolific [[Serbia]]n [[jurist]], a scholar of [[jurisprudence|philosophy]] and [[sociology of law]]. He was born in [[Miloševac (Velika Plana)|Miloševac]] near [[Velika Plana]], [[Serbia]], where he was also buried.

His parents died when he was very young and he had a difficult childhood. Lukić graduated from the [[University of Belgrade]]'s [[University of Belgrade Faculty of Law|Law School]]  in 1933 as an excellent student and received a Ph.D. degree in [[Paris]] in 1939. He became a Professor of Law at the [[University of Belgrade Faculty of Law]] at the unusually early age of 26, and between 1958-1960 was the dean of the Faculty of Law.

He taught a number of important courses, including Theory of State and Law, [[Philosophy of Law]], General [[Sociology]] and [[Methodology]] of [[Jurisprudence]]. He was a visiting lecturer at [[Grenoble]], [[Paris]], [[Nice]], [[Warsaw]], [[Moscow]] and [[Köln]].

Lukić is known for writing the first [[textbook]] on [[sociology]] in the [[former Yugoslavia]].

The [[University of Belgrade Faculty of Law]] named its main lecture hall in his memory, and established the Radomir Lukić Foundation to honor of his scholarship. There is a monument to him (metal bust on a stonework parapet/pedestal) in front of the Municipal Courthouse of Velika Plana.

[[File:Dzogchen A.png|thumb|Tibetan letter "A" inside a thigle. The A, which corresponds to the sound ‘ahh’,{{sfn|Norbu|2002|p=56}} represents kadag while the thigle represents lhun grub.]]
{{Tibetan Buddhism}}
In [[Dzogchen]] teaching, '''rigpa''' ({{bo|t=རིག་པ་|w=rig pa}}; Skt. [[Vidya (Knowledge)|vidyā]]; "knowledge") is the knowledge of the [[Ground (Dzogchen)|ground]].{{refn|group=note|''ghzi''; Skrt. ''ālaya''{{sfn|Schaik|2004|p=5}}}} The opposite of rigpa is marigpa ([[Avidyā (Buddhism)|avidyā]], ignorance).

==Definition==
''Rigpa'' is the knowledge of the [[Ground (Dzogchen)|ground]].{{refn|group=note|''ghzi''; Skrt. ''ālaya''{{sfn|Schaik|2004|p=5}}}} [[Erik Pema Kunsang]] translates a text which provides basic definitions of rigpa and marigpa in a Dzogchen context:
{{quote|Unknowing (marigpa) is not knowing the nature of mind. Knowing (rigpa) is the knowing of the original wakefulness that is personal experience.{{sfn|Kunsang|2006|p=Chapter 15}}}}
In Dzogchen, a fundamental point of practice is to distinguish rigpa from sems (''[[citta]]'', (grasping) mind).{{sfn|Kunsang|2012|p=154}}

===Kadag and lhungrub===
Rigpa has two aspects, namely ''kadag'' and ''lhun grub''.{{sfn|Dalai Lama|2004|p=32}} ''Kadag'' means "purity" or specifically "primordial purity".{{sfn|Rinpoche Dzogchen Ponlop|2003}}{{sfn|Dalai Lama|2004|p=30}} ''Lhun grub'' in Tibetan normally implies automatic, self-caused or spontaneous actions or processes.{{sfn|Hookham|1991|p=49-50}} As quality of ''rigpa'' it means "spontaneous presence"{{sfn|Rinpoche Dzogchen Ponlop|2003}}{{refn|group=note|name="lhun grub"|See also [http://rywiki.tsadra.org/index.php/lhun_grub rywiki, ''lhun grub'']}} It may also mean "having a self-contained origin", being primordially Existent, without an origin, self-existent.{{sfn|Hookham|1991|p=49-50}} This division is the Dzogchen-equivalent of the more common Mahayana wisdom and compassion division.{{sfn|Dalai Lama|2004|p=32}}

===Full measure of rigpa===
Citing Dodrupchen Jikme Tenpe Nyima, the 14th Dalai Lama states the full measure of rigpa occurs with the [http://www.rigpawiki.org/index.php?title=Four_visions third vision].{{sfn|Dalai Lama|2004|p=183-4}}

==Practice==
{{See also|Dzogchen#Main practice}}

Dzogchen practices aim to attain rigpa and integrate this into everyday life:
{{quote|The practical training of the Dzogchen path is traditionally, and most simply, described in terms of View, Meditation and Action. To see directly the Absolute state, the Ground of our being is the View; the way of stabilising that view, and making it an unbroken experience is Meditation; and integrating the View into our entire reality, and life, is what is meant by Action.&lt;ref&gt;Sogyal Rinpoche (1992), ''The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying'', p.151]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[Menngagde]] or 'Instruction Class' of Dzogchen teachings are divided into two parts: ''Trekchö'' and ''Tögal'' (thod rgal). Ron Garry: 
{{quote|The practice is that of Cutting through Solidity (khregs chod), which is related to primordial purity (ka dag); and Direct Vision of Reality (thod rgal), which is related to spontaneous presence (Ihun grub).&lt;ref name="Dudjom Rinpoche 2005, page 296"&gt;Dudjom Rinpoche. ''Wisdom Nectar. '' Snow Lion 2005, page 296.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The '''Sant Nirankari Mission'''  ({{lang-hi|संत निरंकारी मिशन}}; also known as '''Universal Brotherhood Mission''') is a spiritual organisation based out of Delhi, India. The Sant Nirankari Mission identifies itself as "neither a new religion nor a sect of an existing religion, but an all-embracing spiritual movement dedicated to human welfare by helping seekers realize God through the grace of a living true master (satguru) ".&lt;ref name="Baba Buta Singh Ji" group="SNM"&gt;{{cite web|title=History {{!}} Baba Buta Singh Ji (1873–1943) |url=http://www.nirankari.com/modules/founder/bababuta/|work=Sant Nirankari Mission|publisher=Sant Nirankari Mandal (Regd.) |accessdate=10 December 2010|location=Delhi, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mission originated from the [[Nirankari]] movement started by [[Baba Dyal Singh]] but is no longer affiliated with the movement.&lt;ref name="McLeod2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=W. H. McLeod|title=Historical dictionary of Sikhism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ma3G-hjh6SwC&amp;pg=PA180|accessdate=12 April 2012|date=28 July 2005|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-5088-0|pages=180–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Established in 1929 by [[Baba Buta Singh]], it has been targeted by orthodox [[Sikh]] groups, who consider the Mission to be a heresy of [[Sikhism]].&lt;ref name="Gould2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=William Gould|title=Religion and Conflict in Modern South Asia|url=http://books.gogle.com/books?id=K2oexn_mLPIC&amp;pg=PA237|accessdate=12 April 2012|date=31 October 2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-70511-0|pages=237–}}{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mission has more than 3000 centers and millions of followers across the world.As desired and blessed by the fifth Nirankari Satguru Mata Savinder Hardev Ji Maharaj, holy sister Sudiksha Ji has been declared as sixth Nirankari Satguru and the spiritual head of the Sant Nirankari Mission from 17th July 2018.

==History==
The [[Nirankari]] movement began with the reformist teachings of [[Baba Dyal Singh]] in the early 19th century. Baba Dyal Singh emphasised the importance of a living guru, while mainstream Sikhism accepted the [[Guru Granth Sahib|Sikh scriptures]] as the final, and current, guru of the faith. In 1929, one segment of the movement led by Baba Buta Singh, now known as the Sant Nirankari Mission, disassociated itself from the original Nirankari movement as well as mainstream Sikhism and became an independent sect.&lt;ref name="Rangaswamy2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Padma Rangaswamy|title=Namaste America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yy-2xNW84dsC&amp;pg=PA269|accessdate=12 April 2012|date=30 December 2007|publisher=Penn State Press|isbn=978-0-271-02775-3|pages=269–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baba Buta Singh was succeeded by [[Baba Avtar Singh]]. In the 1960s, the rapid growth of the Sant Nirankari Mission aroused the ire of fundamentalist Sikhs and led to violent clashes.&lt;ref name="Marty1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=Martin E. Marty|title=Fundamentalisms and the State: Remaking Polities, Economies, and Militance|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=doCmVaOnh_wC&amp;pg=PA273|accessdate=12 April 2012|date=1 July 1996|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-50884-9|pages=273–}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were significant violent [[1978 Sikh-Nirankari clashes|clashes in 1978]] that led to [[Operation Blue Star]] and the [[Punjab insurgency|1980s insurgency in Punjab]]. In 1980, [[Gurbachan Singh]], third head (''satguru'') of the Mission, was assassinated by Ranjit Singh, a member of the [[Akhand Kirtani Jatha]]. The Jatha, shortly before the killing, had been involved in protests against the followers of the Sant Nirankari Mission.&lt;ref name=SATP&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/publication/nightsoffalsehood/falsehood4.htm |title=Punjab: The Knights of Falsehood – Psalms of Terror |date=31 December 2001 |work=South Asia Terrorism Portal |publisher=Institute for Conflict Management |location=New Delhi |accessdate=13 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After the assassination of third guru Gurubachan SIngh, his son [[Baba Hardev Singh]] succeeded as the head of the organisation and spread the Mission's message of universal brotherhood through God-realization until his death on 13 May 2016. On 5 Aug 2016, Baba Hardev Singh's wife, Savinder Kaur succeeded him and became the first woman to lead the Sant Nirankari Mission. On 16 July 2018, Sudiksha Singh, daughter of former head of the mission Satguru Baba Hardev Singh and Mata Savinder Hardev, was declared as Nirankari Satguru and the Spiritual Head of Sant Nirankari Mission with the blessing of Satguru Mata Savinder Hardev. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Baba Hardev Singh’s wife Savinder to head Nirankari sect|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india/baba-hardev-singh-s-wife-savinder-to-head-nirankari-sect/story-1sV5crjSgv84fqJO1kzFUJ.html|newspaper=Hindustan Times|accessdate=19 May 2016|date=18 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Avtar Bani==
The ''Avtar Bani'' outlines the key philosophy of the Sant Nirankari Mission, and serves as its primary  text, though not necessarily a holy book. It is named after its author Baba Avtar Singh.&lt;ref name="Baba Avtar Singh Ji" group="SNM"&gt;{{cite web |title=SNM History – Baba Avtar Singh Ji |url=http://www.nirankari.com/history/hist3.htm |work=Sant Nirankari Mission |publisher=Sant Nirankari Mandal (Regd.) |accessdate=11 December 2010 |location=Delhi, India |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100702161707/http://www.nirankari.com/history/hist3.htm |archivedate=2 July 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its initial version was first published in 1957. The ''Sampuran Avtar Bani'' (complete ''Avtar Bani'') was published in 1965. The ''Avtar Bani'' was originally written in Punjabi verse, but some stanzas were in the  Sindhi language. It contains 376 hymns which describe the qualities of Formless God (''Nirankar'') and the important role of a spiritual guru in attaining God-realisation. It has been published in [[Gurumukhi]], [[Devnagari]] and Roman scripts, and has also been translated and published in English (verse and prose), Hindi, Bengali, Gujarati, Tamil, Telugu, Nepali and Marathi languages.

The ''Hardev Bani'', authored by Baba Hardev Singh, was published in 2017. Written in HIndi, the ''Hardev Vani'' contains 301 verses.

==Nirankari Museum==
The Nirankari Museum was inaugurated by fourth ''satguru,'' Baba Hardev Singh, on 22 February 2005. The museum is located within the Sant Nirankari Sarovar in [[New Delhi]]. It depicts the history and key teachings of the Mission through audio-visuals and pictures.&lt;ref name="The Hindu"&gt;{{cite news |author="Our Staff Reporter" |date=23 February 2005 |title=Nirankari Museum inaugurated |newspaper=The Hindu |location=Chennai, Madras, India |publisher=Kasturi and Sons Ltd  |oclc=35304678 |accessdate=11 December 2010|url=http://www.hinduonnet.com/2005/02/23/stories/2005022316760300.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Tribune"&gt;{{cite news |date=24 February 2005 |title=A museum of spiritual panorama |newspaper=The Tribune |location=Chandigarh, India |author=Tribune News Service |publisher=The Tribune Trust |oclc=47351219 |accessdate=11 December 2010 |url=http://www.tribuneindia.com/2005/20050225/delhi.htm#15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Scott Sunken Garden''' is a historical landmark in [[Lansing, Michigan]], United States of America.

The outer foundation walls are 51 feet by 79 feet and the center is a 28 feet by 45 feet lawn. There are shorter [[limestone]] walls lining the court with raised flower beds. The west side and east sides have limestone steps leading to a small water pond below the grotto center piece. This foundation of Justice Edward Cahill's home was redesigned after 1930 by a new American immigrant, Nick Kriek. The gardening includes bulbs, annuals, perennials and a list of species introduced to the area by Kriek himself.
The garden has been maintained by the Greater Lansing Garden Club for 3 decades; they restored it after a few decades of neglect by the city.&lt;ref name="The New Citizens Press Sunday: September 26, 2010"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tncp.net/Articles/tabid/1800/articletype/ArticleView/articleID/2475/Default.aspx |title=History of Scott Sunken Garden and Its Restoration &gt; The New Citizens Press &amp;#124; TNCP &amp;#124; Lansing Michigan News &gt; TNCP &amp;#124; Greater Lansing MI News |publisher=tncp.net|accessdate=2016-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Scott Sunken Garden landmark has a list of historically significant ties including 1930's "Golden Age of American Landscaping", Immigration, Civil Rights, and Lansing's Beautification.&lt;ref name="Non-profit Community Advocacy Organized for Scott Sunken Gardens"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/scottsunkengarden |title=Scott Sunken Garden, Friends |publisher=facebook.com|accessdate=2016-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognition==

National Register Coordinator for the State of Michigan state that the Scott Sunken Garden Is eligible for listing in the [[National Register of Historic Places]].... The garden appears to meet national register criteria B and C...." &lt;ref name="Robert O. Christensen, National Register Coordinator, State Historic Preservation Office, MI State Housing Development Authority"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/notes/scott-sunken-garden-friends/national-register-coordinators-recommendation-of-scott-sunken-gardens-historical/1027945290586784 |title=National Register Coordinator’s recommendation of Scott Sunken Garden’s historical recognition as a national asset |publisher=facebook.com|accessdate=2016-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
"Even though the Scott House  itself – the house  that stood just west of the garden near the Jenison House/Scott Center –  that formed the central feature of the property no longer exists, the  garden stands out as a fine example of formal landscape garden design  from the early twentieth century (various dates  of construction from the mid-1920s to 1934-35 have been reported). As  far as I’ve been able to determine from all the recent discussions, the  garden is unique in Lansing as a formal garden that, designed for an  urban residential setting, dates from the early  twentieth century period when landscaped gardens and estates associated  with them reached a height of design perfection, during what has been  called the “Golden Age of American Landscape Design.” The Scott Sunken  Garden, in my mind, possesses additional significance  as a prime achievement of a local Lansing artisan, Nick or Nicolaas  Isaac Willem Kriek. Kriek (1895–1978) was born in the Netherlands and, settling in Lansing in the early 1920s, founded the Cottage Gardens  nursery in 1923. Bill Hicks, Mr. Kriek’s grandson  and today part of the still operating family-owned business, states  that Nick Kriek built the Sunken Garden for Scott, from whom he had  purchased the property on which the Cottage Gardens nursery was  established in 1923. It seems logical to think that Kriek  had a major hand in designing the garden to meet the Scotts’ wishes and  requirements. The garden also possesses importance for its direct  association with an important Lansing citizen, Richard H. Scott, who  owned the property and had the garden created. Marilyn  Lee’s 2010 history of the garden states that Scott came to Lansing in  1898 to work for auto pioneer R. E. Olds and helped organize Olds’ Reo  Motor Car Company and served as president of the company after Olds  retired in 1923."
&lt;ref name="Robert O. Christensen, National Register Coordinator, State Historic Preservation Office, MI State Housing Development Authority" /&gt;
This Scott Sunken Garden foundation is presumed to be the remains of Justice Edward Cahill's Lansing home. He moved to Lansing after serving in the Civil War and went to war serving beside African American soldiers in Michigan's 102nd USCI on a campaign through southern states. Justice Edward Cahill served in the Michigan Supreme Court in 1890.&lt;ref name="Men of Progress, Embracing Biographical Sketches of Representative Michigan Men With an Outline History of the State, Dedicated to the Newspaper Press of Michigan Detroit, Michigan Published by the Evening News Association 1900"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/groups/137660544586/permalink/10154507434494587/ |title=Historical Society of Greater Lansing public group &amp;#124; Facebook &amp;#124; "Men of Progress" |publisher=facebook.com|accessdate=2016-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Justice Cahill also concurred upholding [[Racial equality]] in USA's landmark Civil Right's "William W. Ferguson vs. Edward G. Gies" case &lt;ref name="BlackPast.org v2.0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blackpast.org/primary/william-w-ferguson-vs-edward-g-gies |title=William W. Ferguson vs. Edward G.

The local chapter of this national garden club has a long history with both the Scott Sunken Garden and the Scott Center. The club met at the Scott Center before it was moved to Scott Park and the Garden Club invested the financing to restoration of this landmark garden through the early 80s. The city actually fell short of original expectations and the Garden Club even paid for a restoration of the lower wall of the Scott Sunken Garden &lt;ref name="The New Citizens Press Sunday: September 26, 2010" /&gt;

==Politics==
[[File:Scott Garden Grotto.jpg|thumb|]]
The city is in need of widespread upgrades to the Power Grid infrastructure inducing several substations to replace the older Eckert Substation next to the Eckert Power Station. The [[Lansing Board of Water and Light]] (LBWL) and Mayor Virg Bernero have pushed for a large Central Substation with their proposal to destroy a riverside park (Scott Park) and to remove historical integrity of its historical landmark of Scott Sunken Garden.

===LBWL Proposals===

The LBWL had submitted an original proposal to the Lansing Parks and Recreation then amended it during the review by the Lansing Planning Board. These Board's are appointed by the Mayor and their decisions are being reviewed by the Lansing City Council.

===Parkland Advocacy===

The Scott Sunken Garden caretakers of 3 decades, the Greater Lansing Garden Club, has declined the LBWL offer of the new garden wanting the historical garden to remain in tact. Each public board meeting and the public meeting held by Jessica Yorko (as Lansing City Council, 4th Ward Representative) were occupied with citizen advocates. There are multiple community organizations publicly advocating saving Scott Sunken Garden, and its Scott Park; "Preservation Lansing" has advocated this along with a list of other historical concerns in the area; [http://www.facebook.com/scottsunkengarden "Friends of Scott Sunken Garden Park"] is a non-profit advocacy organization instituted for protecting Scott Sunken Garden and its neighboring assets of the People of Lansing.

====Public Petitions====

Original Petition for Lansing Parks and Recreation: "Save Scott Park and the Sunken Garden"

Request for more ideal alternative and assistance with concerns by officials: "Two Downtown Lansing Substations Audit and Investigation into Concerns by Mayor and LBW" &lt;ref name="Scott Sunken Garden advocacy petitions"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lansinggarden.com/petitions |title=Public petitions |publisher=lansinggarden.com|accessdate=2016-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Citizen's pension ==
The term ''citizen's pension'' (known also as universal pension, demogrant or categorical pension) is used to describe a social pension that realises the right to basic income in old age.&lt;ref&gt;http://larrywillmore.net/SocialPensions.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Citizen's pensions are based in law and provide cash transfers to older people subject only to tests of age and citizenship or residency, never income, assets or other pension income. A citizen's pension is not a retirement pension. There is no income test, so it is not necessary to stop working to receive it.

Some researchers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pension-watch.net/pensions/key-debates/key-debates/citizens-pensions/|title=Citizen's pensions - Key debates - Pension watch|author=|date=|website=www.Pension-Watch.net|access-date=16 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; apply the term ''citizen's pension'' to social pensions that exclude – partially or totally - older people with other pension income, irrespective of their non-pension income or wealth. "Universal minimum pension" is another description of such a scheme, which tops up small pensions and provides full, basic pensions only to those with no other pension income.

{{About-distinguish|Social Practice as a minor psychological theory|Practice Theory}}

{{For|the art medium of Social Practice|Social practice (art)}}

'''Social practice''' is a theory within psychology that seeks to determine the link between practice and context within social situations. Emphasized as a commitment to change, social practice occurs in two forms: activity and inquiry. Most often applied within the context of human development, social practice involves knowledge production and the theorization and analysis of both institutional and intervention practices.&lt;ref&gt;Smolka, A. L. B. (2001). Social practice and social change: activity theory in perspective. Human Development, 44(6), 362-367.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background in psychology==
Through research, [[Sylvia Scribner]] sought to understand and create a decent life for all people regardless of geographical position, race, gender, and social class.&lt;ref&gt;Hedegaard, M. (1998). A cultural-historical approach to mind. Human Development, 41(3), 205-209.&lt;/ref&gt; Using anthropological field research and psychological experimentation, Scribner tried to dig deeper into human mental functioning and its creation through social practice in different societal and cultural settings. She therefore aimed to enact social reform and community development through an ethical orientation that accounts for the interaction of historical and societal conditions of different institutional settings with human social and mental functioning and development.

==Social practice as activity==
Social practice involves engagement with communities of interest by creating a practitioner-community relationship wherein there remains a focus on the skills, knowledge, and understanding of people in their private, family, community, and working lives.&lt;ref&gt;“What is social practice?” (n.d.). Retrieved April 25, 2013, from http://spiritstorelimerick.weebly.com/what-is-social-practice.html.&lt;/ref&gt; In this approach to social practice, activity is used for social change without the agenda of research. Activity theory suggests the use of a system of participants that work toward an object or goal that brings about some form of change or transformation in the community.&lt;ref&gt;Hung, D., Tan, S. C., &amp; Koh, T. S. (2006). From traditional to constructivist epistemologies: a proposed theoretical framework based on activity theory for learning communities. Journal of Interactive Learning Research, 17(1), 37-55.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social practice as inquiry==
Within research, social practice aims to integrate the individual with his or her surrounding environment while assessing how context and culture relate to common actions and practices of the individual. Just as social practice is an activity itself, inquiry focuses on how social activity occurs and identifies its main causes and outcomes. It has been argued that research be developed as a specific theory of social practice through which research purposes are defined not by philosophical paradigms but by researchers' commitments to specific forms of social action.&lt;ref&gt;Herndl, C. G., &amp; Nahrwold, C. A. (2000). Research as social practice: a case study of research on technical and professional communication. Written Communication, 17(2), 158-296.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Areas of interest==
===Education===
In education, social practice refers to the use of adult-child interaction for observation in order to propose intentions and gauge the reactions of others.&lt;ref&gt;Rowe, D. W. (2010). Directions for studying early literacy as social practice. Language Arts, 88(2), 134-143.&lt;/ref&gt; Under social practice, [[literacy]] is seen as a key dimension of community regeneration and a part of the wider lifelong learning agenda.  In particular, literacy is considered to be an area of instruction for the introduction of social practice through social language and social identity. According to social practice in education, literacy and [[numeracy]] are complex  capabilities rather than a simple set of basic skills. Furthermore, adult learners are more likely to develop and retain knowledge, skills, and understanding if they see them as relevant to their own problems and challenges. Social practice perspectives focus on local literacies and how literacy practices are affected by settings and groups interacting around print.

===Literature===
As literature is repeatedly studied in education and critiqued in discourse, many believe that it should be a field of social practice as it evokes emotion and discussion of social interactions and social conditions. Those that believe literature may be construed as a form of social practice believe that literature and society are essentially related to each other. As such, they attempt to define specific sociological practices of literature and share expressions of literature as works comprising text, institution, and individual. Overall, literature becomes a realm of social exchange through fiction, poetry, politics, and history.&lt;ref&gt;Desan, P., Ferguson, P. P., &amp; Griswold, W. (Eds.). (1989). Literature and social practice, 1st Ed. Chicago: University of Chicago Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Italic title}}
'''''Sturm und Drang''''' ({{IPA-de|ˈʃtʊɐ̯m ʊnt ˈdʁaŋ}}, literally "storm and drive", "storm and urge", though conventionally translated as "storm and stress")&lt;ref&gt;E.g. HB Garland, Storm and Stress (London, 1952)&lt;/ref&gt; was a proto-[[Romanticism|Romantic]] movement in [[German literature]] and [[Music of Germany|music]] that occurred between the late 1760s and early 1780s. Within the movement, individual [[subjectivity]] and, in particular, extremes of emotion were given free expression in reaction to the perceived constraints of rationalism imposed by the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and associated [[aesthetic]] movements. The period is named for [[Friedrich Maximilian Klinger]]'s [[Sturm und Drang (play)|play of the same name]], which was first performed by [[Abel Seyler]]'s [[Seyler theatrical company|famed theatrical company]] in 1777.

The philosopher [[Johann Georg Hamann]] is considered to be the ideologue of ''Sturm und Drang''; other significant figures were [[Johann Anton Leisewitz]], [[Jakob Michael Reinhold Lenz]], [[H. L. Wagner]], and [[Friedrich Maximilian Klinger]]. [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] and [[Friedrich Schiller]] were notable proponents of the movement early in their life, although they ended their period of association with it by initiating what would become [[Weimar Classicism]].

==Historical background==
===Counter-Enlightenment===
{{Main|Counter-Enlightenment}}

[[French neoclassicism]] (including [[French neoclassical theatre]]), a movement beginning in the early [[Baroque]], with its emphasis on the [[Rationality|rational]], was the principal target of rebellion for adherents of the ''Sturm und Drang'' movement. For them, sentimentality and an [[objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] view of life gave way to emotional turbulence and individuality, and enlightenment ideals such as [[rationalism]], [[empiricism]], and [[universalism]] no longer captured the human condition; emotional extremes and subjectivity became the vogue during the late 18th century.

===Origin of the term===
[[File:Abel Seyler silhouette - Basel.svg|thumb|upright|The theatre director [[Abel Seyler]]]]

The term ''Sturm und Drang'' first appeared as the title of [[Sturm und Drang (play)|a play]] by [[Friedrich Maximilian Klinger]], written for [[Abel Seyler]]'s ''[[Seylersche Schauspiel-Gesellschaft]]'' and published in 1776.&lt;ref&gt;Karthaus, Ulrich: Sturm und Drang. Epoche-Werke-Wirkung. München: C.H.Beck Verlag, 2. aktualisierte Auflage. 2007, S. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; The setting of the play is the unfolding [[American Revolution]], in which the author gives violent expression to difficult emotions and extols individuality and subjectivity over the prevailing order of rationalism. Though it is argued that literature and music associated with ''Sturm und Drang'' predate this seminal work, it was from this point that German artists became distinctly self-conscious of a new aesthetic. This seemingly spontaneous movement became associated with a wide array of German authors and composers of the mid-to-late [[Neoclassicism|Classical period]].&lt;ref&gt;Preminger, Alex; Brogan, T. V. F. (eds.). (1993). ''The New Princeton Encyclopedia of Poetry and Poetics''. Princeton: Princeton University. p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Sturm und Drang'' came to be associated with literature or music aimed at shocking the audience or imbuing them with extremes of emotion. The movement soon gave way to [[Weimar Classicism]] and early [[Romanticism]], whereupon a [[socio-political]] concern for greater human freedom from despotism was incorporated along with a religious treatment of all things natural.&lt;ref&gt;Pascal, Roy. (April, 1952). ''The Modern Language Review'', Vol. 47, No. 2. pp. 129–151: p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is much debate regarding whose work should or should not be included in the canon of ''Sturm und Drang''. One point of view would limit the movement to [[Goethe]], [[Johann Gottfried Herder]], [[Jakob Michael Reinhold Lenz]], and their direct German associates writing works of fiction and/or philosophy between 1770 and the early 1780s.&lt;ref&gt;Pascal, p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt; The alternative perspective is that of a literary movement inextricably linked to simultaneous developments in prose, poetry, and drama, extending its direct influence throughout the German-speaking lands until the end of the 18th century. Nevertheless, the originators of the movement came to view it as a time of premature exuberance that was then abandoned in favor of often conflicting artistic pursuits.&lt;ref&gt;Heckscher, William S. (1966–1967) Simiolus: ''Netherlands Quarterly for the History of Art'', Vol. 1, No. 2. pp. 94–105: p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Related aesthetic and philosophical movements===
{{See also|Sentimentalism (literature)|Primitivism|Ossian}}
[[File:Johann Georg Hamann (1730 –1788).jpg|thumb|upright|Johann Georg Hamann]]
The literary topos of the "Kraftmensch" existed as a precursor to ''Sturm und Drang'' among dramatists beginning with [[Friedrich Maximilian Klinger|F.M. Klinger]], the expression of which is seen in the radical degree to which [[individuality]] need appeal to no outside authority save the self nor be tempered by [[rationalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Leidner, Alan. (March 1989). C.  PMLA, Vol. 104, No. 2, pp. 178-189: p. 178&lt;/ref&gt; These [[Ideal (ethics)|ideals]] are identical to those of ''Sturm und Drang'', and it can be argued that the later name exists to catalog a number of parallel, co-influential movements in [[German literature]] rather than express anything substantially different from what German dramatists were achieving in the violent plays attributed to the Kraftmensch movement.

Major philosophical/theoretical influences on the literary ''Sturm und Drang'' movement were [[Johann Georg Hamann]] (especially the 1762 text ''Aesthetica in nuce. Eine Rhapsodie in kabbalistischer Prose'') and [[Johann Gottfried Herder]], both from Königsberg, and both formerly in contact with [[Immanuel Kant]]. Significant theoretical statements of Sturm und Drang aesthetics by the movement's central dramatists themselves include Lenz' ''Anmerkungen übers Theater'' and Goethe's ''Von deutscher Baukunst'' and ''Zum Schäkespears Tag'' (''sic''). The most important contemporary document was the 1773 volume ''Von deutscher Art und Kunst. Einige fliegende Blätter'', a collection of essays that included commentaries by Herder on Ossian and Shakespeare, along with contributions by Goethe, [[Paolo Frisi]] (in translation from the Italian), and [[Justus Möser]].

==In literature==
===Characteristics===
The [[protagonist]] in a typical ''Sturm und Drang'' stage work, [[poem]], or [[novel]] is driven to action—often violent action—not by pursuit of noble means nor by true motives, but by [[revenge]] and greed. [[Goethe]]'s unfinished ''[[Prometheus (Goethe)|Prometheus]]'' exemplifies this along with the common ambiguity provided by juxtaposing [[humanism|humanistic]] platitudes with outbursts of irrationality.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Liedner, p. 178&lt;/ref&gt; The literature of ''Sturm und Drang'' features an anti-[[Aristocracy (class)|aristocrat]]ic slant while seeking to elevate all things humble, natural, or intensely real (especially whatever is painful, tormenting, or frightening).

The story of hopeless love and eventual suicide presented in [[Goethe]]'s [[sentimental novel]] ''[[Die Leiden des jungen Werthers]]'' (1774) is an example of the author's tempered introspection regarding his love and torment. [[Friedrich Schiller]]'s drama, ''[[Die Räuber]]'' (1781), provided the groundwork for [[melodrama]] to become a recognized dramatic form. The plot portrays a conflict between two aristocratic brothers, Franz and Karl Moor. Franz is cast as a villain attempting to cheat Karl out of his inheritance, though the motives for his action are complex and initiate a thorough investigation of good and evil. Both of these works are seminal examples of ''Sturm und Drang'' in [[German literature]].

==In music==
The Classical period music (1750–1800) associated with ''Sturm und Drang'' is predominantly written in a [[minor key]] to convey difficult or depressing sentiments. The principal [[musical theme|themes]] tend to be angular, with large leaps and unpredictable [[melody|melodic]] contours. [[Tempo]]s and [[Dynamics (music)|dynamics]] change rapidly and unpredictably in order to reflect strong changes of emotion. Pulsing [[rhythm]]s and [[syncopation]] are common, as are racing lines in the [[soprano]] or [[alto]] registers. Writing for string instruments features [[tremolo]] and sudden, dramatic dynamic changes and accents.

===History===
[[Musical theater]] became the meeting place of the literary and musical strands of ''Sturm und Drang'', with the aim of increasing emotional expression in [[opera]]. The obligato recitative is a prime example. Here, orchestral accompaniment provides an intense underlay of vivid tone-painting to the solo [[recitative]]. [[Christoph Willibald Gluck]]'s 1761 ballet, ''[[Don Juan (ballet)|Don Juan]]'', heralded the emergence of ''Sturm und Drang'' in music; the program notes explicitly indicated that the D minor finale was to evoke fear in the listener. [[Jean Jacques Rousseau]]'s 1762 play, ''[[Pygmalion (1762 play)|Pygmalion]]'' (first performed in 1770) is a similarly important bridge in its use of underlying [[instrumental music]] to convey the mood of the spoken [[drama]]. The first example of [[melodrama]], ''Pygmalion'' influenced [[Goethe]] and other important German literary figures.&lt;ref&gt;Heartz, Daniel and [[Bruce Alan Brown]]. (Accessed 21 March 2007). 'Sturm und Drang', ''Grove Music Online'', "http://www.grovemusic.com/shared/views/article.html?section=music.27035"&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, relative to the influence of ''Sturm und Drang'' on literature, the influence on [[musical composition]] was limited, and many efforts to label music as conforming to this trend are tenuous at best. [[Vienna]], the center of German/Austrian music, was a cosmopolitan city with an international culture; therefore, melodically innovative and expressive works in minor keys by [[Mozart]] or [[Haydn]] from this period should generally be considered first in the broader context of musical developments taking place throughout Europe. The clearest musical connections to the self-styled ''Sturm und Drang'' movement can be found in [[opera]] and the early predecessors of [[program music]], such as Haydn's "Farewell" Symphony.

===Haydn===
A ''Sturm und Drang'' period is often attributed to the works of the Austrian composer [[Joseph Haydn]] from the late 1760s to early 1770s. Works during this period often feature a newly impassioned or agitated element; however, Haydn never mentions ''Sturm und Drang'' as a motivation for his new compositional style,&lt;ref&gt;Brown, A.  Peter. (Spring, 1992). ''The Journal of Musicology'', Vol. 10, No. 2. pp. 192-230: p. 198&lt;/ref&gt; and there remains an overarching adherence to classical form and motivic unity. Though Haydn may not have been consciously affirming the anti-rational ideals of ''Sturm und Drang'', one can certainly perceive the influence of contemporary trends in [[musical theatre]] on his instrumental works during this period.

===Mozart===
[[Mozart]]'s [[Symphony No. 25 (Mozart)|Symphony No. 25]] (the 'Little' G-minor symphony, 1773) is one of only two minor-key symphonies by the composer. Beyond the atypical key, the symphony features rhythmic syncopation along with the jagged themes associated with Sturm und Drang.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Craig and Bryan Simms. (2006). Music in Western Civilization. Belmont: Thomson Schirmer. p. 423&lt;/ref&gt; More interesting is the emancipation of the [[wind instruments]] in this piece, with the violins yielding to colorful bursts from the oboe and flute. However, it is likely the influence of numerous minor-key works by the Czech composer [[Johann Baptist Wanhal]] (a Viennese contemporary and acquaintance of Mozart), rather than a self-conscious adherence to a German literary movement, which is responsible for the harmonic and melodic experiments in the Symphony no. 25.&lt;ref&gt;A. Peter Brown, p. 198&lt;/ref&gt;

==In visual art==
The parallel movement in the visual arts can be witnessed in paintings of storms and shipwrecks showing the terror and irrational destruction wrought by nature. These pre-[[romanticism|romantic]] works were fashionable in Germany from the 1760s on through the 1780s, illustrating a public audience for emotionally provocative artwork. Additionally, disturbing visions and portrayals of [[nightmares]] were gaining an audience in Germany as evidenced by [[Goethe]]'s possession and admiration of paintings by [[Fuseli]] capable of 'giving the viewer a good fright.'&lt;ref&gt;Heartz/Bruce, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt; Notable artists included [[Joseph Vernet]], [[Caspar Wolf]], [[Philip James de Loutherbourg]], and [[Henry Fuseli]].

== In theatre==
The Sturm und Drang movement did not last long; according to Betty Waterhouse it began in 1771 and ended in 1778 (Waterhouse v). The rise of the middle class in the 18th century led to a change in the way society and social standings were looked at. Dramatists and writers saw the stage as a venue for critique and discussion of societal issues. French writer [[Louis-Sébastien Mercier]] suggested that drama be used to promote political ideas, a concept that would develop many years later. After the [[Seven Years’ War]], which ended in 1763, German spirit was extremely high and Germans felt a sense of importance on a grander stage. The aristocracy gained power as the ruling class, furthering the divide and increasing tensions between the classes (Liedner viii). With these new ideals came the sense that a new form of art capable of dethroning the extremely popular French neoclassicism was needed. [[Johann Georg Hamann]], a noted German philosopher and a major promoter of the Sturm und Drang movement, “defended the native culture of the [[Volk]] and maintained that language, the root of all our experience, was richer in images and more powerful prior to the ‘[[abstract object|abstract]]’ eighteenth century” (Liedner viii). Germany did not have a common nationality, and the nation broke up into hundreds of small states. The Sturm und Drang movement was a reaction to this lack of nationality and often dealt with the idea of living life on a smaller scale and the desire to become a part of something bigger.

The Sturm und Drang movement also paid a lot of attention to the language of a piece of literature. It is no wonder that [[Shakespeare]], with his brilliant use of language, originality with complex plot lines and subplots, and multifaceted characters from all social classes, was seen as a model for German writers (Wilson and Goldfarb 287). Many writers of the Sturm und Drang movement considered themselves to be challengers of the Enlightenment. However, the movement is actually a continuation of the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]. Many Sturm und Drang plays showed interest in how society affects the individual, a common theme in many Enlightenment plays as well. However, Sturm und Drang “makes its own distinctive contribution to 18th-century culture, bringing attention to the power of the environment as well as to the contradictory and self-defeating attitudes present in every segment of society” (Liedner ix). Far before its time, the divergent style of Sturm und Drang shrewdly explored depression and violence with an open plot structure (Liedner ix). The Sturm und Drang movement rebelled against all the rules of neoclassicism and the enlightenment, first recognized [[Shakespeare]] as a “genius” of [[dramaturgy]], and provided the foundation for 19th-century [[romanticism]]. Writers such as [[Heinrich Leopold Wagner]], [[Goethe]], [[Jakob Michael Reinhold Lenz|Lenz]], [[Friedrich Maximilian Klinger|Klinger]], and [[Schiller]] used episodic structure, violence, and mixed genres to comment on societal rules and morals, while doubting that anything would change. The Sturm und Drang movement was brief, but it set a fire that still burns intensely today.

Six main playwrights initiated and popularized the Sturm und Drang movement: Leisewitz, Wagner, Goethe, Lenz, Klinger, and Schiller. The theatre director [[Abel Seyler]], the owner of the [[Seylersche Schauspiel-Gesellschaft]], had an important role in promoting the Sturm und Drang poets.

=== Johann Anton Leisewitz ===
[[File:JALeisewitz.jpg|thumb|[[Johann Anton Leisewitz]]]]
[[Johann Anton Leisewitz]] was born in Hanover in 1752 and studied law. He is remembered for his single complete play, ''[[Julius of Tarent]]'' (1776), which is considered the forerunner of Schiller's work ''[[The Robbers]]'' (1781).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/335498/Johann-Anton-Leisewitz?anchor=ref141414 Johann Anton Leisewitz], ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]''&lt;/ref&gt; He was married to Sophie Seyler, the daughter of theatre director [[Abel Seyler]].

=== Wagner===
[[Heinrich Leopold Wagner]] was born in [[Strasbourg]] on February 19, 1747. He studied law and was a member of the literary group surrounding [[Johann Daniel Salzmann]]. He was a dramatist, producer, translator, and lawyer for the traveling Abel Seyler theatre company. Wagner was best known for his two plays, ''Die Reue nach der Tat'' (“The Remorse After the Deed”) in 1775 and ''Die Kindermorderin'' (“The Childmurderess”) in 1776. [[Child murder]] was a very popular topic in the 18th century and all of the major Sturm und Drang writers used it as a subject in their writings (Waterhouse 97). ''Die Kindermorderin'' was one of the most traditional plays of the Sturm und Drang. Although sharing aspects of [[Neoclassicism|neoclassical]] plays, such as a fairly simple plot and very few changes in the setting, it breaks away from the neoclassical idea that the protagonist must be of noble descent. Instead, this play shows how the aristocracy disrupts the lives of middle class characters (Liedner xii). This play also uses a vast array of colorful language to demonstrate the variety of characters and their social statuses. Another common theme seen in ''Die Kindermorderin'' is the idea of society hindering change. Groningseck, a lieutenant, seems to be willing to look past social norms and break down walls between the classes, but a fellow officer, Hasenpoth, betrays him (Liedner xii).

===Goethe===
[[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]] was born in August 1749, in the Free Imperial City of Frankfurt, Holy Roman Empire. He wrote his first important play, Goetz von Berlichingen in 1773, in Shakespearean style, a defining characteristic of the Sturm und Drang movement (Wilson and Goldfarb 287). [[Shakespeare]] was considered a genius among German playwrights, and was idolized for his “shattering of the dramatic unities of time, place and action; and his sharply individualized, emotionally complex characters” (Waterhouse v). Goethe was well known for his staging as well as his long dramatic poem Faust ([[Goethe's Faust]]) (Wilson and Goldfarb 287). Goethe was the director of theatre at the [[Weimar]] Theatre where he eventually ran the entire company. He went to Italy for two years to collect himself and while there discovered the beauty of the Greek and Roman ruins. After this trip he returned with interest in classical ideas and writing, and a new form of writing emerged called [[Weimar Classicism]].

===Lenz===
[[Jakob Michael Reinhold Lenz]] was born in [[Sesswegen]], now [[Latvia]], on the January 23, 1751. He studied theology and philosophy at the [[University of Konigsberg]]. His first poem, Die Landplagen (“Torments of the Land”), emerged in 1769. He went on to write “Notes on the Theatre”, The New Menoza and Der Hofmeister (“The Tutor”) in 1774, Pandemonium Germanicum in 1775, and Die Soldaten (“The Soldiers”) in 1776 (Liedner xi). Lenz took [[Aristotle]]’s popular idea of plot being more important than character and reversed it, as well as reclassified the distinctions between [[comedy]] and [[tragedy]]. In Lenz’s works, tragedies feature characters that make decisions that cause events, and in comedies a resolute milieu pushes and pulls the character through events (Liedner xi). The Soldiers is most likely Lenz’s most distinct example of Sturm und Drang literature. It centers on an idea of degradation of civilians by soldiers, but more specifically the seduction and abuse of young women by soldiers. Illustrating an undesirable, conflicted character with no power over her situation who does whatever she can to get through her current state, The Soldiers displays a “well-observed world where one’s identity is fluid – and hopelessly entangled in the social and linguistic environment” (Liedner xi). This idea of feeling unable to change one’s situation is typical of many Sturm und Drang plays. Lenz’s use of reserved dialogue, open form, violence, and a combination of comedy and tragedy precursors the works of contemporary authors such as [[Friedrich Dürrenmatt]] and [[Bertolt Brecht]] (Waterhouse v).

===Klinger===
[[Friedrich Maximilian Klinger]] was born in [[Frankfurt]] on February 17, 1752. He was born into a humble family and struggled financially after the death of his father. He studied law at [[Giessen]] with the financial help of [[Goethe]]’s family. He also worked with the Abel Seyler troupe for a year and a half (Pascal 132). Although famous for his Sturm und Drang style plays, many of his earlier plays were very classical in style. Some of Klinger’s works include Die Zwillinge (1776), Die neue Arria (1776), Simsone Grisaldo (1776), and Stilpo und seine Kinder (1780). Klinger’s most famous play, Sturm und Drang (1776), is the seminal piece of literature associated with the Sturm und Drang epoch. Strangely, the play is set in revolutionary America, not Germany. We see allusions to [[Shakespeare]]’s [[Romeo and Juliet]] through the feuds of the households, as well as [[All's Well That Ends Well]] in some of the character’s names (Liedner xiii). Klinger utilized a defining characteristic of Sturm und Drang when he mixed aspects of [[comedy]] and [[tragedy]] throughout the play, stating “ the deepest tragic emotion continually alternates with laughter and joviality" (Liedner xiii).

===Schiller===
[[Friedrich Schiller]] was born in [[Marbach am Neckar|Marbach]] on November 10, 1759. He studied medicine at [[Karlsschule Stuttgart]], a prestigious military academy founded by the [[Duke of Württemberg]]. He developed a strong relationship with [[Goethe]], one of the most influential writers of the time (Wilson and Goldfarb 287). They were particularly interested in questions concerning [[aesthetics]]. This relationship led to an epoch known as [[Weimar Classicism]], a style that integrates classical, [[Romanticism|romantic]] and [[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]] ideals (Leidner xiv). Following Schiller’s plays ''[[Die Räuber]]'' ("The Robbers") and ''[[Kabale und Liebe]]'' ("Intrigue and Love"), he went on to become a major poet as well as to write famous essays and Weimar Classical drama (Leidner xiv). ''Die Räuber'' tells the story of two brothers, the younger of which is infuriated by how society favors the first-born child and he acts on his feelings without any regard to societal rules or social standing. In act five, his views on God “represent the most blasphemous attack on religion in German literature up to that time… [and] is a masterful work of social dynamics that takes deep German patterns of sensibility into account” (Leidner xiv).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1502">In [[database theory|relational database theory]], a '''tuple-generating dependency''' (TGD) is a certain kind of constraint on a relational database. It is a subclass of the class of [[embedded dependency|embedded dependencies]] (EDs). A TGD is a sentence in first-order logic of the form:
∀x1 ... xn, P(x1, ..., xn) → ∃y1, ..., yk, Q(x1, ..., xn,y1, ..., ym),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-0-387-39940-9_1274|title=Encyclopedia of Database Systems|last=Fagin|first=Ronald|date=2009|publisher=Springer US|isbn=9780387355443|editor-last=LIU|editor-first=LING|pages=3201–3202|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-0-387-39940-9_1274|editor-last2=ÖZSU|editor-first2=M. TAMER}}&lt;/ref&gt; where P is a possibly empty and Q is a non-empty conjunction of relational atoms. A relational atom has the form R(w1, ..., wh) where each of the w, ..., wh, wi, wj, are variables or constants. An algorithm known as [[Chase (algorithm)|the chase]] takes as input an instance that may or may not satisfy a set of TGDs (or more generally EDs), and, if it terminates (which is a priori undecidable), outputs an instance that does satisfy the TGDs.
