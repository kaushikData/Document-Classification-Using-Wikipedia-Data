{{Constitutional history of Canada}}

'''The Act of Settlement''' is an [[Acts of the Parliament of England|Act of the Parliament of England]] that was passed in 1701&lt;ref&gt;The act received Royal Assent in 1701. However, it is formally dated as 1700 in official use, such as the listing for the act in the ''[[Chronological Table of the Statutes]]'', because acts passed before the [[Acts of Parliament (Commencement) Act 1793]] came into force are dated by the year in which the relevant parliamentary session began, which, in this case, was 1700 ([[Old Style and New Style dates|OS]]).&lt;/ref&gt; to settle the [[order of succession|succession]] to the [[List of English monarchs|English]] and [[List of Irish monarchs|Irish]] crowns on [[Protestant]]s only. The next Protestant in line to the throne was the [[Electress]] [[Sophia of Hanover]], a granddaughter of [[James VI and I|James VI of Scotland and I of England]]. After her the crowns would descend only to her non-[[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] heirs.

The act was prompted by the failure of [[William III of England|King William III]] and [[Mary II of England|Queen Mary II]], as well as of Mary's sister [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]], to produce any surviving children, and the [[Roman Catholic]] religion of all other members of the [[House of Stuart]]. The line of [[Sophia of Hanover]] was the most junior among the Stuarts, but consisted of convinced Protestants. Sophia died on 8 June 1714, before the death of Queen Anne on 1 August 1714. On Queen Anne's death, Sophia's son duly became [[George I of Great Britain|King George I]] and started the [[House of Hanover|Hanoverian dynasty]] in Britain.

The act played a key role in the formation of the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]]. England and Scotland had [[Union of the Crowns|shared a monarch]] since 1603, but had remained separately governed countries. The [[Scottish Parliament (pre-1707)|Scottish parliament]] was more reluctant than the [[English Parliament|English]] to abandon the House of Stuart, members of which had been [[Scottish monarchs]] long before they became [[English monarchs|English ones]]. English pressure on Scotland to accept the Act of Settlement was one factor leading to the [[Acts of Union 1707|parliamentary union of the two countries]] in 1707.

Under the Act of Settlement anyone who became a Roman Catholic, or who married one, became disqualified to inherit the throne. The act also placed limits on both the role of foreigners in the British government and the power of the monarch with respect to the Parliament of England. Some of those provisions have been altered by subsequent legislation.

Along with the [[Bill of Rights 1689]], the Act of Settlement remains today one of the main constitutional laws governing the [[Succession to the British throne|succession]] not only to the [[throne of the United Kingdom]], but to those of the other [[Commonwealth realm]]s, whether by assumption or by [[patriation]].&lt;ref name=Topo&gt;{{cite journal| last=Toporoski| first=Richard| title=The Invisible Crown| journal=Monarchy Canada| issue=Summer 1998| publisher=Monarchist League of Canada| location=Toronto| year=1998| url=http://www.monarchist.ca/mc/invisibl.htm| accessdate=16 May 2009| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080209220704/http://www.monarchist.ca/mc/invisibl.htm| archivedate=9 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Act of Settlement cannot be altered in any realm except by that realm's own parliament and, by [[Convention (norm)#Government|convention]], only with the consent of all the other realms, as it touches on the succession to the [[Commonwealth realm#The Crown in the Commonwealth realms|shared crown]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite legislation UK |type=act |year=1931 |chapter=4 |act=The Statute of Westminster 1931}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original documents are deposited in the Lower Saxon State Archives in Hanover, Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Lower Saxon State Archives, Hanover (HStAH), Cal. Or. 63, 1&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[Perth Agreement]] in 2011, legislation amending the act came into effect across the Commonwealth realms on 26 March 2015, and removed the disqualification arising from marriage to a Roman Catholic.

==Original context==
Following the [[Glorious Revolution]], the line of succession to the English throne was governed by the [[Bill of Rights 1689]], which declared that the flight of [[James II]] from England to France during the revolution amounted to an [[abdication]] of the throne and that James' daughter [[Mary II]] and her husband, [[William III of England|William III]] (who was also James' nephew),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.siena.edu/uploadedfiles/home/parents_and_community/community_page/sri/independent_research/Presidents%20Release_2010_final.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150707011431/http://www2.siena.edu/uploadedfiles/home/parents_and_community/community_page/sri/independent_research/Presidents%20Release_2010_final.pdf |archivedate= 7 July 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; were James' successors. The Bill of Rights also provided that the line of succession would go through their descendants, then through Mary's sister [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Anne]] and her descendants, and then to the issue of William III by a possible later marriage. During the debate, the House of Lords had attempted to append Sophia and her descendants to the line of succession, but the amendment failed in the Commons.&lt;ref name=melville&gt;{{cite book|last=Melville|first=Lewis|title=The First George in Hanover and England|year=1908|publisher=Isaac Pitman and Sons|location=London|pages=130–131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mary II died childless in 1694, after which William III did not remarry. In 1700, [[Prince William, Duke of Gloucester]], who was Anne's only child to survive infancy, died of a fever at the age of 11. Thus, Anne was left as the only person in line to the throne. The Bill of Rights excluded Catholics from the throne, which ruled out James II and his descendants. However, it did not provide for the further succession after Anne. Parliament thus saw the need to settle the succession on Sophia and her descendants, and thereby guarantee the continuity of the Crown in the Protestant line.

With religion and lineage initially decided, the ascendancy of William of Orange in 1689 would also bring his partiality to his foreign favourites that followed. By 1701 English jealousy of foreigners was rampant, and action was considered necessary for correction.&lt;ref name="Henriq"/&gt;

==Provisions==
The Act of Settlement provided that the throne would pass to the [[Sophia of Hanover|Electress Sophia of Hanover]]&amp;nbsp;– a granddaughter of [[James I of England|James VI and I]] and a niece of [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]]&amp;nbsp;– and her descendants, but it excluded "for ever" "all and every Person and Persons who ... is are or shall be reconciled to or shall hold Communion with the [[Holy See|See]] or [[Roman Catholic Church|Church of Rome]] or shall profess the Popish Religion or shall marry a Papist". Thus, those who were Roman Catholics, and those who married Roman Catholics, were barred from ascending the throne. Eight additional provisions of the act would only come into effect upon the death of both William and Anne:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bailii.org/uk/legis/num_act/1700/1565208.html |title=Act of Settlement 1700 |publisher=[[British and Irish Legal Information Institute|BAILII]] |accessdate=20 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The monarch "shall join in communion with the [[Church of England]]". This was intended to ensure the exclusion of a Roman Catholic monarch. Along with James II's perceived despotism, his religion was the main cause of the [[Glorious Revolution]] of 1688, and of the previous linked religious and succession problems which had been resolved by the joint monarchy of [[William III of England|William III]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary II]].
* If a person not native to England comes to the throne, England will not wage war for "any dominions or territories which do not belong to the Crown of England, without the consent of Parliament". This was far-sighted, because when a member of the [[House of Hanover]] ascended the British throne, he would retain the territories of the [[Kingdom of Hanover|Electorate of Hanover]] in what is now [[Lower Saxony]], then part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. This provision has been dormant since [[Queen Victoria]] ascended the throne, because she did not inherit Hanover under the [[Salic Law]]s of the German-speaking states.
* No monarch may leave "the dominions of [[Kingdom of England|England]], [[Kingdom of Scotland|Scotland]], or [[Kingdom of Ireland|Ireland]]", without the consent of Parliament. This provision was repealed in 1716, at the request of [[George I of Great Britain|George I]] who was also the [[prince-elector|Elector of Hanover]] and Duke of [[Brunswick-Lüneburg]] within the [[Holy Roman Empire]]; because of this, and also for personal reasons, he wished to visit Hanover from time to time.&lt;ref name=tarkowp547&gt;{{cite journal |last=Naamani Tarkow |first=I. |year=1943 |title= The Significance of the Act of Settlement in the Evolution of English Democracy |journal=Political Science Quarterly |volume=58 |issue=4 |pages=537–561 at p. 547 |doi=10.2307/2144947}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* All government matters within the jurisdiction of the [[Privy Council of England|Privy Council]] were to be transacted there, and all council resolutions were to be signed by those who advised and consented to them. This was because Parliament wanted to know who was deciding policies, as sometimes councillors' signatures normally attached to resolutions were absent. This provision was repealed early in Queen Anne's reign, as many councillors ceased to offer advice and some stopped attending meetings altogether.&lt;ref name=tarkowp547 /&gt;
* No foreigner ("no Person born out of the Kingdoms of England Scotland or Ireland or the Dominions thereunto belonging"), even if naturalised or made a [[Denization|denizen]] (unless born of English parents), can be a Privy Councillor or a member of either House of Parliament, or hold "any Office or Place of Trust, either Civill {{sic}} or Military, or to [''sic''] have any Grant of Lands, Tenements or Hereditaments from the Crown, to himself or to any other or others in Trust for him".&lt;ref name="Henriq"&gt;{{cite journal |first=H. S. |last=Henriques |jstor=1451130 |title=The Political Rights of English Jews |journal=[[The Jewish Quarterly Review]] |volume=19 |issue=2 |date=January 1907 |pages=311–312}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent nationality laws (today primarily the [[British Nationality Act 1981]]) made naturalised citizens the equal of those native born, but otherwise this provision still applies. It has however been disapplied in particular cases by a number of other statutes.
* No person who has an office under the monarch, or receives a pension from the Crown, was to be a Member of Parliament. This provision was inserted to avoid unwelcome royal influence over the House of Commons. It remains in force, but with several exceptions. (As a side effect, this provision means that members of the Commons seeking to resign from parliament can get round the age-old prohibition on [[Resignation from the British House of Commons|resignation]] by obtaining a [[sinecure]] in the control of the Crown; while several offices have historically been used for this purpose, two are currently in use: appointments generally alternate between the stewardships of the [[Stewardship of the Chiltern Hundreds|Chiltern Hundreds]] and of the [[Steward of the Manor of Northstead|Manor of Northstead]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/documents/upload/P11.pdf |work=House of Commons Information Office |title=The Chiltern Hundreds |date=1 June 2008 |accessdate=12 June 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081003101512/http://www.parliament.uk/documents/upload/P11.pdf |archivedate=3 October 2008 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;)
* Judges' commissions are valid ''quamdiu se bene gesserint'' (during good behaviour) and if they do not behave themselves, they can be removed only by both Houses of Parliament (or in other Commonwealth realms the one House of Parliament, depending on the legislature's structure.) This provision was the result of various monarchs influencing judges' decisions, and its purpose was to assure [[judicial independence]]. This [[letters patent|patent]] was used prior the 1701 but did not prevent [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] from removing [[John Walter (judge)|Sir John Walter]] as [[Chief Baron of the Exchequer]].
* That "no Pardon under the [[Great Seal of England]] be pleadable to an Impeachment by the Commons in Parliament". This meant in effect that no pardon by the monarch was to save someone from being [[Impeachment|impeached]] by the House of Commons.

==Effects==
{{refimprove section|date=January 2011}}
For different reasons, various [[constitutionalist]]s have praised the Act of Settlement: [[Henry Hallam]] called the Act "the seal of our constitutional laws" and [[David Lindsay Keir]] placed its importance above the Bill of Rights of 1689.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Tarkow, p. 537.&lt;/ref&gt; Naamani Tarkow has written: "If one is to make sweeping statements, one may say that, save [[Magna Carta]] (more truly, its implications), the Act of Settlement is probably the most significant statute in English history".&lt;ref&gt;Tarkow, p. 561.&lt;/ref&gt;{{explain|date=October 2015}}

===Kingdom of Great Britain===
[[Image:Act of Settlement 3323.jpg|thumb|right|Facsimile of the Act of Settlement sent to Electress Sophia of Hanover]]
[[Image:Kurfuerstin Sophie.JPG|thumb|right|''Sophia, Electress of Hanover'']]

The Act of Settlement was, in many ways, the major cause of the [[Acts of Union 1707|union]] of [[Scotland]] with [[England and Wales]] to form the [[Kingdom of Great Britain]]. The [[Parliament of Scotland]] was not happy with the Act of Settlement and, in response, passed the [[Act of Security]] in 1704, through which Scotland reserved the right to choose its own successor to [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]]. Stemming from this, the Parliament of England decided that, to ensure the stability and future prosperity of Great Britain, full union of the two parliaments and nations was essential before Anne's death.

It used a combination of exclusionary legislation (the [[Alien Act 1705]]), politics, and [[bribery]] to achieve this within three years under the [[Act of Union 1707]]. This success was in marked contrast to the four attempts at political union between 1606 and 1689, which all failed owing to a lack of political will in both kingdoms. By virtue of Article II of the [[Treaty of Union]], which defined the succession to the throne of Great Britain, the Act of Settlement became part of [[Scots Law]] as well.

===Succession to the Crown===
In addition to [[James II of England|James II]] (who died a few months after the act received royal assent) and his Roman Catholic children, [[James Francis Edward Stuart|Prince James]] and the [[Louisa Maria Teresa Stuart|Princess Royal]], the act also excluded the descendants of King James's sister, [[Princess Henrietta of England|Henrietta]], the youngest daughter of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]. Henrietta's daughter, [[Anne Marie d'Orléans|Anne]], was then the Queen of Sardinia and a Roman Catholic; [[Jacobite succession|Jacobite pretenders]] after 1807 are descended from her.

With the legitimate descendants of [[Charles I of England|Charles I]] either childless (in the case of [[William III of England|William III]] and [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Anne]]) or Roman Catholic, Parliament's choice was limited to the Protestant descendants of Sophia of Hanover, the daughter of the late [[Elizabeth of Bohemia]], who was the only other child of [[James I of England|King James I]] not to have died in childhood. Elizabeth had borne nine children who reached adulthood, of whom [[Sophia of Hanover|Sophia]] was the youngest daughter. However, in 1701, Sophia was the senior Protestant with a legitimate claim to the English throne; Parliament passed over senior living representatives of lines which included [[Elizabeth Charlotte, Princess Palatine|Elizabeth Charlotte, Duchess of Orléans]]; [[Louis Otto, Prince of Salm]], and his sisters; [[Anne Henriette of Bavaria|Anne Henriette, Princess of Condé]]; [[Benedicta Henrietta of the Palatinate|Benedicta Henrietta, Duchess of Brunswick-Lüneburg]]; and Sophia's sister, [[Louise Hollandine of the Palatinate]] because they were all Roman Catholic.

===Removal from the succession due to Catholicism===
Since the Act's passing the most senior living member of the Royal Family to have married a Roman Catholic, and thereby to have been removed from the line of succession, is [[Prince Michael of Kent]], who married [[Princess Michael of Kent|Baroness Marie-Christine von Reibnitz]] in 1978; he was fifteenth in the line of succession at the time. He was restored to the line of succession in 2015 when the [[Succession to the Crown Act 2013]] came into force, and became 34th in line.&lt;ref name=royalcentral&gt;{{cite web |url=http://royalcentral.co.uk/state/what-do-the-new-royal-succession-changes-mean-46610 |title=What do the new royal succession changes mean? |publisher=Royal Central |date=26 March 2015 |accessdate=30 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next most senior living descendant of the Electress Sophia who had been ineligible to succeed on this ground is [[George Windsor, Earl of St Andrews]], the elder son of [[Prince Edward, Duke of Kent]], who married the Roman Catholic [[Sylvana Windsor, Countess of St Andrews|Sylvana Palma Tomaselli]] in 1988. His son, [[Edward Windsor, Lord Downpatrick|Lord Downpatrick]], converted to Roman Catholicism in 2003 and is the most senior descendant of Sophia to be barred as a result of his religion. More recently, [[Peter Phillips]], the son of [[Anne, Princess Royal]], and eleventh in line to the throne, married [[Autumn Phillips|Autumn Kelly]]; Kelly had been brought up as a Roman Catholic, but she converted to [[Anglicanism]] prior to the wedding. Had she not done so, Phillips would have forfeited his place in the succession upon their marriage.

Excluding those princesses who have married into Roman Catholic royal families, such as [[Marie of Romania|Marie of Edinburgh]], [[Victoria Eugenie of Battenberg]] and [[Princess Beatrice of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Princess Beatrice of Edinburgh]], one member of the Royal Family (that is, with the style of ''[[Royal Highness]]'') has converted to Roman Catholicism since the passage of the Act: the [[Katharine, Duchess of Kent|Duchess of Kent]], wife of [[Prince Edward, Duke of Kent]] who converted on 14 January 1994, but her husband did not lose his place in the succession because she was an Anglican at the time of their marriage.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

==Present status==
As well as being part of the law of the United Kingdom, the Act of Settlement was received into the laws of all the countries and territories over which the British monarch reigned. It remains part of the laws of the 16 [[Commonwealth realm]]s and the relevant jurisdictions within those realms. In accordance with established convention, the [[Statute of Westminster 1931]] and later laws, the Act of Settlement (along with the other laws governing the succession of the Commonwealth realms) may only be changed with the agreement of all the realms (and, in some federal realms, the constituent members of those federations).

==Amendment proposals==
Challenges have been made against the Act of Settlement, especially its provisions regarding Roman Catholics and [[Primogeniture|preference for males]]. However, legislating for alterations to the Act is a complex process, since the Act is a common denominator in the shared succession of all the [[Commonwealth realm]]s. The [[Statute of Westminster 1931]] acknowledges by established convention that any changes to the rules of succession may be made only with the agreement of all of the states involved, with concurrent amendments to be made by each state's parliament or parliaments. Further, as the current monarch's eldest child and, in turn, his eldest child, are Anglican males, any change to the succession laws would have no immediate implications. Consequently, there was little public concern with the issues and debate had been confined largely to academic circles until, in November 2010, the announcement that [[Prince William, Duke of Cambridge|Prince William]] was [[Wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton|to marry]]. This raised the question of what would happen if he were to produce first a daughter and then a son.

''[[The Times]]'' reported on 6 November 1995 that [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]] had said on that day to [[Tony Blair]] and [[Paddy Ashdown]] that "Catholics should be able to ascend to the British throne". Ashdown claimed the Prince said: "I really can't think why we can't have Catholics on the throne".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last=| first=| title=Article| newspaper=The Times| date=6 November 1995| url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, during debate on a [[Royal Succession Bills and Acts|Succession to the Crown Bill]], Junior Home Office Minister [[Gareth Williams, Baron Williams of Mostyn|Lord Williams of Mostyn]] informed the [[House of Lords]] that the Queen had "no objection to the Government's view that in determining the line of succession to the throne, daughters and sons should be treated in the same way".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/politics/60808.stm |title=Queen backs historic change to who may rule |publisher=BBC News |date=27 February 1998 |accessdate=5 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
In October 2011 the [[Government of Australia|Australian federal government]] was reported to have reached an agreement with all of [[States and territories of Australia|the states]] on potential changes to their laws in the wake of amendments to the Act of Settlement.&lt;ref name=Coorey2011-10-29&gt;{{cite news| last=Coorey| first=Phillip| title=Leaders abandon rule on male heir succession| url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/leaders-abandon-rule-on-male-heir-succession-20111028-1mo9q.html| date=29 October 2011| newspaper=Sydney Morning Herald| accessdate=29 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice of the Australian states—for example, New South Wales and Victoria&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last=Elizabeth II| author-link=Elizabeth II| publication-date=1969| title=Imperial Acts Application Act 1969| series=6| publication-place=Sydney| publisher=New South Wales Government Printer| url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/iaaa1969240/| accessdate=30 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last=Elizabeth II| author-link=Elizabeth II| publication-date=1980| title=Imperial Acts Act 1980| series=6| publication-place=Melbourne| publisher=Government Printer| url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/vic/consol_act/iaaa1980240/| accessdate=30 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;—has been, when legislating to repeal some imperial statutes so far as they still applied in Australia, to provide that imperial statutes concerning the royal succession remain in force.

The legal process required at the federal level remains, theoretically, unclear. The [[Constitution of Australia|Australian constitution]], as was noted during the crisis of 1936, contains no power for the federal parliament to legislate with respect to the monarchy.&lt;ref name=Twomey&gt;[[#Twomey|Twomey]], pp. 8–9&lt;/ref&gt; Everything thus turns upon the status and meaning of clause 2 in the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900, which provides: "The provisions of this Act referring to the Queen shall extend to Her Majesty's heirs and successors in the sovereignty of the United Kingdom."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last=Victoria| author-link=Queen Victoria| publication-date=1901| title=Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900| series=2| publication-place=Westminster| publisher=Queen's Printer| url=http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2004C00469| accessdate=31 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anne Twomey reviews three possible interpretations of the clause.&lt;ref name=Twomey /&gt;
* First: it "mandates that whoever is the sovereign of the United Kingdom is also, by virtue of this external fact, sovereign of Australia"; accordingly, changes to British succession laws would have no effect on Australian law, but if the British amendment changed the sovereign, then the new sovereign of the United Kingdom would automatically become the new [[Monarchy of Australia|sovereign of Australia]].
* Second, it is "merely an interpretative provision", operating to ensure that references to "the Queen" in the Constitution are references to whoever may at the time be the incumbent of the "sovereignty of the United Kingdom" as determined with regard to Australia, following the [[Australia Act 1986]], by Australian law.
* Or, third, it incorporates the United Kingdom rules of succession into the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act, which itself can now be altered only by Australia, according to the [[Australia Act 1986]]; in that way, the British rules of succession have been patriated to Australia and, with regard to Australia, are subject to amendment or repeal solely by Australian law.
However, Twomey expresses confidence that, if the [[High Court of Australia]] were to be faced with the problems of covering clause 2, it would find some way to conclude that, with regard to Australia, the clause is subject solely to Australian law.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Twomey|Twomey]], pp. 14–16&lt;/ref&gt; Canadian scholar Richard Toporoski theorised in 1998 that "if, let us say, an alteration were to be made in the United Kingdom to the Act of Settlement 1701, providing for the succession of the Crown... [i]t is my opinion that the domestic constitutional law of Australia or Papua New Guinea, for example, would provide for the succession in those countries of the same person who became Sovereign of the United Kingdom."&lt;ref name=Topo /&gt;

In practice, when legislating for the Perth Agreement (see below), the Australian governments took the approach of the states requesting, and referring power to, the federal government to enact the legislation on behalf of the states (under paragraph 51(xxxviii) of the Australian Constitution) and the Commonwealth of Australia.

===Canada===
{{See also|Monarchy of Canada#Succession and regency}}

In [[Canada]], where the Act of Settlement ({{Lang-fr|Acte d'établissement}}) is now a part of [[Constitution of Canada|Canadian constitutional law]], [[Tony O'Donohue]], a Canadian civic politician, took issue with the provisions that exclude [[Roman Catholic]]s from the throne, and which make the [[monarchy of Canada|monarch of Canada]] the [[Supreme Governor of the Church of England]], requiring him or her to be an [[Church of England|Anglican]]. This, he claimed, discriminated against non-Anglicans, including Catholics, who are the largest faith group in Canada.&lt;ref name="Spector"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://members.shaw.ca/nspector3/globe302.htm |first=Norman |last=Spector |title=Why Canada must take on Britain over the 1701 Act of Settlement |date=30 August 2007 |newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]] |accessdate=29 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, O'Donohue launched [[O'Donohue v.

Also, the court noted that, while Canada has the power to amend the line of succession to the Canadian throne, the Statute of Westminster stipulates that the agreement of the governments of the fifteen other Commonwealth realms that share the Crown would first have to be sought if Canada wished to continue its relationship with these countries. An appeal of the decision was dismissed on 16 March 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CanLII |litigants=O'Donohue v. Canada |link=O'Donohue v.

With the announcement in 2007 of the [[engagement]] of [[Peter Phillips]] to [[Autumn Phillips|Autumn Kelly]], a Roman Catholic and a Canadian, discussion about the Act of Settlement was revived. [[Norman Spector]] called in ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' for [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Stephen Harper]] to address the issue of the act's bar on Catholics, saying Phillips' marriage to Kelly would be the first time the provisions of the act would bear directly on Canada—Phillips would be barred from acceding to the Canadian throne because he married a Roman Catholic Canadian.&lt;ref name=Spector/&gt; (In fact, [[George Windsor, Earl of St Andrews|the Earl of St Andrews]] had already lost his place in the line of succession when he married the Roman Catholic Canadian [[Sylvana Windsor, Countess of St Andrews|Sylvana Palma Tomaselli]] in 1988. But St Andrews' place in the line of succession was significantly lower than Phillips'.) Criticism of the Act of Settlement due to the Phillips–Kelly marriage was muted when Autumn Kelly converted to Anglicanism shortly before her marriage, thus preserving her husband's place in the line of succession.

===United Kingdom===
{{See also|Succession to the British throne#Reform}}

From time to time there has been debate over repealing the clause that prevents Roman Catholics, or those who marry one, from ascending to the British throne. Proponents of repeal argue that the clause is a bigoted [[anachronism]]; [[Thomas Winning|Cardinal Winning]], who was leader of the Roman Catholic Church in [[Scotland]], called the act an "insult" to Catholics. [[Cormac Murphy-O'Connor|Cardinal Murphy-O'Connor]], the leader of the Roman Catholic Church in England, pointed out that Prince William (later the Duke of Cambridge) "can marry by law a [[Hindu]], a [[Buddhist]], anyone, but not a Roman Catholic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/2021615.stm |work=[[BBC News Online]] |title=Let monarchy marry Catholics |date=2 June 2002 |accessdate=30 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents of repeal, such as [[Enoch Powell]] and [[Adrian Hilton]], believe that it would lead to the disestablishment of the Church of England as the state religion if a Roman Catholic were to come to the throne. They also note that the monarch must swear to defend the faith and be a member of the [[Anglican Communion]], but that a Roman Catholic monarch would, like all Roman Catholics, owe allegiance to the Pope. This would, according to opponents of repeal, amount to a loss of [[sovereignty]] for the Anglican Church.

When in December 1978 there was media speculation that [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince Charles]] might marry a Roman Catholic, Powell defended the provision that excludes Roman Catholics from ascending the throne, claiming his objection was not rooted in religious bigotry but in political considerations. He stated a Roman Catholic monarch would mean the acceptance of a source of authority external to the realm and "in the literal sense, foreign to the [[Queen-in-Parliament|Crown-in-Parliament]] ... Between Roman Catholicism and [[royal supremacy]] there is, as St [[Thomas More]] concluded, no reconciliation". Powell concluded that a Roman Catholic crown would be the destruction of the Church of England because "it would contradict the essential character of that church".

He continued:
&lt;blockquote&gt;When [[Thomas Hobbes]] wrote that "the Papacy is no other than the ghost of the deceased [[Roman Empire]] sitting crowned upon the grave thereof", he was promulgating an enormously important truth. Authority in the Roman Church is the exertion of that ''imperium'' from which England in the 16th century finally and decisively declared its national independence as the ''alter imperium'', the "other empire", of which [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] declared "This realm of England is an empire" ... It would signal the beginning of the end of the British monarchy. It would portend the eventual surrender of everything that has made us, and keeps us still, a nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=[[Like the Roman: The Life of Enoch Powell]] |last=Heffer |first=Simon |authorlink=Simon Heffer |year=1999 |publisher=Phoenix Giant |location=London |isbn=0-7538-0820-X |page= |pages=810–812}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Scottish Parliament]] unanimously passed a motion in 1999 calling for the complete removal of any discrimination linked to the monarchy and the repeal of the Act of Settlement.&lt;ref name=Scotsman2011&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/uk/catholics_still_barred_from_throne_despite_law_change_1_1937348 |title=Catholics still barred from throne despite law change |date=28 October 2011 |newspaper=[[The Scotsman]] |accessdate=29 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, ''[[The Guardian]]'' challenged the succession law in court,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/dec/06/monarchy.claredyer |last=Dyer |first=Clare |title=A Challenge to the Crown: now is the time for change |date=6 December 2000 |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=16 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; claiming that it violated the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], which provides,
&lt;blockquote&gt;The enjoyment of the rights and freedoms set forth in this Convention shall be secured without discrimination on any ground such as sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth or other status.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

As the Convention nowhere lists the right to succeed to the Crown as a human right, the challenge was rejected.

[[Adrian Hilton]], writing in ''[[The Spectator]]'' in 2003, defended the Act of Settlement as not "irrational prejudice or blind bigotry", but claimed that it was passed because "the nation had learnt that when a Roman Catholic monarch is upon the throne, religious and civil liberty is lost". He points to the Pope's claiming universal jurisdiction, and Hilton argues that "it would be intolerable to have, as the sovereign of a Protestant and free country, one who owes any allegiance to the head of any other state" and contends that, if such situation came about, "we will have undone centuries of common law". He said that because the Roman Catholic Church [[apostolicae curae|does not recognise]] the Church of England as an apostolic church, a Roman Catholic monarch who abided by their faith's doctrine would be obliged to view Anglican and [[Church of Scotland]] archbishops, bishops, and clergy as part of the [[laity]] and therefore "lacking the ordained authority to preach and celebrate the sacraments". (Hilton noted that the Church of Scotland's [[Presbyterian polity]] does not include bishops or archbishops.) Hilton said a Roman Catholic monarch would be unable to be crowned by the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] and notes that other European states have similar religious provisions for their monarchs: [[Denmark]], [[Norway]], and [[Sweden]], whose constitutions compel their monarchs to be [[Lutheranism|Lutherans]]; the [[Netherlands]], which has a constitution requiring its monarchs be members of the Protestant [[House of Orange]]; and [[Belgium]], which has a constitution that provides for the succession to be through Roman Catholic houses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3724/is_200311/ai_n9341744 |last=Hilton |first=Adrian |title=The price of liberty |newspaper=[[The Spectator]] |date=8 November 2003 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070604070506/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qa3724/is_200311/ai_n9341744 |archivedate= 4 June 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2004, a private member's bill—the [[Succession to the Crown Bill 2004|Succession to the Crown Bill]]—was introduced in the House of Lords. The government, headed by [[Tony Blair]], blocked all attempts to revise the succession laws, claiming it would raise too many constitutional issues and it was unnecessary at the time. In the [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|British general election]] the following year, [[Michael Howard]] promised to work towards having the prohibition removed if the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] gained a majority of seats in the House of Commons, but the election was won by Blair's [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]. Four years later, plans drawn up by [[Chris Bryant]] were revealed that would end the exclusion of Catholics from the throne and end the doctrine of agnatic (male-preference) [[primogeniture]] in favour of absolute primogeniture, which governs succession solely on birth order and not on sex.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/sep/25/anglicanism.catholicism1| last=Wintour| first=Patrick| title=End of the Anglican crown – 300 year bar to be lifted| date=25 September 2008| newspaper=The Guardian| accessdate=25 September 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080926085427/http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2008/sep/25/anglicanism.catholicism1| archivedate= 26 September 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; The issue was raised again in January 2009, when a private members bill to amend the Act of Succession was introduced in parliament.

===Across the realms===
{{main article|Perth Agreement}}
In early 2011 [[Keith Vaz]], a [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] Member of Parliament, introduced to the House of Commons at Westminster a [[private member's bill]] which proposed that the Act of Settlement be amended to remove the provisions relating to Roman Catholicism and change the primogeniture governing the line of succession to the British throne from [[agnatic primogeniture|agnatic]] to [[Absolute cognatic primogeniture|absolute cognatic]]. Vaz sought support for his project from the Canadian Cabinet and [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Stephen Harper]], but the [[Office of the Prime Minister (Canada)|Office of the Prime Minister of Canada]] responded that the issue was "not a priority for the government or for Canadians without further elaboration on the merits or drawbacks of the proposed reforms". [[Stephenson King]], [[List of Prime Ministers of Saint Lucia|Prime Minister of Saint Lucia]], said he supported the idea and it was reported that the government of New Zealand did, as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Cecil |first=Nicholas |title=St Lucia backs change to laws of succession |newspaper=London Evening Standard |date=8 March 2011 |url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23929938-st-lucia-backs-change-to-laws-of-succession.do |accessdate=14 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110528094354/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23929938-st-lucia-backs-change-to-laws-of-succession.do |archivedate=28 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Monarchist League of Canada]] said at the time to the media that it "supports amending the Act of Settlement in order to modernize the succession rules".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last=Boswell| first=Randy| title=Brit asks Canada for help rewriting the rules of the Crown| newspaper=Vancouver Sun| date=21 January 2011| url=https://vancouversun.com/life/Brit+asks+Canada+help+rewriting+rules+Crown/4146719/story.html| accessdate=22 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aggressive panhandling''' is a legal term for unlawful forms of public [[begging]]. Proponents of such legislation advocate placing limits on these activities. Some opponents lament what they perceive to be the "[[criminalization of homelessness]]" and argue that such laws are discriminatory and unevenly enforced.

==Description==

In general, ''aggressive panhandling'' is a solicitation made in person for immediate donation of money or other gratuity. This may be done by vocal appeal (asking, requesting, coercing (badgering), sympathy appeals, harassment, threats, or demands) or by nonvocal appeal (usage of signs or other signals gestures, postures, children, animals, or props such as toys and musical instruments). It is a habitual manipulative, coercive, or intimidatory use of another individual's sympathy, fear, guilt, or insecurity for monetary gain.

== Aggressive panhandling as a social problem ==
Helen Hershkoff claims legal restrictions on panhandlers' activities are "unconstitutionally vague, overbroad and deprive the homeless of their right to free speech".&lt;ref name="popcenter"&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Hershkoff|first1=Helen|last2=Conner|first2=Roger|title=Aggressive panhandling laws| journal=ABA Journal| date=June 1993|volume=79|pages=40–41|url=http://www.popcenter.org/problems/panhandling/PDFs/Hershkoff_Conner_1993.pdf|accessdate=23 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, Roger Conner asserts that "Aggressive begging is not common panhandling. It is uncommon panhandling, a type of harassment bordering on extortion that is practiced by a minority of street people."&lt;ref name="popcenter" /&gt;

== Aggressive panhandling in US law ==
The definition of aggressive panhandling is given by city and county [[local ordinance|ordinance]]s as well as state [[statutes]].

For example, according to the [[Bloomington, Indiana]] website, panhandling is "a growing social and public safety concern faced by cities of all sizes, including Bloomington. Many panhandlers passively ask for money or hold a sign. Others are much more aggressive, making noise, sometimes repeated demands and choose to solicit in places that are particularly intimidating such as near automated teller machines, in a restroom or near your car. This is considered aggressive panhandling and in Indiana it is against the law."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://bloomington.in.gov/sections/viewSection.php?section_id=571 | accessdate=2013-06-17 | title=Bloomington, Indiana Website}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Constitutional lawyers, including but not limited to the [[American Civil Liberties Union]], have secured a series of court decisions confirming their view that the First Amendment of the United States Constitution protects activities which some local ordinances have attempted to proscribe as illegal panhandling. In response, many jurisdictions have responded by narrowing the definition of illegal panhandling. The generally accepted terminology is to denominate such activity as aggressive panhandling.

In 1991 and 1992, federal courts overturned New York and California state laws that made aggressive panhandling illegal. It was observed that "Groups and individuals all over the United States engage in highly public fundraising for all sorts of causes and charities."{{fact|date=August 2018}}

Restrictions defining solicitation or panhandling as aggressive regard both manner and context. A typical ordinance is one from [[Longview, Washington]]:

9.23.030 Place of panhandling – Violation. 
It shall be unlawful for any person to panhandle when the person solicited is in any of the following places within the city limits of Longview, Washington:
# At any bus stop; or
# In any public transportation vehicle or facility; or
# In any vehicle on a street or on a driveway providing ingress or egress to a street where such driveway is open to the general public; or
# Within 50 feet of any automated teller machine (ATM); or
# On private property, unless the panhandler is in physical possession of written permission from the owner or lawful occupant thereof. (Ord. 3051 § 2, 2008).

9.23.040 Manner of panhandling – Violation. 
It shall be unlawful for any person to panhandle in any of the following manners:
# By intentionally coming within three feet of the person solicited, unless that person has indicated that he or she does wish to make a donation; or
# By intentionally obstructing the path of the person or vehicle of the person solicited; or
# By intentionally obstructing the passage through the entrance or exit of any building; or
# By soliciting anyone under the age of 16; or
# By following a person who walks away from the panhandler, if the panhandler’s conduct is intended to or is reasonably likely to intimidate the person being solicited into responding affirmatively to the solicitation; or
# By using profane or abusive language, either during the solicitation or following a refusal. (Ord. 3051 § 2, 2008).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.codepublishing.com/wa/longview/html/Longview09/Longview0923.html | publisher=CodePublishing.com | title=Longview Panhandling Code on Code Publishing.com | accessdate=2013-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Panhandling constrictions==

===Canada===
The province of [[Ontario]] introduced its [[Safe Streets Act]] in 1999 to restrict specific kinds of begging, particularly certain narrowly defined cases of "aggressive" or abusive panhandling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/DBLaws/Statutes/English/99s08_e.htm |publisher=Government of Ontario |title=Safe Streets Act |year=1999 |accessdate=2006-09-29 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060902063618/http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/DBLaws/Statutes/English/99s08_e.htm |archivedate=2006-09-02 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001 this law survived a court challenge under the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2001/08/03/squeegee_010803.html | accessdate=2006-09-29 | title='Squeegee kids' law upheld in Ontario | publisher=CBC News | date=2001-08-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The law was further upheld by the [[Court of Appeal for Ontario]] in January 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/story/2007/01/17/tor-squeegee.html | accessdate=2007-03-19 | title=Squeegee panhandling washed out by Ontario Appeal Court | publisher=CBC News | date=2007-01-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Finland===
Solicitation of money on the street has been legal in Finland since at least 1987, when the [[Poor Law]] was invalidated. In 2003, the Public Order Act replaced any local government rules and completely decriminalized begging.

===France===
By law n° 2003-239 of 18 March 2003, "aggressive begging" (''mendicité agressive''), i. e. soliciting others to hand over of money, valuables or any property on a public thoroughfare in a group in an aggressive manner, or with the threat of a dangerous animal, is punished by up to six months' imprisonment and by a fine up to €3750.&lt;ref&gt;French [[penal code]], [https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCode.do?idSectionTA=LEGISCTA000006165329&amp;cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006070719&amp;dateTexte=20161012 article 312-12-1].&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Africa===
Begging on street corners is illegal in South Africa although not enforced.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.info.gov.za/view/DownloadFileAction?id=89953 info.gov.za] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328122551/http://www.info.gov.za/view/DownloadFileAction?id=89953 |date=March 28, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
Although begging is illegal, it does not carry a jail sentence under the Vagrancy Act of 1824. However, individual aggressive beggars may be subject to court injunction&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1439443/Beggar-ban-may-spark-nationwide-crackdown.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Nigel | last=Bunyan | title=Beggar ban may spark nationwide crackdown | date=2003-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and jail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1438578/Council-in-legal-move-to-jail-60-a-day-beggar.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | first=Paul | last=Stokes |title=Council in legal move to jail £60-a-day beggar | date=2003-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
In 2004, the city of [[Orlando, Florida]] passed an ordinance (Orlando Municipal Code section 43.86) requiring panhandlers to obtain a permit from the municipal police department. The ordinance further makes it a crime to panhandle in the commercial core of downtown Orlando, as well as within 50 feet of any bank or automated teller machine. It is also considered a crime in Orlando for panhandlers to make false or untrue statements, or to disguise themselves, to solicit money, and to use money obtained for a claim of a specific purpose (e.g. food) to be spent on anything else (e.g. malt liquor).

The Atlanta, Georgia, city council approved a ban on panhandling.

The '''''American Free Press''''' is a weekly [[newspaper]] published in the [[United States]].

The newspaper's direct ancestor was ''[[The Spotlight]]'', which ceased publication in 2001 when its parent organization, [[Liberty Lobby]], was forced into [[bankruptcy]]. One of the paper's founders was [[Willis Carto]], an influential [[White supremacy|white supremacist]] who promoted [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] and [[Holocaust denial]].

==History==
''American Free Press'' was founded by [[Willis Carto]]. Carto was most politically involved in his career throughout the 1960s. He is notorious for his extremist ideologies in white supremacist and anti-semitic movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Willis Carto|url=https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/individual/willis-carto|website=Southern Poverty Law Center|publisher=Southern Poverty Law Center|accessdate=8 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Aaronovitch"&gt;{{cite book |last=Aaronovitch |first=David |author-link=David Aaronovitch |date=2010 |chapter= |chapterurl= |title=Voodoo Histories: The Role of the Conspiracy Theory in Shaping Modern History |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0t7lC3nmFq8C&amp;lpg=PT205&amp;dq=%22American%20Free%20Press%22%20Carto&amp;pg=PT205#v=onepage&amp;q=Willis%20Carto&amp;f=false |location= |publisher=Riverhead Books |page= |isbn=9781101185216 |access-date=July 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Contributors ==

Writers for the newspaper included [[Michael Collins Piper]], whose work has been characterized as anti-semitic&lt;ref&gt;Bettinger, Keith. [http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Southeast_Asia/FK30Ae01.html "Anti-Semitism Peddled in Southeast Asia"]. ''[[Asia Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[James P. Tucker, Jr.]], a longtime ''Spotlight'' reporter whose focus was the [[Bilderberg Group]].  Articles by Carto also appeared occasionally. [[James Edwards (radio host)|James Edwards]], who now hosts ''[[The Political Cesspool]]'' (broadcast as a service of the neo-Nazi [[Stormfront (website)|Stormfront]]) was also a former writer for the newspaper.

The newspaper also runs columns by [[Joe Sobran]], [[James Traficant]], [[Paul Craig Roberts]], [[Ron Paul]], and others.  The newspaper's [[podcast]] series has featured mainstream guests including [[Brian Baird]], [[Philip Giraldi]], [[Dean Baker]], and others.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3978">The '''Arab Charter on Human Rights''' ('''ACHR'''), adopted by the Council of the [[League of Arab States]] on 22 May 2004, affirms the principles contained in the [[UN Charter]], the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], the [[International Covenants on Human Rights]] and the [[Cairo Declaration on Human Rights in Islam]]. It provides for a number of traditional human rights, including the right to liberty and security of persons, equality of persons before the law, protection of persons from torture, the right to own private property, freedom to practice religious observance and freedom of peaceful assembly and association.  The Charter also provides for the election of a seven-person Committee of Experts on Human Rights to consider states' reports.

A first version of the Charter was created on 15 September 1994, but no state ratified it. The updated (2004) version of the Charter came into force in 2008 after seven of the members of the League of Arab States had ratified it.

On 24 January 2008, then UN High Commissioner for Human Rights [[Louise Arbour]] said the Arab charter was incompatible with the UN's understanding of [[universal human rights]], including with respect to women's rights and capital punishment for children, in addition to other provisions in the Charter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://iheu.org/arab-charter-human-rights-incompatible-international-standards-louise-arbour/ The Arab Charter on Human Rights is incompatible with international standards – Louise Arbour]&lt;/ref&gt; The charter is listed on the website of her office, among texts adopted by international groups aimed at promoting and consolidating democracy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/compilation_democracy/arabcharter.htm www.ohchr.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of | 2013 | November}} the Charter had been ratified by [[Algeria]], [[Bahrain]], [[Iraq]], [[Jordan]], [[Kuwait]], [[Lebanon]], [[Libya]], [[State of Palestine|Palestine]], [[Qatar]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Syria]], the [[UAE]] and [[Yemen]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lasportal.org/wps/portal/las_ar_humanrights/inpage/!ut/p/c5/vc_PCoJAEAbwZ_EBYnZlcfFopLauWupmtpcwCMn1T2CY-fQZdLWTNHOYwwffjwEJ0zZ5fyvyx61t8goykMYZ4VgcuIuRSzZrxGjEdSNlAfJ0OEKGyDkpX3c2qjEu0eAJhXeiPDwDWyFRpvvQj1mnXmNit0Mo2NjRmAXC4bgzcepEtrXnNPCVBh7IomovH3UzFctftCDffGYsBOG2ra9wAklnW0IKYsEHfloO-aNlLGrd67422crtp1tYmvYGVgQiMQ!!/dl3/d3/L2dBISEvZ0FBIS9nQSEh/?pcid=dcecce004a3e7a18b9f8bd526698d42c]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.rian.ru/world/20120401/172528299.html Arab League Urges Egypt to Join Arab Charter on Human Rights]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Aztec Land and Cattle Company, Limited''' ("Aztec") is a land company with a historic presence in [[Arizona]]. It was formed in 1884 and incorporated in early 1885 as a [[cattle]] [[ranch]]ing operation that purchased 1,000,000 acres in northern Arizona from the [[Atlantic and Pacific Railroad|Atlantic &amp; Pacific Railroad]]. It then imported approximately 32,000 head of cattle from Texas and commenced ranching operations in Arizona. Because Aztec's [[Livestock branding|brand]] was the Hashknife, a saddler's knife used on early day ranches, the company was known more famously as '''The Hashknife Outfit'''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Hashknife: The Early Days of the Aztec Land and Cattle Company, Limited|last=Carlock|first=Robert H.|publisher=Westernlore Press|year=1994|isbn=978-0870260872|location=Tucson, Arizona|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company has been in continuous existence since 1884.

==History==

===Foundation===
Aztec was incorporated in [[New York City|New York]], [[New York (state)|New York]] in 1885 by a group of investors led by Edward Kinsley, a wool merchant and member of the State Board of Railroad Commissioners of Massachusetts, and Henry Warren, a former lieutenant in the [[Union Army|Union army]] with some, albeit limited, ranching experience.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The investors were hoping to take advantage of the recent drop in cattle prices. In the early 1880s, [[drought]] had become a serious problem to ranchers in [[Texas]]. To recoup their investment, many of these ranchers left their cattle herds intact during the dry times with the intention of selling off the cattle when the market was better, which resulted in [[overgrazing]]. By 1885, the beef industry had collapsed because thousands of cattle in west Texas, held off the market for better prices, were either dead or starving on barren plains. Separately, the Atlantic &amp; Pacific Railroad was having financial difficulties and sold 1,000,000 acres of Arizona grassland to Aztec at $0.50 per acre. Aztec then entered a joint venture with the Continental Cattle Company of Texas and began exporting droughted-out cattle from Continental's Texas range to Arizona via [[Stock car (rail)|rail]] and traditional [[Cattle drives in the United States|cattle drives]]. The original Aztec headquarters was located across the [[Little Colorado River]] from Saint Joseph, Arizona (now [[Joseph City, Arizona|Joseph City]]), but was moved to [[Holbrook, Arizona|Holbrook]], Arizona shortly afterward.
[[File:Aztec Brand.jpg|thumb|Hashknife Brand]]
In addition to the cattle, Aztec acquired one of Continental's brands, the Hashknife, because the cattle it imported from Texas were already branded with it. In these new and unsettled Western ranches, it was especially important for cattle to be branded to prove ownership and minimize theft, which was common and at times rampant. The Hashknife brand was registered in Arizona, as it was in Texas, and placed, after 1895, on the left rib of cattle and left shoulder of horses. For both cattle and horses, the blade faced up.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.legendsofamerica.com/az-hashknife.html|title=The Hashknife Outfit of the Aztec Cattle Company|website=www.legendsofamerica.com|access-date=2017-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vandevertranch.org/hashknife_brand.html|title=The Hashknife Brand|website=www.vandevertranch.org|access-date=2017-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the original Hashknife cowboys also came west to work the new ranch in Arizona, among them, according to Aztec's records, a cowboy known only as "Baconrind Bill".

===Sheep Wars and Future Leaders===
Several of Aztec's early employees were Texas cowboys whose abilities made them legends among their fellow ranchers during their years in Arizona. Some were involved in Arizona's [[Pleasant Valley War]] in the late 1880s and early 1890s, a decade-long feud between cattlemen and sheep herders over rangeland and resources that took place, in part, on Aztec land. A few were killed in that war, but a number went on to become local, state, and national leaders of some repute. Among these, E J Simpson, one of the Aztec's earliest ranch superintendents and member of the Arizona Territory Legislature had a son in this time frame, William Hood Simpson, who became the commander of the [[Ninth United States Army|9th Army]] in [[Europe]] during the worst fighting of [[World War II]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Little War of Our Own: The Pleasant Valley Feud Revisited|last=Derdera|first=Don|publisher=Northland Press|year=1987|isbn=978-0873584548|location=Flagstaff, Arizona|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another former employee, and son of an Aztec stockholder, Henry M. Atkinson, later founded [[Georgia Power]] in Atlanta in 1902, which is now a subsidiary of the [[Southern Company]], an electrical utility in the southeast U.S.&lt;ref&gt;Corporate records – 100th Anniversary of Georgia Power, a Southern Company&lt;/ref&gt;

== Present ==

=== Change of Strategy ===
Aztec continued ranching until about 1905, when after years of drought, harsh winters and low cattle prices, the company sold its cattle. Robert H. Carlock, a long-time principal in Aztec and author of Aztec's most comprehensive history, summarized both Aztec's initial business strategy and the cause of its troubles: [[File:Hashknife cowboys Holbrook Arizona circa 1900.jpg|200px|thumb|Hashknife cowboys in Holbrook, {{circa}}1900.]]

{{cquote
|Cattle were supposed to generate the cash flow that would be paid to the stockholders as dividends. The land would be there…to secure the loans and expenses until the cattle could carry it. But the cattle never made it.}}After selling its cattle, Aztec embarked on a program of leasing its grazing land to local cattle ranchers—a program that continues to this day. Many of the company's current grazing lessees are direct descendants of its original lessees.

As of 2017, Aztec and its affiliates own approximately 240,000 acres in [[Navajo County, Arizona|Navajo County]], Arizona and 320,000 acres of [[mineral rights]] (some without surface ownership) in Navajo and [[Coconino County, Arizona|Coconino]] Counties. It is the second largest private landowner in Arizona and holds one of the few remaining large-scale tracts of rural private land available for development in the state. As Robert H. Carlock observed, "Aztec's land has changed little in the past century. When traveling between [[Winslow, Arizona|Winslow]] and [[Flagstaff, Arizona|Flagstaff]] on [[Interstate 40|I-40]], if one looks south some forty or fifty miles, the thin blue line of the [[Mogollon Rim|[Mogollon] Rim]], still the southern boundary of Aztec's vast acreage, can be seen."

Aztec, with a partner, also owns the [[Apache Railway]], a Class III [[Shortline railroad|short-line railroad]] running for 55 miles off the [[BNSF Railway|BNSF Railway's]] transcontinental mainline near Holbrook, Arizona. The Apache Railway serves much of Aztec's land, providing access to both national and international markets, and has operated continuously since its incorporation in 1917.

==Career==
===1986–1992: Early career===
In 1986, Clem worked as a bouncer and driver at Jubilation nightclub where he would pick up radio DJ "Scary" Kerry Grey, of whom he was a fan, to the club and noticed people gravitating towards him.&lt;ref name=HAPPENED2018/&gt;&lt;ref name=ALLACCESS2010&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.allaccess.com/power-player/archive/5871/bubba-the-love-sponge-sup-tm-sup|title=Power Player – Bubba The Love Sponge&lt;sup&gt;TM&lt;/sup&gt;|publisher=All Access Music Group|date=February 9, 2010|accessdate=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grey then organised for Clem to work an on-air shift as an [[April Fool's Day]] joke on April 1, 1986 at [[WPFR-FM|WPFR]] in Terre Haute as Rockin' Bubba Clem, a name that someone else had suggested.&lt;ref name=HAPPENED2018/&gt;&lt;ref name=TBT19990512/&gt;&lt;ref name=ALLACCESS2016&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.allaccess.com/net-news/archive/story/151449/a-gofundme-page-has-been-set-up-to-help-kerry-gray|title=A GoFundMe Page Has Been Set Up To Help Kerry Gray|publisher=All Access Music Group|date=March 11, 2016|accessdate=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clem then became Grey's intern, making studio visits, answering phone calls, and sitting in on the show. Clem accepted a position hosting weekends soon after, and began a part-time midday shift starting on Christmas Day in 1986. He later became the station's managing director.&lt;ref name=ALLACCESS2010/&gt; At a fraternity party Grey called Clem a "love sponge" from witnessing the female attention Clem received, which eventually became his moniker.&lt;ref name=HAPPENED2018/&gt;&lt;ref name=PODCAST2015/&gt;

After WPFR, Clem had a stint at [[WGRD]] in [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]], where he learned to become more himself on the air.&lt;ref name=PODCAST2015&gt;{{cite web|url=https://jacobsmedia.com/worldwide-radio-summit-podcast-syndicated-morning-radio-host-bubba-love-sponge/|title=Podcast Interview: Radio Host Bubba the Love Sponge|date=17 November 2015|publisher=Jacobs Media|first=Seth|last=Resler|accessdate=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was fired on December 21, 1988 after a 13-year-old girl had called into his show the day before, during which Clem made sexual remarks about her and competing radio host Danny Czekalinski.&lt;ref&gt;''The Grand Rapids Press'', December 16, 1988&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Grand Rapids Press'', December 22, 1988&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, Clem had landed a spot at [[KTFM]] in San Antonio, Texas, where he was encouraged to trademark his air name and borrowed $5,000 from his parents to file a federal trademark for "Bubba the Love Sponge".&lt;ref name=ALLACCESS2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=HAPPENED2018/&gt; He then worked evenings at [[WBBM-FM|WBBM]] in Chicago, followed by a stint at [[WIOQ]] in Philadelphia from March to June 1990. The station let him go as management thought his style was not what they were looking for.&lt;ref name=WLS/&gt; Clem took legal action, and received $75,000 from the station.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|url=https://newspapers.com/image/176378449/|title=A major-league lineup for AM listeners|first=Kevin L.|last=Carter|page=6-E|newspaper=The Philadelphia Inquirer|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|subscription=yes|accessdate=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|url=https://newspapers.com/image/174773205/|title=A move to New York for WCAU manager?|first=Joe|last=Logan|page=6-D|date=18 June 1990|newspaper=The Philadelphia Inquirer|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1992–1996: WFLZ Tampa===
In September 1992, Clem started to work nights at [[WFLZ-FM|WFLZ]] in [[Tampa, Florida]] from 7–11 p.m., where his show gained popularity from listeners, particularly teenagers.&lt;ref name=TAMPA93/&gt;&lt;ref name=TBT19990512/&gt;&lt;ref name=HAPPENED2018/&gt;&lt;ref name=TBT1996/&gt; His first major contract signed during this time was worth $100,000 a year.&lt;ref name=HAPPENED2018/&gt; Clem and WFLZ host Tom Steele were temporarily suspended to settle legal issues from their ongoing on-air feud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|url=https://newspapers.com/image/323693216/|title=Radio personalities taken off the air|date=25 June 1993|newspaper=Tampa Bay Times|page=8|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clem became involved in various business ventures. In December 1994, he invested $50,000 to open Sponges, an alcohol free nightclub for teenagers in [[Largo, Florida]]. He opened a second Sponges in Spring Hill in 1995. There, he performed with his rap band Boyz Wit Da Bass.&lt;ref name=TBTT1995&gt;{{cite newspaper|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/325265040/|title=Bubba won't sponge up their business|newspaper=Tampa Bay Times|date=12 May 1995|first=Phyllis|last=Lipinski|page=10|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the other businesses Clem was involved in during this time were an endorsement deal with an Isuzu car dealership, the Bubba the Love Sponge Limousines service, a personalised paging service called the Air Bubba Beeping Network, and a premium rate telephone line.&lt;ref name=TBTT1995/&gt;&lt;ref name=TBT19950123&gt;{{cite newspaper|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/324513442|title=Because He's Cool|date=23 January 1995|first=Monica|last=Yant|pages=12–13, 15|newspaper=The Tampa Tribune|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1995, Clem released an adult-oriented home video ''Let Your Chia Run Wild'', described as a "private collection of events documenting a lifestyle that some can only dream of", and features some nudity.&lt;ref name=TBT19951130&gt;{{cite newspaper|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/340550509/|title=Steamy 'adult' video has Bubba under fire|date=30 November 1995|first=Jennifer|last=Barrs|page=6|newspaper=The Tampa Tribune|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clem regretted his decision to release it, and WFLZ requested for Clem to cease its distribution.&lt;ref name=TBT19951130/&gt; In April 1996, he opened Bubba's Beach Club, a dance club and nightspot in [[Ybor City]].&lt;ref name=TBT19950425&gt;{{cite newspaper|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/340364038/|title=Bubba in his element at Ybor City club opening|date=25 April 1996|page=4|newspaper=The Tampa Tribune|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1996, Clem had enough of the night shift and quit WFLZ.&lt;ref name=TBT1996&gt;{{cite newspaper|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/340279324/|title=Bubba to return on 98 Rock|date=26 November 1996|first=Rick|last=Harmon|page=16|newspaper=The Tampa Tribune|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|accessdate=28 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1996–2004: WXTB Tampa===
Clem decided to remain in Tampa, partly due to the fact that he had other business ventures in the area. He started a morning show at [[WXTB]] in December 1996,&lt;ref name=TBT1996/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.radioyears.com/other/details.cfm?id=881 | title=WXTB - A History | publisher=Radio Years}}&lt;/ref&gt; and continued to host a pre-recorded show that was then nationally syndicated in six other cities, including Cincinnati, Toledo, Columbis, Louisville, Atlanta, and Jacksonville.&lt;ref name=TBT1996/&gt;

In June 1997, [[Jacor Communications|Jacor Broadcasting]] was fined $4,000 for the airing of Clem's discussions on having sex with a lesbian couple on February 25.&lt;ref name=FINESLIST&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/business/graphics/web-fcc970.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111016035918/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/business/graphics/web-fcc970.html|archivedate=16 October 2011|title= FCC Indecency Fines, 1970–2004|accessdate=November 12, 2009|first=Ahrens |last=Frank|work=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1998, [[Taft Broadcasting|Citicasters]], the owner of WXTB, was fined $23,000 for various broadcasts, including one from May 1997 that included talk about one of the crew describing their enema experience, and another for a song parody about the [[Hillary Clinton]] and [[Monica Lewinsky]] scandal.&lt;ref name=TBT19990512/&gt;&lt;ref name=FINESLIST/&gt; This was followed by a $4,000 fine for a June 12, 1997 show that had a female masturbating over the phone, and a $7,000 fine in 1999 for a segment that involved a caller ordering a sex doll on May 28, 1998.&lt;ref name=FINESLIST/&gt;

By mid-1999, Clem had received four ''Billboard'' Personality of the Year awards.&lt;ref name=TBT19990512/&gt; He was earning in excess of six figures and owned two nightclubs, one of them named Planet Bubba in Spring Hill. His radio show crew included Mike "Cowhead" Calta, Mike "Manson" Waters,&lt;ref name=HAPPENED2018/&gt; Whitey Pippen, Scotty the Body, and Anita Wadd (real name Lori Lewis).&lt;ref name=TBT19990512/&gt; In November 2000, Clem was a candidate to succeed the [[Pinellas County, Florida]] sheriff.&lt;ref name=TBT19990512&gt;{{cite newspaper|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/326834098|title=The Mouth That Roars|first=Tom|last=Zucco|date=12 May 1999|newspaper=Floridian|pages=1, 3|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|subscription=yes|accessdate=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2001, Clem's show entered national syndication on stations in [[Jacksonville]], [[Orlando]], [[Hartford]], [[West Palm Beach]], [[Ft. Myers]], [[Wichita, Kansas]], [[Shreveport]], and [[Macon, Georgia]].

In February 2002, Clem was faced with animal cruelty charges following the February 27, 2001 broadcast which featured the Bubba's Road Kill Barbecue. The show involved the on-air castration and killing of a feral hog that had been captured by a hunter in the station's parking lot, and sound effects of hogs feeding were broadcast to have listeners believe it was being harassed and aggravated. The hog was then cooked and eaten by the crowd present. Clem, his executive producer Brent Hatley, and two others present were charged with felony animal cruelty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://edition.cnn.com/2002/LAW/02/25/ctv.florida.bubba.suit/index.html |work=CNN News |title=Florida shock jock faces animal cruelty charges |date=2002-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three were acquitted by a jury in March.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sptimes.com/2002/03/01/TampaBay/Cleared_of_cruelty__D.shtml |work=St. Petersburg Times |title=Cleared of cruelty, DJ vows revenge |date=2002-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2004, the FCC issued a $755,000 fine to [[Clear Channel Communications]] for objectionable comments from July 19, 2001.&lt;ref name=FINESLIST/&gt; The fine consisted of the maximum $27,500 fine for each of the 26 stations that aired the segments, plus $40,000 for record-keeping violations. The segment involved sexual discussions among the cartoon characters [[Alvin and the Chipmunks (1983 TV series)|Alvin and the Chipmunks]], [[George Jetson]], and [[Scooby-Doo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2004/01/27/tech/main596334.shtml |work=CBS News |title=FCC Issues Steep Indecency Fines |date=2004-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clem was fired on February 23, who at the time had the number one show in the Tampa area in the 18–54 year old male demographic.&lt;ref name=SPTIMES20040324/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.poynter.org/uncategorized/21260/lets-get-clear-channel-about-indecency/ |work=Poynter |title=Let’s Get Clear (Channel) About Indecency |date=2004-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2004–2010: Hiatus and Sirius Satellite Radio===
In July 2004, Clem announced his intention of once more running for Panellas County sheriff.&lt;ref name=TBT20040717&gt;{{cite newspaper|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/329744701|title=Bubba files to run for sheriff of Pinellas|first=Michael|last=van Sickler|date=17 July 2004|newspaper=Tampa Bay Times|page=32|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|subscription=yes|accessdate=27 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2005, [[Howard Stern]] announced the hiring of Clem to host weekday afternoons on [[Howard 100 and Howard 101|Howard 101]], his second channel on [[Sirius Satellite Radio]], a subscription-based [[satellite radio]] service exempt from FCC regulations. The show launched on January 9, 2006.

In 2008, Clem began to host two shows a day which lasted for one year. He and his crew would air a FCC compliant show on [[WHPT]] in the mornings, followed by thir uncensored program on Sirius in the afternoons. In 2009, Sirius opted for just FM replays during the week and one live uncensored show on Friday afternoons. In December 2010, Clem did not renew his contract with Sirius. Clem could work for RadioIO, an Internet radio service that his agent Thomas Bean was then the CEO of.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tampabay.com/blogs/media/content/tampa-shock-jock-bubba-love-sponge-leaves-sirius-xm-internet-radio |title=Tampa shock jock Bubba the Love Sponge leaves Sirius XM for Internet radio|last=Eric|first=Deggans|date=January 4, 2011|work=Tampa Bay Times|accessdate=2011-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2008–2016: Return to terrestrial radio===
Clem began broadcasting a live morning show from [[Tampa, Florida]] radio station [[WHPT]] 102.5 "The Bone" on January 8, 2008 which was simulcast on the [[Jacksonville, Florida]] radio station [[WOKV-FM|WFYV-FM]] 104.5 "Rock 105".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bubba the Love Sponge returning to Jacksonville airwaves|first=Mark |last=Basch |url=http://jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/121107/bus_224640812.shtml#.VbUtFvlNqSp |format=Original|work=Florida Times Union|publisher=Florida Times Union|location=Online |date=December 11, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the second quarter of 2008, Bubba's show received a number one rating &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bubba The Love Sponge regains No. 1 spot in Tampa Bay|first=Ryan |last=Saghir|url=http://www.orbitcast.com/archives/bubba-the-love-sponge-regains-1-spot-in-tampa-bay.html|format=Original|work=Orbitcast|publisher=Orbitcast|location=Online |date=May 5, 2008|accessdate=June 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; in his home market of [[Tampa, FL]].

Clem announced on January 3, 2011, he would have an internet show on [[RadioIO]] (A company which Clem's agent was the CEO of) and feature several programming features throughout the day starting on January 10, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Osborne|first=Spencer|url=http://siriusbuzz.com/radioio-credits-bubba-the-love-sponge-with-fast-growth.php |title=Radioio Credits Bubba The Love Sponge With Fast Growth |date=January 16, 2011|accessdate=January 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In August 2013 an audiotape was released on [[YouTube]] of Clem voicing a commercial for Vermont Teddy Bear. In this commercial Clem is heard making racist remarks; he denied being racist and said: "I never said the word in that manner, ever."  He believed that the audio was leaked from "someone who had access to [his] world" and that audio bits were taken from recordings when he worked at Clear Channel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tampabay.com/features/media/bubba-the-love-sponge-youtube-audio-with-n-word-not-what-it-seems/2136682|title=Bubba the Love Sponge: YouTube audio with n-word not what it seems|work=Tampa Bay Times|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160417004255/http://www.tampabay.com/features/media/bubba-the-love-sponge-youtube-audio-with-n-word-not-what-it-seems/2136682|archivedate=April 17, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clem's company, Bubba Radio Network, ordered the removal of the video from YouTube, although it is now hosted on [[TMZ]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tmz.com/videos/0_2233grgx/|title=Bubba the Love Sponge -- Racist Filth Caught on Tape|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130925211548/http://www.tmz.com/videos/0_2233grgx/|archivedate=September 25, 2013|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Clem was sued for defamation by competitor disc jockey Todd Schnitt, over on-air remarks Clem made about Schnitt's family. A court ruled in Clem's favor, and Schnitt vowed to appeal. In March 2013, after 13 hours of negotiations, Clem reached a settlement with Schnitt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abcactionnews.com/news/bubba-schnitt-reach-legal-settlement|title=Bubba, Schnitt reach legal settlement|last=Trenkmann|first=Chris|date=March 13, 2013|publisher=ABC Action News|accessdate=April 12, 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160423044542/http://www.abcactionnews.com/news/bubba-schnitt-reach-legal-settlement|archivedate=April 23, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2015, [[Nielsen Media Research|Nielsen]] sued Clem for $1 million over allegations of tampering with the ratings system by offering to pay several Nielsen panelists to manipulate the ratings by saying they listened to his show more than they actually did. Clem admitted to paying one person to manipulate the ratings, but Nielsen claimed he influenced several panelists. Clem's lawyer filed a motion asking that Nielsen's lawsuit be dismissed, but it was denied by a judge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wtsp.com/story/news/investigations/2015/12/01/bubba-the-love-sponge-nielsen-10-investigates-rating-tampering/76628366/|title=Bubba in more trouble with rating company|last=Deeson|first=Mike|date=December 1, 2015|publisher=WTSP|accessdate=June 14, 2016}}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bizjournals.com/tampabay/news/2016/02/22/judge-denies-bubbas-request-to-dismiss-nielsen.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-12-13 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220201210/http://www.bizjournals.com/tampabay/news/2016/02/22/judge-denies-bubbas-request-to-dismiss-nielsen.html |archivedate=December 20, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; After years of trial delays, Clem and Nielsen reached an out-of-court settlement on July 6, 2018. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rbr.com/bubba-nielsen-settle-ratings-tampering-lawsuit/|title=Bubba, Nielsen Settle Ratings Tampering Lawsuit - Radio &amp; Television Business Report|date=July 6, 2018|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hulk Hogan sex tape===
{{Main|Bollea v. Gawker}}
In early 2012, it was reported that Clem had filmed his then-wife Heather Clem and [[Hulk Hogan]] having sex in his bedroom. Subsequently, on October 4, 2012, [[Gawker]] released a short clip of the video.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gawker.com/5948770/even-for-a-minute-watching-hulk-hogan-have-sex-in-a-canopy-bed-is-not-safe-for-work-but-watch-it-anyway |title=Even for a Minute, Watching Hulk Hogan Have Sex in a Canopy Bed is Not Safe For Work but Watch it Anyway |last=Daulerio |first=A.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13704">'''Building airtightness''' (also called envelope airtightness) can be defined as the resistance to inward or outward air leakage through unintentional leakage points or areas in the [[building envelope]]. This air leakage is driven by differential pressures across the [[building envelope]] due to the combined effects of [[Stack effect|stack]], external wind and mechanical ventilation systems.&lt;ref name= Guyot &gt;G. Guyot, F. R. Carrié and P. Schild, “Project ASIEPI – Stimulation of good building and ductwork airtightness through EPBD,” 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Airtightness is the fundamental building property that impacts [[Infiltration (HVAC)|infiltration and exfiltration]] (the uncontrolled inward and outward leakage of outdoor air through cracks, interstices or other unintentional openings of a building, caused by pressure effects of the wind and/or stack effect).&lt;ref name= Limb&gt;M. Limb, "Technical note [[Air Infiltration and Ventilation Centre|AIVC]] 36- Air Infiltration and Ventilation Glossary," International Energy Agency energy conservation in buildings and community systems programme, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

An airtight building has several positive impacts&lt;ref&gt;Building Energy Codes, “Building Technologies Program: Air Leakage Guide”, U.S Department of Energy, September 2011&lt;/ref&gt; when combined with an appropriate ventilation system (whether natural, mechanical, or hybrid)&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Energy, “[https://www.energy.gov/eere/buildings/downloads/enverid-systems-hvac-load-reduction enVerid Systems - HVAC Load Reduction]”. Retrieved August 2018&lt;/ref&gt;:
* Lower heating bills due to less heat loss, with potentially smaller requirements for heating and cooling equipment capacities
* Better performing ventilation system
* Reduced chance of mold and rot because moisture is less likely to enter and become trapped in cavities{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}
* Fewer draughts and thus increased [[thermal comfort]]

A number of studies have shown substantial energy savings by tightening building envelopes.&lt;ref name= Guyot/&gt;&lt;ref name= Butler/&gt;&lt;ref name= Coxon/&gt; The ASIEPI project technical report on building and ductwork airtightness estimates the energy impact of envelope airtightness in the order of 10&amp;nbsp;kWh per m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of floor area per year, for the heating needs in a moderately cold region (2500 [[Heating degree day|degree-days]]).&lt;ref name= Guyot/&gt; Experimental data showing the energy savings of good airtightness were also published by the Building Research Establishment in the UK&lt;ref name= Butler&gt;D. Butler and A. Perry, "Co-heating Tests on BRE Test Houses Before and After Remedial Air Sealing," Building Research Establishment&lt;/ref&gt; as well as REHVA journals' special issue on airtightness.&lt;ref name= Coxon&gt;R. Coxon, “Research into the effect of improving airtightness in a typical UK dwelling,” The REHVA European HVAC Journal-Special issue on airtightness, vol. 50, no. 1, pp. 24-27, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; They conclude 15% of the space conditioning energy use can be saved in the UK context going from 11.5&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/(m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;·h) @50&amp;nbsp;Pa (average current value) down to 5&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/(m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;·h) @50&amp;nbsp;Pa (achievable).

Given its impacts on heat losses, good building airtightness may allow installation of smaller heating and cooling capacities. Conversely, poor airtightness may prevent achieving the desired indoor temperature conditions if the equipment has not been sized with proper estimates of infiltration heat losses.

From an energy point of view, it is almost always desirable to increase air tightness, but if infiltration is providing useful dilution of indoor contaminants, indoor air quality may suffer.&lt;ref name= Max&gt;M.H. Sherman and R. Chan, "Building Airtightness: Research and Practice", Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory report NO. LBNL-53356, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is often unclear how useful this dilution is because building leaks cause uncontrolled airflows and potentially poorly ventilated rooms although the total building air exchange rate may be sufficient.&lt;ref name= Boulanger&gt;L. Mouradian and X. Boulanger, "QUAD-BBC, Indoor Air Quality and ventilation systems in low energy buildings," [[Air Infiltration and Ventilation Centre|AIVC]] Newsletter No2, June 2012&lt;/ref&gt; This adverse effect has been confirmed by numerical simulations in the French context which has shown that typical mechanical ventilation systems yielded better [[indoor air quality]] with tighter envelopes.&lt;ref name= Boulanger/&gt;

Air leaking across the envelope from the relatively warm &amp; humid side to the relatively cold &amp; dry side may cause [[condensation]] and related damage as it's temperature drops below the [[dew point]].&lt;ref name= TightVent&gt;[[TightVent Europe]]: Building and Ductwork Airitightness Platform, http://tightvent.eu/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J.Langmans "Feasibility of exterior air barriers in timber frame construction", 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Air leakage pathways==

[[File:Common leakage sites classified in 4 categories.jpg|thumb|Common leakage sites classified in 4 categories]]

Leakage typically occurs at the following locations on the building envelope:&lt;ref&gt;F.R. Carrié, R. Jobert, V. Leprince: “Contributed report 14. Methods and techniques for airtight buildings”, Air Infiltration and Ventilation Centre, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

* Junctions between walls and other walls or floors
* Junctions between window frames and walls
* Electrical equipment
* Access doors and other wall penetrations

[[File:Vertical section of a typical building with identification of potential leakage junctions.jpg|thumb|Vertical section of a typical building with identification of potential leakage junctions]]

Common leakage sites are listed in the Figure and explained below:

# Junction lower floor / vertical wall
# Junction window sill / vertical wall
# Junction window lintel / vertical wall
# Junction window reveal / vertical wall (horizontal view)
# Vertical wall (Cross section)
# Perforation vertical wall
# Junction top floor / vertical wall
# Penetration of top floor
# Junction French window / vertical wall
# Junction inclined roof / vertical wall
# Penetration inclined roof
# Junction inclined roof / roof ridge
# Junction inclined roof / window
# Junction rolling blind / vertical wall
# Junction intermediate floor / vertical wall
# Junction exterior door lintel / vertical wall
# Junction exterior door sill / sill
# Penetration lower floor / crawlspace or basement
# Junction service shaft / access door
# Junction internal wall / intermediate floor

==Metrics==
The airtightness of a building is often expressed in terms of the leakage airflow rate through the building's envelope at a given reference pressure (usually 50 pascal)&lt;ref name= TightVent/&gt; divided by the:
* Heated building volume V. At 50·Pa, it is called the air change rate at 50 Pa and usually noted n&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt;(units: h&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref name= ISO9972&gt;ISO Standard 9972, “Thermal Insulation-Determination of Building Air Tightness – Fan Pressurization Method”, International Standards Organization, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= EN13829&gt;EN 13829:2000, "Thermal performance of building - Determination of air permeability of buildings - Fan pressurization method (ISO 9972:1996, modified)", 2000&lt;/ref&gt;
* Envelope area A&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;. At 50&amp;nbsp;Pa, it is called the [[air permeability]] at 50&amp;nbsp;Pa and noted usually q&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; or q&lt;sub&gt;a50&lt;/sub&gt; (units: m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/(h·m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;))&lt;ref name= ISO9972/&gt;&lt;ref name= EN13829/&gt; 
* Floor area A&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;. At 50&amp;nbsp;Pa, it is called the specific leakage rate and usually noted w&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; (units: m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/(h·m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;))&lt;ref name= ISO9972/&gt;&lt;ref name= EN13829/&gt;

The effective leakage area (ELA) at a reference pressure is also a common metric used to characterize envelope airtightness. It represents the area of a perfect orifice that would produce the same airflow rate as that passing through the building envelope at the reference pressure. To allow comparisons between buildings, the ELA may be divided by the envelope or floor area, or may be used to derive the normalized leakage area (NL).&lt;ref&gt;ASHRE, "ASHRAE Handbook-Fundamentals" Atlanta, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

For all of these metrics, the lower the 'airtightness' value is for a given building, the more airtight the building's envelope is.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

==Power law model of airflow through leaks==

The relationship between pressure and leakage air flow rate is defined by the [[power law]] between the airflow rate and the pressure difference across the building envelope as follows:&lt;ref&gt;R. Carrié &amp; P. Wouters, "Technical note [[Air Infiltration and Ventilation Centre|AIVC]] 67- Building airtightness: a critical review of testing, reporting and quality schemes in 10 countries," International Energy Agency energy conservation in buildings and community systems programme, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;big&gt;q&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;=C&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;∆p&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

where:
* &lt;big&gt;q&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/big&gt; is the volumetric leakage airflow rate expressed in m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;h&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;
* &lt;big&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/big&gt; is the air leakage coefficient expressed in m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;h&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;Pa&lt;sup&gt;−n&lt;/sup&gt;
* &lt;big&gt;∆p&lt;/big&gt; is the pressure difference across the building envelope expressed in [[Pascal (unit)|Pa]]
* &lt;big&gt;n&lt;/big&gt; is the airflow exponent (0.5 ≤ n ≤ 1)

This law enables to assess the airflow rate at any pressure difference regardless the initial measurement.

== Fan pressurization test ==
Building airtightness levels can be measured by using a [[Mechanical fan|fan]], temporarily installed in the [[building envelope]] (a [[blower door]]) to pressurize the building. Air flow through the fan creates an internal, uniform, static pressure within the building. The aim of this type of measurement is to relate the pressure differential across the envelope to the air flow rate required to produce it. Generally, the higher the flow rate required to produce a given pressure difference, the less airtight the building.&lt;ref name= Limb/&gt; The fan pressurization technique is also described in many standard test methods, such as [[ASTM]] E779 - 10,&lt;ref&gt;ASTM, Standard E779-10, “Test Method for Determining Air Leakage by Fan Pressurization”, ASTM Book of Standards, American Society of Testing and Materials, Vol. 4 (11), 2010&lt;/ref&gt; [[ASTM]] E1827 – 11,&lt;ref&gt;ASTM, Standard E1827-11, “Standard Test Methods for Determining Airtightness of Buildings Using an Orifice Blower Door”, ASTM Book of Standards, American Society of Testing and Materials, Vol. 4 (11), 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; CAN/CGSB-149.10-M86,&lt;ref&gt;CAN/CGSB Standard 149, “Determination of the Airtightness of Building Envelopes by Fan Depressurization Method”, Canadian General Standards Board, 1986&lt;/ref&gt; CAN/CGSB-149.15-96,&lt;ref&gt;CAN/CGSB Standard 149.15-96, “Determination of the Overall Envelope Airtightness of Buildings by the Fan Pressurization Method Using the Building's Air Handling Systems”, Canadian General Standards Board, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; ISO 9972:2006&lt;ref name= ISO9972/&gt; (now superseded), &amp; EN 13829&lt;ref name= EN13829/&gt; which is now 'withdrawn' due to the updated ISO 9972:2015.

==Airtightness requirements==

Most European countries include in their regulations either required or recommended minimum airtightness levels with or without mandatory testing. There are several countries (e.g., United Kingdom, France, Portugal, Denmark, Ireland) where, by regulation, airtightness testing is mandatory for certain building types or in the case of specific programmes.&lt;ref&gt;R. Carrié, M. Kapsalaki and P. Wouters, "Right and Tight: What´s new in Ductwork and Building Airtightness?," BUILD UP energy solutions for better buildings, 19 March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the US, the [[International Energy Conservation Code|IECC]] of 2012 adopted whole building airtightness requirements, including mandatory testing.&lt;ref&gt;International Code Council: "2012 International Energy Conservation Code", 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, in May, 2012, [[USACE]] issued a new Engineering and Construction Bulletin in collaboration with the [http://www.airbarrier.org/ Air Barrier Association of America], outlining Army requirements for building airtightness and building air leakage testing for new and renovation construction projects.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Army Corps of Engineers &amp; Air Barrier Association of America: "Air Leakage Test Protocol for Building Envelopes", 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Washington was the first State to institute [[air barrier]] requirements with both a maximum material air leakage requirement and a whole building maximum air permeability rate with testing requirements for buildings six stories and higher.&lt;ref&gt;W. Anis : "The changing requirements of airtightness in the US", proceedings of the [[Air Infiltration and Ventilation Centre|AIVC]] -TightVent Workshop: "Building &amp; Ductwork airtightness: Design, Implementation, Control and Durability: Feedback from Practice and Perspectives", 18–19 April 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several voluntary programs that require a minimum airtightness level for the building envelope ([[Passive house|Passivhaus]], [[MINERGIE-P|Minergie-P]], [[:fr:Effinergie|Effinergie]] etc.). Historically, the Passivhaus standard, originated in 1988 was the cornerstone for envelope airtightness developments because these types of buildings require extremely low leakage levels (n&lt;sub&gt;50&lt;/sub&gt; below 0.6 ach).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="55014">'''Business valuation''' is a process and a set of procedures used to estimate the [[valuation (finance)|economic value]] of an owner's interest in a business.  [[Valuation (finance)|Valuation]] is used by financial market participants 
to determine the price they are willing to pay or receive to effect a sale of a business.  In addition to estimating the selling price of a business, the same valuation tools are often used by business appraisers to resolve disputes related to estate and gift taxation, divorce litigation, allocate business purchase price among business assets, establish a formula for estimating the value of partners' ownership interest for buy-sell agreements, and many other business and legal purposes such as in shareholders deadlock, divorce litigation and estate contest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kwok|first=Benny K. B. |title=Forensic Accountancy (2nd edition) |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Tfg8twAACAAJ|year=2008|publisher=LexisNexis|isbn=978-962-8972-76-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In some cases, the court would appoint a forensic accountant as the joint expert doing the business valuation.

== Standard and premise of value ==
{{see also|Business valuation standard}}
Before the value of a business can be measured, the valuation assignment must specify the reason for and circumstances surrounding the [http://bvint.com/ business valuation]. These are formally known as the business value standard and premise of value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Pratt | first = Shannon | authorlink =  |author2=Robert F. Reilly |author3=Robert P. Schweihs   | title = Valuing a Business | publisher = McGraw Hill | series = McGraw-Hill Professional  | year = 2000  | doi =   | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=WO6wd8O8dsUC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=shannon+pratt&amp;ei=fcfUR6q-F4TCyQSrxfWABA&amp;sig=Fpqt8pGRjbLPZJ9e_QEQGFzQ7y0#PPA913,M1  | isbn = 0-07-135615-0 }} hmegrii
&lt;/ref&gt;

The standard of value is the hypothetical conditions under which the business will be valued.  The premise of value relates to the assumptions, such as assuming that the business will continue forever in its current form (going concern), or that the value of the business lies in the proceeds from the sale of all of its assets minus the related debt (sum of the parts or assemblage of business assets).

== Standards of value ==

* Fair market value – a value of a business enterprise determined between a willing buyer and a willing seller both in full knowledge of all the relevant facts and neither compelled to conclude a transaction.
* Investment value – a value the company has to a particular investor. Note that the effect of synergy is included in valuation under the investment standard of value.
* Intrinsic value – the measure of business value that reflects the investor's in-depth understanding of the company's economic potential.

==Premises of value==

* Going Concern – Value in continued use as an ongoing operating business enterprise.
* Assemblage of assets – value of assets in place but not used to conduct business operations.
* Orderly disposition – value of business assets in exchange, where the assets are to be disposed of individually and not used for business operations. 
* Liquidation – value in exchange when business assets are to be disposed of in a forced liquidation.

Premise of value for fair value Calculation

* In use – If the asset would provide maximum value to the market participants principally through its use in combination with other assets as a group.
* In Exchange – If the asset would provide maximum value to the market participants principally on a stand-alone basis. 
Business valuation results can vary considerably depending upon the choice of both the standard and premise of value.  In an actual business sale, it would be expected that the buyer and seller, each with an incentive to achieve an optimal outcome, would determine the fair market value of a business asset that would compete in the market for such an acquisition.  If the synergies are specific to the company being valued, they may not be considered.  Fair value also does not incorporate discounts for lack of control or marketability.

Note, however, that it is possible to achieve the fair market value for a business asset that is being liquidated in its secondary market. This underscores the difference between the standard and premise of value.

These assumptions might not, and probably do not, reflect the actual conditions of the market in which the subject business might be sold. However, these conditions are assumed because they yield a uniform standard of value, after applying generally accepted valuation techniques, which allows meaningful comparison between businesses which are similarly situated.

== Elements of business valuation ==

=== Economic conditions ===

{{Globalize/US|date=March 2011}}

A business valuation report generally begins with a summary of the purpose and scope of business appraisal as well as its date and stated audience. What follows is a description of national, regional and local economic conditions existing as of the valuation date, as well as the conditions of the industry in which the subject business operates.
A common source of economic information for the first section of the business valuation report is the Federal Reserve Board's [[Beige Book]], published eight times a year by the [[Federal Reserve Bank]]. State governments and industry associations also publish useful statistics describing regional and industry conditions.

=== Financial analysis ===
The [[financial statement analysis]] generally involves common size analysis, [[financial ratio|ratio analysis]] (liquidity, turnover, profitability, etc.), trend analysis and industry comparative analysis.  This permits the valuation analyst to compare the subject company to other businesses in the same or similar industry, and to discover trends affecting the company and/or the industry over time. By comparing a company's [[financial statements]] in different time periods, the valuation expert can view growth or decline in revenues or expenses, changes in capital structure, or other financial trends.  How the subject company compares to the industry will help with the risk assessment and ultimately help determine the discount rate and the selection of market multiples.

It is important to mention that among the financial statements, the primary statement to show the liquidity of the company is cash flow.
Cash flow shows the company's cash in and out flow.

=== Normalization of financial statements ===
The key objective of normalization is to identify the ability of the business to generate income for its owners. A measure of the income is the amount of cash flow that the owners can remove from the business without adversely affecting its operations. The most common normalization adjustments fall into the following four categories:
* Comparability Adjustments. The valuer may adjust the subject company's [[financial statements]] to facilitate a comparison between the subject company and other businesses in the same industry or geographic location. These adjustments are intended to eliminate differences between the way that published industry data is presented and the way that the subject company's data is presented in its [[financial statements]].
* Non-operating Adjustments. It is reasonable to assume that if a business were sold in a hypothetical sales transaction (which is the underlying premise of the [[fair market value]] standard), the seller would retain any assets which were not related to the production of earnings or price those non-operating assets separately. For this reason, non-operating assets (such as excess cash) are usually eliminated from the balance sheet.
* Non-recurring Adjustments. The subject company's financial statements may be affected by events that are not expected to recur, such as the purchase or sale of assets, a lawsuit, or an unusually large revenue or expense. These non-recurring items are adjusted so that the [[financial statements]] will better reflect the management's expectations of future performance.
* Discretionary Adjustments. The owners of private companies may be paid at variance from the market level of compensation that similar executives in the industry might command. In order to determine [[fair market value]], the owner's compensation, benefits, perquisites and distributions must be adjusted to industry standards. Similarly, the rent paid by the subject business for the use of property owned by the company's owners individually may be scrutinized.

=== Income, asset and market approaches ===
Three different approaches are commonly used in business valuation: the income approach, the asset-based approach, and the market approach.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.valuadder.com/valuationguide/business-valuation-three-approaches.html Economic Principles behind the Market, Asset and Income Approaches]&lt;/ref&gt; Within each of these approaches, there are various techniques for determining the value of a business using the definition of value appropriate for the appraisal assignment. Generally, the income approaches determine value by calculating the [[net present value]] of the benefit stream generated by the business (discounted cash flow); the asset-based approaches determine value by adding the sum of the parts of the business (net asset value); and the market approaches determine value by comparing the subject company to other companies in the same industry, of the same size, and/or within the same region. A number of business valuation models can be constructed that utilize various methods under the three business valuation approaches. Venture Capitalists and Private Equity professionals have long used the [[First chicago method]] which essentially combines the income approach with the market approach.

In certain cases equity may also be valued by applying the techniques and frameworks developed for [[option (finance)|financial options]], via a [[real options]] framework,&lt;ref name="Damodaran"/&gt; as discussed [[Business valuation#Option pricing approaches|below]].

In determining which of these approaches to use, the valuation professional must exercise discretion. Each technique has advantages and drawbacks, which must be considered when applying those techniques to a particular subject company. Most treatises and court decisions encourage the valuator to consider more than one technique, which must be reconciled with each other to arrive at a value conclusion. A measure of common sense and a good grasp of mathematics is helpful.

== Income approach ==
The income approach relies upon the economic principle of expectation: the value of business is based on the expected economic benefit and level of risk associated with the investment. Income based valuation methods determine [[fair market value]] by dividing the benefit stream generated by the subject or target company times a discount or capitalization rate. The discount or capitalization rate converts the stream of benefits into [[present value]]. There are several different income methods, including capitalization of earnings or [[cash flow]]s, discounted future cash flows ("[[discounted cash flow|DCF]]"), and the excess earnings method (which is a hybrid of asset and income approaches). The result of a value calculation under the income approach is generally the [[fair market value]] of a controlling, marketable interest in the subject company, since the entire benefit stream of the subject company is most often valued, and the capitalization and discount rates are derived from statistics concerning public companies.  [http://www.medlawplus.com/library/legal/irsrulings/revruling59-60.htm IRS Revenue Ruling 59-60] states that earnings are preeminent for the valuation of closely held operating companies.

However, income valuation methods can also be used to establish the value of a severable business asset as long as an income stream can be attributed to it. An example is licensable intellectual property whose value needs to be established to arrive at a supportable royalty structure.

=== Discount or capitalization rates ===
A [[Discounted cash flow|discount rate]] or [[capitalization rate]] is used to determine the [[present value]] of the [[expected return]]s of a business. The discount rate and [[capitalization rate]] are closely related to each other, but distinguishable. Generally speaking, the discount rate or [[capitalization rate]] may be defined as the yield necessary to attract investors to a particular investment, given the risks associated with that investment.

* In [[discounted cash flow|DCF]] valuations, the discount rate, often an estimate of the [[cost of capital]] for the business, is used to calculate the [[net present value]] of a series of projected [[cash flow]]s. The discount rate can also be viewed as the required rate of return the investors expect to receive from the business enterprise, given the level of risk they undertake.
* On the other hand, a capitalization rate is applied in methods of business valuation that are based on business data for a single period of time.  For example, in real estate valuations for properties that generate [[cash flow]]s, a [[capitalization rate]] may be applied to the net operating income (NOI) (i.e., income before depreciation and interest expenses) of the property for the trailing twelve months.

There are several different methods of determining the appropriate discount rates. The discount rate is composed of two elements: (1) the [[Risk-free interest rate|risk-free rate]], which is the return that an investor would expect from a secure, practically risk-free investment, such as a high quality government bond; plus (2) a [[risk premium]] that compensates an investor for the relative level of risk associated with a particular investment in excess of the risk-free rate. Most importantly, the selected discount or capitalization rate must be consistent with stream of benefits to which it is to be applied.

Capitalization and discounting valuation calculations become mathematically equivalent under the assumption that the business income grows at a constant rate.

==== Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) ====
The [[capital asset pricing model]] (CAPM) provides one method of determining a discount rate in business valuation. The [[Capital asset pricing model|CAPM]] originated from the Nobel Prize-winning studies of Harry Markowitz, James Tobin, and William Sharpe. The method derives the discount rate by adding risk premium to the risk-free rate. The risk premium is derived by multiplying the equity risk premium with "beta", a measure of stock price volatility. Beta is compiled by various researchers for particular industries and companies, and measures systematic risks of investment.

One of the criticisms of the [[Capital asset pricing model|CAPM]] is that beta is derived from volatility of prices of publicly traded companies, which differ from non-publicly companies in liquidity, marketability, capital structures and control. Other aspects such as access to credit markets, size, and management depth are generally different, too. The rate build-up method also requires an assessment of the subject company's risk, which provides valuation of itself.  Where a privately held company can be shown to be sufficiently similar to a public company, the [[Capital asset pricing model|CAPM]] may be suitable. However, it requires the knowledge of market stock prices for calculation. For private companies that do not sell stock on the public capital markets, this information is not readily available. Therefore, calculation of beta for private firms is problematic. The build-up cost of capital model is the typical choice in such cases.

===== Alternative valuation approaches and factor models =====
With regard to capital market-oriented valuation approaches there are numerous valuation approaches besides the traditional CAPM model. They include, for example, the [[Arbitrage pricing theory]] (APT) as well as the [[Consumption-based capital asset pricing model|Consumption-based Capital Asset Pricing Model]] (CCAPM). Furthermore, alternative capital market models were developed, having in common that expected return hinge on ''multiple'' risk sources and thus being less restrictive:

* Models of the Q theory&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zhang|first=Chu|date=2009|title=On the explanatory power of firm-specific variables in cross-sections of expected returns|url=|journal=Journal of Empirical Finance|volume=|pages=306-317|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Fama–French three-factor model]]
* [[Carhart four-factor model]]
* Fama-French five-factor model

Nevertheless, even these models are not wholly consistent, as they also show [[market anomalies]]. However, the method of incomplete replication and risk covering come along without the need of capital market data and thus being more solid.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gleißner Werner|first=Gregor Dorfleitner|date=2016|title=Valuing streams of risky cash flows with risk-value models|url=|journal=Journal of Risk|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Equally notable is the existence of investment based approaches, considering different investment opportunities and determining an investment program by means of linear optimization. Among them the approximative decomposition valuation approach can be found.

====Modified Capital Asset Pricing Model====
The Cost of Equity (Ke) is computed by using the Modified Capital Asset Pricing Model (Mod. CAPM)

&lt;math&gt;k_e  = R_f + \beta ( R_m-R_f) + SCRP + CSRP  &lt;/math&gt;

Where:

&lt;math&gt;R_f&lt;/math&gt;   =   Risk free rate of return (Generally taken as 10-year Government  Bond Yield)

&lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;   =   Beta Value (Sensitivity of the stock returns to market returns)

&lt;math&gt;k_e&lt;/math&gt;   =   Cost of Equity

&lt;math&gt;R_m&lt;/math&gt;   =    Market Rate of Return

SCRP = Small Company Risk Premium

CSRP= Company specific Risk premium

==== Weighted average cost of capital ("WACC") ====
The [[weighted average cost of capital]] is an approach to determining a discount rate. The [[weighted average cost of capital|WACC]] method determines the subject company's actual [[cost of capital]] by calculating the weighted average of the company's [[interest (finance)|cost of debt]] and cost of [[stock|equity]]. The [[weighted average cost of capital|WACC]] must be applied to the subject company's net [[cash flow]] to total invested capital.

One of the problems with this method is that the valuator may elect to calculate [[weighted average cost of capital|WACC]] according to the subject company's existing [[capital structure]], the average industry [[capital structure]], or the optimal capital structure. Such discretion detracts from the objectivity of this approach, in the minds of some critics.

Indeed, since the [[weighted average cost of capital|WACC]] captures the risk of the subject business itself, the existing or contemplated capital structures, rather than industry averages, are the appropriate choices for business valuation.

Once the [[capitalization rate]] or discount rate is determined, it must be applied to an appropriate economic income stream: pretax [[cash flow]], aftertax [[cash flow]], pretax [[net income]], after tax [[net income]], excess earnings, projected [[cash flow]], etc. The result of this formula is the indicated value before discounts. Before moving on to calculate discounts, however, the valuation professional must consider the indicated value under the asset and market approaches.

Careful matching of the discount rate to the appropriate measure of economic income is critical to the accuracy of the business valuation results. Net [[cash flow]] is a frequent choice in professionally conducted business appraisals. The rationale behind this choice is that this earnings basis corresponds to the equity discount rate derived from the Build-Up or [[Capital asset pricing model|CAPM]] models: the returns obtained from investments in publicly traded companies can easily be represented in terms of net cash flows. At the same time, the discount rates are generally also derived from the public capital markets data.

==== Build-Up Method ====
The Build-Up Method is a widely recognized method of determining the after-tax net cash flow discount rate, which in turn yields the capitalization rate. The figures used in the Build-Up Method are derived from various sources. This method is called a "build-up" method because it is the sum of risks associated with various classes of assets. It is based on the principle that investors would require a greater return on classes of assets that are more risky. The first element of a Build-Up capitalization rate is the risk-free rate, which is the rate of return for long-term government bonds. Investors who buy large-cap equity stocks, which are inherently more risky than long-term government bonds, require a greater return, so the next element of the Build-Up method is the equity risk premium. In determining a company's value, the long-horizon equity risk premium is used because the Company's life is assumed to be infinite. The sum of the risk-free rate and the equity risk premium yields the long-term average market rate of return on large public company stocks.

Similarly, investors who invest in small cap stocks, which are riskier than blue-chip stocks, require a greater return, called the "size premium." Size premium data is generally available from two sources: [[Morningstar, Inc.|Morningstar]]'s (formerly [[Roger G. Ibbotson|Ibbotson]] &amp; Associates') Stocks, Bonds, Bills &amp; Inflation and [[Duff &amp; Phelps]]' Risk Premium Report.

By adding the first three elements of a Build-Up discount rate, we can determine the rate of return that investors would require on their investments in small public company stocks. These three elements of the Build-Up discount rate are known collectively as the "systematic risks." This type of investment risk cannot be avoided through portfolio diversification. It arises from external factors and affect every type of investment in the economy. As a result, investors taking systematic risk are rewarded by an additional premium.

In addition to systematic risks, the discount rate must include "unsystematic risk" representing that portion of total investment risk that can be avoided through diversification. Public capital markets do not provide evidence of unsystematic risk since investors that fail to diversify cannot expect additional returns.

Unsystematic risk falls into two categories. One of those categories is the "industry risk premium". It is also known as [[Idiosyncrasy#Idiosyncrasy in economics|idiosyncratic risk]] and can be observed by studying the returns of a group of companies operating in the same industry sector.  Morningstar's yearbooks contain empirical data to quantify the risks associated with various industries, grouped by SIC industry code.

The other category of unsystematic risk is referred to as "company specific risk." Historically, no published data has been available to quantify specific company risks. However, as of late 2006, new research has been able to quantify, or isolate, this risk for publicly traded stocks through the use of Total Beta calculations.  P. Butler and K. Pinkerton have outlined a procedure which sets the following two equations together:

Total Cost of Equity (TCOE) = risk-free rate + total beta*equity risk premium
TCOE = risk-free rate + beta*equity risk premium + size premium + company-specific risk premium

The only unknown in the two equations is the company specific risk premium.

While it is possible to isolate the company-specific risk premium as shown above, many appraisers just key in on the total cost of equity (TCOE) provided by the following equation: TCOE = risk-free rate + Total beta*equity risk premium.

It is similar to using the market approach in the income approach instead of adding separate (and potentially redundant) measures of risk in the build-up approach.  The use of total beta (developed by Aswath Damodaran) is a relatively new concept.  It is, however, gaining acceptance in the business valuation community since it is based on modern portfolio theory.  Total beta can help appraisers develop a cost of capital who were content to use their intuition alone when previously adding a purely subjective company-specific risk premium in the build-up approach.

It is important to understand why this capitalization rate for small, privately held companies is significantly higher than the return that an investor might expect to receive from other common types of investments, such as money market accounts, mutual funds, or even real estate. Those investments involve substantially lower levels of risk than an investment in a closely held company. Depository accounts are insured by the federal government (up to certain limits); mutual funds are composed of publicly traded stocks, for which risk can be substantially minimized through portfolio diversification.

[[closely held company|Closely held companies]], on the other hand, frequently fail for a variety of reasons too numerous to name. Examples of the risk can be witnessed in the storefronts on every Main Street in America. There are no federal guarantees. The risk of investing in a private company cannot be reduced through diversification, and most businesses do not own the type of hard assets that can ensure capital appreciation over time. This is why investors demand a much higher return on their investment in closely held businesses; such investments are inherently much more risky.  (This paragraph is biased, presuming that by the mere fact that a company is closely held, it is prone towards failure.)

== Asset-based approaches ==
The value of asset-based analysis of a business is equal to the sum of its parts. That is the theory underlying the asset-based approaches to business valuation. The asset approach to business valuation reported on the books of the subject company at their acquisition value, net of depreciation where applicable. These values must be adjusted to [[fair market value]] wherever possible.
The value of a company's intangible assets, such as goodwill, is generally impossible to determine apart from the company's overall [[enterprise value]]. For this reason, the asset-based approach is not the most probative method of determining the value of going business concerns. In these cases, the asset-based approach yields a result that is probably lesser than the [[fair market value]] of the business.
In considering an asset-based approach, the valuation professional must consider whether the shareholder whose interest is being valued would have any authority to access the value of the assets directly. Shareholders own shares in a corporation, but not its assets, which are owned by the corporation. A controlling shareholder may have the authority to direct the corporation to sell all or part of the assets it owns and to distribute the proceeds to the shareholder(s). The non-controlling shareholder, however, lacks this authority and cannot access the value of the assets. As a result, the value of a corporation's assets is not the true indicator of value to a shareholder who cannot avail himself of that value. The asset based approach is the entry barrier value and should preferably to be used in businesses having mature or declining growth cycle and is more suitable for capital intensive industry.

Adjusted [[book value|net book value]] may be the most relevant standard of value where liquidation is imminent or ongoing; where a company earnings or cash flow are nominal, negative or worth less than its assets; or where [[book value|net book value]] is standard in the industry in which the company operates. The adjusted [[book value|net book value]] may also be used as a "sanity check" when compared to other methods of valuation, such as the income and market approaches...

== Market approaches ==
{{main|Valuation using multiples}}

The market approach to business valuation is rooted in the economic principle of competition: that in a free market the supply and demand forces will drive the price of business assets to a certain equilibrium. Buyers would not pay more for the business, and the sellers will not accept less, than the price of a comparable business enterprise. The buyers and sellers are assumed to be equally well informed and acting in their own interests to conclude a transaction. It is similar in many respects to the "comparable sales" method that is commonly used in [[real estate appraisal]]. The market price of the stocks of publicly traded companies engaged in the same or a similar line of business, whose shares are actively traded in a free and open market, can be a valid indicator of value when the transactions in which stocks are traded are sufficiently similar to permit meaningful comparison.

The difficulty lies in identifying public companies that are sufficiently comparable to the subject company for this purpose. Also, as for a [[private company]], the equity is less liquid (in other words its stocks are less easy to buy or sell) than for a [[public company]], its value is considered to be slightly lower than such a [[market-based valuation]] would give.

When there is a lack of comparison with direct competition, a meaningful alternative could be a vertical value-chain approach where the subject company is compared with, for example, a known downstream industry to have a good feel of its value by building useful correlations with its downstream companies. Such comparison often reveals useful insights which help business analysts better understand performance relationship between the subject company and its downstream industry. For example, if a growing subject company is in an industry more concentrated than its downstream industry with a high degree of interdependence, one should logically expect the subject company performs better than the downstream industry in terms of growth, margins and risk.

=== Guideline Public Company method ===
Guideline Public Company method entails a [[Comparable company analysis|comparison]] of the subject company to [[publicly traded companies]]. The [[Comparable company analysis|comparison]] is generally based on published data regarding the public companies' stock price and earnings, sales, or revenues, which is expressed as a fraction known as a "multiple." If the guideline public companies are sufficiently similar to each other and the subject company to permit a meaningful comparison, then their multiples should be similar. The public companies identified for comparison purposes should be similar to the subject company in terms of industry, product lines, market, growth, margins and risk.

However, if the subject company is privately owned, its value must be adjusted for lack of marketability. This is usually represented by a discount, or a percentage reduction in the value of the company when compared to its publicly traded counterparts. This reflects the higher risk associated with holding stock in a private company. The difference in value can be quantified by applying a discount for lack of marketability. This discount is determined by studying prices paid for shares of ownership in private companies that eventually offer their stock in a public offering. Alternatively, the lack of marketability can be assessed by comparing the prices paid for restricted shares to fully marketable shares of stock of public companies.

==Option pricing approaches==
[[Business valuation#Income.2C asset and market approaches|As above]], in certain cases equity may be valued by applying the techniques and frameworks developed for [[option (finance)|financial options]], via a [[real options]] framework.&lt;ref name="Damodaran"&gt;[[Aswath Damodaran]] ([[Stern School of Business]]):  [http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~adamodar/New_Home_Page/lectures/opt.html Applications Of Option Pricing Theory To Equity Valuation] and [http://people.stern.nyu.edu/adamodar/pdfiles/eqnotes/optequity.pdf Option Pricing Applications in Valuation].&lt;/ref&gt; For general discussion as to context see [[Corporate finance#Valuing flexibility|#"Valuing flexibility"]] under [[corporate finance]], and [[Contingent claim valuation]]; for detail as to applicability and other considerations see [[Real options valuation#Limitations|#"Limitations"]] under [[real options valuation]].

In general, equity may be viewed as a [[call option]] on the firm,&lt;ref name ="Black-Scholes"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Pricing of Options and Corporate Liabilities|last=Black|first=Fischer|author2=Myron Scholes|journal=Journal of Political Economy|year=1973|volume=81|issue=3|pages=637–654|doi=10.1086/260062}} [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1831029]&lt;/ref&gt; and this allows for the valuation of troubled firms which may otherwise be difficult to analyse.&lt;ref name="Damodaran2"&gt;Aswath Damodaran (Stern School of Business):  [http://people.stern.nyu.edu/adamodar/pdfiles/Seminars/AIMR3.pdf Valuing Firms in Distress].&lt;/ref&gt;  The classic application of this approach is to the valuation of [[distressed securities]], already discussed in the original [[Black-Scholes]] paper.&lt;ref name ="Black-Scholes"/&gt; Here, since the principle of [[limited liability]] protects equity investors, shareholders would choose not to repay the firm's debt where the value of the firm (as perceived) is less than the value of the outstanding debt; see [[bond valuation]]. Of course, where firm value is greater than debt value, the shareholders would choose to repay (i.e. [[Exercise (options)|exercise their option]]) and not to [[liquidate]]. Thus analogous to [[out the money]] options which nevertheless have value, equity will (may) have value even if the value of the firm falls (well) below the face value of the outstanding debt—and this value can (should) be determined using the appropriate [[Option (finance)#Model implementation|option valuation technique]]. (A further application of this principle is the analysis of [[principal–agent problem]]s;&lt;ref name="Damodaran"/&gt; see [[Principal–agent problem#Contract design|contract design]] under [[principal–agent problem]].)

Certain business situations, and the parent firms in those cases, are also logically analysed under an options framework; see [[Real options valuation#Further reading|"Applications"]] under the [[Real options valuation]] references. Just as a financial option gives its owner the right, but not the obligation, to buy or sell a security at a given price, companies that make strategic investments have the right, but not the obligation, to exploit opportunities in the future; management will of course only exercise where this makes economic sense. Thus, for companies facing uncertainty of this type, the stock price may (should) be seen as the sum of the value of existing businesses (i.e., the [[discounted cash flow|discounted cash flow value]]) plus any real option value.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Rappaport and [[Michael Mauboussin]] ([[Columbia Business School]]): [http://www.expectationsinvesting.com/tutorial11.shtml How Do You Assess The Value of A Company's "Real Options"?]&lt;/ref&gt; Equity valuations here, may (should) thus proceed likewise. Compare [[Price–earnings ratio#PVGO|PVGO]].

A common application is to [[natural resource]] investments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authorlink=Michael Brennan (finance) |last=Brennan |first=J. |authorlink2=Eduardo Schwartz |last2=Schwartz |first2=E. |jstor=2352967 |title=Evaluating Natural Resource Investments |journal=[[The Journal of Business]] |volume=58 |issue=2 |year=1985 |pages=135–157 |doi=10.1086/296288}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Here, the [[underlying|underlying asset]] is the resource itself; the value of the asset is a function of both quantity of resource available and the [[Commodity market|price of the commodity in question]].  The value of the resource is then the difference between the value of the asset and the cost associated with [[Underground mining (hard rock)#Development mining vs. production mining|developing the resource]]. Where positive ("[[in the money]]") management will undertake the development, and will not do so otherwise, and a resource project is thus effectively a [[call option]].  A [[:Category:Mining companies|resource firm]] may (should) therefore also be analysed using the options approach. Specifically, the value of the firm comprises the value of already active projects determined via DCF valuation (or [[Outline of finance#Valuation|other standard techniques]]) and undeveloped reserves as analysed using the [[real options]] framework. See [[Mineral economics]].

Product [[patents]] may also be valued as options, and the value of firms holding these patents — typically firms in the [[:Category:Biotechnology companies|bio-science]], [[:Category:Technology companies|technology]],  and [[:Category:Pharmaceutical companies|pharmaceutical]] sectors — can (should) similarly be viewed as the sum of the value of products in place and the portfolio of patents yet to be deployed.&lt;ref&gt;P. Alonso, V. Azofra, and G. de la Fuente. (2006). [https://uam.academia.edu/PablodeAndr%C3%9EesAlonso/Papers/811295/The_real_options_component_of_firm_market_value_The_case_of_the_technological_corporation  The real options component of firm market value: The case of the technological corporation] ; A. Buckley,  K. Tse, H. Rijken and  H. Eijgenhuijsen. (2002). [http://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/eurman/v20y2002i5p512-526.html Stock Market Valuation with Real Options: lessons from Netscape]&lt;/ref&gt;  As regards the option analysis, since the patent provides the firm with the right to develop the product, it will do so only if the [[present value]] of the expected cash flows from the product exceeds the cost of development, and the patent rights thus correspond to a [[call option]]. See [[Patent valuation#Option-based method|Patent valuation § Option-based method]]. Similar analysis may be applied to [[Option (filmmaking)|options on films]] (or other works of [[intellectual property]]) and the valuation of [[film studio]]s.

== Cultural valuation method ==
Besides mathematical approaches for the valuation of companies a rather unknown method includes also the cultural aspect. The so-called Cultural valuation method (Cultural Due Diligence) seeks to combine existing knowledge, motivation and internal culture with the results of a net-asset-value method. Especially during a company takeover uncovering hidden problems is of high importance for a later success of the business venture.

== Discounts and premiums ==
The valuation approaches yield the [[fair market value]] of the Company as a whole. In valuing a minority, non-controlling interest in a business, however, the valuation professional must consider the applicability of discounts that affect such interests.
Discussions of discounts and premiums frequently begin with a review of the "levels of value". There are three common levels of value: controlling interest, marketable minority, and non-marketable minority.
The intermediate level, marketable minority interest, is less than the controlling interest level and higher than the non-marketable minority interest level. The marketable minority interest level represents the perceived value of equity interests that are freely traded without any restrictions. These interests are generally traded on the New York Stock Exchange, AMEX, NASDAQ, and other exchanges where there is a ready market for equity securities. These values represent a minority interest in the subject companies – small blocks of stock that represent less than 50% of the company's equity, and usually much less than 50%.
Controlling interest level is the value that an investor would be willing to pay to acquire more than 50% of a company's stock, thereby gaining the attendant prerogatives of control. Some of the prerogatives of control include: electing directors, hiring and firing the company's management and determining their compensation; declaring dividends and distributions, determining the company's strategy and line of business, and acquiring, selling or liquidating the business. This level of value generally contains a [[control premium]] over the intermediate level of value, which typically ranges from 25% to 50%. An additional premium may be paid by strategic investors who are motivated by synergistic motives.
Non-marketable, minority level is the lowest level on the chart, representing the level at which non-controlling equity interests in private companies are generally valued or traded. This level of value is discounted because no ready market exists in which to purchase or sell interests. Private companies are less "liquid" than publicly traded companies, and transactions in private companies take longer and are more uncertain. Between the intermediate and lowest levels of the chart, there are restricted shares of publicly traded companies.
Despite a growing inclination of the IRS and Tax Courts to challenge valuation discounts, Shannon Pratt suggested in a scholarly presentation recently that valuation discounts are actually increasing as the differences between public and private companies is widening .  Publicly traded stocks have grown more liquid in the past decade due to rapid electronic trading, reduced commissions, and governmental deregulation. These developments have not improved the liquidity of interests in private companies, however.
Valuation discounts are multiplicative, so they must be considered in order. Control premiums and their inverse, minority interest discounts, are considered before marketability discounts are applied.

=== Discount for lack of control ===
The first discount that must be considered is the discount for lack of control, which in this instance is also a minority interest discount. Minority interest discounts are the inverse of control premiums, to which the following mathematical relationship exists:
MID = 1 – [1 / (1 + CP)]
The most common source of data regarding control premiums is the Control Premium Study, published annually by Mergerstat since 1972. Mergerstat compiles data regarding publicly announced mergers, acquisitions and divestitures involving 10% or more of the equity interests in public companies, where the purchase price is $1 million or more and at least one of the parties to the transaction is a [[United States entity|U.S. entity]]. Mergerstat defines the "control premium" as the percentage difference between the acquisition price and the share price of the freely traded public shares five days prior to the announcement of the M&amp;A transaction.
While it is not without valid criticism, Mergerstat control premium data (and the minority interest discount derived therefrom) is widely accepted within the valuation profession.

=== Discount for lack of marketability ===
A "discount for lack of marketability" (DLOM) may be applied to a minority block of stock to alter the valuation of that block.&lt;ref name=IRSpub&gt;https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-utl/dlom.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WillDLOM&gt;http://www.willamette.com/pubs/presentations/tax_lawyer_article.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another factor to be considered in valuing closely held companies is the marketability of an interest in such businesses. Marketability is defined as the ability to convert the business interest into cash quickly, with minimum transaction and administrative costs, and with a high degree of certainty as to the amount of net proceeds. There is usually a cost and a time lag associated with locating interested and capable buyers of interests in privately held companies, because there is no established market of readily available buyers and sellers.{{cn|date=January 2017}}

All other factors being equal, an interest in a publicly traded company is worth more because it is readily marketable. Conversely, an interest in a private-held company is worth less because no established market exists.&lt;ref&gt;Abudy M., Benninga S., and Shust E., (2016). The Cost of Equity for Private Firms, Journal of Corporate Finance 37, 431-443. {{DOI|10.1016/j.jcorpfin.2016.01.014}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The IRS Valuation Guide for Income, Estate and Gift Taxes, Valuation Training for Appeals Officers" acknowledges the relationship between value and marketability, stating: "Investors prefer an asset which is easy to sell, that is, liquid."{{cn|date=January 2017}}

The discount for lack of control is separate and distinguishable from the discount for lack of marketability. It is the valuation professional's task to quantify the lack of marketability of an interest in a privately held company. Because, in this case, the subject interest is not a controlling interest in the Company, and the owner of that interest cannot compel liquidation to convert the subject interest to cash quickly, and no established market exists on which that interest could be sold, the discount for lack of marketability is appropriate.{{cn|date=January 2017}}

Several empirical studies have been published that attempt to quantify the discount for lack of marketability. These studies include the restricted stock studies and the pre-IPO studies. &lt;ref&gt;Abudy M. and Benninga S., (2016). Valuing Restricted Stock Grants to Non-Executive Employees, Journal of Economics and Business 86, 33-51. {{DOI|10.1016/j.jeconbus.2016.04.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aggregate of these studies indicate average discounts of 35% and 50%, respectively.  Some experts believe the Lack of Control and Marketability discounts can aggregate discounts for as  much as ninety percent of a Company's fair market value, specifically with family-owned companies.{{cn|date=January 2017}}

==== Restricted stock studies ====
Restricted stocks are equity securities of public companies that are similar in all respects to the freely traded stocks of those companies except that they carry a restriction that prevents them from being traded on the open market for a certain period of time, which is usually one year (two years prior to 1990). This restriction from active trading, which amounts to a lack of marketability, is the only distinction between the restricted stock and its freely traded counterpart. Restricted stock can be traded in private transactions and usually do so at a discount. The restricted stock studies attempt to verify the difference in price at which the restricted shares trade versus the price at which the same unrestricted securities trade in the open market as of the same date.
The underlying data by which these studies arrived at their conclusions has not been made public. Consequently, it is not possible when valuing a particular company to compare the characteristics of that company to the study data. Still, the existence of a marketability discount has been recognized by valuation professionals and the Courts, and the restricted stock studies are frequently cited as empirical evidence. Notably, the lowest average discount reported by these studies was 26% and the highest average discount was 40%.

==== Option pricing ====
In addition to the restricted stock studies, U.S. publicly traded companies are able to sell stock to offshore investors (SEC [[Regulation S]], enacted in 1990) without registering the shares with the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]]. The offshore buyers may resell these shares in the United States, still without having to register the shares, after holding them for just 40 days. Typically, these shares are sold for 20% to 30% below the publicly traded share price. Some of these transactions have been reported with discounts of more than 30%, resulting from the lack of marketability. These discounts are similar to the [[marketability discounts]] inferred from the restricted and pre-IPO studies, despite the holding period being just 40 days.
Studies based on the prices paid for options have also confirmed similar discounts. If one holds [[restricted stock]] and purchases an option to sell that stock at the market price (a [[put option|put]]), the holder has, in effect, purchased marketability for the shares. The price of the [[put option|put]] is equal to the marketability discount. The range of marketability discounts derived by this study was 32% to 49%.  However, ascribing the entire value of a put option to marketability is misleading, because the primary source of put value comes from the downside price protection.  A correct economic analysis would use deeply in-the-money puts or [[Single-stock futures]], demonstrating that marketability of restricted stock is of low value because it is easy to hedge using unrestricted stock or futures trades.

==== Pre-IPO studies ====
Another approach to measure the marketability discount is to compare the prices of stock offered in [[initial public offerings]] (IPOs) to transactions in the same company's stocks prior to the IPO. Companies that are going public are required to disclose all transactions in their stocks for a period of three years prior to the IPO. The pre-IPO studies are the leading alternative to the restricted stock stocks in quantifying the marketability discount.{{cn|date=January 2017}}

The pre-IPO studies are sometimes criticized because the sample size is relatively small, the pre-IPO transactions may not be arm's length, and the financial structure and product lines of the studied companies may have changed during the three year pre-IPO window.{{cn|date=January 2017}}

=== Applying the studies ===
The studies confirm what the marketplace knows intuitively: Investors covet liquidity and loathe obstacles that impair liquidity. Prudent investors buy illiquid investments only when there is a sufficient discount in the price to increase the [[rate of return]] to a level which brings risk-reward back into balance.
The referenced studies establish a reasonable range of valuation discounts from the mid-30%s to the low 50%s. The more recent studies appeared to yield a more conservative range of discounts than older studies, which may have suffered from smaller sample sizes. Another method of quantifying the lack of marketability discount is the Quantifying Marketability Discounts Model (QMDM).

== Estimates of business value ==
The evidence on the market value of specific businesses varies widely, largely depending on reported market transactions in the equity of the firm. A fraction of businesses are "publicly traded," meaning that their equity can be purchased and sold by investors in stock markets available to the general public. Publicly traded companies on major stock markets have an easily calculated "market capitalization" that is a direct estimate of the market value of the firm's equity. Some publicly traded firms have relatively few recorded trades (including many firms traded "over the counter" or in "pink sheets"). A far larger number of firms are privately held. Normally, equity interests in these firms (which include corporations, partnerships, limited-liability companies, and some other organizational forms) are traded privately, and often irregularly. As a result, previous transactions provide limited evidence as to the current value of a private company primarily because business value changes over time, and the share price is associated with considerable uncertainty due to limited market exposure and high transaction costs.

A number of stock market indicators in the United States and other countries provide an indication of the market value of publicly traded firms. The Survey of Consumer Finance in the US also includes an estimate of household ownership of stocks, including indirect ownership through mutual funds.&lt;ref&gt;Bucks, Kennickell, Mach, &amp; Moore, "Changes in US Family Finances from 2004 to 2007: Evidence from the Survey of Consumer Finances," Federal Reserve Bulletin, February 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The 2004 and 2007 SCF indicate a growing trend in stock ownership, with 51% of households indicating a direct or indirect ownership of stocks, with the majority of those respondents indicating indirect ownership through mutual funds. Few indications are available on the value of privately held firms. Anderson (2009) recently estimated the market value of U.S. privately held and publicly traded firms, using Internal Revenue Service and SCF data.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Patrick L., "Value of Private Businesses in the United States," Business Economics (2009) 44, 87–108. {{doi|10.1057/be.2009.4}}&lt;/ref&gt; He estimates that privately held firms produced more income for investors, and had more value than publicly held firms, in 2004.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10839">In the [[law of the United States]], a '''certified question''' is a formal request by one court to one of its sister courts, usually but not always in another [[jurisdiction]], for an opinion on a [[question of law]].  

These cases typically arise when the court before which litigation is actually pending is required to decide a matter that turns on the law of another state or jurisdiction.  If that other jurisdiction's law is unclear or uncertain, a certified question can then be sent to that jurisdiction's courts to render an opinion on the question of law that arose in the court in which the actual litigation is pending.  The courts to whom these questions of law are certified are typically [[appellate court]]s or [[state supreme court]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Black's Law Dictionary]], 6th ed., "Certification of question of state law"&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Image:NYSCourtofAppeals1.JPG|thumb|right|In 1985, the [[New York Court of Appeals]], the [[state supreme court|highest court]] in [[New York (state)|New York]], was authorized by constitutional amendment to accept '''certified questions'''.]]

==History==
Historically, the procedure under which one court certifies a question to another, arises out of the distinction in the [[law of England]] between [[common law]] courts and [[court of equity|equity courts]].  At one time, these two were separate and parallel legal systems, differing in procedure and the sort of case each had primary jurisdiction over.  From time to time, a legal issue would arise in one court that fell within the other's jurisdiction and expertise; in this situation, the two courts could certify legal questions to each other.  This remains possible in the state of [[Delaware]], which continues to have a separate [[Delaware Court of Chancery|Court of Chancery]].&lt;ref&gt;''Severns v. Wilmington Medical Center, Inc''., Del.Supr., 421 A.2d 1334 (1980).  See also, Delaware Court of Chancery Rule [http://courts.delaware.gov/forms/download.aspx?id=39138 72(b)].&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Charles Dickens]] made reference to the process of the two separate courts certifying questions to each other as a part of the interminable litigation in ''[[Jarndyce v. Jarndyce]]'' which figures in the plot of ''[[Bleak House]]'':

:Equity sends questions to law, law sends questions back to equity; law finds it can’t do this, equity finds it can’t do that; neither can so much as say it can’t do anything, without this solicitor instructing and this counsel appearing for A, and that solicitor instructing and that counsel appearing for B; and so on through the whole alphabet, like the history of the apple pie.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Dickens]], ''[[Bleak House]]'', ch. 8, "[[s:Bleak House/Chapter VIII|Covering a Multitude of Sins]]"&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[Clay v. Sun Insurance Office, Ltd.]]'',&lt;ref&gt;377 U.S. 179 (1960)&lt;/ref&gt; the United States Supreme Court confronted a situation where a circuit court of appeals could not "make a competent guess" about how the Florida courts would construe an insurance statute.  The court observed that the Florida legislature had passed a statute allowing the federal courts to certify questions of state law to the Florida Supreme Court, but that the Florida courts had not yet made a rule establishing procedures under the statute.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Clay v. Sun Insurance Office, Ltd.]]'',  [http://openjurist.org/363/us/207/clay-v-sun-insurance-office-limited 377 U.S. 179], (1960)&lt;/ref&gt;  After the ''Clay'' decision, the various states began to adopt statutes or rules allowing for the certification of questions of state law to state courts.  The relatively streamlined process of sending a certified question to a state appellate court also relieves federal courts of the unwieldy procedure of [[Pullman abstention|''Pullman'' abstention]], under which Federal courts abstain from deciding on the constitutionality of state laws while litigation seeking the [[construction of laws|construction]] of those laws is pending in state courts.&lt;ref&gt;Wendy L. Watson, McKinzie Craig, and Daniel Orion Davis, [http://contentdm.ncsconline.org/cgi-bin/showfile.exe?CISOROOT=/federal&amp;CISOPTR=34 Federal Court Certification of State Law Questions]&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1967, a [[Uniform Act]] was first proposed to establish a standard procedure for certified questions.  In ''[[Lehman Bros. v. Schein]]'',&lt;ref&gt;416 U.S. 386 (1974)&lt;/ref&gt; the Supreme Court praised the certified question procedure as helping to build a cooperative judicial [[federalism]].&lt;ref&gt;''[[Lehman Bros. v. Schein]]'', [http://openjurist.org/416/us/386/lehman-brothers-v-schein-simon 416 U.S. 386] (1974)&lt;/ref&gt;  

As of 2014, forty-nine states, the [[District of Columbia]], [[Guam]], the [[Northern Mariana Islands]], and [[Puerto Rico]] have established procedures under which questions of state and local law may be certified to their courts.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Klotz, "Avoiding Inconsistent Interpretations: United States v. Kelly, the Fourth Circuit, and the Need for A Certification Procedure in North Carolina," 49 Wake Forest L Rev 1173 [2014]&lt;/ref&gt; Only the state supreme court of [[North Carolina Supreme Court|North Carolina]] lacks a certification process.&lt;ref&gt;Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Certification of questions to state courts==

===Between state and federal courts===
The typical case involving a certified question involves a Federal court, which because of [[diversity jurisdiction|diversity]], [[supplemental jurisdiction|supplemental]], or [[removal jurisdiction]] is presented with a question of state law.  In these situations, the [[Erie doctrine|''Erie'' doctrine]]&lt;ref&gt;''Erie Railroad Co. v. Tompkins'', 304 U.S. 64 (1938)&lt;/ref&gt; requires the Federal court that acquires jurisdiction over cases governed in part by state law to apply the [[substantive law]] of the states.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas R. Newman and Steven J. Ahmuty, Jr., [http://www.duanemorris.com/articles/static/newman020404.pdf "Court of Appeals Review of Certified Questions from Other Courts"]. ''New York Law Journal'', v 231, no. 23 (Feb. 4, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, the ''Erie'' doctrine requires the Federal court to predict how the courts of a given state would rule and decide a given issue.  Many states, however, allow certified questions to be addressed from the Federal court to the appellate court or [[state supreme court]] of that state, allowing the state court to decide those questions of law.  

The state courts issuing these rulings do not consider the issuance of these rulings to be [[advisory opinion]]s; they relate to genuine disputes, even though those disputes are actually pending in another court. Some state supreme courts have held that the state supreme court possesses an inherent judicial power to decide state law controversies submitted by other jurisdictions, even in the absence of a statute or rule authorizing these answers.&lt;ref&gt;Watson et al., above; citing ''In re Elliott'' (Washington Sup. Ct., 1968)&lt;/ref&gt;  Other state courts have interpreted their states' constitutions in a manner similar to the Federal interpretation of the [[cases and controversies]] clause of the [[United States Constitution]].  The Federal courts hold that this clause restricts a court's authority to rule on [[mootness|moot]] or [[ripeness|unripe]] controversies over which that court may not have jurisdiction; states that follow this rule will generally not answer certified questions of state law.  In some of those states, the power to issue rulings on certified questions has been granted to the courts by constitutional amendment.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., [[Constitution of the State of New York]], Article VII, ss. [[s:New York Constitution as of 2004#.5BCourt of appeals.3B jurisdiction.5D|3(b)(9)]], ratified 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many states, by legislation or by judicial rule making, have adopted a [[Uniform Act]] called the ''[[Uniform Certification of Questions of Law Act]]''.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., North Dakota Rules of Appellate Procedure, rule [http://www.ndcourts.com/Court/rules/appellat/rule47.htm 47]&lt;/ref&gt;  The uniform act provides that a state supreme court may answer questions of law certified to it by the United States Supreme Court, a court of appeals of the United States, a United States district court, or the highest appellate or intermediate appellate court of any other state.  The certifying court must certify the question in writing, and the state court will accept jurisdiction and decide the issue if:
#"questions of law of this state are involved in any proceeding before the certifying court which may be determinative of the proceeding"; or
#"it appears to the certifying court there is no controlling precedent in the decisions of the supreme court of this state."

===In state courts===
In some states, the name "certified question" is given to what is also known as an [[interlocutory appeal]], a procedure under which an appellate court, at its discretion, may review a decision made by a trial court that has been made before a final judgment has been entered, and that ordinarily could not be appealed directly.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Illinois Rule of Appellate Procedure [http://www.state.il.us/COURT/SupremeCourt/Rules/Art_III/ArtIII.htm 308] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100430185814/http://www.state.il.us/COURT/SupremeCourt/Rules/Art_III/ArtIII.htm |date=April 30, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Certification of questions to the United States Supreme Court==
Rule 19 of the Supreme Court Rules allows for the certification of legal questions to the [[United States Supreme Court]].  The rule provides that "a [[United States court of appeals]] may certify to this Court a question or proposition of law on which it seeks instruction for the proper decision of a case. The certificate shall contain a statement of the nature of the case and the facts on which the question or proposition of law arises. Only questions or propositions of law may be certified, and they shall be stated separately and with precision."&lt;ref&gt;Supreme Court Rules, part IV, rule [https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/supct/19.html 19]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;28 [[United States Code|U.S.C.]] 1254&lt;/ref&gt;

Certification of a question of law to the United States Supreme Court is another way, in addition to the [[writ of certiorari]], direct [[appeal]], and [[original jurisdiction]], by which cases can be brought to the docket of the Supreme Court.  It is a very infrequent procedure, and has happened only five times over the past six decades.&lt;ref&gt;Marcia Coyle, "[http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1202432706422&amp;rss=newswire Supreme Court Asked to Take Certified Question for Only Fifth Time in Six-Plus Decades]" (byline August 03, 2009; accessed Oct. 13, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tom Bell's graph showing extension of U.S. copyright term over time.svg|thumb|right|360px|Expansion of U.S. copyright term (Assuming authors create their works at age 35 and live for 70 years)]]
'''Copyright term''' is the length of time [[copyright]] subsists in a work before it passes into the [[public domain]].

==Length of copyright==
Copyright subsists for a variety of lengths in different jurisdictions. The length of the term can depend on several factors, including the type of work (e.g. [[musical composition]] or [[novel]]), whether the work has been published or not, and whether the work was created by an individual or a corporation. In most of the world, the default length of copyright is the life of the author plus either 50 or 70 years. In the United States, the term for most existing works is a fixed number of years after the date of creation or publication. In most countries (for example, the United States&lt;ref&gt;{{usc|17|305}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the United Kingdom&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=The Duration of Copyright and Rights in Performances Regulations |date=1995|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/si/si1995/Uksi_19953297_en_3.htm |title=Amendments of the UK Copyright, Designs and Patents Act 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;) copyright expires at the end of the calendar year in question.

The length and requirements for copyright duration are subject to change by legislation, and since the early 20th century there have been a number of adjustments made in various countries, which can make determining the copyright duration in a given country difficult. For example, the United States used to require copyrights to be renewed after 28 years to stay in force, and formerly required a copyright notice upon first publication to gain coverage. In Italy and France, there were post-wartime extensions that could increase the term by approximately six years in Italy and up to about 14 in France. Many countries have extended the length of their copyright terms (sometimes [[Ex post facto law|retroactively]]). International treaties, like the [[Berne Convention]], establish minimum terms for copyrights, but these only apply to the signatory countries, and individual countries may grant longer terms than those set out in a treaty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Copyright: Sacred Text, Technology, and the DMCA |last=Nimmer |first=David |publisher=Kluwer Law International |year=2003 |isbn=978-90-411-8876-2 |oclc=50606064 |page=63 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RYfRCNxgPO4C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Implications ==
===Copyright term and the public domain===
The extension of copyright term, imposes tangible restrictions on the [[public domain]]. For instance, scholar Neil Netanel argued that [[Copyright Term Extension Act]] 1998 prevented the entering of works central to [[Culture of the United States|cultural heritage of the US]] into the public domain. He argued, culturally important dissemination, recasting, or incorporation into new expression is prevented due "to the copyright holder's veto". As examples he gave the adaption of the plot from novels such as [[The Great Gatsby]] and [[Peter Pan]], the refashion of characters like [[Mickey Mouse]], or the use of [[Tin Pan Alley]] songs like "[[Let's Do It (Let's Fall in Love)]]" for documentaries about the [[Great Depression]].&lt;ref name=nethanel&gt;{{Cite book| last = Netanel| first = Neil| title = Copyright’s paradox| publisher = Oxford University Press US| date = 2008| pages = 200| url = http://www.google.com/books?id=vo9G-0iZNQIC&amp;dq=orphan+works&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s| isbn = 9780195137620 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Copyright term and orphan works===
For the millions of older copyrighted works of less enduring popularity, it is difficult, or impossible, to trace the copyright ownership and determine who holds the particular rights that would have to be licensed for the use of the work. The problem of such [[orphan works]] stems from the extension of copyright term and the lack of requirement for the copyright owner to renew or [[Copyright registration|register their copyright]].&lt;ref name=nethanel/&gt; In order to tackle this perceived problem some jurisdictions have [[Copyright reform|revised their copyright laws]] to allow use of orphaned works, after diligent searches.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/48/chapter/III/crossheading/orphan-works] Copyright Designs and Patents Act 1988, s44B&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception and discussion==
Discussions about the optimal length of the copyright term (e.g. regarding the copyrights incentive for creative production&lt;ref name="petra moser"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130214025845/http://www.wipo.int/edocs/mdocs/mdocs/en/wipo_ip_econ_ge_5_12/wipo_ip_econ_ge_5_12_ref_moser.pdf DEAD POETS’ PROPERTY - THE COPYRIGHT ACT OF 1814 AND THE PRICE OF LITERATURE IN THE ROMANTIC PERIOD] XING LI,STANFORD UNIVERSITY, MEGAN MACGARVIE, BOSTON UNIVERSITY AND NBER, AND PETRA MOSER, STANFORD UNIVERSITY AND NBER (NOVEMBER 14, 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;) is a significant part of public and scientific discourse and reception.&lt;ref name="JASSS"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/node/15868004 Copyright and wrong - Why the rules on copyright need to return to their roots] on [[The Economist]] ''"The notion that lengthening copyright increases creativity is questionable, however. Authors and artists do not generally consult the statute books before deciding whether or not to pick up pen or paintbrush. And overlong copyrights often limit, rather than encourage, a work's dissemination, impact and influence."'' (Apr 8th 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.becker-posner-blog.com/2012/09/do-patent-and-copyright-law-restrict-competition-and-creativity-excessively-posner.html Do patent and copyright law restrict competition and creativity excessively?] on [[University of Chicago Law School]] by Becker &amp; Posner ''"I am concerned that both patent and copyright protection, though particularly the former, may be excessive."''

If anything, patents inhibit innovation. |publisher=[[The Register]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the earlier and often cited positions is from the British politician [[Thomas Babington Macaulay]] who argued in an 1841 speech in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] that copyright is a [[monopoly]] and as such has generally negative effects on society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://homepages.law.asu.edu/~dkarjala/OpposingCopyrightExtension/commentary/MacaulaySpeeches.html MacaulaySpeeches] on law.asu.edu&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thepublicdomain.org/2014/07/24/macaulay-on-copyright/ macaulay-on-copyright] on thepublicdomain.org&lt;/ref&gt; Although Macaulay's speech is widely reported, the reaction to it in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] is hard to find – Ricketson reports that following Macaulay's claims that the heirs of certain authors would block publication of their works:

:"At this point, the debate in the House of Commons fell into farce because there were claims by other speakers that they had no doubts (based on their own personal knowledge) that Richardson and Boswell's descendants would still have done the right thing and allowed reprinting, however much they abhorred their ancestors' works!"&lt;ref&gt;Sam Ricketson, The copyright term, International Review of Intellectual Property and Competition Law (1992), 753, p767.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also worth noting that Macaulay is arguing here against term extension, he is not arguing against copyright. This point is well made by Macaulay himself:

:"The advantages arising from a system of copyright are obvious. It is desirable that we should have a supply of good books: we cannot have such a supply unless men of letters are liberally remunerated; and the least objectionable way of remunerating them is by means of copyright."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Babington Macaulay, Speeches of Lord Macaulay, Longman, Green, Longman and Roberts, 1860, p232.&lt;/ref&gt;

Liebowitz describes use of the term monopoly in relation to copyright as misleading, but "rhetorically effective".&lt;ref&gt;Stan Liebowitz, A critique of copyright criticism, George Mason Law Review, vol 22:4:943 (2015), p958.&lt;/ref&gt; While Towse writes that a more appropriate term is '[[monopolistic competition]]'.&lt;ref&gt;Ruth Towse, Copyright, risk and the artist: an economic approach to policy for artists, International Journal of Cultural Policy, 6:1:91 (1999), p105, note 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, a paper by [[Rufus Pollock]] of [[University of Cambridge]] scientifically quantified the optimal copyright term length at 15 years, significantly shorter than any currently existing copyright term, via an economical model with [[U-statistic|empirically-estimable parameter]]s.&lt;ref name="HoEoC"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archivedate=2013-02-21 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130221124708/http://rufuspollock.org/economics/papers/optimal_copyright_over_time.pdf |url=http://rufuspollock.org/economics/papers/optimal_copyright_term.pdf |title=OPTIMAL COPYRIGHT OVER TIME: TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE AND THE STOCK OF WORKS |first=Rufus |last=Pollock |publisher=[[University of Cambridge]] |date=2007-10-01 |accessdate=2015-01-11 |authorlink=Rufus Pollock |quote=''The optimal level for copyright has been a matter for extensive debate over the last decade. Using a parsimonious theoretical model this paper contributes several new results of relevance to this debate. In particular we demonstrate that (a) optimal copyright is likely to fall as the production costs of `originals' decline (for example as a result of digitization) (b) technological change which reduces costs of production may imply a decrease or a decrease in optimal levels of protection (this contrasts with a large number of commentators, particularly in the copyright industries, who have argued that such change necessitates increases in protection) (c) the optimal level of copyright will, in general, fall over time as the stock of work increases.''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archivedate=2013-01-12 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130112152530/http://rufuspollock.org/economics/papers/optimal_copyright_term.pdf |url=http://rufuspollock.org/economics/papers/optimal_copyright_term.pdf |title=FOREVER MINUS A DAY?

Based on a novel approach we derive an explicit formula which characterises the optimal term as a function of a few key and, most importantly, empirically-estimable parameters. Using existing data on recordings and books we obtain a point estimate of around 15 years for optimal copyright term with a 99% confidence interval extending up to 38 years. This is substantially shorter than any current copyright term and implies that existing terms are too long.''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 scholar Petra Moser concluded in a paper on the impact of the copyright extension on the British [[Copyright Act 1814|Copyright Act of 1814]] that "longer copyrights raise the costs of accessing intellectual assets for consumers and other firms, which may discourage the diffusion of knowledge and decelerate the pace of cumulative innovation and [[Learning-by-doing (economics)|learning-by-doing]]."&lt;ref name="petra moser"/&gt;

In 2014 a [[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]] article about the existence of [[Orphaned works|orphaned]] classical [[video game]]s and the suggestion of letting them enter the public domain after 20 years, raised a controversial public debate about copyright terms and public domain&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2014/01/29/gogs-time-machine-sale-lets-you-control-time-itself/ |title=GOG’s Time Machine Sale Lets You CONTROL TIME ITSELF |first=John |last=Walker |date=2014-01-29 |accessdate=2016-01-30 |publisher=[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]] |quote=''As someone who desperately pines for the PD model that drove creativity before the copyright industry malevolently took over the planet, it saddens my heart that a game two decades old isn’t released into the world.''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2014/02/03/editorial-why-games-should-enter-the-public-domain/ |title=Editorial: Why Games Should Enter The Public Domain |first=John |last=Walker |date=2014-02-03 |accessdate=2016-01-30 |publisher=[[Rock, Paper, Shotgun]] |quote=''games more than a couple of decades old aren’t entering the public domain.

John Walker argues that perhaps a good cutoff would be 20 years before an "idea" enters the public domain."'' (February 03, 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

A March 2015 published [[Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation]] paper, analysed with a simulated model the relationship of scientific knowledge creation to copyright term length and concluded a decreased knowledge production on copyright term increases for the analysed context.&lt;ref name="JASSS"&gt;[http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/18/2/23.html Does Longer Copyright Protection Help or Hurt Scientific Knowledge Creation?] [[Journal of Artificial Societies and Social Simulation]] 18 (2) 23 DOI: 10.18564/jasss.2720 ''"The prevailing trend in most simulations was that increasing the copyright term resulted decreased knowledge production."'' (31-Mar-2015)&lt;/ref&gt;

As a curiosity, the work ''[[Peter and Wendy#Copyright status|Peter Pan, or The Boy Who Wouldn't Grow Up]]'' is subject in the UK to a special clause in the [[Copyright Designs and Patents Act 1988]]&lt;ref&gt;Copyright Designs and Patents Act 1988 s301 and schedule 6.&lt;/ref&gt; that granted [[Great Ormond Street Hospital]] a right to royalty in perpetuity. [[J M Barrie]] had gifted the copyright to the work to the hospital in 1929. The different copyright terms in the various jurisdictions has led to some disputes involving derivative works created and/or sold elsewhere in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/about/cases/emily_somma_v_gosh_peter_.shtml  |title=Stanford Center for Internet and Society |publisher=Web.archive.org |accessdate=2010-05-08 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061027134508/http://cyberlaw.stanford.edu/about/cases/emily_somma_v_gosh_peter_.shtml |archivedate = 2006-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''European Cultural Convention''' is an international treaty for EU and EU accession states to strengthen, deepen and further develop a European Culture, by using local culture as a starting point, setting common goals and a plan of action, to reach an integrated European society, celebrating [[universal values]], rights and diversity.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/treaty/018&lt;/ref&gt;

The European Cultural Convention was opened for signature by the [[Council of Europe]] in Paris on 19 December 1954.&lt;ref name=parties&gt;{{cite web|url=http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/Commun/ChercheSig.asp?NT=018&amp;CM=8&amp;DF=21/01/2013&amp;CL=ENG|work=Council of Europe|title=European Cultural Convention, CETS No.: 018|date=18 January 2013|accessdate=21 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its signature is one of the conditions for becoming a participating state in the [[Bologna Process]] and its [[European Higher Education Area]] (EHEA). The term "Convention" is used as a synonym for an international legal treaty.

The convention has been ratified by all 47 member states of the Council of Europe; it has also been ratified by [[Belarus]], the [[Holy See]], and [[Kazakhstan]].

'''FairShare''' is an idea for a voluntary [[investment]]-based [[patronage]] system to replace [[patents]] and [[copyright]] while still ensuring that artists are fairly compensated.  It was designed by [[Freenet]] creator [[Ian Clarke (computer scientist)|Ian Clarke]], [[Steven Starr]] and Rob Kramer in 2000, in response to allegations that artists would not receive adequate compensation for their work without enforceable copyrights. Starr came up with the name.

In the FairShare system, the investor/patrons would provide [[venture capital]].  Clarke envisions that 45% of the money invested in a given artist would go directly to that artist, while another 45% would be given to previous investors.  The remaining 10% would be kept by the maintainers of each FairShare service company.

In some ways this model is similar to a [[pyramid scheme]], but Clarke counters that a vital difference is that nobody would be promised a return on their investment.  He argues that regardless of any profits, each patron would have the satisfaction of knowing that they supported an artist whose work they appreciate.  Also, earlier investors would profit more, thus rewarding them for investing in artists before they became more popular.  The early investors would serve a similar role to studios' talent scouts.

The '''Fundamental Orders''' were adopted by the [[Connecticut Colony]] council on January 14, 1639 [[Old Style|OS]] (January 24, 1639 [[New Style|NS]]).&lt;ref&gt;The January 14, 1639 date was in the old style [[Julian Calendar]] before conversion to the new style [[Gregorian Calendar]]. See [[Old Style and New Style dates]] for an explanation of the date adjustment.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = The Columbia Encyclopedia|edition=Sixth|publisher = ia University Press|year = 2005|url = http://www.bartleby.com/65/fu/Fundamen.html|accessdate = 2006-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fundamental orders describe the government set up by the [[Connecticut River]] [[New England town|towns]], setting its structure and powers. They wanted the government to have access to the open ocean for trading.

The Orders have the features of a written [[Constitution (political)|constitution]] and are considered by one author to be the first written Constitution in the [[Western culture|Western tradition]], although the Mayflower compact has an equal claim 19 years before.&lt;ref name="isbn0-945612-19-2"&gt;{{cite book

Connecticut historian [[John Fiske (philosopher)|John Fiske]] was the first to claim that the Fundamental Orders were the first written Constitution, a claim disputed by some modern historians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sots.ct.gov/sots/cwp/view.asp?a=3188&amp;q=392608 |title=STATE OF CONNECTICUT Sites º Seals º Symbols |accessdate=2008-01-25 |author=[[Secretary of the State of Connecticut]]|year=2007 |work=the Connecticut State Register and Manual |publisher=[[State of Connecticut]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The orders were transcribed into the official [[colony]] records by the colony's secretary [[Thomas Welles]]. It was a Constitution the government that [[Massachusetts]] had set up. However, this Order gave men more [[Suffrage|voting rights]] and made more men eligible to run for elected positions.

==History==

In the year of 1635, a group of [[Puritans]] and others who were dissatisfied with the rate of [[Anglican]] reforms sought to establish an ecclesiastical society subject to their own rules and regulations. The [[Massachusetts General Court]] granted them permission to settle the cities of [[Windsor, Connecticut|Windsor]], [[Wethersfield, Connecticut|Wethersfield]], and [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Horton |first=Wesley W. |authorlink=Wesley W. Horton |title=The Connecticut State Constitution: A Reference Guide |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rc_Iag6QgaEC&amp;pg=PA2&amp;lpg=PA2&amp;dq=%22the+March+Commission%22+Connecticut&amp;ct=result#PPA2,M1 |accessdate=2008-09-17 |series=Reference guides to the state constitutions of the United States |volume=no. 17 |date=1993-06-30 |publisher=[[Greenwood Press]] |location=[[Westport, Connecticut]] |isbn=0-313-28565-9 |oclc=27066290 |pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ownership of the land was called into dispute by the English holders of the Warwick Patent of 1631. The Massachusetts General Court established the March Commission to mediate the dispute, and named [[Roger Ludlow]] as its head. The Commission named eight magistrates from the Connecticut towns to implement a legal system. The March commission expired in March 1636, after which the settlers continued to self-govern. 

On May 29, 1638, Ludlow wrote to [[Governor of Massachusetts|Massachusetts Governor]] Winthrop that the colonists wanted to "unite ourselves to walk and lie peaceably and lovingly together." Ludlow and other principals drafted the Fundamental Orders, which were adopted on January 14, 1639 [[Old Style|OS]] (January 24, 1639 [[New Style|NS]]) and established Connecticut as a self-ruled colony. Major [[John Mason (c. 1600–1672)|John Mason]] was a magistrate and is credited with being one of the writers of this document.

There is no record of the debates or proceedings of the drafting or enactment of the Fundamental Orders. &lt;!--- The following sentence has been hidden because: A) it does not cite anyone who "postulates" this; B) it is an absurd suggestion, as the British crown was not opposed to the Colonists creating such documents as this and the Mayflower Compact. Please do not put this sentence back in unless you have citations to support it: It is postulated that the framers wished to remain anonymous to avoid retaliation by the English authorities. ---&gt;According to John Taylor:&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, John M., Roger Ludlow the Colonial Lawmaker, 1900, Google Book Search&lt;/ref&gt;. Puritans used to punish the townspeople for having different beliefs or wanting a new religion.


&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The men of the three towns were a law unto themselves. It is known that they were in earnest for the establishment of a government on broad lines; and it is certain that the ministers and captains, the magistrates and men of affairs, forceful in the settlements from the beginning, were the men who took the lead, guided the discussions, and found the root of the whole matter in the first written declaration of independence in these historical orders."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Individual rights ==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2013}}
The Fundamental Orders of Connecticut is a short document, but contains some principles that were later applied in creating the [[United States government]]. Government is based in the [[Individual rights|rights of an individual]], and the orders spell out some of those rights, as well as how they are ensured by the government. It provides that all free men share in electing their magistrates, and uses secret, paper ballots. It states the powers of the government, and some limits within which that power is exercised.

In one sense, the Fundamental Orders were replaced by a [[Royal Charter]] in 1662, however the major outline of the charter was written in Connecticut and embodied the Orders' rights and mechanics. It was carried to England by Governor [[John Winthrop, the Younger|John Winthrop]] and basically approved by the British King, [[Charles II of England|Charles II]]. The colonists generally viewed the charter as a continuation and [[surety]] for their Fundamental Orders. Later on, the [[Charter Oak]] got its name when that charter was taken from [[Jeremy Adams|Jeremy Adams's]] tavern and supposedly hidden in an oak tree, rather than it be surrendered to the agents of [[James II and VII|James II]], who intended to annex Connecticut to the more centralized [[Dominion of New England]].

Today, the individual rights in the Orders, with others added over the years, are still included as a "Declaration of Rights" in the first article of the current [[Connecticut Constitution]], adopted in 1965.

'''The Hunting Act 2004''' (c 37) is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] which bans the [[hunting]] of [[Wildlife|wild]] [[mammal]]s (notably [[fox]]es, [[red deer|deer]], [[European Hare|hares]] and [[American mink|mink]]) with [[dog]]s in [[England and Wales]]; the Act does not cover the use of dogs in the process of flushing out an unidentified wild mammal,&lt;ref name="High Court case"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2009/105.html|title=Director of Public Prosecutions (Crown Prosecution Service CCU South West) v Anthony Wright; The Queen on the Application of Maurice Scott, Peter Heard &amp; Donald Summersgill v Taunton Deane Magistrates' Court [2009] EWHC 105 (Admin)|date=4 February 2009|publisher=British and Irish Legal Information Institute|accessdate=15 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; nor does it affect [[drag hunting]], where hounds are trained to follow an artificial [[Odor|scent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmstand/f/st030225/pm/30225s12.htm|title=Official Report, Commons|date=25 February 2003|publisher=House of Commons|accessdate=26 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act came into force on 18 February 2005. The pursuit of foxes with hounds, other than to flush out to be shot, had been banned in [[Scotland]] two years earlier by the [[Protection of Wild Mammals (Scotland) Act 2002]]. Such hunting remains permitted by the law in [[Northern Ireland]], where the Act does not apply.

==History==

===Background===
{{see also|Fox hunting legislation}}
Several UK laws on animal welfare, such as the [[Protection of Animals Act 1911]], the Protection of Badgers Act 1992 and the Wild Mammals (Protection) Act 1996 contained specific exemptions for hunting activities, thereby preventing prosecutions of other hunts activities that might otherwise have been considered cruel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1992/51/crossheading/exceptions-and-licences|title=Protection of Badgers Act 1992|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|accessdate=22 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1996/3/section/2 The National Archives: "Wild Mammals (Protection) Act 1996: Section 2: Exceptions from offence under the Act.]"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://politics.theguardian.com/homeaffairs/page/0,,650062,00.html|title=Timeline: attempts to ban hunting - Special Reports - guardian.co.uk Politics|website=politics.theguardian.com|accessdate=22 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nwt.org.uk/node/2999|title=Wild Mammals and the Law - Northumberland Wildlife Trust|website=www.nwt.org.uk|accessdate=22 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many earlier attempts had been made to ban hunting. Two [[private member's bill]]s to ban, or restrict, hunting were introduced in 1949, but one was withdrawn and the other defeated on its [[second reading]] in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]].&lt;ref name="Tichelar"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=502052# |author=Tichelar, M. |year=2006 |title='Putting Animals into Politics: The Labour Party and Hunting in the First Half of the Twentieth Century |journal=Rural History |volume=17 |pages=213–234 |doi=10.1017/S0956793306001889 |issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Labour government appointed the Scott Henderson Inquiry&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Scott Henderson|year=1951|title=Report of the Committee on Cruelty to Wild Animals|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; to investigate all forms of hunting. Opponents of hunting claimed that the membership of the committee was chosen to produce a pro-hunting report.&lt;ref name="Tichelar"/&gt; The inquiry reported its view that "[[Fox hunting]] makes a very important contribution to the control of foxes, and involves less cruelty than most other methods of controlling them. It should therefore be allowed to continue."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/1846577.stm|publisher=BBC|date=17 February 2005|accessdate=19 February 2008|title=Timeline: Hunting row}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Twice, in 1969 and in 1975, the House of Commons voted in favour of bills to ban [[hare coursing]], but neither bill became law. Three further private member's bills were introduced by [[Kevin McNamara (politician)|Kevin McNamara]] in 1992 (Wild Mammals (Protection) Bill), by [[Tony Banks, Baron Stratford|Tony Banks]] in 1993 (Fox Hunting (Abolition) Bill), and by [[John McFall, Baron McFall of Alcluith|John McFall]] in 1995 (Wild Mammals (Protection) Bill)—all of which failed to go on to become law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.org.uk/images/pdfs/JamieFletcher.ExecutiveSovereigntyinourConstitution.pdf |author=Fletcher, J. |title=Executive Sovereignty in our Constitution |publisher=Justice |accessdate=19 February 2008 |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080228182044/http://www.justice.org.uk/images/pdfs/JamieFletcher.ExecutiveSovereigntyinourConstitution.pdf |archivedate=28 February 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Protection of Wild Mammals (Scotland) Act 2002]] made it illegal to chase or deliberately kill mammals with dogs in 2002. There are a number of differences between the two Acts: The Scottish Act does not place a two dog limit on the flushing of a mammal to guns in order to shoot it; with respect to flushing foxes above ground to guns to shoot them, only the Scottish Act permits this to be done to protect game birds; with respect to flushing foxes below ground to guns to shoot them, only the Scottish Act permits this to be done to protect livestock. The Scottish Act allows someone convicted to be sentenced for up to six months in prison, there is no such power in the Hunting Act 2004.&lt;ref name="Scottish Act"/&gt;

At the time of this bill fox hunting with hounds was "not practised or is largely banned" in Belgium, Denmark, Finland, Germany, Norway, Spain and Sweden,&lt;ref name="burns"&gt;{{cite web|date=9 June 2000 |publisher=Her Majesty's Stationery Office |authors=Lord Burns, Dr Victoria Edwards, Professor Sir John Marsh, Lord Soulsby of Swaffham Prior; Professor Michael Winter |title=The Final Report of the Committee of Inquiry into Hunting with Dogs in England and Wales |url=http://www.defra.gov.uk/rural/hunting/inquiry/mainsections/huntingreport.htm |accessdate=10 February 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090410213249/http://www.defra.gov.uk/rural/hunting/inquiry/mainsections/huntingreport.htm |archivedate=10 April 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; but was allowed in Australia, Canada, France, India, Ireland, Italy, Russia and the USA.&lt;ref name="BBC1"&gt;{{cite news|publisher=BBC News|title=Fox hunting worldwide|date=16 September 1999|accessdate=2007-10-05|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/428122.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drafting===
[[Labour Party (UK)|The Labour Party]] came to power in 1997 with a manifesto saying, "We will ensure greater protection for wildlife. We have advocated new measures to promote [[animal welfare]], including a [[Conscience vote|free vote]] in Parliament on whether hunting with hounds should be banned."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/election97/background/parties/manlab/8labmanhertrans.html |publisher=BBC |year=1997 |accessdate=19 February 2008 |title=The Labour Party's Manifesto 1997 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071220200028/http://www.bbc.co.uk/election97/background/parties/manlab/8labmanhertrans.html |archivedate=20 December 2007 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A new private member's bill, introduced by [[Michael Foster (Worcester MP)|Michael Foster MP]], received a second reading with 411 MPs voting in support, but failed due to lack of parliamentary time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/390091.stm|publisher=BBC|title=How hunting ban went to the dogs|date=9 July 1999|accessdate=19 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Burns Inquiry|Burns Report]] in 2000 concluded that forms of fox hunting "seriously compromise the welfare of the fox",&lt;ref name="burns"/&gt; but (in line with its remit) did not draw any conclusion on whether hunting should be banned or should continue. In a later debate in the House of Lords, the inquiry chairman, [[Terence Burns, Baron Burns|Lord Burns]] also stated that "Naturally, people ask whether we were implying that hunting is cruel... The short answer to that question is no. There was not sufficient verifiable evidence or data safely to reach views about cruelty. It is a complex area."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200001/ldhansrd/vo010312/text/10312-06.htm#10312-06_para26|title=Official Report, Lords|date=12 March 2001|accessdate=19 February 2008|publisher=House of Lords|author=Burns, T.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the Burns inquiry, the Government introduced an 'options bill' which allowed each House of Parliament to choose between a ban, licensed hunting, and [[Industry self-regulation|self-regulation]]. The [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]] voted for a banning bill and the [[House of Lords]] for self-regulation. The [[United Kingdom general election, 2001|2001 general election]] was then called and the bill ran out of parliamentary time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/1393104.stm|publisher=BBC|title=Hunt battle set to return|date=17 June 2001|accessdate=19 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In what he described as an attempt to raise animal welfare standards at the same time, and as an alternative to legislation that specifically targeted hunting, [[Bernard Donoughue, Baron Donoughue|Lord Donoughue]] proposed the Wild Mammals (Protection) (Amendment) Bill.[https://web.archive.org/web/20120805134859/http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/ld200001/ldbills/023/2001023.htm] This would have made it the case that "any person who intentionally inflicts, or causes or procures, unnecessary suffering on or to any wild mammal shall be guilty of an offence."  A matching Bill was introduced in the Commons with the support of The Middle Way Group (see below).  Both bills failed to become law as they were blocked by Labour members who wanted a specific hunting ban. [[Animal welfare]] groups such as the [[League Against Cruel Sports]] criticised the Bill on two grounds. Firstly, they opposed the exemption in the Bill for activities undertaken "in accordance with an approved code of conduct". Secondly, they argued that, if an activity was inherently cruel, it should be deemed as such by Parliament, rather than prosecutors having to argue and prove cruelty in every court case.

Following a series of evidence hearings in 2002,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defra.gov.uk/rural/hunting/huntinghearings.htm |title=Hunting Hearings |publisher=Defra |date=10 December 2002 |accessdate=19 February 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071113040740/http://www.defra.gov.uk/rural/hunting/huntinghearings.htm |archivedate=13 November 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; on 3 December 2002, [[Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs|DEFRA]] [[Minister of State]] for Rural Affairs [[Alun Michael]] introduced a bill which would have allowed some licensed hunting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/2578151.stm|title=Hunting vote sparks angry scenes|publisher=BBC|date=17 December 2002|accessdate=19 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Commons passed an amendment proposed by Tony Banks to ban hunting entirely in July 2003 with a majority of 208 in a free vote but was then rejected by the House of Lords by a majority of 212 in October 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3208776.stm|publisher=BBC|title=Lords rejects hunting ban|date=12 October 2003|accessdate=19 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Voting, conflict with the Lords and royal assent===
A bill identical to the one passed by the House of Commons in 2003 was reintroduced to the Commons on 9 September 2004.

On 15 September 2004, the day of the final vote (third reading) of this controversial Act, two protesters staged the first invasion of the House of Commons chamber since [[Charles I of England|King Charles I]] in 1641. It was quickly quelled by Parliamentary officials, but led to a review of parliamentary security, given that it was the second breach of the security of the chamber in four months ([[Fathers 4 Justice]] activists had thrown purple flour in the Commons four months earlier).  Simultaneously, a demonstration of between 8,000 and 10,000 people, including protesters from the [[Countryside Alliance]] filled Parliament Square outside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/3656524.stm|title=Pro-hunt protesters storm Commons|date=15 September 2004|publisher=|accessdate=22 January 2018|via=news.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Later, John Holliday wrote for the ''Guardian'' an essay on his actions.&lt;ref name=holliday&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2004/sep/28/houseofcommons.immigrationpolicy |newspaper=The Guardian |title=Pride not prejudice |first=John |last=Holliday |date=28 September 2004 |accessdate=19 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 November, on one of the days of the Parliamentary session, the Lords again insisted on its amendments to the main Bill. In the Commons, the Government's last-ditch attempt to compromise on a delay until 31 July 2007 won the support of only 46 MPs, although the delay until 2006 was inserted in the Bill. The Lords who would have had to have accepted the Commons' other amendments (including the principle of a ban on hunting) and dues rejected the proposal by 153 to 114.

With the Lords and Commons unable to come to agreement by the end of the Parliamentary year the [[Speaker of the British House of Commons|Speaker of the House of Commons]], [[Michael Martin, Baron Martin of Springburn|Michael Martin]], invoked the [[Parliament Acts 1911 and 1949]], an infrequently used legislative device that allows the Commons to overrule the Lords where agreement can not be reached.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/4015075.stm|publisher=BBC|title=Fox hunting ban looks inevitable|date=17 November 2004|accessdate=19 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hunting Act was only the seventh statute since 1911 enacted using these provisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite hansard |date=8 April 2010 |place=House of Lords |speaker=Baroness Royall of Blaisdon |url=https://www.theyworkforyou.com/wrans/?id=2010-04-08a.462.0 |title=Parliament Acts |column=462–463 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The House of Lords was criticised for undemocratically blocking the legislation;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article507683.ece|publisher=The Times|title=High Court upholds Hunting ban |date=28 January 2005|accessdate=17 November 2011|location=London|first1=Charles|last1=Bremner|first2=David|last2=Robertson}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, other newspapers and broadcasters condemned [[Tony Blair]]'s Labour administration for giving in to what they perceived as the prejudicial views of anti-hunting Labour backbenchers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4024503.stm|publisher=BBC|title=Hunters fall prey to Parliament |date=19 November 2004|accessdate=19 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The act came into force on 18 February 2005, three calendar months after it received royal assent.&lt;ref&gt;The [[Interpretation Act 1978]], section 5 and Schedule 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hare v Gocher [1962] 2 QB 641, [1962] 2 All ER 673; Trow v Ind Coope (West Midlands) Ltd [1967] 2 QB 899 at 909, [1967] 2 All ER 900, [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|CA]].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Failed challenges===
Challenges to the Act which questioning the legality of the [[Parliament Act 1949]] in the [[High Court of Justice of England and Wales|High Court]] and [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]] failed (for example ''[[Jackson v Attorney General]]'') The [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|House of Lords]] in their judicial capacity agreed with the lower courts in a judgment delivered in October 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/2005/56.html|title=Jackson and others v.

An application for [[judicial review]] was made to the [[High Court of England and Wales]] which argued that the [[anti-hunting]] legislation contravenes individual human or [[Property|property rights]] protected in the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] (ECHR) and under [[European Community law]] and on grounds of the [[Four Freedoms (European Union)|free movement of goods and services]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.countryside-alliance.org/images/stories/pdf/L_legal_challenges_update_19_July_2005.pdf |title=Legal challenges update |publisher=Countryside Alliance |date=19 July 2005 |format=PDF }}{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The application was dismissed by the High Court in July 2005,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2005/1677.html|title=The Countryside Alliance and others v.

==Penalties and enforcement==
A person guilty of an offence under this Act is liable on [[summary conviction]] to a fine not exceeding level 5 on the [[Standard scale#United Kingdom|standard scale]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Hunting Act 2004, section 6|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2004/37/section/6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Data from the Ministry of Justice from 2005–2014 shows that 378 people have been convicted of Hunting Act offences over that period, but only 24 of the offenders were involved with registered hunts. More than 94% of Hunting Act convictions did not involve hunts but were related to poaching or other casual hunting activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.countryside-alliance.org/new-survey-shows-hunting-in-good-heart/ |publisher=Countryside Alliance |title=New survey shows hunting in good heart |date=17 December 2015 |accessdate=1 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Justice Minister [[Crispin Blunt]] said in a written answer to Parliament in June 2011 that "it is not possible to separately identify those specific cases proceeded against under the Hunting Act 2004 related to hunts recognised and regulated by the Council of Hunting Associations" since "statistical information available centrally does not include the circumstances of each case."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201011/cmhansrd/cm110607/text/110607w0006.htm#11060826003939|publisher=Hansard|title=Convictions: Hunting|accessdate=17 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2014, the number of successful convictions under the act had risen to 430.&lt;ref name="Professionals"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://huntingact.org/?q=node/18|title=The hunting act: A website for enforcement professionals|accessdate=December 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Animal welfare groups such as the [[RSPCA]], [[IFAW]] and the [[League Against Cruel Sports]] monitor some hunts, which they believe may be breaking the law. Small, local groups of [[Hunt Monitors]], made up of independent, private individuals, also engage in regular hunt monitoring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.horseandhound.co.uk/news/397/309421.html |publisher=Horse and Hound |title=RSPCA to prosecute Heythrop huntsman |accessdate=17 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120803213306/http://www.horseandhound.co.uk/news/397/309421.html |archivedate=3 August 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 the League Against Cruel Sports complained that "On several occasions over the last few years, we have provided what we believed to be good evidence to Devon &amp; Cornwall Police, but the police haven’t even moved from the starting blocks by interviewing suspects.

[[Police|Police forces]] have said, on a number of occasions, that enforcement of the Hunting Act 2004 like much wildlife crime is a low priority for them, although they say that they will enforce the law. However, the Police's UK National Wildlife Crime Unit has said that policing of hunting should be a priority for forces in some areas of the country, most notably the South West.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.league.org.uk/uploads/media/17/8505.pdf |publisher=League Against Cruel Sports |title=Report: The 2010/2011 Hunting Season |date=18 May 2011 |accessdate=17 November 2011 }}{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Key court cases involving registered hunts==

===Tony Wright (Exmoor Foxhounds): 2006–09===
Tony Wright, huntsman for the Exmoor Foxhounds, was convicted of illegal hunting with dogs in Barnstaple magistrates court in August 2006 in a private prosecution by the League Against Cruel Sports,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/aug/04/hunting.ukcrime|title=Man found guilty of illegal fox hunting | location=London | work=The Guardian|date=4 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was then acquitted by the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] on appeal.&lt;ref name="High Court case"/&gt; The appeal took place at the request of the [[Crown Prosecution Service]] who wished to determine if it is necessary for the prosecution to demonstrate that any hunting taking place was not exempt, or for the defence to prove that it was exempt; also to define what was meant by "hunting". The High Court ruled that it was necessary for the prosecution to prove that the conditions of the exemption had not been met. It also ruled that for the offence of "hunting a wild mammal" to take place there must be an identifiable mammal.&lt;ref name="High Court case"/&gt;

=== Julian Barnfield (Heythrop Hunt): 2009 ===
Charges of illegal hunting of a fox between November 2008 and February 2009 brought against Julian Barnfield of the Heythrop Hunt by the [[Crown Prosecution Service]] were dropped in March 2009 in response to the earlier High Court ruling in the Tony Wright case that 'searching' for a mammal was not hunting and that "hunting could only be an 'intentional' activity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1161144/David-Camerons-friend-escapes-hunting-trial-High-Court-rules-searching-mammals-legal.html|title=David Cameron's friend escapes hunting trial as High Court rules 'searching' for mammals is legal | location=London | work=Daily Mail|date=20 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Derek Hopkins and Kevin Allen (Fernie Hunt): 2011 ===
Huntsman Derek Hopkins and terrierman Kevin Allen, employees of the Fernie Hunt from [[Great Bowden]], were convicted of illegal hunting in October 2011.&lt;ref name=Fernie&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thisisleicestershire.co.uk/Hunt-pair-guilty-digging-fox-sett/story-12025427-detail/story.html|title=Two Fernie Hunt employees are found guilty of digging fox out of sett|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130813165351/http://www.thisisleicestershire.co.uk/Hunt-pair-guilty-digging-fox-sett/story-12025427-detail/story.html|archivedate=13 August 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also lost their appeal, partly based on video evidence collected by the [[League Against Cruel Sports]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lutterworthmail.co.uk/news/crime/hunt_appeal_dismissed_with_video_1_3160126|publisher=Lutterworth Mail|title=Hunt appeal dismissed, with VIDEO |accessdate=17 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the third successful prosecution for illegal fox hunting using the 2004 Act.&lt;ref name=Fernie/&gt;

=== Crawley and Horsham Hunt: 2008–2013 ===

In 2008, the Crawley and Horsham Hunt launched a legal action in the High Court for trespass, nuisance, and harassment against Simon and Jane Wild of West Sussex Wildlife Protection and West Sussex Badger Protection Group. The hunt used Timothy Lawson-Cruttenden, an expert in the use of the Protection from Harassment Act 1997 in such cases. This was viewed as a test case and received support from the Countryside Alliance, the Master of Foxhounds Association and 80 landowners and if successful was planned to lead to a request for an injunction against everyone associated with these groups from interfering with the hunt. The defendants claimed to have evidence of illegal hunting taking place and were asking the court to accept this as a defence to the Harassment Act action. The original judge, Justice Cranston, stepped down in July 2008 due to earlier comments made in support of the ban made while an MP. During the second trial it was reported that the judge dismissed nuisance and trespass, because they had "fundamental defects", leaving only harassment. It was also reported that the protestors, using an undercover infiltrator, had been able to get hold of conclusive evidence that the claimants were engaged in illegal fox hunting. The principal plaintiff, Simon Greenwood, was filmed using his hounds to chase a fox to ground and then call in terrier-men to dig it out and throw it to the hounds. The plaintiffs dropped the case in July 2009, and agreed to pay costs estimated at over £120,000.&lt;ref name=drops_court_case&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theargus.co.uk/news/4494900.Sussex_hunt_drops_court_case_against_activists/|title=Sussex hunt drops court case against activists}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Officials of the [[Crawley and Horsham Hunt]] were found guilty in May 2012 of Hunting Act offences: professional huntsman Andrew Phillis, joint master Neill Millard and the hunt secretary Rachel Holdsworth were convicted on a total of five charges of illegally hunting. Millard and Holdsworth were fined £1000 each and both ordered to pay £2500 costs. Phillis was later sentenced to a £500 fine and £2500 costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/may/14/hunt-members-guilty-fox-hounds?newsfeed=true|title=Hunt members found guilty of illegally pursuing fox with hounds | location=London | work=The Guardian|first=Owen|last=Bowcott|date=14 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2013, professional huntsman Nicholas Bycroft pleaded guilty to an offence under Section 1 of the Hunting Act: he admitted illegally hunting a fox during a meet at Angmering Park, near Arundel, West Sussex, on 19 February 2013. He was given a 12-month conditional discharge, £150 costs and £15 [[victim surcharge]].

=== RSPCA vs Heythrop Hunt: 2012 ===
In December 2012 the [[RSPCA]] took out a private prosecution against Heythrop Hunt Limited. This was a landmark case, as it was the first time that an organized hunt was prosecuted as a corporate body. The Heythrop Hunt, its Huntsman, Julian Barnfield, and its Senior Master, Richard Sumner, all pleaded guilty to four charges of illegally hunting a fox at Oxford magistrates court in December 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2030971/Camerons-embarrassment-Chipping-Norton-Sets-favourite-huntsman-faces-court-illegal-hunting.html|title=Cameron's embarrassment as Chipping Norton Set's favourite huntsman faces court over illegal hunting | location=London | work=Daily Mail|first=Chris|last=Hastings|date=28 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barnfield, a former huntsman with the Heythrop and one of those convicted, said that the case had been politically motivated with its links with David Cameron's constituency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/dec/17/david-cameron-hunt-convicted-rspca|title=David Cameron's local hunt convicted after RSPCA prosecution | location=London | work=The Guardian|first=Caroline|last=Davies|date=17 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The presiding magistrate called the RSPCA's £327,000 costs "staggering";&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-oxfordshire-20758022|title=Heythrop Hunt members admit illegal fox hunting | work=BBC News | date=17 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, Gavin Grant, the chief executive of the RSPCA, said that the organisation would prevent cruelty to animals by all lawful means and had prosecuted 1,341 individuals and secured 3,114 convictions in the past year with a success rate of more than 98%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/dec/19/rspca-job-to-sue-heythrop-hunt|title=Why the RSPCA pursued a Heythrop Hunt prosecution | location=London | work=The Guardian|first=Gavin|last=Grant|date=19 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other cases===
Subsequently, three pending prosecutions against hunts, including one brought privately by the League Against Cruel Sports, were dropped&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.horseandhound.co.uk/news/392/280580.html |author=Butcher, A. |title=Case dropped against hunting men arrested in dawn raids in 2007 |publisher=Horse and Hound |date=14 April 2009 |accessdate=2 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090810074926/http://www.horseandhound.co.uk/news/392/280580.html |archivedate=10 August 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a further two cases which did reach court were thrown out at the conclusion of the prosecution cases when the District Judges ruled that there was no case to answer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cwherald.com/news/stories/cleared-huntsman-criticises-waste-of-money-20090921333539.htm |title=Cleared huntsman criticises waste of money |publisher=Cumberland and Westmoreland Herald |date=21 September 2009 |accessdate=2 October 2009 }}{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From March to November 2013, staff of six separate hunts were either acquitted of Hunting Act offences or had the prosecutions against them dropped, including three foxhound packs (The York &amp; Ainsty South, the Avon Vale and the Ledbury), a harrier pack (Weston &amp; Banwell Harriers), a staghound pack (The Quantock Staghounds) and a beagle pack (The [[Royal Agricultural College|RAC Beagles]]).

In September 2013 David Parker, the huntsman of the Seavington Hunt, was fined after he admitted illegally hunting a fox with dogs in Dorset. The prosecution was brought by the RSPCA with evidence from the International Fund for Animal Welfare (IFAW).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-24077013|title=Somerset man pleads guilty to hunting fox with dogs| location=London | work=BBC|date=13 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Perspectives==

===Public opinion===
Public opinion has tended to be in favour of the ban on fox hunting:
* A survey commissioned by ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' in 2002 indicated that a majority of people (57%) agreed with the statement that 'hunting with dogs is never acceptable'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yougov.com/yougov_website/asp_besPollArchives/pdf/TEL020101010.pdf|title=Poll|publisher=Yougov|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*A survey by MORI for [[BBC|the BBC]] carried out in February 2005 found that there was a plurality of support for the new legislation, but not an [[absolute majority]] (47% supporting, 26% opposed).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipsos-mori.com/polls/2005/bbc-countryfile.shtml |publisher=Ipsos Mori |date=16 February 2005 |accessdate=19 February 2008 |title=Attitudes to the Hunting Ban |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080131175028/http://www.ipsos-mori.com/polls/2005/bbc-countryfile.shtml |archivedate=31 January 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 2009, Ipsos MORI found that a total of 75% supported the ban on fox hunting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/2479/Public-Opinion-on-Hunting.aspx|title=Public Opinion on Hunting }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2010, the figure was almost identical, with 76% being opposed to repealing the Hunting Act, including with 71% of rural residents. There was 18% support for repeal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipsos-mori.com/researchpublications/researcharchive/2714/Public-Opinion-on-Hunting.aspx|publisher=Ipsos MORI|title=Public Opinion on Hunting |date=26 December 2010|accessdate=17 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*A poll by MORI in December 2012 showed no change on fox hunting, with 76% being opposed to moves to make it legal, rising to 81% in respect to deer hunting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/dec/25/britons-fox-hunting-ban-survey|title=Most Britons support fox hunting ban, survey finds|quote=Poll before Boxing Day meets shows 76% are against moves to make fox hunting legal, rising to 81% for deer hunting | location=London|work=The Guardian|first=Martin|last=Wainwright|date=25 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Ahead of Boxing Day 2016 a poll was released which indicated opposition to fox hunting had reached all-time highs, with 84% of voters, including 82% of those in rural areas, opposing fox hunting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/fox-hunting-boxing-day-poll-opposition-all-time-high-theresa-may-hunting-ban-act-vote-a7495336.html|title=Fox hunting opposition hits all-time high, latest poll finds|date=25 December 2016|publisher=|accessdate=22 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*An opinion poll in May 2017 revealed overwhelming public opposition to hunting with dogs, including the repeal of the Hunting Act 2004. 64% of voters disagreed with the statement that "the ban on fox hunting should be reversed", including 46% who "strongly disagreed". Just 11% supported the repeal of the ban. The poll was published in the aftermath of the release of the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] manifesto for the [[United Kingdom general election, 2017|2017 general election]], which promised a vote on the repeal of the Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/conservative-manifesto-bring-back-fox-hunting-only-one-in-10-voters-support-a7757891.html|title=9 out of 10 voters oppose Tory manisfesto pledge on fox hunting|date=26 May 2017|publisher=|accessdate=22 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only 16% of Conservative voters want the ban overturned, with 50% opposed.

== Proposed Coalition review ==
The [[Conservative – Liberal Democrat Coalition Agreement]], agreed by the new government following the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 general election]], aimed to give MPs a free vote "to express its view" on repealing the Hunting Act 2004&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/politics/8693832.stm |title=Policy-by-policy: The coalition government's plans  |date=21 May 2010 |newspaper=[[BBC News Online]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; when parliamentary time allowed, possibly in 'early 2012'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-11692203 |title=No plans for hunting ban vote before 2012, MPs say |first=Andres |last=Sinclair |date=4 November 2010 |newspaper=[[BBC News Online]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prime minister explained in January 2012 "I always thought the hunting ban was a pretty bizarre piece of legislation ... I think there should be a free vote in the House of Commons. I think the Commons should make its mind up about this. My problem has always been that it was just taking the criminal law into an area of activity where it didn’t really belong."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/295761/I-will-drop-bizarre-hunt-ban-vows-PM|title=I will drop 'bizarre' hunt ban, vows PM}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in December 2012 [[Owen Paterson]], the [[Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs|Environment Secretary]], said that there was no immediate likelihood of winning a Commons vote to make hunting legal again and that supporters of hunting would need to do "more work" to win over sceptical MPs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/countryside/9765858/Hunting-ban-will-not-be-repealed-Tories-admit.html|title=Hunting ban will not be repealed, Tories admit|work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London|first=James|last=Kirkup|date=26 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposed Conservative amendments==
The current Conservative Government have proposed "technical" amendments to the Act. These were officially postponed on the 14 July 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/amendments-to-hunting-act-proposed|title=Amendments to Hunting Act proposed|date=14 July 2015|publisher=www.gov.uk|accessdate=26 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applicability and exemptions==
The [[Countryside Alliance]] note that "The Act makes it an offence to hunt a mouse with a dog but not a rat, you can legally hunt a rabbit but not a hare. You can flush a fox to guns with two dogs legally but if you use three it's an offence. You can flush a fox to a [[bird of prey]] with as many dogs as you like."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/outdoors/8113716/The-rise-and-fall-of-Mr-Fox.html|publisher=The Telegraph|accessdate=16 January 2011|title=The Rise and Fall of Mr. Fox|location=London|first=Adam|last=Edwards|date=5 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hare coursing===
{{Main|Hare coursing}}
In a private prosecution under the Act brought by the [[International Fund for Animal Welfare]] (IFAW) who had observed two [[hare coursing]] events in villages near [[Malton, North Yorkshire]] in March 2007 organised by the Yorkshire Greyhound Field Trialling Club, the District Judge in [[Scarborough, North Yorkshire|Scarborough]] [[magistrate]]s court clarified that the club was mistaken in believing that because the dogs they had been using were [[Muzzle (device)|muzzled]], the practice was legal.&lt;ref name=BBC1Sep09&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/8231495.stm |title=TV chef admits hunting offences |date=1 September 2009 |accessdate=1 September 2009  | work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flushing wild mammals to guns===
Traditionally, in some upland areas, foxes were flushed by packs of dogs to be shot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defra.gov.uk/rural/hunting/inquiry/evidence/welshhounds.htm |archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20080730144206/http://www.defra.gov.uk/rural/hunting/inquiry/evidence/welshhounds.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=30 July 2008 |author=Jones, K. |year=2000 |title=Federation of Welsh Packs submission to Burns Inquiry |publisher=Defra |accessdate=19 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This activity is still permitted in Scotland under the Protection of Wild Mammals (Scotland) Act 2002.&lt;ref name="Scottish Act"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/legislation/scotland/acts2002/asp_20020006_en_1 |title=Protection of Wild Mammals (Scotland) Act |year=2002 |publisher=HMSO |accessdate=12 February 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080226111531/http://www.opsi.gov.uk/legislation/scotland/acts2002/asp_20020006_en_1 |archivedate=26 February 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However MPs, in making law for England and Wales, decided that this activity did result in unnecessary suffering, not least because it is more difficult to control a large number of hounds in dense woodland where this activity used to take place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/cgi-bin/newhtml_hl?DB=semukparl&amp;STEMMER=en&amp;WORDS=it%20is%20more%20than%20twice%20as%20difficult%20to%20keep%20two%20dogs%20under%20control%20one%20dog&amp;ALL=&amp;ANY=&amp;PHRASE=%22it%20is%20more%20than%20twice%20as%20difficult%20to%20keep%20two%20dogs%20under%20control%20than%20one%20dog%2e%20%22&amp;CATEGORIES=&amp;SIMPLE=&amp;SPEAKER=&amp;COLOUR=red&amp;STYLE=s&amp;ANCHOR=muscat_highlighter_first_match&amp;URL=/pa/cm200203/cmstand/f/st030204/pm/parti/30204s08.htm#muscat_highlighter_first_match|title=Official Report, Commons|date=4 February 2003|accessdate=25 February 2008|publisher=House of Commons}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Wednesday, 15 July 2015, the current Conservative Government are proposing Amendments to the Act, after realising they had only a slender chance of Repealing it. The amendments will be voted upon by a free vote, after just one hour's debate in the House of Commons. One of the key amendments is the flushing out of foxes, for them to be shot to death. Whilst this might sometimes prevent the foxes from being attacked by hounds, it is conceivable such attacks will happen, especially with dogs having previously been trained to do so.

This exemption was claimed by one [[deer hunting|stag hound]] packs in the [[Exmoor]] area. In an appeal judgment following the conviction of two [[stag hunt]] officials, the judge said that such hunting conducted primarily for recreation was illegal.&lt;ref name="QSH appeal"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.league.org.uk/uploads/documents/doc_480.pdf |title=League Against Cruel Sports vs. Down &amp; Pillivant |date=2 October 2007 |author=Williams, Judge W. |publisher=League Against Cruel Sports |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100602041058/http://www.league.org.uk/uploads/documents/doc_480.pdf |archivedate=2 June 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flushing a fox to a bird of prey===
Many traditional hunts have bought birds of prey and say that they are using hounds to flush foxes so that the bird of prey can hunt them. The Act requires that the intention must be "for the purpose of enabling a bird of prey to hunt the wild mammal."&lt;ref name="Hunting Act"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2004/ukpga_20040037_en_1.htm |title=Hunting Act 2004 |publisher=HMSO |accessdate=12 February 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090407004821/http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts2004/ukpga_20040037_en_1.htm |archivedate=7 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many experts, such as the Hawk Board, deny that any bird of prey can reasonably be used in the British countryside to kill a fox which has been flushed by (and is being chased by) a pack of hounds. If this view proves to be correct, then it is unlikely that such a use of dogs is lawful.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=McLeod, I.|year=2005|title=Birds of prey and the Hunting Act 2004|work=Justice of the Peace, 169|pages=774–775|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Expert opinion on the limitations of flushing foxes to birds of prey will be available to advise courts considering such cases, when they are litigated. For now, the question of what is lawful remains to be determined.

===Hunting below ground===
Hunting below ground takes place with [[Working terrier|terriers]]. The Act outlaws hunting with terriers (also known as terrier work) with a narrowly drawn exemption, described by the Minister, Alun Michael MP as existing "for [[gamekeeper]]s".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmhansrd/vo030630/debtext/30630-17.htm#30630-17_spnew10|title=Official Report, Commons|publisher=House of Commons|date=30 June 2003|accessdate=19 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Act requires that any hunting below ground must comply with a number of conditions:
*The activity must be carried out "for the purpose of preventing or reducing serious damage to [[gamebird]]s or wild birds which a person is keeping or preserving for the purpose of their being shot."
*The person using the dog must have with them written evidence that the land used belongs to them or that they have been given permission to use the land by the occupier. This permission must be shown immediately to a [[police officer]] on request.
*Only one [[working terrier|dog]] may be used underground at any one time.
*Reasonable steps must be taken to ensure that:
**the mammal is flushed as soon as found,
**the mammal is shot as soon as flushed,
**the manner in which the dog is used complies with a code of practice, and the dog must be under sufficient control so as not to prevent this, and
**the dog is not injured.&lt;ref name="Hunting Act"/&gt;

Despite this, many [[fox hunting|fox hunts]] continue to use terriers on a regular basis. Three people, not associated with hunts, have pleaded guilty to offences under the Hunting Act 2004 for hunting with terriers and a fourth was found guilty after a trial.&lt;ref name="League convictions list"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.league.org.uk/convictions |title=Hunting Act convictions |publisher=League Against Cruel Sports |date=January 2008 |accessdate=19 February 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722095717/http://www.league.org.uk/convictions |archivedate=22 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hunting mice, rats and rabbits===
The Hunting Act 2004 bans some hunting but permits some activities believed to be necessary for land managers. Parliament accepted the view that the hunting of pests such as rats and rabbits was legitimate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200203/cmhansrd/vo021216/debtext/21216-16.htm#21216-16_spnew15|title=Official Report, Commons|date=16 December 2002|accessdate=19 February 2008|publisher=House of Commons}}&lt;/ref&gt; MPs did not believe that there was any necessity to use dogs to hunt mice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200304/ldhansrd/vo041028/text/41028-10.htm#41028-10_spnew3|title=Official Report, Lords|date=28 October 2004|accessdate=27 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Tort law}}
{{Cleanup|date=May 2010}}
The '''last clear chance''' is a doctrine in the [[law]] of [[torts]] that is employed in [[contributory negligence]] jurisdictions. Under this doctrine, a negligent [[plaintiff]] can nonetheless recover if he is able to show that the [[defendant]] had the last opportunity to avoid the accident. Though the stated rationale has differed depending on the [[court]] adopting the doctrine, the underlying idea is to mitigate the harshness of the contributory negligence rule. The defendant can also use this doctrine as a defense.  If the plaintiff has the last clear chance to avoid the accident, the defendant will not be liable.

The [[Restatement (Second) of Torts]]&lt;ref&gt;Restatement (Second) of Torts § 766C (1979).&lt;/ref&gt; explains the doctrine in detail as follows:

{{quote|§ 479. LAST CLEAR CHANCE: HELPLESS PLAINTIFF

A plaintiff who has negligently subjected himself to a risk of harm from the defendant's subsequent negligence may recover for harm caused thereby if, immediately preceding the harm,

(a) the plaintiff is unable to avoid it by the exercise of reasonable vigilance and care, and

(b) the defendant is negligent in failing to utilize with reasonable care and competence his then existing opportunity to avoid the harm, when he

(i) knows of the plaintiff's situation and realizes or has reason to realize the peril involved in it or

(ii) would discover the situation and thus have reason to realize the peril, if he were to exercise the vigilance which it is then his duty to the plaintiff to exercise.

§ 480. LAST CLEAR CHANCE: INATTENTIVE PLAINTIFF

A plaintiff who, by the exercise of reasonable vigilance, could discover the danger created by the defendant's negligence in time to avoid the harm to him, can recover if, but only if, the defendant

(a) knows of the plaintiff's situation, and

(b) realizes or has reason to realize that the plaintiff is inattentive and therefore unlikely to discover his peril in time to avoid the harm, and

(c) thereafter is negligent in failing to utilize with reasonable care and competence his then existing opportunity to avoid the harm.

The introduction of the doctrine is widely attributed to the English case of ''[[Davies v. Mann]]'', 152 Eng. Rep. 588 (1842).}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4637">'''''Lewanika and Others vs. Chiluba''''', was a [[Supreme court|Supreme Court]] of [[Zambia]] case in which the Court dismissed the petition and held that the amendment limiting candidates to being at least third generation Zambians in dispute over the [[Zambian presidential election, 1996|1996 election]] did not disqualify [[Kenneth Kaunda]] from the [[President of Zambia|presidency]]. There were also other issues concerning electoral practices.

The constitutional provision was later evoked over the legality of [[Guy Scott]] running for president in the [[Zambian presidential election, 2015|2015 election]]&lt;ref name="bbc"/&gt; or even his legitimacy as acting president.&lt;ref name="em"/&gt;

==Case==

===Background===
Section 38 of the 1996 [[constitution of Zambia]] states:&lt;blockquote&gt;
If the office of the President becomes vacant by reason of his death or resignation or by reason of his ceasing to hold office by virtue of Article 36, 37 or 88, an election to the office of the President shall be held in accordance with Article 34 within ninety days from the date of the office becoming vacant. Whenever the office of the President becomes vacant, the Vice-President or, in the absence of the Vice-President or if the Vice-President is unable, by reason of physical or mental infirmity, to discharge the functions of his office, a member of the Cabinet elected by the Cabinet shall perform the functions of the office of the President until a person elected as President in accordance with Article 34 assumes office.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/monkey-cage/wp/2014/10/29/another-zambian-president-dies-in-office-what-happens-now/|title=Another Zambian president dies in office. What happens now? - The Washington Post|publisher=washingtonpost.com|accessdate=2014-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Section 34 of the constitution as amended in 1996 states:
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;A person shall be qualified to be a candidate for election as President if
(a) he is a Zambian citizen;
(b) both his parents are Zambians by birth or descent;
(c) he has attained the age of thirty-five years;
(d) he is a member of, or is sponsored by, a political party;
(e) he is qualified to be elected as a member of the National Assembly; and
(f) has been domiciled in Zambia for a period of at least twenty years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parliament.gov.zm/downloads/VOLUME%201.pdf|title=Constitution of Zambia|accessdate=5 December 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130626134456/http://www.parliament.gov.zm/downloads/VOLUME%201.pdf|archivedate=26 June 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Court ruling===
The court ruled that the Constitution should be construed as referring to "those who became Zambian citizens at independence or would, but for their prior deaths, have then become Zambian citizens". That is, Zambian citizenship was only created on [[Zambia Independence Act 1964|24 October, 1964]] and so it was unnecessary to determine the birthplace of Chiluba or his father as they would have become citizens on that date.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Lewanika and Others v Frederick Jacob Titus Chiluba |vol=11|reporter=ZMSC |opinion=S.C.Z.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4659">'''Marketing orders and agreements''' in [[Agricultural policy of the United States|United States agricultural policy]] allow producers to promote [[orderly marketing]] through collectively influencing the supply, demand, or price of a particular commodity. Research and promotion can be financed with pooled funds. 

''Marketing orders'' are binding on all handlers of the commodity within the geographic area of regulation once it is approved by a required number of producers (usually two-thirds).&lt;ref name=kalebjian&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kalebjian|first=Bradley|title=The Effect of Terminated Federal Marketing Orders on Small Farms, and a Reflection on the Jeffersonian Spirit|url=http://www.sjcl.edu/images/stories/sjalr/volumes/V22N1C4.pdf|journal=[[San Joaquin Agricultural Law Review]]|volume=22|issue=1|pages=115-140|accessdate=3 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; An order may limit the quantity of goods marketed, or establish the grade, size, maturity, quality, or prices of the goods. The [[Agricultural Marketing Service]] of the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) uses marketing orders to regulate the sale of dairy products&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ams.usda.gov/dairy/orders.htm AMS at USDA - Dairy Programs- Federal Milk Marketing Orders&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and fruits and vegetables.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ams.usda.gov/fv/moab.html AMS at USDA, Fruit and Vegetable Marketing Orders&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; An order can be terminated when a majority of all producers favor its termination or when the USDA determines that the order no longer serves its intended purpose. ''Marketing agreements'' may contain more diversified provisions, but are enforceable only against those handlers who enter into the agreement.

They are authorized by the [[Agricultural Marketing Agreement Act of 1937]] (AMAA), as amended.&lt;ref name=kalebjian /&gt; The AMAA was a piece of [[New Deal]] era legislation implemented for price stability and essential marketing functions in response to economic pressure faced by small farmers in the 1920s.&lt;ref name=kalebjian /&gt;
Except for DFA they aren't bound by federal orders and can pay producers whatever they want.

==Milk==
Federal milk marketing orders regulate handlers that sell milk or milk products within an order region by requiring them to pay not less than an established minimum price for the [[Grade A milk]] they purchase from dairy producers, depending on how the milk is used. This classified pricing system requires handlers to pay a higher price for milk used for fluid consumption (Class I) than for milk used in manufactured dairy products such as yogurt, ice cream, cheese, butter and nonfat dry milk (Class II, Class III and Class IV products). The Federal Milk Marketing Order (FMMO) does not include certain states, such as [[California]].

Federal milk marketing orders were first instituted in the 1930s to promote orderly marketing conditions by, among other things, applying a uniform system of classified pricing throughout the farm milk market. The [[Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996|1996 Farm Bill]] required the USDA to consolidate the number of federal milk marketing orders and to revise the method by which minimum class prices are determined. The USDA implemented these changes in 2000. There are now 10 milk marketing orders, down from 31 when the law was enacted.

==Raisins==
The [[National Raisin Reserve]] is a [[raisin]] reserve of the United States. It was created after [[World War II]] by the government in order to control raisin prices. The reserve is run by the [[Raisin Administrative Committee]],&lt;ref name=Fahrenthold1&gt;{{cite news|last=Fahrenthold|first=David|title=One grower’s grapes of wrath|url=https://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-07-07/lifestyle/40427624_1_raisins-grapes-dried-fruit|accessdate=14 August 2013|newspaper=[[Washington Post]]|date=7 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was the subject of the 2013 and 2015 Supreme Court case ''[[Horne v.

[[Image:2ndEarlOfCastlehaven.jpg|right|thumb|The 2nd Earl of Castlehaven, from a contemporary print published in the wake of his notorious trial.]]
'''Mervyn Tuchet''' (sometimes '''Mervin Touchet'''), '''2nd Earl of Castlehaven''' (1593 – 14 May 1631), was an English nobleman who was [[Laws regarding rape|convicted of rape]] and [[Sodomy law|sodomy]] and subsequently [[Capital punishment|executed]].

A son of [[George Tuchet, 1st Earl of Castlehaven|George Tuchet]], 1st [[Earl of Castlehaven]] and 11th [[Baron Audley]], by his wife, Lucy Mervyn, he was known by the [[courtesy title]] of Lord Audley during his father's lifetime, so is sometimes referred to as '''Mervyn Audley'''.&lt;ref name=hop&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1604-1629/member/audley-sir-mervyn-1588-1631 |title=Audley, alias Tuchet, Sir Mervyn (c.1588-1631), of Stalbridge, Dorset; later of Fonthill Gifford, Wilts |first1=John P. |last1=Ferris |first2=Paul |last2=Hunneyball |website=[[The History of Parliament]] |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was knighted by [[James I of England|James I]] in 1608, before he studied law at the [[Middle Temple]].  He served as Member of the [[Parliament of England]] for [[Dorset (UK Parliament constituency)|Dorset]] in the [[Addled Parliament]] of 1614 and was a [[justice of the peace|Justice of the Peace]] for the counties of [[Dorset]], [[Somerset]], and [[Wiltshire]].&lt;ref name=hop /&gt;  He succeeded his father on 20 February 1616/7 as Earl of Castlehaven and Baron Audley. He left seven children upon his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Herrup|1999|p=ix}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometime before 1612 (records of the marriage are lacking), Lord Audley married Elizabeth Barnham, a sister-in-law of the philosopher and scientist [[Francis Bacon]], and with her he had six children. By all accounts the marriage was a loving and successful one, ending with her death in 1622.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Herrup|1999|p=12}}.&lt;/ref&gt; His second marriage, on 22 July 1624, at [[Harefield]], [[Middlesex]], was to the former [[Anne Stanley, Countess of Castlehaven|Lady Anne Stanley]] (1580–1647), elder daughter and co-heiress of [[Ferdinando Stanley, 5th Earl of Derby]] (by his wife, [[Alice Spencer]]), and widow of [[Grey Brydges, 5th Baron Chandos]]. They had a daughter, Anne Touchet, who died young.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wargs.com/essays/succession/castlehaven.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Lady Anne was significantly older than Castlehaven,&lt;ref name=merv&gt;{{Cite ODNB |first=Cynthia B. |last=Herrup |title=Touchet, Mervin, second earl of Castlehaven (1593–1631) |id=66794 |origyear=2004 |date=January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the marriage was not a success, but in 1628 [[James Tuchet, 3rd Earl of Castlehaven|Lord Castlehaven's son]] was married to her thirteen-year-old daughter, Elizabeth;&lt;ref name=merv/&gt; a marriage of step-children.

==Trial on charges of rape and sodomy==
In 1630, Castlehaven was publicly accused of raping his wife and committing sodomy with two of his servants.&lt;ref name=Massarella&gt;{{cite journal | last =Massarella | first =Derek | title ="&amp; thus ended the buisinisse": A Buggery Trial on the East India Company Ship Mary in 1636 | journal =The Mariner's Mirror | volume =103 | issue =4 | page = 423| publisher =Society for Nautical Research | location =Portsmouth, United Kingdom | date =November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Castlehaven's son, James, claimed that it was the extent of Castlehaven's "uxoriousness" toward his male [[favourite]]s which led to his initial lodging of a complaint.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Herrup|1999|p=19}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

At a [[List of trials of peers in the House of Lords|trial by his peers]], it was stated that one such favourite, Henry Skipwith, had arrived at [[Fonthill Gifford]] in 1621 and that within a few years he was so close to Castlehaven that he sat at the family's table and was to be addressed as "Mister Skipwith" by the servants. Several years later, Giles Broadway arrived at the house and received similar treatment. It was not long before Castlehaven was providing Skipwith with an annual pension, and he was accused of attempting to have Skipwith inseminate his daughter-in-law, to produce an heir from Skipwith instead of his son. In fact, the countess and Skipwith had an adulterous relationship.

Charges were brought against Castlehaven on the complaint of his eldest son and heir, who feared disinheritance, and were heard by the [[Privy Council of England|Privy Council]] under the direction of [[Thomas Coventry, 1st Baron Coventry|Thomas Coventry]], [[Lord High Steward]]. Lady Castlehaven gave evidence of a household which she said was infested with debauchery, and the Attorney-General acting for the prosecution explained to the court that Castlehaven had become ill because "he [[Atheism|believed not God]]", an impiety which made Castlehaven unsafe. However, he insisted he was not guilty and that his wife and son had conspired together in an attempt to commit [[judicial murder]]. All witnesses against Castlehaven would gain materially by his death (as the defendant put it: "It is my estate, my Lords, that does accuse me this day, and nothing else")&lt;ref name=merv/&gt; and "News writers throughout England and as far away as Massachusetts Bay speculated about the outcome."&lt;ref name=merv/&gt;

Castlehaven maintained his innocence, and the trial aroused considerable public debate, After some deliberation the Privy Council returned a unanimous verdict of guilty on the charge of rape. The sodomy charge was also upheld, but by a slim margin as not all jurors agreed that actual penetration had taken place.&lt;ref name=Massarella/&gt; The case remains of interest to some as an early trial concerning male homosexuality, but ultimately its greatest influence proved to be as a precedent in spousal rights, as it became the leading case establishing an injured wife's right to testify against her husband.&lt;ref name=merv/&gt;

Castlehaven was convicted, [[Attainder|attainted]], and three weeks later [[Beheading|beheaded]] on [[Tower Hill, London|Tower Hill]] for his [[sexual crime]]s: namely the "unnatural crime" of [[sodomy]], committed with his [[page (servant)|page]] Laurence (or Florence) FitzPatrick, who confessed to the crime and was executed; and assisting Giles Browning (alias Broadway), who was also executed, in the rape of his wife Anne, Countess of Castlehaven, in which Lord Castlehaven was found to have participated by restraining her.

The page who was executed, Laurence FitzPatrick, testified that Lady Castlehaven "was the wickedest woman in the world, and had more to answer for than any woman that lived". In ''[[The Complete Peerage]]'', Cokayne adds that the death of Castlehaven was certainly brought about by his wife's manipulations and that her undoubted adultery with one Ampthill and with Henry Skipwith renders her motives suspicious. According to the historian [[Cynthia Herrup|Cynthia B. Herrup]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Cynthia B. |last=Herrup |title=A House in Gross Disorder: sex, law, and the 2nd Earl of Castlehaven |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anne was the equal of Lord Castlehaven in immorality.

Under the terms of the attainder, Castlehaven forfeited his English barony of Audley, created for ''heirs general'', but retained his Irish earldom and barony since it was an entailed honour protected by the statute ''[[De donis conditionalibus|De Donis]]''. When he was beheaded on Tower Hill on 14 May 1631, those Irish titles passed to his son [[James Tuchet, 3rd Earl of Castlehaven|James]].

==Children==
Mervyn Touchet's first marriage (c.1611) was with Elizabeth Barnham (1592–c.1622/4), daughter of London alderman [[Benedict Barnham]] and his wife, Dorothea Smith, and they had six surviving children:
*[[James Tuchet, 3rd Earl of Castlehaven]] (1612–1684), who married Elizabeth Brydges (1614/5–1679), daughter of [[Anne Stanley, Countess of Castlehaven|his stepmother]], but left no surviving children
*Lady Frances Touchet (born 1617)
*[[George Anselm Touchet|Hon. George Touchet]] (died {{circa|1689}}), who became a Benedictine monk
*[[Mervyn Tuchet, 4th Earl of Castlehaven]] (died 1686)
*Lady Lucy Touchet (died 1662)
*Lady Dorothy Touchet (died 1635)

'''Montenegrin nationality law''' is the [[nationality law]] of [[Montenegro]]. It was ratified by Parliament in 2008 and published by the [[Official Journal of Montenegro]]. It is mainly based on ''[[jus sanguinis]]'', and in general does not permit [[multiple citizenship]], though there are exceptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|UNHCR|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also provisions for [[citizenship-by-investment]], though the government has suspended the relevant guidelines in the face of [[European Union]] concern.

==History==
===Origin===
The concept of citizenship in Montenegrin law can be traced back to the laws promulgated in 1803 by [[Petar I Petrović-Njegoš]], which articulated the principle of ''jus sanguinis'' in reference to ''Crnogorac'' (Montenegrins) and ''Brdjanin'' (Highlanders), and then to the legal code of 1855, which reiterated the earlier principles and also granted foreigners the right to reside in Montenegro.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Džankić|2010|pp=3–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1905, [[Nicholas I of Montenegro]]'s "Statute of Montenegro" promulgated further guidelines, for the first time using the term "Montenegrin citizens" instead of "Montenegrins" and "Highlanders", and also establishing the right of [[renunciation of citizenship]] after completion of [[military service]]. However the law did not spell out the guidelines for acquisition of citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Džankić|2010|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kingdom of Yugoslavia and Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia===
When Montenegro was a part of [[Yugoslavia]], it had citizenship policies in common with the rest of the country. The [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]] passed a formal citizenship act in 1928, establishing that citizenship would be acquired by patrilineal descent. The [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] (SFRY) for its part passed a citizenship act in 1945, which stated that Yugoslav citizenship was held by people who were citizens under the 1928 act and people who had the ethnicity of one of the Yugoslav republics; it also deprived emigrants of their citizenship, and prohibited [[multiple citizenship]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Džankić|2010|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The constituent republics, including the [[Socialist Republic of Montenegro]], passed their own citizenship acts, which mirrored the federal acts and provided for acquisition of citizenship of the constituent republic along with federal citizenship. Citizenship of a constituent republic came from descent rather than [[jus soli|place of birth]]; in the case of two parents with citizenship of different republics, the citizenship of the child depended on agreement by the parents, or lacking such agreement, a legal determination based on the child's [[habitual residence|place of residence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Džankić|2010|pp=5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the [[breakup of Yugoslavia]] there were two further changes to nationality laws, each being passed soon after the adoption of a new [[Constitution of Yugoslavia]]. The Citizenship Act of 1964 removed the provisions for depriving emigrants of citizenship, as well as establishing procedures for naturalisation. It also clarified the relationship that if one lost federal citizenship, then republic citizenship would be lost as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Džankić|2010|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1976 Citizenship Act clarified the mechanism for acquisition of citizenship of a republic by citizens of other republics. By the time the federal legislation was passed, the constituent republics had already adopted new citizenship legislation in line with the new constitution. Montenegro was the first to pass such legislation, in May 1975; it would remain in force until 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Džankić|2010|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Federal Republic of Yugoslavia and State Union of Serbia and Montenegro===
The constitution of the [[Serbia and Montenegro|Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] (FRY, comprising Serbia and Montenegro) passed in 1992 continued the two-tier structure of federal citizenship and republic citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Džankić|2010|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;   However, the actual citizenship act governing the details of acquisition of citizenship in the FRY was not passed until 1996. &lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Džankić|2010|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; It automatically gave citizenship in the FRY to everyone who had republic citizenship of Serbia or of Montenegro under the SFRY. It also provided that people who held SFRY citizenship, were permanently resident on the territory of the FRY at the time of the promulgation of the constitution, and had no other citizenships could apply for FRY citizenship. However it required that they [[renunciation of citizenship|renounce their former citizenship]] in the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lilić|Janjic|Kovačević-Vučo|2001|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also stated that a person acquiring FRY citizenship by naturalisation would also acquire the citizenship of the republic on whose territory the event of naturalisation occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lilić|Janjic|Kovačević-Vučo|2001|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
In 1999, as the [[1999 NATO bombing of Yugoslavia|NATO bombing]] intensified, Montenegro passed its own nationality law which changed the relationship between federal and republic citizenship, seen as a move to establish greater independence from the federal government. The law provided mechanisms for obtaining Montenegrin citizenship even in the absence of FRY citizenship; it also stated in Article 16 that a Montenegrin citizen who acquired citizenship of another republic or a foreign country would lose his citizenship. &lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lilić|Janjic|Kovačević-Vučo|2001|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also established particularly stringent criteria for naturalisation, in an effort to prevent refugees from [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and from [[Croatia]] from gaining voting rights in Montenegro.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Džankić|2010|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there were significant changes to the federal citizenship laws in the aftermath of the [[overthrow of Slobodan Milošević]]; specifically, Articles 47 and 48 were modified to permit people who held SFRY citizenship to obtain FRY citizenship without giving up any other citizenship they held, thus effectively permitting multiple citizenship for the first time in the history of the nationality law.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lilić|Janjic|Kovačević-Vučo|2001|pp=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under reformulation of the FRY as the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro in 2003, the [[Constitutional Charter of Serbia and Montenegro]] further clarified the relationship between citizenship and voting rights: it stated in Article 7 that citizens of Serbia and of Montenegro residing in the other would each have full rights, but with the specific exception of voting rights. Furthermore, under republic-level law, Montenegrins living in Serbia had no voting rights in Montenegro either. This distribution of voting rights effectively laid the ground for the passage of the [[Montenegrin independence referendum, 2006]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Džankić|2010|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.mfa.gov.rs/Facts/const_scg.pdf|title=Constitutional Charter of the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro|publisher=Ministry of Foreign Affairs|publication-place=Republic of Serbia|year=2003|accessdate=2012-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-independence===
After Montenegro became an independent country in 2006, article 12 of the new [[Constitution of Montenegro]] passed in 2007 established Montenegrin citizenship. The Law on Implementation allowed people who had dual citizenship before independence to retain that dual citizenship. However, it did not permit people who obtained another citizenship afterwards to retain dual citizenship, instead requiring to give up one or the other citizenship within a year. However this clause was the subject of political tensions, and led to delays in the passage of a formal citizenship act.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Džankić|2010|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Citizenship Act of 2008 clarified the exact mechanisms for gain and loss of citizenship. It also defined the character of citizenship in Montenegro as "civic" rather than "ethnic".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Džankić|2010|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; It continued to impose strict requirements for naturalisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Džankić|2010|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the new nationality law, Articles 8 and 9 provide that persons applying for naturalisation in Montenegro must provide proof of having given up their previous citizenship, while Article 24 provides that Montenegrins acquiring citizenship of another country lose their Montenegrin citizenship. However, Article 18 provides exceptions from this general prohibition against multiple nationality in the case of a bilateral treaty between Montenegro and the other country of citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|UNHCR|2008|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 it was reported that Montenegro and Serbia were negotiating such a treaty.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.dailynewsmontenegro.com/zoran-lutovac-dual-citizenship-agreement-will-bring-benefits.html|title=Zoran Lutovac: Dual Citizenship Agreement Will Bring Benefits|periodical=Daily News Montenegro|date=2012-02-25|accessdate=2012-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dual citizenship==
Montenegro allows its citizens to hold foreign citizenship in addition to their Montenegrin citizenship. Some countries, however, do not permit multiple citizenship e.g. adults who acquired Montenegrin and [[Japanese citizenship]] by birth must declare, to the latter's [[Ministry of Justice (Japan)|Ministry of Justice]], before turning 22, which citizenship they want to keep.

==Economic citizenship==
In addition to the rather strict mechanisms for [[naturalisation]], Montenegro has a programme of [[citizenship-by-investment]] or economic citizenship (''ekonomsko državljanstvo''), allowing foreigners to be granted the citizenship of Montenegro at the discretion of the [[Ministry of Interior Affairs and Public Administration (Montenegro)|Ministry of Interior Affairs and Public Administration]].&lt;ref name="Gov.me20100810"&gt;{{citation|title=Izjava šefa Biroa za odnose s javnošću Vlade Crne Gore Olivere Đukanović povodom Odluke Vlade o otvaranju programa "ekonomsko državljanstvo"|publisher=Government of Montenegro|date=2010-08-10|accessdate=2011-05-12|url=http://www.gov.me/vijesti/98702/Izjava-sefa-Biroa-za-odnose-s-javnoscu-Vlade-Crne-Gore-Olivere-dukanovic-povodom-Odluke-Vlade-o-otvaranju-programa-ekonomsko-drz.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the enabling legislation remains in place, the programme was suspended in November 2010.&lt;ref name="Blic"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.blic.rs/Vesti/Drustvo/216038/Crna-Gora-ukinula-ekonomsko-drzavljanstvo|title=Crna Gora ukinula ekonomsko državljanstvo|periodical=Blic Online|date=2010-11-07|accessdate=2011-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Article 12 of the Citizenship Act of 2008 states that "An adult person may be granted Montenegrin citizenship if he or she does not fulfil the requirements referred to in Article 8 of this Law if it would be in the scientific, economic, cultural, sport, national, or other interest of Montenegro".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|UNHCR|2008|p=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2010, former [[Prime Minister of Thailand]] [[Thaksin Shinawatra]] received citizenship under this article due to his investments in [[tourism in Montenegro]] which were reported to be in the range of millions of Euros, despite pending charges of corruption that had been laid against him in his home country.&lt;ref name="Dan"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.dan.co.me/?nivo=3&amp;rubrika=Politika&amp;clanak=242717&amp;datum=2010-08-14|periodical=Dnevni Novine|date=2010-08-14|accessdate=2011-05-12|title=Njemačka agencija DPA objavila da je vlada ekonomsko državljanstvo pripremila za ruske oligarhe}}&lt;/ref&gt; The move sparked public criticism, but government spokeswoman Olivera Đukanović dismissed the concerns by claiming that other countries had similar programs.&lt;ref name="Dzankic2010"&gt;{{harvnb|Džankić|2010|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Formal guidelines for the programme were announced in mid-2010; they stated that candidates would require €500,000, of which one portion would be invested inside the country and the rest would have to be contributed to the state budget.&lt;ref name="Gov.me20100810"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dzankic2010"/&gt; In the light of German reports in August that [[Oleg Deripaska]] would be granted citizenship under the programme, more criticism emerged. [[Movement for Changes]] leader [[Nebojša Medojević]] as well as Vanja Ćalović of NGO MANS were quoted as warning that the programme would attract gangsters and increase corruption. [[Budimir Aleksić]] of the [[Poslanik Nove]] for his part complained that the government would "sell citizenship" while leaving 60,000 residents of Montenegro stateless.&lt;ref name="Dan"/&gt; [[Stephan Meyer (politician)|Stephan Meyer]] of Germany's [[Christian Social Union of Bavaria|Christian Social Union]] also spoke out against it, and said it might threaten the recent moves to grant [[Montenegrin passport]]-holders visa-free travel within the [[Schengen Area]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2010/08/10/us-montenegro-citizenship-idUKTRE67935O20100810|title=Buy your way into Montenegro for half a million euros|periodical=Reuters|date=2010-08-10|accessdate=2011-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dzankic2010"/&gt; However others offered public praise to the programme, including Canadian ambassador to Serbia, Montenegro, and Macedonia John Morrison, who compared it to [[Visa policy of Canada|Canada's own visa policy]], which has provisions for granting visas to investors.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Džankić|2010|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in August, when rumours surfaced that Serbian businessman [[Miroslav Mišković]] was in the process of applying for citizenship under the program, then [[Prime Minister of Montenegro|Prime Minister]] [[Milo Đukanović]] denied the reports, and further stated that the process of receiving applications for economic citizenship under the new guidelines had not yet begun.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.vesti-online.com/Vesti/Ex-YU/76790/Crna-Gora-Nismo-dali-ekonomsko-drzavljanstvo-Miskovicu|periodical=Vesti|date=2010-08-24|accessdate=2011-05-12|title=Crna Gora: Nismo dali 'ekonomsko državljanstvo' Miškoviću}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then in November 2010, the Montenegrin [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Montenegro)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]] formally announced the suspension of the previous guidelines about economic citizenship. Media reports attributed this action to pressure from the European Union, though MFA spokesman Zeljko Stamatović denied it.&lt;ref name="Blic"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.cafemontenegro.com/index.php?group=25&amp;news=143104|periodical=Cafe del Montenegro|title=Do usaglašavanja sa EU ukinuto ekonomsko državljanstvo|date=2010-11-08|accessdate=2011-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of June 2011, the programme remained suspended.&lt;ref name="DNM20110619"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.dailynewsmontenegro.com/montenegro-economic-citizenship-still-on-hold.html|title=Montenegro economic citizenship still on hold|periodical=Daily News Montenegro|date=2011-06-19|accessdate=2012-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a ''Dnevne Novine'' report; concerns remained that the citizenship-by-investment programme would not attract genuine investors but only people engaged in [[money laundering]] and those who sought to hide from crimes committed abroad (as Montenegro does not [[extradition|extradite]] its citizens).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.dan.co.me/?nivo=3&amp;datum=2011-01-16&amp;rubrika=Politika&amp;najdatum=2011-01-15&amp;clanak=263685|title=Šest mjeseci od promocije vladinog programa ekonomskog državljanstva još nema najava da će početi primjena|periodical=Dnevne Novine|date=2011-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, others argue that the programme could help in attracting foreign investment capital to Montenegro, especially from [[American diaspora|Americans living abroad]] who remain fully subject to U.S. taxation unless they switch citizenships.&lt;ref name="DNM20110619"/&gt;

On 26 July 2018, the Montenegrin authorities announced the launch of a citizenship by [[investment]] programme. To obtain a Montenegrin [[passport]], investors have to buy local property and put €100,000 into a special fund for national development. In the lagging regions of the north, the minimum property value is €250,000, and in the advanced regions of the south, it is €450,000. The programme will be launched in October 2018. The number of participants is limited to only 2,000 applicants, who will be able to become Montenegrin citizens in just three years.

{{Neo-fascism}}
{{Fascism sidebar}}

'''Neo-fascism''' is a post–[[World War II]] ideology that includes significant elements of [[fascism]]. Neo-fascism usually includes [[ultranationalism]], [[populism]], [[authoritarianism]], [[nativism (politics)|nativism]] and [[opposition to immigration]], as well as  opposition to [[liberal democracy]], [[parliamentarianism]], [[Marxism]], [[Communism]] and [[socialism]]. Allegations that a group is neo-fascist may be hotly contested, especially if the term is used as a [[Fascist (insult)|political epithet]]. Some [[post–World War II]] regimes have been described as neo-fascist due to their [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] nature, and sometimes due to their fascination with and sympathy towards fascist [[ideology]] and [[ritual]]s.

'''Post-fascism''' is a label that has been applied to several European political parties that espouse a modified form of fascism and which partake in constitutional politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/post-fascist|title=Post-fascist - definition of post-fascist by The Free Dictionary|work=TheFreeDictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Griffin, R. (2007) ''The 'post‐Fascism' of the Alleanza Nazionale: A case study in ideological morphology'', Journal of Political Ideologies, 1/2: 123-145&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bolivia==
{{unreferenced section|date=October 2014}}
The [[Bolivian Socialist Falange]] party founded in 1937 played a crucial role in mid-century Bolivian politics. [[Luis García Meza Tejada]]'s regime took power during the 1980 ''[[1980 Bolivian coup d'état|Cocaine Coup]]'' in [[Bolivia]] with the help of Italian neo-fascist [[Stefano Delle Chiaie]], [[Nazi]] [[War crime|war criminal]] [[Klaus Barbie]] and the [[Buenos Aires]] [[military junta|junta]]. That regime has been accused of neo-fascist tendencies and of admiration for Nazi paraphernalia and rituals. [[Hugo Banzer Suárez]], who preceded Tejada, also displayed admiration for [[Nazism]] and fascism.

==Indonesia==
{{expand section|date=March 2014}}
[[Adolf Hitler]]'s propaganda which advocated the hegemony of "Greater Germany" inspired similar ideas of "Indonesia Mulia" (esteemed [[Indonesia]]) and "Indonesia Raya" (great Indonesia) in the former [[Dutch colony]]. The first fascist party was the [[Partai Fasis Indonesia]] (PFI). [[Sukarno]] admired Hitler's [[Nazi Germany|Third Reich]] and its vision of happiness for all: "It's in the Third Reich that the Germans will see Germany at the apex above other nations in this world," he said in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2008/07/20/fascism-indonesia-no-big-deal.html|title=Fascism in Indonesia, no big deal?|publisher=The Jakarta Post|author=Aboeprijadi Santoso|date=July 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He stated that Hitler was 'extraordinarily clever' in 'depicting his ideals': he spoke about Hitler's rhetorical skills, but denied any association with [[Nazism]] as an ideology, saying that Indonesian nationalism was not as narrow as Nazi nationalism.&lt;ref&gt;[https://sydney.edu.au/arts/indonesian/docs/Hons_Thesis_Mirela_Suciu_2008.pdf Signs of Anti-Semitism in Indonesia], Eva Mirela Suciu, Department of Asian Studies, The University of Sydney, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Italy==
{{Main|History of the Italian Republic}}
[[File:Giorgio Almirante crop.jpg|thumb|[[Giorgio Almirante]] leader of the [[Italian Social Movement]].]]

[[History of Italy as a Republic|Italy]] was broadly divided into two political blocs following World War II, the [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democrats]], who remained in power until the 1980s, and the [[Italian Communist Party]] (PCI), which was very strong immediately after the war.

With the beginning of the [[Cold War]], the British government feared that the requested extradition of [[Italian war criminals]] to [[Yugoslavia]] would benefit the PCI. Preventing anything like the [[Nuremberg trials]] for [[Italian war crimes]], the collective memory of the crimes committed by Italians was excluded from public media, from textbooks in Italian schools, and even from the academic discourse on the Western side of the [[Iron curtain]] throughout the Cold War.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alessandra Kersevan]]2008: (Editor) Foibe - Revisionismo di stato e amnesie della repubblica.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The PCI was expelled from power in May 1947, a month before the Paris Conference on the [[Marshall Plan]], along with the [[French Communist Party]] (PCF).

In 1946 a group of Fascist soldiers founded the [[Italian Social Movement]] to continue advocating the ideas of [[Benito Mussolini]]. The leader of the MSI was [[Giorgio Almirante]], who remained at the head of the party until his death in 1988.

Despite attempts in the 1970s towards a "[[historic compromise]]" between the PCI and the DC, the PCI did not have a role in executive power until the 1980s. In December 1970, [[Junio Valerio Borghese]] attempted, along with Stefano Delle Chiaie, the ''[[Borghese Coup]]'' which was supposed to install a neo-fascist regime. Neo-fascist groups took part in various [[false flag]] terrorist attacks, starting with the December 1969 [[Piazza Fontana massacre]], for which [[Vincenzo Vinciguerra]] was convicted, and they are usually considered to have stopped with the 1980 [[Bologna railway bombing]]. A 2000 parliamentary report from the center-left [[The Olive Tree (political coalition)|Olive Tree]] coalition concluded that "the [[strategy of tension]] had been supported by the [[United States]] in order to impede the PCI, and, in a lesser measure, the [[Italian Socialist Party|PSI]] from reaching executive power"{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}.

Since the 1990s, the [[National Alliance (Italy)|National Alliance]], led by [[Gianfranco Fini]], a former member of the [[Italian Social Movement]], has distanced itself from Mussolini and fascism and it has also made efforts to improve its relations with Jewish groups, with most die-hards leaving it; it now seeks to present itself as a respectable right-wing party. Fini joined [[Silvio Berlusconi]]'s government. Neo-fascist parties in Italy include the [[Tricolour Flame]] ("Fiamma Tricolore"), the [[New Force (Italy)|New Force]] ("Forza Nuova"), the [[National Social Front]] ("Fronte Sociale Nazionale"), [[Brothers of Italy]] ("Fratelli d'Italia") and [[CasaPound]].

==Lebanon==
[[Lebanon]] (1982–1988) – The far-right wing Christian [[Kataeb Party|Phalangist Party]] "Kataeb," which had its own private army and was backed by Lebanese Forces, was inspired by the Spanish [[Falangists]].  As it evolved it gained nominal power in the country during the 1980s but it had limited authority over the highly factionalised state, two-thirds of which was controlled by [[Israel]]i and [[Syria]]n troops.

Its core political beliefs are not neo-fascist{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} and include:

* The primacy of preserving the Lebanese nation, but with a "[[Phoenicia]]n" identity, distinct from its [[Arabs|Arab]] and [[Muslim]] neighbors. Party policies have been uniformly anticommunist and anti-Palestinian and they have also allowed no place for [[Pan-Arabism|Pan-Arab]] ideals.
* A nationalistic ideology that considers the [[Lebanese people]], particularly the [[Maronites]], to be a unique nation that is independent from the Arab nation. Sometimes, It considers the Lebanese to be a [[Phoenicianism|Phoenician]] people and at other times, it considers them to be a [[Aramaeanism|Syriac]] people.
* An independent, sovereign and pluralistic Lebanon that safeguards the basic [[human rights]] and fundamental freedoms of all its constituents.
* Lebanon is a liberal outlet where [[Eastern Christianity]] can socially, politically and economically flourish in peace with its surrounding.

It is only on this list because of its early symbolism.  The military activity was common and broadly used across all pre-colonial and post-colonial states, until today.  All political parties in present-day Lebanon have private armies, from [[Hezbollah]] to the Christian militias.

==Mongolia==
With [[Mongolia]] located between the larger nations [[Russia]] and [[China]], ethnic insecurities have driven many Mongolians to neo-fascism,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1910893,00.html|title=Postcard: Ulan Bator - TIME|date=27 July 2009|work=TIME.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; expressing nationalism centered around [[Genghis Khan]] and [[Adolf Hitler]]. Groups advocating these ideologies include Blue Mongolia, Dayar Mongol, and Mongolian National Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ubpost.mongolnews.mn/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=2446&amp;Itemid=42|title=Mongolia's leading English language news|publisher=The UB Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Portugal==

After the fall of authoritarianism and fascism in [[Portugal]] after the [[Carnation Revolution]] of 1974, several neo-fascist [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Salazarist]] groups arose such as the [[New Order (Portugal)]] which was created in 1978. A report by the European Parliament defined the ideology of the New Order as revolutionary fascist and hyper-nationalist.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://bookshop.europa.eu/en/committee-of-inquiry-into-the-rise-of-fascism-and-racism-in-europe-pbAX4686654/ Committee of Inquiry Into the Rise of Fascism and Racism in Europe: Report on the findings of the inquiry]'', European Parliament, Dec 1985, p. 58&lt;/ref&gt; The group also had connections to [[Fuerza Nueva]] in Spain. The New Order was disbanded in 1982, however its activities continued to as late as 1985.

In 2003, Kotleba founded the far-right political party Slovak Togetherness (Slovak: ''[[Slovenská pospolitosť|Slovenská Pospolitosť]]''). In 2007, the Slovak interior ministry banned the party from running and campaigning in elections.

{{main|National Socialism Association}}
The National Socialism Association (NSA) is a neo-fascist political organization founded in [[Taiwan]] in September 2006 by Hsu Na-chi (許娜琦), a 22-year-old female political science graduate of [[Soochow University (Taiwan)|Soochow University]]. The NSA views [[Adolf Hitler]] as its leader and often uses the slogan "Long live Hitler". This has brought them condemnation from the [[Simon Wiesenthal Center]], an international Jewish human rights center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/837697.html |title=Taiwan political activists admiring Hitler draw Jewish protests - Haaretz - Israel News |publisher=Haaretz.com |accessdate=22 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[UK Independence Party]] (UKIP) has been accused by political opponents of holding to elements of fascism e.g. populist nationalist and anti-immigration policies. However, UKIP has denied this, stating that its policies are not anti-immigration but pro-controlled immigration, patriotic not nationalist, in support of British democracy, and for all British citizens without regard to ethnicity or country of birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukip.org/manifesto2015|title=UKIP Election Manifesto 2015|work=UKIP}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, it supports a small state and economic freedom, which are not typically found within Fascism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2013/may/17/nigel-farage-fascist-barrage-ukip |title=Nigel Farage's fascist barrage |author=Michael White |work=The Guardian |location= London |date=17 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A London School of Economics blog examined both UKIP and the BNP and, while it did find similarities in demographic support and a few policies, it failed to conclude any strong ideological links between them.

Groups identified as neo-fascist in the United States generally include neo-Nazi organizations and movements such as the [[National Alliance (United States)|National Alliance]], and the [[American Nazi Party]]. The [[Institute for Historical Review]] publishes [[negationist]] historical papers often of an anti-semitic nature. The [[alt-right]]—which covers a broad range of groups, from authoritarian right-wing [[technocrat]]s and neo-[[monarchist]]s to [[neoreactionaries]] and [[white nationalist]]s—is also often included under the [[umbrella term]] "neo-fascist", as many adhere to a [[Political radicalism|radically]] authoritarian philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2017/aug/17/fascism-history-united-states|title=The United States was never immune to fascism.

In 1951, the [[New European Order]] (NEO) neo-fascist [[Europe]]-wide alliance was set up to promote [[Pan-European nationalism]]. It was a more radical splinter group of the [[European Social Movement]]. The NEO had its origins in the 1951 [[Malmö]] conference when a group of rebels led by [[René Binet (neo-Fascist)|René Binet]] and [[Maurice Bardèche]] refused to join the [[European Social Movement]] as they felt that it did not go far enough in terms of [[Racism|racialism]] and [[anti-communism]]. As a result, Binet joined with [[Gaston-Armand Amaudruz]] in a second meeting that same year in [[Zurich]] to set up a second group pledged to wage war on communists and non-[[white people]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Several [[Cold War]] regimes and international neo-fascist movements collaborated in operations such as assassinations and [[false flag]] bombings. [[Stefano Delle Chiaie]], who was involved in Italy's [[strategy of tension]], took part in [[Operation Condor]]; organizing the 1976 assassination attempt on [[Chile]]an Christian Democrat [[Bernardo Leighton]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB8/nsaebb8.htm Documents concerning attempted assassination] of [[Bernardo Leighton]], on the [[National Security Archives]] website.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vincenzo Vinciguerra]] escaped to [[Spain under Franco|Franquist Spain]] with the help of the [[SISMI]], following the 1972 Peteano attack, for which he was sentenced to life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isn.ethz.ch/php/documents/collection_gladio/Terrorism_Western_Europe.pdf Terrorism Western Europe (PDF)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061107215357/http://www.isn.ethz.ch/php/documents/collection_gladio/Terrorism_Western_Europe.pdf |date=7 November 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isn.ethz.ch/php/news/media_desk.htm#Gladio  Gladio] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061209010857/http://www.isn.ethz.ch/php/news/media_desk.htm#Gladio |date=9 December 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Along with Delle Chiaie, Vinciguerra testified in [[Rome]] in December 1995 before judge Maria Servini de Cubria, stating that Enrique Arancibia Clavel (a former Chilean secret police agent prosecuted for crimes against humanity in 2004) and US expatriate [[Dirección de Inteligencia Nacional|DINA]] agent [[Michael Townley]] were directly involved in General [[Carlos Prats]]' assassination. Michael Townley was sentenced in Italy to 15 years of prison for having served as intermediary between the DINA and the Italian neo-fascists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2000/05/22/mun6.html |title=mun6 |publisher=Jornada.unam.mx |date=22 May 2000 |accessdate=22 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The regimes of [[Francoist Spain]], [[Augusto Pinochet]]'s [[Chile]] and [[Alfredo Stroessner]]'s [[Paraguay]] participated together in [[Operation Condor]], which targeted political opponents worldwide. During the Cold War, these international operations gave rise to some cooperation between various neo-fascist elements engaged in a "[[Crusade]] against Communism".&lt;ref name="Serac"&gt;"During this period we have systematically established close contacts with like-minded groups emerging in Italy, Belgium, Germany, Spain or Portugal, for the purpose of forming the kernel of a truly Western League of Struggle against Marxism."

According to the ''[[Miami Herald]]'', this bombing was decided on at the same meeting during which it was decided to target [[Chile]]an former minister [[Orlando Letelier]], who was assassinated on 21 September 1976. Carriles wrote in his autobiography: "... we the Cubans didn't oppose ourselves to an isolated tyranny, nor to a particular system of our fatherland, but that we had in front of us a colossal enemy, whose main head was in Moscow, with its tentacles dangerously extended on all the planet."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/book/caminos-guerrero-5.htm Preface] to ''Los Caminos del Guerrero'', 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{wiktionary|net}}

A '''net''' (sometimes written '''nett''') value is the resultant amount after accounting for the [[summation|sum]] or [[difference (mathematics)|difference]] of two or more variables.

In [[economics]], it is frequently used to imply the remaining value after accounting for a specific, commonly understood deduction.  In these cases it is contrasted with the term ''[[Gross (economics)|gross]]'', which refers to the pre-deduction value. For example, [[net income]] is the total income of a [[company]] after deducting its [[expenses]]—commonly known as [[Profit (economics)|profit]]—or the total income of an individual after deducting his or her [[income tax]].  Profit may be broken down further into pre-taxed or [[gross profit]] and profit after taxes or [[net profit]].  Similarly, an individual's [[net worth]] the difference between their [[asset]]s (what they own) and their [[liability (financial accounting)|liabilities]] (what they owe to others).

Similarly, [[net investment]] in physical [[capital (economics)|capital]] such as machinery equals [[gross investment|gross (total) investment]] minus the dollar amount of replacement investment that offsets [[depreciation (economics)|depreciation]] of pre-existing machinery, thus giving the change in the amount of machinery available for use. Likewise, [[net national product]] equals [[gross national product]] minus depreciation.

==Etymology==
The word ''net'', in this sense, originally derives from the Latin ''nitere'' (to shine) and ''nitidus'' (elegant, trim), and more recently from the French ''net'' (sharp, neat, clean).&lt;ref&gt;New World Dictionary of the American Language, Simon and Schuster, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grammatical usage==
In this sense, it may appear, separated by a comma, ''following'' the noun it modifies, e.g., "earned two million dollars, net".

==See also==
* [[Net metering]], electricity policy
* [[Net 30]], form of trade credit
* [[Net profit]], gross profit minus overhead and interest
* [[Net weight]], weight of a product, not counting packaging
* [[Net pay]], salary after deductions
* [[Net operating loss]]

The '''Office of Fair Trading''' ('''OFT''') was a [[non-ministerial government department]] of the [[United Kingdom]], established by the [[Fair Trading Act 1973]], which enforced both [[consumer protection]] and [[competition law]], acting as the United Kingdom's [[Economic regulation|economic regulator]]. The OFT's goal was to make markets work well for consumers, ensuring vigorous [[Competition (economics)|competition]] between fair dealing businesses and prohibiting unfair practices such as rogue trading, [[scam]]s, and [[cartel]]s. Its role was modified and its powers changed with the [[Enterprise Act 2002]].

The [[Department for Business, Innovation and Skills]] (BIS) announced reforms to the consumer protection and competition regimes. Under the provisions of the [[Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Act 2013]], the [[Competition and Markets Authority]] (CMA) was established on 1 April 2014 combining many of the functions of the OFT and the [[Competition Commission]] and superseding both.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/press-release-chief-executive-designate-appointed-to-the-competition-and-markets-authority |title=Press Release: Chief Executive Designate appointed to the Competition and Markets Authority |date=8 January 2013 |publisher=Department for Business, Innovation and Skills |accessdate=27 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regulation for the consumer credit industry passed from the OFT to the new [[Financial Conduct Authority]] (FCA) from April 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/banksandfinance/10427157/OFT-instructed-Wonga-to-make-changes-to-its-business.html|title=OFT instructed Wonga to make changes to its business|first=James|last=Quinn|date=5 November 2013|publisher=|accessdate=23 December 2017|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role==
The majority of the OFT’s work consisted of analysing markets, enforcing consumer and competition law, merger control, licensing and supervisory work (of consumer credit, estate agency, anti money laundering supervision), advocacy, delivering information, education programmes and campaigns to business and consumers.&lt;ref&gt;OFT Annual Plan 2011-12&lt;/ref&gt;

{{see also|UK competition law}}
The OFT investigated markets to see whether they were working well for consumers and customers. Where appropriate, studies led to market investigation references to the [[Competition Commission (United Kingdom)|Competition Commission]], to enforce action, consumer awareness campaigns or to recommendations to government, which were published.

Showing how competitive markets that work well are important for consumers, fair dealing businesses and economic performance; explaining its decisions transparently; promoting compliance by explaining to business what the law is and how the OFT will apply it; promoting consumer awareness and confidence; coordinating effectively with enforcement partners locally, nationally and internationally, and advising government on how to achieve the most effective regime for competition and consumers.

==Structure==
The OFT worked under a structure arranged by markets rather than legislation with a Services, Infrastructure and Public Markets group and a Goods and Consumer group. Officials specialising in the different legal and regulatory regimes worked closely together in each of these two groups. This enabled the OFT to look more easily at whole markets and to use all the tools available to improve them if they were not operating effectively. 

The OFT used consumer and competition enforcement, market studies and references, education and communication in appropriate combination. These market sector groups sat alongside other OFT groups, mergers, and cartels and criminal enforcement. The OFT was situated&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TQ3181 : Press Complaints Commission in Salisbury Square|url=https://www.geograph.org.uk/photo/764950|work=Geograph|publisher=Geograph Britain and Ireland|accessdate=26 August 2012|author=Basher Eyre|date=15 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; off Fleet Street, near to [[Blackfriars station]]. It was next to [[St Bride's Church]].

===Markets and Policies Initiatives===
Based on expanded powers granted under the Enterprise Act 2002, the OFT explored how different market sectors operate, in order to help markets work well. It sometimes researched one particular market in detail or, for example, how codes of practice or professional rules operated across different markets in a range of businesses. 

The results of the research, which were published, helped the OFT to assess what action, if any, needed to be taken to protect consumers' interests. They could recommend stronger enforcement, or a change in the regulations, or suggest an awareness raising campaign for consumers (but will not always recommend intervention and when this is the case, will ensure that any non intervention decision is well informed and open to public scrutiny).

In 2006, the OFT restructured in response to Treasury proposals for splitting the department into separate consumer and competition regulators. The OFT argued that to protect consumers effectively, it had to be able to use both consumer law and competition law approaches in a holistic fashion. Moving away from division by legislative area, the OFT created divisions based on market sector. These officials are supported by a dedicated economics branch also including statisticians and financial analysts (the Office of the Chief Economist), a legal specialist, and a policy advisory branch.

==Cases==

===Credit card charges===
In May 2006, the OFT investigated the charges being imposed on customers of [[credit card]] companies. In its report, the OFT confirmed these charges were unlawful as they amounted to a penalty, rather than the actual losses suffered by the companies. It said it would be prepared to investigate any charge over £12 (£16 for [[Egg Banking|Egg]] credit card accounts)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Press releases 2006 -  Statement on bank credit card default fees|url=http://www.oft.gov.uk/news/press/2006/credit-cards|work=Office of Fair Trading|publisher=Office of Fair Trading|accessdate=26 August 2012|author=Office of Fair Trading|date=18 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; indicating that £12 would not be a "fair and acceptable charge" itself. The OFT said it would be up to a court to determine such an amount based on the established legal precedent that the only recoverable cost would be actual costs incurred, i.e., [[liquidated damages]].

The credit card companies did not produce evidence of their actual costs to the OFT, instead insisting their charges are in line with clear policy and information provided to customers. Charges have been as much as £38 per item, which campaigners argue is well beyond the cost of sending a computerised letter.

===Deceptive websites===
In 2009, after customers complained to OFT about deceptive practices by two websites operated by a man in the state of California that misrepresented themselves as being British, it coordinated actions with the U.S. [[Federal Trade Commission]], which began [[FTC v. Balls of Kryptonite|an enforcement action]]. Two years later a [[consent decree]] required the companies to end those practices and represent their location honestly.&lt;ref name="FTC v. Balls of Kryptonite"&gt;{{cite press release |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=FTC Settlement Bans Online U.S. Electronics Retailer from Deceiving Consumers with Foreign Website Names |url=https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2011/06/ftc-settlement-bans-online-us-electronics-retailer-deceiving |location=Washington|agency=Federal Trade Commission|date=9 June 2011 |access-date=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Debt management companies===
In September 2010, the OFT sent warnings to 129 firms after its review of debt management companies found widespread problems, with firms putting profits ahead of customer care. Since it issued that warning, 87 firms have surrendered their licenses.

===Transfer of cash ISAs===
In March 2010, Consumer Focus submitted a super complaint to the OFT raising concerns that transferring cash ISAs were taking too long and there were arbitrary rules preventing transfers into some of the most attractive accounts and that interest rates were not sufficiently transparent.

The OFT responded in June 2011, with a number of recommendations to ensure that transfers of cash ISAs work better and that there is greater transparency of interest rates. This included the following agreements from cash ISA provider to:
* Comply with new industry guidelines to complete end to end transfers within 15 working days
* Provide personalised interest rate information on cash ISA statements delivered in electronic and/or paper form

===Reckitt Benckiser===
In April 2011, the OFT fined [[Reckitt Benckiser]] £10.2 million after it found that it had abused its dominant position in the market for the [[National Health Service]] (NHS) supply of alginate and antacid [[heartburn]] medicines. The OFT found that Reckitt Benckiser abused its dominant position by withdrawing and de-listing Gaviscon Original Liquid from the NHS prescription channel in 2005.

===Groupon===
In March 2012, the OFT accepted undertakings from "daily deals" company MyCityDeal, which trades as [[Groupon]], to change some of its trading practices following an OFT investigation. The investigation found widespread examples of Groupon's practices that breached consumer protection regulations. The OFT had specific concerns over practices involving reference pricing, advertising, refunds, unfair terms, and the diligence of its interactions with merchants. Groupon engaged openly and constructively throughout the investigation and signed undertakings that it will change its practices to comply with the law.&lt;ref name="groupon"&gt;{{cite news|title=Groupon vows to offer 'honest and accurate' deals, following OFT rap|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/mar/16/groupon-honest-accurate-deals-oft|accessdate=11 February 2018|work=The Guardian|date=16 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hotel Online Booking ===
In September 2012, the OFT commenced an investigation into the Hotel Online Booking Sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oft.gov.uk/oftwork/competition-act-and-cartels/ca98/closure/online-booking/|title=Investigation into the hotel online booking sector|first=Sara|last=George|date=31 January 2014|website=webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk|accessdate=23 December 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20140402142426/http://oft.gov.uk/oftwork/competition-act-and-cartels/ca98/closure/online-booking/|archivedate=2 April 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The complainant, a small online travel agent, Skoosh, claimed that the hotels it bought room bookings from were under pressure from other resellers to maintain minimum prices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/09/21/oft_hotel_investigation/|title=Online hotel bookings to be probed for price-fixing|publisher=|accessdate=23 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 31 July 2012, the OFT issued a Statement of Objections against [[Booking.com]], [[Expedia]], and [[Intercontinental Hotels]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oft.gov.uk/news-and-updates/press/2012/65-12|title=OFT issues Statement of Objections against Booking.com, Expedia and Intercontinental Hotels Group|first=Public|last=user|date=31 July 2012|website=webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk|accessdate=23 December 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20140402142426/http://oft.gov.uk/news-and-updates/press/2012/65-12|archivedate=2 April 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the OFT's provisional view the parties had infringed competition law. In January 2014, the OFT accepted commitments proposal from the defendant parties in lieu of any fines. The OFT's Rasmussen acknowledged there was a chance the set up could lead to further monopoly, but he said the OFT would be monitoring movements in the market.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-25975746|title=OFT probe into hotel prices closes|first=Pippa|last=Stephens|date=23 December 2017|publisher=|accessdate=23 December 2017|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2014, the price comparison site, [[Skyscanner]], challenged the OFT's decision with the United Kingdom's [[Competition Appeal Tribunal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catribunal.org.uk/237-8431/1226-2-12-14-Skyscanner-Limited.html|title=Competition Appeal Tribunal - 1226/2/12/14 Skyscanner Limited|website=www.catribunal.org.uk|accessdate=23 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reputation==
The OFT was criticized for being ineffective and for many of its investigations leading to no action, in contrast to the more vigorous approach of United States ([[United States Department of Justice Antitrust Division]]) and [[European Union]] ([[Directorate-General for Competition (European Commission)|Directorate-General for Competition]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Competition|url=http://ec.europa.eu/competition/index_en.html|work=European Commission|publisher=Europe Direct|accessdate=26 August 2012|author=Europe Direct|date=31 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; regulators. Criticism has been levied, among others, in the cases of:
* Supermarkets&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FAIR TRADING REMAINS TOOTHLESS IN FACE OF TESCO|url=http://nickharveymp.com/en/article/2008/400300/fair-trading-remains-toothless-in-face-of-tesco|work=Nick Harvey MP|publisher=Nick Harvey MP|accessdate=26 August 2012|author=Unknown|date=23 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Oil companies retail sales / petrol – in October 2008, UK Prime Minister [[Gordon Brown]] threatened oil companies with an OFT investigation unless lower oil prices were passed to consumers;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brown: Petrol firms must lower fuel prices or face OFT inquiry|url=http://www.odac-info.org/node/4810|work=Oil Depletion Analysis Centre (ODAC) (from ''The Independent'')|publisher=Oil Depletion Analysis Centre (ODAC)|accessdate=26 August 2012|author=Andrew Grice|date=17 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; this was despite several OFT investigations in the past giving the industry a clean bill of health.

The [[National Audit Office (United Kingdom)|National Audit Office]] issued a report in March 2009 on the OFT's competition enforcement work&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nao.org.uk//idoc.ashx?docId=DF630BBD-6ADE-44EB-B3CB-8672AE6C316A&amp;version=-1 |title=The Office of Fair Trading - Progress Report on Maintaining Competition in Markets |publisher=National Audit Office |date=2009-03-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which indicated progress in 7 out of 10 objectives, but also concluded:
:''...So whilst the OFT has improved the value for money it provides, there remains scope for further improvement.''

According to the same report, in 2007 to 2008 the OFT estimated that its competition enforcement work led to direct savings to consumers worth £77m per year and that its market studies work had saved consumers £98 million in 2007 to 08;&lt;ref&gt;page 13 of the report&lt;/ref&gt; the OFT costs for these areas of work in the same year were approximately £26 million of its £78 million expenditure in 2007 to 208.&lt;ref&gt;page 5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Super Complaints==
The following bodies and companies were designated by the Secretary of State as being able to bring a super-complaint to the OFT:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.berr.gov.uk/whatwedo/consumers/enforcement/super-complaints/page17902.html |title=Super-Complaints |first=Marie |last=Cawley |publisher=BERR |date= |deadurl=yes |archivedate=2008-11-22 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081122091549/http://www.berr.gov.uk/whatwedo/consumers/enforcement/super-complaints/page17902.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In common law jurisdictions, the generic term '''officer of the court''' is applied to all those who, in some degree in function of their professional or similar qualifications, have a part in the [[legal system]]. Officers of the court should not be confused with [[court officer]]s, the law enforcement personnel who work in courts.  

Officers of the court have legal and [[Deontological ethics|ethical]] obligations. They are tasked to participate to the best of their ability in functioning of the judicial system as a whole, in order to forge justice out of the application of the law and the simultaneous pursuit of the legitimate interests of all parties and the general good of society.

Officers of the court can be divided into the following functional groups. In most case various synonyms and parallels exist as well as a variety of operational variations, depending on the jurisdiction and the changes in relevant legislation:

==Court proper==
Foremost those who make the decisions that determine the course of justice and its outcome:
*[[judge]]s, [[magistrate]]s and [[arbitrator]]s,
*[[prosecutor]]s and crime victim advocates.
*[[Lawyer|attorneys]] for each party – the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] held in ''[[Ex parte Garland]]''&lt;ref&gt;''[[Ex parte Garland]]'', [[case citation|71 U. S. 333 (1866)]]&lt;/ref&gt; that "Attorneys and counselors are not officers of the United States; they are officers of the court, admitted as such by its order upon evidence of their possessing sufficient legal learning and fair private character."  In some jurisdictions, such as [[England and Wales]], independent advocates such as [[barristers]] are not officers of the court.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

==Investigation and expertise==
These are people who may appear in court and testify or offer opinions due to their expertise or experience in a given subject. Their opinions sometimes rise to the level of scientific evidence, and are evaluated by judges and juries to reach conclusions or verdicts. Another term for persons consulted by a court is ''[[amici curiae]]''.
*[[Coroner]]s, [[medical examiner]]s, mental health professionals, and other medical experts.
*Other experts in various fields, such as state certified appraisers, [[certified public accountants]], [[handwriting analysis]] experts, and other professionally licensed or certified persons retained by the parties to give expert advice, the testimony and exhibits of which is admitted by the Court.
*[[Marshals]], [[sheriffs]], [[constables]], and other kinds of [[peace officers]]

==Services to the parties==
These are people whose professional duties are important to the functioning of the court system.
*[[Bail bondsmen]], who may however undertake action to capture an absconding client.
*[[Interpreting|Interpreters]]/[[Translation|translators]] are generally considered officers of the court.  They render their services to the parties in the interests of the court proceedings.  There are interpreters who may be employed on a permanent basis by courts to act as interpreters when called upon, e.g. [[International Court of Justice]] and the [[European Court of Justice]]. In some jurisdictions, interpreters may also be deemed as officers of the court ''[[pro tempore]]''. Court interpreters and translators have an absolute ethical duty to tell judges the truth and avoid evasion.
*[[Court-appointed special advocate]]s in some jurisdictions are considered officers of the court.
*[[Service of process|Process servers]] carry out service of process. In some jurisdictions they are appointed by a court and are considered appointed officers of the court.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3896">The '''Ohlson O-Score for predicting bankruptcy''' is a multi-factor financial formula postulated in 1980 by Dr. [[James Ohlson]] of the [[New York University]] Stern Accounting Department as an alternative to the [[Altman Z-score]] for predicting financial distress.&lt;ref name="ycharts"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ycharts.com/glossary/terms/ohlson_score|title=Ohlson's O-Score Definition|website=ycharts.com|accessdate=2014-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Calculation of the O-Score==
The Ohlson O-Score is the result of a 9-factor linear combination of [[coefficient]]-weighted business ratios which are readily obtained or derived from the standard periodic financial disclosure statements provided by publicly traded corporations.  Two of the factors utilized are widely considered to be dummies as their value and thus their impact upon the formula typically is 0.&lt;ref name="stockopedia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stockopedia.com/content/improving-on-the-altman-z-score-part-2-the-ohlson-o-score-70800/|title=Improving On The Altman Z-Score, Part 2: The Ohlson O-Score | first = Jonathan | last = Stokes | date = 13 February 2013 | website=stockopedia.com|accessdate=2014-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When using an O-Score to evaluate the probability of company’s failure, then exp(O-Score) is divided by 1&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;exp(O-score).&lt;ref name="fdic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fdic.gov/bank/analytical/cfr/2008/jan/CFR_SS_2008_KarlynMitchell.pdf|date=7 January 2008|title=Bankers on Boards, Financial Constraints, and Financial Distress (''Preliminary and incomplete. Please do not quote.'')| first1 = Karlyn | last1 = Mitchell | first2 = Mark D. | last2 = Walker|accessdate=2014-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The calculation for Ohlson’s O-Score appears below:&lt;ref name="JStor"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://teaching.ust.hk/~ismt551/project2/Ohlson.pdf|title=Financial Ratios and the Probabilistic Prediction of Bankruptcy|author=James A. Ohlson|accessdate=2014-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
T = {} &amp; -1.32 - 0.407\log(TA_t/GNP) + 6.03\frac{TL_t}{TA_t} - 1.43\frac{WC_t}{TA_t} + 0.0757\frac{CL_t}{CA_t} \\[10pt]
&amp; {} - 1.72 X - 2.37\frac{NI_t}{TA_t} - 1.83\frac{FFO_t}{TL_t} + 0.285Y - 0.521\frac{NI_t-NI_{t-1}}{|NI_t| + |NI_{t-1}|}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

where

* ''TA'' = [[total assets]]
* ''GNP'' = [[Gross National Product price index level]]
* ''TL'' = [[total liabilities]]
* ''WC'' = [[working capital]]
* ''CL'' = current liabilities
* ''CA'' = [[current assets]]
* ''X'' = 1 if ''TL'' &gt; ''TA'', 0 otherwise
* ''NI'' = [[net income]]
* ''FFO'' = funds from operations
* ''Y'' = 1 if a [[net loss]] for the last two years, 0 otherwise

==Interpretation==

The original model for the O-Score was derived from the study of a pool of just over 2000 companies, whereas by comparison its predecessor the Altman Z-Score considered just 66 companies. As a result, the O-Score is significantly more accurate a predictor of bankruptcy within a 2-year period. The original Z-Score was estimated to be over 70% accurate with its later variants reaching as high as 90% accuracy. The O-Score is more accurate than this.

However, no mathematical model is 100% accurate, so while the O-Score may forecast bankruptcy or solvency, factors both inside and outside of the formula can impact its accuracy. Furthermore, later [[bankruptcy prediction]] models such as the hazard based model proposed by Campbell, Hilscher, and Szilagyi in 2011&lt;ref name="citeseerx"&gt;{{cite paper | citeseerx = 10.1.1.233.2093 | title = Predicting financial distress and the performance of distressed stocks | first1 = John Y. | last1 = Campbell | first2 = Jens | last2 = Hilscher | first3 = Jan | last3 = Szilagyi }}&lt;/ref&gt; have proven more accurate still. For the O-Score, any results larger than 0.5 suggests that the firm will default within two years.

Operation Payback started as retaliation to [[denial-of-service attack|distributed denial of service]] (DDoS) attacks on [[Torrent file|torrent]] sites; piracy proponents then decided to launch DDoS attacks on piracy opponents. The initial reaction snowballed into a wave of attacks on major pro-copyright and anti-piracy organizations, law firms, and individuals.

Following the [[United States diplomatic cables leak]] in December 2010, the organizers commenced DDoS attacks on websites of banks who had withdrawn banking facilities from [[WikiLeaks]].

==Background and initial attacks==
[[File:Operation Payback GMlegal.png|thumb|left|Media detailing the attack on Gallant Macmillan]]
In 2010, several [[Bollywood]] companies hired [[Aiplex Software]] to launch DDoS attacks on websites that did not respond to [[takedown notice]]s.&lt;ref name="theregister1"&gt;{{cite news |title=4chan launches DDoS against entertainment industry |first=John |last=Leyden |newspaper=[[The Register]] |date=2010-09-22 |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/09/20/4chan_ddos_mpaa_riaa/ |accessdate=2010-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-11371315 |title=Activists target recording industry websites |date=2010-09-20 |accessdate=2010-10-27 |publisher=[[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Piracy activists then created Operation Payback in September 2010 in retaliation.&lt;ref name="theregister1"/&gt; The original plan was to attack Aiplex Software directly, but upon finding some hours before the planned DDoS that another individual had taken down the firm's website on their own, Operation Payback moved to launching attacks against the websites of copyright stringent organisations [[Motion Picture Association of America]] (MPAA) and [[International Federation of the Phonographic Industry]], giving the two websites a combined total downtime of 30 hours.&lt;ref name="torrentfreak"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://torrentfreak.com/4chan-ddos-takes-down-mpaa-and-anti-piracy-websites-100918/ |title=4chan DDoS Takes Down MPAA and Anti-Piracy Websites |date=2010-09-18 |publisher=[[TorrentFreak]] |accessdate=2010-10-27 |author=enigmax}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pandalabssecurity"&gt;{{cite news |title=4chan Users Organize Surgical Strike Against MPAA |newspaper=Pandalabs Security |first=Luis |last=Corrons |date=2010-09-17 |url=http://pandalabs.pandasecurity.com/4chan-users-organize-ddos-against-mpaa/ |accessdate=2010-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the following two days, Operation Payback attacked a multitude of sites affiliated with the MPAA, the [[Recording Industry Association of America]] (RIAA),&lt;ref name="torrentfreak-2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://torrentfreak.com/4chan-to-ddos-riaa-next-is-this-the-protest-of-the-future-100919/ |title=4chan to DDoS RIAA Next – Is This the Protest of the Future? |date=2010-09-19 |publisher=TorrentFreak |accessdate=2010-10-27 |author=enigmax}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[British Phonographic Industry]].&lt;ref name="theregister1"/&gt; Law firms such as [[ACS:Law]], [[Davenport Lyons]] and Dunlap, Grubb &amp; Weaver (of the [[US Copyright Group]]) were also attacked.&lt;ref name="theregister2"&gt;{{cite news |title=Piracy threats lawyer mocks 4chan DDoS attack |first=Chris |last=Williams |newspaper=The Register |date=2010-09-22 |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/09/22/acs_4chan/ |accessdate=2010-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="theregister3"&gt;{{cite news |title=Second piracy threat lawyers withstand DDoS attack |first=John |last=Leyden |newspaper=The Register |date=2010-09-24 |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/09/24/piracy_threat_lawyers_withstand_ddos/ |accessdate=2010-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ars"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/news/2010/09/operation-payback-attacks-continue-until-we-stop-being-angry.ars |title="Operation Payback" attacks to go until "we stop being angry" |first=Nate |last=Anderson |publisher=[[Ars Technica]] |date=2010-09-30 |accessdate=2010-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="slyck"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slyck.com/news.php?story=2066 |title=US Copyright Group and Web Sheriff Targeted in DDoS Attack |first=Thomas |last=Mennecke |publisher=[[Slyck]] |date=2010-09-29 |accessdate=2010-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Law firms===

On September 21, 2010, the website of United Kingdom law firm [[ACS:Law]] was subjected to a DDoS attack as part of Operation Payback. When asked about the attacks, Andrew Crossley, owner of ACS:Law, said: "It was only down for a few hours. I have far more concern over the fact of my train turning up 10 minutes late or having to queue for a coffee than them wasting my time with this sort of rubbish."&lt;ref name="theregister2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ars" /&gt;

When the site came back online a 350[[Megabyte|MB]] file,  which was a backup of the site, was visible to anyone for a short period of time.&lt;ref name="theregister4"&gt;{{cite news |title=Anti-piracy lawyers' email database leaked after hack |first=John |last=Leydon |newspaper=The Register |date=2010-09-27 |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/09/27/anti_piracy_lawyer_email_leak/ |accessdate=2010-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The backup, which included copies of emails sent by the firm, was downloaded and made available on various [[peer-to-peer]] networks and websites including [[The Pirate Bay]].&lt;ref name="theregister4"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2010-09/27/leaked-emails-fuel-anti-piracy-scandal |title=Leaked emails fuel anti-piracy scandal |first=Duncan |last=Geere |publisher=Wired.co.uk |date=2010-09-27 |accessdate=2010-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://torrentfreak.com/acslaw-anti-piracy-law-firm-torn-apart-by-leaked-emails-100925/ |title=ACS:Law Anti Piracy Law Firm Torn Apart by Leaked Emails |author=enigmax |publisher=TorrentFreak |date=2010-09-25 |accessdate=2010-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the emails contained unencrypted [[Microsoft Excel|Excel]] spreadsheets, listing the names and addresses of people that ACS:Law had accused of illegally sharing media. One contained more than 5,300 [[Sky broadband]] customers whom they had accused of illegally sharing [[pornography]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Emery |first=Daniel |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-11418962 |title=Adult video-sharing list leaked from law firm |publisher=BBC News |date=2010-09-27 |accessdate=2010-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/11430299 |title='My details appeared on 'porn' list' |date=2010-09-28 |publisher=BBC |accessdate=2010-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; while another contained the details of 8,000 Sky customers and 400 [[Plusnet]] customers accused of infringing the copyright on music by sharing it on [[Peer-to-peer file sharing|peer-to-peer networks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Emery |first=Daniel |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-11425789|title=Fresh ACS:Law file-sharing lists expose thousands more|date=2010-09-28 |accessdate=2010-09-28 |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; This alleged breach of the [[Data Protection Act 1998|Data Protection Act]] has become part of the ongoing investigation into ACS:Law by the [[Information Commissioner's Office]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Emery |first=Daniel |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-11434809|title=BT embroiled in ACS:Law porn list breach|date=2010-09-29 |accessdate=2010-09-29 |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Emery |first=Daniel |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-11418970|title=ACS:Law could face £500,000 fine for porn list leak|date=2010-09-28 |accessdate=2010-09-28 |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 30, the [[Leesburg, Virginia]] office of Dunlap, Grubb &amp; Weaver law firm &amp;ndash; also doing business as the "[[US Copyright Group|U.S. Copyright Group]]"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20100903/11144710895.shtml |title=Hurt Locker Subpoenas Arrive With New Language...

These attacks were originally organized through an [[Internet Relay Chat]] channel.&lt;ref name="theregister1"/&gt; The attacks also became a popular topic on [[Twitter]].&lt;ref name="theregister1"/&gt;

===Australian pro-copyright organization===

On September 27, 2010, the DDoS attack on the [[AFACT|Australian Federation Against Copyright Theft]] (AFACT) unintentionally brought down 8,000 other small websites hosted on the same server.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Operation Payback directs DDoS attack at AFACT |first=Brett |last=Winterford |url=http://www.itnews.com.au/News/233573,operation-payback-directs-ddos-attack-at-afact.aspx |newspaper=iTnews |date=2010-09-28 |accessdate=2010-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===ACAPOR===

In September 2010, in an attempt to ensure that [[Portugal|Portuguese]] citizens can't access ''thepiratebay.org'', Associação do Comércio Audiovisual de Portugal (ACAPOR) filed a complaint against [[The Pirate Bay]].  The complaint was filed with the General Inspection of Cultural Activities, which is part of the [[Ministry of Culture (Portugal)|Portuguese Ministry of Culture]]. According to the movie rental association, The Pirate Bay is directly responsible for about 15 million illegal downloads in Portugal every year. By installing a Pirate Bay block on all [[Internet service provider|ISP]]s, ACAPOR hoped to decrease the financial damage it claims The Pirate Bay causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://torrentfreak.com/movie-rental-outfit-calls-for-nationwide-pirate-bay-block-100916/ |title=Movie Rental Outfit Calls For Nationwide Pirate Bay Block |publisher=TorrentFreak |date=2010-09-16 |author=Ernesto |accessdate=2010-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 18, 2010, the ACAPOR website was [[website defacement|defaced]], presenting text from Operation Payback and a redirect to The Pirate Bay after a few seconds. In addition to defacing the website, a copy of the email database of ACAPOR was uploaded to The Pirate Bay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://torrentfreak.com/movie-rental-outfit-hacked-emails-leaked-redirected-to-the-pirate-bay-101018/|title=Movie Rental Outfit Hacked, Emails Leaked, Redirected to The Pirate Bay |author=Ernesto |date=2010-10-18 |publisher=TorrentFreak |accessdate=2010-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unitethecows.com/content/299-acapor-emails-leaked-pirate-bay.html |title=ACAPOR Emails Leaked to The Pirate Bay |first=Brian |last=Houston |date=2010-10-18 |work=unitethecows.com |accessdate=2010-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The leaked e-mails so far revealed ACAPOR's methods of denunciation, its dissatisfaction with the Portuguese government and justice system,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://peerauthority.com/acapor1/ |title=A Look Into ACAPOR's Emails: Denunciation, Discontent and Education |first=Pavel |last=Mitov |publisher=Peer Authority |date=2010-10-04 |accessdate=2010-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; its perception of the copyright debate as war, and its antagonism with the ISPs. ACAPOR claimed that "the business of ISPs is illegal downloading."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://peerauthority.com/acapor2/ |title=Back to ACAPOR: The War and the ISP |first=Pavel |last=Mitov |publisher=Peer Authority |date=2010-10-11 |accessdate=2010-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===More attacks===

On October 4, 2010, Operation Payback launched an attack on the [[Ministry of Sound]] website and the Gallant Macmillan website.&lt;ref name="theregister5"&gt;{{cite news |title=Ministry of Sound floored by Anonymous |first=John |last=Leydon |newspaper=The Register |date=2010-10-04 |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/10/04/ministry_of_sound_ddos/ |accessdate=2010-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Musician and copyright advocate===

During the 2010 [[MIPCOM]] convention, [[Gene Simmons]] of [[Kiss (band)|KISS]] stated:

Some of you may have heard a few popcorn farts re: our sites being threatened by hackers.

Our legal team and the FBI have been on the case and we have found a few, shall we say "adventurous" young people, who feel they are above the law.

And, as stated in my MIPCOM speech, we will sue their pants off.

First, they will be punished.

Second, they might find their little butts in jail, right next to someone who's been there for years and is looking for a new girl friend.&lt;/p&gt;

[[File:Operation Payback.png|thumb|Poster detailing the attack on the RIAA]]
On October 26, 2010, [[LimeWire]] was ordered to disable the "searching, downloading, uploading, file trading and/or file distribution functionality" after losing a court battle with the [[RIAA]] over claims of copyright infringement. Not satisfied with the injunction, the RIAA announced its intention to continue the ''[[Arista Records LLC v. Lime Group LLC]]'' trial to recover damages caused by the program.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN2616212420101026 |title=Court shuts down LimeWire music-sharing service |work=[[Reuters]] |first1=Yinka |last1=Adegoke |first2=Jonathan |last2=Stempel |date=2010-10-26 |accessdate=2010-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-31001_3-20020786-261.html |title=Judge slaps Lime Wire with permanent injunction |first=Greg |last=Sandoval |work=[[CNET]] |date=2010-10-26 |accessdate=2010-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In retaliation,&lt;ref name="cnbc"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/39910518 |title=The Shared Enemy of Hollywood, Gene Simmons and Hustler |first=Chris |last=Morris |date=2010-10-29 |publisher=[[CNBC]] |accessdate=2010-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; members of Operation Payback announced that they would attack RIAA's website on October 29, despite the fact that the group typically does not hit the same target twice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slyck.com/story2109_Anonymous_Planning_DDoS_Attack_Against_the_RIAA |title=Anonymous Planning DDoS Attack Against the RIAA |date=2010-10-28 |publisher=Slyck.com |first=Thomas |last=Mennecke |accessdate=2010-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2371670,00.asp |title='Anonymous' Plans DDoS Attack on RIAA on Friday |date=2010-10-28 |first=Mark |last=Hachman |publisher=[[PC Magazine]] |accessdate=2010-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On October 29, ''riaa.org'' indeed was taken offline via [[denial-of-service attack]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.slyck.com/story2110_RIAA_and_LimeWire_Both_Are_Offline |title=RIAA and LimeWire Both are Offline |date=2010-10-29 |first=Thomas |last=Mennecke |publisher=[[Slyck.com]] |accessdate=2010-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2371784,00.asp |title='Anonymous' DDoS Attack Takes Down RIAA Site |date=2010-10-29 |first=Mark |last=Hachman |publisher=PC Magazine |accessdate=2010-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the attack, ''riaa.com'' and ''riaa.org'' sites were inaccessible in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.softpedia.com/news/Anonymous-Attacks-RIAA-over-LimeWire-Shutdown-164053.shtml |title=Anonymous Attacks RIAA over LimeWire Shutdown |date=2010-11-01 |first=Lucian |last=Constantin |publisher=[[Softpedia]] |accessdate=2010-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Operation Payback's main site was attacked later that day, and they subsequently moved their website from ''tieve.tk'' to ''anonops.net''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/11/01/riaa_anon_ddos/ |title=RIAA and Anonymous sites both downed by DDoS assaults |date=2010-11-01 |first=John |last=Leyden |publisher=The Register |accessdate=2010-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="net-security"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.net-security.org/secworld.php?id=10080 |title=RIAA's sites downed by Anonymous DDoS attack |date=2010-11-01 |work=net-security.org |first=Zeljika |last=Zorz |accessdate=2010-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===November 5, 2010 attacks===

Around October 28, 2010, the group set up a new website with the intention of coordinating protests around the world to raise awareness of their cause. The date for the protest activities were on November 5, the intended day of the [[Gunpowder Plot]], with which Anonymous heavily affiliates through its use of [[Guy Fawkes]] masks.

The protest activity included an attack on the [[United States Copyright Office]], after which the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] launched an investigation.&lt;ref name="cnet"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-31001_3-20022264-261.html |title=FBI probes 4chan's 'Anonymous' DDoS attacks |first=Greg |last=Sandoval |publisher=[[CNET.com]] |date=2010-11-09 |accessdate=2010-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; They later arrested one person accused of taking part in the attack on [[PayPal]].&lt;ref name=nl&gt;{{cite news|last=Sterling|first=Toby|title=Dutch give details on 4 'Anonymous' hacker arrests|url=http://news.smh.com.au/breaking-news-technology/dutch-give-details-on-4-anonymous-hacker-arrests-20110721-1hp9g.html|accessdate=21 July 2011|newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=21 July 2011|agency=[[Fairfax Media]]|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/60Lj08HZB|archivedate=21 July 2011|location=[[Sydney]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hiatus and resumption of website attacks===
On November 9, 2010, Operation Payback temporarily ceased attacking websites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.myce.com/news/operation-payback-takes-a-break-but-for-how-long-36311/ |title=Operation Payback takes a break… but for how long? |author=wconeybeer |date=2010-11-09 |work=myce.com |accessdate=2010-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hiatus lasted about four months, ending with an early March 2011 attack that temporarily took down the website of [[Broadcast Music, Inc.|BMI]], a prominent collection society operating on behalf of music publishers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2011/03/anonymous-revives-operation-payback-targets-copywrong/|title=Anonymous revives Operation Payback, wages war on "copywrong"|date=2012-03-08|accessdate=2012-10-16|last=Anderson|first=Nate|publisher=[[ArsTechnica]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed by the aforementioned second attack on the RIAA website.

==Sarah Palin==
On December 8, 2010, U.S politician [[Sarah Palin]] announced that her website and personal credit card information were compromised.&lt;ref name="sarah-1"/&gt; Palin's team believed the attack was executed by Anonymous, though Anonymous never commented about Palin as a possible target for any attack.&lt;ref name="sarah-1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="metro"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metro.co.uk/tech/849918-sarah-palin-website-hit-by-wikileaks-operation-payback-ddos-attack |title=Sarah Palin website hit by WikiLeaks Operation Payback DDoS attack |date=2010-12-09 |accessdate=2010-12-09 |work=metro.co.uk |publisher=[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]] |first=Tom |last=Phillips}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sarah-2"/&gt; In an interview with [[RT (TV network)|RT]], an Anonymous member said, "We don't really care about Sarah Palin that much, to be honest.

In December 2010, [[WikiLeaks]] came under intense pressure to stop publishing secret U.S. diplomatic cables. Corporations such as [[Amazon.com|Amazon]], [[PayPal]], [[BankAmerica]], Swiss bank [[PostFinance]], [[MasterCard]] and [[Visa Inc.|Visa]] either stopped working with or froze their customers' donations to WikiLeaks due to political pressures.

Operation Payback's attempt to take down Amazon.com was aborted after they failed to recruit enough users to their botnet; CNN noted that the massive Amazon website "is almost impossible to crash."&lt;ref name="AmazonAborted"/&gt;&lt;!-- The failed DDoS attack has been attributed to Amazon's massive server capacity, which is normally used to handle the excessive traffic during the December [[holiday shopping season]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Why attackers can't take down Amazon.com |url=http://money.cnn.com/2010/12/09/technology/amazon_wikileaks_attack/ |first=Julianne |last=Pepitone |work=CNNMoney.com |publisher=CNN.com |date=2010-12-09 |accessdate=2010-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

In late December, the FBI began to raid suspected participants in Operation Payback.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=FBI raids ISP in Anonymous DDoS investigation |url=http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9202838/FBI_raids_ISP_in_Anonymous_DDoS_investigation?taxonomyId=86 |first=Robert |last=McMillan |work=Computerworld.com |publisher=computerworld.com |date=2010-12-30 |accessdate=2010-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the beginning of 2011, Operation Payback brought down [[Zimbabwe]]an government websites after the Zimbabwean [[Robert Mugabe|President's]] [[Grace Mugabe|wife]] sued a newspaper for $15 million for publishing a WikiLeaks cable that linked her with the alleged trade in [[Blood diamond|illicit diamonds]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/technology/technology-news/wikileaks-supporters-attack-zimbabwean-sites-20110102-19d1x.html|title=WikiLeaks supporters attack Zimbabwean sites|work=The Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt; On January 27, 2011, five males aged between 15 and 26 were arrested in early morning raids in the U.K. on suspicion of involvement,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-12299137|title=Five arrested over 'Anonymous' web attacks|date=27 January 2011|accessdate=30 January 2011|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the FBI executed 40 search warrants the same day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/28/us/28wiki.html?_r=1  |title=F.B.I. Warrants Into Service Attacks by WikiLeaks Supporters |date=2011-01-27 |last=Savage |first=Charlie |accessdate=2011-01-30 |publisher=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
The [[United Kingdom Intellectual Property Office]] said that when its site was attacked, those responsible were depriving its citizens of access to information they have a democratic right to access.&lt;ref name="cmu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thecmuwebsite.com/article/riaa-site-goes-down-following-limewire-win/ |title=RIAA site goes down following LimeWire win |date=2010-11-01 |author=cmumusicnews |work=thecmuwebsite.com |accessdate=2010-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other critics claimed the attacks restricted Gene Simmons' right to free speech.&lt;ref name="cmu" /&gt;

A spokesman for the MPAA said, "It's troubling that these groups seem more concerned about the rights of those who steal and copy films, music, books, and other creative resources than the rights of American workers who are producing these products." &lt;ref name="cnet"/&gt;

There was also some criticism from the [[Pirate Party UK]] and [[United States Pirate Party]], which in a joint public statement urged the group to "Immediately cease the Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks and to instead seek out a legal method to express your frustration and disquiet with the copyright industry, and their perversions of copyright law for personal gain."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://torrentfreak.com/pirate-parties-use-influence-to-halt-operation-payback-101120/ |title=Pirate Parties Use Influence to Halt Anonymous Operation Payback |date=2010-11-20 |author=enigmax |publisher=TorrentFreak |work=torrentfreak.com |accessdate=2010-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While acknowledging that the DDoS attacks on credit card and banking web sites serve as political protests, cyber experts said that Operation Payback has not done any long-term damage: most sites are back online, these attacks have not penetrated and brought down entire banking systems used to conduct transactions, and people are still continuing to use their credit cards to make payments. "This is more like a noisy political demonstration, like a mob surrounding a bank and refusing to let anyone in or out" said one cyber expert.&lt;ref name="AFP_NoBite"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/Todays-News-1-20183-WikiLeaks-cyber-backlash-all-bark-no-bite-experts |title=WikiLeaks cyber backlash all bark, no bite: experts |date=2010-12-11 |agency=[[Agence France-Presse]] |publisher=[[The News International]] |accessdate=2015-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tools and communication==

Operation Payback members used a modified version of the [[Low Orbit Ion Cannon]] (LOIC) to execute the DDoS attacks.&lt;ref name="softpedia1"&gt;{{cite news |title=Anonymous DDoS Tool Gets Botnet Capabilities |first=Lucian |last=Constantin |newspaper=[[Softpedia]] |date=2010-09-27 |url=http://news.softpedia.com/news/Anonymous-DDoS-Tool-Gets-Botnet-Capabilities-158163.shtml |accessdate=2010-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In September 2010, a "Hive Mind" mode was added to the LOIC.&lt;ref name="softpedia1"/&gt;  While in Hive Mind mode, the LOIC connects to [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]], where it can be controlled remotely. This allows computers with LOIC installed on them to behave as if they were a part of a [[botnet]].  Utilising this tool, the coordinators of Operation Payback were able to quickly take down websites belonging to anti-piracy groups.&lt;ref name="softpedia1"/&gt;  Botnets of all sizes have also been used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pandalabs.pandasecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/ScreenHunter_01-Sep.-17-13.07.jpg |title=Operation Payback flyer from mpaa.org attack |date=2010-09-17 |accessdate=2010-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of Operation Payback reportedly used an [[IRC]] channel to communicate about which targets to select, after which "attack posters" were produced and posted on various [[imageboards]] (4chan/7chan/711chan/420chan/808chan).&lt;ref name="p2pnet"&gt;{{cite interview|subject=Anonymous |interviewer=Jon Newton |title=p2pnet talks with Operation Payback |url=http://www.p2pnet.net/story/45762 |type=Interview: Transcript |work=p2pnet.net |date=2010-11-18 |accessdate=2010-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Media such as [[Twitter]] and  [[Facebook]] were also been utilized for coordination,&lt;ref name="p2pnet"/&gt; but on December 8, 2010, Operation Payback's Facebook page was removed and its official Twitter account was suspended.&lt;ref name="visa"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-31921_3-20025075-281.html |title=Facebook, Twitter boot WikiLeaks supporters after Visa attack |first=Elinor |last=Mills |date=2010-12-08 |accessdate=2010-12-09 |publisher=Cnet |work=news.cnet.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.heise.de/tp/blogs/6/148908 |title=Facebook und Twitter gegen "Operation Payback" |first=Florian |last=Rötzer |date=2010-12-08 |accessdate=2010-12-08 |work=heise.de |language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://blogs.forbes.com/mikeisaac/2010/12/08/facebook-and-twitter-suspend-operation-payback-accounts/ |title=Facebook and Twitter Suspend Operation Payback Accounts |first=Mike |last=Isaac |date=2010-12-08 |accessdate=2010-12-09 |publisher=Forbes |work=blogs.forbes.com}}&lt;!-- Do not remove this source, it has the most complete information and its supported by primary sources --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally a federal court order forced [[Encyclopedia Dramatica]] to delete its Operation Payback article, which featured a detailed history of the operation, including personal information of some individuals associated with the companies attacked .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gawker.com/5709789/noose-closes-around-pro+wikileaks-vigilantes |title=Noose Closes Around Pro-WikiLeaks Vigilantes |first=Ryan |last=Tate |date=2010-12-09 |accessdate=2010-12-09 |work=gawker.com |publisher=[[Valleywag]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Anonymous keeps the cannons firing while pressure mounts |first=Steve |last=Ragan |url=http://www.thetechherald.com/article.php/201049/6530/Anonymous-keeps-the-cannons-firing-while-pressure-mounts?page=1 |newspaper=The Tech Herald |page=1 |date=2010-12-09 |accessdate=2010-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=WikiLeaks cables: Shell, Operation Payback and Assange for the Nobel prize - as it happened |first1=Matthew |last1=Weaver |first2=Mark |last2=Tran |url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/blog/2010/dec/09/wikileaks-us-embassy-cables-live-updates |newspaper=The Guardian |date=2010-12-09 |accessdate=2010-12-23 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Federal Indictment ==
In October of 2013, 13 members of Operation Payback were indicted in Federal court in [[Alexandria, Virginia]] as co-conspirators in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 731 and [[18 U.S.C. § 1030]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/173135553/Collins-Indictment|title=Collins_Indictment {{!}} Denial Of Service Attack {{!}} Wiki Leaks|website=Scribd|language=en|access-date=2018-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, some of the members received a plea deal, reducing their felony charges to a single misdemeanor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-anonymous-cybercrime-plea/anonymous-hackers-plead-guilty-to-minor-charge-in-u-s-for-cyberattacks-idUSKBN0GJ25720140819|title='Anonymous' hackers plead guilty to minor charge in U.S. for...|last=Viswanatha|first=Aruna|work=U.S.|access-date=2018-07-21|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{distinguish|pacifism}}
'''Pacificism''' is the general term for [[ethical]] opposition to [[violence]] or [[war]], except in cases where force is deemed absolutely necessary to advance the cause of [[peace]].

It falls between [[pacifism]], which usually states that killing, violence or war is unconditionally wrong in all cases, and [[defensivism]], which accepts all ''defensive'' wars and acts of deterrence as morally just.&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.www.westernherald.com/media/storage/paper881/news/2002/10/10/Opinion/Pacifism.Cannot.Hold.Up.Under.Scrutiny-2127363.shtml Western Herald - Pacifism cannot hold up under scrutiny] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080629055802/http://media.www.westernherald.com/media/storage/paper881/news/2002/10/10/Opinion/Pacifism.Cannot.Hold.Up.Under.Scrutiny-2127363.shtml |date=2008-06-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pacificism states that war can only ever be considered as a firm "last resort", condemning both [[aggression]] and [[militarism]]. In the 1940s, the two terms were not conceptually distinguished and pacificism was considered merely as an archaic spelling, although less 'barbarous' than the more common and shorter form.&lt;ref &gt;{{Cite magazine

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The distinct theory was first put forward by [[A. J. P. Taylor]] in ''The Trouble-Makers'' (1957)&lt;ref&gt;‘By ‘pacificism’ I mean the advocacy of a peaceful policy; by ‘pacifism’ (a word invented only in the twentieth century) the doctrine of non-resistance. The latter is the negation of policy, not an alternative, and therefore irrelevant to my theme. Hence my disregard for the Peace Societies.’  AJP Taylor, ''The Trouble-Makers'', London: H Hamilton, 1957, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; and was subsequently defined by Martin Ceadel in his 1987 book, ''Thinking About Peace and War''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/p/pacifism.htm#SH2c Pacifism - Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ppu.org.uk/learn/peaceed/pe_debate.html Pledge Peace Union - Debating Peace and War]&lt;/ref&gt; It was also discussed in detail in [[Richard Norman]]'s book: ''Ethics, Killing and War''.

The largest national peace association in history, the British [[League of Nations Union]], was pacificist rather than pacifist in orientation.&lt;ref&gt;Donald Birn, ''The League of Nations Union'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1981&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, the majority of peace activists have been pacificists rather than strict pacifists.&lt;ref&gt;Martin Ceadel, ''Semi Detached Idealists: The British Peace Movement and International Relations, 1854-1945'', Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Police Act 1996''' ([http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1996/16/contents c 16]) is an [[Act of Parliament|Act]] of the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] which defined the current [[police area]]s in England and Wales, constituted the current [[Police Authority|police authorities]] for those areas, and set out the relationship between the [[Home Secretary]] and the English and Welsh [[territorial police force]]s. It replaced the [[Police and Magistrates' Courts Act 1994]], which in turn had replaced the [[Police Act 1964]].

==Contents==
===Part I Organisation of Police Forces===
Sections 1 to 35 concern the national and regional organisation of the police force, with slightly differently applicable rules inside and outside [[London]].

===Part II Central Supervision, Direction and Facilities===
Sections 36 to 58 concern the functions of the Secretary of State in setting the Police force's objectives, handling budgets, and making more detailed regulations.

===Part III Police Representative Institutions===
Sections 59 to 64 concern the [[Police Federation of England and Wales]] and related rules. Section 64 contains the prohibition (in place since the [[Police Act 1919]]) on police becoming members of a [[Trade unions in the United Kingdom|trade union]] which can take [[strike action]], under the [[Trade Union and Labour Relations (Consolidation) Act 1992]]. The Police Federation was thought to be a substitute, given the potential for civil unrest that might develop if police stopped working to go on strike. This was thought to make the police exceptional, and as an alternative, a system of arbitration to resolve workplace disputes was instituted. The constitution of the Police Federation is set out in the amended [[Police Federation Regulations 1969]].&lt;ref&gt;Police Federation Regulations 1969 (SI 1969/1787)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Part IV Complaints, disciplinary proceedings etc.===
Sections 65 to 88 concern the rules of the [[Police Complaints Authority (United Kingdom)|Police Complaints Authority]], handling complaints made against the police, and procedures for disciplinary hearings and dismissal of officers.

===Part V Miscellaneous and General===
Section 89(1) creates the offence of [[assaulting a constable in the execution of his duty]]. On 13th September 2018, the [[Emergency Workers (Offences) Act 2018]] received Royal Assent&lt;ref&gt;https://services.parliament.uk/Bills/2017-19/assaultsonemergencyworkersoffences.html&lt;/ref&gt;. This added a subsection which states any common assault and/or battery on an emergency services worker is also now indictable and therefore subject to a maximum of 12 months if tried on indictment&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2018/23/section/1/enacted&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13335">'''Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers''' ('''PRSPs''') are documents required by the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) and [[World Bank]] before a country can be considered for [[debt relief]] within the [[Heavily Indebted Poor Countries]] (HIPC) initiative.&lt;ref name="IMF factsheet" /&gt;&lt;ref name=dijkstra /&gt; PRSPs are also required before low-income countries can receive aid from most major donors and lenders.&lt;ref name=dijkstra /&gt;  The IMF specifies that the PRSP should be formulated according to five core principles.&lt;ref name="IMF factsheet" /&gt; The PRSP should be country-driven, result-oriented, comprehensive, partnership-oriented, and based on a long-term perspective.&lt;ref name="IMF factsheet" /&gt; The PRS process encourages countries to develop a more poverty-focused government and to own their own strategies through developing the plan in close consultation with the population.&lt;ref name=Driscoll /&gt;&lt;ref name=lazarus /&gt; A comprehensive poverty analysis and wide-ranging participation are vital parts of the PRSP formulation process.&lt;ref name="sourcebook overview" /&gt;&lt;ref name=cbm /&gt; There are many challenges to PRS effectiveness, such as state capacity to carry out the established strategy. Criticism of PRSP include aid conditionality, donor influence, and poor fulfillment of the participatory aspect.&lt;ref name=dijkstra /&gt;

==Purpose==
The World Bank and IMF require countries to produce a Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper as a condition for debt relief through the HIPC initiative and other monetary aid, as do several bilateral donors.&lt;ref name=dijkstra /&gt; PRSPs are intended to help aid recipient countries meet the [[Millennium Development Goals]] (MDGs).&lt;ref name="IMF factsheet" /&gt;  They detail a country's plan to promote growth and reduce poverty through implementation of specific economic, social and structural policies over a period of three years or longer.&lt;ref name=craig&gt;{{cite journal|last=Craig|first=David|author2=Doug Porter|title=Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers: A New Convergence|journal=World Development|year=2003|volume=31|issue=1|pages=53–69|doi=10.1016/s0305-750x(02)00147-x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="IMF factsheet" /&gt;  PRSPs provide lending organizations, like the World Bank and the IMF, assurance that aid receiving countries will utilize aid to pursue development outcomes that have been elaborated in the PRSPs and approved by lenders.

==Goals==
The IMF has outlined five core principles for the process through which PRSPs are elaborated.&lt;ref name="IMF factsheet" /&gt;  First, it should be ''country-driven'', meaning that country ownership of the strategy should be culminated through broad-based participation of civil society.&lt;ref name="IMF factsheet" /&gt; It should also be ''result-oriented'' by focusing on outcomes that will benefit the poor, ''comprehensive'' in exploring and understanding the multidimensional nature of poverty, ''partnership-oriented'' by involving development partners such as the government, domestic stakeholders, and external donors.&lt;ref name="IMF factsheet" /&gt; Lastly, the development of the PRSP should be based on a ''long-term perspective'' geared towards reducing poverty.&lt;ref name="IMF factsheet"&gt;{{cite web|title=Factsheet -- Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers|url=http://www.imf.org/external/np/exr/facts/prsp.htm|publisher=IMF}}&lt;/ref&gt; These core principles are central to the goals of the PRS process. 

===Poverty-focused government===
One central goal is to create a more poverty-focused government. Previously, poverty reduction had been largely a marginalized concern within governments of [[developing countries]].&lt;ref name=Driscoll /&gt; Through the PRSP process, the issue of poverty has moved up in priority, creating more comprehensive plans addressing poverty specifically than ever before.&lt;ref name=Driscoll /&gt;  There has also been an increase in “pro-poor” spending within the health, education and transportation sectors.&lt;ref name=Driscoll /&gt;  Due to the demands from the donors to show results, there has been an increase in poverty monitoring through participatory poverty assessments and household surveys.&lt;ref name=Driscoll&gt;{{cite journal |last=Driscoll |first=Ruth |author2=Alison Evans |title=Second-Generation Poverty Reduction Strategies: New Opportunities and Emerging Issues|journal=Development Policy Review|year=2005|volume=23|issue=1|pages=5–25 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-7679.2005.00274.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Civil society involvement===
One major function of  the PRS is to encourage more participation from the population. The purpose of civil society involvement is to increase the influence of stakeholders in policy creation, program implementation, resource allocation and priority setting.&lt;ref name=lazarus /&gt;  The intent here to culminate a degree of national consensus, thereby creating a poverty reduction strategy that is more representative of stakeholder's interests.&lt;ref name=lazarus /&gt;  The idea behind this is that the PRS will then be owned by the population and will be sustainable, as it suits the needs and capacities of the country.&lt;ref name=lazarus&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lazarus|first=Joel|title=Participation in Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers: reviewing the past, assessing the present and predicting the future|journal=Third World Quarterly|year=2008|volume=29|issue=6|pages=1205–1221|doi=10.1080/01436590802201188}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Ownership===
Ownership of the PRS by the government and population is a very important goal of PRS.&lt;ref name=wine /&gt; It addresses the ineffectiveness of donor imposition of policy conditions from the outside, a common approach of lending organizations.&lt;ref name=dijkstra /&gt; One way the PRS process encourages ownership is by having governments create their own PRSPs in close consultation with the population.&lt;ref name=wine /&gt; This allows them to take ownership over, and thereby stick to, the strategies they and their population deem necessary to improve conditions in their counties.&lt;ref name=wine /&gt; Additionally, the hope is that in developing a PRSP together, a country will gain a more comprehensive understanding of the poverty issues it faces. The PRSP process is also meant to encourage government leadership in implementing their own strategies by allowing them to allocate the aid money themselves in accordance with the strategies they had drawn up in the PRSP. The emphasis on government leadership stems from the problems that arise when donors establish their own strategy implementation agencies within the client countries, bypassing state agencies and therefore undermining the development of state capacity as well as creating a dependency on aid organizations.&lt;ref name=dijkstra&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dijkstra|first=Geske|title=The PRSP Approach and the Illusion of Improved Aid Effectiveness: Lessons from Bolivia, Honduras and Nicaragua|journal=Development Policy Review|year=2011|volume=29|series=1|pages=111–133}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formulation process==
===Poverty analysis===
The PRSP process begins with an analysis of poverty within the country, taking into account both quantitative and qualitative data.&lt;ref name=cbm /&gt; This analysis becomes the basis for the poverty reduction strategy as it indicates the priority issues.&lt;ref name=cbm /&gt; It is important at this stage for the government to initiate civil participation, though to the degree with which this is done varies by country.&lt;ref name=cbm&gt;{{cite web|title=Making PRSP Inclusive|publisher=CBM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Participatory process===
One of the most important factors of the PRSP is the participatory process through which it is created.  It is vital to increasing country ownership of the PRS and promote accountability. The World Bank outlines the following participatory levels:

* Government participation, including ministries, parliament and sub-national governments  
* Stakeholder participation and involvement. This can include civil society groups, women’s groups, ethnic minorities, policy research institutes and academics, the private sector, trade unions and representatives from different regions of the country. 
* Participation of bilateral and multilateral external development partners
* Participation and consultation of the poor or their representatives&lt;ref name="sourcebook overview" /&gt; 

Participation has been facilitated by civil society organizations, mainly [[NGOs]]. However, since there is no clear framework for consultation with the masses, nor a clear definition of participation, many governments are able to conduct and organize it in whichever way they decide.&lt;ref name=rhetoric /&gt;  This often results in governments coordinating selective participation and employing other such tactics aimed at diluting public influence over government objectives. Governments have also been unclear on how much they should incorporate the opinions of the poor into their PRSP, especially while also trying to appease the donors.&lt;ref name=rhetoric /&gt; Furthermore, there is no clear criteria on which to judge whether or not the participatory aspect has been fulfilled in the PRSP.&lt;ref name=rhetoric /&gt; This means that the PRSP might be approved by the IMF and World Bank regardless of the lack of true civil society participation in its making.&lt;ref name=rhetoric /&gt; 

==Content==
According to the World Bank's PRS Sourcebook, a PRSP should contain a poverty analysis, a prioritization of the programs needed to achieve development objectives, targets and indicators, a plan for keeping track of progress towards goals and evaluating effectiveness of implementation of programs, and a description of the participatory process in preparing the strategy.&lt;ref name="sourcebook overview"&gt;{{cite web|last=Klugman|first=Jeni|title=PRSP Sourcebook: Overview|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTPRS1/Resources/383606-1205334112622/5301_overview.pdf|publisher=World Bank}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism and challenges==

Even with an approved PRSP, some countries have difficulty following through with intended policies and therefore do not reach the PRS outcomes. A large factor of this is the misallocation of budgetary funds that were intended to go towards the PRS. 

The PRSP process has been scrutinized for increasing aid conditionality even though it was supposedly created to undo the imposition of policy conditions from the outside by increasing country ownership.&lt;ref name=dijkstra /&gt; Some have argued that it is a "process conditionality" not a "content conditionality". This differentiation is important because it means donors are only monitoring if the country has made a PRSP and if it was made in a participitory way. However, this might still pose a problem. Since in the past donors were unable to impose content effectively in the client country's policies, it seems unlikely that donors would be able to impose process standards in making a PRSP.&lt;ref name=dijkstra /&gt; It has already been shown that donor's attempts to influence domestic politics have not been successful in the past.&lt;ref name=dijkstra /&gt; Furthermore, [[international financial institutions]] do in fact evaluate PRSP content, not process alone.&lt;ref name=wine&gt;{{cite journal|last=Seshamani|first=Venkatesh|title=The same old wine in the some old bottle? Content, process and donor conditionalities of the PRSP|date=March 2005|url=http://www.sarpn.org/documents/d0001178/P1307-Seshamani_PRSP_March_2005.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
 
A clear definition of what civil participation means has not been laid out by the IMF or World Bank.&lt;ref name=rhetoric&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kamruzzaman|first=Palash|title=Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers and the rhetoric of participation|journal=Development in Practice|date=February 2009|volume=19|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; This creates a problem when evaluating one of the key requirements of the PRSP, which is that it has to be formulated with civil participation. In fact, participation that involves the population working with the government to develop specific strategies to reduce poverty doesn't exist in any developing country. This seems to suggest that the WB and IMF approve PRSPs regardless of the fulfillment of this condition.&lt;ref name=rhetoric /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2816">'''Protocol No. 12 to the [[European Convention on Human Rights|Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms]]''' (ETS No. 177) is an anti-discrimination treaty of the [[Council of Europe]]. It was adopted on November 4, 2000, in Rome and entered into force on April 1, 2005, after tenth ratification. As of 2016, it has been ratified by 19 States &lt;ref&gt;http://www.coe.int/en/web/conventions/search-on-treaties/-/conventions/treaty/177/signatures?p_auth=0Kq9rtcm&lt;/ref&gt; (from 47 CoE member states).

==Core provisions==

&lt;blockquote&gt;'''Article 1 – General prohibition of discrimination'''. 1 The enjoyment of any right set forth by law shall be secured without discrimination on any ground such as sex, race, colour, language, religion, political or other opinion, national or social origin, association with a national minority, property, birth or other status. 2 No one shall be discriminated against by any public authority on any ground such as those mentioned in paragraph 1.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Unlike Article 14 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights|Convention]] itself, the prohibition of discrimination in Protocol 12 is not limited to enjoying only those rights provided by the Convention.

==Application==

The first case, where the [[European Court of Human Rights]] has found a violation of Article 1 of Protocol No. 12, was [[Sejdić and Finci v. Bosnia and Herzegovina]], adjudicated in 2009.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2637">{{Politics of Puerto Rico}}

A '''referendum on a [[Constitution of Puerto Rico|new constitution]]''' was held in [[Puerto Rico]] on 3 March 1952.&lt;ref name=N1&gt;[[Dieter Nohlen|Nohlen, D]] (2005) ''Elections in the Americas: A data handbook, Volume I'', p552 {{ISBN|9780199283576}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was approved by 81.9% of voters.&lt;ref&gt;Nohlen (2005), ''Elections in the Americas', p556&lt;/ref&gt; This was considered by many US and Puerto Rican politicians an affirmation of the new Constitution of the island as an ''Estado Libre Associado'', or Commonwealth, as proposed by legislation in 1950 by the US Congress after negotiation with its political leaders. Puerto Rican nationalists question the meaning of the referendum, complaining that the only alternative offered was direct US rule, and no choice of independence was offered. In 1980, the US Supreme Court adjudicated (''[[Harris v. Rosario]]'') that as a result of this referendum of 1952, the actual Territorial Status was not changed at all.

On November 1, 1950 two [[Puerto Rican Nationalist Party|Puerto Rican Nationalists]] had [[Truman assassination attempt|attempted assassination]] of the United States President [[Harry S. Truman]]. They claimed they were retaliating for US cooperation in repressing 1950 nationalist revolts on the island. Truman's stated motive for supporting for the [[plebiscite]] was that residents of the island could express their opinion of preferred status, but since independence was not offered, nationalists question Truman's stated motive. An overwhelming majority approved the commonwealth over the alternative of  return to direct US rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}'''''R v Généreux''''', [1992] 1 S.C.R. 259 is a leading [[Supreme Court of Canada]] decision where the Court held that the government had the constitutional right to create a military justice system that existed in parallel to the regular court system. However, the [[Supreme court|Supreme Court]] ruled that that system must comply with the constitutional requirements for [[judicial independence]] under [[Section Eleven of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 11(d)]] of the [[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]].

==Background==
Michel Généreux was a corporal in the [[Canadian Forces]]. He was charged with drug possession for the purpose of trafficking in violation of section 4 of the ''[[Narcotics Control Act]]'' and for desertion in violation of section 88(1) of the ''[[National Defence Act]]''.

In the General Court Martial he was convicted for both offences, which was upheld in the Court Martial Appeal Court.

The issue before the Supreme Court was whether the General Court Martial was an independent and impartial tribunal under section 11(d) of the ''Charter''.

==Opinion of the Court==
The Court examined the requirements for judicial independence established in ''[[Valente v. The Queen]]'' [1985]. It was found that the judges on the military court did not have sufficient security of tenure or administrative autonomy, which left them vulnerable to interference from the military and government. Consequently, the Court found that the accused's right to an independent and fair tribunal under section 11(d) of the Charter was violated.

==Aftermath==
The decision brought about many changes to the military courts. The government of Canada commissioned recently retired Chief Justice [[Brian Dickson]] to write a report to recommend changes to the courts which were eventually incorporated into the 1998 National Defence Act.

{{About||the personal right to exist|Right to life|the book|Right to Exist: a Moral Defense of Israel's Wars}}
 
[[File:Ernest Renan 1876-84.jpg|thumb|right|French historian [[Ernest Renan]] defended the right to exist in "[[What is a Nation?]]" (1882).]]

The '''right to exist''' is said to be an attribute of [[nation]]s. According to an [[What is a Nation?|essay]] by the nineteenth century French philosopher [[Ernest Renan]], a state has the right to exist when individuals are willing to sacrifice their own interests for the community it represents. Unlike [[self-determination]], the right to exist is an attribute of states rather than of peoples. It is not a right recognized in international law. The phrase has featured prominently in the [[Arab–Israeli conflict]] since the 1950s.

The right to exist of a ''de facto'' state may be balanced against another state's right to [[territorial integrity]].&lt;ref&gt;Lagerwall, Anne. "[http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/2/3/6/5/8/p236585_index.html The Paradoxical Protection of State's Territorial Integrity by the United Nations: Law versus Power?]", Paper presented at the annual meeting of the Law and Society Association, Hilton Bonaventure, Montreal, Quebec, Canada, May 27, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of the right to exist trace it back to the "right of existence", said to be a fundamental right of states recognized by writers on international law for hundreds of years.&lt;ref name="Oppenheim"&gt;Oppenheim, Lassa and Ronald Roxburgh, (2005) ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=vxJ1Jwmyw0EC&amp;pg=PA193&amp;dq=#PPA192,M1 International Law]'', p. 192–193.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical use==
[[Thomas Paine]] used the phrase "right to exist" to refer to forms of government, arguing that representative government has a right to exist, but that hereditary government does not.&lt;ref&gt;Paine, Thomas, "Dissertation on the First Principles of Government" (1795), ''The Life and Works of Thomas Paine,'' 5:221--25.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1823, Sir [[Walter Scott]] argued for the "right to exist in the Greek people".&lt;ref name="google249"&gt;Scott, Walter, "[https://books.google.com/books?id=nA9uAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA249&amp;dq= The Greek Revolution]", ''Edinburgh Annual Register of 1823'', p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt; (The Greeks were then revolting against Turkish rule.) According to Renan's "[[What is a Nation?]]" (1882), "So long as this moral
consciousness [called a nation] gives proof of its strength by the sacrifices which demand the abdication of the individual to
the advantage of the community, it is legitimate and has the right to exist. If doubts arise regarding its
frontiers, consult the populations in the areas under dispute."&lt;ref name="Renan"&gt;[[Ernest Renan|Renan, Ernest]], "[http://ig.cs.tu-berlin.de/oldstatic/w2001/eu1/dokumente/Basistexte/Renan1882EN-Nation.pdf What is a Nation?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130319081440/http://ig.cs.tu-berlin.de/oldstatic/w2001/eu1/dokumente/Basistexte/Renan1882EN-Nation.pdf |date=2013-03-19 }}", 1882.&lt;/ref&gt; Existence is not a historical right, but "a daily [[wikt:plebiscite|plebiscite]], just as an individual's existence is a perpetual affirmation of life," Renan said.&lt;ref name="Renan"/&gt; The phrase gained enormous usage in reference to the breakup of the [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1918. "If Turkey has a right to exist – and the Powers are very prompt to assert that she has – she possesses an equally good right to defend herself against all attempts to imperil her political existence," wrote Eliakim and Robert Littell in 1903.&lt;ref&gt;Littell, Eliakim and Robert S. Littell, "The Reign of Terror in Macedonia", ''The Living Age,'' April–June 1903, p. 68.&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases, a nation's right to exist is not questioned, and is therefore not asserted.

==Examples==
===[[Armenia]]===
The right to exist of Armenia became known as the [[Armenian Question]] during the [[Congress of Berlin]] in 1878, and would again be asked during the [[Armenian Genocide]] in [[World War I]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=John Riddell|title=To the Masses: Proceedings of the Third Congress of the Communist International, 1921|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PFLoBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=WnYtVcLYC8KENo7IgcAK&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|date=2014|publisher=Brill Academic|isbn= 978-90-04-28803-4|pages=28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===[[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque nation]]===
According to [[Basque people|Basque]] nationalists, "[[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Euzkadi]] (the name of our country in our own language) is the country of the Basques with as such right to exist independently as a nation as [[Poland]] or [[Ireland]]. The Basques are a very ancient people..."&lt;ref&gt;Nationalism, Naunihal Singh, Mittal Publications, 2006, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt;

===[[Chechnya]]===
The phrase, "right to exist" has also been used in reference to the right of [[Chechens]] (in the eyes of supporters) to establish a state independent from Russia.&lt;ref&gt;Wood, Tony. ''Chechnya, the Case for Independence''. Page 6. Quote: "The second basis for dismissing Chechnya's right to existence is that the country had its chance at independence from 1996 to 1999..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.watchdog.cz/?show=000000-000004-000003-000130&amp;lang=1 |title=Prague Watchdog - Crisis in Chechnya - An empire on the verge of collapse |publisher=Watchdog.cz |date= |accessdate=2012-01-21|quote=Russia’s numerous separatist movements quickly shrank to nothing, but they will once again return to life if their '''''right to exist''''', even if only in the distant future, is confirmed by the precedents of Abkhazia and South Ossetia. And here the example of Chechnya may prove to be formative.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===[[Israel]]===
{{further|Legitimacy of Israel|Jewish question}}
In 1947, a United Nations General Assembly resolution provided for the creation of an "Arab State" and a "Jewish State" to exist within [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] in the United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine. This has been described by Prof. Joseph Massad as "a non-binding proposal that was never ratified or adopted by the Security Council, and therefore never acquired legal standing, as UN regulations require."&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|title='The rights of Israel'|author= Prof. Joseph Massad |url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2011/05/20115684218533873.html |date= 6 May 2011 |accessdate= 12 Sep 2012| quote= "In international law, countries are recognised as existing de facto and de jure, but there is no notion that any country has a 'right to exist', let alone that other countries should recognise such a right. Nonetheless, the modification by Israel of its claim that others had to recognise its 'right to exist' to their having to recognise 'its right to exist as Jewish state' is pushed most forcefully at present, as it goes to the heart of the matter of what the Zionist project has been all about since its inception, and addresses itself to the extant discrepancy between Israel's own understanding of its rights to realise these Zionist aims and the international community's differing understanding of them. This is a crucial matter, as all these rights that Israel claims to possess, but which are not recognised internationally, translate into its rights to colonise Palestinian land, to occupy it, and to discriminate against the non-Jewish Palestinian people."}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Jewish Agency]], precursor to the Israeli government, agreed to the plan, but the Palestinians rejected it and fighting broke out. After Israel's May 14, 1948 unilateral declaration of independence, support from neighboring Arab states escalated the 1947–48 Civil War in [[Mandatory Palestine]] into the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. The legal and territorial status of [[Israel]] and [[State of Palestine|Palestine]] is still hotly disputed in the region and within the international community.

According to [[Ilan Pappé]], Arab recognition of Israel's right to exist was part of [[Folke Bernadotte]]'s 1948 peace plan.&lt;ref name=pappe&gt;Ilan Pappé, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=zAJZCKAwtPMC&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s The Making of the Arab-Israeli Conflict, 1947-1951]'', I.B.Tauris, 1994, p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt; The Arab states gave this as their reason to reject the plan.&lt;ref name=pappe/&gt; In the 1950s UK MP [[Herbert Morrison]] cited then Egyptian leader [[Abdel Nasser]] as saying "Israel is an artificial State which must disappear." .&lt;ref&gt;*"Foreign Affairs; A Time to Find a Solution for Palestine", ''New York Times'' Aug 2, 1958. "Most Arab leaders do not even dare admit Israel's right to exist. They fear assassination by fanatics."&lt;br/&gt;*''Parliamentary debates: Official report:'' Volume 547 (1956), Great Britain. Parliament. House of Commons: "I will give two short quotations, one from Colonel Nasser, the Prime Minister of Egypt, on 8th May, 1954. It is an extremist point of view based on the belief and the assertion that Israel has no right to exist at all."&lt;br/&gt;*"Arms and the Middle East", ''Toledo Blade'', Sep 30, 1955. "the Arabs still refuse to acknowledge Israel's right to exist."&lt;/ref&gt; The issue was described as the central one between Israel and the Arabs.&lt;ref&gt;"And underlying all of the questions dividing Israel and its Arab neighbors, one issue is central: Does Israel have a right to exist?" (Farrell, James Thomas, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=AnI9AAAAMAAJ&amp;q= It has come to pass]'', 1958)&lt;/ref&gt;

After the June 1967 war, Egyptian spokesman Mohammed H. el-Zayyat stated that Cairo had accepted Israel's right to exist since the signing of the [[1949 Armistice Agreements|Egyptian-Israeli armistice]] in 1949.&lt;ref name="Whetten"&gt;{{cite book |last=Whetten |first=Lawrence L.|title=The Canal War: Four-Power Conflict in the Middle East|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AY9tAAAAMAAJ&amp;q= |publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|year=1974|isbn=0-262-23069-0|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; He added that this did not imply [[Diplomatic recognition|recognition]] of Israel.&lt;ref name="Whetten"/&gt; In September, the Arab leaders adopted a hardline "three nos" position in the [[Khartoum Resolution]]: No peace with Israel, no recognition of Israel, and no negotiations with Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Khartoum Resolution|url=http://www.cfr.org/international-peace-and-security/khartoum-resolution/p14841?breadcrumb=%2Fpublication%2Fpublication_list%3Ftype%3Dessential_document%26page%3D69|publisher=[[Council on Foreign Relations]]|accessdate=7 June 2012|quote=The Khartoum Resolution passed by the Arab League in the wake of the 1967 war is famous for the "Three Nos" articulated in the third paragraph: No peace with Israel, no recognition of Israel, and no negotiations with Israel.|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120520124345/http://www.cfr.org/international-peace-and-security/khartoum-resolution/p14841?breadcrumb=%2Fpublication%2Fpublication_list%3Ftype%3Dessential_document%26page%3D69|archivedate=20 May 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; But in November, Egypt accepted [[UN Security Council Resolution 242]], which implied acceptance of Israel's right to exist. At the same time, President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] urged [[Yasser Arafat]] and other Palestinian leaders to reject the resolution. "You must be our irresponsible arm," he said.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander, Anne, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=CRbNAZFfggwC&amp;pg=PA150&amp;lpg=PA150&amp;dq= Nasser]'', p. 150. {{ISBN|1-904341-83-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; King Hussein of Jordan also acknowledged that Israel had a right to exist at this time.&lt;ref&gt;Dennon, Leon, "Key to Peace in Mideast", ''Owosso Argus-Press'', Nov 25, 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Syria rejected Resolution 242, saying that it, "refers to Israel's right to exist and it ignores the right of the [Palestinian] refugees to return to their homes."&lt;ref&gt;Lukacs, Yehuda, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=Mv8R-o_b0acC&amp;dq= Israel, Jordan, and the Peace Process]'', 1999. Syracuse University Press, pp. 98–99.&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon assuming the [[Prime Minister of Israel|premier]]ship in 1977, [[Menachem Begin]] spoke as follows:
Our right to exist—have you ever heard of such a thing?

As reported by the ''[[Financial Times]]'', in 1988 [[Yasser Arafat]] declared that the Palestinians had accepted Israel's right to exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/a6fc921c-3386-11d9-b6c3-00000e2511c8.html#axzz1TIo4nrB7 |title=After Arafat, a chance for change |publisher=FT.com |date=2004-11-11 |accessdate=2012-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, there was an official exchange of letters between Israeli Prime Minister [[Yitzhak Rabin]] and Chairman Arafat, in which Arafat declared that "the PLO affirms that those articles of the Palestinian Covenant which deny Israel's right to exist, and the provisions of the Covenant which are inconsistent with the commitments of this letter are now inoperative and no longer valid."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.adl.org/backgrounders/revision_of_plo_covenant.html#.WGSFAHpo-G8|title=You are being redirected...|website=archive.adl.org|access-date=2017-05-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170501153721/http://archive.adl.org/backgrounders/revision_of_plo_covenant.html#.WGSFAHpo-G8|archive-date=2017-05-01|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 Prime Minister [[Ehud Olmert]] demanded the [[Palestinian Authority]]'s acceptance of Israel's right to exist as a [[Jewish state]], which the Palestinian Authority rejected.&lt;ref name="Ronen, Gil, "&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/124218|title=Olmert to Demand PA Accept Israel as Jewish State|website=Israel National News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Knesset plenum gave initial approval in May 2009 to a bill criminalising the public denial of Israel's right to exist as a [[Jewish state]], with a penalty of up to a year in prison.&lt;ref name="haaretz.com"&gt;Shragai, Nadav, "[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1088712.html Knesset okays initial bill to outlaw denial of 'Jewish state']", ''Haaretz'', May 30, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the PA Ambassador to India, Adli Sadeq, wrote in the official PA daily: "They [Israelis] have a common mistake or misconception by which they fool themselves, assuming that Fatah accepts them and recognizes the right of their state to exist, and that it is Hamas alone that loathes them and does not recognize the right of this state to exist. They ignore the fact that this state, based on a fabricated [Zionist] enterprise, never had any shred of a right to exist."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Al-Hayat Al-Jadida, November 26, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  In a different part of the article the PA ambassador explained this explicitly: "There are no two Palestinians who disagree over the fact that Israel exists, and recognition of it is restating the obvious. But recognition of its right to exist is something else, different from recognition of its [physical] existence."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

In 2011 Palestinian President [[Mahmoud Abbas]] said in a speech to the Dutch Parliament that the Palestinian people recognise Israel's right to exist and they hope the Israeli government will respond by "recognizing the Palestinian state on the borders of the land occupied in 1967." 
&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Diplomacy-and-Politics/We-recognize-Israel-they-should-recognize-Palestine 'We recognize Israel, they should recognize Palestine']. ''[[JPost]]'', June 30, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

John V. Whitbeck argued that Israel's insistence on a right to exist forces Palestinians to provide a moral justification for their own suffering.&lt;ref name="Whitbeck"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2007/0202/p09s02-coop.html |title=What 'Israel's right to exist' means to Palestinians |last=Whitbeck |first=John V. |date=February 2, 2007 |publisher=The Christian Science Monitor|accessdate=2009-05-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Noam Chomsky]] has argued that no state has the right to exist, that the concept was invented in the 1970s, and that Israel's right to exist can not be accepted by the Palestinians.&lt;ref&gt;[https://chomsky.info/200506__/ On the Future of Democracy Noam Chomsky interviewed by John P. Titlow], Dragonfire, June, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

International law scholar [[Anthony Carty]] observed in 2013 that “the question whether Israel has a legal right to exist might appear to be one of the most emotively charged in the vocabulary of international law and politics. It evokes immediately the ‘exterminationist’ rhetoric of numerous Arab and Islamic politicians and ideologues, not least the [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad|present President of Iran]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Carty|first1=Anthony|journal=The Modern Law Review|date=January 2013|volume=76|issue=1|pages=158–177}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Novorossiya===
Supporters of an [[Novorossiya (confederation)|autonomous Novorossiya]] in eastern [[Ukraine]] equally argue for a Novorossiyan right to exist. Due to ongoing media controversy around the driving forces behind the [[2014 pro-Russian unrest in Ukraine|unrest in Ukraine]], however, the term carries significant weight. [[RT News]] reported in December 2014 that Soika, a self-professed 23-year old Slovak volunteer who had then been in [[Donbass]] for two months, told them: "Novorossiya has the right to exist. Although Europe declares the rights of peoples, it recognizes them in a selective manner."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rt.com/op-edge/211703-donbass-west-war-europe-clashes/ What brings prosperous Westerners to join E.

===North Korea===
In the context of [[South Korea]]'s and the [[United States]] non-recognition of the North Korean state and what the North views as a 'hostile policy' pursued by the US, the North's government frequently accuses the US of denying the 'right of existence' of North Korea. For instance, a 2017 Foreign Ministry statement declared, "The DPRK will redouble the efforts to increase its strength to safeguard the country’s sovereignty and right to existence." North Korea itself does not recognise the right of existence of the Republic of Korea in the south. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/technology/innovation/north-korea-threatens-to-reduce-us-to-ashes/news-story/d735f25866cc4b089fad03865908dc91|title=Just what is North Korea up to now?|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===[[State of Palestine]]===
{{see also||History of the State of Palestine|History of Palestine}}
The [[League of Nations]] formally awarded Britain a mandate over [[Mandatory Palestine]] in 1922, when Jews made up 11% of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ecf.org.il/issues/issue/1087|title=1922 Census of Palestine|first=ECF|last=Database|website=ecf.org.il}}&lt;/ref&gt; The land west of the Jordan River was under direct British administration until 1948, while the land east of the Jordan was a semi-autonomous region known as Transjordan Emirate, and gained independence in 1946. 
In 1936-39 there was a [[1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine|nationalist uprising]] by Palestinian Arabs against British colonial rule and [[Chronology of Aliyah in modern times|mass Jewish immigration into Palestine]].

In 1947, a [[United Nations]] General Assembly resolution provided for the creation of an "Arab State" and a "Jewish State" to exist within Palestine in the [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine]]. This has been described by Prof. [[Joseph Massad]] as "a non-binding proposal that was never ratified or adopted by the Security Council, and therefore never acquired legal standing, as UN regulations require."&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The [[Jewish Agency]], precursor to the Israeli government, agreed to the plan, but the Palestinians rejected this and fighting broke out. After Israel's May 14, 1948 unilateral [[Israeli declaration of independence|declaration of independence]], support from neighboring Arab states escalated the [[1947–48 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine]] into the [[1948 Arab-Israeli War]]. The legal and territorial status of Israel and Palestine is still hotly disputed in the region and within the international community.

In June 2009 [[Barack Obama]] said "Israelis must acknowledge that just as Israel's right to exist cannot be denied, neither can Palestine's."&lt;ref name="bbc- obama"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8083107.stm |title=Middle East &amp;#124; Obama on Israeli-Palestinian 'stalemate' |publisher=BBC News |date=2009-06-04 |accessdate=2012-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As reported by ''[[The New York Times]]'', in 1988 [[Yasser Arafat]] declared that the Palestinians accepted [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 242|United Nations Security Council Resolutions 242]] and [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 338|338]], which would guarantee ''"the right to exist in peace and security for all".''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=PAUL LEWIS |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/12/14/world/arafat-in-geneva-calls-on-israelis-to-join-in-talks.html?src=pm |title=ARAFAT, IN GENEVA, CALLS ON ISRAELIS TO JOIN IN TALKS |publisher=New York Times |date=1988-12-14 |accessdate=2012-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, there was an official exchange of letters between Israeli Prime Minister [[Yitzhak Rabin]] and Chairman Arafat, in which Arafat declared that "the PLO affirms that those articles of the Palestinian Covenant which deny Israel's right to exist, and the provisions of the Covenant which are inconsistent with the commitments of this letter are now inoperative and no longer valid."&lt;ref name="mfa.gov.il"/&gt;However, the actual wording of the revision only stated the provision would be removed at a future date; the non-recognition of Israel remains in the charter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iris.org.il/pncvote.htm|title=Peace Watch: PLO Charter Wasn't Changed|website=www.iris.org.il}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mfa.gov.il"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Peace%20Process/Guide%20to%20the%20Peace%20Process/Israel-PLO%20Recognition%20-%20Exchange%20of%20Letters%20betwe|title=Israel-PLO Recognition: Exchange of Letters between PM Rabin and Chairman Arafat|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 Prime Minister [[Ehud Olmert]] demanded the [[Palestinian Authority]]'s acceptance of Israel's right to exist as a [[Jewish state]], which the Palestinian Authority rejected.&lt;ref name="Ronen, Gil, "/&gt; The Knesset plenum gave initial approval in May 2009 to a bill criminalizing the public denial of Israel's right to exist as a [[Jewish state]], with a penalty of up to a year in prison.&lt;ref name="haaretz.com"/&gt;

In 2011, [[Palestinian Authority President]] [[Mahmoud Abbas]] said in a speech to the [[Dutch parliament]] in [[the Hague]] that the Palestinian people recognize Israel's right to exist and they hope the Israeli government will respond by "recognizing the Palestinian state on the borders of the [[Israeli-occupied territories|land occupied in 1967]]."

Israeli government ministers [[Naftali Bennett]] and [[Danny Danon]] have repeatedly rejected the [[Proposals for a Palestinian state|creation of a Palestinian state]], with Bennett stating "I will do everything in my power to make sure they never get a state."&lt;ref&gt;David Remnick (21 January 2013), [http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2013/01/21/130121fa_fact_remnick The settlers move to annex the West Bank—and Israeli politics.] ''[[The New Yorker]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4446604,00.html|title=Bennett: Palestinian state a mistake, will work against it|date=28 October 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bennett stated that "relinquishing control of the West Bank would expose Israel's home front to infiltration tunnels leading into the heartland of Israel," citing the case of Gaza as a scenario that could repeat itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Diplomacy-and-Politics/Bennett-If-Israel-leaves-West-Bank-well-have-terror-tunnels-leading-into-our-heartland-370222|title=Bennett: If Israel leaves West Bank, we'll have terror tunnels leading into our heartland|work=Jerusalem Post|date=6 August 2014|accessdate=2 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an August 2011 interview with Teymoor Nabili on Al Jazeera English, [[Danny Danon]] said "There is place only for one state on the land of Israel....

In 2011 Palestinian President [[Mahmoud Abbas]] said in a speech to the Dutch Parliament that the Palestinian people recognise Israel's right to exist and they hope the Israeli government will respond by "recognizing the Palestinian state on the borders of the land occupied in 1967." 
Abbas said he sought [[United Nations]] recognition of a Palestinian state only after the Israeli government refused "the terms of reference of the peace process and the cessation of [[Israeli settlements|settlement building]]" in the [[occupied territories]].&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt;

The '''Rivers and Harbors Appropriation Act of 1899''' is the oldest federal environmental law in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;March 3, 1899, Ch. 425, Sec. 9, 30 Stat. 1151. {{USC|33|407}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Act makes it a [[misdemeanor]] to discharge refuse matter of any kind into the [[navigable waters]], or tributaries thereof, of the United States without a permit; this specific provision is known as the [[Refuse Act]]. The Rivers and Harbors Act also makes it a [[misdemeanor]] to excavate, fill, or alter the course, condition, or capacity of any [[port]], [[harbor]], [[Channel (geography)|channel]], or other areas within the reach of the Act without a [[License|permit]].  The Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899 also made it illegal to dam navigable streams without a license (or permit) from Congress; this included for the purposes of hydroelectric generation, at a time when the electric utility industry was expanding rapidly.&lt;ref&gt;Charles K. McFarland, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/3145402 The Federal Government and Water Power, 1901-1913: A Legislative Study in the Nascence of Regulation], ''[[Land Economics]]'', pp 441-452 Vol. 42, No. 4, Nov., 1966 &lt;/ref&gt;

Although many activities covered by the Rivers and Harbors Act are regulated under the [[Clean Water Act]], the 1899 Act retains independent vitality. The Rivers and Harbors Act is administered by the [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]]. However, authority to administer Section 9 of the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1899, applying to bridges and causeways, in/over/on navigable waters of the U.S. (superseded by the General Bridge Act of 1946, as amended), was removed from the Corps of Engineers and redelgated to the U.S. Coast Guard under the provisions of the DOT Act of 1966.  The Corps owns &amp; operates many bridges and may not regulate themselves due to conflict of interest.

Congress passed an act of the same name in 1882, and overrode a veto by [[Chester A. Arthur|President Arthur]].

'''Sender Policy Framework''' ('''SPF''') is an [[email authentication]] method designed to detect forged sender addresses in emails, ([[email spoofing]]), a technique often used in [[phishing]] and [[email spam]]. 

SPF allows the receiver to check that an email claiming to come from a specific domain comes from an IP address authorized by that domain's administrators.'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.openspf.org/Introduction|title=Sender Policy Framework: Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt;''' The list of authorized sending hosts and IP addresses for a domain is published in the [[Domain Name System Security Extensions|DNS]] records for that domain.

Sender Policy Framework is defined in RFC 7208 dated April 2014 as a "proposed standard".&lt;ref&gt;[https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/rfc7208/ RFC7208 Status]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first public mention of the concept was in 2000 but went mostly unnoticed.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web |url=http://www.openspf.org/History/Pre-SPF |title=SPF: First Public Mention 2000 |accessdate=28 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; No mention was made of the concept again until a first attempt at an SPF-like specification was published in 2002 on the [[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]] "namedroppers" mailing list by Dana Valerie Reese (née Green), who was unaware of the 2000 mention of the idea. The very next day, [[Paul Vixie]] posted his own SPF-like specification on the same list. These posts ignited a lot of interest, and eventually led to the forming of the IETF Anti-Spam Research Group (ASRG) and their mailing list, where the SPF idea was debated among a subscriber base that seemed to grow exponentially day by day. Among the proposals submitted to the ASRG were "Reverse [[MX record|MX]]" (RMX) by Hadmut Danisch, and "Designated Mailer Protocol" (DMP) by Gordon Fecyk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.openspf.org/History/Pre-SPF |title=SPF: History/Pre-SPF |accessdate=16 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2003, [[Meng Weng Wong]] merged the RMX and DMP specifications&lt;ref&gt;For a comparison among RMX, DMP and SPF, see [http://old.openspf.org/dmpvsrmx.html RMX and DMP compared] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080425222937/http://old.openspf.org/dmpvsrmx.html |date=2008-04-25 }} on the historical openspf site.&lt;/ref&gt; and solicited suggestions from other programmers. Over the next six months, a large number of changes were made and a large community had started working on SPF.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.openspf.org/History/SPF-2003 |title=SPF: History/SPF-2003 |accessdate=16 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally SPF stood for ''Sender Permitted From'' and was sometimes also called SMTP+SPF, but its name was changed to ''Sender Policy Framework'' in February 2004.

In early 2004, the IETF created the [[MARID]] working group and tried to use SPF and Microsoft's CallerID proposal as the basis for what is now known as [[Sender ID]].

After the collapse of MARID, the SPF community returned to the original "classic" version of SPF.  In July 2005, this version of the specification was approved by the [[Internet Engineering Steering Group|IESG]] as an IETF ''experiment'', inviting the community to observe SPF during the two years following publication.  On April 28, 2006, the SPF [[Request for Comment|RFC]] was published as experimental RFC 4408.

In April 2014 [[IETF]] published SPF in RFC 7208 as a "proposed standard".

==Principles of operation==
{{Further2|[[Sender Rewriting Scheme]] (SRS)}}

The [[Simple Mail Transfer Protocol]] permits any computer to send email claiming to be from any source address. This is exploited by [[e-mail spam|spammers]] who often use forged '''[[Address munging|email addresses]]''',&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; making it more difficult to trace a message back to its source, and easy for spammers to hide their identity in order to avoid responsibility. It is also used in [[phishing]] techniques, where users can be duped into disclosing private information in response to an email purportedly sent by an organization such as a bank.

SPF allows the owner of an Internet domain to specify which computers are authorized to send mail with envelope-from addresses in that domain, using [[Domain Name System]] (DNS) records. Receivers verifying the SPF information in [[TXT record]]s may reject messages from unauthorized sources before receiving the body of the message.  Thus, the principles of operation are similar to those of DNS-based blackhole lists ([[DNSBL]]), except that SPF uses the authority delegation scheme of the Domain Name System.  Current practice requires the use of TXT records,&lt;ref name="rfc7208-txt"&gt;{{cite IETF |title=Sender Policy Framework (SPF) for Authorizing Use of Domains in Email, Version 1 |rfc=7208 |sectionname=DNS Resource Records |section=3.1 |author=Scott Kitterman |year=2014 |month=April |publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]] |accessdate=26 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; just as early implementations did.  For a while a new record type (SPF, type 99) was registered and made available in common DNS software. Use of TXT records for SPF was intended as a transitional mechanism at the time.  The experimental RFC, RFC 4408, section 3.1.1, suggested "an SPF-compliant domain name SHOULD have SPF records of both RR types".&lt;ref&gt;Wong, M., and W. Schlitt. RFC 4408. April 2006 &lt;http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4408&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  The proposed standard, RFC 7208, says "use of alternative DNS RR types was supported in SPF's experimental phase but has been discontinued".&lt;ref name="rfc7208-txt" /&gt;

The envelope-from address is transmitted at the beginning of the SMTP dialog. If the [[server (computing)|server]] rejects the domain, the unauthorized [[Client (computing)|client]] should receive a rejection message, and if that client was a relaying [[message transfer agent]] (MTA), a [[bounce message]] to the original envelope-from address may be generated. If the server accepts the domain, and subsequently also accepts the recipients and the body of the message, it should insert a Return-Path field in the message header in order to save the envelope-from address. While the address in the Return-Path often matches other originator addresses in the mail header such as the ''header-from'', this is not necessarily the case, and SPF does not prevent forgery of these other addresses such as ''sender'' header.

Spammers can send email with an SPF PASS result if they have an account in a domain with a sender policy, or abuse a compromised system in this domain. However, doing so makes the spammer easier to trace.

The main benefit of SPF is to the owners of email addresses that are forged in the Return-Path. They receive large numbers of unsolicited error messages and other auto-replies. If such receivers use SPF to specify their legitimate source IP addresses and indicate FAIL result for all other addresses, receivers checking SPF can reject forgeries, thus reducing or eliminating the amount of [[Backscatter (e-mail)|backscatter]].

SPF has potential advantages beyond helping identify unwanted mail. In particular, if a sender provides SPF information, then receivers can use SPF PASS results in combination with a white list to identify known reliable senders. Scenarios like compromised systems and shared sending mailers limit this use.

===Reasons to implement===
If a domain publishes an SPF record, spammers and phishers are less likely to forge emails pretending to be from that domain, because the forged emails are more likely to be caught in spam filters which check the SPF record. Therefore, an SPF-protected domain is less attractive to spammers and phishers. Because an SPF-protected domain is less attractive as a spoofed address, it is less likely to be blacklisted by spam filters and so ultimately the legitimate email from the domain is more likely to get through.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emailmanual.co.uk/index.php/2009/05/why-should-i-implement-a-spf-record-on-my-domain/ |title=Why should I implement a SPF record on my domain? |publisher=Email Manual |date=May 2009 |accessdate=2010-01-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100129195805/http://www.emailmanual.co.uk/index.php/2009/05/why-should-i-implement-a-spf-record-on-my-domain |archivedate=January 29, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===FAIL and forwarding===
SPF breaks [[Email forwarding#Server-based forwarding|plain message forwarding]]. When a domain publishes an SPF FAIL policy, legitimate messages sent to receivers forwarding their mail to third parties may be rejected and/or bounced if all of the following occur:
# The forwarder does not rewrite the [[Return-Path]], unlike mailing lists.
# The next hop does not whitelist the forwarder.
# This hop checks SPF.
This is a necessary and obvious feature of SPF – checks ''behind'' the "border" [[Mail transfer agent|MTA]] ([[MX record|MX]]) of the receiver cannot work directly.

Publishers of SPF FAIL policies must accept the risk of their legitimate emails being rejected or bounced. They should test (e.g., with a SOFTFAIL policy) until they are satisfied with the results. See below for a list of alternatives to plain message forwarding.

===HELO tests===
For an empty Return-Path as used in [[Bounce message|error messages]] and other auto-replies, an SPF check of the [[Simple Mail Transfer Protocol#SMTP transport example|HELO]] identity is mandatory.

With a bogus HELO identity the result NONE would not help, but for valid host names SPF also protects the HELO identity. This SPF feature was always supported as an option for receivers, and later SPF drafts including the final specification recommend to check the HELO always.

This allows receivers to white list sending mailers based on a HELO PASS, or to reject all mails after a HELO FAIL. It can also be used in [[reputation system]]s (any white or black list is a simple case of a reputation system).

==Implementation==
Compliance with SPF consists of three loosely related tasks:
* '''Publish a policy''': Domains and hosts identify the machines authorized to send email on their behalf.  They do this by adding additional records to their existing DNS information: every [[domain name]] or host that has an [[A record]] or [[MX record]] should have an SPF record specifying the policy if it is used either in an email address or as HELO/EHLO argument.  Hosts which do not send mail should have an SPF record published which indicate such ("v=spf1 -all").  It is highly recommended to validate the SPF record using record testing tools such as [http://www.openspf.net/Tools those provided on the SPF Project webpage].
* '''Check and use SPF information''': Receivers use ordinary DNS queries, which are typically cached to enhance performance.  Receivers then interpret the SPF information as specified and act upon the result.
* '''Revise mail forwarding''': Plain mail forwarding is not allowed by SPF. The alternatives are:
** Remailing (i.e., replacing the original sender with one belonging to the local domain)
** Refusing (i.e., answering &lt;code&gt;551 User not local; please try &lt;user@example.com&gt;&lt;/code&gt;)
** [[Whitelisting]] on the target server, so that it will not refuse a forwarded message
** [[Sender Rewriting Scheme]], a more complicated mechanism that handles routing non-delivery notifications to the original sender

Thus, the key issue in SPF is the specification for the new DNS information that domains set and receivers use. The records laid out below are in typical DNS syntax, for example:

 "v=spf1 ip4:192.0.2.0/24 ip4:198.51.100.123 a -all"

"v=" defines the version of SPF used. The following words provide ''mechanisms'' to use to determine if a domain is eligible to send mail. The "ip4" and "a" specify the systems permitted to send messages for the given domain.  The "-all" at the end specifies that, if the previous ''mechanisms'' did not match, the message should be rejected.

===Mechanisms===
Eight ''mechanisms'' are defined:
{|
| valign="top" | ALL || Matches always; used for a default result like &lt;tt&gt;-all&lt;/tt&gt; for all IPs not matched by prior mechanisms.
|-
| valign="top" | A || If the domain name has an address record (A or AAAA) that can be resolved to the sender's address, it will match.
|-
| valign="top" | IP4 || If the sender is in a given [[IPv4]] address range, match.
|-
| valign="top" | IP6 || If the sender is in a given [[IPv6]] address range, match.
|-
| valign="top" | MX || If the domain name has an [[MX record]] resolving to the sender's address, it will match (i.e. the mail comes from one of the domain's incoming mail servers).
|-
| valign="top" | PTR || If the domain name ([[PTR record]]) for the client's address is in the given domain and that domain name resolves to the client's address ([[forward-confirmed reverse DNS]]), match.  This mechanism is deprecated and should no longer be used.&lt;ref name="rfc7208-txt" /&gt;
|-
| valign="top" | EXISTS || If the given domain name resolves to any address, match (no matter the address it resolves to). This is rarely used. Along with the SPF macro language it offers more complex matches like [[DNSBL]]-queries.
|-
| valign="top" | INCLUDE || References the policy of another domain. If that domain's policy passes, this mechanism passes. However, if the included policy fails, processing continues. To fully delegate to another domain's policy, the ''redirect'' extension must be used.
|}

===Qualifiers===
Each ''mechanism'' can be combined with one of four ''qualifiers'':
* '''&lt;tt&gt;+&lt;/tt&gt;''' for a PASS result. This can be omitted; e.g., &lt;tt&gt;+mx&lt;/tt&gt; is the same as &lt;tt&gt;mx&lt;/tt&gt;.
* '''&lt;tt&gt;?&lt;/tt&gt;''' for a NEUTRAL result interpreted like NONE (no policy).
* '''&lt;tt&gt;~&lt;/tt&gt;''' (tilde) for SOFTFAIL, a debugging aid between NEUTRAL and FAIL. Typically, messages that return a SOFTFAIL are accepted but tagged.
* '''&lt;tt&gt;-&lt;/tt&gt;''' (minus) for FAIL, the mail should be rejected (see below).

===Modifiers===
The ''modifiers'' allow for future extensions to the framework. To date only the two ''modifiers'' defined in the RFC 4408 have been widely deployed:
*&lt;tt&gt;exp=some.example.com&lt;/tt&gt; gives the name of a domain with a [[Domain Name System|DNS]] TXT record (interpreted using SPF's macro language) to get an explanation for FAIL results—typically a [[Uniform Resource Locator|URL]] which is added to the SMTP error code. This feature is rarely used.
*&lt;tt&gt;redirect=some.example.com&lt;/tt&gt; can be used instead of the ALL-''mechanism'' to link to the policy record of another domain. This ''modifier'' is easier to understand than the somewhat similar INCLUDE-''mechanism''.

===Error handling===
As soon as SPF implementations detect syntax errors in a sender policy they '''must''' abort the evaluation with result PERMERROR. Skipping erroneous ''mechanisms'' cannot work as expected, therefore &lt;tt&gt;include:bad.example&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;redirect=bad.example&lt;/tt&gt; also cause a PERMERROR.

Another safeguard is the maximum of ten mechanisms querying DNS, i.e. any mechanism except from IP4, IP6, and ALL. Implementations can abort the evaluation with result TEMPERROR &lt;!-- Section 4.4 of rfc7208 --&gt; when it takes too long or a DNS query times out or they can continue pretending that the query returned no data &lt;!-- Section 5 of rfc7208, last paragraph --&gt; —which is called a "void lookup".  However, they '''must''' return PERMERROR if the policy directly or indirectly needs more than ten queries for ''mechanisms''.  In addition, they '''should''' &lt;!-- Sections 4.6.4 and 11.1 of rfc7208 --&gt; return PERMERROR as soon as more than two "void lookups" have been encountered.  Any &lt;tt&gt;redirect=&lt;/tt&gt; also counts towards this ''processing limits''.

A typical SPF HELO policy &lt;tt&gt;v=spf1 a mx ip4:192.0.2.0 -all&lt;/tt&gt; may execute four or more DNS queries: (1) TXT record (SPF type was obsoleted by RFC 7208), (2) A or AAAA for mechanism &lt;tt&gt;a&lt;/tt&gt;, (3) MX record and (4+) A or AAAA for each MX name, for mechanism &lt;tt&gt;mx&lt;/tt&gt;. Except the first one, all those queries count towards the limit of 10.  In addition if, for example, the sender has an IPv6 address, while its name and its two MX names have only IPv4 addresses, then the evaluation of the first two mechanisms already results in more than two void lookups and hence PERMERROR.  Note that mechanisms &lt;tt&gt;ip4&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;all&lt;/tt&gt; need no DNS lookup.

==Issues==
=== DNS SPF Records ===
In 2004, [[Steven M. Bellovin]] wrote an email discussing his concerns with SPF.&lt;ref name="Bellovin"&gt;[http://www.interesting-people.org/archives/interesting-people/200401/msg00037.html Steve Bellovin expresses doubts] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040413235149/http://www.interesting-people.org/archives/interesting-people/200401/msg00037.html |date=2004-04-13 }} (Jan 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; Issues included that SPF originally used TXT records in DNS, which are supposed to be free-form text with no semantics attached.  SPF proponents readily acknowledge that it would be better to have records specifically designated for SPF, but this choice was made to enable rapid implementation of SPF.  In July 2005, [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority|IANA]] assigned the Resource Record type 99 to SPF.  Later on,&lt;ref name="rfc7208-txt" /&gt; the use of SPF records was discontinued, and {{As of|2017|lc=on}}, it is still necessary to use TXT records.&lt;ref name="rfc7208-txt" /&gt;

The IETF spfbis working group, tasked with reworking the SPF specification aiming for "Proposed Standard" status in a new RFC, during April 2013 appeared to have reached consensus around deprecating SPF type 99 in favour of continued TXT record usage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite IETF |title=Resolution of the Sender Policy Framework (SPF) and Sender ID Experiments |rfc=6686 |sectionname=Conclusions |section=6 |author=Murray Kucherawy |year=2012 |month=July |publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]] |accessdate=16 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; People from the DNSEXT working group strongly opposed this in a series of email threads on spfbis, dnsext, and IETF general discussion mailing lists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ietf.org/mail-archive/web/dnsext/current/msg13025.html |title=Obsoleting SPF RRTYPE |author=S.

An independent draft was proposed later, documenting how the spurious recursion to TXT records is characterized in the current Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite IETF |title=An IANA Registry for Protocol Uses of Data with the DNS TXT RRTYPE |draft=draft-klensin-iana-txt-rr-registry |author1=John Klensin |author2=Andrew SUllivan |author3=Patrik Fältström |year=2013 |month=August |publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]] |accessdate=16 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
=== Header limitations ===
Bellovin's strongest concerns involve the underlying assumptions of SPF (its "semantic model").&lt;ref name="Bellovin" /&gt;  When using SPF, the SPF DNS records determine how a sender is allowed to send, meaning that the owner of the domain will control how senders are allowed to send. People who use "portable" email addresses (such as email addresses created by professional organizations) will be required to use the domain owner's SMTP sender, which may not even exist. Organizations providing these "portable" addresses could, however, create their own [[mail submission agent]]s (MSAs) (RFC 6409) or offer [[Virtual Private Network|VPNs]] or simply not publish an SPF record. Additionally, SPF only ties the [[Simple Mail Transfer Protocol|SMTP]] Return-Path to permitted MSAs; users are still free to use their RFC 5322 addresses elsewhere.

As SPF increasingly prevents [[Email spoofing|spammers from spoofing]] the envelope-from address, many have moved to utilising the header-from address as seen by the recipient user rather than processed by the recipient MTA. Propitiatory implementation beyond the scope of the SPF schema are required to protect against certain header-from spoofing implementations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Create an MIMECAST inbound lockout policy to STOP Email SPOOFING:|url=https://community.mimecast.com/groups/administrators/blog/2016/02/05/create-an-mimecast-inbound-lockout-policy-to-stop-email-spoofing|accessdate=25 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Prevent spoofed messages with spoofed senders detection|url=https://support.symantec.com/en_US/article.HOWTO119230.html|accessdate=25 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How antispoofing protection works in Office 365|url=https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/tzink/2016/02/23/how-antispoofing-protection-works-in-office-365/|accessdate=25 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Deployment==
Anti-spam software such as [[SpamAssassin]] version 3.0.0 and [[Anti-Spam SMTP Proxy|ASSP]] implement SPF. Many [[mail transfer agent]]s (MTAs) support SPF directly such as [[Courier Mail Server|Courier]], CommuniGate Pro, [[Wildcat! BBS|Wildcat]], MDaemon, and [[Microsoft Exchange Server|Microsoft Exchange]], or have patches or plug-ins available that support SPF, including [[Postfix (software)|Postfix]], [[Sendmail]], [[Exim]],  [[qmail]], and [[Qpsmtpd]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://github.com/qpsmtpd-dev/qpsmtpd-dev/blob/master/plugins/sender_permitted_from|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130629083752/https://github.com/qpsmtpd-dev/qpsmtpd-dev/blob/master/plugins/sender_permitted_from|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-06-29|title=Qpsmtpd SPF plugin|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2017, more than eight million domains publish SPF FAIL &lt;tt&gt;-all&lt;/tt&gt; policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spf-all.com/stats.html|title=SPF -all Domain Survey|year=2017|accessdate=2017-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a survey published in 2007, 5% of the &lt;tt&gt;.com&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;.net&lt;/tt&gt; domains had some kind of SPF policy. In 2009, a continuous survey run at Nokia Research reports that 51% of the tested domains specify an SPF policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://fit.nokia.com/lars/meter/spf.html|title=Nokia Research Report on SPF Adoption|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110920015908/https://fit.nokia.com/lars/meter/spf.html|website=Fit.Nokia.com|publisher=[[Nokia]]|date=2011-09-19|archivedate=2011-09-20|accessdate=2016-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; These results can include trivial policies like &lt;tt&gt;v=spf1 ?all&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/onlamp/2007/01/11/dns-extensions.html |title=Handicapping New DNS Extensions and Applications |first=Cricket |last=Liu |publisher=ONLamp |date=January 2007 |accessdate=2007-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{update-inline|date=March 2018}}

A '''social issue''' is a problem that influences a considerable number of  individuals within a society. It is often the consequence of factors extending beyond an individual's control, and is the source of a conflicting opinion on the grounds of what is perceived as a morally just [[personal life]] or [[society|societal order]].{{clarify|date=March 2017}} Social issues are distinguished from [[economic policy|economic issues]]; however, some issues (such as [[immigration]]) have both social and economic aspects. There are also issues that don't fall into either category, such as [[warfare]].

There can be disagreements about what social issues are worth solving, or which should take precedence. Different individuals and different societies have different perceptions.

In ''[[Rights of Man]] and Common Sense'', [[Thomas Paine]] addresses individual's duty to "allow the same [[rights]] to others as we allow ourselves". The failure to do so caused the birth of a social issue.

There are a variety of methods people use to combat social issues. Some people vote for leaders in a [[democracy]] to advance their ideals. Outside the political process, people donate or share their time, money, energy, or other resources. This often takes the form of [[volunteering]]. [[Nonprofit organization]]s are often formed for the sole purpose of solving a social issue. [[Community organizing]] involves gathering people together for a common purpose.

A distinct but related meaning of the term "social issue" (used particularly in the [[United States]]) refers to topics of national political interest, over which the public is deeply divided and which are the subject of intense partisan advocacy, debate, and [[voting]]. Examples include [[same-sex marriage]] and [[abortion]]. In this case "social issue" does not necessarily refer to an ill to be solved, but rather to a topic to be discussed.

==Versus personal issues==

'''Personal issues''' are those that individuals deal with themselves and within a small range of their peers and relationships.&lt;ref name="books.google"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UTQ6OkKwszoC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Sociological Imagination|first=C. Wright|last=Mills|date=13 April 2000|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=4 November 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, '''social issues''' involve [[Value (personal

The line between a personal issue and a public issue may be subjective and depends on how groups are defined. However, when a large enough sector of society is affected by an issue, it becomes a social issue. Returning to the unemployment issue, while one person losing their job is a personal and not a social issue, firing 13 million people is likely to generate a variety of social issues.

==Valence issues versus position issues==

A '''valence issue''' is a social problem that people uniformly interpret the same way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/valence-issue |title=valence issue: Definition from |publisher=Answers.com |date= |accessdate=8 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; These types of issues generally generate a widespread consensus and provoke little resistance from the public. An example of a valence issue would be child abuse, which is condemned across several societies to a large enough degree that some social scientists might speak of them as though they are universal, for the sake of illustration.&lt;ref name="books.google_a"&gt;{{Cite journal | url = https://books.google.com/?id=yKbzYelSkEYC&amp;pg=PA28&amp;lpg=PA28&amp;dq=valence+issues+and.+position+issues#v=onepage&amp;q=valence%20issues%20and.%20position%20issues&amp;f=false | title = Making an Issue of Child Abuse: Political Agenda Setting for Social Problems | isbn = 9780226572017 | author1 = Nelson | first1 = Barbara J | date = 15 April 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, a '''position issue''' is a social problem in which the popular opinion among society is divided.&lt;ref name="books.google_a" /&gt; Different people may hold different and strongly-held views, which are not easily changed. An example of a position issue is [[abortion]], which has not generated a widespread consensus from the public, in some countries.

==Types==
Here are some generic types of social issues, along with examples of each.

===Social stratification===
{{Further|Social stratification|Systems of social stratification}}

===Economic issues===
{{Further|Economic issues in the United States}}

[[Unemployment]] rates vary by region, [[gender]], educational attainment, and [[ethnic group]].

In most countries (including the [[Developed country|developed countries]]), many people are [[Poverty|poor]] and depend on [[welfare]]. In 2007 in [[Germany]], one in six children depended on welfare. That is up from only one in seventy-five in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/kinderreport2.html Report des Kinderhilfswerkes: Jedes sechste Kind lebt in Armut]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social disorganization===
{{Main|Social disorganization theory}}

So-called "problem neighbourhoods" exist in many countries. These neighbourhoods tend to have a high drop-out rate from secondary school, and children growing up in these neighbourhoods have a low probability of going to college compared to children who grow up in other neighbourhoods. Abuse of alcohol and drugs is common in these neighbourhoods. Often these neighbourhoods were founded out of best intentions.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Wolfgang Uchatius: "Armut in Deutschland - Die neue Unterschicht". Die Zeit. 10 March 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public health===
Widespread health conditions (often characterized as [[epidemic]]s or [[pandemic]]s) are of concern to society as a whole. They can harm quality of life and the ability of people to contribute to society and to work, and most problematically result in [[death]].

[[Infectious disease]]s are often public health concerns because they can spread quickly and easily, affecting large numbers of members. The [[World Health Organization]] has an acute interest in combatting infectious disease outbreaks by minimizing their geographic and numerical spread and treating the affected. Other conditions for which there is not yet a cure or even effective treatment, such as [[dementia]], can be viewed as public health concerns in the long run.

===Age and the life course===
{{Main|Agism}}

Throughout the life course, there are social problems associated with different ages. One such social problem is age discrimination. An example of age discrimination is when a particular person is not allowed to do something or is treated differently based on age.

===Social inequality===
{{Main|Social inequality}}

Social inequality is "the state or quality of being unequal".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/inequality |title=Inequality &amp;#124; Define Social Inequality at Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date= |accessdate=8 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inequality is the root of a number of social problems that occur when things such as gender, disability, race, and age may affect the way a person is treated. A past example of inequality as a social problem is [[slavery in the United States]]. Africans brought to America were often enslaved and mistreated, and did not share the same rights as the white population of America (for example, they were [[Disenfranchisement|not allowed to vote]]).

A number of [[civil rights]] movements have attempted to, and often succeeded at, advancing equality and extending rights to previously marginalized groups. These include the [[women's rights]] movement (beginning around the 1920s), the [[civil rights movement]] in the United States for [[African-American]] equality (beginning around the 1950s) and the [[LGBT rights]] movement (beginning around the 1960s).

===Education and public schools===
{{Main|Educational inequality}}

Education is arguably the most important factor in a person's success in society. As a result, social problems can be raised by the unequal distribution of funding between public schools, such as that seen in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Bruce J. Biddle and David C. Berliner |url=http://www.ascd.org/publications/educational-leadership/may02/vol59/num08/Unequal-School-Funding-in-the-United-States.aspx |title=Educational Leadership:Beyond Instructional Leadership:Unequal School Funding in the United States |publisher=Ascd.org |date= |accessdate=8 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The weak organizational policy in the place and the lack of communication between public schools and the federal government has begun to have major effects on the future generation. Public schools that do not receive high [[standardized test]] scores are not being funded sufficiently to actually reach the maximum level of education their students should be receiving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Scott |first=Dylan |url=http://www.governing.com/news/politics/gov-biggest-problem-for-public-education-lack-of-funding-poll-says.html |title=Biggest Problem for Public Education? Lack of Funding, Poll Says |publisher=Governing.com |date=23 August 2012 |accessdate=8 March 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130305071337/http://www.governing.com/news/politics/gov-biggest-problem-for-public-education-lack-of-funding-poll-says.html |archive-date=5 March 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Work and occupations===

Social problems in the workplace include [[occupational stress]], [[theft]], [[sexual harassment]], [[Inequality in the workplace|wage inequality]], [[gender inequality]], [[racial inequality]], [[Health equity#Ethnic and racial disparities|health care disparities]], and many more.

=== Environmental racism ===
{{Main|Environmental racism}}

Environmental racism exists when a particular place or town is subject to problematic environmental practices due to the racial and class components of that space.  In general, the place or town is representative of lower income and minority groups.  Often, there is more pollution, factories, dumping, etc. that produce environmental hazards and health risks which are not seen in more affluent cities.

=== Abortion ===
{{Main|Abortion debate}}
{{#section-h:Abortion debate}}

==By country==

==={{anchor|United States}}United States===
A number of social issues have taken prominence in the history of the United States. Many have waxed or waned over time as conditions and values have changed. The term "social issue" has a broad meaning in the United States, as it refers not only to ills to be solved but to any topic of widespread debate, involving deeply-held values and beliefs.

The Library of Congress has established an index of social causes in the United States. Examples include: academic [[cheating]], [[church-state separation]], [[hacker (computer security)|hacking]], [[evolution education]], [[gangs]], [[hate speech]], [[suicide]], [[urban sprawl]], and [[Trade union|unions]].&lt;ref&gt;http://catdir.loc.gov/catdir/toc/ecip0516/2005018778.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Social issues take a particularly high-profile when a new [[President of the United States|president]] is elected. Elections are often impacted by several social issues, and many social issues would be discussed during the debate, such as [[Abortion rights]], [[LGBT rights]] and [[gun control]] issues.

====Crime and the justice system====
{{further|United States incarceration rate}}
In the United States, the [[federal prison]] system has been unable to keep up with the [[United States incarceration rate|steady increase of inmates]] over the past few years, causing major overcrowding. In the year 2012, the overcrowding level was 41 percent above "rated capacity" and was the highest level since 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=14 September 2012 6:51 pm Updated: 15 September 2012 10:15 pm |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/14/prison-overcrowding-report_n_1883919.html |title=Overcrowding In Federal Prisons Harms Inmates, Guards: GAO Report |publisher=Huffingtonpost.com |date= 14 September 2012|accessdate=8 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The federal prison not only has overcrowding, but also has been the center of controversy in the U.S regarding the [[Human rights in the United States#Prison system|conditions in which the prisoners are treated]].

====Hate crimes====
{{Main|Hate crime}}

Hate crimes are a social problem in the United States because they directly marginalize and target specific groups of people or specific communities based on their identities. Hate crimes can be committed as the result of hate-motivated behavior, prejudice, and intolerance due to sexual orientation, gender expression, biological sex, ethnicity, race, religion, disability, or any other identity.&lt;ref&gt;National Crime Prevention Council&lt;/ref&gt; Hate crimes are a growing issue especially in school settings because of the young populations that exist. The majority of victims and perpetrators are teenagers and young adults, the population that exists within educational institutions. Hate crimes can result in physical or sexual assaults or harassment, verbal harassment, robbery, or even in death.&lt;ref&gt;Rape, Abuse, and Incest National Network (RAINN)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Advertising junk food to children====
{{Further|Psychological aspects of childhood obesity#Television and advertisements|Fast food advertising}}
The food industry has been criticized for promoting childhood obesity and ill-health by specifically targeting the child demographic in the marketing of unhealthy food products. The food products marketed often are deemed unhealthy due to their high calorie, high fat, and high sugar contents.&lt;ref&gt;Barnes, B. (2007). Limiting ads of junk food to children. The New York Times, 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some common methods of junk food advertising include:
*[[Television commercial]] campaigns that feature celebrities 
*[[Print media]] campaigns
*[[Billboard (advertising)|Billboard]] campaigns
*Event [[sponsor (commercial)|sponsor]]ship ([[sporting event]]s and others)
*[[Product placement]] in [[film]]s and [[television program]]s
*Various forms of [[brand]]ing, including clothing
*Direction signs and posters, telling people how far a fast food restaurant is

In 2005, the Institute of Medicine of the National Academies (IOM) released a report requested by Congress that evaluated the influence and nature of food and beverage marketing practices on American children and adolescents. "The report concluded that food and beverage marketing influences the diets and health of children and adolescents; current marketing practices create an environment that puts young people's health at risk; companies and marketers have underutilized their resources and creativity to market a healthful diet; industry leadership and sustained, multisectoral, and integrated efforts are required; and that current public policy institutions lacked the authority to address emerging marketing practices that influence young people's diets."&lt;ref name="Kraak, Vivica I. 2012"&gt;Kraak, Vivica I., Mary Story, and Ellen A. Wartella, "Government and School Progress to Promote a Healthful Diet to American Children and Adolescents: A Comprehensive Review of the Available Evidence." American Journal of Preventive Medicine 42:3, (Mar. 2012). 250-262.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Christian and the [http://ahealthieramerica.org/ PHA] website, the obesity epidemic in children and adolescents in the U.S. reflects changes in society: The article suggests unhealthy eating choices are due to an increase of sedentary activity (e.g., children watching too much television and playing computer games) and the influence of the media in causing children to eat unhealthy food choices.&lt;ref&gt;"Targeting the Obesity Epidemic in Children and adolescents:  Research Evidence for Practice."  Journal of Pediatric Nursing 26.5 (Oct. 2011), 503-506. Print&lt;/ref&gt;

In the view of some opponents, if governments took action to prevent the marketing of unhealthy food products, they would seriously reduce the prevalence of obesity and its serious health consequences, such as cardiovascular disease and diabetes. As part of the IOM [[food marketing]] report, 10 recommendations were made to both the public and private sectors.  One of the recommendations was that the government partner with the private sector to "create a long-term, multifaceted, and financially sustained social marketing program to support parents, caregivers, and families to promote a healthful diet."&lt;ref name="Kraak, Vivica I. 2012"/&gt; First lady Michelle Obama and [[Partnership for a Healthier America]] have proposed new rules that would limit junk food marketing in public schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dfw.cbslocal.com/2014/02/25/michelle-obama-proposes-ban-on-in-school-junk-food-marketing/|title=Michelle Obama Proposes Ban On In-School Junk Food Marketing|date=25 February 2014|website=cbslocal.com|accessdate=4 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Obesity====
{{Main|Obesity in the United States}}
Obesity is a prevalent social problem in today's society, with rates steadily increasing. According to the Weight Control Information Network, since the early 1960s, the prevalence of obesity among adults more than doubled, increasing from 13.4 to 35.7 percent in U.S. adults age 20 and older.&lt;ref name="Weight Control Information Network"&gt;{{cite web|title=Overweight and Obesity Statistics|url=http://win.niddk.nih.gov/statistics/index.htm|work=Weight Control Information Network|accessdate=4 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, today two in three adults are considered overweight or obese, and one in six children aged 6–19 are considered obese.

====Hunger====
{{main|Hunger in the United States}}
Hunger is a fairly obvious social Issue. Many people around the globe, especially in countries such as Burundi, Eritrea, Ethiopia, and Zambia, experience malnutrition and undernourishment.

====Media propaganda====
{{Further|Propaganda in the United States|News propaganda|propaganda model|Propaganda techniques}}
[[Mass media]] may use [[propaganda]] as a means to promote or publicize a particular political cause or point of view, or to maintain the viewer's attention. Who owns a media outlet often determines things such as the types of social problems that that outlet presents, how long that outlet airs those problems, and how dramatically that outlet presents those problems. The [[American media]] is often biased towards one or the other end of the [[political spectrum]]; that is, many media outlets have been accused either of being too [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] or of being too [[Liberalism in the United States|liberal]].

====Alcohol and other drugs====
{{main|Drug abuse in the United States}}
Drugs are at times the cause of social problems. Drugs such as [[cocaine]] and [[opiate]]s are addictive for some users. A minority of users of such drugs may commit crimes in order to obtain more drugs. In some individuals, drugs such as [[methamphetamine]] have been known to contribute to violent behavior, which would be considered a social problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/cocaine/cocaine.shtml |title=Cocaine | publisher=Erowid.org |date= |accessdate=25 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Drunk driving is on the rise and is the number two cause of accidental deaths; it is a cause of around 17,000 deaths each year.  All but 9 states in USA have adopted the Administrative License Revocation where if you are caught drinking and driving and found guilty you will lose your license for a full year.  This is a step that is being taken in order to try to avoid the occurrence of this social problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rd.com/advice/social-problems-in-american-society/ |title=Social Problems in American Society &amp;#124; Reader's Digest |publisher=Rd.com |date=15 January 2013 |accessdate=8 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Legal marijuana is debatable topic. Marijuana can be used in the medical domain, and there is no accurate fact that shows marijuana kills. However, people believe marijuana is a gateway to other drugs, injures lungs, and inhibits function. There are some states that are legalizing medical marijuana, such as New Mexico, Arizona, New York. Some states are also legalizing it for both medical and recreational purposes, such as Colorado, California, and Oregon.

===India===

==== Corruption ====
{{main|Corruption in India}}
India is ranked 76 out of a 179 countries in [[Transparency International]]'s [[Corruption Perceptions Index]], but its score has improved consistently from 2.7 in 2002 to 3.1 in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ibnlive.com/news/believe-it-or-not-india-is-becoming-less-corrupt/49402-2.html Believe it or not! India is becoming less corrupt]. CNN-IBN. 26 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[India]], corruption takes the form of [[bribes]], [[tax evasion]], [[Foreign exchange controls|exchange controls]], [[embezzlement]], etc. A 2005 study done by [[Transparency International]]{{Unreliable source?|date=May 2013}} (TI) India found that more than 50%{{dubious|date=May 2013}} had firsthand{{dubious|date=May 2013}} experience of paying bribe or peddling influence to get a job done in a public office.&lt;ref name="2005-TI-study"/&gt; The chief economic consequences of corruption are the loss to the [[exchequer]], an unhealthy climate for investment and an increase in the cost of government-subsidised services.

The TI India study estimates the monetary value of petty corruption in 11 basic services provided by the government, like education, healthcare, judiciary, police, etc., to be around Rs.21,068 [[crore]]s.&lt;ref name="2005-TI-study"&gt;Centre for Media Studies (2005), India Corruption Study 2005: To Improve Governance Volume – I: Key Highlights, Transparency International India.&lt;/ref&gt; India still ranks in the bottom quartile of developing nations in terms of the ease of doing business, and compared to China and other lower developed Asian nations, the average time taken to secure the clearances for a startup or to invoke bankruptcy is much greater.&lt;ref name="survey"&gt;{{Citation|title=Economic Survey 2004–2005|url=http://indiabudget.nic.in/es2004-05/esmain.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently a revelation of [[tax evasion]] ('''[[Panama Papers|Panama Papers' Leak]]''') case involving some high-profile celebrities and businessmen has added spark to the fumes of corruption charges against the elite of the country.

====Poverty====

==== Terrorism ====
{{main|Terrorism in India}}
&lt;!--This section is just copied from Terrorism in India.--&gt;The regions with long term terrorist activities today are [[Jammu and Kashmir]], [[Central India]] ([[Naxalite|Naxalism]]) and [[Seven Sister States]] (independence and autonomy movements). In the past, the [[Punjab insurgency]] led to militant activities in the Indian state of [[Punjab (India)|Punjab]] as well as the national capital [[Delhi]] (Delhi serial blasts, [[anti-Sikh riots]]). As of 2006, at least 232 of the country’s 608 districts were afflicted, at differing intensities, by various insurgent and terrorist movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/countries/india/index.html|title=India Assessment 2014|publisher=|accessdate=29 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===

==== Poverty ====
{{See also|Poverty in Germany}}

Unemployment rates vary by region, gender, educational attainment and ethnic group.

A growing number of Germans are poor and depend on welfare.{{Citation needed|reason=The following news "source" only refers to children.|date=January 2018}} In 2007 one in 6 children depended on welfare. That is up from only one in 75 in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/kinderreport2.html|title=Aktuelle Nachrichten - Inland Ausland Wirtschaft Kultur Sport - ARD Tagesschau|first=|last=tagesschau.de|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poverty rates seem to vary in different states, as in [[Bavaria]] only 3.9% suffer from poverty, while in [[Berlin]] 15.2% of the inhabitants are poor. Families that are headed by a single parent and working-class families with multiple children are most likely to be poor.

[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F008854-0004, Bremen-Vahr, Neubaugebiet.jpg|thumb|Housing project in Bremen-Vahr in the 1960s, back then most tenants living in housing-projects were two parent families with at least one parent working. In many housing projects the composition of tenants has changed since then and now many tenant-families are headed by a single female or an unemployed male]]
There is a discussion going on about hunger in Germany. Reverend Bernd Siggelkow, founder of the [[Berlin]]-based [[soup kitchen]] "Die Arche", claimed that a number of German children go hungry each day. He blamed the lack of jobs, low welfare payments, and parents who were drug-addicted or mentally ill.&lt;ref&gt;Bernd Siggelkow, Wolfgang Büscher: Deutschlands vergessene Kinder - Hoffnungsgeschichten aus der Arche. Gerth Medien&lt;/ref&gt; Siggelkow has been criticized by a number of people who said there was no hunger in Germany. [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] politician and board member of the [[Deutsche Bundesbank|German central bank]] [[Thilo Sarrazin]] said it was possible to live on welfare without going hungry if one did not buy fast food, but was able to cook from scratch. He was criticized by [[The Left (Germany)|The Left]] politician [[Heidi Knake-Werner]], who said it was not right "if well paid people like us make recommendations to poor people about how they should shop".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tagesspiegel.de/berlin/Landespolitik-Hartz-IV-Thilo-Sarrazin;art124,2474631|title=Sarrazin: So sollten Arbeitslose einkaufen|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Birth rate====

Germany has one of the lowest [[birth rate]]s in the world. In 2012, its national [[fertility rate]] was 1.41 children per woman,&lt;ref name="cia.gov"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/gm.html|title=The World Factbook — Central Intelligence Agency|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; up slightly from the 2002 rate (1.31), but still well below the replacement rate of 2.1 children per woman. (By contrast, the [[United States]] had a fertility rate of 2.06 in 2012).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/us.html|title=The World Factbook — Central Intelligence Agency|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, Germans are living longer, with a life expectancy of 80.19 years (77.93 years for men and 82.58 years for women) – 2012 estimates.&lt;ref name="cia.gov"/&gt; This demographic shift is already straining the country's social welfare structures and will produce further economic and social problems in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/article/0,1564,1561093,00.html|title=A Germany Without Children? - Germany - DW.COM - 27.04.2005|first=Deutsche Welle|last=(www.dw.com)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Mikrozensus]] done in 2008 revealed that the number of children a German women aged 40 to 75 had was closely linked to her educational achievement.&lt;ref&gt;Statistisches Bundesamt. Mikrozensus 2008. Neue Daten zur Kinderlosigkeit in Deutschland. p. 27ff&lt;/ref&gt;

====Deprived neighbourhoods====

So called problem neighbourhoods ("Problemviertel") exist in Germany. Those neighbourhoods have a high drop-out rate from secondary school and children growing up in a neighbourhood like this have only 1/7th the probability of going to college compared to a person growing up in another neighbourhood. Abuse of alcohol and drugs is common. Many people living in those neighborhoods are what is called ''a-people''. They are poor ("'''a'''rm"), out-of-work ("'''a'''rbeitslos") and immigrants ("'''A'''usländer").
Often those neighbourhoods were founded out of best intentions. Many districts that later became problem neighbourhoods were founded in the 1960s and 1970s when the State wanted to provide better housing for poorer persons. Big tenement buildings were built. The first tenants mostly were two-parent-families, not those one kind  with at least one parent working and many were happy with their neighbourhoods. But when the unemployment rate started climbing more and more people were losing their jobs. Also, families who could afford it started moving into better districts and only those who could not afford to move stayed in districts such as [[Hamburg]]-Mümmelmannsberg.:&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;)

==== Political extremism, racism and antisemitism====

Since World War II, Germany has experienced intermittent turmoil from various groups. In the 1970s radical leftist terrorist organisations like the [[Red Army Faction]] engaged in a string of assassinations and kidnappings against political and business figures. Germany has also continued to struggle with far-right violence or [[Neo Nazism|neo-Nazis]] which are presently on a rise, in line with the younger generation of Germans growing older.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw-world.de/dw/briefs/0,1574,1586388,00.html|title=Sharp Rise in Neo-Nazis in Germany - Germany - DW.COM - 17.05.2005|first=Deutsche Welle|last=(www.dw.com)|publisher=|access-date=1 September 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100910105810/http://www.dw-world.de/dw/briefs/0,1574,1586388,00.html|archive-date=10 September 2010|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is some debate as to whether indeed the [[hate crime]] is rising, or whether simply more arrests have been made due to increased law-enforcement efforts.  The number of officially recognized violent hate crimes has risen from 759 (2003) to 776 (2005). 
According to a recent study a majority Jews living in Germany are worried about a rise in antisemitism. The situation of Jews in Germany however was better than of those in France where 90% of those polled said that antisemitism has risen in the last years.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tagesschau.de/inland/antisemitismusstudie102.html&lt;/ref&gt;
Some have suggested that the increase in hate crime is related to the proliferation of right-wing parties, such as the [[National Democratic Party of Germany (NPD)|NPD]] (National Democratic Party) in local elections.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/569774.html](site down)&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===
France also has to deal with social issues.

====Precarity and poverty====
There is a certain fragility of income and social position in France. There are several ways to measure this. One possibility is to look at unemployment. Inside the European Union, in May 2017, France was ranked 6th country with its unemployment rate of 9.4 percent, according to [https://www.statista.com/statistics/268830/unemployment-rate-in-eu-countries/ Statista]. Moreover, according to Observatoire des inégalités, France has between 5 and 8.9 millions of poor people, depending on the definition of poverty (if the poverty line is at 50 percent of the median standard of living or if it's 60 percent).

====Gender inequality====
Women suffer from economical and social problems in France. Indeed, they are paid, on average, 16.7 percent less than men, according to [https://www.insee.fr/fr/statistiques/2128979 l'insee]. Women in France also have to handle sexual harassment, inequalities in education, and other problems.
That are some reasons why the [http://reports.weforum.org/global-gender-gap-report-2016/rankings/ Global Gender Gap report of 2016] has ranked France 17th with a score of 0.755, in which reaching 1 means gender equality.

==Other issues==
{{expand section|date=January 2013}}
Other issues include [[education]], lack of [[literacy]] and [[numeracy]], [[truancy|school truancy]], [[violence]] and [[bullying in schools]], [[religious intolerance]], [[immigration]], political and religious [[extremism]], [[discrimination]] of all sorts, the role of women, aging populations, gender issues, unplanned [[parenting|parenthood]], and [[teenage pregnancy]].

The '''St. Louis County Law Library''' in Missouri was established in 1941 as a public [[law library]] under Missouri Statute. [http://stlcountybar.org/about.htm] It is located on the sixth floor of the Courts building in the St. Louis County Courthouse at 105 South Central in [[Clayton, Missouri]].  

It operates as a public agency, independent of [[St. Louis County, Missouri|St. Louis County]] government.  It is funded from a portion of the surcharge paid by parties to [[civil lawsuit]]s in the 21st Judicial Circuit of the [[Missouri Circuit Courts]]. [http://ww5.stlouisco.com/circuitcourt/RulesofCourt/rule100.pdf]

==Collection==
The St. Louis County Law Library print collection is made up of many volumes including portions of the West National Reporter System, along with loose-leaf material, and a substantial portion of major treatises on a wide range of legal and ancillary disciplines. 
In addition, the St. Louis County Law Library also grants free access to  [[Westlaw]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5400">The laws and policies regarding [[stem cell research]] in the [[People's Republic of China]] are relatively relaxed in comparison to that of other nations. The reason for this is due to different traditional and cultural views in relation to that of the West.

==Laws and regulations==
China has one of the most unrestrictive embryonic stem cell research policies in the world. In recent years, seeing the research opportunities that China's lax regulations provide, many expatriate Chinese scientists from the West are returning to China to establish stem cell research centers and laboratories there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | title=China: Stem cells rise in the East | volume=419 | issue=6905 | last=Dennis | first=Carina | doi=10.1038/419334a | year=2002 | pages=334–6 | pmid=12353004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the increased interest in this field of research, in 2003, the [[People's Republic of China]] Ministry of Science and Technology and Ministry of Health issued official ethical guidelines for human embryonic stem cell research in its territories.  The guidelines strictly forbid any research aimed at human reproductive cloning and require that the embryos used for stem cell research come only from:
# Spared gamate or blastocyst after [[in vitro fertilization|''in vitro'' fertilization]] (IVF) procedures;
# Fetal cells from accidental spontaneous or voluntarily selected abortions;
# Blastocyst or parthenogenetic split blastocyst obtained by [[somatic cell nuclear transfer]] technology; or
# Germ cells voluntarily donated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.chinaphs.org/bioethics/regulations_&amp;_laws.htm#_Toc113106142 | title=Regulations &amp; Laws | date=18 March 2007 | accessdate=24 April 2009 | publisher=Bioethics Network in China}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American scientific journals ''Science'' and ''Nature'' have both reported in recent years that China's stem cell programs hold potential, and in 2004 a delegation from Britain's Department of Trade and Industry concluded more emphatically that Chinese research in the field was already world-class.&lt;ref name=nejm&gt;{{cite journal | journal=[[The New England Journal of Medicine]] | title=Bit Player or Powerhouse? China and Stem-Cell Research | last=Murray | first=Fiona | last2=Spar | first2=Debora | url=http://content.nejm.org/cgi/content/full/355/12/1191 | date=21 September 2006 | volume=355 | pmid=16990381 | doi=10.1056/NEJMp068151 | issue=12 | pages=1191–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Funding for stem cell research by the Chinese government is extremely limited compared to Western nations, with the Chinese Ministry of Science and Technology planning to devote between US$33 million and US$132 million on stem cell research during the next 5 years. By contrast, the state of [[California]] alone has earmarked US$3 billion to fund stem cell research at California institutions during the next decade. However, it is simply cheaper to produce goods in China than in nearly any other country, and in sophisticated sectors such as medical research, the cost advantage is likely to be retained for quite some time.

On January 10, 2012 it was announced that China will halt new applications for clinical trials of stem-cell products until July 1 as part of a year-long campaign to regulate the development of the industry. Deng Haihua, the [http://www.gov.cn/xwfb/2012-01/10/content_2040891.htm Ministry of Health's] spokesman, said "Trials that haven’t been approved should be stopped."

==Cultural views==
Perhaps more importantly, the cultural and national attitude on stem cell research differs greatly between China and the West.  Most Chinese citizens do not view the embryo as containing any inherent moral value.&lt;ref name=nejm/&gt;  According to the accepted [[Confucian]] view, a person begins with birth; a person is an entity that has a body or shape and psyche, and has rational, emotional and social-relational capacity for a lifetime of learning and innovation. Therefore, to the Chinese, a human embryo, lacking the characteristics of a person, cannot be equated morally to a person or a personal life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=http://www2.unescobkk.org/eubios/ABC4/abc4049.htm | chapter=Chinese Ethical Views on Embryo Stem (ES) Cell Research | author=Wang Yanguang | year=2003 | accessdate=24 April 2009 | title=Asian Bioethics in the 21st Century | editors=Song, Sang-yong; Koo, Young-Mo; Darryl R.J. Macer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stem cell research in China thus is unlikely ever to be prone to the intense moral politicking that characterizes the field in the West.  China's distinctive attitude toward the embryo, combined with its lax regulatory system, could help its researchers leap the gap between laboratory science and medical application in stem cell therapy developments.&lt;ref name=nejm/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="123993">{{Suicide sidebar}}
[[Suicide]] is a crime in some parts of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Ormerod (ed). Smith and Hogan's Criminal Law. 13 ed. OUP. 2011. p 583. (This source refers to England before the commencement of the Suicide Act 1961).&lt;/ref&gt; However, while suicide has been decriminalized in some western countries, the act is still [[stigmatized]] and discouraged. In other contexts, suicide could be utilized as an extreme expression of liberty, as is exemplified by its usage as an expression of devout dissent towards perceived tyranny or injustice which occurred occasionally in cultures like [[Ancient Rome]] or medieval [[Japan]].

While a person who has died by suicide is beyond the reach of the law, there can still be legal consequences in the cases of treatment of the corpse or the fate of the person's property or family members. The associated matters of [[assisted suicide|assisting a suicide]] and [[Suicide attempt|attempting suicide]] have also been dealt with by the laws of some jurisdictions. Some countries [[Suicide attempt#Criminalization of attempted suicide|criminalise suicide attempts]].

Historically, laws against suicide and [[mercy killing]] have developed from [[religious doctrine]], for example, the claim that only [[God]] has the right to determine when a person will die.

==History==
In [[Classical Athens|ancient Athens]], a person who had died by suicide (without the approval of the state) was denied the honours of a normal burial. The person would be buried alone, on the outskirts of the city, without a headstone or marker.&lt;ref&gt;[[Plato]]. ''Laws'', [http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/laws.9.ix.html Book IX]&lt;/ref&gt; A criminal ordinance issued by [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]] in 1670 was far more severe in its punishment: the dead person's body was drawn through the streets, face down, and then hung or thrown on a garbage heap. Additionally, all of the person's property was confiscated.&lt;ref&gt;[[Émile Durkheim|Durkheim, Émile]]  (1897). ''[[Suicide (book)|Suicide]]''. New York: The Free Press (reprint, 1997), 327. {{ISBN|0-684-83632-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '[[Burial of Suicide Act]]' of 1823 abolished the legal requirement in England of burying suicides at crossroads.&lt;ref&gt;Also called the Felo de se Act 1823, the Interments (felo de se) Act 1823, the Burials (Felo de se) Act 1823, and the Suicide Act 1823.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OyZOAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA105&amp;lpg=PA105&amp;dq=%224+Geo+4+c+52%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=yKv0HcBJjC&amp;sig=15o1kzUIZaJI6j-bSBskPpwV2ws&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAmoVChMIj-al5_msyAIVTL0UCh1DxwU5#v=onepage&amp;q=%224%20Geo%204%20c%2052%22&amp;f=false|title=A History of the Criminal Law of England|author=James Fitzjames Stephen|isbn=9781108060745|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even in modern times, legal penalties for the act of suicide have not been uncommon. By 1879, English law had begun to distinguish between suicide and [[homicide]], though suicide still resulted in forfeiture of estate. Also, the deceased were permitted daylight burial in 1882.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}

==Assisted suicide==
{{Main article|Assisted suicide}}
In many [[jurisdictions]] it is a crime to assist others, directly or indirectly, in taking their own lives. In some jurisdictions, it is also illegal to encourage them to do so. Sometimes an exception applies for physician assisted suicide (PAS), under strict conditions.

(a)   kills that person; or 
(b)   is party to the killing of that person by a third person, 
commits the offence of manslaughter and not murder.

(2)  If it is shown that a person charged with the murder of another killed the other or was a party to his being killed, it is for the defence to prove that 
the person charged was acting in pursuance of a suicide pact between him and the other.

(3)    For  the  purposes  of  this  section,  “suicide  pact”  means  a  common agreement between two or more persons having for its object the death of all of them, whether or not each is to take his own life, but nothing done by a person  who  enters  into  a  suicide  pact  is  to  be  treated  as  done  by  him  in pursuance of the pact unless it is done while he has the settled intention of dying in pursuance of the pact.

|(1)  A person (‘D’) commits an offence if– 
(a)   D does an act capable of encouraging or assisting the suicide or attempted suicide of another person; and 
(b)   D’s  act  was  intended  to  encourage  or  assist  suicide  or  an attempt at suicide.

(2)  The person referred to in subsection (1)(a) need not be a specific person (or class of persons) known to, or identified by, D.

(3)  D may commit an offence under this section whether or not a suicide, or an attempt at suicide, occurs.

(4)    A  person  who  commits  an  offence  under  this  section  is  liable  on conviction on indictment to imprisonment for 14 years.

(5)  If on the trial of an indictment for murder or manslaughter of a person it is  proved  that  the  deceased  person  committed  suicide,  and  the  defendant committed an offence under subsection (1) in relation to that suicide, the jury may find the defendant guilty of the offence under subsection (1).

(6)    If  D  arranges  for  a  person  (‘D2’)  to  do  an  act  that  is  capable  of encouraging or assisting the suicide or attempted suicide of another person and D2 does that act, D is to be treated for the purposes of this Part as having done it.

(7)  If  the  facts  are  such  that  an  act  is  not  capable  of  encouraging  or assisting suicide or attempted suicide, for the purposes of this section it is to be treated as so capable if the act would have been so capable had the facts been as D believed them to be at the time of the act; or had subsequent events happened in the manner D believed they would happen, or both.

(8)  A reference in this section to a person doing an act that is capable of encouraging  the  suicide  or  attempted  suicide  of  another  person  includes  a reference to his doing so by threatening another person or otherwise putting pressure on another person to commit or attempt suicide.

(9)  A reference in this section to an act includes a reference to a course of conduct, and a reference to doing an act is to be read accordingly.

(10)  No prosecution for an offence against this section may be commenced except by, or with the consent of, the Attorney General.

==Laws in individual jurisdictions==

===Australia===
In the [[Australia]]n state of [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], while suicide itself is no longer a crime, a survivor of a [[suicide pact]] can be charged with [[manslaughter]]. Also, it is a crime to counsel, [[incitement|incite]], or aid and abet another in attempting to suicide, and the law explicitly allows any person to use "such force as may reasonably be necessary" to prevent another from dying by suicide.

===Canada===
{{main article|Euthanasia in Canada}}
The common law crimes of attempting suicide and of assisting suicide were codified in Canada when Parliament enacted the [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]] in 1892.&lt;ref&gt;''Criminal Code,1892'', SC 1892, c 29, ss 237, 238.&lt;/ref&gt; Eighty years later, in 1972, Parliament repealed the offence of attempting suicide from the Criminal Code based on the argument that a legal deterrent was unnecessary.&lt;ref name=Carter2012/&gt; The prohibition on assisting suicide remained, as s 241 of the Criminal Code:

:Counselling or aiding suicide
:241. Every one who

::(a) counsels a person to [die by] suicide, or

::''(b) aids or abets a person to [die by] suicide'',

:whether suicide ensues or not, is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding fourteen years.&lt;ref&gt;''Criminal Code'', RSC 1985, c C-46, s 241, as amended by RSC 1985, c 27 (1st Supp), s 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the law against assisted suicide, including physician-assisted suicide, was the subject of much debate including two reports of the [[Law Commission of Canada|Law Reform Commission of Canada]] in 1982 and 1983, though these did not support changing the law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lareau-law.ca/LRCReport20.pdf Euthanasia, Aiding Suicide and Cessation of Treatment, Report # 20, 1983. Law Reform Commission of Canada]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, the offence of assisted suicide survived a constitutional challenge in the [[Supreme Court of Canada]], in the case of ''[[Rodriguez v. British Columbia (Attorney General)]]''.  The plaintiff, [[Sue Rodriguez]], had been diagnosed with [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis]] (ALS) in early 1991.  She wished to be able to die by suicide at a time of her own choosing, but would require assistance to do so, because her physical condition prevented her from doing so without assistance. By a 5-4 majority, the Court held that the prohibition on assisted suicide did not infringe [[Section 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|s 7 of the ''Canadian Charter of RIghts and Freedoms'']], which provides constitutional protection for liberty and security of the person.  The majority held that while the law did affect those rights, it did so in a manner consistent with the principles of fundamental justice.  The majority also held that the prohibition on assisted suicide did not infringe the Charter's prohibition against [[Section Twelve of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|cruel and unusual treatment or punishment]].  Assuming the prohibition did discriminate on basis of disability, the majority held that the infringement was a [[Section One of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|justifiable restriction]].&lt;ref name="thecanadianencyclopedia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/articles/suicide|title=The Canadian Encyclopedia|publisher=thecanadianencyclopedia.com|accessdate=17 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=OLAD/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/1054/index.do ''Rodriguez v. British Columbia (Attorney General)'', [1993&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; 3 SCR 519.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995 the [[Senate of Canada|Senate]] issued a report on assisted suicide entitled ''Of Life and Death''.&lt;ref name=OLAD&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parl.gc.ca/content/sen/committee/351/euth/rep/lad-tc-e.htm|title=Of Life and Death - Table of Contents|publisher=|accessdate=28 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 the [[Royal Society of Canada]] published its report on end-of-life decision-making.&lt;ref&gt;[https://rsc-src.ca/en/expert-panels/rsc-reports/end-life-decision-making Royal Society of Canada:End-of-Life Decision Making. 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; In the report it recommended that the Criminal Code be modified so as to permit assistance in dying under some circumstances.&lt;ref name=CarterSCC&gt;{{cite web|url=https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/14637/index.do|title=Carter v. Canada (Attorney General) - SCC Cases (Lexum)|publisher=|accessdate=28 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2012 a Select Committee on Dying with Dignity of the [[Quebec National Assembly]] produced a report recommending amendments to legislation to recognize medical aid in dying as being an appropriate component of end-of-life care.&lt;ref name=CBCJune214&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/montreal/quebec-passes-landmark-end-of-life-care-bill-1.2665834|title=Quebec passes landmark end-of-life-care bill|date=5 June 2014|publisher=|accessdate=28 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; That report resulted in ''An Act respecting end-of-life care'', which is set to come into force on December 10, 2015.&lt;ref name=CarterSCC/&gt;&lt;ref name=CBCJune214/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.publicationsduquebec.gouv.qc.ca/dynamicSearch/telecharge.php?type=5&amp;file=2014C2A.PDF ''An Act respecting end-of-life care'', SQ 2014, c 2, s 78];  [http://www2.publicationsduquebec.gouv.qc.ca/dynamicSearch/telecharge.php?type=2&amp;file=/S_32_0001/S32_0001_A.html CQLR, c. S-32.0001].&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 15, 2012, in ''[[Carter v Canada (AG)]]'', the [[British Columbia Supreme Court]] ruled that the criminal offence prohibiting physician assistance of suicide was unconstitutional on the grounds that denying people access to assisted suicide in hard cases was contrary to the [[Charter of Rights and Freedoms]] guarantee of equality under Section 15.&lt;ref name=Carter2012&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canlii.org/en/bc/bcsc/doc/2012/2012bcsc886/2012bcsc886.html|title=CanLII - 2012 BCSC 886 (CanLII)|publisher=|accessdate=28 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cbc"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/story/2012/06/15/bc-assisted-suicide-ruling.html|title=Assisted-suicide ban struck down by B.C. court - British Columbia - CBC News|publisher=cbc.ca|accessdate=17 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This decision was subsequently overturned by the majority of the [[British Columbia Court of Appeal]] (2:1) on the basis that the issue had already been decided by the Supreme Court of Canada in the Rodriguez case, invoking ''[[stare decisis]]''.

A landmark [[Supreme Court of Canada]] decision on February 6, 2015&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/supreme-court-says-yes-to-doctor-assisted-suicide-in-specific-cases-1.2947487 |title=Supreme Court says yes to doctor-assisted suicide in specific cases |last=Payton |first=Laura |date=February 6, 2015 |website=CBC News |publisher=CBC/Radio Canada |access-date=January 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; overturned the 1993 Rodriguez decision that had ruled against this method of dying. The unanimous decision 
in the further appeal of [[Carter v Canada (AG)]], stated that a total prohibition of physician-assisted death is unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/14637/index.do |title=Supreme Court Judgments  |author=no by-line.--&gt; |date=February 6, 2015 |website=Supreme Court of Canada |publisher=SCC/CSC |access-date=January 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The court’s ruling limits exculpation of physicians engaging physician-assisted death to hard cases of “a competent adult person who clearly consents to the termination of life and has a grievous and irremediable medical condition, including an illness, disease or disability, that causes enduring suffering that is intolerable to the individual in the circumstances of his or her condition.” The ruling was suspended for 12 months to allow the Canadian parliament to draft a new, constitutional law to replace the existing one.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/supreme-court-rules-on-doctor-assisted-suicide/article22828437/ Supreme Court rules Canadians have right to doctor-assisted suicide] Sean Fine, Globe and Mail 6 Feb. 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Specifically the Supreme Court held that the current legislation was overbroad in that it prohibits "physician‑assisted death for a competent adult person who (1) clearly consents to the termination of life and (2) has a grievous and irremediable medical condition (including an illness, disease or disability) that causes enduring suffering that is intolerable to the individual in the circumstances of his or her condition." The court decision includes a requirement that there must be stringent limits that are “scrupulously monitored.” This will require the death certificate to be completed  by an independent medical examiner, not the treating physician, to ensure the accuracy of reporting the cause of death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |authors=Guichon, Alakija, Doig, Mitchell and Thibeault |date=December 28, 2015 |title=Assisted dying: Four problems, one simple solution |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-debate/assisted-dying-four-problems-one-simple-solution/article27924838/ |newspaper=Glove and Mail |location=Toronto, Canada |access-date=January 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The newly (November 2015) elected federal government subsequently requested a six-month extension for implementation; the arguments for this request were scheduled to be heard by the Supreme Court in January 2016.&lt;ref name="The Canadian Press"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ctvnews.ca/health/canadian-doctors-express-mixed-opinions-on-assisted-dying-1.2715008 |title=Canadian doctors express mixed opinions on assisted dying |author=The Canadian Press |date=December 27, 2015 |website=CTV News |publisher=Bell Media |access-date=January 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Canadian Medical Association (CMA) reported that not all doctors would be willing to help a patient die. The belief in late 2015 was that no physician would be forced to do so. The CMA was already offering educational sessions to members as to the process that would be used after the legislation had been implemented.&lt;ref name="The Canadian Press"/&gt;

===India===
The [[Section 309 of the Indian Penal Code|Indian penal code 309]] deals with punishment for attempted suicide. The [[Mental Health Care Act, 2017|Mental Health Care Act 2017]] greatly limits the scope for the code to be implemented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Rhythma|last= Kaul|url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/mental-healthcare-bill-that-decriminalises-suicide-attempt-passed-by-parliament/story-iL3DXiatxP7BFhS2t4zGCM.html|title=Mental Healthcare Bill decriminalising suicide attempt passed by Parliament|newspaper=Hindustan Times|date=27 March 2017|accessdate=28 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill states, “Any person who attempts to [die by] suicide shall be presumed, unless proved otherwise, to have severe stress and shall not be tried and punished under the said Code”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prsindia.org/uploads/media/Mental%20Health/Mental%20Healthcare%20Act,%202017.pdf |title=The Mental Health Care Act, 2017 |publisher=Government of India |accessdate=28 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; State governments are required to provide adequate care and rehabilitation for such individuals as to prevent a recurrence of an attempt to suicide.

===Iran===
The act of suicide has not been criminalized in the [[Judicial system of Iran|penal law of the Islamic Republic of Iran]].&lt;ref name="firoozmand56"&gt;{{cite web | title=Freewill termination: A look into psychological and legislative aspects of suicide in Iran | website=magiran.com | url=http://www.magiran.com/view.asp?Type=pdf&amp;ID=1017038 | language=fa | access-date=2016-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, no one is allowed to ask another to kill him/her.&lt;ref name="firoozmand56"/&gt; In addition, threatening to kill oneself is not an offense by the law, however if this act of threatening is done by a prisoner in a [[prison]], then that would be considered as violation of the prisons' regulations and the offender may be punished according to penal law.&lt;ref name="firoozmand56"/&gt;

According to the Act. 836 of the [[Judicial system of Iran|civil law of the Islamic Republic of Iran]] if a [[suicidal person]] prepares for suicide and writes a [[Will and testament|testament]], if he/she dies, then by law the will is considered void and if he/she doesn't die, then the will is officially accepted and can be carried out.&lt;ref name="tabnak"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tabnak.ir/fa/news/530947/نگاهی-به-خودکشی-از-زاویه-قانونی | title=Suicide from the point of view of law | publisher=[[Mohsen Rezaee|Tabnak News Agency]] | date=September 12, 2015 | access-date=June 5, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the theory of "borrowed crime", because suicide itself is not a crime in penal law, thus any type of assisting in an individual's suicide is not considered a crime and the assistant is not punished.&lt;ref name="ettelaat"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ettelaat.com/etiran/?p=35136 | title=Suicide in law and fiqh | publisher=[[Ettela'at]] | date= December 29, 2013 | access-date=June 5, 2016 | author=Amir Sharifi Khezarati}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Assisted suicide|Assisting in suicide]] is considered a crime only when it becomes the "'''cause'''" of the suicidal person's death; for example when someone takes advantage of someone else's unawareness or simplicity and convince him/her to kill him/herself. In such cases assisting in suicide is treated as [[murder]] and the offender is punished accordingly.&lt;ref name="firoozmand56"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ettelaat"/&gt; In addition, assisting in suicide is considered a crime under section 2 of the Act. 15 of [[Judicial system of Iran|the cyber crimes law of the Islamic Republic of Iran]] which was legislated on June 15, 2009. According to the mentioned act, any type of encouragement, stimulation, invitation, simplification of access to lethal substances and/or methods and teaching of suicide with the help of [[computer]] or any other media network is considered assisting in suicide and thus, is punished by imprisonment from 91 days up to 1 year or fines from 5 to 20 million [[Iranian Rials]] or both.&lt;ref name="firoozmand56"/&gt;

===Ireland===
Attempted suicide is not a criminal offence in Ireland and, under Irish law, self-harm is not generally seen as a form of attempted suicide. It was decriminalised in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1993/en/act/pub/0011/index.html |title=Criminal Law (Suicide) Act, 1993 |publisher=Irishstatutebook.ie |date=1993-06-09 |accessdate=2014-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Assisted suicide and [[euthanasia]] are, illegal. This is currently being challenged at the High Court, as of December 2012. As of 2014 assisted suicide remains illegal in Ireland.

===Malaysia===
Under section 309 of the [[Penal Code (Malaysia)|Penal Code of Malaysia]], whoever attempts to die by suicide, and does any act
towards the commission of such offence, shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to one year or with fine
or with both.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Act 574 Penal Code|url=http://www.agc.gov.my/Akta/Vol.%2012/Act%20574.pdf|website=Attorney General's Chambers Website|accessdate=3 July 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150226041337/http://www.agc.gov.my/Akta/Vol.%2012/Act%20574.pdf|archivedate=26 February 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Netherlands===
In the [[Netherlands]], being present and giving moral support during someone's suicide is not a crime; neither is supplying general information on suicide techniques. However, it is a crime to participate in the preparation for or execution of a suicide, including supplying lethal means or instruction in their use. ([[Physician-assisted suicide]] may be an exception. See [[Euthanasia in the Netherlands]].)

===New Zealand===
As with many other western societies, [[New Zealand]] currently has no laws against suicide in itself, as a personal and unassisted act. However, as with comparable societies, there are still legislative sanctions against 'assisting or abetting' the suicides of others, under Section 179 of the Crimes Act 1961. (For further details, see [[Euthanasia in New Zealand]].)

===Norway===
Suicide or attempted suicide is not illegal in Norway. However, [[complicity]] is.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.regjeringen.no/nb/dep/jd/dok/regpubl/otprp/2008-2009/otprp-nr-22-2008-2009-/6/5/1.html?id=540447 Justis- og politidepartementet: Ot.prp. nr. 22 (2008-2009) Om lov om endringer i straffeloven 20. mai 2005 nr. 28]. Chapter 6.5.1, page 183.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Romania===
Suicide itself is not illegal in Romania, however encouraging or facilitating the suicide of another person is a criminal offense and is punishable by up to 7, 10 or 20 years in prison, depending on circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.just.ro/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=Wpo7d56II/Q= | title=Penal Code of Romania, art. 191 | accessdate=5 February 2015 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150308121055/http://www.just.ro/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=Wpo7d56II%2FQ%3D | archivedate=8 March 2015 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russian Federation===
In Russia, a person whose [[mental disorder]] “poses a direct (imminent?) danger to themselves”{{Verify source|date=November 2012}} can be [[Involuntary commitment|put into a psychiatric hospital]].

Inciting someone to suicide by threats, cruel treatment, or systematic humiliation is punishable by up to 5&amp;nbsp;years in prison. (Article 110 of the [[Criminal Code of the Russian Federation]])

[[Federal law of Russian Federation no. 139-FZ of 2012-07-28]] prescribes censorship of information about methods of suicide on the Internet. According to a website created by the [[Pirate Party of Russia]], some pages with suicide jokes have been [[Russian Internet blacklist|blacklisted]], which may have led to blocking of an IP address of [[Wikia]].&lt;ref name="rublacklist"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rublacklist.net/|title=RUBLACKLIST.NET &amp;#124; РОСКОМСВОБОДА|publisher=rublacklist.net|accessdate=17 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

===Singapore===
In [[Penal Code (Singapore)|Singapore]], a person who attempts to die by suicide can be imprisoned for up to one year.&lt;ref&gt;Singapore Penal Code (Cap 224, Rev Ed 2008), s 309&lt;/ref&gt;

However, this law is rarely enforced.

===South Africa===
South African courts, including the [[Appellate Division (South Africa)|Appellate Division]], have ruled that suicide and attempted suicide are not crimes under the [[Roman-Dutch law]], or that if they ever were crimes, they have been abrogated by disuse. Attempted suicide was from 1886 to 1968 a crime in the [[Transkei]] under the Transkeian Territories Penal Code.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Milton |first=John |title=South African Criminal Law and Procedure: Common-law crimes |year=1996 |publisher=Juta |location=Cape Town |edition=3rd |isbn=978-0-7021-3773-0 |pages=353–354}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===

====England and Wales====
{{See also|Felo de se}}
Laws against suicide (and attempted suicide) prevailed in English [[common law]] until 1961. English law perceived suicide as an immoral, criminal offence against God and also against the Crown.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Constitutional Aspects of Physician-Assisted Suicide After Lee v. Oregon|author=SM Canick|publisher=Am. JL &amp; Med.|year=1997|url=http://heinonlinebackup.com/hol-cgi-bin/get_pdf.cgi?handle=hein.journals/amlmed23&amp;section=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; It first became illegal in the 13th century. Until 1822, in fact, the possessions of somebody who died by suicide could even be forfeited to the Crown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Holt |first=Gerry |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-14374296 |title=BBC News - When suicide was illegal |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2011-08-03 |accessdate=2014-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Suicide ceased to be a criminal offence with the passing of the [[Suicide Act 1961]]; the same Act made it an offence to assist in a suicide. With respect to [[Civil law (common law)|civil law]] the simple act of suicide is lawful but the consequences of dying by suicide might turn an individual event into an unlawful act, as in the case of Reeves v Commissioners of Police of the Metropolis [2000] 1 AC 360,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk/pa/ld199899/ldjudgmt/jd990715/reeves01.htm |title=House of Lords - Commissioners of Police for the Metropolis v. Reeves (A.P.) (Joint Administratix of the Estate of Martin Lynch, Deceased) |publisher=Parliament.the-stationery-office.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; where a man in police custody hanged himself and was held equally liable with the police (a cell door defect enabled the hanging) for the loss suffered by his widow; the practical effect was to reduce the police damages liability by 50%. In 2009, the House of Lords ruled that the law concerning the treatment of people who accompanied those who died by assisted suicide was unclear, following [[Debbie Purdy]]'s case that this lack of clarity was a breach of her human rights. (In her case, as a sufferer from multiple sclerosis, she wanted to know whether her husband would be prosecuted for accompanying her abroad where she may eventually wish to die by assisted suicide, if her illness progressed.)

====Scotland====
Suicide directly involving only the deceased person is not by itself a criminal offence under Scots Law and has not been in recent history. However, attempting suicide might be a [[Breach of the peace]] if it is not done as a private act; this is routinely reported in the case of persons threatening suicide in areas frequented by the public. The Suicide Act 1961 applies only to England and Wales but under [[Scots Law]] a person who assists a suicide might be charged with murder, [[culpable homicide]], or no offence depending upon the facts of each case. Despite not being a criminal offence, consequential liability upon the person attempting suicide (or if successful, his/her estate) might arise under civil law where e.g. it parallels the civil liabilities recognised in the (English Law) Reeves case mentioned above.

===United States===
Historically, various states listed the act of suicide as a felony, but these policies were sparsely enforced. In the late 1960s, eighteen U.S. states had no laws against suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |volume=6 |publisher=Washburn L.J. |page=395 |date=1966–1967 |title=Medical-Legal Aspects of Suicide |author=Litman, Robert E. |url=http://heinonlinebackup.com/hol-cgi-bin/get_pdf.cgi?handle=hein.journals/wasbur6&amp;section=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 1980s, thirty of the fifty states had no laws against suicide or suicide attempts but every state had laws declaring it to be a felony to aid, advise or encourage another person to die by suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Approaches and commonalities of suicide |author=ES Shneidman |publisher=Suicide and its prevention |url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=6d3777E9uAEC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA14|page=24 |title=Suicide and Its Prevention: The Role of Attitude and Imitation|isbn=9789004086135}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 1990s only two states still listed suicide as a crime, and these have since removed that classification.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} In some U.S. states, suicide is still considered an unwritten "[[common law crime]]," as stated in [[Blackstone's Commentaries]]. (So held the [[Virginia Supreme Court]] in 1992. ''Wackwitz v. Roy'', 418 S.E.2d 861 (Va. 1992)). As a common law crime, suicide can bar recovery for the late suicidal person's family in a lawsuit unless the suicidal person can be proven to have been "of unsound mind." That is, the suicide must be proven to have been an involuntary act of the victim in order for the family to be awarded monetary damages by the court. This can occur when the family of the deceased sues the caregiver (perhaps a jail or hospital) for negligence in failing to provide appropriate care.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jaapl.org/cgi/content/full/33/2/176 On Sound and Unsound Mind: The Role of Suicide in Tort and Insurance Litigation], ''Journal of the American Academy of Psychiatry and the Law'', 2005&lt;/ref&gt;  Some American legal scholars look at the issue as one of personal liberty. According to [[Nadine Strossen]], former President of the [[ACLU]], "The idea of government making determinations about how you end your life, forcing you...could be considered [[cruel and unusual punishment]] in certain circumstances, and [[Justice Stevens]] in a very interesting opinion in a [[Right to Die|right-to-die]] [case] raised the analogy."&lt;ref&gt;[[n:ACLU President Strossen on religion, drugs, guns and impeaching George Bush#Gun rights|Interview with Nadine Strossen]], David Shankbone, ''[[Wikinews]]'', October 30, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
Physician-assisted suicide is legal in some states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nightingalealliance.org/pdf/state_grid.pdf |title=Account Suspended |publisher=Nightingalealliance.org |date= |accessdate=2014-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the terminally ill, it is legal in the state of [[Oregon]] under the [[Oregon Death with Dignity Act]]. In Washington state, it became legal in 2009, when a law modeled after the Oregon act, the [[Washington Death with Dignity Act]] was passed. A patient must be diagnosed as having less than six months to live, be of sound mind, make a request orally and in writing, have it approved by two different doctors, then wait 15&amp;nbsp;days and make the request again. A doctor may prescribe a lethal dose of a medication but may not administer it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://blogs.wsj.com/health/2009/03/05/washingtons-physician-assisted-suicide-law-takes-effect/tab/article/ | work=The Wall Street Journal | first=Jacob | last=Goldstein | title=Washington's Physician-Assisted Suicide Law Takes Effect | date=March 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In California, medical facilities are empowered or required to commit anyone whom they believe to be suicidal for evaluation and treatment.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Code 5150|California Welfare and Institutions Code section 5150]], for example.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Maryland]], it is an open question as to whether suicide is illegal. In 2018, a Maryland man was convicted of [[attempted suicide]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/crime/bs-md-suicide-criminal-charge-20180222-story.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.myeasternshoremd.com/stardem/news/local_news/rare-attempted-suicide-charge-goes-through-caroline-court/article_3e8f7813-a2c6-555c-a8cd-7876e09013e3.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5441037/Mentally-ill-Maryland-man-convicted-attempted-suicide.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.stardem.com/opinion/columns/attempted-suicide-likely-not-a-crime/article_5cc4e7d0-ffbf-5cce-8eb4-bb7a503141ab.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Swedish nationality law''' determines entitlement to '''Swedish citizenship'''. [[Citizenship]] of [[Sweden]] is based primarily on the principle of ''[[jus sanguinis]]''. In other words, citizenship is conferred primarily by birth to a Swedish parent, irrespective of place of birth. 

In general, children born in Sweden to foreign parents do not acquire Swedish citizenship at birth, although if they remain resident in Sweden they may become Swedish later on.

[[Swedish law]] was significantly amended with effect from 1 July 2001 and from that date, [[dual citizenship]] is permitted without restriction.

==Birth==
A child born after 1 April 2015 acquires Swedish citizenship automatically if:

* one of the parents is a Swedish citizen at the time of the child's birth
* a deceased parent of the child was a Swedish citizen upon their death

A child born before 1 April 2015 acquired Swedish citizenship at birth if:

* the child's mother was a Swedish citizen (Swedish mothers have only been able to pass on their citizenship since 1 July 1979); or -
* the child's father was a Swedish citizen and was married to the child's mother; or -
* the child's father was a Swedish citizen, the child was born out of [[Marriage|wedlock]], and the child was born in Sweden.

For example, a child born to a Swedish father and a non-Swedish mother will not be Swedish if either: its parents are not married to each other or if they were not married when it was conceived and it was born outside of Sweden, unless the father sends notification to an embassy or consulate with the child's passport, birth certificate, proof of his own citizenship at the time of the birth, and a certificate of paternity. A child who is born abroad and whose father is a Swedish citizen (not married to the child's mother, and the mother is not Swedish) will acquire Swedish citizenship when the parents get married, provided the child is aged under 18.

==Adoption==
A child who is aged under 12 and who has been adopted by a Swedish citizen automatically receives Swedish citizenship upon adoption if

* the child has been adopted as the result of a decision taken in [[Sweden]] or in another [[Nordic Council]] country
* the child has been adopted as the result of a decision taken abroad and approved in Sweden by the Swedish Intercountry Adoptions Authority
* the adoption is valid under Swedish law.

The adoption must have been officially decided or approved after 30 June 1992.

A child aged 12 or more at the time of adoption may acquire Swedish citizenship by application.

==Naturalization as a Swedish citizen==

Swedish citizenship can be acquired by naturalization, also known as citizenship by ''application''.

A foreigner may be granted Swedish citizenship upon meeting certain requirements, including:

* holding a permanent residence permit, unless a citizen of a [[Nordic Council]] country.   For citizens of [[European Economic Area]] nations, limited residence permits for five years equate to a permanent residence permit.

A number of exemptions apply to the residence period:

* the residence period is reduced to 4 years for recognised refugees and [[stateless person]]s.
* citizens of other [[Nordic Council]] countries are only required to have two years' residence in Sweden.
* former Swedish citizens
* those employed on Swedish ships
* persons employed abroad by Swedish corporations
* a person with previous long residence in Sweden

For those married to, living in a registered partnership with or cohabiting with a Swedish citizen, he/she can apply for Swedish citizenship after three years. In these cases, he/she must have been living together for the past two years. It is not enough to be married to one another, he/she must also live together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.migrationsverket.se/English/Private-individuals/Becoming-a-Swedish-citizen/Citizenship-for-adults/Time-in-Sweden.html|title=You must have lived in Sweden for a certain period of time|publisher=[[Swedish Migration Agency]]|accessdate=22 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sweden imposes no requirements on Swedish language abilities or knowledge about Swedish history or culture, the only other countries in Europe without these requirements are [[Belgium]], [[Ireland]] and [[Italy]].&lt;ref name="glob5jun2008"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rooth|last2=Strömblad|title=(sv) Underlagsrapport nr 14 till Globaliseringsrådet: Språk, krav och medborgarskap|url=http://www.regeringen.se/49b72e/contentassets/4bc626c57dba4157a3a67d614b4495ab/sprak-krav-och-medborgarskap|website=regeringen.se|publisher=Swedish cabinet / Globaliseringsrådet 5 June 2008|accessdate=5 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Citizenship by notification==
Notification is a simpler method of acquiring Swedish citizenship (i.e. ''simplified naturalisation'').   Those not eligible for notification may still be eligible for naturalisation by application.   

Categories of persons eligible for citizenship by notification include:

===Stateless persons===
A stateless person may acquire Swedish citizenship by notification if that person has a permanent resident permit and falls into one of the following categories:

* born in Sweden and aged less than five;
* aged under 18 and in the custody of a Swedish citizen;
* aged 18 or 19 and resident in Sweden since age 15.

===Young persons resident in Sweden===
Swedish citizenship may be acquired by notification by young persons who hold a permanent resident permit in the following cases:

* aged under 18 and resident in Sweden for three years
* aged 18 or 19, where the person has been resident in Sweden since turning 15.

===Former Swedish citizens===
Former Swedish citizens who hold permanent resident permits may acquire Swedish citizenship by notification if the following conditions are fulfilled:
* aged 18 or over
* resident in Sweden for 10 years preceding age 18.
* resident in Sweden for the 2 years preceding the application
Those former Swedish citizens who are citizens of other Nordic countries may acquire Swedish citizenship by notification immediately upon resuming residence in Sweden.

===Citizens of Nordic countries===
Citizens of other [[Nordic Council]] countries ([[Denmark]], [[Norway]], [[Iceland]] and [[Finland]]) may be eligible for Swedish citizenship by notification in the following cases:

* aged 18 or over
* the other Nordic citizenship has been acquired other than by naturalisation
* 2 years' residence in Sweden
* And a person who has lived in Sweden for 5 years, who can speak and write Swedish, can be qualified to obtain citizenship provided there is no criminal history.

==Loss of Swedish citizenship==
Although dual citizenship is permitted, a Swedish citizen who was born outside Sweden and is a citizen of another country will lose Swedish citizenship at age 22 unless he or she is granted approval to retain Swedish citizenship between ages 18-21. However, approval is not required if:

* the person has ever been domiciled in Sweden; or
* the person has ever been in Sweden under circumstances that indicate a link with Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sweden.gov.se/content/1/c6/10/57/28/3ddfc07b.pdf |title=Please note: this translation is not an official, legally binding document |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In such cases the Swedish citizenship is retained.

==Dual citizenship==
With effect from 1 July 2001, a Swedish citizen acquiring a foreign citizenship does not lose Swedish citizenship.

Former Swedish citizens who lost Swedish citizenship prior to this date (upon naturalisation in another country) were given a two-year period to re-acquire Swedish citizenship by declaration.  Children of former Swedish citizens were also eligible to acquire Swedish citizenship by declaration. The deadline for submission of applications was 30 June 2003.

The changes to the law also mean that foreigners seeking naturalisation as a Swedish citizen do not need to renounce their former citizenship.   They may retain it if the law of the other country permits them to do so.  Swedish citizens who nonetheless hold [[Japanese citizenship]] must normally, under Japan's nationality law, notify Japan's [[Ministry of Justice (Japan)|Ministry of Justice]], before turning 22, whether to keep their Swedish or Japanese citizenship.

Prior to 1 July 2001, Swedish citizens were still able to legally hold dual citizenship in certain circumstances, for example, if the other citizenship was acquired automatically at birth.

==Citizenship of the European Union==
Because Sweden forms part of the [[European Union]], Swedish citizens are also [[citizenship of the European Union|citizens of the European Union]] under [[European Union law]] and thus enjoy [[Freedom of movement for workers#Transitional provisions in new member states|rights of free movement]] and [[Sweden (European Parliament constituency)|have the right to vote]] in [[Elections in the European Union|elections]] for the [[European Parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://europa.eu/about-eu/countries/member-countries/sweden/index_en.htm | title=Sweden | publisher=European Union | accessdate=4 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; When in a non-EU country where there is no Swedish embassy, Swedish citizens have the right to get consular protection from the embassy of any other EU country present in that country.&lt;ref&gt;Article 20(2)(c) of the [[s:Consolidated version of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union/Part Two: Non-Discrimination and Citizenship of the Union#Article 20|Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Citizenship_of_the_European_Union#Stated_rights|Rights abroad: Right to consular protection]]: a right to protection by the diplomatic or consular authorities of other Member States when in a non-EU Member State, if there are no diplomatic or consular authorities from the citizen's own state (Article 23): this is due to the fact that not all member states maintain embassies in every country in the world (14 countries have only one embassy from an EU state).

==Travel freedom of Swedish citizens==
{{Main|Visa requirements for Swedish citizens}}
[[File:Visa requirements for Swedish citizens.png|450px|thumbnail|[[Visa requirements for Swedish citizens]]]]
Visa requirements for Swedish citizens are administrative entry restrictions by the authorities of other states placed on citizens of [[Sweden]]. As of May 2018, Swedish citizens had visa-free or visa on arrival access to 187 countries and territories, ranking the Swedish passport third in the world according to the [[Henley Passport Index|Visa Restrictions Index]].

The Swedish nationality is ranked seventh in [[The Quality of Nationality Index]] (QNI). This index differs from the [[Henley Passport Index|Visa Restrictions Index]], which focuses on external factors including travel freedom. The QNI considers, in addition, to travel freedom on internal factors such as peace &amp; stability, economic strength, and human development as well. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.businessinsider.de/nationalities-with-the-best-quality-of-life-2016-6?r=UK&amp;IR=T |title= The 41 nationalities with the best quality of life |date= 2016-02-06 |website=  www.businessinsider.de |access-date= 2018-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Television Act 1954''' was a British law which permitted the creation of the first commercial [[television]] network in the [[United Kingdom]], [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]].

Until the early 1950s, the only television service in Britain was operated as a monopoly by the [[British Broadcasting Corporation]], and financed by the annual [[television licence]] fee payable by each household which contained one or more television sets. The new [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government elected in 1951 wanted to create a [[commercial television]] channel, but this was a controversial subject—the only other examples of commercial television were to be found in the [[United States]], and it was widely considered that the commercial television found there was "vulgar".

The solution to the problem was to create the [[Independent Television Authority]] which would closely regulate the new commercial channel in the interests of good taste, and award franchises to commercial companies for fixed terms. Aware that TV coverage of the Coronation of [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] in the USA had been interrupted by advertisements, one of which featured celebrity [[chimpanzee]] [[J. Fred Muggs]], a clause was included in the Act banning advertising breaks during broadcasts featuring the Royal Family.

The first commercial franchises were awarded in 1954, and commercial television started broadcasting in stages between 1955 and 1962. The first advertisement aired by ITV promoted [[Gibbs SR]] toothpaste at 20.12hrs local time on 22 September 1955. Household cleaners were the most frequently advertised products over the 1955&amp;ndash;1960 period.

On 6 October 2007 William Elliott and Robert McKee were arrested and charged for theft of building materials. Elliott’s left thumbprint, which had been recorded by the Livescan electronic fingerprint reader, matched a print that had been found on the packaging of the stolen materials. Both Elliott and McKee were convicted and sentenced to eight months imprisonment. The defendants appealed the ruling on the basis that the fingerprint evidence was not admissible, as the device used to record the fingerprints was not an approved device; they were subsequently acquitted. The [[Public Prosecution Service for Northern Ireland|Public Prosecution Service]] appealed the acquittal, which was then reversed by the [[Court of Appeal (Ireland)|Court of Appeal]].

Elliott and McKee subsequently appealed to the Supreme Court, which concluded that Court of Appeal decision was correct and dismissed the appeal.

== Background ==

This case relates to the question of admissibility of fingerprint evidence obtained by investigating authorities using an electronic fingerprint scanner which at that time had never received the Secretary of State's approval for use, as required by legislation.

The law applicable is [[English criminal law]].

== Facts ==

On 6 October 2007 William Elliott and Robert McKee were arrested and charged for theft of building materials. The defendants were found in a Ford Transit van located near to building materials stacked beside the perimeter fence of Aluminium &amp; Plastic Systems (from where the materials had been removed). The defendants claimed they were in the area innocently.

The police noted grass clippings on clothing located in the van and also noted that the grass of Aluminium &amp; Plastic Systems premises had been recently cut. The defendants were unwilling to account for the grass clippings on the clothing article and were subsequently arrested, and the van was seized along with the clothing article and a pair of wire cutters that had been found in the footwell of the van.

At the [[Police Service of Northern Ireland]] Lisburn station, a [[Livescan]] electronic fingerprint device reader was used to obtain impressions of the suspects' fingerprints. Elliott’s left thumbprint matched a print that had been found on the packaging of the stolen materials.

At the time of the arrest, the Secretary of State had not approved the Livescan device for use, as required by Article 61(8)(b) of the Police and Criminal Evidence (Northern Ireland) Order 1989  ("The Northern Ireland Order").&lt;ref name="The Northern Ireland Order"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Police and Criminal Evidence (Northern Ireland) Order 1989|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/nisi/1989/1341/data.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Article 61(8)(b) states "''Where a person's fingerprints are taken electronically, they must be taken only in such manner, and using such devices, as the Secretary of State has approved for the purposes of electronic fingerprinting.''"

== Procedural history ==

The defendants were prosecuted at the Magistrates' Court, convicted and sentenced to 8 months imprisonment; critically the prosecuting authorities in making their case relied on the matching fingerprint obtained by the Livescan device.

The defendants, on learning that an unapproved device had been used to obtain their fingerprint impressions, appealed to the [[Craigavon]] County Court on the basis that the fingerprint evidence obtained using the Livescan device was inadmissible, as the Secretary of State had not approved the Livescan electronic fingerprint reader as required by the amended Police and Criminal Evidence (Northern Ireland) Order 1989 ("The Amended Order")&lt;ref name="Northern Ireland Amendment"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Police and Criminal Evidence (Amendment) (Northern Ireland) Order 2007|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/nisi/2007/288/pdfs/uksi_20070288_en.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; that had come into effect on the 1st March 2007.

Judge Markey QC acquitted the pair; however, the [[Public Prosecution Service for Northern Ireland|Public Prosecution Service]] (PPS) requested that the opinion of the [[Courts of Northern Ireland#Court of Appeal|Northern Ireland Court of Appeal]] be sought on the question of the admissibility of evidence in the event of statutory non-compliance.&lt;ref name="Appeal McKee"&gt;{{cite web|title=Court of Appeal in Northern Ireland Decisions, IN HER MAJESTY'S COURT OF APPEAL IN NORTHERN IRELAND, THE PUBLIC PROSECUTION SERVICE Appellant; -and-  WILLIAM ELLIOTT and ROBERT McKEE Respondents|url=http://www.bailii.org/nie/cases/NICA/2011/61.html|accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Law ==

The Northern Ireland Order is similar but not identical to the [[Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984]](PACE)&lt;ref name=PACE&gt;{{cite web|title=Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 CHAPTER 60|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1984/60/data.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; in force for both [[England]] and [[Wales]]; in both, Article 61 and Section 61 respectively deal with fingerprinting. The Order sets out the conditions under which fingerprints can be taken; namely that they be obtained under consent, or in the course of an investigation during which an arrest has been made for a [[recordable offence]].

The Amended Order amended the Northern Ireland Order, inserting the aforementioned paragraph 8(b) into Article 61, which was then later repealed on the 12th January 2010 after which there was no requirement for statutory approval of electronic fingerprint devices in [[Northern Ireland]], [[England]] or [[Wales]]. However, whilst the amendment was in force, approval was only provided on the 29th March 2009, a little over two years after amendment 8(b) came into force.

== Issue ==

Lord Hughes addressed the issue the statutory impact on the admissibility of the evidence obtained through the use of an unapproved device.&lt;ref name="PPS v McKee"&gt;{{cite web|title=United Kingdom Supreme Court, Public Prosecution Service v McKee (AP) (Northern Ireland) Public Prosecution Service of Northern Ireland v Elliott (AP) (Northern Ireland), [2013] UKSC 32| url=http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKSC/2013/32.html|accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mr McMahon QC for the appellants put forward that the wording of Article 61(8)(b) was clear and unambiguous; that an approved device must be used and therefore that evidence obtained through the use of an unapproved device rendered the evidence inadmissible.

The issue, as Lord Hughes stated, was that there was no specific provision for the consequence of not using an approved device, as there was in other similar acts such as Section 20 of the Road Traffic Offenders Act 1988,&lt;ref name="Road Traffic Offenders Act"&gt;{{cite web|title=Road Traffic Offenders Act 1988 CHAPTER 53|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1988/53/data.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and similarly Article 23(1) and 4 of the Road Traffic Offenders (Northern Ireland) Order 1996&lt;ref name="The Road Traffic Offenders (Northern Ireland) Order"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Road Traffic Offenders (Northern Ireland) Order 1996|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/nisi/1996/1320/made/data.pdf|accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; where specific provisions of the consequence of not using an approved device were stated.

Lord Hughes in his judgment addressed the admissibility of evidence, particularly when obtained through unlawful means; the intended consequence Parliament had in mind of not using an approved device; and similar provisions (and differences in process) for other devices such as traffic speed gun and breathalyser test devices.

== Admissibility of evidence ==

Under [[common law]] practised in the UK, evidence is not necessarily automatically inadmissible if obtained unlawfully. Lord Hughes refers to several precedents in this regard: Privy Council in Kuruma v The Queen [1955] AC 197,&lt;ref name="Kuruma Son of Kaniu"&gt;{{cite web|title=Kuruma Son of Kaniu (Appeal No. 35 of 1954) v The Queen (Eastern Africa) [1954] UKPC 43 (8 December 1954)|url=http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKPC/1954/1954_43.html|accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; House of Lords in R v Sang [1980] AC 402&lt;ref name="Regina v. Soneji"&gt;{{cite web|title=OPINIONS OF THE LORDS OF APPEAL FOR JUDGMENT IN THE CAUSE Regina v. Soneji and another (Respondents) (On Appeal from the Court of Appeal (Criminal Division)) Appellate Committee, Lord Steyn|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldjudgmt/jd050721/son-1.htm|accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in Fox v Chief Constable of Gwent [1986] AC 281&lt;ref name="Fox -v- Chief Constable of Gwent"&gt;{{cite web|title=Fox -v- Chief Constable of Gwent; HL 1986|url=http://swarb.co.uk/fox-v-chief-constable-of-gwent-hl-1986/|accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, the evidence if relevant would be admissible, even if obtained illegally. In this respect Hughes cited the summary by Lord Fraser in Fox v Chief Constable of Gwent [1986] that ''"It is a well established rule of English law, which was recognised in Reg. v. Sang, that (apart from confessions as to which special considerations apply) any evidence which is relevant is admissible even if it has been obtained illegally"''.&lt;ref name="Fox -v- Chief Constable of Gwent" /&gt;

== Consequences intended by Parliament ==

Contrary to Mr McMahon QC’s claim that Article 61(8)(b) rendered the evidence inadmissible, Lord Hughes suggested the paragraph 8(b) could be interpreted in the following manner:

''"the article still meant that a requirement by a policeman of a suspect in custody that he provide his fingerprints on an unapproved device would be one which the suspect was entitled to refuse"''

Put another way, Article 61 outlines conditions where consent by the suspect is not required, whereas paragraph 8(b) suggests that consent ''is'' required in the event that the device is unapproved (and known by the suspect to be unapproved), and should the suspect therefore refuse on this basis, then the suspect would not ''"commit the offence of obstructing a police officer"''.

However, Hughes went on to say that ''"It is necessary to examine the question what Parliament must have intended to be the consequence of non-approval of Livescan"'', referencing the now less relevant mandatory and directory distinction and the contemporary focus on the intended consequence of non-compliance. This required exploring similar acts in place for other electronic devices.

== Provisions relating to other measurement devices ==

In doing so, Hughes highlighted a key defining difference between certain electronic devices used in evidence gathering; namely that breathalyser and speed guns capture a measurement of an activity at a point of time that cannot be re-captured again at another point in time. The consequence of using unapproved devices where measurements of an activity cannot be recaptured is that the evidence gathered is inadmissible; whereas in the case of a fingerprint reader, the measurement of the suspect’s fingerprints, if contested, can be retaken at any point of time.

Lord Hughes concluded that the evidence was therefore admissible, and that the appellants' appeal should be dismissed. {{Cquote|that Parliament did not intend, by enacting article 61(8B), that the consequence of an absence of approval should be to render inadmissible any fingerprints produced electronically. The decision of the Court of Appeal that the evidence of Elliott's control fingerprints was admissible was correct. It follows that this appeal must be dismissed}}

== Commentary ==
This case clarifies that evidence obtained using certain devices at the time lacking approval, even if there is a statutory requirement for them to be approved, is not automatically inadmissible. However, this is predicated on the nature of the activity and measurement being taken, namely that it must be possible to recapture the same measurement of the activity: a fingerprint impression can be recaptured, but not a measurement of the speed of a car, or a measurement with a breathalyser that formed the basis of a prosecution in the first instance. This raises issues in relation to the increasing use of electronic or digital tools in the capture of evidence, in view of the fast pace of change, the proliferation of technologies and procedures, and the fact that certain electronic evidence (e.g. SSD Drives) may not be capable of being recaptured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bell|first1=Graeme|last2=Boddington|first2=Richard|title=Solid State Drives: The Beginning of the End for Current Practice in Digital Forensic Recovery?|url=http://cs.gmu.edu/~astavrou/courses/ISA_785_F11/solid_state_drives.pdf|publisher=Journal of Digital Forensics, Security and Law, Vol. 5(3)|accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gubanovis|first1=Yuri|last2=Afonin|first2=Oleg|title=Recovering Evidence from SSD Drives in 2014: Understanding TRIM, Garbage Collection and Exclusions|url=http://articles.forensicfocus.com/2014/09/23/recovering-evidence-from-ssd-drives-in-2014-understanding-trim-garbage-collection-and-exclusions/|publisher=Forensic Focus|accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Treaties of the European Union''' are a set of [[Treaty|international treaties]] between the [[European Union]] (EU) [[Member state of the European Union|member states]] which sets out the EU's [[Constitution|constitutional basis]]. They establish the various [[Institutions of the European Union|EU institutions]] together with their remit, procedures and objectives. The EU can only act within the competences granted to it through these treaties and amendment to the treaties requires the agreement and ratification (according to their national procedures) of every single signatory.

Two core functional treaties, the [[Treaty on European Union]] (originally signed in [[Maastricht]] in 1992, aka The Maastricht Treaty) and the [[Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]] (originally signed in Rome in 1957 as the Treaty establishing the European Economic Community, aka The Treaty of Rome), lay out how the EU operates, and there are a number of satellite treaties which are interconnected with them. The treaties have been repeatedly amended by other treaties over the 65 years since they were first signed. The consolidated version of the two core treaties is regularly published by the European Commission.

==Content==
The two principal treaties on which the EU is based are the Treaty on European Union (TEU; [[Maastricht Treaty]], effective since 1993) and the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU; [[Treaties of Rome|Treaty of Rome]], effective since 1958). These main treaties (plus their attached protocols and declarations) have been altered by amending treaties at least once a decade since they each came into force, the latest being the [[Treaty of Lisbon]] which came into force in 2009. The Lisbon Treaty also made the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union|Charter of Fundamental Rights]] legally binding, though it remains a separate document.

===Treaty on European Union===
{{main|Treaty on European Union}}
{{Wikisource|Consolidated version of the Treaty on European Union}}
Following the preamble the treaty text is divided into six parts.&lt;ref name=ojc115/&gt;

;'''Title''' 1, ''Common Provisions''
The first deals with common provisions. Article 1 establishes the European Union on the basis of the European Community and lays out the legal value of the treaties. The second article states that the EU is "founded on the values of respect for human dignity, freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and respect for human rights, including the rights of persons belonging to minorities". The member states share a "society in which pluralism, non-discrimination, tolerance, justice, solidarity and equality between women and men prevail".

Article 3 then states the aims of the EU in six points. The first is simply to promote peace, European values and its citizens' well-being. The second relates to [[Four Freedoms (European Union)|free movement]] with external border controls are in place. Point 3 deals with the [[internal market]]. Point 4 establishes the euro. Point 5 states the EU shall promote its values, contribute to eradicating poverty, observe human rights and respect the [[charter of the United Nations]]. The final sixth point states that the EU shall pursue these objectives by "appropriate means" according with its competences given in the treaties.

{{Wikisource|Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union}}
Article 4 relates to member states' sovereignty and obligations. Article 5 sets out the principles of conferral, [[subsidiarity]] and proportionality with respect to the limits of its powers. Article 6 binds the EU to the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union]] and the [[European Convention on Human Rights]]. [[Article 7 of the Treaty on European Union|Article 7]] deals with the suspension of a member state and article 8 deals with establishing close relations with neighbouring states.

;Title 2, Provisions on democratic principles
Article 9 establishes the equality of national citizens and [[citizenship of the European Union]]. Article 10 declares that the EU is founded in [[representative democracy]] and that decisions must be taken as closely as possible to citizens. It makes reference to [[European political parties]] and how citizens are represented: directly in the Parliament and by their governments in the Council and European Council – accountable to [[National parliaments of the European Union|national parliaments]]. Article 11 establishes government transparency, declares that broad consultations must be made and introduces [[European Citizens' Initiative|provision for a petition]] where at least 1 million citizens may petition the Commission to legislate on a matter. Article 12 gives national parliaments limited involvement in the legislative process.

;Title 3, Provisions on the institutions
Article 13 establishes the [[Institutions of the European Union|institutions]] in the following order and under the following names: the [[European Parliament]], the [[European Council]], the [[Council of the European Union|Council]], the [[European Commission]], the [[Court of Justice of the European Union]], the [[European Central Bank]] and the [[Court of Auditors]]. It obliges co-operation between these and limits their competencies to the powers within the treaties.

Article 14 deals with the workings of Parliament and its election, article 15 with the European Council and its president, article 16 with the Council and its configurations and article 17 with the Commission and its appointment. Article 18 establishes the [[High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy]] and article 19 establishes the Court of Justice.

;Title 4, Provisions on [[Enhanced co-operation|enhanced cooperations]]
Title 4 has only one article which allows a limited number of member states to co-operate within the EU if others are blocking integration in that field.

;Title 5, General provisions on the Union's external action and specific provisions on the [[Common Foreign and Security Policy]]
Chapter 1 of this title includes articles 21 and 22. Article 21 deals with the principles that outline EU foreign policy; including compliance with the [[UN charter]], promoting global trade, humanitarian support and global governance. Article 22 gives the European Council, acting unanimously, control over defining the EU's foreign policy.

Chapter 2 is further divided into sections. The first, common provisions, details the guidelines and functioning of the EU's foreign policy, including establishment of the [[European External Action Service]] and member state's responsibilities. Section 2, articles 42 to 46, deal with military cooperation (including [[Permanent Structured Cooperation]] and mutual defence).

;Title 6, Final provisions

Article 47 establishes a [[legal personality]] for the EU. Article 48 deals with the method of treaty amendment; specifically the ordinary and simplified revision procedures. Article 49 deals with applications to [[Enlargement of the European Union|join the EU]] and article 50 with [[Withdrawal from the European Union|withdrawal]]. Article 51 deals with the protocols attached to the treaties and article 52 with the geographic application of the treaty. Article 53 states the treaty is in force for an unlimited period, article 54 deals with ratification and 55 with the different language versions of the treaties.

===Treaty on the functioning of the European Union===
{{main|Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union}}
{{Wikisource|Consolidated version of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union}}
The Treaty on the functioning of the European Union goes into deeper detail on the role, policies and operation of the EU. It is split into seven parts.&lt;ref name=ojc115&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=OJ:C:2008:115:TOC eur-lex.europa.eu: "ISSN 1725-2423 Official Journal of the European Union, C 115 Volume 51, 9 May 2008], retrieved 1 Jun 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TFEU consolidated"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2008:115:0047:0199:EN:PDF|format=PDF|title=Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union|publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu|accessdate=2015-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Euratom===
{{wikisource|Consolidated version of the Treaty establishing the European Atomic Energy Community}}
As well as the two main treaties, their protocols and the Charter of Fundamental Rights; the Treaty Establishing a [[European Atomic Energy Community]] (Euratom) is still in force as a separate treaty.

Title one outlines the tasks of Euratom. Title two contains the core of the treaty on how cooperation in the field is to take place. Title three outlines institutional provisions and has largely been subsumed by the European Union treaties. Title four is on financial provisions and title five on the general and title six is on final provisions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2010:084:0001:0112:EN:PDF CONSOLIDATED VERSION OF THE TREATY ESTABLISHING THE EUROPEAN ATOMIC ENERGY COMMUNITY (2010/C 84/01)],
EurLex. Retrieved 18 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Amendment and ratification==
{{Politics of the European Union}}
The treaties can be changed in three different ways. The ordinary revision procedure is essentially the traditional method by which the treaties have been amended and involves holding a full inter-governmental conference. The simplified revision procedure was established by the [[Treaty of Lisbon]] and only allows for changes which do not increase the power of the EU. While using the passerelle clause does involve amending the treaties, as such, it does allow for a change of legislative procedure in certain circumstances.

The '''ordinary revision procedure''' for amending treaties requires proposals from an institution to be lodged with the European Council. The [[President of the European Council]] can then either call a European Convention (composed of national governments, national parliamentarians, [[Member of the European Parliament|MEPs]] and representatives from the [[European Commission|Commission]]) to draft the changes or draft the proposals in the European Council itself if the change is minor. They then proceed with an [[Intergovernmental Conference]] (IGC) which agrees the treaty which is then signed by all the national leaders and ratified by each state.&lt;ref name="HOL REV"&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldselect/ldeucom/62/6206.htm Select Committee on European Union Tenth Report: CHAPTER 3: SIMPLIFIED TREATY REVISION AND PASSERELLES], [[British House of Lords]] 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

While this is the procedure that has been use for all treaties prior to the Lisbon Treaty, an actual European Convention (essentially, a [[Constitutional convention (political meeting)|constitutional convention]]) has only been called twice. First in the drafting of the Charter of Fundamental Rights with the [[European Convention (1999–2000)|European Convention of 1999–2000]]. Second with the [[Convention on the Future of Europe]] which drafted the Constitutional Treaty (which then formed the basis of the Lisbon Treaty). Previously, treaties had been drafted by civil servants.

The '''simplified revision procedure''', which applies only to part three of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union and cannot increase the powers of the EU, sees changes simply agreed in the European Council by a decision before being ratified by each state.&lt;ref name="HOL REV"/&gt; The amendment to article 136 TFEU makes use of the simplified revision procedure due to the small scope of its change.

Any reform to the legal basis of the EU must be ratified according to the procedures in each member state. All states are required to ratify it and lodge the instruments of ratification with the [[Politics of Italy|Government of Italy]] before the treaty can come into force in any respect. In some states, such as Ireland, this is usually a referendum as any change to that state's constitution requires one. In others, such as Germany, referendums are constitutionally banned and the ratification must take place in its [[National parliaments of the European Union|national parliament]].

On some occasions, a state has failed to get a treaty passed by its public in a referendum. In the cases of Ireland and [[Denmark]] a second referendum was held after a number of concessions were granted. However, in the case of France and the [[Netherlands]], the treaty was abandoned in favour of a treaty that would not prompt a referendum. In the case of [[Norway]], where the treaty was their accession treaty, the treaty (hence, their membership) was also abandoned.

Treaties are also put before the [[European Parliament]] and while its vote is not binding, it is important; both the [[Belgian Federal Parliament|Belgian]] and [[Parliament of Italy|Italian Parliaments]] said they would veto the [[Nice Treaty]] if the European Parliament did not approve it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://euobserver.com/9/1127 |title=European Parliament may reject the Nice Treaty |publisher=Euobserver.com |date=2015-04-15 |accessdate=2015-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Minor amendments not requiring ratification===
{{main|Passerelle Clause}}
The treaties contain a '''passerelle clause''' which allows the [[European Council]] to unanimously agree to change the applicable [[Voting in the Council of the European Union|voting procedure in the Council of Ministers]] to QMV and to change legislation adoption procedure from a special to the ordinary legislative procedure, provided that no national parliament objects. This procedure cannot be used for areas which have defence implications.&lt;ref name="HOL REV"/&gt;

The fourth amendment procedure is for '''changing status''' of some of the [[Special member state territories and the European Union|special member state territories]]. The status of French, Dutch and Danish overseas territories can be changed more easily, by no longer requiring a full treaty revision. Instead, the European Council may, on the initiative of the member state concerned, change the status of an [[overseas countries and territories|overseas country or territory]] (OCT) to an [[outermost region]] (OMR) or vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;The provision reads:

{{quote|Article 311 shall be repealed. A new Article 311a shall be inserted, with the wording of Article 299(2), first subparagraph, and Article 299(3) to (6); the text shall be amended as follows:

[...]

(e) the following new paragraph shall be added at the end of the Article:

"6. The European Council may, on the initiative of the Member State concerned, adopt a decision amending the status, with regard to the Union, of a Danish, French or Netherlands country or territory referred to in paragraphs 1 and 2. The European Council shall act unanimously after consulting the Commission."||[http://www.consilium.europa.eu/uedocs/cmsUpload/cg00014.en07.pdf Treaty of Lisbon] Article 2, point 293}}&lt;/ref&gt; This provision doesn't apply to special territories of the other member states.

==Abandoned treaties==
[[File:Oui Non Non Bourgogne 2005.jpg|thumb|The European Constitution failed due to negative votes in two member states]]

;1973 and 1995 Acts of Accession of Norway
[[Norway]] applied to join the European Communities/Union on two occasions. Both times a national referendum rejected membership, leading Norway to abandon their ratification of the treaty of accession. The first treaty was signed in [[Brussels]] on 22 January 1972 and the second in [[Corfu]] on 24 June 1994.

;[[Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe]] (the European Constitution)
{{wikisource|Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe}}
The European Constitution was a treaty that would have repealed and consolidated all previous overlapping treaties (except the Euratom treaty) into a single document. It also made changes to voting systems, simplified the structure of the EU and advanced co-operation in foreign policy. The treaty was signed in Rome on 29 October 2004 and was due to come into force on 1 November 2006 if it was ratified by all member states. However, this did not occur, with France rejecting the document in a [[French European Constitution referendum, 2005|national referendum]] on 29 May 2005 and then the Netherlands in [[Dutch European Constitution referendum, 2005|their own referendum]] on 1 June 2005. Although it had been ratified by a number of member states, following a "period of reflection", the constitution in that form was scrapped and replaced by the [[Treaty of Lisbon]].

==Related treaties==

Although not formally part of [[European Union law]], several closely related treaties have been signed outside the framework of the EU and its predecessors between the member states because the EU lacked authority to act in the field. After the EU obtained such autonomy, many of these conventions were gradually replaced by EU instruments.

Following on from the success of the [[Treaty of Paris (1951)|Treaty of Paris]], establishing the [[European Coal and Steel Community]], efforts were made to allow West Germany to rearm within the framework of a [[Military of the European Union|common European military structure]]. The Treaty instituting the [[European Defence Community]] was signed by [[Inner Six|the six members]] on 27 May 1952,&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://www.cvce.eu/en/obj/treaty_instituting_the_european_defence_community_paris_27_may_1952-en-2af9ea94-7798-4434-867a-36c4a256d0af.html|title=Treaty instituting the European Defence Community (Paris, 27 May 1952)|accessdate=2017-11-04|publisher=[[Centre virtuel de la connaissance sur l'Europe]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it never entered into force as it was not ratified by France and Italy.&lt;ref name=EDCFRA&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://basedoc.diplomatie.gouv.fr/exl-php/cadcgp.php?CMD=CHERCHE&amp;QUERY=1&amp;MODELE=vues/mae_internet___traites/home.html&amp;VUE=mae_internet___traites|title=TRA19520108|accessdate=2018-05-24|publisher=[[Ministry of Europe and Foreign Affairs]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EDCCVCE&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://www.cvce.eu/en/education/unit-content/-/unit/803b2430-7d1c-4e7b-9101-47415702fc8e/c23dd653-ba51-4f7e-9bf1-2c33b347d339|title=The refusal to ratify the EDC Treaty|accessdate=2018-05-24|publisher=[[CVCE.eu]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://eeas.europa.eu/topics/common-security-and-defence-policy-csdp/5388/shaping-of-a-common-security-and-defence-policy-_en|title=Shaping of a Common Security and Defence Policy|date=2016-07-08|accessdate=2017-11-04|publisher=[[European External Action Service]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EDCEEAS&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_MEMO-17-1517_en.htm|title=Questions and Answers: the Future of European Defence|date=2017-06-07|accessdate=2017-11-04|publisher=[[European External Action Service]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[European Parliament|Common Assembly]] also began drafting a treaty for a [[European Political Community]] to ensure democratic accountability of the new army, but it was abandoned when the Defence Community treaty was rejected.

 The JHA was integrated into the EC structures as the [[area of freedom, security and justice]] with the [[Lisbon Treaty]]'s entry into force in 2009, which has allowed a number of these Conventions to be replaced by EU Regulations or Decisions.

Finally, several treaties have been concluded between a subset of EU member states due to a lack of unanimity. The [[Schengen Treaty]] and Convention of 1985 and 1990 respectively were greed to in this manner, but were subsequently incorporated into EU law by the [[Amsterdam Treaty]] with the remaining EU member states that had not signed the treaty being given an [[Opt-outs in the European Union|opt-out]] from implementing it.&lt;ref name=schengencon/&gt; Others agreements signed as intergovernmental treaties outside the EU legal framework include the [[EU SOFA|EU status of forces agreement]] of 2003,&lt;ref name=EUSOFA&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/documents-publications/treaties-agreements/agreement/?id=2003102&amp;DocLanguage=en|title=Agreement between the Member States of the European Union concerning the status of military and civilian staff seconded to the institutions of the European Union, of the headquarters and forces which may be made available to the European Union in the context of the preparation and execution of the tasks referred to in Article 17(2) of the Treaty on European Union, including exercises, and of the military and civilian staff of the Member States put at the disposal of the European Union to act in this context (EU SOFA)|accessdate=2018-06-14|publisher=Council of the European Union}}&lt;/ref&gt; the EU claims agreement of 2004,&lt;ref name=EUCLAIMS&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/documents-publications/treaties-agreements/agreement/?id=2004024&amp;DocLanguage=en|title=Agreement between the Member States of the European Union concerning claims introduced by each Member State against any other Member State for damage to any property owned, used or operated by it or injury or death suffered by any military or civilian staff of its services, in the context of an EU crisis management operation|accessdate=2018-06-16|publisher=Council of the European Union}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Treaty of Strasbourg]] of 2004 establishing the [[Eurocorps]],&lt;ref name=EUROCORP&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://basedoc.diplomatie.gouv.fr/exl-php/cadcgp.php?CMD=CHERCHE&amp;QUERY=1&amp;MODELE=vues/mae_internet___traites/home.html&amp;VUE=mae_internet___traites|title=TRA20040219|accessdate=2018-05-23|publisher=[[Ministry of Europe and Foreign Affairs]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://treaties.un.org/doc/Publication/UNTS/Volume%202595/v2595.pdf|title=Treaties and international agreements registered or filed and recorded with the Secretariat of the United Nations|date=2009|accessdate=2018-05-23|publisher=[[United Nations]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Treaty of Velsen]] of 2007 establishing the [[European Gendarmerie Force]],&lt;ref&gt;Eurogendfor.org, [http://www.eurogendfor.org/eurogendfor-library/download-area/official-texts/establishing-the-eurogendfor-treaty Treaty establishing the European Gendarmerie Force], accessed on January 24, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=EGF&gt;{{citeweb|url=https://verdragenbank.overheid.nl/en/Treaty/Details/011496.html|title=Treaty between the Kingdom of Spain, the French Republic, the Italian Republic, the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the Portuguese Republic, establishing the European Gendarmerie Force EUROGENDFOR|accessdate=2018-05-23|publisher=Government of the Netherlands}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Prüm Convention]] of 2005 on the fight against terrorism, the Convention on centralised customs clearance of 2009,&lt;ref name=CCCC&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/documents-publications/treaties-agreements/agreement/?id=2009003&amp;DocLanguage=en|title=Convention on centralised customs clearance, concerning the allocation of national collection costs retained when traditional own resources are made available to the EU budget|accessdate=2018-06-16|publisher=Council of the European Union}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Agreement on the protection of classified information of 2011,&lt;ref name=EUCI&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/documents-publications/treaties-agreements/agreement/?id=2009054&amp;DocLanguage=en|title=Agreement between the Member States of the European Union, meeting within the Council, regarding the protection of classified information exchanged in the interests of the European Union|accessdate=2018-06-14|publisher=Council of the European Union}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Treaty Establishing the European Stability Mechanism]] of 2012 establishing the [[European Stability Mechanism]], the [[European Fiscal Compact]] of 2012 on fiscal rules in the [[eurozone]], the [[Agreement on a Unified Patent Court]] of 2013 establishing the [[Unified Patent Court]], and the [[Single Resolution Fund Agreement]] of 2014 establishing the [[Single Resolution Fund]]. However, all these agreements are open to accession by EU member states.  The text of the Prum Convention, Fiscal Compact and Single Resolution Fund Agreement state that the intention of the signatories is to incorporate the treaty's provisions into EU structures and that EU law should take precedence over the treaty. A [[European Stability Mechanism#Treaty basis|TFEU amendment]] was ratified which authorizes the creation of the ESM, giving it a legal basis in the EU treaties.

An updated [[Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union#Second EMU reform plan (2015-25)|EMU reform plan]] issued in June 2015 by the five presidents of the Council, European Commission, ECB, Eurogroup and European Parliament outlined a roadmap for integrating the Fiscal Compact and Single Resolution Fund agreement into the framework of EU law by June 2017, and the intergovernmental European Stability Mechanism by 2025.&lt;ref name="Completing the EMU"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/european-council/president/pdf/5-presidents-report-en_pdf/|title=Completing Europe's Economic and Monetary Union: Report by Jean-Claude Juncker in close cooperation with Donald Tusk, Jeroen Dijsselbloem, Mario Draghi and Martin Schulz|format=PDF|publisher=European Commission|date=21 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Proposals by the [[European Commission]] to incorporate the substance of the Fiscal Compact into EU law and create a [[European Monetary Fund]] to replace the ESM were published in December 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52017PC0824|title=Proposal for a COUNCIL DIRECTIVE laying down provisions for strengthening fiscal responsibility and the medium-term budgetary orientation in the Member States|date=2017-12-06|accessdate=2017-12-29|publisher=[[European Union]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A52017PC0827|title=Proposal for a COUNCIL REGULATION on the establishment of the European Monetary Fund|date=2017-12-06|accessdate=2018-01-29|publisher=[[European Union]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cherokeenation1830map.jpg|right|thumb|350px|Cherokee territory in northern Georgia, 1830]]
The '''Treaty of New Echota''' (7 Stat. 488) was a treaty signed on December 29, 1835, in [[New Echota]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] by officials of the [[United States]] government and representatives of a minority [[Cherokee]] political faction, the Treaty Party.&lt;ref&gt;Starr, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt;

The treaty established terms under which the entire Cherokee Nation ceded its territory in the southeast and agreed to [[Indian Removal|move west]] to the [[Indian Territory]]. Although the treaty was not approved by the Cherokee National Council nor signed by Principal Chief [[John Ross (Cherokee chief)|John Ross]], it was amended and ratified by the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] in March 1836, and became the legal basis for the forcible removal known as the [[Cherokee trail of tears|Trail of Tears]].

== Background ==

=== Early discussions ===
By the late 1720's, the territory of the Cherokee Indian nation lay almost entirely in northwestern Georgia, with small parts in [[Tennessee]], [[Alabama]], and [[North Carolina]]. It extended across most of the northern border and all of the border with Tennessee. An estimated 16,000 Cherokee people lived in this territory.  Others had emigrated west to present-day [[Texas]] and [[Arkansas]]. In 1826, the Georgia legislature asked President [[John Quincy Adams]] to negotiate a removal treaty.

Adams, a supporter of Indian [[sovereignty]], initially refused, but when Georgia threatened to [[Nullification (U.S. Constitution)|nullify]] the current treaty, he approached the Cherokee to negotiate. A year passed without any progress toward removal. [[Andrew Jackson]], a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] and supporter of Indian removal, was elected president in [[United States presidential election, 1828|1828]].&lt;ref name="williams"&gt;{{cite book|first=David|last=Williams|year=1995|title=The Georgia Gold Rush|isbn=1-57003-052-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Georgia laws over Cherokee Indian territory ===
Shortly after the 1828 election, Georgia acted on its nullification threat. The legislature passed a series of laws abolishing the independent government of the Cherokee and extending state law over their territory. Cherokee officials were forbidden to meet for legislative purposes. White people (including [[missionaries]] and those married to Cherokee) were forbidden to live in Cherokee country without a state permit, and Cherokee were forbidden to testify in court cases involving European Americans.&lt;ref name="perdue"&gt;{{cite book|first=Theda|last=Perdue|author2=Michael D. Green |year=2004|title=The Cherokee Removal: A Brief History with Documents|isbn=0-312-08658-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after his inauguration, Jackson wrote an [[open letter]] to the Southeastern Indian nations, urging them to move west.  After [[gold]] was discovered in Georgia in late 1829, the ensuing [[Georgia Gold Rush]] increased white residents' determination to see the Cherokee removed.&lt;ref name="williams" /&gt; The Cherokee were forbidden to dig for gold, and Georgia authorized a survey of their lands to prepare for a lottery to distribute the land to whites. The state held the lottery in 1832.

In the following session, the state legislature stripped the Cherokee of all land other than their residences and adjoining improvements. By 1834 this exception was also removed. When state judges intervened on behalf of Cherokee residents, they were harassed and denied jurisdiction over such cases.&lt;ref name="perdue" /&gt;

=== Cherokee reaction ===
The new laws targeted the Cherokee leadership in particular.  The hereditary chiefs were selected from men who belonged to the important clans of the matrilineal culture. They gained their status from their Cherokee mothers and their clans, although by this time, there were several of mixed race. Principal Chief John Ross was also of mixed race, and had tried to make use of his heritage to benefit the Cherokee in relations with whites. Since the Georgia laws made it illegal for the Cherokee to conduct national business, the National Council (the legislative body of the Cherokee Nation) cancelled the 1832 elections. It declared that current officials would retain their offices until elections could be held, and established an emergency government based in Tennessee.

The Council tried to force Jackson's hand against Georgia by suing the state in federal courts and lobbying Congress to support Cherokee sovereignty.&lt;ref name="perdue" /&gt; In 1832, the [[United States Supreme Court]] struck down Georgia's laws as unconstitutional in ''[[Worcester v. Georgia]]'', ruling that only the Federal government had power to deal with the Native American tribes, and the states no had power to pass legislation regulating their activities. However, the state ignored the ruling and continued to enforce the laws.&lt;ref name="wilkins"&gt;{{cite book|first=Thurman|last=Wilkins|year=1986|title=The Cherokee Tragedy: The Ridge Family and the Decimation of a People|isbn=0-585-19424-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Negotiations ==
[[File:JohnRidgeCherokee.jpg|right|thumb|John Ridge]]

=== Jackson's initial proposal ===
Shortly after the Supreme Court's ruling, Jackson met with [[John Ridge]], clerk of the Cherokee National Council, who headed a Cherokee delegation that went to [[Washington, DC]] to meet with him. When asked whether he would use federal force against Georgia, Jackson said he would not and urged Ridge to persuade the Cherokee to accept removal. Ridge, until then a supporter of the National Council's position, left the White House in despair. [[John McLean]], a Jackson appointee to the Supreme Court, likewise urged the Cherokee representatives in Washington to negotiate.&lt;ref name="wilkins" /&gt;

Jackson quickly dispatched [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Lewis Cass]] to present his terms, which included western land titles, self-government, relocation assistance, and several other long-term benefits—all conditioned on a total Cherokee removal. He would allow a small number of Cherokee to stay if they accepted state authority over them.&lt;ref name="wilkins" /&gt;

In the following months, Ridge found supporters for the removal option, including his father [[Major Ridge]] and the major's nephews [[Elias Boudinot (Cherokee)|Elias Boudinot]] and [[Stand Watie]]. In October 1832, he urged the National Council to consider Cass's proposal, but the Council was unmoved.&lt;ref name="wilkins" /&gt;

=== Divisions among the Cherokee ===
While Ross's delegation continued to lobby Congress for relief, the worsening situation in Georgia drove members of the Treaty Party to Washington to press for a removal treaty. Boudinot and the Ridges had come to believe that removal was inevitable, and hoped to secure Cherokee rights by agreeing to a treaty.  In December 1833, the Cherokees supporting removal formed a party, with the former principal chief [[William Hicks (Cherokee chief)|William Hicks]] as their head and John McIntosh as his assistant.  They sent a delegation led by Andrew Ross, younger brother of Principal Chief John Ross. The administration refused to deal with them, but invited them to return with leaders more involved in the Cherokee Nation's affairs. They returned with Boudinot and Major Ridge, and entered negotiations with Cass.&lt;ref name="wilkins" /&gt;

When Cass urged John Ross to join the negotiations, he denounced his brother's delegation.&lt;ref name="royce"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Charles|last=Royce|year=1884|title=The Cherokee Nation of Indians|journal=Annual Report of the Bureau of Ethnology}}&lt;/ref&gt; Andrew Ross and other members signed a harsh treaty in June 1834 without the Ridge family's support.&lt;ref name="logan"&gt;{{cite web|first=Charles Russell|last=Logan|year=1997|title=The Promised Land: The Cherokees, Arkansas, and Removal, 1794–1839|publisher=Arkansas Historic Preservation Program|url=https://www.arkansaspreservation.com/LiteratureRetrieve.aspx?ID=133283}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The progress of separate negotiations finally moved John Ross to discuss terms. He made offers to cede all land except the borders of Georgia, and then to cede all land, on the condition that the Cherokee could remain in the east subject to state laws. Cass refused, saying that he would discuss only removal. Andrew Ross's treaty was submitted to the Senate, where it was rejected as not having the support of all Cherokees.&lt;ref name="perdue" /&gt; In the October meeting of the Cherokee General Council (comprising all members of the Nation able to attend), a federal representative presented this treaty for consideration. John Ross condemned the treaty. The Ridges and the Waties left the Council, and they and other treaty advocates began holding their own council meetings.

== Division of the Cherokee Nation East ==
A division developed between Ross supporters (the "National Party") advocating resistance, and the Ridge supporters (the "Treaty Party"), who advocated negotiation to secure the best terms possible for the removal, which they considered inevitable, and later protection of Cherokee rights. The Treaty Party included John Ridge, Major Ridge, Elias Boudinot, David Watie, Stand Watie, Andrew Ross, Willam Coody (Ross's nephew), William Hicks (Ross's cousin), John Walker Jr., John Fields, John Gunter, [[David Vann (Cherokee leader)|David Vann]], Charles Vann, Alexander McCoy, W. A. Davis, James A. Bell, Samuel Bell, John West, Ezekiel West, Archilla Smith, and James Starr.&lt;ref name="wilkins" /&gt;

Eventually tensions grew to the point that several Treaty advocates, most notably John Walker Jr., were assassinated.  In July 1835, hundreds of Cherokee, from both the Treaty Party and the National Party (including John Ross), converged on John Ridge’s plantation, Running Waters (near [[Calhoun, Georgia]]). There they met with [[John F. Schermerhorn]], President Jackson's envoy for a removal treaty, Return J. Meigs, Jr., the Commissioner for Indian Affairs, and other U.S. officials.&lt;ref name="wilkins" /&gt;

In October 1835, the General Council rejected the proposed treaty, but appointed a committee to go to Washington to negotiate a better treaty. The committee included John Ross, and also treaty advocates John Ridge, Charles Vann, and Elias Boudinot (later replaced by Stand Watie). They were authorized to make a removal treaty, with the stipulation that the Cherokees would receive more than $5,000,000 in compensation and assistance. Schermerhorn, who was present at the meeting, advocated a meeting at [[New Echota]], the Cherokee capital. The National Council approved a delegation to meet there.&lt;ref name="wilkins" /&gt; Both delegations (U.S. and Cherokee) were specifically charged with negotiating a removal treaty.

=== New Echota Meeting and Final Treaty ===
100 to 500 men converged on the Cherokee capital in December 1835, almost exclusively from the Upper and Lower Towns. (Heavy snow in the western North Carolina mountains made it nearly impossible for those from the Hill and Valley Towns to travel.)  After a week of negotiations, Schermerhorn proposed that in exchange for all Cherokee land east of the [[Mississippi River]], the Cherokees would receive $5,000,000 from the U.S. (to be distributed ''per capita'' to all members of the tribe), an additional $500,000 for educational funds, title in perpetuity to land in [[Indian Territory]] equal to that given up, and full compensation for all property left behind.&lt;ref name="wilkins" /&gt; (By contrast, the entire [[Louisiana Territory]] was purchased from [[Napoleon]] for just over $23,000,000.) The treaty included a clause to allow all Cherokees who so desired to remain and become citizens of the states in which they resided, on individual allotments of {{convert|160|acre|km2}} of land. With that clause, it was unanimously approved by the contingent at New Echota, then signed by the negotiating committee of twenty, But that clause was struck out by President Jackson.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, p. 498-499&lt;/ref&gt;

The committee reported the results to the full Council gathered at New Echota, which approved the treaty unanimously. In a lengthy preamble, the Ridge party laid out its claims to legitimacy, based on its willingness to negotiate in good faith the sort of removal terms for which Ross had expressed support.  The treaty was signed by Major Ridge, Elias Boudinot, James Foster, Testaesky, Charles Moore, George Chambers, Tahyeske, Archilla Smith, Andrew Ross, William Lassley, Caetehee, Tegaheske, Robert Rogers, John Gunter, John A. Bell, Charles Foreman, William Rogers, George W. Adair, [[Tom Starr|James Starr]], and Jesse Halfbreed. After Schermerhorn returned to Washington with the signed treaty, John Ridge and Stand Watie added their names.&lt;ref name="wilkins" /&gt;

The treaty was concluded at New Echota, Georgia on the 29th of December, 1835 and signed on the 1st of March, 1836.&lt;ref name="TreatyText"&gt;{{cite web|title=Treaty of New Echota|url=http://www.cherokee.org/AboutTheNation/History/TrailofTears/TreatyofNewEchota.aspx|website=www.cherokee.org|publisher=Cherokee Nation|accessdate=May 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ratification ==
{{Wikisource|Appeal of the Cherokee Nation}}
After news of the treaty became public, the officials of the Cherokee Nation from the National Party representing the large majority of Cherokee objected that they had not approved it and that the document was invalid. John Ross and the Cherokee National Council begged the Senate not to ratify the treaty (and thereby invalidate it) due to it not being negotiated by the legal representatives of the Cherokee Nation. But the Senate passed the measure in May 1836 by a single vote. Ross drew up a petition asking Congress to void the treaty—a petition which he personally delivered to Congress in the spring of 1838 with almost 16,000 signatures attached. This was nearly as many persons as the Cherokee Nation East had within its territory, according to the 1835 Henderson Roll, including women and children, who had no vote.

== Enforcement ==
{{Main|Cherokee trail of tears}}
Ross's petition was ignored by President [[Martin Van Buren]], who directed General [[Winfield Scott]] to forcibly move all those Cherokee who had not yet complied with the treaty and moved west. The Cherokee people were almost entirely removed west of the Mississippi (except for the Oconaluftee Cherokee in North Carolina, the Nantahala Cherokee who joined them, and two or three hundred married to whites).

That summer (1839) a council to effect a union between the Old Settlers and the Late Immigrants convened at Double Springs in Indian Territory. It broke up sixteen days later without having reached an agreement when John Brown, Principal Chief of the Cherokee Nation West, became frustrated with Ross's intransigence.  The latter insisted that the Old Settlers accept him as Principal Chief over the united Nation without an election and recognize his absolute authority.  Ross was easily elected in the following years elections.

Ross’s partisans blamed Brown’s actions on the Treaty Party, particularly those, such as the Ridge and Watie families, who had emigrated prior to the forced removal. They had settled with the Old Settlers.  A group of these men targeted members of the Ridge faction for assassination, to enforce the Cherokee law (written by Major Ridge) making it a capital crime for any Cherokee to cede national land for private profit.&lt;ref name="wilkins" /&gt;  There is no evidence that John Ross supported or knew of their plans.

The list of targets included Major Ridge, John Ridge, Elias Boudinot, [[Stand Watie]], John A. Bell, James Starr, George Adair, and others. (Notably absent from the list were Treaty Party leaders David Vann, Charles Vann, John Gunter, Charles Foreman, William Hicks, and Andrew Ross.  William Hicks died sometime before or in the year 1837.  His death was before removal took place.) On 22 June 1839, teams ranging up to twenty-five in number converged on the houses of John Ridge, Major Ridge, and Elias Boudinot, and murdered them; their attempt on Stand Watie was unsuccessful.&lt;ref name="wilkins" /&gt; They did not attack any others, but the assassinations marked the beginning of the Cherokee Civil War; it continued until after the American Civil War. James Starr was also killed during this period. The Ross partisans forced the Old Settlers to give up their established political system and accept the majority vote and John Ross's authority. Ridge Party families fled Oklahoma and found refuge at Mount Tabor Texas near present-day Kilgore, Texas. Many of their descendants still live in the area along with the Thompson-McCoy Choctaws.

'''Venero Frank "Benny Eggs" Mangano''' (September 7, 1921 – August 18, 2017) was the [[underboss]] of the [[Genovese crime family]]. Since boss [[Daniel Leo (mobster)|Daniel "Danny the Lion" Leo]] was imprisoned in 2007, Mangano was the family's senior leader outside prison. The nickname "Benny Eggs" came from his mother running an egg farm. He was released from prison on November 2, 2006, after serving a 15-year sentence for [[extortion]].

==Business interests==
Venero Mangano was related to [[Gambino crime family]] boss [[Vincent Mangano]] (1888–1951), [[Philip Mangano]], [[Lawrence Mangano]] and Anthony Mangano. Venero Mangano was listed as a [[caporegime]] twice by the [[New Jersey Division of Gaming Enforcement]] in a 1987 exclusion order.

Mangano was for several years an independent [[wholesaler]] and the head of a surplus stock distribution company; one of his prominent customers was [[Calvin Klein]].  During this time, Venero even became friends with Klein's business partner, [[Barry K. Schwartz]].

During [[World War II]], Mangano served as a bomber [[tail gunner]] with the [[United States Army Air Corps]] in Europe. In recognition of his service, the Army decorated Mangano with a [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] and an [[Air Medal]] with four [[Oak leaf cluster|Oak Leaf Clusters]] and three [[Service star|Battle Stars]].&lt;ref name="Capeci"&gt;[http://www.nysun.com/article/40123 NY Sun.com; Rough Prison Treatment for a Fragile Benny Eggs] by Jerry Capeci&lt;/ref&gt;

In later years, Mangano joined a crew in [[Greenwich Village]] that would later belong to [[Vincent Gigante|Vincent "The Chin" Gigante]]. Mangano oversaw his businesses out of a [[social club]] at 110 [[Thompson Street (Manhattan)|Thompson Street]].  These operations included an immensely profitable monopoly on window replacement in the [[New York City metropolitan area]].

===Convictions prior to 1991===
As a member of the Genovese crime family, Mangano had a notable criminal record;
* October 7, 1946 - [[Bookmaking]] - $50 fine
* May 15, 1947 - Bookmaking - $200 fine
* October 8, 1950 - Bookmaking - $200 fine and 60 days imprisonment
* February 21, 1961 - Bookmaking - $250 fine and 90 days imprisonment
* August 6, 1981 - [[Contempt of court|Civil contempt]] for refusing to testify once granted immunity - incarcerated from August 18, 1981 to April 22, 1982.

===1991 Windows Case===
From 1978 to 1990, four of the [[Five Families|five crime families of New York]] formed a [[cartel]] of window replacement companies. Each family assigned one or more men to control their share in the cartel (''as shown below'').
*[[Lucchese crime family]] - [[Victor Amuso|Vittorio Amuso]], [[Anthony Casso]] and [[Peter Chiodo]] - had the largest share in the window racket.
*[[Genovese crime family]] - Venero Mangano, [[Gerard Pappa]] (deceased) and Peter Savino (associate)
*[[Gambino crime family]] - [[Peter Gotti]]
*[[Colombo crime family]] - [[Benedetto Aloi|Benedetto "Benny" Aloi]]

The cartel eventually controlled over $150 million in contracts from the [[New York City Housing Authority]] (NYCHA).  The cartel monopolized the industry through Local 580, a Lucchese family-controlled local of the [[International Association of Bridge, Structural, Ornamental and Reinforcing Iron Workers|Iron Workers Union]].  Through the union, the cartel could [[bribery|solicit bribes]], [[extortion|extort payoffs]] and enforce its monopoly. The cartel worked their controlled industry by charging a tax of approximately $1.00 to $2.00 for almost every window replacement, public and private, sold in [[New York City]].&lt;ref name="windows jury"&gt;{{cite news|last=Lubasch|first=Arnold H.|title=Windows Jury Finds 3 Guilty And Acquits 5|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/10/19/nyregion/windows-jury-finds-3-guilty-and-acquits-5.html?n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fSubjects%2fW%2fWindows|accessdate=29 April 2012|newspaper=New York Times|date=October 19, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2 men"&gt;{{cite news|title=2 Men Sentenced In 'Windows Trial'|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/03/28/nyregion/2-men-sentenced-in-windows-trial.html?n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fSubjects%2fW%2fWindows|accessdate=29 April 2012|newspaper=New York Times|date=March 28, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indictment==

By 1990, law enforcement had crushed the window replacement cartel. It started in 1988, when prosecutors  persuaded cartel member Savino to become an informant and wear a wire. It was Savino's information over a two-year period that led to the indictments.

The sweep of indictments was wide. In 1990, [[Peter Gotti]] was tried and acquitted; Mangano, Aloi, and Colombo crime family soldier Dennis DeLucia were convicted. Sentencing guidelines should have seen Venero and Aloi get three-year sentences, but both men received more than 15 years each (Mangano - 188 months, Aloi - 200 months).

Nearly all the members of the Local 580 were indicted on charges ranging from bid rigging to extortion. Gigante was indicted but found [[Competence (law)|mentally unfit]] to stand trial; he was later convicted in 1997. Amuso and Casso went into hiding, appointing [[Alphonse D'Arco]] as acting boss of the Lucchese family on January 9, 1991. In 1992, Amuso was captured and later convicted in a superseding indictment that included the "Windows Case" charges. In 1993, Casso was captured, took a [[plea bargain]], and started cooperation with authorities himself. Chiodo pleaded guilty after an assassination attempt and admitted killing potential witness John Morrissey, a business agent for Local 580.

==After the Windows Case==
In 1997, while still in prison, Mangano was called to testify against boss Gigante. He refused to testify, saying, "What do you want to do, shoot me?" and "Shoot me, but I'm not going to answer any questions".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1997/07/19/nyregion/a-jailed-mobster-refuses-to-testify-in-mafia-case.html A Jailed Mobster Refuses To Testify in Mafia Case] By Joseph P. Fried, July 19, 1997. New York Times&lt;/ref&gt; He later took the witness stand, but refused to answer any questions, invoking his [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] rights. Mangano tried several times to get a new sentencing or hearing, but to no avail. On November 2, 2006, Mangano was released from prison. The future was uncertain for Mangano and he was fortunate to have lived out his sentence. While in prison, he survived two heart attacks and three emergency heart operations. Upon Mangano's release, it was speculated that he would become the boss of the Genovese family, but there is no evidence that this happened. His post-prison life involvement in organized crime is unknown, as he was partially blind and confined to a wheelchair. He died of natural causes in 2017.

'''''Wal-Mart v. Dukes''''', 564 U.S. 338 (2011), was a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case. The case was an appeal from the Ninth Circuit's decision in '''''Dukes v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc.''''' in which the Supreme Court, by a 5-4 decision, reversed the district court's decision to certify a [[class action]] lawsuit in which the plaintiff class included 1.6 million women who currently work or have worked for Walmart stores, including the lead plaintiff, Betty Dukes. Dukes, a current Walmart employee, and others alleged gender discrimination in pay and promotion policies and practices in Walmart stores.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aauw.org/media/pressreleases/walmartwmn_032811.cfm AAUW Stands with the Women of Wal-Mart During U.S. Supreme Court Hearing], American Association of University Women.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Court agreed to hear argument on whether [[Federal Rule of Civil Procedure]], Rule 23(b)(2), which provides for class-actions if the defendant's actions make [[injunction|injunctive relief]] appropriate, can be used to file a class action that demands [[damages|monetary damages]]. The Court also asked the parties to argue whether the class meets the [[Class action#U.S. federal class actions|traditional requirements]] of numerosity, commonality, typicality, and adequacy of representation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.supremecourt.gov/qp/10-00277qp.pdf 10-277 Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. v. Dukes, Questions Presented], Supreme Court of the United States.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Supreme Court ruled unanimously that the class should not be certified in its current form but was only 5-4 on why so and whether the class could continue in a different form.

== Background ==
In 2000, Betty Dukes, a 54-year-old Walmart worker in [[California]], claimed sex discrimination. Despite six years of work and positive performance reviews, she was denied the training she needed to advance to a higher salaried position. Walmart argued that Dukes clashed with a female Walmart supervisor and was disciplined for admittedly returning late from lunch breaks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.city-journal.org/html/eon_06_24_04sm.html|title=The Tort Plague Hits Wal-Mart|last=Malanga|first=Steven|work=[[City Journal (New York)|City Journal]]|accessdate=2009-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2001, the lawsuit began in [[US District Court]] in [[San Francisco]]. The plaintiffs sought to represent 1.6 million women, including women who were currently working or who had previously worked in a Walmart store since December 26, 1998.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/104169/000010416905000019/wmt10q_q3fy2006.htm Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. Form 10-Q for the Quarterly Period Ended October 31, 2005&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Federal District Court==
In June 2004, the federal district judge, [[Martin Jenkins]], ruled in favor of class certification under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 23(b)(2).&lt;ref&gt;https://walmart.walmartclass.com/staticdata/walmartclass/classcert.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Walmart appealed the decision.

==Court of Appeals==
On February 6, 2007, a three-judge panel of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|Ninth Circuit]] affirmed the district court's class certification. Judge [[Harry Pregerson]] wrote for the majority, which also included Judge [[Michael Daly Hawkins]]. Judge [[Andrew J. Kleinfeld]] dissented and criticized the majority's view of the class certification standards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.walmartclass.com/staticdata/pleadings/9th%20cir.pdf Original opinion, February 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

Walmart promptly filed for a rehearing and a rehearing ''[[en banc]]'', contending that the majority committed legal error with regard to whether the grounds for class action certification had been met.

On December 11, 2007, the same Ninth Circuit panel withdrew its initial opinion and issued a subsequent, superseding opinion, which still permitted the class certification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Dukes v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. |vol=509 |reporter=F.3d |opinion=1168 |pinpoint= |court=9th Cir. |date=2007 |url=https://www.leagle.com/decision/20071677509f3d116811656 |accessdate=2018-11-17 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The panel dismissed the original petition for rehearing as moot in light of its superseding opinion, on the grounds that the revised opinion addresses the legal errors claimed in the petition, but Walmart was permitted to refile its petition. Among other changes to its original opinion, the Ninth Circuit altered its opinion with respect to the admissibility of expert testimony and the use of [[Daubert]] challenges during a motion for class certification. Walmart again filed for a rehearing en banc.

On February 13, 2009, the Ninth Circuit granted Walmart's petition for rehearing en banc on the class action certification.&lt;ref&gt;Karen Gullo &amp; Margaret Cronin Fisk, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/02/14/AR2009021400071.html Wal-Mart Wins Request in Bias Case], [[Washington Post]], Feb. 14, 2009, p. D-2.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the December 2007 Ninth Circuit opinion was no longer effective.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/opinions/2009/02/13/0416688ebo.pdf Order for Rehearing En Banc]&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 24, 2009 a panel of eleven Ninth Circuit judges, led by Chief Judge [[Alex Kozinski]], heard oral arguments for the En Banc appeal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ca9.uscourts.gov/media/view_subpage.php?pk_id=0000003051 (audio of the en banc hearing)]&lt;/ref&gt; On April 26, 2010, the en banc court affirmed the district court's class certification on a 6-5 vote, with Judge [[Michael Daly Hawkins]] writing for the majority and Judge [[Sandra Segal Ikuta]] writing for the dissent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Dukes v. Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. |vol=603 |reporter=F.3d |opinion=571 |pinpoint= |court=9th Cir. |date=2010 |url=https://www.leagle.com/decision/infco20100426126 |accessdate=2018-11-17 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Walmart's lead appellate counsel, [[Theodore Boutrous, Jr.]], said in a statement that the decision violates "both due process and federal class action rules, contradicting numerous decisions of other federal appellate courts and the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] itself" and indicated that Walmart would appeal to the Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Tresa Baldas |url=http://www.law.com/jsp/nlj/PubArticleNLJ.jsp?id=1202453222347&amp;WalMart_yells_Supreme_Court_after_th_Circuit_certifies_largest_civil_class_action_ever&amp;hbxlogin=1 |title=Wal-Mart yells 'Supreme Court' after 9th Circuit certifies largest civil class action ever |publisher=Law.com |date=2010-04-26 |accessdate=2011-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plaintiffs' counsel argued that "Wal-Mart is attempting to dismantle the Supreme Court's employment discrimination class action jurisprudence [that] would require the Court to overrule 45 years of civil rights and class action precedent."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/wal-mart-sex-discrimination-class-action-plaintiffs-urge-supreme-court-to-uphold-historic-civil-rights-and-workers-laws-in-brief-filed-today-116669074.html |title=Wal-Mart Sex Discrimination Class Action Plaintiffs Urge Supreme Court To Uphold Historic Civil Rights and Workers Laws in Brief Filed Today |location=District of Columbia |publisher=Prnewswire.com |date=2011-02-22 |accessdate=2011-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Supreme Court Decision==
On December 6, 2009, the Supreme Court agreed to hear Walmart's appeal as ''Wal-Mart v. Dukes''.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.supremecourt.gov/Search.aspx?FileName=/docketfiles/10-277.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Oral argument for the case occurred on March 29, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_calendars/monthlyargumentcalmarch2011.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.supremecourt.gov/oral_arguments/argument_transcripts/10-277.pdf |title=10-277.exe |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2011-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 20, 2011, the Supreme Court ruled in Walmart's favor by saying the plaintiffs did not have enough in common to constitute a class.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/10pdf/10-277.pdf SCOTUS decision, June 20, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Daniel Fisher |url=https://blogs.forbes.com/danielfisher/2011/06/20/supreme-court-dumps-wal-mart-sex-discrimination-class-action/ |title=Supreme Court Dumps Wal-Mart Sex-Discrimination Class Action |publisher=Blogs.forbes.com |date=2011-06-20 |accessdate=2011-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Court ruled unanimously that because of the variability of plaintiffs' circumstances, the class action could not proceed as comprised.

The Court ruled 5-4 that it could not proceed as any kind of class action suit.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.salon.com/news/feature/2011/06/20/supreme_court_sides_with_wal_mart/&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of the opinion allege that the decision makes it incredibly difficult to certify a class without a prohibitive amount of work on the part of plaintiff attorneys. The requirement to look through the class to the merits requires an immense amount of discovery, which was not previously required.
