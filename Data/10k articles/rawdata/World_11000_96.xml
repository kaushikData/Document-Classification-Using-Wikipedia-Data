'''ARSAT-1''' is a [[geostationary orbit|geostationary]] [[communications satellite]] operated by [[AR-SAT]] and built by the [[Argentina|Argentine]] company [[INVAP]].&lt;ref name=invap-2015arsatsats /&gt; ARSAT-1 was launched into orbit on October 16, 2014 from French Guiana alongside Intelsat-30 satellite using an Ariane 5 rocket.&lt;ref name=conae-2014vex1b /&gt;&lt;ref name=rapidtvnews-2014090135101 /&gt; It is expected to be located at 72° West [[longitude]] geostationary slot. ARSAT-1 is the first geostationary satellite built in [[Latin America]]. Total cost of the satellite is 270 millon US dollars.&lt;ref name=clarin-1231076942 /&gt;

ARSAT-1 carries a total of 24 IEEE K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; band (NATO J-band) transponders. Twelve will be operating at 36&amp;nbsp;MHz, eight at 54&amp;nbsp;MHz and four at 72&amp;nbsp;MHz, for a total bandwidth of 1152&amp;nbsp;MHz.&lt;ref name=aerospacetech-arsat1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=nsf-20141006arsat1 /&gt; It will offer a wide range of telecommunications, data transmission, telephone and television services mainly across all of [[Argentina]], [[Chile]], [[Uruguay]] and [[Paraguay]] including [[Satellite television|direct broadcast TV]] in the [[ISDB#ISDB-S|ISDB-S]] standard.&lt;ref name=pag12-20140401243125 /&gt;&lt;ref name=arianspace-pr20100628 /&gt;

==Description==
The ARSAT-1 is the first flight model of the [[ARSAT-3K]] [[satellite bus]] developed by [[INVAP]] for [[ARSAT|ARSAT S.A.]].&lt;ref name=arsat-pr20150520 /&gt; It is a small (around {{convert|3|tonne|abbr=on}} at launch) platform with a {{convert|350|kg|lb|abbr=on}} maximum payload mass and 3.5&amp;nbsp;kW of payload power consumption at the satellite end of life. It uses an integrated [[Liquid-propellant rocket|chemical propulsion]] system supplied by [[Airbus Defence and Space|EADS Astrium]] for both [[Orbital maneuver|orbit raising]] and [[Orbital station-keeping|station keeping]].&lt;ref name=arsat-pr20150520 /&gt;

The satellite uses a [[Ku band|K&lt;sub&gt;u&lt;/sub&gt; band]] communication payload which was supplied by [[Thales Alenia Space]]. It is a composed of twelve 36&amp;nbsp;MHz [[transponder]]s, eight of 54&amp;nbsp;MHz and four of 72&amp;nbsp;MHz, for a total bandwidth of 1152&amp;nbsp;MHz or 32 [[transponder equivalent|TPE]].&lt;ref name=nsf-20141006arsat1 /&gt;

==History==
On April 26, 2006, the Argentine Federal Law 26.092 created [[ARSAT|ARSAT S.A.]]. By section 8 of said law the company is given the right to exploit the 81° West [[Geostationary orbit|orbital slot]]. By Section 4 of the company's constitution, it is mandated to build in the country and operate a communication satellite.&lt;ref name=arglaw-ln26092 /&gt; By the Decree 626/2007 of the National Communications Commission published on May 30, 2007, the rights to the 71.8° West orbital slot is transferred from [[Nahuel 1A|Nahuelsat]] to ARSAT S.A.&lt;ref name=arglaw-decpres2009626 /&gt; On August 28, 2008, ARSAT S.A. signs the order for the ARSAT-1 satellite with [[INVAP]].&lt;ref name=arsat-pr20080828 /&gt; On December 10, 2008, INVAP and ARSAT S.A. successfully performed the [[Design review (U.S. government)#)#Preliminary Design Review .28PDR.29|Preliminary Design Review]] for the satellite design.&lt;ref name=arsat-pr20081012 /&gt;

On September 8, 2009 ARSAT announced that [[Thales Alenia Space]] had been selected to supply the communication payload of the satellite and that [[Astrium]] would supply the hardware for the onboard computer, the central cylinder and some of the propulsion subsystems.&lt;ref name=arsat-pr20090908 /&gt; On September 8, 2010, [[Honeywell Aerospace|Honeywell]] announces that it had received a $2.4 million order to supply the [[reaction wheel]]s and the [[Miniature inertial measurement unit|MIMU]] for the satellite.&lt;ref name=honeywell-pr20100908 /&gt;

In April 2010, ARSAT announced that [[Arianespace]] would launch ARSAT-1 from the [[Guiana Space Centre]].&lt;ref name=arsat-pr201004 /&gt; On February 21, 2013 the mating of the [[ARSAT-3K]] [[satellite bus]] and the payload module was successfully completed.&lt;ref name=arsat-pr20130221 /&gt;

In October 2013 the [[Environmental tests|environmental testing]] campaign was started with the month long [[thermal vacuum chamber]] tests. It went through a series of mass properties measures before going into the vibration testing in January.&lt;ref name=ceatsa-pr20140707 /&gt; On February 10, 2014, ARSAT-1 successfully passed the vibration environment simulation on the CEATSA [[Shaker (testing device)|shaker]]. It then performed a series of [[Environmental noise|sound environment]] simulations that assured that the satellite would survive the launch environment.&lt;ref name=telam-51202 /&gt;

It later went through an [[electromagnetic compatibility]] testing and later the communication payload [[Emission spectrum|radio emission]] properties were tested to certify that it adhered to the specification.&lt;ref name=ceatsa-pr20140707 /&gt; On July 7, 2014, it was announced that the satellite had passed all tests and was ready for packaging and transport.&lt;ref name=diariobae-23432 /&gt;

On April 1, 2014, the [[insurance policy]] for both ARSAT-1 and [[ARSAT-2]] was signed between ARSAT S.A. and the national bank insurance company. It was an innovative policy which included two satellites and covered the whole expected life, instead of the usual launch plus first year of operations. It enabled ARSAT to achieve substantially lower costs than what they could otherwise get for an unflown design.&lt;ref name=arsat-pr20140401 /&gt;

Between August 11 and 12, 2014, the satellite was packaged within its [[container]].&lt;ref name=arsat-pr20140813 /&gt; And on August 31, it was loaded on an [[Antonov An-124 Ruslan|AN-124]] which transported it to [[Kourou]], on [[French Guiana]].&lt;ref name=arsat-pr20140901 /&gt; On September 22, it finished the Launch System Electric Performance Test and was ready for integration with the [[Ariane-5]] launcher.&lt;ref name=arsat-pr20140923 /&gt; On October 9, the satellite was mated in the lower berth of the launch vehicle.&lt;ref name=arsat-pr20141009 /&gt;&lt;ref name=telam-81118 /&gt;

On October 16, 2014 at 21:43:52hs UTC, ARSAT-1 was successfully launched from the [[Guiana Space Centre]] [[ELA-3]] by an Ariane-5ECA on its VA220 flight.&lt;ref name=arsat-pr20141016 /&gt; It flew along the [[Intelsat 30]] which rode on the top berth of the fairing.&lt;ref name=telam-81710 /&gt; Two days later, on October 18, it performed the first of five orbital maneuvers using its {{convert|400|N|abbr=on}} [[Liquid Apogee Engine|LAE]] to increase the [[perigee]] to {{convert|4654|km|abbr=on}} and reduced the [[Orbital inclination|inclination]] to 3.5°.&lt;ref name=arsat-pr20141018 /&gt;&lt;ref name=arsat-pr20141021 /&gt; On October 20 it performed the second orbital maneuver increasing its perigee to {{convert|14050|km|abbr=on}} while reducing the inclination to 1.52°.&lt;ref name=arsat-pr20141020 /&gt;&lt;ref name=arsat-pr20141021 /&gt; On October 22 the third maneuver increased the perigee to {{convert|29000|km|abbr=on}} and reduced the inclination to less than 1°.&lt;ref name=arsat-pr20141021 /&gt;&lt;ref name=arsat-pr20141022 /&gt; On October 24 and 25 it performed the fourth and fifth maneuvers finally reaching the [[geostationary orbit]].&lt;ref name=arsat-pr20141025 /&gt;&lt;ref name=arsat-pr20141103 /&gt;

On October 27 the LAE was disabled to prevent inadvertent ignitions. All further maneuvering would be done with [[Rocket engine|thrusters]]. Next day the solar panels were fully deployed and latched, as well as the deployable antenna. The satellite was also put into ''Earth Attitude Mode'' where it automatically point towards Earth. While the component check out was performed, the satellite was let to drift to the 81° West orbital slot for the ''In Orbit Testing'' phase. It reached that slot on November 2.&lt;ref name=arsat-pr20141103 /&gt;

Between October 31 and November 18 the ''In Orbit Testing'' was successfully performed by ARSAT-1. It included testing of all subsystems, such as avionics, thermal management, power supply system and payload. It required slight attitude changes to validate the wave and power characteristics of the satellite signal. It successfully passed all tests finally validating the spacecraft performance.&lt;ref name=arsat-pr20141120 /&gt;

On December 13, ARSAT-1 performed its first public transmission from its final 71.8° West position. While the satellite was finally commissioned for operations, the migration of clients from [[AMC-6]] to ARSAT-1 was expected to take many months.&lt;ref name=arsat-pr20141216 /&gt; On May 12, 2015, ARSAT S.A. announced that ARSAT had successfully passed its first [[eclipse]] season between February 26 and April 13. It was a very particular season since the Earth and [[Moon]] eclipses were combined in such a way to make one of the longest eclipses of the 21st century (for that geostationary slot). This constituted the last technical hurdle to test since it stressed to the maximum requirement the battery and thermal management subsystems.&lt;ref name=arsat-pr20150512 /&gt;

On May 20, 2015, ARSAT S.A. announced that thanks to the high efficiency of the orbital maneuvers, the expected service life of ARSAT-1 was extended to 18 years. The orbit raising maneuvers had required less propellant (67%) than expected (80%) and allotting that fuel to station keeping would enable the spacecraft to stay in orbit for 18 years, should no component failure require its early retirement.&lt;ref name=arsat-pr20150520 /&gt;&lt;ref name=arglaw-senexp20150175 /&gt; It was further stated that the migration of clients from AMC-6 to ARSAT-1 had been performed for 96% of clients, and that the satellite utilization was 76%.&lt;ref name=arsat-pr20150520 /&gt;

{{grading}}
In [[Austria]], [[grade (education)|academic grades]] use a 5-point grading scale, where:

* 1 ("Sehr gut" - "very good") is the best possible grade and indicates outstanding performance with minor errors.
* 2 ("Gut" - "good") is the next-highest grade and is given for performance that is above-average standard but with some errors.
* 3 ("Befriedigend" - "satisfactory") indicates generally sound work with a number of notable errors.
* 4 ("Genügend" - "adequate") is the lowest passing grade and is given if the standard has been met but with a significant number of shortcomings.
* 5 ("Nicht genügend" - "unsatisfactory") is the lowest possible grade and the only failing grade (usually earned for less than 50% of the maximum achievable credit).

==Details of the Austrian system==
The Austrian grading system offers a range of five different grades (1 to 5), with 1 ("Sehr gut") being the highest and 5 ("Nicht genügend") the lowest grade. Students must be evaluated according to objective standards and need to earn at least a grade of 4 ("Genügend") in order to pass a course. Usually, the top 10% of successful students in class earn a 1 ("Sehr gut"). However, all passing grades (1 to 4) permit for further studies at university. 

The GPA is commonly used to measure academic success and has become increasingly important for application purposes. Nowadays, most employers ask for your last school certificate when applying for an apprenticeship. The Austrian system is similar to the [[Academic grading in Germany|German system]].

Between 961 and 1045, it was the [[Historic capitals of Armenia|capital]] of the [[Bagratid Armenia]]n kingdom that covered much of present-day Armenia and eastern Turkey. Called the "City of 1001 Churches",&lt;ref name=eb11/&gt;&lt;ref name=hako /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Not to confuse with the [[Binbirkilise]]/'1001 churches' near [[Karaman]] in modern Turkey'&lt;/ref&gt; Ani stood on various trade routes and its many [[Church architecture|religious buildings]], palaces, and fortifications were amongst the most technically and artistically advanced structures in the world.&lt;ref name=virt /&gt;&lt;ref name=eco /&gt; At its height, Ani was one of the biggest cities in the world,&lt;ref&gt; [[Joel Mokyr]].

Long ago renowned for its splendor and magnificence, Ani was sacked by the Mongols in 1236 and devastated in a 1319 earthquake, after which it was reduced to a village and gradually abandoned and largely forgotten by the seventeenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Mutafian, Claude.

==Etymology==
The city took its name from the Armenian fortress-city and [[pagan]] center of [[Kemah, Erzincan|Ani-Kamakh]] located in the region of Daranaghi in [[Upper Armenia]].&lt;ref name=ghaf /&gt;{{clarify|date=June 2016}} Ani was also previously known as '''Khnamk''' ({{lang|hy|Խնամք}}), although historians are uncertain as to why it was called so.&lt;ref name=ghaf /&gt;{{clarify|date=June 2016}} [[Johann Heinrich Hübschmann]], a German [[philologist]] and linguist who studied the Armenian language, suggested that the word may have come from the Armenian word "khnamel" ({{lang|hy|խնամել}}), an [[infinitive]] which means "to take care of".&lt;ref name=ghaf /&gt; Ani was also the diminutive name of ancient Armenian goddess [[Anahit]] who was seen as the mother-protector of Armenia.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}

==Location==
The city is located on a triangular site, visually dramatic and naturally defensive, protected on its eastern side by the ravine of the [[Akhurian River]] and on its western side by the Bostanlar or Tzaghkotzadzor valley.&lt;ref name=eb9/&gt; The Akhurian is a branch of the [[Araks River]]&lt;ref name=eb9/&gt; and forms part of the currently closed border between Turkey and Armenia. The site is at an elevation of around {{convert|4390|ft|sp=us}}.&lt;ref name=eb11/&gt;

==History==

===Early history===
Armenian chroniclers such as [[Yeghishe]] and [[Ghazar Parpetsi]] first mentioned Ani in the 5th century.&lt;ref name=ghaf /&gt; They described it as a strong fortress built on a hilltop and a possession of the Armenian [[Kamsarakan dynasty]].

===Bagratuni capital===
[[File:Bagratuni Armenia 1000-en.svg|thumb|right|275px|The Bagratuni Kingdom of Armenia, {{circa|1000}}]]

By the early 9th century, the former territories of the Kamsarakans in [[Arsharunik]] and [[Shirak Province|Shirak]] (including Ani) had been incorporated into the territories of the Armenian [[Bagratuni Dynasty|Bagratuni]] dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Whittow|first = Mark|title = The Making of Byzantium, 600–1025|publisher = University of California Press|year = 1996|location = Berkeley|pages =213–214|isbn =978-0-520-20497-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Their leader, [[Ashot Msaker|Ashot ''Msaker'']] (Ashot the Meateater) (806–827) was given the title of ''ishkhan'' (prince) of Armenia by the [[Caliphate]] in 804.&lt;ref&gt;Garsoian, Nina. "The Arab Invasions and the Rise of the Bagratuni (649–684)" in ''The Armenian People from Ancient to Modern Times, Volume I, The Dynastic Periods: From Antiquity to the Fourteenth Century'', ed. Richard G. Hovannisian. New York: St Martin's Press, 1997, p. 146. {{ISBN|978-0-312-10169-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bagratunis had their first capital at [[Bagaran (ancient city)|Bagaran]], some 40&amp;nbsp;km south of Ani, before moving it to [[Shirakavan, Armenia|Shirakavan]], some 25&amp;nbsp;km northeast of Ani, and then transferring it to [[Kars]] in the year 929. In 961, king [[Ashot III]] (953–77) transferred the capital from Kars to Ani.&lt;ref name=eb11/&gt; Ani expanded rapidly during the reign of King [[Smbat II]] (977–89). In 992 the [[List of Catholicoi of Armenia|Armenian Catholicosate]] moved its seat to Ani. In the 10th century the population was perhaps 50,000–100,000.&lt;ref&gt;Redgate, Anne Elizabeth. ''The Armenians''. Oxford: Blackwell Publishers, 1998, p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt; By the start of the eleventh century the population of Ani was well over 100,000,{{Citation needed|date=September 2014}} and its renown was such that it was known as the "city of forty gates" and the "city of a thousand and one churches." Ani also became the site of the royal mausoleum of Bagratuni kings.&lt;ref&gt;Manuk-Khaloyan, Armen, "In the Cemetery of their Ancestors: The Royal Burial Tombs of the Bagratuni Kings of Greater Armenia (890-1073/79)", ''[[Revue des Études Arméniennes]]'' 35 (2013): 147-155.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ani attained the peak of its power during the long reign of King [[Gagik I of Armenia|Gagik I]] (989–1020). After his death his two sons quarreled over the succession. The eldest son, [[Hovhannes-Smbat]] (1020–41), gained control of Ani while his younger brother, Ashot IV (1020–40), controlled other parts of the [[Bagratuni Kingdom of Armenia|Bagratuni kingdom]]. Hovhannes-Smbat, fearing that the [[Byzantine Empire]] would attack his now-weakened kingdom, made the Byzantine Emperor [[Basil II]] his heir.&lt;ref&gt;Whittow. ''Making of Byzantium'', p. 383.&lt;/ref&gt; When Hovhannes-Smbat died in 1041, Emperor [[Michael IV the Paphlagonian]], claimed sovereignty over Ani. The new king of Ani, [[Gagik II]] (1042–45), opposed this and several Byzantine armies sent to capture Ani were repulsed. However, in 1046 Ani surrendered to the Byzantines,&lt;ref name=eb11/&gt; after Gagik was invited to Constantinople and detained there, and at the instigation of pro-Byzantine elements among its population. A Byzantine governor was installed in the city.&lt;ref name=ghaf /&gt;

===Cultural and economic center===
[[File:AniMap.gif|thumb|320px|Plan of the city]]
Ani did not lie along any previously important trade routes, but because of its size, power, and wealth it became an important trading hub. Its primary trading partners were the Byzantine Empire, the [[Persian Empire]], the [[Arabs]], as well as smaller nations in southern Russia and Central Asia.&lt;ref name=ghaf /&gt;

===Gradual decline and abandonment===
In 1064, a large [[Seljuk Empire|Seljuk]] army under [[Alp Arslan]] attacked Ani; after a siege of 25 days, they captured the city and slaughtered its population.&lt;ref name=eb9/&gt; An account of the sack and massacres in Ani is given by the Arab historian [[Sibt ibn al-Jawzi]], who quotes an eyewitness saying:
{{quotation|Putting the Persian sword to work, they spared no one... One could see there the grief and calamity of every age of human kind. For children were ravished from the embraces of their mothers and mercilessly hurled against rocks, while the mothers drenched them with tears and blood... The city became filled from one end to the other with bodies of the slain and [the bodies of the slain] became a road. [...] The army entered the city, massacred its inhabitants, pillaged and burned it, leaving it in ruins and taking prisoner all those who remained alive...The dead bodies were so many that they blocked the streets; one could not go anywhere without stepping over them. And the number of prisoners was not less than 50,000 souls. I was determined to enter city and see the destruction with my own eyes. I tried to find a street in which I would not have to walk over the corpses; but that was impossible.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in {{cite book|last=Norwich|first=John Julius|authorlink=John Julius Norwich|title=Byzantium: The Apogee|publisher=Viking|location=New York|year = 1991|pages= 342–343|isbn = 978-0-394-53779-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1072, the Seljuks sold Ani to the [[Shaddadids]], a Muslim [[Kurds|Kurdish]] dynasty.&lt;ref name=eb9/&gt; The Shaddadids generally pursued a conciliatory policy towards the city’s overwhelmingly Armenian and Christian population and actually married several members of the Bagratid nobility. Whenever the Shaddadid governance became too intolerant, however, the population would appeal to the [[Georgian Orthodox Church|Christian]] [[Kingdom of Georgia]] for help. The Georgians captured Ani five times between 1124 and 1209:&lt;ref name=eb11/&gt; in 1124, 1161, 1174, 1199, and 1209.&lt;ref&gt;Georgian National Academy of Sciences, Kartlis Tskhovreba (History of Georgia), Artanuji pub. Tbilisi 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The first three times, it was recaptured by the Shaddadids. In the year 1199, Georgia's [[Tamar of Georgia|Queen Tamar]] captured Ani and in 1201 gave the governorship of the city to the generals [[Zakaria II Mkhargrdzeli|Zakare]] and [[Ivane I Mkhargrdzeli|Ivane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Lordkipanidze|first = Mariam|title = Georgia in the XI-XII Centuries|publisher = Genatleba|year = 1987|location = Tbilisi|page = 150}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zakare was succeeded by his son [[Shanshe Mkhargrdzeli|Shanshe]] (Shahnshah). Zakare's new dynasty — the [[Zakarids-Mkhargrzeli|Zakarids]] — considered themselves to be the successors to the Bagratids. Prosperity quickly returned to Ani; its defences were strengthened and many new churches were constructed. The [[Mongol Empire|Mongols]] unsuccessfully besieged Ani in 1226, but in 1236 they captured and sacked the city, massacring large numbers of its population. Under the Mongols the Zakarids continued to rule Ani, as the vassals of the Georgian monarch.&lt;ref&gt;Eastern Turkey: An Architectural and Archaeological Survey, 1. T. A. Sinclair&lt;/ref&gt; 

By the 14th century, the city was ruled by a succession of local Turkish dynasties, including the Jalayrids and the [[Kara Koyunlu]] (Black Sheep clan) who made Ani their capital. It was ruined by an earthquake in 1319.&lt;ref name=eb9/&gt;&lt;ref name=eb11/&gt; [[Timur|Tamerlane]] captured Ani in the 1380s. On his death the Kara Koyunlu regained control but transferred their capital to Yerevan. In 1441 the Armenian Catholicosate did the same. The Persian [[Safavid dynasty|Safavids]] then ruled Ani until it became part of the Turkish [[Ottoman Empire]] in 1579. A small town remained within its walls at least until the middle of the seventeenth century, but the site was entirely abandoned by 1735 when the last monks left the monastery in the Virgin's Fortress or Kizkale.

[[File:Marr archeological dig of Ani.jpg|thumb|right|200px|In 1905–06, archaeological excavations of the church of Saint Gregory of King Gagik were undertaken, headed by Nikolai Marr.]]
In the first half of the 19th century, European travelers discovered Ani for the outside world, publishing their descriptions in academic journals and travel accounts. The private buildings were little more than heaps of stones but grand public buildings and the city's double wall were preserved and reckoned to present "many points of great architectural beauty".&lt;ref name=eb9/&gt; [[Ohannes Kurkdjian]] produced [[stereoscopic]] image of Ani in the 2nd half of the 19th century.

In 1878, the Ottoman Empire's Kars region—including Ani—was incorporated into the [[Russian Empire]]'s [[Transcaucasia]]n region.&lt;ref name=eb11/&gt; In 1892 the first archaeological excavations were conducted at Ani, sponsored by the [[St. Petersburg Academy of Sciences]] and supervised by the Georgian archaeologist and orientalist [[Nicholas Marr]] (1864–1934). Marr's excavations at Ani resumed in 1904 and continued yearly until 1917. Large sectors of the city were professionally excavated, numerous buildings were uncovered and measured, the finds were studied and published in academic journals, guidebooks for the monuments and the museum were written, and the whole site was surveyed for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;Kalantar, Ashkharbek, ''The Mediaeval Inscriptions of Vanstan, Armenia,'' Civilisations du Proche-Orient: Series 2 – Philologie – CDPOP 2, Vol. 2, Recherches et Publications, Neuchâtel, Paris, 1999; {{ISBN|978-2-940032-11-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Emergency repairs were also undertaken on those buildings that were most at risk of collapse. A museum was established to house the tens of thousands of items found during the excavations. This museum was housed in two buildings: the Minuchihr mosque, and a purpose-built stone building.&lt;ref name="marr"&gt;{{cite book|last =Marr|first =Nicolas|title =Ani – Rêve d'Arménie|publisher =Anagramme Editions|year =2001|isbn =978-2-914571-00-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Armenians from neighboring villages and towns also began to visit the city on a regular basis,&lt;ref&gt;Manuk-Khaloyan, Armen. "[http://www.armenianweekly.com/2011/11/29/the-god-borne-days-of-ani/ The God-Borne Days of Ani: A Revealing Look at the Former Medieval Armenian Capital of Armenia at the Turn of the 20th Century]." ''[[Armenian Weekly]]''. November 29, 2011. Retrieved March 30, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; and there was even talk by Marr's team of building a school for educating the local Armenian children, building parks, and planting trees to beautify the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Tadevos Hakobyan|first=Tadevos|last=Hakobyan|year=1982|title=Անիի Պատմություն, 1045 թ. մինչև անկումն ու ամայացումը [The History of Ani, from 1045 Until its Collapse and Abandonment], vol. 2|location=Yerevan|publisher=Yerevan State University Press|pp=368–386|language=hy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1918, during the latter stages of [[World War I]], the armies of the Ottoman Empire were fighting their way across the territory of the newly declared Republic of Armenia, capturing [[Kars]] in April 1918. At Ani, attempts were made to evacuate the artifacts contained in the museum as Turkish soldiers were approaching the site. About 6000 of the most portable items were removed by archaeologist [[Ashkharbek Kalantar]], a participant of Marr's excavation campaigns. At the behest of [[Joseph Orbeli]], the saved items were consolidated into a museum collection; they are currently part of the collection of Yerevan's State Museum of Armenian History.&lt;ref name="Kalantar"&gt;{{cite book|last =Kalantar|first =Ashkharbek|title =Armenia from the Stone Age to the Middle Ages|publisher =Recherches et Publications|year =1994|isbn =978-2-940032-01-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Everything that was left behind was later looted or destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;Marr, Nikolai Y. "Ani, La Ville Arménniene en Ruines", ''[[Revue des Études Arméniennes]]''. vol. 1 (original series), 1921.&lt;/ref&gt; Turkey's surrender at the end of World War I led to the restoration of Ani to Armenian control, but a resumed offensive against the Armenian Republic in 1920 resulted in Turkey's recapture of Ani. In 1921 the signing of the [[Treaty of Kars]] formalized the incorporation of the territory containing Ani into the [[Republic of Turkey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{hy icon}} Zohrabyan, Edik A. (1979).

In May 1921, the government minister [[Rıza Nur]] ordered the commander of the Eastern Front, [[Kazım Karabekir]], for the monuments of Ani to "be wiped off the face of the earth."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Dadrian|first = Vahakn N.|authorlink = Vahakn Dadrian|title = The Role of Turkish Physicians in the World War I Genocide of Ottoman Armenians|journal=[[Holocaust and Genocide Studies]]|volume = 1|issue = 2|page = 192|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; Karabekir records in his memoirs that he has vigorously rejected this command and it has never been carried out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last =Karabekir|first =Kazım|title =Istiklal Harbimiz [Our War of Independence]|location=Istanbul|publisher= Türkiye Yayınevi|year =1960|pages =960–970|language=tr}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some destruction did take place, including most of Marr's excavations and building repairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last =Sim|first =Steven|title =The City of Ani: Recent History|publisher =VirtualANI|url =http://www.virtualani.org/history/part3.htm|accessdate =January 26, 2007|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20070126112900/http://www.virtualani.org/history/part3.htm|archivedate =January 26, 2007|deadurl =yes|df =mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current state==
Today, according to [[Lonely Planet]] and [[Frommer's]] travel guides to Turkey: &lt;blockquote&gt;
Official permission to visit Ani is no longer needed. Just go to Ani and buy a ticket. If you don't have your own car, haggle with a taxi or minibus driver in Kars for the round-trip to Ani, perhaps sharing the cost with other travelers. If you have trouble, the Tourist Office may help. Plan to spend at least a half-day at Ani. It's not a bad idea to bring a picnic lunch and a water bottle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last =Brosnahan|first =Tom|title =Ancient Armenian City of Ani|publisher =Turkey Travel Planner|url =http://www.turkeytravelplanner.com/go/East/Kars/Ani.html|accessdate =January 22, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070101181138/http://www.turkeytravelplanner.com/go/East/Kars/Ani.html| archivedate= January 1, 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to ''[[The Economist]]'', Armenians have "accused the Turks of neglecting the place in a spirit of chauvinism. The Turks retort that Ani's remains have been shaken by blasts from a quarry on the Armenian side of the border.&lt;ref name="eco"/&gt;

Another commentator said: Ani is now a ghost city, uninhabited for over three centuries and marooned inside a Turkish military zone on Turkey's decaying closed border with the modern [[Republic of Armenia]]. Ani's recent history has been one of continuous and always increasing destruction. Neglect, earthquakes, [[cultural cleansing]], vandalism, quarrying, amateurish [[Building restoration|restorations]] and [[excavation (archaeology)|excavations]] – all these and more have taken a heavy toll on Ani's monuments.&lt;ref name="virt"/&gt;

In the estimation of the [[Landmarks Foundation]] (a non-profit organization established for the protection of sacred sites) this ancient city "needs to be protected regardless of whose [[jurisdiction]] it falls under. Earthquakes in 1319, 1832, and 1988, Army Target practice and general neglect all have had devastating effects on the architecture of the city. The city of Ani is a sacred place which needs ongoing protection.&lt;ref name="land" /&gt;"

Turkey's authorities now say they will do their best to conserve and develop the site and the culture ministry has listed Ani among the sites it is keenest to conserve. In the words of Mehmet Ufuk Erden, the local governor: "By restoring Ani, we'll make a contribution to humanity...We will start with one church and one mosque, and over time we will include every single monument."&lt;ref name="eco"/&gt;

In an October 2010 report titled ''[[Saving Our Vanishing Heritage]]'', [[Global Heritage Fund]] identified Ani as one of 12 worldwide sites most "On the Verge" of irreparable loss and destruction, citing insufficient management and looting as primary causes.&lt;ref name="global_heritage_fund"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globalheritagefund.org/index.php/what_we_do/sites_on_the_verge |title=Global Heritage in the Peril: Sites on the Verge |accessdate=June 3, 2011 |date=October 2010 |publisher=Global Heritage Fund |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110422203730/http://globalheritagefund.org/index.php/what_we_do/sites_on_the_verge/ |archivedate=April 22, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="national_geographic_12_ancient_landmarks_on_verge_of_vanishing"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2010/10/photogalleries/101023-ancient-landmarks-vanishing-global-heritage-report-pictures/#/world-heritage-fun-sites-threatened-ani-turkey_27808_600x450.jpg|title=Pictures: 12 Ancient Landmarks on Verge of Vanishing|accessdate=June 3, 2011|author=John Roach|date=October 23, 2010|publisher=National Geographic| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615073055/http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2010/10/photogalleries/101023-ancient-landmarks-vanishing-global-heritage-report-pictures/| archivedate= June 15, 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[World Monuments Fund]] (WMF) placed Ani on its 1996, 1998, and 2000 Watch Lists of 100 Most Endangered Sites. In May 2011, WMF announced it was beginning conservation work on the cathedral and Church of the Holy Redeemer in partnership with the Turkish Ministry of Culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wmf.org/sites/default/files/press_releases/Ani-press-release.pdf|title=Turkish Ministry of Culture and Tourism and World Monuments Fund Collaborate on Historic Conservation Project in Eastern Turkey|accessdate=November 17, 2011|date=May 2011|publisher=World Monuments Fund}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2015, it was reported that Turkey will nominate Ani to be listed as a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Work ongoing to put Ani on UNESCO heritage list|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/work-ongoing-to-put-ani-on-unesco-heritage-list-.aspx?pageID=238&amp;nID=79072&amp;NewsCatID=375|work=[[Hürriyet Daily News]]|date=2 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The archaeological site of Ani was inscribed as a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] on July 15, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Five sites inscribed on UNESCO’s World Heritage List|url=http://www.unesco.org/new/en/media-services/single-view/news/five_sites_inscribed_on_unescos_world_heritage_list/#.V4vUsLh97IU|website=UNESCOPRESS|publisher=[[UNESCO]]|date=15 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to art historian Heghnar Zeitlian Watenpaugh the addition "would secure significant benefits in protection, research expertise, and funding."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ani Included on UNESCO World Heritage List|url=http://armenianweekly.com/2016/07/15/ani-unesco/|work=[[Armenian Weekly]]|date=15 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Monuments at Ani==
All the structures at Ani are constructed using the local volcanic basalt, a sort of tufa stone. It is easily carved and comes in a variety of vibrant colors, from creamy yellow, to rose-red, to jet black. The most important surviving monuments are as follows.

[[File:Ani-Cathedral, Ruine.jpeg|thumb|right|250px|Cathedral of Ani]]

===The Cathedral===
{{main|Cathedral of Ani}}
Also known as Surp Asdvadzadzin (the Church of the Holy Mother of God), its construction was started in the year 989, under [[King Smbat II]]. Work was halted after his death, and was only finished in 1001 (or in 1010 under another reading of its building inscription). The design of the cathedral was the work of [[Trdat the architect|Trdat]], the most celebrated architect of medieval Armenia. The cathedral is a domed basilica (the dome collapsed in 1319). The interior contains several progressive features (such as the use of pointed arches and clustered piers) that give to it the appearance of [[Gothic architecture]] (a style which the Ani cathedral predates by several centuries).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last =Sim|first =Steven|title =The cathedral of Ani|publisher =VirtualANI|url =http://www.virtualani.org/cathedral/index.htm|accessdate =January 23, 2007|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20070120194628/http://www.virtualani.org/cathedral/index.htm|archivedate =January 20, 2007|deadurl =yes|df =mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Surp Stephanos Church===
There is no inscription giving the date of its construction, but an edict in Georgian is dated 1218. The church was referred to as "Georgian". During this period "Georgian" did not simply mean an ethnic Georgian, it had a denominational meaning and would have designated all those in Ani who professed the Chalcedonian faith, mostly [[Armenians|Armenian]]s. Although the Georgian Church controlled this church, its congregation would have mostly been Armenians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last =Sim|first =Steven|title =THE GEORGIAN CHURCH|publisher =VirtualANI|url =http://www.virtualani.org/georgianchurch/index.htm|accessdate =February 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The church of St Gregory of Tigran Honents===
This church, finished in 1215, is the best-preserved monument at Ani. It was built during the rule of the [[Zakarids]] and was commissioned by the wealthy Armenian merchant [[Tigran Honents]].&lt;ref name=nicholas&gt;{{cite book|last1=Coureas|first1=Nicholas|last2=Edbury|first2=Peter|last3=Walsh|first3=Michael J.K.|title=Medieval and Renaissance Famagusta : Studies in Architecture, Art and History|date=2012|publisher=Ashgate|location=Farnham|isbn=1409435571|page=139|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6NnDOZeKR80C}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its plan is of a type called a ''domed hall''. In front of its entrance are the ruins of a narthex and a small chapel that are from a slightly later period. The exterior of the church is spectacularly decorated. Ornate stone carvings of real and imaginary animals fill the spandrels between blind arcade that runs around all four sides of the church. The interior contains an important and unique series of frescoes cycles that depict two main themes. In the eastern third of the church is depicted the Life of [[Saint Gregory the Illuminator]], in the middle third of the church is depicted the Life of Christ. Such extensive fresco cycles are rare features in Armenian architecture – it is believed that these ones were executed by Georgian artists, and the cycle also includes scenes from the life of St. Nino, who converted the Georgians to Christianity. In the narthex and its chapel survive fragmentary frescoes that are more Byzantine in style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last =Sim|first =Steven|title =The church of St. Gregory of Tigran Honents|publisher =VirtualANI|url =http://www.virtualani.org/tigranhonents/index.htm|accessdate =January 23, 2007|archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20070522062042/http://www.virtualani.org/tigranhonents/index.htm|archive-date =May 22, 2007|dead-url =yes|df =mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The church of the Holy Redeemer===
[[File:20110419 Church of Redeemer Collage Ani Turkey.jpg|thumb|250px|right|The Church of the Redeemer (Surb Prkich).]]
This church was completed shortly after the year 1035. It had a unique design: 19-sided externally, 8-apsed internally, with a huge central dome set upon a tall drum. It was built by Prince Ablgharib Pahlavid to house a fragment of the [[True Cross]]. The church was largely intact until 1955, when the entire eastern half collapsed during a storm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last =Sim|first =Steven|title =The church of the Redeemer|publisher =VirtualANI|url =http://www.virtualani.org/redeemer/index.htm|accessdate =January 23, 2007|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20070120195202/http://www.virtualani.org/redeemer/index.htm|archivedate =January 20, 2007|deadurl =yes|df =mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The church of St Gregory of the Abughamrents===
This small building probably dates from the late 10th century. It was built as a private chapel for the Pahlavuni family. Their mausoleum, built in 1040 and now reduced to its foundations, was constructed against the northern side of the church. The church has a centralised plan, with a dome over a drum, and the interior has six exedera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last =Sim|first =Steven|title =The church of St. Gregory of the Abughamir family|publisher =VirtualANI|url =http://www.virtualani.org/abughamrents/index.htm|accessdate =January 23, 2007|archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20070524192936/http://www.virtualani.org/abughamrents/index.htm|archive-date =May 24, 2007|dead-url =yes|df =mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===King Gagik's church of St Gregory===
Also known as the Gagikashen, this church was constructed between the years 1001 and 1005 and intended to be a recreation of the celebrated cathedral of [[Zvartnots Cathedral|Zvartnots]] at [[Vagharshapat, Armenia|Vagharshapat]]. [[Nikolai Marr]] uncovered the foundations of this remarkable building in 1905 and 1906. Before that, all that was visible on the site was a huge earthen mound. The designer of the church was the architect [[Trdat the architect|Trdat]]. The church is known to have collapsed a relatively short time after its construction and houses were later constructed on top of its ruins. Trdat's design closely follows that of Zvartnotz in its size and in its plan (a quatrefoil core surrounded by a circular ambulatory).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last =Sim|first =Steven|title =King Gagik's church of St. Gregory|publisher =VirtualANI|url =http://www.virtualani.org/gagikashen/index.htm|accessdate =January 23, 2007|archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20070926213331/http://www.virtualani.org/gagikashen/index.htm|archive-date =September 26, 2007|dead-url =yes|df =mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The church of the Holy Apostles===
The date of its construction is not known, but the earliest dated inscription on its walls is from 1031. It was founded by the Pahlavuni family and was used by the archbishops of Ani (many of whom belonged to that dynasty). It has a plan of a type called an ''inscribed quatrefoil with corner chambers''. Only fragments remain of the church, but a narthex with spectacular stonework, built against the south side of the church, is still partially intact. It dates from the early 13th century. A number of other halls, chapels, and shrines once surrounded this church: Nicholas Marr excavated their foundations in 1909, but they are now mostly destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last =Sim|first =Steven|title =Church of the Holy Apostles|publisher =VirtualANI|url =http://www.virtualani.org/apostleschurch/index.htm|accessdate =January 23, 2007|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20070216195144/http://www.virtualani.org/apostleschurch/index.htm|archivedate =February 16, 2007|deadurl =yes|df =mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ani.mosque.jpg|160px|thumb|right|[[Manuchihr ibn Shavur|Manuchihr]] Mosque west view]]

===The mosque of Manuchihr===
The mosque is named after its presumed founder, [[Manuchihr ibn Shavur|Manuchihr]], the first member of the [[Shaddadid]] dynasty that ruled Ani after 1072. The oldest surviving part of the mosque is its still intact minaret. It has the Arabic word ''Bismillah'' ("In the name of God") in [[Kufic]] lettering high on its northern face. The prayer hall, half of which survives, dates from a later period (the 12th or 13th century). In 1906 the mosque was partially repaired in order for it to house a public museum containing objects found during Nicholas Marr's excavations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last =Sim|first =Steven|title =The mosque of Minuchihr|publisher =VirtualANI|url =http://www.virtualani.org/minuchihrmosque/index.htm|accessdate =January 23, 2007|archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20070120195237/http://www.virtualani.org/minuchihrmosque/index.htm|archivedate =January 20, 2007|deadurl =yes|df =mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The citadel===
At the southern end of Ani is a flat-topped hill once known as ''Midjnaberd'' (the Inner Fortress). It has its own defensive walls that date back to the period when the [[Kamsarakan]] dynasty ruled Ani (7th century AD). Nicholas Marr excavated the citadel hill in 1908 and 1909. He uncovered the extensive ruins of the palace of the Bagratid kings of Ani that occupied the highest part of the hill. Also inside the citadel are the visible ruins of three churches and several unidentified buildings. One of the churches, the "church of the palace" is the oldest surviving church in Ani, dating from the 6th or 7th century. Marr undertook emergency repairs to this church, but most of it has now collapsed – probably during an earthquake in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last =Sim|first =Steven|title =The citadel of Ani|publisher =VirtualANI|url =http://www.virtualani.org/citadel/index.htm|accessdate =January 23, 2007|archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20070603185815/http://www.virtualani.org/citadel/index.htm|archive-date =June 3, 2007|dead-url =yes|df =mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The city walls===
[[File:Ani townwall.jpg|thumb|275px|right|The walls of Ani showing a defensive tower.]]
A line of walls that encircled the entire city defended Ani. The most powerful defences were along the northern side of the city, the only part of the site not protected by rivers or ravines. Here the city was protected by a double line of walls, the much taller inner wall studded by numerous large and closely spaced semicircular towers. Contemporary chroniclers wrote that King Smbat (977–989) built these walls. Later rulers strengthened Smbat's walls by making them substantially higher and thicker, and by adding more towers. Armenian inscriptions from the 12th and 13th century show that private individuals paid for some of these newer towers. The northern walls had three gateways, known as the Lion Gate, the Kars Gate, and the Dvin Gate (also known as the Chequer-Board Gate because of a panel of red and black stone squares over its entrance).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last =Sim|first =Steven|title =The city walls of Ani|publisher =VirtualANI|url =http://www.virtualani.org/walls/index.htm|accessdate =January 23, 2007|archive-url =https://web.archive.org/web/20070717150708/http://www.virtualani.org/walls/index.htm|archive-date =July 17, 2007|dead-url =yes|df =mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other monuments===
There are many other minor monuments at Ani. These include a convent known as the Virgins' chapel; a church used by [[Chalcedonian]] Armenians; the remains of a single-arched bridge over the Arpa river; the ruins of numerous oil-presses and several bath houses; the remains of a second mosque with a collapsed minaret; a palace that probably dates from the 13th century; the foundations of several other palaces and smaller residences; the recently excavated remains of several streets lined with shops; etc.

===Cave Village===
Directly outside of Ani, there was a settlement-zone carved into the cliffs. It may have served as "urban sprawl" when Ani grew too large for its city walls. Today, goats and sheep take advantage of the caves' cool interiors. One highlight of this part of Ani is a cave church with frescos on its surviving walls and ceiling.

==In culture==
[[Ani (given name)|Ani]] is one of the most popular female given names in Armenia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Which are most common Armenian names?|url=http://news.am/eng/news/118484.html|accessdate=10 August 2013|newspaper=News.am|date=27 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Songs and poems have been written about Ani and its past glory. "Tesnem Anin u nor mernem" (Տեսնեմ Անին ու նոր մեռնեմ, Let me see Ani before I die) is a famous poem by [[Hovhannes Shiraz]]. It was turned into a song by Turkish-Armenian composer [[:tr:Cenk Taşkan|Cenk Taşkan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ktak.am/e107_plugins/forum/forum_viewtopic.php?216.20 |title=Forums / Հայկական Երգերի Շտեմարան / Հայաստան - Կրթական Տեխնոլոգիաների Ազգային Կենտրոն |publisher=Ktak.am |date= |accessdate=2013-08-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029195359/http://www.ktak.am/e107_plugins/forum/forum_viewtopic.php?216.20 |archivedate=October 29, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.yerevan2012.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=164%3Aani-a-poem-by-hovhannes-shiraz&amp;catid=45%3Anew-books&amp;Itemid=151&amp;lang=en |title='Ani', A Poem By Hovhannes Shiraz |publisher=Yerevan2012.org |date=2012-02-16 |accessdate=2013-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ara Gevorgyan]]'s 1999 album of folk instrumental songs is titled ''Ani''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ani|url=http://www.aragevorgyan.net/album_ani.php|publisher=Ara Gevorgyan Website|accessdate=10 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Biblen''''' is a [[Play (theatre)|stage play]] from [[Denmark]], performed at [[Nørrebros Theater]] during early 2008 (23 February to 26 April). It takes the form of a [[:da:Skrako|skrako play]], a Danish kind of play which blends [[acting]], [[rapping]], and [[stand-up comedy]]. All roles in ''Biblen'' were performed by stand-up comedians [[Jonatan Spang]], [[Rune Klan]] (also a [[Magic (illusion)|magician]]), and {{ill|Linda P|da|Linda P}}, and rappers {{ill|Blæs Bukki|da|Blæs Bukki}} and {{ill|Tue Track|da|Tue Track}}.

The play is based on the [[Bible]], deriving its plot from a number of [[Bible story|Biblical stories]], such as [[Cain and Abel]], [[Noah's Ark]], [[Moses]] and the [[Ten Commandments]], the [[Parable of the Workers in the Vineyard|Workers in the Vineyard]], the [[Last Supper]], and the [[crucifixion of Jesus]]. It also serves as a satire of the Bible, the [[Church of Denmark]], and the [[Religion in Denmark|Danish relationship with religion]] more broadly.

'''Bitnation''', or '''cryptonation''',{{r|Atzori-2015-12-01|p=5}} is a "voluntary nation" that records vital records, identity and other legal events using blockchain technology. Bitnation was founded in 2014 using [[Ethereum]] [[smart contract]] technology.{{r|Lobe-2016-04-02}}{{r|Souli-2016-09-12}}{{r|Mattila-2016-05-10|p=13}} As of 2018, it has about 15,000 "citizens".{{r|Bartlett-2016-05-24}} Its 2018 whitepaper describes Bitnation as "the world's first Decentralized Borderless Voluntary Nation." Bitnation organized the world’s first Blockchain Marriage and World Citizenship ID, Blockchain Land Title, Birth Certificate and Refugee Emergency ID during 2014 and 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://github.com/Bit-Nation/Pangea-Docs/blob/master/BITNATION%20Pangea%20Whitepaper%202018.pdf|title=Bit-Nation/Pangea-Docs|website=GitHub|language=en|access-date=2018-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bitnation seeks to provide [[open-source governance]], which includes [[Do it yourself|DIY]] [[smart contract]]s mainly on governance, security and law.{{r|Mattila-2016-05-10|p=13}} The subsidiary services include constitutions, secure ID/Reputation systems, dispute resolutions, security, insurance, marriages, [[notary]] service, and birth certifications.{{r|Mattila-2016-05-10|p=13}}{{r|Vigna-2014-09-26}}

==Etymology and terminology==
The term ''bitnation'' consist of the words ''[[bit]]'' and ''[[nation]]''. It is a government-centric analog to the virtual currency [[bitcoin]] that also applies [[blockchain]] technology.

==History==

===Background===
Bitnation founder Susanne Tarkowski Tempelhof grew up in a Franco-Swedish family where her father had been stateless for a decade.{{r|Marty-2014-10-17}} As a defense contractor working in the Middle East,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/xyg5x7/bitnation-or-bust|title=I Became a Citizen of Bitnation, a Blockchain-Powered Virtual Nation. Now What?|date=September 12, 2016|work=Motherboard|access-date=2018-05-16|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; she witnessed what she considered unethical and non-sustainable [[governance]] during the [[Arab Spring]]. The incorporation between [[Blockchain]] technology and its [[proof-of-work]] core product [[Bitcoin]] inspired her to extend its products into [[education]] and [[national security]], which gradually evolved into the backbone concepts of the modern [[startup company]] Bitnation.{{r|Hintergründe-2016-11-28}}

===Founding===
Bitnation was founded July 14, 2014 by Susanne Tarkowski Tempelhof.{{r|Mattila-2016-05-10|p=13}}{{r|Bartlett-2016-05-24}}{{r|Vigna-2014-09-26}} An early whitepaper describing the Bitnation concept and laying out a political justification was written largely in late 2014 and finished in March 2016 by Tempelhof and co-drafter Jason M. Farrell.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pdf-archive.com/2016/09/07/bitnationwhitepaperv2/|title=PDF Document bitnationwhitepaperv2.pdf - page 1/23|work=PDF Archive|access-date=2018-05-16|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; A second paper articulating the Pangea jurisdiction and supporting technologies was written by Tempelhof, Eliot Teissonierre, James Fennell Tempelhof and Dana Edwards and released in early 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://tse.bitnation.co/documents/|website=Bitnation Pangea|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Per the white paper, its stated purpose is to "free humankind from the oppression and sanction of pooled sovereignty, geographical apartheid and the xenophobia and violence that is nurtured by the Nation State oligopoly."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://github.com/Bit-Nation/Pangea-Docs/blob/master/BITNATION%20Pangea%20Whitepaper%202018.pdf|title=Bit-Nation/Pangea-Docs|website=GitHub|language=en|access-date=2018-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Milestones===
* 2014: Bitnation began offering digital IDs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitnation-registers-first-refugees-on-the-blockchain|title=Bitnation Registers First Refugees on the Blockchain|publisher=Cointelegraph|date=September 18, 2015|author=Erin Lace}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Late 2014: Bitnation incorporated its [[proof-of-stake]] [[Counterparty (technology)|counterparty]] 
* September 2014: Bitnation registered the first Blockchain Marriage{{r|Vigna-2014-09-26}} and hosted the first Blockchain World Citizenship at World Crypto Network (WCN)
* April 2015: Bitnation introduced its first land titles and the first birth certificate on the Blockchain. 
* November 2015: Bitnation partnered with [[Estonia]] to introduce its digital [[public notary]] based on Blockchain technology.
* February 2016: Bitnation moved their tokens to the [[Ethereum]] blockchain. It also coded its digital constitution ''Pangea'', co-written by Ethereum developer Alex Van de Sande. 
* April 2016, Bitnation partnered with [[Liberland]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://github.com/Bit-Nation/Pangea-Docs/blob/master/BITNATION%20Pangea%20Whitepaper%202018.pdf|title=Bit-Nation/Pangea-Docs|website=GitHub|language=en|access-date=2018-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; to "explore the problem of how to create effective blockchain juridictions and arbitration systems."

==Position as an early adopter of Blockchain==
In 1991, the term "Blockchain" was coined by Stuart Haber and W. Scott Stornetta.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} In 2009, the first "Blockchain" was created by Satoshi Nakamoto.{{r|Economist-2015-10-31}} Bitnation has applied Ethereum's version of blockchain technology for its core government services since 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://github.com/Bit-Nation/Pangea-Docs/blob/master/BITNATION%20Pangea%20Whitepaper%202018.pdf|title=Bit-Nation/Pangea-Docs|website=GitHub|language=en|access-date=2018-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media==
Bitnation was the subject of a ''Vice'' piece in September 2016 wherein the author noted that "because a nation is as much an ideological concept as it is a legal one, one strength of Bitnation lies in its ability to give agency to groups who have been ignored or repressed by modern nation-states."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://motherboard.vice.com/en_us/article/xyg5x7/bitnation-or-bust|title=I Became a Citizen of Bitnation, a Blockchain-Powered Virtual Nation. Now What?|date=September 12, 2016|work=Motherboard|access-date=2018-05-16|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''International Business Times'' noted Bitnation is "sure to change the conversation about tangible blockchain solutions for global problems like a refugee crisis."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/here-are-two-initial-coin-offerings-you-need-watch-summer-2549080|title=Here Are Two Initial Coin Offerings You Need To Watch This Summer|date=June 10, 2017|work=International Business Times|access-date=2018-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Atlantic'' noted in February 2018 "Bitnation [is] proposing a 'peer-to-peer voluntary governance system' to replace the arbitrariness of birth as the decider of one’s citizenship. Blockchain governance could allow for the creation of virtual citizenship and autonomous communities distinct from territorial nation-states."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2018/02/virtual-citizenship-for-sale/553733/|title=The Rise of Virtual Citizenship|last=Bridle|first=James|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2018-05-16|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bitnation also received notable coverage in ''The Economist''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/news/world-if/21724906-trust-business-little-noticed-huge-startups-deploying-blockchain-technology-threaten|title=Disrupting the trust business|website=The Economist|language=en|access-date=2018-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''Wall Street Journal'' for its experimental work in using blockchain technology to solve the migrant crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/can-bitcoin-technology-solve-the-migrant-crisis-1465395474|title=Can Bitcoin Technology Solve the Migrant Crisis?|last=Warden|first=Staci|date=June 8, 2016|work=Wall Street Journal|access-date=2018-05-16|language=en-US|issn=0099-9660}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cacolac''' is a milk-based drink created in 1954 in [[Bordeaux]], [[France]] by the Lanneluc and Lauseig families. Throughout France, it is available in about 70% of all cafés, hotels, and restaurants. Since 1978, it has also been available in grocery stores in glass bottles and cans.

==Producer==
The food company ''Cacolac'' is still  directed by the family of the creators. It employs twenty-eight people, and the manufacturing plant has been located in [[Léognan]], in the [[Gironde]] department in [[Aquitaine]] since 2000. It also distributes the products by itself.

==Recipe==
Contrary to popular belief, Cacolac is simply [[chocolate milk]], although it has a different flavor to it. The nutritional value of this drink is low, and it can be drunk either hot or cold.

==Marketing==
The company was offered free publicity almost daily for some time. In fact, the [[Puppetry|puppet]] footballer [[Jean-Pierre Papin]] of [[Les Guignols]] was presented as a big fan of the drink. [[Groupe Danone|Danone]] had tried to market the fresh version of the drink by investing heavily in advertising campaigns, but had little success.

The '''Challenge Prince Rainier III''' is a domestic [[association football|football]] cup in [[Monaco]], featuring [[List of football clubs in Monaco|teams]] from across the country. The tournament has been organised annually since 1975 and since then has been known as the premier footballing tournament for amateur teams within the principality.

Because Monaco is not a member of [[UEFA]], there is no qualification for the winners into either the [[UEFA Europa League]] or the [[UEFA Champions League]].

==History==
The tournament was created in 1975 after [[Prince Rainier III]] requested a footballing tournament in the country be played.

President of the Organizing Committee, [[Joseph Destefanis]], recalled how the only football game of the year had an air of folklore among the players and of the palace of Monaco. At the time the teams were completed and at the request of Prince Rainier III, the competition has grown.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cocpr3.com/comite/historique.html Conduct of major events]{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} from cocpr3.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format==
In the first round of the competition, the teams are placed into groups for a [[wikt:round-robin|round-robin]] stage. The best teams from these groups progress to the knockout rounds of the Challenge Prince Rainier III. The lower teams from each group then qualify for the knockout stages of the [[Trophée Ville de Monaco]], the second level cup in Monaco underneath the Challenge Prince Rainier III.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsssf.com/tablesm/monaco09.html Monaco 2009 results] from RSSSF.com&lt;/ref&gt;

'''"Chamar a música"''' (Call the music) was the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] entry in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1994]], performed in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] by [[Sara Tavares]].

The song is a ballad, with Tavares telling her lover that tonight will be purely for the two of them. She explains that she will "call the music" and write a song for them alone, rather than watching TV or anything else.

The song was performed eighth on the night, following [[Croatia]]'s [[Tony Cetinski]] with "[[Nek' ti bude ljubav sva]]" and preceding [[Switzerland]]'s [[Duilio]] with "[[Sto pregando]]". At the close of voting, it had received 73 points, placing 8th in a field of 25.

It was succeeded as [[Portugal in the Eurovision Song Contest|Portuguese representative]] at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1995|1995 contest]] by [[Tó Cruz]] with "[[Baunilha e chocolate]]".

The '''Communist Organization of Angola''' ({{Lang-pt|Organização Comunista de Angola}}; ''OCA'') was a [[Maoist]]-oriented communist party in [[Angola]]. OCA was founded in 1975 by the Amilcar Cabral Committees (''Comités Amilcar Cabral''; CAC). The CAC were founded in 1974 inside the [[People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola]] ([[MPLA]]) and were excluded from the party in 1975. It opposed the MPLA government and what it called Soviet [[social-imperialism]]. It also called for withdrawal of [[Cuba]]n troops.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=NnssAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=%22Communist+Organization+of+Angola%22+cuban&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=%22withdrawal+of+all+Cuban+forces%22|title=Angola, a country study|last=Studies|first=American University (Washington, D.

The '''Council for European Studies (CES)''',  based at [[Columbia University]], is an academic organization for the study of [[Europe]]. It offers scholarships and research grants, publications, and an annual conference.

==History==
The Council for European Studies was founded in 1970 with a grant from the [[Ford Foundation]].  First located at the [[University of Pittsburgh]] and later moved to [[Columbia University]], its current institutional host, CES was originally formed as a limited consortium of Western European studies programs at eight major U.S. universities: [[University of California Berkeley]], [[Columbia University]], [[Harvard]], [[Princeton University|Princeton]], [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], [[University of Michigan]], [[University of Wisconsin]], and [[Yale]].  However, it ceased to be a consortium of eight in 1972, when twenty other universities were invited to become institutional members.

Since that time, its institutional membership has grown substantially.  Its institutional members currently include over 100 universities, colleges, and institutes around the world. Moreover, although membership was once restricted to institutions, CES has opened its membership rolls to individuals and now counts about 1,200 individuals as organization members. Membership provides access to the full range of CES fellowship and award competitions, publications, research resources, and professional development opportunities.

The Council for European Studies is an independent, 501(c)(3) not-for-profit organization.

==Grants, Fellowships, and Awards==
CES sponsors a variety of fellowship and award competitions for graduate students and scholars of European Studies, which are available exclusively to individual CES members, as well as students, faculty, and researchers affiliated with CES member institutions.

'''Cuba''' ({{IPAc-en|audio=En-Cuba-pronunciation.ogg|ˈ|k|juː|b|ə}}; {{IPA-es|ˈkuβa}}), officially the '''Republic of Cuba''' ({{Audio-es|República de Cuba|RCUB.ogg}}),&lt;!--IPA:{{IPA-es|reˈpuβlika ðe ˈkuβa|}}--&gt; is a country comprising the island of Cuba as well as [[Isla de la Juventud]] and several minor [[archipelagos]]. Cuba is located in the northern [[Caribbean]] where the [[Caribbean Sea]], [[Gulf of Mexico]] and [[Atlantic Ocean]] meet. It is east of [[Mexico]], south of both the [[United States|U.S.]] state of [[Florida]] and [[the Bahamas]], west of [[Haiti]] and north of [[Jamaica]]. [[Havana]] is the largest city and capital; other major cities include [[Santiago de Cuba]] and [[Camagüey]]. The area of the Republic of Cuba is {{convert|110,860|km2|sqmi}} ({{convert|109,884|km2|sqmi}} without the territorial waters). The island of Cuba is the largest island in Cuba and in the Caribbean, with an area of {{convert|105,006|km2|sqmi}}, and the second-most populous after [[Hispaniola]], with over 11 million inhabitants.&lt;ref name = "BBC profile"&gt;{{cite web |title= Cuba profile: Facts |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-19583446 |publisher= BBC News |accessdate= March 26, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pre-Columbian era===
[[File:Hatuey monument, Baracoa, Cuba.JPG|left|thumb|upright|Monument of [[Hatuey]], an early [[Taíno]] chief of Cuba]]
Before the arrival of the Spanish, Cuba was inhabited by three distinct tribes of [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]]. The [[Taíno people|Taíno]] (an [[Arawak peoples|Arawak]] people), the [[Guanahatabey]] and the [[Ciboney people]].

The ancestors of the Ciboney migrated from the mainland of South America, with the earliest sites dated to 5,000 [[Before Present|BP]].&lt;ref name="AnAofPCC"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Art and archaeology of pre-Columbian Cuba|page=22|year=1996|author=Ramón Dacal Moure, Manuel Rivero de la Calle|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press|isbn=978-0-8229-3955-9|url=https://books.google.com/?id=PEE9oipDYksC&amp;pg=PA22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Taíno arrived from [[Hispanola]] sometime in the 3rd century A.D. When Columbus arrived they were the dominant culture in Cuba, having an estimated population of 150,000.&lt;ref name="AnAofPCC"/&gt;

The Taíno were farmers, while the Ciboney were farmers as well as fishers and [[hunter-gatherer]]s.

Cuba developed slowly and, unlike the plantation islands of the Caribbean, had a diversified agriculture. But what was most important was that the colony developed as an urbanized society that primarily supported the Spanish colonial empire. By the mid-18th century, its colonists held 50,000 slaves, compared to 60,000 in [[Barbados]]; 300,000 in [[Colony of Virginia|Virginia]], both British colonies; and 450,000 in French [[Saint-Domingue]], which had large-scale sugar cane plantations.&lt;ref name="drimmer"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20160705125708/http://www.jstor.org/stable/1919107?seq=1 Melvin Drimmer, "Reviewed Work: ''Slavery in the Americas: A Comparative Study of Virginia and Cuba'' by Herbert S.

The [[Seven Years' War]], which erupted in 1754 across three continents, eventually arrived in the Spanish Caribbean. Spain's alliance with the French pitched them into direct conflict with the British, and in 1762 [[Battle of Havana (1762)|a British expedition]] of five warships and 4,000 troops set out from [[Portsmouth]] to capture Cuba. The British arrived on 6 June, and by August had Havana under [[siege]].&lt;ref name="Siege"&gt;Thomas, Hugh. ''Cuba: The Pursuit of Freedom (2nd edition)''. Chapter One.&lt;/ref&gt; When Havana surrendered, the admiral of the British fleet, [[George Keppel, 3rd Earl of Albemarle|George Keppel]], the 3rd [[Earl of Albemarle]], entered the city as a conquering new governor and took control of the whole western part of the island. The British immediately opened up trade with their North American and Caribbean colonies, causing a rapid transformation of Cuban society. They imported food, horses and other goods into the city, as well as thousands of slaves from West Africa to work on the underdeveloped sugar plantations.&lt;ref name="Siege"/&gt;

Though Havana, which had become the third-largest city in the Americas, was to enter an era of sustained development and increasing ties with North America during this period, the British occupation of the city proved short-lived. Pressure from London sugar merchants, fearing a decline in sugar prices, forced negotiations with the Spanish over colonial territories. Less than a year after Britain seized Havana, it signed the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Peace of Paris]] together with France and Spain, ending the Seven Years' War. The treaty gave Britain [[Florida]] in exchange for Cuba. The French had recommended this to Spain, advising that declining to give up Florida could result in Spain instead losing Mexico and much of the South American mainland to the British.&lt;ref name="Siege"/&gt; Many in Britain were disappointed, believing that Florida was a poor return for Cuba and [[Great Britain in the Seven Years' War|Britain's other gains in the war]].

The real engine for the growth of Cuba's commerce in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth century was the [[Haitian Revolution]]. When the enslaved peoples of what had been the Caribbean's richest colony freed themselves through violent revolt, Cuban planters perceived the region's changing circumstances with both a sense of fear and opportunity. They were afraid because of the prospect that slaves might revolt in Cuba, too, and numerous prohibitions during the 1790s on the sale of slaves in Cuba that had previously been slaves in French colonies underscored this anxiety. The planters saw opportunity, however, because they thought that they could exploit the situation by transforming Cuba into the slave society and sugar-producing "pearl of the Antilles" that Haiti had been before the revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Freedom's Mirror: Cuba and Haiti in the Age of Revolution|last = Ferrer|first = Ada|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 2014|isbn = 978-1107029422|location = New York|pages = 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the historian Ada Ferrer has written, "At a basic level, liberation in Saint-Domingue helped entrench its denial in Cuba. As slavery and colonialism collapsed in the French colony, the Spanish island underwent transformations that were almost the mirror image of Haiti's."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Freedom's Mirror: Cuba and Haiti in the Age of Revolution|last = Ferrer|first = Ada|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 2014|isbn = 978-1107029422|location = New York|pages = 10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Estimates suggest that between 1790 and 1820 some 325,000 Africans were imported to Cuba as slaves, which was four times the amount that had arrived between 1760 and 1790.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Freedom's Mirror: Cuba and Haiti in the Age of Revolution|last = Ferrer|first = Ada|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 2014|isbn = |location = New York|pages = 36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although a smaller proportion of the population of Cuba was enslaved, at times slaves arose in revolt. In 1812 the [[Aponte Conspiracy|Aponte Slave Rebellion]] took place but it was suppressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Childs|first=Matt D.|title=The 1813 Aponte Rebellion in Cuba and the Struggle against Atlantic Slavery|year=2006|publisher=The University of North Carolina Press|isbn=978-0-8078-5772-4|page=320 pages}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The population of Cuba in 1817 was 630,980, of which 291,021 were white, 115,691 [[free people of color]] (mixed-race), and 224,268 black slaves.&lt;ref name = "Scheina 2003 352"&gt;{{Harvnb|Scheina|2003|p=352}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This was a much higher proportion of free blacks to slaves than in [[Virginia]], for instance, or the other Caribbean islands. Historians such as Swedish Magnus Mõrner, who studied slavery in Latin America, found that [[manumission]]s increased when slave economies were in decline, as in 18th-century Cuba and early 19th-century Maryland of the United States.&lt;ref name="drimmer"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Magnus Mõrner, ''Race Mixture in Latin America'', Boston, 1967, pp. 124–125&lt;/ref&gt;

In part due to Cuban slaves working primarily in urbanized settings, by the 19th century, there had developed the practice of ''coartacion'', or "buying oneself out of slavery", a "uniquely Cuban development", according to historian Herbert S. Klein.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert S. Klein, ''Slavery in the Americas: A Comparative Study of Virginia and Cuba'', Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1967, p. 196&lt;/ref&gt; Due to a shortage of white labor, blacks dominated urban industries "to such an extent that when whites in large numbers came to Cuba in the middle of the nineteenth century, they were unable to displace Negro workers."&lt;ref name="drimmer"/&gt; A system of diversified agriculture, with small farms and fewer slaves, served to supply the cities with produce and other goods.&lt;ref name="drimmer"/&gt;

In the 1820s, when the rest of Spain's empire in [[Latin America]] rebelled and formed independent states, Cuba remained loyal. Its economy was based on serving the empire.{{explain|date=December 2017}} By 1860, Cuba had 213,167 free people of color, 39% of its non-white population of 550,000.&lt;ref name="drimmer"/&gt; By contrast, Virginia, with about the same number of blacks, had only 58,042 or 11% who were free; the rest were enslaved.&lt;ref name="drimmer"/&gt; In the [[Antebellum South|antebellum]] years, after [[Nat Turner's Slave Rebellion]] of 1831, Virginia discouraged manumissions and strengthened restrictions against free blacks, as did other Southern states. In addition, there was a high demand for slaves, and Virginia planters sold many in the internal domestic slave trade, who were shipped or taken overland to the [[Deep South]], which had greatly expanded its cotton production.

[[File:Carlos Manuel de Cespedes.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Carlos Manuel de Céspedes]] is known as ''Father of the Homeland'' in Cuba, having declared the nation's independence from Spain in 1868.]]
Full independence from Spain was the goal of a rebellion in 1868 led by planter [[Carlos Manuel de Céspedes]]. De Céspedes, a sugar planter, freed his slaves to fight with him for an independent Cuba. On 27 December 1868, he issued a decree condemning slavery in theory but accepting it in practice and declaring free any slaves whose masters present them for military service.{{sfn|Chomsky|Carr|Smorkaloff|2004|pp=[https://books.google.com/books?id=Sr2hQkCIihMC&amp;pg=PA115 115–7]}} The 1868 rebellion resulted in a prolonged conflict known as the [[Ten Years' War]].

Around 200,000 Spanish troops outnumbered the much smaller rebel army, which relied mostly on [[guerrilla]] and [[sabotage]] tactics. The Spaniards began a campaign of suppression. General [[Valeriano Weyler]], military governor of Cuba, herded the rural population into what he called ''reconcentrados'', described by international observers as "fortified towns".

By late 1958 the rebels had broken out of the Sierra Maestra and launched a general popular insurrection. After Castro's fighters captured [[Santa Clara, Cuba|Santa Clara]], Batista fled with his family to the Dominican Republic on 1 January 1959. Later he went into exile on the Portuguese island of Madeira and finally settled in Estoril, near Lisbon. Fidel Castro's forces entered the capital on 8 January 1959. The liberal [[Manuel Urrutia Lleó]] became the provisional president.&lt;ref name = "Falk 1988 67"&gt;{{Harvnb|Falk|1988|p=67}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1959 to 1966 Cuban insurgents fought a [[War against the Bandits|six-year rebellion]] in the [[Escambray Mountains]] against the Castro government.

Cuba is considered an [[authoritarian]] regime according to the 2016 [[Democracy Index]]&lt;ref name="index2016"&gt;{{cite web|title=Democracy Index 2016: Revenge of the 'deplorables' |url=https://www.eiu.com/public/topical_report.aspx?campaignid=DemocracyIndex2016|website=eiu.com |publisher=The Economist Intelligence Unit|access-date=20 July 2017|date=25 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 2017 [[Freedom in the World]] survey.&lt;ref&gt;[https://freedomhouse.org/sites/default/files/Country%20Status%20%26%20Ratings%20Overview%2C%201973-2016.pdf "Country Status and ratings overview"], ''Freedom in the World 1973–2016'', Freedom House.

In February 2013, Cuban president Raúl Castro announced he would resign in 2018, ending his five-year term, and that he hopes to implement permanent term limits for future Cuban Presidents, including age limits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2013/02/24/cuba-president-castro-parliament/1943365/ |title=Cuba's Raul Castro announces retirement in 5 years |work=USA Today |date=February 25, 2013 |accessdate=April 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Fidel Castro died on 25 November 2016, the Cuban government declared a nine-day mourning period. During the mourning period Cuban citizens were prohibited from playing loud music, partying, and drinking alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/03/world/americas/a-nation-in-mourning-images-of-cuba-after-fidel-castro.html |title=A Nation in Mourning: Images of Cuba After Fidel Castro|last=Lima|first=Tomas Munita, Mauricio|date=December 3, 2016 |newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=February 7, 2017 |last2=Ahmed|first2=Azam|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Administrative divisions===
{{Main|Provinces of Cuba|Municipalities of Cuba}}

The country is subdivided into 15 provinces and one special municipality (Isla de la Juventud). These were formerly part of six larger historical provinces: Pinar del Río, Habana, Matanzas, Las Villas, Camagüey and Oriente. The present subdivisions closely resemble those of the Spanish military provinces during the Cuban Wars of Independence, when the most troublesome areas were subdivided. The provinces are divided into municipalities.

[[Cuban dissidents]] face arrest and imprisonment.

The Cuban state claims to adhere to [[socialist]] principles in organizing its largely state-controlled [[planned economy]]. Most of the means of production are owned and run by the government and most of the labor force is employed by the state. Recent years have seen a trend toward more private sector employment. By 2006, public sector employment was 78% and private sector 22%, compared to 91.8% to 8.2% in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfamamerica.org/newsandpublications/publications/research_reports/art3670.html/OA-Cuba_Social_Policy_at_Crossroads-en.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009163422/http://www.oxfamamerica.org/newsandpublications/publications/research_reports/art3670.html/OA-Cuba_Social_Policy_at_Crossroads-en.pdf|archivedate=October 9, 2007|title=Social Policy at the crossroads|format=PDF|publisher=oxfamamerica.org|accessdate=February 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Government spending is 78.1% of GDP.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reference.com/government-politics/countries-planned-economy-3f07e563b79708ba#|title=What countries have a planned economy?|newspaper=Reference|access-date=October 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any firm that hires a Cuban must pay the Cuban government, which in turn  pays the employee in Cuban pesos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/legacy/reports/1999/cuba/Cuba996-01.htm#P392_35421|title=Cuba's repressive machinery: Summary and recommendations|publisher=Human Rights Watch|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; The average monthly wage {{as of|2013|July|lc=y}} is 466 [[Cuban pesos]]—about US$19.&lt;ref name=moneytalk/&gt;

Before Fidel Castro's 1959 revolution, Cuba was one of the most advanced and successful countries in Latin America.&lt;ref name="pbs.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/castro/peopleevents/e_precastro.html|title=American Experience – Fidel Castro – People &amp; Events |publisher=PBS|accessdate=December 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cuba's capital, Havana, was a "glittering and dynamic city".&lt;ref name="pbs.org"/&gt; The country's economy in the early part of the century, fuelled by the sale of sugar to the United States, had grown wealthy. Cuba ranked 5th in the hemisphere in per capita income, 3rd in life expectancy, 2nd in per capita ownership of automobiles and telephones, and 1st in the number of television sets per inhabitant. Cuba's literacy rate, 76%, was the fourth highest in Latin America. Cuba also ranked 11th in the world in the number of doctors per capita. Several private clinics and hospitals provided services for the poor. Cuba's income distribution compared favorably with that of other Latin American societies. However, income inequality was profound between city and countryside, especially between whites and blacks. Cubans lived in abysmal poverty in the countryside. According to PBS, a thriving middle class held the promise of prosperity and social mobility.&lt;ref name="pbs.org"/&gt; According to Cuba historian Louis Perez of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, "Havana was then what Las Vegas has become."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/before-the-revolution-159682020/|title=Before the Revolution|author=Natasha Geiling|work=Smithsonian|accessdate=December 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, the Miami Herald wrote, "... about 27 percent of Cubans earn under $50 per month; 34 percent earn the equivalent of $50 to $100 per month; and 20 percent earn $101 to $200.

After the Cuban revolution and before the collapse of the Soviet Union, Cuba depended on Moscow for substantial aid and sheltered markets for its exports. The loss of these subsidies sent the Cuban economy into a rapid depression known in Cuba as the [[Special Period]]. Cuba took limited free market-oriented measures to alleviate severe shortages of food, consumer goods, and services. These steps included allowing some self-employment in certain retail and light manufacturing sectors, the legalization of the use of the [[US dollar]] in business, and the encouragement of [[Tourism in Cuba|tourism]]. Cuba has developed a unique urban farm system called ''[[organopónicos]]'' to compensate for the end of food imports from the Soviet Union. The [[United States embargo against Cuba|U.S. embargo]] against Cuba was instituted in response to nationalization of U.S.-citizen-held property and was maintained at the premise of perceived human rights violations. It is widely viewed that the embargo hurt the Cuban economy. In 2009, the Cuban Government estimated this loss at $685 million annually.&lt;ref name="dollarsandsense.org"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dollarsandsense.org/archives/2009/0309pepper.html|title=The Costs of the Embargo {{!}} Dollars &amp; Sense|website=dollarsandsense.org|access-date=October 18, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
{{Main|Geography of Cuba}}
[[File:Cuba rel94.jpg|thumb|A general map of Cuba]]
Cuba is an [[archipelago]] of islands located in the northern [[Caribbean Sea]] at the confluence with the [[Gulf of Mexico]] and the Atlantic Ocean. It lies between latitudes [[19th parallel north|19°]] and [[24th parallel north|24°N]], and longitudes [[74th meridian west|74°]] and [[85th meridian west|85°W]]. The United States lies 150 kilometers (93 miles) across the [[Straits of Florida]] to the north and northwest (to the closest tip of [[Key West, Florida]]), and [[the Bahamas]] 21&amp;nbsp;km (13&amp;nbsp;mi) to the north. [[Mexico]] lies 210 kilometers (130 miles) across the [[Yucatán Channel]] to the west (to the closest tip of [[Cabo Catoche]] in the State of [[Quintana Roo]]).

[[Haiti]] is 77&amp;nbsp;km (48&amp;nbsp;mi) to the east, [[Jamaica]] (140&amp;nbsp;km/87&amp;nbsp;mi) and the [[Cayman Islands]] to the south. Cuba is the principal island, surrounded by four smaller groups of islands: the [[Colorados Archipelago]] on the northwestern coast, the [[Sabana-Camagüey Archipelago]] on the north-central Atlantic coast, the [[Jardines de la Reina]] on the south-central coast and the [[Canarreos Archipelago]] on the southwestern coast.

[[File:Sierra Maestra panorama1.jpg|thumb|[[Sierra Maestra]] ]] 
The main island, named Cuba, is {{convert|1250|km|abbr=on}} long, constituting most of the nation's land area ({{convert|104556|km2|abbr=on|0}}) and is the largest island in the [[Caribbean]] and [[List of islands by area|17th-largest island]] in the world by land area. The main island consists mostly of flat to rolling plains apart from the [[Sierra Maestra]] mountains in the southeast, whose highest point is [[Pico Turquino]] ({{convert|1974|m|abbr=on}}).

The second-largest island is [[Isla de la Juventud]] (Isle of Youth) in the Canarreos archipelago, with an area of {{convert|2200|km2|abbr=on|0}}. Cuba has an official area (land area) of {{convert|109884|km2|abbr=on|0}}. Its area is {{convert|110860|km2|abbr=on|0}} including coastal and territorial waters.

===Climate===
{{Main|Climate of Cuba}}
[[File:Valle vinales 1.jpg|thumb|[[Viñales Valley]] ]]
With the entire island south of the [[Tropic of Cancer]], the local climate is tropical, moderated by northeasterly trade winds that blow year-round. The temperature is also shaped by the Caribbean current, which brings in warm water from the equator. This makes the climate of Cuba warmer than that of [[Hong Kong]], which is at around the same latitude as Cuba but has a subtropical rather than a tropical climate. In general (with local variations), there is a drier season from November to April, and a rainier season from May to October. The average temperature is {{convert|21|°C|1}} in January and {{convert|27|°C|1}} in July. The warm temperatures of the Caribbean Sea and the fact that Cuba sits across the entrance to the [[Gulf of Mexico]] combine to make the country prone to frequent [[Tropical cyclone|hurricanes]]. These are most common in September and October.

[[Hurricane Irma]] hit the island on 8 September 2017, with winds of 260 kilometres per hour,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2017/09/hurricane-irma-landfall-cuba-category-5-170909040746649.html|title=Florida braces for Hurricane Irma after Cuba landfall|website=www.aljazeera.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the Camagüey Archipelago; the storm reached Ciego de Avila province around midnight and continued to pound Cuba the next day.&lt;ref&gt;https://beta.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/hurricane-irma-rips-through-cuba-on-its-way-to-florida/article36221350/{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The worst damage was in the keys north of the main island. Hospitals, warehouses and factories were damaged; much of the north coast was without electricity. By that time, nearly a million people, including tourists, had been evacuated.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt; The [[Varadero]] resort area also reported widespread damage; the government believed that repairs could be completed before the start of the main tourist season.&lt;ref name="cnn.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/09/11/americas/irma-cuba/index.html|title=Irma kills 10 people in Cuba|first=Hilary Clarke and Patrick Oppmann,|last=CNN|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent reports indicated that 10 people had been killed during the storm, including seven in Havana, most during building collapses.

===Biodiversity===
[[File:Large group of american crocodiles.jpg|thumbnail|Large group of [[American crocodile]]s in Cuba]]
Cuba signed the Rio [[Convention on Biological Diversity]] on 12 June 1992, and became a party to the convention on 8 March 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbd.int/convention/parties/list/ |title=List of Parties |work=cbd.int}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has subsequently produced a [[Biodiversity action plan|National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan]], with one revision, that the convention received on 24 January 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbd.int/doc/world/cu/cu-nbsap-v2-es.pdf |title=Plan de Acción Nacional 2006/2010 sobre la Diversidad Biológica. República de Cuba |work=cbd.int}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The revision comprises an action plan with time limits for each item, and an indication of the governmental body responsible for delivery. That document contains virtually no information about biodiversity. However, the country's fourth national report to the [[Convention on Biological Diversity|CBD]] contains a detailed breakdown of the numbers of species of each kingdom of life recorded from Cuba, the main groups being: [[animal]]s (17,801 species), [[bacteria]] (270), [[chromista]] (707), [[fungi]], including [[lichen]]-forming species (5844), [[plant]]s (9107) and [[protozoa]] (1440).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbd.int/doc/world/cu/cu-nr-04-es.pdf |title=IV Informe Nacional al Convento sobre la Diversidad Biológica. República de Cuba. 2009 |work=cbd.int}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As elsewhere in the world, vertebrate animals and flowering plants are well documented, so the recorded numbers of species are probably close to the true numbers. For most or all other groups, the true numbers of species occurring in Cuba are likely to exceed, often considerably, the numbers recorded so far.

According to the official census of 2010, Cuba's population was 11,241,161, comprising 5,628,996 men and 5,612,165 women.&lt;ref name="cubacensus2010"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.one.cu/publicaciones/cepde/anuario_2010/anuario_demografico_2010.pdf |title=ANUARIO DEMOGRAFICO DE CUBA 2010 |publisher=Oficina Nacional de Estadisticas}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its [[birth rate]] (9.88 births per thousand population in 2006)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thepeninsulaqatar.com/Display_news.asp?section=World_News&amp;subsection=Americas&amp;month=May2007&amp;file=World_News2007051741913.xml|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926222652/http://www.thepeninsulaqatar.com/Display_news.asp?section=World_News&amp;subsection=Americas&amp;month=May2007&amp;file=World_News2007051741913.xml|archivedate=September 26, 2007 |title=Population, birth rate falling in Cuba: Official |publisher=The Peninsula On-line |date= |accessdate=July 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; is one of the lowest in the [[Western Hemisphere]]. Although the country's population has grown by about four million people since 1961, the rate of growth slowed during that period, and the population began to decline in 2006, due in the country's low [[fertility rate]] (1.43 children per woman) coupled with emigration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.periodico26.cu/english/features/june2008/cuba-population060508.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090113074404/http://www.periodico26.cu/english/features/june2008/cuba-population060508.html|archivedate=January 13, 2009 |title=Population Decrease Must be Reverted |publisher=Wayback.archive.org |date= |accessdate=July 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indeed, this drop in fertility is among the largest in the Western Hemisphere&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|year=1997|url=https://www.un.org/esa/population/pubsarchive/fer/ffer.htm|title=United Nations World Fertility Patterns 1997|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=July 9, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is attributed largely to unrestricted access to legal abortion: Cuba's abortion rate was 58.6 per 1000 pregnancies in 1996, compared to an average of 35 in the Caribbean, 27 in Latin America overall, and 48 in Europe. Similarly, the use of [[contraception|contraceptives]] is also widespread, estimated at 79% of the female population (in the upper third of countries in the Western Hemisphere).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/25s3099.html|title=The Incidence of Abortion Worldwide|author1=Stanley K. Henshaw |author2=Susheela Singh |author3=Taylor Haas |work=International Family Planning Perspectives, 1999, 25(Supplement):S30 – S38|accessdate=May 11, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethnoracial groups===
Cuba's population is multiethnic, reflecting its complex colonial origins. Intermarriage between diverse groups is widespread, and consequently there is some discrepancy in reports of the country's racial composition: whereas the Institute for Cuban and Cuban-American Studies at the [[University of Miami]] determined that 62% of Cubans are black,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/multimedia/news/afrolatin/part4/index.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130821113550/http://www.miamiherald.com/multimedia/news/afrolatin/part4/index.html|archivedate=August 21, 2013|title=A barrier for Cuba's blacks|publisher=Miami Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt; the 2002 Cuban census found that a similar proportion of the population, 65.05%, was white.

In fact, the [[Minority Rights Group International]] determined that "An objective assessment of the situation of [[Afro-Cuban]]s remains problematic due to scant records and a paucity of systematic studies both pre- and post-revolution. Estimates of the percentage of people of African descent in the Cuban population vary enormously, ranging from 34% to 62%".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/docid/49749d342c.html|title=World Directory of Minorities and Indigenous Peoples – Cuba: Afro-Cubans}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2014 study found that, based on [[Ancestry-informative marker|ancestry informative markers]] (AIM), [[autosome|autosomal]] genetic ancestry in Cuba is 72% European, 20% African, and 8% Indigenous.&lt;ref name="plosgenetics.org"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pgen.1004488#pgen-1004488-g001|doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1004488|pmid=25058410|pmc=4109857|title=Cuba: Exploring the History of Admixture and the Genetic Basis of Pigmentation Using Autosomal and Uniparental Markers|journal=PLoS Genetics|volume=10|issue=7|pages=e1004488|year=2014|last1=Marcheco-Teruel|first1=Beatriz|last2=Parra|first2=Esteban J.|last3=Fuentes-Smith|first3=Evelyn|last4=Salas|first4=Antonio|last5=Buttenschøn|first5=Henriette N.|last6=Demontis|first6=Ditte|last7=Torres-Español|first7=María|last8=Marín-Padrón|first8=Lilia C.|last9=Gómez-Cabezas|first9=Enrique J.|last10=Álvarez-Iglesias|first10=Vanesa|last11=Mosquera-Miguel|first11=Ana|last12=Martínez-Fuentes|first12=Antonio|last13=Carracedo|first13=Ángel|last14=Børglum|first14=Anders D.|last15=Mors|first15=Ole}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 35% of maternal lineages derive from Cuban Indigenous People, compared to 39% from Africa and 26% from Europe, but male lineages were European (82%) and African (18%), indicating a historical bias towards mating between foreign men and native women rather than the inverse.&lt;ref name="plosgenetics.org"/&gt;

===Immigration and emigration===
{{Main|Spanish immigration to Cuba}}
Immigration and emigration have played a prominent part in Cuba's demographic profile. Between the 18th and early 20th century, large waves of [[Canarian people|Canarian]], [[Catalans|Catalan]], [[Andalusians|Andalusian]], [[Galician people|Galician]], and other Spanish people immigrated to Cuba. Between 1899–1930 alone, close to a million Spaniards entered the country, though many would eventually return to Spain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tau.ac.il/eial/IV_2/bejarano.htm |title=La inmigración entre 1902 y 1920 |publisher=Tau.ac.il |date= |accessdate=November 7, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090606060146/http://www.tau.ac.il/eial/IV_2/bejarano.htm |archivedate=June 6, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other prominent immigrant groups included French,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cubagenweb.org/french/index.htm#refugees |title=Etat des propriétés rurales appartenant à des Français dans l'île de Cuba |publisher=Cuban Genealogy Center |date=July 10, 2007 |accessdate=July 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]], [[Italian people|Italian]], [[Russians|Russian]], [[Dutch people|Dutch]], [[Greeks|Greek]], [[British people|British]], and [[Irish people|Irish]], as well as small number of descendants of U.S. citizens who arrived in Cuba in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

Post-revolution Cuba has been characterized by significant levels of emigration, which has led to a [[Cuban exile|large and influential diaspora community]]. During the three decades after January 1959, more than one million Cubans of all social classes — constituting 10% of the total population — [[Cuban migration to Miami|emigrated to the United States]], a proportion that matches the extent of emigration to the U.S. from the Caribbean as a whole during that period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Powell |first=John |url=https://books.google.com/?id=VNCX6UsdZYkC&amp;pg=PA68&amp;dq=%22cubans+are+usually+considered+to+be+the+most+successful%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22cubans%20are%20usually%20considered%20to%20be%20the%20most%20successful%22|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of North American Immigration|pages=68–71|title=Cuban immigration |publisher=Facts on File |date=2005 |accessdate=November 30, 2016|isbn=9781438110127 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Pedraza 2007 ?"&gt;{{Harvnb|Pedraza|2007|p=?}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Falk 1988 74"&gt;{{Harvnb|Falk|1988|p=74}}: "[A] tenth of the entire Caribbean population has .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.

Those who left the country typically did so by sea, in small boats and fragile rafts. On 9 September 1994, the U.S. and Cuban governments agreed that the U.S. would grant at least 20,000 visas annually in exchange for Cuba's pledge to prevent further unlawful departures on boats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gao.gov/archive/1995/ns95211.pdf|title=CUBA: U.S. Response to the 1994 Cuban Migration Crisis|publisher=U.S. General Accounting Office|date=September 1995|accessdate=September 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===
{{Main|Religion in Cuba}}
[[File:2012-Catedral de San Cristobal anagoria 01.JPG|thumb|[[Havana Cathedral]] ]]
In 2010, the [[Pew Forum]] estimated that religious affiliation in Cuba is 65% Christian (60% [[Roman Catholic]] or about 6.9 million in 2016, 5% [[Protestant]] or about 575,000 in 2016), 23% unaffiliated, 17% [[folk religion]] (such as [[santería]]), and the remaining 0.4% consisting of other religions.&lt;ref name=pewrel&gt;{{cite web|title=Religious Composition by Country|url=http://www.pewforum.org/uploadedFiles/Topics/Religious_Affiliation/globalReligion-tables.pdf|work=Global Religious Landscape|publisher=Pew Forum|accessdate=July 9, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cuba is officially a secular state. Religious freedom increased through the 1980s,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Smith|1996|p=105}}: "The expansion of religious liberty began more than a decade ago, for example, and Cuban citizens, by and large, are free to practice their faiths without fear of persecution."&lt;/ref&gt; with the government amending the constitution in 1992 to drop the state's characterization as atheistic.&lt;ref name = "Domínguez 2003 4"&gt;{{Harvnb|Domínguez|2003|p=4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roman Catholicism]] is the largest religion, with its origins in Spanish colonization. Despite less than half of the population identifying as Catholics in 2006, it nonetheless remains the dominant faith.&lt;ref name=catholic&gt;{{cite web|url=http://natcath.org/NCR_Online/archives2/2006a/033106/033106o.php|title=Catholic church in Cuba strives to re-establish the faith|author=David Einhorn|publisher=National Catholic Reporter|date=March 31, 2006|accessdate=September 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pope John Paul II and Pope Benedict XVI visited Cuba in 1998 and 2011, respectively, and Pope Francis visited Cuba in September 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2015/sep/21/pope-francis-in-cuba-pontiff-to-hold-mass-in-holguins-revolution-square-live|title=Pope Francis in Cuba: pontiff arrives in Santiago – as it happened|last=Woolf|first=Nicky|last2=Am|website=the Guardian|access-date=March 21, 2016|last3=Holpuch|first3=a|last4=York|first4=Angela Bruno in New|last5=Havana|first5=with Jonathan Watts in|last6=Rome|first6=Stephanie Kirchgaessner in}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cuba to Free 3,500 Prisoners Ahead of Pope Visit|url=http://www.voanews.com/content/cuba-pope-francis-visit-prisoners-amnesty/2959896.html|website=voanews.com|publisher=Voice of America|accessdate=September 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to each papal visit, the Cuban government pardoned prisoners as a humanitarian gesture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Miroff|first1=Nick|title=Cuba pardons more than 3,500 prisoners ahead of Pope Francis visit|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/the_americas/cuba-pardons-more-than-3500-prisoners-ahead-of-pope-francis-visit/2015/09/11/5e1c1f27-ab63-444f-98ca-fff75cb92d3b_story.html|website=washingtonpost.com|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=September 11, 2015|date=September 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Alexander|first1=Harriett|title=Cuba pardons 3,522 prisoners ahead of Pope Francis visit|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/centralamericaandthecaribbean/cuba/11858266/Cuba-pardons-3522-prisoners-ahead-of-Pope-Francis-visit.html|website=telegraph.co.uk|publisher=The Telegraph|accessdate=September 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The government's relaxation of restrictions on [[house church]]es in the 1990s led to an explosion of [[Pentecostalism]], with some groups claiming as many as 100,000 members. However, [[Evangelical Protestant]] denominations, organized into the umbrella Cuban Council of Churches, remain much more vibrant and powerful.&lt;ref name="Edmonds"&gt;{{cite book | last=Edmonds | first=E.B. | last2=Gonzalez | first2=M.A. | title=Caribbean Religious History: An Introduction | publisher=NYU Press | year=2010 | isbn=978-0-8147-2250-3 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oFQ65RzBm5wC&amp;pg=PA171| page=171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The religious landscape of Cuba is also strongly defined by [[syncretisms]] of various kinds. Christianity is often practiced in tandem with [[Santería]], a mixture of Catholicism and mostly African faiths, which include a number of cults. La Virgen de la Caridad del Cobre (the Virgin of ''Cobre'') is the Catholic patroness of Cuba, and a symbol of Cuban culture. In Santería, she has been syncretized with the goddess [[Oshun]].

Cuba also hosts small communities of [[Jews]] (500 in 2012), [[Muslims]], and members of the [[Bahá'í]] Faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=June 13, 2005|url=http://news.bahai.org/story.cfm?storyid=377|title=Government officials visit Baha'i center|publisher=Baha'iWorldNewsService.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several well-known Cuban religious figures have operated outside the island, including the &lt;!-- charismatic Pentecostal preacher Lazaro Santana&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/29946974/|title=The Ogden Standard-Examiner from Ogden, Utah · Page 10|work=Newspapers.com|accessdate=December 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and --&gt; humanitarian and author [[Jorge Armando Pérez]].

==Culture==
{{Main|Culture of Cuba}} 
[[File:Casa de la Trova Santiago Cuba.jpg|thumb|left|A local musical house, Casa de la Trova in Santiago de Cuba]]
Cuban culture is influenced by its melting pot of cultures, primarily those of Spain and Africa. After the 1959 revolution, the government started a national literacy campaign, offered free education to all and established rigorous sports, ballet and music programs.&lt;ref name=hsas&gt;{{cite news|title=For Cuba, a Harsh Self-Assessment|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/24/world/americas/harsh-self-assessment-as-cuba-looks-within.html|publisher=NYTimes.com|accessdate=July 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Music===
{{double image|right|Gloria Estefan 2009.jpg|100|Celia Cruz 1.jpg|100|[[Gloria Estefan]] and [[Celia Cruz]]}}
{{Main|Music of Cuba}}
Cuban music is very rich and is the most commonly known expression of Cuban culture. The central form of this music is [[Son (music)|Son]], which has been the basis of many other musical styles like "[[Danzón]] de nuevo ritmo", [[mambo (music)|mambo]], [[cha-cha-cha (music)|cha-cha-chá]] and [[salsa music]]. Rumba ("de cajón o de solar") music originated in the early Afro-Cuban culture, mixed with Hispanic elements of style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Moore|first=Robin|title=Nationalizing Blackness: Afrocubanismo and Artistic Revolution in Havana, 1920–1940|year=1997|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press|isbn=978-0-8229-5645-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Tres (musical instrument)|Tres]] was invented in Cuba from Hispanic cordophone instruments models (the instrument is actually a fusion of elements from the Spanish guitar and lute). Other traditional Cuban instruments are of African origin, [[Neo-Taíno nations|Taíno]] origin, or both, such as the [[maraca]]s, [[güiro]], [[marímbula]] and various wooden drums including the [[mayohuacán]].

Popular Cuban music of all styles has been enjoyed and praised widely across the world. Cuban classical music, which includes music with strong African and European influences, and features symphonic works as well as music for soloists, has received international acclaim thanks to composers like [[Ernesto Lecuona]]. Havana was the heart of the [[rap]] scene in Cuba when it began in the 1990s.

During that time, [[reggaetón]] grew in popularity. In 2011, the Cuban state denounced reggaeton as degenerate, directed reduced "low-profile" airplay of the genre (but did not ban it entirely) and banned the megahit ''Chupi Chupi'' by [[Osmani García]], characterizing its description of sex as "the sort which a prostitute would carry out."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Victor Kaonga, Malawi |url=http://globalvoicesonline.org/2011/12/07/cuba-reggaeton-hit-chupi-chupi-denounced-by-authorities/ |title=Cuba: Reggaeton Hit 'Chupi Chupi' Denounced by Authorities |publisher=Global Voices |date=December 7, 2011 |accessdate=July 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2012, the Cuban government officially banned sexually explicit reggaeton songs and music videos from radio and television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Scott Shetler |url=http://popcrush.com/cuban-government-censor-reggaeton-sexually-explicit/ |title=Cuban Government to Censor Reggaeton For Being "Sexually Explicit" |publisher=Popcrush.com |date=December 7, 2012 |accessdate=July 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/cuba-bans-reggaeton-sexually-explicit-songs/story?id=17888666 |title=Cuban Government Censors Reggaeton and "Sexually Explicit" Songs |publisher=ABC News |date=December 6, 2012 |accessdate=July 19, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cuisine===
{{Main|Cuban cuisine}}
[[File:Cubanfood.jpg|thumb|A traditional meal of ''ropa vieja'' (shredded flank steak in a tomato sauce base), black beans, yellow rice, plantains and fried yuca with beer]]
[[File:La Havane (1) Tamales pliés.jpg|thumb|Cuban-style tamales]]
Cuban cuisine is a fusion of [[Spanish cuisine|Spanish]] and [[Caribbean cuisine]]s. Cuban recipes share spices and techniques with Spanish cooking, with some Caribbean influence in spice and flavor. Food rationing, which has been the norm in Cuba for the last four decades, restricts the common availability of these dishes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Alvarez|2001}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The traditional Cuban meal is not served in courses; all food items are served at the same time.

The typical meal could consist of plantains, black beans and rice, ''[[ropa vieja]]'' (shredded beef), [[Cuban bread]], pork with onions, and tropical fruits. Black beans and rice, referred to as ''[[Moros y Cristianos (food)|moros y cristianos]]'' (or ''moros'' for short), and plantains are staples of the Cuban diet. Many of the meat dishes are cooked slowly with light sauces. Garlic, cumin, oregano, and bay leaves are the dominant spices.

===Literature===
{{Main|Cuban literature}}
Cuban literature began to find its voice in the early 19th century. Dominant themes of independence and freedom were exemplified by José Martí, who led the Modernist movement in Cuban literature. Writers such as [[Nicolás Guillén]] and [[José Z. Tallet]] focused on literature as social protest. The poetry and novels of [[Dulce María Loynaz]] and [[José Lezama Lima]] have been influential. Romanticist [[Miguel Barnet]], who wrote ''Everyone Dreamed of Cuba'', reflects a more melancholy Cuba.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070214100357/http://www.tobias-hauser.de/vortraege/?cmd=en Costa Rica – Journey into the Tropical Garden of Eden], Tobias Hauser.{{Unreliable source?|date=September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alejo Carpentier]] was important in the [[Magic realism]] movement. Writers such as [[Reinaldo Arenas]], [[Guillermo Cabrera Infante]], and more recently [[Daína Chaviano]], [[Pedro Juan Gutiérrez]], [[Zoé Valdés]], [[Guillermo Rosales]] and [[Leonardo Padura]] have earned international recognition in the post-revolutionary era, though many of these writers have felt compelled to continue their work in exile due to ideological control of media by the Cuban authorities.

===Dance===
Dance holds a privileged position in Cuban culture. [[Popular dance]] is considered an essential part of life, and [[concert dance]] is supported by the government and includes internationally renowned companies such as the [[Ballet Nacional de Cuba]].&lt;ref name="Johnn"&gt;{{cite book | last=John | first=S. | title=Contemporary Dance in Cuba: Tecnica Cubana as Revolutionary Movement | publisher=McFarland &amp; Company | year=2012 | isbn=978-0-7864-9325-8 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=drE0KI3h-7UC&amp;pg=PA23 | page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to historical associations with the United States, many Cubans participate in sports that are popular in North America, rather than sports traditionally played in other Latin American nations. [[Baseball in Cuba|Baseball]] is the most popular. Other sports and pastimes include [[association football|football]], [[basketball]], [[volleyball]], [[cricket]], and [[track and field athletics|athletics]]. Cuba is a dominant force in [[amateur boxing]], consistently achieving high medal tallies in major international competitions. Cuban boxers are not permitted to turn professional by their government.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1667">The '''Danish Sale of Goods Act''' ({{lang-da|Købeloven}}; Consolidation Act number 237 of March 28, 2003) lays down various rules of [[trade]] between companies (commercial sale) and between companies and consumers ([[consumer]] sale).

==Main points==
* Overdue delivery or [[Product defect|defective]] goods are considered [[breach of contract|breaches of contract]] on the seller's part.
* Overdue payment or non-payment are considered main breaches of contract on the buyer's part.
* Seller's breach of contract may cause the customer to claim [[damages]], rescind the [[contract of sale]] or demand goods delivered to replace the defective ones.
* The rules of commercial sale are the most restrictive ones. 
* Any delay usually makes it possible for the customer to rescind the contract of sale or claim damages (if the goods have to be purchased elsewhere at a higher price). 
* Defective goods of any kind must immediately be reported to the seller. 
* The Sale of Goods Act's provisions on defective goods and overdue delivery can be departed from through terms of sale and delivery. However, most trades have set forth individual customs impeding full disclaimer of any provisions. Otherwise, they will never see any customers.&lt;ref&gt;''Terms of Sale and Delivery'' 100svar.dk "Site for new business owners in Denmark" [http://www.100svar.dk/laering_frame.asp?id=48&amp;sprog=UK]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dragobete''' is a traditional [[Romanians|Romanian]] holiday celebrated on [[February 24]]. Dragobete was the son of [[Baba Dochia]], which stands for the main character in the pagan myth related to spring arrival and the end of the harsh winter. Due to his endless kindness he was chosen – according to some sources, by Virgin Mary – to be the Guardian of [[Love]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.rolandia.eu/dragobete-celebrating-love-romanian-style/|title=Dragobete ’s Day - Celebrating love in the Romanian style|website=Romania Tours|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The day is particularly known as "the day when the birds are betrothed". It is around this time that the birds begin to build their nests and mate. On this day, considered locally the first day of spring, boys and girls gather vernal flowers and sing together. Maidens used to collect the snow that lay on the ground in many villages and then melt it, using the water in magic potions throughout the rest of the year. Those who take part in Dragobete customs are supposed to be protected from illness, especially fevers, for the rest of the year. If the weather allows, girls and boys pick [[snowdrop]]s or other early spring plants for the person they are courting. In Romania, Dragobete is known as a day for lovers, rather like [[Valentine's Day]].

It is a common belief in some parts of Romania that, during this celebration, stepping over a partner's foot leads to the dominant role in the relationship. Dragobete customs vary from region to region.

In the countryside there is an old tradition with girls and boys going into the woods to pick flowers. When they return home, the traditions says that boys were running after girls to kiss them. If the girl liked the boy she lets him kiss her. There is a saying in [[Romania]] that makes a lot of sense regarding this: "Dragobete kisses the girls".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://biancamaraa.wordpress.com/2016/02/24/romanian-traditions-dragobetele-saruta-fetele/|title=Romanian Traditions, Dragobetele saruta fetele!|last=Mara|first=Bianca|website=B. Fabulous!|access-date=2016-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In neighbouring [[Bulgaria]], the custom of stepping over one's partner's feet traditionally takes place during weddings with the same purpose, but it is not believed to be connected to Dragobete.

{{Contains Vietnamese text}}

The "'''East Asian cultural sphere'''" or "'''Sinosphere'''", refers to a grouping of countries and regions in [[East Asia]] that were historically influenced by the [[Chinese culture]]. Other names for the concept include the '''Sinic world''', the '''Confucian world''', the '''Taoist world''', and the '''Chinese cultural sphere''', though the last is also used to refer particularly to the '''[[Sinophone]] world''': the areas which speak [[varieties of Chinese]].

The [[East Asia]]n cultural sphere shares a Confucian ethical philosophy, [[Buddhism]], [[Taoism]] and, historically, a [[Adoption of Chinese literary culture|common writing system]]. The core regions of the East Asian cultural sphere are [[Mainland China]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Macau]], [[Taiwan]], [[North Korea]], [[South Korea]], [[Japan]], and [[Vietnam]].

The terms East Asian cultural sphere and "''Chinese character ([[Chinese character|Hànzì]]) cultural sphere''" are used interchangeably with "''Sinosphere''" but have different denotations.

== Academic usage ==

=== Arnold J. Toynbee ===
The British historian [[Arnold J. Toynbee]] listed the Far Eastern civilization as one of the main civilizations outlined in his book, ''A Study of History''. He included Japan and Korea in his Far Eastern civilization, and proposed that it grew out of the Sinic civilization that originated in the [[Yellow River]] basin.&lt;ref name="Sun p.154"&gt;{{cite book |first = Lung-kee |last = Sun |title = The Chinese National Character: From Nationalhood to Individuality |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=O9_U-XdJ3iYC&amp;pg=PA154 |year=2002 |publisher = M.E. Sharpe |ISBN =978-0-7656-3936-3 |page = 154}}&lt;/ref&gt; Toynbee compared the relationship between the Sinic and Far Eastern civilization with that of the Hellenic and Western civilizations. According to Toynbee, the Hellenic and Western civilizations had an "apparentation-affiliation" relationship, while the Far Eastern world was controlled by the "ghost" of the "Sinic universal state."&lt;ref name="Sun p.188"&gt;{{cite book |first = Lung-kee |last = Sun |title=The Chinese National Character: From Nationalhood to Individuality |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=0ZgRtzGLG_oC&amp;pg=PA188 |year=2002 |publisher = M.E. Sharpe |ISBN = 978-0-7656-0826-0 |page = 188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Nishijima Sadao ===
The Japanese historian Nishijima Sadao ({{Interlanguage link multi|西嶋定生|ja}}, 1919–1998) conceived a Chinese or East Asian cultural sphere largely isolated from other cultures. According to Nishijima, this cultural sphere shared the philosophy of Confucianism, the religion of Buddhism, and similar political and social structures. His cultural sphere includes China, Japan, Korea, Vietnam, and areas between Mongolia and the Himalayas.&lt;ref name="Fuchs"&gt;Wang Hui, "'Modernity and 'Asia' in the Study of Chinese History," in Eckhardt Fuchs, Benedikt Stuchtey, eds.,''Across cultural borders: historiography in global perspective'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=4wtBb5sWLyYC&amp;pg=PA322] (Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2002 {{ISBN|978-0-7425-1768-4}}), p. 322.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Edwin O. Reischauer ===
The American [[Sinologist]] and historian [[Edwin O. Reischauer]] grouped China, Korea, and Japan together into a cultural sphere that he called the Sinic world. These countries are centralized states that share a Confucian ethical philosophy. Reischauer states that this culture originated in Northern China, and compared the relationship between Northern China and East Asia to that of Greco-Roman civilization and Europe. The elites of East Asia were tied together through a common written language based on Chinese characters, much in the way that [[Latin]] had functioned in Europe.&lt;ref name="Reischauer"&gt;Edwin O. Reischauer, "The Sinic World in Perspective," ''Foreign Affairs ''52.2  (January 1974):  341-348. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/20038053 JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Samuel P. Huntington ===
The American political scientist [[Samuel P. Huntington]] considered the Sinic world as one of many civilizations in his ''[[The Clash of Civilizations]]''. He notes that "all scholars recognize the existence of either a single distinct Chinese civilization dating back to at least 1500 B.C. and perhaps a thousand years earlier, or of two Chinese civilizations one succeeding the other in the early centuries of the Christian  epoch." He comments that he originally used the term "Confucian", but "Sinic" is more accurate because it describes "the common culture of China and the Chinese communities in Southeast Asia and elsewhere outside of China as well as the related cultures of Vietnam and Korea."&lt;ref&gt;''The Clash of Civilizations and the Remaking of World Order.'' (New York: Simon &amp; Schuster,  1996; {{ISBN|0684811642}}), [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=Iq75qmi3Og8C&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR2&amp;dq=sinic+world+-sonic&amp;ots=my_p7oseo6&amp;sig=tT3szdeSMK6c7T5XMbZpYcxOms8#v=onepage&amp;q=sinic%20world%20-sonic&amp;f=false p. 45]&lt;/ref&gt;

Huntington's Sinic civilization includes China, North Korea, South Korea, Mongolia, Taiwan, Vietnam, and Chinese communities in Southeast Asia.&lt;ref name="Davis"&gt;{{cite book |author=William E. Davis |title=Peace And Prosperity in an Age of Incivility |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=w1okRtHKiLIC&amp;pg=PA197 |year=2006 |publisher=University Press of America |ISBN = 978-0-7618-3248-5 |page=197}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the many civilizations that Huntington discusses, the Sinic world is the only one that is based on a cultural, rather than religious, identity.&lt;ref name="Blinnikov"&gt;{{cite book |author = Michail S. Blinnikov |title = A Geography of Russia and Its Neighbors |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=QcoodEOmnMUC&amp;pg=PA132 |year=2011 |publisher=Guilford Press |ISBN = 978-1-60623-933-9 |page=132}}&lt;/ref&gt; Huntington's theory was that in a post-[[Cold War]] world, humanity "identify with cultural groups: tribes, ethnic groups, religious communities, and at the broadest level, civilizations."&lt;ref name="Sun p.032"&gt;{{cite book |author = Lung-kee Sun |title = The Chinese National Character: From Nationalhood to Individuality |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=0ZgRtzGLG_oC&amp;pg=PA32 |year=2002 |publisher=M.E. Sharpe |ISBN = 978-0-7656-0826-0 |page = 32}}&lt;/ref&gt; He portrayed the cultural sphere's political culture as one with "little room for social or political pluralism and the division of power" with "international politics as hierarchical because their domestic policies are." Huntington argued that the Sinic world would eventually oppose the West's hegemony in Asia, likely through forming an alliance with the Islamic world.&lt;ref name="Gusterson"&gt;{{cite book |author=Hugh Gusterson|title=People of the bomb: portraits of America's nuclear complex |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=iHJRW0GI31MC&amp;pg=PA124 |year=2004 |publisher=U of Minnesota Press |ISBN = 978-0-8166-3860-4 |page=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cultural commonalities==

=== Architecture ===
{{Main|Chinese architecture}}
Countries from the East Asian cultural sphere share a common architectural style stemming from the architecture of ancient China.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.com/books?id=tA_3y2XsMMsC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Philosophy and religions ===
{{Main|East Asian religions|Eastern philosophy#East Asian philosophies}}

'''Buddhism'''
{{Main|East Asian Buddhism}}

The countries of China, Japan, Korea, and Vietnam share a history of Mahayana Buddhism.

'''Taoism'''
{{Main|Taoism}}

The countries of China, Japan, Korea, and Vietnam have been influenced by Taoism.

==== Confucianism ====
{{Main|Confucianism}}

The countries of  China, Japan, Korea, and Vietnam share a Confucian philosophical worldview.&lt;ref name="Reischauer" /&gt; Confucianism is a [[humanism|humanistic]]&lt;ref name="juergensmeyer"&gt;{{cite book |title=Religion in global civil society |last= Juergensmeyer |first= Mark |year= 2005|publisher= Oxford University Press|location= |ISBN = 978-0-19-518835-6 |page = 70}}&lt;/ref&gt; philosophy that believes that human beings are teachable, improvable and perfectible through personal and communal endeavour especially including self-cultivation and self-creation. Confucianism focuses on the cultivation of virtue and maintenance of ethics, the most basic of which are ''[[Ren (Confucianism)|rén]]'' ({{lang|zh|仁}}), ''[[Yi (Confucianism)|yì]]'' ({{lang|zh|义}}/{{lang|zh|義}}), and ''[[Li (Confucian)|lǐ]]'' ({{lang|zh|礼}}/{{lang|zh|禮}}).&lt;ref name="craig"&gt;[[Edward Craig (philosopher)|Craig, Edward]]. ''Philosophy: A Very Short Introduction''. {{ISBN|0-19-285421-6}} {{Harvnb|Craig|1998|p=536}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ren'' is an obligation of [[altruism]] and humaneness for other individuals, ''yi'' is the upholding of righteousness and the moral disposition to do good, and ''li'' is a system of norms and propriety that determines how a person should properly act in everyday life.&lt;ref name="craig" /&gt;

==== Neo-Confucianism ====
{{Main|Neo-Confucianism}}
[[Mid-Imperial China|Mid-Imperial Chinese]] philosophy is primarily defined by the development of [[Neo-Confucianism]]. During the [[Tang Dynasty]], [[Buddhism]] from India also became a prominent philosophical and religious discipline. Neo-Confucianism has its origins in the [[Tang Dynasty]]; the Confucianist scholar [[Han Yu]] is seen as a forebear of the Neo-Confucianists of the Song Dynasty.&lt;ref name="huang"&gt;''Essentials of Neo-Confucianism: Eight Major Philosophers of the Song and Ming Periods'' by Huang, Siu-chi. {{Harvnb|Huang|1999|p=5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The Song Dynasty philosopher [[Zhou Dunyi]] is seen as the first true "pioneer" of Neo-Confucianism, using Daoist metaphysics as a framework for his ethical philosophy.&lt;ref name="chan"&gt;''A Sourcebook of Chinese Philosophy'' by Chan, Wing-tsit. {{Harvnb|Chan|2002|p=460}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Elsewhere in East Asia, [[Japanese philosophy]] began to develop as indigenous [[Shinto]] beliefs fused with [[Buddhism]], [[Confucianism]] and other schools of [[Chinese philosophy]]. Similar to Japan, in [[Korean philosophy]] elements of [[Korean Shamanism|Shamanism]] were integrated into the [[Korean Confucianism|Neo-Confucianism]] imported from China. In Vietnam, neo-Confucianism was developed into Vietnamese own Tam giáo as well, along with indigenous Vietnamese beliefs and [[Mahayana Buddhism]].

=== Literary culture ===
{{Main|Adoption of Chinese literary culture}}

East Asian literary culture was based on the use of [[Literary Chinese]], which became the medium of scholarship and government across the region. Although each of these countries developed vernacular writing systems and used them for popular literature, they continued to use Chinese for all formal writing until it was swept away by rising nationalism around the end of the 19th century.&lt;ref name="Kornicki"&gt;{{citation |chapter = A transnational approach to East Asian book history | pages = 65–79 |first = P.F. |last = Kornicki |authorlink = Peter Kornicki |title = New Word Order: Transnational Themes in Book History |editor1-first = Swapan |editor1-last = Chakravorty |editor2-first = Abhijit |editor2-last = Gupta |publisher = Worldview Publications |year = 2011 |ISBN = 978-81-920651-1-3 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=bjJBrKfCKIYC&amp;pg=PA65 |postscript = .}}{{Harvnb|Kornicki|2011|pp=75–77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout East Asia, Literary Chinese was the language of administration and scholarship. Although Vietnam, Korea and Japan each developed writing systems for their own languages, these were limited to popular literature. Chinese remained the medium of formal writing until it was displaced by vernacular writing in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.{{sfnp|Kornicki|2011|pp=66–67}}
Though they did not use Chinese for spoken communication, each country had its own tradition of reading texts aloud, the so-called [[Sino-Xenic pronunciations]], which provide clues to the pronunciation of [[Middle Chinese]]. Chinese words with these pronunciations were also borrowed extensively into the local vernaculars, and today comprise over half their vocabularies.{{sfnp|Miyake|2004|pp=98–99}}

Books in Literary Chinese were widely distributed. By the 7th century and possibly earlier, [[woodblock printing]] had been developed in China. At first, it was used only to copy the Buddhist scriptures, but later secular works were also printed.
By the 13th century, metal [[movable type]] used by government printers in Korea, but seems not to have been extensively used in China, Vietnam or Japan. At the same time manuscript reproduction remained important until the late 19th century.{{sfnp|Kornicki|2011|p=68}}

=== Economics ===
The [[commerce|business]] cultures of Sinosphere countries remain heavily influenced by Confucianism. Japan features hierarchically-organized [[company|companies]] and the Japanese place a high value on [[interpersonal relationship|relationship]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Where cultures meet; a cross-cultural comparison of business meeting styles | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=JUyRNpVtt5oC&amp;pg=PA69 |publisher= Hogeschool van Amsterdam |ISBN = 978-90-79646-17-3 |page= 69}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see [[Japanese work environment]]). Korean [[business]]es also adhere to Confucian values, and are structured around a [[patriarchy|patriarchal]] family governed by filial piety between management and a company's employees.&lt;ref name="Luong"&gt;{{cite book | author1= Timothy Book |author2= Hy V..

Following Japanese defeat and economic collapse after the war, Japan's economy recovered in the 1950s with the [[Japanese post-war economic miracle|post-war economic miracle]] in which rapid growth propelled the country to become the world's second largest economy by the 1980s. In the late 20th century and early 21st century, South Korea and China have become the 11th- and 2nd-largest economies in the world respectively, according to nominal GDP. Vietnamese commerce is also heavily influenced by Chinese methods, with some French methods (due to French colonialism). Vietnam, one of [[Jim O'Neill, Baron O'Neill of Gatley#Next Eleven|Next Eleven]] countries {{as of | 2005 | lc = on}}, is regarded{{by whom|date=August 2017}} as a rising [[Power (international relations)|power]] in Southeast Asia.

The then [[British Hong Kong|British colony of Hong Kong]] became one of the [[Four Asian Tigers|Four Asian Tiger]] economies, developing strong textile and manufacturing economies.&lt;ref name="Harrington"&gt;Compare: {{cite book | author1 = J. James W. Harrington |author2= Barney Warf |title = Industrial Location: Principles, Practice, and Policy |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=NBKjj5Wq6N0C&amp;pg=PA199 |year= 1995 |publisher= Routledge |ISBN = 978-0-415-10479-1 |page = 199 | quote = As the textile industry began to abandon places with high labor costs in the western industrialized world, it began to sprout up in a variety of Third World locations, in particular the famous 'Four Tiger' nations of East Asia: South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Singapore.

By 1997 the four Asian Tiger economies joined Japan as East Asia's developed economies. Present{{when|date=August 2017}} growth in East Asia has now shifted to China and to the [[Tiger Cub Economies]] of Southeast Asia.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

=== Cuisine ===
{{Main|East Asian cuisine}}

The cuisine of East Asia shares many of the same ingredients and techniques. Chopsticks are used as an eating utensil in all of the core East Asian countries.&lt;ref name="Davidson"&gt;{{cite book |first = Alan |last = Davidson |title = Food in Motion: The Migration of Foodstuffs and Cookery Techniques : Proceedings : Oxford Symposium 1983 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=zcNdB_sl2JkC&amp;pg=PA22 |year=1981 |publisher=Oxford Symposium |ISBN = 978-0-907325-07-9 |page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of soy sauce, a sauce made from fermenting soy beans, is also widespread in East Asia. Rice is a main staple food in all of East Asia and is a major focus of [[food security]].&lt;ref name="Chern"&gt;{{cite book |author1 = Wen S. Chern |author2 = Colin A. Carter |author3=Shun-yi Shei |title = Food security in Asia: economics and policies |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=zcOmGXTqYWMC&amp;pg=PA2 |year=2000 |publisher = Edward Elgar Publishing |ISBN = 978-1-78254-334-3 |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In East Asian countries, the word for 'cooked rice' can embody the meaning of food in general ([[simplified Chinese]]: {{lang|zh-hans|饭}}; [[traditional Chinese]]: {{lang|zh-hant|飯}}; [[pinyin]]: {{audio|Zh-fàn.ogg|fàn|help=no}}).&lt;ref name="Davidson" /&gt;

=== Chinese characters ===
{{main|Chinese characters}}
Historically China, Japan, Korea, and Vietnam have used Chinese characters. Today they are mainly used in China, Taiwan, Japan, and South Korea to a limited extent (i.e. scholarly papers, newspapers, etc.), albeit in different forms.

Although Chinese characters have become almost obsolete in Vietnam and North Korea, they still hold a special place in the cultures as their history and literature have been greatly influenced by Chinese characters; Chinese characters can be seen in temples, cemeteries, and monuments today, as well as serving as decorative motifs in art and design.

=== New Year ===
{{Main|Lunar New Year}}
China, Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Vietnam traditionally observe the same lunar new year. However, Japan has moved its New Year to fit the Western New Year since the [[Meiji Restoration]] while Korea later also moved to Western New Year since 1970s.

== Etymology of Sinosphere and related terms ==
The term Sinosphere is sometimes used as a synonym for the East Asian cultural sphere. The [[etymology]] of ''{{linktext|Sinosphere}}'' is from ''{{linktext|Sino-}}'' "China; Chinese" (cf. [[Sinophone]]) and ''{{linktext|-sphere}}'' in the sense of "[[sphere of influence]]", "area influenced by a country". The "[[CJK]]V" languages – Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Vietnamese – translate the English ''-sphere'' as Chinese ''quān'' {{lang|zh|{{linktext|圈}}}} "circle; ring; corral; pen",&lt;ref&gt;DeFrancis, John, ed. (2003), ''ABC Chinese-English Comprehensive Dictionary'', University of Hawaii Press, p. 750.&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese ''ken'' "sphere; circle; range; radius",&lt;ref&gt;T. Watanabe, E. R. Skrzypczak, and P. Snowden (2003), ''[[Kenkyūsha's New Japanese-English Dictionary]]'', Kenkyusha, p. 873. Compare [[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere]].&lt;/ref&gt; Korean ''gwon''{{citation needed|date=December 2012}} and Vietnamese ''quyển''.

[[Victor H. Mair]] discussed the origins of these "culture sphere" terms.&lt;ref&gt;Victor Mair, [http://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=4306 Sinophone and Sinosphere], [[Language Log]], November 8, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese ''{{transl|zh|wénhuà quān}}'' {{lang|zh|文化圈}} dates back to a 1941 translation for German ''[[Kulturkreis]]'' "culture circle/field", which the Austrian [[ethnologists]] [[Fritz Graebner]] and [[Wilhelm Schmidt (linguist)|Wilhelm Schmidt]] proposed. The Japanese historian {{nihongo|Nishijima Sadao|西嶋定生||1919-1998}}, professor emeritus at the [[University of Tokyo]], coined the expressions {{nihongo|''Kanji bunka ken''|漢字文化圏||"Chinese-character culture sphere"}} and {{nihongo|''Chuka bunka ken''|中華文化圏||"Chinese culture sphere"}}, which Chinese later borrowed as [[loanwords]]. Nishijima devised these Sinitic "cultural spheres" within his {{nihongo|"Theory of an East Asian World"|東アジア世界論|Higashi Ajia sekai-ron}}.

Chinese-English dictionaries give similar translations of this keyword ''{{transl|zh|wénhuà quān}}'' {{lang|zh|文化圈}}: "the intellectual or literary circles" ([[Liang Shiqiu]] 1975), "literary, educational circle(s)" ([[Lin Yutang]] 1972), and "intellectual/literary circles" ([[John DeFrancis]] 1996).

This cultural region closely corresponds to the [[History of China#Ancient China|ancient "Sinic civilization"]] and its descendants, the "Far Eastern civilizations" (the Mainland and the Japanese ones), which [[Arnold J. Toynbee]] presented in the 1930s in ''[[A Study of History]]'', along with the [[Western world|Western]], Islamic, Eastern Orthodox, Indic, etc. civilizations, among the major "units of study" of the world's history.&lt;ref&gt;See the "family tree" of Toynbee's "civilizations" in any edition of Toynbee's own work, or e.g. as Fig.1 on p.16 of: ''The Rhythms of History: A Universal Theory of Civilizations'', By Stephen Blaha. Pingree-Hill Publishing, 2002. {{ISBN|0-9720795-7-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Ecotage!''''' was a 1972 paperback book edited by Sam Love and David Obst and published by [[Pocket Books]].

The book was a collection of ideas that had been solicited by the group [[Environmental Action]] over the previous year in preparation for the publication of the book, for using sabotage, attention-grabbing stunts, and other ideas to draw attention to environmental issues.&lt;ref name="IntheWake"&gt;Cheryl R. Jorgensen-Earp, ''In the Wake of Violence: Image &amp; Social Reform'' ([[MSU Press]], 2008), {{ISBN|978-0870139291}}, 
[https://books.google.com/books?id=lbJ6nYHCGa4C&amp;lpg=PT31&amp;ots=epj_q191YM&amp;dq=%22environmental%20action%22%20ecotage%20book&amp;pg=PT31#v=onepage&amp;q=%22environmental%20action%22%20ecotage%20book&amp;f=false Excerpts available] at [[Google Books]].&lt;/ref&gt;  "Ecotage" is a contraction of [[ecological]] (or economic) and [[sabotage]].  The cover of ''Ecotage!'' features a photograph of a [[hippie]] throwing a pie in the face of a business executive.

The book is credited as one of the early inspirations for radical environmental activism, along with similar works such as [[Edward Abbey]]'s 1975 novel ''[[The Monkey Wrench Gang]]''.&lt;ref name="TerrorismNarrative"&gt;Thomas Carl Austenfeld, Dimiter Daphinoff, Jens Herlth, eds., ''Terrorism and Narrative Practice'' ([[LIT Verlag]] Münster, 2011), {{ISBN|978-3643800824}}, p. 211. [https://books.google.com/books?id=Zv2ARCzJsLoC&amp;lpg=PA211&amp;ots=cLLr1tVoUB&amp;dq=Ecotage%20%22david%20obst%22&amp;pg=PA211#v=onepage&amp;q=Ecotage%20&amp;f=false Excerpts available] at [[Google Books]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G2-3409000760.html "Eco-Terrorism"], ''[[St. James Encyclopedia of Popular Culture]]'' (2000) {{subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The book was inspired by the actions of an individual who operated in the [[Chicago, Illinois]] area.  Calling himself "[[James F. Phillips|The Fox]]", he engaged in such activities as plugging smokestacks and entering the offices of corporate executives to dump sewage on their desks.&lt;ref name="TerrorismNarrative"/&gt;  In turn, some of the actions suggested in ''Ecotage!'' actually began to be carried out, particularly billboarding, when small groups in the early 1970s such as the one calling themselves the "Eco-Raiders" in [[Tucson, Arizona]], began cutting down billboards.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

The term [[ecotage]] may have originated with this book;&lt;ref name="IntheWake"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Clarence Petersen, [http://archives.chicagotribune.com/1972/03/26/page/287/article/paperbacks "Paperbacks"], ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', March 26, 1972 ("''Ecotage!'' ... adds a new word to the language ...").&lt;/ref&gt; the term has since passed into general use as a synonym for various [[direct action]] tactics (see also [[monkeywrenching]]).

'''Gajary''' ({{lang-de|Gayring}}) is a [[village]] and [[municipality]] in western [[Slovakia]] close to the town of [[Malacky]] in the [[Bratislava region]]. It lies around 40&amp;nbsp;km (25&amp;nbsp;statute miles) north-west of Slovakia's capital [[Bratislava]] close to the Austrian border. The village has around 3500 inhabitants.

The village is an important archaeological site: findings from the [[Neolithic]] period, [[Eneolithic]] period, [[Bronze Age]], early [[Slavs|Slavic]] period (several Slavic settlements) have been excavated there. Ing. Ján Kubíček (1922–2003) former head of Finance at Slovakia's Ministry of Internal Affairs was born there.

==Names and etymology==
The [[Slovak language|Slovak]] name ''Gajary'' (1460 ''Gayary'') comes from [[Germans|German]] personal name [[Geier (surname)|Geier]] (1337 ''Gaywar'', later German name was ''Gairing''). In the 14th century, the village had also the [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] name ''Öregház'' (''Old House'', 1377 ''Eureghaz''), but the name was forgotten and then they used the name of German origin ''Gajár''.&lt;ref name="varsik"&gt;{{cite book| first=Branislav | last=Varsik | author-link=Branislav Varsik | title= Z osídlenia západného a stredného Slovenska v stredoveku | publisher = Veda, vydavateľstvo Slovenskej akadémie vied | year = 1984 | location = Bratislava | p=102| language = Slovak}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Politics of Andorra}}

The '''General Council''' ({{lang-ca|Consell General d'Andorra}}, {{IPA-ca|kunˈsɛʎ ʒənəˈɾal dənˈdorə|IPA}}) is the [[unicameral]] [[parliament]] of [[Andorra]]. It is sometimes referred to as the '''General Council of the Valleys''' (Catalan: ''Consell General de les Valls'') because it was the historical name and to distinguish it from similarly named bodies in the [[Val d'Aran]] and in [[France]].

==Organization==
There are twenty-eight "general councillors", who are elected for four-year terms based on party lists in a [[closed list]] system:&lt;ref&gt;Art. 42.2, Law 28/2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
*two general councillors from each of the seven [[Parishes of Andorra|parishes]], elected from the list with most votes in each parish;&lt;ref&gt;Art. 57, Law 28/2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
*fourteen general councillors elected from national lists using the [[largest remainder method]] of [[proportional representation]].&lt;ref&gt;Art. 58, Law 28/2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
The parish lists and the national list are independent of one another: the same person cannot appear on both the national list and on a parish list, and voters cast two separate ballots (there is no requirement to vote for the same party for both lists).&lt;ref&gt;Arts. 19, 51 &amp; 52, Law 28/2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a recent development; originally, the [[parishes of Andorra|seven parishes]] had each returned four deputies. However, as parishes varied in population from 350 to 2,500, this was felt to be significantly imbalanced, and the national list system was introduced for the 1997 elections to counter the disproportionate power held by the smallest parishes. {{cn|date=June 2012}}

The Council appoints a presiding officer, titled the ''Síndic general'', and a deputy, the ''subsíndic''. The current ''Síndic general'' is Vicenç Mateu Zamora of the Democrats for Andorra.

The General Council (subject to approval of the [[List of Co-Princes of Andorra|Co-Princes]]) elects the Head of Government, who presides over the Executive Council. The Head of Government appoints the remaining seven members of the Executive Council. The current Head of Government, is [[Antoni Martí]].

==Membership==
{{further|Andorran parliamentary election, 2015}}

Political parties are a recent innovation; the first party was formed in 1976, and they only gained legal recognition in 1992.
The most recent [[Andorran parliamentary election, 2015|Andorran parliamentary election]] was March 2015.

The General Council has the second-highest proportion of women legislators (behind the [[Chamber of Deputies of Rwanda|lower house of the Rwandan legislature]]), and the highest in the developed world.  Exactly half of its members (14 out of 28) are women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ipu.org/wmn-e/classif.htm |title=Women in Parliaments: World Classification |publisher=Ipu.org |date=2012-03-31 |accessdate=2012-05-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140328105108/http://www.ipu.org/wmn-e/classif.htm |archivedate=28 March 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first parliament in Andorra was established in 1419, as the ''Consell de la Terra''. Councillors were elected by the population, and the council appointed ''[[syndics]]'' to manage the administration of the principality. It remained in force for several hundred years, slowly becoming the fiefdom of a few major families; this caused popular discontent by the nineteenth century, and major reforms were instituted in 1866.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.worldstatesmen.org/andorra_1866.txt&lt;/ref&gt;

The reforms were masterminded by [[Guillem d'Areny-Plandolit]], and had several effects:

* The Consell de la Terra was abolished, and replaced by the ''Consell General de las Valls'', with a syndic and vice-syndic
* The [[Suffrage|franchise]] was extended to all heads of families
* Regular elections were laid down; in this case, twelve of the twenty-four (as there then were) councillors were to be elected every two years

In the 1930s, matters again began to boil over; one point of particular contention was that the Council had begun regularly referring to Andorra as a republic, which understandably caused some contention with the co-princes. The General Council was dissolved on their order in June 1933, and a special election called to re-elect it. The opportunity was taken to change the voting laws; at this point, all men over twenty-five could vote, and all men over thirty stand for election.

In 1970, the vote was extended to women over twenty-five; in 1971 the qualifying age for all electors was lowered to twenty-one, and that of candidates to twenty-five. Women gained the right to run for office in 1973, and in 1978 a [[referendum]] was held on the matter of further reform.

Later that year, a seventh parish ([[Escaldes-Engordany]]) was formed, bringing the numbers of councillors to twenty-eight.

In 1982, the Executive Council was created, comprising the Executive Council President and four councillors with ministerial duties.

'''Heróis do Mar''' was a [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[pop rock]] band formed in March 1981. The group was disbanded in 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Heróis do Mar: documentário em ante-estreia no Porto|url=http://cotonete.clix.pt/noticias/body.aspx?id=33688|work=cotonete|accessdate=21 March 2012|date=2 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their name ''Heróis do Mar'' is taken from the first line of the [[Portuguese national anthem]].

'''Hope Black''' (''née'' MacPherson, 1919 – 25 January 2018) was an Australian scientist, a marine biologist and [[malacologist]].&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://tributes.theage.com.au/obituaries/theage-au/obituary.aspx?n=hope-black&amp;pid=188005579 |title=Hope BLACK's Obituary on The Age |date=30 January 2018 |website=The Age |access-date=2018-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1937 she started working at the National Museum of Victoria. Subsequently she became Curator of Molluscs at the museum in 1946. She was the National Museum's first female curator. When she married in 1965, she was forced to leave the museum, and instead became a science teacher for thirteen years.

==Career==
Appointed as Curator of Mollusks in 1946, Hope MacPherson was Australia's first female curator at the [[Museum Victoria|National Museum of Victoria]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://collections.museumvictoria.com.au/articles/8027|title=Hope Black nee Macpherson, Curator of Molluscs (1919-2018)|work=Museums Victoria Collections|access-date=2018-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her tenure was brought to a close prematurely, when in 1965 she married and became Hope Black, requiring her retirement from the Victorian public service as a result of the [[marriage bar]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Subsequently Black worked for 13 years as a science teacher.&lt;ref name="museumvictoria2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://museumvictoria.com.au/about/mv-blog/mar-2012/hope-black-honoured/ |title=Hope Black honoured |publisher=[[Museum Victoria]] |date= |accessdate=2014-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work in marine biology==
[[File:Portrait-of-hope-macpherson-museum-victoria-curator-of-molluscs-1946-1965 (public domain).jpg|thumb|left|Portrait of Hope Black (circa 1950s)]]
Hope Black was initially employed in 1937 at Museum Victoria by the support of the [[Carnegie Corporation]]. She worked on developing and preparing new display cases for the McCoy Hall [[diorama]]s.&lt;ref name="museumvictoria1919"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://museumvictoria.com.au/collections/themes/8027/hope-black-nee-macpherson-curator-of-molluscs-1919# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-08-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140814152446/http://museumvictoria.com.au/collections/themes/8027/hope-black-nee-macpherson-curator-of-molluscs-1919# |archive-date=2014-08-14 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1947 Black collaborated to survey the [[Snowy River]] Gorge on horseback, prior construction of the [[Snowy Mountains Scheme|Snowy Mountains Hydroelectric Scheme]].&lt;ref name="museumvictoria1919"/&gt;

Between 1957-1963, Black carried out biological surveys of [[Port Phillip Bay]], and her results are still used as baseline data from which to measure environmental change in the area.&lt;ref name="museumvictoria2"/&gt;

Black investigated the genus ''[[Teredo (genus)|Teredo]]'', a group of marine bivalve mollusks known as "shipworms". She also surveyed edible [[mollusc]]s in Victoria. Ultimately, her mollusc research lead to her writing the book ''[[Molluscs of Victoria]]'', which was published in 1962.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Notably, Black was also a member of a group of four women (also including [[Isobel Bennett]], Susan Ingham and [[Mary Gillham]]) who were the first to carry out research in the [[sub-Antarctic]] in 1959.&lt;ref name="museumvictoria2"/&gt; She was inducted into the [[Victorian Honour Roll of Women]] in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Morris|first=Deborah|title=Somerville woman named on honour roll|url=https://www.webcitation.org/6RsfyTKt1|newspaper=Frankston Standard Leader|date=9 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At around 700, the Muslims conquered the area from the [[Visigoths]], through the [[Segre (river)|Segre]] valley.  The Muslims did not really stay in Andorra, rather using it as a shortcut to get to [[Toulouse]], [[Narbonne]], [[Carcassonne]] and [[Nîmes]].

The [[Battle of Tours|Battle of Poitiers]] and the [[Battle of Roncesvalles]] marked the end of those expeditions to the other part of the [[Pyrenees]].

According to [[Antoni Filter i Rossell]] in his history book the [[Manual Digest]] (1748), in 788, 5000 Andorrans, led by [[Marc Almugàver]] came to Charlemagne's assistance in the [[Vall de Carol]] in fighting the Muslims.  After the battle, Charlemagne gave his protection to Andorra and declared them as a sovereign people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.andorramania.com/histoire_gb.htm Geography and History of the Principality of Andorra]&lt;/ref&gt;

although their isolation also makes them a difficult target.

==Natural resources==
Many island countries rely heavily on [[Fish as food|fish]] for their main supply of food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Many of the world's poorest people depend on fish |publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations |date=2005-06-07 |url=http://www.fao.org/Newsroom/en/news/2005/102911/index.html |accessdate=2017-09-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
Some island countries are more affected than other countries by [[climate change]], which produces problems such as reduced [[land use]], [[water scarcity]] and sometimes even resettlement issues. Some low-lying island countries are slowly being submerged by the rising water levels of the [[Pacific Ocean]].&lt;ref name="Leader of disappearing island nation"&gt;{{cite web

| accessdate = 2009-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Climate change also impacts island countries by causing natural disasters such as [[tropical cyclone]]s, hurricanes, [[flash flood]]s and [[drought]].&lt;ref name="Climate change threatens food security"&gt;{{cite web
| title = FAO: Climate change threatens food security of Pacific island countries

==Economics==
Many island countries rely heavily on imports and are greatly affected by changes in the global economy.&lt;ref name="cctv"&gt;{{cite web
| title = Global economic crisis a concern for Pacific island countries
| date = 2008-10-28
| url = http://www.cctv.com/program/bizchina/20081028/106856.shtml
| accessdate = 2009-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Due to the nature of island countries their economies are often characterised by being smaller, relatively isolated from world trade and economy, more vulnerable to shipping costs, and more likely to suffer environmental damage to infrastructure; exceptions include Japan and the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name="Trade Policy Course"&gt;{{cite web

The dominant industry for many island countries is [[tourism]].&lt;ref name="tourist destinations"&gt;{{cite news
| title = China enlists Pacific island countries as tourist destinations, XINHUA.
| date = 10 August 2004
| url = http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-12915601_ITM

| work=The America's Intelligence Wire}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition==
Island countries are typically small with low populations, although some, like [[Indonesia]] and [[Japan]] are notable exceptions.&lt;ref name="Wen pledges new aid to Pacific countries"&gt;{{cite web
| title = Wen pledges new aid to Pacific countries
| publisher = International Herald Tribune

Some island countries are centred on one or two major islands, such as the [[United Kingdom]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]], [[New Zealand]], [[Cuba]], [[Bahrain]], [[Singapore]], [[Iceland]], [[Malta]], and [[Taiwan]]. Others are spread out over hundreds or thousands of smaller islands, such as [[Indonesia]], the [[Philippines]], [[The Bahamas]], [[Seychelles]], and the [[Maldives]]. Some island countries share one or more of their islands with other countries, such as the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[Republic of Ireland]]; [[Haiti]] and the [[Dominican Republic]]; and [[Indonesia]], which shares islands with [[Papua New Guinea]], [[Brunei]], [[East Timor]], and [[Malaysia]].

Geographically, the country of [[Australia]] is considered a [[continent]]al landmass rather than an island, covering the largest landmass of the [[Australia (continent)|Australian continent]]. In the past, however, it was considered an island country for tourism purposes&lt;ref name="nla.gov.au"&gt;{{cite web

==Kernei==
The ''kernei'' is a Kyrgyz wind musical instrument, which as well as the ''surnai'' ({{lang-fa|سرنای}}) was not modernised for ensembles or orchestras and exists in traditional form. It is used particularly for signaling or as a ceremonial instrument with a powerful sound and piercing timbre. There are two kinds of ''kernei'': the ''muiuz kernei'' (made from a [[mountain goat]] horn), and the ''jez kernei'' (made of copper or brass). Both of them are very different instruments, but they are combined by lack of playing apertures.&lt;!--"combined by lack of playing apertures" doesn't mean anything in English. Please clarify.--&gt;

==Muiuz kernei==
[[File:Members of the Military Brass Band of Tajikistan with Karnays.jpg|thumb|Members of a Tajik Military Brass Band playing Karnays.]]
The ''muiuz kernei'' is an ancient instrument made from a curved mountain goat horn, ranging in length between 30 and 40&amp;nbsp;cm. The instrument does not have a mouthpiece and gives only a few sounds of thick, soft timbre. The [[Military Brass Band of the Commandant Regiment of the Ministry of Defense of Tajikistan]] (the only military band in the world to use karnays) uses the Muiuz kernei.

==Jez kernei==
The ''jez kernei'' is 1–2 m long longitudinal trumpet with/without a mouthpiece. Faucet diameter is 20&amp;nbsp;cm. The similarity between the ''jez kernei'' and the Uzbek and Uigur ''karnai'' is accounted by the territorial nearness of South Kyrgyzstan and Uzbekistan. The sound of Kernei is very strong, loud and intended for outdoor areas. Some time in the past the ''kernei'''s applied function was restricted by notification of important events, but today it is typically used for national holidays.

The separate group of Kyrgyz aerophones represent the instruments, which considerably yield the main kinds of folk wind instruments by quality of timbre and artistic importance. They can be called as noise instruments. They were not produced by people, they exist in the nature and produce neither musical nor artistic sounds. They include the ''chymyldak'' - produce squeak, ''yshkyryk'' - whistle, ''baryldak'' - under tongue aerophone, ''chynyrtky'' - hunter's quail call, ''jalbyrak'' - "explosive" aerophone.

Founded in 1948, it is the oldest of its kind in the Republic of Macedonia, even older than the most famous Macedonian folklore ensemble [[Tanec]], which was founded in 1949. The ensemble is best known for the dance with the same name [[Kopačka (folk dance)|''Kopačka'']].

In November 2008, the Kopačka ensemble marked its 60 years jubilee. There was also a guest ensemble from [[Melnik, Bulgaria]].

The '''NIOD Institute for War, Holocaust and Genocide Studies''' ([[Dutch language|Dutch]]: ''NIOD Instituut voor Oorlogs-, Holocaust- en Genocidestudies'') is an [[organisation]] in the [[Netherlands]] which maintains archives and carries out [[history|historical]] studies into the [[Second World War]], the Holocaust and other genocides around the world, past and present. The institute was founded as a merger of the '''Netherlands Institute for War Documentation''' ([[Dutch language|Dutch]]: ''Nederlands instituut voor oorlogsdocumentatie'', NIOD, formerly '''National Institute for War Documentation''', [[Dutch language|Dutch]]: ''Rijksinstituut voor oorlogsdocumentatie'', RIOD) and the '''Center for Holocaust and Genocide Studies''' (CHGS).&lt;ref name="merge"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.niod.knaw.nl/en/instituutsgeschiedenis.asp| title=A short history of the NIOD | date= | accessdate=25 July 2012 |author=| publisher=NIOD Institute for War, Holocaust and Genocide Studies }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been part of the [[Koninklijke Nederlandse Akademie van Wetenschappen|Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences]] since January 1, 1999.&lt;ref name="merge"/&gt;

==Duties==
According to its website, the NIOD Institute is intended to:
{{quote|Collect, manages, opens up and makes accessible archives and collections about the Second World War. Conduct academic research and publishes about it. Give information to government bodies and individual. Stimulate and organise debates and activities about war violence and processes that are at the basis of war violence.&lt;ref name="About NIOD" /&gt;}}
It administers the archives of the German occupation of the Netherlands and the Japanese occupation of the Dutch East Indies, as well as large collections of clandestine newspapers and pamphlets, photographs, books and articles.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.knaw.nl/en/institutes/niod?set_language=en KNAW page on NIOD Institute for War, Holocaust and Genocide Studies]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Studies and publications==
The institute published ''Het Koninkrijk der Nederlanden in de Tweede Wereldoorlog''&amp;nbsp;([[The Kingdom of the Netherlands During World War II]]) in fourteen volumes and 18,000 pages. The magnum opus of [[Loe de Jong]] is the standard reference on the history of the Netherlands during [[World War II]]. The NIOD had recently made an electronic edition of the entire work, available for downloading from 11 December 2011, licensed under creative commons CC BY 3.0.&lt;ref name=Kingdom&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.niod.knaw.nl/koninkrijk/|title= The Kingdom of the Netherlands During World War II|author= Loe de Jong|date= 1969–1991|work= |publisher= NIOD|accessdate=21 December 2011 | language=Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It also performed a study into the [[Srebrenica massacre]] of 1995, which led to the report [[Srebrenica: a ‘safe’ area]], which led to the resignation of the [[second cabinet of Wim Kok]].

'''NSS-5''' (Formerly known as '''Intelsat 803''' and '''NSS-803''') is a [[communications satellite]] operated by [[Intelsat]] and after by [[SES World Skies]]. Launched in 1997 it was operated in [[geostationary orbit]] at a longitude of 50.5 degrees east for around 14 years.

==Satellite==
The third of six [[Intelsat VIII]] satellites to be launched, NSS-5 was built by [[Lockheed Martin]]. It was a {{convert|3412|kg|lb|adj=on}} spacecraft. The satellite carried a 2x[[LEROS-1B]] [[apogee motor]] for propulsion and was equipped with 38 [[C band (IEEE)|C Band]] [[transponder]]s and 6 [[Ku band]] [[transponder]]s, powered by 2 solar cells more batteries.&lt;ref name="EA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/craft/intlsat.htm|title=Intelsat|first=Mark|last=Wade|work=Encyclopedia Astronautica|accessdate=May 5, 2017}}{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was designed for a fourteen-year service life.&lt;ref name="gsp"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/intelsat-8.htm|title=Intelsat-8 (801, 802, 803, 804) / NSS 803 → NSS 5|first=Gunter|last=Krebs|work=Gunter's Space Page|accessdate=May 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Launch==
The launch of NSS-5 made use of a [[Ariane 4]] rocket flying from [[Guiana Space Centre]], [[Kourou]], [[French Guiana]]. The launch took place at 23:58 UTC on September 23, 1997, with the spacecraft entering a [[geosynchronous transfer orbit]].&lt;ref name="launchlog"/&gt; NSS-5 subsequently fired its apogee motor to achieve [[geostationary orbit]].

The '''New Monarchs''' was a concept developed by European historians during the first half of the 20th century to characterize 15th-century European rulers who unified their respective nations, creating stable and centralized governments.&lt;ref&gt;Slavin (1964)&lt;/ref&gt; This centralization allowed for an era of worldwide [[colonization]] and conquest in the 16th century, and paved the way for rapid economic growth in Europe. Many historians argue the [[Military Revolution]] made possible, and indeed made necessary, formation of strong central governments in order to maximize military strength that could enable conquest and prevent being conquered.&lt;ref&gt;Parker (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

The best examples of New Monarchs are, chronologically:

*[[John I of Portugal]] — terminated the political anarchy and began the [[Portugal in the period of discoveries|Portuguese period of discoveries]]
*[[Charles VII of France]] — ended civil disputes
*[[Louis XI of France]] — united [[France]], reorganized the economy, and weakened the power of the nobility
*[[Isabella I of Castile]] and [[Ferdinand II of Aragon]] — They never combined their territory. They always ruled their own land independently, weakened the power of the nobility, completed the [[Reconquista]], reformed the state finances, the law, the church, the army and began the age of Spanish exploration. They also outlawed all religions except Catholicism.   
*[[Henry VII of England]] — ended the [[Wars of the Roses|War of the Roses]], brought [[England]] from bankruptcy to prosperity, built up the [[Royal Navy]], and unified England politically by eliminating potential competitors to the throne, pacifying [[Yorkist]] resistance by marrying [[Elizabeth of York]], and checking the power of the nobility.

The Achievements of the New Monarchs:

*Limiting the power of the [[feudalism|feudal]] [[aristocracy]]
*Creating efficient, centralized systems of [[tax]]ation
*Maintaining a standing [[army]] loyal to the monarch
*Encouraging some sense of national identity (but by no means [[nationalism]] yet)
*Fostering [[trade]], both internally and externally
*Enforcing religious unity within their countries

While [[Peter the Great]] ruled two centuries after the New Monarchs, he is sometimes considered the New Monarch of [[Russia]], accomplishing for his country very much what the New Monarchs did for theirs.

After the New Monarchs, the [[Absolute monarchy|Absolutist Monarchs]] gained sway, to be followed by the [[Enlightened Absolutism]].

==History==
New Monarchies, which were very powerful centralized governments with unified inhabitants, began to emerge in the mid-15th century. Factors responsible for this advance were the vast demographic and economic growth. Before these New Monarchies were formed there were many changes the new monarchs had to make: including weakening powerful rivals, increasing revenue, unifying the country, and strengthening the power of the king and his bureaucracy. Two countries successful in strengthening themselves were France and England. England was headed by Henry VII and his son Henry VIII of the Tudor dynasty; France was headed by Louis XI, Louis XII and Frances I of the Valois dynasty. {{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}

Many factors were responsible for the New Monarchies rise from the years 1450-1550. Firstly, there was a giant demographic growth with an increase in population by fifty percent; this huge growth caused an increase in the number of people paying the king’s taxes. This demographic growth led to an economic growth because there was a greater demand, which stimulated the economy. The major economic growth was where people began taking bigger risks and forming partnerships, enabling large sums of money to be invested. People became wealthier causing a bigger consumption of goods and luxuries, making merchants and traders wealthy.  Merchants were then paying larger amounts in tariffs, increasing the king’s revenue.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}

To create and sustain a new monarchy kings have to introduce many changes. At the early 15th century there was political fragmentation, where countries were not unified and had many separate rulers governing small areas. At that time the nobility and the church rose to be the thriving powers.  Now the king had to effect changes to unify and strengthen his monarchy. He would have to weaken his rivals, the church and nobility, and transfer the authority to himself. He would also have to increase his funding by either increasing taxes, or selling government offices. Many kings{{Who|date=April 2013}} did both. {{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}

The rulers of England and France both have to weaken their rivals, the church and nobility, to constrict power to themselves. England did not have as hard a time as France in weakening the nobles because Henry VII comes to power after the [[War of Roses]], which was between two noble families, his family, the [[House of Lancaster]] and his rivals, the [[House of York]].  His{{who|date=April 2013}} family defeated the House of York thereby weakening the noble class even before Henry comes to rule. Moreover, England had a very short supply of nobility, ranging from 50-60 families.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}} Henry VII hires the [[gentry]], the class below nobility, to serve as Justices of Peace, who enforce the king’s law and collect taxes; this weakened the power of nobility and made sure the king’s laws were followed. Henry VII also increases the power of his royal court, the Star Chamber, via giving them cases that previously went to nobility: thus increasing his own power and decreasing the power of nobility. Unlike England’s simple modification, France had a difficult time weakening its nobles, the aristocrats. Before the mid-1400s the aristocrats were very powerful, serving as independent rulers with their own laws and courts. Frances I sells offices in government, many of which come with a title. This increases the number of men in the class of nobles enabling Frances to dilute the aristocracy with men loyal to him. {{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}

These two countries had very separate methods of dealing with the problem of the church and its power. Henry VIII, under the advice of [[Thomas Cromwell]], decides to break off from the [[Catholic church]] and start his own religion, the [[Anglican Communion|Anglican church]]. Francis I, on the other hand, decides on a more simplistic approach and forces the pope to sign the [[Concordat Of Bologna]] in 1516, which gave the king power to appoint whomever he wants for bishops and other religious positions and lessened the power of the [[papacy]]. {{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}
 
Both kings needed to increase revenue. France needed more capital than England because of its permanent army of 15,000 soldiers, which cost half of the king’s revenue.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}} Both countries improved tax collection by preventing people from evading taxes. Henry VII concocted numerous schemes to increase his revenue. Since he needed Parliament’s consent to could increase taxes, he increased fines for criminals. This had the dual effect of decreasing crime and increasing his treasury. Furthermore, he sold monopolies, which fetched large sums because those in possession could sell their products at any price, without fear of competition. France had a slightly different way of doing things; Frances I sold positions of government, and centralized tax collection under one agency. With one agency heading the collection, fewer people were able to evade taxes. France also instituted new taxes.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}

Though stabilizing New Monarchies was not easy, it proved to be very worthwhile. After Henry VIII and Francis I, wars began for England and France, England’s northern rising and France’s civil war. Both countries are able to pull through because of the strength invested during the New Monarchies. Additionally the strength formed during England’s New Monarchies helped withstand the fragile reigns of Edward and Mary, who followed after [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}

'''[[India]]'''&amp;nbsp;– [[List of countries and outlying territories by total area|seventh-largest]] country by area, located on the [[Indian subcontinent]] in [[South Asia]]. India was home to the ancient [[Indus Valley Civilisation]], and is the birthplace of four world religions—[[Hinduism in India|Hinduism]], [[Sikhism in India|Sikhism]], [[History of Buddhism in India|Buddhism]], [[Statistics of Jainism|Jainism]]. India endured [[Colonial India|colonization]], eventually being [[British Raj|administered by the United Kingdom]] from the mid-19th century to the mid-20th century. India became an independent nation in 1947 after a [[Indian independence movement|struggle for independence]] that was mainly [[non-violent resistance]], led by influential figures like [[Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi|Mahatma Gandhi]], and underwent a violent [[Partition of India|partition]]. India is the [[List of countries by population|second-most populous]] country with [[Demographics of India|over 1.2 billion people]], and is also the most populous [[democracy]] in the world.
